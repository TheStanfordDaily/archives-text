# Experts Say Major Earthquake To Happen Here
## 
### HANK LIESE 
Stanford's second major earth
quake is on its way. It could be
as destructive as the 1906 shock,
but scientists might be able to
give from 10 minutes' to an
hour's warning before it strikes.
Ninety per cent of the earth
quakes in the United States oc
cur in California, but only one
in 10,000 does any amount of
damage. Some experts says this
"l-in-10,000" quake is just
around the corner.
"Without knowing exactly
when, we can say that between
now and the year 2000 Califor
nia and adjoining areas will
have many moderate earth
quakes, a few severe ones, and
perhaps one great one," said
Louis C. Pakiser, chief of the
U.S. Geological Survey's Nation
al Center for Earthquake Re
search in Menlo Park.
Dr. Richard Jahns, dean of the
Stanford School of Earth Scien
ces, agrees. "I don't think there
is any doubt that the Ray Area
is overdue, in a statistical sense,
for a major earthquake. Every
thing we know about the San
Andreas fault suggests that

twice a century, on the average,
you can expect a major shock.
On this basis, we're overdue.
When geologists, who have
studied the behavior of earth
quakes for years, calmly state
that Stanford is long overdue
for a major earthquake, they
probably don't realize they have
frightened a considerable num
ber of non-geology majors.
What frightens the non-geolo
gy majors even more is the rela
tive unpredictability of an earth
quake. He is equally upset when
he reads that two minor shocks
last month, one of which rattled
coffee cups and shook windows
on the Stanford campus, wpre
caused by slippage exactly along
the trace of the 1906 fault break.
The 1906 earthquake, which
also caused disastrous fires in
San Francisco, shattered the
young Stanford campus.
Building: Codes Enforced
Since another earthquake has
always been a possibility, all
structures on the Stanford cam
pus have since 1940 conformed
to the minimum standards of
building codes of Santa Clara
County.

As geologists and seismolo
gists learn new facts from earth
quakes, these minimum require
ments are revised and brought
up to date.
Various older buildings on
campus, such as the Law School
and parts of Encina Hall, have
been remodeled and strengthen
ed against earthquakes.
In the central section of En
cina Hall, brick walls supported
wooden floors. Now, however,
much stronger steel columns sup
port reinforced concrete floors.
Plans are underway now for
similar remodeling of Jordan
Hall and the west wing of En
cina Hall. But much more re
mains to be done.
Dr. Burt Wells, professor
emeritus of civil engineering,
cited a number of buildings
which would probably take the
most damage in the wake of a
major earthquake.
"I would say that the one and
two story buildings around the
outer Quad which have not been
remodeled or strengthened —
for example, the geology, engi
neering, and history buildings —
would probably be most suscep

tible to damage. But I don't pre
dict they would collapse. They
would be damaged."
Indestructible?
Dr. Wells, who was living in
Palo Alto at the time of the
190G quake, made a study of Me
morial Church some years later
and wrote an earthquake report
on it. He believes that the re
built church would not be very
heavily damaged during a ma
jor earthquake. "On the whole,"
he said, "I think its a very stable
structure."
In 1913 Memorial Church was
rebuilt with a steel frame
around it. The walls have a 16-
inch concrete core reinforced
with steel bars running horizon
tally, vertically, and diagonally.
Each stone of the church is an
chored into this concrete core
with iron rods.
It has jokingly been said that
Hoover Tower, a tremendously
strong and well-designed build
ing, could be tipped over on its
side and not fall to pieces. A
steel frame surrounded by con
crete runs from the top of the
tower all the way down to Its
foundations.

"Wilbur and Stern Halls,"
commented Dr. Wells, "are rein
forced concrete buildings which
conform well to the building
code. About the only damage a
major earthquake might bring
would be broken windows and
cracked walls."
Dr. Wells also explained that
wood frame houses, such as the
new fraternity houses, as a rule,
do very well in earthquakes.
They are light in weight, and
the lighter a building is, the
less damage it is apt to receive.
Stanford's new, two-mile lin
ear accelerator is located only
one mile away from the 1906
break in the San Andreas fault.
When constructed, semi-auto
matic devices were built in to
allow realignment after an
earthquake.
Closing: A Gap
Present concentration in the
scientific prediction of earth
quakes is on the possibility of
giving 10 minute's to an hour's
warning of a major shock.
"Now this isn't going to help
anyone's building," says Dr.
Jahns, "but it certainly means
that you can empty out school

houses, auditoriums, and thea
ters. It could have a tremendous
influence on loss of life.
"It's a very sophisticated prob
lem. The best approaches right
now seem to be a very precise,
constant monitoring of the mag
netic field in the rocks on either
side of the fault.
"About half an hour to 45
minutes prior to a major earth
quake, there has been a unique
change in this magnetic field.
This looks like a major break
through in earthquake predic
tion.
Dr. Robert L. Kovach, associ
ate professor of geophysics at
Stanford, has been studying
these magnetic changes. "Th e
research up to now," he said,
"has proved fruitful and ex
tremely promising. It may even
hold the promise of developing
into a prediction capability."
"So, within a decade," Dr.
Jahns commented," we might
be able to predict an earthquake
10 minutes to the better part of
an hour in advance.
"And we might soon be able
to do some good on the other
end, like saying the chances are
60 per cent that we'll have a
major shock in such-an-such an
area within the next 10 years.
But there is gap here, and that's
what has to be closed."
The Fault Is Faults
Why do earthquakes happen?
When a portion of the earth's
crust is so strained as to crack
or tear and cause the rocks on
one side to slip past those on
the other, the plane along which
the slip occurs is called a fault.
California is interlaced with
hundreds of faults. The most
publicized is the 600-mile long
north-south San Andreas fault.
It was a horizontal slippage of
this fault which produced the
1906 quake.
Although many of California's
faults have long been inactive,
the San Andreas system is jump
ing. Geologists and scientists
are worrying about it, as shown
by the recent two-day confer
ence on Geologic Problems of
the San Andreas Fault System,
co-sponsored by the Stanford
school of earth sciences and the
U.S. geological survey of Menlo
Park.
Why Earthquakes?
In the universal ocean swims
a fish called the Chewa. It car
ries on its back a stone upon
which there is a cow, which car
ries the earth on one of Its

horns. When the cow becomes
weary and shifts the load to the
other horn, there is an earth
quake. Or so believed the Masa
wahilis tribe of East Africa.
Geologists, however, have dis
carded this theory in favor of
one they consider more logical.
Active faults are the source of
a majority of earthquakes.
Rocks in an active fault zone
are bing subjected to distorting
forces, the source of which still
puzzles scientists.
When these forces have dis
torted the rocks more than they
can endure, the rocks break.
Upon breaking ,the rocks re
bound into position that relieve
the strain. The energy released
generates vibrations, or earth
quakes.
Stanford Is Trapped
The Stanford campus is sand
wiched between two active faults
which run parallel to each oth
er: San Andreas and Hay ward
faults. Either could bring con
siderable damage to Stanford.
The Hayward fault, which is
east of Stanford, runs directly
beneath the rural town of Hol
lister, making it what scientists
call the "unofficial earthquake
capital of the nation." Sidewalks
in Hollister crawl, buckle, and
crack. Streets and surbs break
and buckle. Underground utility
pipes bend.
But Hollister's 6,500 inhabi
tants shrug it off. Apparently
no one has come up with a cure
for an active fault. And it's not
worth the trouble to move a
town, especially Hollister.
1906 Quake Closes Stanford
However, on April 18, 1906, a
47-second earthquake in the
early morning "moved" several
towns and inflicted enough dam
age to close the Stanford cam
pus for five months.
Though generally referred tb
as the "San Francisco quake,"
it did more actual destruction to
Stanford, Santa Rosa, and San
Jose. The main damage to San
Francisco came when the gas
mains broke and hundreds of
fires raged through the city.
A new library and a nearly
completed gymnasium on the
Stanford campus were ruined.
Memorial Church, dedicated only
three years earlier, had to be
leveled and rebuilt from the
ground up.
Outer Quad was still stand
ing, but numerous arches were
completely wrecked. Inner Quad
was slightly damaged. Ruined
beyond repair was Memorial

Arch, a 40-foot-high structure
which guarded the entrance to
the Quad. The total cost of re
construction was about $2.1 mil
lion.
Injuries to frame cottages and
fraternity houses were confined
to falling chimneys, wrecked
plaster, broken china, and over
turned furniture.
The earthquake killed two per
sons, one a student. Had the
shock occurred later in the day,
when classes were in session,
the deaths would have num
bered in the dozens.
Otto Gerdes, a fireman work
ing in the power plant, was
killed by a huge stone chimney
as he ran from the building.
But it was he who possibly
saved Stanford from a much
greater disaster by fire. Gerdes
closed the main electric power
switch as soon as the earth
quake struck, then ran outside
to his death.
Don't Run, Wait
In the event of an earthquake,
the most dangerous thing a per
son could do, according to John
M. Marston, fire chief and dis
aster coordinator would be to
run from the building he is in.
The horizontal movements
caused by earthquakes can eas
ily sling debris in all directions.
This is how Fireman Gerdes
died.
If inside a building when an
earthquake strikes, it is best to
remain inside and seek shelter
under a table or in a doorway.
Doorways are the strongest
parts of buildings and afford the
most protection.


QUAD AND QUAKE — Dr. Jahns looks over an arch on the Quad
which may prove unable to withstand any future earthquake in the
Stanford area. Dr. Jahns says most Stanford buildings will survive.

Upon breaking ,the rocks re
bound into position that relieve
the strain. The energy released
generates vibrations, or earth
quakes.
Stanford Is Trapped
The Stanford campus is sand
wiched between two active faults
which run parallel to each oth
er: San Andreas and Hay ward
faults. Either could bring con
siderable damage to Stanford.
The Hayward fault, which is
east of Stanford, runs directly
beneath the rural town of Hol
lister, making it what scientists
call the "unofficial earthquake
capital of the nation." Sidewalks
in Hollister crawl, buckle, and
crack. Streets and surbs break
and buckle. Underground utility
pipes bend.
But Hollister's 6,500 inhabi
tants shrug it off. Apparently
no one has come up with a cure
for an active fault. And it's not
worth the trouble to move a
town, especially Hollister.
1906 Quake Closes Stanford
However, on April 18, 1906, a
47-second earthquake in the
early morning "moved" several
towns and inflicted enough dam
age to close the Stanford cam
pus for five months.
Though generally referred tb
as the "San Francisco quake,"
it did more actual destruction to
Stanford, Santa Rosa, and San
Jose. The main damage to San
Francisco came when the gas
mains broke and hundreds of
fires raged through the city.
A new library and a nearly
completed gymnasium on the
Stanford campus were ruined.
Memorial Church, dedicated only
three years earlier, had to be
leveled and rebuilt from the
ground up.
Outer Quad was still stand
ing, but numerous arches were
completely wrecked. Inner Quad
was slightly damaged. Ruined
beyond repair was Memorial

Arch, a 40-foot-high structure
which guarded the entrance to
the Quad. The total cost of re
construction was about $2.1 mil
lion.
Injuries to frame cottages and
fraternity houses were confined
to falling chimneys, wrecked
plaster, broken china, and over
turned furniture.
The earthquake killed two per
sons, one a student. Had the
shock occurred later in the day,
when classes were in session,
the deaths would have num
bered in the dozens.
Otto Gerdes, a fireman work
ing in the power plant, was
killed by a huge stone chimney
as he ran from the building.
But it was he who possibly
saved Stanford from a much
greater disaster by fire. Gerdes
closed the main electric power
switch as soon as the earth
quake struck, then ran outside
to his death.
Don't Run, Wait
In the event of an earthquake,
the most dangerous thing a per
son could do, according to John
M. Marston, fire chief and dis
aster coordinator would be to
run from the building he is in.
The horizontal movements
caused by earthquakes can eas
ily sling debris in all directions.
This is how Fireman Gerdes
died.
If inside a building when an
earthquake strikes, it is best to
remain inside and seek shelter
under a table or in a doorway.
Doorways are the strongest
parts of buildings and afford the
most protection.


QUAD AND QUAKE — Dr. Jahns looks over an arch on the Quad
which may prove unable to withstand any future earthquake in the
Stanford area. Dr. Jahns says most Stanford buildings will survive.
Stanford's second major earth
quake is on its way. It could be
as destructive as the 1906 shock,
but scientists might be able to
give from 10 minutes' to an
hour's warning before it strikes.
Ninety per cent of the earth
quakes in the United States oc
cur in California, but only one
in 10,000 does any amount of
damage. Some experts says this
"l-in-10,000" quake is just
around the corner.
"Without knowing exactly
when, we can say that between
now and the year 2000 Califor
nia and adjoining areas will
have many moderate earth
quakes, a few severe ones, and
perhaps one great one," said
Louis C. Pakiser, chief of the
U.S. Geological Survey's Nation
al Center for Earthquake Re
search in Menlo Park.
Dr. Richard Jahns, dean of the
Stanford School of Earth Scien
ces, agrees. "I don't think there
is any doubt that the Ray Area
is overdue, in a statistical sense,
for a major earthquake. Every
thing we know about the San
Andreas fault suggests that

twice a century, on the average,
you can expect a major shock.
On this basis, we're overdue.
When geologists, who have
studied the behavior of earth
quakes for years, calmly state
that Stanford is long overdue
for a major earthquake, they
probably don't realize they have
frightened a considerable num
ber of non-geology majors.
What frightens the non-geolo
gy majors even more is the rela
tive unpredictability of an earth
quake. He is equally upset when
he reads that two minor shocks
last month, one of which rattled
coffee cups and shook windows
on the Stanford campus, wpre
caused by slippage exactly along
the trace of the 1906 fault break.
The 1906 earthquake, which
also caused disastrous fires in
San Francisco, shattered the
young Stanford campus.
Building: Codes Enforced
Since another earthquake has
always been a possibility, all
structures on the Stanford cam
pus have since 1940 conformed
to the minimum standards of
building codes of Santa Clara
County.

As geologists and seismolo
gists learn new facts from earth
quakes, these minimum require
ments are revised and brought
up to date.
Various older buildings on
campus, such as the Law School
and parts of Encina Hall, have
been remodeled and strengthen
ed against earthquakes.
In the central section of En
cina Hall, brick walls supported
wooden floors. Now, however,
much stronger steel columns sup
port reinforced concrete floors.
Plans are underway now for
similar remodeling of Jordan
Hall and the west wing of En
cina Hall. But much more re
mains to be done.
Dr. Burt Wells, professor
emeritus of civil engineering,
cited a number of buildings
which would probably take the
most damage in the wake of a
major earthquake.
"I would say that the one and
two story buildings around the
outer Quad which have not been
remodeled or strengthened —
for example, the geology, engi
neering, and history buildings —
would probably be most suscep

tible to damage. But I don't pre
dict they would collapse. They
would be damaged."
Indestructible?
Dr. Wells, who was living in
Palo Alto at the time of the
190G quake, made a study of Me
morial Church some years later
and wrote an earthquake report
on it. He believes that the re
built church would not be very
heavily damaged during a ma
jor earthquake. "On the whole,"
he said, "I think its a very stable
structure."
In 1913 Memorial Church was
rebuilt with a steel frame
around it. The walls have a 16-
inch concrete core reinforced
with steel bars running horizon
tally, vertically, and diagonally.
Each stone of the church is an
chored into this concrete core
with iron rods.
It has jokingly been said that
Hoover Tower, a tremendously
strong and well-designed build
ing, could be tipped over on its
side and not fall to pieces. A
steel frame surrounded by con
crete runs from the top of the
tower all the way down to Its
foundations.

"Wilbur and Stern Halls,"
commented Dr. Wells, "are rein
forced concrete buildings which
conform well to the building
code. About the only damage a
major earthquake might bring
would be broken windows and
cracked walls."
Dr. Wells also explained that
wood frame houses, such as the
new fraternity houses, as a rule,
do very well in earthquakes.
They are light in weight, and
the lighter a building is, the
less damage it is apt to receive.
Stanford's new, two-mile lin
ear accelerator is located only
one mile away from the 1906
break in the San Andreas fault.
When constructed, semi-auto
matic devices were built in to
allow realignment after an
earthquake.
Closing: A Gap
Present concentration in the
scientific prediction of earth
quakes is on the possibility of
giving 10 minute's to an hour's
warning of a major shock.
"Now this isn't going to help
anyone's building," says Dr.
Jahns, "but it certainly means
that you can empty out school


EARTHQUAKE: Memorial Church after IfKMt quake
houses, auditoriums, and thea
ters. It could have a tremendous
influence on loss of life.
"It's a very sophisticated prob
lem. The best approaches right
now seem to be a very precise,
constant monitoring of the mag
netic field in the rocks on either
side of the fault.
"About half an hour to 45
minutes prior to a major earth
quake, there has been a unique
change in this magnetic field.
This looks like a major break
through in earthquake predic
tion.
Dr. Robert L. Kovach, associ
ate professor of geophysics at
Stanford, has been studying
these magnetic changes. "Th e
research up to now," he said,
"has proved fruitful and ex
tremely promising. It may even
hold the promise of developing
into a prediction capability."
"So, within a decade," Dr.
Jahns commented," we might
be able to predict an earthquake
10 minutes to the better part of
an hour in advance.
"And we might soon be able
to do some good on the other
end, like saying the chances are
60 per cent that we'll have a
major shock in such-an-such an
area within the next 10 years.
But there is gap here, and that's
what has to be closed."
The Fault Is Faults
Why do earthquakes happen?
When a portion of the earth's
crust is so strained as to crack
or tear and cause the rocks on
one side to slip past those on
the other, the plane along which
the slip occurs is called a fault.
California is interlaced with
hundreds of faults. The most
publicized is the 600-mile long
north-south San Andreas fault.
It was a horizontal slippage of
this fault which produced the
1906 quake.
Although many of California's
faults have long been inactive,
the San Andreas system is jump
ing. Geologists and scientists
are worrying about it, as shown
by the recent two-day confer
ence on Geologic Problems of
the San Andreas Fault System,
co-sponsored by the Stanford
school of earth sciences and the
U.S. geological survey of Menlo
Park.
Why Earthquakes?
In the universal ocean swims
a fish called the Chewa. It car
ries on its back a stone upon
which there is a cow, which car
ries the earth on one of Its

horns. When the cow becomes
weary and shifts the load to the
other horn, there is an earth
quake. Or so believed the Masa
wahilis tribe of East Africa.
Geologists, however, have dis
carded this theory in favor of
one they consider more logical.
Active faults are the source of
a majority of earthquakes.
Rocks in an active fault zone
are bing subjected to distorting
forces, the source of which still
puzzles scientists.
When these forces have dis
torted the rocks more than they
can endure, the rocks break.
Upon breaking ,the rocks re
bound into position that relieve
the strain. The energy released
generates vibrations, or earth
quakes.

The Fault Is Faults
Why do earthquakes happen?
When a portion of the earth's
crust is so strained as to crack
or tear and cause the rocks on
one side to slip past those on
the other, the plane along which
the slip occurs is called a fault.
California is interlaced with
hundreds of faults. The most
publicized is the 600-mile long
north-south San Andreas fault.
It was a horizontal slippage of
this fault which produced the
1906 quake.
Although many of California's
faults have long been inactive,
the San Andreas system is jump
ing. Geologists and scientists
are worrying about it, as shown
by the recent two-day confer
ence on Geologic Problems of
the San Andreas Fault System,
co-sponsored by the Stanford
school of earth sciences and the
U.S. geological survey of Menlo
Park.
Why Earthquakes?
In the universal ocean swims
a fish called the Chewa. It car
ries on its back a stone upon
which there is a cow, which car
ries the earth on one of Its

horns. When the cow becomes
weary and shifts the load to the
other horn, there is an earth
quake. Or so believed the Masa
wahilis tribe of East Africa.
Geologists, however, have dis
carded this theory in favor of
one they consider more logical.
Active faults are the source of
a majority of earthquakes.
Rocks in an active fault zone
are bing subjected to distorting
forces, the source of which still
puzzles scientists.
When these forces have dis
torted the rocks more than they
can endure, the rocks break.
Upon breaking ,the rocks re
bound into position that relieve
the strain. The energy released
generates vibrations, or earth
quakes.
Stanford Is Trapped
The Stanford campus is sand
wiched between two active faults
which run parallel to each oth
er: San Andreas and Hay ward
faults. Either could bring con
siderable damage to Stanford.
The Hayward fault, which is
east of Stanford, runs directly
beneath the rural town of Hol
lister, making it what scientists
call the "unofficial earthquake
capital of the nation." Sidewalks
in Hollister crawl, buckle, and
crack. Streets and surbs break
and buckle. Underground utility
pipes bend.
But Hollister's 6,500 inhabi
tants shrug it off. Apparently
no one has come up with a cure
for an active fault. And it's not
worth the trouble to move a
town, especially Hollister.
1906 Quake Closes Stanford
However, on April 18, 1906, a
47-second earthquake in the
early morning "moved" several
towns and inflicted enough dam
age to close the Stanford cam
pus for five months.
Though generally referred tb
as the "San Francisco quake,"
it did more actual destruction to
Stanford, Santa Rosa, and San
Jose. The main damage to San
Francisco came when the gas
mains broke and hundreds of
fires raged through the city.
A new library and a nearly
completed gymnasium on the
Stanford campus were ruined.
Memorial Church, dedicated only
three years earlier, had to be
leveled and rebuilt from the
ground up.
Outer Quad was still stand
ing, but numerous arches were
completely wrecked. Inner Quad
was slightly damaged. Ruined
beyond repair was Memorial

Arch, a 40-foot-high structure
which guarded the entrance to
the Quad. The total cost of re
construction was about $2.1 mil
lion.
Injuries to frame cottages and
fraternity houses were confined
to falling chimneys, wrecked
plaster, broken china, and over
turned furniture.
The earthquake killed two per
sons, one a student. Had the
shock occurred later in the day,
when classes were in session,
the deaths would have num
bered in the dozens.
Otto Gerdes, a fireman work
ing in the power plant, was
killed by a huge stone chimney
as he ran from the building.
But it was he who possibly
saved Stanford from a much
greater disaster by fire. Gerdes
closed the main electric power
switch as soon as the earth
quake struck, then ran outside
to his death.
Don't Run, Wait
In the event of an earthquake,
the most dangerous thing a per
son could do, according to John
M. Marston, fire chief and dis
aster coordinator would be to
run from the building he is in.
The horizontal movements
caused by earthquakes can eas
ily sling debris in all directions.
This is how Fireman Gerdes
died.
If inside a building when an
earthquake strikes, it is best to
remain inside and seek shelter
under a table or in a doorway.
Doorways are the strongest
parts of buildings and afford the
most protection.


QUAD AND QUAKE — Dr. Jahns looks over an arch on the Quad
which may prove unable to withstand any future earthquake in the
Stanford area. Dr. Jahns says most Stanford buildings will survive.
Stanford's second major earth
quake is on its way. It could be
as destructive as the 1906 shock,
but scientists might be able to
give from 10 minutes' to an
hour's warning before it strikes.
Ninety per cent of the earth
quakes in the United States oc
cur in California, but only one
in 10,000 does any amount of
damage. Some experts says this
"l-in-10,000" quake is just
around the corner.
"Without knowing exactly
when, we can say that between
now and the year 2000 Califor
nia and adjoining areas will
have many moderate earth
quakes, a few severe ones, and
perhaps one great one," said
Louis C. Pakiser, chief of the
U.S. Geological Survey's Nation
al Center for Earthquake Re
search in Menlo Park.
Dr. Richard Jahns, dean of the
Stanford School of Earth Scien
ces, agrees. "I don't think there
is any doubt that the Ray Area
is overdue, in a statistical sense,
for a major earthquake. Every
thing we know about the San
Andreas fault suggests that

twice a century, on the average,
you can expect a major shock.
On this basis, we're overdue.
When geologists, who have
studied the behavior of earth
quakes for years, calmly state
that Stanford is long overdue
for a major earthquake, they
probably don't realize they have
frightened a considerable num
ber of non-geology majors.
What frightens the non-geolo
gy majors even more is the rela
tive unpredictability of an earth
quake. He is equally upset when
he reads that two minor shocks
last month, one of which rattled
coffee cups and shook windows
on the Stanford campus, wpre
caused by slippage exactly along
the trace of the 1906 fault break.
The 1906 earthquake, which
also caused disastrous fires in
San Francisco, shattered the
young Stanford campus.
Building: Codes Enforced
Since another earthquake has
always been a possibility, all
structures on the Stanford cam
pus have since 1940 conformed
to the minimum standards of
building codes of Santa Clara
County.

As geologists and seismolo
gists learn new facts from earth
quakes, these minimum require
ments are revised and brought
up to date.
Various older buildings on
campus, such as the Law School
and parts of Encina Hall, have
been remodeled and strengthen
ed against earthquakes.
In the central section of En
cina Hall, brick walls supported
wooden floors. Now, however,
much stronger steel columns sup
port reinforced concrete floors.
Plans are underway now for
similar remodeling of Jordan
Hall and the west wing of En
cina Hall. But much more re
mains to be done.
Dr. Burt Wells, professor
emeritus of civil engineering,
cited a number of buildings
which would probably take the
most damage in the wake of a
major earthquake.
"I would say that the one and
two story buildings around the
outer Quad which have not been
remodeled or strengthened —
for example, the geology, engi
neering, and history buildings —
would probably be most suscep

tible to damage. But I don't pre
dict they would collapse. They
would be damaged."
Indestructible?
Dr. Wells, who was living in
Palo Alto at the time of the
190G quake, made a study of Me
morial Church some years later
and wrote an earthquake report
on it. He believes that the re
built church would not be very
heavily damaged during a ma
jor earthquake. "On the whole,"
he said, "I think its a very stable
structure."
In 1913 Memorial Church was
rebuilt with a steel frame
around it. The walls have a 16-
inch concrete core reinforced
with steel bars running horizon
tally, vertically, and diagonally.
Each stone of the church is an
chored into this concrete core
with iron rods.
It has jokingly been said that
Hoover Tower, a tremendously
strong and well-designed build
ing, could be tipped over on its
side and not fall to pieces. A
steel frame surrounded by con
crete runs from the top of the
tower all the way down to Its
foundations.

"Wilbur and Stern Halls,"
commented Dr. Wells, "are rein
forced concrete buildings which
conform well to the building
code. About the only damage a
major earthquake might bring
would be broken windows and
cracked walls."
Dr. Wells also explained that
wood frame houses, such as the
new fraternity houses, as a rule,
do very well in earthquakes.
They are light in weight, and
the lighter a building is, the
less damage it is apt to receive.
Stanford's new, two-mile lin
ear accelerator is located only
one mile away from the 1906
break in the San Andreas fault.
When constructed, semi-auto
matic devices were built in to
allow realignment after an
earthquake.

The 1906 earthquake, which
also caused disastrous fires in
San Francisco, shattered the
young Stanford campus.
Building: Codes Enforced
Since another earthquake has
always been a possibility, all
structures on the Stanford cam
pus have since 1940 conformed
to the minimum standards of
building codes of Santa Clara
County.

As geologists and seismolo
gists learn new facts from earth
quakes, these minimum require
ments are revised and brought
up to date.
Various older buildings on
campus, such as the Law School
and parts of Encina Hall, have
been remodeled and strengthen
ed against earthquakes.
In the central section of En
cina Hall, brick walls supported
wooden floors. Now, however,
much stronger steel columns sup
port reinforced concrete floors.
Plans are underway now for
similar remodeling of Jordan
Hall and the west wing of En
cina Hall. But much more re
mains to be done.
Dr. Burt Wells, professor
emeritus of civil engineering,
cited a number of buildings
which would probably take the
most damage in the wake of a
major earthquake.
"I would say that the one and
two story buildings around the
outer Quad which have not been
remodeled or strengthened —
for example, the geology, engi
neering, and history buildings —
would probably be most suscep

tible to damage. But I don't pre
dict they would collapse. They
would be damaged."
Indestructible?
Dr. Wells, who was living in
Palo Alto at the time of the
190G quake, made a study of Me
morial Church some years later
and wrote an earthquake report
on it. He believes that the re
built church would not be very
heavily damaged during a ma
jor earthquake. "On the whole,"
he said, "I think its a very stable
structure."
In 1913 Memorial Church was
rebuilt with a steel frame
around it. The walls have a 16-
inch concrete core reinforced
with steel bars running horizon
tally, vertically, and diagonally.
Each stone of the church is an
chored into this concrete core
with iron rods.
It has jokingly been said that
Hoover Tower, a tremendously
strong and well-designed build
ing, could be tipped over on its
side and not fall to pieces. A
steel frame surrounded by con
crete runs from the top of the
tower all the way down to Its
foundations.

"Wilbur and Stern Halls,"
commented Dr. Wells, "are rein
forced concrete buildings which
conform well to the building
code. About the only damage a
major earthquake might bring
would be broken windows and
cracked walls."
Dr. Wells also explained that
wood frame houses, such as the
new fraternity houses, as a rule,
do very well in earthquakes.
They are light in weight, and
the lighter a building is, the
less damage it is apt to receive.
Stanford's new, two-mile lin
ear accelerator is located only
one mile away from the 1906
break in the San Andreas fault.
When constructed, semi-auto
matic devices were built in to
allow realignment after an
earthquake.
Closing: A Gap
Present concentration in the
scientific prediction of earth
quakes is on the possibility of
giving 10 minute's to an hour's
warning of a major shock.
"Now this isn't going to help
anyone's building," says Dr.
Jahns, "but it certainly means
that you can empty out school

houses, auditoriums, and thea
ters. It could have a tremendous
influence on loss of life.
"It's a very sophisticated prob
lem. The best approaches right
now seem to be a very precise,
constant monitoring of the mag
netic field in the rocks on either
side of the fault.
"About half an hour to 45
minutes prior to a major earth
quake, there has been a unique
change in this magnetic field.
This looks like a major break
through in earthquake predic
tion.
Dr. Robert L. Kovach, associ
ate professor of geophysics at
Stanford, has been studying
these magnetic changes. "Th e
research up to now," he said,
"has proved fruitful and ex
tremely promising. It may even
hold the promise of developing
into a prediction capability."
"So, within a decade," Dr.
Jahns commented," we might
be able to predict an earthquake
10 minutes to the better part of
an hour in advance.
"And we might soon be able
to do some good on the other
end, like saying the chances are
60 per cent that we'll have a
major shock in such-an-such an
area within the next 10 years.
But there is gap here, and that's
what has to be closed."
The Fault Is Faults
Why do earthquakes happen?
When a portion of the earth's
crust is so strained as to crack
or tear and cause the rocks on
one side to slip past those on
the other, the plane along which
the slip occurs is called a fault.
California is interlaced with
hundreds of faults. The most
publicized is the 600-mile long
north-south San Andreas fault.
It was a horizontal slippage of
this fault which produced the
1906 quake.
Although many of California's
faults have long been inactive,
the San Andreas system is jump
ing. Geologists and scientists
are worrying about it, as shown
by the recent two-day confer
ence on Geologic Problems of
the San Andreas Fault System,
co-sponsored by the Stanford
school of earth sciences and the
U.S. geological survey of Menlo
Park.
Why Earthquakes?
In the universal ocean swims
a fish called the Chewa. It car
ries on its back a stone upon
which there is a cow, which car
ries the earth on one of Its

horns. When the cow becomes
weary and shifts the load to the
other horn, there is an earth
quake. Or so believed the Masa
wahilis tribe of East Africa.
Geologists, however, have dis
carded this theory in favor of
one they consider more logical.
Active faults are the source of
a majority of earthquakes.
Rocks in an active fault zone
are bing subjected to distorting
forces, the source of which still
puzzles scientists.
When these forces have dis
torted the rocks more than they
can endure, the rocks break.
Upon breaking ,the rocks re
bound into position that relieve
the strain. The energy released
generates vibrations, or earth
quakes.
Stanford Is Trapped
The Stanford campus is sand
wiched between two active faults
which run parallel to each oth
er: San Andreas and Hay ward
faults. Either could bring con
siderable damage to Stanford.
The Hayward fault, which is
east of Stanford, runs directly
beneath the rural town of Hol
lister, making it what scientists
call the "unofficial earthquake
capital of the nation." Sidewalks
in Hollister crawl, buckle, and
crack. Streets and surbs break
and buckle. Underground utility
pipes bend.
But Hollister's 6,500 inhabi
tants shrug it off. Apparently
no one has come up with a cure
for an active fault. And it's not
worth the trouble to move a
town, especially Hollister.
1906 Quake Closes Stanford
However, on April 18, 1906, a
47-second earthquake in the
early morning "moved" several
towns and inflicted enough dam
age to close the Stanford cam
pus for five months.
Though generally referred tb
as the "San Francisco quake,"
it did more actual destruction to
Stanford, Santa Rosa, and San
Jose. The main damage to San
Francisco came when the gas
mains broke and hundreds of
fires raged through the city.
A new library and a nearly
completed gymnasium on the
Stanford campus were ruined.
Memorial Church, dedicated only
three years earlier, had to be
leveled and rebuilt from the
ground up.
Outer Quad was still stand
ing, but numerous arches were
completely wrecked. Inner Quad
was slightly damaged. Ruined
beyond repair was Memorial

Arch, a 40-foot-high structure
which guarded the entrance to
the Quad. The total cost of re
construction was about $2.1 mil
lion.
Injuries to frame cottages and
fraternity houses were confined
to falling chimneys, wrecked
plaster, broken china, and over
turned furniture.
The earthquake killed two per
sons, one a student. Had the
shock occurred later in the day,
when classes were in session,
the deaths would have num
bered in the dozens.
Otto Gerdes, a fireman work
ing in the power plant, was
killed by a huge stone chimney
as he ran from the building.
But it was he who possibly
saved Stanford from a much
greater disaster by fire. Gerdes
closed the main electric power
switch as soon as the earth
quake struck, then ran outside
to his death.
Don't Run, Wait
In the event of an earthquake,
the most dangerous thing a per
son could do, according to John
M. Marston, fire chief and dis
aster coordinator would be to
run from the building he is in.
The horizontal movements
caused by earthquakes can eas
ily sling debris in all directions.
This is how Fireman Gerdes
died.
If inside a building when an
earthquake strikes, it is best to
remain inside and seek shelter
under a table or in a doorway.
Doorways are the strongest
parts of buildings and afford the
most protection.


QUAD AND QUAKE — Dr. Jahns looks over an arch on the Quad
which may prove unable to withstand any future earthquake in the
Stanford area. Dr. Jahns says most Stanford buildings will survive.
Stanford's second major earth
quake is on its way. It could be
as destructive as the 1906 shock,
but scientists might be able to
give from 10 minutes' to an
hour's warning before it strikes.
Ninety per cent of the earth
quakes in the United States oc
cur in California, but only one
in 10,000 does any amount of
damage. Some experts says this
"l-in-10,000" quake is just
around the corner.
"Without knowing exactly
when, we can say that between
now and the year 2000 Califor
nia and adjoining areas will
have many moderate earth
quakes, a few severe ones, and
perhaps one great one," said
Louis C. Pakiser, chief of the
U.S. Geological Survey's Nation
al Center for Earthquake Re
search in Menlo Park.
Dr. Richard Jahns, dean of the
Stanford School of Earth Scien
ces, agrees. "I don't think there
is any doubt that the Ray Area
is overdue, in a statistical sense,
for a major earthquake. Every
thing we know about the San
Andreas fault suggests that

twice a century, on the average,
you can expect a major shock.
On this basis, we're overdue.
When geologists, who have
studied the behavior of earth
quakes for years, calmly state
that Stanford is long overdue
for a major earthquake, they
probably don't realize they have
frightened a considerable num
ber of non-geology majors.
What frightens the non-geolo
gy majors even more is the rela
tive unpredictability of an earth
quake. He is equally upset when
he reads that two minor shocks

Arch, a 40-foot-high structure
which guarded the entrance to
the Quad. The total cost of re
construction was about $2.1 mil
lion.
Injuries to frame cottages and
fraternity houses were confined
to falling chimneys, wrecked
plaster, broken china, and over
turned furniture.
The earthquake killed two per
sons, one a student. Had the
shock occurred later in the day,
when classes were in session,
the deaths would have num
bered in the dozens.
Otto Gerdes, a fireman work
ing in the power plant, was
killed by a huge stone chimney
as he ran from the building.
But it was he who possibly
saved Stanford from a much
greater disaster by fire. Gerdes
closed the main electric power
switch as soon as the earth
quake struck, then ran outside
to his death.
Don't Run, Wait
In the event of an earthquake,
the most dangerous thing a per
son could do, according to John
M. Marston, fire chief and dis
aster coordinator would be to
run from the building he is in.
The horizontal movements
caused by earthquakes can eas
ily sling debris in all directions.
This is how Fireman Gerdes
died.
If inside a building when an
earthquake strikes, it is best to
remain inside and seek shelter
under a table or in a doorway.
Doorways are the strongest
parts of buildings and afford the
most protection.


QUAD AND QUAKE — Dr. Jahns looks over an arch on the Quad
which may prove unable to withstand any future earthquake in the
Stanford area. Dr. Jahns says most Stanford buildings will survive.
Stanford's second major earth
quake is on its way. It could be
as destructive as the 1906 shock,
but scientists might be able to
give from 10 minutes' to an
hour's warning before it strikes.
Ninety per cent of the earth
quakes in the United States oc
cur in California, but only one
in 10,000 does any amount of
damage. Some experts says this
"l-in-10,000" quake is just
around the corner.
"Without knowing exactly
when, we can say that between
now and the year 2000 Califor
nia and adjoining areas will
have many moderate earth
quakes, a few severe ones, and
perhaps one great one," said
Louis C. Pakiser, chief of the
U.S. Geological Survey's Nation
al Center for Earthquake Re
search in Menlo Park.
Dr. Richard Jahns, dean of the
Stanford School of Earth Scien
ces, agrees. "I don't think there
is any doubt that the Ray Area
is overdue, in a statistical sense,
for a major earthquake. Every
thing we know about the San
Andreas fault suggests that

twice a century, on the average,
you can expect a major shock.
On this basis, we're overdue.
When geologists, who have
studied the behavior of earth
quakes for years, calmly state
that Stanford is long overdue
for a major earthquake, they
probably don't realize they have
frightened a considerable num
ber of non-geology majors.
What frightens the non-geolo
gy majors even more is the rela
tive unpredictability of an earth
quake. He is equally upset when
he reads that two minor shocks
last month, one of which rattled
coffee cups and shook windows
on the Stanford campus, wpre
caused by slippage exactly along
the trace of the 1906 fault break.
The 1906 earthquake, which
also caused disastrous fires in
San Francisco, shattered the
young Stanford campus.
Building: Codes Enforced
Since another earthquake has
always been a possibility, all
structures on the Stanford cam
pus have since 1940 conformed
to the minimum standards of
building codes of Santa Clara
County.

As geologists and seismolo
gists learn new facts from earth
quakes, these minimum require
ments are revised and brought
up to date.
Various older buildings on
campus, such as the Law School
and parts of Encina Hall, have
been remodeled and strengthen
ed against earthquakes.
In the central section of En
cina Hall, brick walls supported
wooden floors. Now, however,
much stronger steel columns sup
port reinforced concrete floors.
Plans are underway now for
similar remodeling of Jordan
Hall and the west wing of En
cina Hall. But much more re
mains to be done.
Dr. Burt Wells, professor
emeritus of civil engineering,
cited a number of buildings
which would probably take the
most damage in the wake of a
major earthquake.
"I would say that the one and
two story buildings around the
outer Quad which have not been
remodeled or strengthened —
for example, the geology, engi
neering, and history buildings —
would probably be most suscep

tible to damage. But I don't pre
dict they would collapse. They
would be damaged."
Indestructible?
Dr. Wells, who was living in
Palo Alto at the time of the
190G quake, made a study of Me
morial Church some years later
and wrote an earthquake report
on it. He believes that the re
built church would not be very
heavily damaged during a ma
jor earthquake. "On the whole,"
he said, "I think its a very stable
structure."
In 1913 Memorial Church was
rebuilt with a steel frame
around it. The walls have a 16-
inch concrete core reinforced
with steel bars running horizon
tally, vertically, and diagonally.
Each stone of the church is an
chored into this concrete core
with iron rods.
It has jokingly been said that
Hoover Tower, a tremendously
strong and well-designed build
ing, could be tipped over on its
side and not fall to pieces. A
steel frame surrounded by con
crete runs from the top of the
tower all the way down to Its
foundations.

"Wilbur and Stern Halls,"
commented Dr. Wells, "are rein
forced concrete buildings which
conform well to the building
code. About the only damage a
major earthquake might bring
would be broken windows and
cracked walls."
Dr. Wells also explained that
wood frame houses, such as the
new fraternity houses, as a rule,
do very well in earthquakes.
They are light in weight, and
the lighter a building is, the
less damage it is apt to receive.
Stanford's new, two-mile lin
ear accelerator is located only
one mile away from the 1906
break in the San Andreas fault.
When constructed, semi-auto
matic devices were built in to
allow realignment after an
earthquake.
Closing: A Gap
Present concentration in the
scientific prediction of earth
quakes is on the possibility of
giving 10 minute's to an hour's
warning of a major shock.
"Now this isn't going to help
anyone's building," says Dr.
Jahns, "but it certainly means
that you can empty out school

houses, auditoriums, and thea

influence on loss of life.
"It's a very sophisticated prob

now seem to be a very precise,
constant monitoring of the mag
netic field in the rocks on either
side of the fault.
"About half an hour to 45
minutes prior to a major earth
quake, there has been a unique
change in this magnetic field.
This looks like a major break

tion.
Dr. Robert L. Kovach, associ
ate professor of geophysics at
Stanford, has been studying
these magnetic changes. "Th e
research up to now," he said,
"has proved fruitful and ex
tremely promising. It may even
hold the promise of developing
into a prediction capability."
"So, within a decade," Dr.
Jahns commented," we might
be able to predict an earthquake
10 minutes to the better part of
an hour in advance.
"And we might soon be able
to do some good on the other
end, like saying the chances are
60 per cent that we'll have a
major shock in such-an-such an
area within the next 10 years.
But there is gap here, and that's
what has to be closed."
The Fault Is Faults
Why do earthquakes happen?
When a portion of the earth's
crust is so strained as to crack
or tear and cause the rocks on
one side to slip past those on
the other, the plane along which
the slip occurs is called a fault.
California is interlaced with
hundreds of faults. The most
publicized is the 600-mile long
north-south San Andreas fault.
It was a horizontal slippage of
this fault which produced the
1906 quake.
Although many of California's
faults have long been inactive,
the San Andreas system is jump
ing. Geologists and scientists
are worrying about it, as shown
by the recent two-day confer
ence on Geologic Problems of
the San Andreas Fault System,
co-sponsored by the Stanford
school of earth sciences and the
U.S. geological survey of Menlo
Park.
Why Earthquakes?
In the universal ocean swims
a fish called the Chewa. It car
ries on its back a stone upon
which there is a cow, which car
ries the earth on one of Its

horns. When the cow becomes
weary and shifts the load to the
other horn, there is an earth
quake. Or so believed the Masa
wahilis tribe of East Africa.
Geologists, however, have dis
carded this theory in favor of
one they consider more logical.
Active faults are the source of
a majority of earthquakes.
Rocks in an active fault zone
are bing subjected to distorting
forces, the source of which still
puzzles scientists.
When these forces have dis
torted the rocks more than they
can endure, the rocks break.
Upon breaking ,the rocks re
bound into position that relieve
the strain. The energy released
generates vibrations, or earth
quakes.
Stanford Is Trapped
The Stanford campus is sand
wiched between two active faults
which run parallel to each oth
er: San Andreas and Hay ward
faults. Either could bring con
siderable damage to Stanford.
The Hayward fault, which is
east of Stanford, runs directly
beneath the rural town of Hol
lister, making it what scientists
call the "unofficial earthquake
capital of the nation." Sidewalks
in Hollister crawl, buckle, and
crack. Streets and surbs break
and buckle. Underground utility
pipes bend.
But Hollister's 6,500 inhabi
tants shrug it off. Apparently
no one has come up with a cure
for an active fault. And it's not
worth the trouble to move a
town, especially Hollister.
1906 Quake Closes Stanford
However, on April 18, 1906, a
47-second earthquake in the
early morning "moved" several
towns and inflicted enough dam
age to close the Stanford cam
pus for five months.
Though generally referred tb
as the "San Francisco quake,"
it did more actual destruction to
Stanford, Santa Rosa, and San
Jose. The main damage to San
Francisco came when the gas
mains broke and hundreds of
fires raged through the city.
A new library and a nearly
completed gymnasium on the
Stanford campus were ruined.
Memorial Church, dedicated only
three years earlier, had to be
leveled and rebuilt from the
ground up.
Outer Quad was still stand
ing, but numerous arches were
completely wrecked. Inner Quad
was slightly damaged. Ruined
beyond repair was Memorial

Arch, a 40-foot-high structure
which guarded the entrance to
the Quad. The total cost of re
construction was about $2.1 mil
lion.
Injuries to frame cottages and
fraternity houses were confined
to falling chimneys, wrecked
plaster, broken china, and over

When a portion of the earth's
crust is so strained as to crack
or tear and cause the rocks on
one side to slip past those on
the other, the plane along which
the slip occurs is called a fault.
California is interlaced with
hundreds of faults. The most
publicized is the 600-mile long
north-south San Andreas fault.
It was a horizontal slippage of
this fault which produced the
1906 quake.
Although many of California's
faults have long been inactive,
the San Andreas system is jump
ing. Geologists and scientists
are worrying about it, as shown
by the recent two-day confer
ence on Geologic Problems of
the San Andreas Fault System,
co-sponsored by the Stanford
school of earth sciences and the
U.S. geological survey of Menlo
Park.
Why Earthquakes?
In the universal ocean swims
a fish called the Chewa. It car
ries on its back a stone upon
which there is a cow, which car
ries the earth on one of Its

horns. When the cow becomes
weary and shifts the load to the
other horn, there is an earth
quake. Or so believed the Masa
wahilis tribe of East Africa.
Geologists, however, have dis
carded this theory in favor of
one they consider more logical.
Active faults are the source of
a majority of earthquakes.
Rocks in an active fault zone
are bing subjected to distorting
forces, the source of which still
puzzles scientists.
When these forces have dis
torted the rocks more than they
can endure, the rocks break.
Upon breaking ,the rocks re
bound into position that relieve
the strain. The energy released
generates vibrations, or earth
quakes.
Stanford Is Trapped
The Stanford campus is sand
wiched between two active faults
which run parallel to each oth
er: San Andreas and Hay ward
faults. Either could bring con
siderable damage to Stanford.
The Hayward fault, which is
east of Stanford, runs directly
beneath the rural town of Hol
lister, making it what scientists
call the "unofficial earthquake
capital of the nation." Sidewalks
in Hollister crawl, buckle, and
crack. Streets and surbs break
and buckle. Underground utility
pipes bend.
But Hollister's 6,500 inhabi
tants shrug it off. Apparently
no one has come up with a cure
for an active fault. And it's not
worth the trouble to move a
town, especially Hollister.
1906 Quake Closes Stanford
However, on April 18, 1906, a
47-second earthquake in the
early morning "moved" several
towns and inflicted enough dam
age to close the Stanford cam
pus for five months.
Though generally referred tb
as the "San Francisco quake,"
it did more actual destruction to
Stanford, Santa Rosa, and San
Jose. The main damage to San
Francisco came when the gas
mains broke and hundreds of
fires raged through the city.
A new library and a nearly
completed gymnasium on the
Stanford campus were ruined.
Memorial Church, dedicated only
three years earlier, had to be
leveled and rebuilt from the
ground up.
Outer Quad was still stand
ing, but numerous arches were
completely wrecked. Inner Quad
was slightly damaged. Ruined
beyond repair was Memorial

Arch, a 40-foot-high structure
which guarded the entrance to
the Quad. The total cost of re
construction was about $2.1 mil
lion.
Injuries to frame cottages and
fraternity houses were confined
to falling chimneys, wrecked
plaster, broken china, and over
turned furniture.
The earthquake killed two per
sons, one a student. Had the
shock occurred later in the day,
when classes were in session,
the deaths would have num
bered in the dozens.
Otto Gerdes, a fireman work
ing in the power plant, was
killed by a huge stone chimney
as he ran from the building.
But it was he who possibly
saved Stanford from a much
greater disaster by fire. Gerdes
closed the main electric power
switch as soon as the earth
quake struck, then ran outside
to his death.
Don't Run, Wait
In the event of an earthquake,
the most dangerous thing a per
son could do, according to John
M. Marston, fire chief and dis
aster coordinator would be to
run from the building he is in.
The horizontal movements
caused by earthquakes can eas
ily sling debris in all directions.
This is how Fireman Gerdes
died.
If inside a building when an
earthquake strikes, it is best to
remain inside and seek shelter
under a table or in a doorway.
Doorways are the strongest
parts of buildings and afford the
most protection.


QUAD AND QUAKE — Dr. Jahns looks over an arch on the Quad
which may prove unable to withstand any future earthquake in the
Stanford area. Dr. Jahns says most Stanford buildings will survive.
Stanford's second major earth
quake is on its way. It could be
as destructive as the 1906 shock,
but scientists might be able to
give from 10 minutes' to an
hour's warning before it strikes.
Ninety per cent of the earth
quakes in the United States oc
cur in California, but only one
in 10,000 does any amount of
damage. Some experts says this
"l-in-10,000" quake is just
around the corner.
"Without knowing exactly
when, we can say that between
now and the year 2000 Califor
nia and adjoining areas will
have many moderate earth
quakes, a few severe ones, and
perhaps one great one," said
Louis C. Pakiser, chief of the
U.S. Geological Survey's Nation
al Center for Earthquake Re
search in Menlo Park.
Dr. Richard Jahns, dean of the
Stanford School of Earth Scien
ces, agrees. "I don't think there
is any doubt that the Ray Area
is overdue, in a statistical sense,
for a major earthquake. Every
thing we know about the San
Andreas fault suggests that

twice a century, on the average,
you can expect a major shock.
On this basis, we're overdue.
When geologists, who have
studied the behavior of earth
quakes for years, calmly state
that Stanford is long overdue
for a major earthquake, they
probably don't realize they have
frightened a considerable num
ber of non-geology majors.
What frightens the non-geolo
gy majors even more is the rela
tive unpredictability of an earth
quake. He is equally upset when
he reads that two minor shocks
last month, one of which rattled
coffee cups and shook windows
on the Stanford campus, wpre
caused by slippage exactly along
the trace of the 1906 fault break.
The 1906 earthquake, which
also caused disastrous fires in
San Francisco, shattered the
young Stanford campus.
Building: Codes Enforced
Since another earthquake has
always been a possibility, all
structures on the Stanford cam
pus have since 1940 conformed
to the minimum standards of
building codes of Santa Clara
County.

As geologists and seismolo
gists learn new facts from earth
quakes, these minimum require
ments are revised and brought
up to date.
Various older buildings on
campus, such as the Law School
and parts of Encina Hall, have
been remodeled and strengthen
ed against earthquakes.
In the central section of En
cina Hall, brick walls supported
wooden floors. Now, however,
much stronger steel columns sup
port reinforced concrete floors.
Plans are underway now for
similar remodeling of Jordan
Hall and the west wing of En
cina Hall. But much more re
mains to be done.
Dr. Burt Wells, professor
emeritus of civil engineering,
cited a number of buildings
which would probably take the
most damage in the wake of a
major earthquake.
"I would say that the one and
two story buildings around the
outer Quad which have not been
remodeled or strengthened —
for example, the geology, engi
neering, and history buildings —
would probably be most suscep

tible to damage. But I don't pre
dict they would collapse. They
would be damaged."
Indestructible?
Dr. Wells, who was living in
Palo Alto at the time of the
190G quake, made a study of Me
morial Church some years later
and wrote an earthquake report
on it. He believes that the re
built church would not be very
heavily damaged during a ma
jor earthquake. "On the whole,"
he said, "I think its a very stable
structure."
In 1913 Memorial Church was
rebuilt with a steel frame
around it. The walls have a 16-
inch concrete core reinforced
with steel bars running horizon
tally, vertically, and diagonally.
Each stone of the church is an
chored into this concrete core
with iron rods.
It has jokingly been said that
Hoover Tower, a tremendously
strong and well-designed build
ing, could be tipped over on its
side and not fall to pieces. A
steel frame surrounded by con
crete runs from the top of the
tower all the way down to Its
foundations.

"Wilbur and Stern Halls,"
commented Dr. Wells, "are rein
forced concrete buildings which
conform well to the building
code. About the only damage a
major earthquake might bring
would be broken windows and
cracked walls."
Dr. Wells also explained that
wood frame houses, such as the
new fraternity houses, as a rule,
do very well in earthquakes.
They are light in weight, and
the lighter a building is, the
less damage it is apt to receive.
Stanford's new, two-mile lin
ear accelerator is located only
one mile away from the 1906
break in the San Andreas fault.
When constructed, semi-auto
matic devices were built in to
allow realignment after an
earthquake.
Closing: A Gap
Present concentration in the
scientific prediction of earth
quakes is on the possibility of
giving 10 minute's to an hour's
warning of a major shock.
"Now this isn't going to help
anyone's building," says Dr.
Jahns, "but it certainly means
that you can empty out school


EARTHQUAKE: Memorial Church after IfKMt quake
houses, auditoriums, and thea
ters. It could have a tremendous
influence on loss of life.
"It's a very sophisticated prob
lem. The best approaches right
now seem to be a very precise,
constant monitoring of the mag
netic field in the rocks on either
side of the fault.
"About half an hour to 45
minutes prior to a major earth
quake, there has been a unique
change in this magnetic field.
This looks like a major break
through in earthquake predic
tion.
Dr. Robert L. Kovach, associ
ate professor of geophysics at
Stanford, has been studying
these magnetic changes. "Th e
research up to now," he said,
"has proved fruitful and ex
tremely promising. It may even
hold the promise of developing
into a prediction capability."
"So, within a decade," Dr.
Jahns commented," we might
be able to predict an earthquake
10 minutes to the better part of
an hour in advance.
"And we might soon be able
to do some good on the other
end, like saying the chances are
60 per cent that we'll have a
major shock in such-an-such an
area within the next 10 years.
But there is gap here, and that's
what has to be closed."
