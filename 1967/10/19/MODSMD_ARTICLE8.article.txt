# Experts Say Major Earthquake To Happen Here
## 
### HANK LIESE 
Stanford's second major earth
quake is on its way. It could be
as destructive as the 1906 shock,
but scientists might be able to
give from 10 minutes' to an
hour's warning before it strikes.
Ninety per cent of the earth
quakes in the United States oc
cur in California, but only one
in 10,000 does any amount of
damage. Some experts says this
"l-in-10,000" quake is just
around the corner.
"Without knowing exactly
when, we can say that between
now and the year 2000 Califor
nia and adjoining areas will
have many moderate earth
quakes, a few severe ones, and
perhaps one great one," said
Louis C. Pakiser, chief of the
U.S. Geological Survey's Nation
al Center for Earthquake Re
search in Menlo Park.
Dr. Richard Jahns, dean of the
Stanford School of Earth Scien
ces, agrees. "I don't think there
is any doubt that the Ray Area
is overdue, in a statistical sense,
for a major earthquake. Every
thing we know about the San
Andreas fault suggests that

twice a century, on the average,
you can expect a major shock.
On this basis, we're overdue.
When geologists, who have
studied the behavior of earth
quakes for years, calmly state
that Stanford is long overdue
for a major earthquake, they
probably don't realize they have
frightened a considerable num
ber of non-geology majors.
What frightens the non-geolo
gy majors even more is the rela
tive unpredictability of an earth
quake. He is equally upset when
he reads that two minor shocks
last month, one of which rattled
coffee cups and shook windows
on the Stanford campus, wpre
caused by slippage exactly along
the trace of the 1906 fault break.
The 1906 earthquake, which
also caused disastrous fires in
San Francisco, shattered the
young Stanford campus.
Building: Codes Enforced
Since another earthquake has
always been a possibility, all
structures on the Stanford cam
pus have since 1940 conformed
to the minimum standards of
building codes of Santa Clara
County.

As geologists and seismolo
gists learn new facts from earth
quakes, these minimum require
ments are revised and brought
up to date.
Various older buildings on
campus, such as the Law School
and parts of Encina Hall, have
been remodeled and strengthen
ed against earthquakes.
In the central section of En
cina Hall, brick walls supported
wooden floors. Now, however,
much stronger steel columns sup
port reinforced concrete floors.
Plans are underway now for
similar remodeling of Jordan
Hall and the west wing of En
cina Hall. But much more re
mains to be done.
Dr. Burt Wells, professor
emeritus of civil engineering,
cited a number of buildings
which would probably take the
most damage in the wake of a
major earthquake.
"I would say that the one and
two story buildings around the
outer Quad which have not been
remodeled or strengthened —
for example, the geology, engi
neering, and history buildings —
would probably be most suscep

tible to damage. But I don't pre
dict they would collapse. They
would be damaged."
Indestructible?
Dr. Wells, who was living in
Palo Alto at the time of the
190G quake, made a study of Me
morial Church some years later
and wrote an earthquake report
on it. He believes that the re
built church would not be very
heavily damaged during a ma
jor earthquake. "On the whole,"
he said, "I think its a very stable
structure."
In 1913 Memorial Church was
rebuilt with a steel frame
around it. The walls have a 16-
inch concrete core reinforced
with steel bars running horizon
tally, vertically, and diagonally.
Each stone of the church is an
chored into this concrete core
with iron rods.
It has jokingly been said that
Hoover Tower, a tremendously
strong and well-designed build
ing, could be tipped over on its
side and not fall to pieces. A
steel frame surrounded by con
crete runs from the top of the
tower all the way down to Its
foundations.

"Wilbur and Stern Halls,"
commented Dr. Wells, "are rein
forced concrete buildings which
conform well to the building
code. About the only damage a
major earthquake might bring
would be broken windows and
cracked walls."
Dr. Wells also explained that
wood frame houses, such as the
new fraternity houses, as a rule,
do very well in earthquakes.
They are light in weight, and
the lighter a building is, the
less damage it is apt to receive.
Stanford's new, two-mile lin
ear accelerator is located only
one mile away from the 1906
break in the San Andreas fault.
When constructed, semi-auto
matic devices were built in to
allow realignment after an
earthquake.
Closing: A Gap
Present concentration in the
scientific prediction of earth
quakes is on the possibility of
giving 10 minute's to an hour's
warning of a major shock.
"Now this isn't going to help
anyone's building," says Dr.
Jahns, "but it certainly means
that you can empty out school
