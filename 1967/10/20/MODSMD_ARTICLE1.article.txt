# The 						key of 'C'
## A 						short story 
### charlotte Washington 
First a white one, then a white one. Another white one. All of them
white, I thought, the key of C is all white. And there is no black one.
Even the chromatic scale goes white key, black key, white key.
Smiling sardonically, I lifted my head and looked around the room.
Good! No one to stare and wonder why I sat at the piano picking out baby
scales with one finger. But I was tired of that, anyway. I had at least an
hour until Mr. Fonnel came to pick me up for babysitting. I regretted
taking this last-minute job, especially over the phone. Maybe the man was
a psychopath.
No, not likely; I imagined his arrival. At ten after eight, the doorbell
would ring, and I would run and answer it, introducing myself at the door.
He would do the same, and stare. He would smile and make funny remarks
and apologize for being late, but he would stare at my light brown hair
and lighter brown face. It was at this time I always wanted to say casually,
"I'll bet you're wondering if I'm a 'Jegro, or what." So far I had resisted
the impulse.
I wondered if Kenny was reheai si.ig with Pat again. I would have thought
once would have been enough, after last night. He had explained that he
and Pat were going to go over a few things at Pat's mother's house, so we
drove into East Palo Alto to a little group of apartments that were hiding
from the main street. I was curious about Pat's mother, wondering if he
had inherited his mouthiness.
There were people all over the little apartment. Pat introduced us to his
mother, sister, wife, and children, and a big man wolfing down a sandwich
with a bottle of beer. He merely nodded, everyone else smiled.
Pat's mother was the typical pillar of the AME Zion Church. She re
garded me with the narrow-eyed tentative hostility that brown women re
serve for whites and lighter negroes. She grudgingly pushed aside some
clothes on the couch so I could sit down and waited to see what kind of
airs I would put on.
I smiled. Kenny had put on a record, and Pat started talking. Suddenly
Pat's mother said, "Where are you from?"
I told her I was from Cleveland; she relaxed a little, and almost smiled.
She informed me she was from Detroit, herself, and then proceeded to
name every name she knew in Cleveland, and a few streets. I didn't know
any of the people she knew, but she wasn't mad.
"What's the name of that big hotel there, the one by the station?" she
asked. "I always used to stay in a hotel when I visited my friendsâ€”you
know, you can come and go when you please, and get up when you want.
They used to try and make me stay with them, but I stayed in my hotel.
It's just better, you know."
I knew. I smiled, I agreed, but I couldn't name the hotel. No matter, she
turned to me with a "How-could-you" look and said, "Do you like it out
here?" Not waiting for an answer she swept on, "This is only temporary. I
don't like it out here. We're going back East in a few weeks. I just don't
like it. You know, folks out here are so much alike, they're just all the same,
not like back East. You know what I mean?"
I assured her that I did, even though I didn't. Just then one of the assorted
children scattered around the room came over and stared at us. This one
was a girl, I figured, even though her head was practically bald. She had
her thumb in her mouth. I smiled, and bravely plucked her up.
"Hello there," I cooed. She stared at me, and began to pull my hair. Her
grandmother chuckled. I looked at the other children, boys. They seemed
to have random bald spots, or sores, on their scalps. Maybe hair doesn't
run in the family, I decided.
Then Kenny said, "Let's go," and I felt a wave of relief that subsided
when Pat said, "Yeah, we got to play the horns at my house."
"Well," Pat's mother said, "maybe I'll see you back East some time. If
you're ever in Detroit, just drop by. I live at 1719 Ilocevar." Pat immedi
ately corrected her pronounciation of the street. She replied that everyone
she knew called it that. Pat gloated; his point had been made. He was
different.
On that note we departed. As we followed Pat a thought suddenly oc
curred to me. "Kenny," I whispered, "if Pat got evicted last week, where
does he live?"
"With another family, I think," he replied.

We arrived at the house, a small cot
tage. The three kids filed silently up
to the door. I wondered if they had
turned into ghosts during the trip from the
apartment.
As soon as we got inside, Pat's wife excused
herself to go make some coffee. I was glad, I
wasn't up to another conversation.
"You haven't seen my machine, have you?"
Pat chuckled, pointing towards a blue and
white plastic affair in the corner. "It's hooked

"Hello there," I cooed. She stared at me, and began to pull my hair. Her
grandmother chuckled.

up to my phone, you know, and it records
ever>' conversation. Everything you say goes
right into there. When you threaten me, baby,
I got it on tape."
He switched on the machine, and we heard
some dialogues. I listened eagerly for the
threats. There was one! "Will you tell Mr. Pat
Johnson to call the telephone company im
mediately, please, or his service will be discon
tinued."
Pat shut the machine off, and picked up his
trumpet. "You know,"he said, "fellow up in
The City has a brand new bass and a brand
new horn of mine. Soon's as I get through with
all this legal proceedings, I'm going to get it
back or sue him. I spend every other day in
court about this eviction thing. My case is pre
pared so beautifully they can't turn it down.
Good thing I bought those books over there.
You see those? Law, daddy, law! Nothing like
it, best subject in the world."
"Yeah, Pat," Kenny said. "Can we play a few
records?"
They immediately were immersed trying to
produce an audible volume of sound from the
beat-up record player in the corner of the living
room. However, this player wasn't having any.
Pat then got a brilliant idea. He thought they
could hook up the tape recorder to the needle
of the record player while it was playing and
the music would go right onto the tape.
I didn't want to think about that one. Just
then I heard a scream from the direction in
which the kids had disappeared, presumably
from the bedroom. I followed the sound It was
Cynthia, and her brother was comforting her.
I noticed that he had a head at both ends of
his body, and one was asleep. Then, I realized,
when I looked at the empty top bunk, that both
brothers shared a bed.
"What's your name?" I asked.
"Stevie," was the muffled answer. "I got my
tooth out. That's Carl. Cynthia hurt her finger."

"I'll take her out here and watch her," I said.
"Do you want me to turn out the light when I
leave?"
He nodded, so I picked up Cynthia and left.
Mrs. Johnson had finished in the kitchen, and
Pat and Kenny had finished with the record
player. I guessed that Pat's idea hadn't worked.
Cynthia snuggled up in my arms, thumb in her
mouth, and began pulling my hair.
"She just loves to pull hair while she's suck
ing her thumb, it's the funniest tiling," her

mother ventured helpfully. "She's pulled out
almost all of her hair. The doetor told me not
to stop her, that would make her do it more.
She just loves anything soft. I think it's from
when I was working, and she stayed home with
her father. You know, not having a woman
around."
Looking at Pat's stubby face, and short kinky
hair, I could sympathize with Cynthia, but I
didn't say so. She seemed to be falling asleep,
slobbering on my arm. I smiled, weakly.
"This is actually a beautiful house," Pat's
wife said suddenly. "You know, this is only
temporary. We're moving back East in a couple
of weeks." Must be a mass exodus, I thought.
"The lady who lives here has five children,"
she continued. That explained the lack of bed
space, then; I wondered if those children were
not only silent, but invisible, and that was why
there was no sign of them.

"She's very nice," the woman added. An un
derstatement, I thought, to take in a family of
five, she must be a saint.
"Her husband died last year, of cancer. She's
only about twenty-eight. I don't think she's
completely gotten over his passing, you know,
they were so young and all. She doesn't have
to work, though. He had insurance, and her
mother-in-law helps her out. That's where they
are now, at her mother-in-law's."
"Oh, that's nice,'' I replied. Her name was
Lurleen, I suddenly remembered. I wondered
if I should call her by her first name. I wouldn't
want to be called that, I thought.
"Of course this is only temporary," she re
iterated. Til be so glad when we leave. The
children are always getting into fights, so many
of them, you know. We'll probably drive back
East in June. It'll be a nice trip for the chil
dren."
"Yes," I agreed. "School will be out. You're
driving your car back?" I queried, thinking of
the '34 Plymouth out front even making it
across the State line.
"Yes," she said. "If it breaks down, we'll just
catch a bus or something. We'll have to take
the children out of school a little early, but the
teacher said they won't fail. They've missed so
much school already. Stevie caught ringworm
at school, and Carl caught it from him. I've
spent so much money taking them to doctors,
washing their heads with special soap, I even
tried to cut their hair. The doctor said there's
not too much he can do for Carl, once it gets
inside the hair follicles, he just can't reach it."

I thought of the kids in my elementary
school who had caught ringworm. With
their shaved heads and stocking caps they
were the butt of many a joke, but they got
cured. Maybe doctors were better back East.
By this time Kenny and Pat had gotten
warmed up, and were playing pretty loudly.
In between numbers Pat made appropriate
comments on his own greatness.
"You know,"he announced, "people tell me
I sound just like Harry James. But I was play
ing first, I've been playing professionally since
I was twelve years old, you know, and actually
he sounds just like me. And that's the truth.
Say, man, when we played that job the other
day, did they mean it when they applauded,
or were they just kidding?"
Reassured that the audience was, in fact,
sincere, Pat continued to demonstrate his great
ness, very loudly.
Just then the doorbell rang. We all knew it
was one of our neighbors. But it was Dolores,
the nice widow who lived there. Pat's relief
was visible.
Dolores was tall and thin, with a pleasant
smile. She looked tired, and explained she had
left her children with their grandmother, and
driven back by herself. Good move, I thought.
I noticed that she had vericose veins. She
turned around to show Mrs. Johnson how her
hair was coming out in back. She explained
that she just pulled it,"from nervousness, or
something." Another one, I thought, but she
had better reason to pull hair than Cynthia.
"Ma'am, do you have a record player that
works?" Kenny inquired.
As it turned out, the one they'd rejected
earlier did, when two little wires were connec
ted. Of course, this set Pat off. He proceeded
to inform us what a great genius he was in
electronics.
"I used to write the exams when I was in
school. Write them, baby. I used to tell the
teacher what he was going to ask."
"You see this here," he said, fishing a piece
of paper out of his pocket, "this is THE elec
tronics exam on the Peninsula. If you know the
answers to these questions you can have any
job, anywhere. I used to write papers for grad
uate students, electrical engineering students."
"Pat's going to go to law school when we
get back East," his wife whispered proudly.

"His not working now is only temporary. He
wants me to go to school, too."
I smiled, and nodded, wondering if the boys
would go to private schools when their ring
worm was cured.
doorbell ended my reverie. I looked
at my watch. It was ten after eight! I
ran to answer it. It was Mr. Fonnel, and
we went through our parts on cue. All the way
to his house I could feel his eyes on the side
of my face. Figuring I was not what he had
expected, I was reminded of what Dolores had
said when we left last night.
"I just want to say something," she had said
as we were going out the door. "When Pat told
me he was bringing in a musician from Stan
ford, one who had his own group, I was expect
ing a white fellow."
The plastered smile on my face had widened,
and cracked into a laugh.
Mr. Fonnel looked pleased. I figured I must
have laughed aloud, at the right time.

"I just want to say something," she had said as we were going out the
door. "When Pat told me he was bringing in a musician from Stanford,
one who had his own group, I was expecting a white fellow."

We went into the house. There were two
boys and a girl; they looked well-behaved.
After the Fonnels left I settled down for the
few minutes before they had to go to bed.
"My name is Cynthia," the girl spoke.
I laughed. "Did you pull out all your hair?"
"No," she said. "See, it's long. I am eight

years old and I am in the fourth grade. I have
a boyfriend named Stevie at school. He has
nice blond hair like mine, andâ€”"
"No," I interrupted her, "he doesn't have any.
All his hair fell out."
She stared at me perplexedly. "You don't
know him, do you? What do you mean?"
Fearing she was going to cry, I reassured
her, "It's only temporary."
"My daddy's an engineer," the oldest boy put
in, tired of being left out of the conversation,
"but not on a train. He reads books."
"Well," I said, smiling, "you'd better tell him
to get Pat's test."
"Who's Pat?" he asked. They all stared at me.
I smiled. It was time to put them to bed.
"How many beds do you have?" I asked.
"I have a canopy bed," Cynthia replied. "The
boys have beds in their bedroom, and Mommy
and Daddy have a bed, and there's the one that

Grandmother sleeps in when she comes to visit
us. That makes five."
"Isn't that nice?" I said. "Let's go to bed
now."
First a white one, then a white one. The boys
were tucked in their beds. Another white one.
Cynthia was in. All of them white, and all of
them tucked in their own little beds.
