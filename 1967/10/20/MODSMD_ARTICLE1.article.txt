# The
						key of 'C'
## A
						short story 
### charlotte Washington 
First a white one, then a white one. Another white one. All of them
white, I thought, the key of C is all white. And there is no black one.
Even the chromatic scale goes white key, black key, white key.
Smiling sardonically, I lifted my head and looked around the room.
Good! No one to stare and wonder why I sat at the piano picking out baby
scales with one finger. But I was tired of that, anyway. I had at least an
hour until Mr. Fonnel came to pick me up for babysitting. I regretted
taking this last-minute job, especially over the phone. Maybe the man was
a psychopath.
No, not likely; I imagined his arrival. At ten after eight, the doorbell
would ring, and I would run and answer it, introducing myself at the door.
He would do the same, and stare. He would smile and make funny remarks
and apologize for being late, but he would stare at my light brown hair
and lighter brown face. It was at this time I always wanted to say casually,
"I'll bet you're wondering if I'm a 'Jegro, or what." So far I had resisted
the impulse.
I wondered if Kenny was reheai si.ig with Pat again. I would have thought
once would have been enough, after last night. He had explained that he
and Pat were going to go over a few things at Pat's mother's house, so we
drove into East Palo Alto to a little group of apartments that were hiding
from the main street. I was curious about Pat's mother, wondering if he
had inherited his mouthiness.
There were people all over the little apartment. Pat introduced us to his
mother, sister, wife, and children, and a big man wolfing down a sandwich
with a bottle of beer. He merely nodded, everyone else smiled.
Pat's mother was the typical pillar of the AME Zion Church. She re
garded me with the narrow-eyed tentative hostility that brown women re
serve for whites and lighter negroes. She grudgingly pushed aside some
clothes on the couch so I could sit down and waited to see what kind of
airs I would put on.
I smiled. Kenny had put on a record, and Pat started talking. Suddenly
Pat's mother said, "Where are you from?"
I told her I was from Cleveland; she relaxed a little, and almost smiled.
She informed me she was from Detroit, herself, and then proceeded to
name every name she knew in Cleveland, and a few streets. I didn't know
any of the people she knew, but she wasn't mad.
"What's the name of that big hotel there, the one by the station?" she
asked. "I always used to stay in a hotel when I visited my friends—you
know, you can come and go when you please, and get up when you want.
They used to try and make me stay with them, but I stayed in my hotel.
It's just better, you know."
I knew. I smiled, I agreed, but I couldn't name the hotel. No matter, she
turned to me with a "How-could-you" look and said, "Do you like it out
here?" Not waiting for an answer she swept on, "This is only temporary. I
don't like it out here. We're going back East in a few weeks. I just don't
like it. You know, folks out here are so much alike, they're just all the same,
not like back East. You know what I mean?"
I assured her that I did, even though I didn't. Just then one of the assorted
children scattered around the room came over and stared at us. This one
was a girl, I figured, even though her head was practically bald. She had
her thumb in her mouth. I smiled, and bravely plucked her up.
"Hello there," I cooed. She stared at me, and began to pull my hair. Her
grandmother chuckled. I looked at the other children, boys. They seemed
to have random bald spots, or sores, on their scalps. Maybe hair doesn't
run in the family, I decided.
Then Kenny said, "Let's go," and I felt a wave of relief that subsided
when Pat said, "Yeah, we got to play the horns at my house."
"Well," Pat's mother said, "maybe I'll see you back East some time. If
you're ever in Detroit, just drop by. I live at 1719 Ilocevar." Pat immedi
ately corrected her pronounciation of the street. She replied that everyone
she knew called it that. Pat gloated; his point had been made. He was
different.
On that note we departed. As we followed Pat a thought suddenly oc
curred to me. "Kenny," I whispered, "if Pat got evicted last week, where
does he live?"
"With another family, I think," he replied.
