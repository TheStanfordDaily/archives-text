### 
Beside the muddy waters of the San Francisco Bay,
There lies a barren asphalt land oi sweat, despair, and gray.
And here before the dawn could break from near and far alike,
Came the ones who hold men dear, to shout and sing and fight.
Their freedom was the object then of this intense debate.
Clubs and gas they did not have to turn the tide of hate.
Instead, they used their hearts and minds as weapons in their war;
These peaceful arms were splintered, though, by Man s unknowing whore.
The thunder-gods they marked themselves, in grace and justice done.
Their cruel and ready rods brought shade upon the bright young sun.
And gold and blue and silver too, were never so defiled.
As on that day when fear ran free along the asphalt aisles.
Ahead they marched to rhythmic beat, in strict and threatening lines,
And as the tide which sweeps the shore, gods flooded past the signs
Held once by students, torn with fear, their teachers and their friends,
People who see all too well their freedom's bitter end.
When at last the blackened field was safe for someone's slavery,
And taunts had changed from Hitler's "Heil to "When in church, pray
for me;"
There remained a boy, a gash on head, bright blood seeping from it,
Two girls weeping through braided hair, and America trying to vomit.
