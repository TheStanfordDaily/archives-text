# Antiquity is not when it's at
## 
### 
I want to make a plea for rhetoric. Good
prose is becoming very unfashionable these
days. One is supposed to weigh people's utter
ances by the sum of points made, by their sub
stance, in short, by their "meaningfulness."
The general concern with sincerity is alarm
ing. Language, our Twentieth Century sociolo
gists tell us, is the communication of facts.
When an infant says, "Wah," he is communi
cating information about the humidity of his
diapers; he is not expressing discomfort.
Well, the trend has gone too far. We have
achieved "rapport" with our fellows, banished
subjectivity, eliminated hypocrisy and estab
lished communication. What we have lost is
a sense of style.
It's apparently not how we write that mat
ters, it's what we write: great dripping chunks
of meaningfulness, served up on hot spoonfuls
of turgid sincerity, laced with Christian names,
zeal and faulty punctuation. The mind boggles;
if you want to express an argument these days,
you cast it in a form that is at once careless,
naive and spontaneous.
It's no accident, therefore, that the popular
writers on campus fit this description almost
exactly: Tolkien, McLuhan and the Under
ground Press. Style suggests antiquity, and we
all know that antiquity's not when it's at. Style
is rhetoric: style is Handel, Gibbon, Cicero.
Style is the baroque framework cast round a
nugget of truth. Strip off the framework and
the modern mind can get at the meaning.
The trend to meaningfulness becomes am
biguous. The other day a student writing his
curriculum vitae, though he wouldn't call it
that, stated that he had been "studing contin
uously five years." A professor of spirit would
have referred him to the racing stables.
Punctuation, spellfhg, litotes, footnotes,
metaphors, they all go overboard. They are
rhetorical devices, secondary considerations;
the quintessential prose is a transcribed tele
phone call, style is sophistic pedantry.
Imagine for a moment what it would be like
if anti-style hit other fields of contemporary
life in the way it has hit self-expression: it
doesn't matter how we dress, how we eat, how
we drive and how we think. The manner is ir
relevant. The result is what counts: to your
trough, pigs; sackcloth for the women and a
computer will do for the mind. Impregnation
not pleasure, a brain instead of an intellect,
dollars instead of an education.
I was consoling myself from dreary premo
nitions the other day by leafing through my
Gibbon and my John Addington Symonds. The
latter, of course, is a Victorian scholar, defi
nitely not comme il faut, which, being inter
preted, signifies "groovy."
Symonds tells me with whimsical delicacy
about a philologist of the fifteenth century:
"The best thing that can be said about Filelfo as a
man is, that he was undoubtedly attached to his wives
and to the numerous children they bore him. This feel
ing did not, however, protect him from numerous in
fidelities, or save his fortune from the burden of illegi
timate children. It is even doubtful whether credence
should not be accorded to suggestions of worse de
bauchery, repeated with every appearance of belief
by his enemies, and on his side but imperfectly re
futed."
A footnote to the second sentence, appended
with a grave sense of historical impartiality,
closes this sketch with a reference to an eigh
♦'enth century source which states that the

gentleman in question "frequently boasted of
being tri-testicled."
Gibbon tells me with equal charm about an
early Roman emperor:
"Twenty-two acknowledged concubines and a library
of sixty-two thousand volumes attested to the variety
of his inclinations; and from the productions wliich he
left behind him, it appears that the former as well as
the latter were for use rather than ostentation."
Modern books, on the other hand, would
scorn this manner. This is the age of the four
letter word, of the fact rather than its represen
tation. As style dies, so does a sense of aesthetic
refinement and grace. And while the definition
of rhetoric is widened to include anything too
complicated for a dyspeptic industrialist to
appreciate, the degeneration of English prose
is gradually accomplished.
While we goggle before the tube, at Marshall
McLuhan, at Disney, "the tenth-rate Shake
speare of the modern age", a whole tragedy is
being played beneath our pens. It is the death
of style, the loss of an aristocratic ideal of lan
guage, and it may prove to be the irreparable
intellectual disaster of this age of equal oppor
tunity and introspection.

I want to make a plea for rhetoric. Good
prose is becoming very unfashionable these
days. One is supposed to weigh people's utter
ances by the sum of points made, by their sub
stance, in short, by their "meaningfulness."
The general concern with sincerity is alarm
ing. Language, our Twentieth Century sociolo
gists tell us, is the communication of facts.
When an infant says, "Wah," he is communi
cating information about the humidity of his
diapers; he is not expressing discomfort.
Well, the trend has gone too far. We have
achieved "rapport" with our fellows, banished
subjectivity, eliminated hypocrisy and estab
lished communication. What we have lost is
a sense of style.
It's apparently not how we write that mat
ters, it's what we write: great dripping chunks
of meaningfulness, served up on hot spoonfuls
of turgid sincerity, laced with Christian names,
zeal and faulty punctuation. The mind boggles;
if you want to express an argument these days,
you cast it in a form that is at once careless,
naive and spontaneous.
It's no accident, therefore, that the popular
writers on campus fit this description almost
exactly: Tolkien, McLuhan and the Under
ground Press. Style suggests antiquity, and we
all know that antiquity's not when it's at. Style
is rhetoric: style is Handel, Gibbon, Cicero.
Style is the baroque framework cast round a
nugget of truth. Strip off the framework and
the modern mind can get at the meaning.
The trend to meaningfulness becomes am
biguous. The other day a student writing his
curriculum vitae, though he wouldn't call it
that, stated that he had been "studing contin
uously five years." A professor of spirit would
have referred him to the racing stables.
Punctuation, spellfhg, litotes, footnotes,
metaphors, they all go overboard. They are
rhetorical devices, secondary considerations;
the quintessential prose is a transcribed tele
phone call, style is sophistic pedantry.
Imagine for a moment what it would be like
if anti-style hit other fields of contemporary
life in the way it has hit self-expression: it
doesn't matter how we dress, how we eat, how
we drive and how we think. The manner is ir
relevant. The result is what counts: to your
trough, pigs; sackcloth for the women and a
computer will do for the mind. Impregnation
not pleasure, a brain instead of an intellect,
dollars instead of an education.
I was consoling myself from dreary premo
nitions the other day by leafing through my
Gibbon and my John Addington Symonds. The
latter, of course, is a Victorian scholar, defi
nitely not comme il faut, which, being inter
preted, signifies "groovy."
Symonds tells me with whimsical delicacy
about a philologist of the fifteenth century:
"The best thing that can be said about Filelfo as a
man is, that he was undoubtedly attached to his wives
and to the numerous children they bore him. This feel
ing did not, however, protect him from numerous in
fidelities, or save his fortune from the burden of illegi
timate children. It is even doubtful whether credence
should not be accorded to suggestions of worse de
bauchery, repeated with every appearance of belief
by his enemies, and on his side but imperfectly re
futed."
A footnote to the second sentence, appended
with a grave sense of historical impartiality,
closes this sketch with a reference to an eigh
♦'enth century source which states that the

gentleman in question "frequently boasted of
being tri-testicled."
Gibbon tells me with equal charm about an
early Roman emperor:
"Twenty-two acknowledged concubines and a library
of sixty-two thousand volumes attested to the variety
of his inclinations; and from the productions wliich he
left behind him, it appears that the former as well as
the latter were for use rather than ostentation."
Modern books, on the other hand, would
scorn this manner. This is the age of the four
letter word, of the fact rather than its represen
tation. As style dies, so does a sense of aesthetic
refinement and grace. And while the definition
of rhetoric is widened to include anything too
complicated for a dyspeptic industrialist to
appreciate, the degeneration of English prose
is gradually accomplished.
While we goggle before the tube, at Marshall
McLuhan, at Disney, "the tenth-rate Shake
speare of the modern age", a whole tragedy is
being played beneath our pens. It is the death
of style, the loss of an aristocratic ideal of lan
guage, and it may prove to be the irreparable
intellectual disaster of this age of equal oppor
tunity and introspection.

I want to make a plea for rhetoric. Good
prose is becoming very unfashionable these
days. One is supposed to weigh people's utter
ances by the sum of points made, by their sub
stance, in short, by their "meaningfulness."
The general concern with sincerity is alarm
ing. Language, our Twentieth Century sociolo
gists tell us, is the communication of facts.
When an infant says, "Wah," he is communi
cating information about the humidity of his
diapers; he is not expressing discomfort.
Well, the trend has gone too far. We have
achieved "rapport" with our fellows, banished
subjectivity, eliminated hypocrisy and estab
lished communication. What we have lost is
a sense of style.
It's apparently not how we write that mat
ters, it's what we write: great dripping chunks
of meaningfulness, served up on hot spoonfuls
of turgid sincerity, laced with Christian names,
zeal and faulty punctuation. The mind boggles;
if you want to express an argument these days,
you cast it in a form that is at once careless,
naive and spontaneous.
It's no accident, therefore, that the popular
writers on campus fit this description almost
exactly: Tolkien, McLuhan and the Under
ground Press. Style suggests antiquity, and we
all know that antiquity's not when it's at. Style
is rhetoric: style is Handel, Gibbon, Cicero.
Style is the baroque framework cast round a
nugget of truth. Strip off the framework and
the modern mind can get at the meaning.
The trend to meaningfulness becomes am
biguous. The other day a student writing his
curriculum vitae, though he wouldn't call it
that, stated that he had been "studing contin
uously five years." A professor of spirit would
have referred him to the racing stables.
Punctuation, spellfhg, litotes, footnotes,
metaphors, they all go overboard. They are
rhetorical devices, secondary considerations;
the quintessential prose is a transcribed tele
phone call, style is sophistic pedantry.
Imagine for a moment what it would be like
if anti-style hit other fields of contemporary
life in the way it has hit self-expression: it
doesn't matter how we dress, how we eat, how
we drive and how we think. The manner is ir
relevant. The result is what counts: to your
trough, pigs; sackcloth for the women and a
computer will do for the mind. Impregnation
not pleasure, a brain instead of an intellect,
dollars instead of an education.
I was consoling myself from dreary premo
nitions the other day by leafing through my
Gibbon and my John Addington Symonds. The
latter, of course, is a Victorian scholar, defi
nitely not comme il faut, which, being inter
preted, signifies "groovy."
Symonds tells me with whimsical delicacy
about a philologist of the fifteenth century:
"The best thing that can be said about Filelfo as a
man is, that he was undoubtedly attached to his wives
and to the numerous children they bore him. This feel
ing did not, however, protect him from numerous in
fidelities, or save his fortune from the burden of illegi
timate children. It is even doubtful whether credence
should not be accorded to suggestions of worse de
bauchery, repeated with every appearance of belief
by his enemies, and on his side but imperfectly re
futed."
A footnote to the second sentence, appended
with a grave sense of historical impartiality,
closes this sketch with a reference to an eigh
♦'enth century source which states that the

gentleman in question "frequently boasted of
being tri-testicled."
Gibbon tells me with equal charm about an
early Roman emperor:
"Twenty-two acknowledged concubines and a library
of sixty-two thousand volumes attested to the variety
of his inclinations; and from the productions wliich he
left behind him, it appears that the former as well as
the latter were for use rather than ostentation."
Modern books, on the other hand, would
scorn this manner. This is the age of the four
letter word, of the fact rather than its represen
tation. As style dies, so does a sense of aesthetic
refinement and grace. And while the definition
of rhetoric is widened to include anything too
complicated for a dyspeptic industrialist to
appreciate, the degeneration of English prose
is gradually accomplished.
While we goggle before the tube, at Marshall
McLuhan, at Disney, "the tenth-rate Shake
speare of the modern age", a whole tragedy is
being played beneath our pens. It is the death
of style, the loss of an aristocratic ideal of lan
guage, and it may prove to be the irreparable
intellectual disaster of this age of equal oppor
tunity and introspection.
