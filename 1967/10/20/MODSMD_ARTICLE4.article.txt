# 'Vietnam:' plea for sanity
## 
### 
Vietnam: Crisis of Conscience, Robert McAfee
Brown, Abraham J. Heschel, Michael Novak;
Association Press, Behrman House, Herder
and Herder, New York.
It is a comment of sorts on our secular society
when a book on the moral implications of the
Vietnam war by three well-known religious
leaders contains four times as many citations
from the New York Times as from the Scrip
tures.
For Vietnam: Crisis of Conscience owes far
more to Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and Richard
Goodwin than to St. Augustine, Erasmus or
Reinhold Niebuhr.
It's not the kind of book one expects from a
Protestant theologian, a Jewish rabbi, and a
well-known Catholic author. But when the trio
consists of Robert McAfee Brown, Abraham
Heschel, and Michael Novak, perhaps one
should.
"If it seems to some readers that a book ad
dressed to the churches and synagogues should
be more 'religious' in tone and vocabulary, we
can only respond that any discussion of how
men live and die is a theological, moral, and re
ligious discussion, regardless of phraseology,"
the authors state in the preface.
The book, written as a result of the two-day
meeting of clergy and laymen in Washington
last January to protest the Vietnam war, con
sists of three essays, all urging an end to the
bombing and a negotiated settlement—"Peace
without Victory."
Novak begins the book with a thumbnail
historical sketch of U.S. foreign policy and in
volvement in Vietnam. Heschel writes a brief
and emotional essay against "The Moral Out
rage of Vietnam" ("It is not for man to decide
who shall live and who shall die, who shall kill
and who shall sigh"), and Brown outlines a
program for negotiation and disengagement,
ending with a plea to the churches and syna
gogues to "register an outcry that cannot be
ignored."
Novak and Brown deal overwhelmingly
with political questions, for the most part con-
vincingly. Both have done their
homework carefully, and their
essays bristle with quotations
from journals like the New
York Times, Newsweek, and
Commentary, and writers like
Goodwin and Theodore Draper;
Schlesinger's Bitter Heritage is
frequently cited too.
Novak tells well the now-fam
iliar story of how the U.S. met
political failure with military
escalation. He lashes out anew
at the already tattered explana
tions for the continued bombing
of the north, and enumerates
the jumbled rationale for the
ever-deepening U.S. involvement
in the south.
Brown, too, runs through the
inventory of arguments against
the war with dazzling speed. His
four reasons for "increasing an
guish" are followed by his six
refutations of mistaken assump
tions which precede his three
examples of the credibility gap,
his four steps to negotiation and
his five "tasks for churches and
synagogues."
The arguments are sound and
convincing. They are not new.
But perhaps, this book will reach
and convince some who have not
read Schlesinger and Draper and
Goodwin. Until the arguments
are heeded they deserve to be
repeated.
Brown, Heschel, and Novak
have done it well.

It's not the kind of book one expects from a
Protestant theologian, a Jewish rabbi, and a
well-known Catholic author. But when the trio
consists of Robert McAfee Brown, Abraham
Heschel, and Michael Novak, perhaps one
should.
"If it seems to some readers that a book ad
dressed to the churches and synagogues should
be more 'religious' in tone and vocabulary, we
can only respond that any discussion of how
men live and die is a theological, moral, and re
ligious discussion, regardless of phraseology,"
the authors state in the preface.
The book, written as a result of the two-day
meeting of clergy and laymen in Washington
last January to protest the Vietnam war, con
sists of three essays, all urging an end to the
bombing and a negotiated settlement—"Peace
without Victory."
Novak begins the book with a thumbnail
historical sketch of U.S. foreign policy and in
volvement in Vietnam. Heschel writes a brief
and emotional essay against "The Moral Out
rage of Vietnam" ("It is not for man to decide
who shall live and who shall die, who shall kill
and who shall sigh"), and Brown outlines a
program for negotiation and disengagement,
ending with a plea to the churches and syna
gogues to "register an outcry that cannot be
ignored."
Novak and Brown deal overwhelmingly
with political questions, for the most part con-
vincingly. Both have done their
homework carefully, and their
essays bristle with quotations
from journals like the New
York Times, Newsweek, and
Commentary, and writers like
Goodwin and Theodore Draper;
Schlesinger's Bitter Heritage is
frequently cited too.
Novak tells well the now-fam
iliar story of how the U.S. met
political failure with military
escalation. He lashes out anew
at the already tattered explana
tions for the continued bombing
of the north, and enumerates
the jumbled rationale for the
ever-deepening U.S. involvement
in the south.
Brown, too, runs through the
inventory of arguments against
the war with dazzling speed. His
four reasons for "increasing an
guish" are followed by his six
refutations of mistaken assump
tions which precede his three
examples of the credibility gap,
his four steps to negotiation and
his five "tasks for churches and
synagogues."
The arguments are sound and
convincing. They are not new.
But perhaps, this book will reach
and convince some who have not
read Schlesinger and Draper and
Goodwin. Until the arguments
are heeded they deserve to be
repeated.
Brown, Heschel, and Novak
have done it well.

Vietnam: Crisis of Conscience, Robert McAfee
Brown, Abraham J. Heschel, Michael Novak;
Association Press, Behrman House, Herder
and Herder, New York.
It is a comment of sorts on our secular society
when a book on the moral implications of the
Vietnam war by three well-known religious
leaders contains four times as many citations
from the New York Times as from the Scrip
tures.
For Vietnam: Crisis of Conscience owes far
more to Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. and Richard
Goodwin than to St. Augustine, Erasmus or
Reinhold Niebuhr.
