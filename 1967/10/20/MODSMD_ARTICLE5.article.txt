# The 						singing rains of Cherbourg
## 
### 
A little film has forced its way
into the dry California sunlight.
Suddenly, the silent, white
screen is captured and the flat
surface space transformed into
an imbroglio of sound and color.
There is color everywhere —
color and order. Everything
seems so easy. The music is
hauntingly simple as are the
words of the songs that are sung,
the way songs are sung, not the
way words are spoken.
"Oh, no," one might say, and
has said, "this is a film?!" But
relax, sit back and enjoy for a
moment or two or an hour or
three what the French have to
say, to sing.
"Je t'aime, Guy." "Je t'aime,
Frangoise." A moment of peace,
a moment of love, lost upon leav
ing, leaving. For war. And then
through the sound of a parting
train the song of the rain, of
the rain that brings the flowers,
of the flowers that bring the
spring of new years of new life.
Frangoise is pregnant.
"How did it happen, mon en
fant?" "In the usual way, mar
man." Tradition. Marriage. Hus
band (rich). Home. Frangoise is
reasonable. "I do."

Let Guy return and find an
other. And guess what? Then it
is spring, the spring of new
life, of new faces. Guy is happy
and Frangoise is content.
No dramatic, cinematographic
innovations will you find, nor did

I. But see and hear the calm
possession the French have in
the way they make films that
say, that sing in a pretty way
in a pretty lovely way that life
is as it is as it is as it is.
