# It's been good to know ya....'

THERE you are, sittin' in the dark, it bein'
midnight inside the theater and the stage
all half-lit down below; and one, two gui
tars and a banjo on the scarred old table with
its pitcher of water for their throats; and a
curve of straight back chairs that pretty soon
get filled by people who knew him, and who've
come to sing his songs and some of their own
that he liked or would have. Woody Guthrie died
about 3 weeks ago, in case you hadn't heard.
Every pretty girl's old grey lovin' father, Will
Geer, was readin' Guthrie's words, and we all
sat knowin' that we were being part of some
thing special. Woody Guthrie was dead, sure.
But he was alive, just as sure; right there in the
old Geary theater.
It'd be easy just to tell what songs of his got
sung, and by whom. But what's harder and bet
ter is what it was about those songs and those
people that let you believe that the best thing
in the world is to be alive and workin' hard and
buildin' and bein' free. It's hard to say and
it's worse to theorize. But it had somethin* to do
with bein' able to sing along to a song you for
sure had never heard before. And findin' out
that you knew Woody Guthrie for a friend a
long time before you had ever heard of him.
And feelin' that tingle every four or five minutes
that you used to feel around the Star-Spangled
Banner and the high school fight song; only the
Guthrie tingle went deep, right down through
your pelvis and back up to your eyes which
were occasionally waterin'.
Those songs made you remember how wild
you believed you were once upon a Tuolumne

Meadow; and how unafraid you are or can be of
anything and everything in this bullyin', beat
you-down world; and make all the current event
crap seem like a chance to do somethin' about
it.
You'd sit and feel Malvina Reynolds who's
old enough to be your mother, if not your grand
mother; and listen to her introduce herself as
"someone who writes songs and makes won
derful cookies," which Guthrie liked even more
than her songs, if that's possible.
And you'd sit warmly, not surprised at all but
pleased, as that incredible black-haired girl pop
ped onto the stage and introduced herself as
Mimi Farina's sister, with whom she sang a
love song duet.
And watch and hear Gil Turner and some
fantastic urban corduroy cowboy flat- and finger
pick through "Hard Travellin' " until your foot'd
cramp and your hands'd hurt. And it was the
best feelin' foot cramp you ever had.
And your eyes watered some once more when
Mark Spoelstra sang "He Was A Friend Of
Mine."
But it wasn't all nasal twang, hammerin'-on
and blues wiggles either. Sittin' up on the stage
were union men, the organizers who'd been with
him, and who knew a lot about somethin' par
ticular that was pretty far away from the singin'
and the youngness that mostly filled the audi
ence.
And there was the one time when Mr. Paul
Robinson, an old composer friend of Guthrie's
was singin' his old-fashioned patriotic song
about America and some bastard all of a sud
den yelled "where's Bob Dylan" in the silence
and was booed and hissed by all the people;
but you still wanted to bash his teeth in be
cause he'd hurt Mr. Robinson's feelings.
But it kept on goin' and they took us with
Guthrie from Texas dust and Oklahoma crimi
nals out to California. ("John Steinbeck country
when he used to be a humanist," quoth Will
Geer), through the Pacific Northwest across
the rivers, into the unions, in bed with the wom
en, through the orchards and back to his hos
pital bed in New York.
And when three a.m. rolled around you wore
still willin' to stay, and wished liked hell that
you'd been born a migrant worker, without the
bourgeois blues; but you weren't and you've
got'em. But if you really understand what he
and they have been singin' you know that bein'
bouregois isn't an irrevocable birth defect and
just bein' you can be pretty exciting, too.
And about that time you think about Woody
Guthrie's first son bein' born just after—and
then dyin' — in an automobile accident 21 years
later and Guthrie lyin' in bed with only an al
most voice for nearly the last ten years of his
life, and still able to think and feel, if not sing,
"so long it's been good to know ya," for the
very last time without the least bit of bitter
irony.

best feelin' foot cramp you ever had.
And your eyes watered some once more when
Mark Spoelstra sang "He Was A Friend Of
Mine."
But it wasn't all nasal twang, hammerin'-on
and blues wiggles either. Sittin' up on the stage
were union men, the organizers who'd been with
him, and who knew a lot about somethin' par
ticular that was pretty far away from the singin'
and the youngness that mostly filled the audi
ence.
And there was the one time when Mr. Paul
Robinson, an old composer friend of Guthrie's
was singin' his old-fashioned patriotic song
about America and some bastard all of a sud
den yelled "where's Bob Dylan" in the silence
and was booed and hissed by all the people;
but you still wanted to bash his teeth in be
cause he'd hurt Mr. Robinson's feelings.
But it kept on goin' and they took us with
Guthrie from Texas dust and Oklahoma crimi
nals out to California. ("John Steinbeck country
when he used to be a humanist," quoth Will
Geer), through the Pacific Northwest across
the rivers, into the unions, in bed with the wom
en, through the orchards and back to his hos
pital bed in New York.
And when three a.m. rolled around you wore
still willin' to stay, and wished liked hell that
you'd been born a migrant worker, without the
bourgeois blues; but you weren't and you've
got'em. But if you really understand what he
and they have been singin' you know that bein'
bouregois isn't an irrevocable birth defect and
just bein' you can be pretty exciting, too.
And about that time you think about Woody
Guthrie's first son bein' born just after—and
then dyin' — in an automobile accident 21 years
later and Guthrie lyin' in bed with only an al
most voice for nearly the last ten years of his
life, and still able to think and feel, if not sing,
"so long it's been good to know ya," for the
very last time without the least bit of bitter
irony.

Will Geer narrated the "Woody Guthrie
Midnight Memorial" presented last Fri
day by the ACT.
THERE you are, sittin' in the dark, it bein'
midnight inside the theater and the stage
all half-lit down below; and one, two gui
tars and a banjo on the scarred old table with
its pitcher of water for their throats; and a
curve of straight back chairs that pretty soon
get filled by people who knew him, and who've
come to sing his songs and some of their own
that he liked or would have. Woody Guthrie died
about 3 weeks ago, in case you hadn't heard.
Every pretty girl's old grey lovin' father, Will
Geer, was readin' Guthrie's words, and we all
sat knowin' that we were being part of some
thing special. Woody Guthrie was dead, sure.
But he was alive, just as sure; right there in the
old Geary theater.
It'd be easy just to tell what songs of his got
sung, and by whom. But what's harder and bet
ter is what it was about those songs and those
people that let you believe that the best thing
in the world is to be alive and workin' hard and
buildin' and bein' free. It's hard to say and
it's worse to theorize. But it had somethin* to do
with bein' able to sing along to a song you for
sure had never heard before. And findin' out
that you knew Woody Guthrie for a friend a
long time before you had ever heard of him.
And feelin' that tingle every four or five minutes
that you used to feel around the Star-Spangled
Banner and the high school fight song; only the
Guthrie tingle went deep, right down through
your pelvis and back up to your eyes which
were occasionally waterin'.
Those songs made you remember how wild
you believed you were once upon a Tuolumne

Meadow; and how unafraid you are or can be of
anything and everything in this bullyin', beat
you-down world; and make all the current event
crap seem like a chance to do somethin' about
it.
You'd sit and feel Malvina Reynolds who's
old enough to be your mother, if not your grand
mother; and listen to her introduce herself as
"someone who writes songs and makes won
derful cookies," which Guthrie liked even more
than her songs, if that's possible.
And you'd sit warmly, not surprised at all but
pleased, as that incredible black-haired girl pop
ped onto the stage and introduced herself as
Mimi Farina's sister, with whom she sang a
love song duet.
And watch and hear Gil Turner and some
fantastic urban corduroy cowboy flat- and finger
pick through "Hard Travellin' " until your foot'd
cramp and your hands'd hurt. And it was the
best feelin' foot cramp you ever had.

that he liked or would have. Woody Guthrie died
about 3 weeks ago, in case you hadn't heard.
Every pretty girl's old grey lovin' father, Will
Geer, was readin' Guthrie's words, and we all
sat knowin' that we were being part of some
thing special. Woody Guthrie was dead, sure.
But he was alive, just as sure; right there in the
old Geary theater.
It'd be easy just to tell what songs of his got
sung, and by whom. But what's harder and bet
ter is what it was about those songs and those
people that let you believe that the best thing
in the world is to be alive and workin' hard and
buildin' and bein' free. It's hard to say and
it's worse to theorize. But it had somethin* to do
with bein' able to sing along to a song you for
sure had never heard before. And findin' out
that you knew Woody Guthrie for a friend a
long time before you had ever heard of him.
And feelin' that tingle every four or five minutes
that you used to feel around the Star-Spangled
Banner and the high school fight song; only the
Guthrie tingle went deep, right down through
your pelvis and back up to your eyes which
were occasionally waterin'.
Those songs made you remember how wild
you believed you were once upon a Tuolumne

Meadow; and how unafraid you are or can be of
anything and everything in this bullyin', beat
you-down world; and make all the current event
crap seem like a chance to do somethin' about
it.
You'd sit and feel Malvina Reynolds who's
old enough to be your mother, if not your grand
mother; and listen to her introduce herself as
"someone who writes songs and makes won
derful cookies," which Guthrie liked even more
than her songs, if that's possible.
And you'd sit warmly, not surprised at all but
pleased, as that incredible black-haired girl pop
ped onto the stage and introduced herself as
Mimi Farina's sister, with whom she sang a
love song duet.
And watch and hear Gil Turner and some
fantastic urban corduroy cowboy flat- and finger
pick through "Hard Travellin' " until your foot'd
cramp and your hands'd hurt. And it was the
best feelin' foot cramp you ever had.
And your eyes watered some once more when
Mark Spoelstra sang "He Was A Friend Of
Mine."
But it wasn't all nasal twang, hammerin'-on
and blues wiggles either. Sittin' up on the stage
were union men, the organizers who'd been with
him, and who knew a lot about somethin' par
ticular that was pretty far away from the singin'
and the youngness that mostly filled the audi
ence.
And there was the one time when Mr. Paul
Robinson, an old composer friend of Guthrie's
was singin' his old-fashioned patriotic song
about America and some bastard all of a sud
den yelled "where's Bob Dylan" in the silence
and was booed and hissed by all the people;
but you still wanted to bash his teeth in be
cause he'd hurt Mr. Robinson's feelings.
But it kept on goin' and they took us with
Guthrie from Texas dust and Oklahoma crimi
nals out to California. ("John Steinbeck country
when he used to be a humanist," quoth Will
Geer), through the Pacific Northwest across
the rivers, into the unions, in bed with the wom
en, through the orchards and back to his hos
pital bed in New York.
And when three a.m. rolled around you wore
still willin' to stay, and wished liked hell that
you'd been born a migrant worker, without the
bourgeois blues; but you weren't and you've
got'em. But if you really understand what he
and they have been singin' you know that bein'
bouregois isn't an irrevocable birth defect and
just bein' you can be pretty exciting, too.
And about that time you think about Woody
Guthrie's first son bein' born just after—and
then dyin' — in an automobile accident 21 years
later and Guthrie lyin' in bed with only an al
most voice for nearly the last ten years of his
life, and still able to think and feel, if not sing,
"so long it's been good to know ya," for the
very last time without the least bit of bitter
irony.

Will Geer narrated the "Woody Guthrie
Midnight Memorial" presented last Fri
day by the ACT.
THERE you are, sittin' in the dark, it bein'
midnight inside the theater and the stage
all half-lit down below; and one, two gui
tars and a banjo on the scarred old table with
its pitcher of water for their throats; and a
curve of straight back chairs that pretty soon
get filled by people who knew him, and who've
come to sing his songs and some of their own
that he liked or would have. Woody Guthrie died
