Tonight's entry in the Tresidder Friday Night
Film Series is one of the quarter's highlights.
It is Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura
(1960), which begins with a red-herring dis
appearance of the supposed heroine and then
proceeds with a supurb delineation of human
betrayal and ultimate self-acceptance. Since
this film was made, Antonioni's reputation has
soared; but his ability to create cinematic art
has never been more evidenced than in L'Av
ventura. Tomorrow night Tresidder will pre
sent a series of American films featuring screcn
idols of the past forty years, beginning with a
1920 movie called Dancing Mothers.
This week the Sunday Night Flicks is featur
ing Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Mike
Nichol's faithful screen adaptation of Edward
Albee's tense drama. For those of you who have
seen it already, it will be interesting to observe
what the Flick's crowd does with it.
