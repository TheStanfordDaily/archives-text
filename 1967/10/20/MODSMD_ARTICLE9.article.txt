# Lennon is straight in new war film
## 
### 
With so many films today like The Dirty
Dozen, or the Battle of the Bulge, we often
find ourselves glorifying war and its partici
pants. Director Richard Lester's new film How
I Won the War will not end the production of
these third rate thrillers of blood and gore. It
will, however, add a new dimension to war
movies.
The film is based on the memoirs of a young
inept army officer Lieutenant Goodbody.
played by Michael Crawford. It deals with his
eight-man platoon, describing their individual
experiences and thoughts during the Second
World War. In a completely straight role John
Lennon plays Gripweed, a faithful officer's ser
vant. Each of the other platoon members rep
resents another definite stereotype.
We first see the platoon on a night operation
in Germany during the end of the war. Craw
ford ends up alone in a raft that is rapidly trav
eling down the Rhine, while the other members
of the platoon jit on the shore, having refused
to follow their commander. The film then
flashes back to a cricket game in London where
we are introduced to all the men as civilians
before the war. We then return to the first ac
tion the platoon faces in North Africa, where
they travel behind the enemy lines to secure
an oasis for a cricket match.
To this point the film is most comical. How
ever as Crawford's group moves forward, they
run into Lieutenant Colonel Grapple—"Grap
ple of the Bedoo ... "veteran of every war that
ever was or ever will be." As the two units move
toward each other Grapple's car strikes a land
mine. While the car and his two staff members
burn, Grapple neatly dusts himself and walks
off. Earlier in the movie Grapple cautions
Goodbody to hold the trenches, and to break
through with sword and lance. The film
throughout is an almost perfect mixture of
slapstick and horror, that produces a tragic
comedy of tremendous emotional impact.
Lester stated that he . . wanted to try to
attack all myths and sham heroics of real war
as it has hitherto been done on the screen." He
tried to create a pacifistic film, "I wanted to
show war without kicks, and without the nos
talgia that those who have fought wars and
survived usually impart to their own memories.
I wanted to show the dishonesty that history
gives to the reason we fight wars and unfairness
of a Government that asks its subjects to enter
a war for one reason and then justifies that war
with a totally different reason after it is over."
He has suceeded.
Much of the film is shot in a newsreel manner
or is actual footage from the war, presented in
flashbacks. During one of the platoons first
battles there is a cut to some silent film of the
battle of Dunkirk. Lester also makes maximum
use of color filters.
All in all, this is perhaps the finest picture
I have seen in my many years. It combines ex
cellent acting and photography with biting
social criticism and valuable insights. The film
is the epitome of good cinema, it engages the
audience and still delivers a subtle social cri
tique.
So often today a movie either tells a story
that we soon forget or it is so garbled that we
assume that meaning must be buried in its
complexity. How I Won the War, which opens
Wednesday at the Altos International, falls into
neither trap. Many may challenge the film's
pacifist slant, but it is a movie that everyone
should see.
