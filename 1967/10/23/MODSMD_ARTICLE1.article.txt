# CCD Plans To 'Dump LBJ'

### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Allard Lowenstein, former
Stanford political science pro
fessor and dean, and national
co-chairman of the Conference
of Concerned Democrats (CCD)
spoke on the organization of a
"Dump Johnson" campaign in
Cubberley Auditorium last night.
Lowenstein discussed plans to
run slates of delegates against
President Johnson in various
open primaries. Proposals for
action in California received
special attention.
The CCD is trying to defeat
Johnson in the primaries and
have the national convention
nominate a candidate who is
committed to the goals of the
organization: ending the war in
Vietnam, reordering national
priorities, easing the racial prob
lems in the U.S., and cleaning
up the cities.
Lowenstein remarked that
Johnson "has achieved what he
set out to achieve, and that is
to become a great consensus
president. And the consensus
that everyone has reached is
that they want to get rid of
him."
Little Johnson Support
He said that he had been
traveling around the country,
and nowhere he went was there
a majority of people who
wanted Johnson renominated.
A major Dump Johnson rally

at Stanford is tentatively plan
ned for January.
Lowenstein stated that the
CCD had originally planned to
run uncommitted delegates
against President Johnson in
early primaries.
If these tickets did well, they
hoped they would then get sup
port from major Democrats
whom they could run in later
primaries.
But now, according to Lowen
stein, there is a good chance
that the CCD will be able to run
a peace candidate in all pri
maries.
Good Showing' Important
He also noted that it was im
portant for the CCD tickets to
run well in all voting even if
they do not win. A poor show
ing, Lowenstein noted, would,
besides assuring Johnson's re
nomination, discourage Republi
cans from nominating a dove.
Republican liberals such as
Percy and Gavin have already
been contacted by the group.
Possible candidates that the
CCD may endorse are Senators
Frank Church (Idaho), Vance
Hartke (Indiana), Eugene Mc-
Carthy (Minnesota), and George
McGovern (South Dakota).
New York's junior senator,
Robert Kennedy, is not pres
ently being considered as a can
didate because of his continuous
support for President Johnson.
