## ROTC Noble Guardian Of The American Way Of Life?

JSditor, The Daily:
• Why did I join R.0.T.C.? This
Is a question I think each cadet
should ask himself, and if he
cannot answer it he should with
draw himself from the program.
There should be no student in
the program that does not un
derstand why he is there.
I spent a tremendous amount
of time deciding if I should join
R.O.T.C. I finally decided that
R.O.T.C. was my choice.
The reason why I joined re
duces to one basic answer: I was
born an American citizen, a fact
I am extremely thankful for.
Many citizens of the world are
never blessed in this respect.
I joined not only because I am
an American, but because I be
lieve in the ideals of democracy:
in justice, in equal opportunity
to excell, and in happiness and
jreedom for all.
True Believer?
, Many of my fellow citizens
seem to be anti-American at the
frioment, yet are they really? Do
they believe in freedom and
democracy? I feel they do, and
this is demonstrated in their de
sire for justice and equality.
These individuals want the
United States out of Vietnam,
yet they offer no alternative for
the solution of preserving the
freedoms of our own country.
! The men who are represent
ing the citizens of the United
States in Vietnam are there in
order to preserve the freedoms
of,the very individuals who are
demonstrating against them.
They are fighting so that these
dissident citizens will still have
the right to demonstrate against
a war that is allowing them to
demonstrate.
This seems ironic since the
dissenters are in fact demon
strating against the very rights
they supposedly believe in. I be
lieve in the right to dissent, and

because of this and other Amer
ican ideals I am willing to serve
my country to keep these values
for all citizens regardless of
their loyalty.
Future Right to Dissent
To those who feel the United
States should get out of Viet
nam I only say: do you want the
right to peacefully dissent from
the position of your government
twenty years from now? If these
individuals do, then they should
have no doubts in their minds
why the United States is in Viet
nam, or why I am enrolled in
R.O.T.C.
The decision is the individual's,
and in America he still has that
choice. The choice is whether
the individual is going to accept
the responsibilities of his citizen
ship or to avoid them, and ig
nore the fact that he was born
in the United States. For democ
racy to function the individual
must be an active participant in
society. If the individual is
against preserving the right to
participate in democracy he
should remove himself from
that society.
I do not debase those who are
opposed to the Vietnam war. I
hate war as much as anyone,
and I feel certain that none of
the men fighting in Vietnam en
joy war. The military is as
against war as any organiza
tion, yet it recognizes war as the
only way that the citizens of the
United States can preserve their
freedom until man learns to live
in peace.
Man has, through time, strug
gled for power, and until under
standing between countries is
achieved war will predominate.
As long as this country strug
gles to preserve the freedom of
the individual I feel I am obli
gated, as a citizen, to be an ac
tive participant in preserving
these ideals of democracy for all

citizens.
For me this duty lies in
R.0.T.C., for I believe my coun
try can best benefit from my
services as an officer. There is
no disgrace for those who find
other ways to serving their
country. The choice is the indi
viduals: accept the responsibili
ties of citizenship or shrink from
them.

Editor, The Daily:
What I want from a campus
newspaper is campus news ...
not the kind of purple prose and
emotional editorializing dished
out daily in your coverage of
the Oakland orgy.
Your protesting buddies got
about what they deserved. And
I hope they continue to get it.
Sit-ins, protests, marches, and
non-violence have served well
the causes of independence and
civil rights, but the foolishness
displayed in attempting to close
the Oakland Induction Center
warrants neither press coverage,
nor support, nor respect.
There are many people not in
love with the war in Vietnam,
but the Oakland brand of ir
responsibility is not the way to
either improve, or change, U.S.
policy.

demonstrating against them.
They are fighting so that these
dissident citizens will still have
the right to demonstrate against
a war that is allowing them to
demonstrate.
This seems ironic since the
dissenters are in fact demon
strating against the very rights
they supposedly believe in. I be
lieve in the right to dissent, and

because of this and other Amer
ican ideals I am willing to serve
my country to keep these values
for all citizens regardless of
their loyalty.
Future Right to Dissent
To those who feel the United
States should get out of Viet
nam I only say: do you want the
right to peacefully dissent from
the position of your government
twenty years from now? If these
individuals do, then they should
have no doubts in their minds
why the United States is in Viet
nam, or why I am enrolled in
R.O.T.C.
The decision is the individual's,
and in America he still has that
choice. The choice is whether
the individual is going to accept
the responsibilities of his citizen
ship or to avoid them, and ig
nore the fact that he was born
in the United States. For democ
racy to function the individual
must be an active participant in
society. If the individual is
against preserving the right to
participate in democracy he
should remove himself from
that society.
I do not debase those who are
opposed to the Vietnam war. I
hate war as much as anyone,
and I feel certain that none of
the men fighting in Vietnam en
joy war. The military is as
against war as any organiza
tion, yet it recognizes war as the
only way that the citizens of the
United States can preserve their
freedom until man learns to live
in peace.
Man has, through time, strug
gled for power, and until under
standing between countries is
achieved war will predominate.
As long as this country strug
gles to preserve the freedom of
the individual I feel I am obli
gated, as a citizen, to be an ac
tive participant in preserving
these ideals of democracy for all

citizens.
For me this duty lies in
R.0.T.C., for I believe my coun
try can best benefit from my
services as an officer. There is
no disgrace for those who find
other ways to serving their
country. The choice is the indi
viduals: accept the responsibili
ties of citizenship or shrink from
them.

What I want from a campus
newspaper is campus news ...
not the kind of purple prose and
emotional editorializing dished
out daily in your coverage of
the Oakland orgy.
Your protesting buddies got
about what they deserved. And
I hope they continue to get it.
Sit-ins, protests, marches, and
non-violence have served well
the causes of independence and
civil rights, but the foolishness
displayed in attempting to close
the Oakland Induction Center
warrants neither press coverage,
nor support, nor respect.
There are many people not in
love with the war in Vietnam,
but the Oakland brand of ir
responsibility is not the way to
either improve, or change, U.S.
policy.

I am extremely thankful for.

never blessed in this respect.

in justice, in equal opportunity

seem to be anti-American at the

they believe in freedom and

the men fighting in Vietnam en
joy war. The military is as
against war as any organiza
tion, yet it recognizes war as the
only way that the citizens of the
United States can preserve their
freedom until man learns to live
in peace.
Man has, through time, strug
gled for power, and until under
standing between countries is
achieved war will predominate.
As long as this country strug
gles to preserve the freedom of
the individual I feel I am obli
gated, as a citizen, to be an ac
tive participant in preserving
these ideals of democracy for all

citizens.
For me this duty lies in
R.0.T.C., for I believe my coun
try can best benefit from my
services as an officer. There is
no disgrace for those who find
other ways to serving their
country. The choice is the indi
viduals: accept the responsibili
ties of citizenship or shrink from
them.

Editor, The Daily:
What I want from a campus
newspaper is campus news ...
not the kind of purple prose and
emotional editorializing dished
out daily in your coverage of
the Oakland orgy.
Your protesting buddies got
about what they deserved. And
I hope they continue to get it.
Sit-ins, protests, marches, and
non-violence have served well
the causes of independence and
civil rights, but the foolishness
displayed in attempting to close
the Oakland Induction Center
warrants neither press coverage,
nor support, nor respect.
There are many people not in
love with the war in Vietnam,
but the Oakland brand of ir
responsibility is not the way to
either improve, or change, U.S.
policy.

• Amazing!
Editor, The Daily:
It amazes me—in reading your
paper—that you, in describing
the Oakland demonstrations, ig
nore the principles of Law &
Order as though you never heard
of them.
Perhaps you could use some
Law student on your Staff. Or is
yours a propaganda sheet?

JSditor, The Daily:
• Why did I join R.0.T.C.? This
Is a question I think each cadet
should ask himself, and if he
cannot answer it he should with
draw himself from the program.
There should be no student in
the program that does not un
derstand why he is there.
I spent a tremendous amount
of time deciding if I should join
R.O.T.C. I finally decided that
R.O.T.C. was my choice.
The reason why I joined re
duces to one basic answer: I was
born an American citizen, a fact
I am extremely thankful for.
Many citizens of the world are
never blessed in this respect.
I joined not only because I am
an American, but because I be
lieve in the ideals of democracy:
in justice, in equal opportunity
to excell, and in happiness and
jreedom for all.
True Believer?
, Many of my fellow citizens
seem to be anti-American at the
frioment, yet are they really? Do
they believe in freedom and
democracy? I feel they do, and
this is demonstrated in their de
sire for justice and equality.
These individuals want the
United States out of Vietnam,
yet they offer no alternative for
the solution of preserving the
freedoms of our own country.
! The men who are represent
ing the citizens of the United
States in Vietnam are there in
order to preserve the freedoms
of,the very individuals who are
demonstrating against them.
They are fighting so that these
dissident citizens will still have
the right to demonstrate against
a war that is allowing them to
demonstrate.
This seems ironic since the
dissenters are in fact demon
strating against the very rights
they supposedly believe in. I be
lieve in the right to dissent, and

because of this and other Amer
ican ideals I am willing to serve
my country to keep these values
for all citizens regardless of
their loyalty.
Future Right to Dissent
To those who feel the United
States should get out of Viet
nam I only say: do you want the
right to peacefully dissent from
the position of your government
twenty years from now? If these
individuals do, then they should
have no doubts in their minds
why the United States is in Viet
nam, or why I am enrolled in
R.O.T.C.
The decision is the individual's,
and in America he still has that
choice. The choice is whether
the individual is going to accept
the responsibilities of his citizen
ship or to avoid them, and ig
nore the fact that he was born
in the United States. For democ
racy to function the individual
must be an active participant in
society. If the individual is
against preserving the right to
participate in democracy he
should remove himself from
that society.
I do not debase those who are
opposed to the Vietnam war. I
hate war as much as anyone,
and I feel certain that none of
the men fighting in Vietnam en
joy war. The military is as
against war as any organiza
tion, yet it recognizes war as the
only way that the citizens of the
United States can preserve their
