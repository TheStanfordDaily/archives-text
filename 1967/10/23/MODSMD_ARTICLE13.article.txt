# Oakland's Tuesday & Friday
## 
### TIM HAIGHT 
After Tuesday, the demon
strators at the Oakland Induc
tion Terminal were ambivalent.
They were not prepared for vio
lence, but they were frustrated
with non-violence's ineffective
ness. One observer has used the
phrase "impotent rage."
On Tuesday this impotent
rage had led to hysteria, the
singling out of strange objects

for attack, and a new hatred of
the system. It had also built up
a need for a victory.
Some say Friday was that vic
tory. The police, so brutal on
Tuesday, were held in check this
time —most likely because of the
tremendous criticism they re
ceived in the press. The demon
strators, for their part, had
altered their tactics, maximiz
ing the area the police would
have to patrol and minimizing
the cops' opportunity to club
people.
Nobody would sit down; on
Tuesday the police had not let
them up. Everybody would
spread out and block the streets
with moving people or with
cars. When the police advanced,
the pickets would retreat; when
the police retreated, the pickets
would advance. It was a page
from Vo Nguyen Giap, Ameri
can-style.
Thrill Of Power
As a tactic, it served better
than Tuesday's disorder. Less
people were clubbed and the
busses arrived one hour later
than before. The demonstrators
had tied up 2000 police in the
process. Further, the protesters
had felt the thrill of power.
When they read the papers
chronicling the event, they could
feel they had "done something."
But now, with this week of
protest behind us, we have to

ask whether this new tactic that
has evolved has a future. Cer
tainly it had value Friday, in
contrast to Tuesday, but before
we decide whether or not it is
to be used again we must con
sider the long-range conse
quences.
Those consequences fall into
basically three categories: First,
what will the effect of this tactic
be o"n the authorities that run
the war and their local enforc
ers, the cops? Second, what will
this tactic do to American opin
ion about the war? Third, what
is the value of this tactic as a
unifying or organizing device
within the pretest movement?
Oakland's Costs
Certainly, these protests are
costly to the authorities. The
Oakland police have estimated
that the cost in extra man-hours
and related costs for last week's
activity will reach $200,000.
Clearly, the authorities will not
tolerate extensive repetition of
last week.
On Friday, the police were not
too violent for the new tactic
to succeed, but Tuesday showed
us they could become so. Their
becoming so would depend on
the public's attitude, press cov
erage, and the cost involved.
And next time, if the police felt
justified enough and free
enough, a blood bath could hap
pen.
What about the American
public? Will they condone or
demand the cops' crushing the
next manifestation? Will they
change their opinions about the
war because of the demonstra
tions? It is too soon to tell. An
educated guess, however, says
that while feelings about dem
onstrators will rise on both com
mited sides, few opinions will
change.
Police Redeemed
The Oakland police have, to
some measure, "redeemed them
selves" in the eyes of many by
their restraint on Friday. The
Chronicle, who editorialized

strongly against the police on
Thursday, was quite favorable
toward them on Saturday.
Since Friday climaxed the ac
tivity at Oakland, it is very pos
sible that the brutality of Tues
day, the draft-card turn-ins of
Monday, and the non-violent
demonstrations of Monday, Wed
nesday, and Thursday, will be
lost in the public memory.
All this was, one may suspect,
anticipated by the militant lead
ership. They have felt that the
appeal to the American con
science implicit in non-violent
tactics was futile. Americans
are fat, complacent, and uncar
ing. They must be coerced, not
converted. This is war. Other
tactics have been tried, they
say. All that remains is violence.
Recruiting: Value
But if what the American
public and the police think is
unimportant, what the members
of the movement think is not.
On Tuesday, people were horri
fied with what they saw, and
many were ready to do any
thing. That demonstration had
recruiting value.
But what about Friday? One
non-violent critic of that dem
onstration said, "It allows them
to be pseudo-guerrillas on week
ends but stay clean with the
authorities. Most of the non-vio
lent leadership is in jail now.
How many of the violent leaders
are? Damn few."
And what was the mood of the
crowd? As an eyewitness, this

reporter can say that pure com
mitment was not the dominant
feature. A lot of people were
just followers. That's no sur
prise. But the aura of meaning
that some demonstrations in the
past had was covered by the all
pervasive odor of violence.
The Reality Of Force
Police violence was respons
ible in part, but in the South—
where the police were just as
violent—something else came
through, even on TV. Perhaps
that was because the violence
was so one sided, and by choice
rather than simply the reality of
force. How many doubt that if
some of the demonstrators had
had a magic wand to kill all the
cops with, it would have been
used?
The significance of that new
violence is that it is still sup
posed to be used for peace. We
have all been brought up Ameri
can and Communist agitprop
parodies of peace. Everybody is
for peace, there just isn't any.
For those in the movement
who have an ideology to get
them through thick and thin,
this contradiction between vio
lent tactic and the will for peace
will pose no problem. For the
rest, it might.
A new tactic is born, out of
frustration andimpotent rage. It
has won a victory, if you ask
its inventors. Asking others
may produce other answers, but
the leaders of the protest move
ment probably aren't listening.

rage had led to hysteria, the
singling out of strange objects

for attack, and a new hatred of
the system. It had also built up
a need for a victory.
Some say Friday was that vic
tory. The police, so brutal on
Tuesday, were held in check this
time —most likely because of the
tremendous criticism they re
ceived in the press. The demon
strators, for their part, had
altered their tactics, maximiz
ing the area the police would
have to patrol and minimizing
the cops' opportunity to club
people.
Nobody would sit down; on
Tuesday the police had not let
them up. Everybody would
spread out and block the streets
with moving people or with
cars. When the police advanced,
the pickets would retreat; when
the police retreated, the pickets
would advance. It was a page
from Vo Nguyen Giap, Ameri
can-style.
Thrill Of Power
As a tactic, it served better
than Tuesday's disorder. Less
people were clubbed and the
busses arrived one hour later
than before. The demonstrators
had tied up 2000 police in the
process. Further, the protesters
had felt the thrill of power.
When they read the papers
chronicling the event, they could
feel they had "done something."
But now, with this week of
protest behind us, we have to

ask whether this new tactic that
has evolved has a future. Cer
tainly it had value Friday, in
contrast to Tuesday, but before
we decide whether or not it is
to be used again we must con
sider the long-range conse
quences.
Those consequences fall into
basically three categories: First,
what will the effect of this tactic
be o"n the authorities that run
the war and their local enforc
ers, the cops? Second, what will
this tactic do to American opin
ion about the war? Third, what
is the value of this tactic as a
unifying or organizing device
within the pretest movement?
Oakland's Costs
Certainly, these protests are
costly to the authorities. The
Oakland police have estimated
that the cost in extra man-hours
and related costs for last week's
activity will reach $200,000.
Clearly, the authorities will not
tolerate extensive repetition of
last week.
On Friday, the police were not
too violent for the new tactic
to succeed, but Tuesday showed
us they could become so. Their
becoming so would depend on
the public's attitude, press cov
erage, and the cost involved.
And next time, if the police felt
justified enough and free
enough, a blood bath could hap
pen.
What about the American
public? Will they condone or
demand the cops' crushing the
next manifestation? Will they
change their opinions about the
war because of the demonstra
tions? It is too soon to tell. An
educated guess, however, says
that while feelings about dem
onstrators will rise on both com
mited sides, few opinions will
change.
Police Redeemed
The Oakland police have, to
some measure, "redeemed them
selves" in the eyes of many by
their restraint on Friday. The
Chronicle, who editorialized

strongly against the police on
Thursday, was quite favorable
toward them on Saturday.
Since Friday climaxed the ac
tivity at Oakland, it is very pos
sible that the brutality of Tues
day, the draft-card turn-ins of
Monday, and the non-violent
demonstrations of Monday, Wed
nesday, and Thursday, will be
lost in the public memory.
All this was, one may suspect,
anticipated by the militant lead
ership. They have felt that the
appeal to the American con
science implicit in non-violent
tactics was futile. Americans
are fat, complacent, and uncar
ing. They must be coerced, not
converted. This is war. Other
tactics have been tried, they
say. All that remains is violence.
Recruiting: Value
But if what the American
public and the police think is
unimportant, what the members
of the movement think is not.
On Tuesday, people were horri
fied with what they saw, and
many were ready to do any
thing. That demonstration had
recruiting value.
But what about Friday? One
non-violent critic of that dem
onstration said, "It allows them
to be pseudo-guerrillas on week
ends but stay clean with the
authorities. Most of the non-vio
lent leadership is in jail now.
How many of the violent leaders
are? Damn few."
And what was the mood of the
crowd? As an eyewitness, this

reporter can say that pure com
mitment was not the dominant
feature. A lot of people were
just followers. That's no sur
prise. But the aura of meaning
that some demonstrations in the
past had was covered by the all
pervasive odor of violence.
The Reality Of Force
Police violence was respons
ible in part, but in the South—
where the police were just as
violent—something else came
through, even on TV. Perhaps
that was because the violence
was so one sided, and by choice
rather than simply the reality of
force. How many doubt that if
some of the demonstrators had
had a magic wand to kill all the
cops with, it would have been
used?
The significance of that new
violence is that it is still sup
posed to be used for peace. We
have all been brought up Ameri
can and Communist agitprop
parodies of peace. Everybody is
for peace, there just isn't any.
For those in the movement
who have an ideology to get
them through thick and thin,
this contradiction between vio
lent tactic and the will for peace
will pose no problem. For the
rest, it might.
A new tactic is born, out of
frustration andimpotent rage. It
has won a victory, if you ask
its inventors. Asking others
may produce other answers, but
the leaders of the protest move
ment probably aren't listening.

tremendous criticism they re
ceived in the press. The demon
strators, for their part, had
altered their tactics, maximiz
ing the area the police would
have to patrol and minimizing
the cops' opportunity to club
people.
Nobody would sit down; on
Tuesday the police had not let
them up. Everybody would
spread out and block the streets
with moving people or with
cars. When the police advanced,
the pickets would retreat; when
the police retreated, the pickets
would advance. It was a page
from Vo Nguyen Giap, Ameri
can-style.
Thrill Of Power
As a tactic, it served better
than Tuesday's disorder. Less
people were clubbed and the
busses arrived one hour later
than before. The demonstrators
had tied up 2000 police in the
process. Further, the protesters
had felt the thrill of power.
When they read the papers
chronicling the event, they could
feel they had "done something."
But now, with this week of
protest behind us, we have to

ask whether this new tactic that
has evolved has a future. Cer
tainly it had value Friday, in
contrast to Tuesday, but before
we decide whether or not it is
to be used again we must con
sider the long-range conse
quences.
Those consequences fall into
basically three categories: First,
what will the effect of this tactic
be o"n the authorities that run
the war and their local enforc
ers, the cops? Second, what will
this tactic do to American opin
ion about the war? Third, what
is the value of this tactic as a
unifying or organizing device
within the pretest movement?
Oakland's Costs
Certainly, these protests are
costly to the authorities. The
Oakland police have estimated
that the cost in extra man-hours
and related costs for last week's
activity will reach $200,000.
Clearly, the authorities will not
tolerate extensive repetition of
last week.
On Friday, the police were not
too violent for the new tactic
to succeed, but Tuesday showed
us they could become so. Their
becoming so would depend on
the public's attitude, press cov
erage, and the cost involved.
And next time, if the police felt
justified enough and free
enough, a blood bath could hap
pen.
What about the American
public? Will they condone or
demand the cops' crushing the
next manifestation? Will they
change their opinions about the
war because of the demonstra
tions? It is too soon to tell. An
educated guess, however, says
that while feelings about dem
onstrators will rise on both com
mited sides, few opinions will
change.
Police Redeemed
The Oakland police have, to
some measure, "redeemed them
selves" in the eyes of many by
their restraint on Friday. The
Chronicle, who editorialized

strongly against the police on
Thursday, was quite favorable
toward them on Saturday.
Since Friday climaxed the ac
tivity at Oakland, it is very pos
sible that the brutality of Tues
day, the draft-card turn-ins of
Monday, and the non-violent
demonstrations of Monday, Wed
nesday, and Thursday, will be
lost in the public memory.
All this was, one may suspect,
anticipated by the militant lead
ership. They have felt that the
appeal to the American con
science implicit in non-violent
tactics was futile. Americans
are fat, complacent, and uncar
ing. They must be coerced, not
converted. This is war. Other
tactics have been tried, they
say. All that remains is violence.
Recruiting: Value
But if what the American
public and the police think is
unimportant, what the members
of the movement think is not.
On Tuesday, people were horri
fied with what they saw, and
many were ready to do any
thing. That demonstration had
recruiting value.
But what about Friday? One
non-violent critic of that dem
onstration said, "It allows them
to be pseudo-guerrillas on week
ends but stay clean with the
authorities. Most of the non-vio
lent leadership is in jail now.
How many of the violent leaders
are? Damn few."
And what was the mood of the
crowd? As an eyewitness, this

reporter can say that pure com
mitment was not the dominant
feature. A lot of people were
just followers. That's no sur
prise. But the aura of meaning
that some demonstrations in the
past had was covered by the all
pervasive odor of violence.
The Reality Of Force
Police violence was respons
ible in part, but in the South—
where the police were just as
violent—something else came
through, even on TV. Perhaps
that was because the violence
was so one sided, and by choice
rather than simply the reality of
force. How many doubt that if
some of the demonstrators had
had a magic wand to kill all the
cops with, it would have been
used?
The significance of that new
violence is that it is still sup
posed to be used for peace. We
have all been brought up Ameri
can and Communist agitprop
parodies of peace. Everybody is
for peace, there just isn't any.
For those in the movement
who have an ideology to get
them through thick and thin,
this contradiction between vio
lent tactic and the will for peace
will pose no problem. For the
rest, it might.
A new tactic is born, out of
frustration andimpotent rage. It
has won a victory, if you ask
its inventors. Asking others
may produce other answers, but
the leaders of the protest move
ment probably aren't listening.

News Analysis
After Tuesday, the demon
strators at the Oakland Induc
tion Terminal were ambivalent.
They were not prepared for vio
lence, but they were frustrated
with non-violence's ineffective
ness. One observer has used the
phrase "impotent rage."
On Tuesday this impotent
rage had led to hysteria, the
singling out of strange objects

for attack, and a new hatred of
the system. It had also built up
a need for a victory.
Some say Friday was that vic
tory. The police, so brutal on

them up. Everybody would
spread out and block the streets
with moving people or with
cars. When the police advanced,
the pickets would retreat; when
the police retreated, the pickets
would advance. It was a page
from Vo Nguyen Giap, Ameri
can-style.
Thrill Of Power
As a tactic, it served better
than Tuesday's disorder. Less
people were clubbed and the
busses arrived one hour later
than before. The demonstrators
had tied up 2000 police in the
process. Further, the protesters
had felt the thrill of power.
When they read the papers
chronicling the event, they could
feel they had "done something."
But now, with this week of
protest behind us, we have to

ask whether this new tactic that
has evolved has a future. Cer
tainly it had value Friday, in
contrast to Tuesday, but before
we decide whether or not it is
to be used again we must con
sider the long-range conse
quences.
Those consequences fall into
basically three categories: First,
what will the effect of this tactic
be o"n the authorities that run
the war and their local enforc
ers, the cops? Second, what will
this tactic do to American opin
ion about the war? Third, what
is the value of this tactic as a
unifying or organizing device
within the pretest movement?
Oakland's Costs
Certainly, these protests are
costly to the authorities. The
Oakland police have estimated
that the cost in extra man-hours
and related costs for last week's
activity will reach $200,000.
Clearly, the authorities will not
tolerate extensive repetition of
last week.
On Friday, the police were not
too violent for the new tactic
to succeed, but Tuesday showed
us they could become so. Their
becoming so would depend on
the public's attitude, press cov
erage, and the cost involved.
And next time, if the police felt
justified enough and free
enough, a blood bath could hap
pen.
What about the American
public? Will they condone or
demand the cops' crushing the
next manifestation? Will they
change their opinions about the
war because of the demonstra
tions? It is too soon to tell. An
educated guess, however, says
that while feelings about dem
onstrators will rise on both com
mited sides, few opinions will
change.
Police Redeemed
The Oakland police have, to
some measure, "redeemed them
selves" in the eyes of many by
their restraint on Friday. The
Chronicle, who editorialized

strongly against the police on
Thursday, was quite favorable
toward them on Saturday.
Since Friday climaxed the ac
tivity at Oakland, it is very pos
sible that the brutality of Tues
day, the draft-card turn-ins of
Monday, and the non-violent
demonstrations of Monday, Wed
nesday, and Thursday, will be
lost in the public memory.
All this was, one may suspect,
anticipated by the militant lead
ership. They have felt that the
appeal to the American con
science implicit in non-violent
tactics was futile. Americans
are fat, complacent, and uncar
ing. They must be coerced, not
converted. This is war. Other
tactics have been tried, they
say. All that remains is violence.
Recruiting: Value
But if what the American
public and the police think is
unimportant, what the members
of the movement think is not.
On Tuesday, people were horri
fied with what they saw, and
many were ready to do any
thing. That demonstration had
recruiting value.
But what about Friday? One
non-violent critic of that dem
onstration said, "It allows them
to be pseudo-guerrillas on week
ends but stay clean with the
authorities. Most of the non-vio
lent leadership is in jail now.
How many of the violent leaders
are? Damn few."
And what was the mood of the
crowd? As an eyewitness, this

reporter can say that pure com
mitment was not the dominant
feature. A lot of people were
just followers. That's no sur
prise. But the aura of meaning
that some demonstrations in the
past had was covered by the all
pervasive odor of violence.
The Reality Of Force
Police violence was respons
ible in part, but in the South—
where the police were just as
violent—something else came
through, even on TV. Perhaps
that was because the violence
was so one sided, and by choice
rather than simply the reality of
force. How many doubt that if
some of the demonstrators had
had a magic wand to kill all the
cops with, it would have been
used?
The significance of that new
violence is that it is still sup
posed to be used for peace. We
have all been brought up Ameri
can and Communist agitprop
parodies of peace. Everybody is
for peace, there just isn't any.
For those in the movement
who have an ideology to get
them through thick and thin,
this contradiction between vio
lent tactic and the will for peace
will pose no problem. For the
rest, it might.
A new tactic is born, out of
frustration andimpotent rage. It
has won a victory, if you ask
its inventors. Asking others
may produce other answers, but
the leaders of the protest move
ment probably aren't listening.
