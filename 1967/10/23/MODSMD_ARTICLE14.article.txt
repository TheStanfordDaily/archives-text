# Another Attempt
## Tying Up The Draft? Howabout Red Tape 
### Herbie Hinckes 
While standing on an Oakland
street corner the other day
watching a war being fought on
the same terms as Vietnam, I
discovered the I 'solution to the
anti-draft controversy:
To fight your Ibcal draft board,
battle them with their own wea
pons.
The weapon? Red tape at 20
paces. <
The people who run draft
boards in this country (the
butcher, the baker, the muni
tions maker) have no under
standing of violence. But they
understand red tape well, and
often en snarl unsuspecting
young men in bales of docu
ments, sufficiently confusing
them in order to get their sig
natures on the final document
the enlistment contract.
If every draft board could be
tied up with its own weapons,
i.e. red tape, the cost of draft
ing each man could rise to astro
nomical proportions. The result
would be no more draft since
it would be too expensive.
The first step is easy: go to
your local board and demand to
see your file. You have a legal
right to do this and no entry will
be made in your record saying
that you took a peek.
Clever manipulation of this
ploy can fie up a draft board
secretary for an hour as you
browse through your records,
asking nonsense questions.
This is only the beginning.
Done on a once-a-month basis
file checking will slow up the
ii-aft board, but will not cripple
it.

You can also make an occa
sional phone call to your board,
like I do every two or three
weeks:
Draft Board Secretary: Local
board 169, may I help you?
Me: I hope not, but I have
some questions. How are things
at the draft board?
DBS: Fine, I suppose, say is
there something you want ans
wered ?
Me: Yes, if I change my mail

ing address, but not my home
address, should I notify you?
DBS: Yes.
Me: OK, now here's the
stumper; if I change my home
address, but not my mailing ad
dress, should I notify you?
DBS: Let me check with my
supervisor. (15 minutes elapse.)
According to what found in the
Book of Rules for Induction of
Unsuspecting Civilians, yes.
Me: What if I change all my
addresses?
DBS: Of course you should
notify us in that case.
Me: If I don't change any of
my addresses, what should I
do?
DBS: Are you putting me on?
If nothing changes, then you
don't have to do anything.
Me: That's really good to hear.
Thank you very much.

A third ploy is to appeal your
classification. For example, pro
fessors who want to help the
anti-draft movement, but have
already been classified V-A (too
old) can show up at the next
draft board meeting and demand
reclassification to 11-A (occupa
tional deferment) or I-O (con
scientious objector).
Students can protest their 11-S
(student deferment) and ask for
a I V-A (completed military ser
vice).
Sympathetic veterans can re
quest 11-S classifcation.
And soldiers with I-C cards
(active duty) can beg for 11-A.
Each request for reclassifica
tion should hold up two secre
taries for about a week, just to
figure out what you're doing.
The fourth ploy: Find Oak
land policemen who are evading
the draft and submit their names
to Gen. Hershey.
Put the Hinckes plan into ef
fect and the cost of drafting each
man will rise to about $500,000
(rough guess).
Can Johnson afford it? We'll
see. But, at any rate, it will be
fun to sec draft boards snarled
in their own web of red tape.
Capitalist tools, arise!!
