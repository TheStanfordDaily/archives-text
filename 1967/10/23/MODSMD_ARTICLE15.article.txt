# The
						Urban Crisis
## Come Down From Your Ivory Tower! 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
(Editor's Note: Bruce Campbell is a
second year graduate student at the
University of Toronto. He is a 1966
graduate of Stanford and worked for
the Study of Education at Stanford tills
summer. This is one of his reports for
the SES.)

The crucial events in America in the
next decade or two will take place in our
large cities. Indeed, the events of this
last summer showed that the urban
crisis has reached a point of such urgen
cy that ghetto problems will be resolved,
violently or non-violently, during that
time period.
Thus an important problem facing the
University today is how it will respond
to this situation, the magnitude and
urgency of which have been recognized
only recently.
Everything changed with the Detroit
riots, Daniel P. Moynihan suggested
recently on a CBS documentary titled
"What Did We Learn from the Riots?"
The Detroit Negro is among the most
well-off Negroes in America; and the
riots in that city did not take place in the
worst ghetto but rather in an almost
middle-clars area. Detroit baffles us also
because there government programs for
poverty areas have been employed
widely and well.
The lesson of Detroit, Moynihan said,
is that we have to begin our thinking
about the Negro and his problems all
over again. The old ways we tried to
solve the problems have failed. And this
is largely because we have misperceived
both the nature and the magnitude of
the problems.
Denied Dignity
The source of the Negro's bitterness,
frustration, and violence comes not so
much from denial of physical and politi
cal liberties but from denial of dignity.
The root of the problem, Moynihan sug
gested, is the Negro's lack of self
esteem.
But, just as we have not understood

the nature of the problem, so have we
misperceived its magnitude.
The federal programs to date have not
begun to touch the problem. The amount
of money which will have to be poured
into the cities in the next decade or so
in order to solve the cities problems and
avoid sporadic or widespread anarchy
is in the many billions of dollars; per
haps of the magnitude of our current
annual expenditures in Vietnam. Per
haps more.
The American people are as yet
largely unwilling to affirm that magni
tude; and we have not begun to think
through the ways to program enor
mous amounts of money in a manner
such that its recipients may build self
esteem. America is faced with some
pretty hard thinking, both in terms of
comprehending the size of the problem
and in terms of coming up with crea
tive solutions to it—and it must do this
thinking fast.
Rethink Role
What role is the University going to
play in solving the problem, or at least
in mitigating the suffering of the next
decade? The time has come for the Uni
versity to rethink its role in social
change.
And let no one think that it has no
role at all, for, in the words of Charles
Peguy, "the worst partiality is to with
draw ourselves."
Social change of great magnitude is
coming. The University may choose
to withdraw itself from attending to
such considerations; but the University
may also choose to use its resources
to help solve the problems.
Two-fold Change
What is being suggested here is a
two-fold alteration in the University's
relation to social change.
First, the curriculum needs to be
contemporized so that education relates
to current problems, so that the stu
dents Stanford educates are knowledge
able about and prepared to help solve
the urgent problems of the next decade.

Second, the University needs to re
draw the line between involvment in
society and detached reflection on it.
We have swung too far toward the lat
ter and need to move in the direction
of increased emphasis on the former.
This is not to say that the University
should give up its appointed task of
critical reflection, but it is to suggest
that the balance lies somewhere else
than where we have drawn it recently.
Study The City
Research can be done just as aca
demically about the city as it can about
any other topic. We have made the
value judgment to employ our research
energies elsewhere. I am suggesting
that we shift a significant portion of
them to focus on the human problems
in our city.
Almost all the research done in a
university has, directly or indirectly,
some social application. What is called
for now is a rethinking of what areas
in society have the most pressing prob
lems and thus most need research.
The problem of priorities was illum
ined lucidly by Rabbi Abraham Heschel
when he was asked during a visit to
Stanford several years ago what he
value most highly. He responded by
saying that the answer to the question
is found in what a person is willing to
die for. "I would not die that we get
a man to the moon first, hesaid. "I
would be willing to die that a Negro
could walk down the street in Missis
sippi."
Change And Add Courses
One area for change, then, is in the
topics chosen for research.
But, in addition, there are at least
two ways in which the curriculum
would be altered in order more accur
ately to reflect contemporary America.
The first involves focusing on hitherto
largely ignored problems. The second
is based on a radical revision of the idea
of a course.

Under the first heading should be
mentioned courses which are now be
ing taught but which are needed for an
understanding of urban problems.
In the field of psychology, for ex
ample, what do we know about the
basis for and means to increase, self
dignity? What do we know about the
personality dynamics of whites who
predominantly respond to questions
about how to deal with Negroes by
suggesting repressive measures?
In political science, how much at
tention is given to problems of govern
ment of large cities, now operating on
a reduced tax base because of white
flight to the suburbs. What about
multi-city government, transportation,
etc? What are the economic implica
tions of massive government programs
of aid to cities? What are the current
economic dynamics of the city?
In the humanities, what can be done
to make urban life more human? What
does it mean to be human?
Experience In The Field
There is a second and more direct
way to relate education to social prob
lems, however: by combining field ex
perience and academic work.
An interesting application of this
topic has been developed by Dwight
Clark, now Director of Volunteers in
Asia. He and others suggest that stu
dents spend a quarter or longer in the
field in direct contact with social prob
lems. During this time they are under
the supervision of a faculty member on
campus who helps them relate this field
experience to their academic program
in the form of research projects, re
ports or term papers.
A type of pilot program on this
model has been tried for the last sev
eral quarters by the campus UCCM
group.
Called an "Exploration Trip," week
ends spent in the inner city of San
Francisco involve alternately exposure
to social problems through talks and

through walking the streets, and re
flection on this exposure through group
discussion.
The groups have found that the dis
cussions led successively to:
1) An understanding of social prob
lems through direct contact with those
suffering from them.
2) Tentative forming of solutions
based on first-hand experience.
3) Greater self-understanding. (Mem
bers better understood their own sex
uality, for example, by discussing
homosexuality).
The groups were struck especially
by the recognition of their own, hither
to unconscious, involvement in social
problems.
Bettor Prepared
The benefits of structuring curricu
lum along the lines of field experience
followed by examination are several.
First, education related directly to
experience with social problems will
better prepare students to face social
problems when they leave the univers
ity than does merely reading about
them.
And yet, second, the value of the Uni
versity is not surrendered, because the
experience is balanced with analysis
of it. The program combines detached
reflection with knowledge based on
direct involvement.
Third, an integral part of such educa
tion is students making an immediate,
tangible contribution to society, It
shows them, as most academic work
does not, that individual action can
have a social effect toward helping
others and need not be just an end
in itself.
America is now faced with one of the
greatest crisis of its history and time
is running out for a creative response
to it. How will the University respond
to the twin problems of first recogniz
ing the magnitude of the crisis and
second understanding its nature?
This is one of the most urgent ques
tions facing Stanford today.
