# Stanford Student Walks To Canada
## 
### C. G. STEPHENS 
When Stanford senior Craig
Holoboski tires of studying at
night he sometimes takes "a
little walk."
But last week one of his noc
turnal strolls turned into a trip
to Vancouver, Canada, bringing
an all points missing person bul
letin to police departments in
three states.
Holoboski is still puzzled by
all the commotion he caused
when he left his apartment at
603 Melville planning only to
walk to San Francisco early
Sunday, Oct. 15.
Not Going Anyplace
"I really didn't plan to go any
place," he told The Daily shortly
after he return Friday after
noon. Evidence of that fact was
abundant: he left his motor
cycle, checkbook, most of his
clothing and keys at the apart
ment.
Worried roommates, thinking
the gregarious young man had
been done in, called Palo Alto
police Wednesday and officially
reported him missing.
The local gendarmes started a
full-scale investigation, search
ing morgues, jails and hospitals
for the 22-year-old Stanford se
nior.
Ironically, the the moment
iHoloboski returned from the
long trek, the Palo Alto Times
was printing a story saying he
was still missing.
Tired Of Books
Holoboski said the reason for
his disappearance was boredom
and an urge to go someplace.
"I just got tired of staring at
my books," he commented.
After a Stanford Daily party
Oct. 14 at the Newman Center,
1247 Cowper St., Holoboski went
back to his apartment and sat
down to do some serious study
ing.

He gave up a few minutes
lates, grabbed his jacket and
started walking toward San
Francisco on El Camino Real.
He thumbled a ride near Bel
mont and wound up in San
Francisco.
Heading North
From there he decided to keep
heading northward, and 17 hitch
hikes later, found himself in
Vancouver. The trip took only
36 hours, Holoboski said.
After wandering around the
Canadian city for four days, he
started the return trip, most of
it via bus.
When he walked into his Palo
Alto apartment Friday he was
astonished when roommates told
him, "Hey, the police are look
ing for you."
Holoboski said he had no idea
people would start searching for
him after he'd been gone for
only a few days. "I could see it
if I was gone for a month," he
elaborated, "but not just a
week."
Live On Credit
How did he survive with the
small amount of cash in his
pocket? "I used my Bankameri
card," he said, holding up the
small plastic credit card.
And where the credit card did
n't work, other methods did.
Holoboski established credit at
Hudson's Bay Co., one of the
largest department stores in
Canada, with no more than his
identification.
The only time the stocky po
litical science major met danger,
he said, was just after he start
ed walking toward San Francisco
on El Camino Real.
A carload of teenagers pulled
up and bombarded him with
water balloons as he strolled
along the King's Highway. "It
was pretty discouraging," he
smiled, "I almost turned back."
