A new experimental training
program in investigative medi
cine will be initiated by the Stan
ford University School of Medi
cine.
Announcement of the pro
gram, which will be funded by
a $143,000 grant from the Na
tional Institutes of Health, was
made Friday by Dr. Robert J.
Glaser, vice-president for medi
cal affairs and dean of the med
ical school.
Dr. Halsted R. Holman, Gug
genhime professor and execu
tive head of the Department of
Medicine, will direct the program
for medical students and post
doctoral fellows. He will be as
sisted by Dr. Thomas Merigan,
associate professor of medicine
and head of the Division of In
fectious Diseases, and Dr. Hugh
McDevitt assistant professor of
medicine.
"Investigative medicine in
creasingly requires a proficiency
of clinical analysis and manage
ment of individual patients and
a detailed, imaginative use of
experimental biological techni
ques in studying problems pre
sented by the patient," says Dr.
Holman.
Currently, most physicians
who ultimately undertake an
academic career obtain both
their clinical and investigative
training, requiring from five to

ten years, after graduation from
medical school. It is hoped that
the new training program will
permit a significant number of
students to develop independent
investigative capabilities while
still medical students, thus eli
minating several years of addi
tional training.
