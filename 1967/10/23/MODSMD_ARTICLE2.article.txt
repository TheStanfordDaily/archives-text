# Soldiers Thwart Pentagon March
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — The anti
draft machine slowly sputtered
to a halt Sunday, with many of
its drivers in jail after a des
perate race to enter the halls of
the five-sided building, across
the Potomac from here.
Only a few hundred demon
strators remained outside the
Pentagon Sunday afternoon,
down considerably from the ap
proximately 50,000 who partici
pated in a march on the military
headquarters Saturday, accord
ing to the Associated Press.
More than 400 of the protest
ors were arrested during the
weekend and 47 injured when
the anti-draft rally moved across
the Potomac to the Pentagon.
At the peak of Saturday's vio
lence, a h a n d 112 ul of youths
slipped through a secondary
Pentagon entrance but were
beaten back by federal marshals
before entering the building's
corridors.
An estimated 3,500 troops sta
tioned in or near the building
were successful in thwarting the
demonstrators' aim of paralyz
ing the nation's military nerve
center.
At the same time, the Na
tional Committee for Responsi
ble Patriotism was holding a
demonstration in New York
City's Battery Park in support
of service men in Vietnam.
Called "Operation Gratitude,"
the demonstration was praised
by former Vice President Rich
ard M. Nixon and 1964 presiden
tial runner-up Barry Goldwater.
As the peace picketers com
pleted plans Friday for the
Washington march, Pentagon
officials made last minute prepa
rations for the weekend. Troops
from the 82nd Airborne Divi
sion, which has seen action in
the Dominican Republic and De
troit, were flown to the Wash
ington area along with military
policemen from several other
bases, including the Presidio in
San Francisco.
The MPs were equipped with
nightsticks and .45 caliber pis
tols. Officials said riot control
chemicals were available but not
used.
Saturday noon the demonstra
tors —estimated at between 20,-
000 and 200,000, depending who
was doing the estimating —
heard speeches at Lincoln Me
morial, then started the march.
The demonstrators, carrying
North Vietnamese flags and
armed with large clubs and axe
handles, formed a wedge on one
of the road leading from the
Pentagon parking lot and at
tempted to push their way
through a contingent of military
police strung across their path.
The group was the vanguard
of the antiwar march on the
Pentagon from the Lincoln Me
morial one and a half-miles
away.
Several of the demonstrators
burst through the defense line
but were quickly apprehended
by marshals and MPs.
A second confrontation 10
minutes later was rougher. Dem
onstrators began swinging clubs,
tomatoes and bottles but were
again repelled by the MPs. The
group then got the word from

their own leaders that if they
made another assault on the
mall entrance, they could gain
access more easily.
The group then attempted to
break through the guards cor
doning off the mall entrance,
one of the two principal means
of access into the Pentagon.
In a separate incident, author
Norman Mailer was arrested by
fed era 1 marshals when he
walked through police lines at
the Pentagon.
Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara watched the action
from his window, high over the
demonstrators. He allegedly
spent 15 hours staring at the
scene.
Officials said 47 were injured,
including 10 soldiers, 13 U.S.
marshals and 24 civilians.
Ten of the civilians suffered
head injuries and others were
hurt when they fell while scal
ing a wall, a Pentagon spokes
man said. Some of the injured
civilians were treated in a Pen
tagon dispensary.
Sunday's demonstrations were
peaceful.
After sitting through the chill
40 degree night, the demonstra
tors sought to rekindle the pro
test. The crowd remaining out
side the Pentagon sang "Soldiers
Are Our Brothers," and "Oh,
What a Beautiful Morning."
As the weekend slowly
shriveled into Monday, some
demonstrators lay in the shade
of trees picnicking. Except for
piles of ashes left from over
night bonfires, the lawn outside
the Pentagon's mall entrance
might have resembled a city
park on a sunny autumn after
noon.
One youth wore a sign around
his neck: "I need a ride back to
New York."
