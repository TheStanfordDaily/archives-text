# Indian Poloists Edged By Undefeated Bruins
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford water poloists beat
UC Irvine, 12-9 last Friday, but
lost the big one as UCLA came
from behind to score an 8-7
victory Saturday.

Stanford captain Gary Sheerer
hit 5 goals in the UCLA game
and Mark Parmely scored on
two sweep shots. But the In
dians' perennial nemesis, UC
LA's Oympic veteran Stan Cole,

fired in six and Bruin Bruce
Bradley scored two to preserve
UCLA's undefeated standing.
For three years now, Stanford
and UCLA have played cliff
hangers, and Stanford has al
ways wound up on the bottom.
UCLA has won 5 games by a to
tal of 7 goals.
Last Chance
For a moment in the last quar
ter, with less than a minute to
go, it appeared that the Indians
would at least force the contest
into overtime. With Stanford
trailing 8-7, Sheerer stole the
ball and was fouled.
Sheerer zipped the free pass
across court to fast-breaking
Parmely, who had nothing with
in two yards of him but open
goal. The referee blew his
whistle and called the play back
to remove the UCLA player who
had committed his fifth foul
when he grabbed Sheerer.
When play resumed, the Bruin
defense had sagged in, and the
clock ticked dry.
Stanford surged to an early
lead in the game on shots by
Sheerer and Parmely, but UCLA
came back to tie the score, 4-4
at halftime.
Momsen Stops 12
Stanford goalie Bob Momsen
made 12 saves in the game and
shut down Bradley on a "sure
thing" penalty shot.
The Indians get a second shot
at the Bruins Friday in Los
Angeles. For more than half the
Stanford varsity, it will be the
last chance to snap a string of
frustrations.
Slowly But Surely
Irvine was not a patsy in any
body's book. The Anteaters beat
USC 8-5, and narrowly lost to
UCLA, 6-4, earlier in the year.
Stanford pasted an inexorable
three goals a quarter on the
scoreboard to gradually widen
a 3 goal lead. Sheerer and Par
mely again did the lion's share

of the scoring, with 5 and 3
apiece.
John Parker, Greg Bucking
ham, Pete Siebert, and Ken Ham
mer each contributed to the ef
fort.
Long shots were the order of
the game, as Sheerer, Parker,
and Buckingham scored from
near half court. Parmely ripped
a 10 yard backhand from an im
possible position cramped
against the wall.
The Stanford frosh also had
a hard day Saturday, as CSM
came out on top 10-9, after two
overtime periods. Friday, the Pa
pooses handed San Jose City
College a 13-7 defeat. Mitch Ivey,
Brian Putnam, Rick Eagleston,
Steve Dahout, Ken Terry, and
Ray Collins divided up the scor
ing over the weekend.
