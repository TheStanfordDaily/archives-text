# Schultz Runs Wild
## Frosh Squeak Out Second Victory 
### PETE DUFFY 
Coming from behind three
times Saturday morning, Stan
ford's freshman football team
made it two in a row as they
downed the UCLA Bru babies 21-
20.
Following a lackluster first

half, the frosh came back strong
in the second to win a hard
fought contest.
Once again it was the sensa
tional running of halfback Jack
Schultz that highlighted the
Stanford offense. The Cards
gained 348 yards.

Schultz rushed for 188 yards
in 26 carries including the win
ning touchdown gallop of 35
yards. Schultz now has gained
a phenomenal 358 yards in only
two games.
Early in the game the Frosh

were bothered by the Bruins'
passing and outside running.
Twice in the first half the In
dians marched to the UCLA one
yard line and failed to score.
After Stanford lost the ball on
downs on the UCLA Vz yard line,
Brubabe quarterback John Mur
phy engineered a 99H yard scor
ing march.
Murphy snuck over from the
one to score, then ran around
left end for a two-point conver
sion, making it 8-0.
Minutes later the Papooses
managed to score. Stanford re
covered a UCLA fumble on the
Brubabes 6 yard line, and full
back Bill Honey, who gained 77
yards on the day. took it in for
the six points.

Steve Biegrenzahn converted,
narrowing the deficit to 8-7.
In the second quarter UCLA
drove 60 yards to score on a
Rich Pope to Jim Coleman pass.
The conversion attempt failed,
leaving the score 14-7 at the half.
Second Half
The Papooses came right back
in the third quarter to tie the
score 14-14, as Don Bunce boot
legged eight yards. The run cap
ped an 80 yard drive highlighted
by Jack Schultz's running and
a 33 yard pass from Bunce to
Ron Kadziel.
Stanford fumbled the UCLA
punt on the next series of downs
and UCLA recovered on the Pa
poose 10. Murphy quickly pass
ed to Coleman for six points,
but the conversion attempt fail
ed again.
Winning Point
The Papooses responded to the
20-14 deficit with a 60 yard, four
play drive for a score. Schultz
galloped the final 35 yards to tie
the score at 20-20.
Biegrenzahn calmly split the
uprights for the extra and win
ning point of the game.
The Brubabes, much like their
Bruin counterparts in the var
sity contest, were unable to go
anywhere in the second half. The
heralded Mickey Cureton and
Art Simms were only able to
gain 31 yards rushing in the
second half.
