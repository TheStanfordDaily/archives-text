# Disappointing Loss To Bruins Gives Tribe New Team Spirit
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Out of the ruins of defeat
arises a new symbol of strength
and victory.
The symbol appeared Satur
day after Stanford's heartbreak
ing 21-16 loss to UCLA. The In
dians had become a team.
"We've got a lot of confidence
in ourselves now," said Doug
McKenzie, a Stanford defensive
tackle who had to battle the
rushes of Rick Purdy and Mike
Garratt.
"We're more of a team now
than we've ever been since I've
been here," the junior con
cluded.
Win A Lot Now
Tom Massey, a defensive
safety, added to what McKenzie
said, "We're going to start win
ning a lot of ball games now.
The turning point in our season
was this week. We knew we
could beat UCLA when we en
tered the stadium because our
spirit was so high."
"We never stopped fighting,
and that's the big key," he con
cluded.
Jack Root, senior fullback
and tri-captain, said, "It was the
best team effort I've seen and
also our most disappointing
loss."
Ralston Defines Spirit
Stanford coach John Ralston
helped define the spirit. "We
reached our emotional peak sev
eral hours before the game and
had to come down a little. When
UCLA first got the ball and
went for a touchdown, we
missed tackles and made mis
takes because we were so high.
"After that score, we settled
down and really played. I'm
overwhelmed by the teams' ef
fort." He praised Jack Root,
Marty Brill, and Don Swartz,
Card tri-captains, for their lead
ership.
First TD
Ralston explained that the
first touchdown came on a play

the team had practiced for
weeks. Press box spotter Dick
Vermeil called down to the
bench for the play.
Chuck Williams faked a
plunge into the line and lofted
a bomb to Bill Shoemaker for
the score to surprise all 47,000
fans in the Stanford Stadium.
Shoemaker said he saw the
defensive back take two steps
forward thinking it was a run
ning play. "I just burned right
past him and Chuck put the ball
up there perfectly." Normally,
Shoemaker curls over the mid
dle if the defensive back doesn't
come up.
Bruin coach Tommy Protho
tended to minimize the daring
of the play and Williams' fako
into the line. "Naturally, it
fooled everyone, but the under
dog can try it and get away
with pulling something like
that."
Beban Surprises
UCLA quarterback Gary Be
ban pulled some surprises of his
own; on his two scoring plays,
Beban called a line plunge for
fullback Purdy. "I was the only
man on the team who knew I
would run with the ball to the
outside after the fake." he said.
Beban's object in not telling
his teammates was to have them
all carry through their assign
ments as if the play were a
plunge. He was all alone both
times. "Stanford was keying on
our fullback," he said, "and I
let the defensive end go for him
and then ran outside."
Third Downs
Ralston and Beban disagreed
somewhat over the nature of
third down plays. Ralston
praised Beban for coming up
with key third down plays again
and again on the Bruins third
quarter drive for the winning
TD.
Beban praised Stanford for its
doggedness in stopping third

down plays in the fourth quar
ter. "TTiey were so fired up and
tough. I missed a short pass to
Purdy with about three minutes
left in the fourth quarter when
Rick was wide open.
"If I'd completed that one,
maybe things wouldn't have
been so close at the end."
Ralston Praise
Ralston praised his defensive
ends Don Parish, Tom Hazel
rigg, and Stu Kellner for their
inspired job of pushing through
blockers to get to Beban. Parish
was lineman of the game for the
second straight week.
After the Cards' second TD,
Ralston elected to go for two
points. "We didn't figure that a
field goal would give us a tie if
we made the two-pointer. We
never play for a tie."

plunge into the line and lofted
a bomb to Bill Shoemaker for
the score to surprise all 47,000
fans in the Stanford Stadium.
Shoemaker said he saw the
defensive back take two steps
forward thinking it was a run
ning play. "I just burned right
past him and Chuck put the ball
up there perfectly." Normally,
Shoemaker curls over the mid
dle if the defensive back doesn't
come up.
Bruin coach Tommy Protho
tended to minimize the daring
of the play and Williams' fako
into the line. "Naturally, it
fooled everyone, but the under
dog can try it and get away
with pulling something like
that."
Beban Surprises
UCLA quarterback Gary Be
ban pulled some surprises of his
own; on his two scoring plays,
Beban called a line plunge for
fullback Purdy. "I was the only
man on the team who knew I
would run with the ball to the
outside after the fake." he said.
Beban's object in not telling
his teammates was to have them
all carry through their assign
ments as if the play were a
plunge. He was all alone both
times. "Stanford was keying on
our fullback," he said, "and I
let the defensive end go for him
and then ran outside."
Third Downs
Ralston and Beban disagreed
somewhat over the nature of
third down plays. Ralston
praised Beban for coming up
with key third down plays again
and again on the Bruins third
quarter drive for the winning
TD.
Beban praised Stanford for its
doggedness in stopping third

down plays in the fourth quar
ter. "TTiey were so fired up and
tough. I missed a short pass to
Purdy with about three minutes
left in the fourth quarter when
Rick was wide open.
"If I'd completed that one,
maybe things wouldn't have
been so close at the end."
Ralston Praise
Ralston praised his defensive
ends Don Parish, Tom Hazel
rigg, and Stu Kellner for their
inspired job of pushing through
blockers to get to Beban. Parish
was lineman of the game for the
second straight week.
After the Cards' second TD,
Ralston elected to go for two
points. "We didn't figure that a
field goal would give us a tie if
we made the two-pointer. We
never play for a tie."
Out of the ruins of defeat
arises a new symbol of strength
and victory.
The symbol appeared Satur
day after Stanford's heartbreak
ing 21-16 loss to UCLA. The In
dians had become a team.
"We've got a lot of confidence
in ourselves now," said Doug
McKenzie, a Stanford defensive
tackle who had to battle the
rushes of Rick Purdy and Mike
Garratt.
"We're more of a team now
than we've ever been since I've
been here," the junior con
cluded.
Win A Lot Now
Tom Massey, a defensive
safety, added to what McKenzie
said, "We're going to start win
ning a lot of ball games now.
The turning point in our season
was this week. We knew we
could beat UCLA when we en
tered the stadium because our
spirit was so high."
"We never stopped fighting,
and that's the big key," he con
cluded.
Jack Root, senior fullback
and tri-captain, said, "It was the
best team effort I've seen and
also our most disappointing
loss."
Ralston Defines Spirit
Stanford coach John Ralston
helped define the spirit. "We
reached our emotional peak sev
eral hours before the game and
had to come down a little. When
UCLA first got the ball and
went for a touchdown, we
missed tackles and made mis
takes because we were so high.
"After that score, we settled
down and really played. I'm
overwhelmed by the teams' ef
fort." He praised Jack Root,
Marty Brill, and Don Swartz,
Card tri-captains, for their lead
ership.
First TD
Ralston explained that the
first touchdown came on a play

the team had practiced for
weeks. Press box spotter Dick
Vermeil called down to the

Ralston praised his defensive
ends Don Parish, Tom Hazel
rigg, and Stu Kellner for their
inspired job of pushing through
blockers to get to Beban. Parish
was lineman of the game for the
second straight week.
After the Cards' second TD,
Ralston elected to go for two
points. "We didn't figure that a
field goal would give us a tie if
we made the two-pointer. We
never play for a tie."
Out of the ruins of defeat
arises a new symbol of strength
and victory.
The symbol appeared Satur
day after Stanford's heartbreak
ing 21-16 loss to UCLA. The In
dians had become a team.
"We've got a lot of confidence
in ourselves now," said Doug
McKenzie, a Stanford defensive
tackle who had to battle the
rushes of Rick Purdy and Mike
Garratt.
"We're more of a team now
than we've ever been since I've
been here," the junior con
cluded.
Win A Lot Now
Tom Massey, a defensive
safety, added to what McKenzie
said, "We're going to start win
ning a lot of ball games now.
The turning point in our season
was this week. We knew we
could beat UCLA when we en
tered the stadium because our
spirit was so high."
"We never stopped fighting,
and that's the big key," he con
cluded.
Jack Root, senior fullback
and tri-captain, said, "It was the
best team effort I've seen and
also our most disappointing
loss."
Ralston Defines Spirit
Stanford coach John Ralston
helped define the spirit. "We
reached our emotional peak sev
eral hours before the game and
had to come down a little. When
UCLA first got the ball and
went for a touchdown, we
missed tackles and made mis
takes because we were so high.
"After that score, we settled
down and really played. I'm
overwhelmed by the teams' ef
fort." He praised Jack Root,
Marty Brill, and Don Swartz,
Card tri-captains, for their lead
ership.
First TD
Ralston explained that the
first touchdown came on a play

the team had practiced for
weeks. Press box spotter Dick
Vermeil called down to the
bench for the play.
Chuck Williams faked a
plunge into the line and lofted
a bomb to Bill Shoemaker for
the score to surprise all 47,000
fans in the Stanford Stadium.
Shoemaker said he saw the
defensive back take two steps
forward thinking it was a run
ning play. "I just burned right
past him and Chuck put the ball
up there perfectly." Normally,
Shoemaker curls over the mid
dle if the defensive back doesn't
come up.
Bruin coach Tommy Protho
tended to minimize the daring
of the play and Williams' fako
into the line. "Naturally, it
fooled everyone, but the under
dog can try it and get away
with pulling something like
that."
Beban Surprises
UCLA quarterback Gary Be
ban pulled some surprises of his
own; on his two scoring plays,
Beban called a line plunge for
fullback Purdy. "I was the only
man on the team who knew I
would run with the ball to the
outside after the fake." he said.
Beban's object in not telling
his teammates was to have them
all carry through their assign
ments as if the play were a
plunge. He was all alone both
times. "Stanford was keying on
our fullback," he said, "and I
let the defensive end go for him
and then ran outside."
Third Downs
Ralston and Beban disagreed
somewhat over the nature of
third down plays. Ralston
praised Beban for coming up
with key third down plays again
and again on the Bruins third
quarter drive for the winning
TD.
Beban praised Stanford for its
doggedness in stopping third

down plays in the fourth quar
ter. "TTiey were so fired up and
tough. I missed a short pass to
Purdy with about three minutes
left in the fourth quarter when
Rick was wide open.
"If I'd completed that one,
maybe things wouldn't have
been so close at the end."
Ralston Praise
Ralston praised his defensive
ends Don Parish, Tom Hazel
rigg, and Stu Kellner for their
inspired job of pushing through
blockers to get to Beban. Parish
was lineman of the game for the
second straight week.
After the Cards' second TD,
Ralston elected to go for two
points. "We didn't figure that a
