# Tribe Hearts Break In UCLA Loss
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
The Bruins of UCLA narrow
ly edged the Indians Saturday
21-16 in what many Stanford
fans have described as the finest
game of football that the Cards
have played in several years.
Led by Back - of - the - Game
Chuck Williams, the Indians
were in the game until the last
second. At that point the Indians
had possession of the ball on
the Bruin 16 yardline, trailing
by less than a touchdown.
Stanford coach John Ralston
summed up the feelings of the
unhappy Card fans with his
simple post-game comment, "It
might have been."
Outstanding Last Quarter
The fourth quarter was all
Stanford's. The Indians had pos
session of the ball for more than
12 of the 15 minutes of playing
time.
The Cards scored the final
tally of the day in that period
with 4:50 left in the game, mak
ing the score 21-16. The try for
the two-point conversion failed
as Williams' pass to George
Buehler fell incomplete.
The Indian defense then held
the Uclans to two yards, and the
Cards took possession of the
ball again on their own 18 yard
line with just 3:49 on the score
board clock.
Stanford drove up to their 47
before Sandy Green, Bruin safe
ty, intercepted a Williams-to-
Washington pass on his 17.
Precious Seconds
The hopes of the Stanford
rooters sank immeasureably as
Gary Beban directed his team
in an attempt to run out the
1 minute and 37 seconds left in
the game.
But once more the Indian de
fense proved tough, and Beban
only used 35 of those precious
seconds before the Indians got
the ball again.
With 1:02 showing Williams
again got the Cards rolling. He
hit Buehler from the Indian 37
for 22 yards, but a mix-up with

the official call cost several valu
able seconds. The clock was
stopped by an incomplete pass
aimed at Bill Shoemaker.
Not Enough Time
With 13 seconds left Williams
hit Gene Washington, as he had
done all day. This time the pass
was good for 26 yards; but be
fore the clock could be stopped
with another incomplete pass, all
but 9 seconds were used up.
Nine seconds were not enough.
Williams had time for two more
plays. Both passes, however,
were high and out of the end
zone.
Many Card Stars
Although Williams had 16
completions for 221 yards, one
touchdown, and 48 net yards on
the ground, many other Indians
starred in this great effort.
Aiding the Cardinal offensive
drives were Nate Kirtman, who
gained 67 net yards for the
Tribe; Jack Root who compiled
65 yards; and Gene Washington,
who pulled in 9 of Williams'
passes for a total of 99 yards.
Defensive standout was Line
man-of-the-Game Don Parish,
who made 10 tackles, 6 unassist
ed. Many of his tackles stopped
Beban end runs.
The "Great One"
However, it was Beban, dub
bed the "Great One," who engi
neered the Bruin victory. Beban
missed being named outstanding
back by only three votes, and his
81 yards on the ground and 50
yards in the air were largely
responsible for the Uclan win.
The 47,000 football fans who
were in Stanford Stadium got
an early indication of what the
UCLA part of this game would
be like. The first play of the
game saw Beban skirt around
his own left end for a gain of
12 yards.
On To Paydlrt
Fullback Rick Purdy, who
rushed for 60 yards during the
afternoon, next carried the ball
for a gain of 9. Two plays later
it was Beban around his right

this time for a gain of 7 and a
first down.
The pattern continued for 12
plays and 78 yards. When the
drive ended five minutes later,
the Bruins led 7-0.
Coach John Ralston credited
Beban's ability to get the first

down on the third-and-five (or
more) situation as the main
factor in the UCLA win.
The second time the Cards
got the ball in the first half
they drove in for their first
score. The crucial play in the
series was a fourth-and-one sit
uation on the Bruin 39.
With great poise, Williams,

rather than giving the ball to
Root for the familiar plunge up
the middle, stepped back and
threw a perfect pass to Shoe
maker, who beat his man to the
goal line.
On the first play of the sec
ond quarter Pat Preston picked
off a Beban pass and returned it
to the Bruin 42. Kirtman found
a huge hole off right tackle and
used a fine block from Wash
ington to move to the UCLA 12.
Cards Lead Briefly
The Card .drive stalled here,
but 3 points were salvaged with
a 27 yard field goal by Shoe
maker. The Indians led for the
only time in the game by a
score of 10-7.
This lead lasted until Beban
capped a 52-yard drive with an
11 yeard run to paydirt with
3:32 left in the half.
The Cards had a scoring op
portunity in the third period
when Williams, Root, Kirtman,
and Company advanced to the
Uclan 25; but the loss of 9 yards
on an attempted pass eliminated
even the possibility of a field
goal attempt.
The Bruins came back after
the terminated Stanford drive
with another toughdown. The
big play of this 80-yard series
was a Beban-to-Purdy pass for
30 yeards. A four yard Beban
sweep around right end gave
the Uclans the deciding score.

maker, who beat his man to the
goal line.
On the first play of the sec
ond quarter Pat Preston picked
off a Beban pass and returned it
to the Bruin 42. Kirtman found
a huge hole off right tackle and
used a fine block from Wash
ington to move to the UCLA 12.
Cards Lead Briefly
The Card .drive stalled here,
but 3 points were salvaged with
a 27 yard field goal by Shoe
maker. The Indians led for the
only time in the game by a
score of 10-7.
This lead lasted until Beban
capped a 52-yard drive with an
11 yeard run to paydirt with
3:32 left in the half.
The Cards had a scoring op
portunity in the third period
when Williams, Root, Kirtman,
and Company advanced to the
Uclan 25; but the loss of 9 yards
on an attempted pass eliminated
even the possibility of a field
goal attempt.
The Bruins came back after
the terminated Stanford drive
with another toughdown. The
big play of this 80-yard series
was a Beban-to-Purdy pass for
30 yeards. A four yard Beban
sweep around right end gave
the Uclans the deciding score.

THE ELUSIVE BEBAN: "The Great One" was unable to get away on this end run as Bill Nicholson
(91), John de la Forest (68), and Tom Hazelrigg (85) close in for the kill. Hazelrigg here evades a
block thrown by Bruin fullback Rick Purdy. Hazelrigg and the other Stanford defensive ends Don
Parish and Stu Kellner received high praise from Coach John Ralston for their performance during
the afternoon.
The Bruins of UCLA narrow
ly edged the Indians Saturday
21-16 in what many Stanford
fans have described as the finest
game of football that the Cards
have played in several years.
Led by Back - of - the - Game
Chuck Williams, the Indians
were in the game until the last
second. At that point the Indians
had possession of the ball on
the Bruin 16 yardline, trailing
by less than a touchdown.
Stanford coach John Ralston
summed up the feelings of the
unhappy Card fans with his
simple post-game comment, "It
might have been."
Outstanding Last Quarter
The fourth quarter was all
Stanford's. The Indians had pos
session of the ball for more than
12 of the 15 minutes of playing
time.
The Cards scored the final
tally of the day in that period
with 4:50 left in the game, mak
ing the score 21-16. The try for
the two-point conversion failed
as Williams' pass to George
Buehler fell incomplete.
The Indian defense then held
the Uclans to two yards, and the
Cards took possession of the
ball again on their own 18 yard
line with just 3:49 on the score
board clock.
Stanford drove up to their 47
before Sandy Green, Bruin safe
ty, intercepted a Williams-to-
Washington pass on his 17.
Precious Seconds
The hopes of the Stanford
rooters sank immeasureably as
Gary Beban directed his team
in an attempt to run out the
1 minute and 37 seconds left in
the game.
But once more the Indian de
fense proved tough, and Beban
only used 35 of those precious
seconds before the Indians got
the ball again.
With 1:02 showing Williams
again got the Cards rolling. He
hit Buehler from the Indian 37
for 22 yards, but a mix-up with

the official call cost several valu
able seconds. The clock was
stopped by an incomplete pass
aimed at Bill Shoemaker.
Not Enough Time
With 13 seconds left Williams
hit Gene Washington, as he had
done all day. This time the pass
was good for 26 yards; but be
fore the clock could be stopped
with another incomplete pass, all
but 9 seconds were used up.
Nine seconds were not enough.
Williams had time for two more
plays. Both passes, however,
were high and out of the end
zone.
Many Card Stars
Although Williams had 16
completions for 221 yards, one
touchdown, and 48 net yards on
the ground, many other Indians
starred in this great effort.
Aiding the Cardinal offensive
drives were Nate Kirtman, who
gained 67 net yards for the
Tribe; Jack Root who compiled
65 yards; and Gene Washington,
who pulled in 9 of Williams'
passes for a total of 99 yards.
Defensive standout was Line
man-of-the-Game Don Parish,
who made 10 tackles, 6 unassist
ed. Many of his tackles stopped
Beban end runs.
The "Great One"
However, it was Beban, dub
bed the "Great One," who engi
neered the Bruin victory. Beban
missed being named outstanding
back by only three votes, and his
81 yards on the ground and 50
yards in the air were largely
responsible for the Uclan win.
The 47,000 football fans who
were in Stanford Stadium got
an early indication of what the
UCLA part of this game would
be like. The first play of the
game saw Beban skirt around
his own left end for a gain of
12 yards.
On To Paydlrt
Fullback Rick Purdy, who
rushed for 60 yards during the
afternoon, next carried the ball
for a gain of 9. Two plays later
it was Beban around his right

this time for a gain of 7 and a
first down.
The pattern continued for 12
plays and 78 yards. When the
drive ended five minutes later,
the Bruins led 7-0.
Coach John Ralston credited
Beban's ability to get the first

down on the third-and-five (or
more) situation as the main
factor in the UCLA win.
The second time the Cards
got the ball in the first half
they drove in for their first
score. The crucial play in the
series was a fourth-and-one sit
uation on the Bruin 39.
With great poise, Williams,

rather than giving the ball to
Root for the familiar plunge up
the middle, stepped back and
threw a perfect pass to Shoe
maker, who beat his man to the
goal line.

drives were Nate Kirtman, who
gained 67 net yards for the
Tribe; Jack Root who compiled
65 yards; and Gene Washington,
who pulled in 9 of Williams'
passes for a total of 99 yards.
Defensive standout was Line
man-of-the-Game Don Parish,
who made 10 tackles, 6 unassist
ed. Many of his tackles stopped
Beban end runs.
The "Great One"
However, it was Beban, dub
bed the "Great One," who engi
neered the Bruin victory. Beban
missed being named outstanding
back by only three votes, and his
81 yards on the ground and 50
yards in the air were largely
responsible for the Uclan win.
The 47,000 football fans who
were in Stanford Stadium got
an early indication of what the
UCLA part of this game would
be like. The first play of the
game saw Beban skirt around
his own left end for a gain of
12 yards.
On To Paydlrt
Fullback Rick Purdy, who
rushed for 60 yards during the
afternoon, next carried the ball
for a gain of 9. Two plays later
it was Beban around his right

this time for a gain of 7 and a
first down.
The pattern continued for 12
plays and 78 yards. When the
drive ended five minutes later,
the Bruins led 7-0.
Coach John Ralston credited
Beban's ability to get the first

down on the third-and-five (or
more) situation as the main
factor in the UCLA win.
The second time the Cards
got the ball in the first half
they drove in for their first
score. The crucial play in the
series was a fourth-and-one sit
uation on the Bruin 39.
With great poise, Williams,

rather than giving the ball to
Root for the familiar plunge up
the middle, stepped back and
threw a perfect pass to Shoe
maker, who beat his man to the
goal line.
On the first play of the sec
ond quarter Pat Preston picked
off a Beban pass and returned it
to the Bruin 42. Kirtman found
a huge hole off right tackle and
used a fine block from Wash
ington to move to the UCLA 12.
Cards Lead Briefly
The Card .drive stalled here,
but 3 points were salvaged with
a 27 yard field goal by Shoe
maker. The Indians led for the
only time in the game by a
score of 10-7.
This lead lasted until Beban
capped a 52-yard drive with an
11 yeard run to paydirt with
3:32 left in the half.
The Cards had a scoring op
portunity in the third period
when Williams, Root, Kirtman,
and Company advanced to the
Uclan 25; but the loss of 9 yards
on an attempted pass eliminated
even the possibility of a field
goal attempt.
The Bruins came back after
the terminated Stanford drive
with another toughdown. The
big play of this 80-yard series
was a Beban-to-Purdy pass for
30 yeards. A four yard Beban
sweep around right end gave
the Uclans the deciding score.

THE ELUSIVE BEBAN: "The Great One" was unable to get away on this end run as Bill Nicholson
(91), John de la Forest (68), and Tom Hazelrigg (85) close in for the kill. Hazelrigg here evades a
block thrown by Bruin fullback Rick Purdy. Hazelrigg and the other Stanford defensive ends Don
Parish and Stu Kellner received high praise from Coach John Ralston for their performance during
the afternoon.
The Bruins of UCLA narrow
ly edged the Indians Saturday
21-16 in what many Stanford
fans have described as the finest
game of football that the Cards
have played in several years.
Led by Back - of - the - Game
Chuck Williams, the Indians
were in the game until the last
second. At that point the Indians
had possession of the ball on
the Bruin 16 yardline, trailing
by less than a touchdown.
Stanford coach John Ralston
summed up the feelings of the
unhappy Card fans with his
simple post-game comment, "It
might have been."
Outstanding Last Quarter
The fourth quarter was all
Stanford's. The Indians had pos
session of the ball for more than
12 of the 15 minutes of playing
time.
The Cards scored the final
tally of the day in that period
with 4:50 left in the game, mak
ing the score 21-16. The try for
the two-point conversion failed
as Williams' pass to George
Buehler fell incomplete.
The Indian defense then held
the Uclans to two yards, and the
Cards took possession of the
ball again on their own 18 yard
line with just 3:49 on the score
board clock.
Stanford drove up to their 47
before Sandy Green, Bruin safe
ty, intercepted a Williams-to-
Washington pass on his 17.
Precious Seconds
The hopes of the Stanford
rooters sank immeasureably as
Gary Beban directed his team
in an attempt to run out the
1 minute and 37 seconds left in
the game.
But once more the Indian de
fense proved tough, and Beban
only used 35 of those precious
seconds before the Indians got
the ball again.
With 1:02 showing Williams
again got the Cards rolling. He
hit Buehler from the Indian 37
for 22 yards, but a mix-up with

the official call cost several valu
able seconds. The clock was
stopped by an incomplete pass
aimed at Bill Shoemaker.
Not Enough Time
With 13 seconds left Williams
hit Gene Washington, as he had
done all day. This time the pass
was good for 26 yards; but be
fore the clock could be stopped
with another incomplete pass, all
but 9 seconds were used up.
Nine seconds were not enough.
Williams had time for two more
plays. Both passes, however,
were high and out of the end
zone.

completions for 221 yards, one
touchdown, and 48 net yards on
the ground, many other Indians

12 of the 15 minutes of playing
time.
The Cards scored the final
tally of the day in that period
with 4:50 left in the game, mak
ing the score 21-16. The try for
the two-point conversion failed
as Williams' pass to George
Buehler fell incomplete.
The Indian defense then held
the Uclans to two yards, and the
Cards took possession of the
ball again on their own 18 yard
line with just 3:49 on the score
board clock.
Stanford drove up to their 47
before Sandy Green, Bruin safe
ty, intercepted a Williams-to-
Washington pass on his 17.
Precious Seconds
The hopes of the Stanford
rooters sank immeasureably as
Gary Beban directed his team
in an attempt to run out the
1 minute and 37 seconds left in
the game.
But once more the Indian de
fense proved tough, and Beban
only used 35 of those precious
seconds before the Indians got
the ball again.
With 1:02 showing Williams
again got the Cards rolling. He
hit Buehler from the Indian 37
for 22 yards, but a mix-up with

the official call cost several valu
able seconds. The clock was
stopped by an incomplete pass
aimed at Bill Shoemaker.
Not Enough Time
With 13 seconds left Williams
hit Gene Washington, as he had
done all day. This time the pass
was good for 26 yards; but be
fore the clock could be stopped
with another incomplete pass, all
but 9 seconds were used up.
Nine seconds were not enough.
Williams had time for two more
plays. Both passes, however,
were high and out of the end
zone.
Many Card Stars
Although Williams had 16
completions for 221 yards, one
touchdown, and 48 net yards on
the ground, many other Indians
starred in this great effort.
Aiding the Cardinal offensive
drives were Nate Kirtman, who
gained 67 net yards for the
Tribe; Jack Root who compiled
65 yards; and Gene Washington,
who pulled in 9 of Williams'
passes for a total of 99 yards.
Defensive standout was Line
man-of-the-Game Don Parish,
who made 10 tackles, 6 unassist
ed. Many of his tackles stopped
Beban end runs.
The "Great One"
However, it was Beban, dub
bed the "Great One," who engi
neered the Bruin victory. Beban
missed being named outstanding
back by only three votes, and his
81 yards on the ground and 50
yards in the air were largely
responsible for the Uclan win.
The 47,000 football fans who
were in Stanford Stadium got
an early indication of what the
UCLA part of this game would
be like. The first play of the
game saw Beban skirt around
his own left end for a gain of
12 yards.
On To Paydlrt
Fullback Rick Purdy, who
rushed for 60 yards during the
afternoon, next carried the ball
for a gain of 9. Two plays later
it was Beban around his right

this time for a gain of 7 and a
first down.
The pattern continued for 12
plays and 78 yards. When the
drive ended five minutes later,
the Bruins led 7-0.
Coach John Ralston credited
Beban's ability to get the first

down on the third-and-five (or
more) situation as the main
factor in the UCLA win.
The second time the Cards
got the ball in the first half
they drove in for their first
score. The crucial play in the
series was a fourth-and-one sit
uation on the Bruin 39.
With great poise, Williams,

rather than giving the ball to
Root for the familiar plunge up
the middle, stepped back and
threw a perfect pass to Shoe
maker, who beat his man to the
goal line.
On the first play of the sec
ond quarter Pat Preston picked
off a Beban pass and returned it
to the Bruin 42. Kirtman found
a huge hole off right tackle and
used a fine block from Wash
ington to move to the UCLA 12.
Cards Lead Briefly
The Card .drive stalled here,
but 3 points were salvaged with
a 27 yard field goal by Shoe
maker. The Indians led for the
only time in the game by a
score of 10-7.
This lead lasted until Beban
capped a 52-yard drive with an
11 yeard run to paydirt with
3:32 left in the half.
The Cards had a scoring op
portunity in the third period
when Williams, Root, Kirtman,
and Company advanced to the
Uclan 25; but the loss of 9 yards
on an attempted pass eliminated
even the possibility of a field
goal attempt.
The Bruins came back after
the terminated Stanford drive
with another toughdown. The
big play of this 80-yard series
was a Beban-to-Purdy pass for
30 yeards. A four yard Beban
sweep around right end gave
the Uclans the deciding score.

THE ELUSIVE BEBAN: "The Great One" was unable to get away on this end run as Bill Nicholson
(91), John de la Forest (68), and Tom Hazelrigg (85) close in for the kill. Hazelrigg here evades a
block thrown by Bruin fullback Rick Purdy. Hazelrigg and the other Stanford defensive ends Don
Parish and Stu Kellner received high praise from Coach John Ralston for their performance during
the afternoon.
The Bruins of UCLA narrow
ly edged the Indians Saturday
21-16 in what many Stanford
fans have described as the finest
game of football that the Cards
have played in several years.
Led by Back - of - the - Game
Chuck Williams, the Indians
were in the game until the last
second. At that point the Indians
had possession of the ball on
the Bruin 16 yardline, trailing
by less than a touchdown.
Stanford coach John Ralston
summed up the feelings of the
unhappy Card fans with his
simple post-game comment, "It
might have been."
Outstanding Last Quarter
The fourth quarter was all
Stanford's. The Indians had pos
session of the ball for more than
12 of the 15 minutes of playing
time.
