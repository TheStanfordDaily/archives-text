# IUC Program Open For Study In Russia
##

Applications for Stanford
graduate students and young
faculty to do research in the So
viet Union or Eastern Europe
in 1968-69 are due November 1.
Forms and information are
available at the International
Center.
One program is for language
teachers and another is for re
searchers in all fields. Both pro
grams are sponsored by the In
ter-University Committee on
Travel Grants. Seven or eight
Stanford students and faculty
members have participated in
the five years of the programs
existence.
Bob Phillips, foreign student
advisor at the I-Center, says that
participants come primarily to
do advanced research rather
than to become acquainted with
another culture.
These programs are about the
only opportunities for Ameri
cans to study in Russia, accord
ing to Phillips. "It is not as well
known as it should be," he added.
Acceptance Procedure
"The procedure for acceptance
is complicated," Phillips told the
Daily. Candidates are first
screened by the Inter-University
Committee on Travel Grants, lo
cated at Indiana University. Ac
ceptance is based on academic
excellence, maturity, emotional
stability, language proficiency,
and ability to benefit from the
proposed program. There are
more applicants than openings.
Candidates accepted by the
committee must also be ap
proved by the Russian Soviet
Ministry of Higher and Techni

cal Education for security rea
sons. The U.S. State Department
screens Russian candidates be
fore they come here and, accord
ing to Phillips, they have pro
hibited some individuals from
participating.
Efforts to expand the program
have failed. "The major factor
preventing expansion has been
the Vietnam war," Phillips notes.
Russia refuses to send more stu
dents here, and the State Depart
ment won't allow more Ameri
cans than Russians to partici
pate. Phillips believes the State
Department's attitude is "infan
tile." "We're only hurting our
selves," he asserts.

Dr. Ken Cooper, Associate
Dean of Graduate Division at
Stanford, agrees with Phillips
that the program should be
greatly expanded. Cooper, whose
duties include supervision of the
I-Center, supports free move
ment between the U.S. and Rus
sia. "These exchanges help open
up each other's societies, de
crease misunderstanding, and
promote cooperation," he says.
The National Academy of Sci
ences and The American Council
of Learned Societies also offer
exchange programs in some Iron
Curtain countries. Interested
persons may inquire at the I-
Center.
