The track will be open at 9:00
Saturday morning for practice
runs. Each participant will be
permitted two trial runs over the
half-mile course.
The winner will be determined
on the basis of comparative
times with each entry allowed

all possible assistance to com
petitors who have difficulties
with their finely tuned racing
machines.
