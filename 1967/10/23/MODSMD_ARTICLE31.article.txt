# Mendicants Release Album
## 
### JERRY FOGEL 
Perhaps the biggest challenge facing a close
harmony vocal group is originality. Most com
positions suited for close harmony have been
performed for years, and many arrangements
of these compositions are laden with musical
cliches.
Stanford's Mendicants have released an al
bum which squarely confronts this challenge.
Their program is varied, ranging from jazz to
Renaissance, and their arrangements, while
somewhat inconsistant in quality, reflect a con
siderable degree of innovative talent.
The album will be sold on campus next week.
There are moments when this record is truly
outstanding. The group's interpretation of
Francis Poulenc's prayer, "Seigneur, je votts en
pric" is an almost perfect blending of voices.
"I Hear a Voice", an exciting spiritual by Hous
ton Bright, features a lively battle of counter
melodies between the tenors and basses. It is
easily the most memorable cut on the album.
At other times the Mendicants sound too
much like the stereotype close harmony group
to be interesting. Although Errol Gay's version
of "This Could Be the Start of Something Big"
is creative, the song itself seems to block any
attempts to change its essentially banal nature.
In spite of John Winbigler's excellent solo on
"Moonlight in Vermont", one can't help feeling
he has heard this arrangement somewhere be
fore.
For the most part, however, the 1967 Men

dicants have acquitted themselves well. The
basses show more strength than the tenors and
baritones, but tenor soloists Peter Sly, Donald
Andrews, and Nile Norton have fine voices,
and Sly's performance of "Bermuda Buggy
Ride" is particularly good.
The group's effects in meeting the challenge
of originality are commendable. "My Funny
Valentine", an old standard which often is ex
tremely dull, has a warm, mellow sound in
Gay's arrangement. Bobby Timmons' "Moan
in' ", which the album jacket erroneously attri
butes to Jon Hendricks, is given a thorough
treatment in an adaptation by Anthony Anto
lini.
Not all of the originality is welcome. "Lazy
Bones" seems choppy and forced, though the
group does appear to be having a good time.
"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows" communicates
very little to the listener in spite of a pleasant
overall sound.
From a technical standpoint, this recording
is one which should be heard on good stereo
equipment, preferably with headphones. Close
harmony music loses most of its appeal without
adequate separation.
The fifteen Stanford men who perform as
the Mendicants are not full-time professionals.
They are students with diverse fields of study
and interest who happen to enjoy singing to
gether. That they have made an album worthy
of everyone's attention (and most listeners will
find it quite enjoyable) is an admirable accom
plishment.
