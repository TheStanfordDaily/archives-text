# Draft Demonstrators Wage Guerrilla War
## 
### 
The eight buses of inductees
finally did reach the Oakland in
duction center Friday, but only
after an organized crowd of
4000 barricaded the streets sur
rounding the Oakland induction
center in the largest protest of
Stop the Draft Week.
For hours a low-keyed gueril
la warfare took place, with
masses of demonstrators hem
ming in silent ranks of police
while other protestors blocked
intersections with disabled cars
and covered buildings with slo
gans written with red spray
paint.
It was, paradoxically, a paci
fist's riot; a restrained disorder.
Cars were disabled, but not
burned. The induction center
and city hall were defaced with
peace symbols, not obscenities.
When two youths japped out a
mail box to help barricade 14th
street, they were careful not to
spill any letters.
Disperse, Ye Rebels
When the police loudspeaker
blared, "You are ordered to dis
perse in the name of the people
of the state of California," thou
sands of demonstrators clogging
Clay Street shouted back, "We
are the people!"
The final day of Stop the
Draft Week had many fewer in
juries or arrests than Tuesday's
melee, with 28 persons arrested
in scattered incidents Friday and
about 18 police and demonstra
tors injured, none seriously. The
more than 2000 police, from sur
rounding communities as well
as Oakland, moved cautiously
and methodically in clearing the
streets.
The Berkeley activists who
led the demonstration apparent
ly never really expected to pre
vent the buses from reaching
the induction center. At the peak
of the disorder, one helmet-clad
"monitor" climbed on top of an
overturned garbage can on Clay
Street and said, "When the Na
tional Guard comes, we cut."
And when the police advanced,
the protestors fell back. The
goal seemed to be to cause as
much disruption as possible
without engaging the police in
hand-to-hand combat.
The extraordinary restraint of
the police, who feared bad press
coverage like Tuesday's allowed
the demonstrators to briefly

seize control of downtown Oak
land.
The confrontation began at
6:05 a.m. when the crowd defied
police by flooding into the inter
section of Clay and 15th Street,
blocking the induction center,
whose doors and windows were
soon covered with peace sym
bols and slogans.

A group of non-violent pick
ets, many from Stanford, at this
time moved away from the in
duction center to avoid the im
minent clash with police.
At 6:15 hundreds of Oakland
police and California highway
patrolmen pushed out of their
headquarters in a garage oppo-
site the induction center.
Confrontation
For almost an hour a semi-cir
cle of police faced the protestors.
Many in the front ranks of pro
testors wore motorcycle helmets
and carried shields for protec
tion. Finally, at 7:10, the police
pushed the crowd back in all
direction, from Clay Street,
using a few tear gas canisters.
Monitors shouting "Walk, don't
run" slowed the retreat. Soon
after, gangs of protestors start-

Ed blocking intersections. Clay
Street was jammed for several
blocks with disabled cars, trucks,
potted trees, newspaper stands,
and benches. Motorists were
turned back by obstructions and
masses of protestors.
Small groups of Oakland Ne
groes watched the disorders si
lently.
While the police held their
ranks, access to the induction
center was closed in all direc
tions.

turned back by obstructions and
masses of protestors.
Small groups of Oakland Ne
groes watched the disorders si
lently.
While the police held their
ranks, access to the induction
center was closed in all direc
tions.
The eight buses of inductees
finally did reach the Oakland in
duction center Friday, but only
after an organized crowd of
4000 barricaded the streets sur
rounding the Oakland induction
center in the largest protest of
Stop the Draft Week.
For hours a low-keyed gueril
la warfare took place, with
masses of demonstrators hem
ming in silent ranks of police
while other protestors blocked
intersections with disabled cars
and covered buildings with slo
gans written with red spray
paint.
It was, paradoxically, a paci
fist's riot; a restrained disorder.
Cars were disabled, but not
burned. The induction center
and city hall were defaced with
peace symbols, not obscenities.
When two youths japped out a
mail box to help barricade 14th
street, they were careful not to
spill any letters.
Disperse, Ye Rebels
When the police loudspeaker
blared, "You are ordered to dis
perse in the name of the people
of the state of California," thou

Clay Street shouted back, "We
are the people!"
The final day of Stop the
Draft Week had many fewer in
juries or arrests than Tuesday's
melee, with 28 persons arrested
in scattered incidents Friday and
about 18 police and demonstra
tors injured, none seriously. The
more than 2000 police, from sur
rounding communities as well
as Oakland, moved cautiously
and methodically in clearing the
streets.
The Berkeley activists who
led the demonstration apparent
ly never really expected to pre
vent the buses from reaching
the induction center. At the peak
of the disorder, one helmet-clad
"monitor" climbed on top of an
overturned garbage can on Clay
Street and said, "When the Na
tional Guard comes, we cut."
And when the police advanced,
the protestors fell back. The
goal seemed to be to cause as
much disruption as possible
without engaging the police in
hand-to-hand combat.
The extraordinary restraint of
the police, who feared bad press
coverage like Tuesday's allowed
the demonstrators to briefly

seize control of downtown Oak
land.
The confrontation began at
6:05 a.m. when the crowd defied
police by flooding into the inter
section of Clay and 15th Street,
blocking the induction center,
whose doors and windows were
soon covered with peace sym

A group of non-violent pick
