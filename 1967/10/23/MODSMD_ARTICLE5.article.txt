# Conservative Wing To Rule?
## Reagan Seeks Presidency? 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Ronald Reagan is running
hard for the Presidency of these
fifty states.
The California Governor has
consistently denied that he is a
candidate for the Republican
nomination but his actions dur-

dacy for the Republican pres
idential nomination around

ing the past several weeks have
cast doubt on his disavowal.
For a non-candidate Reagan
has spent too much of his time
out of state, too much of his
time speaking at fund - raising
dinners, and too much of his
time addressing himself to na
tional affairs.
His heavy political schedule

has included a visit to his alma
mater, Eureka College in Illi
nois, and political speeches in
South Carolina and Wisconsin,
all during the past two weeks.
Recently Reagan addressed a
$10 - a - plate fund-raising dinner
in Louisville. His talk was a
straight attack on the current
Democratic administration. The
speech had an old-fashioned po
litical tone: "It is our destiny,
the destiny of our party, to raise
a banner for the people of all
parties to follow," said the Gov
ernor.
This political journey wasn't
an isolated incident, but a pre
cursor of the next few months.
After he returns from the cur
rent Governors' conference
Reagan will visit lowa, Kansas,
Texas, Illinois, and Ohio. Most
of these states were in Richard
Nixon's electoral vote column in
1960. Nixon is Reagan's major
conservative opponent for the
nomination.

In fact most observers con
sider Nixon to be Reagan's only
competitor from the conserva
tive wing of the party. It is
Nixon's potential strength at the
convention to which Reagan
seems to be addressing himself.
The New York Times reported
on October 8 that one-half of

Reagan's time will be spent out
side the state delivering
speeches.
The first test of Reagan's can
didacy will come in the New
Hampshire and Wisconsin pri
maries. It will be in those two
primaries that Nixon must show
that he still has the potential to
gather votes. If Reagan can
show enough strength through
a write-in campaign in those
states to take away a sizable
chunk of Nixon's vote, his po
litical star will so;
Reagan also mad two major
pronouncements on national af
fairs within two days the week
end before last.
On Saturday Reagan attacked
the Federal government as an
overgrown bureaucracy which
has "repudiated the constitu
tional concepts of individual
freedom, local authority, and
states' rights ... a little intel
lectual elite in the nation's cap
