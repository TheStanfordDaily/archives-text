# Conservative Wing To Rule?
## Reagan Seeks Presidency? 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Ronald Reagan is running
hard for the Presidency of these
fifty states.
The California Governor has
consistently denied that he is a
candidate for the Republican
nomination but his actions dur-

dacy for the Republican pres
idential nomination around

ported Sunday.

ing the past several weeks have
cast doubt on his disavowal.
For a non-candidate Reagan
has spent too much of his time
out of state, too much of his
time speaking at fund - raising
dinners, and too much of his
time addressing himself to na
tional affairs.
His heavy political schedule

has included a visit to his alma
mater, Eureka College in Illi
nois, and political speeches in
South Carolina and Wisconsin,
all during the past two weeks.
Recently Reagan addressed a
$10 - a - plate fund-raising dinner
in Louisville. His talk was a
straight attack on the current
Democratic administration. The
speech had an old-fashioned po
litical tone: "It is our destiny,
the destiny of our party, to raise
a banner for the people of all
parties to follow," said the Gov
ernor.
This political journey wasn't
an isolated incident, but a pre
cursor of the next few months.
After he returns from the cur
rent Governors' conference
Reagan will visit lowa, Kansas,
Texas, Illinois, and Ohio. Most
of these states were in Richard
Nixon's electoral vote column in
1960. Nixon is Reagan's major
conservative opponent for the
nomination.

In fact most observers con
sider Nixon to be Reagan's only
competitor from the conserva
tive wing of the party. It is
Nixon's potential strength at the
convention to which Reagan
seems to be addressing himself.
The New York Times reported
on October 8 that one-half of

Reagan's time will be spent out
side the state delivering
speeches.
The first test of Reagan's can
didacy will come in the New
Hampshire and Wisconsin pri
maries. It will be in those two
primaries that Nixon must show
that he still has the potential to
gather votes. If Reagan can
show enough strength through
a write-in campaign in those
states to take away a sizable
chunk of Nixon's vote, his po
litical star will so;
Reagan also mad two major
pronouncements on national af
fairs within two days the week
end before last.
On Saturday Reagan attacked
the Federal government as an
overgrown bureaucracy which
has "repudiated the constitu
tional concepts of individual
freedom, local authority, and
states' rights ... a little intel
lectual elite in the nation's cap

He dated this overgrown bu
reaucracy from 1960, the date
the Democrats took office.
Major Speech Made
On Sunday, Reagan made a
major pronouncement about
Vietnam on ABC's "Issues and
Answers" television program.
He accused President Johnson
of hiding the fact that the Al
lied forces are winning the war
in Vietnam, so that he can use
that fact to political advantage
next fall.
Indicators that Reagan wanted
to run for the Presidency can
be seen at least as far back as
February 12. On that date he
went on a speaking tour of Ore
gon, meeting with a group of
80 fund-raisers and large con
tributors. At that time Reagan
refused to state that he would
not allow his name to be placed
on the Oregon primary ballot.
Since then he has consistently
refused to take a General Sher
man-like stand on the election
("I will not run if nominated; I
will not serve if elected"). Rea
gan has said that this sort of
stand would be "presumptuous
and ridiculous."
Only last week, though, he
asked a committee in New
Hampshire not to work for his
write - in selection in the pri
mary. But he has repeatedly
said that he would accept a
draft.
Why Can He Win?
An obvious question must be,
why does Governor Reagan
think that he can be President?
Few people if any can know
intimately what goes on in Rea
gan's mind, but some reasonable
guesses can be hazarded.
First, Reagan has consistently
said that he feels that Barry
Goldwater would have won the
1964 election if he had not been
"betrayed" by certain members
of the Republican party. Rea

gan probably thus feels that if
the Republican party were to
unite behind a conservative can
didate in 1968, he would win.
It is quite plain that there are
only two conservative candi
dates running for the Presi
dency: Reagan and Nixon. Rea
gan probably feels that he has

more vote-getting power. After
all, Nixon had been defeated in
1962 by 300,000 votes in his at
tempt to become the Governor
of California, the post which
Reagan took from the same
man Nixon ran against (Pat
Brown) only four years later by
1,000,000 votes.

time addressing himself to na

His heavy political schedule

has included a visit to his alma
mater, Eureka College in Illi
nois, and political speeches in
South Carolina and Wisconsin,
all during the past two weeks.
Recently Reagan addressed a
$10 - a - plate fund-raising dinner
in Louisville. His talk was a
straight attack on the current
Democratic administration. The
speech had an old-fashioned po
litical tone: "It is our destiny,
the destiny of our party, to raise
a banner for the people of all
parties to follow," said the Gov
ernor.
This political journey wasn't
an isolated incident, but a pre
cursor of the next few months.
After he returns from the cur
rent Governors' conference
Reagan will visit lowa, Kansas,
Texas, Illinois, and Ohio. Most
of these states were in Richard
Nixon's electoral vote column in
1960. Nixon is Reagan's major
conservative opponent for the
nomination.

In fact most observers con
sider Nixon to be Reagan's only
competitor from the conserva
tive wing of the party. It is
Nixon's potential strength at the
convention to which Reagan
seems to be addressing himself.
The New York Times reported
on October 8 that one-half of

Reagan's time will be spent out
side the state delivering
speeches.
The first test of Reagan's can
didacy will come in the New
Hampshire and Wisconsin pri
maries. It will be in those two
primaries that Nixon must show
that he still has the potential to
gather votes. If Reagan can
show enough strength through
a write-in campaign in those
states to take away a sizable
chunk of Nixon's vote, his po
litical star will so;

pronouncements on national af

reaucracy from 1960, the date

Major Speech Made
On Sunday, Reagan made a
major pronouncement about
Vietnam on ABC's "Issues and
Answers" television program.
He accused President Johnson
of hiding the fact that the Al
lied forces are winning the war
in Vietnam, so that he can use
that fact to political advantage
next fall.
Indicators that Reagan wanted
to run for the Presidency can
be seen at least as far back as
February 12. On that date he
went on a speaking tour of Ore
gon, meeting with a group of
80 fund-raisers and large con
tributors. At that time Reagan
refused to state that he would
not allow his name to be placed
on the Oregon primary ballot.
Since then he has consistently
refused to take a General Sher
man-like stand on the election
("I will not run if nominated; I
will not serve if elected"). Rea
gan has said that this sort of
stand would be "presumptuous
and ridiculous."
Only last week, though, he
asked a committee in New
Hampshire not to work for his
write - in selection in the pri
mary. But he has repeatedly
said that he would accept a
draft.
Why Can He Win?
An obvious question must be,
why does Governor Reagan
think that he can be President?
Few people if any can know
intimately what goes on in Rea
gan's mind, but some reasonable
guesses can be hazarded.
First, Reagan has consistently
said that he feels that Barry
Goldwater would have won the
1964 election if he had not been
"betrayed" by certain members
of the Republican party. Rea

gan probably thus feels that if
the Republican party were to
unite behind a conservative can
didate in 1968, he would win.
It is quite plain that there are
only two conservative candi
dates running for the Presi
dency: Reagan and Nixon. Rea
gan probably feels that he has

more vote-getting power. After
all, Nixon had been defeated in
1962 by 300,000 votes in his at
tempt to become the Governor
of California, the post which
Reagan took from the same
man Nixon ran against (Pat
Brown) only four years later by
1,000,000 votes.
Ronald Reagan is running
hard for the Presidency of these
fifty states.
The California Governor has

After he returns from the cur
rent Governors' conference
Reagan will visit lowa, Kansas,
Texas, Illinois, and Ohio. Most
of these states were in Richard
Nixon's electoral vote column in
1960. Nixon is Reagan's major
conservative opponent for the
nomination.

In fact most observers con
sider Nixon to be Reagan's only
competitor from the conserva
tive wing of the party. It is
Nixon's potential strength at the
convention to which Reagan
seems to be addressing himself.
The New York Times reported
on October 8 that one-half of

Reagan's time will be spent out
side the state delivering
speeches.
The first test of Reagan's can
didacy will come in the New
Hampshire and Wisconsin pri
maries. It will be in those two
primaries that Nixon must show
that he still has the potential to
gather votes. If Reagan can
show enough strength through
a write-in campaign in those
states to take away a sizable
chunk of Nixon's vote, his po
litical star will so;

pronouncements on national af

He dated this overgrown bu
reaucracy from 1960, the date
the Democrats took office.
Major Speech Made
On Sunday, Reagan made a
major pronouncement about
Vietnam on ABC's "Issues and
Answers" television program.
He accused President Johnson
of hiding the fact that the Al
lied forces are winning the war
in Vietnam, so that he can use
that fact to political advantage
next fall.
Indicators that Reagan wanted
to run for the Presidency can
be seen at least as far back as
February 12. On that date he
went on a speaking tour of Ore
gon, meeting with a group of
80 fund-raisers and large con
tributors. At that time Reagan
refused to state that he would
not allow his name to be placed
on the Oregon primary ballot.
Since then he has consistently
refused to take a General Sher
man-like stand on the election
("I will not run if nominated; I
will not serve if elected"). Rea
gan has said that this sort of
stand would be "presumptuous
and ridiculous."
Only last week, though, he
asked a committee in New
Hampshire not to work for his
write - in selection in the pri
mary. But he has repeatedly
said that he would accept a
draft.
Why Can He Win?
An obvious question must be,
why does Governor Reagan
think that he can be President?
Few people if any can know
intimately what goes on in Rea
gan's mind, but some reasonable
guesses can be hazarded.
First, Reagan has consistently
said that he feels that Barry
Goldwater would have won the
1964 election if he had not been
"betrayed" by certain members
of the Republican party. Rea

gan probably thus feels that if
the Republican party were to
unite behind a conservative can
didate in 1968, he would win.
It is quite plain that there are
only two conservative candi
dates running for the Presi
dency: Reagan and Nixon. Rea
gan probably feels that he has

more vote-getting power. After
all, Nixon had been defeated in
1962 by 300,000 votes in his at
tempt to become the Governor
of California, the post which
Reagan took from the same
man Nixon ran against (Pat
Brown) only four years later by
1,000,000 votes.
Ronald Reagan is running
hard for the Presidency of these
fifty states.
The California Governor has
consistently denied that he is a
candidate for the Republican
nomination but his actions dur-

dacy for the Republican pres
idential nomination around

ing the past several weeks have
cast doubt on his disavowal.
For a non-candidate Reagan
has spent too much of his time
out of state, too much of his
time speaking at fund - raising
dinners, and too much of his
time addressing himself to na
tional affairs.
His heavy political schedule

has included a visit to his alma
mater, Eureka College in Illi
nois, and political speeches in
South Carolina and Wisconsin,
all during the past two weeks.
Recently Reagan addressed a
$10 - a - plate fund-raising dinner
in Louisville. His talk was a
straight attack on the current
Democratic administration. The
speech had an old-fashioned po
litical tone: "It is our destiny,
the destiny of our party, to raise
a banner for the people of all
parties to follow," said the Gov
ernor.
