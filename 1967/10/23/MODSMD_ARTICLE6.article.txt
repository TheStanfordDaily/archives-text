At least 35 members of the
Stanford community were in
prison this weekend, serving sen
tences stemming from last
week's anti-draft demonstrations
at the Oakland Armed Forces
Induction Center.
Six arrested Stanford students
served five days on disturbing
the-peace charges and were re
leased late last week from the
Alameda County Jail (Santa
Rita).
Ten persons had their ten-day
sentences converted to five week
end sentences and served the
first of these this weekend.

Most of the remainder, includ
ing former ASSU president
David Harris, are now serving
ten-day sentences for disturbing
the peace. They are due to be
released this week.
Four others, arrested Tuesday,
have had their cases continued.
One of them is charged with a
felony.
Philosophy instructor Bruce
Landesman, who said he had
"decided not to sit-in or do any
thing that would lead to my
getting arrested or hurt," was
arrested Tuesday and charged
with assaulting a police officer
with a deadly weapon.
Seek Witnesses
He is free on $3300 bail. "Four
or five friends put in their life
savings to get me out," he said.
He is looking now for witnesses
who can testify to his innocence.
Landesman said he remem
bers Tuesday seeing something
fall with a metallic clang into a
group of policemen at 14th and
Clay Sts. in Oakland near the
intersection. The police were
moving to that intersection to
look into an incident ; nvolving
a surrounded car, he said.
He added he did not see what
the thrown object was or who
threw it. Minutes later he was
arrested, held in a police car for
twenty minutes without being
told why, then taken to city jail
and charged with the assault.
He was arraigned Wednesday
and released on bail that night.
His first court appearance, for
