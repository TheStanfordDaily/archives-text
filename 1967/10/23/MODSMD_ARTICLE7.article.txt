# Stanford-In-Santa Rita
## Down On The (Prison) Farm 
### 
A picture of what things were
like at the Oakland City Jail
and at Santa Rita County Jail
is emerging from accounts of
anti-draft demonstrators arrest
ed and jailed last week.
The ex-cons gave the Oakland
jail bad reviews. One student
spoke of the terrible food—"God
awful beans with chopped up
horsemeat and just a little bit
of cabbage: and runny oatmeal
for breakfast."
The jail was described as a
sterile, well-run instittuion. The
small waiting cells there had no
windows: one lost all sense of
time because there were no
clocks and all watches were con
fiscated. The Bible was the only
book the prisoners were allowed.
Many students mentioned that
the way the police overcrowded
the cells made the time spent in
Oakland somewhat uncomfort
able.
Light Security
One Stanford student said
that he thought the demonstra
tors were being held under me
dium security. He recalled being
put in a cell with "murderers
and rapists." The Oakland jail
guards seemed deliberately lax
and inefficient in bringing medi
cation to two prisoners. One was
an epileptic: the other had a
thyroid deficiency.
Economics graduate student
Bernard Wasow was arrested
Tuesday and put in medium se
curity East Greystone after he
was brought to Santa Rita from
Oakland. "East Greystone is
where they regularly put people
they can't handle even in West

Greystone," according to Wa
sow.
His group of five who had
gone before the judge together
were put into different cells.
Each cell in Greystone was a
metal cage, six and a half feet
by six and a half feet.
According to Wasow's cell
mate, all the prisoners in Grey
stone were felons. The cellmate
himself was in on four narcotics
charges, had no bail assigned,
was a parole violator, and was
facing a sentence of from ten
years to life.
Constricting, Noisy
Twice a week Greystone in
mates were allowed to leave
their cells for forty-five minutes
or so to shave and shower.
Wasow said Greystone was
noisy all night and all day. Pris
oners banging on walls, hitting
their heads against the bars,
screaming and shouting homo
sexual jokes. Things quiet down
a little around 1 a.m.
But at 2 a.m. the guards come
for those who are to appear in
court at Oakland.

In Greystone one is basically
served only two meals a day.
Dinner is coffe or tea (no choice,
whichever they give you) and
bread.
Most of the demonstrators
were kept in what is called "the
compound." This is the prison
farm part of the Rehabilitation
Center.
The Ride Over
Some of the Phi Psis who
were arrested said the people in
his busload going from Oakland
to Santa Rita really disturbed
their bus driver. The windows
to the bus were made of plastic
which broke up light like a
prism.
The arrested demonstrators
were enjoying the free light
show, but the bus driver could
not figure what it was all about
and why they kept saying
"Wow."
Some demonstrators would
have liked to mingle freely with
the other prisoners in Santa
Rita. But all the demonstrators
were kept strictly separated
from the other prisoners.

They were told it was for their
own safety and that the other
prisoners were "just like ani
mals," which the demonstrators
did not enjoy hearing.
Some demonstrators t a 1 ke d
briefly with Mario Savio, serv
ing time at Santa Rita for his
violations of the law during the
days of the Free Speech Move
ment.
The eight demonstrators who
said they were macrobiotics
were allowed a special diet. One
person fasted, having only tea
and water while he was at San
ta Rita.
The regular prisoners at the
Rehabilitation Cen te r were
mainly Negroes and Mexican-
Americans. The Negroes, espe
cially the young Negroes,
seemed to be sympathetic to
cause of the anti-draft demon
strators. Trusties and prisoners
who had been at Santa Rita a
long time tended to resent the
protesters' "conquering hero" at
titude and special privileges
from the prison administration.

served only two meals a day.

The Ride Over
Some of the Phi Psis who
were arrested said the people in
his busload going from Oakland
to Santa Rita really disturbed
their bus driver. The windows
to the bus were made of plastic
which broke up light like a
prism.
The arrested demonstrators
were enjoying the free light
show, but the bus driver could
not figure what it was all about
and why they kept saying
"Wow."
Some demonstrators would
have liked to mingle freely with
the other prisoners in Santa
Rita. But all the demonstrators
were kept strictly separated
from the other prisoners.

They were told it was for their
own safety and that the other
prisoners were "just like ani
mals," which the demonstrators
did not enjoy hearing.
Some demonstrators t a 1 ke d
briefly with Mario Savio, serv
ing time at Santa Rita for his
violations of the law during the
days of the Free Speech Move
ment.
The eight demonstrators who
said they were macrobiotics
were allowed a special diet. One
person fasted, having only tea
and water while he was at San
ta Rita.
The regular prisoners at the
Rehabilitation Cen te r were
mainly Negroes and Mexican-
Americans. The Negroes, espe
cially the young Negroes,
seemed to be sympathetic to
cause of the anti-draft demon
strators. Trusties and prisoners
who had been at Santa Rita a
long time tended to resent the
protesters' "conquering hero" at
titude and special privileges
from the prison administration.
A picture of what things were
like at the Oakland City Jail
and at Santa Rita County Jail
is emerging from accounts of
anti-draft demonstrators arrest
ed and jailed last week.
The ex-cons gave the Oakland
jail bad reviews. One student
spoke of the terrible food—"God
awful beans with chopped up
horsemeat and just a little bit
of cabbage: and runny oatmeal
for breakfast."
The jail was described as a
sterile, well-run instittuion. The
small waiting cells there had no
windows: one lost all sense of
time because there were no
clocks and all watches were con
fiscated. The Bible was the only
book the prisoners were allowed.
Many students mentioned that
the way the police overcrowded
the cells made the time spent in
Oakland somewhat uncomfort
able.
Light Security
One Stanford student said
that he thought the demonstra
tors were being held under me
dium security. He recalled being
put in a cell with "murderers
and rapists." The Oakland jail
guards seemed deliberately lax
and inefficient in bringing medi
cation to two prisoners. One was
an epileptic: the other had a
thyroid deficiency.
Economics graduate student
Bernard Wasow was arrested
Tuesday and put in medium se
curity East Greystone after he
was brought to Santa Rita from
Oakland. "East Greystone is
where they regularly put people
they can't handle even in West

Greystone," according to Wa
sow.
His group of five who had
gone before the judge together
were put into different cells.
Each cell in Greystone was a
metal cage, six and a half feet
by six and a half feet.
According to Wasow's cell
mate, all the prisoners in Grey
stone were felons. The cellmate
himself was in on four narcotics
charges, had no bail assigned,
was a parole violator, and was
facing a sentence of from ten
years to life.

Twice a week Greystone in
mates were allowed to leave
their cells for forty-five minutes

Wasow said Greystone was
noisy all night and all day. Pris

their heads against the bars,
screaming and shouting homo
sexual jokes. Things quiet down
a little around 1 a.m.

the cells made the time spent in
Oakland somewhat uncomfort
able.
Light Security
One Stanford student said
that he thought the demonstra
tors were being held under me
dium security. He recalled being
put in a cell with "murderers
and rapists." The Oakland jail
guards seemed deliberately lax
and inefficient in bringing medi
cation to two prisoners. One was
an epileptic: the other had a
thyroid deficiency.
Economics graduate student
Bernard Wasow was arrested
Tuesday and put in medium se
curity East Greystone after he
was brought to Santa Rita from
Oakland. "East Greystone is
where they regularly put people
they can't handle even in West

Greystone," according to Wa
sow.
His group of five who had
gone before the judge together
were put into different cells.
Each cell in Greystone was a
metal cage, six and a half feet
by six and a half feet.
According to Wasow's cell
mate, all the prisoners in Grey
stone were felons. The cellmate
himself was in on four narcotics
charges, had no bail assigned,
was a parole violator, and was
facing a sentence of from ten
years to life.
Constricting, Noisy
Twice a week Greystone in
mates were allowed to leave
their cells for forty-five minutes
or so to shave and shower.
Wasow said Greystone was
noisy all night and all day. Pris
oners banging on walls, hitting
their heads against the bars,
screaming and shouting homo
sexual jokes. Things quiet down
a little around 1 a.m.
But at 2 a.m. the guards come
for those who are to appear in
court at Oakland.

In Greystone one is basically
served only two meals a day.
Dinner is coffe or tea (no choice,
whichever they give you) and
bread.
Most of the demonstrators
were kept in what is called "the
compound." This is the prison
farm part of the Rehabilitation
Center.
The Ride Over
Some of the Phi Psis who
were arrested said the people in
his busload going from Oakland
to Santa Rita really disturbed
their bus driver. The windows
to the bus were made of plastic
which broke up light like a
prism.
The arrested demonstrators
were enjoying the free light
show, but the bus driver could
not figure what it was all about
and why they kept saying
"Wow."
Some demonstrators would
have liked to mingle freely with
the other prisoners in Santa
Rita. But all the demonstrators
were kept strictly separated
from the other prisoners.

They were told it was for their
own safety and that the other
prisoners were "just like ani
mals," which the demonstrators
did not enjoy hearing.
Some demonstrators t a 1 ke d
briefly with Mario Savio, serv
ing time at Santa Rita for his
violations of the law during the
days of the Free Speech Move
ment.
The eight demonstrators who
said they were macrobiotics
were allowed a special diet. One
person fasted, having only tea
and water while he was at San
ta Rita.
The regular prisoners at the
Rehabilitation Cen te r were
mainly Negroes and Mexican-
Americans. The Negroes, espe
cially the young Negroes,
seemed to be sympathetic to
cause of the anti-draft demon
strators. Trusties and prisoners
who had been at Santa Rita a
long time tended to resent the
protesters' "conquering hero" at
titude and special privileges
from the prison administration.
