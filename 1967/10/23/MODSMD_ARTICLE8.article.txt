# Ballot Holds Paly's Future
## 
### 
Palo Alto voters will determ
ine tomorrow the fate of Propo
sitions A and B, two school bond
issues that could affect the qual
ity of primary and secondary
education in this area for the
next decade.
The basic issue of the election

is whether a new Palo Alto
High School will be built. Prop
osition A would provide $7.5 mil
lion to remodel the high school
and upgrade other district build
ings.
Most of the controversy con
cerns Proposition B, which
would approve the construction
of an entirely new high school,
providing an extra $2.6 million
to replace the present 1918
structure.
In February of this year
voters defeated an $11 million
bond that would have financed
a new Paly High. Although they
approved the measure by a 64
per cent favorable vote, a two

thirds, or 66.7 per cent margin
was needed.
A citizens' committee recom
mended resubmission of a lower
$9 million bond. In an extremely
controversial decision, the
Board of Education rejected this
proposal and instead submitted
the dual ballot to the voters, on
the half-a-loaf-is-better-than
none theory that passage of A
is virtually certain.
Many proponents of the new
high school are urging a no-yes
vote on the two propositions,
fearing that the passage of A
and the defeat of B would effec
tively block the possibility of
getting the new building.
