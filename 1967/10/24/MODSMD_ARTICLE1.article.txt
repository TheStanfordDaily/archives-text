# Executive Committee To Meet On Academic Senate Proposal
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The executive committee of
the Academic Council will meet
this afternoon to consider how
the plan for a new academic
senate will be ratified by the fac
ulty.
Either the Academic Council
itself or a special "constitutional
convention" for faculty could
ratify the draft plan which the
executive committee hopes to
complete by the end of this quar
ter, according to chairman Ken
neth J. Arrow.
Joseph Pettit, dean of the en
gineering school, urged at a
hearing last week that a conven
tion approve the senate plan to

ensure greater acceptability
among the faculty.
The academic or faculty sen
ate proposal would create a legi
slative body of about 70 elected
members to take over the func
-tions of the unwieldy Academic
Council, which has 900 members.
The Academic Council would
retain a veto over decisions of
the faculty senate, and some
arrangement is envisioned to
appeal senate decisions to the
entire Council.
The controversial plan to in
clude five administration and
five student members in the sen
ate is probably dead. At the hear
ing before the executive com
mittee Oct. 18, two Academic
Council members opposed stu
dent membership.
Vice Provost Herbert Packer
urged students be members of
senate committees only, but that
the University president, pro
vosts and deans be made ex
officio members because of their
important role in executing sen
ate decisions.
Pettit said only Academic
Council members should be eli
gible for senate membership,

but proposed more joint faculty
student committees on the model
of the Committee of Fifteen.
The original proposal for ad
ministration and student mem
bership in the faculty senate,
contained in a June 13 memoran
dum outlining the senate plan,
was strongly opposed by ASSU
President Peter Lyman. He told
the executive committee such
token membership would give
the senate the appearance of a
broades, University decision
making body and hinder funda
mental reform of University
government.
Lyman also warned that he
would ask students not to serve
on the faculty senate as it was
envisioned in the June 13 memo.
But the issue of student or
administration representation is
unimportant to most faculty,
who are more concerned about
the number of representatives
each department or school will
be allotted in the senate.
The June 13 memo, prepared
by a special subcommittee of the
Academic Council executive com
mittee, apportioned representa
tives to schools according to

the number of faculty members
in each. On this basis the medi
cal school had 14 members.
Since then much opposition
has developed to this "one-fac
ulty-one-vote" system, especial
ly because of the large represen
tation given the Medical School.
A "student accountability" stan
dard has been proposed as an
alternative, apportioning repre
sentatives according to the num
ber of students enrolled in each
department.
Packer and Pettif spoke in
favor of "student accountabil
ity" at the Oct. 18 hearing.

Prof. Henry Kaplan objected
to the "student accountability"
plan, pointing out that the med
ical faculty have "clinical re
sponsibilities" justifying a large
representation in the faculty sen
ate.
Arrow said the executive com
mittee, which has been author
ized by the Academic Council to
draft the final senate proposal
has yet to make a final decision
on the representation issues. He
suggested that some compromise
might be made between the
"once - faculty - one - vote" plan
and "student accountability."

bership in the faculty senate,
contained in a June 13 memoran
dum outlining the senate plan,
was strongly opposed by ASSU
President Peter Lyman. He told
the executive committee such
token membership would give
the senate the appearance of a
broades, University decision
making body and hinder funda
mental reform of University
government.
Lyman also warned that he
would ask students not to serve
on the faculty senate as it was
envisioned in the June 13 memo.
But the issue of student or
administration representation is
unimportant to most faculty,
who are more concerned about
the number of representatives
each department or school will
be allotted in the senate.
The June 13 memo, prepared
by a special subcommittee of the
Academic Council executive com
mittee, apportioned representa
tives to schools according to

the number of faculty members
in each. On this basis the medi
cal school had 14 members.
Since then much opposition
has developed to this "one-fac
ulty-one-vote" system, especial
ly because of the large represen
tation given the Medical School.
A "student accountability" stan
dard has been proposed as an
alternative, apportioning repre
sentatives according to the num
ber of students enrolled in each
department.
Packer and Pettif spoke in
favor of "student accountabil
ity" at the Oct. 18 hearing.

Prof. Henry Kaplan objected
to the "student accountability"
plan, pointing out that the med
ical faculty have "clinical re
sponsibilities" justifying a large
representation in the faculty sen
ate.
Arrow said the executive com
mittee, which has been author
ized by the Academic Council to
draft the final senate proposal
has yet to make a final decision
on the representation issues. He
suggested that some compromise
might be made between the
"once - faculty - one - vote" plan
and "student accountability."


FINAL ADJUSTMENTS ON ORGAN — The new organ for Dink
elspiel Auditorium will be dedicated Sunday afternoon at 3:30. It is
being installed by Gerhard Hradetsky of Austria at a cost of $32,500.
The executive committee of
the Academic Council will meet
this afternoon to consider how
the plan for a new academic
senate will be ratified by the fac
ulty.
Either the Academic Council
itself or a special "constitutional
convention" for faculty could
ratify the draft plan which the
executive committee hopes to
complete by the end of this quar
ter, according to chairman Ken
neth J. Arrow.
Joseph Pettit, dean of the en
gineering school, urged at a
hearing last week that a conven
tion approve the senate plan to

ensure greater acceptability
among the faculty.
The academic or faculty sen
ate proposal would create a legi
slative body of about 70 elected
members to take over the func
-tions of the unwieldy Academic
Council, which has 900 members.
The Academic Council would
retain a veto over decisions of
the faculty senate, and some
arrangement is envisioned to
appeal senate decisions to the
entire Council.
The controversial plan to in
clude five administration and
five student members in the sen
ate is probably dead. At the hear
ing before the executive com
mittee Oct. 18, two Academic
Council members opposed stu
dent membership.
Vice Provost Herbert Packer
urged students be members of
senate committees only, but that
the University president, pro
vosts and deans be made ex
officio members because of their
important role in executing sen
ate decisions.
Pettit said only Academic
Council members should be eli
gible for senate membership,

but proposed more joint faculty
student committees on the model
of the Committee of Fifteen.
