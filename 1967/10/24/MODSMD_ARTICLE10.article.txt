# Student Firemen Get First Pay Raise Since 1930s
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Amid the recent complaints by grad
uate students of low pay and poor
working conditions, the story has un
folded of a four-month struggle last
spring by Stanford's student firemen
which won them a 240 per cent pay
raise from the University.
Between February and June 1967,
the 12-member Stanford Student Fire
men's Association gradually became a
collective bargaining agent negotiat
ing with the University for the mini
mum wage guaranteed by the Fair
Labor Standards Act, effective last
Feb. 1.
At that time the firemen received
$25 per month cash and free room in
the barracks-like old fire station on
Santa Teresa street. They had not
received a raise since the 1930'5. In re
turn they were on fire duty every other
day of the week and required tostay
at the fire station 24 hours each week
end.
After four months of letters, inter
vention by the National Labor Rela
tions Board and face-to-face bargain
ing, the firemen won a June 9 contract
raising their pay to $70 a month and
limiting their monthly work time to
94 hours.
Fire chief John Marston encouraged
the students in their request. For a
while he convoyed information between
the students and the University busi
ness office, which sets police and fire
salaries.
The low pay and long hours of stu
dent firemen dated back to the organi

zation of the fire department 70 years
ago. Then all firemen were students,
but now the University has hired 23
full-time firemen as well.
The students do the same work as
regular firemen, sometimes answering
several emergency calls a night. Dur
ing a year they answer more than 700
calls.
Tuition rose from $100 per quarter
in 1933 to $525 in 1967, but the stu
dent firemen's salaries rose only from
$20 to $25.
"The student firemen were always
complaining, but until this year they
never formalized their compJaints,"
said one student fireman who did not
wish to be identified.
"We weren't being paid enough,
especially considering we were risking
our lives as firemen," he said. "Hut in
the past, the students always said 'Why
bitch? We're only going to be here a
few more years'."
But in January, 1967, the students
went to Marston to discuss a raise. He
suggested they wait until amendments
to the Fair Labor Standards Act made
it applicable Feb. 1 to all college em
ployees, requiring a minimum hourly
wage of $1.15, rising to $1.30 a year
later.
So on Feb. 9 the students wrote to
the University, "We, the Stanford Stu
dent Firemen, respectfully request a
raise." They asked $75 a month.
The business office never replied. In
stead, they discussed the pay issue
with Marston.
So the students wrote to the U.S.

Labor Department office in San Fran
cisco, describing their pay and work
ing conditions and asking for an "in
terpretation" of the new law. Ten fire
men signed the letter.
Another message was sent to the
business office, this time requesting a
raise to $85.
In March Phillip L. Cranford of the
National Labor Relations Board came
to Stanford and talked with the Uni
versity and the firemen.
The Feds Hesitate
"In essence he told us that the fed
eral government was afraid to back up
the new law until a precedent was
established," said a student fireman.
"All he would do was stand by and
make sure that the University and the
(iremen's association got together and
reached an agreement."
Cranford reportedly told the Uni
versity it had to deal with the student
association.
But nothing happened.
"There was a continual fear that
if we bitched too much the University
would do away with student firemen
altogether," a fireman commented. "We
didn't tell The Daily about our efforts
because of that."
As dead week approached in May
the firemen felt time was running out.
They finally arranged a meeting
through Marston with the business
office.
Two bargaining sessions ensued be
tween three student firemen and S.F.
Post, assistant business manager. In

the first three-hour meeting, little was
accomplished.
According to student firemen, "Our
approach was to illustrate to Post the
University's gain in having student
firemen—the money savings over regu
lar firemen, and the advantage of hav
ing plenty of people on call. But we
got zero."
The students went into a second
session with Post "determined to do
business."
The firemen asked $75. Post offered
$65. They settled on $70, with room
compensation imputed at $31. Fire
men's hours were nominally fixed at
94, a considerable achievement in the
eyes of the students since it enables
them to demand at least the minimum
hourly wage.
Post commented yesterday that "We
have a fine bunch of student firemen.
They're intelligent epople. We recog
nize their problem. In our agreement
they're getting a break and the Uni
versity's getting a break."
"For a long time we recognized that
the student firemen were not getting
reimbursed in recognition of their
work," he said. "We were planning to
give them a raise, and then the law was
changed and we complied with it."
He said that the pay negotiations
were protracted because the business
office worked "through channels."
But whether or not they have a union,
things are looking up for the long-suf
fering student firemen. They'll get an
other pay raise Feb. 1 and will move
into more spacious living quarters in


LINGERING TRADITION — Until last year Stanford's fire depart
ment showed its long; history and traditions in other ways besides
displaying the antiquated equipment shown above. The wages of
student firemen hadn't been changed since th« 1930'5.
