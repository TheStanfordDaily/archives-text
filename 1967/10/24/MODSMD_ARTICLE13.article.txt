## LBJ's New Advisor 
### Philip Taubman 
(The words of Dr. Davis in the
following column are taken
from a report in THE NEW
YORK TIMES, Monday, Oct. 23,
1967.)
The inner circle of Lyndon
Johnson's advisors has a dis
tinguished new addition.
His appointment, however,
has been guarded in the strictest
secrecy, so strict that even the
President's other advisors don't
know of his existence.
In a most unusual break with
historical precedent, the Presi
dent visits this advisor away
from the White House. In an
even greater break with tradi
tion and security, Johnson is
accompanied by his wife and
daughter Lynda when he goes
for consultation.
But the most extraordinary

aspect of the President's rela
tionship with this advisor is that
the advisor does all the talking
while Johnson remains silently
seated.
During the anti-war demon
strations this past Sunday at the
Pentagon, the President paid a
visit to his new advisor seeking
guidance about his Vietnam
policy and the potential power
of the demonstrators.
Yesterday's New York Times
reported his visit. "President
Johnson left the White House
briefly by limousine today (Sun
day) to drive half a mile to the
National City Christian Church.
He was accompanied by his wife
and daughter Lynda. The
church and streets in all direc
tions for several blocks were
guarded heavily by uniformed
police."
Once in the church, the Presi
dent took his customary seat,
followed by the entrance of the
advisor. Within minutes, the
President was carefully absorb
ing the momentous advice given
by George R. Davis, pastor of
the Church.
A large smile passed over the
President's face as Dr. Davis
assured him that the demonstra
tion was "anything but responsi
ble."
As he continued it became em
barrassingly clear that Dr.
Davis, like Dean Rusk, was
making sure he said exactly

what he thought Johnson
wanted to hear. He stated:
"There are those in this na
tion who do not deserve to be
free, but they have the right
to be free and play fast and
loose with that freedom."
Dr. Davis concluded, "What
do they know, these bearded
oafs who listen to the strum
ming of lugubrious guitars? To
be loved is not the end of great
ness."
A swift but sure "Amen"
could be heard emanating from
the direction of the President.
Greatly relieved that God was
on his side, the President quiet
ly returned to the White House,
immediately calling Robert Mc-
Namara to say that he needn't
worry about those "bearded
oafs" outside his window.
He added, "And don't you be
minding them gitars, Bob."
So the new advisor steps back
into the wings awaiting his next
consultation this coming Sunday
morning. His presence, how
ever, greatly disturbs some ob
servers in Washington.
Word has it, in fact, that
Cardinal Spellman may be the
next Secretary of State.
