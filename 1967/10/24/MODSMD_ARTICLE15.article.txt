## Peace Corps Serves Host Nations 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In his article questioning the
validity of the Peace Corps in
the Vietnam era, (Friday, Octo
ber 20) Robin Knight points out
that "a contradiction exists be
tween ... American imperialism,
and the practice of American
youth serving in the Peace
Corps. If the two are to function
side by side, those who volun
teer for the Peace Corps will
need consciences like rubber
bands..."
Mr. Knight overlooks several
important considerations that
face the individual who contem
plates Peace Corps service.
The Peace Corps Volunteer
does not regard himself as a
representative of the American
government or an embodiment
of United States foreign policy.
Rather the Volunteer finds him
self working at the invitation
of the local government, in an
often isolated area, and having
little or nothing to do with other
Americans in the country, much
less with Peace Corps or other
government officials in Washing
ton.
For the Volunteer 10,000 miles
from Washington, the ideals of
the Peace Corps are often
deeply internalized and re-inter
preted in light of his own unique
situation.
Many Peace Corps Volunteers
see the U.S. government as
merely providing them with
training and a plane ticket.
Their main concern is partici
pation in a program that is re
warding on an individual-to-in
dividual basis—not government
to-government.
Mr. Knight also questions
whether the Peace Corps has
been left behind by events. That
it has been upstaged and over
shadowed by grim events in
Southeast Asia few would dis
agree. But Vietnam should not
so preoccupy the American
mind that the problems of other
developing countries are ig
nored.
The idea that the idea and
Ideals of the Peace Corps are
passe is a point that many
young Americans would dispute.
The Peace Corps Volunteer en
deavors to accomplish some
thing far beyond party and ad
ministration politics, and hope
fully far beyond Vietnam.
The Volunteer, therefore,
might strongly disagree that "re
sistance to the draft can be
logically extended to include re
sistance to all forms of govern
mental activity." One value of
the Peace Corps is that it con
tinues to work on, sending Vol
unteers all over the world to
give the lie to the claim that
what is happening in Vietnam
reflects the will of the entire
American people.
Crucial to understanding the
role of the Volunteer in a host
nation is the fact that he has
been invited by that government
to do a job. It is at this govern
ment's request that the Peace
Corps recruits, trains, trans
ports and supports the Volun
teer. The projects selected may
or may not reflect the official
policy of the United States.
What is important is that the
projects are chosen bp the coun
try itself.
The present course of the
American government in Viet
nam wrings anguished outcries
from this college generation.
The student who graduates in
1968 and joins the Peace Corps
need not have a rubber soul; he
need not fear that he is leaving
a giant's burden of problems on
his own doorstep to take up
lesser problems elsewhere. But
he must carry in his luggage
with him the realization that
there are scores of countries
not much larger than Vietnam
that face the future handicapped
in every way.
It is the active participation
in the goals of his country that
the Volunteer finds to be his

primary task and most reward
ing experience.

• Paper Status
Editor, The Dally:
Yesterday's Dally carried an
article by Bruce Campbell,
"Come Down From Your Ivory
Tower," which was identified as
"one of his reports for the SES."
Since Bruce did work for the
Study staff last summer, there
appears to be some confusion
about the status of this paper
which I should like to clarify.
It was written not as a staff
document, but as his personal
statement, and only after he re
turned to Toronto to continue
his graduate studies.
SES staff papers are working
papers addressed to the Steer
ing Committee or to one of the
topic committees. They will not
be released for publication un
less they are incorporated into
a formal recommendation or
statement of the Steering Com
mittee. To do otherwise would
either sow confusion as to the
Study's work or inhibit the writ
ing of internal staff documents.
The Study welcomes state
ments and proposals of all kinds
from individuals, and of course
these individuals are free to sub
mit them for publication where
ever they please. Bruce's pro
vocative paper falls in this latter
category since it was written
after he completed his very able
service to SES over the summer.

• Greek Lesson
Editor, The Dally:
In response to Cadet James
Bower's letter to the Daily
(Monday, October 23) let me
point out a rather critical lack
of reasoning in his defense of
American policy in Vietnam.
Mr. Bower's proposition is
that the continuation of the war
in Vietnam is necessary for the
preservation of the right of dis
sent and the maintenance of
basic American freedoms in the
United States. This is a state
ment which Mr. Bower offers
up as dogma. He does not at
tempt to prove this proposition,
presenting no reasoning to sup
port his view.
The second part of his thesis
is that the use of war is "the
only way that the citizens of the
United States can preserve their
freedom until man learns to live
in peace." This belief is consis
tent with the ideas of the "lim
ited war" theoreticians of the
late 1950's—Osgood, Kissinger,
Morgenthau—and as such repre
sents official American policy
planning today.
Unfortunately, these two prop
ositions are in contradiction
within the context of the Viet
nam war.
The goals of the National Lib
eration Front and the Govern-'
ment of Ho Chi Minh do not
necessarily represent an attack
on the vital interests of the
United States. American free
dom, including the right of dis
sent, the right of assembly, and
the free press, will not be men
aced twenty years from now by
enabling all of the people of
South Vietnam to have some
measure of self-determination
and to state for themselves
whether or not they eventually
wish to join North Vietnam in
a united country, as suggested
by the Geneva accords of 1954.
The events of last week have
shown that the contrary of Mr.
Bower's predictions will come
true.
If the war in Vietnam contin
ues for ten or twenty years, be

cause it is necessary for the
armed forces of the United
States to maintain a garrison of
500,000 men or more in South
Vietnam to back up the current
unrepresentative regime, the
pressures exerted on this coun
try will be great. Dissent will
continue to bring, in response,
the cry "Traitor!" And perhaps
we will be treated to a renewal
of the McCarthy period.
I would suggest that Mr. Bow
er read Chapter 5 of Book 3
from Thucydides, The Pelopon
nesian War, to see what may
happen to a democracy in time
of protracted war.

• Matter Of Principle
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to write in to commend
the Stanford English Depart
ment for taking an action which
I believe deserves more mention
than it has received in the pop
ular press (sic.). I refer, of
course, to the English Depart
ment's recent en masse act of
conscience in refusing to aid and
abet the fraternity system by
teaching seminars in houses
which discriminatorily select
their members (which would
then represent a full 50 per cent
of the seminar membership).
This action represents an aca
demic milestone on two fronts.
First, insofar as fraternities
can generally be considered "un
enlightened," it is a recognition
of the fact that unenlightened
individuals don't deserve en
lightenment.
The English Department, it
must be realized, cannot be ex
pected to act as a missionary of
the Good Life to those too back

ward to appreciate it. Knowl
edge should be dispensed only
to those who are smart enough
to deserve it. Socially backward
groups (those who don't agree
with us) don't objectively merit
improvement.
This worthy principle deserves
a logical expansion. Stanford, it
may be pointed out (by those
who are skeptical of our fine
goal), admits its student body
discriminatorily on the basis of
grades, pictures, ability to pay,
general desirability, and other
factors.
The Stanford English Depart
ment should not teach (English,
at least; I imagine a course in
Value Judgements would be per
missable) to an institution
founded on discriminatory ad
mittance. It would seem that the
student body does not deserve
the English Department; I con
cur.

• Jail Fee
Editor, The Dally:
I am sending the following
letter to President Sterling.
I have it upon good authority
that salaries are being paid to
several faculty members while
they are serving jail sentences
for recent illegal activities at
the Oakland Induction Center.
A rough calculation shows that
the salaries these people will re
ceive during their ten day sen
tences will amount to approxi
mately the cost of Stanford's
tuition for one year. I strenu
ously object to the use of the
tuition I must pay for my son's
education for such a purpose.
