# Administrator's Tragedy
## Seeking A Cure For Depersonalization 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL

was written by Bruce Campbell,
1966 graduate of Stanford, af

Study of Education at Stanford.
The paper is one of many that
have been submitted to the SES
by faculty, staff, students, and
graduates.)

"What is it about administra
tion," said the Dean, "that seems
to turn good men into horse's
asses?"
His frank statement pointed
to a problem facing Stanford's
and every other administration:
how to combat the almost dem
onically strong forces of dehu
manization present in the act
of administrating.
These forces give rise to a
two-fold tragedy, both admini
strative and personal. On the
one hand, administration carries
within it forces that tend to un
dermine administration itself;
but further, many of those who
administrate succumb on a per
sonal level as well to the strong
forces of dehumanization.
This article will discuss both
of these tragedies, looking at
their causes, remedies, and
larger implications.
Signs of Undermining
There are at least three major
signs that administration is un
dermining itself. The first is an
administrator's refusal to deal
with any but the most imme
diate problems. Questions which
involve reflection and long-range
planning are avoided.
This sign is perhaps the most
irksome to students, and much
of their discussion of education
in the years before the SES was
predicated on the position that
they were filling a University
lacuna to speak of goals of edu
cation, the relation of the Uni
versity to society, and related
questions. Their criticism seems
to have been tacitly accepted,
however, as a new administra
tive post for long-range planning
was created last year.
The second, and related, sign
is a loss of context. A focusing
of attention on problems requir
ing immediate decisions even
tually leads to making poor deci
sions even on immediate prob
lems. This is because any given
decision can only be made with
reference to a context larger
than itself.
Thus when all a person's time
is spent in making immediate
decisions, he loses the opportu
nity to reflect on the overall per
spective of what he is doing. And
this sacrifice will lead eventually
to the making of context-less de
cisions.
Role Conflict
The third sign of administra
tive problems is the role conflict.
An administrative officer is at
one and the same time respon
sible to academic bodies in the
faculty and to the hierarchic,
bureaucratic structure of the
administration.
On any given issue, where

does his highest loyalty fall? If
it is with the administration, he
loses his credibility with the
faculty and becomes "the ad
ministration's man." But if he
sides with the faculty, he is en
dangering his position in the
administrative hierarchy and
there can be no doubt that he
has grave responsibilities there.
How does a man integrate these
two roles? Maybe it cannot be
done.
There are several factors of
administration which may be
pointed to as causes of the prob
lems discussed above.
Harried Administrators
The most central of these
seems to be the time demands
made on administrators at Stan
ford. The schedule they keep is
so hectic that one feels that, at
any given time, the average ad
ministrator is approximately
thirteen minutes late to his last
appointment.
The kind of frazzled admini
strative life lead here does not
permit either deliberate treat
ment of long-range problems or
reflecting on perspectives larger
than the immediately present
one.
One can find several reasons
for the existence of this situa
tion. For one thing, Stanford
operates with a small admini
strative staff in comparison with
other major universities, and
thus must spend proportionally
more of its total administrative
time in day-to-day decisions.
Besides the pressures exerted
by a too-high ratio between daily
problems and staff, there are
other structural factors such as
the monthly Board of Trustees
meeting which requires a week
or more of work out of every
four.
'Administrative Mystique'
But more insidious than the
above two reasons is the admini
strative mystique that, in the
words of one administrator,
causes some men to "revel in
having two people on the phone
at once." Being chaotically busy
is something held up as a stan
dard to be emulated, at least
among some members of the
administration.
Other than the time demands
made on administrators, the
problems of role are the most
important causes of administra
tive self-undermining.
Role conflict, in which men get
pulled two directions, is one as
pect of the problem, but px*ob
ably not the most important. As
more central, one would cite the
fact that the administrator is
part of a hierarchical bureau
cracy in which "expediency" is
the key word.
Identifying With Role
A further role problem, and
one related to time demands, is
that an administrator has to
make so many appearances —
at committee meetings, at social
gatherings, etc. — in his role,
that he can easily come to iden
tify with it. This relates more
centrally to the personal tragedy
to be discussed below, but it has

its strictly administrative as
pects as well.
A person who is always in
one box never gets outside that
box to put the box in perspec
tive. In other words, just as the
time demands prevent the ad
ministrator from stepping back
to get perspective, so do the role
demands inhibit his attempts to
step outside his function to put
it in perspective.
There are several solutions
which have been proposed to
solve the problems of admini
stration outlined above. Sabba
ticals have been encouraged both
as an opportunity for reflection
and perspective-gaining and as
a way to say to a man "you're
not indispensable, we did with
out you for a year."
Rotate Posts
Rotation of administrative
posts, so that no man serves
for more than, say, three years,
has also received attention.
There are problems with this
suggestion however, because, in
the words of one administrator,
"many members of the faculty
wouldn't serve in the admini
stration for one year." Perhaps
the inevitability of a profes
sional, permanent administration
must be accepted.
One way to circumvent at
least some of the problems
caused by a professional ad
ministration would be to clear
ly differentiate policy decisions
from practice and to have policy
decisions made by university
wide committees. This is diffi
cult to work in practice, because
professional administrations
tend to win many battles by
the default of the committee in
volved.
'Knowledge Is Power*
"Knowledge is power" and no
where is this truer than in com
mittee-administration relations.
It often seems that policy deci
sions depend on a thorough
knowledge of daily practice and
this, of course, only the admini
strator has.
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
above and a tragedy with much
wider implications is the per
sonal tragedy of the human price
that men pay in order to be ad
ministrators. The same forces
that operate to cause admini
strative problems are the forces
of dehumanization that quietly
and largely without notice eat
away at a man's humanness.
The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty
in seeing a larger perspective,
they also facilitate dealing with
people in an "administrative"
manner.
Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him
self. Manipulation of others, even

to do the very necessary tasks
of the university, leads to instru
mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit
able, force of administration.
The combination of time de
mands and role filling that faci
litates an administrator's iden
tifying with his administrative
function and thus makes it diffi
cult for him to get outside to
see himself in perspective is also
the cause of personal tragedy:
a man spends so much of his
time, even his non-office time,
as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.
Conflict Developing
The pervasiveness of this out
look was demonstrated to me in
conversations I had with mem
bers of the administration about
the problems discussed in this
article.
All of them agreed about the
administrative tragedy, but no
one perceived or agreed that
there was any personal price
paid in administrating.
The implications of this are
great. A conflict which may be
one of the central issues in
America in the next few decades
is developing in embryonic form
here at Stanford. It is the diver
gence between a generation
which, on the whole, thinks in
functional terms and is very
leary of asking personal ques
tions and a generation which
focuses primarily on asking
questions about qualities of be
ing human, sometimes to the
extent of refusing to confront
pragmatic considerations.
'How To' vs. 'Who'
This divergence pervades all
the issues of student-administra
tion conflict here, because it is
at base a matter of what people
consider to be the most funda
mental human concern.
The nature of this divergence
was illumined by Michael Novak
in his class day talk to seniors
and their parents last June (re
cently published in the Daily).
"For the older generation,
whether conservative or liberal,
the key words which unlock the
meaning of human life are How
To: how to make money, how
to win friends and influence peo
ple, how to win at bridge, how
to master the secrets of nature,
how to predict and to control,
how to make a contribution to
society, how to live a productive
life."
"The assumption behind the
'How To' is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing our products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively
and flexibily programmed to ad
vance the aims of society. A suc
cessful human being is one who
knows How To."
Human Qualities
For many young people, how
ever, the question How To is

secondary. Their primary atten
tion is given not to the instru
ments of change but to the
qualities of being human. "How
To is an important, even indis
pensible, question for students
to master. But many students
are now going on to ask a furth
er and also indispensable ques
tion. Their primary question is
not How To, but Who. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?"
"... The question How To
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion Who makes man a self and
the world a thou: it opens man
to beauty, to wonder, and to joy.
. . . These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not separate
from us, a dumb, hard environ
ment, as if we were (in Alan
Watts' phrase) 'an ego in a
bag of skin' surrounded by for
eign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth buds forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calves,
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious."
Who Sees Truer?
What is at issue here is a
fundamentally different percep
tion of the world. And the ans
wer to the question who, young
or old, is seeing truer will go
a long way toward determining
how this conflict may be re
solved at Stanford, which would
in turn provide a model to sol
ving this conflict more general
ly-
Students are claiming that
they are seeing things that their
elders have not seen and that

this new perspective changes
one's priorities fundamentally.
When students make this
claim, however, they are buck
ing a strong social current in
America which correlates wis
dom with age. An older person
has necessarily experienced
more and thus his perception of
the world includes that of young
er people, but goes beyond it.
Students challenge this and say
that they have indeed experi
enced things that older people
have not.

There are problems with this
suggestion however, because, in
the words of one administrator,
"many members of the faculty
wouldn't serve in the admini
stration for one year." Perhaps
the inevitability of a profes
sional, permanent administration
must be accepted.
One way to circumvent at
least some of the problems
caused by a professional ad
ministration would be to clear
ly differentiate policy decisions
from practice and to have policy
decisions made by university
wide committees. This is diffi
cult to work in practice, because
professional administrations
tend to win many battles by
the default of the committee in
volved.
'Knowledge Is Power*
"Knowledge is power" and no
where is this truer than in com
mittee-administration relations.
It often seems that policy deci
sions depend on a thorough
knowledge of daily practice and
this, of course, only the admini
strator has.
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
above and a tragedy with much
wider implications is the per
sonal tragedy of the human price
that men pay in order to be ad
ministrators. The same forces
that operate to cause admini
strative problems are the forces
of dehumanization that quietly
and largely without notice eat
away at a man's humanness.
The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty
in seeing a larger perspective,
they also facilitate dealing with
people in an "administrative"
manner.
Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him
self. Manipulation of others, even

to do the very necessary tasks
of the university, leads to instru
mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit
able, force of administration.
The combination of time de
mands and role filling that faci
litates an administrator's iden
tifying with his administrative
function and thus makes it diffi
cult for him to get outside to
see himself in perspective is also
the cause of personal tragedy:
a man spends so much of his
time, even his non-office time,
as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.
Conflict Developing
The pervasiveness of this out
look was demonstrated to me in
conversations I had with mem
bers of the administration about
the problems discussed in this
article.
All of them agreed about the
administrative tragedy, but no
one perceived or agreed that
there was any personal price
paid in administrating.
The implications of this are
great. A conflict which may be
one of the central issues in
America in the next few decades
is developing in embryonic form
here at Stanford. It is the diver
gence between a generation
which, on the whole, thinks in
functional terms and is very
leary of asking personal ques
tions and a generation which
focuses primarily on asking
questions about qualities of be
ing human, sometimes to the
extent of refusing to confront
pragmatic considerations.
'How To' vs. 'Who'
This divergence pervades all
the issues of student-administra
tion conflict here, because it is
at base a matter of what people
consider to be the most funda
mental human concern.
The nature of this divergence
was illumined by Michael Novak
in his class day talk to seniors
and their parents last June (re
cently published in the Daily).
"For the older generation,
whether conservative or liberal,
the key words which unlock the
meaning of human life are How
To: how to make money, how
to win friends and influence peo
ple, how to win at bridge, how
to master the secrets of nature,
how to predict and to control,
how to make a contribution to
society, how to live a productive
life."
"The assumption behind the
'How To' is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing our products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively
and flexibily programmed to ad
vance the aims of society. A suc
cessful human being is one who
knows How To."
Human Qualities
For many young people, how
ever, the question How To is

secondary. Their primary atten
tion is given not to the instru
ments of change but to the
qualities of being human. "How
To is an important, even indis
pensible, question for students
to master. But many students
are now going on to ask a furth
er and also indispensable ques
tion. Their primary question is
not How To, but Who. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?"
"... The question How To
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion Who makes man a self and
the world a thou: it opens man
to beauty, to wonder, and to joy.
. . . These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not separate
from us, a dumb, hard environ
ment, as if we were (in Alan
Watts' phrase) 'an ego in a
bag of skin' surrounded by for
eign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth buds forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calves,
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious."
Who Sees Truer?
What is at issue here is a
fundamentally different percep
tion of the world. And the ans
wer to the question who, young
or old, is seeing truer will go
a long way toward determining
how this conflict may be re
solved at Stanford, which would
in turn provide a model to sol
ving this conflict more general
ly-
Students are claiming that
they are seeing things that their
elders have not seen and that

this new perspective changes
one's priorities fundamentally.
When students make this
claim, however, they are buck
ing a strong social current in
America which correlates wis
dom with age. An older person
has necessarily experienced
more and thus his perception of
the world includes that of young
er people, but goes beyond it.
Students challenge this and say
that they have indeed experi
enced things that older people
have not.
(Editor's Note: This paper
was written by Bruce Campbell,
1966 graduate of Stanford, af
ter working this summer for the
Study of Education at Stanford.
The paper is one of many that
have been submitted to the SES
by faculty, staff, students, and
graduates.)

"What is it about administra
tion," said the Dean, "that seems
to turn good men into horse's
asses?"
His frank statement pointed
to a problem facing Stanford's
and every other administration:
how to combat the almost dem
onically strong forces of dehu
manization present in the act
of administrating.
These forces give rise to a
two-fold tragedy, both admini
strative and personal. On the
one hand, administration carries
within it forces that tend to un
dermine administration itself;
but further, many of those who
administrate succumb on a per
sonal level as well to the strong
forces of dehumanization.
This article will discuss both
of these tragedies, looking at
their causes, remedies, and
larger implications.
Signs of Undermining
There are at least three major
signs that administration is un
dermining itself. The first is an
administrator's refusal to deal
with any but the most imme
diate problems. Questions which
involve reflection and long-range
planning are avoided.
This sign is perhaps the most
irksome to students, and much
of their discussion of education
in the years before the SES was
predicated on the position that
they were filling a University
lacuna to speak of goals of edu
cation, the relation of the Uni
versity to society, and related
questions. Their criticism seems
to have been tacitly accepted,
however, as a new administra
tive post for long-range planning
was created last year.
The second, and related, sign
is a loss of context. A focusing
of attention on problems requir
ing immediate decisions even
tually leads to making poor deci
sions even on immediate prob
lems. This is because any given
decision can only be made with
reference to a context larger
than itself.
Thus when all a person's time
is spent in making immediate
decisions, he loses the opportu
nity to reflect on the overall per
spective of what he is doing. And
this sacrifice will lead eventually
to the making of context-less de
cisions.
Role Conflict
The third sign of administra
tive problems is the role conflict.
An administrative officer is at
one and the same time respon
sible to academic bodies in the
faculty and to the hierarchic,
bureaucratic structure of the
administration.
On any given issue, where

does his highest loyalty fall? If
it is with the administration, he
loses his credibility with the
faculty and becomes "the ad
ministration's man." But if he
sides with the faculty, he is en
dangering his position in the
administrative hierarchy and
there can be no doubt that he
has grave responsibilities there.
How does a man integrate these
two roles? Maybe it cannot be
done.
There are several factors of
administration which may be
pointed to as causes of the prob
lems discussed above.
Harried Administrators
The most central of these
seems to be the time demands
made on administrators at Stan
ford. The schedule they keep is
so hectic that one feels that, at
any given time, the average ad
ministrator is approximately
thirteen minutes late to his last
appointment.
The kind of frazzled admini
strative life lead here does not
permit either deliberate treat
ment of long-range problems or
reflecting on perspectives larger
than the immediately present
one.
One can find several reasons
for the existence of this situa
tion. For one thing, Stanford
operates with a small admini
strative staff in comparison with
other major universities, and
thus must spend proportionally
more of its total administrative
time in day-to-day decisions.
Besides the pressures exerted
by a too-high ratio between daily
problems and staff, there are
other structural factors such as
the monthly Board of Trustees
meeting which requires a week
or more of work out of every
four.
'Administrative Mystique'
But more insidious than the
above two reasons is the admini
strative mystique that, in the
words of one administrator,
causes some men to "revel in
having two people on the phone
at once." Being chaotically busy
is something held up as a stan
dard to be emulated, at least
among some members of the
administration.
Other than the time demands
made on administrators, the
problems of role are the most
important causes of administra
tive self-undermining.
Role conflict, in which men get
pulled two directions, is one as
pect of the problem, but px*ob
ably not the most important. As
more central, one would cite the
fact that the administrator is
part of a hierarchical bureau
cracy in which "expediency" is
the key word.
Identifying With Role
A further role problem, and
one related to time demands, is
that an administrator has to
make so many appearances —
at committee meetings, at social
gatherings, etc. — in his role,
that he can easily come to iden
tify with it. This relates more
centrally to the personal tragedy
to be discussed below, but it has

its strictly administrative as
pects as well.
A person who is always in
one box never gets outside that
box to put the box in perspec
tive. In other words, just as the
time demands prevent the ad
ministrator from stepping back
to get perspective, so do the role
demands inhibit his attempts to
step outside his function to put
it in perspective.
There are several solutions
which have been proposed to
solve the problems of admini
stration outlined above. Sabba
ticals have been encouraged both
as an opportunity for reflection
and perspective-gaining and as
a way to say to a man "you're
not indispensable, we did with
out you for a year."
Rotate Posts
Rotation of administrative
posts, so that no man serves
for more than, say, three years,
has also received attention.
There are problems with this
suggestion however, because, in
the words of one administrator,
"many members of the faculty
wouldn't serve in the admini
stration for one year." Perhaps
the inevitability of a profes
sional, permanent administration
must be accepted.
One way to circumvent at
least some of the problems
caused by a professional ad
ministration would be to clear
ly differentiate policy decisions
from practice and to have policy
decisions made by university
wide committees. This is diffi
cult to work in practice, because
professional administrations
tend to win many battles by
the default of the committee in
volved.
'Knowledge Is Power*
"Knowledge is power" and no
where is this truer than in com
mittee-administration relations.
It often seems that policy deci
sions depend on a thorough
knowledge of daily practice and
this, of course, only the admini
strator has.
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
above and a tragedy with much
wider implications is the per
sonal tragedy of the human price
that men pay in order to be ad
ministrators. The same forces
that operate to cause admini
strative problems are the forces
of dehumanization that quietly
and largely without notice eat
away at a man's humanness.
The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty
in seeing a larger perspective,
they also facilitate dealing with
people in an "administrative"
manner.
Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him
self. Manipulation of others, even

to do the very necessary tasks
of the university, leads to instru
mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit
able, force of administration.
The combination of time de
mands and role filling that faci
litates an administrator's iden
tifying with his administrative
function and thus makes it diffi
cult for him to get outside to
see himself in perspective is also
the cause of personal tragedy:
a man spends so much of his
time, even his non-office time,
as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.

they are seeing things that their
elders have not seen and that

this new perspective changes
one's priorities fundamentally.
When students make this
claim, however, they are buck
ing a strong social current in
America which correlates wis
dom with age. An older person
has necessarily experienced
more and thus his perception of
the world includes that of young
er people, but goes beyond it.
Students challenge this and say
that they have indeed experi
enced things that older people
have not.

"What is it about administra
tion," said the Dean, "that seems
to turn good men into horse's
asses?"
His frank statement pointed
to a problem facing Stanford's
and every other administration:
how to combat the almost dem
onically strong forces of dehu
manization present in the act
of administrating.
These forces give rise to a
two-fold tragedy, both admini
strative and personal. On the
one hand, administration carries
within it forces that tend to un
dermine administration itself;
but further, many of those who
administrate succumb on a per
sonal level as well to the strong
forces of dehumanization.
This article will discuss both
of these tragedies, looking at
their causes, remedies, and
larger implications.
Signs of Undermining
There are at least three major
signs that administration is un
dermining itself. The first is an
administrator's refusal to deal
with any but the most imme
diate problems. Questions which
involve reflection and long-range
planning are avoided.
This sign is perhaps the most
irksome to students, and much
of their discussion of education
in the years before the SES was
predicated on the position that
they were filling a University
lacuna to speak of goals of edu
cation, the relation of the Uni
versity to society, and related
questions. Their criticism seems
to have been tacitly accepted,
however, as a new administra
tive post for long-range planning
was created last year.
The second, and related, sign
is a loss of context. A focusing
of attention on problems requir
ing immediate decisions even
tually leads to making poor deci
sions even on immediate prob
lems. This is because any given
decision can only be made with
reference to a context larger
than itself.
Thus when all a person's time
is spent in making immediate
decisions, he loses the opportu
nity to reflect on the overall per
spective of what he is doing. And
this sacrifice will lead eventually
to the making of context-less de
cisions.
Role Conflict
The third sign of administra
tive problems is the role conflict.
An administrative officer is at
one and the same time respon
sible to academic bodies in the
faculty and to the hierarchic,
bureaucratic structure of the
administration.
On any given issue, where

does his highest loyalty fall? If
it is with the administration, he
loses his credibility with the
faculty and becomes "the ad
ministration's man." But if he
sides with the faculty, he is en
dangering his position in the
administrative hierarchy and
there can be no doubt that he
has grave responsibilities there.
How does a man integrate these
two roles? Maybe it cannot be
done.
There are several factors of
administration which may be
pointed to as causes of the prob
lems discussed above.
Harried Administrators
The most central of these
seems to be the time demands
made on administrators at Stan
ford. The schedule they keep is
so hectic that one feels that, at
any given time, the average ad
ministrator is approximately
thirteen minutes late to his last
appointment.
The kind of frazzled admini
strative life lead here does not
permit either deliberate treat
ment of long-range problems or
reflecting on perspectives larger
than the immediately present
one.
One can find several reasons
for the existence of this situa
tion. For one thing, Stanford
operates with a small admini
strative staff in comparison with
other major universities, and
thus must spend proportionally
more of its total administrative
time in day-to-day decisions.
Besides the pressures exerted
by a too-high ratio between daily
problems and staff, there are
other structural factors such as
the monthly Board of Trustees
meeting which requires a week
or more of work out of every
four.
'Administrative Mystique'
But more insidious than the
above two reasons is the admini
strative mystique that, in the
words of one administrator,
causes some men to "revel in
having two people on the phone
at once." Being chaotically busy
is something held up as a stan
dard to be emulated, at least
among some members of the
administration.
Other than the time demands
made on administrators, the
problems of role are the most
important causes of administra
tive self-undermining.
Role conflict, in which men get
pulled two directions, is one as
pect of the problem, but px*ob
ably not the most important. As
more central, one would cite the
fact that the administrator is
part of a hierarchical bureau
cracy in which "expediency" is
the key word.
Identifying With Role
A further role problem, and
one related to time demands, is
that an administrator has to
make so many appearances —
at committee meetings, at social
gatherings, etc. — in his role,
that he can easily come to iden
tify with it. This relates more
centrally to the personal tragedy
to be discussed below, but it has

its strictly administrative as
pects as well.
A person who is always in
one box never gets outside that
box to put the box in perspec
tive. In other words, just as the
time demands prevent the ad
ministrator from stepping back
to get perspective, so do the role
demands inhibit his attempts to
step outside his function to put
it in perspective.
There are several solutions
which have been proposed to
solve the problems of admini
stration outlined above. Sabba
ticals have been encouraged both
as an opportunity for reflection
and perspective-gaining and as
a way to say to a man "you're
not indispensable, we did with
out you for a year."
Rotate Posts
Rotation of administrative
posts, so that no man serves
for more than, say, three years,
has also received attention.
There are problems with this
suggestion however, because, in
the words of one administrator,
"many members of the faculty
wouldn't serve in the admini
stration for one year." Perhaps
the inevitability of a profes
sional, permanent administration
must be accepted.
One way to circumvent at
least some of the problems
caused by a professional ad
ministration would be to clear
ly differentiate policy decisions
from practice and to have policy
decisions made by university
wide committees. This is diffi
cult to work in practice, because
professional administrations
tend to win many battles by
the default of the committee in
volved.
'Knowledge Is Power*
"Knowledge is power" and no
where is this truer than in com
mittee-administration relations.
It often seems that policy deci
sions depend on a thorough
knowledge of daily practice and
this, of course, only the admini
strator has.
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
above and a tragedy with much
wider implications is the per
sonal tragedy of the human price
that men pay in order to be ad
ministrators. The same forces
that operate to cause admini
strative problems are the forces
of dehumanization that quietly
and largely without notice eat
away at a man's humanness.
The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty
in seeing a larger perspective,
they also facilitate dealing with
people in an "administrative"
manner.
Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him
self. Manipulation of others, even

to do the very necessary tasks
of the university, leads to instru
mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit
able, force of administration.
The combination of time de
mands and role filling that faci
litates an administrator's iden
tifying with his administrative
function and thus makes it diffi
cult for him to get outside to
see himself in perspective is also
the cause of personal tragedy:
a man spends so much of his
time, even his non-office time,
as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.
Conflict Developing
The pervasiveness of this out
look was demonstrated to me in
conversations I had with mem
bers of the administration about
the problems discussed in this
article.
All of them agreed about the
administrative tragedy, but no
one perceived or agreed that
there was any personal price
paid in administrating.
The implications of this are
great. A conflict which may be
one of the central issues in
America in the next few decades
is developing in embryonic form
here at Stanford. It is the diver
gence between a generation
which, on the whole, thinks in
functional terms and is very
leary of asking personal ques
tions and a generation which
focuses primarily on asking
questions about qualities of be
ing human, sometimes to the
extent of refusing to confront
pragmatic considerations.
'How To' vs. 'Who'
This divergence pervades all
the issues of student-administra
tion conflict here, because it is
at base a matter of what people
consider to be the most funda
mental human concern.
The nature of this divergence
was illumined by Michael Novak
in his class day talk to seniors
and their parents last June (re
cently published in the Daily).
"For the older generation,
whether conservative or liberal,
the key words which unlock the
meaning of human life are How
To: how to make money, how
to win friends and influence peo
ple, how to win at bridge, how
to master the secrets of nature,
how to predict and to control,
how to make a contribution to
society, how to live a productive
life."
"The assumption behind the
'How To' is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing our products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively
and flexibily programmed to ad
vance the aims of society. A suc
cessful human being is one who
knows How To."
Human Qualities
For many young people, how
ever, the question How To is

secondary. Their primary atten
tion is given not to the instru
ments of change but to the
qualities of being human. "How
To is an important, even indis
pensible, question for students
to master. But many students
are now going on to ask a furth
er and also indispensable ques
tion. Their primary question is
not How To, but Who. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?"
"... The question How To
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion Who makes man a self and
the world a thou: it opens man
to beauty, to wonder, and to joy.
. . . These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not separate
from us, a dumb, hard environ
ment, as if we were (in Alan
Watts' phrase) 'an ego in a
bag of skin' surrounded by for
eign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth buds forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calves,
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious."
Who Sees Truer?
What is at issue here is a
fundamentally different percep
tion of the world. And the ans
wer to the question who, young
or old, is seeing truer will go
a long way toward determining
how this conflict may be re
solved at Stanford, which would
in turn provide a model to sol
ving this conflict more general
ly-
Students are claiming that
they are seeing things that their
elders have not seen and that

this new perspective changes
one's priorities fundamentally.
When students make this
claim, however, they are buck
ing a strong social current in
America which correlates wis

which have been proposed to
solve the problems of admini
stration outlined above. Sabba
ticals have been encouraged both
as an opportunity for reflection
and perspective-gaining and as
a way to say to a man "you're
not indispensable, we did with
out you for a year."
Rotate Posts
Rotation of administrative
posts, so that no man serves
for more than, say, three years,
has also received attention.
There are problems with this
suggestion however, because, in
the words of one administrator,
"many members of the faculty
wouldn't serve in the admini
stration for one year." Perhaps
the inevitability of a profes
sional, permanent administration
must be accepted.
One way to circumvent at
least some of the problems
caused by a professional ad
ministration would be to clear
ly differentiate policy decisions
from practice and to have policy
decisions made by university
wide committees. This is diffi
cult to work in practice, because
professional administrations
tend to win many battles by
the default of the committee in
volved.
'Knowledge Is Power*
"Knowledge is power" and no
where is this truer than in com
mittee-administration relations.
It often seems that policy deci
sions depend on a thorough
knowledge of daily practice and
this, of course, only the admini
strator has.
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
above and a tragedy with much
wider implications is the per
sonal tragedy of the human price
that men pay in order to be ad
ministrators. The same forces
that operate to cause admini
strative problems are the forces
of dehumanization that quietly
and largely without notice eat
away at a man's humanness.
The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty
in seeing a larger perspective,
they also facilitate dealing with
people in an "administrative"
manner.
Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him
self. Manipulation of others, even

to do the very necessary tasks
of the university, leads to instru
mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit
able, force of administration.
The combination of time de
mands and role filling that faci
litates an administrator's iden
tifying with his administrative
function and thus makes it diffi
cult for him to get outside to
see himself in perspective is also
the cause of personal tragedy:
a man spends so much of his
time, even his non-office time,
as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.
Conflict Developing
The pervasiveness of this out
look was demonstrated to me in
conversations I had with mem
bers of the administration about
the problems discussed in this
article.
All of them agreed about the
administrative tragedy, but no
one perceived or agreed that
there was any personal price
paid in administrating.
The implications of this are
great. A conflict which may be
one of the central issues in
America in the next few decades
is developing in embryonic form
here at Stanford. It is the diver
gence between a generation
which, on the whole, thinks in
functional terms and is very
leary of asking personal ques
tions and a generation which
focuses primarily on asking
questions about qualities of be
ing human, sometimes to the
extent of refusing to confront
pragmatic considerations.
'How To' vs. 'Who'
This divergence pervades all
the issues of student-administra
tion conflict here, because it is
at base a matter of what people
consider to be the most funda
mental human concern.
The nature of this divergence
was illumined by Michael Novak
in his class day talk to seniors
and their parents last June (re
cently published in the Daily).
"For the older generation,
whether conservative or liberal,
the key words which unlock the
meaning of human life are How
To: how to make money, how
to win friends and influence peo
ple, how to win at bridge, how
to master the secrets of nature,
how to predict and to control,
how to make a contribution to
society, how to live a productive
life."
"The assumption behind the
'How To' is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing our products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively
and flexibily programmed to ad
vance the aims of society. A suc
cessful human being is one who
knows How To."
Human Qualities
For many young people, how
ever, the question How To is

secondary. Their primary atten
tion is given not to the instru
ments of change but to the
qualities of being human. "How
To is an important, even indis
pensible, question for students
to master. But many students
are now going on to ask a furth
er and also indispensable ques
tion. Their primary question is
not How To, but Who. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?"
"... The question How To
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion Who makes man a self and
the world a thou: it opens man
to beauty, to wonder, and to joy.
. . . These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not separate
from us, a dumb, hard environ
ment, as if we were (in Alan
Watts' phrase) 'an ego in a
bag of skin' surrounded by for
eign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth buds forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calves,
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious."
Who Sees Truer?
What is at issue here is a
fundamentally different percep
tion of the world. And the ans
wer to the question who, young
or old, is seeing truer will go
a long way toward determining
how this conflict may be re
solved at Stanford, which would
in turn provide a model to sol
ving this conflict more general
ly-
Students are claiming that
they are seeing things that their
elders have not seen and that

this new perspective changes
one's priorities fundamentally.
When students make this
claim, however, they are buck
ing a strong social current in
America which correlates wis
dom with age. An older person
has necessarily experienced
more and thus his perception of
the world includes that of young
er people, but goes beyond it.
Students challenge this and say
that they have indeed experi
enced things that older people
have not.
(Editor's Note: This paper
was written by Bruce Campbell,
1966 graduate of Stanford, af
ter working this summer for the
Study of Education at Stanford.
The paper is one of many that
have been submitted to the SES
by faculty, staff, students, and
graduates.)

"What is it about administra
tion," said the Dean, "that seems
to turn good men into horse's
asses?"
His frank statement pointed
to a problem facing Stanford's
and every other administration:
how to combat the almost dem
onically strong forces of dehu
manization present in the act
of administrating.
These forces give rise to a
two-fold tragedy, both admini
strative and personal. On the
one hand, administration carries
within it forces that tend to un
dermine administration itself;
but further, many of those who
administrate succumb on a per
sonal level as well to the strong
forces of dehumanization.
This article will discuss both
of these tragedies, looking at
their causes, remedies, and
larger implications.
Signs of Undermining
There are at least three major
signs that administration is un
dermining itself. The first is an
administrator's refusal to deal
with any but the most imme
diate problems. Questions which
involve reflection and long-range
planning are avoided.
This sign is perhaps the most
irksome to students, and much
of their discussion of education
in the years before the SES was
predicated on the position that
they were filling a University
lacuna to speak of goals of edu
cation, the relation of the Uni
versity to society, and related
questions. Their criticism seems
to have been tacitly accepted,
however, as a new administra
tive post for long-range planning
was created last year.
The second, and related, sign
is a loss of context. A focusing
of attention on problems requir
ing immediate decisions even
tually leads to making poor deci
sions even on immediate prob
lems. This is because any given
decision can only be made with
reference to a context larger
than itself.
Thus when all a person's time
is spent in making immediate
decisions, he loses the opportu
nity to reflect on the overall per
spective of what he is doing. And
this sacrifice will lead eventually
to the making of context-less de
cisions.
Role Conflict
The third sign of administra
tive problems is the role conflict.
An administrative officer is at
one and the same time respon
sible to academic bodies in the
faculty and to the hierarchic,
bureaucratic structure of the
administration.
On any given issue, where

does his highest loyalty fall? If
it is with the administration, he
loses his credibility with the
faculty and becomes "the ad
ministration's man." But if he
sides with the faculty, he is en
dangering his position in the
administrative hierarchy and
there can be no doubt that he
has grave responsibilities there.
How does a man integrate these
two roles? Maybe it cannot be
done.
There are several factors of
administration which may be
pointed to as causes of the prob
lems discussed above.
Harried Administrators
The most central of these
seems to be the time demands
made on administrators at Stan
ford. The schedule they keep is
so hectic that one feels that, at
any given time, the average ad
ministrator is approximately
thirteen minutes late to his last
appointment.
The kind of frazzled admini
strative life lead here does not
permit either deliberate treat
ment of long-range problems or
reflecting on perspectives larger
than the immediately present
one.
One can find several reasons
for the existence of this situa
tion. For one thing, Stanford
operates with a small admini
strative staff in comparison with
other major universities, and
thus must spend proportionally
more of its total administrative
time in day-to-day decisions.
Besides the pressures exerted
by a too-high ratio between daily
problems and staff, there are
other structural factors such as
the monthly Board of Trustees
meeting which requires a week
or more of work out of every
four.
'Administrative Mystique'
But more insidious than the
above two reasons is the admini
strative mystique that, in the
words of one administrator,
causes some men to "revel in
having two people on the phone
at once." Being chaotically busy
is something held up as a stan
dard to be emulated, at least
among some members of the
administration.
Other than the time demands
made on administrators, the
problems of role are the most
important causes of administra
tive self-undermining.
Role conflict, in which men get
pulled two directions, is one as
pect of the problem, but px*ob
ably not the most important. As
more central, one would cite the
fact that the administrator is
part of a hierarchical bureau
cracy in which "expediency" is
the key word.
Identifying With Role
A further role problem, and
one related to time demands, is
that an administrator has to
make so many appearances —
at committee meetings, at social
gatherings, etc. — in his role,
that he can easily come to iden
tify with it. This relates more
centrally to the personal tragedy
to be discussed below, but it has

its strictly administrative as
pects as well.
A person who is always in
one box never gets outside that
box to put the box in perspec
tive. In other words, just as the
time demands prevent the ad
ministrator from stepping back
to get perspective, so do the role
demands inhibit his attempts to
step outside his function to put
it in perspective.
There are several solutions
which have been proposed to
solve the problems of admini
stration outlined above. Sabba
ticals have been encouraged both
as an opportunity for reflection
and perspective-gaining and as
a way to say to a man "you're
not indispensable, we did with
out you for a year."
Rotate Posts
Rotation of administrative
posts, so that no man serves
for more than, say, three years,
has also received attention.
There are problems with this
suggestion however, because, in
the words of one administrator,
"many members of the faculty
wouldn't serve in the admini
stration for one year." Perhaps
the inevitability of a profes
sional, permanent administration
must be accepted.
One way to circumvent at
least some of the problems
caused by a professional ad
ministration would be to clear
ly differentiate policy decisions
from practice and to have policy
decisions made by university
wide committees. This is diffi
cult to work in practice, because
professional administrations

the default of the committee in

'Knowledge Is Power*
"Knowledge is power" and no
where is this truer than in com
mittee-administration relations.
It often seems that policy deci
sions depend on a thorough
knowledge of daily practice and
this, of course, only the admini
strator has.
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
above and a tragedy with much
wider implications is the per
sonal tragedy of the human price
that men pay in order to be ad
ministrators. The same forces
that operate to cause admini
strative problems are the forces
of dehumanization that quietly

The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty

Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him

mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit

The combination of time de

the cause of personal tragedy:

in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.

Who Sees Truer?
What is at issue here is a
fundamentally different percep
tion of the world. And the ans
wer to the question who, young
or old, is seeing truer will go
a long way toward determining
how this conflict may be re
solved at Stanford, which would
in turn provide a model to sol
ving this conflict more general
ly-
Students are claiming that
they are seeing things that their
elders have not seen and that

this new perspective changes
one's priorities fundamentally.
When students make this
claim, however, they are buck
ing a strong social current in
America which correlates wis
dom with age. An older person
has necessarily experienced
more and thus his perception of
the world includes that of young
er people, but goes beyond it.
Students challenge this and say
that they have indeed experi
enced things that older people
have not.

"What is it about administra
tion," said the Dean, "that seems
to turn good men into horse's
asses?"
His frank statement pointed
to a problem facing Stanford's
and every other administration:
how to combat the almost dem
onically strong forces of dehu
manization present in the act
of administrating.
These forces give rise to a
two-fold tragedy, both admini
strative and personal. On the
one hand, administration carries
within it forces that tend to un
dermine administration itself;
but further, many of those who
administrate succumb on a per
sonal level as well to the strong
forces of dehumanization.
This article will discuss both
of these tragedies, looking at
their causes, remedies, and
larger implications.
Signs of Undermining
There are at least three major
signs that administration is un
dermining itself. The first is an
administrator's refusal to deal
with any but the most imme
diate problems. Questions which
involve reflection and long-range
planning are avoided.
This sign is perhaps the most
irksome to students, and much
of their discussion of education
in the years before the SES was
predicated on the position that
they were filling a University
lacuna to speak of goals of edu
cation, the relation of the Uni
versity to society, and related
questions. Their criticism seems
to have been tacitly accepted,
however, as a new administra
tive post for long-range planning
was created last year.
The second, and related, sign
is a loss of context. A focusing
of attention on problems requir
ing immediate decisions even
tually leads to making poor deci
sions even on immediate prob
lems. This is because any given
decision can only be made with
reference to a context larger
than itself.
Thus when all a person's time
is spent in making immediate
decisions, he loses the opportu
nity to reflect on the overall per
spective of what he is doing. And
this sacrifice will lead eventually
to the making of context-less de
cisions.
Role Conflict
The third sign of administra
tive problems is the role conflict.
An administrative officer is at
one and the same time respon
sible to academic bodies in the
faculty and to the hierarchic,
bureaucratic structure of the
administration.
On any given issue, where

does his highest loyalty fall? If
it is with the administration, he
loses his credibility with the
faculty and becomes "the ad
ministration's man." But if he
sides with the faculty, he is en
dangering his position in the
administrative hierarchy and
there can be no doubt that he
has grave responsibilities there.
How does a man integrate these
two roles? Maybe it cannot be
done.
There are several factors of
administration which may be
pointed to as causes of the prob
lems discussed above.
Harried Administrators
The most central of these
seems to be the time demands
made on administrators at Stan
ford. The schedule they keep is
so hectic that one feels that, at
any given time, the average ad
ministrator is approximately
thirteen minutes late to his last
appointment.
The kind of frazzled admini
strative life lead here does not
permit either deliberate treat
ment of long-range problems or
reflecting on perspectives larger
than the immediately present
one.
One can find several reasons
for the existence of this situa
tion. For one thing, Stanford
operates with a small admini
strative staff in comparison with
other major universities, and
thus must spend proportionally
more of its total administrative
time in day-to-day decisions.
Besides the pressures exerted
by a too-high ratio between daily
problems and staff, there are
other structural factors such as
the monthly Board of Trustees
meeting which requires a week
or more of work out of every
four.
'Administrative Mystique'
But more insidious than the
above two reasons is the admini
strative mystique that, in the
words of one administrator,
causes some men to "revel in
having two people on the phone
at once." Being chaotically busy
is something held up as a stan
dard to be emulated, at least
among some members of the
administration.
Other than the time demands
made on administrators, the
problems of role are the most
important causes of administra
tive self-undermining.
Role conflict, in which men get
pulled two directions, is one as
pect of the problem, but px*ob
ably not the most important. As
more central, one would cite the
fact that the administrator is
part of a hierarchical bureau
cracy in which "expediency" is
the key word.
Identifying With Role
A further role problem, and
one related to time demands, is
that an administrator has to
make so many appearances —
at committee meetings, at social
gatherings, etc. — in his role,
that he can easily come to iden
tify with it. This relates more
centrally to the personal tragedy
to be discussed below, but it has

its strictly administrative as
pects as well.
A person who is always in
one box never gets outside that
box to put the box in perspec
tive. In other words, just as the
time demands prevent the ad
ministrator from stepping back
to get perspective, so do the role
demands inhibit his attempts to
step outside his function to put
it in perspective.
There are several solutions
which have been proposed to
solve the problems of admini
stration outlined above. Sabba
ticals have been encouraged both
as an opportunity for reflection
and perspective-gaining and as
a way to say to a man "you're
not indispensable, we did with
out you for a year."
Rotate Posts
Rotation of administrative
posts, so that no man serves
for more than, say, three years,
has also received attention.
There are problems with this
suggestion however, because, in
the words of one administrator,
"many members of the faculty
wouldn't serve in the admini
stration for one year." Perhaps
the inevitability of a profes
sional, permanent administration
must be accepted.
One way to circumvent at
least some of the problems
caused by a professional ad
ministration would be to clear
ly differentiate policy decisions
from practice and to have policy
decisions made by university
wide committees. This is diffi
cult to work in practice, because
professional administrations
tend to win many battles by
the default of the committee in
volved.
'Knowledge Is Power*
"Knowledge is power" and no
where is this truer than in com
mittee-administration relations.
It often seems that policy deci
sions depend on a thorough
knowledge of daily practice and
this, of course, only the admini
strator has.
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
above and a tragedy with much
wider implications is the per
sonal tragedy of the human price
that men pay in order to be ad
ministrators. The same forces
that operate to cause admini
strative problems are the forces
of dehumanization that quietly
and largely without notice eat
away at a man's humanness.
The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty
in seeing a larger perspective,
they also facilitate dealing with
people in an "administrative"
manner.
Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him
self. Manipulation of others, even

to do the very necessary tasks
of the university, leads to instru
mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit
able, force of administration.
The combination of time de
mands and role filling that faci
litates an administrator's iden
tifying with his administrative
function and thus makes it diffi
cult for him to get outside to
see himself in perspective is also
the cause of personal tragedy:
a man spends so much of his
time, even his non-office time,
as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.
Conflict Developing
The pervasiveness of this out
look was demonstrated to me in
conversations I had with mem
bers of the administration about
the problems discussed in this
article.
All of them agreed about the
administrative tragedy, but no
one perceived or agreed that
there was any personal price
paid in administrating.
The implications of this are
great. A conflict which may be
one of the central issues in
America in the next few decades
is developing in embryonic form
here at Stanford. It is the diver
gence between a generation
which, on the whole, thinks in
functional terms and is very
leary of asking personal ques
tions and a generation which
focuses primarily on asking
questions about qualities of be
ing human, sometimes to the
extent of refusing to confront
pragmatic considerations.
'How To' vs. 'Who'
This divergence pervades all
the issues of student-administra
tion conflict here, because it is
at base a matter of what people
consider to be the most funda
mental human concern.
The nature of this divergence
was illumined by Michael Novak
in his class day talk to seniors
and their parents last June (re
cently published in the Daily).
"For the older generation,
whether conservative or liberal,
the key words which unlock the
meaning of human life are How
To: how to make money, how
to win friends and influence peo
ple, how to win at bridge, how
to master the secrets of nature,
how to predict and to control,
how to make a contribution to
society, how to live a productive
life."
"The assumption behind the
'How To' is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing our products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively
and flexibily programmed to ad
vance the aims of society. A suc
cessful human being is one who
knows How To."
Human Qualities
For many young people, how
ever, the question How To is

secondary. Their primary atten
tion is given not to the instru
ments of change but to the
qualities of being human. "How
To is an important, even indis
pensible, question for students
to master. But many students
are now going on to ask a furth
er and also indispensable ques
tion. Their primary question is
not How To, but Who. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?"
"... The question How To
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion Who makes man a self and
the world a thou: it opens man
to beauty, to wonder, and to joy.
. . . These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not separate
from us, a dumb, hard environ
ment, as if we were (in Alan
Watts' phrase) 'an ego in a
bag of skin' surrounded by for
eign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth buds forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calves,
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious."
Who Sees Truer?
What is at issue here is a
fundamentally different percep
tion of the world. And the ans

to be discussed below, but it has

its strictly administrative as
pects as well.
A person who is always in
one box never gets outside that
box to put the box in perspec
tive. In other words, just as the
time demands prevent the ad
ministrator from stepping back
to get perspective, so do the role
demands inhibit his attempts to
step outside his function to put
it in perspective.
There are several solutions
which have been proposed to
solve the problems of admini
stration outlined above. Sabba
ticals have been encouraged both
as an opportunity for reflection
and perspective-gaining and as
a way to say to a man "you're
not indispensable, we did with
out you for a year."
Rotate Posts
Rotation of administrative
posts, so that no man serves
for more than, say, three years,
has also received attention.
There are problems with this
suggestion however, because, in
the words of one administrator,
"many members of the faculty
wouldn't serve in the admini
stration for one year." Perhaps
the inevitability of a profes
sional, permanent administration
must be accepted.
One way to circumvent at
least some of the problems
caused by a professional ad
ministration would be to clear
ly differentiate policy decisions
from practice and to have policy
decisions made by university
wide committees. This is diffi
cult to work in practice, because
professional administrations
tend to win many battles by
the default of the committee in
volved.
'Knowledge Is Power*
"Knowledge is power" and no
where is this truer than in com
mittee-administration relations.
It often seems that policy deci
sions depend on a thorough
knowledge of daily practice and
this, of course, only the admini
strator has.
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
above and a tragedy with much
wider implications is the per
sonal tragedy of the human price
that men pay in order to be ad
ministrators. The same forces
that operate to cause admini
strative problems are the forces
of dehumanization that quietly
and largely without notice eat
away at a man's humanness.
The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty
in seeing a larger perspective,
they also facilitate dealing with
people in an "administrative"
manner.
Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him
self. Manipulation of others, even

to do the very necessary tasks
of the university, leads to instru
mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit
able, force of administration.
The combination of time de
mands and role filling that faci
litates an administrator's iden
tifying with his administrative
function and thus makes it diffi
cult for him to get outside to
see himself in perspective is also
the cause of personal tragedy:
a man spends so much of his
time, even his non-office time,
as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.
Conflict Developing
The pervasiveness of this out
look was demonstrated to me in
conversations I had with mem
bers of the administration about
the problems discussed in this
article.
All of them agreed about the
administrative tragedy, but no
one perceived or agreed that
there was any personal price
paid in administrating.
The implications of this are
great. A conflict which may be
one of the central issues in
America in the next few decades
is developing in embryonic form
here at Stanford. It is the diver
gence between a generation
which, on the whole, thinks in
functional terms and is very
leary of asking personal ques
tions and a generation which
focuses primarily on asking
questions about qualities of be
ing human, sometimes to the
extent of refusing to confront
pragmatic considerations.
'How To' vs. 'Who'
This divergence pervades all
the issues of student-administra
tion conflict here, because it is
at base a matter of what people
consider to be the most funda
mental human concern.
The nature of this divergence
was illumined by Michael Novak
in his class day talk to seniors
and their parents last June (re
cently published in the Daily).
"For the older generation,
whether conservative or liberal,
the key words which unlock the
meaning of human life are How
To: how to make money, how
to win friends and influence peo
ple, how to win at bridge, how
to master the secrets of nature,
how to predict and to control,
how to make a contribution to
society, how to live a productive
life."
"The assumption behind the
'How To' is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing our products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively
and flexibily programmed to ad
vance the aims of society. A suc
cessful human being is one who
knows How To."
Human Qualities
For many young people, how
ever, the question How To is

secondary. Their primary atten
tion is given not to the instru
ments of change but to the
qualities of being human. "How
To is an important, even indis
pensible, question for students
to master. But many students
are now going on to ask a furth
er and also indispensable ques
tion. Their primary question is
not How To, but Who. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?"
"... The question How To
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion Who makes man a self and
the world a thou: it opens man
to beauty, to wonder, and to joy.
. . . These trees we stand under,
this sky, — they are not separate
from us, a dumb, hard environ
ment, as if we were (in Alan
Watts' phrase) 'an ego in a
bag of skin' surrounded by for
eign objects. On the contrary,
our selves are connected organ
ically to everything. The sun
shines, the earth buds forth, ap
ple trees apple, cows calves,
the universe peoples. Who are
we? We are the universe becom
ing conscious."
Who Sees Truer?
What is at issue here is a
fundamentally different percep
tion of the world. And the ans
wer to the question who, young
or old, is seeing truer will go
a long way toward determining
how this conflict may be re
solved at Stanford, which would
in turn provide a model to sol
ving this conflict more general
ly-
Students are claiming that
they are seeing things that their
elders have not seen and that

this new perspective changes
one's priorities fundamentally.
When students make this
claim, however, they are buck
ing a strong social current in
America which correlates wis
dom with age. An older person
has necessarily experienced
more and thus his perception of
the world includes that of young
er people, but goes beyond it.
Students challenge this and say
that they have indeed experi
enced things that older people
have not.
(Editor's Note: This paper
was written by Bruce Campbell,
1966 graduate of Stanford, af
ter working this summer for the
Study of Education at Stanford.
The paper is one of many that
have been submitted to the SES
by faculty, staff, students, and
graduates.)

"What is it about administra
tion," said the Dean, "that seems
to turn good men into horse's
asses?"
His frank statement pointed
to a problem facing Stanford's
and every other administration:
how to combat the almost dem
onically strong forces of dehu
manization present in the act
of administrating.
These forces give rise to a
two-fold tragedy, both admini
strative and personal. On the
one hand, administration carries
within it forces that tend to un
dermine administration itself;
but further, many of those who
administrate succumb on a per
sonal level as well to the strong
forces of dehumanization.
This article will discuss both
of these tragedies, looking at
their causes, remedies, and
larger implications.
Signs of Undermining
There are at least three major
signs that administration is un
dermining itself. The first is an
administrator's refusal to deal
with any but the most imme
diate problems. Questions which
involve reflection and long-range
planning are avoided.
This sign is perhaps the most
irksome to students, and much
of their discussion of education
in the years before the SES was
predicated on the position that
they were filling a University
lacuna to speak of goals of edu
cation, the relation of the Uni
versity to society, and related
questions. Their criticism seems
to have been tacitly accepted,
however, as a new administra
tive post for long-range planning
was created last year.
The second, and related, sign
is a loss of context. A focusing
of attention on problems requir
ing immediate decisions even
tually leads to making poor deci
sions even on immediate prob
lems. This is because any given
decision can only be made with
reference to a context larger
than itself.
Thus when all a person's time
is spent in making immediate
decisions, he loses the opportu
nity to reflect on the overall per
spective of what he is doing. And
this sacrifice will lead eventually
to the making of context-less de
cisions.
Role Conflict
The third sign of administra
tive problems is the role conflict.
An administrative officer is at
one and the same time respon
sible to academic bodies in the
faculty and to the hierarchic,
bureaucratic structure of the
administration.
On any given issue, where

does his highest loyalty fall? If
it is with the administration, he
loses his credibility with the
faculty and becomes "the ad
ministration's man." But if he
sides with the faculty, he is en
dangering his position in the
administrative hierarchy and
there can be no doubt that he
has grave responsibilities there.
How does a man integrate these
two roles? Maybe it cannot be
done.
There are several factors of
administration which may be
pointed to as causes of the prob
lems discussed above.
Harried Administrators
The most central of these
seems to be the time demands
made on administrators at Stan
ford. The schedule they keep is
so hectic that one feels that, at
any given time, the average ad
ministrator is approximately
thirteen minutes late to his last
appointment.
The kind of frazzled admini
strative life lead here does not
permit either deliberate treat
ment of long-range problems or
reflecting on perspectives larger
than the immediately present
one.
One can find several reasons
for the existence of this situa
tion. For one thing, Stanford
operates with a small admini
strative staff in comparison with
other major universities, and
thus must spend proportionally
more of its total administrative
time in day-to-day decisions.
Besides the pressures exerted
by a too-high ratio between daily
problems and staff, there are
other structural factors such as
the monthly Board of Trustees
meeting which requires a week
or more of work out of every
four.
'Administrative Mystique'
But more insidious than the
above two reasons is the admini
strative mystique that, in the
words of one administrator,
causes some men to "revel in
having two people on the phone
at once." Being chaotically busy
is something held up as a stan
dard to be emulated, at least
among some members of the
administration.
Other than the time demands
made on administrators, the
problems of role are the most
important causes of administra
tive self-undermining.
Role conflict, in which men get
pulled two directions, is one as
pect of the problem, but px*ob
ably not the most important. As
more central, one would cite the
fact that the administrator is
part of a hierarchical bureau
cracy in which "expediency" is
the key word.
Identifying With Role
A further role problem, and
one related to time demands, is
that an administrator has to
make so many appearances —
at committee meetings, at social
gatherings, etc. — in his role,
that he can easily come to iden
tify with it. This relates more
centrally to the personal tragedy
to be discussed below, but it has

its strictly administrative as
pects as well.
A person who is always in
one box never gets outside that
box to put the box in perspec
tive. In other words, just as the
time demands prevent the ad
ministrator from stepping back
to get perspective, so do the role
demands inhibit his attempts to
step outside his function to put
it in perspective.
There are several solutions
which have been proposed to
solve the problems of admini
stration outlined above. Sabba
ticals have been encouraged both
as an opportunity for reflection
and perspective-gaining and as
a way to say to a man "you're
not indispensable, we did with
out you for a year."
Rotate Posts
Rotation of administrative
posts, so that no man serves
for more than, say, three years,
has also received attention.
There are problems with this
suggestion however, because, in
the words of one administrator,
"many members of the faculty
wouldn't serve in the admini
stration for one year." Perhaps
the inevitability of a profes
sional, permanent administration
must be accepted.
One way to circumvent at
least some of the problems
caused by a professional ad
ministration would be to clear
ly differentiate policy decisions
from practice and to have policy
decisions made by university
wide committees. This is diffi
cult to work in practice, because
professional administrations

the default of the committee in

'Knowledge Is Power*
"Knowledge is power" and no
where is this truer than in com
mittee-administration relations.
It often seems that policy deci
sions depend on a thorough
knowledge of daily practice and
this, of course, only the admini
strator has.
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
above and a tragedy with much
wider implications is the per
sonal tragedy of the human price
that men pay in order to be ad
ministrators. The same forces
that operate to cause admini
strative problems are the forces
of dehumanization that quietly

The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty

Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him

mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit

The combination of time de

the cause of personal tragedy:

as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.

Who Sees Truer?
What is at issue here is a
fundamentally different percep
tion of the world. And the ans
wer to the question who, young
or old, is seeing truer will go
a long way toward determining
how this conflict may be re
solved at Stanford, which would
in turn provide a model to sol
ving this conflict more general
ly-
Students are claiming that
they are seeing things that their
elders have not seen and that

this new perspective changes
one's priorities fundamentally.
When students make this
claim, however, they are buck
ing a strong social current in
America which correlates wis
dom with age. An older person
has necessarily experienced
more and thus his perception of
the world includes that of young
er people, but goes beyond it.
Students challenge this and say
that they have indeed experi
enced things that older people
have not.
(Editor's Note: This paper
was written by Bruce Campbell,
1966 graduate of Stanford, af
ter working this summer for the
Study of Education at Stanford.
The paper is one of many that
have been submitted to the SES
by faculty, staff, students, and
graduates.)

"What is it about administra
tion," said the Dean, "that seems
to turn good men into horse's
asses?"
His frank statement pointed
to a problem facing Stanford's
and every other administration:
how to combat the almost dem
onically strong forces of dehu
manization present in the act
of administrating.
These forces give rise to a
two-fold tragedy, both admini
strative and personal. On the
one hand, administration carries
within it forces that tend to un
dermine administration itself;
but further, many of those who
administrate succumb on a per
sonal level as well to the strong
forces of dehumanization.
This article will discuss both
of these tragedies, looking at
their causes, remedies, and
larger implications.
Signs of Undermining
There are at least three major
signs that administration is un
dermining itself. The first is an
administrator's refusal to deal
with any but the most imme
diate problems. Questions which
involve reflection and long-range
planning are avoided.
This sign is perhaps the most
irksome to students, and much
of their discussion of education
in the years before the SES was
predicated on the position that
they were filling a University
lacuna to speak of goals of edu
cation, the relation of the Uni
versity to society, and related
questions. Their criticism seems
to have been tacitly accepted,
however, as a new administra
tive post for long-range planning
was created last year.
The second, and related, sign
is a loss of context. A focusing
of attention on problems requir
ing immediate decisions even
tually leads to making poor deci
sions even on immediate prob
lems. This is because any given
decision can only be made with
reference to a context larger
than itself.
Thus when all a person's time
is spent in making immediate
decisions, he loses the opportu
nity to reflect on the overall per
spective of what he is doing. And
this sacrifice will lead eventually
to the making of context-less de
cisions.
Role Conflict
The third sign of administra
tive problems is the role conflict.
An administrative officer is at
one and the same time respon
sible to academic bodies in the
faculty and to the hierarchic,
bureaucratic structure of the
administration.
On any given issue, where

does his highest loyalty fall? If
it is with the administration, he
loses his credibility with the
faculty and becomes "the ad
ministration's man." But if he
sides with the faculty, he is en
dangering his position in the
administrative hierarchy and
there can be no doubt that he
has grave responsibilities there.
How does a man integrate these
two roles? Maybe it cannot be
done.
There are several factors of
administration which may be
pointed to as causes of the prob
lems discussed above.
Harried Administrators
The most central of these
seems to be the time demands
made on administrators at Stan
ford. The schedule they keep is
so hectic that one feels that, at
any given time, the average ad
ministrator is approximately
thirteen minutes late to his last
appointment.
The kind of frazzled admini
strative life lead here does not
permit either deliberate treat
ment of long-range problems or
reflecting on perspectives larger
than the immediately present
one.
One can find several reasons
for the existence of this situa
tion. For one thing, Stanford
operates with a small admini
strative staff in comparison with
other major universities, and
thus must spend proportionally
more of its total administrative
time in day-to-day decisions.
Besides the pressures exerted
by a too-high ratio between daily
problems and staff, there are
other structural factors such as
the monthly Board of Trustees
meeting which requires a week
or more of work out of every
four.
'Administrative Mystique'
But more insidious than the
above two reasons is the admini
strative mystique that, in the
words of one administrator,
causes some men to "revel in
having two people on the phone
at once." Being chaotically busy
is something held up as a stan
dard to be emulated, at least
among some members of the
administration.
Other than the time demands
made on administrators, the
problems of role are the most
important causes of administra
tive self-undermining.
Role conflict, in which men get
pulled two directions, is one as
pect of the problem, but px*ob
ably not the most important. As
more central, one would cite the
fact that the administrator is
part of a hierarchical bureau
cracy in which "expediency" is
the key word.
Identifying With Role
A further role problem, and
one related to time demands, is
that an administrator has to
make so many appearances —
at committee meetings, at social
gatherings, etc. — in his role,
that he can easily come to iden
tify with it. This relates more
centrally to the personal tragedy
to be discussed below, but it has

its strictly administrative as
pects as well.
A person who is always in
one box never gets outside that
box to put the box in perspec
tive. In other words, just as the
time demands prevent the ad
ministrator from stepping back
to get perspective, so do the role
demands inhibit his attempts to
step outside his function to put
it in perspective.
There are several solutions
which have been proposed to
solve the problems of admini
stration outlined above. Sabba
ticals have been encouraged both
as an opportunity for reflection
and perspective-gaining and as
a way to say to a man "you're
not indispensable, we did with
out you for a year."
Rotate Posts
Rotation of administrative
posts, so that no man serves
for more than, say, three years,
has also received attention.
There are problems with this
suggestion however, because, in
the words of one administrator,
"many members of the faculty
wouldn't serve in the admini
stration for one year." Perhaps
the inevitability of a profes
sional, permanent administration
must be accepted.
One way to circumvent at
least some of the problems
caused by a professional ad
ministration would be to clear
ly differentiate policy decisions
from practice and to have policy
decisions made by university
wide committees. This is diffi
cult to work in practice, because
professional administrations
tend to win many battles by
the default of the committee in
volved.
'Knowledge Is Power*
"Knowledge is power" and no
where is this truer than in com
mittee-administration relations.
It often seems that policy deci
sions depend on a thorough
knowledge of daily practice and
this, of course, only the admini
strator has.
An even greater tragedy than
the administrative one described
above and a tragedy with much
wider implications is the per
sonal tragedy of the human price
that men pay in order to be ad
ministrators. The same forces
that operate to cause admini
strative problems are the forces
of dehumanization that quietly
and largely without notice eat
away at a man's humanness.
The time demands on an ad
ministrator, for example are not
only the cause of his difficulty
in seeing a larger perspective,
they also facilitate dealing with
people in an "administrative"
manner.
Not Seen As Humans
People are no longer seen as
human beings but rather as
possessors of information need
ed to solve a problem or as the
instruments through which an
issue will be resolved.
The way in which a person
relates to others determines the
way in which he conceives him
self. Manipulation of others, even

to do the very necessary tasks
of the university, leads to instru
mentalization of the self. This
is a strong, though not inevit
able, force of administration.
The combination of time de
mands and role filling that faci
litates an administrator's iden
tifying with his administrative
function and thus makes it diffi
cult for him to get outside to
see himself in perspective is also
the cause of personal tragedy:
a man spends so much of his
time, even his non-office time,
as Dean, that he can very easily
come to think of himself only
in terms of his function and can
not look at himself as a person.
Conflict Developing
The pervasiveness of this out
look was demonstrated to me in
conversations I had with mem
bers of the administration about
the problems discussed in this
article.
All of them agreed about the
administrative tragedy, but no
one perceived or agreed that
there was any personal price
paid in administrating.
The implications of this are
great. A conflict which may be
one of the central issues in
America in the next few decades
is developing in embryonic form
here at Stanford. It is the diver
gence between a generation
which, on the whole, thinks in
functional terms and is very
leary of asking personal ques
tions and a generation which
focuses primarily on asking
questions about qualities of be
ing human, sometimes to the
extent of refusing to confront
pragmatic considerations.
'How To' vs. 'Who'
This divergence pervades all
the issues of student-administra
tion conflict here, because it is
at base a matter of what people
consider to be the most funda
mental human concern.
The nature of this divergence
was illumined by Michael Novak
in his class day talk to seniors
and their parents last June (re
cently published in the Daily).
"For the older generation,
whether conservative or liberal,
the key words which unlock the
meaning of human life are How
To: how to make money, how
to win friends and influence peo
ple, how to win at bridge, how
to master the secrets of nature,
how to predict and to control,
how to make a contribution to
society, how to live a productive
life."
"The assumption behind the
'How To' is that knowledge is
power, and that man is an in
strument of that most important
of our products, progress. Man,
it sometimes seems, is a sensi
tive computer, and education is
a complicated machine for turn
ing our products of whom so
ciety will be proud: sensitively
and flexibily programmed to ad
vance the aims of society. A suc
cessful human being is one who
knows How To."
Human Qualities
For many young people, how
ever, the question How To is

secondary. Their primary atten
tion is given not to the instru
ments of change but to the
qualities of being human. "How
To is an important, even indis
pensible, question for students
to master. But many students
are now going on to ask a furth
er and also indispensable ques
tion. Their primary question is
not How To, but Who. Who am
I? Who are we, we Americans,
with immense power and wealth
and guilt and restlessness?"
"... The question How To
makes man a machine and na
ture a raw material. The ques
tion Who makes man a self and
the world a thou: it opens man
to beauty, to wonder, and to joy.

ing conscious."
