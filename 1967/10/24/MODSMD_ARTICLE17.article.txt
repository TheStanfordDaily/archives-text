# Eavesdropping?
## Residents Suspect Toyon Operators 
### 
Residents of Wilbur, Stern
and Crothers halls are gradually
becoming aware that the inter
com speakers in their walls can
be used by telephone switch
board operators to eavesdrop on
their rooms.
The intercom system, de
signed to page students when
they receive calls, has been
permanently tuned in to dormi
tory rooms ever since the "pri
vacy" switches were discon
nected last year. Too many stu
dents apparently neglected to
turn the switches from "pri
vacy" to "talk," and a high fre
quency tone made communica
tion difficult when the "privacy"
switches were connected. So
they were all disconnected,
leaving the paging systems per
manently on "talk." Which
means an operator can listen in
at will.
Naturally operators do noth
ing of the sort, according to
chief operator Larry Nicholas.
Besides, the reception is not
very good.
But one former operator ad
mits listening to rock and roll
music in a Wilbur lounge dur
ing slow periods. And many of
the 2000 students served by the
switchboard have been surprised
at how easily the operators can
hear their replies to paging
calls.

Moreover the intercom system
frequently gives off a series of
little blips as the operator is
paging a person. Unfortunately
the blips can be heard in rooms
all up and down the hall.
It has not been established,
however, that anything occurs
in rooms of Stem, Wilbur and
Crothers worth listening in on.
The underhanded switchboard
staff doesn't have time to eaves
drop anyway, Nicholas asserted
busily.


TOYON OPERATORS â€”Chief operator Larry Nicholas and John
Hancock, another operator, are shown smiling at their switch
boards. They smile rather knowingly, and residents wonder just
what the operators do know about the private conversations of
those whom they serve.
