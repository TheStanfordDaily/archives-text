# Geneticist Predicts Injection Of Genes
## 
### 
Geneticists may be able, with
in "a few years," to reproduce
an exact likeness of a human
being, and to cure certain inher
ited diseases by injecting new
genes into the victim's cells, ac
cording to Professor Joshua
Lederberg, Executive Head of
Stanford's Genetics Department.
Professor Lederberg, a Nobel
prize winner, who was awarded
an honorary Doctor of Science
degree from Columbia Friday,
expressed these ideas the same
day as part of a three-day sym
posium on genetics and develop
ment at Columbia University's
College of Physicians and Sur
geons.
The experiment of artificially
growing an exact likeness of an
individual has been performed
regularly on frogs, according
to Dr. Lederberg. The experi
ment could conceivably be done
on humans by removing the
nucleus from a fertilized human
egg and inserting another nu
cleus, taken from any cell of
the individual to be reproduced.
Dr. Lederberg cited phenylke
tonuria (PKU), an inherited di
sease characterized by mental
retardation and brain damage,
as an example of a disease
which could conceivably be cured

by injecting certain genes into
the victim.
As soon as geneticists propose
injecting new genetic informa
tion, Lederberg noted, people
"throw up their arms" in hor
ror. But, he said, "We're doing
things to ourselves all the time
by the use of live virus vac
cines in mass immunization. I
see nothing fundamentally dif
ferent between vaccinating with
a live virus and introducing new
genetic information into an in
dividual."
