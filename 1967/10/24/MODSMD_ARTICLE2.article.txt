# Students Start N.Y. Boycott
## 
### 
Thousands of students at
Brooklyn College in New York
continued their strike of classes
yesterday, after rejecting at a

mass rally five of eight agree
ments drafted by faculty and
student representatives.
The strike, which started after
police invaded the campus
Thursday to break up an anti
war demonstration, will prob
ably continue at least through
today and possibly longer.
Thursday's demonstration be
gan when a group of students,
protesting the presence of Navy
recruiters on campus, staged a
sit-in.
Several students and a police
man were injured, and more
than 50 students and three fac
ulty members were arrested.
Students have boycotted
classes in protest of "police bru
tality" and the asserted supres
sion of academic freedom.
Of the 10,000 day students at
the school, fewer than 2,000
have been attending classes
since the boycott was announced
Thursday night.
About 250 of 800 faculty mem
bers voted yesterday afternoon
not to hold their classes for the
next 24 hours.
After the strike was called,
faculty and student representa
tives drew up a list of eight de
mands for the administration.
The administration conceded
to the majority of the demands,
but the students accepted only
three of the eight during yes
terday's mass rally.
A committee composed only
of students is redrafting the de
mands. The new statements will
be brought up at another mass
rally and, if accepted, will be
presented to the administration,
whose reaction to the new lists
will probably determine the
length of the strike.
