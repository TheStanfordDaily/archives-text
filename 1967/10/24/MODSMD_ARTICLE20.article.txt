# US Troops Take Tot'

### 
It appears that marijuana
may be replacing morphine in
the jungles of Vietnam.
John Steinbeck IV, son of the
prize-winning novelist, alleges
that more than three-fourths of
American troops in Vietnam are
using marijuana.
His charges appear in drafts
of articles submitted for publi
cation in The Washingtonian
magazine in December and early
next year.
Steinbeck, 21, who recently
returned from duty in Southeast
Asia, was arrested a week ago
on narcotics charges.
