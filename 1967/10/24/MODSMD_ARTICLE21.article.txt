# Educators Meet
## Can Students Take Part? 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS)— The
nation's leading educators are
beginning to accept the idea that
students should be actively in
volved in the decisions which
affect their education.
But they are undecided about
just how far this involvement
should extend and are worried
about its affects on such prac
tical matters as relations with

trustees, legislators, and the
public, as well as on the very
education which universities
provide.
Student involvement in de
cision-making came up often as
administrators of colleges and
universities across the nation
attended the 59th annual meet
ing of the American Council
on Education earlier this month.

And although many of the
panelists at the convention have
publicly endorsed significant
student participation in determ
ining the major policies of aca
demic institutions, there seems
to be an undercurrent of fear
of the student activist move
ment and of the cries for stu
dent power.
The overall sentiment, how
ever, is that students should
play a role in the decision-mak
ing process. But there are few
definitive answers as to just
how students should be in
volved, and no one is coming
forth with a formula for de
fining how much actual author
ity students should have.
Edward Robinson, former
University of Michigan student
body president, assailed the ad
ministrators for their views on
student participation. Adminis
trators "don't see the problem
of student involvement beyond
how many students should be
on a certain committee," Robin
son said, while the important
decisions are generally made
"by a small group of presidents
and vice presidents behind
closed doors."
Robinson said students should
participate actively and help de
cide important policy matters,
such as the relationships be
tween teaching and research
and between government and
the the university.
