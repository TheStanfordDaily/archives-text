# LBJ's Viet Policy Same After Protest
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
President Johnson made it clear
Monday that a sometimes-vio
lent weekend demonstration
against the Vietnam war has
made no change in U.S. policy
in Asia.
He reaffirmed that policy in
a speech which made no refer
ence to the thousands of pickets
who had marched on the Penta
gon, with 680 arrests and 47
persons injured.
The timing and the tone of
his address to a clerical work
ers' group gave it the appear
ance of a reply, if any was
needed, to those who massed to
urge that the United States
abandon the fighting in Viet
nam.
The President insisted, as he
has often, that the United States
is searching for peace in Viet
nam in every possible way "but
we appear to be searching
alone."
Stability
"Peace and stability will come
to Asia," he said, "only when
the aggressors know that they
cannot take another people's
land by force."
And in a separate statement
praising the troops assigned to
keep order during the demon
stration, Johnson spoke of the
"irresponsible acts of violence
and lawlessness by many of the
demonstrators."
Johnson addressed the 18th
Triennial Conference of the In
ternational Federation of Com
mercial, Clerical and Technical
Workers, which represents
white- collar workers in 62 coun
ties.

He said those who started the
Vietnam war "cling stubbornly
to the belief that their aggres
sion will be rewarded —by our
frustration, our impatience, our
unwillingness to stay the
course."
Then he added: "It will not
be so."
The State Department de
clined any official comment on
the impact which peace dem
onstrations here and abroad
might have on U.S. policy in
Vietnam. But officials privately
said they could detect no change
whatever.
The demonstration itself
dwindled away to a couple of
belated pickets early Monday.
And the 27,000 workers in the
Pentagon returned normally to
their jobs.
