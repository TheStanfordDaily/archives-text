## Arkansas Auditor Stops Publication 
### 
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. — The
University of Arkansas's stu
dent literary magazine cannot
be printed because four poems
in it have offended the State
Auditor and the head of the uni
versity printing shop.
State Auditor Jimmie Jones
refused to let the magazine, Pre
view, be printed because he said
the poems were "in bad taste."
They referred to excretory func
tions of the body.
He said he was not sure he
had the legal right to stop the
printing but said he was acting
on moral grounds.
English Professor William
Harrison, one of Preview's fac
ulty advisors, said he did not
regard the poems as obscene.
He added, "It's hardly [Jones']
job to rule on the literary value
of work."
University printer A. W.
Blake objected to some of the
words in the poems and refused
to print them. University Presi
dent David W. Mullins refused
to overrule Blake.
Mullins said, "If our printer
doesn't feel that it should be
printed, I wouldn't frankly have
the knowledge to dispute him."

FAIRFIELD, lowa—The New
York Times reports Parsons Col
lege, which lost its accreditation
earlier this year, has also lost
more than half its faculty and
students.

The Parsons faculty is down
from 200 to 85 and the student
enrollment is down from 4,800
to 2,200. Faculty salaries, which
once ran from $20,000 to $26,000
for full professors and some
times as high as $35,000, have
been cut back drastically.
Dr. Millard G. Roberts, the
aggressive president who took
over Parsons in 1955 and trans
formed it from a sleepy mid
western Presbyterian college
into a fast-growing, nationally
known haven for second-rate
students, is also gone from the
campus.
The faculty and staff, in the
meantime, have been working
hard to "save Parsons, to re
store its honor, its enrollment,
its financial stability, and their
own drastically reduced sala
ries," according to The Times.

NEW YORK—A student cam
paign at City College to save
some trees on the campus has
turned into a campaign for
more student-faculty participa
tion in the college's decision
making.
The movement began three
weeks ago to halt the destruc
tion of a small park on which
the college wanted to build tem
porary offices and classrooms.
It quickly grew into a major
confrontation. In a week of dem
onstrations, nine students were
arrested and seven faced pos

sible suspension. But the out
come was a two-week delay in
the construction plans.
Some demonstrators said they
thought the college administra
tion had lied to them and nego
tiated in bad faith. One told
CCNY President Buell G. Gal
lagher, "I'm sorry to say I just
don't trust the administration."
Gallagher denied charges of
duplicity. Dean of Students Wil
lard W. Blaesser told students,
after the arrests were made and
the trees sawed down, that the
college was bound by a bureau
cratic morass" to have the con
struction done on schedule.
The student government re
pudiated the student "shadow
cabinet" that discusses long
range planning with Gallagher.
It called the cabinet a group
of "pacifiers."
The students decided to press
Instead for full membership on
the president's regular advisory
committee of deans and admin
istrators.

ANN ARBOR, Mich. (IP) —
Universities should add to their
faculties more teachers who are
"specialists in generalization,"
according to Allan F. Smith,
vice president for academic af
fairs at the University of Michi
gan.
The explosion of knowledge
makes its integration, particu
larly for the undergraduate stu
dent, more difficult than ever,
Smith explained.
The teacher who helps the
student accomplish this is es
sential — but the rewards of
academic scholarship are harder
for the generalist to come by.
