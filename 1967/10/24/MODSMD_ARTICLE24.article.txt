# Jailed In Oakland
## Pugh Examines Decision 
### DAVID PUGH 
(Editor's note: The writer was arrested during last weeks anti
draft demonstrations at the Oakland Armed Forces Induction Cen
ter. He served five days in Santa Rita prison, the Alameda County
Rehabilitation Center, and was released Saturday. The Daily asked
Mr. Pugh why he decided to sit-in at the induction center. He re
plied with this article.)
I was a freshman last spring. It was spring when I finally read
Bernard Fall, and Dave Harris came to Wilbur with his slides ana
his shoulders hunched over his knees.
And for a vibratingly live dead week, I cried and punched out
these words for Michael Novak and myself:
"I am scared that a decision not to hand in my draft card will
prevent me from living an honest life and will make the changes
I want to make in society shrink away in comparison with the
enormity of my sin. I fear that I may become insensitive and gain
the power but lose the capacity to make honest decisions.
"Conversely, I am scared that a decision to hand in my draft
card will render me ineffectual in the society I want so desperately
to change. And the more I learn what life is, the more I love it.
Can I face prison for five years? ....
"My attitude towards killing does not help me make my decision
on the draft, but it does illustrate my confusion about myself and
the world. It is very possible that killing will continue until people
just refuse to kill other people.
"But it is also possible that a responsible use of force will best
lead to a peaceful world. If I were to accept that responsibility, I
couldn't say that the ends wouldn't justify the means, for if the
ends wouldn't, what would?"
Abstraction
After five days in jail, five years is still an abstract threat and
my draft card still rests alongside my University meal card.
Over the summer I discovered that enough of the present me had
been propelled into the future by parents, schooling, and the past
me so that I could not take an action that a new and growing part
of me demanded.
I decided that I could not join an organization that would take
any part of my responsibility to decide if I would take another
human being's life, yet I couldn't lay down five years of my life
to fight that organization.
In the muddled first three weeks of sophomore Stanford I drifted
to the conclusion that I could better spend my time by reading
about the American power structure and pacifism than by march
ing in the streets.
I felt that the war would just have to burn itself out, that ra
tional men would finally get a hearing, and that I might entrust
to myself the job of laying the theoretical foundations for a vol
unteer army and for a post-negotiations economic development
plan for Southeast Asia.
After all, any intelligent liberal knows that the problem in Asia
is not Communism but poverty.
Reality
STOP.
The roar of a B-52 shook my book. Human beings are killing
each other in Vietnam. Some press buttons, but the books cannot
be read right now.
STOP was last Sunday afternoon. The projectile of my guilt
blew away the ectodermic shell I had slowly secreted.
The decision to hand in my draft card had spawned a sterile sis
ter, a grotesque double of the honest search I'd gone through last
spring. I decided I couldn't face five years in jail last spring; by
Sunday I couldn't go to jail for any reason.
It might help to explain what happened at the Stop the Draft
Week planning meeting two Thursday nights ago. John Shippee
took the rostrum first to explain that on Monday a group of people
were planning to lie down in front of the doors of the Oakland
induction center.
They wanted to make it clear to the inductees and the public

that they would have to step on other human beings in order to
enter the United States Armed Forces.
John asked us to come Monday only if we were committed to
non-violence and if we were ready to go to jail. Polite applause.
Tuesday, Tuesday
The Tuesday people proceeded to take over the meeting.
A leader of the Resistance warned us that the Tuesday cops
might start busting heads and suggested that we might take picket
signs in case we wanted to protect or defend ourselves.
There was an air of mock seriousness and celebration about the
rest of that meeting that helped me to stop thinking and feeling
about the coming week. I made a mental note to be sure to drive
up either Monday or Tuesday to see what might happen.
I had lost sight of the values that would integrate my life with
the world and people around me.
One definition of the mature man is that he understands how
his personal problems extend into the social reality and conversely
that he understands how the social milieu impinges upon his per
son. In the sense of being able to respond, responsibility can
emerge only from the dialectical crossfire of this process.
I now saw that I didn't have to submit a twenty-page paper on
the political and military consequences of a volunteer army in or
der to go to jail to oppose the draft.
I had to act against the draft before I could expect the American
public to consider alternatives to the draft.
I had to act to stop the killing.
I had to act to show the state that it could not channel my con
science into the production of academic drivel.
I had to make a leap of affirmation, a leap at the point where
reason fails, where conscience turns into conscientiousness and
where courage comes or does not come.
Like The South
It helped me to draw a mental parallel between Monday's planned
non-violent demonstration and the civil rights sit-ins and marches
in the South. I began to understand that law can never be treated
as anything but an approximation to justice.
If it widens the ever-present gap between law and justice, the
consequences of obedience can be more harmful than the conse
quences of disobedience. When a man who campaigned in 1964 on
a pledge not to fight a war has been fighting it for three years
since, one cannot wait until November 1968 to cast one's vote.
If all other means have failed, a man has the right and the duty
to publicly disobey the law and openly accept the consequences of
that action. An act of non-violent civil disobedience strengthens
the concept of law as justice by challenging a particular unjust
law.
It's rather cheeky of me to group myself with Socrates, Jesus,
Thomas Jefferson, and Dr. King, so I'll just say it's cheeky of me
to do so ...
And I sat thinking Sunday afternoon how I would answer charges
of anarchy.
Realization
On Sunday afternoon I understood that I couldn't honestly main
tain my commitment to radical change, which I had been fond of
speaking of, at a junction where effective political action was pos
sible and where the risk to my future plans was minimal. And that
risk had lost its element of fear, for I would be making my future
the next day.
As I write about the decisions I made from last spring to last
Sunday, I feel they were so strange and wonderful that they prob
ably make little sense to others. And so it may be.
It would be easy to write about jail, that funny jail that was so
much like summer camp except sirens had replaced bugles and
single file has replaced the buddy system. But descriptions of Santa
Rita will not help us grasp that life not only requires decision, but
is decision.
Pictures of fleshy decadent cops will not help us grapple with
the coming debate over the future place of violence in a peace
movement.
My Monday was very beautiful and peaceful. I hope we can learn
from our past decisions, for we have many more to make.

took the rostrum first to explain that on Monday a group of people
were planning to lie down in front of the doors of the Oakland
induction center.
They wanted to make it clear to the inductees and the public

that they would have to step on other human beings in order to
enter the United States Armed Forces.
John asked us to come Monday only if we were committed to
non-violence and if we were ready to go to jail. Polite applause.
Tuesday, Tuesday
The Tuesday people proceeded to take over the meeting.
A leader of the Resistance warned us that the Tuesday cops
might start busting heads and suggested that we might take picket
signs in case we wanted to protect or defend ourselves.
There was an air of mock seriousness and celebration about the
rest of that meeting that helped me to stop thinking and feeling
about the coming week. I made a mental note to be sure to drive
up either Monday or Tuesday to see what might happen.
I had lost sight of the values that would integrate my life with
the world and people around me.
One definition of the mature man is that he understands how
his personal problems extend into the social reality and conversely
that he understands how the social milieu impinges upon his per
son. In the sense of being able to respond, responsibility can
emerge only from the dialectical crossfire of this process.
I now saw that I didn't have to submit a twenty-page paper on
the political and military consequences of a volunteer army in or
der to go to jail to oppose the draft.
I had to act against the draft before I could expect the American
public to consider alternatives to the draft.
I had to act to stop the killing.
I had to act to show the state that it could not channel my con
science into the production of academic drivel.
I had to make a leap of affirmation, a leap at the point where
reason fails, where conscience turns into conscientiousness and
where courage comes or does not come.
Like The South
It helped me to draw a mental parallel between Monday's planned
non-violent demonstration and the civil rights sit-ins and marches
in the South. I began to understand that law can never be treated
as anything but an approximation to justice.
If it widens the ever-present gap between law and justice, the
consequences of obedience can be more harmful than the conse
quences of disobedience. When a man who campaigned in 1964 on
a pledge not to fight a war has been fighting it for three years
since, one cannot wait until November 1968 to cast one's vote.
If all other means have failed, a man has the right and the duty
to publicly disobey the law and openly accept the consequences of
that action. An act of non-violent civil disobedience strengthens
the concept of law as justice by challenging a particular unjust
law.
It's rather cheeky of me to group myself with Socrates, Jesus,
Thomas Jefferson, and Dr. King, so I'll just say it's cheeky of me
to do so ...
And I sat thinking Sunday afternoon how I would answer charges
of anarchy.
Realization
On Sunday afternoon I understood that I couldn't honestly main
tain my commitment to radical change, which I had been fond of
speaking of, at a junction where effective political action was pos
sible and where the risk to my future plans was minimal. And that
risk had lost its element of fear, for I would be making my future
the next day.
As I write about the decisions I made from last spring to last
Sunday, I feel they were so strange and wonderful that they prob
ably make little sense to others. And so it may be.
It would be easy to write about jail, that funny jail that was so
much like summer camp except sirens had replaced bugles and
single file has replaced the buddy system. But descriptions of Santa
Rita will not help us grasp that life not only requires decision, but
is decision.
Pictures of fleshy decadent cops will not help us grapple with
the coming debate over the future place of violence in a peace
movement.
My Monday was very beautiful and peaceful. I hope we can learn
from our past decisions, for we have many more to make.
(Editor's note: The writer was arrested during last weeks anti
draft demonstrations at the Oakland Armed Forces Induction Cen
ter. He served five days in Santa Rita prison, the Alameda County
Rehabilitation Center, and was released Saturday. The Daily asked
Mr. Pugh why he decided to sit-in at the induction center. He re
plied with this article.)
I was a freshman last spring. It was spring when I finally read
Bernard Fall, and Dave Harris came to Wilbur with his slides ana
his shoulders hunched over his knees.
And for a vibratingly live dead week, I cried and punched out
these words for Michael Novak and myself:
"I am scared that a decision not to hand in my draft card will
prevent me from living an honest life and will make the changes
I want to make in society shrink away in comparison with the
enormity of my sin. I fear that I may become insensitive and gain
the power but lose the capacity to make honest decisions.
"Conversely, I am scared that a decision to hand in my draft
card will render me ineffectual in the society I want so desperately
to change. And the more I learn what life is, the more I love it.
Can I face prison for five years? ....
"My attitude towards killing does not help me make my decision
on the draft, but it does illustrate my confusion about myself and
the world. It is very possible that killing will continue until people
just refuse to kill other people.
"But it is also possible that a responsible use of force will best
lead to a peaceful world. If I were to accept that responsibility, I
couldn't say that the ends wouldn't justify the means, for if the
ends wouldn't, what would?"
Abstraction
After five days in jail, five years is still an abstract threat and
my draft card still rests alongside my University meal card.
Over the summer I discovered that enough of the present me had
been propelled into the future by parents, schooling, and the past
me so that I could not take an action that a new and growing part
of me demanded.
I decided that I could not join an organization that would take
any part of my responsibility to decide if I would take another
human being's life, yet I couldn't lay down five years of my life
to fight that organization.
In the muddled first three weeks of sophomore Stanford I drifted
to the conclusion that I could better spend my time by reading
about the American power structure and pacifism than by march
ing in the streets.
I felt that the war would just have to burn itself out, that ra
tional men would finally get a hearing, and that I might entrust
to myself the job of laying the theoretical foundations for a vol
unteer army and for a post-negotiations economic development
plan for Southeast Asia.
After all, any intelligent liberal knows that the problem in Asia
is not Communism but poverty.
Reality
STOP.
The roar of a B-52 shook my book. Human beings are killing
each other in Vietnam. Some press buttons, but the books cannot
be read right now.
STOP was last Sunday afternoon. The projectile of my guilt
blew away the ectodermic shell I had slowly secreted.
The decision to hand in my draft card had spawned a sterile sis
ter, a grotesque double of the honest search I'd gone through last
spring. I decided I couldn't face five years in jail last spring; by
Sunday I couldn't go to jail for any reason.

Sunday, I feel they were so strange and wonderful that they prob
ably make little sense to others. And so it may be.
It would be easy to write about jail, that funny jail that was so
much like summer camp except sirens had replaced bugles and
single file has replaced the buddy system. But descriptions of Santa
Rita will not help us grasp that life not only requires decision, but
is decision.
Pictures of fleshy decadent cops will not help us grapple with
the coming debate over the future place of violence in a peace
movement.
My Monday was very beautiful and peaceful. I hope we can learn
from our past decisions, for we have many more to make.
(Editor's note: The writer was arrested during last weeks anti
draft demonstrations at the Oakland Armed Forces Induction Cen
ter. He served five days in Santa Rita prison, the Alameda County
Rehabilitation Center, and was released Saturday. The Daily asked
Mr. Pugh why he decided to sit-in at the induction center. He re
plied with this article.)
I was a freshman last spring. It was spring when I finally read
Bernard Fall, and Dave Harris came to Wilbur with his slides ana
his shoulders hunched over his knees.
And for a vibratingly live dead week, I cried and punched out
these words for Michael Novak and myself:
"I am scared that a decision not to hand in my draft card will
prevent me from living an honest life and will make the changes
I want to make in society shrink away in comparison with the
enormity of my sin. I fear that I may become insensitive and gain
the power but lose the capacity to make honest decisions.
"Conversely, I am scared that a decision to hand in my draft
card will render me ineffectual in the society I want so desperately
to change. And the more I learn what life is, the more I love it.
Can I face prison for five years? ....
"My attitude towards killing does not help me make my decision
on the draft, but it does illustrate my confusion about myself and
the world. It is very possible that killing will continue until people
just refuse to kill other people.
"But it is also possible that a responsible use of force will best
lead to a peaceful world. If I were to accept that responsibility, I
couldn't say that the ends wouldn't justify the means, for if the
ends wouldn't, what would?"
Abstraction
After five days in jail, five years is still an abstract threat and
my draft card still rests alongside my University meal card.
Over the summer I discovered that enough of the present me had
been propelled into the future by parents, schooling, and the past
me so that I could not take an action that a new and growing part
of me demanded.
I decided that I could not join an organization that would take
any part of my responsibility to decide if I would take another
human being's life, yet I couldn't lay down five years of my life
to fight that organization.
In the muddled first three weeks of sophomore Stanford I drifted
to the conclusion that I could better spend my time by reading
about the American power structure and pacifism than by march
ing in the streets.
I felt that the war would just have to burn itself out, that ra
tional men would finally get a hearing, and that I might entrust
to myself the job of laying the theoretical foundations for a vol
unteer army and for a post-negotiations economic development
plan for Southeast Asia.
After all, any intelligent liberal knows that the problem in Asia
is not Communism but poverty.
Reality
STOP.
The roar of a B-52 shook my book. Human beings are killing
each other in Vietnam. Some press buttons, but the books cannot
be read right now.
STOP was last Sunday afternoon. The projectile of my guilt
blew away the ectodermic shell I had slowly secreted.
The decision to hand in my draft card had spawned a sterile sis
ter, a grotesque double of the honest search I'd gone through last
spring. I decided I couldn't face five years in jail last spring; by
Sunday I couldn't go to jail for any reason.
It might help to explain what happened at the Stop the Draft
Week planning meeting two Thursday nights ago. John Shippee
took the rostrum first to explain that on Monday a group of people
were planning to lie down in front of the doors of the Oakland
induction center.
They wanted to make it clear to the inductees and the public

that they would have to step on other human beings in order to
enter the United States Armed Forces.
John asked us to come Monday only if we were committed to
non-violence and if we were ready to go to jail. Polite applause.
Tuesday, Tuesday
The Tuesday people proceeded to take over the meeting.
A leader of the Resistance warned us that the Tuesday cops
might start busting heads and suggested that we might take picket
signs in case we wanted to protect or defend ourselves.
There was an air of mock seriousness and celebration about the
rest of that meeting that helped me to stop thinking and feeling
about the coming week. I made a mental note to be sure to drive
up either Monday or Tuesday to see what might happen.
I had lost sight of the values that would integrate my life with
the world and people around me.
One definition of the mature man is that he understands how
his personal problems extend into the social reality and conversely
that he understands how the social milieu impinges upon his per
son. In the sense of being able to respond, responsibility can
emerge only from the dialectical crossfire of this process.
I now saw that I didn't have to submit a twenty-page paper on
the political and military consequences of a volunteer army in or
der to go to jail to oppose the draft.
I had to act against the draft before I could expect the American
public to consider alternatives to the draft.
I had to act to stop the killing.
I had to act to show the state that it could not channel my con
science into the production of academic drivel.
I had to make a leap of affirmation, a leap at the point where
reason fails, where conscience turns into conscientiousness and
where courage comes or does not come.
Like The South
It helped me to draw a mental parallel between Monday's planned
non-violent demonstration and the civil rights sit-ins and marches
in the South. I began to understand that law can never be treated
as anything but an approximation to justice.
If it widens the ever-present gap between law and justice, the
consequences of obedience can be more harmful than the conse
quences of disobedience. When a man who campaigned in 1964 on
a pledge not to fight a war has been fighting it for three years
since, one cannot wait until November 1968 to cast one's vote.
If all other means have failed, a man has the right and the duty
to publicly disobey the law and openly accept the consequences of
that action. An act of non-violent civil disobedience strengthens
the concept of law as justice by challenging a particular unjust
law.
It's rather cheeky of me to group myself with Socrates, Jesus,
Thomas Jefferson, and Dr. King, so I'll just say it's cheeky of me
to do so ...
And I sat thinking Sunday afternoon how I would answer charges
of anarchy.
Realization
On Sunday afternoon I understood that I couldn't honestly main
tain my commitment to radical change, which I had been fond of
speaking of, at a junction where effective political action was pos
sible and where the risk to my future plans was minimal. And that
risk had lost its element of fear, for I would be making my future
the next day.
As I write about the decisions I made from last spring to last
Sunday, I feel they were so strange and wonderful that they prob
ably make little sense to others. And so it may be.

The roar of a B-52 shook my book. Human beings are killing
each other in Vietnam. Some press buttons, but the books cannot
be read right now.
STOP was last Sunday afternoon. The projectile of my guilt
blew away the ectodermic shell I had slowly secreted.
The decision to hand in my draft card had spawned a sterile sis
ter, a grotesque double of the honest search I'd gone through last
spring. I decided I couldn't face five years in jail last spring; by
Sunday I couldn't go to jail for any reason.
It might help to explain what happened at the Stop the Draft
Week planning meeting two Thursday nights ago. John Shippee
took the rostrum first to explain that on Monday a group of people
were planning to lie down in front of the doors of the Oakland
induction center.
They wanted to make it clear to the inductees and the public

that they would have to step on other human beings in order to
enter the United States Armed Forces.
John asked us to come Monday only if we were committed to
non-violence and if we were ready to go to jail. Polite applause.
Tuesday, Tuesday
The Tuesday people proceeded to take over the meeting.
A leader of the Resistance warned us that the Tuesday cops
might start busting heads and suggested that we might take picket
signs in case we wanted to protect or defend ourselves.
There was an air of mock seriousness and celebration about the
rest of that meeting that helped me to stop thinking and feeling
about the coming week. I made a mental note to be sure to drive
up either Monday or Tuesday to see what might happen.
I had lost sight of the values that would integrate my life with
the world and people around me.
One definition of the mature man is that he understands how
his personal problems extend into the social reality and conversely
that he understands how the social milieu impinges upon his per
son. In the sense of being able to respond, responsibility can
emerge only from the dialectical crossfire of this process.
I now saw that I didn't have to submit a twenty-page paper on
the political and military consequences of a volunteer army in or
der to go to jail to oppose the draft.
I had to act against the draft before I could expect the American
public to consider alternatives to the draft.
I had to act to stop the killing.
I had to act to show the state that it could not channel my con
science into the production of academic drivel.
I had to make a leap of affirmation, a leap at the point where
reason fails, where conscience turns into conscientiousness and
where courage comes or does not come.
Like The South
It helped me to draw a mental parallel between Monday's planned
non-violent demonstration and the civil rights sit-ins and marches
in the South. I began to understand that law can never be treated
as anything but an approximation to justice.
If it widens the ever-present gap between law and justice, the
consequences of obedience can be more harmful than the conse
quences of disobedience. When a man who campaigned in 1964 on
a pledge not to fight a war has been fighting it for three years
since, one cannot wait until November 1968 to cast one's vote.
If all other means have failed, a man has the right and the duty
to publicly disobey the law and openly accept the consequences of
that action. An act of non-violent civil disobedience strengthens
the concept of law as justice by challenging a particular unjust
law.
It's rather cheeky of me to group myself with Socrates, Jesus,
Thomas Jefferson, and Dr. King, so I'll just say it's cheeky of me
to do so ...
And I sat thinking Sunday afternoon how I would answer charges
of anarchy.
Realization
On Sunday afternoon I understood that I couldn't honestly main
tain my commitment to radical change, which I had been fond of
speaking of, at a junction where effective political action was pos
sible and where the risk to my future plans was minimal. And that
risk had lost its element of fear, for I would be making my future
the next day.
As I write about the decisions I made from last spring to last
Sunday, I feel they were so strange and wonderful that they prob
ably make little sense to others. And so it may be.
It would be easy to write about jail, that funny jail that was so
much like summer camp except sirens had replaced bugles and
single file has replaced the buddy system. But descriptions of Santa
Rita will not help us grasp that life not only requires decision, but
is decision.
Pictures of fleshy decadent cops will not help us grapple with
the coming debate over the future place of violence in a peace
movement.
My Monday was very beautiful and peaceful. I hope we can learn
from our past decisions, for we have many more to make.

draft demonstrations at the Oakland Armed Forces Induction Cen
ter. He served five days in Santa Rita prison, the Alameda County
Rehabilitation Center, and was released Saturday. The Daily asked
Mr. Pugh why he decided to sit-in at the induction center. He re
plied with this article.)
I was a freshman last spring. It was spring when I finally read
Bernard Fall, and Dave Harris came to Wilbur with his slides ana
his shoulders hunched over his knees.
And for a vibratingly live dead week, I cried and punched out
these words for Michael Novak and myself:
"I am scared that a decision not to hand in my draft card will
prevent me from living an honest life and will make the changes
I want to make in society shrink away in comparison with the
enormity of my sin. I fear that I may become insensitive and gain
the power but lose the capacity to make honest decisions.
"Conversely, I am scared that a decision to hand in my draft
card will render me ineffectual in the society I want so desperately
to change. And the more I learn what life is, the more I love it.
Can I face prison for five years? ....
"My attitude towards killing does not help me make my decision
on the draft, but it does illustrate my confusion about myself and
the world. It is very possible that killing will continue until people
just refuse to kill other people.
"But it is also possible that a responsible use of force will best
lead to a peaceful world. If I were to accept that responsibility, I
couldn't say that the ends wouldn't justify the means, for if the
ends wouldn't, what would?"
Abstraction
After five days in jail, five years is still an abstract threat and
my draft card still rests alongside my University meal card.
Over the summer I discovered that enough of the present me had
been propelled into the future by parents, schooling, and the past
me so that I could not take an action that a new and growing part
of me demanded.
I decided that I could not join an organization that would take
any part of my responsibility to decide if I would take another
human being's life, yet I couldn't lay down five years of my life
to fight that organization.
In the muddled first three weeks of sophomore Stanford I drifted
to the conclusion that I could better spend my time by reading
about the American power structure and pacifism than by march
ing in the streets.
I felt that the war would just have to burn itself out, that ra
tional men would finally get a hearing, and that I might entrust
to myself the job of laying the theoretical foundations for a vol
unteer army and for a post-negotiations economic development
plan for Southeast Asia.
After all, any intelligent liberal knows that the problem in Asia
is not Communism but poverty.
