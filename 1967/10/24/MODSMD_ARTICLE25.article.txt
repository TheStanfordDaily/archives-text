# Congressman Attacks SDS On Campus
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS)—One
United States Congressman
thinks the Federal Government
should deny funds to any col
lege or university which per
mits Students for a Democratic
Society to have an organized
chapter on their campus.
"SDS has been infiltrated by
Communists, and therefore I
think all colleges throughout
the United States should ban
SDS from their campuses," says
Rep. Joe Pool, (D-Tex.).
Pool says he is opposed to
SDS because its members are
"trying to destroy our national
security by getting rid of the
draft — they are sabotaging our
war effort."
Pool said any college which
has such activity on its campus

should not receive the "taxpay
ers' money. We should not use
funds to pay for draft resis
tance."
Avoid Draft
SDS members are "informing
our young people of both legal
and illegal ways to avoid the
draft," the Congressman said.
"I believe in freedom of
speech and freedom of the press
and all other principles in the
First Amendment," Pool said.
"But you have to draw the line
when an organized group actu
ally tries to destroy the very
strength of our armed might,
the draft."
The Congressman said if SDS
members "are teaching people
to violate the law and to engage
in illegal acts, it is not a viola

tion of the First Amendment to
stop them. They have exceeded
their rights to freedom of
speech and the press. These peo
ple are getting close to advocat
ing the overthrow of the gov
ernment when they do this."
Treason
Pool said the acts of SDS mem
bers "would be treason if we
were in a declared war. The fact
that we are in an undeclared
war does not change the situa
tion in my mind."
Asked if SDS is the only or
ganization colleges should ban
from their campuses, Pool said,
"I don't think colleges should
recognize such organizations
as the Klu Klux Klan, the Amer
ican Nazi Party, or the Commu
nist Party either."

Pool, a member of the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities (HUAC), said he is cur
rently investigating SDS, but he
has not decided if he will intro
duce legislation in Congress con
cerning the student organiza
tion.
However, he strongly believes
Congress should stop giving Fed
eral money to colleges which
have SDS chapters. "Why should
Congress furnish money to any
organization or institution that
is fostering disloyal and unpa
triotic acts against the United
States?" Pool asked. He said
college administrations, by mere
ly permitting SDS on their cam
puses, are showing their appro
val and in a small way promot
ing the goals of the organiaztion.

"I don't think colleges should
recognize such organizations
as the Klu Klux Klan, the Amer
ican Nazi Party, or the Commu
nist Party either."

Pool, a member of the House
Committee on Un-American Ac
tivities (HUAC), said he is cur
rently investigating SDS, but he
has not decided if he will intro
duce legislation in Congress con
cerning the student organiza
tion.
However, he strongly believes
Congress should stop giving Fed
eral money to colleges which
have SDS chapters. "Why should
Congress furnish money to any
organization or institution that
is fostering disloyal and unpa
triotic acts against the United
States?" Pool asked. He said
college administrations, by mere
ly permitting SDS on their cam
puses, are showing their appro
val and in a small way promot
ing the goals of the organiaztion.
WASHINGTON (CPS)—One
United States Congressman
thinks the Federal Government
should deny funds to any col
lege or university which per
mits Students for a Democratic
Society to have an organized
chapter on their campus.
"SDS has been infiltrated by
Communists, and therefore I
think all colleges throughout
the United States should ban
SDS from their campuses," says
Rep. Joe Pool, (D-Tex.).
Pool says he is opposed to
SDS because its members are
"trying to destroy our national
security by getting rid of the
draft — they are sabotaging our
war effort."
Pool said any college which
has such activity on its campus

should not receive the "taxpay
ers' money. We should not use
funds to pay for draft resis
tance."
Avoid Draft
SDS members are "informing
our young people of both legal
and illegal ways to avoid the
draft," the Congressman said.
"I believe in freedom of
speech and freedom of the press
and all other principles in the
First Amendment," Pool said.
"But you have to draw the line
when an organized group actu
ally tries to destroy the very
strength of our armed might,
the draft."
The Congressman said if SDS
members "are teaching people
to violate the law and to engage
in illegal acts, it is not a viola

tion of the First Amendment to
stop them. They have exceeded
their rights to freedom of
speech and the press. These peo
ple are getting close to advocat
ing the overthrow of the gov
ernment when they do this."
Treason
Pool said the acts of SDS mem
bers "would be treason if we
were in a declared war. The fact
that we are in an undeclared
war does not change the situa
tion in my mind."
Asked if SDS is the only or
ganization colleges should ban
from their campuses, Pool said,
"I don't think colleges should
recognize such organizations
as the Klu Klux Klan, the Amer
ican Nazi Party, or the Commu
nist Party either."
