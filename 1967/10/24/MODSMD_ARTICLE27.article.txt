# Washington Nears PAC-8 Position As Top Receiver
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford's football team
started the season with a run
ning attack of unquestioned
authority, but its passing game
was a major problem for Coach
John Ralston.
After three games, the In
dians had rushed for 710 yeards,
but had only passed for 177
yards in compiling a 2-1 record.
However, in the last two
games against Waishington
State and UCLA, the Cards have
moved through the air for 135
yards and 221 yards respect
ively. UCLA's pass defense had
previously been allowing only
127 yards a game.
Gene Lights Spark
One of the major reasons for
this change in the potency of the
Indian aerial attack has been
the return to action oi' Gene
Washington, a fleet junior who
changed from quarterback to
flanker this year.
In last week's game, Wash
ington had the best day of any
PAC-8 receiver to date, pulling
in nine passes good for 99 yards.
The performance made hi m the
second leading receiver in the
conference with 24 grabs.
Is He The Best?
He is now only one catch and
three yards short of the leading
receiver, Wayne Stewart of Cal.
Because Washington missed two
games with an ankle injury,
many Stanford partisans feel
Washington is the top receiver
of the two.
Washington's reputation has
grown with every game. UCLA
decided not to change its tradi

ditional double coverage of the
flanker when it saw Washing
ton's five catch performances
against both Washington State
and Oregon State, who covered
him man-to-man.
Washington thanks Ralston
for making the change. He says
he feels more assured at flanker
than at quarterback, and that
"not having the responsibility
for calling the plays allows me
to enjoy the game more."
Chuck Helps Out
Obviously, Washington is not
the sole reason for the Indians
new-found success in the air.
Chuck Williams came off the
bench in the Washington State
game and has put on two bril
liant aerial displays.
"Chuck throws the ball well
both long and short," says
Washington, "I'm confident the
ball will get to me when I'm
open. He may be the best passer
on the Pacific coast."
Washington claims he has
never been timed in the hun
dred, but does the 40 yard dash
in 4.4 seconds. His speed makes
him a definite long bomb threat.
He says his favorite pattern is
a post pattern on which he goes
downfield then cuts toward the
goalpost.
He says that on a third down
and eight or nine yards to go
situation he will never break the
pattern called for in the huddle.
But on a second and one situa
tion, he is free to work himself
open almost anyway he can.
"If the play calls for a curl
pattern and the defensive back
comes up, then I can go long
or vice-versa," he explains.
Campus Understands
Washington spends about 35
hours a week in activities con
nected with football. This in
cludes a 12 hour period before
and during the game.
And although he says Stan
ford is certainly not an athletics
oriented campus, he feels most
students and professors under
stand the position of the ath
lete. "If we were winning more,
I'm sure they'd all be out there

at the games, and I can under
stand that."
Washington, a junior history
major, feels that there is a new
breath of confidence on the
team. "Spirit and confidence go
together," he says,"and we feel
sure we can move the ball now."
The change from quarterback
to flanker came only four days
before the first game of the
season. Ralston felt Washington
would help the team more there.
It was quite a change for
Washington, who had not played
anything but quarterback since
his days at Long Beach High in
Southern California.
Now Washington has only one
play where he throws the ball.
He takes a handoff from Nate
Kirtman as if on a reverse, and
then has an option to either
throw or run. The only time he
has thrown the ball on the play,
the pass fell incomplete.
But with all his success at
flanker, Washington no longer
has any desire to throw the ball.


BELLY FLOP?: It may not look like the best diving form, but Stan
ford flanker Gene Washington is doing his best to reach a pass
from Chuck Williams, Indian quarterback. Covering on the play
for the UCLA Bruins is safety Sandy Green. Washington caught
nine passes for 99 yards In the Cards' 21-16 loss Saturday.
