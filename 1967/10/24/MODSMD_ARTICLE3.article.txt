## 
### 
The Cat struck again at the
main library.
Employees discovered Friday
morning an eight-foot square
banner suspended near the ceil
ing of the rotunda, 25 feet above
the floor. The banner showed a
large black cat looking over its
shoulder.
The Bender room upstairs
was also entered, and another
cat banner placed in from the
door. The visitor's register was
signed "The Cat."
A picture of a cat was drawn
in felt pen on the window of
library director Rutherford
Rogers' office.
Roger said a similar cat ban
ner was hung in the rotunda
one year ago.
A lock will be installed in the
Bender room to forestall anoth
er visit by The Cat.
"It was probably done by a
climber," he said, opinting out
that the cat banner in the ro
tunda was hung by cords well
off the ground.
Rogers thinks The Cat may
have "secreted himself in the
building" past closing time, and
then gone to work. "It's per
fectly possible for a person to
stay in the building," Rogers
said. "We find it difficult to
search over 2000 square feet of
space every night."
The Cat may also have en
tered from a second story win
dow.
