# Controversy Develops Over Kefs' Actions In Bruin Game
## 
### 
A controversy over the quality
of the officiating during the
Stanford-UCLA game developed
Monday after Bruin coach Tom
my Prothro criticized the con
duct of the referees.
Prothro told a Los Angeles
Sports Writers Association
luncheon yesterday,"The play
ers kept their poise but the
adults didn't." He explained that
he meant officials for adults.
"The officials panicked," he
said referring to their conduct
during Stanford's last drive at
tempting to win the game.
He said they allowed play to
continue before the yardage
chains had been set up and that

the headlinesman had his back
turned on the action.
Stanford football coach John

Ralston, and Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor had no comment
on Prothro's remarks. AAWU
Publicity Director Bob Spren
ger also had no comment, but
added that the AAWU would
soon receive confidential reports
from Prothro and Ralston.
Prothro's criticism came as a
surprise because his team won
the game 21-16. Many Stanford
fans also felt UCLA should have
been penalized for pass interfer
ence on the last play when split
end Bill Shoemaker fell in the
end zone trying for a despera
tion pass from Chuck Williams.
