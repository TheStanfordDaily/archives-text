# Frats Consider Meal Tickets
## 
### 
The Inner Fraternity Council
is currently considering using
meal tickets in places other than
the residence houses. At the
present time, the meal tickets
may be used in residences, but
they may not be interchanged
among the fraternity houses.
IFC President Mike Quinn
hopes to devise a system which
would enable fraternities to host
a limited number of guests on
a weekly or monthly basis. Ac
cording to Quinn, some of the
new fraternity clusters will be
unable to afford the new pro
gram unless they are given mon
etary aid. "Some of the finan
cial burden must be assumed
by the IFC," says Quinn.
