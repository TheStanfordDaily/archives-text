### LETA ZUCKERMAN 
A near capacity audience filled
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Sun
day to hear Mssrs. Jean-Pierre
Rampal, flute, and Robert Vey
ron-Lacroiz, harpsichord and pi
ano. The presentation was the

first in the Stanford Music De
partment's 1967-68 Subscription
Series.
Rampal, considered on of the
world's masters, demonstrated
agility and tonal quality in his
performance of three Baroque
works and two modern pieces.
In fact, the program was a bit
too heavy in its leanings toward
Baroque. However, this was a
reflection of both performers'
specialities in that period.
Instrumental Contrast
The program opened with
Handel's Sonata in A minor, fol
lowed by Johann Christian
Bach's Sonata in F major and
Johann Sebastian Bach's Sonata
S 1030 in B minor. M. Rampal's
mellow and warm tone provided
a beautiful contrast to the cool
precise timbre of the harpsi
chord.
The difference was especially
apparent in the slow move
ments. The fast, clean, crisp
staccatos in the J. C. Bach Sona
ta provided a distinct variation
to his wide pulsating vibrato in
the lower portions.
Tension Emphasized
After the concert Rampal
himself emphasized the tension
built in the first movement of
this Bach Sonata by the continu
ously rising smooth chromatic
line. The last two movements
stressed rhythmic precision. M.
Veyron-Lacroix's technical abil
ity and legerity reinforced Pam
pal's staccato.
The second half of the pro
gram featured Albert Roussel's
"Joueurs de flOte" a suite of

four sections, and Bohuslav Mar
tinu's Sonata, a piece of amaz
ing complexity and technical
challenge.
The duo was called back for
two encores, the first a gentle
Bach Siciliano and the second
a modern Scherzo, a tour de
force movement from a diverti
mento by Jean Francais.
The subscription series will
feature later this year the Early
Music Quartet from Munich
(February and March), the Loe
wenguth Quartet from France
(March) and the Cappella Col
oniensis (two performances in
May).
