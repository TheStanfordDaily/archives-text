# Jail Rebuffs Napier's Visit
## 
### 
B. Davie Napier travelled in
vain to Santa Rita prison yester
day. He was denied admittance
and the material he brought for
the Stanford students and fac
ulty members was not accepted
for delivery.
Napier reported that he was
denied entrance by both the pri
son superintendent and the pri
son chaplain. Napier noted that
the total non-cooperation seem
ed to stem from the Chaplain's
apparent fear of the prison ad
ministration.
Napier had brought a pack
age of undershirts for Dr. Had
ley Kirkman, copies of the Daily,
and a copy of the Sunday New
York Times.
Prison authorities did take a
letter directed to one of the stu
dents. Napier pointed out that
Monday was not a regular visit
ing day, but he had assumed a
clergyman would be allowed
entrance anyway.
