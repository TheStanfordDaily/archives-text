# Debaters Triumph In Oregon Tourney
## 
### 
Stanford debators triumphed
over teams from 25 other
schools to place second in sweep
stakes competition at the Lewis
a"nd Clark College Invitational
Tournament last weekend in
Portland, Oregon.
Two of the three Stanford
teams, Diana Deverell and Mimi
Ritter in junior women's and
Ron Elving and Ross Laybourne
in junior men's, won undefeated
firsts in their divisions. The
senior men's team, Howie Ar
nett and John Bergholt, took
second, losing only to the Uni
versity of Oregon in the final
round.
"What is so astonishing," said
Kenneth E. Mosier, Director of
Forensics, "is that we won on
debate points alone. We didn't
enter any of the individual
Speech events, which also
count toward the sweepstakes
awards."
At the local Foothill Tourna
ment, also held last weekend,
Stanford had three undefeated
teams: Bill Bryson and Steve

Tipps, Ted Primm and Sibby
Freeman, and John Page and
Ken Young.
"This is one of the finest show
ings by a group of debaters
that I can remember," said Mos
ier.
Mosier pointed out that this
year's speech squad is the larg
est in Stanford's history—lso
active members—and comprises
one of the five largest debate
programs in the nation. "We
encourage everyone to debate,
even if they haven't had exper
ience," he said. "Our philosophy
is to let as many people debate
as possible, whether they win
or not. For example, we sent
about twelve teams to the Foot
hill Tournament."
Besides entering league tour
naments, Stanford has been in
vited to give several demonstra
tion debates this quarter. The
first will be a televised debate
next Wednesday for the state
of Kansas against an eastern
school, probably Harvard. On
December 2 a Stanford team
will debate Duke University at
Albequerque, New Mexico, in
an exhibition match. Stanford
will also represent the West in
an East-West contest with
Princeton at the National Speech
Association's convention in Los
Angeles on December 27. This is
the first time Stanford has de
bated at the national convention.
Upcoming tournaments include
the Loyola Tournament, the Uni
versity of Oregon Tournament,
the Emory Tournament, and the
Air Force Academy Tourna
ment.

Ken Young.
"This is one of the finest show
ings by a group of debaters
that I can remember," said Mos
ier.
Mosier pointed out that this
year's speech squad is the larg
est in Stanford's history—lso
active members—and comprises
one of the five largest debate
programs in the nation. "We
encourage everyone to debate,
even if they haven't had exper
ience," he said. "Our philosophy
is to let as many people debate
as possible, whether they win
or not. For example, we sent
about twelve teams to the Foot
hill Tournament."
Besides entering league tour
naments, Stanford has been in
vited to give several demonstra
tion debates this quarter. The
first will be a televised debate
next Wednesday for the state
of Kansas against an eastern
school, probably Harvard. On
December 2 a Stanford team
will debate Duke University at
Albequerque, New Mexico, in
an exhibition match. Stanford
will also represent the West in
an East-West contest with
Princeton at the National Speech
Association's convention in Los
Angeles on December 27. This is
the first time Stanford has de
bated at the national convention.
Upcoming tournaments include
the Loyola Tournament, the Uni
versity of Oregon Tournament,
the Emory Tournament, and the
Air Force Academy Tourna
ment.
Stanford debators triumphed
over teams from 25 other
schools to place second in sweep
stakes competition at the Lewis
a"nd Clark College Invitational
Tournament last weekend in
Portland, Oregon.
Two of the three Stanford
teams, Diana Deverell and Mimi
Ritter in junior women's and
Ron Elving and Ross Laybourne
in junior men's, won undefeated
firsts in their divisions. The
senior men's team, Howie Ar
nett and John Bergholt, took
second, losing only to the Uni
versity of Oregon in the final
round.
"What is so astonishing," said
Kenneth E. Mosier, Director of
Forensics, "is that we won on
debate points alone. We didn't
enter any of the individual
Speech events, which also
count toward the sweepstakes
awards."
At the local Foothill Tourna
ment, also held last weekend,
Stanford had three undefeated
teams: Bill Bryson and Steve

Tipps, Ted Primm and Sibby
Freeman, and John Page and
Ken Young.
