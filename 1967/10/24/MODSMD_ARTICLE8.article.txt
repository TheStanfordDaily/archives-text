# Labov Links Class To 'R' Sound Usage
## 
### 
Professor William Labov of
Columbia University analysed
the correlation between pro
nuciation, socio-economic
classes, and as he discussed "lin
guistic behavior as a form of
human social behavior."
He was able to formalize his
research done in New York
City's Lower East Side into "sin
gle, simple rules."
The major problem Labov
faced was to make people less
"self-conscious. The question
that produced the most casual
response in his survey was
"Have you ever been in danger
of dying?"
Labov's research was concen
trated on the lower class, the
working class, the lower middle
class and the upper middle class.
His data did not include the
upper class because "there are
none" on the Lower East Side.
The pronounciation to words
with "r" depends on the social
class. The lower and upper mid
dle classes show the least shift
in pronounciation between cas
ual speech and reading lists.
They have a "reference group
internal to their won social
group."

The middle classes, however,
try to imitate the prestigious
upper middle class and try to
change. They have an external
reference point. Labov remark
ed that "the more insecure a
person feels about speech, the
more he will change." He said
that the working class "can't
even read the word 'vase' with
out getting upset."
"They say one thing but ad
mit they think the other pro
nunciation is correct."
Age also affects the use of
« r » "The younger you are, the
more 'r' you use" with the up
per middle classes. The opposite
is true for the lower classes.
Using three department stores,
Sak's, Macy's and Kleins, Labov
showed that "if you take any
social group that has social stra
tification, it will have "r" strati
fication." The personnel of three
different class stores all spoke
differently.
Although relationships be
tween social factors and linguis
tics are "hard to bring to the
surface," Labov admitted, they
do help analyze society and the
changes that take place in it.
