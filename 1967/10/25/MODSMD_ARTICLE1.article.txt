# White Plaza Rally
## Anti-Draft Supporters Plan Oakland Caravan 
### SUE NEIL 
Speakers at yesterday's Anti-
Draft rally in White Plaza out
lined plans for meeting student
and faculty t;;-inmates of the
Alameda County jail in Santa
Rita.
A car caravan will leave the
Unitarian Church, Charleston
St., Palo Alto at 8 a.m., Thursday
to pick up the released partici
pants of last week's anti-draft
activities. The caravan will take
the students and faculty to Oak
land for a 2 p.m. press confer
ence at a location yet to be an
nounced.
John Shippee, a political sci
ence graduate student, announc
ed the caravan plans and told
the crowd that the jail sentences
were effective in creating lead
ers dedicated to a "non-violent
revolution of resistance, not just
protest."
More Participants Speak
Other participants in the Oak
land demonstrations also spoke.
Bruce Franklin, an associate pro
cessor of English, asserted that
the demonstrations in Oakland
Friday and in Chicago Satur
day changed the direction of
the anti-draft, anti-war move
ment, putting it more directly in
conflict with "state power and
the interest it represents."
He said that it is too late to
bury ideological issues under
tactical ones, since a major
change in the governmental sys
tem is necessary.
Franklin believes that in some
segments of society, especially
among Negroes and the lower

classes, there are many people
who can identify witlf this move
ment. He said that this is evi
denced, in ever-widening circles,
by more argument about the fea
sibility of a revolution than
about its desirability.
Charged With Felony
Bruce Landesman, professor
of philosophy, and Chris Chase-
Dunn, a sociology graduate stu
dent, told of their arrests and
the charges made against them.
Chase-Dunn was charged with
assaulting an officer, a felony,
but this was later reduced to a
misdemeanor charge.
Landesman claimed that he
had been standing behind lines
of police who were clearing the
streets when something, later
identified as a garbage can lid,
fell into the group of police. Two
minutes later, as he was watch
ing to see what had happened,
he was arrested and charged
with assault with a deadly wea
pon.
Leonard Siegel, the chairman
of the Anti-Draft Union, an
nounced plans for future acti
vities, including recirculation of

the "We Won't Go" statement
which was signed by 315 per
sons last year, and distribution
of leaflets to servicemen coming
through the San Francisco air
port, inductees coming to the
Oakland Induction Center, and
employment centers, theaters,
and other places in Fremont.
Return To Non-Violence
Tim Haight, a communications
graduate student opposed some
of the other speakers and noted
that the slogan "Fight for Peace"
is a contradiction whether it re
fers to Vietnam or Oakland. He
called for a return to the earlier
non-violent sit-in tactics, and
said that turning in draft cards
is more effective, though more
difficult, than a violent demon
stration.
Haight also warned against
"romanticizing" the Negroes and
the poor and believing the idea
of broad support for the move
ment among the lower closses.
Mary Hanson, a senior in so
cial thought, and Dave Pugh, a
sophomore Phi Psi, both of
whom served a 5-day jail sen
tence last week, also spoke.

St., Palo Alto at 8 a.m., Thursday
to pick up the released partici
pants of last week's anti-draft
activities. The caravan will take
the students and faculty to Oak
land for a 2 p.m. press confer
ence at a location yet to be an
nounced.
John Shippee, a political sci
ence graduate student, announc
ed the caravan plans and told
the crowd that the jail sentences
were effective in creating lead
ers dedicated to a "non-violent
revolution of resistance, not just
protest."
More Participants Speak
Other participants in the Oak
land demonstrations also spoke.
Bruce Franklin, an associate pro
cessor of English, asserted that
the demonstrations in Oakland
Friday and in Chicago Satur
day changed the direction of
the anti-draft, anti-war move
ment, putting it more directly in
conflict with "state power and
the interest it represents."
He said that it is too late to
bury ideological issues under
tactical ones, since a major
change in the governmental sys
tem is necessary.
Franklin believes that in some
segments of society, especially
among Negroes and the lower

classes, there are many people
who can identify witlf this move
ment. He said that this is evi
denced, in ever-widening circles,
by more argument about the fea
sibility of a revolution than
about its desirability.
Charged With Felony
Bruce Landesman, professor
of philosophy, and Chris Chase-
Dunn, a sociology graduate stu
dent, told of their arrests and
the charges made against them.
Chase-Dunn was charged with
assaulting an officer, a felony,
but this was later reduced to a
misdemeanor charge.
Landesman claimed that he
had been standing behind lines
of police who were clearing the
streets when something, later
identified as a garbage can lid,
fell into the group of police. Two
minutes later, as he was watch
ing to see what had happened,
he was arrested and charged
with assault with a deadly wea
pon.
Leonard Siegel, the chairman
of the Anti-Draft Union, an
nounced plans for future acti
vities, including recirculation of

the "We Won't Go" statement
which was signed by 315 per
sons last year, and distribution
of leaflets to servicemen coming
through the San Francisco air
port, inductees coming to the
Oakland Induction Center, and
employment centers, theaters,
and other places in Fremont.
Return To Non-Violence
Tim Haight, a communications
graduate student opposed some
of the other speakers and noted
that the slogan "Fight for Peace"
is a contradiction whether it re
fers to Vietnam or Oakland. He
called for a return to the earlier
non-violent sit-in tactics, and
said that turning in draft cards
is more effective, though more
difficult, than a violent demon
stration.
Haight also warned against
"romanticizing" the Negroes and
the poor and believing the idea
of broad support for the move
ment among the lower closses.
Mary Hanson, a senior in so
cial thought, and Dave Pugh, a
sophomore Phi Psi, both of
whom served a 5-day jail sen
tence last week, also spoke.
