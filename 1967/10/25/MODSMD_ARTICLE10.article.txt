# A Different Drummer
## 
### 
Michael Novak is one of those men who says
exactly what he thinks. And what he thinks often
differs from what the jaded generation expects
to hear from a college professor.
This fact is not sufficient, however, to explain
why Novak evokes so much respect and admir
ation from so many students. More than his hon
esty, it is his conscience and his profound belief
in every human's worth and dignity that draws
people to him like a magnet.
We wish Novak were not such an extraordin
ary person. We wish more were like him. And
it is with deepest regret that we must report
today that Novak is leaving Stanford next June.
lie is leaving not because he doesn't like Stan
ford or because Stanford doesn't like him but
because it isn't moving fast enough for him.
The new experimental New York state uni
versity at Old Westbury, Long Island, offers him
a greater challenge, greater excitement and wide
open spaces. Old Westbury is like having a
Study of Education without having the old in
hibiting established forms.
The new ideas shaping Old Westbury now
will, hopefully, be shaping Stanford also in the
next few vears. Novak believes they will, and we

tend to agree. But the innovations will be slower
and probably less radical here than there. And
Novak feels impelled to go where more exciting
things will be happening.
It would be idle to blame an institution, a uni
versity, for not being able to keep a man of No
vak's talent and dedication. There is something
in bold newness that inevitably attracts such
men.
Besides, Stanford the institution will not miss
him; he sometimes embarassed it with his frank
ness. It is rather the students—those who took
his courses and perhaps knew him personally—
who will miss him. And they will have gained
from the encounter in any case.
Novak is supremely human and that is what
makes him special.
It is an old trick of journalists to quote other
people when their descriptive powers fail them.
As our own words fail us now, we keep thinking
of Thoreau's:
If a man does not keep pace with his compan
ions, perhaps it is because he hears a different
dmmmer. Let him step to the music which he
hears, however measured or far away.
