## Idle Children In The House? Give Them A Martini Snack 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON — A govern
ment-sponsored study on alco
holism has just been released
and some of the recommenda
tions are bound to cause quite a
flurry in the United States.
The study said that it should
be a national policy to adapt
realistically to a predominantly
"drinking society." It is believed
that if you made alcoholic bev
erages available to children,
there would be less drinking
than if you repressed them.
Having lived in France for a
long time, I'm not sure the sug
gestions will produce the hoped
for results. Children in France
drink wine at a very early age,
and the French have one of the
largest alcoholism problems in
the world. I recall that in the
Calvados, where the best apple
brandy is made, the teachers
once protested because mothers
were giving their children a
shot of brandy in the morning
and the kids were staggering all
over the roads on their way to
school.
Even if the study is correct,
the big question is 'How do you
promote drinking in a family
setting?'
Teen Aged Martini
The scene is the home of the
Thompsons. It's 6 o'clock in the
evening. Mr. Thompson yells up

to his teenage son, "George, can
I make you a martini?"
"No thanks, Dad, I'd rather
have a glass of milk."
"Listen, you come down right
away and drink this martini or
you won't get any dinner."
"OK, but I still have a hang
over from the white wine Mom
packed in my lunch."
"One martini won't hurt you,
and besides, it will keep you
from becoming an alcoholic."
George comes downstairs, and
Mrs. Thompson comes out of
the kitchen.
Karen Thompson, their 14-
year-old daughter, enters and
says, "Hi, folks. What's for din
ner?"
Spiked Supper
Mrs. Thompson says, "I've
made a turtle soup with sherry,
a beef in Burgundy sauce, salad
with white wine dressing and
for dessert brandied cherries
and coffee served with whipped
cream and Irish whisky."
"Oh, boy," George says,"I
knew I should have done my
homework before dinner."
"That's enough of that," Mr.
Thompson says sternly. "Your
mother has been slaving over a
hot bar all day long, and the
least you can do is not make
wisecracks about her cooking."
Mrs. Thompson says, "Karen,
you didn't eat the orange in
your whisky sour."
"Mother, you know I hate
oranges."
"But how else are you going
to get your vitamins?"
"Where's Freddy?" Mr.
Thompson asks.
"He's up in bed. He passed
out from all those liqueur-filled
chocolates you brought home
last night."
"Serves him right for eating
between meals."
After dinner the family is
back in the living room. Mr.

Thompson and George are sing
ing "Sweet Adeline." Karen is
sitting on top of the piano, and
Mrs. Thompson is making da
quiris for everyone.
Freddy comes staggering
down the stairs. "I'm hungry."
"All right," Mrs. Thompson
says. "Help yourself to a cold
glass of beer in the icebox."

with white wine dressing and
for dessert brandied cherries
and coffee served with whipped
cream and Irish whisky."
"Oh, boy," George says,"I
knew I should have done my
homework before dinner."
"That's enough of that," Mr.
Thompson says sternly. "Your
mother has been slaving over a
hot bar all day long, and the
least you can do is not make
wisecracks about her cooking."
Mrs. Thompson says, "Karen,
you didn't eat the orange in
your whisky sour."
"Mother, you know I hate
oranges."
"But how else are you going
to get your vitamins?"
"Where's Freddy?" Mr.
Thompson asks.
"He's up in bed. He passed
out from all those liqueur-filled
chocolates you brought home
last night."
"Serves him right for eating
between meals."
After dinner the family is
back in the living room. Mr.

Thompson and George are sing
ing "Sweet Adeline." Karen is
sitting on top of the piano, and
Mrs. Thompson is making da
quiris for everyone.
Freddy comes staggering
down the stairs. "I'm hungry."
"All right," Mrs. Thompson
says. "Help yourself to a cold
glass of beer in the icebox."
WASHINGTON — A govern
ment-sponsored study on alco
holism has just been released
and some of the recommenda
tions are bound to cause quite a
flurry in the United States.
The study said that it should
be a national policy to adapt
realistically to a predominantly
"drinking society." It is believed
that if you made alcoholic bev
erages available to children,
there would be less drinking
than if you repressed them.
Having lived in France for a
long time, I'm not sure the sug
gestions will produce the hoped
for results. Children in France
drink wine at a very early age,
and the French have one of the
largest alcoholism problems in
the world. I recall that in the
Calvados, where the best apple
brandy is made, the teachers
once protested because mothers
were giving their children a
shot of brandy in the morning
and the kids were staggering all
over the roads on their way to
school.
Even if the study is correct,
the big question is 'How do you
promote drinking in a family
setting?'
Teen Aged Martini
The scene is the home of the
Thompsons. It's 6 o'clock in the
evening. Mr. Thompson yells up

to his teenage son, "George, can
I make you a martini?"
"No thanks, Dad, I'd rather
have a glass of milk."
"Listen, you come down right
away and drink this martini or
you won't get any dinner."
"OK, but I still have a hang
over from the white wine Mom
packed in my lunch."
"One martini won't hurt you,
and besides, it will keep you
from becoming an alcoholic."
George comes downstairs, and
Mrs. Thompson comes out of
the kitchen.
Karen Thompson, their 14-
year-old daughter, enters and
says, "Hi, folks. What's for din
ner?"
Spiked Supper
Mrs. Thompson says, "I've
made a turtle soup with sherry,
a beef in Burgundy sauce, salad
with white wine dressing and
for dessert brandied cherries
and coffee served with whipped
cream and Irish whisky."
"Oh, boy," George says,"I
knew I should have done my
homework before dinner."
