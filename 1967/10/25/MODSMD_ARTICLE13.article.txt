# The
						Outpost
## Another Approach Needed 
### Louis Knowles 
Last week's demonstrations in
Oakland were marred by seri
ous divisions among the theo
reticians of the left on strategy
and goals.
The conflict of the non-violent
faction and the militants is only
the most recent illustration of
the chronically fragmented
state of the left on American
campuses.
For a minority already so
small, it is catastrophic to suffer
this internal splintering, but the
prospects of any kind of united
front in the near future seem
very remote indeed.
The differences run deep be
cause they are based on widely
divergent analyses of the pres
ent American social condition.
The understanding that the sys
tem needs change, and the vis
ion of peace and economic jus
tice are held in common, but
any more specific statement be
gins to subdivide.
It is not the purpose of this
column to enumerate the vari
ety of ideas held by factions of
the university left or to discuss
the disastrous consequences
that will result from miscalcula
tions of the base for reformist
or revolutionary action.
Look At The University
But attention must be di
rected to the university com
munity that fosters this disillus
ioning factionalism.
Within white America the uni
versity is the only structure
that produces radical dissent.
What reformist fervor it does
generate can be traced in large
part to the much-maligned prac
tice of withdrawing from soci
ety.

It is only in an atmosphere
of partial detachment from the
system that major alternatives
to the present situation can be
considered in such a way as to
produce strong personal com
mitments to reform or revolu
tion.
At the same time the univers
ity environment encourages the
growth of serious misconcep
tions about the present status
of society within radical circles.
The same isolation that gives
the student independence and
flexibility in his ideological
search also effectively seals him
off from the arena of power
and politics as it is found in
this country.
And so there is little under
standing of the redemptive pos
sibilities for the future that are
found in the present. Such an
understanding is necessary be
fore effective strategies for
change can be devised.
Don't Ask
It is surely too much to ask
of the university, bound as it
is to the system, to move with
any speed in the direction of
giving the left a firmer base in
the American context.
Fringe groups and extracur
ricular organizations have pro
vided most of the channels for
radical ferment in the past but
they all suffer from their image
as secondary activities to bn
tacked on as supplements to the
student's credit load.
Last year's Experiment
proved that, for most students,
when a conflict occurs between
studies for credit and a volun
tary seminar the former took
priority hands down.

Confronted then by the im
mobility of the university on the
one hand and the inefficiency of
non-credit organizations on the
other, certain groups have at
tempted to find ad hoc middle
ground on which to build action
analysis education until struc
tural change in the curriculum
occurs.
One popular method has been
the use of activity credits. But
because all students are re
quired to amass 6 activity cred
its, programs based on this ap
proach are often weighted down
by students just "doing time."
Furthermore, the activity
credit does not make an appreci
able inroad into the academic
credit load.
A second approach, only now

being explored, involves close
cooperation between faculty and
students on action-analysis pro
grams outside the university
but with academic credit. The
use of credit allows participants
to devote substantial amounts
of time to the project.
A group operating under
these circumstances will retain
most of the independence and
flexibility of the university sem
inar while gaining an under
standing of how an American
community reacts and changes
in response to reformist activ
ity.
Through operations of this
type a new realism can be in
jected into the university left.
