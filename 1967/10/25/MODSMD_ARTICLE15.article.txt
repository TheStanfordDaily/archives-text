# Fishman's Wharf
## The 						Draft Hall Putsch 
### Bob Fishman 
Now that the Revolution has
come and gone, we detached ob
servers are compelled to ask:
What did all the tumult, the
cracked heads and lost sleep
accomplish? My own opinion
is that the most lasting marks
left by the demonstrators are
the black-and blue ones on the
buttocks of the demonstrators.
The threat of violence, what
ever its tactical merits, certainly
does attract a good crowd. Peo
ple were drawn by the promise
of being part of a great event,
and by the excitement of physi
cal danger. Day-to-day protest
ing is boring, but a. line of cops
coming down Clay Street stirs
the blood, if nothing else.
It makes good film for TV
cameramen and allows a lot of
people to foam at the mouth
over police brutality. (Hundreds
of people are being shot to death
in Vietnam while we get worked
up over "police brutality.")
Show
The demonstrators wanted to
prove to themselves that they too
were fighting evil. Perhaps this
is why the planners felt compel
led to imitate the military with

squadron leaders, staging areas,
walkie-talkies, lookouts, and
even a triumphal parade.
Unfortunately, the event was
a pseudo-event. Even the stated
objectives, small as they were,
were unrealizable.
The United States, say the
protesters, is fighting a geno
cidal war; American foreign pol
icy is leading the world to nu
clear holocaust; therefore, we
shall shut down the Pentagon
and a few induction centers for
one day. Washington's Birthday
or a good snow storm does as
much.

But big demonstrations make
the front page of the Chronicle,
so people think they've done
something important. Just wait
a few days and the series on
silicone treatments will be back
in its accustomed place.
The long-term aims of the
demonstrators were equally re
moved from reality — even the
reality the protesters perceived.
The Vietnam war, they tell us,
is the direct result of the sick
ness deep in the American spirit.

But if the malaise is so advanc
ed, why parade?
The United States, we are in
formed, is really ruled by an un
democratic clique tied to the
military-industrial complex. So
why worry about "influencing
public opinion?"
It is in the context of this ul
timate uselessness that the pro
tests degenerated into theatricals
for people to act out their own
self-righteousness.
The demonstrations, in other
words, were therapeutic rather
than political. They eased the
conscience of the safe students
who felt that they were not sac
rificing enough for the cause.
They enabled people to visibly
identify themselves with the side
of truth and justice. They as
sembled the masses, and you
didn't have to listen to a lot of
speeches.
If the war ever ends, it will be
because the American people
don't want to pay the extra taxes
it entails. In the meantime, we
can amuse ourselves playing
games with the police, but let's
not pretend we're accomplish
ing anything.

of people are being shot to death
in Vietnam while we get worked
up over "police brutality.")

The demonstrators wanted to
prove to themselves that they too
were fighting evil. Perhaps this
is why the planners felt compel
led to imitate the military with

squadron leaders, staging areas,
walkie-talkies, lookouts, and
even a triumphal parade.
Unfortunately, the event was
a pseudo-event. Even the stated
objectives, small as they were,
were unrealizable.
The United States, say the
protesters, is fighting a geno
cidal war; American foreign pol
icy is leading the world to nu
clear holocaust; therefore, we
shall shut down the Pentagon

one day. Washington's Birthday

much.

But big demonstrations make
the front page of the Chronicle,
so people think they've done
something important. Just wait
a few days and the series on
silicone treatments will be back
in its accustomed place.
The long-term aims of the
demonstrators were equally re
moved from reality — even the
reality the protesters perceived.
The Vietnam war, they tell us,
is the direct result of the sick
ness deep in the American spirit.

But if the malaise is so advanc
ed, why parade?
The United States, we are in
formed, is really ruled by an un
democratic clique tied to the
military-industrial complex. So
why worry about "influencing
public opinion?"
It is in the context of this ul
timate uselessness that the pro
tests degenerated into theatricals
for people to act out their own
self-righteousness.
The demonstrations, in other
words, were therapeutic rather
than political. They eased the
conscience of the safe students
who felt that they were not sac
rificing enough for the cause.
They enabled people to visibly
identify themselves with the side
of truth and justice. They as
sembled the masses, and you
didn't have to listen to a lot of
speeches.
If the war ever ends, it will be
because the American people
don't want to pay the extra taxes
it entails. In the meantime, we
can amuse ourselves playing
games with the police, but let's
not pretend we're accomplish
ing anything.
Now that the Revolution has
come and gone, we detached ob
servers are compelled to ask:
What did all the tumult, the
cracked heads and lost sleep
accomplish? My own opinion
is that the most lasting marks
left by the demonstrators are
the black-and blue ones on the
buttocks of the demonstrators.
The threat of violence, what
ever its tactical merits, certainly
does attract a good crowd. Peo
ple were drawn by the promise
of being part of a great event,
and by the excitement of physi
cal danger. Day-to-day protest
ing is boring, but a. line of cops
coming down Clay Street stirs
the blood, if nothing else.
It makes good film for TV
cameramen and allows a lot of
people to foam at the mouth
over police brutality. (Hundreds
of people are being shot to death
in Vietnam while we get worked
