# Anthro Prof Writes Peace Corps Manual

### JEFF ROBINSON 
The Peace Corps has selected
Stanford Professor Robert B.
Textor's book, Cultural Fron
tiers of the Peace Corps, to send
to its more than 10,000 volun
teers around the world.
Textor, a professor in anthro
pology and researcher for the
Stanford International Develop
ment Education Center, edited
the year-old work to which four
teen social scientists contributed
articles on thirteen countries
hosting the Peace Corps.
"It's having an impact in
headquarters," commented Tex
tor, "and it received a very ex
cellent review in the Volunteer."
The Volunteer is the Peace
Corps' monthly information
magazine.
Textor also commended the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology Press for supplying the

book at cost to the service or
ganization.
According to Textor's intro
duction, Cultural Frontiers was
written "for volunteers and
staff members of the Peace
Corps, past, present, and fu
ture. ... It is a series of an
alyses of overseas programs in
selected host countries, with
each analysis written by an au
thority on that particular coun
try."
Textor differentiates the work
from other related studies, ex
plaining that Cultural Frontiers
attempts to examine the Peace
Corps overseas, not its directors
and administrators in Washing
ton. He points out that the four
teen authors were selected on
the basis of "recognized exper
tise". All are social scientists
or historians trained at the
graduate level, and that each
of the contributors has worked
for or with the Peace Corps and

has had the opportunity to ob
serve volunteers in action.
The book attempts a "com
pletely Independent treatment
of the Peace Corps," Textor
states. No one solicited approval
from either Washington or the
Peace Corps itself.
Though authors were free to
select their own topics, there is
a unifying theme: it is "the cul
tural frontier separating the
volunteer's American culture
from that of the people in the
host country."
Textor, who helped plan the
training programs for the first
Far East contingents, now
serves as a scout for potential
program directors in the Corps.

plaining that Cultural Frontiers
attempts to examine the Peace
Corps overseas, not its directors
and administrators in Washing
ton. He points out that the four
teen authors were selected on
the basis of "recognized exper
tise". All are social scientists

graduate level, and that each
of the contributors has worked
for or with the Peace Corps and

has had the opportunity to ob
serve volunteers in action.
The book attempts a "com
pletely Independent treatment
of the Peace Corps," Textor
states. No one solicited approval
from either Washington or the
Peace Corps itself.
Though authors were free to
select their own topics, there is
a unifying theme: it is "the cul
tural frontier separating the
volunteer's American culture
from that of the people in the
host country."
Textor, who helped plan the
training programs for the first
Far East contingents, now
serves as a scout for potential
program directors in the Corps.

The Peace Corps has selected
Stanford Professor Robert B.
Textor's book, Cultural Fron
tiers of the Peace Corps, to send
to its more than 10,000 volun
teers around the world.
Textor, a professor in anthro
pology and researcher for the
Stanford International Develop
ment Education Center, edited
the year-old work to which four
teen social scientists contributed
articles on thirteen countries
hosting the Peace Corps.
"It's having an impact in
headquarters," commented Tex
tor, "and it received a very ex
cellent review in the Volunteer."
The Volunteer is the Peace
Corps' monthly information
magazine.
Textor also commended the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology Press for supplying the

book at cost to the service or
ganization.
According to Textor's intro
duction, Cultural Frontiers was
written "for volunteers and
staff members of the Peace
Corps, past, present, and fu
ture. ... It is a series of an
alyses of overseas programs in
selected host countries, with
each analysis written by an au
thority on that particular coun
try."

plaining that Cultural Frontiers
