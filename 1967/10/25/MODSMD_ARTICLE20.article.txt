# Ralston Tells Pass Ideas; Lauds Snider's Blocking
## 
### NICK SELBY 
(An Interview with Stanford
football coach John Ralston.)
Q. It seems Stanford's passing
attack has finally come of age.
Has there been a change in
your thinking as to the worth
of our passing attack as the
season has progressed? Did the
game plan call for Williams to
pass as much as he did against
UCLA?
Coach Ralston: We had hoped
to pass a lot at the start of the
season, but then Chuck Wil
liams sprained his ankle in the
first game against Oregon State.
We had to go to a running at
tack until he recovered. Now
he's OK and we can throw a
lot. Our game plan did call for
the varied offense we used
against UCLA.
Q. Is Williams the best passer
you've coached at Stanford?
Coach Ralston: I'd say he was
as good a pure passer as I've
seen at Stanford. But Dave
Lewis threw very well too.

Lewis had a bad shoulder his
senior year that hurt him.
Q. Who were your offensive
and defensive standouts of the
UCLA game?
Coach Ralston: The coaching
films showed that tackle Mal
colm Snider played his best
game of the year. Center Tom
Giallonardo looked good, and
Jack Root blocked tremendous
ly. He knocked Bruins on their
backs time after time.
On defense, Don Parish and
Blaine Nye were outstanding.
But the films showed we missed
a lot of tackles. I was very dis
appointed with our tackling.
Q. Was there any reason for
UCLA's success with the pitch
out and cutback through the
middle running play?
Coach Ralston: UCLA was
double teaming our middle
guard and trap blocking ex
tremely well. Our linebackers
weren't filling the hole well. And
again, we missed a lot of
tackles.

Q. Why did you decide to have
Williams punt the ball after a
third quarter drive stopped?
Couldn't Bill Shoemaker have
tried a field goal? He kicked a
50 yarder against Tulane last
year. A field goal there and one
on the last desperate drive
would have won the game 22-21.
Coach Ralston: Originally,
our punter for the season was
to have been Williams. But after
he got hurt we went to Bob
Reinhard. Williams is very good
on what we call a "poofer", a
short kick that stops near the
goal line. But the ball went into
the end zone.
Whether or not Shoemaker
would have made that long field
goal is on of those "ifs" that
always plague a coach after the
game. We decided at that point
of the game to try and trap
UCLA deep in its own territory.
But, you're right about that last
field goal. I know he would have
made it.
Q. What do you expect from
Army this weekend?
Coach Ralston: Many observ
ers feel that Army has the best
team in the East this year. The
Cadets were 8-2 last year, are
4-1 now. They lost to Duke after
a touchdown was called back.
Army has a balanced offense,
and Steve Lindell, the Cadet

quarterback, can throw well.
But their defense is very tough,
and that will be our biggest
problem.
Q. Can you keep the team's
spirit up as high as it was
against UCLA?
Coach Ralston: The mark of
a good team is that it does keep
its spirit. I think our team will.


A REVERSE WITH A SURPRISE: Here is a diagram of a potential
gamebreaker Stanford tried twice against UCLA Chuck Williams
(11) fakes to Kirtman (48) and then hands the ball to Washington
(18) who comes around from his flanker spot. Washington then
can either throw to the split end, Bill Shoemaker (88), or run. Shoe
maker sets up the play by acting as though he were trying to block
the defensive halfback and then going long. The linemen all block
at the line except for the guard who pulls to block for Washington.
Shoemaker was wide open one time, but Washington was unable
to throw. The other time he threw the ball the pass was Incomplete.
