# Baseball Team Already Preparing For Season
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Stanford baseball coach Ray
Young summed up his philo
sophy of winning very succinct
ly. "I want to start at the top
and never look back."
The rest of the team apparent
ly agrees, for preparations are
already underway for the '68
season, still five months in the
future.
In addition to normal condi
tioning, every player is under
going intensive weight training
to build up stamina and endur
ance.
They're going to need every
bit of it — this year's schedule
includes 55 games, ten more than
last season.
Weekenders
Six Cards are currently play
ing weekend games in the Penin
sula Winter League, made up
of major league affiliated
"rookie" teams. Centerfielder

Bob Gallagher is leading the lea
gue in hitting with an eyebrow
raising .571 average.
Volunteers
The Stanford Sunken Diamond
is also being whipped into top
shape. The players themselves
have volunteered to resod, re
furbish, and rejuvenate the ven
erable arena.
New dugouts, bullpens, a
warning track, and a face-lifted
infield will certainly improve
the lot of the competitions, and
spectators should welcome the
new landscaping scheme and im
proved stands.
Outlook
Young, cheerfully flaunting
one of the most revered of the
Coaches' Commandments, ad
mitted that the outlook for this
year's team was "excellent".
He's right. Talent, experience,
and an aggressive winning atti
tude are a pretty tough combi
nation to beat.
