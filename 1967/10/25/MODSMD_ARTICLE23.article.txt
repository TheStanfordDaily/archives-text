All four teams have identical
3-0 win-loss records.
Theta Delts
The Theta Delts have rolled
up 108 points in their three wins,
and their stingy defense has al

the team's TD's on passes of
over fifty yards.

The Betas are scheduled to
meet DU on field three, while

Kaps tangle alongside on field
one.
All four teams have identical
3-0 win-loss records.
Theta Delts
The Theta Delts have rolled
up 108 points in their three wins,
and their stingy defense has al
lowed a mere six points.
Quarterback Fred Moseley's
passing has been the key to the
Theta Delts' success so far.
Although end Van Fishback is
out with an injury, Moseley has
competent receivers in Phil
Ensz, John Scales, Steve Am
nions, and Jim Butler.

ATO had little trouble knock
ing off Delta Chi, Chi Psi, and
the Dekes, but their defense
will be put to the test today.
Delts

the Alpha Sigs, the Delts appear
to be more organized now and
ready to fight the defending
champion Phi Kaps.
Doug Day runs the Delt of
fense at quarterback, with
strong protection from blocking
back Jack Alustiza.
The combination of Day and
end Bruce Wilson turned in a
phenomenal performance last
week, accounting for all four of
the team's TD's on passes of
over fifty yards.
The Phi Kaps easily shutout
the Fijis and DU, but now have
to face the Delts and Alpha Sig
in their last two league games.
So far the Phi Kap offense has
centered around sophomore
quarterback Ken Philpot.

record, should move into a sec
ond-place tie today if they can
get by the winless Fijis.

also 21, opposes Phi Psi (1-2)
in other action.
