# An Intellectual Jock!
## Reed Gives Wrestling Philosophy 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford is, beyond a doubt,
an intellectual community.
Yet many critics on the cam
pus suggest that brains have not
united with brawn in the Ath
letic Department here.
Now, surprise of surprises, it
appears that the study of philo
sophy has broken out on, of all
places, the wrestling mat.
The reason for this unusual
development is the coaching
technique of Dave Reed, a re
markable young graduate stu
dent working for his Ph.D. in
Chinese History.
Same As Studies
"Wrestling practices are much
the same as studies for my
boys," says Reed. "They are defi
nitely a learning experience."
"Just as going to a lecture
once doesn't mean that you real
ly know a subject cold, to the
fullest extent possible, so doing
a wrestling move once doesn't
mean that you know all there is
to that move, either."
Reed tries to teach moves by
principles, by a "patterned repi
tition of bodily movements," so
the wrestler can isolate each
component of a move.
For example, on a stand-up
maneuver, the basic move used

for a one point escape, Reed
demonstrates how to lift the
knee off the mat. "If you don't
perform that crucial first move,
getting the knee up and planting
the foot on the mat, you'll never
get out," he explains.
Bringing all the components
back together for a successful

completion of the entire move
is no problem. "Wrestling
is a finite, inter-related set
of principles. You attack, con
trol, and destroy the opponent's
supports," he concludes.
One problem with this system
is aptly removed by Reed. That
problem consists of the boredom
resultant from practicing the
same, small move over and over
again.
Reed impresses on his wres

tiers that each practice has a
goal, a goal of perfecting a
single complete move. "It is in
ternalized within the competitor,
but the truly dedicated athlete
attacks every goal with the aim
of becoming a naional cham
pion."
Furthermore, Reed claims
that the practices are boring only
if correction doesn't occur. "Cor
rection keeps the challenge and
the goal in sight, and challenge
is what makes things interest
ing."
The final job of a coach, Reed
states, is to "observe, analyze,
and correct all mistakes."

Reed's philosophy may sound
a bit idealistic, but it has ob
tained notable results. Last year,
two Stanford wrestlers took
fourth places in the NCAA tour
nament at Kent, Ohio.
Len Borchers and Terry Cren
shaw, both of whom return this
year as juniors, were the first
Indian grapplers ever to enter
the tournament.
Reed sees both as potential
national champions this year, but
adds there is a strong possibility
that John Suttle, injured last
year, could also place.
"These three boys make us a
good contender for a conference

championship, and we'll certain
ly improve on our 13th place
finish in the nationals last year."
See It All Pay Off
Last year, Reed was an un
paid assistant to coach Jerry
Budzik, who returned to high
school coaching in Michigan this
year. But Reed's aid was an in
tegral part of Borcher's and
Crenshaw's success.
Reed, who wrestled at 123
pounds for three years on Wes
leyan's varsity, and is writing
on a book on wrestling, now has
the chance to see his philosophy
pay off.
