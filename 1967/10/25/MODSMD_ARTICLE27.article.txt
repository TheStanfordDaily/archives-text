# Volunteers Ready Scholarship Drive
## 
### 
Eighty senior volunteers are
now making plans for the 1968
Heritage Fund Drive which be
gins winter quarter.
An organizational meeting
concerning the drive will be held
tonight at 7:00 in Room 270 of
Tresidder Union. A second meet
ing will be held in November.
The Fund was conceived by
the Class of 1955 as a perpetual
Senior Class gift to the Uni
versity. Through it seniors so
licit contributions from busi
nesses for tuition scholarships
which are awarded promising
students on the basis of leader
ship.
Last year the Fund raised
$16,000.
Nancy Pennington, Heritage
Fund Chairman, thinks this
year's goal of $30,000 is real
istic because "there are a larger
number of volunteers, an earlier
starting date for the drive, and
expanded efforts by members of
the drive."

One such effort is an early
solicitation program in which
volunteers will seek contribu
tions from home town busi
nesses during Christmas vaca
tion.
Some businessmen have al
ready responded favorably to
this plan, and it is hoped that
this aspect of the Heritage Fund
Drive will add a successful new
dimension to the program.
The drive will officially begin
in January with President Wal
lace Sterling's annual tea for
volunteers. During winter quar
ter volunteers will solicit in
couples.
Businesses have been divided
into five categories, and volun
teers will solicit in the area of
their own particular interest.
The drive will terminate at the
end of winter quarter in order
to avoid conflict with other sen
ior fund drives.
