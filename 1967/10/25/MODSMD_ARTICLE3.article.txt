# De Facto Power
## Finance Manager Runs ASSU 
### JAN WELLS 
The de facto head of student
government at Stanford is neith
er the ASSU president nor the
speaker of Legislature, but the
student financial manager, an
appointee of Dean Joel Smith.
Besides administering the
ASSU budget of approximately
$132,000, the student financial
manager performs such varied
tasks as approving tables on
registration day, rallies in White
Plaza, and assigning space in
the ASSU display case at Tre
sidder Union.
He is responsible for the stu
dent police, the Sunday night
"Flicks," the ASSU Travel Ser
vice, the Stanford management
Intern program, and the Lake
Lagunita life-guards.
Traditionally, he is in charge
of the Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU) of
fice and acts as a constitutional
consultant for ASSU.
Manager Has Experience
The student who holds this
power is Rich Ware, a senior
political science major and mem
ber of Theta Xi fraternity. He
served as assistant financial
manager last year, and was ap
pointed manager last spring
quarter by Joel Smith, dean of
students.
Replying to charges that his
office demonstrates ASSU's basic
lack of independence from the
University administration, Ware
explained:
"Actually the Student Finan
cial Manager is responsible in
at least three areas under the
constitution: not only to the
ASSU Financial Director (Dean
Joel Smith), but also to the pres
ident of ASSU, and to the legis
lature. Any of the three can re
quest me to do additional work.
"I'm Joel's (Dean Smith's)
agent," he continued, "but he
exercises no operational con
trol. I've been in office nearly
a year and have never seen such
control. He's too busy to bother
as long as he has someone he
trusts in the job.
"What ASSU receives from
the University are discretionary

funds," Ware continued. The
administration exercises no re
view at all over what we spend
it on. The legislature decides
what projects they want to spend
money on, and I see how we can
do so most economically."
Ware, who receives an $1800
salary from ASSU, spends "at
least twenty hours a week, but
generally between thirty and
forty hours a week, in the office."
Under him are two assistants
who take care of volunteer
groups. Ware, although respon
sible for the entire operation,
concentrates on ASSU work.
Gets Miscellaneous Jobs
He compares his job with that
of his superior, the dean of stu
dents: "It's a funny position.
Any miscellaneous job that
someone doesn't know what to
do with is given to me."
The breadth of his job was
demonstrated on Friday, Oct.
13, when a conflict arose between
Axe Command the Resistance,
both of which had planned ral
lies for the same time in White
Plaza. Ware ruled for the Re
sistance because they had ap
plied to him first.
"I don't know how this job
got stuck with giving permis
sion," Ware remarked, "but our
office has the microphones, so
we were put in charge. As for
tables they're automatically ap

proved if they're for a legiti
mate student organization, just
so they stay out of the line of
traffic."
Suggests Constitution Change
Ware suggested that the ASSU
constitution be changed to make
clear the authority over the
ASSU office. "The constitution
says that the president is re
sponsible for it. By practicalities,
however, the student financial
manager is traditionally in
charge, because he's the only
one in constant contact with it.
Ware is mainly concerned,
however, with the students' or
ganizations fund, which includes
all the student organization bud

gets. His office has two basic
jobs: administering the ASSU
budget and the "strictly banking
half of the operation" for stu
dent dorms and voluntary or
ganizations.
The ASSU budget, which this
year involves $132,000, is written
by the student financial man
ager and submitted to LASSU
for approved each spring.
The money comes from fees
(according to the ASSU Consti
tution, ASSU should receive
three dollars per student per
quarter from the University)
profits from the "Flicks," and
interest on investments. A sur
