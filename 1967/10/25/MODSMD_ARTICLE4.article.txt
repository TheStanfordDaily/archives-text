# Novak Leaving In June For New York Position
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Michael Novak, assistant pro
fessor of Religious Studies and
noted Roman Catholic author,
announced plans yesterday to
leave Stanford at the end of the
academic year.
Novak, chosen by last year's
senior class as one of three pro
fessors who had the greatest
Impact upon their undergrad
uate years, has been appointed
associate professor of Theology
at the State University of New
York at Old Westbury, an ex
perimental college to open next
fall.
The new college is designed to
be "an effective answer to the
complaints that college courses
are irrelevant to the real world."
Westbury's first class will be
75 freshmen who will study ex
tensively in the humanities.
Chancellor Samuel B. Gould
and the New York legislature
have expressed a belief that
once exposed to the problems
of the real world, the students
will have the motivation to
study without extensive curricu
lum requirements.
Expresses Regret
The new college will have no
grades, no semesters, and no
quarters, but will use small
seminars, workshops, independ
ent study, and field assignments
as the main methods of study.
Novak has served as a consult
ant for the college during rec
ent months of planning.
Novak expressed deep regret

at having to leave Stanford at
this time. "We didn't want to
leave here, but I have conceded
that the first three years at Old
Westbury are to be the big
years there."
Asked if his decision, made
one month ago, in any way re
flected a dissatisfaction with
Stanford, Novak stated: "The
reason is wholly positive. I had
intended to stay at Stanford for
another three years, but I think
that when you are young, you
shouldn't stay ono place for too
long a time." Novak is 34 years
old.
Professor William Clebsch,
Chairman of the Special Pro
grams in Humanities told The
Daily late yesterday that No
vak's reappointment for next
fall was being processed when
word was received of Novak's
plans to leave.
"We lament his decision," said
Clebsch, "but he is undertaking
an extremely important piece of
work." Robert McAfee Brown,
Professor of Religious Studies
and colleague of Novak's said
yesterday:"It seems like a tre
mendously exciting thing for
him, but it is a great personal
loss for us.
Hailed As Creative Voice
"I think of him as potentially
one of the most creative voices
in the Catholic arena. He's
young and he's just taking off
now. I look for him to be a very
important architect of the Cath
olic aggiornamento."

Novak and Brown will teach
a joint course next quarter on
the Ecumenical Movement and
are jointly editing a book on
Ecumenism.
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie
Napier last night praised No
vak's "gentleness, his compas
sion, his integrity, his gift with
words and language, the clarity
of his prose, the authenticity of
his Christianity ,his openness of
person and mind, his under
standing of the Protestant-Catho
lic dialogue, and his acceptance
of all of us who make the world."
"Since we tried to hold him
and couldn't, we congratulate
him on his exciting new calling,

with enduring gratitude for his
Stanford years."
The new appointment will en
able Novak to pioneer at Old
Westbury and will give him a
large increase in salary. He Is
one of the first three professors
to be offered positions at the
new college. Novak said yester
day other Stanford professors
are presently considering ap
pointments to the Westbury fac
ulty, which will number 15 in
the fall.
Author of Several Books
Already the author of several
books including The Open
Church and Belief and Unbelief,
Novak came to Stanford in the
fall of 1965 after doing graduate
work at Harvard University. At
Stanford he has taught semi
nars, colloquia and lecture cour
ses.
Last spring over 500 students
enrolled in his two elective cour
ses. Robert McAfee Brown has
described him as one of the most
prolific religious writers of the
decade and his next book, A
Time to Build, will appear No
vember 13.
Old Westbury will be headed
by Harris Wofford, former ad
visor to President Kennedy on
civil rights, and assistant direc
tor of the Peace Corps. Five col
leges of 1000 students each are
planned.
The first college will concen
trate on the humanities and
will integrate the practical and
the theoretical. Students will
spend about one and a half
of their four undergraduate
years doing field work like that
done by the Peace Corps and
other action groups.
The students will be much
more involved in planning their
education, according to Novak.
"The two main complaints of
college students about their col
lege experience are first, the sep
aration between their desire to
serve and their education, and
secondly, that their teachers
don't really know what they
should study."

leave here, but I have conceded
that the first three years at Old
Westbury are to be the big
years there."
Asked if his decision, made
one month ago, in any way re
flected a dissatisfaction with
Stanford, Novak stated: "The
reason is wholly positive. I had
intended to stay at Stanford for
another three years, but I think
that when you are young, you
shouldn't stay ono place for too
long a time." Novak is 34 years
old.
Professor William Clebsch,
Chairman of the Special Pro
grams in Humanities told The
Daily late yesterday that No
vak's reappointment for next
fall was being processed when
word was received of Novak's
plans to leave.
"We lament his decision," said
Clebsch, "but he is undertaking
an extremely important piece of
work." Robert McAfee Brown,
Professor of Religious Studies
and colleague of Novak's said
yesterday:"It seems like a tre
mendously exciting thing for
him, but it is a great personal
loss for us.
Hailed As Creative Voice
"I think of him as potentially
one of the most creative voices
in the Catholic arena. He's
young and he's just taking off
now. I look for him to be a very
important architect of the Cath
olic aggiornamento."

Novak and Brown will teach
a joint course next quarter on
the Ecumenical Movement and
are jointly editing a book on
Ecumenism.
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie
Napier last night praised No
vak's "gentleness, his compas
sion, his integrity, his gift with
words and language, the clarity
of his prose, the authenticity of
his Christianity ,his openness of
person and mind, his under
standing of the Protestant-Catho
lic dialogue, and his acceptance
of all of us who make the world."
"Since we tried to hold him
and couldn't, we congratulate
him on his exciting new calling,

with enduring gratitude for his
Stanford years."
The new appointment will en
able Novak to pioneer at Old
Westbury and will give him a
large increase in salary. He Is
one of the first three professors
to be offered positions at the
new college. Novak said yester
day other Stanford professors
are presently considering ap
pointments to the Westbury fac
ulty, which will number 15 in
the fall.
Author of Several Books
Already the author of several
books including The Open
Church and Belief and Unbelief,
Novak came to Stanford in the
fall of 1965 after doing graduate
work at Harvard University. At
Stanford he has taught semi
nars, colloquia and lecture cour
ses.
Last spring over 500 students
enrolled in his two elective cour
ses. Robert McAfee Brown has
described him as one of the most
prolific religious writers of the
decade and his next book, A
Time to Build, will appear No
vember 13.
Old Westbury will be headed
by Harris Wofford, former ad
visor to President Kennedy on
civil rights, and assistant direc
tor of the Peace Corps. Five col
leges of 1000 students each are
planned.
The first college will concen
trate on the humanities and
will integrate the practical and
the theoretical. Students will
spend about one and a half
of their four undergraduate
years doing field work like that
done by the Peace Corps and
other action groups.
The students will be much
more involved in planning their
education, according to Novak.
"The two main complaints of
college students about their col
lege experience are first, the sep
aration between their desire to
serve and their education, and
secondly, that their teachers
don't really know what they
should study."


MICHAEL NOVAK
Michael Novak, assistant pro
fessor of Religious Studies and
noted Roman Catholic author,
announced plans yesterday to
leave Stanford at the end of the
academic year.
Novak, chosen by last year's
senior class as one of three pro
fessors who had the greatest
Impact upon their undergrad
uate years, has been appointed
associate professor of Theology
at the State University of New
York at Old Westbury, an ex
perimental college to open next
fall.
The new college is designed to
be "an effective answer to the
complaints that college courses
are irrelevant to the real world."
Westbury's first class will be
75 freshmen who will study ex
tensively in the humanities.
Chancellor Samuel B. Gould
and the New York legislature
have expressed a belief that
once exposed to the problems
of the real world, the students
will have the motivation to
study without extensive curricu
lum requirements.
Expresses Regret
The new college will have no
grades, no semesters, and no
quarters, but will use small
seminars, workshops, independ
ent study, and field assignments
as the main methods of study.
Novak has served as a consult
ant for the college during rec
ent months of planning.
Novak expressed deep regret

at having to leave Stanford at
this time. "We didn't want to

a joint course next quarter on
the Ecumenical Movement and
are jointly editing a book on
Ecumenism.
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie
Napier last night praised No
vak's "gentleness, his compas
sion, his integrity, his gift with
words and language, the clarity
of his prose, the authenticity of
his Christianity ,his openness of
person and mind, his under
standing of the Protestant-Catho
lic dialogue, and his acceptance
of all of us who make the world."
"Since we tried to hold him
and couldn't, we congratulate
him on his exciting new calling,

with enduring gratitude for his
Stanford years."
The new appointment will en
able Novak to pioneer at Old
Westbury and will give him a
large increase in salary. He Is
one of the first three professors
to be offered positions at the
new college. Novak said yester
day other Stanford professors
are presently considering ap
pointments to the Westbury fac
ulty, which will number 15 in
the fall.
Author of Several Books
Already the author of several
books including The Open
Church and Belief and Unbelief,
Novak came to Stanford in the
fall of 1965 after doing graduate
work at Harvard University. At
Stanford he has taught semi
nars, colloquia and lecture cour
ses.
Last spring over 500 students
enrolled in his two elective cour
ses. Robert McAfee Brown has
described him as one of the most
prolific religious writers of the
decade and his next book, A
Time to Build, will appear No
vember 13.
Old Westbury will be headed
by Harris Wofford, former ad
visor to President Kennedy on
civil rights, and assistant direc
tor of the Peace Corps. Five col
leges of 1000 students each are
planned.
The first college will concen
trate on the humanities and
will integrate the practical and
the theoretical. Students will
spend about one and a half
of their four undergraduate
years doing field work like that
done by the Peace Corps and
other action groups.
The students will be much
more involved in planning their
education, according to Novak.
"The two main complaints of
college students about their col
lege experience are first, the sep
aration between their desire to
serve and their education, and
secondly, that their teachers
don't really know what they
should study."


MICHAEL NOVAK
Michael Novak, assistant pro
fessor of Religious Studies and
noted Roman Catholic author,
announced plans yesterday to
leave Stanford at the end of the
academic year.
Novak, chosen by last year's
senior class as one of three pro
fessors who had the greatest
Impact upon their undergrad
uate years, has been appointed
associate professor of Theology
at the State University of New
York at Old Westbury, an ex
perimental college to open next
fall.
The new college is designed to
be "an effective answer to the
complaints that college courses
are irrelevant to the real world."
Westbury's first class will be
75 freshmen who will study ex
tensively in the humanities.
Chancellor Samuel B. Gould
and the New York legislature
have expressed a belief that
once exposed to the problems
of the real world, the students
will have the motivation to
study without extensive curricu
lum requirements.
Expresses Regret
The new college will have no
grades, no semesters, and no
quarters, but will use small
seminars, workshops, independ
ent study, and field assignments
as the main methods of study.
Novak has served as a consult
ant for the college during rec
ent months of planning.
Novak expressed deep regret

at having to leave Stanford at
this time. "We didn't want to
leave here, but I have conceded
that the first three years at Old
Westbury are to be the big
years there."
Asked if his decision, made
one month ago, in any way re
flected a dissatisfaction with
Stanford, Novak stated: "The
reason is wholly positive. I had
intended to stay at Stanford for
another three years, but I think
that when you are young, you
shouldn't stay ono place for too
long a time." Novak is 34 years
old.
Professor William Clebsch,
Chairman of the Special Pro
grams in Humanities told The
Daily late yesterday that No
vak's reappointment for next
fall was being processed when
word was received of Novak's
plans to leave.
"We lament his decision," said
Clebsch, "but he is undertaking
an extremely important piece of
work." Robert McAfee Brown,
Professor of Religious Studies
and colleague of Novak's said
yesterday:"It seems like a tre
mendously exciting thing for
him, but it is a great personal
loss for us.
Hailed As Creative Voice
"I think of him as potentially
one of the most creative voices
in the Catholic arena. He's
young and he's just taking off
now. I look for him to be a very
important architect of the Cath
olic aggiornamento."

Novak and Brown will teach
a joint course next quarter on
