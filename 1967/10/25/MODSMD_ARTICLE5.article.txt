## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Last
week's anti-draft demonstrators
in Oakland were rapped by Gov.
Reagan yesterday for "taking
to the streets in violence . . .
I just don't think it should be
tolerated anytime, anyplace in
our country."
The governor's sharp reaction
to the sometimes violent draft
protests came at his first news
conference since returning from
the National Governors' Confer
ence in the Virgin Islands.
Reagan spokes to newsmen in

a hoarse voice, which he quipped
showed "just how much . . .
your health ... is improved by
an ocean voyage."
Asked if the illness might can
cel the five-state, three-day
speaking tour scheduled to be
gin Wednesday, he replied "I'm
very nervous about that. I'm
doing everything I can short
of goose grease and turpentine
on my chest."
A reporter asked him if he
was "perhaps repelled by the
spectacle of the Oakland anti

draft demonstration?" Reagan
replied, "Yes . . . and . . . the af
termath" that saddled Oakland
taxpayers with $200,000 in po
lice overtime and property dam
age.
Reagan contended "There ab
solutely is nothing that justifies
this kind of conduct," referring
apparently to the'sitdowns, gar
bage throwing at police and
street littering by demonstra
tors.
"In a system such as ours
. . . there is adequiate provision
for dissent for making your
views known, for trying through
legal channels to get changes
in governmental policy or law.
This is trying to force your will
upon the people by violence and
by lawbreaking ..."

On other subjects, Reagan ad
mitted that junior college fi
nancing needs study, but said
he feels any suggestion of
charging tuition at the two-year
schools "belongs properly in the
hands of the local . . . boards."
Reagan also said that it was
sheer change a confidential mes
sage from President Johnson to
an aide fell into Reagan's hands
on the ship hosting the govern
ors conference.
To reports the FBI is investi
gating, he remarked that he
thought Washington would have
wanted to let the matter die.
"I did not intercept someone
else's message or mail. I did
not," the governor said "read
someone else's message or mail,
intentionally, that is."
