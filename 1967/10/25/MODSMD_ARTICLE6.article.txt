BERKELEY (AP) â€” Critics
who sought to blame the Uni
versity of California for last
week's anti-draft demonstrations
at the Army Induction Center
in Oakland drew a documented
denial Tuesday from the chan
cellor of the Berkeley campus.
Chancellor Roger Heyns said
a study of Oakland police records
showed only 15 of the 28,000 stu
dents were among the 315 dem
onstrators arrested at the cen
ter for trying to shut it down
with sit-downs and street block
ades.
As for the campus outdoor
rallies preceding the demonstra
tions, investigation has resulted
in citations for possible disci
plinary action against 72 stu
dents.
Heyns had declined to author
ize these rallies. Without such
authorization, participants doing
such things as bringing in loud
speaker equipment violated uni
versity rules.
This was the basis of the 72
citations. Punishment could
range anywhere from a repri
mand to expulsion.
