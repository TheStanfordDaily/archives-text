# Shirley's All-American Love Feast
## 
### A Personal Report By KIRK HANSON 
John Q. Public loves Shirley
Temple Black and don't you
forget it.
Over 400 John Q. Publics paid
$100 a plate Monday night to
attend "A Party With Shirley"
and hear her talk about John's
concerns.
Although I was present at the
Thunderbolt Hotel in Millbrae,
I was not one of the Ail-Ameri
can John Q. Publics, I paid
nothing and so disqualified my
self. Journalists go free.
What's She Wearing?
Joining a mob of 60 newsmen
and cameramen to one side of
the reception line I heard one
comment to another: "What
would you say she's wearing,
Bill?" "Uhhh—a black dress
maybe." "Come on, Bill, do you
think the women of America
are going to be satisfied with
saying she wore a black dress?"
The two political editors then
argued about the hemline and
compromised by saying it was
mid-knee.
The red, white and blue
streamers which cluttered th">
room radiated from huge Uncle
Sam hats, no doubt fondly

cherished by the John Publics
Bunting abounded and so too
did the rhetoric in short order.
The MC could have been bark
ing a Fourth of July celebra
tion in the town square, for
good old American spirit perme
ated the air.
Invocation And Drinks
As a young monsignor, the
local director of hospitals, read
a long and involved invocation,
all was quiet but for the clink
of drink glasses and the con
stant ring of the cash register
at the bar.
We recited th? national an
them and I suddenly realized
how long it had been since I
had done this sort of thing, but
I guess that's because I am at
Stanford.
I sat at the Press Table be
tween the Associated Press
Bureau Chief and a reporter
from Women's Wear Daily. It
was tough to decide which was
better prepared to report on the
evening. However the AP man
and I did find Shirley was wear
ing a black sheer chiffon dress
with horizontal sequined bands.
How does that grab you?
After an all too common steak
dinner, the MC again arose and

in just two sentences told us
Shirley was "a born winner,"
"the real dessert of the eve
ning," and "in the hearts of the
American people."
He humorously said some
criticized Shirley's qualifications
but that he had checked the
Constitution and found, "there
is not a thing which disquali
fies members of the acting pro
fession" from going to Con
gress.
While I contemplated the
methods for amending the Con
stitution, Bing Crosby told a few
jokes, introduced Shirley, who
appeared in 35 motion pictures
and completed high school to
become a good housewife. Why
she was qualified for Congress
was never considered.
Her 12-page speech was a long
recitation of the ills of Ameri
can society. She read It care
fully to the supporters and also
the newsmen, many of whom
wore their "Shirley" buttons up
side down.
She called for a "swift and
honorable conclusion to the
war," which involved turning
the control of war policy over
to the military and presumably
bombing the hell out of them.

Shirley claimed this alternative
"minimizes our long-term peril
and our short-term anguish." It
only hurts for a little while, if
you kill them fast, I guess.
Federal Government's control
was a great concern of Shirley's.
As she said, the John Publics
have to band together to "take
Big Brother to the woodshed
and remind him who is running
things." Fight authority with au
thority, I always say.
No Flower Power
With the exception of Shirley's
teenage children, I was the only
"younger generation" member
present. When she took us on,
I rebelled.
John Public realized a lot of
things that night, but this time
"John Public realizes that by
1970 507r of the population will
be under 25 years of age, and he
realizes that these very people
are on occasion burning draft
cards, protesting, or dropping
out, playing mood music and
staring at pretty flowers. Make
love, not war, the signs say.
Doesn't look like they could do
either." (Thundering applause
and laughter.)
Do flowers reallv make irs
impotent —a whole generation'.'
Pay Your Bills
Shirley finally defined John
Public for us. She said: "I mean
to represent the interests of the
men and women who pay their
bills, who shoulder the burden
of taxes to support government
at every level, who maintain
their homes, who support our
educational system, who love
their country, who obey its laws,
and who try their level best to
raise their children to be respon

sible citizens." Shirley, can I
love the guy next to me? Is
that important or even allowed?
Shirley also said we must: 1)
resist monolithic government,
2) maintain local and state con
trol over their affairs, 3) replace
Johnson as President, and 4)
increase law enforcement
through anti-riot bills.
Tingling Sensation
Following her speech the MC
lept to his feet and said: "I know
you all are tingling just as much
as we are up here." Yes, I was,
in fear.
Just then he pointed to the
end of the room where the Ray
Hackett Orchestra played and
the Fourth of July atmosphere
faded with the lights and out
slithered an entirely sequined
broad to sing "Oh, I think I'm
goin' out of my head". I thought
I was too.

She called for a "swift and
honorable conclusion to the
war," which involved turning
the control of war policy over
to the military and presumably
bombing the hell out of them.

Shirley claimed this alternative
"minimizes our long-term peril
and our short-term anguish." It
only hurts for a little while, if
you kill them fast, I guess.
Federal Government's control
was a great concern of Shirley's.
As she said, the John Publics
have to band together to "take
Big Brother to the woodshed
and remind him who is running
things." Fight authority with au
thority, I always say.
No Flower Power
With the exception of Shirley's
teenage children, I was the only
"younger generation" member
present. When she took us on,
I rebelled.
John Public realized a lot of
things that night, but this time
"John Public realizes that by
1970 507r of the population will
be under 25 years of age, and he
realizes that these very people
are on occasion burning draft
cards, protesting, or dropping
out, playing mood music and
staring at pretty flowers. Make
love, not war, the signs say.
Doesn't look like they could do
either." (Thundering applause
and laughter.)
Do flowers reallv make irs
impotent —a whole generation'.'
Pay Your Bills
Shirley finally defined John
Public for us. She said: "I mean
to represent the interests of the
men and women who pay their
bills, who shoulder the burden
of taxes to support government
at every level, who maintain
their homes, who support our
educational system, who love
their country, who obey its laws,
and who try their level best to
raise their children to be respon

sible citizens." Shirley, can I
love the guy next to me? Is
that important or even allowed?
Shirley also said we must: 1)
resist monolithic government,
2) maintain local and state con
trol over their affairs, 3) replace
Johnson as President, and 4)
increase law enforcement
through anti-riot bills.
Tingling Sensation
Following her speech the MC
lept to his feet and said: "I know
you all are tingling just as much
as we are up here." Yes, I was,
in fear.
Just then he pointed to the
end of the room where the Ray
Hackett Orchestra played and
the Fourth of July atmosphere
faded with the lights and out
slithered an entirely sequined
broad to sing "Oh, I think I'm
goin' out of my head". I thought
I was too.
John Q. Public loves Shirley
Temple Black and don't you
forget it.
Over 400 John Q. Publics paid
$100 a plate Monday night to
attend "A Party With Shirley"
and hear her talk about John's
concerns.
Although I was present at the
Thunderbolt Hotel in Millbrae,
I was not one of the Ail-Ameri
can John Q. Publics, I paid
nothing and so disqualified my
self. Journalists go free.
What's She Wearing?
Joining a mob of 60 newsmen
and cameramen to one side of
the reception line I heard one
comment to another: "What
would you say she's wearing,
Bill?" "Uhhh—a black dress
maybe." "Come on, Bill, do you
think the women of America
are going to be satisfied with
saying she wore a black dress?"
The two political editors then
argued about the hemline and
compromised by saying it was
mid-knee.
The red, white and blue
streamers which cluttered th">
room radiated from huge Uncle
Sam hats, no doubt fondly

cherished by the John Publics
Bunting abounded and so too
did the rhetoric in short order.
The MC could have been bark
ing a Fourth of July celebra
tion in the town square, for
good old American spirit perme
ated the air.
Invocation And Drinks
As a young monsignor, the
local director of hospitals, read
a long and involved invocation,
all was quiet but for the clink
of drink glasses and the con
stant ring of the cash register
at the bar.
We recited th? national an
them and I suddenly realized
how long it had been since I
had done this sort of thing, but
I guess that's because I am at
Stanford.
I sat at the Press Table be
tween the Associated Press
Bureau Chief and a reporter
from Women's Wear Daily. It
was tough to decide which was
better prepared to report on the
evening. However the AP man
and I did find Shirley was wear
ing a black sheer chiffon dress
with horizontal sequined bands.
How does that grab you?
After an all too common steak
dinner, the MC again arose and

in just two sentences told us
Shirley was "a born winner,"
"the real dessert of the eve
ning," and "in the hearts of the
American people."
He humorously said some
criticized Shirley's qualifications
but that he had checked the
Constitution and found, "there
is not a thing which disquali
fies members of the acting pro
fession" from going to Con
gress.
While I contemplated the
methods for amending the Con
stitution, Bing Crosby told a few
jokes, introduced Shirley, who
appeared in 35 motion pictures
and completed high school to
become a good housewife. Why
she was qualified for Congress
was never considered.
Her 12-page speech was a long
recitation of the ills of Ameri
can society. She read It care
fully to the supporters and also
the newsmen, many of whom
wore their "Shirley" buttons up
side down.
She called for a "swift and
honorable conclusion to the
war," which involved turning
the control of war policy over

Joining a mob of 60 newsmen
and cameramen to one side of
the reception line I heard one
comment to another: "What
would you say she's wearing,
Bill?" "Uhhh—a black dress
maybe." "Come on, Bill, do you
think the women of America
are going to be satisfied with
saying she wore a black dress?"
The two political editors then
argued about the hemline and
compromised by saying it was
mid-knee.
The red, white and blue
streamers which cluttered th">
room radiated from huge Uncle
Sam hats, no doubt fondly

cherished by the John Publics
Bunting abounded and so too
did the rhetoric in short order.
The MC could have been bark
ing a Fourth of July celebra
tion in the town square, for
good old American spirit perme
ated the air.
Invocation And Drinks
As a young monsignor, the
local director of hospitals, read
a long and involved invocation,
all was quiet but for the clink
of drink glasses and the con
stant ring of the cash register
at the bar.
We recited th? national an
them and I suddenly realized
how long it had been since I
had done this sort of thing, but
I guess that's because I am at
Stanford.
I sat at the Press Table be
tween the Associated Press
Bureau Chief and a reporter
from Women's Wear Daily. It
was tough to decide which was
better prepared to report on the
evening. However the AP man
and I did find Shirley was wear
ing a black sheer chiffon dress
with horizontal sequined bands.
How does that grab you?
After an all too common steak
dinner, the MC again arose and

in just two sentences told us
Shirley was "a born winner,"
"the real dessert of the eve
ning," and "in the hearts of the
American people."
He humorously said some
criticized Shirley's qualifications
but that he had checked the
Constitution and found, "there
is not a thing which disquali
fies members of the acting pro
fession" from going to Con
gress.
While I contemplated the
methods for amending the Con
stitution, Bing Crosby told a few
jokes, introduced Shirley, who
appeared in 35 motion pictures
and completed high school to
become a good housewife. Why
she was qualified for Congress
was never considered.
Her 12-page speech was a long
recitation of the ills of Ameri
can society. She read It care
fully to the supporters and also
the newsmen, many of whom
wore their "Shirley" buttons up
side down.
She called for a "swift and
honorable conclusion to the
war," which involved turning
the control of war policy over
to the military and presumably
bombing the hell out of them.

Shirley claimed this alternative
"minimizes our long-term peril
and our short-term anguish." It
only hurts for a little while, if
you kill them fast, I guess.
Federal Government's control
was a great concern of Shirley's.
As she said, the John Publics
have to band together to "take
Big Brother to the woodshed
and remind him who is running
things." Fight authority with au
thority, I always say.
No Flower Power
With the exception of Shirley's
teenage children, I was the only
"younger generation" member
present. When she took us on,
I rebelled.
John Public realized a lot of
things that night, but this time
"John Public realizes that by
1970 507r of the population will
be under 25 years of age, and he
realizes that these very people
are on occasion burning draft
cards, protesting, or dropping
out, playing mood music and
staring at pretty flowers. Make
love, not war, the signs say.
Doesn't look like they could do
either." (Thundering applause
and laughter.)
Do flowers reallv make irs
impotent —a whole generation'.'
Pay Your Bills
Shirley finally defined John
Public for us. She said: "I mean
to represent the interests of the
men and women who pay their
bills, who shoulder the burden
of taxes to support government
at every level, who maintain
their homes, who support our
educational system, who love
their country, who obey its laws,
and who try their level best to
raise their children to be respon

sible citizens." Shirley, can I
love the guy next to me? Is
that important or even allowed?
Shirley also said we must: 1)
resist monolithic government,
2) maintain local and state con
trol over their affairs, 3) replace
Johnson as President, and 4)
increase law enforcement
through anti-riot bills.
Tingling Sensation
Following her speech the MC
lept to his feet and said: "I know
you all are tingling just as much
as we are up here." Yes, I was,
in fear.
Just then he pointed to the
end of the room where the Ray
Hackett Orchestra played and
the Fourth of July atmosphere
faded with the lights and out
slithered an entirely sequined
broad to sing "Oh, I think I'm
goin' out of my head". I thought
I was too.
John Q. Public loves Shirley
Temple Black and don't you
forget it.
Over 400 John Q. Publics paid
$100 a plate Monday night to
attend "A Party With Shirley"
and hear her talk about John's
concerns.
Although I was present at the
Thunderbolt Hotel in Millbrae,
I was not one of the Ail-Ameri
can John Q. Publics, I paid
nothing and so disqualified my
self. Journalists go free.
