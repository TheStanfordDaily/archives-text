# Frat Has Houses, No Home
## 
### Joe Frawley 
For more than four years
Alpha Sigma Phi has lacked a
permanent home.
When the Zeta Psi was kicked
off campus in 1963, the Alpha
Sigs moved from their ancient
building (which is now a psy
chology lab) Into the modern
Zeta house by the lake. In 1966
the Zetes came back on campus
and the Alpha Sigs were forced
to look for shelter elsewhere.
With the fraternity expected to
move into the new fraternity
cluster near the health center
this year.
The new cluster, however, is
still under construction. This
left the Alpha Sigs without, lit
erally, a roof over their heads.
Stanford took pity and moved
the fraternity into three differ
ent locations. They are: Man
zanita House on Lasuen, for
merly a grad dorm; Houston
House formerly a student guest
house; and two trailers con
structed by the Instant Space
Company and still bearing their
license plates.
Twenty-four live in trailers,
17 in Manzanita, and 13 in Hous
ton.
Manzanita was remodeled but
there are still rooms which are
two small for doubles and too
large for singles. Dave Kurtner,
a senior, who has lived in the
house for a year, says, "It's
hard to feel proud of the place.

Maybe we can be proud we're
putting up with it." But Kutner
likes his room because he can
"do anything to it and it won't
matter."
The fire department has given
Manzanita six minutes total
burn down time.
Manzanita has a pool room
and T.V., but all the residents
must leave the house for their
meals which are served some
150 yards away in Houston
House.
Houston House, hidden behind
Theta Chi, looks a little wearier
than Manzanita. John Peterson,
a sophomore, described its ad
vantages in these terms: "You
don't have to worry about tear
ing up things, and all the rooms
are different. Of course it's
pretty run down. It doesn't
make much difference to me, I
can live any place. Besides, I
know I'll be moving into a new
house."
Peterson's views are typcial
of the brothers' attitude toward
their house. They aren't angry
at anyone, and they feel they
are doing a fine job of making
the best of a lousy deal. There
are no more than two to a room,
and quite a few have singles.
"It's great for booking and
letching." said one of the broth
ers.
The trailers seems to present
the biggest problem. Due to the
very thin walls, "You can talk
to the guy in the next room
with the door closed." The big
gest complaint by far is that the
house cannot be decorated Only
tape is allowed on the walls, and
it doesn't stick too well.
On the other hand, the rooms
themselves are described as
quite comfortable. The rugs and
bathrooms are clean and the
heating is good. This is to be
contrasted with both Mansanita
and Houston which seem to be
merely waiting to be torn down.
One hasher complained that the
kitchen in Houston House was
too old and impossible to clean.
The University allows the fra
ternity to use Manzanita and
Houston rent-free, but collects
monthly to pay off the mortgage
on the trailers. The total cost
to the Alpha Sigs will be $1,066
over 18 months.
The main problem facing the
Alpha Sigs since they have been
split up is house unity. Although
everybody eats at Houston
House, many of the members
hash elsewhere. Unless a person
lives in your house you don't
see him. Different measures
have been taken to overcome
this, including giving each house
a University phone extension.
And Manzanita's pool table

draws all the fraternity's pool
players together.
Vance Simmonds, who de
scribes himself a firm believer
in crisis psychology, thinks the
house is rising to the occasion.
He notices that people are go
ing out of their way to make
up for their lack of physical
unity. There has been an increas
ingly larger participation in
house activities, social functions,
and intramurals since their oust
ing from the Zete house a year
ago.
The most significant conclu
sion which can be drawn from

observing the Alpha Sigs' hous
ing problems is that the broth
ers do not pledge the physical
house but the people in the fra
ternity. Increased efforts by the
Alpha Sigs to keep up commu
nication despite the hindrance
of physical separation has made
this fact obvious.
As for the houses themselves,
one Alpha Sig, while quietly
reading the paper in delapadat
ed Houston House, made the ob
servation, "This place is so bitch
in', I can't see why you would
want to write an article about
it."
