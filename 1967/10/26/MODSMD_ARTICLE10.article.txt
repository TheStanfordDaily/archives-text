# Letters To The Editor
## Cause After Effect 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
In a recent lecture on the Mid
dle East, Sir John Glubb is re
ported to have stated that the
Balfour Declaration promising
a national homeland to the Jews
in Palestine was "a concession
to bring the United States into
World War I".
As is well krown, the U.S.
entered the war against Ger
many on April 6, 1917 while the
Balfour Declaration dates No
vember 2,1917, i.e., seven months
later. Thus according to Sir John
the effect preceded the cause!
It appears that though he was
ousted by the Arabs despite his
faithful services to them, he still
adopts their propaganda, facts
not withstanding.

Editor, The Dally:
I would like to make the fol
lowing corrections to your ar
ticle on lUCTG grants for study
and research in the USSR and
Eastern Europe which appeared
in the 23 October issue of the
Daily.
First, the procedure for appli
cation to the exchange program
is no more complex than for the
average overseas fellowship. Sec
ondly, the State Department has
consistently favored the ex

changes and has tried to over
come sensitive political problems
presented by the program. Third
ly, the war in Vietnam while
certainly a major strain in US
USSR relations is not the major
factor in limiting the scope of
the exchange as I was misquoted
to say. At this point the major
impediment to the expansion of
the program is the shortage of
qualified applicants on both sides
due largely to the language
problem.
The exchange program is a
unique opportunity for Stanford
students and faculty, Applica
tions are available at the I-Cen
ter.

• Have Fun, Kiddies!
Editor, The Daily:
Well, the peanut gallery was
at it again last Sunday night at
Mem Aud, and 111 bet they must
really feel like big men, knowing
all those nasty words and keen
phrases! Actually, I know that
it's silly for those of us who
actually wanted to hear the
movie to complain, for after
all, as long as the kiddies were
having fun, that's all that really
matters, now isn't it?

certainly a major strain in US
USSR relations is not the major
factor in limiting the scope of
the exchange as I was misquoted
to say. At this point the major
impediment to the expansion of
the program is the shortage of
qualified applicants on both sides
due largely to the language
problem.
The exchange program is a
unique opportunity for Stanford
students and faculty, Applica
tions are available at the I-Cen
ter.

• Have Fun, Kiddies!
Editor, The Daily:
Well, the peanut gallery was
at it again last Sunday night at
Mem Aud, and 111 bet they must
really feel like big men, knowing
all those nasty words and keen
phrases! Actually, I know that
it's silly for those of us who
actually wanted to hear the
movie to complain, for after
all, as long as the kiddies were
having fun, that's all that really
matters, now isn't it?

Editor, The Dally:
In a recent lecture on the Mid
dle East, Sir John Glubb is re
ported to have stated that the
Balfour Declaration promising
a national homeland to the Jews
in Palestine was "a concession
to bring the United States into
World War I".
As is well krown, the U.S.
entered the war against Ger
many on April 6, 1917 while the
Balfour Declaration dates No
vember 2,1917, i.e., seven months
later. Thus according to Sir John
the effect preceded the cause!
It appears that though he was
ousted by the Arabs despite his
faithful services to them, he still
adopts their propaganda, facts
not withstanding.

Editor, The Dally:
I would like to make the fol
lowing corrections to your ar
ticle on lUCTG grants for study
and research in the USSR and
Eastern Europe which appeared
in the 23 October issue of the
Daily.
First, the procedure for appli
cation to the exchange program
is no more complex than for the
average overseas fellowship. Sec
ondly, the State Department has
consistently favored the ex

changes and has tried to over
come sensitive political problems
presented by the program. Third
ly, the war in Vietnam while
certainly a major strain in US
USSR relations is not the major
factor in limiting the scope of
the exchange as I was misquoted
to say. At this point the major
impediment to the expansion of
the program is the shortage of
