## Sit-In Reawakened Capacity For Fear 
### Joel Kugelmass 
(Editor's Note: Joel Kugel
niass, a regular Dally columnist
last year, is now a graduate stu
dent In theology at Harvard Uni
versity.)
I would like to tell you this
morning a little about the dem
onstration at the Pentagon last
Saturday evening. I want to do
this because I think that evening
has great import for the anti
war movement and because that
evening taught those sitting-in
much about the society in which
we all live.
Some of the incidents I will
relate will conflict with the re
ports of the television and news
papers. Everything stated here
was either seen by myself or by
so many witnesses to whom I
have spoken, that its veracity is
beyond dispute.
I began sitting-in at about six
o'clock. An hour earlier, accord
ing to intercepted army broad
casts, there were a total of 60,-
000 persons present at the Mall
area (the cement steps, the
"platform," and the grassy re
gion directly behind the cement
Mall). Simultaneously, there con
tinued a rally in an enormous
parking lot that had at a mini
mum a 25,000-person audience.
At least 3,000 were present on
the cement.
Sit-in Not Rush-In
Except for three or four iso
lated attempts, the demonstra
tors were staging a sit-in, not a
rush-in: our intention was to
hold that region of cement, to
avoid provoking the troops, and
to thereby let our bodies tell of
our hatred for the war in Viet
nam. Many, many had already
burned their draft cards.
Spirits were high: we felt
brave, cocky — honest and hu
man.
As the sit-in developed, some
left, new people arrived. There
were old men, mothers and chil
dren, priests, blacks, high school
girls, hippies, dapper suits and
work shirts.
Watching The Watchers
Money was collected; soon
big bags of food, bottles of wine
and water, cartons of cigarettes,
blankets were brought. We ate
and talked, but mostly watched
the rows and rows of troops
watching us.
Down below, out of the sight
of officers, soldiers sang with
demonstrators, occasionally puf
fing marijuana cigarettes offer
ed them.
It grew colder, and some
shivered; we bundled together
and built fires to warm our
selves. Although there was a
semi-full moon, it became quite
dark.
There were occasional beat
ings, tension increased; I, like
many around me, became
scared and we all wanted to go

to the bathroom. More than any
thing else, we knew we did not
want to be beaten. The leaders
told us to be quiet, not to taunt
the soldiers. Those who did were
calmed by their fellows. The
front line of demonstrators
sometimes spoke quietly to sol
diers about the war and about
the military process.
We believed somehow that
logic prevailed: if we did not
move forward, we could look
forward to a peaceful sit-in.
At about 9:00 I watched a
soldier take off his helmet, throw
down his night stick, and at
tempt to join the demonstration.
He was grabbed by MP's, beat
en, and then taken by a squad
down the length of the Mall
entrance until he was out of
my sight.
Rifles Instead Of Clubs
At 9:30 or so, the harsh non
flickering strobe camera lamps
went on. It was so quiet I could
hear the click-click of movie
cameras. The front line had
turned around, with their backs
towards the troops. Horrible
beatings began, some were ar
rested. A girl near me screamed
and vomited. I looked at the
white rag soaked in water I
held and felt sick. The rag was
supposed to help me breathe in
the event of tear gas. More peo
ple left; we all linked arms and
legs and bowed our heads.
The beatings continued at reg
ular intervals. Ironically, the
demonstrators became progres
sively more restrained. At about
11:45 I noticed that a small
wedge of troops had changed
character. Instead of its peri
meter being MP's, I saw that it
consisted of paratroopers with
rifles. I told my friend, "some
thing's happening, there are
rifles in front now for the first
time." All evening we had agreed
that "they wouldn't do anything
like charge the crowd—it. would
be too much, just too much."
The leaders of the demonstra
tion announced like prophets,
"we do not intend a military con
frontation. We will not fight.
We do not wish to be hurt —
it is not necessary to hurt us.
Will somebody from the mili
tary please communicate with

us about your intentions." Our
loudspeaker went silent. Then,
again, it repeated: "Will a repre
sentative of the military please
communicate with us." Silence.
There was no response.
The camera lights went on
briefly, but the press wall was
all but deserted. The military
had called a press conference in
side the Pentagon. Suddenly we
understood.
The soldiers clasped their
rifles like poles and used the
butts to pound heads against
the cement.
Over and over, one could hear
the dull thud and crack of wood
on bone. We cried out for cam
era lights, but they were off
and they stayed off.
Only Half A Sit-In
The soldiers started to kick
faces, trample the front line, and
drag people off. Everyone start
ed to flee as they reached the
second line of bowed, sitting
demonstrators. People screamed,
I shouted whatever came to
mind. The troops moved further
forward, pushing and banging.
People were thrown down stairs;
many threw what ever they
could at the troops. I saw some
lying about, unconscious. Half
of the sit-in ended.
The logic we posited was er
roneous. We assumed that be
cause we intended to be peace
ful, because many of us were
young, were women, were quiet,

were explicitly nonviolent, and
most of all because we were hu
man, that we might communi
cate with "them."
We discovered that we were
the enemy, and that according
to the Washington Post, we were
"not to be fired upon so as to
avoid international repercus
sions e x c e p t in case of total
disintegration."
'Babbling Of Terrified Men'
We were not people, we were
"peaceniks," or "demonstrators,"
or "invaders," or perhaps "char
lie."
The lesson seemed to me then
and seems to me now simple:
in the military, men are merely
tools. This is an inexorable con
sequence in a society that has
become incapable of asking it
self the meaning of its own ac
tions, the implications of its
own attitudes. It is thus incap
able because of fear. It is afraid
to look at itself and thus it is
afraid to be looked at. Now its
newspapers are afraid, its in
ductees are afraid, its televisions
are afraid.
Everywhere there is the bab
bling of terrified men.
"Saturday evening the United
States of America successfully
resisted an invasion of the Pen
tagon."
"Sunday morning the United
States of America successfully
resisted Viet Cong."
Monday morning husbands

scrambled to work, children to
school, while guardsmen return
ed home.
Reston notes the gloom over
the Capitol.
Moderation Will Moderate
The ugliness called Vietnam
slowly finds voices in the states.
Soon enough, demonstrators
will go back to Oakland and to
Washington.
The marches are over, but the
sit-ins have but started. The cries
of Vietnamese babies will re
sound through the moans of
bleeding freshman coeds.
Federal buildings will be de
fended more often. Inevitably
a demonstrator will be killed.
The papers will editorialize the
necessity of order, the powers
of democracy, the futility of
demonstrations. The words of
moderation will moderate.
And what, everyone asks, will
be the end of it all?
"This huge Paris, all black
and warm in the summer night,
with a storm of bombers over
head ... seems to us more bright
ly lighted than the City of Light
the whole world used to envy.
It is bursting with all the fires
of hope and suffering, it has the
flame of lucid courage and all
the glow, not only of liberation,
but of tomorrow's liberty." So
wrote Camus in August, 1944.
I read the news today, oh boy.
Somebody spoke and I went
into a dream.
