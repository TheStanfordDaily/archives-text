# Foreign Students Face Campus Isolation
## 
### BARBARA RITZ 
(Eeditor's note â€”The foreign
student in America often feels
isolated in an unfamiliar envir
onment. A prominent foreign
student at Stanford, Associated
Students Vice President Cesare
Massarenti, commented on this
problem in an interview with
The Daily. Massarenti, 26, is a

graduate student In sociology
from Italy.)
The initial weeks after for
eign students arrive in the U.S.
are critical, explained Cesare
Massarenti, and are often "a
mirror through which we see
America."
"We are amazed by the super
ficiality of the people we meet.

The first few weeks after a for
eign student comes to the
United States, it is arranged
that he will be invited by var
ious families for dinner, often
with 10 other friends.
"There they will introduce
you as 'this Italian foreign stu
dent' and you seem more an ob
ject of curiosity than a per

son." Massarenti called this kind
of initial exposure of foreign
students to the American soci
ety a mistake.
"We want to remove our
image as mere guests in this
country."
Double Standard
Massarenti noted a growing
consciousness among foreign
students of the conventional
ideas held toward them by Am
ericans. Massarenti felt that a
type of double standard exists,
in which the American visitor
abroad may criticize De Gaulle
or European politics freely, yet
suddenly becomes defensive
when a foreigner criticizes the
U.S. "Why should America rule
on our rights to say what we
think of this country?" he asks.
Violence Unfamiliar
Massarenti continued to ex
plain the views of the foreign
student toward American poli
cies. While foreign students will
recognize anti-Vietnam demon
strations, he said, they cannot
understand the political and
social repercussions which re
sult. After World War II in
Europe a different generation
emerged, he said. "We never
experienced known violence . . .
and have never seen people

killed on the streets." He cited
race consciousness in America
as well as anti-Vietnam dem
onstrations as creating violence.
"The police defend white in
terests, because America is con
scious of its white Anglo-Saxon
heritage." Yet the police can
not handle the "white idea"
when they put down these Viet
nam demonstrations. "The heirs
of the system they defend they
are now encountering in the
streets."
Students Isolated
At the college level, the for
eign student faces new and
often ironic problems, believes
Massarenti. He stated that many
foreign students are not so in
terested in the social aspects of
American life as they are with
their education here.
But a greater number of stu
dents, he explained, want to
participate in campus activities
and feel like a part of the uni
versity community.
"The university should be a
residential university with a
variety of living conditions. This
as such does not exist today."
Most foreign students, he noted,
must live off campus.
This feeling of isolation is
helped a little by such groups

as the International Center. "To
some foreign students the I-
Center becomes a shelter, where
the foreign student exercises a
kind of paranoia toward Ameri
can students." It is a feeling, he
notes, which says, "Americans
stay out."
Dating Problems
Massarenti brought out the
dating problems which exist for
foreign students on the Stan
ford campus. He observed that
male foreign students often
have problems when they at
tempt traditional American dat
ing patterns.
"Some students are living on
fellowships, and their lack of
income makes dating hazard
ous." He feels that this system
of dating lacks warmth and has
too much anonymity. Giving
the usual example of the man
having to arrange a date well in
advance and spending so much
money on his date, Massarenti
termed the American dating
system "a form of prostitution."
He believes this system of dat
ing to be an artificial situation.
The difficulty should be met,
he feels, by both foreign and
American students trying to
understand each other's value
system.
