# Secret Research Described
## 
### 
The Wall Street Journal yes
terday reported that growing
numbers of universities in the
United States are refusing gov
ernment contracts that call for
secret research.
Stanford University, New
York University, and the Uni
versity of Minnesota were listed
among schools that are now
tightening restrictions govern
ing acceptance of classified re
search contracts from the Fed
eral Government.
This spring the University of
Pennsylvania canceled two
classified Defense Department
contracts for assessing the effec
tiveness of chemical-biological
warfare. The $1 million projects
were abandoned after a two
year dispute that reached its
climax when several professors
threatened to wear gas masks
to commencement exercises.

The Stanford faculty earlier
this year inaugurated a case
by-case review of new proposals
for classified research. William
Baxter, professor of law, who
headed the group that proposed
tighter restrictions on classified
research, said, "We want to
head off the contracts that make
you lie about the kind of re
search you're doing."
The Journal saw the trend
against accepting classified re
search as a result of growing
opposition to the Vietnam war.
The scholarly tradition of dis
seminating to colleagues the re
sults of research is also a cause
of the opposition.
"There have been cases where
the Central Intelligence Agency
has attempted to negotiate con
tracts here that would have
made us deny the existence of
the project," Baxter said.

Stanford has already refused
some government contracts,
such as an Agency for Inter
national Development (AID)
contract to begin a graduate
program in physics at a uni
versity in Argentina. Two Stan
ford professors were to set up
the program while several Ar
gentine students attended Stan
ford.
The catch was that AID
wanted the right to recall the
professors if it chose. One Stan
ford official said, "Those terms
simply were unacceptable."
Federal agencies assert that
they are trying to ease restric
tions on contracts. A Pentagon
spokesman said, "We're at
tempting to eliminate some
problems by expediting declassi
fication where it's reasonable to
do so."
Backdoor Approach
A Stanford official, however,
said, "We're experiencing great
er efforts by the Defense De
partment and other Federal
agencies to insert 'right of re
view' provisions into research
contracts that normally would
n't be classified. This is sort of
the backdoor approach to classi
fication."
Harvard and several other uni
versities ban all classified re
search but allow professors to
be consultants to secret projects
outside the university.

of the opposition.
"There have been cases where
the Central Intelligence Agency
has attempted to negotiate con
tracts here that would have
made us deny the existence of
the project," Baxter said.

Stanford has already refused
some government contracts,
such as an Agency for Inter
national Development (AID)
contract to begin a graduate
program in physics at a uni
versity in Argentina. Two Stan
ford professors were to set up
the program while several Ar
gentine students attended Stan
ford.
The catch was that AID
wanted the right to recall the
professors if it chose. One Stan
ford official said, "Those terms
simply were unacceptable."
Federal agencies assert that
they are trying to ease restric
tions on contracts. A Pentagon
spokesman said, "We're at
tempting to eliminate some
problems by expediting declassi
fication where it's reasonable to
do so."
Backdoor Approach
A Stanford official, however,
said, "We're experiencing great
er efforts by the Defense De
partment and other Federal
agencies to insert 'right of re
view' provisions into research
contracts that normally would
n't be classified. This is sort of
the backdoor approach to classi
fication."
Harvard and several other uni
versities ban all classified re
search but allow professors to
be consultants to secret projects
outside the university.
The Wall Street Journal yes
terday reported that growing
numbers of universities in the
United States are refusing gov
ernment contracts that call for
secret research.
Stanford University, New
York University, and the Uni
versity of Minnesota were listed
among schools that are now
tightening restrictions govern
ing acceptance of classified re
search contracts from the Fed
eral Government.
This spring the University of
Pennsylvania canceled two
classified Defense Department
contracts for assessing the effec
tiveness of chemical-biological
warfare. The $1 million projects
were abandoned after a two
year dispute that reached its
climax when several professors
threatened to wear gas masks
to commencement exercises.

The Stanford faculty earlier
this year inaugurated a case
by-case review of new proposals
for classified research. William
Baxter, professor of law, who
headed the group that proposed
tighter restrictions on classified
research, said, "We want to
head off the contracts that make
you lie about the kind of re
search you're doing."
The Journal saw the trend
against accepting classified re
search as a result of growing
opposition to the Vietnam war.
The scholarly tradition of dis
seminating to colleagues the re
sults of research is also a cause
of the opposition.
