# Keating Hits Violence, Seeks U.S. Observers
## 
### 
Edward M. Keating, Congres
sional candidate from San Ma
teo County, yesterday issued a
statement about last week's sit
uation at the Oakland Induction
Center.
"The obvious and terrible fact
about the past week in Oak
land," he said, "has been terrible
violence" resulting from fear
"which invaded a minority of
policemen, too many . . who
vented their feelings through
their clubs and cannisters. It is
the same climate of fear which
prompted a minority of demon
strators, too many . . to at
tack police after they had made
a non-violent sweep of the
streets fronting the Induction
Center."
He feels that "we must end
the fear-provoking war in Viet
nam. . . . We must renurture

instincts which have lifted Am
ericans from their despair dur
ing crises in our history. We
can do this by 'bringing those
millions back', applying them
to developing our economy so
that they can find self-satisfying
work," he concluded.
"Until all this is done, how
ever," he added, "our Congress
must establish temporary solu
tions to ease the crisis in our
streets. To this end, I propose,
a Federal Observer Corps under
the Attorney General of the
United States, to be based in
the major cities of the United
States," It would be on hand
during all mass demonstrations,
and would report objectively to
all proper authorities. A reduc
tion in the fear mentioned
earlier would result from the
actions of this group.
