# Stanford To Test Air Raid Siren
## 
### 
Public warning equipment
will be tested at Stanford at
11:00 a.m. this Friday.
The test pattern will be a
steady siren tone for one min
ute, a minute of silence and a
wavering tone for one minute.
The attack warning signal, a
3 to 5 minute warbling tone on
sirens or short blasts on horns,
is sounded only when an enemy
attack is detected by the North
American Air Defense Com
mand, and requires that appro
priate emergency plans be fol
lowed.
Radios should be turned on
to listen for emergency informa
tion. Radio stations KXRX
(1500), KEEN (1370) and
KLOK (1170) are prepared to
broadcast emergency informa
tion in event of attack when
other local stations must close
down.
The alert or attention signal,
a steady tone sounded for 3 to
5 minutes, is sounded on author
ity of city officials and means
that everyone should listen to
local radio or television stations
for urgent emergency informa
tion.
Officials in Santa Clara and
San Mateo counties have
selected the last Friday in Octo
ber, January, April, and July

for testing the mechanical con
dition of outdoor warning de
vices.
