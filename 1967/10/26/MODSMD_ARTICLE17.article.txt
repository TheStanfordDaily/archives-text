# Marijuana Problem Grows Among GI's In War Zone

(AP) — More U.S. servicemen
in Vietnam are arrested for
smoking marijuana than for any
other single major offense, the
Army's provost marshal said
yesterday.

John Steinbeck IV has charged
that three-fourths or more of
the Gl's in Vietnam smoke mari
juana. Steinbeck, 21-year old son
of the novelist, based his state

ment on his recent service in
Vietnam.
Brig. Gen. Winant Sidle, in
formation chief at U.S. head
quarters in Saigon, however,
said young Steinbeck's allega
tion was "ridiculous," and police
sources said his figure seems far
too high. But the latter say the
use of marijuana is undoubtedly
widespread.
Brig. Gen. Harley Moore of
Honolulu agreed that the prob
lem was countrywide, and said
several thousand of the 464,000
U.S. servicemen in Vietnam
might be using the drug.
He added that marijuana has
been found on sentries, on mili
tary policemen and inside the
Long Binh stockade where many
convicted marijuana users are
serving sentences.
There have been persistent re
ports of marijuana being found
in the clothing of dead and
wounded Americans flown out
of battlefields. Asked whether
some Gl's were smoking mari
juana under combat conditions,
Gen. Moore said: "It wouldn't
surprise me in the least."
The marijuana probelm in
Vietnam, Moore continued, did
not appear to be more serious
than in the United States among
men of the same age.
But he said the implications
of the brain dulling effects of
smoking marijuana in a combat
zone were quite serious. He said
it was suspected that several
accidental shootings were the
direct results of "pot" parties.
The plant from which mari
juana is taken grows readily in
almost all of Vietnam and much
is shipped in from areas con
trolled by the Viet Cong. Mari
juana is one of the biggest cash
crops in Vietnam, and it is as
sumed that the Viet Cong are
selling it indirectly to the Ameri
cans they must fight.
It is also suspected that some
of the money is going to finance
terrorist and intelligence-gather
ed activities inside areas held
by allied troops.
So far this year 524 army men
have been arrested on marijuana
charges. For all of last year the
figure was 239.
