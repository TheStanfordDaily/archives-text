# Panel Gives Views On Oakland Protest
## 
### BILL EVERS 
There was much intellectual
thrust and parry in the Arroyo
lounge last night as English T. A.
Tom Grissom, History Instructor
Ronald Hamowy, English Profes
sor Robert Polhemus, and Politi
cal Science Professor Charles
Drekmeier discussed Stop The
Draft Week.
The symposium, second in a se
ries of Wednesday evening dis
cussions at Arroyo, drew a crowd
which packed the lounge.
Grissom said that he is at pres
ent generally in favor of what
happened on Friday. He said that
his cautionary remarks at the
White Plaza rally on Thursday
resulted from his feeling that the
Berkeley Resistance leadership
had collapsed, that recent rheto
ric had been vague, and that be
cause of this persons at the In
duction Center on Friday would
not understand the significance
of their actions.
Grissom described Monday as
a "morality play." Tuesday there
was no script; people got hurt.
But Friday, although in a sense
a reenactment of Tuesday, was
not a riot, was not guerrilla war
fare. It was rather proof that the
demonstrators were capable of
imaginative mobility, Grissom
said. Protestors did not sit down
but used big, movable objects
and kept the buses away for one
hour and ten minutes longer
than before.
Hamowy asserted the Oak
land demonstrations had failed
by not providing the publicity
necessary to make the draft a
political issue. The public has to
be shocked out of its nearly com
plete apathy, he said.
The history instructor said
the draft has to somehow touch
upon the lives the Kiwanis Club
and bridge group members, un
til they talk about it all the time.
Hamowy felt that the mone
spectacular the publicity given
to the draft issue the better and
that to this end violence is jus
tified.
High taxes resulting from the
costs of the war do not hit the
taxpayer hard enough to jolt
him out of his indifference, ac
cording to Hamowy. The war
said to cost the average Amer
ican family about $300 a year.
Hamowy characterized the
draft as "legalized slavery" for
two years, "a bad sort of thing
to have in a free society." He be
lieves the draft issue can and
should be separated from the
war and that cutting off the
Pentagon or bombing it, for that

matter ("give them a warning
or something, first"), is the kind
of step needed to interest the
public.
Most of the questions from
the audience were directed to
Hamowy.
Prof. Polhemus did not see
the protest as a failure. He
gauges public interest in such
things by what persons say on
radio talk shows, and they are
talking about the demonstra
tions. "The intolerability of the
war" meant, according to Pol
hemus, that the draft issue
could not be separated from the
war issue. He found it interest
ing that the life span in the
twentieth century seemed to be
increasing concurrently with
the imposition of the draft by
the old on the young. The idea
seems to be to "fight to the last
18-year-old."
Prof. Drekmeir said "the de
cision to break the law is a valid
decision ;the law is not justice."
But he warned against "the
politics of self-indulgence" in
which one maintains the piety
of one's soul while sacrificing
others. Drekmeir concluded that
in a liberal society "we may be
obligated to suffer evil, but we
are not obligated to commit
evil."

Hamowy characterized the
draft as "legalized slavery" for
two years, "a bad sort of thing
to have in a free society." He be
lieves the draft issue can and
should be separated from the
war and that cutting off the
Pentagon or bombing it, for that

matter ("give them a warning
or something, first"), is the kind
of step needed to interest the
public.
Most of the questions from
the audience were directed to
Hamowy.
Prof. Polhemus did not see
the protest as a failure. He
gauges public interest in such
things by what persons say on
radio talk shows, and they are
talking about the demonstra
tions. "The intolerability of the
war" meant, according to Pol
hemus, that the draft issue
could not be separated from the
war issue. He found it interest
ing that the life span in the
twentieth century seemed to be
increasing concurrently with
the imposition of the draft by
the old on the young. The idea
seems to be to "fight to the last
18-year-old."
Prof. Drekmeir said "the de
cision to break the law is a valid
decision ;the law is not justice."
But he warned against "the
politics of self-indulgence" in
which one maintains the piety
of one's soul while sacrificing
others. Drekmeir concluded that
in a liberal society "we may be
obligated to suffer evil, but we
are not obligated to commit
evil."

There was much intellectual
thrust and parry in the Arroyo
lounge last night as English T. A.
Tom Grissom, History Instructor
Ronald Hamowy, English Profes
sor Robert Polhemus, and Politi
cal Science Professor Charles
Drekmeier discussed Stop The
Draft Week.
The symposium, second in a se
ries of Wednesday evening dis
cussions at Arroyo, drew a crowd
which packed the lounge.
Grissom said that he is at pres
ent generally in favor of what
happened on Friday. He said that
his cautionary remarks at the
White Plaza rally on Thursday
resulted from his feeling that the
Berkeley Resistance leadership
had collapsed, that recent rheto
ric had been vague, and that be
cause of this persons at the In
duction Center on Friday would
not understand the significance
of their actions.
Grissom described Monday as
a "morality play." Tuesday there
was no script; people got hurt.
But Friday, although in a sense
a reenactment of Tuesday, was
not a riot, was not guerrilla war
fare. It was rather proof that the
demonstrators were capable of
imaginative mobility, Grissom
said. Protestors did not sit down
but used big, movable objects
and kept the buses away for one
hour and ten minutes longer
than before.
Hamowy asserted the Oak
land demonstrations had failed
by not providing the publicity
necessary to make the draft a
political issue. The public has to
be shocked out of its nearly com
plete apathy, he said.
The history instructor said
the draft has to somehow touch
upon the lives the Kiwanis Club
and bridge group members, un
til they talk about it all the time.
Hamowy felt that the mone
spectacular the publicity given
to the draft issue the better and
that to this end violence is jus
tified.
High taxes resulting from the
costs of the war do not hit the
taxpayer hard enough to jolt
him out of his indifference, ac
cording to Hamowy. The war
said to cost the average Amer
ican family about $300 a year.
Hamowy characterized the
draft as "legalized slavery" for
two years, "a bad sort of thing
to have in a free society." He be
lieves the draft issue can and
