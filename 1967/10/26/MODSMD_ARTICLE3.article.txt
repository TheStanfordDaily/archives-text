# Election Nov. 8 For Legislature
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A belated invitation has been
issued to graduate students and
off-campus undergraduates to
get themselves represented in the
student legislature (LASSU).
Nominating positions for
LASSU members have been made
available in the Associated Stu
dents office. An elections commis
sioner has finally been appointed,
and Nov. 8 has been set as the
date for elections to fill the gap
ing holes in the ranks of the
LASSU membership.
The Associated Students con

stitution provides for one LASSU
representative for every 75 stu
dents, which means the legisla
ture should have about 155 mem
bers. At the first meeting this
month fewer than 40 attended.
Vacancies for 76
Vacancies exist for 27 off-cam
pus undergraduate members and
49 representatives from the grad
uate schools of humanities and
sciences, earth science, engineer
ing, and education.
These members will be elected
at large. A student is automatic
ally put on the ballot if he sub
mits a petition signed by 15 of his
constituents.
Other LASSU members are
elected by living groups or
schools. But the seats set aside
for non-affiliated students cannot
be filled until the ASSU organizes
a campus-wide election.
LASSU speaker Michael Wein
stein has set Nov. 3, 5 p.m. as the
deadilne for petitions, which are
available in the ASSU office in
Tresidder.
If fewer petitions are submit
ted than vacancies, all those who
submit valid petitions automatic
ally become LASSU members.
Frequently in the past many off
campus and graduate seats in
LASSU remained vacant.
Little Interest Shown
Little interest has been shown
so far this year among those con
stituencies, according to Wein
stein. He has received only three
petitions.
The elections outlook is not all

black, however. The Associated
Students have finally found an
elections commissioner. He is
Craig Brown, head yell leader,
senior, and member of Alpha
Sigma Phi fraternity.
The elections for a new head
yell leader will also take place
Nov. 8. The yell leader, who leads
the cheering squad, takes office
winter quarter. Eight students
are currently campaigning for
the job.
At its next meeting, Nov. 2, the
legislature will be asked to ap
propriate a salary for the elec
tions commissioner.
The business, medical, and law
schools have been represented by
only one or two students at the
first two LASSU mmetings, al
though they are entitled to a
combined total of 18. The ASSU
by-laws specify that these schools
will elect LASSU representatives
through their own student or
ganizations.
The absence of graduate school
representatives has worried
Weinstein. In previous years the
legislature has been more active
when the graduate vacancies are
filled. Since Stanford has more
graduates than undergraduates,
the graduate students could con
trol a majority of the LASSU
seats if they bothered to fill them.
At present fraternities have 24
seats, Wilbur 8, Stern 8, Florence
Moore 7, Lagunita 6, women's
row houses 8, Roble 3, Branner
2, eating clubs 7, Hoskins 1 and
Toyon 1.

stein. He has received only three
petitions.
The elections outlook is not all

black, however. The Associated
Students have finally found an
elections commissioner. He is
Craig Brown, head yell leader,
senior, and member of Alpha
Sigma Phi fraternity.
The elections for a new head
yell leader will also take place
Nov. 8. The yell leader, who leads
the cheering squad, takes office
winter quarter. Eight students
are currently campaigning for
the job.
At its next meeting, Nov. 2, the
legislature will be asked to ap
propriate a salary for the elec
tions commissioner.
The business, medical, and law
schools have been represented by
only one or two students at the
first two LASSU mmetings, al
though they are entitled to a
combined total of 18. The ASSU
by-laws specify that these schools
will elect LASSU representatives
through their own student or
ganizations.
The absence of graduate school
representatives has worried
Weinstein. In previous years the
legislature has been more active
when the graduate vacancies are
filled. Since Stanford has more
graduates than undergraduates,
the graduate students could con
trol a majority of the LASSU
seats if they bothered to fill them.
At present fraternities have 24
seats, Wilbur 8, Stern 8, Florence
Moore 7, Lagunita 6, women's
row houses 8, Roble 3, Branner
2, eating clubs 7, Hoskins 1 and
Toyon 1.
A belated invitation has been
issued to graduate students and
off-campus undergraduates to
get themselves represented in the
student legislature (LASSU).
Nominating positions for
LASSU members have been made
available in the Associated Stu
dents office. An elections commis
sioner has finally been appointed,
and Nov. 8 has been set as the
date for elections to fill the gap
ing holes in the ranks of the
LASSU membership.
The Associated Students con

stitution provides for one LASSU
representative for every 75 stu
dents, which means the legisla
ture should have about 155 mem
bers. At the first meeting this
month fewer than 40 attended.
Vacancies for 76
Vacancies exist for 27 off-cam
pus undergraduate members and
49 representatives from the grad
uate schools of humanities and
sciences, earth science, engineer
ing, and education.
These members will be elected
at large. A student is automatic
ally put on the ballot if he sub
mits a petition signed by 15 of his
constituents.
Other LASSU members are
elected by living groups or
schools. But the seats set aside
for non-affiliated students cannot
be filled until the ASSU organizes
a campus-wide election.
LASSU speaker Michael Wein
stein has set Nov. 3, 5 p.m. as the
deadilne for petitions, which are
available in the ASSU office in
Tresidder.
If fewer petitions are submit
ted than vacancies, all those who
submit valid petitions automatic
ally become LASSU members.
Frequently in the past many off
campus and graduate seats in
LASSU remained vacant.

so far this year among those con
