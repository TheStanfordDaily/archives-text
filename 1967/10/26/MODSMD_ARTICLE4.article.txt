# F.B.I. Probe?
## 
### 
The F. 8.1, has been investi
gating students at four Eastern
schools who turned in their
draft cards, according to yester
day's New York Times.
The Times reported that stu
dents at Harvard, Yale, and the
Universities of Connecticut and
Massachusetts were questioned
in their dormitory rooms, in
halls, and in their dining rooms
by F. 8.1, agents.
The New Haven F. 8.1, office
promptly confirmed the reports
saying that "the idea is to find
whether the boys who turned in
their draft cards are in fact
eligible for the draft, whether
they did it voluntarily, and
things like that."
Students questioned reported
that the Federal agents involved
were quite polite and did not
attempt to browbeat them. In
several cases, the students even
engaged in philosophical discus
sions about the war with the
agents.
The Dean of the Yale Divinity
School went so far as to forbid
F. 8.1, agents to trespass in his
school. He also sponsored a
mass "solidarity" meeting of the
more than 100 Yale students
who had turned in their draft
cards last week.
Two Yale law professors ad
vised the students that they do
not have to talk to the F. 8.1,
agents. They also announced
that they had set up a special
telephone service to advise stu
dents contacted by the investi
gators.
The agents made no attempt
to arrest the students whom
they questioned. Under the cur
rent Selective Service Act draft
age males must carry their
cards on their persons at all
times. It was under this section
of the law that the students
could have been arrested.
