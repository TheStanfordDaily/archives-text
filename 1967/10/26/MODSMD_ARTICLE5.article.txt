# Profs Sign Petition
## Appeal On Israel 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Forty-one Stanford professors
are among over 2,500 signers
nationwide of a petition calling
for "direct negotiations to settle
all outstanding issues between
Israel and her neighbors."
The petition appeared in a
two-page advertisement in Tues
day's New York Times. The ad
vertisement was sponsored by
the American Professors for
Peace in the Middle East and
entitled "The Road to Peace:
Direct Negotiations."
The stated goal of the asso
ciation is "to achieve a just and
lasting peace in the Middle East
that will guarantee the security
of the State of Israel."
Three Stanford professors
were named in the advertise
ment as members of the 46-
member national sponsorship
committee. They are Felix

Block, physics professor and
Nobel Laureate; Paul J. Flory,
chemistry professor; and Nobel
Laureate Arthur Romberg, bio
chemistry professor.
Enjoys Wide Support
The association claims it "en
joys the support of more than
10,000 professors on 170 cam
puses throughout the United
States. Prominent among our
supporters are university Pres
idents, Chancellors, Deans, No
bel Laureates and Distinguished
Professors."
The petition read in part:
"Makeshift measures will not
advance the goal of a just and
lasting peace in the Middle East.
Only direct negotiations, whose
premise is peaceful coexistence
instead of continued belliger
ence, can obliviate the danger
of another conflagration which
may become global. There
should be no 'compromise' on
the moral or political issue: face
to face talks."
The petition also stated:
"Twenty years of Arab refusals
to meet with Israel at the con
ference table have resulted in
three wars, each of which has
been a potential threat to world
peace.
"The solution to the problems
of the Middle East is not to be
found by soldiers in 'another
round' but by representatives of
the countries concerned at the
conference table."
Urges Johnson Support
The petition urges that "our
colleagues in the academic world
and all Americans concerned
with peace and justice" support
President Johnson who has
said: Clearly the parties to the
conflict must be the parties to
the peace. Sooner or later, it is
they who must make a settle
ment in the area."
Romberg explained that the
group was organized immedi
ately after the outbreak of hos
tilities in the Middle East last
June. "We were concerned
about support for Israel by the
American government and peo
ple.
"The only matter of concern
at that time for many of us was

to see that support was given
to Israel," Kornberg said.
"The group originated when
it became obvious that Israel
was in peril. There was a great
deal of conscience involved in
joining."
Changed Emphasis
Kornberg claims, however,
that the emphasis of the group
has changed. "Our interest now
is to see a peace settlement in
the area. We have no platform,
no dogma ... we would only
like to see a political and eco
nomic reconstruction, working
toward a permanent peace."
Kornberg feels that "Israel
has expressed an eagerness to
make a peace settlement and
affect good relations with its
neighbors. Unfortunately, the
Arabs have not reciprocated."
Israel Responsible?
Floury agreed with Kornberg
that the Middle East needs a
"non-partisan peace." He stated,
however, that some in the group
"feel that Israel should be re
sponsible for giving economic
and technical aid to the entire
area. They have the capacity
for leadership."
The nationwide program of
the association has included cir
culation of literature, seminars,
and discussions. Kornberg com
mented that no formal program
has been initiated on the Stan
ford campus, but the campus
members of the group are try
ing to obtain a speaker to re
view the Middle East crisis. Sug
gested lecturers have been Bar
bara Tuchman, James Michener,
or an Israeli government of
ficial.
Kornberg stated that the 41
faculty members who signed the
petition were only a fraction of
those who would have signed
if approached. "We had only
a limited amount of time. Solici
tation of signatures has been
very haphazard; many hundreds
on the Stanford faculty would
be eager to sign and support
the petition if we could contact
them."
