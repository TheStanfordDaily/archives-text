# Indian Questions U.S. Drought Aid
## 
### 
C. Subramaniam, formerly
India's Minister for Food and Ag
riculture, accused the United
States yesterday of "distorting"
and "blooding" the name of India
"all over the world."
Subramaniam, who is current
ly studying American and Mexi
can agricultural techniques,
spoke before an audience of 100
in Tresidder Union. He charged
that America refused to give In
dia enough food to sustain her
people during the long drought of
1964-67, forcing her to "beg" the
remainder from other nations. In
the eyes of the world, he said,
"what was a hungry nation be
came a starving nation."
In Subramaniam's view, In

dia's food shortage arose from
two consecutive seasons of
drought. The production of food
grains, which was 88 million tons
in 1964-65, fell to 72 million tons
for the next two years. Mean
while, the population continued
to increase 2.5% per year, nearly
twice the anticipated rate.
One valuable consequence of
the drought, Subramaniam noted,
was that many "difficult and
hard decisions were made, which
had to be made." India is now
seeking a technological answer to
its agricultural problem — new
varieties of grain are being de
veloped, fertilizers and insecti
cides are being applied. In a high
ly controversial program, 32 mil
lion acres of new grains will be
planted in selected areas by 1971,
yielding an additional 19 million
tons of grain per year.
The long anticipated resist
ance of the Indian farmer to
new techniques has not mater
ialized, according to Subraman
iam. "When a new order of in
crease takes place of 20-30 per
cent, the farmer doesn't want to
take the chance. When the in
crease is 200-300 per cent any
farmer, even a conservative
farmer, will respond."
Beyond the problem of agri
culture, Subramaniam noted,
looms the problem of political
stability. "Language and cul
tural barriers split the country's
500 million people, and on a
regional level, ineffectual coali
tions of splinter aprties have re
placed the once-powerful Con
gress party. "Unless we have a
stable government to take the
difficult and hard decisions,"
Subramaniam cautioned, "we
will not solve our economic
problems."

planted in selected areas by 1971,

The long anticipated resist
ance of the Indian farmer to
new techniques has not mater
ialized, according to Subraman
iam. "When a new order of in
crease takes place of 20-30 per
cent, the farmer doesn't want to
take the chance. When the in
crease is 200-300 per cent any
farmer, even a conservative
farmer, will respond."
Beyond the problem of agri
culture, Subramaniam noted,
looms the problem of political
stability. "Language and cul
tural barriers split the country's
500 million people, and on a
regional level, ineffectual coali
tions of splinter aprties have re

stable government to take the
difficult and hard decisions,"
Subramaniam cautioned, "we
will not solve our economic
problems."

C. Subramaniam, formerly
India's Minister for Food and Ag
riculture, accused the United
States yesterday of "distorting"
and "blooding" the name of India
"all over the world."
Subramaniam, who is current
ly studying American and Mexi
can agricultural techniques,
spoke before an audience of 100
in Tresidder Union. He charged
that America refused to give In
dia enough food to sustain her
people during the long drought of
1964-67, forcing her to "beg" the
remainder from other nations. In
the eyes of the world, he said,
"what was a hungry nation be
came a starving nation."
In Subramaniam's view, In

dia's food shortage arose from
two consecutive seasons of
drought. The production of food
grains, which was 88 million tons
in 1964-65, fell to 72 million tons
for the next two years. Mean
while, the population continued
to increase 2.5% per year, nearly
twice the anticipated rate.
One valuable consequence of
the drought, Subramaniam noted,
was that many "difficult and
hard decisions were made, which
had to be made." India is now
seeking a technological answer to
its agricultural problem — new
varieties of grain are being de
veloped, fertilizers and insecti
cides are being applied. In a high
ly controversial program, 32 mil
lion acres of new grains will be
planted in selected areas by 1971,
