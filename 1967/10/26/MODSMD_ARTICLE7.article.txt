### 
The Theater of the Congres
sional Record will reproduce tb
highlights of the Senate deba
on the 1918 Sedition Bill October
27 and 28 at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Admission is free.
John Kulsar, organizer of the
programs, said that forty-nine
students, faculty and staff mem
bers will participate in the re
enactment.
Asked about the choice of the
Sedition Bill debate, Kulsar said,
"The bill could be debated now
in Congress in almost the same
terms as it was fifty years ago.
Only small portions of the word
ing would have to be changed:
'Germans' to 'Communists,' 'Ho
henzollern' to 'Vietnam.' The
contemporaneity of the bill is the
reason it was chosen."
