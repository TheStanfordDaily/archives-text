# Berkeley Bans 'Up With People'
## 
### 
BERKELEY (CPS) â€” "Up
With People" a musical crusade
made up of 150 young people,
has been touring the United
States and abroad since 1965.
Everywhere they've gone,
they've played before cheering,
capacity crowds.
But when they hit Berkeley,
California, recently for a concert
at Berkeley High School Audi
torium, their reception was
something less than enthusias
tic, to say nothing of cordiality.
They were barred from perform
ing at a school assembly by the
faculty-student committee.
Up With People, explained the
committee's majority opinion in
the 11-1 decision, "deals with
images rather than realities, in
that it attempts to establish or
re-establish an image or stereo
type. ... It seems now, more
than ever, that we are working
with the idea that toleration of
individual differences is of cru
cial Importance."
