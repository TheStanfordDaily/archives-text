People don't dash down
class after glass of Carls
berg Beer. There's too much
co be savoured.
Its lovely golden color; its
clarity and sparkle. The
slow, poetic rise of the bub
bles. Its magnificent bou
quet. (Just one sniff tells
you this is a noble brew.)
And the extraordinary
flavor of Carlsberg. A full
bodied flavor without a hint
of bitterness. Ever.
Try mellow, flavorful
Carlsberg yourself. It's the
one beer to have when
you're having only one.
Carlsberg: imported from
Copenhagen, Denmark.
