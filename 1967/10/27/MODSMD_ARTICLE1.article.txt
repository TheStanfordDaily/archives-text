# Students, Faculty Finish 10-Day Jail Sentences
## 
### HANK LIESE 
Over 80 anti-war demonstra
tors, including Stanford students
and faculty, left Santa Rita Re
habilitation Center early yester
day morning after serving 10-
day jail sentences, most of them
for disturbing the peace last
week in Oakland.
Almost 200 friends and rela
tives were on hand to greet the
ex-inmates. Many brought
flowers. Some offered cookies
and tea as the anti-war cam
paigners piled off two buses in
the jail's parking lot shortly be
fore 9 a.m.
A car caravan of Stanford stu
dents met members of the Stan
ford community released from
Santa Rita.
Former student body presi
dent Dave Harris, a leader of
the Resistance who was arrested
two days later than yesterday's
demonstrators, will not be re
leased until Saturday morning.
'We'll Go Again'
Almost all of the demonstra
tors, when asked to comment
on their protest and punishment
agreed on two things. First,
they believe that non-vio
lence was and will be more ef
fective than violence in accom
plishing what they are trying to

do—change in some way U.S.
policy in the Vietnam War.
Furthermore, most are total
ly willing, and even expect to,
go to jail again for similar dem
onstrations. At present, tenta
tive plans are being made by
the Resistance for sit-ins and
draft card turn-ins December 4
and 18.
Several Stanford professors
released agreed on the purpose
of their participation in such
demonstrations.
Economics professor John
Gurley, editor of the American
Economic Review and co-author
of Money in a Theory of Fi
nance, remarked, "I don't think
what we've done will directly
influence Johnson, Rusk, or Mc-
Namara.
"But there are millions of peo
ple who are neutral to the Viet
nam War yet disturbed by it. I
hope my participating in these
anti - war demonstrations and
spending 10 days in jail will dis
turb these hesitant people even
more and get them to speak out
against the war."
Emeritus Prof. Hadley Kirk
man, 66, who taught anatomy
30 years and is now doing can
cer research at Stanford, feels
that his term in Santa Rita was
not as effective as the demon

strations leading up to his sen
tence.
Like Gurley, he hopes that his
actions will stir neutral war ob
servers. "I feel," he said, "that
the more participants we have,
the better are the chances of
abolishing the war.
"I am not as young as most
demonstrators, and my health
not as good as theirs. But as
long as I am physically capable,
I will continue to participate in
similar anti-war demonstrations.
"War is a luxury which na
tions can no longer afford to in
dulge in, especially this war,
which could lead to another
World War and the complete
annihilation of life."
Neither Dr. Kirkman or Gur
ley feel that their actions and
jail sentences affect their posi
tions as members of the Stan
ford faculty.

"As far as I know," remarked
Gurley, "through calls my wife
received and people she spoke
with, virtually all members of
the economics department have
stated their support. As far as
my jail sentence is concerned, I
feel disturbing the peace is a
relatively minor offense."
Dr. Kirkman noted that over
half of the anatomy department
is distinctly conservative, but
"in spite of this I received as
surance of the department's
complete support. They sup
ported my opposition to the war
and defend my right to exercise
my beliefs."
Other Stanford professors re
leased from Santa Rita yester
day included Dr. Genevieve
Knupfer, 53, a professor of the
Medical School; Dr. Robert
Spitzer, 41, a clinical instructor
at the Medical School; and Dr.

Lelland Rather, 53, a pathologist
and professor of medicine.
Almost a dozen other faculty
and students, whose names were
not immediately available, were
released yesterday.
No Ideas, Please
From a distance yesterday,
the green and white buildings of
the Santa Rita Rehabilitation
Center gave it the appearance of
a military base.
The men and women demon
strators were completely sepa
rated from each other in more
or less U-shapcd barracks.
The protestors were also kept
apart from other prisoners at
Santa Rita. The reason given for
this separation was protection
from the other prisoners, who
might feel hostile toward the
demonstrators.
But Seldon Osborne, a 56-year

old longshoreman from Oakland
claimed, "our group soon had
the supposition that the jail
didn't want us giving the other
prisoners any anti-war ideas."
A sign in the men's quarters
greeted new prisoners with the
words, "Welcome to Walden 3."
The men were, for the most
part, left alone by the jail
guards, who were described as
fairly rigid. But the women were
harrassed hour after hour by
what one girl called the "irra
tionalities of prison matrons."
Almost every day the men
would conduct formal discus
sions or seminars, many on the
theory of non-violence. Gurley
led a discussion on the economic
problems of Communist China,
and another discussion covered
the value and danger of drugs.
"It was worth a year of col
lege," Kirkman remarked.

Except during three or four
head counts per day and after a
9:30 p.m. lights out, the men
were allowed outdoors. A bas
ketball court was adjacent to the
barrack.
"But one of the most fre
quent exercises," commented
Osborne, "especially among the
younger inmates, was yogi."
No Rehabilitation
Two of the girls released yes
terday admitted that they met
no one at Santa Rita who be
longed there.
"There was no rehabilitation
going on," said a 21-year-old art
student from San Francisco
State College. "People there
were merely serving time."
"Maybe the psychiatrist who
came around was an attempt at
rehabilitation," another re
marked. "Only this psychiatrist
needed another psychiatrist."

A car caravan of Stanford stu
dents met members of the Stan
ford community released from
Santa Rita.
Former student body presi
dent Dave Harris, a leader of
the Resistance who was arrested
two days later than yesterday's
demonstrators, will not be re
leased until Saturday morning.
'We'll Go Again'
Almost all of the demonstra
tors, when asked to comment
on their protest and punishment
agreed on two things. First,
they believe that non-vio
lence was and will be more ef
fective than violence in accom
plishing what they are trying to

do—change in some way U.S.
policy in the Vietnam War.
Furthermore, most are total
ly willing, and even expect to,
go to jail again for similar dem
onstrations. At present, tenta
tive plans are being made by
the Resistance for sit-ins and
draft card turn-ins December 4
and 18.
Several Stanford professors
released agreed on the purpose
of their participation in such
demonstrations.
Economics professor John
Gurley, editor of the American
Economic Review and co-author
of Money in a Theory of Fi
nance, remarked, "I don't think
what we've done will directly
influence Johnson, Rusk, or Mc-
Namara.
"But there are millions of peo
ple who are neutral to the Viet
nam War yet disturbed by it. I
hope my participating in these
anti - war demonstrations and
spending 10 days in jail will dis
turb these hesitant people even
more and get them to speak out
against the war."
Emeritus Prof. Hadley Kirk
man, 66, who taught anatomy
30 years and is now doing can
cer research at Stanford, feels
that his term in Santa Rita was
not as effective as the demon

strations leading up to his sen
tence.
Like Gurley, he hopes that his
actions will stir neutral war ob
servers. "I feel," he said, "that
the more participants we have,
the better are the chances of
abolishing the war.
"I am not as young as most
demonstrators, and my health
not as good as theirs. But as
long as I am physically capable,
I will continue to participate in
similar anti-war demonstrations.
"War is a luxury which na
tions can no longer afford to in
dulge in, especially this war,
which could lead to another
World War and the complete
annihilation of life."
Neither Dr. Kirkman or Gur
ley feel that their actions and
jail sentences affect their posi
tions as members of the Stan
ford faculty.

"As far as I know," remarked
Gurley, "through calls my wife
received and people she spoke
with, virtually all members of
the economics department have
stated their support. As far as
my jail sentence is concerned, I
feel disturbing the peace is a
relatively minor offense."
Dr. Kirkman noted that over
half of the anatomy department
is distinctly conservative, but
"in spite of this I received as
surance of the department's
complete support. They sup
ported my opposition to the war
and defend my right to exercise
my beliefs."
Other Stanford professors re
leased from Santa Rita yester
day included Dr. Genevieve
Knupfer, 53, a professor of the
Medical School; Dr. Robert
Spitzer, 41, a clinical instructor
at the Medical School; and Dr.

Lelland Rather, 53, a pathologist
and professor of medicine.
Almost a dozen other faculty
and students, whose names were
not immediately available, were
released yesterday.
No Ideas, Please
From a distance yesterday,
the green and white buildings of
the Santa Rita Rehabilitation
Center gave it the appearance of
a military base.
The men and women demon
strators were completely sepa
rated from each other in more
or less U-shapcd barracks.
The protestors were also kept
apart from other prisoners at
Santa Rita. The reason given for
this separation was protection
from the other prisoners, who
might feel hostile toward the
demonstrators.
But Seldon Osborne, a 56-year

old longshoreman from Oakland
claimed, "our group soon had
the supposition that the jail
didn't want us giving the other
prisoners any anti-war ideas."
A sign in the men's quarters
greeted new prisoners with the
words, "Welcome to Walden 3."
The men were, for the most
part, left alone by the jail
guards, who were described as
fairly rigid. But the women were
harrassed hour after hour by
what one girl called the "irra
tionalities of prison matrons."
Almost every day the men
would conduct formal discus
sions or seminars, many on the
theory of non-violence. Gurley
led a discussion on the economic
problems of Communist China,
and another discussion covered
the value and danger of drugs.
"It was worth a year of col
lege," Kirkman remarked.

Except during three or four
head counts per day and after a
9:30 p.m. lights out, the men
were allowed outdoors. A bas
ketball court was adjacent to the
barrack.
"But one of the most fre
quent exercises," commented
Osborne, "especially among the
younger inmates, was yogi."
No Rehabilitation
Two of the girls released yes
terday admitted that they met
no one at Santa Rita who be
longed there.
"There was no rehabilitation
going on," said a 21-year-old art
student from San Francisco
State College. "People there
were merely serving time."
"Maybe the psychiatrist who
came around was an attempt at
rehabilitation," another re
marked. "Only this psychiatrist
needed another psychiatrist."
Over 80 anti-war demonstra
tors, including Stanford students
and faculty, left Santa Rita Re
habilitation Center early yester
day morning after serving 10-
day jail sentences, most of them
for disturbing the peace last
week in Oakland.
Almost 200 friends and rela
tives were on hand to greet the
ex-inmates. Many brought
flowers. Some offered cookies
and tea as the anti-war cam
paigners piled off two buses in
the jail's parking lot shortly be
fore 9 a.m.

plishing what they are trying to

do—change in some way U.S.
policy in the Vietnam War.
Furthermore, most are total
ly willing, and even expect to,
go to jail again for similar dem
onstrations. At present, tenta
tive plans are being made by
the Resistance for sit-ins and
draft card turn-ins December 4
and 18.
Several Stanford professors
released agreed on the purpose
of their participation in such
demonstrations.
Economics professor John
Gurley, editor of the American
Economic Review and co-author
of Money in a Theory of Fi
nance, remarked, "I don't think
what we've done will directly
influence Johnson, Rusk, or Mc-
Namara.
"But there are millions of peo
ple who are neutral to the Viet
nam War yet disturbed by it. I
hope my participating in these
anti - war demonstrations and
spending 10 days in jail will dis
turb these hesitant people even
more and get them to speak out
against the war."
Emeritus Prof. Hadley Kirk
man, 66, who taught anatomy
30 years and is now doing can
cer research at Stanford, feels
that his term in Santa Rita was
not as effective as the demon

strations leading up to his sen
tence.
Like Gurley, he hopes that his
actions will stir neutral war ob
servers. "I feel," he said, "that
the more participants we have,
the better are the chances of
abolishing the war.
"I am not as young as most
demonstrators, and my health
not as good as theirs. But as
long as I am physically capable,
I will continue to participate in
similar anti-war demonstrations.
"War is a luxury which na
tions can no longer afford to in
dulge in, especially this war,
which could lead to another
World War and the complete
annihilation of life."
Neither Dr. Kirkman or Gur
ley feel that their actions and
jail sentences affect their posi
tions as members of the Stan
ford faculty.

"As far as I know," remarked
Gurley, "through calls my wife
received and people she spoke
with, virtually all members of
the economics department have
stated their support. As far as
my jail sentence is concerned, I
feel disturbing the peace is a
relatively minor offense."
Dr. Kirkman noted that over
half of the anatomy department
is distinctly conservative, but
"in spite of this I received as
surance of the department's
complete support. They sup
ported my opposition to the war
and defend my right to exercise
my beliefs."
Other Stanford professors re
leased from Santa Rita yester
day included Dr. Genevieve
Knupfer, 53, a professor of the
Medical School; Dr. Robert
Spitzer, 41, a clinical instructor
at the Medical School; and Dr.

Lelland Rather, 53, a pathologist
and professor of medicine.
Almost a dozen other faculty
and students, whose names were
not immediately available, were
released yesterday.
No Ideas, Please
From a distance yesterday,
the green and white buildings of
the Santa Rita Rehabilitation
Center gave it the appearance of
a military base.
The men and women demon
strators were completely sepa
rated from each other in more
or less U-shapcd barracks.
The protestors were also kept
apart from other prisoners at
Santa Rita. The reason given for
this separation was protection
from the other prisoners, who
might feel hostile toward the
demonstrators.
But Seldon Osborne, a 56-year

old longshoreman from Oakland
claimed, "our group soon had
the supposition that the jail
didn't want us giving the other
prisoners any anti-war ideas."
A sign in the men's quarters
greeted new prisoners with the
words, "Welcome to Walden 3."
The men were, for the most
part, left alone by the jail
guards, who were described as
fairly rigid. But the women were
harrassed hour after hour by
what one girl called the "irra
tionalities of prison matrons."
Almost every day the men
would conduct formal discus
sions or seminars, many on the
theory of non-violence. Gurley
led a discussion on the economic
problems of Communist China,
and another discussion covered
the value and danger of drugs.
"It was worth a year of col
lege," Kirkman remarked.

Except during three or four
head counts per day and after a
9:30 p.m. lights out, the men
were allowed outdoors. A bas
ketball court was adjacent to the
barrack.
"But one of the most fre
quent exercises," commented
Osborne, "especially among the
younger inmates, was yogi."
No Rehabilitation
Two of the girls released yes
terday admitted that they met
no one at Santa Rita who be
longed there.
"There was no rehabilitation
going on," said a 21-year-old art
student from San Francisco
State College. "People there
were merely serving time."
"Maybe the psychiatrist who
came around was an attempt at
rehabilitation," another re
marked. "Only this psychiatrist
needed another psychiatrist."
Over 80 anti-war demonstra
tors, including Stanford students
and faculty, left Santa Rita Re
habilitation Center early yester
day morning after serving 10-
day jail sentences, most of them
for disturbing the peace last
week in Oakland.
Almost 200 friends and rela
tives were on hand to greet the
ex-inmates. Many brought
flowers. Some offered cookies
and tea as the anti-war cam
paigners piled off two buses in
the jail's parking lot shortly be
fore 9 a.m.
A car caravan of Stanford stu
dents met members of the Stan
ford community released from
Santa Rita.
Former student body presi
dent Dave Harris, a leader of
the Resistance who was arrested
two days later than yesterday's
demonstrators, will not be re
leased until Saturday morning.
'We'll Go Again'
Almost all of the demonstra
tors, when asked to comment
on their protest and punishment
agreed on two things. First,
they believe that non-vio

fective than violence in accom
plishing what they are trying to

Furthermore, most are total

Gurley, editor of the American
Economic Review and co-author
of Money in a Theory of Fi
nance, remarked, "I don't think
what we've done will directly
influence Johnson, Rusk, or Mc-
Namara.
"But there are millions of peo
ple who are neutral to the Viet
nam War yet disturbed by it. I
hope my participating in these
anti - war demonstrations and
spending 10 days in jail will dis
turb these hesitant people even
more and get them to speak out
against the war."
Emeritus Prof. Hadley Kirk
man, 66, who taught anatomy
30 years and is now doing can
cer research at Stanford, feels
that his term in Santa Rita was
not as effective as the demon

strations leading up to his sen
tence.
Like Gurley, he hopes that his
actions will stir neutral war ob
servers. "I feel," he said, "that
the more participants we have,
the better are the chances of
abolishing the war.
"I am not as young as most
demonstrators, and my health
not as good as theirs. But as
long as I am physically capable,
I will continue to participate in
similar anti-war demonstrations.
"War is a luxury which na
tions can no longer afford to in
dulge in, especially this war,
which could lead to another
World War and the complete
annihilation of life."
Neither Dr. Kirkman or Gur
ley feel that their actions and
jail sentences affect their posi
tions as members of the Stan
ford faculty.

"As far as I know," remarked
Gurley, "through calls my wife
received and people she spoke
with, virtually all members of
the economics department have
stated their support. As far as
my jail sentence is concerned, I
feel disturbing the peace is a
relatively minor offense."
Dr. Kirkman noted that over
half of the anatomy department
is distinctly conservative, but
"in spite of this I received as
surance of the department's
complete support. They sup
ported my opposition to the war
and defend my right to exercise
my beliefs."
Other Stanford professors re
leased from Santa Rita yester
day included Dr. Genevieve
Knupfer, 53, a professor of the
Medical School; Dr. Robert
Spitzer, 41, a clinical instructor
at the Medical School; and Dr.

Lelland Rather, 53, a pathologist
and professor of medicine.
Almost a dozen other faculty
and students, whose names were
not immediately available, were
released yesterday.
No Ideas, Please
From a distance yesterday,
the green and white buildings of
the Santa Rita Rehabilitation
Center gave it the appearance of
a military base.
The men and women demon
strators were completely sepa
rated from each other in more
or less U-shapcd barracks.
The protestors were also kept
apart from other prisoners at
Santa Rita. The reason given for
this separation was protection
from the other prisoners, who
might feel hostile toward the
demonstrators.
But Seldon Osborne, a 56-year

old longshoreman from Oakland
claimed, "our group soon had
the supposition that the jail
didn't want us giving the other
prisoners any anti-war ideas."
A sign in the men's quarters
greeted new prisoners with the
words, "Welcome to Walden 3."
The men were, for the most
part, left alone by the jail
guards, who were described as
fairly rigid. But the women were
harrassed hour after hour by
what one girl called the "irra
tionalities of prison matrons."
Almost every day the men
would conduct formal discus
sions or seminars, many on the
theory of non-violence. Gurley
led a discussion on the economic
problems of Communist China,
and another discussion covered
the value and danger of drugs.
"It was worth a year of col
lege," Kirkman remarked.

Except during three or four
head counts per day and after a
9:30 p.m. lights out, the men
were allowed outdoors. A bas
ketball court was adjacent to the
barrack.
"But one of the most fre
quent exercises," commented
Osborne, "especially among the
younger inmates, was yogi."
No Rehabilitation
Two of the girls released yes
terday admitted that they met
no one at Santa Rita who be
longed there.
"There was no rehabilitation
going on," said a 21-year-old art
student from San Francisco
State College. "People there
were merely serving time."
"Maybe the psychiatrist who
came around was an attempt at
rehabilitation," another re
marked. "Only this psychiatrist
needed another psychiatrist."
