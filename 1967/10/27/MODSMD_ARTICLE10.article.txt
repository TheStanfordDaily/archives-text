# Two Minutes of Haight
## A 						New Oakland Demonstration 
### Tim Haight 
We must return to the Oak
land Induction Terminal. Last
week taught the people there a
number of lessons—about police
brutality, our own ability to act
sometimes without thinking, the
impassivity of the city itself.
Now we must put what we have
learned into action.
We must return to talk —with
cops, people on the street, news
men. Specifically, we should use
the parking lot across from the
center as a base for groups of
two or three people to go out
around the city and talk about
the war.
We must make contact. Some
of us saw people in Oakland
last week who were turned on
with so many of us being there,
demonstrating our beliefs, or
just "livening things up." But
we were aliens, descending from
our ivory towers.
There were some admirable
meetings of minds, as when a
truck driver volunteered his
truck to block an intersection,
but there were many hostile re
actions, too. And too many peo
ple stared but did not under
stand.
C ounter-Influenee
Perhaps this sounds too peace
ful, too uneventful to rate the
international coverage that last
week's events got. But it would
have advantages. First, it would
be a counter-influence to the im
pression that the peace move
ment has degenerated into let
ting the air out of car tires.
That is an unfair picture of
what happened last Friday, let
alone what happened on each
day last week, but the media has

sifted and summarized as it al
ways does.
More important than "clean
ing up our image", however, is
the effect this tactic would have
on the participants in the dem
onstration.
Become Articulate Again
It would force us to regain
the articulateness many of us
have lost in our rising frustra
tion about the war. It would
give us challenges of communi
cation rather than challenges of
riot tactics. It would afford us
flexibility in our approach—who
ever had his own thing to say
could find his streetcorner audi
ence and say it. If every street
corner were filled, however, the
impression of our size would be
tremendous.
This tactic could go on over
time. It would not be a one-shot
affair, but a continuing thing.
We could learn what the people
felt.
This is important. Over and
over again, in the debate about
what was accomplished last
week we make generalizations
about how "the poor" or "the

black community" felt about it.
Why not go to them and find
out?
Tension Ruins Communication
In the tumult of Tuesday and
Friday last week, occasional in
cidents seemed almost beautiful
—a pretty girl talking to a cop
about war, until the cop was re
placed in the line for talking too
much. But for each of these suc
cesses the over-all air of tension
ruined ten more.
We must change from "zone"
to "man-to-man" tactics. We
must fact the policemen as in
dividuals, the people in Oakland
as co-sufferers under the system
of violence that chains us all.
A natural question at this
point is "Why Oakland?", and
it is a good one. There are peo
ple in Palo Alto, East Palo Alto,
even Shirley Temple's Wood
side, who are equally good audi
ences. And they would be easier
to reach (physically).
But Oakland is a symbol. Last
week what was going on there
moved a great many busy peo
ple to get up very early in the
morning.

And it seems to take some
symbol to get people to do that,
some glamor, some mythical ele
ment.
Playing A Bole
And it might make news.
In a way, though, that's bad.
Somehow, when we know some
stereotype of ourselves is going
to appear in the press, it's hard
er to be genuine. We do not try
to communicate with people,
but we play the role of some
noble soul trying to communi
cate with people.
Perhaps it would be better if
we just went out on our own.
But who would do it then? Few.
And we all feel the press for
size, publicity—the lack of time
while Vietnam burns. And Oak
land has another advantage. The
way things are going, the tac
tics of last week, probably all of
them, are going to be repeated
again, in the same place.
Those of us that anticipate
joining in those demonstrations
would do well to know the stage
on which those dramas will be
played and the people who will
surround us.
