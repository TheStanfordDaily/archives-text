## On A Cruise With The Governors 
### Art Buchwald 
I had the good fortune to be
one of the survivors of the gov
ernors cruise to the Virgin Is
lands on the USS Independence
last week, and it was truly a
memorable experience. It isn't
every day that a reporter has a
chance to get seasick with 45
governors of the United States.
The Three Rs were on board,
Rockefeller, Reagan and Rom
ney, and all of us naturally were
concerned with their presiden
tial plans. For three days all I
heard was, "It's Rocky, it's
Rocky." I didn't realize until I
got off that they were talking
about the ship and not the gov
ernor.
Gov. George Romney still
seemed to be suffering from the
effects of his brainwashing in
Vietnam, because I asked him
one morning, "Governor, how
are you enjoying the cruise?"
and he said, "What cruise?"

Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and
Ronald Reagan got the most at
tention. When Gov. Rockefeller
arrived at the pier with Happy,
he was besieged by newspaper
men, television cameras and ra
dio microphones. Gov. Lester
Maddox turned to a friend and
said, "You see what happens
when you have a million dol
lars?"
The cruise was twice blessed
because, besides Gov. Rockefel
ler, we also had Gov. Winthrop
Rockefeller on board. Laurance
Rockefeller, who owns large
chunks of the Virgin Islands,
was supposed to come also, but
Henry Diamond, who works for
him, explained, "Because of the
stake they have in them, Inter
nal Revenue Service won't al
low more than two Rockefellers
on any one ship at the same
time."
From President Johnson's
point of view, there has been
nothing like this cruise since the
Andrea Doria.
The main problem was com
munications, and you were
never sure when someone sent
you a telegram if you would be
the first person to read it. The
most dramatic example of this
was when Marvin Watson of the
White House sent a radiogram
to former Gov. Price Daniel on
board the ship, suggesting how
to twist Republican arms to get
through a resolution supporting
President Johnson in Vietnam.
The radiogram was "accidental
ly" delivered to Gov. Reagan be
cause his name sounds to much
like Daniel.
Gov. Reagan started reading
the telegram and then suddenly
realized it wasn't for him. So he
did the only honorable thing and
had it Xeroxed and distributed
to the press.
The Democrats were rather
embittered by this and accused
Reagan of violating the law as
well as reading somebody else's
mail. This upset the governor
from California no end because
he felt he had made a real effort
to return the cable to its right
ful owner. Besides, by Xeroxing
it, he was insuring there would
be a copy available for Daniel,
in case the wire got lost again.
But the White House didn't
see it that way. President John
son sent Daniel another wire
which said, "Who the hell killed
the albatross?"
To safeguard future commu
nications between the White
House and the Independence,
Watson had to swim out to the
ship every day and deliver them
by hand. Fortunately for the
country, Marv is a very good
swimmer.

to former Gov. Price Daniel on
board the ship, suggesting how
to twist Republican arms to get
through a resolution supporting
President Johnson in Vietnam.
The radiogram was "accidental
ly" delivered to Gov. Reagan be
cause his name sounds to much
like Daniel.
Gov. Reagan started reading
the telegram and then suddenly
realized it wasn't for him. So he
did the only honorable thing and
had it Xeroxed and distributed
to the press.
The Democrats were rather
embittered by this and accused
Reagan of violating the law as
well as reading somebody else's
mail. This upset the governor
from California no end because
he felt he had made a real effort
to return the cable to its right
ful owner. Besides, by Xeroxing
it, he was insuring there would
be a copy available for Daniel,
in case the wire got lost again.
But the White House didn't
see it that way. President John
son sent Daniel another wire
which said, "Who the hell killed
the albatross?"
To safeguard future commu
nications between the White
House and the Independence,
Watson had to swim out to the
ship every day and deliver them
by hand. Fortunately for the
country, Marv is a very good
swimmer.
I had the good fortune to be
one of the survivors of the gov
ernors cruise to the Virgin Is
lands on the USS Independence
last week, and it was truly a
memorable experience. It isn't
every day that a reporter has a
chance to get seasick with 45
governors of the United States.
The Three Rs were on board,
Rockefeller, Reagan and Rom
ney, and all of us naturally were
concerned with their presiden
tial plans. For three days all I
heard was, "It's Rocky, it's
Rocky." I didn't realize until I
got off that they were talking
about the ship and not the gov
ernor.
Gov. George Romney still
seemed to be suffering from the
effects of his brainwashing in
Vietnam, because I asked him
one morning, "Governor, how
are you enjoying the cruise?"
and he said, "What cruise?"

Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and
Ronald Reagan got the most at
tention. When Gov. Rockefeller
arrived at the pier with Happy,
he was besieged by newspaper
men, television cameras and ra
dio microphones. Gov. Lester
Maddox turned to a friend and
said, "You see what happens
when you have a million dol
lars?"
The cruise was twice blessed
because, besides Gov. Rockefel
ler, we also had Gov. Winthrop
Rockefeller on board. Laurance
Rockefeller, who owns large
chunks of the Virgin Islands,
was supposed to come also, but
Henry Diamond, who works for
him, explained, "Because of the
stake they have in them, Inter
nal Revenue Service won't al
low more than two Rockefellers
on any one ship at the same
time."
From President Johnson's
point of view, there has been
nothing like this cruise since the
Andrea Doria.
The main problem was com
munications, and you were
never sure when someone sent
you a telegram if you would be
the first person to read it. The
most dramatic example of this
was when Marvin Watson of the
White House sent a radiogram
to former Gov. Price Daniel on
board the ship, suggesting how
to twist Republican arms to get
through a resolution supporting
President Johnson in Vietnam.
