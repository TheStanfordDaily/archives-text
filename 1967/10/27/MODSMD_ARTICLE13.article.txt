# Students Protest CIA Recruiting
## 
### 
(CPS) — Campus protests
against recruiting and research
connected with the U.S. military
and the Central Intelligence
Agency continued to spread to
day with demonstrations in Colo
rado, Minnesota, Michigan, Il
linois and Ohio.
In Boulder, Colo., a demon

stration protesting the presence
of a recruiting agent for the
CIA nearly erupted into a riot
at the University of Colorado's
placement center.
University administrators did
not call in civil authorities to
handle the tense situation, but
they did promise to take disci

plinary action "up to and in
cluding suspension" against the
30 demonstrators who stood
shoulder • to • shoulder in front
of both entrances to the center.
The demonstrators, most of
them members of SDS, had ask
ed CIA agent Jack Hanson to
leave the campus on Monday.

He refused, and university of
ficials would not agree to ban
him from the campus.
No Alternative
The protestors then said they
had no alternative but civil dis
obedience. "The CIA has a past
record of dishonest meddling in
student organizations," one of
them said. "It has engineered
the overthrow of governments
hostile to the United States. Be
cause we feel dishonesty, secrecy
and totalitarian tactics have
nothing to contribute to the edu
cational enterprise we protest
their use of our campus faci
lities."
The near-riot occurred when
about 50 students wanting to
enter the placement office step
ped forward to physically chal
lenge the demonstrators block
ing the door. Violence was avert
ed when Prof. Clark Bouton and
a campus policeman calmed the
irate students.
Bouton, who said the demon
stration was justified and has
participated in several SDS pro
tests during the past week, may
also face disciplinary action.
A university regent told the
Colorado Daily he will ask for
a hearing on Bouton's conduct
to determine whether or not
he has "actively encouraged civil
disobedience on campus."
Detroit Demonstration
In Detroit 50 students, most
of them SDS members from
Wayne State University, demon
strated outside the Forrest H.
Raskin Educational Memorial,
which houses the University of
Michigan's Detroit extension div
ision.
Inside the fourth Annual De
fense and Government Procure
ment Conference (theme: "How
to get and keep your share of
defense business") was ending.
Between 300 and 400 business
men participated in the confer
ence, which featured speakers
from the armed services, includ
ing four generals.
On Tuesday, 13 of 14 demon
strators at the conference were
arrested when they entered the
building and shouted anti-war
slogans during a conference ses
sion.
Today the front door was lock
ed and only one demonstrator
was arrested.
He was picked up when dem
onstrators scuffled with the po
lice in an attempt to enter the
building through the back door.
Kicked In Groin
The protestors also fought
briefly with some of the busi
nessmen who were attending the
conference. One of the business

men reportedly kicked one of
the students in the groin, al
though the police were not able
to get any of the conference par
ticipants to admit to doing the
kicking.
Wayne State dean of students
Duncan Sells said the university
plans no disciplinary action
against the demonstrators. He
added that if requested he would
testify in court on behalf of the
students.
At the University of Illinois
campus recruitment by the Dow
Chemical Company was cancel
led for today and tomorrow by
the university after more than
200 protestors staged a sit-in in
the chemistry building today.
Interviews were halted at
about 10:30 this morning after
demonstrators jammed them
selves into doorways and into
the corridor outside the office
where Dow was recruiting. At
3:30 p.m. the university announ
ced that the interviews had been
cancelled "in order to avoid pos
sible bodily injury and destruc
tion of property."
Disciplinary Action
Chancellor J. W. Peltason
said the university would take
"appropriate disciplinary action"
against "all those persons who
have participated in this inter
ference with the educational
processes of the university."
During the early stages of the
demonstration an Illinois student
burned his draft card in front
of the Dow recruiter.
At the University of Minne
sota 40 students staged a sit-in
in the president's office, pro
testing the presence of a Dow
recruiter.
Twenty of the students plan
to spend the night in a regents
room in the administration build
ing, accompanied by four cam
pus policemen. No effort was
made to remove the students
from either place.
A Dow recruiter has been on
the campus since last week and
is scheduled to leave Thursday.
Fifteen of the students are stag
ing a 46-hour hunger strike,
which began Tuesday and will
end when the recruiter leaves.
A rally is scheduled for to
morrow to decide what further
action the students should take.
At Antioch College in Ohio
there was a brief demonstration
this morning in reaction to a
college committee's decision to
allow a defense department proj
ect to remain on the campus.
The demonstrators disagreed
over strategy and finally left the
site of the project to hold a gen
eral meeting at which several
committees were formed to
work against campus research.
