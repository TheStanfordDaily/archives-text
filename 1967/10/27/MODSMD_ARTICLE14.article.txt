# Lawrence V. Berman Named New Professor Of Religion
## 
### 
Stanford's religious studies
program has added Lawrence V.
Berman, associate professor of
religion to its faculty.
Mr. Berman, 38, is primarily
interested in medieval philos
ophy, Judaism and Islam, and
the interactions between them.
He sees a polarity between the
philosophies, "with Athens in
the middle and Jerusalem and
Mecca on the extremes. But
there is also a relationship be
tween Jerusalem and Mecca, re
sulting in a triangulation of
tensions."
He hopes to demonstrate this
polarity in his courses. His
course on "Judaism and Islam,"
Religion 136, to be taught Win
ter Quarter, specifically focuses
on the relationships between
these two faiths.
According to the new faculty
member, the course is intended
to do three things. "It will pro
vide the student with general in
formation about Judaism and
Islam, introduce tools of refer
ence so students can investi
gate problems on their own, and
finally, it will point out some
problems remaining for further
research."
One question particularly
fascinates Berman. He is inter
ested in reconstructing, in detail,
the influence of Greek philos
ophy on Hebrew thought in the
later Middle Ages. "It hasn't
been done for the later periods,

the 14th and 15th centuries, and
not for Spain and southern
France," he said.
Own Idea
Berman likes to incorporate
his own ideas into his courses.
"I like to think of my courses
as my own innovations," he
commented, "especially coming
to Stanford, where no courses
like this were given before. I
had a free hand, more or less.
It's a wide-open field. People
haven't written much on it so
it's much more interesting to go
into."
The two courses Mr. Berman
teaches this quarter are "Juda
ism" (Religion 134) and "Reas
on and Revelation in Islamic
Thought" (166). Winter Quar
ter he will teach his compara
tive course on "Judaism and
Islam" (136), together with
"Islam and Society" (167), a
study of the historian-philos
opher Ibn Khaldun. A course on
Maimonides is planned for
Spring Quarter.
Mr. Berman's background in
Judaism and Islam is highly
varied. He graduated from the
University of Chicago with hon
ors in philosophy, received his
master's at Brandeis University,
studied at the Sorbonne and won
the Ph.D. from the Hebrew Uni
versity, Jerusalem. In the past,
he has taught the Arabic and
Hebrew languages as well as his
courses on religion.

"I like to think of my courses
as my own innovations," he
commented, "especially coming
to Stanford, where no courses
like this were given before. I
had a free hand, more or less.
It's a wide-open field. People
haven't written much on it so
it's much more interesting to go
into."
The two courses Mr. Berman
teaches this quarter are "Juda
ism" (Religion 134) and "Reas
on and Revelation in Islamic
Thought" (166). Winter Quar
ter he will teach his compara
tive course on "Judaism and
Islam" (136), together with
"Islam and Society" (167), a
study of the historian-philos
opher Ibn Khaldun. A course on
Maimonides is planned for
Spring Quarter.
Mr. Berman's background in
Judaism and Islam is highly
varied. He graduated from the
University of Chicago with hon
ors in philosophy, received his
master's at Brandeis University,
studied at the Sorbonne and won
the Ph.D. from the Hebrew Uni
versity, Jerusalem. In the past,
he has taught the Arabic and
Hebrew languages as well as his
courses on religion.

associate professor of religion.
Stanford's religious studies
program has added Lawrence V.
Berman, associate professor of
religion to its faculty.
Mr. Berman, 38, is primarily
interested in medieval philos
ophy, Judaism and Islam, and
the interactions between them.
He sees a polarity between the
philosophies, "with Athens in
the middle and Jerusalem and
Mecca on the extremes. But
there is also a relationship be
tween Jerusalem and Mecca, re
sulting in a triangulation of
tensions."
He hopes to demonstrate this
polarity in his courses. His
course on "Judaism and Islam,"
Religion 136, to be taught Win
ter Quarter, specifically focuses
on the relationships between
these two faiths.
According to the new faculty
member, the course is intended
to do three things. "It will pro
vide the student with general in
formation about Judaism and
Islam, introduce tools of refer
ence so students can investi
gate problems on their own, and
finally, it will point out some
problems remaining for further
research."
One question particularly
fascinates Berman. He is inter
ested in reconstructing, in detail,
the influence of Greek philos
ophy on Hebrew thought in the
later Middle Ages. "It hasn't
been done for the later periods,

the 14th and 15th centuries, and
not for Spain and southern
France," he said.
