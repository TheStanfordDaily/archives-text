# SLAC Gets Most Powerful Magnet
## 
### 
The world's mightiest electron
accelerator has been equipped
with the world's most powerful
superconducting magnet.
"The biggest research ma
chines require the most power
ful tools," explained Dr. Habibo
Brechna, leader of the magnet
research group which built the
supermagnet at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
In recently completed tests, he
added, the 5,000-pound magnet
generated a 70,000-gauss field
with an energy of five million
joules in its cylindrical, 12-inch
diameter by 27-inch-long bore.
This is equivalent to the ex
plosive energy of nearly three
pounds of TNT, or of enough
electric power to light up 50,000
100-watt lamps. It is 140,000
times stronger than the earth's
magnetic field.
Yet the SLAC magnet oper
ates on a mere 4,000 watts be
cause electric current is con
ducted almost without loss
through its more than 11 miles
of superconductive cable wind
ings. A conventional, water
cooled magnet of such strength
would require 16 million watts
of power and about 1500 gallons
of water per minute.
Like other huge detection in
struments built for the two-mile,
20-billion-volt linear accelerator,
the magnet will be used in high
energy experiments designed to
reveal more about the structure
of matter. And like the rest of
SLAC activities, its construc
tion was financed by the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission.
$150,000 Investment
The superconducting magnet,
with its six coils and associated
"cryogenic" refrigeration equip
ment, was designed and built in
15 months by the research group
under Dr. Brechna. The cost was
approximately $150,000. A com

parable magnet of conventional
design would be "economically
unsound," he said.
Superconductivity causes met
als and some alloys to lose their
resistance to electric current
flow when they are cooled to
temperatures near absolute zero
(459.7° Fahrenheit).
While most pure metals lose
their superconductivity when
subjected to magnetic fields,
some alloys such as niobium- ti
tanium and niobium-tine retain
their superconductive properties
even in very high magnetic
fields. The niobium-titanium of
the SLAC magnet's cables be
comes superconductive at -440°
F.
Ultra-low temperature Is at
tained by immersing the magnet
coils in 350 liters (about 100 gal
lons) of liquid helium. Approxi
mately 14 liters per hour boil off
due to power losses which heat
up non-superconducting parts of
the apparatus. An elaborate
system of tanks and pumps is

used to handle the helium in
both its liquid and gaseous
states, so that most is recovered
and re-used.
Now the research group has
designed an even more efficient
superconductor, they believe,
with which they hope to build
even larger magnets that will be
needed in future accelerator re
search.
The newer conductor is a cop
per tube with the superconduct
ing filaments buried all through
its walls. Liquid helium circu
lating through the hollow core
will provide adequate refrigera
tion, thereby eliminating the
helium bath and requiring far
smaller quantities of the costly
liquid.
Already under study is a 70,-
000-gauss superconducting mag
net with a bore approximately
five feet in diameter and over
six feet long. A conventional
magnet of such size would re
quire more than 50 million watts
of power to operate.

tions of the magnet Each section consists of three coils of super
conducting cable surrounding a 12-inch-diameter by 27-inch-long
bore where the magnet's 70,000-gauss, five-million-joule field is con
centrated. The cylinder at top is a high-vacuum thermal "plug"
which seals the magnet in its 14-foot-long, stainless steel dewar or
vacuum bottle sunk into the ground below. The dewar is filled with
liquid helium (seen boiling off) in which the coil is immersed to
lower it to the superconducting temperature of -440 Fahrenheit.

with an energy of five million
joules in its cylindrical, 12-inch
diameter by 27-inch-long bore.
This is equivalent to the ex
plosive energy of nearly three
pounds of TNT, or of enough
electric power to light up 50,000
100-watt lamps. It is 140,000
times stronger than the earth's
magnetic field.
Yet the SLAC magnet oper
ates on a mere 4,000 watts be
cause electric current is con
ducted almost without loss
through its more than 11 miles
of superconductive cable wind

cooled magnet of such strength
would require 16 million watts
of power and about 1500 gallons
of water per minute.
Like other huge detection in
struments built for the two-mile,
20-billion-volt linear accelerator,

$150,000 Investment
The superconducting magnet,
with its six coils and associated
"cryogenic" refrigeration equip
ment, was designed and built in
15 months by the research group
under Dr. Brechna. The cost was
approximately $150,000. A com

parable magnet of conventional
design would be "economically
unsound," he said.
Superconductivity causes met
als and some alloys to lose their
resistance to electric current
flow when they are cooled to
temperatures near absolute zero
(459.7° Fahrenheit).
While most pure metals lose
their superconductivity when
subjected to magnetic fields,
some alloys such as niobium- ti
tanium and niobium-tine retain
their superconductive properties
even in very high magnetic
fields. The niobium-titanium of
the SLAC magnet's cables be
comes superconductive at -440°
F.
Ultra-low temperature Is at
tained by immersing the magnet
coils in 350 liters (about 100 gal
lons) of liquid helium. Approxi
mately 14 liters per hour boil off
due to power losses which heat
up non-superconducting parts of
the apparatus. An elaborate
system of tanks and pumps is

used to handle the helium in
both its liquid and gaseous
states, so that most is recovered
and re-used.
Now the research group has
designed an even more efficient
superconductor, they believe,
with which they hope to build
even larger magnets that will be
needed in future accelerator re
search.
The newer conductor is a cop
per tube with the superconduct
ing filaments buried all through
its walls. Liquid helium circu
lating through the hollow core
will provide adequate refrigera
tion, thereby eliminating the
helium bath and requiring far
smaller quantities of the costly
liquid.
Already under study is a 70,-
000-gauss superconducting mag
net with a bore approximately
five feet in diameter and over
six feet long. A conventional
magnet of such size would re
quire more than 50 million watts
of power to operate.

ates on a mere 4,000 watts be
cause electric current is con
ducted almost without loss
through its more than 11 miles
of superconductive cable wind
ings. A conventional, water
cooled magnet of such strength
would require 16 million watts
of power and about 1500 gallons
of water per minute.
Like other huge detection in
struments built for the two-mile,
20-billion-volt linear accelerator,
the magnet will be used in high
energy experiments designed to
reveal more about the structure
of matter. And like the rest of
SLAC activities, its construc
tion was financed by the U.S.
Atomic Energy Commission.
$150,000 Investment
The superconducting magnet,
with its six coils and associated
"cryogenic" refrigeration equip
ment, was designed and built in
15 months by the research group
under Dr. Brechna. The cost was
approximately $150,000. A com

parable magnet of conventional
design would be "economically
unsound," he said.
Superconductivity causes met
als and some alloys to lose their
resistance to electric current
flow when they are cooled to
temperatures near absolute zero
(459.7° Fahrenheit).
While most pure metals lose
their superconductivity when
subjected to magnetic fields,
some alloys such as niobium- ti
tanium and niobium-tine retain
their superconductive properties
even in very high magnetic
fields. The niobium-titanium of
the SLAC magnet's cables be
comes superconductive at -440°
F.
Ultra-low temperature Is at
tained by immersing the magnet
coils in 350 liters (about 100 gal
lons) of liquid helium. Approxi
mately 14 liters per hour boil off
due to power losses which heat
up non-superconducting parts of
the apparatus. An elaborate
system of tanks and pumps is

used to handle the helium in
both its liquid and gaseous
states, so that most is recovered
and re-used.
Now the research group has
designed an even more efficient
superconductor, they believe,
with which they hope to build
even larger magnets that will be
needed in future accelerator re
search.
The newer conductor is a cop
per tube with the superconduct
ing filaments buried all through
its walls. Liquid helium circu
lating through the hollow core
will provide adequate refrigera
tion, thereby eliminating the
helium bath and requiring far
smaller quantities of the costly
liquid.
Already under study is a 70,-
000-gauss superconducting mag
net with a bore approximately
five feet in diameter and over
six feet long. A conventional
magnet of such size would re
quire more than 50 million watts
of power to operate.


WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL superconducting magnet is shown
during tests at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center with tech
nician Waiter Kapica, whose hand rests between the two main sec
tions of the magnet Each section consists of three coils of super
conducting cable surrounding a 12-inch-diameter by 27-inch-long
bore where the magnet's 70,000-gauss, five-million-joule field is con
centrated. The cylinder at top is a high-vacuum thermal "plug"
which seals the magnet in its 14-foot-long, stainless steel dewar or
vacuum bottle sunk into the ground below. The dewar is filled with
liquid helium (seen boiling off) in which the coil is immersed to
lower it to the superconducting temperature of -440 Fahrenheit.
The world's mightiest electron
accelerator has been equipped
with the world's most powerful
superconducting magnet.
"The biggest research ma
chines require the most power
ful tools," explained Dr. Habibo
Brechna, leader of the magnet
research group which built the
supermagnet at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).
In recently completed tests, he
added, the 5,000-pound magnet
generated a 70,000-gauss field
with an energy of five million
joules in its cylindrical, 12-inch
diameter by 27-inch-long bore.
This is equivalent to the ex
plosive energy of nearly three
pounds of TNT, or of enough
electric power to light up 50,000
100-watt lamps. It is 140,000
times stronger than the earth's
magnetic field.
