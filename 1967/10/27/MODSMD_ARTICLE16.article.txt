## 
### 
Walter Wagoner, former di
rector of the "Trial Year in Sem
inary," will explain the program
to interested students at a din
ner meeting Tuesday in Tresid
der.
Sponsored by the Rockefeller
Brothers Theological Fellow
ship Program and the Booth
Ferris Fellowship Program, th?
"Trial Year" finances a year of
study in an accredited Protes
tant seminary.
Information about the pro
gram and dinner may be ob
tained and dinner reservations
secured today in the Memorial
Chapel office.
About 70 fellowships are an
nually awarded to students who
will seriously consider the min
istry as a vocation but who
would not attend a seminary
without the fellowship. Candi
dates must be male citizens of
the U.S. or Canada and under
thirty years old. Denomination,
college, and race are not con
sidered.
Timothy Buxton, assistant to
the dean of the chapel, says this
year for perhaps the first time a
Catholic will be seeking the
award.
Participants are not obligated
to continue in theological school
and are sponsored for only one
year; however, about a third do
complete their studies.
