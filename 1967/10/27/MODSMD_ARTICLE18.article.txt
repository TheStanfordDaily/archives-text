# University Enrollment Up Due To More Grad Students
## 
### 
Enrollment at Stanford Uni
versity is up 1.5 per cent over
last year according to figures re
leased by the Registrar's office.
The total enrollment is 12,175
students as opposed to 12,010
students last year. This includes
618 Terminal Graduate Students
not usually included in the en
rollment figures.
The Terminal Graduate Stu
dents increased their number
by almost 7 per cent over last
year. The graduate students in
creased by 2.4 per cent and the
undergraduates remained un
changed in number.
A Terminal Graduate Student
is one who has completed the

unit and residence requirements
for an advanced degree and has
a fee to the University in order
to have the privilege of the Uni
versity.
The trend in recent years has
been for the graduate enroll
ment to increase rapidly while
the undergraduate total has re
mained essentially unchanged.
Harvey Hall, the Registrar of
the University, stated that grad
uate enrollment will eventually
level off. He said that a "board
level" devision had been made
to hold the total enrollment to
12,000.
The total enrollment, including
Terminal Graduate Students
passed that level last year.
