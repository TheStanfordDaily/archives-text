# Roadsters Rumble And Roar In Lagunita Seca Tomorrow
## 
### 
Lake Lagunita will again be
the testing ground for many
weird and way-out machines, as
Zeta Psi presents the Fifth An
nual Lagunita Seca Road Race,
tomorrow at I p.m.
This year, the entries total
33, ten more than last year's
contest attracted. The three di
visions are Domestic, American
models; Foreign, including
many exotic sports cars; and
Powder Puff, either domestic or
foreign cars driven by Stanford
dollies. Each entrant must pay
a ten dollar entrance fee.
This year the prizes will be

the traditional "keg container of
chilled, premium domestic beer"
for the living group sponsoring
the winner, and a mug engraved
with his name and division for
the winning driver.
In addition, there will be a
special "Concours d'Elegance"
competition with a prize, as yet
undisclosed, awarded to "the
outstandingly designed and dec
orated car."
The course is about a half
mile long with two four-foot
jumps, a 360 degree turn and a
"pit" six to eight feet deep. The
lake bed is very dry and fast,

and will be dragged and watered
down after every fourth run.
Crothers Memorial is expected
to make a fine showing since
it has won the domestic division
for the past two years.
The lake will be open Satur
day morning for practice runs.
All drivers will be required to
wear seat belts and helmets.
Refreshments will be avail
able on the lake and the latest
football scores will be an
nounced during the afternoon.
Anyone wishing additional in
formation should call or con
tact Brad Alden at Zeta Psi,
327-9461.
