# From Santa Rita
## Joan Baez Released 
### 
Folksinger Joan Baez was re
leased from Santa Rita Rehabili
tation Center yesterday after
serving 10 days for taking part
in the Oakland anti-draft dem
onstrations last week.
She was arrested with about
125 other protesters on the first
day of the anti-draft effort.
Charges against demonstrators
included trespassing, disturbing
the peace, and creating a public
nuisance.
Miss Baez, calling her first ar
rest and jailing enjoyable, re

ferred to it as "an incredible ex
perience." "It was worth it," she
said. "I probably will do it
again."
Also released were the sing
er's mother, her younger sister,
Mimi Farina, and Miss Baez' ad
visor, Ira Sandperl.
All served 10-day jail sentences
without option of fines. Bail had
been set at $220 for each charge.
"Treated Fine"
Miss Baez had garden duty at
the prison. "We were treated
fine," she said. "It was one of
the best things I have done in
my life."
According to the singer's
mother, the pacifists mowed
peace symbols into the grass
they were assigned to cut. They

also stitched peace messages
into mending and discussed non
violence with other prisoners.
A long time pacifist, Miss
Baez has refused to pay that
part of her income tax she be
lieves the government uses for
defense.
On her release, the singer
turned from photographers and
newsmen and sang to inmates
clustered behind the prison
fence. They in turn shouted
"Come back and see us again,
Joanie. We love you."
Dr. Albert Baez, the singer's
father, and her older sister, Mrs.
Pauline Marden were among al
most 200 people gathered to
greet those released.
Miss Baez has a concert tour
starting in two days. She has no
further plans for protests, she
said, but indicated no change in
her feelings against the draft
and the war.
