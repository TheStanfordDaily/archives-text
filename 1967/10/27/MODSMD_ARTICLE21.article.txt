WACO, Tex. (AP) â€” A Bay
lor University student being ini
tiated into a campus service
club died recently and the school
immediately banned all physical
hazing.
John Everett Clifton, 19 years
old, accidentally "drowned in his
own juices," said Justice of the
Peace Joe Johnson, who an
nounced the autopsy findings.
Clifton had been required as
part of the initiation to drink a
mixture of laxatives and garlic,
as had the nine other students
being initiated into the Baylor
Chamber of Commerce, the offi
cial said.
The Baylor Chamber of Com
merce is the oldest on the cam
pus. It has no connection with
city chambers of commerce ex
cept in concept, a Baylor spokes
man said.
