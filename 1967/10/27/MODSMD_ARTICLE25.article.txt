# Tribe Invades East To Pacify Cadets
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford football coach John
Ralston has gone on record say
ing that the PAC-8 is the best
football conference in the coun
try.
The Indians get a chance to
back up that statement this Sat
urday when they represent the
west coast against the Cadets of
Army, the best team in the East,
Saturday in West Point's fabled
Michie Stadium at 2 p.m. (EDT).
Intersectional Edge
Stanford seems to have a spe
cial knack for winning inter
sectional contests. The Cards

have won their last five in a row,
and the last eight in nine deci
sions.
The Tribe holds a 3-2 edge in
a series that dates back to 1928,
and also won the last game with
the Cadets in 1965, 31-14.
Although tradition seems to
favor the Indians, sports ana
lysts do not. Stanford is a three
point underdog to an Army team
that is 4-1 on the season and
has a win over tough SMU un
der its belt.
Stanford's offense has ex
ploded in the last two games un
der the leadership of quarter

back Chuck Williams. The
Indians rolled for a total of 450
yards against UCLA last Satur
day.
Army Defense Strong
But Army's strength lies in
its defense, which has 15 inter
ceptions so far and has limited
opponents to two touchdowns in
the last three games.
Leading the Cadet defenders
is captain Bohdan Neswiacheny,
a 6-3, 210 pounder who plays
tackle or linebacker depending
on the situation.
Army coach Tom Cahill, the
"Coach of the Year" in 1966, has

reason for optimism in tomor
row's game. A team consisting
mostly of sophomores went 8-2
last year, and has kept all soph
omores from starting this year.
Lindell Dangerous
Steve Lindell guides the ex
perienced Cadet team at quar
terback, and although he has
been hampered by injuries this
year, he is still the team leader
in passing and is second in rush
ing.
Lindell's favorite play is the
pass run option, and he has a
60 percent completion record to
remind Stanford defenders that
they can't come up to stop the
run too quickly.
Lindell's favorite target is
Terry Young, who has 21 recep
tions in four games this season.
Chuck Jarvis and three year
starter Carl Woessner are
powerful runners and an essen
tial part of the Army attack.
Cards Keep Spirits
Stanford comes off its best
team effort in several years. Al
though the Cards dropped a
heartbreaking 21-16 decision to
UCLA, they have had high spir
its throughout practices this
week and are eager to get on
the winning warpath again.
Returning to aid the Indian
receiving corps is split end Jim
Cross, who has 17 grabs in five
games.
He will provide extra prob
lems for the Cadet defenders,
who must handle one of the na
tion's fastest coming receivers,
Gene Washington.
Isolate Washington
Washington and Williams com
bined last week against UCLA
for nine completions and 99
yards. The fleet flanker has 24
grabs and 294 yards on the sea
son.
Coach Ralston and offensive
coach Dick Vermeil have plans
to isolate him one-on-one against
defenders so he can run with the
ball after he receives it.
Indian pass blocking has been
a major key to the improvement
of the aerial attack, but this
week the offensive line suffers
from the loss of one of the best
guards on the coast, Phil Mes
ser.

Messer's replacement Mike
Willard was slightly injured in
practice this week, but should
be OK for the Army fray.
Tackle Malcolm Snider is set to
repeat his fine performance
against UCLA.
The line is also bolstered by
earth-moving centers Don
Swartz and Tom Giallonardo,
who opened huge holes for half
back Nate Kirtman, and full
backs Greg Broughton and tri
captain Jack Root.
Solid Tribe Defense
On the defense, the Cards
have welded into a solid unit

that is making fewer mistakes
with every game. Ail-American
candidate Blaine Nye and twice
ina-row lineman of the game
Don Parish give authority to the
forward wall.
Tri-captain Marty Brill contin
ues to lead the team in tackles
from his linebacking spot with
46 stops, and sophomore Dick
Oliver is tied for third with Nye
with 33 tackles from his defen
sive halfback position.
Sophomore Pat Preston en
tered the lineup in the fourth
game against USC and has been
a gem since. He has two inter
ceptions and 40 tackles.
