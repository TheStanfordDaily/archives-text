# Papooses Seek Perfect Slate
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
Stanford's freshman football
team takes its unblemished rec
ord to Southern Cal this week
end, as they try to make it three
out of three on the season.
After an opening 41-12 win
over San Jose, and a 21-20 come
from-behind victory over UCLA,
Terry DeSylvia's Papooses are
confident and ready for the con
test.
When You're Out of Schultz .. .
Bad news for the mini-Tribe
is that halfback Jack Schultz
will not start against the Tro
babes. Schultz sustained a slight
knee injury against UCLA last
week.
The 195 pound halfback was
forced to leave the game in the
fourth quarter after gaining 188
yards in 26 carries. This yardage
augmented his season total to
358 yards in 51 carries, over 7
yards per carry.
Schultz will see limited action,
depending on how the game pro
gresses.
Starting in the backfield in
place of Schultz is Mark Brown.
Don Bunce will go at quarter
back, with Damea Washington
at flanker and Bill Honey at full
back if he is healthy.
Honey, whom DeSylvia char
acterizes as "an excellent block
ing back," has also carried the

ball 31 times for 168 yards. He
suffered a slight leg injury
against UCLA, but should be
ready to play.
Defense Sparkles
In the first two contests, the
Papoose defensive line has spar
kled. Enemy runners have found
it next to impossible to move
against Bill Alexander, Mark
Herrero, Wade Killifer, Tom
Jones, Larry Butler, and Phil
Satre.
Linebackers Tim McClure and
Jim Collings have helped plug
all holes.
Star UCLA frosh halfback
Mickey Cureton, who was "All
Everything" in high school, ex
perienced the Papoose stopping
power as he ran for "all of 30
yards in 10 carries."
Offense Ditto
The Indian frosh offensive
line has enabled the backs to
roll up 699 yards rushing in two
games. Steve Jubb is the center,

Pete Crosby and Charlie Saibel
go at guard, John Sande and
Jerry Srout are the tackles, and
Ron Kadziel is the tight end.
DeSylvia said that "the
strength of a freshman team
seems to depend almost entirely
on the strength of its offensive
and defensive lines. In this re
spect, we've done very well.

Both the players and coaches
Tim Sheehan and Mike Tierny
deserve a lot of credit."
Southern Cal's frosh have
their first game when they meet
the Indians. DeSylvia says he
doesn't know much about them,
but expects the Trobabes to be
much like the UCLA frosh, but
with a better line.

test.
When You're Out of Schultz .. .
Bad news for the mini-Tribe
is that halfback Jack Schultz
will not start against the Tro
babes. Schultz sustained a slight
knee injury against UCLA last
week.
The 195 pound halfback was
forced to leave the game in the
fourth quarter after gaining 188
yards in 26 carries. This yardage
augmented his season total to
358 yards in 51 carries, over 7
yards per carry.
Schultz will see limited action,
depending on how the game pro
gresses.
Starting in the backfield in
place of Schultz is Mark Brown.
Don Bunce will go at quarter
back, with Damea Washington
at flanker and Bill Honey at full
back if he is healthy.
Honey, whom DeSylvia char
acterizes as "an excellent block
ing back," has also carried the

ball 31 times for 168 yards. He
suffered a slight leg injury
against UCLA, but should be
ready to play.
Defense Sparkles
In the first two contests, the
Papoose defensive line has spar
kled. Enemy runners have found
it next to impossible to move
against Bill Alexander, Mark
Herrero, Wade Killifer, Tom
Jones, Larry Butler, and Phil
Satre.
Linebackers Tim McClure and
Jim Collings have helped plug
all holes.
Star UCLA frosh halfback
Mickey Cureton, who was "All
Everything" in high school, ex
perienced the Papoose stopping
power as he ran for "all of 30
yards in 10 carries."
Offense Ditto
The Indian frosh offensive
line has enabled the backs to
roll up 699 yards rushing in two
games. Steve Jubb is the center,

Pete Crosby and Charlie Saibel
go at guard, John Sande and
Jerry Srout are the tackles, and
Ron Kadziel is the tight end.
DeSylvia said that "the
strength of a freshman team
seems to depend almost entirely
on the strength of its offensive
and defensive lines. In this re
spect, we've done very well.

Both the players and coaches
Tim Sheehan and Mike Tierny
deserve a lot of credit."
Southern Cal's frosh have
their first game when they meet
the Indians. DeSylvia says he
doesn't know much about them,
but expects the Trobabes to be
much like the UCLA frosh, but
with a better line.
Stanford's freshman football
team takes its unblemished rec
ord to Southern Cal this week
end, as they try to make it three
out of three on the season.
After an opening 41-12 win
over San Jose, and a 21-20 come
from-behind victory over UCLA,
Terry DeSylvia's Papooses are
confident and ready for the con
test.
