# Cross Country: SJS Revenge
## 
### BOB RUND 
Sophomore Greg Brock will
lead Stanford against a strong,
but worried San Jose cross
country team this Saturday.
Although San Jose shut out
the Tribe 15 to 50 in last year's
dual meet and defeated them 48
to 88 at this year's Sacramento
Invitational, the Spartans seem
very concerned about the In
dian's rapid improvement.
San Jose's Coach Banks was
worried enough to scout the
Stanford-UCLA meet Saturday,
and to question Tribe harriers
and ex-harriers as to the team's
strengths and weaknesses. He
even asked advice on how the
course should be run.
Tribe Lineup
Brock, eighth on Stanford's
All Time Top Ten with 20:42.5,
will be closely followed by ninth
ranking Jim Letterer with 20:46,
tenth ranking Brook Thomas
with 21:05, and Allen Sanford
with 21:06.
Dave Redwine, who collapsed
against UCLA because of an
oxygen debt, is the Indians fifth
man. Chuck Menz and Gary
Montante round out the Tribe's
top seven.
Spartans To Be Displaced?
Although San Jose's Daryl
Dent, individual winner at Saca
mento, ranks as the favorite in
Saturday's meet, the Indians are
capable of placing four men in
front of San Jose's second man.

At Sacramento San Jose
placed first, ninth, eleventh,
thirteenth, fourteenth, and had
a sixth man Ralph Gamez in
sixteenth. Stanford placed sev
enth, eighth, seventeenth, eigh
teenth, and thirty-eighth. San
ford 17th and Letterer 18th both
have improved enough to beat
San Jose's second man if they
have a good race.
Mac Donald Leads Frosh
Duncan Mac Donald, a 4:11
miler from Hawaii, will lead the
Stanford Frosh against the San
Jose State freshmen. Stanford
defeated the Spartans 75 to 346
in the Freshman University di
vision of the Sacramento Invi
tational.
Mac Donald now ranks fourth
on the all-time Top 10 Frosh
Harrier list. Don Kardong is
sixth and Brian Cox ninth. Jay
Rice and Mark Jones are the
freshmen's fourth and fifth
men, with Pete Fairchild and
A 1 Smith rounding out the top
seven.
The Frosh race begins at 10
a.m. and the Varsity race gets
underway at 10:30 a.m. Both
will start at the second tee of
the Stanford golf course.
