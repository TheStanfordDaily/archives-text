## PA Hospital Plans Rejected 
### PAT McMAHON 
A hospital planning group has
rejected as impractical Palo
Alto's proposal that the Univer
sity build it a new hospital in
exchange for the city's share of
the Medical Center.
In a letter to City Manager
George Morgan, Dr. Robert J.
Glaser, Dean of the Medical
School and Vice President for
Medical Affairs, said that he is
prepared to recommend to the
two proposals:
• Stanford should buy Palo
Alto's interest in the present
facility, and provide land adja
cent to the Hoover Pavilion (now
a Palo Alto patient care center
located off Palm Drive on the
campus) for construction of a

Palo Alto Community Hospital,
or
• Stanford should sell its
share of the present facility
with the first option to buy go
ing to the city, and build "its
new teaching hospital and ambu
latory care center either to the
south or to the west of the pres
ent Medical Center, on land al
ready owned by the University."
The proposals made by the
hospital staff reflect the desire
that the hospital pull out of the
Palo Alto - Stanford Hospital
agreement as soon as possible
in an effort to provide 450-500
beds needed as a teaching hos
pital.
The University will build a
new teaching hospital if it can
not purchase the Palo Alto share

of the facility and thereby gain
the necessary beds. A half mil
lion dollar grant has already
been secured by the Medical
School for planning a new hospi
tal, and the hospital is anxious
to use it or return it.
In a report to the City Coun
cil issued Wednesday, Morgan
outlined the various alternatives
that the city now faces, and sug
gested a new proposal not con
sidered before.
Three Options
Morgan, in his report, point
ed out three options:
• "Stay in place." The city
could continue in its present
location in the Medical Center.
• "Sell the Palo Alto Pavilion
(of the hospital) to Stanford. Use
proceeds to convert Hoover Pavi
lion to a self-sufficient Commu
nity Hospital."
• "Sell the Palo Alto Pavilion
and the Hoover Pavilion (includ
ing both leaseholds) to Stanford.
Use the proceeds to retire the
City's bond debt (for the hospi
tal) and for other non-hospital
municipal purposes — or — con
tribute all or part of the proceeds
toward construction of the Palo
Alto Clinic Hospital."
It is the last proposal that has
not been considered before. He
said in his report that it would
be "more feasible" to contribute
the assets "toward the construc
tion of the Palo Alto Clinic Hos
pital."
Palo Alto Clinic
The Palo Alto Clinic Hospital
is a hospital planned by and for
the doctors of the Palo Alto

Clinic and the Palo Alto Medical
Research Foundation.
Morgan noted in his report
that any agreement "would guar
antee the admission of all city
residents (or property-owners)
as patients and the admission of
all doctors with offices located
within the city."
Stanford officials were unavail
able for comment this afternoon
as to whether the University
would be interested in purchas
ing The Hoover Pavilion as well
as Palo Alto's share of the Med
ical Center.
Officers Resign
In. related action, the hospital
board of directors have announc
ed the resignation of two offi
cers.
Steve Kumagai, associate di
rector in charge of professional
departments, and Truman Thi
bodaux, hospital controller, re
signed to take positions at other
hospitals.
The board also received a five
point recommendation to im
prove the financial situation at
the hospital from the manager
of the San Francisco office of
Arthur Younger and Co., which
wr.s asked to do a complete au
dit of the hospital's books.
The financial problem at the
hospital has been caused by
Medicare and Medi-Cal cost pay
ment practices.
Hospital spokesmen denied
that Thibodaux's resignaition
had any connection with the hos
pital's bookkeeping problems. A
nationwide search is underway
to find a replacement for him.

A hospital planning group has
rejected as impractical Palo
Alto's proposal that the Univer

exchange for the city's share of
the Medical Center.
In a letter to City Manager
George Morgan, Dr. Robert J.
Glaser, Dean of the Medical
School and Vice President for
Medical Affairs, said that he is
prepared to recommend to the
two proposals:
• Stanford should buy Palo
Alto's interest in the present
facility, and provide land adja
cent to the Hoover Pavilion (now
a Palo Alto patient care center
located off Palm Drive on the
campus) for construction of a

Palo Alto Community Hospital,
or
• Stanford should sell its
share of the present facility
with the first option to buy go
ing to the city, and build "its
new teaching hospital and ambu
latory care center either to the
south or to the west of the pres
ent Medical Center, on land al
ready owned by the University."
The proposals made by the
hospital staff reflect the desire
that the hospital pull out of the
Palo Alto - Stanford Hospital
agreement as soon as possible
in an effort to provide 450-500
beds needed as a teaching hos
pital.
The University will build a
new teaching hospital if it can
not purchase the Palo Alto share

of the facility and thereby gain
the necessary beds. A half mil
lion dollar grant has already
been secured by the Medical
School for planning a new hospi
tal, and the hospital is anxious
to use it or return it.
In a report to the City Coun

outlined the various alternatives

Morgan, in his report, point

proceeds to convert Hoover Pavi
lion to a self-sufficient Commu
nity Hospital."
• "Sell the Palo Alto Pavilion
and the Hoover Pavilion (includ
ing both leaseholds) to Stanford.
Use the proceeds to retire the
City's bond debt (for the hospi
tal) and for other non-hospital
municipal purposes — or — con
tribute all or part of the proceeds
toward construction of the Palo
Alto Clinic Hospital."
It is the last proposal that has
not been considered before. He
said in his report that it would
be "more feasible" to contribute
the assets "toward the construc

pital."

It is the last proposal that has
not been considered before. He
said in his report that it would
be "more feasible" to contribute
the assets "toward the construc
tion of the Palo Alto Clinic Hos
pital."
Palo Alto Clinic
The Palo Alto Clinic Hospital
is a hospital planned by and for
the doctors of the Palo Alto

Clinic and the Palo Alto Medical
Research Foundation.
Morgan noted in his report
that any agreement "would guar
antee the admission of all city
residents (or property-owners)
as patients and the admission of
all doctors with offices located
within the city."
Stanford officials were unavail
able for comment this afternoon
as to whether the University
would be interested in purchas
ing The Hoover Pavilion as well
as Palo Alto's share of the Med
ical Center.
Officers Resign
In. related action, the hospital
board of directors have announc
ed the resignation of two offi
cers.
Steve Kumagai, associate di
rector in charge of professional
departments, and Truman Thi
bodaux, hospital controller, re
signed to take positions at other
hospitals.
The board also received a five
point recommendation to im
prove the financial situation at
the hospital from the manager
of the San Francisco office of
Arthur Younger and Co., which
wr.s asked to do a complete au
dit of the hospital's books.
The financial problem at the
hospital has been caused by
Medicare and Medi-Cal cost pay
ment practices.
Hospital spokesmen denied
that Thibodaux's resignaition
had any connection with the hos
pital's bookkeeping problems. A
nationwide search is underway
to find a replacement for him.
