# Close-Up Of An Oakland Protester
## 
### ROBIN KNIGHT 
Each weekend, for five con
secutive weekends, six Stanford
girls go to Santa Rita prison
to pay, in the company of drug
addicts and prostitutes, their
debt to society. One of these is
Dawn Meyners, 19 years old
from Chicago. In her case this
jail sentence seems little more
than a logical development to
what has gone before.
Articulate, self-possessed and
engagingly attractive, Dawn
comes from a committed home.
At present her parents live in
an integrated area in South Side
Chicago. Her father is a long
time pacifist and a theologian.
Dawn was working in Missis
sippi at the age of 17, Watts the
following year. This came after
two years connected with a
"peace-camp" in Germany, and

an educational background of
considerable diversity.
So it is possible to claim that
her involvement at Oakland was
inevitable. And since pacifism
and non-violence go together, it
was inevitable Dawn would be
arrested on Monday, not Tues
day, which she was. And that
civil disobedience against laws
she regards as morally unjust
will lead to further acts of de
fiance, which it probably will.
So one constructs a picture of
a dissenter that owes little to
revolutionary feeling, or disen
chantment with capitalist ideo
logy. Dawn, who lives in Flor
ence Moore Hall, is the anti-the
sis of that kind of demonstrator.
Her concern is conventional, yet
totally committed. It induces her
to take action, rather than to
mouth abstract platitudes.
Her involvement also means

sacrifice. At Stanford her prison
sentence has led to her dropping
a course this quarter. This is
a minor worry. But working in
Watts meant sacrificing idealism
to the practicalities of hatred,
intolerance and non-acceptance.
It gave her a belief in the power
of group dynamics that stood
her in good stead last Monday.
In itself being arrested, sentenc
ed, and convicted involves sac
rifice. Everyone could see quite
nakedly the use of power by
the government. Few illusions
about the reality of involvement
can resist this experience.
Conventional Idealist
Despite this, a well-developed
sense of service gives Dawn a
motive to resist and go on re
sisting. If one is to believe the
American and world press, most
demonstrators are but one re
moved from anarchists, Commu

nists, and destroyers of stability.
In so many cases the reality is
utterly different.
It is a seemingly overwhelm
ing concern with what older peo
ple have grown to regard as in
evitable that gives people like
Dawn Meyners an idealism that
may survive political intolerance.
As she says herself "I'm not
particularly political. I regard
myself as completely conven
tional in many ways. I want to
get married, have children — all
that sort of thing. But the other
side of me has to be accepted
also. I think they're quite com
patible."
Sitting in an Oakland doorway
with twenty-one other people
waiting to be arrested, Dawn

Meyners may have seemed just
like any other demonstrator —
or what people who don't dem
onstrate imagine demonstrators
are like. In fact she's very differ
ent, a part of the non-violent,
middle class, civil rights move
ment that has spilled over to
the assault on American foreign
policy in Vietnam.
In her case, a prison sen
tence is as relevant to her
crime, as the law is to ration
ality whenever confronted by
logical dissent that cannot be
intimidated by a show of force.
No doubt Dawn Meyners will
be demonstrating again in De
cember — conviction born from
experience will survive five week
ends in Santa Rita.
