# Middle Managers 'Insecure'
## 
### 
Middle managers may well
have become the most insecure
occupational group in contem
porary society, says an emeritus
professor of industrial relations
in the Graduate School of Busi
ness.
Prof. Dale Yoder, writing in
the fall 1967 edition of the Busi
ness School Bulletin, says that
middle managers, "with no te
nure, limited opportunities to
keep up with new developments,
no promotion system except that
of apple-polishing and boot-lick
ing, and no grievance procedure,
may have developed a sort of
depressive melancholia."
These men feel threatened by
"automation, quantification, and
are going to have to upgrade
humanization," he declares. They
themselves in skills, ability and
knowledge if they plan on being
around tomorrow. There are a
good many pressures on today's
managers to force their improve
ment, Prof. Yoder points out.
Rising Sophistication
"One is the rising level of so
phisticiation on the part of all
citizens"; another is "the inevit
able ascendancy of a credential
ed system in a growing, open
class society (like lawyers, doc
tors, and CPA's); and a third
is the fact that a good many of
today's employees are as well
or better educated and informed
as their managers.
"The managers must earn
their respect if they are to re
spect his leadership," Prof.
Yoder writes. "To the extent

that a manager acts like a robot,
he is likely to be replaced by
one. Up to now, this so-called
manager has been cheaper. But
he can lose out whenever IBM
and Control Data start a price
war."
So, tomorrow's manager must
be "more of a professional and
an applied scientist than ever
before."
He must develop "distinctive
specialized skills with which he
can translate relevant theory
into policy and practice in man
agement," and he must under
take "a determined, life-long
pursuit of self-improvement."
And the changes in modern
life themselves will help make
this possible, Prof. Yoder points
out.
Structural Tradition
"Once the iron hand of struc
tural tradition is relaxed, a whole
host of new channels for com
munication, evaluation, super
munication, evaluation, supervi
sion and negotiation comes into
view.
"Perhaps the most startling
effect will be the increase in or
ganizational flexibility and the
pace of organizational change.
The classic pyramid will become
one of many forms instead of
a sort of universal pattern.
"Tomorrow's manager will be
come much more of a diagnos
tician and much less of a patent
medicine man . . . more of a
creator and innovator and ex
perimenter and less of a copy
cat.

"The dominant trend is mov
ing beyond the earlier emphasis
upon a manipulative 'human
relations' toward the 'human re
sources' viewpoint. The essence
of the newer style is its recog
nition of the tremendous poten
tial in co-workers, and a clear
understanding of the advantages
to be gained from development
of that potential.

knowledge if they plan on being
around tomorrow. There are a
good many pressures on today's
managers to force their improve
ment, Prof. Yoder points out.
Rising Sophistication
"One is the rising level of so
phisticiation on the part of all
citizens"; another is "the inevit
able ascendancy of a credential
ed system in a growing, open
class society (like lawyers, doc
tors, and CPA's); and a third
is the fact that a good many of
today's employees are as well
or better educated and informed
as their managers.
"The managers must earn
their respect if they are to re
spect his leadership," Prof.
Yoder writes. "To the extent

that a manager acts like a robot,
he is likely to be replaced by
one. Up to now, this so-called
manager has been cheaper. But
he can lose out whenever IBM
and Control Data start a price
war."
So, tomorrow's manager must
be "more of a professional and
an applied scientist than ever
before."
He must develop "distinctive
specialized skills with which he
can translate relevant theory
into policy and practice in man
agement," and he must under
take "a determined, life-long
pursuit of self-improvement."
And the changes in modern
life themselves will help make
this possible, Prof. Yoder points
out.
Structural Tradition
"Once the iron hand of struc
tural tradition is relaxed, a whole
host of new channels for com
munication, evaluation, super
munication, evaluation, supervi
sion and negotiation comes into
view.
"Perhaps the most startling
effect will be the increase in or
ganizational flexibility and the
pace of organizational change.
The classic pyramid will become
one of many forms instead of
a sort of universal pattern.
"Tomorrow's manager will be
come much more of a diagnos
tician and much less of a patent
medicine man . . . more of a
creator and innovator and ex
perimenter and less of a copy
cat.

"The dominant trend is mov
ing beyond the earlier emphasis
upon a manipulative 'human
relations' toward the 'human re
sources' viewpoint. The essence
of the newer style is its recog
nition of the tremendous poten
tial in co-workers, and a clear
understanding of the advantages
to be gained from development
of that potential.
Middle managers may well
have become the most insecure
occupational group in contem
porary society, says an emeritus
professor of industrial relations
in the Graduate School of Busi
ness.
Prof. Dale Yoder, writing in
the fall 1967 edition of the Busi
ness School Bulletin, says that
middle managers, "with no te
nure, limited opportunities to
keep up with new developments,
no promotion system except that
of apple-polishing and boot-lick
ing, and no grievance procedure,
may have developed a sort of
depressive melancholia."
These men feel threatened by
"automation, quantification, and
are going to have to upgrade
humanization," he declares. They
themselves in skills, ability and
knowledge if they plan on being
around tomorrow. There are a
good many pressures on today's
managers to force their improve
ment, Prof. Yoder points out.
