# No Convention For Senate
## 
### 
The filial plan for a new fac
ulty senate will be drafted with
out the help of a constitutional
convention, as was suggested at
a faculty hearing, last week.
Professor Kenneth J. Arrow,
chairman of the Academic Coun
cil's executive committee, said
Wednesday that his nine-mem
ber group decided to draft the
senate plan by itself. "Informal
consultation on specific points"
will take place with faculty and
administrators.
The faculty senate plan, sup
ported unanimously by the Aca

demic Council in a straw vote
earlier this month, would create
a legislature of about 70 mem
bers to conduct the Academic
Council's business more effici
ently.
Arrow said the executive com
mittee has been meeting weekly
to discuss the faculty senate.
One major, undecided issue is
the system for representing the
various departments.
The executive committee
hopes to have a draft plan ready
for the Academic Council's con
