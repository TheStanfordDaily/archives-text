# SDSers Plan Protest Against CIA Recruiting
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The Stanford chapter of Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
will hold two rallies and a dem
onstration to protest Central
Intelligence Agency recruiting
on campus.
The CIA is holding job inter
views in the Placement Service
offices next Wednesday and
Thursday.
SDS has planned noon rallies
in White Plaza for Monday and
Tuesday. At the first meeting,
SDS members will "inform the
student body of some of the ac
tivities of the CIA," according
to spokesman John Avery.
Tuesday they will invite mem
bers of the administration and
the CIA to speak publicly with
them on the issues involved in
allowing the CIA on campus.
Planned for Wednesday, when
CIA interviews are due to be
held, is "at the very least, a very
noisy demonstration at the Place
ment Service center," according
to Avery, if neither the admini
stration nor the CIA has cancel
led the interviews.
Letter To Sterling
Meanwhile, the group has sent
a letter to President Wallace
Sterling demanding an end to
recruiting on campus by the
CIA and all "war-oriented" cor
porations.
The letter was handed to Pres
ident Sterling's secretary yester
day, according to the signer of
the letter, Richard Bogart.
"It was indicated to me by
a representative of the admini
stration that Sterling will have
received the letter by now,"
Avery said last night. Sterling
is presently out of town.
"I hope he takes action before

next Wednesday," Avery added,
"but I don't think he will."
In the letter, SDS asked that
the objectionable groups "gen
erally be denied the use of Stan
ford University facilities for the
purpose of propagandizing, re
cruitment and so-called defense
activities."
The letter also stated the SDS
members "feel that the activi
ties of these groups are anti
social in the extreme, that they
present a clear danger to soci
ety, and that their interests run
counter to those of an educa
tional institution."
It asked the administration to
halt CIA job interviews being
conducted in the Placement of
fice.
Spies On Campus
SDS said the ClA's presence
on university campuses "is us
ually directed towards spying
on students and faculty mem
bers and towards intimidation
of dissenters."
Avery and Bogart both said
there was a small possibility
SDS would commit civil dis
obedience to prevent the CIA
from holding its interviews.
They thought, however, such an
eventuality was highly unlikely.
The group plans to issue a

statement on the CIA at the
Monday rally. At the rally, they
will talk on "why the CIA is
anti-academic, is totalitarian in
nature and direction."
Avery commented, "A uni
versity should in some way try
focus on progressive forces in
the world and the CIA, I think
we will be able to prove, is quite
a reactionary force."

Much of the research by SDS
into the CIA is being done by
Andy Parnes, a graduate stu
dent in economics. Some of his
findings will de discussed at
Monday's rally.
SDS is hoping for a favorable
response to their letter from the
administration, however.
"If Sterling honestly feels
there will be trouble, since
there's not a great deal to be
gained by having CIA interviews
on campus, I'm sure he will
weigh the pros and cons. And
there's a possibility he will de
cide that it will be more advan
tageous to Stanford's name to
cancel the CIA interviews and
avoid conflict," Bogart stated.
He also said SDS has not yet
decided what action they will
take when Dow Chemical holds
interviews here in two weeks.
Dow is the only napalm produ
cer in the country.
Placement Service director
Ralph W. Keller had no com
ment on the planned picketing
of the CIA job interviews.
He stated, "Our reason for
existing here is to provide a ser
vice to the students in whatever

ways we can in their seeking
opportunities for employment,
so I think it's extremely impor
tant that we do not become in
volved in anything that causes
us to become targets of criti
cism."
University Policy
Keller also noted, "As far as
I know, the University policy
(on recruiting by organizations
such as the CIA) has been to
allow everyone to recruit here
who has recognizable potential
for employment for students
who are graduating or who
have graduated."
He went on to say, "As far as
I know, in no instance has any
organization from the U.S. gov
ernment been denied the oppor
tunity to recruit on campus."
Keller noted the CIA has been

recruiting here for several years,
but since he has been at Stan
ford for three years, he did not
know exactly how far back CIA
recruiting went.
He said Dow Chemical is sche
duled to be at the Graduate
School of Business Nov. 10, and
at the Placement Services Nov.
16 and 17. He stated there was
some picketing when Dow was
here last year.
The letter to Sterling was dis
cussed by the SDS at an open
meeting Wednesday night, along
with other proposals they are
planning to present to the ad
ministration.
These others have not yet been
submitted because it was de
cided more research was needed
on the topics in order to present
a detailed statement of the SDS
position to the University.

ford for three years, he did not
know exactly how far back CIA
recruiting went.
He said Dow Chemical is sche
duled to be at the Graduate
School of Business Nov. 10, and
at the Placement Services Nov.
16 and 17. He stated there was
some picketing when Dow was
here last year.
The letter to Sterling was dis
cussed by the SDS at an open
meeting Wednesday night, along
with other proposals they are
planning to present to the ad
ministration.
These others have not yet been
submitted because it was de
cided more research was needed
on the topics in order to present
a detailed statement of the SDS
position to the University.
The Stanford chapter of Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
will hold two rallies and a dem
onstration to protest Central
Intelligence Agency recruiting
on campus.
The CIA is holding job inter
views in the Placement Service
offices next Wednesday and
Thursday.
SDS has planned noon rallies
in White Plaza for Monday and
Tuesday. At the first meeting,
SDS members will "inform the
student body of some of the ac
tivities of the CIA," according
to spokesman John Avery.
Tuesday they will invite mem
bers of the administration and
the CIA to speak publicly with
them on the issues involved in
allowing the CIA on campus.
Planned for Wednesday, when
CIA interviews are due to be
held, is "at the very least, a very
noisy demonstration at the Place
ment Service center," according
to Avery, if neither the admini
stration nor the CIA has cancel
led the interviews.
Letter To Sterling
Meanwhile, the group has sent
a letter to President Wallace
Sterling demanding an end to
recruiting on campus by the
CIA and all "war-oriented" cor
porations.
The letter was handed to Pres
ident Sterling's secretary yester
day, according to the signer of
the letter, Richard Bogart.
"It was indicated to me by
a representative of the admini
stration that Sterling will have
received the letter by now,"
Avery said last night. Sterling
is presently out of town.
"I hope he takes action before

next Wednesday," Avery added,
"but I don't think he will."
In the letter, SDS asked that
the objectionable groups "gen
erally be denied the use of Stan
ford University facilities for the
purpose of propagandizing, re
cruitment and so-called defense
activities."
The letter also stated the SDS
members "feel that the activi
ties of these groups are anti
social in the extreme, that they
present a clear danger to soci
ety, and that their interests run
counter to those of an educa
tional institution."
It asked the administration to
halt CIA job interviews being
conducted in the Placement of
fice.
Spies On Campus
SDS said the ClA's presence
on university campuses "is us
ually directed towards spying
on students and faculty mem
bers and towards intimidation
of dissenters."
Avery and Bogart both said
there was a small possibility
SDS would commit civil dis
obedience to prevent the CIA
from holding its interviews.
They thought, however, such an
eventuality was highly unlikely.
The group plans to issue a

statement on the CIA at the
Monday rally. At the rally, they
will talk on "why the CIA is
anti-academic, is totalitarian in
nature and direction."
Avery commented, "A uni
versity should in some way try
focus on progressive forces in
the world and the CIA, I think
we will be able to prove, is quite
a reactionary force."

Much of the research by SDS
into the CIA is being done by
Andy Parnes, a graduate stu
dent in economics. Some of his
findings will de discussed at
Monday's rally.
SDS is hoping for a favorable
response to their letter from the
administration, however.
"If Sterling honestly feels
there will be trouble, since
there's not a great deal to be
gained by having CIA interviews
on campus, I'm sure he will
weigh the pros and cons. And
there's a possibility he will de
cide that it will be more advan
tageous to Stanford's name to
cancel the CIA interviews and
avoid conflict," Bogart stated.
He also said SDS has not yet
decided what action they will
take when Dow Chemical holds
interviews here in two weeks.
Dow is the only napalm produ
cer in the country.
Placement Service director
Ralph W. Keller had no com
ment on the planned picketing
of the CIA job interviews.
He stated, "Our reason for
existing here is to provide a ser
vice to the students in whatever

ways we can in their seeking
opportunities for employment,
so I think it's extremely impor
tant that we do not become in
volved in anything that causes
us to become targets of criti
cism."
University Policy
Keller also noted, "As far as
I know, the University policy
(on recruiting by organizations
such as the CIA) has been to
allow everyone to recruit here
who has recognizable potential
for employment for students
who are graduating or who
have graduated."
He went on to say, "As far as
I know, in no instance has any
organization from the U.S. gov
ernment been denied the oppor
tunity to recruit on campus."

tant that we do not become in
volved in anything that causes
us to become targets of criti
cism."
University Policy
Keller also noted, "As far as
I know, the University policy
(on recruiting by organizations
such as the CIA) has been to
allow everyone to recruit here
who has recognizable potential
for employment for students
who are graduating or who
have graduated."
He went on to say, "As far as
I know, in no instance has any
organization from the U.S. gov
ernment been denied the oppor
tunity to recruit on campus."
Keller noted the CIA has been

recruiting here for several years,
but since he has been at Stan
ford for three years, he did not
know exactly how far back CIA
recruiting went.
He said Dow Chemical is sche
duled to be at the Graduate
School of Business Nov. 10, and
at the Placement Services Nov.
16 and 17. He stated there was
some picketing when Dow was
here last year.
The letter to Sterling was dis
cussed by the SDS at an open
meeting Wednesday night, along
with other proposals they are
planning to present to the ad
ministration.
These others have not yet been
submitted because it was de
cided more research was needed
on the topics in order to present
a detailed statement of the SDS
position to the University.
The Stanford chapter of Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
will hold two rallies and a dem
onstration to protest Central
Intelligence Agency recruiting
on campus.
The CIA is holding job inter
views in the Placement Service
offices next Wednesday and
Thursday.
SDS has planned noon rallies
in White Plaza for Monday and
Tuesday. At the first meeting,
SDS members will "inform the
student body of some of the ac
tivities of the CIA," according
to spokesman John Avery.
Tuesday they will invite mem
bers of the administration and
the CIA to speak publicly with
them on the issues involved in
allowing the CIA on campus.
Planned for Wednesday, when
CIA interviews are due to be
held, is "at the very least, a very
noisy demonstration at the Place
ment Service center," according
to Avery, if neither the admini
stration nor the CIA has cancel
led the interviews.
Letter To Sterling
Meanwhile, the group has sent
a letter to President Wallace
Sterling demanding an end to
recruiting on campus by the
CIA and all "war-oriented" cor
porations.
The letter was handed to Pres
ident Sterling's secretary yester
day, according to the signer of
the letter, Richard Bogart.
"It was indicated to me by
a representative of the admini
stration that Sterling will have
received the letter by now,"
Avery said last night. Sterling
is presently out of town.
"I hope he takes action before

next Wednesday," Avery added,
"but I don't think he will."
In the letter, SDS asked that
the objectionable groups "gen
erally be denied the use of Stan
ford University facilities for the
purpose of propagandizing, re
cruitment and so-called defense
activities."
The letter also stated the SDS
members "feel that the activi
ties of these groups are anti
social in the extreme, that they
present a clear danger to soci
ety, and that their interests run
counter to those of an educa
tional institution."
It asked the administration to
halt CIA job interviews being
conducted in the Placement of
fice.
Spies On Campus
SDS said the ClA's presence
on university campuses "is us
ually directed towards spying
on students and faculty mem
bers and towards intimidation
of dissenters."
Avery and Bogart both said
there was a small possibility
SDS would commit civil dis
obedience to prevent the CIA
from holding its interviews.
They thought, however, such an
eventuality was highly unlikely.
The group plans to issue a

statement on the CIA at the
Monday rally. At the rally, they
will talk on "why the CIA is
anti-academic, is totalitarian in
nature and direction."
Avery commented, "A uni
versity should in some way try
focus on progressive forces in
the world and the CIA, I think
we will be able to prove, is quite
a reactionary force."

Much of the research by SDS
into the CIA is being done by
Andy Parnes, a graduate stu
dent in economics. Some of his
findings will de discussed at
Monday's rally.
SDS is hoping for a favorable
response to their letter from the
administration, however.
"If Sterling honestly feels
there will be trouble, since
there's not a great deal to be
gained by having CIA interviews
on campus, I'm sure he will
weigh the pros and cons. And
there's a possibility he will de
cide that it will be more advan
tageous to Stanford's name to
cancel the CIA interviews and
avoid conflict," Bogart stated.
He also said SDS has not yet
decided what action they will
take when Dow Chemical holds
interviews here in two weeks.
Dow is the only napalm produ
cer in the country.
Placement Service director
Ralph W. Keller had no com
ment on the planned picketing
of the CIA job interviews.
He stated, "Our reason for
existing here is to provide a ser
vice to the students in whatever

ways we can in their seeking
opportunities for employment,
so I think it's extremely impor
tant that we do not become in
volved in anything that causes
us to become targets of criti
