# Wilbur Hall Ends Sunday's Sit-Downs
## 
### MARY HAGAN 
An attempt by Wilbur resi
dents to reinstitute sit-down din
ner service on Sundays by hash
ing free of charge has been
ended due to opposition from
the Wilbur food service.
Volunteer hashing died a quick
death when after the October 8
and 15 dinners, Mrs. Kay Malik,
Wilbur food service director,
recommended to Mr. Joe Hig
gins, Wilbur Hall director, that
the experiment be ended.
Wilbur Hall is now the only
Stanford dormitory that has
cafeteria style meals exclusively.
Last year Higgins approved a
recommendation by sponsors,
faculty residents, tutors and the
individual house presidents to
discontinue seated service.
Higgins said the volunteer
hashing was creating problems
primarily within the food ser
vice. The service's major con
cern is providing the best ser

vice possible, he remarked, and
the experimental program left
the food service in "a state of
anxiety."
Mrs. Malik indicated she had
nothing to say about the situa
tion when first asked to com
ment. She later said that this
was her first year as food ser
vice director, and she had had
no part in the original decision.
She also declined comment on
the performance of the volun
teers, but she did say they could
have been of help had the same
people worked every Sunday.
Mr. Higgins said, "We all feel
better about the possibilities for
next quarter."
Two extra hashers were need
ed in each dining hall for the
Sunday dinners to bring bever
ages bccause milk cartons were
not on the tables as they are at
Stern. In defending her action,
Mrs. Malik said, "Milk cartons

and candlelight do not go to
gether."
Wednesday night a committee
of staff and students met with
Higgins, Mrs. Malik, and Mr.
William Myers, manager of the
University food service, to dis
cuss the problem. It now ap
pears that beginning winter
quarter individual houses will
have the option of what type of
service they want.
Since two houses are served
off the same food line, they will
have to decide in pairs if they
want cafeteria style, seated ser
vice, or, possibly, a combination
of the two. No method of choice
has been decided as yet, but the
students may possibly have
some voice in the matter.
In an interview Higgins cited
the overcrowded Wilbur dining
rooms, a hoped for increase in
the quality of the food, and a
more leisurely dining atmos
phere due to the extended din
ner hour as primary reasons for
the new type service.
Members of the Wilbur staff
had expressed concern that the
new arrangement would detract
from house unity by not giving
the residents a chance to meet
together. In answer to the cry
of the civilized-eating advocates,
Wilbur residents volunteered to
hash their own seated Sunday
evening meals.

Evidently not everyone is sat
isfied with the present arrange
ment. Although this reporter
heard only one jesting threat to
assassinate the head of the food
"service," a checker's remark
that there was "turmoil in the
kitchen" seems more appropri
ate.
When asked what he thought
of seated service for Sunday
dinners, a Wilbur freshman
clutched his carbonated beverage
glass and muttered, "Styrofoam
makes you sterile." The state of
the Wilbur food service, like
much else at Stanford, is one of
massive confusion.
The Wilbur residents them
selves divide three ways on the
question of seated service. The
first group carry into battle the
motto, "If we pay the same room
and board as everyone else, why
can't we have the same ser
vice?"
Glow Of Candlelight
Illuminated by the soft glow
of Sunday candlelight, Soto
House citizens complained that
more money was being spent in
Stern than in Wilbur. A tutor
said that if a choice were made,
he would rather see money be
ing spent on hall improvements
such as sound-proofing the
rooms than on seated service.
At present the men and women
in Wilbur are getting neither.

Sunday dinners to bring bever
ages bccause milk cartons were
not on the tables as they are at
Stern. In defending her action,
Mrs. Malik said, "Milk cartons

DINNER LINE-UP —Wilbur men lake all their meals in cafeteria style since Sunday sit-down dinners
were abolished early this year.
and candlelight do not go to
gether."
Wednesday night a committee
of staff and students met with
Higgins, Mrs. Malik, and Mr.
William Myers, manager of the
University food service, to dis
cuss the problem. It now ap
pears that beginning winter
quarter individual houses will
have the option of what type of
service they want.
Since two houses are served
off the same food line, they will
have to decide in pairs if they
want cafeteria style, seated ser
vice, or, possibly, a combination
of the two. No method of choice
has been decided as yet, but the
students may possibly have
some voice in the matter.
In an interview Higgins cited
the overcrowded Wilbur dining
rooms, a hoped for increase in
the quality of the food, and a
more leisurely dining atmos
phere due to the extended din
ner hour as primary reasons for
the new type service.
Members of the Wilbur staff
had expressed concern that the
new arrangement would detract
from house unity by not giving
the residents a chance to meet
together. In answer to the cry
of the civilized-eating advocates,
Wilbur residents volunteered to
hash their own seated Sunday
evening meals.

Evidently not everyone is sat
isfied with the present arrange
ment. Although this reporter
heard only one jesting threat to
assassinate the head of the food
"service," a checker's remark
that there was "turmoil in the
kitchen" seems more appropri
ate.
When asked what he thought
of seated service for Sunday
dinners, a Wilbur freshman
clutched his carbonated beverage
glass and muttered, "Styrofoam
makes you sterile." The state of
the Wilbur food service, like
much else at Stanford, is one of
massive confusion.
The Wilbur residents them
selves divide three ways on the
question of seated service. The
first group carry into battle the
motto, "If we pay the same room
and board as everyone else, why
can't we have the same ser
vice?"
Glow Of Candlelight
Illuminated by the soft glow
of Sunday candlelight, Soto
House citizens complained that
more money was being spent in
Stern than in Wilbur. A tutor
said that if a choice were made,
he would rather see money be
ing spent on hall improvements
such as sound-proofing the
rooms than on seated service.
At present the men and women
in Wilbur are getting neither.
