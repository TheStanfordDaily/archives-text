# Wilbur Hall Ends Sunday's Sit-Downs
## 
### MARY HAGAN 
An attempt by Wilbur resi
dents to reinstitute sit-down din
ner service on Sundays by hash
ing free of charge has been
ended due to opposition from
the Wilbur food service.
Volunteer hashing died a quick
death when after the October 8
and 15 dinners, Mrs. Kay Malik,
Wilbur food service director,
recommended to Mr. Joe Hig
gins, Wilbur Hall director, that
the experiment be ended.
Wilbur Hall is now the only
Stanford dormitory that has
cafeteria style meals exclusively.
Last year Higgins approved a
recommendation by sponsors,
faculty residents, tutors and the
individual house presidents to
discontinue seated service.
Higgins said the volunteer
hashing was creating problems
primarily within the food ser
vice. The service's major con
cern is providing the best ser

vice possible, he remarked, and
the experimental program left
the food service in "a state of
anxiety."
Mrs. Malik indicated she had
nothing to say about the situa
tion when first asked to com
ment. She later said that this
was her first year as food ser
vice director, and she had had
no part in the original decision.
She also declined comment on
the performance of the volun
teers, but she did say they could
have been of help had the same
people worked every Sunday.
Mr. Higgins said, "We all feel
better about the possibilities for
next quarter."
Two extra hashers were need
ed in each dining hall for the
Sunday dinners to bring bever
ages bccause milk cartons were
not on the tables as they are at
Stern. In defending her action,
Mrs. Malik said, "Milk cartons
