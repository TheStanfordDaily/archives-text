Reserve Officers Training
Corps (ROTO does have a def
inite place in the university, ac
cording to many at the Insti
tute of International Relations
Military Desk discussion yester
day.
Moderator Skip Tammany ex
pressed disappointment, in fact,
that more opponents of ROTC
did not attend.
The afternoon discussion in

Tresidder was planned as a for
um for informal exchange of
ideas following the many ar
ticles and letters in the Daily
on the ROTC issue.
Jim Sisler, a business school
graduate who went through
Army ROTC and was a platoon
leader with the First Infantry
Division in Vietnam, spoke first,
refuting common arguments
againnst ROTC.
To counter the argument that
ROTC teaches a very narrow
group of skills applicable to few
people and should therefore be
eliminated, Sisler made a com
parison to engineering, also a
"narrow" field for few people.
Engineering, too, should then be
dropped, he said.
Teaches War?
Because ROTC teaches war,
the program should be dropped,
many opponents say. If this is
the case, first aid has no place
on campus "because it teaches
accidents," Sisler argued. And as
a course ROTC "certainly isn't
a snap," he added.
On the positive side, Sisler
pointed out that every U.S. male
citizen has a military obligation
and that ROTC offers a way to
fulfill this.
Sisler felt that anyone seek
ing this manner of discharging
one's military obligation should
have the ROTC option, and this
opportunity should not be denied
future students. As long as peo
ple want to enroll in a course,
it should be offered, he and oth
ers agreed.
Robert W. Barrett, an oppon
ent of ROTC, next said he would
put up with ROTC on campus
except for the Vietnam war. En
rollment in ROTC is a sign of
support for that conflict, he as
serted.
