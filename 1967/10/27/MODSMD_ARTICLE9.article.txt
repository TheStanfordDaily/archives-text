## Fill Those Seats 
### 
The annual moment of truth for the student
legislature comes a week from today.
Petitions for LASSU elections will be due
Nov. 3 from candidates for the 49 graduate
student and 27 off-campus undergraduate seats.
If Speaker Michael Weinstein receives 76 or
more petitions, the legislature might do some
thing this year. If he receives substantially
fewer than 76, it will almost certainly do noth
ing.
At stake is the guts and initiative of the
membership. Humanities and science graduates
and off-campus undergraduates include many
of the most progressive, liberal students on
campus. Potentially they hold almost half the
seats in LASSU.
In past years the legislature played a de
cisive role in reforming student regulations
when graduate activists exercised their votes
and voices.

Naturally the question arises whether it is
worth anybody's trouble to become a LASSU
representative. The Associated Students is
merely a creation of the Dean of Students, some
argue, with no real power or independence.
But the brighter episodes of LASSU's recent

history show the legislature can be an import
ant instrument of student power if it is led by
a determined speaker and controlled by pro
gressive, but realistic, members.
Many of Stanford's policies are in flux.
LASSU, speaking for all 12,000 students, has a
golden opportunity to tip the scales in favor
of common sense on issues ranging from
women's social regulations to CIA recruiting.
But the chances are nil that the lethargic
group of 40 undergraduates who have consti
tuted LASSU so far this year will do anything
of the sort. Unless the legislature fills its more
than 150 seats, it will be useless during this
critical stage of reform at Stanford.

The elections Nov. 8 are for the off-campus
undergraduates and graduates in the schools of
humanities and sciences, education and en
gineering. Law, medical and business students
elect their 18 representatives through their stu
dent organizations.
A petition with only 15 names puts a candi
date on the ballot. If fewer petitions are turned
in than seats, candidates automatically become
LASSU members. The petitions are available
in the Associated Students office in Tresidder.
Get moving. —M.S.
