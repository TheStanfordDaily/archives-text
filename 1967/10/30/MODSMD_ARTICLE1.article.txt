# Ban On Beards?
## Faculty Club Nixes Whiskered Waiter 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
A Stanford student says he was
denied a waiter's job at the Facul
ty Club because of his beard.
In a letter to the editor In today's
DAILY, senior Muni Barash claims
a Faculty Club hiring manager
told him he could not get a job in
the club's dining room because he
was not clean-shaven.
In response to Barush's com
plaint, a faculty committee on man
agement for the club will meet to
day to consider the problem. They
are expected to consider the esthe
tic and hygenic implications of a
beard on a waiter.
Barash claimed that the decision
was made by the Faculty Club's
reservation manager, William War
rington, in the form of a recom
mendation to the student employ
ment coordinator that Barash not
be given the waiter's job.
But Warrington, when contacted
later, denied he had barred Barash
from the waiter's position. "We
have no openings for waiters at
this time," Warrington told THE
DAILY.

Harash first applied for a posi
tion after friends told him there
was a shortage of waiters.
A reliable source indicated over
the weekend that there Is at least
one opening on the Faculty Club's
waiter staff and that it was unfilled
at the time of Barash's Interview.
When asked if he had a policy
against hiring men with beards,
Warrington replied that, "We have
no policy." Asked if Banish would
be hired if there was an opening
in the waiter's staff, he said "we'd
have to see."
Barash was seeking employment
with the club becausc he "wanted
to meet the faculty." He said he
was offered a job in the kitchen,
but he turned it down since his
only interest was to "increase con
tact with the faculty by being a
waiter."
The first thing Warrington said
In their interview last week, Bar
ash reports, was, "That's a nice
beard you have, but I don't know
what the public health officer
would say."
Barash pointed out to Warring

ton that there were girls with long
hair and men with moustaches
working as waiters at the club and
that he himself had worked as a
waiter in hotels and in operating
rooms with a beard without any
trouble.
Barash claims Warrington an
swered that "It's a matter of prin
ciple; my staff is all clean-shaven
and it would set a bad precedent
if I let a boy with a beard in the
dining room."
When contacted, Warrington
commented that the Faculty Club
is a private club and may therefore
hire whomever it wishes.
He also stated that he likes his
employees "to look somewhat
alike; we don't want someone who
looks like he just walked out of a
cave."
Warrington said he offered Bar
ash "one of our better" jobs In the
kitchen. He would have been a
server and garnisher, assisting the
chef handle the food in the
kitchen." Barash would handle
food In both the waiter and gar

nlsher positions. Barash said that
he was kept from the waiter's job
because "decisions were being
made to protect the faculty, even
though they knew nothing about
it"
But Chester A. Berry, manager,
said later that the only job that
could be offered to Barash In the
Faculty Club would be as a dish
washer.
His ruling, he said, was based
on sanitary reasons. "Women with
long hair and men with beards are
not permitted near where food is
prepared or served," he declared.
Berry admitted, however, that
women with long hair are permitted
to pour coffee at the tables and
men with moustaches are not bar
red from being waiters.
A representative of the Wilbur
Food Service stated that Wilbur
hashers with beards are employed
only In the dlshroom. They are not
allowed to handle food. She is un
certain if there is a state law on
beards, but the food service bans
them "just to be safe."

MUNI BARASH
A Stanford student says he was
denied a waiter's job at the Facul
ty Club because of his beard.
In a letter to the editor In today's
DAILY, senior Muni Barash claims
a Faculty Club hiring manager
told him he could not get a job in
the club's dining room because he
was not clean-shaven.
In response to Barush's com
plaint, a faculty committee on man
agement for the club will meet to
day to consider the problem. They
are expected to consider the esthe
tic and hygenic implications of a
beard on a waiter.
Barash claimed that the decision
was made by the Faculty Club's
reservation manager, William War
rington, in the form of a recom
mendation to the student employ
ment coordinator that Barash not
be given the waiter's job.
But Warrington, when contacted
later, denied he had barred Barash
from the waiter's position. "We
have no openings for waiters at
this time," Warrington told THE
DAILY.

Harash first applied for a posi
tion after friends told him there
was a shortage of waiters.
A reliable source indicated over
the weekend that there Is at least
one opening on the Faculty Club's
waiter staff and that it was unfilled
at the time of Barash's Interview.
When asked if he had a policy
against hiring men with beards,
Warrington replied that, "We have
no policy." Asked if Banish would
be hired if there was an opening
in the waiter's staff, he said "we'd
have to see."
Barash was seeking employment
with the club becausc he "wanted
to meet the faculty." He said he
was offered a job in the kitchen,
but he turned it down since his
only interest was to "increase con
tact with the faculty by being a
waiter."
The first thing Warrington said
In their interview last week, Bar
ash reports, was, "That's a nice
beard you have, but I don't know
what the public health officer
would say."
Barash pointed out to Warring

ton that there were girls with long
hair and men with moustaches
working as waiters at the club and
that he himself had worked as a
waiter in hotels and in operating
rooms with a beard without any
trouble.
Barash claims Warrington an
swered that "It's a matter of prin
ciple; my staff is all clean-shaven
and it would set a bad precedent
if I let a boy with a beard in the
dining room."
When contacted, Warrington
commented that the Faculty Club
is a private club and may therefore
hire whomever it wishes.
He also stated that he likes his
employees "to look somewhat
alike; we don't want someone who
looks like he just walked out of a
cave."
Warrington said he offered Bar
ash "one of our better" jobs In the
kitchen. He would have been a
server and garnisher, assisting the
chef handle the food in the
kitchen." Barash would handle
food In both the waiter and gar

nlsher positions. Barash said that
he was kept from the waiter's job
because "decisions were being
made to protect the faculty, even
though they knew nothing about
it"
But Chester A. Berry, manager,
said later that the only job that
could be offered to Barash In the
Faculty Club would be as a dish
washer.
His ruling, he said, was based
on sanitary reasons. "Women with
long hair and men with beards are

food In both the waiter and gar

nlsher positions. Barash said that
he was kept from the waiter's job
because "decisions were being
made to protect the faculty, even
though they knew nothing about
it"
But Chester A. Berry, manager,
said later that the only job that
could be offered to Barash In the
Faculty Club would be as a dish
washer.
His ruling, he said, was based
on sanitary reasons. "Women with
long hair and men with beards are
not permitted near where food is
prepared or served," he declared.
Berry admitted, however, that
women with long hair are permitted
to pour coffee at the tables and
men with moustaches are not bar
red from being waiters.
A representative of the Wilbur
Food Service stated that Wilbur
hashers with beards are employed
only In the dlshroom. They are not
allowed to handle food. She is un
certain if there is a state law on
beards, but the food service bans
them "just to be safe."
