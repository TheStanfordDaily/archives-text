# Institutionalize Heresy

The SES opus on undergraduate education
released today is a comprehensive and progres
sive but unfortunately substantially innocuous
statement of the direction undergraduate • edu
cation must take at Stanford.
We say unfortunately because we would like
to see the University involved immediately in
a full-scale debate over the formulation of a
Stanford undergraduate education. This paper,
while introducing many new concepts and pro
posing many new programs, will be accepted
by most faculty and administration members
and all students as a good, moderate approach
to the reform of undergraduate education. Only
a few diehard traditionalists will oppose the
concepts employed.
There are many good proposals outlined in
the report, but there could certainly be others.
And there are phrases each person may high
light as the most significant. Ours is the state
ment that self-designed undergraduate pro
grams "should eventually be offered to all stu
dents who prefer that option to the standard
curriculum."
While a very broad General Studies program
may still exist, every student would have the
option of working out a personal undergraduate
program with a special advisor. Such an ulti
mately flexible program will call for a great
commitment to counseling programs, but that
has been needed for a long time anyway.
SES committees must not take a lack of con
troversy as a lack of enthusiasm for the report or
as a disagreement with it. Rather they should

take this as an affirmation and move on to what
is a much more difficult task: establishing "the
structural mechanisms" necessary to enact the
reforms and to oversee the development of un
dergraduate education in the years ahead.
Stanford has tried to set up such a structure
several times in the past few years—and has
failed. The latest attempt was the office of the
undergraduate education, and though the seat
was filled for a while, then vacant for over a
year, never was there a noticeable change in the
development of undergraduate education.
Some have suggested Stanford needs a vice
provost for heresy (to sitmulate it, not to sup
press it), or maybe a dean of innovation, a high
official specifically designated to champion re
form causes.
The SES must now look beyond the dean of
undergraduate education and the provost's of
fice. These have shown they cannot effectively
guide and stimulate undergraduate education.
The steering committee of SES should carry one
step further a theory inherent in their whole
report—that students should plan their own un
dergraduate education.
So the students should be instrumental in any
structure which oversees and reforms under
graduate education. A more flexible structure
is needed: one that involves the student govern
ment, the faculty government, and the adminis
tration in jointly planning and executing the ele
ments of an undergraduate education.
Building this effective structure is a much
harder job than defining a new General Studies
program.
