# Another Attempt
## President Records A Hit 
### Herbie Hinckes 
President Lyndon Baines Con
sensus kicked his dog again, get
ting a satisfactory yelp this
time.
"Blasted kids," he muttered
to his trusted friend and Sec. of
Defense, Robert S. McEdsel.
"Here I am trying to run a coun
try and a war at the same time
and all those idiots do is oppose
me."
"They're bad sports about the
whole thing. They even give aid
and comfort to the enemy and
all that stuff," McEdsel agreed.
"Bob, if I don't get the sup
port of the young people of this
country, I'm not going to be re
elected next year."
How Tragic!
"Gosharootie, President Con
sus, what a tragedy for the coun
try that would be! What are you
going to do?"
"Well, I've got a plan. I'm go
ing to put out a rock and roll
record." President Consensus
smiled. "You must think that
sounds crazy, right, Bob?"
McEdsel nodded his head vig
orously, nearly knocking a vase
off a shelf behind him.
"Bob, this record will say it.
Those little bastards will be too
embarrassed to ever wear long
hair or burn their draft cards
again."

"I think I'm getting the idea
now, President Consensus, but
what format will you use, a
rock and roll band?"
"Why let the enemy deliver
the message? I think I'll use an
older man who talks during the
entire record as he writes a let
ter to his son."
"What do you plan to call
it?"
"How about 'An Open Letter
to My Commie • Peace - Creep
Son' "?
Be Subtle
"Actually, President Consen
sus, that's a great idea, but
don't you think it should be a
little more subtle? How about
'A Letter to My Son'?" McEdsel
suggested.
"Sounds great, Bob. Let's see
now, what should the message
of the record be?" Consensus
scribbled a few notes on a pad
of paper.
"I've got it, Bob, we'll have
the father telling his son that if
he burns his draft card, he can
burn his social security card
too. What an idea!"
1 Can Hear It Now"
McEdsel chortled. ''We'll fix
those little cretins. We'll teach
them that they have to be rea
sponsible citizens if they want
to live in our great country."

"What a record this will be,
Bob. I can hear it now." (In the
background the Battle Hymn of
the Republic is heard.) Consen
sus stood up and started the
record's narration on a cue from
McEdsel: "You ask me, son,
what I think of people who wear
long hair and beards. Well, some
great men have always worn
long hair. George Washington
and Abraham Lincoln are two
examples. But Abraham Lincoln
couldn't afford a haircut and
George Washington had a wig."
Is God Dead?
Consensus climbed on top of
his desk. "You ask me if God
is dead. This is a problem that
everybody has to work out for
himself, but can you imagine a
warm summer day just happen
ing? And, besides, I've checked
all the hospitals and coroners'
offices throughout the country
and if God is dead, then nobody
knows about it."
His eyes ablaze and his mouth
foaming, Consensus moved in
for the kill: "You ask me, son,
what I think of draft card burn
ers. Well, I'll tell you, all wars
have been dirty and people have
been killed. But if you doubt
that our free enterprise system
should exist, if you doubt the

principles this country was
founded on, if you doubt
that free men should work for
their living, then I'm to blame
for your failure.
Stupid Mother
"Your mother will still love
you, but she's not very smart.
I love you too, son, but I love
my country more," Consensus
screamed, rapidly approaching
a climax. "And il you bum your
draft card, you can burn your
social security card too, because
from that moment on, you're
no son of mine."
"Bravo, bravo," McEdsel ex
claimed, wildly applauding. He
was silent for a few seconds.
"But do you think anyone would
buy a record like that, Presi
dent Consensus?"
"Bing Crosby probably asked
himself the same question when
he first sang White Christmas.
We artists can't worry about
financial gains. It's only the
majestry of our work that
counts."
"Well, if that's true, Presi
dent Consensus, it will probably
be a best seller."

"Actually, President Consen
sus, that's a great idea, but
don't you think it should be a
little more subtle? How about
'A Letter to My Son'?" McEdsel
suggested.
"Sounds great, Bob. Let's see
now, what should the message
of the record be?" Consensus
scribbled a few notes on a pad
of paper.
"I've got it, Bob, we'll have
the father telling his son that if
he burns his draft card, he can
burn his social security card
too. What an idea!"
1 Can Hear It Now"
McEdsel chortled. ''We'll fix
those little cretins. We'll teach
them that they have to be rea
sponsible citizens if they want
to live in our great country."

"What a record this will be,
Bob. I can hear it now." (In the
background the Battle Hymn of
the Republic is heard.) Consen
sus stood up and started the
record's narration on a cue from
McEdsel: "You ask me, son,
what I think of people who wear
long hair and beards. Well, some
great men have always worn
long hair. George Washington
and Abraham Lincoln are two
examples. But Abraham Lincoln
couldn't afford a haircut and
George Washington had a wig."
Is God Dead?
Consensus climbed on top of
his desk. "You ask me if God
is dead. This is a problem that
everybody has to work out for
himself, but can you imagine a
warm summer day just happen
ing? And, besides, I've checked
all the hospitals and coroners'
offices throughout the country
and if God is dead, then nobody
knows about it."
His eyes ablaze and his mouth
foaming, Consensus moved in
for the kill: "You ask me, son,
what I think of draft card burn
ers. Well, I'll tell you, all wars
have been dirty and people have
been killed. But if you doubt
that our free enterprise system
should exist, if you doubt the

principles this country was
founded on, if you doubt
that free men should work for
their living, then I'm to blame
for your failure.
Stupid Mother
"Your mother will still love
you, but she's not very smart.
I love you too, son, but I love
my country more," Consensus
screamed, rapidly approaching
a climax. "And il you bum your
draft card, you can burn your
social security card too, because
from that moment on, you're
no son of mine."
"Bravo, bravo," McEdsel ex
claimed, wildly applauding. He
was silent for a few seconds.
"But do you think anyone would
buy a record like that, Presi
dent Consensus?"
"Bing Crosby probably asked
himself the same question when
he first sang White Christmas.
We artists can't worry about
financial gains. It's only the
majestry of our work that
counts."
"Well, if that's true, Presi
dent Consensus, it will probably
be a best seller."

offices throughout the country
and if God is dead, then nobody
knows about it."
His eyes ablaze and his mouth
foaming, Consensus moved in
for the kill: "You ask me, son,
what I think of draft card burn
ers. Well, I'll tell you, all wars
have been dirty and people have
been killed. But if you doubt
that our free enterprise system
should exist, if you doubt the

principles this country was
founded on, if you doubt
that free men should work for
their living, then I'm to blame
for your failure.
Stupid Mother
"Your mother will still love
you, but she's not very smart.
I love you too, son, but I love
my country more," Consensus
screamed, rapidly approaching
a climax. "And il you bum your
draft card, you can burn your
social security card too, because
from that moment on, you're
no son of mine."
"Bravo, bravo," McEdsel ex
claimed, wildly applauding. He
was silent for a few seconds.
"But do you think anyone would
buy a record like that, Presi
dent Consensus?"
"Bing Crosby probably asked
himself the same question when
he first sang White Christmas.
We artists can't worry about
financial gains. It's only the
majestry of our work that
counts."
"Well, if that's true, Presi
dent Consensus, it will probably
be a best seller."

President Lyndon Baines Con
sensus kicked his dog again, get
ting a satisfactory yelp this
time.
"Blasted kids," he muttered
to his trusted friend and Sec. of
Defense, Robert S. McEdsel.
"Here I am trying to run a coun
try and a war at the same time
and all those idiots do is oppose
me."
"They're bad sports about the
whole thing. They even give aid
and comfort to the enemy and
all that stuff," McEdsel agreed.
"Bob, if I don't get the sup
port of the young people of this
country, I'm not going to be re
elected next year."
How Tragic!
"Gosharootie, President Con
sus, what a tragedy for the coun
try that would be! What are you
going to do?"
"Well, I've got a plan. I'm go
ing to put out a rock and roll
record." President Consensus
smiled. "You must think that
sounds crazy, right, Bob?"
McEdsel nodded his head vig
orously, nearly knocking a vase
off a shelf behind him.
"Bob, this record will say it.
Those little bastards will be too
embarrassed to ever wear long
hair or burn their draft cards
again."

"I think I'm getting the idea
now, President Consensus, but
what format will you use, a
rock and roll band?"
"Why let the enemy deliver
the message? I think I'll use an
older man who talks during the
entire record as he writes a let
ter to his son."
"What do you plan to call
it?"
"How about 'An Open Letter
to My Commie • Peace - Creep
Son' "?
Be Subtle
"Actually, President Consen
sus, that's a great idea, but
don't you think it should be a
little more subtle? How about
'A Letter to My Son'?" McEdsel
suggested.
"Sounds great, Bob. Let's see
now, what should the message
of the record be?" Consensus
scribbled a few notes on a pad
of paper.
"I've got it, Bob, we'll have
the father telling his son that if
he burns his draft card, he can
burn his social security card
too. What an idea!"
1 Can Hear It Now"
McEdsel chortled. ''We'll fix
those little cretins. We'll teach
them that they have to be rea
sponsible citizens if they want
to live in our great country."

"What a record this will be,
Bob. I can hear it now." (In the
background the Battle Hymn of
the Republic is heard.) Consen
sus stood up and started the
record's narration on a cue from
McEdsel: "You ask me, son,
what I think of people who wear
long hair and beards. Well, some
great men have always worn
long hair. George Washington
and Abraham Lincoln are two
examples. But Abraham Lincoln
couldn't afford a haircut and
George Washington had a wig."
Is God Dead?
Consensus climbed on top of
his desk. "You ask me if God
is dead. This is a problem that
everybody has to work out for
himself, but can you imagine a
warm summer day just happen
ing? And, besides, I've checked
all the hospitals and coroners'
offices throughout the country
and if God is dead, then nobody
knows about it."
