## Discrimination On Basis Of... Beards 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In his speech of Oct. 27, Dean
Napier quotes Dr. David Fisher:
"We've got to design a society
that doesn't . . . make hypocrisy
the passway to bureaucratic suc
cess."
Last week I applied for the
position of waiter at the faculty
club and was refused because I
have a beard. The staff coordi
nator, Mr. Warrington, told me
that even though I have a nice,
well-trimmed beard I could not
work in the dining room. He
went on to say that it is a mat
ter of principle, that it would set
a bad precedent to hire a person
with a beard.
I have worked in the opera
ting rooms of hospitals with a
beard and as a waiter in high
class hotels with a beard and
am disappointed to learn that I
am excluded from working at
the Stanford faculty club.

• Sabotage!
Editor, The Daily:
We have, in the last few weeks,
heard much talk about the rele
vance to the United States war
effort in Viet Nam of public
demonstrations and pacifist pro
test. But nobody has mentioned
what would seem to be the most
logical course for those opposed
to the war: join the troops and
then sabotage their efforts.
The cost to the United States
of containing a few thousand
rioters is derisory compared to
the loss in morale and efficiency
which would result from open
acts of treason, such as desert
ing to the Cong, passing them
information, dropping bombs-in
the sea, misinterpreting critical
orders, etc.
If war protestors adopted this
tactic, the cost of court martial
ling and shipping them back,
combined with the inevitable
publicity it would involve, could
seriously embarrass the adminis
tration.
Finally, of course, it would
have the advantage of wiping
away all suspicion of cowardice
from their cause.

• Once Upon A Time
Editor, The Daily:
Joel Kugelmass' venture into
fiction—a short story about a

demonstration in Washington—
is a bore. His characters are
black and white: either babbling,
terrified, dehumanized soldiers
or brave, honest, and humane
peacelovers.
Blatant omissions of informa
tion interrupt the flow of the
story; for example, what pro
voked the troops to assault the
demonstrators. Furthermore, his
imagery is confusing: "The cries
of Vietnamese babies will re
sound through the moans of
bleeding freshman coeds."
And the story falls apart com
pletely at the end. Joel yields to
the temptation to moralize and
surrenders his struggle for ef
fective prose. The final dozen
paragraphs are a mass of mor
onic generalizations and sloppy
logic. I hope you will print the
attached report. It expresses
vividly the reasoning of the
Washington demonstrators.

(Ed. Note: The report referred
to appeared Monday, Oct. 23, in
the Palo Alto Times, page 5. It
was written by Merriman Smith,
a UPI writer, as a personal re
port questioning the truth of
demonstrator's statements.)
• Lack Of Knowledge
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding Thursday's article,
"Appeal on Israel," though "a
great deal of conscience" may
have been involved when Rom
berg joined those professors
calling for direct negotiations in
the Middle East, unfortunately a
great deal of knowledge and con
sistency of thought were lack
ing.
Romberg stated: "Twenty
years of Arab refusals to meet
with Israel at the conference ta
ble have resulted in three wars."
Looking at history, many other
causes may be cited: In World
War I, the Arabs united with the
Allies because of a British prom
ise that, with victory, Palestine
and other Arab areas would be
come free and independent.
Instead, Britain mandated Pal
estine. An injustice in itself, the
mandate was a precursor to the
partition of Palestine, which, if
one values self-determination,
was a second grave injustice, for
Arabs, at the time, comprised
about two-thirds of the popula
tion. Direct negotiations now
would be tantamount to Arab

acceptance of these injustices—
and many like them.
Romberg advocates a "non
partisan peace;" yet, his only
concern when he joined the oth
er professors "was to see that
support was given to Israel."
Non-partisan ? Perhaps he
feared the Jews might be
pushed into the sea, but what
about the Arabs who had al
ready been pushed into the des
ert?
And if he was concerned with
Israel's territorial integrity,
what of the Arab lands claimed
by Israel in 1948 and others oc
cupied by Israel in 1967? Whose
territorial integrity has been
violated?
In striving for a "non-partisan
peace" the professors are seek
ing lecturers, all of whom are
recognized supporters of Israel,
to review the Middle East crisis.
I would suggest to them, in
stead, a panel represented by
both sides. Would this endanger
Israel's security? If they fear
this, it would imply that Israel
has been established and sup
ported by Americans only
through th ei r ignorance — a
proposition hardly befitting the
support of anyone in the aca
demic community, especially its
professors.

• One-Sided
Editor, The Daily:
Heartiest congratulations to
the editors of the Daily for their
personal restraint.
In last Friday's edition they
managed to suppress an appar
ent emotional attachment to the
Oakland demonstrations by
printing only five articles on the
subject, or a total of over 10
column feet. This must have
been a difficult task, considering
the demonstrations themselves
occurred only a week ago. But
then it seems news never gets
too old for the Daily.
I suppose the staff feels that
its readers will never tire of
hearing about sit-ins, arrests by
nasty lawmen, and subhuman
living conditions at Santa Rita.
And yet even the reports of
these topics might have been
tolerable had they included an
iota of honest, open-minded re
porting rather than the one
sided job that actually was
printed.
It's too bad there isn't an ac

tual journalism class here at
Stanford. Maybe there the edi
tors of this fine paper could
learn that editorial opinion be
longs on the editorial page, and
not scattered here and there
throughout the rest of the pa
per.

• Emoting At Opera
Editor, The Daily:
RE: the review of the opera
Tristan and Isolde in the most
recent issue of the Stanford
Daily Magazine.
The review in question con
tains errors, . . . brims with
minor rapidities and obvious
generalities, ... is burdened by
meaningless and non-communi
cative prose.
The reviewers fell into the trap
of Tristan which Nietzche
warned against, namely, the
temptation to abandon oneself
utterly to the waves of emotion
in the opera.

• Amazing!
Editor, The Dally:
I just read Mr. Massarenti's
interview (Thursday, October
26) and I am amazed at the
stupidity of his commentary: I
am now a naturalized U.S. citi
zen but came to this country
young enough to become a for
eign student on a U.S. campus
(Duquesne U. in Pittsburgh,
1957-1960) and I was never
"amazed at the superficiality of
the people" simply because the
ratio of superficial to deep per
sons is roughly the same in the
U.S. as in the countries from
which we hail.
As to the dating rites in this
country, they may not be the
best of all possible relationships
but to call it "a form of prosti
tution" is senseless and vulgar.
Mr. Massarenti states that:
"We (he means I) want to re
move our image as mere
guests." Why "mere"? What's
humiliating about being a
"guest"? Are the U.S. students
in Italy embarassed if they are
called "guests" of that country?
Moreover, Cesare can apply
for citizenship but then he
might become a mere American.
