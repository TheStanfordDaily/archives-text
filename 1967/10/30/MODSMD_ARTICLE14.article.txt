Following is the general statement of objectives is
sued today by the Steering Committee of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES). It is titled, "Toward a
More Flexible Undergraduate Program."
Introduction
The Study of Education at Stanford is charged with
reviewing Stanford's educational programs and with
submitting recommendations on their future course.
It is a task of enormous scope that must be segmented
and subdivided if it is to be accomplished effectively.
Toward this end a number of separate committees
and individuals have been delegated by the Study's
Steering Committee to review specific topics.
No such delegation has yet been made for the re
view of curricular programs. These are considered so
central and interrelated that a general view of aca
demic purpose and direction must be crystallized, at
least tentatively, before specific programs can be iso
lated and analyzed.
Undergraduate education appears to the Steering
Committee to require primary attention. It engages
the majority of students and the largest block of facul
ty time and attention, yet it is an area of many appar
ent deficiencies and a source of much discontent, at
Stanford and across the nation. In the minds of many
its execution sets the tone and character of the entire
university.
The early work of the Steering Committee has
therefore concentrated on some fundamental aspects
of undergraduate education. Its work has led to the
preparation of this paper, which presents:
(1) a general set of objectives for undergraduate
education;
(2) a broad plan for modifying the present pro
gram of General Studies plus departmental major as
a curriculum for most undergraduates; and
(3) a number of proposals for experimental curri
cula of a radically different nature to be introduced
on a small scale with provisions for continuing evalu
ation and possible subsequent enlargement.
The purpose of releasing the paper at this time is
to promote discussion and response throughout the
community that can aid in the process of arriving at
specific proposals and final decisions.
I. Aims And Criteria
Objectives of an Undergraduate
Education
We believe that undergraduate education should
have the following aims:
(a) to develop the means and motivation for con
tinued learning as a life-long enterprise;
(b) to promote intellectual honesty and rigor;
(c) to enhance the capacity to relate knowledge to
personal awareness and public values.
These aims provide the criteria for evaluating the
approach to undergraduate education taken in this
paper. We invite critical attention to the aims no less
than to the approach.
The present curricular arrangements in most Amer
ican colleges—Stanford included—do not adequately
promote these aims. They place too great an empha
sis on the identification of a certain body of knowl
edge which every educated man is supposed to pos
sess. Just as higher education was slow to recognize
the growth of the sciences in the nineteenth century,
it has been slow to recognize that the vast expansion
of man's knowledge in the twentieth century makes it
at once more difficult and less relevant to transmit a
universally valuable distillation of existing knowledge.
Perhaps most unfortunately, it has been slow to rec
ognize that an educated man is not a finished product
and that learning must continue throughout a produc
tive life. Greatly increasing the student's ability and
inclination to continue learning, which we believe
must be the central goal of the undergraduate pro
gram, does not come about through passive ingestion
of scattered superficialities—the operational result of
attempts to define a prescribed body of knowledge.
Reflection on these relatively stable features of under
graduate education in America and on their lack of
congruence with the aims stated above has produced
the hypotheses about a changed approach presented
in this paper.
The Characteristics of Students
It is important to begin this sort of planning by
taking into account those independent variables with
which the institution is working. Prime among these
are certain characteristics of our students.
Although student selection processes will continue
to change, there is little doubt that matriculants will
continue to represent the most intellectually able and
motivated segment of our population. These students
come from a wide variety of educational and social
backgrounds. Their destination, for the most part, is
some advanced, specialized education in graduate
school. A study of very recent Stanford graduates
shows that over ninety per cent either have taken,
are taking, or definitely plan to take graduate work.
Thus a student's opportunity for undergraduate ed
ucation at Stanford is restricted to the period between
his secondary school experience, largely dominated by
establishing a record which will assure admission to a
good college, and the intensive specialization of grad
uate work. For most students it is not a time for termi
nal specialization. And, in vi< w of the continuing re
laxation by most graduate disciplines of their de
mands for undergraduate specialization, it need no
longer be for most students a period devoted exclu
sively to prescribed pre-professional work. Rather it
is a time for more general intellectual and personal
growth.
For most, the undergraduate years are the first pe
riod of disassociation from the family. It is a time for

the determination of goals and values, the discovery
of likes and abilities, the establishment of habits of
thinking which will endure a lifetime. Given the po
tential of Stanford's incoming students, the University
has an enormous responsibility to provide every op
portunity for such self-development.
Resources
A second reality which must constantly be kept be
fore us is the limited nature of the institution's re
sources. Ways must be found to make higher educa
tion more effective without designing schemes which
would call for unrealistic expansion of the faculty or
escalation of a limited operating budget. Means must
surely exist to increase educational effectiveness with
out adding substantially to present demands on al
ready strained resources —perhaps through greater
emphasis on learning instead of teaching, on reading
instead of listening, on self-directed work instead of
formal courses.
If Stanford is to make the most of its resources for
undergraduate education it must take full advantage
of its unique characteristics. In particular it must
capitalize upon the exceptional range and strength
of the graduate and professional schools which are an
integral part of the institution. It must find ways to
bring these loci of strength to bear on undergraduate
education through increased involvement of faculty
members and improved engagement of graduate stu
dents.
Stanford should provide a richer educational experi
ence for its undergraduates than is available in any
four-year college, however excellent. It should open
up to its students the wide range of assets which are
at hand, and at the same time seek students who, by
inclination, maturity and temperament, are able to
take full advantage of such opportunities.
Diversity and Community
A first departure in Stanford's undergraduate pro
gram must be a recognition of widely differing indi
vidual needs. For too long colleges and universities
have sought a master plan which would accomodate
every student. The monolithic requirements at Stan
ford, as at most other institutions, have operated on
the asumption that some prescribed dosage is good
for everyone or, even worse, harmful to no one. In a
society that cherishes individual differences as con
tributing to the richness of the whole, such a regimen
seems woefully short-sighted.
Ways must be found to accomodate differing atti
tudes, inclinations, and levels of preparation. Programs
and procedures must be established which permit
deviation from the standard route without the impli
cation that the student is getting away with something.
On the other hand, mechanisms must be provided to
insure that the immature do not wander aimlessly
through the university.
Such an approach calls for the provision of maximal
opportunity for informed self-direction. This can be
brought about by increasing freedom to choose pro
grams from within broad guidelines, while at the same
time educating the student, in every way possible, to
the opportunities before him and to the consequences
of his choices.
Along with this honoring of individual differences
must come a recognition that we are working with
people who must live in a highly interdependent soci
ety. The university should be responsible for providing
an environment within which differences of opinion
contribute to rather than obstruct cooperative be
havior. Facilities, events and institutional arrange
ments conducive to creating a sense of community
should be provided. Present living and social struc
tures which appear to lead students into stereotypic
groupings, may require modification if they are to con
tribute to more universal participation in campus life.
A Revised Structure for
Undergraduate Education
A first task of our present deliberation on under
graduate education is to seek promising alternatives
to the body-of-knowledge principle which has domin
ated much of undergraduate education in the past.
Not only are most of our students moving toward
different destinations than in the past —into further
specialized education and professional careers rather
than directly into vocational life— but they are moving
into a rapidly changing society.
Coming decades will undoubtedly witness an in
creasing demand on the intellectual, scientific, and
technological communities for solutions to problems
generated by massive change—continued population
growth, urbanization, and the gap between "haves"
and "have nots," for example.
Accelerating change and increased leisure will pro
vide both the incentive and the means for the indi
vidual to continue the pursuit of knowledge, both for
its own sake and for an improved society.
Herein lie clues to what should be strongly urged
if not demanded of all undergraduates. Emphasis
should be not on absorbing knowledge alone, but on
learning where and how to extend one's knowledge
and on gaining a respect for knowledge and its
limitations. This suggests a central curriculum which
would include work intended to develop the necessary
abilities for continued learning, plus exposure in ade
quate depth to a diversity of areas of knowledge.
For some students, perhaps a majority, this objective
can be reached through modification and simplification
of the present General Studies program. A shift in
emphasis, both in distribution and concentration re
quirements, together with new course and study op
portunities, can be achieved without drastic over
night changes that might prove disruptive for present
students and for the institution as a whole. Such a
revised General Studies program, building upon the
best of what is already established, would complement

other programs that allow greater flexibility and wider
options suited to particular needs.
For a small group of students with the necessary
talents and achievement, a University Honors program
should be established that (a) permits the substitu
tion of independent study for course work to the extent
necessary to enable them to move at their own pace
and (b) relieves them of the obligation of conforming
to General Studies distributional requirements and if
necessary to departmental requirements in a particular
major field. This option would not only serve the im
mediate purpose of liberating the creative energies of
a few exceptionally promising students but would also
provide a means for testing a number of innovations
that might ultimately be introduced on a wider basis.
Finally, a randomly chosen segment of the under
graduate student body should be enabled to partici
pate in a wide variety of experimental programs under
taken with the assistance of a group of faculty mem
bers whose time is made available for this purpose.
These programs, possible examples of which are de
scribed later in this paper, should be carefully fol
lowed and evaluated as part of a continuing process
of improving the quality of undergraduate education.
These three rubrics—a modified General Studies
plus departmental major program, an independent
study University Honors program, and an experi
mental program—provide the general pattern for an
approach to undergraduate education that stresses the
process of adaptation, for the institution as well as for
the individual student. The rest of this paper is de
voted to elaborating these rubrics.
11. Building on the
General Studies Program
This section delineates the principal characteristics
of a revised General Studies program. Restriction to
basic requirements in written communication and the
study of the past, plus work in depth in each of the
principal areas of learning, would result in greatly
simplified General Studies course requirements. A re
duction in the number and rigidity of course require
ments, which is a part of this recommendation, would
shift the burden of specifying prerequisites to the de
partments. Work essential to particular majors would
have to be specified by the departments since simpli
fied General Studies requirements could not be
counted on to provide a solid base for all specializa
tions.
Central Skills and Perspectives
An educated person must be able to read critically
and to write effectively. The cultivation of these abilities
should be the responsibility of the entire faculty and
not assumed to be finally taken care of in one specific
course or set of courses. Perceptive reading cannot be
taught in special courses but should develop naturally
throughout regular undergraduate work, especially
through challenging and closely-evaluated independ
ent work which should be encouraged wherever pos
sible. Writing ability should also increase naturally
through independent written work. But the Univers
ity's responsibility to assure this will only be met if
standards for that work are clearly set throughout
the University, if the student is pushed to discover
his potential for good writing in at least one under
graduate program where this is a central concern, and
if close criticism of his writing and the opportunity to
rewrite are available throughout his University work.
Historical studies are an essential component of un
dergraduate education. They have a substantive and
methodological significance that far transcends the
specific subject matter to which the student happens
to be exposed. Awareness of man's past and of the
continuity of history are hallmarks of the educated
man, never more so than in an era of rapid change.
The interpretation of the past poses problems of
method that need to be appreciated if not mastered
by the generally educated person. Exclusive reliance
on a course in the History of Western Civilization to
serve these ends for all students seems misplaced. A
much broader set of options for fulfilling this distribu
tional requirement can and should be devised.
Comprehension of the methods of various disciplines
and cognizance of the transferability of these msthods
should be approached through study in depth in some
discipline in each of the broad areas of learning:
science and technology, social science, and the hu
manities. The number of courses to fulfill this minimal
distribution requirement needs further study; what
should be required is work in sufficient depth in each
area to insure a reasonable grasp of its problems and
methods. Perhaps this distributional requirement
should not be confined to, or necessarily even include,
introductory or survey courses. Rather the student
might be free to choose courses, at any level, which suit
his interest and background.
The distributional requirements outlined in this
section are as much as it now seems desirable to im
pose on all students in the modified General Studies
program. We would propose dropping the implausi
ble alternative requirement of a mathematics or a
foreign language series. There is no rational basis for
the alternative, as is well recognized. The question is
whether either one or both should be required of all
students. The options presently available in mathe
matics are not responsive to the interests and needs of
many students in the humanities and the social sci
ences. It may be that an entirely new introductory
course dealing with mathematical logic as it relates
to computation would serve such a generalized need.
Certainly there are independent reasons for encour
aging the development of courses that will provide,
for students who do not plan to go in science or tech
nology, some understanding of the changes being

wrought in many disciplines and in society as a whole ;
by recent advances in computer capabilities. Pending;
further study of that question, however, there does j
not seem to be an adequate basis for imposing a dis- •
tributional requirement in mathematics on all stu->
dents.
Similarily, there does not seem to be an adequate j
basis for requiring all students to attain a fixed level <
of proficiency in a foreign language. It is certainly
desirable that as many students as possible should be •
motivated to do so; but the decision should be made
in terms that are responsive to the needs and objec
tives of the individual student, including require
ments that may be imposed for departmental and spe
cial program majors as well as for eligiblity to partici
pate in Stanford programs abroad.
New Course Opportunities
The need for more meaningful offerings in science
and technology for the non-scientist looms large.
Courses stressing the nature, method, and social rele
vance of various sciences would have greater value
for many students than pre-professional courses. Lec
ture-demonstrations, supplemented by discussion sec
tions, may have greater value to the generalist than
laboratory courses which tend to become perfunctory
cook-book performances.
Problem-centered courses, which cut across depart
mental lines to deal with currently relevant issues,
need to be designed. Mechanisms should be devel
oped to make it easy for a group of faculty members
in diverse disciplines to offer a course focused on a
particular important topic. The constellation of urban
problems affords a conspicuous example. Students
should have the opportunity to see how the different
disciplines approach a problem and contribute to its
solution. The integrative value of such courses and the
motivational value of dealing with matters that stu
dents perceive as relevant argue for early attempts in
this direction.
There are, among the graduate and professional
school faculties, many professors who would enjoy
teaching undergraduates. Their services should be
enlisted as course instructors or as participating lec
turers. They would be encouraged to offer courses
that relate their specialized knowledge to general con
cerns, rather than watered-down specialist courses.
Some such offerings have been made over the past
two years through Freshman Seminars and Under
graduate Special courses, but more formal arrange
ments, including adequate budgetary leverage, must
be provided if such programs are to expand. This
type of course represents a significant way in which
presently untapped assets of the University can be
brought to bear on undergraduate education.
Many new course opportunities exist. A climate
must be established which encourages faculty and
student initiative in the development of new educa
tional methods. A favorable attitude toward innova
tion and experimentation must be fostered if Stan
ford's full potential for its undergraduates is to be
realized.
Independent Work
Greater stress on independent and honors work is
recommended as being consistent with the abilities
and needs of an ever abler student body. An increase
in work of this type should be accompanied by re
duced dependence on formal course instruction. The
faculty time thus freed would contribute to the feasi
bility of non-classroom work. In such work advanced
graduate students could serve in tutorial capacities, to
the benefit of themselves and the undergraduate pro
gram. (This matter will be dealt with at length in a
later paper on graduate education.) Well qualified ad
vanced undergraduates might also serve effectively in
tutorial and advisory roles, and the expansion of this
form of service, recently initiated in a few departments,
should be attempted on a credit or paid basis.
Some of this independent work might take the form
of off-campus service in a project related to the stu
dent's area of interest. Such undertakings would have
to be carefully planned, supervised by a faculty mem
ber, and followed by a paper evaluating or building on
the field experience. If such a plan is adopted, me'thods
of reducing the student cost burden through tuition ad
justment or external support should be explored.
Honors work, defined as departmental programs us
ually culminating in a major essay, is not now being at
tempted by many well-qualified students; evidence of
this avoidance lies in the fact that only 25% of those
students graduating in 1967 "with distinction" or "with
great distinction" (designations based only on grade
point average) undertook honors programs. Depart
ments not now offering attractive honors programs or
their equivalent should be encouraged to do so. Stu
dents completing honors work should receive full rec
ognition for their efforts. This might take the form of
special academic privileges and suitable designation on
diplomas and transcripts and at commencement.
Ways should be sought to improve the value of the
last quarter of the senior year, now often wasted since
it follows the usual date of graduate school acceptance.
Some common culminating effort, possibly an integra
tive senior seminar or essay, might provide the neces
sary motivation to make the last undergraduate quarter
a fruitful culmination to undergraduate education.
The Freshman Year
If students are to play a more active role in planning
and executing their academic programs, positive steps
will have to be taken to develop the capacity for self
direction. In order to make meaningful choices the stu
dent must have an understanding of the consequences
of his decisions. He must have a grasp of the real mean
ing of advanced learning and the wide range of oppor
tunities available in a university.
A basic re-allocation of resources is in order if we ex-
