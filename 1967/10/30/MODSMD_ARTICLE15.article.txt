## Alums Called 'Totalitarian' 
### 
SANTA CLARA — The presi
dent of the University of Santa
Clara has sharply attacked
many of his institution's alumni
being totalitarian. His state
ment was a strong defense of a
conference of Marxist and Chris
tian scholars held recently on
his campus.
The president, the Very Rev.
Patrick A. Donohoe, responded
to complaints of alumni, saying,
"It is undeniable that a goodly
cross-section of our alumni and
friends think and demand that
the university be a controlled ex
periment utterly divorced from
the world of reality. Antiseptic
ally pure of ideas themselves,
they cannot distinguish between
dialogue and espousal."
The president continued, "The
great American totalitarianism
is economic rather than philoso
phical. It turns off support
when the academic institution
refuses to knuckle under."
Father Donohoe said his crit
ics have little confidence in
American students if they think
a talk by an accomplished Marx
ist can convert them to Commu
nism.
"If this were so, the American
proposition must indeed be vul
nerable. I am quite certain it is
not."
* Pres Protests
NEW YORK (AP) — The
president of Brooklyn College
said Saturday night he walked
out on a campus appearance by
Mayor John V. Lindsay as a
"non-violent protest over the
Mayor's calling the college 'Ber
keley East.' "
College president Francis P.
Kilcoyne told an alumni gather
ing, "I take exception to his
(Mayor Lindsay's) affixing the
label 'Berkeley East' to the col
lege, especially after saying he
had asked for a report and
would study it. . .
"My departure from the plat
form was my form of non-vio
lent protest against the remark.
I just don't like labels, especial
ly when this one does not apply
to 25,000 students."
• Athletics Hit
GRAMBLING, La. (AP) —
With 500 National Guardsmen
standing by in case of uproar,
dissident Grambling College stu
dents gave homecoming day a
taste of protest Saturday.
Grambling President Ralph
Waldo Emerson Jones, who re
quested the troops, resolutely ig
nored the demonstrators, who
were protesting "lack of aca
demic excellence."
Willie Zanders, the 20-year-old
Amite, La., senior who heads the
protest movement, said the stu
dent complaint was that "aca
demic policies of Grambling are
overshadowed by athletic poli
cies."
Grambling spokesmen had de
scribed the protest as having a

"Black Power" base. Zanders de
nied that the demonstrations
were allied with any civil rights
group.
The "Black Power" charge led
to student chants of "Prez told a
lie."
• Prof's Union
POMONA (AP) — A state
college trustee has urged that
instructors be allowed to vote
on whether they favor collective
bargaining.
The suggestion was made by
Trustees Edward O. Lee of Oak
land at a meeting of trustees at
the Cal Poly Pomona campus.
He said that professors today
have four choices if they are
dissatisfied with salaries and
working conditions. Lee said the
instructors may seek a job else
where; accept a standard of liv
ing below other professional
workers; work at a second job;
or participate in collective bar
gaining.
Collective bargaining, Lee told
trustees, has meant "undeniable"
gains for teachers. He proposed
an election conducted by an "im
partial agency" which would
handle all questions of voting
eligibility, time, place, and form
of the election.
• Trinity at
Trinity
HARTFORD, Conn. (UP) —
The Board of Trustees of Trinity
College has unanimously ap
proved the creation of a commit
tee composed of three under
graduates, a trustee, a faculty
member, and an administrator
"to conduct a continuing dia
logue within the college commu
nity."
The Trustees also endorsed
student participation in the re
vision of the curriculum and
asked a newly-formed six-man
faculty committee on curricular
revision to "work out with care
and discretion the mechanics for
meaningful student participa
tion."
One faculty member praised
the Trustees for a "well bal
anced, tempered, and judicious
decision regarding student in
volvement in the shaping of the
curriculum. Beyond that deci
sion, however, I am heartened
by the wisdom of the Board in
setting up a means for an ef
fective and progressive discus
sion between the various parts
of the campus community."
Dean Robert M. Vogel termed
the response to the Student Sen
ate request for participation on
the Curriculum Committee as
one of the most potentially sig
nificant actions in the interest
of improved student-faculty and
student-administration relations.
• Service or Tool?
ROCHESTER, N.Y. (|P) — Do
college roommates affect each

other's academic performance?
For some students, the answer
is yes, according to a recent
study at the University of Ro
chester.
The study said colleges and
universities tend to regard the
provision of housing facilities
for their students as a service—
more for parents than students
—rather than as an educational
tool.
However, housing arrange
ments do appear to have educa
tional implications, according to
the report. Students tend to
achieve at the same level as
their roommates. This is partic
ularly true of freshmen.
Among upperclassmen, how
ever, who are free to choose
their roommates, it appeared
that "men choose roommates
who achieve similarly to them
selves . . . while women seem
to pay no attention to this di
mension at all."
• Sigma Chi OK'd
PORTLAND, Ore.—The Uni
versity of Oregon and Oregon
State University have allowed
their chapters of Sigma Chi to
remain on-campus after the na
tional fraternity agreed to waive
discriminatory by-laws for the
two chapters. The universities
had given the chapters 30 days
to show cause why they should
not be banned from the cam
puses.
• Harlem Project
NEW YORK — Columbia Uni
versity has announced a $2.7 mil
lion program to improve the
educational, health, housing, em
ployment and cultural oppor
tunities in Harlem.
The program, announced Sat
urday by University president
Grayson Kirk, will be developed
in partnership with representa
tives of Harlem, many of whom
have been critical of Columbia's
lack of involvement in the prob
lems of the area.
All of the projects in the ini
tial stage of the program were
devised after consultation with
more than 200 residents of Har
lem and other Negro and Puerto
Rican areas.
The program commits one
third of a $10 million grant from
the Ford Foundation "for new
efforts in the field of minority
and urban affairs."
