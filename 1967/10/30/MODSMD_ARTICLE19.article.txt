# 567 Gaieties To Be New, Different
## 
### 
Ram's Head, which has been
known to throw some surprises
at the Stanford Community in
the past, has .surprised itself this
year by coming up with a really
different idea for Gaieties.
Psuedo-James Bond and wild
eyed spies have been chucked
this year for a real play. The
play still talks to and about
Stanford, and it's still tuneful
and funny, but "there's some
thing else too, something we
ourselves are having to see to
believe," according to composer,
lyricist, and director Alan Mok
ler.
"Let's face it, for the past few
years Ram's Head was getting
stagnated by the standard, shal
low, rah-rah Gaieties," Mokler
said, "and we realized that our
creativity was becoming limit
ed. We decided that we were
cheating ourselves and our au
diences by putting on this kind
of show, and also wasting a
unique opportunity to be really
creative. After all, how many
kids our age get to write, pro
duce, and direct a full-length
musical show?
Sidestepping: Big Game
"So this year we are sidestep
ping Big Game and the refer
ences to Stanford are not so
glaring and forced. The show is
an allegory, and Stanford life
and problems (with the addition
for the first time of life in gen
eral) are faced from a new per
spective and on several levels."
This year's Gaieties (entitled
"Wumberlogue") is probably

the first Gaieties ever which
would stand on its own as a
show, Mokler said. "Stanford
students may see themselves
and their situation in the play,"
Mokler said, "but I know that
anyone would enjoy it.
"Our main concern was not
to write about Stanford but to
write an entertaining show. It's
a funny show, and we created it
to be funny to anyone. We in
tend for all the audience to be
laughing a lot of the time, and
smiling most of the time."
Individual Interpretations
Mokler admits that the new
Gaieties idea is an experiment,
and he has been continuing the
idea of experiment in his direct
ing. The cast, he said, has been
encouraged to try out different
ways of playing scenes, and in
dividuals have been trying out
widely differing interpretations
of their roles in an effort to
select, develop, and refine the
best possible interpretation of
the role.
"This cast is getting a taste
of a type of acting not usually
found in musical shows," Mok
ler said. "Usually, in a musical
comedy, the interpretation of
the various roles stays about
the same from first reading to
final performance ,and the actor
basically just memorizes lines
and recites them in a narrow,
preconceived fashion. Not so
here. This isn't because I am
such a great director."
