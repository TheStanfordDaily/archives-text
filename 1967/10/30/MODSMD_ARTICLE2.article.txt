# Los Arcos, Branner, Arroyo Winners In Fifth Lag Seca
## 
### 
Lake Lagunita roared again
Saturday with the sounds of
highly and not so highly tuned
machines, in the Fifth Annual
Lagunita Seca Road Race, spon
sored by Zeta Psi.

Los Arcos won the main event
handily with a time of 1:05.3 in
the Domestic class. Driver Bob
Ireson piloted the 1955 Cadillac
Eldorado convertible.
Junipero took second place

with a time of 1:08, just edging
out Crothers Memorial, winners
for the past two years, by one
tenth of a second.
The Foreign division was won
by a rookie crew from Branner,
in the surprising time of 1:02,
by far the fastest time of the
day.
The surprise of the day was
Wendy Doheny, who drove the
Arroyo entry to a one-sided vic
tory in the Powder Puff class.
Her time of 1:09.2 was the fifth
fastest in a Domestic class auto
mobile. The car, a 1954 Ply
mouth, cost $38.
Bumble Seat
Although the cars rumbled
over jumps, around hairpins
turns, and into a pit eight feet
deep, there was only one injury.
Terry Fotre of Delta Upsilon
suffered minor facial lacerations
when he drove into the pit too
fast and was jolted into the
windshield. Forte said he "want
ed about five girls waiting in
the hospital for him."
Among the many novel hap
penings were Phi Kap's skillful
backwards run, Alpha Delta's
car with a wooden rollbar and
a couch on the rear bumper, and
the surprise appearance of Sam
Darcie, originator of the Lag
unita Seca rac®.
