# Foreign Student's Problem
## Massarenti Cites Value Conflict 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY News Editor 
Writing about someone's per
sonal opinions from an inter
view is a tricky business. Almost
always the person interviewed
would like the article to say
more than it does, and some
times he feels the writer has
missed the point entirely.
Last Thursday a Daily report
er interviewed ASSU Vice Pres
ident Cesare Massarenti in an
article entitled, "Foreign Stu
dents Face Campus Isolation."
Massarenti, although happy to
see some discussion in our pages
of the foreign students' prob
lems, pointed out parts of the
article which said exactly the
opposite of what he actually be
lieves. He clarified his views in
a second interview.
'Feeling Of Apartness'
Massarenti, drawing from his
personal experience, is con
cerned with the "feeling of
apartness" common among the
1100 foreign students at Stan
ford. Part of his own studies for
a doctorate in sociology has been
an investigation of the causes
of this lack of involvement with
American society. These causes
are much deeper, in his view,
than the obvious language prob
lems and homesickness.
'The attitude of a foreign stu
dent coming to the U.S. depends
on his attitude before he comes
here," Massarenti said. "He sees
America through a mirror, and
the mirror is what you come

here with, your value system."
And the values of Stanford's
foreign students often make it
difficult for them to blend into
the scenery here during short
stays in America, Massarenti be
lieves.
Foreign students mostly have
a more radical political and so
cial philosophy, according to
Massarenti. They are used to a
collective approach to life, and
recoil at the competition stressed
in American education.
Alienating: Experiences
Housing with American fam
ilies sometimes backfires. Many
of the families are very good,
they treat you just as a person,"
Massarenti said. "But sometimes
there is a feeling of being used
by the family as a status sym
bol. They show you off at din
ners. The children write school
papers about you. Each year the
family has a student from a
different country. You feel like
a bird of paradise."
Such experiences conspire to
alienate the foreign student. He
spends his time in the Interna
tional Center, finding compan
ionship among other foreign stu
dents. To break through, "it
takes a long time. Most foreign
students don't stay here long
time and willingness."
Some groups of Stanford's for
eign students, almost all of
whom are graduates; are more
successful at becoming involved
in American life than others,
Massarenti believes. The doctor

al candidates are most success
ful.
"They are older, have more ex
perience, and come here for fair
ly clear reasons. They stay here
a long time." Their scholarly in
terest in America makes them
seek out an understanding of the
society around them.
The candidates for master's
degrees "are difficult to put into
a category," Massarenti said.
For those who desire the mas
ters primarily to move up in
business, their stay at Stanford
gives them little besides "a
piece of paper."
"These people have much less
interest in knowing the U.S. or
making connections with Amer
ican students, but there are a
lot of exceptions."
For the sensitive foreigner
who does get involved, the gap
in values is always present.
"Only now the discussion of

American values in universities
is beginning," Massarenti ex
plained. "We have always lived
with this."
He cites his own experience.
After years of activity in Italian
student politics, he came to
Stanford in 1965 as a doctoral
candidate.
"I thought I was fairly open
minded. I had a Marxian intel
lectual background, but that
doesn't mean anything. I am a
political observer."
In a way he encountered a
language barrier although his
English is excellent. It was a
semantic barrier, a completely
different understanding of cer
tain words. He gave a very
timely example:
"For many of us, the word
'violence' has a kind of positive
connection. It means demonstra
ting in the street and fighting
with the police when they start

clubbing you. We don't know
the social rules of non-violence—
we've always had to deal with
violence. Police have always
killed students and workers, just
like they are now in Spain."
Students with this background
feel detached from a society
which almost unanimously sup
ports police tactics in Oakland,
or from American students who
agonize over a decision to carry
a picket sign for protection and
thus risk violating a creed of
non-violence.
Massarenti, who is married
and has a son, overcame the iso
lation. He sought out undergrad
uates, finding them "more alive"
than Stanford's graduate stu
dents. But many foreign stu
dents remain too distant from
Americans. The Daily will ex
amine their situation and the
Bechtel International Center in
a future article.

lems and homesickness.
'The attitude of a foreign stu
dent coming to the U.S. depends
on his attitude before he comes
here," Massarenti said. "He sees
America through a mirror, and
the mirror is what you come

here with, your value system."
And the values of Stanford's
foreign students often make it
difficult for them to blend into
the scenery here during short
stays in America, Massarenti be
lieves.
Foreign students mostly have
a more radical political and so
cial philosophy, according to
Massarenti. They are used to a
collective approach to life, and
recoil at the competition stressed
in American education.
Alienating: Experiences
Housing with American fam
ilies sometimes backfires. Many
of the families are very good,
they treat you just as a person,"
Massarenti said. "But sometimes
there is a feeling of being used
by the family as a status sym
bol. They show you off at din
ners. The children write school
papers about you. Each year the
family has a student from a
different country. You feel like
a bird of paradise."
Such experiences conspire to
alienate the foreign student. He
spends his time in the Interna
tional Center, finding compan
ionship among other foreign stu
dents. To break through, "it
takes a long time. Most foreign
students don't stay here long
time and willingness."
Some groups of Stanford's for
eign students, almost all of
whom are graduates; are more
successful at becoming involved
in American life than others,
Massarenti believes. The doctor

al candidates are most success
ful.
"They are older, have more ex
perience, and come here for fair
ly clear reasons. They stay here
a long time." Their scholarly in
terest in America makes them
seek out an understanding of the
society around them.
The candidates for master's
degrees "are difficult to put into
a category," Massarenti said.
For those who desire the mas
ters primarily to move up in
business, their stay at Stanford
gives them little besides "a
piece of paper."
"These people have much less
interest in knowing the U.S. or
making connections with Amer
ican students, but there are a
lot of exceptions."
For the sensitive foreigner
who does get involved, the gap
in values is always present.
"Only now the discussion of

American values in universities
is beginning," Massarenti ex
plained. "We have always lived
with this."
He cites his own experience.
After years of activity in Italian
student politics, he came to
Stanford in 1965 as a doctoral
candidate.
"I thought I was fairly open
minded. I had a Marxian intel
lectual background, but that
doesn't mean anything. I am a
political observer."
In a way he encountered a
language barrier although his
English is excellent. It was a
semantic barrier, a completely
different understanding of cer
tain words. He gave a very
timely example:
"For many of us, the word
'violence' has a kind of positive
connection. It means demonstra
ting in the street and fighting
with the police when they start

clubbing you. We don't know
the social rules of non-violence—
we've always had to deal with
violence. Police have always
killed students and workers, just
like they are now in Spain."
Students with this background
feel detached from a society
which almost unanimously sup
ports police tactics in Oakland,
or from American students who
agonize over a decision to carry
a picket sign for protection and
thus risk violating a creed of
non-violence.
Massarenti, who is married
and has a son, overcame the iso
lation. He sought out undergrad
uates, finding them "more alive"
than Stanford's graduate stu
dents. But many foreign stu
dents remain too distant from
Americans. The Daily will ex
amine their situation and the
Bechtel International Center in
a future article.
Writing about someone's per
sonal opinions from an inter
view is a tricky business. Almost
always the person interviewed
would like the article to say
more than it does, and some
times he feels the writer has
missed the point entirely.
Last Thursday a Daily report
er interviewed ASSU Vice Pres
ident Cesare Massarenti in an
article entitled, "Foreign Stu
dents Face Campus Isolation."
Massarenti, although happy to
see some discussion in our pages
of the foreign students' prob
lems, pointed out parts of the
article which said exactly the
opposite of what he actually be
lieves. He clarified his views in
a second interview.
'Feeling Of Apartness'
Massarenti, drawing from his
personal experience, is con
cerned with the "feeling of
apartness" common among the
1100 foreign students at Stan
ford. Part of his own studies for
a doctorate in sociology has been
an investigation of the causes
of this lack of involvement with
American society. These causes
are much deeper, in his view,
than the obvious language prob
lems and homesickness.

a bird of paradise."
Such experiences conspire to
alienate the foreign student. He
spends his time in the Interna
tional Center, finding compan
ionship among other foreign stu
dents. To break through, "it
takes a long time. Most foreign
students don't stay here long
time and willingness."
Some groups of Stanford's for
eign students, almost all of
whom are graduates; are more
successful at becoming involved
in American life than others,
Massarenti believes. The doctor

al candidates are most success
ful.
"They are older, have more ex
perience, and come here for fair
ly clear reasons. They stay here
a long time." Their scholarly in
terest in America makes them
seek out an understanding of the
society around them.
The candidates for master's
degrees "are difficult to put into
a category," Massarenti said.
For those who desire the mas
ters primarily to move up in
business, their stay at Stanford
gives them little besides "a
piece of paper."
"These people have much less
interest in knowing the U.S. or
making connections with Amer
ican students, but there are a
lot of exceptions."
For the sensitive foreigner
who does get involved, the gap
in values is always present.
"Only now the discussion of

American values in universities
is beginning," Massarenti ex
plained. "We have always lived
with this."
He cites his own experience.
After years of activity in Italian
student politics, he came to
Stanford in 1965 as a doctoral
candidate.
"I thought I was fairly open
minded. I had a Marxian intel
lectual background, but that
doesn't mean anything. I am a
political observer."
In a way he encountered a
language barrier although his
English is excellent. It was a
semantic barrier, a completely
different understanding of cer
tain words. He gave a very
timely example:
"For many of us, the word
'violence' has a kind of positive
connection. It means demonstra
ting in the street and fighting
with the police when they start

clubbing you. We don't know
the social rules of non-violence—
we've always had to deal with
violence. Police have always
killed students and workers, just
like they are now in Spain."
Students with this background
feel detached from a society
which almost unanimously sup
ports police tactics in Oakland,
or from American students who
agonize over a decision to carry
a picket sign for protection and
thus risk violating a creed of
non-violence.
Massarenti, who is married
and has a son, overcame the iso
lation. He sought out undergrad
uates, finding them "more alive"
than Stanford's graduate stu
dents. But many foreign stu
dents remain too distant from
Americans. The Daily will ex
amine their situation and the
Bechtel International Center in
a future article.
Writing about someone's per
sonal opinions from an inter
view is a tricky business. Almost
always the person interviewed
would like the article to say
more than it does, and some
times he feels the writer has
missed the point entirely.
Last Thursday a Daily report
er interviewed ASSU Vice Pres
ident Cesare Massarenti in an
article entitled, "Foreign Stu
dents Face Campus Isolation."
Massarenti, although happy to
see some discussion in our pages
of the foreign students' prob
lems, pointed out parts of the
article which said exactly the
opposite of what he actually be
lieves. He clarified his views in
a second interview.
'Feeling Of Apartness'
Massarenti, drawing from his
personal experience, is con
cerned with the "feeling of
apartness" common among the
1100 foreign students at Stan
ford. Part of his own studies for
a doctorate in sociology has been
an investigation of the causes
of this lack of involvement with
American society. These causes
are much deeper, in his view,
than the obvious language prob
lems and homesickness.
'The attitude of a foreign stu
dent coming to the U.S. depends
on his attitude before he comes
here," Massarenti said. "He sees
America through a mirror, and
the mirror is what you come

here with, your value system."
And the values of Stanford's
foreign students often make it
difficult for them to blend into
the scenery here during short
stays in America, Massarenti be
lieves.
Foreign students mostly have
a more radical political and so
cial philosophy, according to
Massarenti. They are used to a
collective approach to life, and
recoil at the competition stressed
in American education.
Alienating: Experiences
Housing with American fam
ilies sometimes backfires. Many
of the families are very good,
they treat you just as a person,"
Massarenti said. "But sometimes
there is a feeling of being used
by the family as a status sym
bol. They show you off at din
ners. The children write school
papers about you. Each year the
family has a student from a
different country. You feel like
a bird of paradise."
