# Coeds Find Jail Rewarding
## 
### DAN SNELL 
At 6:15 Saturday mornings at
the corner of Embarcadero and
El Camino in Palo Alto six Stan
ford coeds can be seen leaving
for their weekend jaunt.
But they are not going to some
secluded mountain cabin or to a
beach-side bungalow. Their des
tination is Alameda County cor
rection center at Santa Rita near
Pleasanton. The six coeds are
serving five weekends for con
victions stemming from the re
cent anti-draft demonstrations
in Oakland.
The girls must arrive at the
Jail by 8 a.m. Saturday. If they
do not get there on time, there
will be a 10 to 30 day penalty for
the latecomers. As a precaution,
the cars travelling in the cara
van to Pleasanton stay together
so help will be immediately
available if one breaks down.
The "convicts" get out 6 p.m.
Sundays.
The girls, Phair Corey, Sue
Haley, Mary Hanson, Mary
Heers, Dawn Meyners, and Deb
orah Weiner, can take only three
textbooks with them. Every
thng else is supplied by the
prison, including gown-like uni
forms of denim.
Sue Haley, a junior in biology,
said prison life "really wasn't as
bad as I had expected." Though
they sleep in long dormitory
halls with twenty "little cots"
along each wall, the girls spoke

fondly of the weeping willows
and roses in the prison yard.
During the week prisoners
have regular gardening and
housekeeping chores. But the
"week-enders" have a great deal
of the time for themselves. They
do have to wash dishes, but this
takes only "about forty minutes
of your time."
The girls could spend the rest
of the time reading, but there
are conversations going on. The
small library at Santa Rita is
described by one girl as "pretty
bad."
Baez Appeals
The convicted protesters were
originally kept separate from
the other inmates of the jail
complex, but singer Joan Baez
appealed successfully to the au
thorities to mix everyone. Miss
Baez helped create a relaxed
atmosphere in the complex, one
Stanford girl observed, through
her efforts to talk with the other
inmates and through her sing
ing.
Prison authorities frowned on
the singing, however, and fre
quently asked Baez to do small
chores like cleaning out the dep
uty's office. "It got so she was
cleaning out that office ten times
a day," sophomore Dawn Mey
ners said.
On the whole if the girls seem
busy, the officials leave them
alone.
The other inmates are "mostly

Negroes in for heroin charges,"
one girl told The Daily. Others
are serving time for prostitution
as well as convictions. Most are
in for short terms, usually un
der six months.
Inmates have to line up to be
counted about four times a day.
But according to Miss Meyners,
who was picturing a jail "much
older and with lice," the build
ing and the routine are not
odious. "Its really surprising
how much of your time is
taken up with sweeping," she
said, "But you really don't have
to work very hard."
The regular inmates are well
aware of this fact, she said. Miss
Haley added, "I expected the in
mates to be much more hostile
than they turned out to be."
"Everybody should go to jail,"
Sue Haley said. She called the
prison life a "very valuable ex
perience."
The girls chose to spend five
weekends in jail instead of five
days largely because some did
not want to miss classes. The
judge at their sentencing Oct. 17
had offered them the option but
they had to decide which to do
as a group.
And since the male defendants
were being offered a 10 days or
five weekends choice, the girls
decided to make the punishment
equal regardless of sex. "So
much else in this whole thing
was so unequal," one of them
remarked, "that it seemed the
right thing to do at the time."

The reactions of the girls' par
ents to their jail sentences were
diverse. One girl's parents who
were "pretty upset" flew up to
Stanford to talk to her about
what she had done. 'They're try
ing to be sympathetic although
their views are conservative,"
said. She has chosen to take a
leave of absence for the rest
of the quarter so she can "work
some of these things out."
Senior music major Deborah
Weiner's parents were proud of
her for her actions, she said.
"They support me in this. I'm
lucky."
Pleases Parents
Sophomore Dawn Meyners
also termed herself fortunate. "I
really have fantastic parents,"
she said. "I think they were
really very pleased." Miss Mey
ner's father has been active in
demonstrations and has been in
jail. But her grandmother, she
says, has cut her off.
The Stanford coeds may not
get much studying done in jail,
but they do not express regret
for their actions in Oakland dur
ing the demonstrations. For one
girl the conviction upset all her
plans for the quarter, but oth
ers seem to be taking the whole
thing in stride.
"The prison's an amazing
place," Miss Meyners said. "It's
really a very close community
and a great practical experience
in group dynamics—the most
constructive way I could pos
sibly be spending my weekends."

days largely because some did
not want to miss classes. The
judge at their sentencing Oct. 17
had offered them the option but
they had to decide which to do
as a group.
And since the male defendants
were being offered a 10 days or
five weekends choice, the girls
decided to make the punishment
equal regardless of sex. "So
much else in this whole thing
was so unequal," one of them
remarked, "that it seemed the
right thing to do at the time."

The reactions of the girls' par
ents to their jail sentences were
diverse. One girl's parents who
were "pretty upset" flew up to
Stanford to talk to her about
what she had done. 'They're try
ing to be sympathetic although
their views are conservative,"
said. She has chosen to take a
leave of absence for the rest
of the quarter so she can "work
some of these things out."
Senior music major Deborah
Weiner's parents were proud of
her for her actions, she said.
"They support me in this. I'm
lucky."
Pleases Parents
Sophomore Dawn Meyners
also termed herself fortunate. "I
really have fantastic parents,"
she said. "I think they were
really very pleased." Miss Mey
ner's father has been active in
demonstrations and has been in
jail. But her grandmother, she
says, has cut her off.
The Stanford coeds may not
get much studying done in jail,
but they do not express regret
for their actions in Oakland dur
ing the demonstrations. For one
girl the conviction upset all her
plans for the quarter, but oth
ers seem to be taking the whole
thing in stride.
"The prison's an amazing
place," Miss Meyners said. "It's

FOLKSINGER JOAN CLEMINSHAW takes audience suggestions on songs at Tresidder's Disjoint
coffeehouse Friday night Miss Cleminshaw is the president of Roble.
At 6:15 Saturday mornings at
the corner of Embarcadero and
El Camino in Palo Alto six Stan
ford coeds can be seen leaving
for their weekend jaunt.
But they are not going to some
secluded mountain cabin or to a
beach-side bungalow. Their des
tination is Alameda County cor
rection center at Santa Rita near
Pleasanton. The six coeds are
serving five weekends for con
victions stemming from the re
cent anti-draft demonstrations
in Oakland.
The girls must arrive at the
Jail by 8 a.m. Saturday. If they
do not get there on time, there
will be a 10 to 30 day penalty for
the latecomers. As a precaution,
the cars travelling in the cara
van to Pleasanton stay together
so help will be immediately
available if one breaks down.
The "convicts" get out 6 p.m.
Sundays.
The girls, Phair Corey, Sue
Haley, Mary Hanson, Mary
Heers, Dawn Meyners, and Deb
orah Weiner, can take only three
textbooks with them. Every
thng else is supplied by the
prison, including gown-like uni
forms of denim.
Sue Haley, a junior in biology,
said prison life "really wasn't as
bad as I had expected." Though
they sleep in long dormitory
halls with twenty "little cots"
along each wall, the girls spoke

fondly of the weeping willows
and roses in the prison yard.
During the week prisoners
have regular gardening and
housekeeping chores. But the
"week-enders" have a great deal
of the time for themselves. They
do have to wash dishes, but this
takes only "about forty minutes
of your time."
The girls could spend the rest
of the time reading, but there
are conversations going on. The
small library at Santa Rita is
described by one girl as "pretty
bad."
Baez Appeals
The convicted protesters were
originally kept separate from
the other inmates of the jail
complex, but singer Joan Baez
appealed successfully to the au
thorities to mix everyone. Miss
Baez helped create a relaxed
atmosphere in the complex, one
Stanford girl observed, through
her efforts to talk with the other
inmates and through her sing
ing.
Prison authorities frowned on
the singing, however, and fre
quently asked Baez to do small
chores like cleaning out the dep
uty's office. "It got so she was
cleaning out that office ten times
a day," sophomore Dawn Mey
ners said.
On the whole if the girls seem
busy, the officials leave them
alone.
The other inmates are "mostly

Negroes in for heroin charges,"
one girl told The Daily. Others
are serving time for prostitution
as well as convictions. Most are
in for short terms, usually un
der six months.
Inmates have to line up to be
counted about four times a day.
But according to Miss Meyners,
who was picturing a jail "much
older and with lice," the build
ing and the routine are not
odious. "Its really surprising
how much of your time is
taken up with sweeping," she
said, "But you really don't have
to work very hard."
The regular inmates are well
aware of this fact, she said. Miss
Haley added, "I expected the in
mates to be much more hostile
than they turned out to be."
"Everybody should go to jail,"
Sue Haley said. She called the
prison life a "very valuable ex
perience."
The girls chose to spend five
weekends in jail instead of five
days largely because some did
not want to miss classes. The

have regular gardening and
housekeeping chores. But the
"week-enders" have a great deal
of the time for themselves. They
do have to wash dishes, but this
takes only "about forty minutes
of your time."
The girls could spend the rest
of the time reading, but there
are conversations going on. The
small library at Santa Rita is
described by one girl as "pretty
bad."
Baez Appeals
The convicted protesters were
originally kept separate from
the other inmates of the jail
complex, but singer Joan Baez
appealed successfully to the au
thorities to mix everyone. Miss
Baez helped create a relaxed
atmosphere in the complex, one
Stanford girl observed, through
her efforts to talk with the other
inmates and through her sing
ing.
Prison authorities frowned on
the singing, however, and fre
quently asked Baez to do small
chores like cleaning out the dep
uty's office. "It got so she was
cleaning out that office ten times
a day," sophomore Dawn Mey
ners said.
On the whole if the girls seem
busy, the officials leave them
alone.
The other inmates are "mostly

Negroes in for heroin charges,"
one girl told The Daily. Others
are serving time for prostitution
as well as convictions. Most are
in for short terms, usually un
der six months.
Inmates have to line up to be
counted about four times a day.
But according to Miss Meyners,
who was picturing a jail "much
older and with lice," the build
ing and the routine are not
odious. "Its really surprising
how much of your time is
taken up with sweeping," she
said, "But you really don't have
to work very hard."
The regular inmates are well
aware of this fact, she said. Miss
Haley added, "I expected the in
mates to be much more hostile
than they turned out to be."
"Everybody should go to jail,"
Sue Haley said. She called the
prison life a "very valuable ex
perience."
The girls chose to spend five
weekends in jail instead of five
days largely because some did
not want to miss classes. The
judge at their sentencing Oct. 17
had offered them the option but
they had to decide which to do
as a group.
And since the male defendants
were being offered a 10 days or
five weekends choice, the girls
decided to make the punishment
equal regardless of sex. "So
much else in this whole thing
was so unequal," one of them
remarked, "that it seemed the
right thing to do at the time."

The reactions of the girls' par
ents to their jail sentences were
diverse. One girl's parents who
were "pretty upset" flew up to
Stanford to talk to her about
what she had done. 'They're try
ing to be sympathetic although
their views are conservative,"
said. She has chosen to take a
leave of absence for the rest
of the quarter so she can "work
some of these things out."
Senior music major Deborah
Weiner's parents were proud of
her for her actions, she said.
"They support me in this. I'm
lucky."
Pleases Parents
Sophomore Dawn Meyners
also termed herself fortunate. "I
really have fantastic parents,"
she said. "I think they were
really very pleased." Miss Mey
ner's father has been active in
demonstrations and has been in
jail. But her grandmother, she
says, has cut her off.
The Stanford coeds may not
get much studying done in jail,
but they do not express regret
for their actions in Oakland dur
ing the demonstrations. For one
girl the conviction upset all her
plans for the quarter, but oth
ers seem to be taking the whole
thing in stride.
"The prison's an amazing
place," Miss Meyners said. "It's
really a very close community
and a great practical experience
in group dynamics—the most
constructive way I could pos
sibly be spending my weekends."

FOLKSINGER JOAN CLEMINSHAW takes audience suggestions on songs at Tresidder's Disjoint
coffeehouse Friday night Miss Cleminshaw is the president of Roble.
At 6:15 Saturday mornings at
the corner of Embarcadero and
El Camino in Palo Alto six Stan
ford coeds can be seen leaving
for their weekend jaunt.
But they are not going to some
secluded mountain cabin or to a
beach-side bungalow. Their des
tination is Alameda County cor
rection center at Santa Rita near
Pleasanton. The six coeds are
serving five weekends for con
victions stemming from the re
cent anti-draft demonstrations
in Oakland.
The girls must arrive at the
Jail by 8 a.m. Saturday. If they
do not get there on time, there
will be a 10 to 30 day penalty for
the latecomers. As a precaution,
the cars travelling in the cara
van to Pleasanton stay together
so help will be immediately
available if one breaks down.
The "convicts" get out 6 p.m.
Sundays.
The girls, Phair Corey, Sue
Haley, Mary Hanson, Mary
Heers, Dawn Meyners, and Deb
orah Weiner, can take only three
textbooks with them. Every
thng else is supplied by the
prison, including gown-like uni
forms of denim.
Sue Haley, a junior in biology,
said prison life "really wasn't as
bad as I had expected." Though
they sleep in long dormitory
halls with twenty "little cots"
along each wall, the girls spoke

fondly of the weeping willows
and roses in the prison yard.
