# Shockley Explores Games As Teaching Techniques
## 
### 
Ingenious methods of using
games and puzzles to enable
high school students to "dis
cover" scientific principles for
themselves were described Fri
day evening by Stanford Prof.
William Shockley at Berkeley.
He was principal speaker at a
Claremont Hotel banquet meet
ing of the Southwest Regional
Conference of the National Sci
ence Teachers Association. The
theme of the three-day confer
ence which ended Saturday was
"Problems, Progress and Prom

ise in the Teaching of Science."
Prof. Shockley, who shared
the Nobel Prize for Physics in
1956, said that teaching exper
iments he and his colleagues
carried out with the new game
technique resulted in "actual
improvements in rational rea
soning" among the students.
One such game involves two
players confronted by a pile of
20 matches, from which each
may take one or three matches
in turn. The one who gets the
last match wins.
"The students soon found that
the second player always wins,
no matter how the plays are
made," he said. "This game
teaches a particular invariance
principle of mathematics.
"After experience with three
or four similar games or puzzles
having initially hidden invari
ance principles, the student is
alert for such hidden principles
in new situations. He is ready to
appreciate and understand, or
even to discover, basic laws in
science such as the conservation
of energy.
"In this form of teaching, con
cepts are distilled in nearly pure
form and separated from the
laboratory complexities. It em
ploys the strategy of 'divide and
conquer' by splitting the teach
ing process into two parts—first
the pure essence of conservation
concepts, and second, the conser
vation laws of science.
"One discovery, a consequence
of the concept distillation attack,
was that there is a simplest ex
ample of energy. It involves two
energies of the simplest type—
the potential energies of two
weights on a idealized see-saw,
their energy getting exchanged
as they go up and down," he
said.
"The students can actually dis
cover conservation of energy on
their own trying to solve prob
lems involving such elements,"
said the Stanford physicist.
