# Mistake Jinx Haunts Tribe At Army
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford's football team
seems to have perfected the art
of doing everything right and
wrong at the same time.
That fact came clear Saturday
when the Tribe dropped its sec
ond heartbreaker in a row to
the Cadets of Army, 24-20 in
Michie Stadium at West Point.
The Tribe jumped out to a
10-0 lead, fell behind, and then
regained the lead 20-17 with 6:50
left in the game. Quarterback
Chuck Williams spectacularly
guided the Tribe offense to 22
first downs and 384 total yards.
But marring that side of the
Indian team were six fumbles
(three lost) and three intercep
tions. The Cadets turned three
Card errors directly into 17
points.
No Need For Loss
A game summary shows the
Tribe's loss clearly did not have
to occur.
Stanford took the opening
kickoff and marched 61 yards
before Bill Shoemaker booted a
17 yard field goal.
Fullback Jack Root raced
through the middle of the Army
split six defense for 31 yards on
the first three plays to start the
drive.
Halfback Nate Kirtman picked
up a key first down on a fourth
and two situation, and Greg
Broughton rushes brought the
ball to the nine before the drive
stalled.
Return to Attack
After stopping Army, the In
dians returned to the attack.
Williams completed two passes
to flanker Gene Washington to
take the Tribe to the three.
Jack Root dived into the end
zone from lVz yards out, and
Bill Shoemaker added the extra
point to make the score 10-0.
But fate intervened for the
Cadets several plays later. Safe
ty Tom Massey fumbled a Nick
Kerilko punt on the Stanford 24,
and Army recovered Six plays
later Cadet quarterback Steve
Lindell sneaked in for the score.
Kerilko's PAT kick was good.
Cadet Momentum Builds
Army continued to gain men
tal momentum when the Cadets
stopped the next Indian drive on

the % yard line. Stanford failed
to score after obtaining a first
and goal situation on the four.
Jack Root dived four times at
the endzone but failed to land
in paydirt. The 73 yard drive
ended on the one inch line with
nothing but good yardage statis
tics. It was the first time this
year Stanford has been stopped
inside the ten.
Army capitalized on another
Card mistake shortly before the
end of the first half. Charlie
Bevine intercepted a Williams to
Kirtman pass at the 25 and re
turned it to the 18.
Black Knights Score
The Black Knights of the Hud
son, unable to move the ball,
called on Keriko for a field goal,
and the specialist made good.
The halftime score was 10-10.
Army took the second half
kickoff and moved 57 yards in
a drive powered by the rushes

of backs Chuck Jarvis and Carl
Woessner. However, Donn Ren
wick picked off a Lindell pass at
the 2 to stop the Cadet threat.
But again the Cards turned
unduly generous, as Nate Kirt
man fumbled a handoff from
Williams. Bob Gora recovered
for the Cadets on the six. Steve
Peduto bulled over for the score
on two rushes.
Reciprocity Rules
The two teams turned to reci
procity as a working principle
for the rest of the game. Tom

Massey intercepted an Army
pass, but the Cards had to punt.
Tom Hazelrigg then recovered
a Jarvis fumble, but Greg
Broughton bobbled it back to
the Cadets. Fearing the ball as
if it carried the plague itself,
Peduto fumbled back to the
Tribe.
The Cards finally turned seri
ous when Williams hit split end
Jim Cross to move the ball to
the 15. The Cards could not get
another first down, so Bill Shoe
maker lofted a field goal through
the uprights to narrow the
Army edge to 17-13.
Red Machine Recovers
In the fourth quarter, the
Tribe metamorphosed into the
"Big Red Machine" of publicists'
yore. The Indians ground out 92
yards in 14 plays and five min
utes to regain the lead.
Chuck Williams thrilled a good
contingent of Stanford fans at
West Point as he raced for 15,
7,10, and 15 yard gains. He com
pleted passes to Cross and Wash
ington to move the Tribe to the
Army 16.
Williams then hit tight end
George Buehler on the three.

Greg Broughton dived in for the
score and Shoemaker's PAT was
good.
A determined Tribe defense
stopped the Cadets and Kerilko
had to punt. But the Tribe made
another costly mistake when
Jack Root was called for clip
ping. The penalty nullified a 15
yard run by Williams. The
Cards had to punt.
Last Minute Mlscues
Van Evans, the punt and kick
off return speed merchant, took
Bob Reinhard's punt and sprint
ed 37 yards to the Tribe 13.
Hank Anrzejczak powered in
from the five to give the Cadets
a 24-20 lead with 1:57 left.
Bevins intercepted a Williams
pass to apparently kill the
Tribe's hopes for a last minute
win. But reciprocity ruled again.
Lynn Moore fumbled on the
next play, and tri-captain line
backer Marty Brill recovered to
relight Card hopes.
Williams completed two pass
es to Buehler; but on the second
pass, Boehler fumbled and Ken
Johnson recovered for the Ca
dets. Army ran out the clock for
the win.

GET TOUGH DEFENSE: The unidentified (and helpless) Army ball carrier is going nowhere on this
play as part of the tough Indian defensive unit closes In for the tackle. Leading the Stanford defen
sive effort were Tom Hazelrigg, who had 10 tackles and 1 assist and Marty Brill, who had 8 tackles
and an assist, and also recovered a Cadet fumble. Dick Oliver, playing at defensive left half, contrib
uted 7 tackles; and he, too, picked up an Army loose ball.
