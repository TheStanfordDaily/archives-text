# Stanford Mystery: Why Is The Tribe Blowing It In '67
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford football has become
a great mystery, as well as a
source of deep disappointment,
for many Indian sports fans.
The ingredients of the mys
tery are numerous.
• Excellent success against
non-conference opponents, but a
seeming inability to defeat any
one but Cal in the Pac-8.
• Outstanding statistical per
formances that would normally
insure victory, but fail to win
important games (i.e. UCLA,
Army this season).
• A constant reversion to a
type of "high school play," in
which players fumble, fire inter
ceptions, or commit penalties.
* • A failure to tackle or block
well at key moments.
Action Speaks Louder
, The ingredients of the mys
tery are easily substantiated by
performances on the field.
Stanford last year went 5-5,
but won only one game of five
in the PAC-8, and this year is
3-4 with one win in three confer
ence games. The Cards have
taken nine of their last 11 inter
sectional games.
Against UCLA, the Cards rolled
up a 200 yard total offense ad
vantage over the Bruins, but
still fell short on the scoreboard
total, 21-16. Against Army, the
Indians compiled 100 yards
more than the Cadets, but lost
24-20.
* Mistakes this year have des
"troyed Card hopes in the Oregon
State and Army contests. Down
ing a kickoff on the two and a
12 yard punt helped the Bea
vers win 13-7, and three mis
takes led directly to 17 points
for the Cadets.

Against Washington last year,
three Indian tacklers had end
Dave Williams trapped on the
45, but Williams broke free and
raced to the five to set up the
winning score.
Against UCLA, a breakdown
of pass protection during the
third quarter forced the Tribe
to punt when a field goal had
been in range; and a clipping
penalty destroyed Card hopes of
running out the clock against
Army last Saturday.
The Whipping Boy
Many fans lay the blame at
coach John Ralston's office door.
This phenomena was aptly
phrased by a Stanford football
player when he said, 'When the
buck is passed, it stops at the
coach or the quarterback."
But if any fact stands clear,
it is that Stanford could have
won all the games involved. The
Cards were definitely not unpre
pared, as the statistics show.
And during a game, Ralston's
only major decisions involve
whether to punt, go for a first
down, or try a field goal.
Picking of plays rests with
the quarterback and offensive
coaches Dick Vermeil and Mike
White, who plan series with the

help of press box spotters. The
variety of plays seems to have
increased in the last two losses.
Fans also claim the team has
no spirit because Ralston is the
coach. But nothing could be far
ther from the truth—before the
UCLA game, the team was
chanting "Beat UCLA" in the
locker room with Ralston, and it
was Thursday night. Practices
are generally spirited workouts.
And, if a team itself does let
down in a game, it can only be
the lack of desire to win in the
contestants themselves. But few
Stanford players, if any, have
admitted letting down during a
game.
The Why's Continue
Many Card fans readily admit
that Ralston is a good recruiter,
and gets good material for the
Tribe, but then, by some mysti
cal process, destroys their talent.
This hypothesis has not been
corroborated by any Card foot
ball players, however.
What is it then, that deals
Stanford fortunes such low
blows? The best answer yet is
that bad luck and circumstance
have joined at inopportune mo
ments, and spelled disaster. The
mystery remains.

The Whipping Boy
Many fans lay the blame at
coach John Ralston's office door.
This phenomena was aptly
phrased by a Stanford football
player when he said, 'When the
buck is passed, it stops at the
coach or the quarterback."
But if any fact stands clear,
it is that Stanford could have
won all the games involved. The
Cards were definitely not unpre
pared, as the statistics show.
And during a game, Ralston's
only major decisions involve
whether to punt, go for a first
down, or try a field goal.
Picking of plays rests with
the quarterback and offensive
coaches Dick Vermeil and Mike
White, who plan series with the

help of press box spotters. The
variety of plays seems to have
increased in the last two losses.
Fans also claim the team has
no spirit because Ralston is the
coach. But nothing could be far
ther from the truth—before the
UCLA game, the team was
chanting "Beat UCLA" in the
locker room with Ralston, and it
was Thursday night. Practices
are generally spirited workouts.
And, if a team itself does let
down in a game, it can only be
the lack of desire to win in the
contestants themselves. But few
Stanford players, if any, have
admitted letting down during a
game.
The Why's Continue
Many Card fans readily admit
that Ralston is a good recruiter,
and gets good material for the
Tribe, but then, by some mysti
cal process, destroys their talent.
This hypothesis has not been
corroborated by any Card foot
ball players, however.
What is it then, that deals
Stanford fortunes such low
blows? The best answer yet is
that bad luck and circumstance
have joined at inopportune mo
ments, and spelled disaster. The
