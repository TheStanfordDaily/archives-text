# UCLA Nears Championship
## Cards Down USC, Fall To Bruins 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
UCLA cinched its third
straight Undefeated water polo
national championship, explod
ing late *n the game to deal
Stanford an 8-4 defeat last week
end.
Stanford knocked off USC,
9-8, in sndden death during the
fourth overtime period to take
firm hol<l of the AAWU second
spot.
It wa. d UCLA's Stan Cole who
again thwarted the Indians, hit
ting fivo goals. The Bruin Olym
pic veteran scored six in UCLA's
8-7 victory over Stanford two
weeks ago.
Stamord and UCLA struggled
over 1- one-goal margin until
UCLA surged late in the final
period with two penalty shots
and a field goal to put the game
out o reach. Mark Parmely
scored twice for Stanford. Gary
Sheerer and Greg Buckingham
each cinucked one goal.
Seniors Start
Stariford coach Jim Gaughran
started an all-senior lineup
against USC, and the Cards
moved to a 3-0 first quarter lead.
The Trojans bounced back in the
secona quarter against the other
half of the Indian squad, tying
the game at halftime, 4-4.
The third quarter brought an
agonising barrage of missed
shots as Stanford controlled the
ball but could not find the net.

Regulation time ended with a
7-7 tie on the board.
The Trojans kept pace through
the two regular overtime peri
ods, pushing the game into sud
den death. A Stanford shot
whistled into the goal as the gun
sounded, but it was declared too
late.
No Fouls
Stanford had a total of 8 team
fouls going into the sudden
death playoff periods. The Cards
played 8 minutes without com
mitting the two fouls that would
have given USC a penalty shot
at the goal.
More than two hours after the
game started, John Parker final
ly put the plug into a frustrat
ing morning with a bounce shot
from near half court.
Bob Momsen had an outstand
ing day in the goal for the In
dians —perhaps the only part of
the game the Cards would like
to remember. USC's George
Watson lined up for a penalty
shot and Momsen blocked it
cold.
The ref ruled Momsen was out
too far, and gave Watson an
other try. Again Momsen came
up with the ball. Momsen
stopped still another attempt
later in the game.
Next weekend Stanford plays
USC at Stanford, Friday at 3:30.
Long Beach State invades the
Farm Saturday at 10 a.m. Long
Beach demolished USC earlier

AN INDIAN SCORE: An unidentified Stanford player fires in a goal against UCLA two Saturdays ago.
The Indians lost to the Bruins Saturday in Los Angeles by a score of 8-4, the widest margin In five
years. Tribe nemesis Stan Cole fired In five goals to provide the margin of victory.
UCLA cinched its third
straight Undefeated water polo
national championship, explod
ing late *n the game to deal
Stanford an 8-4 defeat last week
end.
Stanford knocked off USC,
9-8, in sndden death during the
fourth overtime period to take
firm hol<l of the AAWU second
spot.
It wa. d UCLA's Stan Cole who
again thwarted the Indians, hit
ting fivo goals. The Bruin Olym
pic veteran scored six in UCLA's
8-7 victory over Stanford two
weeks ago.
Stamord and UCLA struggled
over 1- one-goal margin until
UCLA surged late in the final
period with two penalty shots
and a field goal to put the game
out o reach. Mark Parmely
scored twice for Stanford. Gary
Sheerer and Greg Buckingham
each cinucked one goal.
Seniors Start
Stariford coach Jim Gaughran
started an all-senior lineup
against USC, and the Cards
moved to a 3-0 first quarter lead.
The Trojans bounced back in the
secona quarter against the other
half of the Indian squad, tying
the game at halftime, 4-4.
The third quarter brought an
agonising barrage of missed
shots as Stanford controlled the
ball but could not find the net.

Regulation time ended with a
7-7 tie on the board.
The Trojans kept pace through
the two regular overtime peri
ods, pushing the game into sud
den death. A Stanford shot
whistled into the goal as the gun
sounded, but it was declared too
late.
No Fouls
Stanford had a total of 8 team
fouls going into the sudden
death playoff periods. The Cards
played 8 minutes without com
mitting the two fouls that would
have given USC a penalty shot
at the goal.
More than two hours after the
game started, John Parker final
ly put the plug into a frustrat
ing morning with a bounce shot
from near half court.
Bob Momsen had an outstand
ing day in the goal for the In
dians —perhaps the only part of
the game the Cards would like
to remember. USC's George
Watson lined up for a penalty
shot and Momsen blocked it
cold.
The ref ruled Momsen was out
too far, and gave Watson an
other try. Again Momsen came
up with the ball. Momsen
stopped still another attempt
later in the game.
Next weekend Stanford plays
USC at Stanford, Friday at 3:30.

Farm Saturday at 10 a.m. Long
