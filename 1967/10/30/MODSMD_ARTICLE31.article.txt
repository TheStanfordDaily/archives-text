## 
### BOB BUND 
Pete Santos ran a blazing
20:10.8 to lead the San Jose
harriers to a 22 to 37 win over
Stanford. San Jose's Santos and
Darryl Dent exchanged leads
through a 4:33 first mile and a
10:22 two mile before Santos
pulled away.
The Indians led by Greg Brock
and Allen Sanford cut more than
29 seconds off their best team
time in three years, but lacked
the depth needed to beat the
Spartans.
In All Time Top Ten
Brock became Stanford's sev
enth best harrier of all time run
ning the 4.2 mile course in 20:31.
Sanford cut twenty-six seconds
off his life time best to rank as
the Indians' ninth best.
Brook Thomas was the Tribe's
third man placing seventh in
21:08. The Spartans placed their
seventh man in front of the In
dians fourth man Jim Letterer
who could only manage an 11th
place with 21:47.
Dave Redwine was the Tribe's
fifth man finishing twelfth in
21:54. Chuck Menz cut almost
thirty seconds from last week's
time to run 22:05. Stanford's sev
enth man, Gary Montante, ran
22:33.
Don Kardong and Duncan Mac-

Donald lead the Stanford Frosh
to a 15 to 43 slam over the San
Jose freshmen. Kardong out
kicked Mac Donald in the last
75 yards to post a 21:15.5 to
21:16.8 victory.
Brian Cox outsprinted Jay Rice
to place third in the meet with
21:50. Rice was timed in 21:51.
Mark Jones completed the slam
placing fifth in 22:05. Pete Fair
child and A 1 Smith were the

Tribe's sixth and seventh men
running 22:54 and 22:55 respec
tively.
The Stanford Frosh are still
undefeated in freshman compe
tition and have shut out their
opponents in both of their dual
meets. They are only five sec
onds off the total team record
of last year's undefeated Frosh
team.
Their last chance to get the
record will be against the Uni
versity of California Frosh on
November 16.
