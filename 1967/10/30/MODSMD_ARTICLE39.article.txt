# New Homes For Faculty To Be Completed By July
## 
### 
New Stanford faculty homes
will soon be rising near the east
edge of campus. The new devel
opment, whose 111 acres will be
subdivided into 190 lots, is now
being landscaped.
The area, known as French
mam's Hill, is near the corner of
Page Mill Road and Foothill
Blvd., adjacent to already-exist
ing homes in the Pine Hill sub
division.
Grading, spreading topsoll and
part of the underground work
have already been completed,

but workers must still pave
roads, build sidewalks, put up
street lamps, and plant trees and
shrubs. Work, which began
three months ago, should end in
July.
The homes will bring the to
tal number of on-campus faculty
residences to about 650.
Stanford provides these lots,
for a small maintenance rent, as
a fringe benefit to the faculty.
The lots, which vary in size
from one-quarter to one-half of
an acre, are leased for up to 80
years. Faculty eligibility is lim
ited to those who have attained
at least assistant professor rank.
Leaseholders submit home
construction plans to the Uni
versity planning office. Houses
must conform to Santa Clara
county and Stanford Univer
sity's own standards.
When the home-owner decides
to move, he may sell to other
eligible faculty and staff mem
bers.
Several distinctive features
will preserve Stanford's rural
atmosphere, according to Dan
Rolfe, a university landscape
architect. All utilities will be un
derground. Over a third of the
land will be preserved for plant
ed recreation areas, turfed fields,
connecting pathways, and a
"green belt" around the entire
111 acres. Thousands of trees,
mainly oak, eucalytus and red
wood, will be planted.
All lots will face cul-de-sacs or
loop streets. Thru traffic will be
carried on collector streets situ
ated away from the houses.
