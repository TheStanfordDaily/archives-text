# SES Suggests Changes In Undergraduate Years
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The Steering Committee of the
Study of Education (SES), in its
first public position paper releas
ed today, proposes major altera
tions in the form and content of
undergraduate education at Stan
ford.
It suggests large modifica
tions in the General Studies pro
gram, including the abolishment
of math and language require
ments, and it proposes the crea
tion of new curricular struc
tures emphasizing independent
and honors work.
These new structures would
eventually allow all students to
design their own undergraduate
programs free of any General
Studies or departmental require
ments.
Experimental College
The committee also calls for
the establishment of an Experi
mental College at Stanford in
which major educational inno
vations can be tested. Involving
only a small random sample of
volunteers at the beginning, this
college would offer programs
such as a freshman year orga
nized around a single common
theme, or an intense interdis
ciplinary study of "modern
thought."
Through the publication of its
paper, "Toward A More Flexible
Undergraduate Program," the
Steering Committee hopes to
"promote discussion and re
sponse throughout the commu
nity that can aid in the process
of arriving at specific proposals
and final decisions."
To facilitate discussion, the
Steering Committee will hold
open hearings. Dates for these
hearings will be set at a commit
tee meeting this afternoon. The
committee will also develop
other channels for exchanging
ideas. One possibility is circu
lating a questionnaire.
The committee hopes to re

ceive as much comment on its
philosophy for undergraduate
education as its specific propo
sals. This philosophy is enumer
ated in three objectives for un
dergraduate education. "(1) To
develop the means and motiva
tion for continued learning as a
life-long enterprise; (2) to pro
mote intellectual honesty and
vigor; and (3) to enhance the
capacity to relate knowledge to
personal awareness and public
values."
The committee states, "The
present curricular arrangements
in most American colleges —
Stanford included — do not ade
quately promote these aims.
They place too great an empha
sis on the identification of a cer
tain body of knowledge which
every educated man is supposed
to possess."

Turning to the particular situ
ation at Stanford, the committee
continues, "The monolithic re
quirements at Stanford, as at
most other institutions, have
operated on the assumption that
some prescribed dosage is good
for everyone or, even worse,
harmful to no one. In a society
that cherishes individual differ
ences as contributing to the rich
ness of the whole, such a regi
men seems woefully short-sight
ed."
Modify Requirements
The paper proceeds by identi
fying three major areas at Stan
ford through which the commit
tee's philosophy can be imple
mented. These are: a modified
General Studies plus depart
mental major program, an in
dependent study University Hon

ors Program, and an experi
mental program.
The committee feels that a
modified General Studies pro
gram would probably satisfy
the needs of most students.
In the realm of general re
quirements, the committee sug
gests the abolishment of math
and language prescriptions. The
committee says,"The options
presently available in mathema
tics are not responsive to the
interests and needs of many stu
dents in the humanities and so
cial sciences."
On the language issue, the
paper states, "There does not
seem to be an adequate basis for
requiring all students to attain
a fixed proficiency in a foreign
language." The committee, how
ever, notes that departmental
