# SES Suggests Changes In Undergraduate Years
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The Steering Committee of the
Study of Education (SES), in its
first public position paper releas
ed today, proposes major altera
tions in the form and content of
undergraduate education at Stan
ford.
It suggests large modifica
tions in the General Studies pro
gram, including the abolishment
of math and language require
ments, and it proposes the crea
tion of new curricular struc
tures emphasizing independent
and honors work.
These new structures would
eventually allow all students to
design their own undergraduate
programs free of any General
Studies or departmental require
ments.
Experimental College
The committee also calls for
the establishment of an Experi
mental College at Stanford in
which major educational inno
vations can be tested. Involving
only a small random sample of
volunteers at the beginning, this
college would offer programs
such as a freshman year orga
nized around a single common
theme, or an intense interdis
ciplinary study of "modern
thought."
Through the publication of its
paper, "Toward A More Flexible
Undergraduate Program," the
Steering Committee hopes to
"promote discussion and re
sponse throughout the commu
nity that can aid in the process
of arriving at specific proposals
and final decisions."
To facilitate discussion, the
Steering Committee will hold
open hearings. Dates for these
hearings will be set at a commit
tee meeting this afternoon. The
committee will also develop
other channels for exchanging
ideas. One possibility is circu
lating a questionnaire.
The committee hopes to re

ceive as much comment on its
philosophy for undergraduate
education as its specific propo
sals. This philosophy is enumer
ated in three objectives for un
dergraduate education. "(1) To
develop the means and motiva
tion for continued learning as a
life-long enterprise; (2) to pro
mote intellectual honesty and
vigor; and (3) to enhance the
capacity to relate knowledge to
personal awareness and public
values."
The committee states, "The
present curricular arrangements
in most American colleges —
Stanford included — do not ade
quately promote these aims.
They place too great an empha
sis on the identification of a cer
tain body of knowledge which
every educated man is supposed
to possess."

Turning to the particular situ
ation at Stanford, the committee
continues, "The monolithic re
quirements at Stanford, as at
most other institutions, have
operated on the assumption that
some prescribed dosage is good
for everyone or, even worse,
harmful to no one. In a society
that cherishes individual differ
ences as contributing to the rich
ness of the whole, such a regi
men seems woefully short-sight
ed."
Modify Requirements
The paper proceeds by identi
fying three major areas at Stan
ford through which the commit
tee's philosophy can be imple
mented. These are: a modified
General Studies plus depart
mental major program, an in
dependent study University Hon

ors Program, and an experi
mental program.
The committee feels that a
modified General Studies pro
gram would probably satisfy
the needs of most students.
In the realm of general re
quirements, the committee sug
gests the abolishment of math
and language prescriptions. The
committee says,"The options
presently available in mathema
tics are not responsive to the
interests and needs of many stu
dents in the humanities and so
cial sciences."
On the language issue, the
paper states, "There does not
seem to be an adequate basis for
requiring all students to attain
a fixed proficiency in a foreign
language." The committee, how
ever, notes that departmental
and study-abroad needs might
require study of a language.
The committee suggests that
the general study of reading and
writing cannot be served in a
single course, but rather must
be stressed throughout the
whole university curriculum. It
also claims that exposure to his
torical studies should not rely on
the Western Civilization course,
but should come through a
broader set of options.
Finally, on the question of
studying in depth one of the
three broad disciplines (science
and technology, social science,
and humanities) the committee
says that students should be al
lowed to choose at any level
which suits their interest and
background.
The report continues by pre
senting ideas for new courses
that should be offered within
the General Studies framework.
The committee feels "more
meaningful offerings in science
and technology for the non
scientist looms large."
It also feels that more prob
lem-centered courses are needed,
especially in areas such as ur
ban affairs.
More Independence
In the area of independent
work, the committee proposes
that there be more off-campus
projects, and that there be a
change in the last quarter of the
senior year allowing for more
productive use of energy. A spe
cific suggestion is "an integra
tive senior seminar or essay"
that would provide a common
culminating effort to the under
graduate years.
The committee emphasizes the
need for more honors work in
the university. It notes that in
the Class of '67, only 25 per cent
of those graduating with "dis
tinction" or "great distinction"
took part in an honors program.
The section of modifications
in General Studies concludes
with proposals for the freshman
year and course structures.
The committee feels that more
senior faculty members should
be teaching courses offered to
freshmen. It also suggests an
increase in the number of fresh
man seminars presently offered.
Course structure changes in

clude making all principal cour
ses five units so students can
take three courses per quarter,
and keeping school and depart
mental requirements at a mini
mum.
The final major area of the
report concerns "New Curricu
lar Structures". One innovation
presented is a University Hon
ors Program of Independent
Study. This would be a program
offered to a limited number of
students who could "design
their entire undergraduate pro
gram free of all formal require
ments". Admission to the pro
gram would require the ap
proval of a faculty group estab
lished for that purpose.

The committee hopes that
such a program, without the
honors aspect, should eventually
be offered to all students.
The Experimental College is
the committee's final proposal.
It would have its own faculty
drawn from volunteers on the
regular faculty who would be
relieved of other duties.
The report concludes by
noting that the Study of Educa
tion has established a subcom
mittee on University Govern
ment that could develop budge
tary and administrative plans
for the implementation of its
proposals if they receive gen
eral approval.

ses five units so students can
take three courses per quarter,
and keeping school and depart
mental requirements at a mini
mum.
The final major area of the
report concerns "New Curricu
lar Structures". One innovation
presented is a University Hon
ors Program of Independent
Study. This would be a program
offered to a limited number of
students who could "design
their entire undergraduate pro
gram free of all formal require
ments". Admission to the pro
gram would require the ap
proval of a faculty group estab
lished for that purpose.

The committee hopes that
such a program, without the
honors aspect, should eventually
be offered to all students.
The Experimental College is
the committee's final proposal.
It would have its own faculty
drawn from volunteers on the
regular faculty who would be
relieved of other duties.
The report concludes by
noting that the Study of Educa
tion has established a subcom
mittee on University Govern
ment that could develop budge
tary and administrative plans
for the implementation of its
proposals if they receive gen
eral approval.
The Steering Committee of the
Study of Education (SES), in its
first public position paper releas
ed today, proposes major altera
tions in the form and content of
undergraduate education at Stan
ford.
It suggests large modifica
tions in the General Studies pro
gram, including the abolishment
of math and language require
ments, and it proposes the crea
tion of new curricular struc
tures emphasizing independent
and honors work.
These new structures would
eventually allow all students to
design their own undergraduate
programs free of any General
Studies or departmental require
ments.
Experimental College
The committee also calls for
the establishment of an Experi
mental College at Stanford in
which major educational inno
vations can be tested. Involving
only a small random sample of
volunteers at the beginning, this
college would offer programs
such as a freshman year orga
nized around a single common
theme, or an intense interdis
ciplinary study of "modern
thought."
Through the publication of its
paper, "Toward A More Flexible
Undergraduate Program," the
Steering Committee hopes to
"promote discussion and re
sponse throughout the commu
nity that can aid in the process
of arriving at specific proposals
and final decisions."
To facilitate discussion, the
Steering Committee will hold
open hearings. Dates for these
hearings will be set at a commit
tee meeting this afternoon. The
committee will also develop
other channels for exchanging
ideas. One possibility is circu
lating a questionnaire.
The committee hopes to re

ceive as much comment on its
philosophy for undergraduate
education as its specific propo
sals. This philosophy is enumer
ated in three objectives for un
dergraduate education. "(1) To
develop the means and motiva
tion for continued learning as a
life-long enterprise; (2) to pro
mote intellectual honesty and
vigor; and (3) to enhance the
capacity to relate knowledge to
personal awareness and public
values."
The committee states, "The
present curricular arrangements
in most American colleges —
Stanford included — do not ade
quately promote these aims.
They place too great an empha
sis on the identification of a cer
tain body of knowledge which
every educated man is supposed
to possess."

Turning to the particular situ
ation at Stanford, the committee
continues, "The monolithic re
quirements at Stanford, as at
most other institutions, have
operated on the assumption that
some prescribed dosage is good
for everyone or, even worse,
harmful to no one. In a society
that cherishes individual differ
ences as contributing to the rich
ness of the whole, such a regi
men seems woefully short-sight
ed."
Modify Requirements
The paper proceeds by identi
fying three major areas at Stan
ford through which the commit
tee's philosophy can be imple
mented. These are: a modified
General Studies plus depart
mental major program, an in
dependent study University Hon

ors Program, and an experi
mental program.
The committee feels that a
modified General Studies pro
gram would probably satisfy
the needs of most students.
In the realm of general re
quirements, the committee sug
gests the abolishment of math
and language prescriptions. The
committee says,"The options
presently available in mathema
tics are not responsive to the
interests and needs of many stu
dents in the humanities and so
cial sciences."
On the language issue, the
paper states, "There does not
seem to be an adequate basis for
requiring all students to attain
a fixed proficiency in a foreign
language." The committee, how
ever, notes that departmental
and study-abroad needs might
require study of a language.
The committee suggests that
the general study of reading and
writing cannot be served in a
single course, but rather must
be stressed throughout the
whole university curriculum. It
also claims that exposure to his
torical studies should not rely on
the Western Civilization course,
but should come through a
broader set of options.
Finally, on the question of
studying in depth one of the
three broad disciplines (science
and technology, social science,
and humanities) the committee
says that students should be al
lowed to choose at any level
which suits their interest and
background.
The report continues by pre
senting ideas for new courses
that should be offered within
the General Studies framework.
The committee feels "more
meaningful offerings in science
and technology for the non
scientist looms large."
It also feels that more prob
lem-centered courses are needed,
especially in areas such as ur
ban affairs.
More Independence
In the area of independent
work, the committee proposes
that there be more off-campus
projects, and that there be a
change in the last quarter of the
senior year allowing for more
productive use of energy. A spe
cific suggestion is "an integra
tive senior seminar or essay"
that would provide a common
culminating effort to the under
graduate years.
The committee emphasizes the
need for more honors work in
the university. It notes that in
the Class of '67, only 25 per cent
of those graduating with "dis
tinction" or "great distinction"
took part in an honors program.
The section of modifications
in General Studies concludes
with proposals for the freshman
year and course structures.
The committee feels that more
senior faculty members should
be teaching courses offered to
freshmen. It also suggests an
increase in the number of fresh
man seminars presently offered.

theme, or an intense interdis
ciplinary study of "modern
thought."
Through the publication of its
paper, "Toward A More Flexible
Undergraduate Program," the
Steering Committee hopes to
"promote discussion and re
sponse throughout the commu
nity that can aid in the process
of arriving at specific proposals
and final decisions."
To facilitate discussion, the
Steering Committee will hold
open hearings. Dates for these
hearings will be set at a commit
tee meeting this afternoon. The
committee will also develop
other channels for exchanging
ideas. One possibility is circu
lating a questionnaire.
The committee hopes to re

ceive as much comment on its
philosophy for undergraduate
education as its specific propo
sals. This philosophy is enumer
ated in three objectives for un
dergraduate education. "(1) To
develop the means and motiva
tion for continued learning as a
life-long enterprise; (2) to pro
mote intellectual honesty and
vigor; and (3) to enhance the
capacity to relate knowledge to
personal awareness and public
values."
The committee states, "The
present curricular arrangements
in most American colleges —
Stanford included — do not ade
quately promote these aims.
They place too great an empha
sis on the identification of a cer
tain body of knowledge which
every educated man is supposed
to possess."

Turning to the particular situ
ation at Stanford, the committee
continues, "The monolithic re
quirements at Stanford, as at
most other institutions, have
operated on the assumption that
some prescribed dosage is good
for everyone or, even worse,
harmful to no one. In a society
that cherishes individual differ
ences as contributing to the rich
ness of the whole, such a regi
men seems woefully short-sight
ed."
Modify Requirements
The paper proceeds by identi
fying three major areas at Stan
ford through which the commit
tee's philosophy can be imple
mented. These are: a modified
General Studies plus depart
mental major program, an in
dependent study University Hon

ors Program, and an experi
mental program.
The committee feels that a
modified General Studies pro
gram would probably satisfy
the needs of most students.
In the realm of general re
quirements, the committee sug
gests the abolishment of math
and language prescriptions. The
committee says,"The options
presently available in mathema
tics are not responsive to the
interests and needs of many stu
dents in the humanities and so
cial sciences."
On the language issue, the
paper states, "There does not
seem to be an adequate basis for
requiring all students to attain
a fixed proficiency in a foreign
language." The committee, how
ever, notes that departmental
and study-abroad needs might
require study of a language.
The committee suggests that
the general study of reading and
writing cannot be served in a
single course, but rather must
be stressed throughout the
whole university curriculum. It
also claims that exposure to his
torical studies should not rely on
the Western Civilization course,
but should come through a
broader set of options.
Finally, on the question of
studying in depth one of the
three broad disciplines (science
and technology, social science,
and humanities) the committee
says that students should be al
lowed to choose at any level
which suits their interest and
background.
The report continues by pre
senting ideas for new courses
that should be offered within
the General Studies framework.
The committee feels "more
meaningful offerings in science
and technology for the non
scientist looms large."
It also feels that more prob
lem-centered courses are needed,
especially in areas such as ur
ban affairs.
More Independence
In the area of independent
work, the committee proposes
that there be more off-campus
projects, and that there be a
change in the last quarter of the
senior year allowing for more
productive use of energy. A spe
cific suggestion is "an integra
tive senior seminar or essay"
that would provide a common
culminating effort to the under
graduate years.
The committee emphasizes the
need for more honors work in
the university. It notes that in
the Class of '67, only 25 per cent
of those graduating with "dis
tinction" or "great distinction"
took part in an honors program.
The section of modifications
in General Studies concludes
with proposals for the freshman
year and course structures.
The committee feels that more
senior faculty members should
be teaching courses offered to
freshmen. It also suggests an
increase in the number of fresh
man seminars presently offered.
Course structure changes in

clude making all principal cour
ses five units so students can
take three courses per quarter,
and keeping school and depart
mental requirements at a mini
mum.
The final major area of the
report concerns "New Curricu
lar Structures". One innovation
presented is a University Hon
ors Program of Independent
Study. This would be a program
offered to a limited number of
students who could "design
their entire undergraduate pro
gram free of all formal require
ments". Admission to the pro
gram would require the ap
proval of a faculty group estab
lished for that purpose.

The committee hopes that
such a program, without the
honors aspect, should eventually
be offered to all students.
The Experimental College is
the committee's final proposal.
It would have its own faculty
drawn from volunteers on the
regular faculty who would be
relieved of other duties.
The report concludes by
noting that the Study of Educa
tion has established a subcom
mittee on University Govern
ment that could develop budge
tary and administrative plans
for the implementation of its
proposals if they receive gen
eral approval.

The committee also calls for
the establishment of an Experi
mental College at Stanford in
which major educational inno
vations can be tested. Involving
only a small random sample of
volunteers at the beginning, this
college would offer programs
such as a freshman year orga

paper states, "There does not
seem to be an adequate basis for
requiring all students to attain
a fixed proficiency in a foreign
language." The committee, how
ever, notes that departmental
and study-abroad needs might
require study of a language.
The committee suggests that
the general study of reading and
writing cannot be served in a
single course, but rather must
be stressed throughout the
whole university curriculum. It
also claims that exposure to his
torical studies should not rely on
the Western Civilization course,
but should come through a
broader set of options.
Finally, on the question of
studying in depth one of the
three broad disciplines (science
and technology, social science,
and humanities) the committee
says that students should be al
lowed to choose at any level
which suits their interest and
background.
The report continues by pre
senting ideas for new courses
that should be offered within
the General Studies framework.
The committee feels "more
meaningful offerings in science
and technology for the non
scientist looms large."
It also feels that more prob
lem-centered courses are needed,
especially in areas such as ur
ban affairs.
More Independence
In the area of independent
work, the committee proposes
that there be more off-campus
projects, and that there be a
change in the last quarter of the
senior year allowing for more
productive use of energy. A spe
cific suggestion is "an integra
tive senior seminar or essay"
that would provide a common
culminating effort to the under
graduate years.
The committee emphasizes the
need for more honors work in
the university. It notes that in
the Class of '67, only 25 per cent
of those graduating with "dis
tinction" or "great distinction"
took part in an honors program.
The section of modifications
in General Studies concludes
with proposals for the freshman
year and course structures.
The committee feels that more
senior faculty members should
be teaching courses offered to
freshmen. It also suggests an
increase in the number of fresh
man seminars presently offered.
Course structure changes in

clude making all principal cour
ses five units so students can
take three courses per quarter,
and keeping school and depart
mental requirements at a mini
mum.
The final major area of the
report concerns "New Curricu
lar Structures". One innovation
presented is a University Hon
ors Program of Independent
Study. This would be a program
offered to a limited number of
students who could "design
their entire undergraduate pro
gram free of all formal require
ments". Admission to the pro
gram would require the ap
proval of a faculty group estab
lished for that purpose.

The committee hopes that
such a program, without the
honors aspect, should eventually
be offered to all students.
The Experimental College is
the committee's final proposal.
It would have its own faculty
drawn from volunteers on the
regular faculty who would be
relieved of other duties.
The report concludes by
noting that the Study of Educa
tion has established a subcom
mittee on University Govern
ment that could develop budge
tary and administrative plans
for the implementation of its
proposals if they receive gen
eral approval.
The Steering Committee of the
Study of Education (SES), in its
first public position paper releas
ed today, proposes major altera
tions in the form and content of
undergraduate education at Stan
ford.
It suggests large modifica
tions in the General Studies pro
gram, including the abolishment
of math and language require
ments, and it proposes the crea
tion of new curricular struc
tures emphasizing independent
and honors work.
These new structures would
eventually allow all students to
design their own undergraduate
programs free of any General
Studies or departmental require
ments.
Experimental College
The committee also calls for
the establishment of an Experi
mental College at Stanford in
which major educational inno
vations can be tested. Involving
only a small random sample of
volunteers at the beginning, this
college would offer programs
such as a freshman year orga
nized around a single common
theme, or an intense interdis
ciplinary study of "modern
thought."
Through the publication of its
paper, "Toward A More Flexible
Undergraduate Program," the
Steering Committee hopes to
"promote discussion and re
sponse throughout the commu
nity that can aid in the process
of arriving at specific proposals
and final decisions."
To facilitate discussion, the
Steering Committee will hold
open hearings. Dates for these
hearings will be set at a commit
tee meeting this afternoon. The
committee will also develop
other channels for exchanging
ideas. One possibility is circu
lating a questionnaire.
The committee hopes to re

ceive as much comment on its
philosophy for undergraduate
education as its specific propo
sals. This philosophy is enumer
ated in three objectives for un
dergraduate education. "(1) To
develop the means and motiva
tion for continued learning as a
life-long enterprise; (2) to pro
mote intellectual honesty and
vigor; and (3) to enhance the
capacity to relate knowledge to
personal awareness and public
values."
The committee states, "The
present curricular arrangements
in most American colleges —
Stanford included — do not ade
quately promote these aims.
They place too great an empha
sis on the identification of a cer
tain body of knowledge which
every educated man is supposed
to possess."

Turning to the particular situ
ation at Stanford, the committee
continues, "The monolithic re
quirements at Stanford, as at
most other institutions, have
operated on the assumption that
some prescribed dosage is good
for everyone or, even worse,
harmful to no one. In a society
that cherishes individual differ
ences as contributing to the rich
ness of the whole, such a regi
men seems woefully short-sight
ed."
Modify Requirements
The paper proceeds by identi
fying three major areas at Stan
ford through which the commit
tee's philosophy can be imple
mented. These are: a modified
General Studies plus depart
mental major program, an in
dependent study University Hon

ors Program, and an experi
mental program.
The committee feels that a
modified General Studies pro
gram would probably satisfy
the needs of most students.
In the realm of general re
quirements, the committee sug
gests the abolishment of math
and language prescriptions. The
committee says,"The options
presently available in mathema
tics are not responsive to the
interests and needs of many stu
dents in the humanities and so
cial sciences."
On the language issue, the
paper states, "There does not
seem to be an adequate basis for
requiring all students to attain
a fixed proficiency in a foreign
language." The committee, how
ever, notes that departmental
and study-abroad needs might
require study of a language.
