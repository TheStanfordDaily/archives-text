# Position Paper Culminates First Stage Of Reappraisal
## 
### 
The Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) culminates its
first nine months of effort today
with the publication of its posi
tion paper on undergraduate
education.
The publication, however,
only concludes the first step of
the Study's two year sweeping
reevaluation of all aspects of
the University.
Beginning today, the Steering
Committee of the Study, author
of the position paper and direct
ing for the Study, will ab
sorb comments on its proposals
and then return to rethink for
final decisions.
This process will be repeated

many times in the future as the
Study begins to issue tentative
proposals in all areas of Stan
ford.
Origins of the Study go back
to last fall. At that time the
President established a faculty
student group called the Plan
ning Committee for the Study
of Stanford's Educational Pro
gram. This group concluded its
work in early December by sug
gesting that a broad, two-year
study be conducted.
Student Demands
While this group was meet
ing, student demands for educa
tional reform began to grow,
led by David Harris, student
body president,

The method for selecting stu
dent members generated a con
troversy that left the Study
with a good deal of student
enmity as it began its work.
Some students felt that student
members should have been se
lected by the student body rath
er than by Packer himself.
Through open meetings and
time, however, much of the ini
tial resentment faded, and the
Study now operates with coop
eration from the students.
The Steering Committee will
turn next to a study of graduate
education. At the same time it
will begin evaluating proposals
coming from topic committees.
