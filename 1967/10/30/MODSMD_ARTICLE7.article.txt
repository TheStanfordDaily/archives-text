# Stanford-In-Washington
## Summer Intern Applicants To Meet 
### 
Applications for summer jobs
with senators, congressmen,
and federal agencies in Wash
ington, D.C., or with the state
government in Sacramento will
be available at an organizational
meeting of Stanford-in-Washing
ton tomorrow at 5:00 in the
Large Lounge of Tresidder.
Stanford-in-Washington is the
oldest and largest intern pro
gram in the national capitol,
having grown in six years from
14 law students to 115 students
from every class at Stanford.
Ten per cent of the students
working on the Hill are from
Stanford, according to program
president Greg Murphy.
Murphy emphasized that be
cause competition for positions
in Washington Is increasing
every year, Stanford-in-Wash
ington hopes to have all appli
cations in by December.
Applicants are screened by a
committee of former interns,
which places students not only
with congressmen from their
home districts, but in other con
gressional offices, and with fed
eral agencies.
Murphy will fly to Washing

ton during Christmas break,
spring break, and during Win
ter quarter to discuss placement
and jobs with potential employ
ers.
After selection, Stanford-in-
Washington plans an extensive
orientation program.
As the oldest and largest pro
gram on the Hill, Stanford en
joys perhaps the best reputa
tion of the internship programs.

Before joining fellow interns
Ralph Baxter, Chris Hailwood,
and Julie Johnson in a panel dis
cussion of experiences in Wash
ington, Murphy will distribute
applications and explain applica
tion procedures. The panel will
answer questions from prospec
tive interns.
Applications will also be avail
able for two-year-old Stanford-

in-Sacramento, which is modeled
after Stanford-in-Washington.
Jobs have been available in var
ious government offices, such as
under the lieutenant-governor
and in the Office of Economic
Opportunity.
All students, regardless of po
litical beliefs, class, or major,
are eligible for the internship
program.
