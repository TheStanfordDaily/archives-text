# Axe Comm Still Missing Axe
## 
### 
Chances for recovery of the
Axe in time for this year's Big
Game (Nov. 18) seem remote.
Rescue efforts have "hit a
dead end right now," according
to Neal Okabayashi, director of
Axe Comm's Rally Commission.
"Truthfully, I think the odds
are very slim," he continued.
"I have no conception how we're
going to get it back."
The Axe, taken from its Tre
sidder Union case last May 12,
has been the object of at least

one recent attempt, however.
Last week a Stanford student
invaded the suspected Beta Theta
Pi House at Cal but found noth
ing.
Asked about results from a
meeting held three weeks ago,
Okabayashi could only relate
that "there are different Httle
pockets of ideas on how to get
the axe back, but there is little
coordination."
The main problem, he said, is
that Cal has not put their stolen
prize on public display. "Until

they do, we can't get a trace on
it. And without a trace there
can be no definite plans for res
cue."
"Nevertheless," Okabayashi
noted spiritedly, "we're going to
try. We have gotten information
in the past from friends at Cal
and through the underground
grapevine."
He also added an appeal for
ideas from the general student
body and closer coordination
with any self-styled groups now
contemplating a rescue attempt.
