That's the date you can "brainstorm" with our
representative on your campus. Use this inter
view to find out what's going on in fundamental
and applied research, engineering, manufactur
ing, or programming at Xerox.
Ask him how Xerox fits into the entire spectrum of
graphic communications. Probe into the publish
ing aspects. Inquire about information storage
and retrieval. Put your questions on a global basis
and relate them to the knowledge explosion that's
going on all over the world. And, don't be sur
prised if you begin to form some new ideas about
Xerox. Xerox is that kind of company.
If you want to be a little more specific, question
him about LDX (Long Distance Xerography). Find
out what it is today and what role it will play in
tomorrow's integrated computer/communication
networks. From this specific, you'll be able to
realize the interplay of chemistry, optics, mathe
matical analysis and systems engineering in de
veloping new products.
We're looking forward to meeting you and answer
ing your questions. As well as posing some of our
own.
