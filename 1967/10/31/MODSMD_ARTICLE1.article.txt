### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Recruiting interviews for the
Central Intelligence Agency
have been moved from the
Placement Center to Encina
Hall in anticipation of an anti-
CIA sit-in tomorrow.
The purpose of the move, ac
cording to Provost Richard Ly
man, is "so the rest of the place
ment service will not be dis
turbed by demonstrations."
At a noon rally yesterday,
Students for a Democratic Soci
ety members attacked the CIA
as dangerous to a free society
and said it was antithetical to the
ends of a university and there
fore had no place in one.
Ramparts Editor
Robert Avakian, research edi
tor of Ramparts magazine,
charged the CIA was part of a
liberal facade of the U.S. gov
ernment while its real opera
tions were far from liberal.
Avakian, who has conducted
research into CIA activities for
Ramparts, called for the use of
force to keep the CIA off the
campus.
Economics graduate student
Andy Parnes said, "If the CIA
came to discuss its methods and
tactics ... in Memorial Audi
torium, I'd welcome them." But,
he added, "By their very nature,
they're alien to open discus
sion."
CIA Fronts
Fred Goff, who has researched
CIA activities in the Dominican
Republic, blamed it for the over
throw of Juan Bosch's govern

ment in 1963. "Bosch's govern
ment was thoroughly pene
trated by the CIA," he said.
Goff also said CIA fronts ex
ist on the Stanford campus, cit
ing the Hoover Institution as an
example. "There are faculty
members on the CIA payroll."
"I think people should really
ask themselves what their work
is used for and what they want
it to be used for," he added.
Provost Replies
Provost Lyman replied today
to a letter Friday from Richard
Bogart of SDS. Bogart had
asked the administration to can
cel CIA interviews.
Lyman's letter to Bogart said,
"I can think of nothing more
antithetical to the values that a
university seeks to cherish than
to deny access to any person or
group because of disagreement
with their views.
"How would you react to a re
el uest by those who strongly
differ with the goals of your
own organization that it be
banned from the campus?"
Lyman's letter concluded, "I
can assure you that Stanford is
not going into the business of
thought control, on your behalf
or anyone else's."
Lyman Elaborates
In an interview later yester
day, Lyman said, "There is a
clear line to me between liberty
to protest and physical force to
impose your point of view on
people who don't agree."
He compared the proposed sit
in at the CIA interviews with
sit-ins in the South.

"The sit-ins in the South
tested the constitutionality of
racial segregation," he said.
"Sit-ins here would only test the
University s right to discipline
the sit-inners."
Lyman added he thought a
court would probably uphold
the University's right to discip
line.
Lyman replied also to the ar
gument that the CIA is "by its
very nature, alien to open dis
cussion," and that therefore it
could not defend its recruiting

interviews on the grounds of
free speech.
He said this has been the
standard Red-baiting argument
for years, especially during the
McCarthy years.
"You'd have to set up a sort
of test for who was an enemy
of democracy. The university is
the last place I'd like to see that
happen," he said.
Lyman said the decision to let
the CIA recruit on campus was
routine and not even discussed
above the Placement Center
level until SDS raised the issue.

Fred Goff, who has researched
CIA activities in the Dominican
Republic, blamed it for the over
throw of Juan Bosch's govern

ment in 1963. "Bosch's govern

Goff also said CIA fronts ex

members on the CIA payroll."
"I think people should really
ask themselves what their work

Provost Replies
Provost Lyman replied today
to a letter Friday from Richard
Bogart of SDS. Bogart had
asked the administration to can
cel CIA interviews.
Lyman's letter to Bogart said,
"I can think of nothing more
antithetical to the values that a
university seeks to cherish than
to deny access to any person or
group because of disagreement
with their views.
"How would you react to a re
el uest by those who strongly
differ with the goals of your
own organization that it be
banned from the campus?"
Lyman's letter concluded, "I
can assure you that Stanford is
not going into the business of
thought control, on your behalf
or anyone else's."
Lyman Elaborates
In an interview later yester
day, Lyman said, "There is a
clear line to me between liberty
to protest and physical force to
impose your point of view on
people who don't agree."
He compared the proposed sit
in at the CIA interviews with
sit-ins in the South.

"The sit-ins in the South
tested the constitutionality of
racial segregation," he said.
"Sit-ins here would only test the
University s right to discipline
the sit-inners."
Lyman added he thought a
court would probably uphold
the University's right to discip
line.
Lyman replied also to the ar
gument that the CIA is "by its
very nature, alien to open dis
cussion," and that therefore it
could not defend its recruiting

interviews on the grounds of
free speech.
He said this has been the
standard Red-baiting argument
for years, especially during the
McCarthy years.
"You'd have to set up a sort
of test for who was an enemy
of democracy. The university is
the last place I'd like to see that
happen," he said.
Lyman said the decision to let
the CIA recruit on campus was
routine and not even discussed
above the Placement Center
level until SDS raised the issue.
