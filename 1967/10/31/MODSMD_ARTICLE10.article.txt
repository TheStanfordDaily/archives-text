## 'This Year At SU'— The Oracle Speaks 
### Robert E. Stone 
It's prediction time — that
glorious moment when I stick
my neck out to tell you what's
going to happen around here in
the next few months. (Some of
this is going to be pretty racy,
so if you've got a weak stomach,
better stop here).
Prediction No. 1: Peter Ly
man, student body and of in
crowd hero, will resign by Feb
ruary 1. Lyman is already tired
of his job, and, like many other
presidents, has figured out that
he can't do what he wants to do.
Caesare, vice-student body, will
not resign with his boss. His
other bosses won't let him.
Prediction No. 2: John Gard
ner, Health, Education and Wel
fare head, will not be Stanford's
next President. Not to be con
fused with the student body,
Gardner feels that he can't leave
Washington now. Other choices
are Robert Sears, Richard Ly
man, also not to be confused
with the student body, and Dean
Smith. Take your pick.
Prediction No. 3: Here's a
shocker for the boys over in
Number 10—Stanford will have
a new president by January 1,
1968, according to well placed
sources
Prediction No. 4: Preliminary
results of the SES, Study of Ed
ucation at Stanford, will cause
the program leaders to change
the name to CESS, crappy edu
cation, Stanford style.
Prediction No. 5: Winning Big
Game will not save John Ral
stons' neck this year.
Prediction No. 6: Stanford
Repertory Theater will lose
almost as much money this year
doing small shows as they did
last year doing big shows. The
end of the Rocky grant will also
be the end of SRT.
Prediction No. 7: The Daily
will go back to a 6 column front
page with the next volume.
Thank god—God?

Prediction No. 8: 52 cases of
venereal disease will be reported
at the health center this year.
Only two of them will be girls.
Prediction No. 9: Dean Napier
will leave the Farm within the
year. He can't stand arguing
with people who agree with
him.
Prediction No. 10: Israel will
enter the war in Vietnam on the
side of the U.S. Egypt will pro
test this flagrant violation of
her territory.
Prediction No. 11: Drs. Katz
and Sanford will be refused
tenure for failure to publish.
Prediction No. 12: 50 per cent
of the freshman class will lose
all innocence by June. The other
50 per cent never had any.
Prediction No. 13: The S.F.
Examiner will fold in less than
three years.
Prediction No. 14: All campus
residences will be de facto co
educational next year.
Prediction No. 15: The Frosh
book will be available next
week. Just in time for Thanks
giving ski weekends.
Prediction No. 16: Shirley
Temple Black will be elected to
Congress one week from today.
For more about Mrs. Black see
this column next Tuesday. Pete
McCloskey might beat her ex
cept for the fact that he's a
Farm grad and can't dance.

I take no credit for the accur
acy of these predictions, but all
are reliably based. My sources
are secret and will not be re
vealed unless I can retrieve
some of the money I had to pay
out to get them to talk in the
first place. FBI take note.
