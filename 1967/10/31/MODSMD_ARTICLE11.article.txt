# The
						Black Maze-Saddha
## Make Way For The Great White Knight 
### Theodore F. Spearman, Jr 
Again, aboard its mighty
"white" steed, America struts
off into distant lands in search
of dragons: black, brown, yel
low, and starving.
And it finds such a foe; small,
yellow, eats rice: good foe. Good
for policing up.
But, "policing up" in the lang
uage between white and color
means blowing up, burning up,
shooting up, in short, killing up.
Thus, we kill in the name of
democracy. Democracy aimed
not for America, where it is
needed, but for the country of
the people we are demoralizing
and burning and killing. We kill
people so that other people
might be free.
How Many Do We Kill?
So, I ask, how many people
do we kill, so that how many
other people are free? Will we
kill one-third of Vietnam's pop
ulation so that two-thirds are
free, or will we kill two-thirds
so that one-third is free?
It would probably be easy for
America to vitiate this would-be
problem with one clean swag
ger — "Yaaaa . . . one capitalist
is worth five commies any day."
Other people ask, when will
the war become economically un
sound? When will the war be
come politically destructive, or
if you're a Republican, construc
tive? These and many similar
questions plague the so-called
American dream.
Touching The Dream
Yet, regardless of these slight
blemishes, the dream/illusion
continues . . . continues to create
real hurt and real fear and real
death.

However, if possible, I would
like to attempt to touch this
dream, to capture it in some
way, to make it speak.
"The problem? Jungle! There's
a hell of a lot of it over here.
Hard on my boys. But I fixed
that. Darkies ... I got a lot of
them over here too. And I make
them do this jungle work.
They're 'good' at it. Everyone
knows where they come from
and I know there is a lot of
jungle over there. At night they
don't even need camouflage. At
some other time and in another
place, I'll explain why, propor
tionally, 50% more of them die
than my other boys.
Good Kill-Ratio
It's also a good war as far as
the kill ratio goes: ten of them
to one of us. In fact, I got some
boys who kill at a ratio of one
hundred to one. Read the last
issue of Time where this 100/1
technique is beautifully describ
ed and it only cost me 13 cents a
kill. What a bargain!
Of course, sometimes, my
boys get carried away with them
selves and do silly things; like
cutting off the ears of dead Cong
for trophies. But, I knew those
boys back home at Crothers Hall
would get a laugh out of it
when they saw it on T.V.
However, they stjill remain
somber when watching the com
mercials. Something must be
wrong. I can't continue to let
the best show on T.V. be spoiled
by commercials.
Unfair Tactics
But back to the war; I can't
understand why these Cong use
terrorist tactics. They should
fight just like I do, So what, if
they don't have planes, tanks,
helicopters, boats and army
clothes. It would still be a good
'little' fight for a while.
But they want to go and make

things difficult for me. Haven't
they heard that I'm the most
powerful nation in the world?
Though, I will say one thing
for those little fellows who come
down from the north, 'I respect
them! They are hard to kill.
They're not like those rice eat

ers from the south who go
around in black pajamas with
knives and homemade guns and
are easily killed."
Yes, I only respect the people
who are hard to kill.
Quietly, if in no other way, I
will say to you that I have suc

ceeded in one great area already.
I have taught the new genera
tion, this so-called "live" genera
tion, how to kill and be killed
for my whims. And they will
continue to kill and kill and . . .
If I could only use the bomb
. . . If I could only use . . . ?"
