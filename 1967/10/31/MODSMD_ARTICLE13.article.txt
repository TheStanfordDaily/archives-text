## Peace In The Middle East? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Commenting on the article en
titled "Appeal on Israel" by your
reporter Mark Weinberger in
Thursday's paper (October 26),
I would like to make the follow
ing points clear:
1) I was expecting an objec
tive view on the Arab-Israeli con
flict from University professors,
but unfortunately one can see
from your report that they are
looking at the problem super
ficially and from one side only
— that of Israel.
2) The act of creating Israel
itself in 1948 was an act of bel
ligerency. The Arabs lived in
Palestine for more than 1300
years. Moslems, Christians and
Jews lived peacefully side by
side in Palestine and other Arab
countries for generations. To
split Palestine into two parts
and allow Jews from all over
the world to come and settle in
the partitioned Palestine —
which is an Arab land — is tot
ally unfair and unjust.
3) Arabs are not against Jews
or the Jewish faith, but they
are against Zionism. Zionism is
a political movement directed
towards the Arabs and has many
expansionism goals in the Arab
land.
4) The Security Council has

condemned the Israeli aggres
sion several times since 1949.
5) Israel failed persistently to
obey and implement the Se
curity Council's resolutions since
1949 concerning the repatriation
and compensation of Arab refu
gees driven out from their home
land.
Until Israel knows how to be
have herself and puts the Se
curity Council's resolutions into
effect, and disdains from acts of
belligerency against the Arabs
there will be no peace in the
Middle East.

• Matching Violence
Editor, The Daily:
Last Friday night there was
an "incident" on University Ave
nue in East Palo Alto. I am
not sure what the exact circum
stances of the situation were
but they are not my concern
here; it is the manner in which
the police responded to the prob
lem that bothers me.
To combat the disturbance and
break up a group of about one
hundred people, most of whom
appeared to be just watching,
seven to ten poiice cars were
called into the area. Riot-helmet

f?d police stood around with
rifles drawn and several police
dogs readied for action; both
of these precautions were notice
ably absent during the "violent,
militant" protests in Oakland.
With no national press cover
age and facing a group that had
no spokesman, the police were
able to show their full strength
to "keep the peace" for another
evening. But by so flaunting
their power, they were only in
stilling more trouble into the
situation.
The riots this past summer
grew out of similar incidents,
and East Palo Alto residents may
one night match police violence
with their own.
