# The 						American South
## The 						More It Changes, The More It's The Same

STRONG, Ark. (CPS) — It is
a truism of journalism that it
is not possible to report events,
just the way people and events
react to a reporter watching
them. This is nowhere truer
than in the rural South.
To spend a week in Arkansas
and three days in this rural vil
lage near the Louisiana border
is not to be able to tell what
these places are like or how
their people think. It is only to
be able to write, with whatever
objectivity one can manage,
how their people react to a long
haired stranger who drives a
car with Mississippi plates and
speaks with a strange accent.
And what objectivity one can
manage is problematical. To
visit and talk with the people
of a small Southern town is an
experience which forces one to
suspend normal logics, to don
new thought processes.
The two policemen I encoun
tered both waved guns at me in
the course of ordinary conversa
tion, and it was not until I had
returned to the comparative
normality of Little Rock that I
noticed there was something
odd about the fact.
In the surrealistic ambience
of rural Arkansas it is not odd,
shocking or even frightening.
Until one returns to the outside
world it slips one's mind that
the purpose of an "equalizer" is
to shoot people.
Children Are Alike
Children of both races have
one characteristic they share
with all Americans, but carry
perhaps to extremes in the
South—the desire to always
give the response desired, in
word, deed, and expression.
A white 13-year-old will tell a
racist joke with a wide grin on
his face, then switch to decry
ing the attitudes of the people
he heard it from when he de
tects that one does not think it
funny.
A black 14-year-old will ex
plore the ridiculous in telling
how much progress is being
made, how good the white folks
are and how his fellow blacks
cannot be trusted without white
supervision.

Significantly, the white child
in question could adjust instant
ly to my disapproval, while it
did not penetrate to the black
one that I thought his pat ans
wers ludicruos though reveal
ing.
Two Conversations
With adult Afro-Americans
one has two conversations,
always. The first is the intro
ductory one in which one is as
sured of their good will, lack of
ambition, trust in the white
man, and confidence in the fu
ture. Rap Brown is equated with
the Klansman, and one is duly
thanked for having passed the
Civil Rights Act.
After a while one makes the
transition to a second conversa
tion. In one case this happened
as I was leaving after a point
less 20 minutes with the vice
principal of a black school. He
had assured me that as a guid
ance teacher he took no steps
to encourage integration, and
was not at all worried by the
inferiority of the equipment at
his school.
"Ah ain't seen every school in
Arkansas, but I guess we is as
good as any black school.
'Course the white schools is bet
ter everywhere, but that's just
the way things is."
As I got to the door, his tone
changed a little, from deferen
tial to plaintive: "Do you think
things will always be like this?
What is happening in Washing
ton? Will the Federal govern
ment ever do anything?"
I answered as truthfully as I
could, since I'm new to the U.S.
that I expect civil rights en
forcement to slow down because
of the coming election year, and
that I think the principle sup
porters of civil rights are a tiny
powerless minority; I confirmed
his world-view. Back to keeping
the kids from shouting in study
hall and running in the halls.
Often the second conversation
—it would be presumptuous to
call it the one that follows the
establishment of trust—is less
deferent, less based in the easy
assumption of the superiority
of any white man, even one
from a college newspaper ser
vice.

The man whose wife is a
cleaner at Arkansas Light and
Power: with a year of college
she gets $1.15 an hour for a
job at which white men are paid
$2.45.
The 16-year-old who failed at
the white school and returned
to the black one because he had
not been prepared for the alge
bra his grade was expected to
know.
The angry parent who ac
cuses the black teachers of sabo
taging integration because they
don't have the qualifications to
match the whites.
The youngster planning on
joining the service because he
knows that is the only place
he'll get mechanics papers.
These are all second selves,
symbols of the schizophrenia
racism, behind the smiles and
the well-lubricated traditions,
forces on the black.
For the white the correspond
ing mental set is paranoia. For
he knows his society is crum
bling, despite the radio pro
grams that tell him otherwise.
Yet there is enough decency
in his tradition to tell him that
the offerings of the liberal soci
ety that would supplant his own
are rotten and corrupt.
"We've never had a Detroit
in the South" is a ready answer
to all questions. And while it is
irrelevant, it is nevertheless
true—and evidence to the South
erner that the lawyers, agita
tors, and journalists who ques
tion him so impudently have
nothing to offer him as they
tear down his world.
Southern Grace Is Corrupted
The ancient grace of the
South is now corrupted. Hospi
tality is a shot of bourbon from
a bottle under the counter, and
erudition is the well-memorized
catalogue of Northern ills.
The ancient trusts, the busi
ness done with a handshake,
give way to the finance com
panies and the modern corporate
legalisms. Noblesse oblige has
lost the Churchillian ability to
recognize that the trade union
consists of real people with real
concerns.
The surface decency that was
possible when the niggers knew
their place crumbles when black
men ask for justice instead of
charity.
Despite this catalogue of de
cadence, the South is no worse
and is probably better in most
ways than the North—at least
to my eyes, in which progress
and efficiency are not the capital
virtues.
The Faulknerian fixation, the
love-hate relationship to the
South, infects many there. For
the poor the hatred of the land
that has given them so little
is combined with the clinging
love for what little they have.
Among the well-to-do one
hears passionate denunciations
of both the racism of the South
and the commercial moralities
of the North.
Living The Trials Of Job
The most thorough-going dis
section of the cult of the gun,
the willingness to prove man
hood through violence comes
from those who were raised in
the Zeitgeist they decry.
If most of the religion of the
South is based on ignorance and

Bible worship, it is nevertheless
possible to find people who still
follow the laws of the prophets.
The trials of Job are being
lived out by a man I met, the
town liberal of Strong, whose
sons have cerebral palsy and
multiple sclerosis; they live out
their blighted lives at home, a
trial but loved. In the North
they would be in asylums.
There is a peculiar attraction
for even the outsider to the
South. The conservatism, nay,
the ossification can seem at
times to promise something bet
ter than the worship of the
dynamic, the compulsive world
of permanent change.
The Spell Is Broken
But then the spell breaks. Sit
ting in a busy, successful, anti
septic Little Rock coffee shop
with acquaintances one night, I
and 30 others in the room heard
a 16-year-old raving like a man
insane.
"I seen lotsa niggers and they
all smell. Right?" Half a dozen
high schoolers with him nod

their admiration of his per
formance and he rambles on.
"Stamp out all psychedeeeelic
drugs. Right? Bomb all those
little yellow bastards. Right?"
By this time some of the cus
tomers are enjoying the looks
of amazement on our faces.
"Send all the hippies to Veeyet
nam. Right?" The rather mousy
waitress whispers to the profes
sor with me, "Yes, start throw
ing a few flowers around and
the war would soon be over."
But she doesn't really have any
conviction in her voice. She's
just trying to talk up our tip.
Eventually the kids leave to
be replaced by three boozy Bab
bitts with wives in cocktail
dresses—spreading another op
pressive cloud of shouting,
elbowing, alcoholic breath, and
racism.
These, despite their blue suits
and ties, are the characters
Fanon would recognize as col
onials, the administrators of the
far-flung empire of Manhattan:
lacking the grace, manners, and

ostensible liberalism that would
take them to the head offices
In the north, they stay as sales
men, errand runners, paper
shufflers, helping the dollar on
its route to the larger, richer
world.
As much as the unorgani7ed
working white or the semi-liter
ate black, the Southern bour
geois is a man denatured: short
sighted, demoralized, and uncul
tured because the information
content of his life is false.
His pretended independence is
made otiose by the direction of
his world by the Northern eco
nomics, the temper of the times,
the mysteries of progress eman
ating from elsewhere.
Empires are great fun to be
at the center of, but to accept
their mythology and be stuck
serving them in Little Rock is
as dehumanizing as working in
the Burmese police.
