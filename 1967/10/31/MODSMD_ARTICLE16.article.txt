# Church Stays Unfinished Until Needy Are Relieved

NEW YORK (AP) â€” The
Episcopal bishop of New York
announced Saturday that no
money will be spent to finish the
huge Cathedral of St. John the
Divine "until there is greater
evidence that the despair and
anguish of our unadvantaged
people has been relieved."
The cathedral stands in Morn
ingside Heights in upper Man
hattan, second in size only to
St. Peter's in Rome. Started in
1892, the first small chapel was
opened in 1896 and the struc
ture was two-thirds complete
when World War II halted work.
"The cathedral church will
for the immediate future remain
as it now stands, unfinished,"
said the bishop, the Rt. Rev.
Horace W. B. Donegan, 67.

"There will be no fund rais
ing for its completion so long
as I am bishop of New York,
until there is greater evidence
that the despair and anguish of
our unadvantaged people has
been relieved.
"From these Morningside
Heights," the bishop said at a
service in the cathedral, "we
look with concern upon the an
guish, the plight of the deprived,
and unadvantaged people who
live within a few blocks of us."
He said the unfinished cathe
dral is a symbol of our "rough
hewn, ragged, broken and incom
plete" society.
The cost of finishing the
church has been variously esti
mated at $12 million to $25 mil
lion.
