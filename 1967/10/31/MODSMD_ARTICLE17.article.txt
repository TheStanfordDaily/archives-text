# Since B.C.
## Student Protests Are Old Hat 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Student protests are nothing
new, says W. H. Cowley, profes
sor emeritus of education. Edu
cational and public activism has
been traditional since the found
ing of Plato's Academy in 387
B.C.
More violent than today's dem
onstrators, students in the fourth
century A.D. treated professors
holding unpopular political views
by throwing mud on them, start
ing fights in their lecture rooms
and dunking them in "any avail
able body of water."
"Riot and rebellion" also char
acterized the Middle Ages. A pro
test of the cost of wine in 1288
resulted in the death of several

students in Paris and caused the
University of Paris to desert the
city for three years.
"Unrest has also been a char
acteristic of American academia
since its earliest days," notes
Cowley. A committee of stu
dent "censors" and the advice of
Thomas Jefferson, James Mon
roe and James Madison failed
to pacify riotous University of
Virginia students.
Cowley emphasizes the "re
finement of American manners
in general and .. . the emergence
of intercollegiate athletics and
coeducation" as factors limiting
violence.
"Cerebral unrest," he asserts,
has come to the fore. Although

"today's students are In gen
eral infinitely more serious-mind
ed than their predecessors," cere
bral activism is not without prec
edent.
Scientific investigation, own
ership of books, debating and
writing papers characterized stu
dent organizations in the nine
teenth century. "Student educa
tional activism helped facilitate
the modernization of American
colleges," says Cowley.
Interest in public issues also
has a long history. "Nationalistic
convictions" flourished at colo
nial colleges during the Revolu
tion. Controversy for forty
years before the Civil War pro
voked debate and action on both
sides of the slavery issue. One
Oberlin College student died
in a Southern prison after work
ing on a flourishing underground
railway.
The invasion by outside or
ganizers of college campuses in
the early part of this century
revitalized the "mild form"
which student protest had taken
since the Civil War. The first in
truder, the Intercollegiate So
cialist Society, flourished until
World War I.
Apathy of the twenties yield
ed to "turmoil" in the thirties.
In 1936 half a million students
joined in a peace strike. Protest
ers also attacked "the under
privileged status of unions, child
labor, and in particular the sorry

state of Negro civil rights."
The return of degree- and job
seeking G.l.'s in the fifties result
ed in a "Silent Generation" on
the campus.
"Then in 1960 the lid blew off
again," says Cowley. He notes
the complexity of student pro
test today and its intrusion into
both academic and political
fields.
Cowley predicts five future
developments:
"First, student activism will
continue to be a fact to r.eckon
with.
"Second, visceral unrest will
on occasion emerge but, in the
United States at least, will sel
dom express itself violently.

"Third, student criticism of
educational practices will be in
creasingly recognized as a valu
able resource and will be faci
litated by better channels of fac
ulty-student communication.
"Fourth, during troublous
times student idealists will take
stands on public issues; and
their ameliorative ideas which
win popular support will be pro
ductive.
"Fifth, when these youthful
Utopians join the ranks of those
past thirty whom they now dis
dain, they — like so many of
their predecessors — will either
become important members of
progressive movements or pessi
mistic reactionaries."

Interest in public issues also
has a long history. "Nationalistic
convictions" flourished at colo
nial colleges during the Revolu
tion. Controversy for forty
years before the Civil War pro
voked debate and action on both
sides of the slavery issue. One
Oberlin College student died
in a Southern prison after work
ing on a flourishing underground
railway.
The invasion by outside or
ganizers of college campuses in
the early part of this century
revitalized the "mild form"
which student protest had taken
since the Civil War. The first in
truder, the Intercollegiate So
cialist Society, flourished until
World War I.
Apathy of the twenties yield
ed to "turmoil" in the thirties.
In 1936 half a million students
joined in a peace strike. Protest
ers also attacked "the under
privileged status of unions, child
labor, and in particular the sorry

state of Negro civil rights."
The return of degree- and job
seeking G.l.'s in the fifties result
ed in a "Silent Generation" on
the campus.
"Then in 1960 the lid blew off
again," says Cowley. He notes
the complexity of student pro
test today and its intrusion into
both academic and political
fields.
Cowley predicts five future
developments:
"First, student activism will
continue to be a fact to r.eckon
with.
"Second, visceral unrest will
on occasion emerge but, in the
United States at least, will sel
dom express itself violently.

"Third, student criticism of
educational practices will be in
creasingly recognized as a valu
able resource and will be faci
litated by better channels of fac
ulty-student communication.
"Fourth, during troublous
times student idealists will take
stands on public issues; and
their ameliorative ideas which
win popular support will be pro
ductive.
"Fifth, when these youthful
Utopians join the ranks of those
past thirty whom they now dis
dain, they — like so many of
their predecessors — will either
become important members of
progressive movements or pessi
mistic reactionaries."
Student protests are nothing
new, says W. H. Cowley, profes
sor emeritus of education. Edu
cational and public activism has
been traditional since the found
ing of Plato's Academy in 387
B.C.
More violent than today's dem
onstrators, students in the fourth
century A.D. treated professors
holding unpopular political views
by throwing mud on them, start
ing fights in their lecture rooms
and dunking them in "any avail
able body of water."
"Riot and rebellion" also char
acterized the Middle Ages. A pro
test of the cost of wine in 1288
resulted in the death of several

students in Paris and caused the
University of Paris to desert the
city for three years.
"Unrest has also been a char
acteristic of American academia
since its earliest days," notes
Cowley. A committee of stu
dent "censors" and the advice of
Thomas Jefferson, James Mon
roe and James Madison failed
to pacify riotous University of
Virginia students.
Cowley emphasizes the "re
finement of American manners
in general and .. . the emergence
of intercollegiate athletics and
coeducation" as factors limiting
violence.
"Cerebral unrest," he asserts,
has come to the fore. Although

"today's students are In gen
