## 
### 
BOULDER, Colo. (CPS) —
General Lewis B. Hershey, the
only director in the 27-year his
tory of the Selective Service
System, claims there aren't
likely to be reprisals by his
agency against those who par
ticipated in anti-war demonstra
tions during the past weeks.
"We don't want to make mar
tyrs of these people," he told
Frank Bell of the University of
Colorado Daily. In reference to
those who turned in or burned
their draft cards last week he
said: "We do anything we can
to keep the youngsters from be
ing tried."
But he added, the draft agency
furnishes any information
which it can to the Justice De
partment.
Action against members of
the Resistance who turned in
their draft cards—Hershey re
fers to them as "delinquents"—
will be determined by local draft
boards. However, two years ago
Hershey ordered anti-draft dem
onstrators at the University of
Michigan reclassified 1-A.
Hershey also had several crit
icisms of the demonstrators. He
said they are causing disunity
and have been caused by "a de
terioration of the family" and
too much "permissiveness."
He also doubted the effective
ness of demonstrations. Out of
34 million draft registrants "200
demonstrators here and 300
there does not make much dif
ference." He said that none of
the demonstrations have stop
ped inductees from joining the
army.

Demonstrators, said Hershey,
"are being put on by older folks.
There are people with prestige
with the kids that tend to com
mand attention with the emo
tionable and impressionable
kids.
"Heady wine, this wanting to
get your picture on the papers
and on radio and television."
