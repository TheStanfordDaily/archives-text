# Faculty Club Re-Evaluates Hirsute Hasher Prohibition
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
The alleged disbarment of se
nior Muni Barash from the Fac
ulty Club waiter staff has quick
ly led to policy re-evaluations by
several university and county
organizations. The major devel
opments are:
• The women waitresses at
the Faculty Club are reportedly
required to wear hairnets for
the first time while serving.
• The county sanitation de
partment reported that there are
neither state nor local ordinances
against hiring waiters with
beards.
• The University Food Ser
vice immediately instituted a
staff evaluation of its hiring
practices in reference to beards
and long hair.
Barash Supported
Barash revealed that com
ments to him have been "sup
portive" from both students and
faculty. He emphasized that Fac
ulty Club staff members are

implementing a policy that may
not be endorsed by the faculty.
"I feel that faculty opinion is
being misrepresented," he said.
"The faculty is less concerned
with protocol, while the staff is
bound by the bureaucratic sys
tem."
At the Faculty Club, a meeting
of the faculty committee on man
agement was preliminarily sche
duled for Thursday. According
to Mason Yearian of the physics
department, chairman of the
committee, the current Faculty
Club policy was "carried over
from the policy at Tresidder
when the club opened." Tresidder
bars bearded hashers.
Review State Codes First
He said that their decision
"will not be based upon esthe
tics. We will review state health
codes and then decide what our
policy is as a committee. We are
a somewhat new committee and
will have to review the informal
policy."

Bob Cushing of the sanitation
division of the County Health
Department disclosed that there
were no county or state laws
barring men with beards.
Cushing said that according
to Article 6, Section 28686 of the
California Restaurant Act re
quires women to wear hairnets,
caps, or headbands at all times
while handling food.
The applicable article in the
county code — Food Ordinance
499 — likewise covers only hair
nets for women.
Cushing emphasized that the
law is one of exclusion; if an
act is not specifically outlawed,
it may be considered legal.
William P. Myers, manager of
the University Food Service, con
tacted county health officials
after learning of the recent con
troversy. He expects a recom
mendation from them this morn
ing concerning bearded em
ployees.
