# Papooses Rally For Third Win, Defeat Trobabes 18-17
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
Rallying from a 17-0 halftime
deficit, the Stanford frosh foot
ball team made it three in a row
with an 18-17 win over the Tro
babes of Southern Cal.
Sparked by the second half
passing of quarterback Don
Bunce, the Terry DeSylvia-coach
ed frosh again demonstrated
their ability to come from be
hind.
Taught By The Varsity
As they did against the UCLA
frosh last week, the frosh ex
hibited a very poor model in the
first half, fumbling and losing
the ball four times.
These fumbles led directly to
two USC touchdowns and a field
goal, making the score 17-0 in
favor of the Trojans.
However, in the second half,
the offense exonerated itself
completely. Given excellent pro
tection by his backs and line,
Bunce engineered three touch
down drives through his passing.
Bunce Sparkles
In the third quarter, a thirty
five yard aerial from Bunce to
halfback Jack Schultz set up the
first score, with Bunce bootleg

ging for the TD from eight yards
out.
Early in the fourth quarter,
Bunce hit splitend Damea Wash
ington for 30 yards, and quickly
followed with a 12 yard scoring
toss to Jim Kaufman. The six
points narrowed the score to
17-12.
Minutes later, Kaufman and
Bunce collaborated again on a
spectacular pass play covering
35 yards. The completion set up
the winning score, as Schultz
banged in from the five a few
plays later. The TD sewed up
the 18-17 win.

Coach DeSylvia lauded his
quarterback Bunce and his three
receivers Kaufman, Washington,
and Paul Helms. Kaufman play
ed both offense and defense, as
a flanker and safety.
He praised 230 pounder Steve
Jubb, who also went both ways,
as an offensive center and a de
fensive tackle.
The stage is now set for the
Papooses' final game of the sea
son at Cal this Saturday. Both
the Bears and the Papooses will
put unbeaten records on the
line, in what should be a very
exciting finale for the frosh.

Bunce collaborated again on a
spectacular pass play covering
35 yards. The completion set up
the winning score, as Schultz
banged in from the five a few
plays later. The TD sewed up
the 18-17 win.

Coach DeSylvia lauded his
quarterback Bunce and his three
receivers Kaufman, Washington,
and Paul Helms. Kaufman play
ed both offense and defense, as
a flanker and safety.
He praised 230 pounder Steve
Jubb, who also went both ways,
as an offensive center and a de
fensive tackle.
The stage is now set for the
Papooses' final game of the sea
son at Cal this Saturday. Both
the Bears and the Papooses will
put unbeaten records on the
line, in what should be a very
exciting finale for the frosh.

QUARTERBACK IN THE MAKING: Stanford frosh quarterback Don Bnnce (10) fades to pass bo
hind a wall of Stanford blockers. Bunce scored onot TD, passed for another to guide the Papooses to
an 18-17 win over UCLA's frosh Saturday In Los Angeles.
Rallying from a 17-0 halftime
deficit, the Stanford frosh foot
ball team made it three in a row
with an 18-17 win over the Tro
babes of Southern Cal.
Sparked by the second half
passing of quarterback Don
Bunce, the Terry DeSylvia-coach
ed frosh again demonstrated
their ability to come from be
hind.
Taught By The Varsity
As they did against the UCLA
frosh last week, the frosh ex
hibited a very poor model in the
first half, fumbling and losing
the ball four times.
These fumbles led directly to
two USC touchdowns and a field
goal, making the score 17-0 in
favor of the Trojans.
However, in the second half,
the offense exonerated itself
completely. Given excellent pro
tection by his backs and line,
Bunce engineered three touch
down drives through his passing.
Bunce Sparkles
In the third quarter, a thirty
five yard aerial from Bunce to
halfback Jack Schultz set up the
first score, with Bunce bootleg

ging for the TD from eight yards
out.
Early in the fourth quarter,
Bunce hit splitend Damea Wash
ington for 30 yards, and quickly
followed with a 12 yard scoring
toss to Jim Kaufman. The six
points narrowed the score to
17-12.
Minutes later, Kaufman and
Bunce collaborated again on a
spectacular pass play covering
35 yards. The completion set up
the winning score, as Schultz
banged in from the five a few
plays later. The TD sewed up
the 18-17 win.
