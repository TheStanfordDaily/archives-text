## SDS Charges 'Opportunism' 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Brazilian opposition leader
Carlos Lacerda answered
charges last night of "right-wing
political opportunism."
Lacerda, speaking in Cubber
ley Auditorium, disregarded his
prepared text to answer directly
two mimeographed pages distri
buted before his speech by the
Students for a Democratic So
ciety (SDS).
Lacerda accused the SDS of
being Communist, of "demago
gary" and "making political hay
of the poverty of others."
Lacerda at the close of his
speech addressed himself to the
SDS and then said, "In fifty
years, Brazil has made more
progress in relative terms, than
Russia has made in its fifty
years of revolution."
Answers To SDS
Lacerda implied that the SDS
was supporting the Communist
Revolution in Russia.
During the course of his

speech, Lacerda answered point
by point the charges leveled at
him by the SDS mimeographed
pages. He stated that his sup
port of the military coup which
overthrew the legal Brazilian
government was justified.
"A poor country cannot af
ford disorder for a long timeâ€”
this is a luxury for rich coun
tries. This disorder means
hunger for the poor and profits
for the rich," he said. It was
this disorder which he wanted
to see prevented by the coup.
Lacerda defended himself
against the charge that he op
poses every democrat who gets
in power by saying that he only
urged extra legal means to over
throw men who were either not
democrats or men who did not
have the support of the Brazilian
people.
Half of Lacerda's speech was
devoted to a discussion in broad
terms of the political and econo
mic situation in Brazil.
He stated that he is not flat
ly against inflation at all times
and that ho would like to see
Brazil increase its currency out
put by about 20 r A yearly.
He also stated that neither
the economic theories of Adam
Smith nor those of Marx was ap
plicable in "undeveloped" coun
tries like Brazil. He called for
the application of a modified
form of Keynesian economic
theories, including deficit spend
ing, to Brazil.
He attacked U.S. aid to Brazil
as mostly limited to specific proj
ects, and not including enough
joint ventures.

Lacerda expressed his support
of the International Monetary
Fund's proposals for the
strengthening of the Brazilian
currency. These proposals are
being implemented by the cur
rent government.
Lacerda also told how the
army's power increased so that
it has taken over the govern
ment.
Lacerda says the army con
siders itself useless in an age of
nuclear wars and must find
something to do with its time.
As such it has supplied tech
nical support to Brazil's various
states, it finds that it ran also

apply these technical skills to
the management of the federal
government.
Lacerda opined that the army
does not yet have a "militaristic
mind" but is rapidly developing
one.
Lacerda is the former govern
or of Guanabara state. In offiee
he tried to improve the eco
nomic and educational opportuni
ties of those in his state.
He has opposed almost every
Brazilian president in the last
15 years. For such activities he
has been jailed nine times and
forced to leave the country
twice.
