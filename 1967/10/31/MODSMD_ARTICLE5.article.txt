# SES Committee Report
## Men-Women Ratio Change Advised 
### 
A committee of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
has proposed an end to the high
ratio of men to women among
undergraduates.
In a "Recommendation on the
Undergraduate Ratio" the SES
committee on admissions and fi
nancial aid cited housing space
as the administration's reason
for admitting over twice as
many men as women.
Calling this a "relatively mi
nor consideration," the brief
statement said tne ratio policy
should be changed because it
"discriminates against women"
in admissions.

The recommendation, signed
by Prof. William Clebsch, the
committee's chairman, was sub
mitted to the SES steering com
mittee yesterday. The steering
committee "noted receipt" of
the recommendation and
pointed out the SES residence
policy committee would be in
volved because the availability
of on-campus housing influences
the number of women admitted.
The ratio, about 2.3 to 1, went
down slightly this year because
more women transfer students
were admitt d. Space for them
was available because 60 senior
women took advantage of a new
regulation permitting them to
live off campus.
Stanford requires all other
undergraduate women to live in
dormitories until age 23.
The admissions and financial
aids committee is considering

many issues besides the ratio,
which is only indirectly related
to the group's area of study.
Most of the committee's work
since it was appointed in May
has concerned organization of
its inquiry and collection data.
Another recommendation it
submitted to the steering com
mittee yesterday ask d the fi
nancial aids office to preserve
on magnetic tape its yearly data
on financial aid applicants for
"long-range studies."
The steering committee voted
to pass the recommendation
along to the financial aids office,
with the stipulation that all fi
nancial aids records, including
such things as family income,
would remain strictly confiden
tial.
A major concern of the admis
sions committee will be study
ing a strong set of recommen

dations from the Humanities
and Sciences faculty last spring.
These proposals were also
drafted by a committee chaired
by Clebsch.
Last Change In 1958
The last major change in ad
missions procedure came in
1958. Commenting on this pol
icy, Clebsch says,"It was hon
estly made and is being pro
gressively administered, but
does the policy work 10 years
later?"
The committee will examine
all admissions at Stanford, both
undergraduate and graduate.
For this examination, it has
established seven subcommit
tees, each specializing in what
the committee believes to be a
crucial aspect of admissions.
These subcommittees are: re
cruiting, appraising and admit
ting, graduate admissions, spe

cial constituencies, preferential
admissions, financial aids, and
administrative structure.
The committee feels that the
present, system does not dis
tinguish between recruiting
those applicants who are "pre
selected" and those who are sim
ply interested. Pre-selected re
fers to students who have defin
itely decided to apply before a
Stanford recruiter enters the
scene.
Clebsch explained the special
constituences subcommittee will
work on plans concerning mi
nority groups and foreign stu
dents. The preferential admis
sions study will examine policy
for alumni children, athletes,
faculty and staff children, and
transfer students.
This subcommittee will devote
further study to changes in the

The ratio, about 2.3 to 1, went
down slightly this year because
more women transfer students
were admitt d. Space for them
was available because 60 senior
women took advantage of a new
regulation permitting them to
live off campus.

undergraduate women to live in

The admissions and financial

many issues besides the ratio,

Last Change In 1958
The last major change in ad

The committee will examine
all admissions at Stanford, both
undergraduate and graduate.
For this examination, it has
established seven subcommit
tees, each specializing in what
the committee believes to be a
crucial aspect of admissions.
These subcommittees are: re
cruiting, appraising and admit
ting, graduate admissions, spe

cial constituencies, preferential
admissions, financial aids, and
administrative structure.
The committee feels that the
present, system does not dis
tinguish between recruiting
those applicants who are "pre
selected" and those who are sim
ply interested. Pre-selected re
fers to students who have defin
itely decided to apply before a
Stanford recruiter enters the
scene.
Clebsch explained the special
constituences subcommittee will
work on plans concerning mi
nority groups and foreign stu
dents. The preferential admis

for alumni children, athletes,
faculty and staff children, and
