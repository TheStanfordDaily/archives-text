# On SES Position Paper
## Student Feedback Sought 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Students will soon tell the
University what they think of
sweeping reforms of undergrad
uate education proposed yester
day.
The Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) Steering Com
mittee plans to seek out student
reactions to its 5,000-word posi
tion paper "Toward a More Flex
ible Undergraduate Program."
Discussion questions will be
submitted to student living
groups — dormitories, fraterni
ties, eating clubs and row houses.
The committee hopes the stu
dents will reply with frank

criticism and suggestions on the
SES objectives.
In addition, ASSU President
Peter Lyman was invited yes
terday to organize a student ad
visory committee to examine
this position paper and subse
quent ones dealing with gradu
ate education and teaching.
SES seeks the student advi
sory committee as a "good
sounding board" for its propo
sals. according to Herbert Pack
er, vice-provost and chairman of
the Steering Committee.
"The student committee could
give a consensus opinion or ex
pression of a range of view
points," Packer said.
Packer suggested the commit
tee have a strong graduate and
off-campus undergraduate repre
sentation because these students
cannot be reached as easily as
on-campus undergraduates. Ex
cept for this recommendation,
the Steering Committee is leav
ing the "initiative" in selecting
the committee entirely to the
ASSU.

The Steering Committee's am
bitious plans to solicit opinion
directly from living groups will
be implemented after the ques
tions to be asked are drafted
at a Nov. 8 meeting. Copies of
the report, which appeared in
yesterday's Daily, will be sent
to each living group.
SES's determination to have
students actively participate in
the evaluation of the guidelines
was made clear in the last para
graph of the report:
"The approach outlined in this
paper would set the stage for a
considerable departure in under
graduate education. It is worth
pursuing only if it has the strong
endorsement of a substantial
majority of the community. It
is the hope of the Steering Com
mittee that these proposed guide
lines for undergraduate educa
tion will become the subject of
intensive discussion so that such
support, if merited, will have an
opportunity to evolve."
Besides stating objectives for

undergraduate education, the
paper advocated many measures
to loosen the rigid rules govern
ing an undergraduate's studies.
Western Civilization, mathema
tics, foreign language and sci
ence requirements are criticized.
Widespread new honors pro
grams and an Experimental Col
lege to test new curricula are
suggested.
The Steering Committee has
not made new arrangements for
a faculty evaluation of the posi
tion paper. Packer explained
"Plenty of ways already exist to
get us reactions from represen
tative faculty groups." Much of
this consists of direct communi
cation with departments, he said.
The Steering Committee will
study criticisms of the position
paper while working on specific
details to the paper's general
proposals. Afterwards it will
bring out a similar paper, now
being drafted, on graduate edu
cation and finally study the "fac
ulty and teaching function."

Peter Lyman was invited yes
terday to organize a student ad
visory committee to examine
this position paper and subse
quent ones dealing with gradu
ate education and teaching.
SES seeks the student advi
sory committee as a "good
sounding board" for its propo
sals. according to Herbert Pack
er, vice-provost and chairman of
the Steering Committee.
"The student committee could
give a consensus opinion or ex
pression of a range of view
points," Packer said.
Packer suggested the commit
tee have a strong graduate and
off-campus undergraduate repre
sentation because these students
cannot be reached as easily as
on-campus undergraduates. Ex
cept for this recommendation,
the Steering Committee is leav
ing the "initiative" in selecting
the committee entirely to the
ASSU.

The Steering Committee's am
bitious plans to solicit opinion
directly from living groups will
be implemented after the ques
tions to be asked are drafted
at a Nov. 8 meeting. Copies of
the report, which appeared in
yesterday's Daily, will be sent
to each living group.
SES's determination to have
students actively participate in
the evaluation of the guidelines
was made clear in the last para
graph of the report:
"The approach outlined in this
paper would set the stage for a
considerable departure in under
graduate education. It is worth
pursuing only if it has the strong
endorsement of a substantial
majority of the community. It
is the hope of the Steering Com
mittee that these proposed guide
lines for undergraduate educa
tion will become the subject of
intensive discussion so that such
support, if merited, will have an
opportunity to evolve."
Besides stating objectives for

undergraduate education, the
paper advocated many measures
to loosen the rigid rules govern
ing an undergraduate's studies.
Western Civilization, mathema
tics, foreign language and sci
ence requirements are criticized.
Widespread new honors pro
grams and an Experimental Col
lege to test new curricula are
suggested.
The Steering Committee has
not made new arrangements for
a faculty evaluation of the posi
tion paper. Packer explained
"Plenty of ways already exist to
get us reactions from represen
tative faculty groups." Much of
this consists of direct communi
cation with departments, he said.
The Steering Committee will
study criticisms of the position
paper while working on specific
details to the paper's general
proposals. Afterwards it will
bring out a similar paper, now
being drafted, on graduate edu
cation and finally study the "fac
ulty and teaching function."
Students will soon tell the
University what they think of
sweeping reforms of undergrad
uate education proposed yester
day.
The Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) Steering Com
mittee plans to seek out student
reactions to its 5,000-word posi
tion paper "Toward a More Flex
ible Undergraduate Program."
Discussion questions will be
submitted to student living
groups — dormitories, fraterni
ties, eating clubs and row houses.
The committee hopes the stu
dents will reply with frank

criticism and suggestions on the
SES objectives.
