# Cowell Health Center To Open Physical Therapy Department
## 
### CLAUDIA WILKEN 
Diatherapy, muscle - stimulat
ing sound waves, infra-red and
ultraviolet rays, and hydrother
apy â€” this will soon be
available to Stanford students.
These are some of the new
forms of treatment for bones,
muscles, and joints that will be
offered when the new physical
therapy center opens at the
Cowell student health center
Nov. 15.
"It is quite unique to have
this sort of a facility in a univer
sity health service," said Dr.
Jarr.es MeClenahan, Cowell's act
ing director. "We consider our
selves very fortunate."
Placed In Basement
A previously unfinished wing
of the basement of Cowell is be
ing converted, at a cost of eight
to ten thousand dollars, to house
the physical therapy center.
Equipment for the center, which
will cost $1,000, will include four
treatment tables in separate cub
icles, two whirlpool baths, and
a special exercise table with
graduated weights.
Presently the only physical
therapy equipment at Cowell is
one whirlpool bath, which is

"booked up all the time," accor
ding to McClenahan. Anyone
with an injury who can't be
treated by whirlpool bath must
be sent to the Palo Alto Clinic.
When the new center opens,
however, many different forms
of physical therapy will be avail
able. Both acute injuries, such
as sprained ankles and fractures,
and long-term or chronic prob
lems, such as rehabilitating a
leg or strengthening a muscle
after an injury or operation, will
be treated at the center. Ultra
violet light treatment for acne
will also be available.
Five Kinds Offered
Five main types of therapy
will be used at the center. Tem
perature therapy ranges from
ice treatment to infra-red and
ultraviolet rays. With sound
therapy, inaudible ultra-sonic
waves are used to stimulate
muscles. Hydrotherapy involves
the use of the whirlpool baths,
and diatherapy is a form of deep
heat that doesn't feel hot. Ex
ercise therapy means strength
ening muscles with weights and
similar equipment.
Although the new center will
be under the supervision of Mc-
Clenahan, Dr. Fred Behline;, a

team physician and orthopedic
surgeon, will directly oversee its
operation.
Orders for treatment will be
given by Behling, in consulta
tion with the registered, full-time
physical therapist to be working
at the center. The center will be
run on the same basis as Cowell,
open from nine to five, Monday
through Friday, and available
by appointment free of charge to
any registered student.
Supplements Athletics
The athletic department al
ready has physical therapy fa
cilities for varsity athletes. The
idea for the new center origi
nated when the athletic depart
ment and the Cowell center
agreed that more physical ther
apy services should be available
to non-varsity athletes.
"The idea expanded from
there," said McClenahan, and it
was decided "to combine facili
ties for non-varsity athletes and
other University students, in
cluding those not even interested
in athletics."
Roger Cairns, architect from
the planning office, helped ath
letic department trainers and
Cowell doctors to plan the new
physical therapy center.
