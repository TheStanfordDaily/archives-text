Demands that the CIA be prohibited from re
cruiting on campus Wednesday and Thursday
seem misdirected. Rather than taking a stand
for freedom and society, the Students for a Dem
ocratic Society would introduce a new form of
the same totalitarianism they fear.
Our belief is not that the CIA represents the
finest tradition of governmental power. CIA
meddling in student groups and universities
can in many cases be documented and rightfully
attacked. To state that their covert activities on
campus should be eliminated is one thing, but
to demand that CIA recruiting should not be
allowed is another.
SDS has chosen the wrong issue. Everyone
should have the right to be present on campus,
express their beliefs, and solicit members or
employees. The demands of an absoluely free
speech require this for the university campus.
If the SDS were allowed to dictate that the
CIA should not be allowed on campus, why
couldn't someone demand that any other group
be prohibited from speaking or recruiting on
campus? Such a situation would be more totali
tarian than our present situation.
If a University consensus were drawn that the
CIA was not a worthwhile career choice because

of its anti-social character, then possibly the
University might prohibit the CIA from recruit
ing, but that would only make the university an
ideological island, and academic freedom would
have been weakened.
Only when the presence of a group on campus
constitutes a "clear and present danger" to the
university should it be outlawed. The SDS is
going to have a hard time proving this, for the
CIA is an arm of the U.S. Government and not
a separate organization.
And furthermore, there are possibly as many
people on campus who would claim that the SDS
represents a "clear and present danger" as would
claim that the CIA does. What do we do then,
whom do we ban? And who decides who is
banned?
If the SDS wants to protest the activities of
the CIA, let it do this through picketing and in
formative noon rallies, not through ill-conceived
demands that the CIA be denied the right to
recruit on campus.
SDS plans for a sit-in can only backfire. To
talitarian methods employed by the SDS will
distract most members of the University com
munity from real arguments against the CIA.
