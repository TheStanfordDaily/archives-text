# Sit-In At Encina Planned To Protest Against CIA
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Students for a Democratic So
ciety and the Resistance have
pooled their efforts to sponsor a
"massive sit-in to protest and
prevent" the Central Intelligence
Agency from recruiting on cam
pus today.
About 25 persons indicated at
a noon rally in White Plaza
yesterday they would sit in this
morning at Encina Hall, where
the CIA is scheduled to hold re
cruiting interviews beginning at
9 a.m.
A University spokesman said
the west entrance would be
blocked and only students hav
ing interview appointments
would be allowed to enter.
At yesterday's rally, English
Professor Bruce Franklin coun
tered the argument that the
ClA's right of free speech justi
fied campus recruiting.
"There is a difference between
free speech and the activities of
this organization," he said. "Free
speech does not consist of skulk
ing around the campus trying to
recruit spies and murderers."
Confidential Files
Franklin also charged the CIA
has access to students' confiden
tial flies through the Placement
Office, but Provost Richard Ly
man in an interview later yes
terday emphatically denied it.
"There is a distinction between
the kind of dossier the Place

ment Service keeps and a stu
dent's confidential records," Ly
man said. He added the place
ment folder contains only "what
the student wants to tell a pros
pective employer."
According to Placement Ser
vice Director Ralph Keller, that
information includes a student's
name, address, job objective,
educational record, job experi
ence, organizations he belongs
to (if he wishes to name them),
distinctions, merit awards and
whatever else he thinks might
be persuasive to an employer.
The folder also contains let
ters of reference, which are the
only items students are not al
lowed to see, but which are writ
ten by persons of their own
choice. The rest of the informa
tion is placed in the folder by
each student.
No company or government
agency is allowed to see this
file without the student's per
mission or a subpoena. In case
any of a student's records are
subpoenaed, according to Ly
man, the student is notified im
mediately and has a chance to
challenge the subpoena in court.
Lyman said, "The old 'big lie'
technique is very hard to keep
up with. ... I think this is a
calculated effort to confuse the
issue and to frighten people with
bogeys that don't exist here."
Also at yesterday's rally,
Steve Weissman former leader

of the Berkeley Free Speech
Movement, said, "We're not talk
ing about free speech. It's not
a matter of discussion, conver
sation or debate that can change
this society. It's force."
Free Speech?
Jack Gerson of SDS replied to
Lyman's defense of the ClA's
right to recruit on campus on
grounds of free speech.
In a letter to Lyman, Gerson
asserted, "It is particularly ludi
crous to invoke free speech in
connection with the CIA. ... Its
agents smother free thought,
subvert and overthrow legal gov
ernments, and generally act as
a repressive force throughout
the world."
Victor Lovell, head of the Mid
peninsula Free University
(MPFU), charged, at the rally,
that the University itself was
denying free speech to MPFU.
Lovell read a letter sent from
Dean of Students Joel Smith to
MPFU in August. The letter said
MPFU did not meet the Univer
sity's requirements for permis
sion to sign up members on cam
pus.
"In other words," said Lovell,
"it's all right . . . for the CIA to
come to this campus to recruit
but it's not all right for the Mid
peninsula Free University to
come on to this campus and reg
ister members."
