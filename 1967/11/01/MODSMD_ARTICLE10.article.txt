# Monkey On My Back
## University And Dilemma Of Dissent 
### Mike Couzens 
One rather tires of being told
that, by allowing this-or-that to
occur on campus, the Univer
sity is sanctioning and support
ing the activity in question.
To approve of ROTC is to ap
prove of the war in Vietnam. To
approve of CIA recruiting is to
approve of that authority's in
terest in national student fronts
or in germ warfare.
By this line of reasoning, the
obscenities bawled from the bal
cony at the Sunday Flicks are
statements of official University
policy. The utterances are pub
lic, made on university property,
and no one from the Dean of
Student's Office has raised a
hand against them.
This is a damaging sort of rub
bish, for it strangles debate on
the vital issues it purports to
resolve.
I am disturbed by the legiti
macy of ROTC on the campus. I
am disturbed by the presence of
a demagogue (I can only think
of one) on the Hoover Institu
tion staff. I am disturbed by the
moral and human costs of the
draft.
Chaos To Follow?
But I want to have a reason
before I ask that certain activi
ties be banished from the Uni
versity. And I want to start with
the painful assumption that a
reason may or may not be forth
coming. If not, I must expect to
banish these things at the cost
of a university irremedially
torn. The institution which suc
ceeds that university will be
either chaotic or authoritarian,
and I would demand to hear the
case for either one.
There are two defensible posi
tions with regard to political ad
vocacy on the campus. One is to
prohibit it entirely. This involves
no discrimination; all organiza
tions with political intent are
cast out. While the argument
for this has some force, it has
two compelling disadvantages.
First, it walls in the ivory
tower, and helps to innoculate
the community against informa
tion about what is going on. Sec
ond, Stanford has already taken
the step of opening itself to po
litical advocacy, and this step is
probably irreversible.
Let Them Come
The other tenable position is
to allow advocacy of everything
under the sun. If the Black Mus
lims come to sell newspapers,
let them sell. If the CIA, the
Peace Corps, or a law firm wish
es to recruit, let it recruit. If Mr.
Brown wants to make state
ments which may lay him open
to imprisonment, let him speak.
No Black Muslim, no spy, no
professor can claim to represent
the University.
Somewhere between these two
positions would be, inevitably, an
administrator deciding for one
activity and against another. I
doubt that the wisest of our ad
ministrators is wise enough to
do that. And I doubt that any
such decision can be made with
out bitter and well-justified cri
ticism.
These arguments have a fami
liar history over the past two
years. It is frustrating to see
how little has been learned from
all the controversy.
Take It Or Leave It
A group of students sat in at
the President's Office two years
ago to oppose thv- administration
on campus of the notorious and
now-defunct draft test. It was
one option, "take it or leave it,"
which the University had pre
sented.
A letter to The Daily pointed
out that many of the sitters-in
favored the distribution of con
traceptives by the Student
Health Center. One option. Take
it or leave it.
The test, they said, sanctioned
the draft. The pill, they said,
did not sanction promiscuity. In
the end, their cause was made

to look ridiculous. The test was
carried out. They sat-in. Then
their argument shifted away
from the draft test to what was
wrong with the University ad
ministration which allowed it to
happen.
Recent argument on ROTC
has raised the issue once again.
A column in The Daily advanced
the view that to allow ROTC
was to support the war. Letter
to-the-editor writers bent a tire
less effort to attacking this un
tenable view. There debate end
ed.
Good arguments, too, are to
be mounted against ROTC. It
probably does not meet the aca
demic standards of the Univer
sity. Its staff probably should
not be members of the Academic
Council.
If so, ROTC should be allowed
to register with the Dean of
Students as a proper student or
ganization. Its courses should
count toward activity — but not
academic — credit.
Money Rubrics
The actual situation is com
plicated by money matters. The
University has a contract with
ROTC for facilities. To this
might be applied the rubric that
Stanford will only accept money
which does not distort the pur
poses of an independent univer
sity. The foremost of these are
maintenance of the highest pos
sible academic standards and a
spirit of free inquiry.
This is already operative to
some extent. It has been the
basis for turning down some
seductive grants from the Winds
of Freedom Foundation. It has
also imposed limits upon classi
fied research.
But it is here that the Univer
sity, and not the students, may
be exposed as inconsistent.
ROTC probably fails both the
tests: academic standards and
free inquiry. Until it can meet
them, it belongs with the volun
tary organizations. The contract
with the Government should
thus be cancelled.
Government Scholarships
This is, incidentally, nothing
against ROTC scholarships. Oth
er donors are allowed to ear
mark scholarships for, say, a stu
dent majoring in Chemical Engi
neering. Fair enough, then, for
the Government to pay a stu
dent to enroll in this particular
voluntary organization.
Should ROTC wish to use cam
pus facilities, its claim deserves
equal weight with MPFU's.

Should it at some future time
put forward a course it believes
to merit academic credit, it de
serves an equal hearing with
MPFU. The only special treat
ment it deserves is that ROTC
should probably suffice to waive
the P.E. requirement. So should
a handball league, if anyone
cares to start one.
We now come to the most cur
rent spectre in a long proces
sional. Should CIA recruiters
be allowed on campus?
The University has seen as one
of its purposes the placement of
its graduates in the sort of em
ployment for which they might
be qualified. This has led, in
some cases, to a healthy regula
tion of recruitment practices.
For example, the Law School
no longer allows a firm to speci
fy that it wants to interview
only those individuals in the top
third of a graduating class. It
insists that interviews be grant
ed to all those interested, on the
reasonable assumption that all
are qualified.
A Phony Enemy
The University should not be
put in the position of deciding
who may come to interview, who
may not. As we said before, it
is not wise enough to do that.
Protest should not be lodged
against the phony enemy, Stan
ford; but against what some peo
ple see as the real enemy, the
CIA. It is reasonable to expect
every applicant, again, to pass
through a peaceful picket line,
to be exposed to literature and
argument against this option.
When people say that an op
tion should be denied, and espe
cially when they try physically
to prevent its exercise, what they
are actually saying is that they
want to decide for themselves
which options are banned — for
everyone.
I very often agree with their
choices. But I am convinced that
if a choice were to be made, if
a mechanism were to be set up,
they would not be the ones do
ing the choosing. Far more like
ly would be a choice by people
of Governor Reagan's ilk — war
time restraints for wartime con
ditions — or of the late Sen. Mc-
Carthy's. Can we expect, from
such tribunals, a better shake
for the CIA or for ihe Students
for a Democratic Society?
Minority Cause
The argument would be differ
ent if those who want to prohibit
certain functions were in a ma
jority. They could then make a

case — albeit a shaky one — for
imposing their view on everyone
else. But so long as their politi
cal view is a minority one, the
cause is hopeless.
Something needs to be said,
finally, about raw in-situation
tactics. If peaceful protest will
not work, are the chances for
success improved by imposing
a view by force? The physical
odds do not look good. Militants
are poised against the force of
a legal tradition, the police,
finally, the army. The public re
lations odds look quite as bad,
if anyone still cares. Blocked
doorways and thrown stones do
not create a majority.
Impotent Repository
The argument goes that force
is necessary if peaceful means
have failed. This only has weight
if force improves the chances of
success. The contrary is prob
ably the case. To resort to these
tactics out of a desire to be doing
something, or to prove oneself,
is a personal and selfish act
which impairs a greater cause
in the public forum.
A single value has been de

fended throughout this analy
sis. It is the university as a
place for free and open inquiry,
for dissent. It may be that this
has ceased to have meaning, and
that the university today may
be an impotent repository for
lost causes. But before I fore
sake the university, I want to
know what is to arise to take
its place. No authoritarian
scheme will do.
The university is a place where
people may walk out on the Vice-
President of the United States.
If their conviction exceeds their
propriety, they may even yell,
"Shame!" But if too many peo
ple start to throw mud, their
cause, and the university's, will
be lost.
This is, indeed, a position of
anguish, outrage, and impotence.
Perhaps it means that the causes
which really matter are lost for
all time. But I believe that it will
have to do, pending the accrual
of strength for a revolution
which may be coming, which
may be welcome. For the mo
ment, it is an ill wind of freedom
that blows nobody good.
