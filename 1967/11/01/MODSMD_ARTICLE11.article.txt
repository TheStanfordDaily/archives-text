## Vigo: Experimental, Unobtrusive 
### DAVID PROCHASKA 
To that rare species, that dedicated follower of film, the cineaste,
Jean Vigo is a prophetic hero. Unfortunately, few other people have
ever heard of him.
It's not hard to understand why. It is as though the facts of
Vigo's life and films have conspired to perpetuate his obscurity. At
the same time, those who know about Vigo have lionized him and
idolized him to the point where he currently enjoys an underground
reputation only loosely based on fact.
The International Film Forum showed Vigo's "Zero for Conduct'
last Thursday and will show "L'Atalante" tomorrow at 8:15 at
Tresidder.
A Rebel In Film
Vigo's father was a rebel, an anarchist executed during Clemen
ceau's regime. Son Jean was a rebel too — not only against the
established order of things like his father, but also against the estab
lished way of how to make a film. It has been said with some truth
that he wielded the camera as a weapon, not as an anesthetic.
Unfortunately for us and fortunately for mythmakers, Vigo didn't
live long enough to do what he wanted to. He died worn out at the
age of 29 of tuberculosis. He was able to complete only two feature
length films. "Zero de Conduite" (Zero for Conduct, 1933) and
"L'Atalante" (1934) were done in the last two years of his life.
"Zero for Conduct", an attack on everything the French school
system stood for, was promptly banned by the censor and not
cleared for release for twenty years, until 1954. "L'Atalante" has
only been shown sporadically.
A Prophet And A Hero
The Vigo legend came of age with the nouvelle vague, which
hailed him as a prophet and hero. Resnais and Truffaut, among
others, have praised him publicly in print. The similarities between
"Zero for Conduct" and"The 400 Blows", Truffant's first feature,
have been noted by critics, friendly and otherwise.
Thus, it was with considerable expectation and even more appre
hension that I first journeyed to see Vigo's films. Fortunately, the
legend is true. Jean Vigo has got to be one of the few authentic
geniuses in the history of the cinema.
Students vs. Teachers
"Zero for Conduct" is set in a French school. It loosely chronicles
school life from the boys' return from vacation, through their antics
in class and in the dormitory, their annihilation of a Parents' Day,
and culminates with their revolt. From beginning to end, it is stu

dents versus teachers and Vigo's sympathy lies wholeheartedly
with the students.
"Zero for Conduct" is no dry social documentary. Vigo's school
is run by a veritable gallery of grotesques. The headmaster is a
bungling buffoon whom the students deceive with ease. The princi
pal is a four foot midget constantly attired in tails and a huge top
hat, who can barely see over the top of his desk. They wage a
futile holding action against their heathen charges. Together, they
mete out punishment only vaguely proportionate to the offense.
Vigo's technique is already fully developed. In the very first
scene, he demonstrates his genius for conceiving and executing
a scene in purely cinematic terms. One boy joins another on a train
returning them to school. He proceeds to pull balloons out of his
pocket which they blow up. Then out comes a small flute, then
goose quills, then a spiral with a ball in it, and finally, huge long
cigars which they puff contentedly. The scene is at least two or
three minutes long yet not one word is spoken.
The Pillow Fight
Vigo doesn't tell a story so much as present the audience with
a series of related sketches. These statements are the steps in his
argument and lead to his conclusion, the climax. The conclusion of
"Zero for Conduct" is rebellion in the form of a pillow fight.
The place is the boys' dormitory, the time is night, and the boys
are restless. Three student leaders approach the headmaster who
sleeps in the dorm with them and silently tie him to his bed.
Elated, the boys begin a furious pillow fight by candlelight. In a
triumphant procession done in slow motion, the boys parade the
length of the room with the still sleeping headmaster and his bed
tilted vertically amid flickering candles and feathery down.
Melodrama Made Convincing
"L'Atalante" is more ambitious and even more successful. It is
the melodramatic tale of Jean and Juliette who begin their married
life on the barge, L'Atalante. Handyman Pere Jules helps on the
barge when not occupied with his cats or accordion. Juliette, un
able to accept the constrictions of life on board a barge, yields to the
temptations of Paris and deserts Jean. Pere Jules, being the handy
man he is, finds Juliette and reunites her with Jean.
By infusing the entire film with a visual poetry all his own,
Vigo's tale becomes convincing, if not transcending melodrama al
together.
In shot after shot, Vigo's genius of conveying a sense of atmo
sphere and milieu is apparent. In one breathtakingly beautiful
shot, we watch the coal-black L'Atalante glide down a canal at night
with Juliette on deck dressed in white. In other circumstances, this
obviously "pretty" picture would have failed, but it works here
because it effectively contributes to the organic unity of the film.

Vigo was ably assisted by Michael Simon, who gives one of the
screen's classic characterizations as Pere Jules. In his longest
scene, Pere Jules permits Juliette in his cabin to show her his
most prized possessions collected on his voyages. The cabin is a
packrat's dream. Jules must have something from every port he's
ever visited and a remembrance of everyone he's ever known. His
personal favorite is the hands of a dead friend preserved in a jar
of alcohol.
Experiments In Technique
Although "L'Atalante' is a conventional tale, Vigo's technique
is again unconventional. Once again he presents a series of sketches
rather than an elaborately spun out tale. Yet "L'Atalante" is such
an individual and personal creation that only rarely are thest
sketches cliche-ridden. The opening scene follows Jean and Juliette
from the wedding chapel to the barge and their departure. Yet we
never see the church or any of the ceremony. Wo know Jean and
Juliette have just been married because of their wedding clothes.
But instead of telling us what we already know, Vigo dwells on the
comments and expressions of the wedding party.
Vigo's technique while experimental is never obtrusive. It is com
pletely right for the occasion. Alone in Paris, a man tries to rob
Juliette. She struggles, a crowd gathers, and the thief flees. This
emotionally jarring scene is accentuated by Vigo's shooting part of
it from behind a picket fence, thus achieving a stroboscopic-like
effect.
To that rare species, that dedicated follower of film, the cineaste,
Jean Vigo is a prophetic hero. Unfortunately, few other people have
ever heard of him.
It's not hard to understand why. It is as though the facts of

from the wedding chapel to the barge and their departure. Yet we
never see the church or any of the ceremony. Wo know Jean and
Juliette have just been married because of their wedding clothes.
But instead of telling us what we already know, Vigo dwells on the
comments and expressions of the wedding party.
Vigo's technique while experimental is never obtrusive. It is com
pletely right for the occasion. Alone in Paris, a man tries to rob
Juliette. She struggles, a crowd gathers, and the thief flees. This
emotionally jarring scene is accentuated by Vigo's shooting part of
it from behind a picket fence, thus achieving a stroboscopic-like
effect.
To that rare species, that dedicated follower of film, the cineaste,
Jean Vigo is a prophetic hero. Unfortunately, few other people have
ever heard of him.
It's not hard to understand why. It is as though the facts of
Vigo's life and films have conspired to perpetuate his obscurity. At
the same time, those who know about Vigo have lionized him and
idolized him to the point where he currently enjoys an underground
reputation only loosely based on fact.
The International Film Forum showed Vigo's "Zero for Conduct'
last Thursday and will show "L'Atalante" tomorrow at 8:15 at
Tresidder.
A Rebel In Film
Vigo's father was a rebel, an anarchist executed during Clemen
ceau's regime. Son Jean was a rebel too — not only against the
established order of things like his father, but also against the estab
lished way of how to make a film. It has been said with some truth
that he wielded the camera as a weapon, not as an anesthetic.
Unfortunately for us and fortunately for mythmakers, Vigo didn't
live long enough to do what he wanted to. He died worn out at the
age of 29 of tuberculosis. He was able to complete only two feature
length films. "Zero de Conduite" (Zero for Conduct, 1933) and
"L'Atalante" (1934) were done in the last two years of his life.
"Zero for Conduct", an attack on everything the French school
system stood for, was promptly banned by the censor and not
cleared for release for twenty years, until 1954. "L'Atalante" has
only been shown sporadically.
A Prophet And A Hero
The Vigo legend came of age with the nouvelle vague, which
hailed him as a prophet and hero. Resnais and Truffaut, among
others, have praised him publicly in print. The similarities between
"Zero for Conduct" and"The 400 Blows", Truffant's first feature,
have been noted by critics, friendly and otherwise.
Thus, it was with considerable expectation and even more appre
hension that I first journeyed to see Vigo's films. Fortunately, the
legend is true. Jean Vigo has got to be one of the few authentic
geniuses in the history of the cinema.
Students vs. Teachers
"Zero for Conduct" is set in a French school. It loosely chronicles
school life from the boys' return from vacation, through their antics
in class and in the dormitory, their annihilation of a Parents' Day,
and culminates with their revolt. From beginning to end, it is stu

dents versus teachers and Vigo's sympathy lies wholeheartedly
with the students.
"Zero for Conduct" is no dry social documentary. Vigo's school
is run by a veritable gallery of grotesques. The headmaster is a
bungling buffoon whom the students deceive with ease. The princi
pal is a four foot midget constantly attired in tails and a huge top
hat, who can barely see over the top of his desk. They wage a
futile holding action against their heathen charges. Together, they
mete out punishment only vaguely proportionate to the offense.
Vigo's technique is already fully developed. In the very first
scene, he demonstrates his genius for conceiving and executing
a scene in purely cinematic terms. One boy joins another on a train
returning them to school. He proceeds to pull balloons out of his
pocket which they blow up. Then out comes a small flute, then
goose quills, then a spiral with a ball in it, and finally, huge long
cigars which they puff contentedly. The scene is at least two or
three minutes long yet not one word is spoken.
The Pillow Fight
Vigo doesn't tell a story so much as present the audience with
a series of related sketches. These statements are the steps in his
argument and lead to his conclusion, the climax. The conclusion of
"Zero for Conduct" is rebellion in the form of a pillow fight.
The place is the boys' dormitory, the time is night, and the boys
are restless. Three student leaders approach the headmaster who
sleeps in the dorm with them and silently tie him to his bed.
Elated, the boys begin a furious pillow fight by candlelight. In a
triumphant procession done in slow motion, the boys parade the
length of the room with the still sleeping headmaster and his bed
tilted vertically amid flickering candles and feathery down.
Melodrama Made Convincing
"L'Atalante" is more ambitious and even more successful. It is
the melodramatic tale of Jean and Juliette who begin their married
life on the barge, L'Atalante. Handyman Pere Jules helps on the
barge when not occupied with his cats or accordion. Juliette, un
able to accept the constrictions of life on board a barge, yields to the
temptations of Paris and deserts Jean. Pere Jules, being the handy
man he is, finds Juliette and reunites her with Jean.
By infusing the entire film with a visual poetry all his own,
Vigo's tale becomes convincing, if not transcending melodrama al
together.
In shot after shot, Vigo's genius of conveying a sense of atmo
sphere and milieu is apparent. In one breathtakingly beautiful
shot, we watch the coal-black L'Atalante glide down a canal at night
with Juliette on deck dressed in white. In other circumstances, this
obviously "pretty" picture would have failed, but it works here
because it effectively contributes to the organic unity of the film.

Vigo was ably assisted by Michael Simon, who gives one of the
screen's classic characterizations as Pere Jules. In his longest
scene, Pere Jules permits Juliette in his cabin to show her his
most prized possessions collected on his voyages. The cabin is a
packrat's dream. Jules must have something from every port he's
ever visited and a remembrance of everyone he's ever known. His
personal favorite is the hands of a dead friend preserved in a jar
of alcohol.
Experiments In Technique
Although "L'Atalante' is a conventional tale, Vigo's technique
is again unconventional. Once again he presents a series of sketches
rather than an elaborately spun out tale. Yet "L'Atalante" is such
an individual and personal creation that only rarely are thest
sketches cliche-ridden. The opening scene follows Jean and Juliette
from the wedding chapel to the barge and their departure. Yet we
never see the church or any of the ceremony. Wo know Jean and

most prized possessions collected on his voyages. The cabin is a
packrat's dream. Jules must have something from every port he's
ever visited and a remembrance of everyone he's ever known. His
personal favorite is the hands of a dead friend preserved in a jar
of alcohol.
Experiments In Technique
Although "L'Atalante' is a conventional tale, Vigo's technique
is again unconventional. Once again he presents a series of sketches
rather than an elaborately spun out tale. Yet "L'Atalante" is such
an individual and personal creation that only rarely are thest
sketches cliche-ridden. The opening scene follows Jean and Juliette
from the wedding chapel to the barge and their departure. Yet we
never see the church or any of the ceremony. Wo know Jean and
Juliette have just been married because of their wedding clothes.
But instead of telling us what we already know, Vigo dwells on the
comments and expressions of the wedding party.
Vigo's technique while experimental is never obtrusive. It is com
pletely right for the occasion. Alone in Paris, a man tries to rob
Juliette. She struggles, a crowd gathers, and the thief flees. This
emotionally jarring scene is accentuated by Vigo's shooting part of
it from behind a picket fence, thus achieving a stroboscopic-like
effect.
To that rare species, that dedicated follower of film, the cineaste,
Jean Vigo is a prophetic hero. Unfortunately, few other people have
ever heard of him.
It's not hard to understand why. It is as though the facts of
Vigo's life and films have conspired to perpetuate his obscurity. At
the same time, those who know about Vigo have lionized him and
idolized him to the point where he currently enjoys an underground
reputation only loosely based on fact.
The International Film Forum showed Vigo's "Zero for Conduct'
last Thursday and will show "L'Atalante" tomorrow at 8:15 at
Tresidder.
A Rebel In Film
Vigo's father was a rebel, an anarchist executed during Clemen
ceau's regime. Son Jean was a rebel too — not only against the
established order of things like his father, but also against the estab
lished way of how to make a film. It has been said with some truth
that he wielded the camera as a weapon, not as an anesthetic.
Unfortunately for us and fortunately for mythmakers, Vigo didn't
live long enough to do what he wanted to. He died worn out at the
age of 29 of tuberculosis. He was able to complete only two feature
length films. "Zero de Conduite" (Zero for Conduct, 1933) and
"L'Atalante" (1934) were done in the last two years of his life.
"Zero for Conduct", an attack on everything the French school
system stood for, was promptly banned by the censor and not
cleared for release for twenty years, until 1954. "L'Atalante" has
only been shown sporadically.
A Prophet And A Hero
The Vigo legend came of age with the nouvelle vague, which
hailed him as a prophet and hero. Resnais and Truffaut, among
others, have praised him publicly in print. The similarities between
"Zero for Conduct" and"The 400 Blows", Truffant's first feature,
have been noted by critics, friendly and otherwise.
Thus, it was with considerable expectation and even more appre
hension that I first journeyed to see Vigo's films. Fortunately, the
legend is true. Jean Vigo has got to be one of the few authentic
geniuses in the history of the cinema.
Students vs. Teachers
"Zero for Conduct" is set in a French school. It loosely chronicles
school life from the boys' return from vacation, through their antics
in class and in the dormitory, their annihilation of a Parents' Day,
and culminates with their revolt. From beginning to end, it is stu

dents versus teachers and Vigo's sympathy lies wholeheartedly
with the students.
"Zero for Conduct" is no dry social documentary. Vigo's school
is run by a veritable gallery of grotesques. The headmaster is a
bungling buffoon whom the students deceive with ease. The princi
pal is a four foot midget constantly attired in tails and a huge top
hat, who can barely see over the top of his desk. They wage a
futile holding action against their heathen charges. Together, they
mete out punishment only vaguely proportionate to the offense.
Vigo's technique is already fully developed. In the very first
scene, he demonstrates his genius for conceiving and executing
a scene in purely cinematic terms. One boy joins another on a train
returning them to school. He proceeds to pull balloons out of his
pocket which they blow up. Then out comes a small flute, then
goose quills, then a spiral with a ball in it, and finally, huge long
cigars which they puff contentedly. The scene is at least two or
three minutes long yet not one word is spoken.
The Pillow Fight
Vigo doesn't tell a story so much as present the audience with
a series of related sketches. These statements are the steps in his
argument and lead to his conclusion, the climax. The conclusion of
"Zero for Conduct" is rebellion in the form of a pillow fight.
The place is the boys' dormitory, the time is night, and the boys
are restless. Three student leaders approach the headmaster who
sleeps in the dorm with them and silently tie him to his bed.
Elated, the boys begin a furious pillow fight by candlelight. In a
triumphant procession done in slow motion, the boys parade the
length of the room with the still sleeping headmaster and his bed
tilted vertically amid flickering candles and feathery down.
Melodrama Made Convincing
"L'Atalante" is more ambitious and even more successful. It is
the melodramatic tale of Jean and Juliette who begin their married
life on the barge, L'Atalante. Handyman Pere Jules helps on the
barge when not occupied with his cats or accordion. Juliette, un
able to accept the constrictions of life on board a barge, yields to the
temptations of Paris and deserts Jean. Pere Jules, being the handy
man he is, finds Juliette and reunites her with Jean.
By infusing the entire film with a visual poetry all his own,
Vigo's tale becomes convincing, if not transcending melodrama al
together.
In shot after shot, Vigo's genius of conveying a sense of atmo
sphere and milieu is apparent. In one breathtakingly beautiful
shot, we watch the coal-black L'Atalante glide down a canal at night
with Juliette on deck dressed in white. In other circumstances, this
obviously "pretty" picture would have failed, but it works here
because it effectively contributes to the organic unity of the film.

Vigo was ably assisted by Michael Simon, who gives one of the
screen's classic characterizations as Pere Jules. In his longest
scene, Pere Jules permits Juliette in his cabin to show her his
most prized possessions collected on his voyages. The cabin is a
packrat's dream. Jules must have something from every port he's
ever visited and a remembrance of everyone he's ever known. His
personal favorite is the hands of a dead friend preserved in a jar
of alcohol.

Vigo's tale becomes convincing, if not transcending melodrama al
together.
In shot after shot, Vigo's genius of conveying a sense of atmo
sphere and milieu is apparent. In one breathtakingly beautiful
shot, we watch the coal-black L'Atalante glide down a canal at night
with Juliette on deck dressed in white. In other circumstances, this
obviously "pretty" picture would have failed, but it works here
because it effectively contributes to the organic unity of the film.

Vigo was ably assisted by Michael Simon, who gives one of the
screen's classic characterizations as Pere Jules. In his longest
scene, Pere Jules permits Juliette in his cabin to show her his
most prized possessions collected on his voyages. The cabin is a
packrat's dream. Jules must have something from every port he's
ever visited and a remembrance of everyone he's ever known. His
personal favorite is the hands of a dead friend preserved in a jar
of alcohol.
Experiments In Technique
Although "L'Atalante' is a conventional tale, Vigo's technique
is again unconventional. Once again he presents a series of sketches
rather than an elaborately spun out tale. Yet "L'Atalante" is such
an individual and personal creation that only rarely are thest
sketches cliche-ridden. The opening scene follows Jean and Juliette
from the wedding chapel to the barge and their departure. Yet we
never see the church or any of the ceremony. Wo know Jean and
Juliette have just been married because of their wedding clothes.
But instead of telling us what we already know, Vigo dwells on the
comments and expressions of the wedding party.
Vigo's technique while experimental is never obtrusive. It is com
pletely right for the occasion. Alone in Paris, a man tries to rob
Juliette. She struggles, a crowd gathers, and the thief flees. This
emotionally jarring scene is accentuated by Vigo's shooting part of
it from behind a picket fence, thus achieving a stroboscopic-like
effect.
To that rare species, that dedicated follower of film, the cineaste,
Jean Vigo is a prophetic hero. Unfortunately, few other people have
ever heard of him.
It's not hard to understand why. It is as though the facts of
Vigo's life and films have conspired to perpetuate his obscurity. At
the same time, those who know about Vigo have lionized him and
idolized him to the point where he currently enjoys an underground
reputation only loosely based on fact.
The International Film Forum showed Vigo's "Zero for Conduct'
last Thursday and will show "L'Atalante" tomorrow at 8:15 at
Tresidder.
A Rebel In Film
Vigo's father was a rebel, an anarchist executed during Clemen
ceau's regime. Son Jean was a rebel too — not only against the
established order of things like his father, but also against the estab
lished way of how to make a film. It has been said with some truth
that he wielded the camera as a weapon, not as an anesthetic.
Unfortunately for us and fortunately for mythmakers, Vigo didn't
live long enough to do what he wanted to. He died worn out at the
age of 29 of tuberculosis. He was able to complete only two feature
length films. "Zero de Conduite" (Zero for Conduct, 1933) and
"L'Atalante" (1934) were done in the last two years of his life.
"Zero for Conduct", an attack on everything the French school
system stood for, was promptly banned by the censor and not
cleared for release for twenty years, until 1954. "L'Atalante" has
only been shown sporadically.
A Prophet And A Hero
The Vigo legend came of age with the nouvelle vague, which
hailed him as a prophet and hero. Resnais and Truffaut, among
others, have praised him publicly in print. The similarities between
"Zero for Conduct" and"The 400 Blows", Truffant's first feature,
have been noted by critics, friendly and otherwise.
Thus, it was with considerable expectation and even more appre
hension that I first journeyed to see Vigo's films. Fortunately, the
legend is true. Jean Vigo has got to be one of the few authentic
geniuses in the history of the cinema.
Students vs. Teachers
"Zero for Conduct" is set in a French school. It loosely chronicles
school life from the boys' return from vacation, through their antics
in class and in the dormitory, their annihilation of a Parents' Day,
and culminates with their revolt. From beginning to end, it is stu

dents versus teachers and Vigo's sympathy lies wholeheartedly
with the students.
"Zero for Conduct" is no dry social documentary. Vigo's school
is run by a veritable gallery of grotesques. The headmaster is a
bungling buffoon whom the students deceive with ease. The princi
pal is a four foot midget constantly attired in tails and a huge top
hat, who can barely see over the top of his desk. They wage a
futile holding action against their heathen charges. Together, they
mete out punishment only vaguely proportionate to the offense.
Vigo's technique is already fully developed. In the very first
scene, he demonstrates his genius for conceiving and executing
a scene in purely cinematic terms. One boy joins another on a train
returning them to school. He proceeds to pull balloons out of his
pocket which they blow up. Then out comes a small flute, then
goose quills, then a spiral with a ball in it, and finally, huge long
cigars which they puff contentedly. The scene is at least two or
three minutes long yet not one word is spoken.
The Pillow Fight
Vigo doesn't tell a story so much as present the audience with
a series of related sketches. These statements are the steps in his
argument and lead to his conclusion, the climax. The conclusion of
"Zero for Conduct" is rebellion in the form of a pillow fight.
The place is the boys' dormitory, the time is night, and the boys
are restless. Three student leaders approach the headmaster who
sleeps in the dorm with them and silently tie him to his bed.
Elated, the boys begin a furious pillow fight by candlelight. In a
triumphant procession done in slow motion, the boys parade the
length of the room with the still sleeping headmaster and his bed
tilted vertically amid flickering candles and feathery down.
Melodrama Made Convincing
"L'Atalante" is more ambitious and even more successful. It is
the melodramatic tale of Jean and Juliette who begin their married
life on the barge, L'Atalante. Handyman Pere Jules helps on the
barge when not occupied with his cats or accordion. Juliette, un
able to accept the constrictions of life on board a barge, yields to the
temptations of Paris and deserts Jean. Pere Jules, being the handy
man he is, finds Juliette and reunites her with Jean.
By infusing the entire film with a visual poetry all his own,
Vigo's tale becomes convincing, if not transcending melodrama al
together.
In shot after shot, Vigo's genius of conveying a sense of atmo
sphere and milieu is apparent. In one breathtakingly beautiful
