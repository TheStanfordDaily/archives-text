# Massarenti Leads Cultural Improvement Drive Here
## 
### 
The ASSU Cultural Affairs
Committee under Iho chairman
ship of Vice-president Cesare
Massarenti is beginning work
on improving the cultural cli
mate of the university.
At a meeting yesterday after
noon in Tresidder members of
the committee deplored the cul
tural atmosphere here. "People
around here just aren't interest
ed in music," said Tom Chung,
graduate student in business.
Massarenti agreed and explain
ed that he was trying to use
his position to encourage student
groups to do "whatever they
want to do" in the way of cul
tural creativity. The committee
will serve as a clearing house
for students who want places
in which to perform or need
money for performances.
One proposal was to hold more
activities of a cultural nature in
living groups. "Rut I've talked
to all the presidents of houses
in Stern," Don Hawkins, a Stern
resident, said. "The houses just
don't want to take money they've
already budgeted and spend it
on something cultural."
By "cultural" Massarenti at
least meant to emphasize jazz
and electronic music. "That kind
of music forces people to think;
it shakes their minds," he said.
Creativity House faculty resi
dent John Chowning of the Mu
sic Department is working with
Massarenti to get a room in the
Museum where experimental
music can bo played. The room
would have speakers on the ceil
ing; performances may take
place as frequently as once a
week.

The committee will try to co
ordinate the events already go
ing on in the Stanford commu
nity. Massarenti says he will
try to create a file of names of
people who would be interested
in being active in student pro
ductions of various sorts.
The committee also is discus
sing plans to have name musi
cians come to the West Coast to
play at Stanford and at other
colleges and universities. The
cost of the concerts would be
shared among the schools.
"This sort of plan could open
up a lot of possibilities," Mas
sarenti said. Money for cultural
ventures may be gotten from the
Legislature or from the Univer
sity's Student Initiative Fund.
Mike Weinstein, Legislature
speaker and committee member,
said that funds could be fairly
easy to come by from the Legis
lature for individual student
groups who want to put on pro
ductions.
Members of the committee
meet again next week and soon
will post information sheets in
residences about how their ser
vices can be used.
Meanwhile they are trying to
encourage student efforts in cul
tural endeavor. Members are An
nette Amend, Lagunita; Tom
Chung, Graduate School of Busi
ness; Barbara Levin, Flo Mo;
Don Hawkins, Stern; Barbara
Levin, Flo Mo.
Others include Steven McMil

Lambda Nu; John Shepherd, off
campus; Bob Stillman, Los Ar
cos; Mike Weinstein, LASSU;
