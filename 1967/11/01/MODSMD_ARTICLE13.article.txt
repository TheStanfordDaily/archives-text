# Stanford Activists Try Communal Living
## 
### Penny Hill 
Community living is the suc
cessful venture of the ten mem
bers of the "Peace and Libera
tion Commune" of East Palo
Alto.

Speaking of the Commune is
easy, for everyone and every
thing about them is part of it.
Going to it is difficult, for there
are three houses that make up
the living quarters. Each house
group lives separately but the

members move freely from
house to house.
Eight of the C<) mmune mem
bers, most of whom are ex-
Stanford student: 3,, are part of
the Resistance ai i ti-draft move
ment, including David Harris
and Dennis Sweeiniey.
The Harris-Sw( > eney house,
2282 Glen Way, is the Resistance
national office. T vo presses at
the house at 2HS !0 Cooley St.
have turned thait base into a
business headquarters, and the
third house at :2 7544 Moody
Road in Los Altcis Hills serves
as a retreat for relaxation, read
ing or studying.
Started ir i Wilbur
In 1965 Harriis met Jeffrey
Shurtleff while 11 ley were spon
sors in Wilbur where, noted
Shurtleff, a feel ing of commu
nity had grown aunong the spon
sors. They were able to share
their ideas about educational re
form as well as c»n other topics.
"It was the kin d of tentative
community," Sh> urtleff said,
"that was in a large way re
sponsible for Da.vid being elect
ed president."
After Harris was elected
ASSU President, he moved with
Shurtleff, Kent Hudson and Ed
die Brook into the house on
Cooley. "Everyone who came to
that community was a political
person," remark e d Shurtleff, em
phasizing that r,n ore of these in
dividuals are be ing attracted to
the houses.
One of the r nost important
things about th e • Commune, ac
cording to Sweeney, is that it
"was formed very unselfcon
sciously." This iiummer Harris,
Shurtleff, and , Stuart McCrae
were living at the Cooley St.
house and mori? friends started
moving in.
It Happens fl One Day
Then one afternoon when
they were discus; sing buying two
presses for the E :esistance work,
they thought it would be more
practical to poo] all their mon
ey. That was thie beginning of
the Commune.
Sweeney says i that no one
ever planned otil: what the Com
mune should be? and Hudson re
marks that it ' 'just happened"
which, in his c ipinion, is "the
healthiest way to do it."
Most of the i nembers of the
commune have outside work,
which Sweeney feels is very im
portant. "I thin 1 < that the main
problem of co n imunes is that
people forget communal living
serves as a base? to go out in the
world and work ," he remarked,
pointing out th< it in most com
munes the probl ems are those of
the commune itself. By de-em
phasizing the sil tructure, Sween
ey sees the Co mmune as "lib
erated territorjr. "
Community Strengthens
The members of the Com
mune feel that community has
strengthened I.Yiem. "All of us
one year ago,'' Sweeney admit
ted, "were inso cure about what
our position 'a/ould be in the
world without doing the work
we are doing right now and
without a collcge degree." The

financial problem has been alle
viated by the economic struc
ture of the commune—one bank
account.
From this system few prob
lems have emerged. Funds are
brought into the commune
through the members' jobs, their
own personal money, contribu
tions from various faculty mem
bers as well as from individuals
outside the campus. In addition
Joan Baez contributed $2,000 to
Resistance work.
There is no supervision over
the bank account; most of the
personal expenditures are small.
The major costs are rent, gaso
line, travel expenses, and tele
phone bills for Resistance work,
and giving away money to other
Resistance organizations. "Food
isn't much of a problem," said
Hudson, also noting that there
have been few bills for clothing.
"None of us expects to buy a
tuxedo," he added.
Communal Neighborhood
The Commune is also think
ing of developing a communal
type neighborhood. Such a group
could purchase large quantities
of food wholesale. Another plan
is to invest in some land and
build houses.
With all this talk of food, an
interesting aspect of the Com
mune is its cullinary talents.
Sweeney recognized Timmy En
glish as being an excellent cook.
While modestly claiming some
talent with liver, Hudson ack
nowledged that perhaps Harris
is the best cook in the Com
mune.
Problems of the six-month-old
Commune seem to center around
keeping the system functioning
for several years. "The problem
before too long," says Sweeney,
"will be that some of us are go
ing to be in jail."
Varied Background
Who lives in which residence
varies, but presently Harris and
Sweeney live on Glen Way. Orig
inally Harris is from Fresno and
Sweeney is from Portland. Both
of these young men, age 21 and
24 respectively, were involved
with peace work while at Stan
ford. Both spent some time in
Mississippi working for the Stu
dent Non-violent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC.)
Harris was in the Social
Thought and Institution honors
program and Sweeney was ma
joring in English when they
quit. Their reason for dropping
out, as for most of the Com
mune members, was that there
was "no particular reason to fin
ish up," according to Hudson.
The end of the spring '66 quar
ter was Harris' last schooling en
deavor, and Sweeney quit after
the winter '66 quarter.
"I dropped out of sc ho o 1,"
Sweeney stated, "because I can
do a much better job of educat
ing myself for the work I want
to do at my own pace and on my
own terms without any of the
requirements school places on
you ... I had a very hard time
making school work for me."
To Sweeney dropping out of
school is not the answer for
everyone. He feels people should

"decide what kind of work they
want to do first" and then de
cide whether or not dropping
out will help them.
The members of the commune
are not unintelligent drifters.
Each has a purpose and it is
basically Resistance work. How
ever, Sweeney disagrees that
preliminary college education
and experience enlightened
them, remarking that it is "not
their brightness but their integ
rity" that is noticeable about
them.
Cites Environment
He also feels that the total
American environment has con
tributed to this. "We tend to for
get," he argued, "that in a world
wide perspective we're the most
formally educated and technical
ly skilled of young people any
where," and added that each
person's work is "central to this.
What people have to decide is
what their attitude is toward
their work. Is work an alienated
thing or is it your own thing?"
He concluded by expressing that
their thing was "wholeness and
not brightness."
On Cooley Street
The residents on Cooley Street
are Bill Shurtleff, Rodney Gage,
Stuart McCrae, and Robert
Stege.
Bill is currently with the "Sen
sory awareness" Esalen pro
gram at Stanford. At 26, he is
a Stanford graduate school drop
out. He received a double major
in Engineering and Humanities.
Rodney Gage, 21, has been in
the Commune since June and
feels the spirit of the group has
made it easier for him to turn
in his draft card. He also feels
that community "is a better way
to live."
Analyzing the Commune is
difficult for him. "When you're
living it, being it, you don't real
ly think about it,"he said.
Majoring in philosophy, Gage
attended San Mateo and San
Jose colleges and then "left the
country because I didn't dig it
any more." He spent two months
in London and then enrolled in
a school in Sweden. When he re
turned to the United States he
worked a while in IBM compu
ter programming and then en
rolled at Berkeley. Realizing
that he "couldn't take it at all"
at Cal, he dropped out in his
junior year.
Planning A Magazine
Gage revealed that the Resist
ance will publish a monthly
magazine entitled Resist which
will include more than non-co
operation information. "It will
be a freer thing," containing
some of Harris' and Shurtleff's
poetry.
Many outsiders come to the
houses just to talk because, ac
cording to Gage, "that's what we
do," and they do it just about
24 hours a day. Another thing
they do is play music. Hudson,
Jeff Shurtleff, McCrae and Swee
ney all play guitar, Harris auto
harp, Gage and Tramp, bass,
English sax and harmonica, Bill
Shurtleff, Jeff's brother, banjo,

and Stege "maybe autoharp."
The general consensus of the
group is that he is best on ma
chines — an "artist with a
wrench," according to Hudson.
Stuart McCrae, 23, is in the
same academic situation as Har
ris with several incomplete units
outstanding at Stanford. Both
he and Gage are printers. Mc-
Crae also does Resistance speak
ing as he did yesterday in White
Plaza. (Many members of the
Resistance plan to join the SDS
demonstration today against the
CIA.)
The mechanical genius of the
Commune is Robert Stege, 25,
who, according to reports, as
sembled the two presses and got
them operating in two weeks.
A graduate of the Maritime
Academy, Stege is now in the
merchant marine.
Retreat On Moody
At the Moody Rd. retreat live
Kent Hudson, Timmy English,
Jeffrey Shurtleff, and '"^iamp."
Hudson, 22, graduated from
Stanford with a degree in his
tory, went to Louisiana in 1965
and to Mississippi in 1966 and
worked for SNCC on campus.
(Eddie Brook, one of the first
members, is from Bates, Miss.,
and went with Hudson to the
South and decided to stay
there.) Hudson is from Vista in
Southern California and pres
ently works at Kepler's Book
Store.
English, 21, is a Stanford
drop out who teaches yoga, but
not for money. Tramp "just
showed up a month ago," and is
a yoga student from Hawaii.
Tramp, however, teaches En
glish yoga.

Jeffrey Shurtleff recently com
pleted a 10 day stay in Santa
Rita prison which he feels was
"the most powerful 10 days I've
ever lived . . . It's not pleasant,
but it makes you feel good. You
get to talk to the cops . . .It's
a free University in a way . . .
really vital people. It's a groove
to be with them."
Jeffrey has been involved in
war resistance since 1962. He
feels a certain magnetism of
like values among war resisters
has attracted the Commune
members to each other.
Brings Out Powers
He feels very positively about
the Commune, stating that "the
situation of community is such
that it brings out in a person
powers that we knew to be
latent powers that were being
stiffled by lack of community."
"People don't want to be
alone," he said, also noting they
"want to feel that with their
minds they are contributing to
something that is greater than
they are."
He summed up the most gen
eral feeling towards the Com
mune by saying "Everything
becomes less complicated and
more rewarding when done in
community."
Although much effort has
been exerted to separate infor
mation about the Resistance
from the Commune in this arti
cle, the Commune members
themselves stress the Commune
was the result of the Resistance
and the main project of the
Commune is the Resistance.
The strength of the Com
mune, says Sweeney, is "recog
nition this work is important."


COMMUNE FOUNDER — Resistance leader David Harris never
planned a commune; it just "happened."


HISTORY DROPOUT — Another important person in the Resis
tance, Dennis Sweeney, dropped out of Stanford because he could
do better work out of school.


NATIONAL HEADQUARTERS — This house on Glen Way in East Pa lo Alto is the headquarters
of nation-wide Resistance activities.


WORK TO BE DONE — Rodney Gage prepares material for RE
SIST, a monthly magazine the Resistance will soon publish.


COMMUNE STRENGTHENS — Although Jeffrey Shurtieff seems to be physically strengthened by
commune life, he points out that it is also mental ly strengthening.
