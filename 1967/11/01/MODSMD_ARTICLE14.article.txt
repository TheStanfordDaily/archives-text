# SDS Sit-in Interrupts CIA Interviews At Maryland
## 
### 
COLLEGE PARK, MARY
LAND (CPS) — The Students
for a Democratic Society at the
University of Maryland claimed
a victory recently over the Cen
tral Intelligence Agency after
about 25 students sat in and
halted C.I.A. job interviewing
here.
"The idea is to go in and stop
the guy from operating," said
demonstrator Bob Wade, "and
we did."
The demonstration started
yesterday morning when a num
ber of SDS members and other
students sat down in the hall of
the engineering building where

CIA interviews were to be held.
Demonstrators left the building
at 3:30 p.m. after a member of
the campus police force read
the Maryland Trespass Act to
them.
At least two students seeking
jobs with the CIA intend to try
again for interviews. Paul Feld
man, 22, a senior in civil engi
neering, who failed to get into
his interview, said, "These peo
ple talk about rights—l came
here for a job and I think
they're infringing on my
rights."
Janis Putnam, a 22-year-old
math major, said, "I know they
do computer programming, and
that's what I want to do. I'm

not directly involved in what
they do. I ju s t feel that they are
part of the government and
what they d o is right."
SDS intern is to continue to
block the irit erviews today and
tomorrow. A t least 15 students
have signifioi j their willingness
to go to jail.
Oberliin Simmers
OBERLEV, OHIO — The New
York Times reported that Ober
lin College c ancelled all classes
Monday to stage a campuswide
"think-in" c >n the mounting
problem of < mtiwar demonstra
tions.
The step followed disruptive
student protests Thursday and
Friday agai r ist the liberal arts

college's policy of making facili
ties available to military re
cruiters.
About 2,000 of the college's
2,500 students filled the college
chapel for the voluntary three
hour assembly. Many hissed
when college president Robert
Carr questioned the "courage
and conviction" of those who
had disrupted recruiting efforts.
The consensus among the stu
dents seemed to be for a refer
endum to determine what the
stand would be. Students and
faculty, • meeting in small
groups, discussed all afternoon
the alternatives that a vote
should offer.
"Any person or institution
who wishes to use Oberlin facili

ties must be willing to engage
in a free interchange of ideas,"
Mark Landy, a student, said.
President Carr likened the
barring of recruiters to former
Gov. George Wallace's "stand
in the schoolhouse door" to pre
vent Negroes from entering the
University of Alabama.
Paul Osterman, a senior his
tory major, countered by saying
that no one had a moral right
to recruit people for the purpose
of burning and bombing Viet
namese citizens.
Thursday more than 100 stu
dents imprisoned a Navy re
cruiter in his auto for four
hours when he sought to enter
the campus. The police used
water hoses and tear gas to dis

perse the demonstrators.
Oberlin policy, affirmed by the
faculty following an anti-war
demonstration last February,
authorizes suspension or expul
sion of demonstrators.
Dow Unperturbed
MIDLAND, MICHIGAN—The
Times also reported that spokes
men for the Dow Chemical Com
pany, a napalm manufacturer,
said recently that campus dem
onstrations against the company
have not hurt recruitment
drives at universities.
The company has no intention
of curtailing the drive or chang
ing it. Employee recruitment by
the large chemical producer has
been the target of protests at a

number of universities, includ
ing Harvard and the Universi
ties of Illinois, Michigan and
Wisconsin, since Dow makes
napalm used in the Vietnam
war.
Dow is said to be the only sup
plier of napalm B, a product
composed of gasoline, benzene,
and polystyrene. Napalm B is
made in Torrance, California.
The jelly-like substance, drop
ped by airplane, sticks to what
ever it touches and burns with
such heat that all oxygen in the
immediate area is quickly used
up.
Company spokesmen said
Dow's sales of napalm to the
Government came to less than
$6.5 million last year.
