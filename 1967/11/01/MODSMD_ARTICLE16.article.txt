### 
The National Student Associa
tion wants you to skip dinner
Nov. 20.
"On that day, students will
voluntarily give up their eve
ning meal so that an equivalent
amount of money can be do
nated to the Fast for Freedom
Fund," according to NSA litera
ture.
NSA claims 100,000 students
will poin in the sixth annual
fast, which "supports selected
civil rights and anti-poverty pro
jects."
Last year 75,000 students
fasted and raised "over $25,000"
for the fund, according to NSA.
Calculations by The Daily indi
cate the average student valued
his evening meal at 33 cents if
the NSA figures are accurate.
In a tenuously related de
velopment, NSA President Ed
ward Schwartz named Stanford,
Michigan and Wayne State as
possible targets for future pro
tests against campus recruiting
associated with the war in Viet
nam.
Schwartz also told the Associ
ated Press that the use of police
to quell campus protests has
been reckless, unrestrained and
"even brutal."
NSA has scheduled * "student
power conference" Nov. 17-19 at
the University of Minnesota
"oriented to provide large group
and small group discussion and
planning.".
. "You have nothing to lose but
your dorm hours and restric
tions, your arbitrary expulsions,
your outrageous bookstore
prices, your speaker bans, your
press censorship, and the other
manifestations of your lack of
power,' NSA says bravely in a
circular announcing the con
ference.
