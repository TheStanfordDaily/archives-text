# Defector Speaks On China
## 
### 
Dr. Chow Ching-wen, defector
from Communist China, sees the
Cultural Revolution as a "ter
rible conflict between the leaders
of the Chinese Communist
Party." Dr. Chow spoke last
night at Tresidder on the revo
lution and its possible effects on
Asia.
"Cultural Revolution," he said,
"is just a new term for a prob
lem dating from the middle
1950's." Mao Tse-tung's former
friends and allies seem to have
turned against him now that
they have seen him in action. Dr.
Ching-wen claimed that a letter
sent by China's Defense Minister
to Mao in 1958 warned, "If you
don't change your policies, the
Party is all through by the peo
ple."
There will be no peace in Asia,
Dr. Chow declared, as long as
the Communists are in power
in China. Peaceful co-existonce
is impossible. He cited the differ
ences in the economic struc
tures of China and Asia's other
great power, Japan, as one of
the biggest obstacles in the
struggle for peace.
Mao Tse-tung has lost not only
the support of other leaders, but
also of the majority of the peo
ple as well. Dr. Chow estimated
that more than 85'A of the Chi
nese people oppose the Commu
nist regime. He said that only

five provinces and two cities are
under Mao's control. Two thirds
of the armyj are members of the
opposition.
While the majority of the peo
ple are opposed to the regime
in power, few actually support
the opposition or would rather
see it in power instead. Dr. Chow
reminded the audience that even
if the opposition takes over, con
ditions will not change, for it,
too, is a Communist faction.
