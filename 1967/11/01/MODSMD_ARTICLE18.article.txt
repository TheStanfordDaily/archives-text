Jean Krauss, 23, of Skippaok,
Pa., was congratulated recently
by Vice President Hubert H.
Humphrey following her per
formance as a tightly-clad go-go
girl at an election rally for the
mayor of Philadelphia.
"I was thunderstruck," said
Miss Krauss of her meeting

anything. Really, I'm not used
to meeting vice presidents in my
underwear." â€”AP
