# Democrats Will Try To 'Dump Johnson'
## 
### DAN SNELL 
Stanford's Young Democrats
voted unanimously last night
to support actively the "Dump
Johnson" campaign.
The 20 YD's present opted to
follow the lead of the California
Democratic Council which is
working to elect a slate of dele
gates to the national convention
next summer pledged to some
candidate other than President
Johnson and to an end to the
Vietnam war.
One member told The Dally
that the move was made in re
sponse to views stated by A 1
Lowenstein, a co-chairman of
the Committee of Concerned
Democrats, who recently spoke
at Stanford. Professor George
Leppert, local head of the CDC,
also affected the decision.
Just what concrete action the
Young Democrats will take has
not yet been decided. They
elected an eight-man policy com
mittee with Jack Porter as
chairman to decide the specific
role the Stanford YD's would
play in the "Dump Johnson"
move.
'Disastrous Involvement'
The resolution adopted at the
meeting said that United States
involvement in the Vietnam war
"has been disastrous to the peo

pie of South Vietnam, whose
economy and society it is
destroying, to the people of Am
erica, whose urgent problems of
poverty and racism are being
neglected, and indeed to the peo
ple of the world, who are being
needlessly pushed to the brink
of nuclear war."
The Young Democrats blamed
President Johnson for the di
lemma the nation is in and
termed the war "largely" his re
sponsibility.
The club may participate in
distribution of "Dump Johnson"
literature and in a door-to-door
campaign. The exact form of
their tactic will be determined
by the newly elected policy com
mittee.
YD's Seek Role
"You'll be hearing a lot more
from us," member Skip Martin
told The Daily.
The resolution went on to say
that the Young Democrats wish
ed to "affiliate with the Califor
nia Democratic Council and take
an active role in the election of
the slate of delegates, sponsored
by the CDC, which is pledged to
an end to the Vietnam war."
The delegates the CDC is try
ing to elect are to be pledged
against Johnson but to no par
ticular candidate unless some na

tional Democratic figure decides
to vie with Johnson for the con
vention's nod.
The YD's resolution said the
group would try to "initiate a
program to convince voters, can
didates, local party leaders, and
students (as potential campaign
workers) of the necessity and
efficacy of assuring that Lyndon
Johnson is not the candidate of
the Democratic Party for Presi
dent of the United States in
1968."

ticular candidate unless some na

tional Democratic figure decides
to vie with Johnson for the con
vention's nod.
The YD's resolution said the
group would try to "initiate a
program to convince voters, can
didates, local party leaders, and
students (as potential campaign
workers) of the necessity and
efficacy of assuring that Lyndon
Johnson is not the candidate of
the Democratic Party for Presi
dent of the United States in
1968."
Stanford's Young Democrats
voted unanimously last night
to support actively the "Dump
Johnson" campaign.
The 20 YD's present opted to
follow the lead of the California
Democratic Council which is
working to elect a slate of dele
gates to the national convention
next summer pledged to some
candidate other than President
Johnson and to an end to the
Vietnam war.
One member told The Dally
that the move was made in re
sponse to views stated by A 1
Lowenstein, a co-chairman of
the Committee of Concerned
Democrats, who recently spoke
at Stanford. Professor George
Leppert, local head of the CDC,
also affected the decision.
Just what concrete action the
Young Democrats will take has
not yet been decided. They
elected an eight-man policy com
mittee with Jack Porter as
chairman to decide the specific
role the Stanford YD's would
play in the "Dump Johnson"
move.
'Disastrous Involvement'
The resolution adopted at the
meeting said that United States
involvement in the Vietnam war
"has been disastrous to the peo

pie of South Vietnam, whose
economy and society it is
destroying, to the people of Am
erica, whose urgent problems of
poverty and racism are being
neglected, and indeed to the peo
ple of the world, who are being
needlessly pushed to the brink
of nuclear war."
The Young Democrats blamed
President Johnson for the di
lemma the nation is in and
termed the war "largely" his re
sponsibility.
The club may participate in
distribution of "Dump Johnson"
literature and in a door-to-door
campaign. The exact form of
their tactic will be determined
by the newly elected policy com
mittee.
YD's Seek Role
"You'll be hearing a lot more
from us," member Skip Martin
told The Daily.
The resolution went on to say
that the Young Democrats wish
ed to "affiliate with the Califor
nia Democratic Council and take
an active role in the election of
the slate of delegates, sponsored
by the CDC, which is pledged to
an end to the Vietnam war."
The delegates the CDC is try
ing to elect are to be pledged
against Johnson but to no par
ticular candidate unless some na

tional Democratic figure decides
to vie with Johnson for the con
vention's nod.
