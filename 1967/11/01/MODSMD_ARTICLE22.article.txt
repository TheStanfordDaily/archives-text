# The 						Whys Of Fumblesâ€”Ralston Talks
## 
### NICK SELBY 
(An interview with Stanford
football coach John Ralston.)
Q. Stanford fumbled the ball
nix times last Saturday, losing
it three times, had three passes
Intercepted, and gave up 17
points directly through mistakes.
Can you think of any reason for
all these mis takes?
Coach Ralston: When we play
a game like that, making so
many careless errors, when we
haven't been giving away points
before, we naturally look for rea

sons. But it's a mystery to us.
Tom Massey fumbled twice re
ceiving punts, recovering one
and losing one. He really isn't
a ball carrier, however. Nate
Kirtman also fumbled twice, but
the films showed Army nearly
tore his arm off on one of the
fumbles.
Two interceptions came from
passes that were batted by de
fensive linemen. One pass came
down to an Army man on his
knees. It wasn't bad passing by
Chuck Williams.

We study and revise our hand
off techniques all the time, and
put our running backs through
"gauntlet drills", where we try
to knock the ball free, daily. I
know the mistakes don't come
from mental lapses, poor condi
tioning, or lack of spirit.
Q. How do you treat players
after they've made mistakes?
Coach .Ralston: First we try
to decide why the mistake hap
pened. Then, it depends on the
player involved whether we'll de
mote him or forget- about it.

We are thinking of some
changes on both offense and de
fense, but nothing is final right
now.
Q. During the second quarter,
we ran four plays at the goal
from the three, one Root plunge
after another, but didn't score.
What happened? Did you think
of trying a quarterback sneak?
Coach Ralston: We decided to
stick with the fullback diving
over a power wedge. It's our
bread and butter play inside the
ten. On the last play, we missed
the handoff. Root was far into
the end zone, but didn't have the
ball. It fooled everyone. Williams
spun around and just missed
scoring.
Q. Who were the offensive and
defensive standouts of the
game?
Coach Ralston: Once again,
Chuck Williams was excellent
at quarterback. Mike Willard fill
ed in very well for injured Phil
Messer at guard, and tackle Mal
colm Snider played well. Tom
Giallonardo had his best game
at center.
We were disappointed overall
with the defense, but Tom Hazel
rigg and Dick Oliver at defen
sive end and halfback played
well.
Q. What do you expect from
Washington this week?
Coach Ralston: Washington al
ways gets up for the game with
us, and we have to play in Seat
tle, which is as tough a place to
play as anywhere.
The Huskies are one of three

teams in the conference we
haven't been successful with for
the last few years and are a big
challenge.
Washington is solid every
where on defense, very tough on
defense. Tom Manke has passed
very well to Jim Cope, and Gary
James was Back of the Game
against Cal last week. Don Mar
tin kicked four field goals
against us last year to beat us
and has scored 42 points this
year.
Our injury situation looks
good right now. Oliver, Willard,
and John Haygood have sprained
ankles, but should be able to
play Saturday.

Intercepted, and gave up 17
points directly through mistakes.
Can you think of any reason for
all these mis takes?
Coach Ralston: When we play
a game like that, making so
many careless errors, when we
haven't been giving away points
before, we naturally look for rea

sons. But it's a mystery to us.
Tom Massey fumbled twice re
ceiving punts, recovering one
and losing one. He really isn't
a ball carrier, however. Nate
Kirtman also fumbled twice, but
the films showed Army nearly
tore his arm off on one of the
fumbles.
Two interceptions came from
passes that were batted by de
fensive linemen. One pass came
down to an Army man on his
knees. It wasn't bad passing by
Chuck Williams.

We study and revise our hand
off techniques all the time, and
put our running backs through
"gauntlet drills", where we try
to knock the ball free, daily. I
know the mistakes don't come
from mental lapses, poor condi
tioning, or lack of spirit.
Q. How do you treat players
after they've made mistakes?
Coach .Ralston: First we try
to decide why the mistake hap
pened. Then, it depends on the
player involved whether we'll de
mote him or forget- about it.

We are thinking of some
changes on both offense and de
fense, but nothing is final right
now.
Q. During the second quarter,
we ran four plays at the goal
from the three, one Root plunge
after another, but didn't score.
What happened? Did you think
of trying a quarterback sneak?
Coach Ralston: We decided to
stick with the fullback diving
over a power wedge. It's our
bread and butter play inside the
ten. On the last play, we missed
the handoff. Root was far into
the end zone, but didn't have the
ball. It fooled everyone. Williams
spun around and just missed
scoring.
Q. Who were the offensive and
defensive standouts of the
game?
Coach Ralston: Once again,
Chuck Williams was excellent
at quarterback. Mike Willard fill
ed in very well for injured Phil
Messer at guard, and tackle Mal
colm Snider played well. Tom
Giallonardo had his best game
at center.
We were disappointed overall
with the defense, but Tom Hazel
rigg and Dick Oliver at defen
sive end and halfback played
well.
Q. What do you expect from
Washington this week?
Coach Ralston: Washington al
ways gets up for the game with
us, and we have to play in Seat
tle, which is as tough a place to
play as anywhere.
The Huskies are one of three

teams in the conference we
haven't been successful with for
the last few years and are a big
challenge.
Washington is solid every
where on defense, very tough on
defense. Tom Manke has passed
very well to Jim Cope, and Gary
James was Back of the Game
against Cal last week. Don Mar
tin kicked four field goals
against us last year to beat us
and has scored 42 points this
year.
Our injury situation looks
good right now. Oliver, Willard,
and John Haygood have sprained
ankles, but should be able to
play Saturday.

football coach John Ralston.)
