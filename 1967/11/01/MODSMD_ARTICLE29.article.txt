### 
ALLENTOWN, Pa (AP)â€” A
team of runners from Lafayette
College's Theta Xi fraternity
carried a pizza nearly 23 miles
Oct 28 to benefit the United
Fund.
They also claimed a world
record for the longest pizza de
livery on foot.
The fraternity donated 20
cents for each minute of the
run. It came to $29.
At Cedar Crest, the runners
presented the pizza to Jo Ellen
Cuozzi, a coed, from West
Orange, N.J. She took a bite,
then declared the pizza was cold.
