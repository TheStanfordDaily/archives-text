# Med School Lecture
## LSD-Birth Defect Link Denied 
### ODYS WOLLAN 
Dr. Daniel K. Friedman
dispelled the view that LSD
causes birth defects in a lecture
delivered Tuesday afternoon at
the Medical School.
His lecture, entitled "Biobe
havioral Studies of LSD in Ani
mals and Man", was given to
an audience of 75 to 100. Dr.
Friedman is a professor and
chairman of the Department of
Psychiatry at the University of
Chicago.
Friedman discussed damage
done to the body as a result of
LSD use. This is the issue that
the news media have empha
sized.
There have been seven scien
tific studies completed in this
area, and there is little agree
ment among them, other than
that there is yet "nothing dem
onstrably wrong" with the in
gestion of LSD to the body. In
most of the studies, some chro

mosomatic damage has been re
ported, but this damage has not
positively been linked to genetic
damage.
One current study dealt with
an Indian culture using peyote
(an organic drug related to
LSD). Although this culture
has been using peyote in their
religious services for several
hundred years, there are no indi
cations of "psychedelic mon
sters."
It was pointed out that caf
feine, Darvon, and several other
drugs readily available to the
public cause chromosomatic
damage similar to that of LSD.
Dr. Friedman stated that "LSD
is less dangerous than The Pill."
Despite the news coverage,
the biggest drug problem in
California today is alcohol, fol
lowed by barbituates, ampheta
mines, several others, and then
LSD, he said.

Dr. Friedman did, however,
stress that LSD could produce
psychological defects in the
user. The LSD "trip" is a "de
habituating experience," and the
problems arise when the individ
ual attempts to re-establish con
tacts with normal reality. If the
user cannot integrate his exper
ience into normal reality, he will
resort to escapism. The LSD
escapist tends to be philosophic
ally naive, Friedman said.
Integration could be accom
plished religiously, creatively,
or culturally, he said. An ex
ample of cultural integration
would be surrounding oneself
with those who have the same
problem.
Dr. Friedman said that the
main causes of "bad trips" were
an incompatible setting, the lack
of preparation on the part of the
user, and the absence of a
"guide" or a supportive group.
