# Food Service Changes Policy; Will Hire Bearded Employees
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
In a policy reversal the Uni
versity Food Service yesterday
opened all positions to bearded
employees.
Until the directive was issued,
men with beards were barred
from all food service jobs which
entail handling food.
William P. Myers, University
Food Service manager, insti
gated a policy re-evaluation af
ter Stanford student Muni Ba
rash was not hired as a Faculty
Club waiter allegedly because he
has a beard.
The food service is responsi
ble for all university residence
eating arrangements, excluding
fraternities and eating clubs.
Follow Different Course
Tresidder Union and the Fac
ulty Club are also independent
of the food service and deter
mine their own policies. Both
Tresidder and the Faculty Club
presently deny waiter or food
handling jobs to bearded men.
According to Myers, the deci
sion was made yesterday morn
ing after consultation with coun

ty health officials and his food
service managers.
County sanitation experts told
Myers that there are no state
or local statutes barring bearded
men from serving food, so long
as they meet other health stand
ards. The officials said that they
would not issue a prohibition on
beards.
Wants Good Grooming
Myers later issued a state
ment which read: "The resi
dence hall food services will ac
cept all students who meet so
cially acceptable standards of
good grooming, including neatly
trimmed beards for any hasher
position."
Myers explained, "We felt we
could say with justification that
a person with a beard is just as
acceptable as any student we
presently employ. We have final
ly accepted the fact that a per
son with good grooming habits
may have a beard."
He emphasized that good per
sonal grooming habits will con
tinue to be the standard that all
employees must meet in order

1 •>
to hold waiter or hasher posi
tions.
Whether a person wears a
beard or not, he will not be per
mitted to work on the lines or
in university dining rooms if he
is repugnant to staff members
and especially students, Myers
added.
He reported that since the ty
phoid outbreak last spring,
county officials have "moved in"
on the campus and are inspect
ing all aspects of food service.
It is for this reason that Myers
immediately sought the county
sanitation department's opinion
before taking the matter of
beards to his managers.
Recently, the county authori
ties required that all food ser
vice employees wear caps or
hairnets while on duty, even if
they are not directly handling
food.
A spot check in several resi
dences revealed that this county
ruling is not being actively en
forced. When informed, Myers
warned that "heads will roll" if
the county directive is not ob
served.

Whether a person wears a
beard or not, he will not be per

is repugnant to staff members
and especially students, Myers
added.
He reported that since the ty
phoid outbreak last spring,
county officials have "moved in"
on the campus and are inspect
ing all aspects of food service.
It is for this reason that Myers
immediately sought the county
sanitation department's opinion
before taking the matter of
beards to his managers.
Recently, the county authori
ties required that all food ser
vice employees wear caps or
hairnets while on duty, even if
they are not directly handling
food.
A spot check in several resi

ruling is not being actively en
forced. When informed, Myers
warned that "heads will roll" if
the county directive is not ob

According to Myers, the deci

County sanitation experts told
Myers that there are no state
or local statutes barring bearded
men from serving food, so long
as they meet other health stand

would not issue a prohibition on
beards.

Myers later issued a state

cially acceptable standards of
good grooming, including neatly
trimmed beards for any hasher
position."
Myers explained, "We felt we
