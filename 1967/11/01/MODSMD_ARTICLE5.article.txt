# SES Report Draws Mixed Reactions
## 
### ROBERT BRODY 
The position paper of the
Steering Committee of the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
has drawn a mixed reaction
from five campus figures.
Paul Berg and David Gilbarg,
professors of mathematics; Peter
Lyman, ASSU president; F. W.
Strothmann, professor of mod
ern European languages; and
Robert Walker, head of the Gen
eral Studies Committee, were
contacted by The Daily for com
ment.

Dr. Robert Walker, head of
the Academic Council's General
Studies Committee, supports the
goals set forth in the position
paper. He commented, "The re
port on the whole is provoca
tive and very useful. However,
the judgment on how it will
work must wait."
Among the problems which
the SES will have + o tackle to
effect their proposals Walker
cited the English composition is
sue. "SES assumes that the fac
ulty is willing and able to write
good prose. This may not al
ways be the case.
"Furthermore, many of the
faculty members do not consider
it their job to correct prose
style."
College To Hit Obstacle
Regarding the proposed ex
perimental college he indicated
one great obstacle. Departments
are unwilling to promote faculty
members who are doing much
of their work outside the depart
ment.
Such a situation led to the
failure of a similar program at
the University of Chicago.
He corrected the SES state
ment on freshman seminars by

observing that over 40 per cent
are taught not by "advanced
scholars" but by T.A.'s. He
thought that the problem in ex
pansion, therefore, lay in in
volving additional high-ranking
faculty.
Flexibility
To the statement that the Gen
eral Studies program is mono
lithic, Walker replied that he did
not find this term very descrip
tive and pointed out the flexi
bility of the program. He said
there are only two specifically
required series.
Furthermore, the maximum
number of units which a stu
dent must take in General Stu
dies and major requirements
combined is approximately 12C,
thus allowing well over a year
for the student to select his
own courses.
He remarked in relation to
the SES, "This kind of periodic
review is essential to keep Gen
eral Studies in line with our stu
dents and faculty. If the pro
gram is to be effective, however,
it must be consistent with the
primary professional and scho
larly interests of our depart
mental faculties, for these are

the centers of the university."
Peter Lyman, ASSU president,
expressed disappointment with
the report. "They've adopted
the liberal rhetoric of education
al reform but didn't get into
the fundamental questions of ed
ucational reform," he comment
ed.
He did not disagree with the
statements in the report, but he
criticized its implicit acceptance
of current assumptions and insti
tutions.
He noted, for example, that
the committee made no state
ment as to what type of teach
ers ought to be hired to instruct
undergraduates. There was no
discussion of the ideal student
faculty relationship.
Lyman also pointed out a lack
of discussion regarding class
room situations, particularly the
relative merits of lectures, semi
nars, and tutorials.
Variations On Theme
"This is typical of today's ed
ucational reform — variations
on an institutional theme," he
said. "Today students must get
an education through the non
institutional aspects of the uni
versity.

"Real education is a number
of relationships, which the SES
did not report on."
One of the major institutional
burdens, he believes, is the grad
ing system. If courses are inter
esting, students should take
them whether or not they are
required. Yet given even the
most ideal curriculum, this
would not happen.
Students Eye Grades
Students only take courses In
which they know they can do
well, Lyman maintains. Thus if
there were no grades, there
would be no need for General
Studies requirements, given an
interesting curriculum.
Regarding the proposed hon
ors programs and experimental
college — Lyman believes that
they can be worthwhile only in
light of SES investigation of
such factors as the hiring cri
teria for faculty and student
teacher relationship. A new cur
riculum is not enough, he said.
Mathematics Department Ex
ecutive Head David Gilbarg con
curred with the SES position
that "the math-or-language alter
native is an unreasonable re-
quirement. However, I believe
that both subjects should be
part of the General Studies pro
gram."
Keep Math, Language
He suggests, as an example,
that math be included under the
Natural Science Area Require
ment and that foreign languages
be available in the Humanities
category.
"One could ask if any natural
science is more relevant to the
needs of social science or hu
manities majors than mathema
tics," Gilbarg commented.
He pointed out. that, contrary
to the SES statement, there is
a math series (Mathematics 31-
35) designed to be of general
interest to non-science majors.
It may be taken to satisfy the
basic math requirement.
Math Serves Need
Associate Department Head
Paul W. Berg said the various
introductory calculus series cur
rently offered meet an impor
tant cultural need. They provide
a basic understanding of one of
the most important discoveries
of western civilization and mod
ern man's basic tool of science.
Regarding the SES recommen
dation of a new mathematical
logic - computer course, Berg
pointed out that there already
exists a General Studies course
in mathematical logic (Philo
sophy 3).

Gilbarg remarked ,"We accept
the importance of the computer,
particularly in technology, but
this does not mean that the type
of course suggested is appro
priate for a General Studies pro
gram in which the emphasis is
on cultural foundations rather
than on technology."
Return To Parochialism
Professor F. W. Strothmann,
Executive Head of the Modern
European Languages Depart
ment, stated, "Abolition of the
foreign language requirement
entirely is foolish. This would
be a return to parochialism."
He suggested that if there is
to be any revision of the langu
age requirement, students should
be able to place out of the re
quirement by a proficiency exam,
for which they would receive
no credit toward graduation.
Students failing to pass the
test would be required to do re
medial work until they could
pass. They would not be given
credit toward graduation for
such work.
Include Composition
Strothmann added that such
a system could be extended to
include English composition. He
also expressed concern over the
SES recommendation to abolish
the math requirement.
He noted the increased impor
tance of a thorough knowledge
of calculus in the social sciences
and linguistics.

part of the General Studies pro
gram."
Keep Math, Language
He suggests, as an example,
that math be included under the
Natural Science Area Require
ment and that foreign languages
be available in the Humanities
category.
"One could ask if any natural
science is more relevant to the
needs of social science or hu
manities majors than mathema
tics," Gilbarg commented.
He pointed out. that, contrary
to the SES statement, there is
a math series (Mathematics 31-
35) designed to be of general
interest to non-science majors.
It may be taken to satisfy the
basic math requirement.
Math Serves Need
Associate Department Head
Paul W. Berg said the various
introductory calculus series cur
rently offered meet an impor
tant cultural need. They provide
a basic understanding of one of
the most important discoveries
of western civilization and mod
ern man's basic tool of science.
Regarding the SES recommen
dation of a new mathematical
logic - computer course, Berg
pointed out that there already
exists a General Studies course
in mathematical logic (Philo
sophy 3).

Gilbarg remarked ,"We accept
the importance of the computer,
particularly in technology, but
this does not mean that the type
of course suggested is appro
priate for a General Studies pro
gram in which the emphasis is
on cultural foundations rather
than on technology."
Return To Parochialism
Professor F. W. Strothmann,
Executive Head of the Modern
European Languages Depart
ment, stated, "Abolition of the
foreign language requirement
entirely is foolish. This would
be a return to parochialism."
He suggested that if there is
to be any revision of the langu
age requirement, students should
be able to place out of the re
quirement by a proficiency exam,
for which they would receive
no credit toward graduation.
Students failing to pass the
test would be required to do re
medial work until they could
pass. They would not be given
credit toward graduation for
such work.
Include Composition
Strothmann added that such
a system could be extended to
include English composition. He
also expressed concern over the
SES recommendation to abolish
the math requirement.
He noted the increased impor
tance of a thorough knowledge
of calculus in the social sciences
and linguistics.
The position paper of the
Steering Committee of the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
has drawn a mixed reaction
from five campus figures.
Paul Berg and David Gilbarg,
professors of mathematics; Peter
Lyman, ASSU president; F. W.
Strothmann, professor of mod
ern European languages; and
Robert Walker, head of the Gen
eral Studies Committee, were
contacted by The Daily for com
ment.

Dr. Robert Walker, head of
the Academic Council's General
Studies Committee, supports the
goals set forth in the position
paper. He commented, "The re
port on the whole is provoca
tive and very useful. However,
the judgment on how it will
work must wait."
Among the problems which
the SES will have + o tackle to
effect their proposals Walker
cited the English composition is
sue. "SES assumes that the fac
ulty is willing and able to write
good prose. This may not al
ways be the case.
"Furthermore, many of the
faculty members do not consider
it their job to correct prose
style."
College To Hit Obstacle
Regarding the proposed ex
perimental college he indicated
one great obstacle. Departments
are unwilling to promote faculty
members who are doing much
of their work outside the depart
ment.
Such a situation led to the
failure of a similar program at
the University of Chicago.
He corrected the SES state
ment on freshman seminars by

observing that over 40 per cent
are taught not by "advanced
scholars" but by T.A.'s. He
thought that the problem in ex
pansion, therefore, lay in in
volving additional high-ranking
faculty.
Flexibility
To the statement that the Gen
eral Studies program is mono
lithic, Walker replied that he did
not find this term very descrip
tive and pointed out the flexi
bility of the program. He said
there are only two specifically
required series.
Furthermore, the maximum
number of units which a stu
dent must take in General Stu
dies and major requirements
combined is approximately 12C,
thus allowing well over a year
for the student to select his
own courses.
He remarked in relation to
the SES, "This kind of periodic
review is essential to keep Gen
eral Studies in line with our stu
dents and faculty. If the pro
gram is to be effective, however,
it must be consistent with the
primary professional and scho
larly interests of our depart
mental faculties, for these are

the centers of the university."
Peter Lyman, ASSU president,
expressed disappointment with
the report. "They've adopted
the liberal rhetoric of education
al reform but didn't get into
the fundamental questions of ed
ucational reform," he comment
ed.
He did not disagree with the
statements in the report, but he
criticized its implicit acceptance
of current assumptions and insti
tutions.
He noted, for example, that
the committee made no state
ment as to what type of teach
ers ought to be hired to instruct
undergraduates. There was no
discussion of the ideal student
faculty relationship.
Lyman also pointed out a lack
of discussion regarding class
room situations, particularly the
relative merits of lectures, semi
nars, and tutorials.
Variations On Theme
"This is typical of today's ed
ucational reform — variations
on an institutional theme," he
said. "Today students must get
an education through the non
institutional aspects of the uni
versity.

"Real education is a number
of relationships, which the SES
did not report on."
One of the major institutional
burdens, he believes, is the grad
ing system. If courses are inter
esting, students should take
them whether or not they are
required. Yet given even the
most ideal curriculum, this
would not happen.
Students Eye Grades
Students only take courses In
which they know they can do
well, Lyman maintains. Thus if
there were no grades, there
would be no need for General
Studies requirements, given an
interesting curriculum.
Regarding the proposed hon
ors programs and experimental
college — Lyman believes that
they can be worthwhile only in
light of SES investigation of
such factors as the hiring cri
teria for faculty and student
teacher relationship. A new cur
riculum is not enough, he said.
Mathematics Department Ex
ecutive Head David Gilbarg con
curred with the SES position
that "the math-or-language alter

review is essential to keep Gen
eral Studies in line with our stu
dents and faculty. If the pro
gram is to be effective, however,
it must be consistent with the
primary professional and scho
larly interests of our depart
mental faculties, for these are

the centers of the university."
Peter Lyman, ASSU president,
expressed disappointment with
the report. "They've adopted
the liberal rhetoric of education
al reform but didn't get into
the fundamental questions of ed
ucational reform," he comment
ed.
He did not disagree with the
statements in the report, but he
criticized its implicit acceptance
of current assumptions and insti
tutions.
He noted, for example, that
the committee made no state
ment as to what type of teach
ers ought to be hired to instruct
undergraduates. There was no
discussion of the ideal student
faculty relationship.
Lyman also pointed out a lack
of discussion regarding class
room situations, particularly the
relative merits of lectures, semi
nars, and tutorials.
Variations On Theme
"This is typical of today's ed
ucational reform — variations
on an institutional theme," he
said. "Today students must get
an education through the non
institutional aspects of the uni
versity.

"Real education is a number
of relationships, which the SES
did not report on."
One of the major institutional
burdens, he believes, is the grad
ing system. If courses are inter
esting, students should take
them whether or not they are
required. Yet given even the
most ideal curriculum, this
would not happen.
Students Eye Grades
Students only take courses In
which they know they can do
well, Lyman maintains. Thus if
there were no grades, there
would be no need for General
Studies requirements, given an
interesting curriculum.
Regarding the proposed hon
ors programs and experimental
college — Lyman believes that
they can be worthwhile only in
light of SES investigation of
such factors as the hiring cri

teacher relationship. A new cur

The position paper of the
Steering Committee of the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
has drawn a mixed reaction
from five campus figures.
Paul Berg and David Gilbarg,
professors of mathematics; Peter
Lyman, ASSU president; F. W.
Strothmann, professor of mod
ern European languages; and
Robert Walker, head of the Gen
eral Studies Committee, were
contacted by The Daily for com
ment.

Dr. Robert Walker, head of
the Academic Council's General
Studies Committee, supports the
goals set forth in the position
paper. He commented, "The re
port on the whole is provoca
tive and very useful. However,
the judgment on how it will
work must wait."
Among the problems which
the SES will have + o tackle to
effect their proposals Walker
cited the English composition is
sue. "SES assumes that the fac
ulty is willing and able to write
good prose. This may not al
ways be the case.
"Furthermore, many of the
faculty members do not consider
it their job to correct prose
style."
College To Hit Obstacle
Regarding the proposed ex
perimental college he indicated
one great obstacle. Departments
are unwilling to promote faculty
members who are doing much
of their work outside the depart
ment.
Such a situation led to the
failure of a similar program at
the University of Chicago.
He corrected the SES state
ment on freshman seminars by

observing that over 40 per cent
are taught not by "advanced
scholars" but by T.A.'s. He
thought that the problem in ex
pansion, therefore, lay in in
volving additional high-ranking
faculty.
Flexibility
To the statement that the Gen
eral Studies program is mono
lithic, Walker replied that he did
not find this term very descrip
tive and pointed out the flexi
bility of the program. He said
there are only two specifically
required series.
Furthermore, the maximum
number of units which a stu
dent must take in General Stu
dies and major requirements
combined is approximately 12C,
thus allowing well over a year
for the student to select his
own courses.
He remarked in relation to
the SES, "This kind of periodic

Mathematics Department Ex

curred with the SES position
that "the math-or-language alter

quirement. However, I believe
that both subjects should be
part of the General Studies pro
gram."
Keep Math, Language
He suggests, as an example,
that math be included under the
Natural Science Area Require
ment and that foreign languages
be available in the Humanities
category.
"One could ask if any natural
science is more relevant to the
needs of social science or hu
manities majors than mathema
tics," Gilbarg commented.
He pointed out. that, contrary
to the SES statement, there is
a math series (Mathematics 31-
35) designed to be of general
interest to non-science majors.
It may be taken to satisfy the
basic math requirement.
Math Serves Need
Associate Department Head
Paul W. Berg said the various
introductory calculus series cur

a basic understanding of one of
the most important discoveries
of western civilization and mod
ern man's basic tool of science.
Regarding the SES recommen
dation of a new mathematical
logic - computer course, Berg
pointed out that there already
exists a General Studies course
in mathematical logic (Philo
sophy 3).

Gilbarg remarked ,"We accept
the importance of the computer,
particularly in technology, but
this does not mean that the type
of course suggested is appro
priate for a General Studies pro
gram in which the emphasis is
on cultural foundations rather
than on technology."
Return To Parochialism
Professor F. W. Strothmann,
Executive Head of the Modern
European Languages Depart

foreign language requirement
entirely is foolish. This would
be a return to parochialism."
He suggested that if there is
to be any revision of the langu
age requirement, students should
be able to place out of the re
quirement by a proficiency exam,
for which they would receive
no credit toward graduation.
Students failing to pass the
test would be required to do re

credit toward graduation for
such work.

Strothmann added that such

tance of a thorough knowledge
of calculus in the social sciences
and linguistics.
The position paper of the
Steering Committee of the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
has drawn a mixed reaction
from five campus figures.
Paul Berg and David Gilbarg,
professors of mathematics; Peter
Lyman, ASSU president; F. W.
Strothmann, professor of mod
ern European languages; and
Robert Walker, head of the Gen
eral Studies Committee, were
contacted by The Daily for com
ment.

Dr. Robert Walker, head of
the Academic Council's General
Studies Committee, supports the
goals set forth in the position
paper. He commented, "The re
port on the whole is provoca
tive and very useful. However,
the judgment on how it will
work must wait."
Among the problems which
the SES will have + o tackle to
effect their proposals Walker
cited the English composition is
sue. "SES assumes that the fac
ulty is willing and able to write
good prose. This may not al
ways be the case.
"Furthermore, many of the
faculty members do not consider
it their job to correct prose
style."
College To Hit Obstacle
Regarding the proposed ex
perimental college he indicated
one great obstacle. Departments
are unwilling to promote faculty
members who are doing much
of their work outside the depart
ment.
Such a situation led to the
failure of a similar program at
the University of Chicago.
He corrected the SES state
ment on freshman seminars by

observing that over 40 per cent
are taught not by "advanced
scholars" but by T.A.'s. He
thought that the problem in ex
pansion, therefore, lay in in
volving additional high-ranking
faculty.
Flexibility
To the statement that the Gen
eral Studies program is mono
lithic, Walker replied that he did
not find this term very descrip
tive and pointed out the flexi
bility of the program. He said
there are only two specifically
required series.
Furthermore, the maximum
number of units which a stu
dent must take in General Stu
dies and major requirements
combined is approximately 12C,
thus allowing well over a year
for the student to select his
own courses.
He remarked in relation to
the SES, "This kind of periodic
review is essential to keep Gen
eral Studies in line with our stu
dents and faculty. If the pro
gram is to be effective, however,
it must be consistent with the
primary professional and scho
larly interests of our depart
mental faculties, for these are

the centers of the university."
Peter Lyman, ASSU president,
expressed disappointment with
the report. "They've adopted
the liberal rhetoric of education
al reform but didn't get into
the fundamental questions of ed
ucational reform," he comment
ed.
He did not disagree with the
statements in the report, but he
criticized its implicit acceptance
of current assumptions and insti
tutions.
He noted, for example, that
the committee made no state
ment as to what type of teach
ers ought to be hired to instruct
undergraduates. There was no
discussion of the ideal student
faculty relationship.
Lyman also pointed out a lack
of discussion regarding class
room situations, particularly the
relative merits of lectures, semi
nars, and tutorials.
Variations On Theme
"This is typical of today's ed
ucational reform — variations
on an institutional theme," he
said. "Today students must get
an education through the non
institutional aspects of the uni
versity.

"Real education is a number
of relationships, which the SES
did not report on."
One of the major institutional
burdens, he believes, is the grad
ing system. If courses are inter
esting, students should take
them whether or not they are
required. Yet given even the
most ideal curriculum, this
would not happen.
Students Eye Grades
Students only take courses In
which they know they can do
well, Lyman maintains. Thus if
there were no grades, there
would be no need for General
Studies requirements, given an
interesting curriculum.
Regarding the proposed hon
ors programs and experimental
college — Lyman believes that
they can be worthwhile only in
light of SES investigation of
such factors as the hiring cri
teria for faculty and student
teacher relationship. A new cur
riculum is not enough, he said.
Mathematics Department Ex
ecutive Head David Gilbarg con
curred with the SES position
that "the math-or-language alter
native is an unreasonable re-
quirement. However, I believe
that both subjects should be
part of the General Studies pro
gram."
Keep Math, Language
He suggests, as an example,
that math be included under the
Natural Science Area Require
ment and that foreign languages
be available in the Humanities
category.
"One could ask if any natural
science is more relevant to the
needs of social science or hu
manities majors than mathema
tics," Gilbarg commented.
He pointed out. that, contrary
to the SES statement, there is
a math series (Mathematics 31-
35) designed to be of general
interest to non-science majors.
It may be taken to satisfy the
basic math requirement.
Math Serves Need
Associate Department Head
Paul W. Berg said the various
introductory calculus series cur
rently offered meet an impor
tant cultural need. They provide
a basic understanding of one of
the most important discoveries
of western civilization and mod
ern man's basic tool of science.
Regarding the SES recommen
dation of a new mathematical
logic - computer course, Berg
pointed out that there already
exists a General Studies course
in mathematical logic (Philo
sophy 3).

Gilbarg remarked ,"We accept
the importance of the computer,
particularly in technology, but
this does not mean that the type
of course suggested is appro
priate for a General Studies pro
gram in which the emphasis is
on cultural foundations rather
than on technology."
Return To Parochialism
Professor F. W. Strothmann,
Executive Head of the Modern
European Languages Depart
ment, stated, "Abolition of the
foreign language requirement
entirely is foolish. This would
be a return to parochialism."
He suggested that if there is
to be any revision of the langu
age requirement, students should
be able to place out of the re
quirement by a proficiency exam,
for which they would receive
no credit toward graduation.
Students failing to pass the
test would be required to do re
medial work until they could
pass. They would not be given
credit toward graduation for
such work.
Include Composition
Strothmann added that such
a system could be extended to
include English composition. He
also expressed concern over the
SES recommendation to abolish
the math requirement.
He noted the increased impor
tance of a thorough knowledge
of calculus in the social sciences
and linguistics.
