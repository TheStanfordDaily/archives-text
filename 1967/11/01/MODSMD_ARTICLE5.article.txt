# SES Report Draws Mixed Reactions
## 
### ROBERT BRODY 
The position paper of the
Steering Committee of the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
has drawn a mixed reaction
from five campus figures.
Paul Berg and David Gilbarg,
professors of mathematics; Peter
Lyman, ASSU president; F. W.
Strothmann, professor of mod
ern European languages; and
Robert Walker, head of the Gen
eral Studies Committee, were
contacted by The Daily for com
ment.

Dr. Robert Walker, head of
the Academic Council's General
Studies Committee, supports the
goals set forth in the position
paper. He commented, "The re
port on the whole is provoca
tive and very useful. However,
the judgment on how it will
work must wait."
Among the problems which
the SES will have + o tackle to
effect their proposals Walker
cited the English composition is
sue. "SES assumes that the fac
ulty is willing and able to write
good prose. This may not al
ways be the case.
"Furthermore, many of the
faculty members do not consider
it their job to correct prose
style."
College To Hit Obstacle
Regarding the proposed ex
perimental college he indicated
one great obstacle. Departments
are unwilling to promote faculty
members who are doing much
of their work outside the depart
ment.
Such a situation led to the
failure of a similar program at
the University of Chicago.
He corrected the SES state
ment on freshman seminars by

observing that over 40 per cent
are taught not by "advanced
scholars" but by T.A.'s. He
thought that the problem in ex
pansion, therefore, lay in in
volving additional high-ranking
faculty.
Flexibility
To the statement that the Gen
eral Studies program is mono
lithic, Walker replied that he did
not find this term very descrip
tive and pointed out the flexi
bility of the program. He said
there are only two specifically
required series.
Furthermore, the maximum
number of units which a stu
dent must take in General Stu
dies and major requirements
combined is approximately 12C,
thus allowing well over a year
for the student to select his
own courses.
He remarked in relation to
the SES, "This kind of periodic
review is essential to keep Gen
eral Studies in line with our stu
dents and faculty. If the pro
gram is to be effective, however,
it must be consistent with the
primary professional and scho
larly interests of our depart
mental faculties, for these are

the centers of the university."
Peter Lyman, ASSU president,
expressed disappointment with
the report. "They've adopted
the liberal rhetoric of education
al reform but didn't get into
the fundamental questions of ed
ucational reform," he comment
ed.
He did not disagree with the
statements in the report, but he
criticized its implicit acceptance
of current assumptions and insti
tutions.
He noted, for example, that
the committee made no state
ment as to what type of teach
ers ought to be hired to instruct
undergraduates. There was no
discussion of the ideal student
faculty relationship.
Lyman also pointed out a lack
of discussion regarding class
room situations, particularly the
relative merits of lectures, semi
nars, and tutorials.
Variations On Theme
"This is typical of today's ed
ucational reform — variations
on an institutional theme," he
said. "Today students must get
an education through the non
institutional aspects of the uni
versity.

"Real education is a number
of relationships, which the SES
did not report on."
One of the major institutional
burdens, he believes, is the grad
ing system. If courses are inter
esting, students should take
them whether or not they are
required. Yet given even the
most ideal curriculum, this
would not happen.
Students Eye Grades
Students only take courses In
which they know they can do
well, Lyman maintains. Thus if
there were no grades, there
would be no need for General
Studies requirements, given an
interesting curriculum.
Regarding the proposed hon
ors programs and experimental
college — Lyman believes that
they can be worthwhile only in
light of SES investigation of
such factors as the hiring cri
teria for faculty and student
teacher relationship. A new cur
riculum is not enough, he said.
Mathematics Department Ex
ecutive Head David Gilbarg con
curred with the SES position
that "the math-or-language alter
native is an unreasonable re-
