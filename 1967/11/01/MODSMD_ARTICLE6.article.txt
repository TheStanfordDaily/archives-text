# Soto's New Loft Declared Fire Hazard
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Soto House residents call it a
loft.
Stanford Fire Chief John
Marston and Santa Clara Coun
ty Fire Marshal Chief Bruce
Wiggins call it a mezzanine.
Either way, it's illegal.
The object in question is a
structure erected by the Soto
House decoration committee in
their lounge a few weekends
ago.
It consists of a larere wooden
platform braced against a wall
and supported by several beams,
about seven feet off the floor,
with a hand-welded spiral stair
case leading up to it.
The trouble with the thing is
that it violates several state and
county fire and building laws: it
is not fireproof and there Is not
enough headroom above It.
Because of these violations,
the structure is in danger of be
ing ordered torn down. But the
people in Soto House still have
hope.
Possible Modifications
Wilbur director Joe Higgins
and Soto House faculty resident
John Chowney plan to recom
mend to the students to submit
"a proposal of modification" of
the loft so that it would meet
"with the intent of the code."
Possible changes would be to
coat the wood with fireproof
paint or impregnate it with
some other material to make it
fireproof, and to move it into
the center of the room, Higgens
said.
Moving the loft would give
the required clearance above the
structure which it presently
lacks because of the sloping ceil
ing near the wall against which
it stands.
It is impossible to make the
loft conform completely with the
code because it is made of wood.

The law calls for it to be made
of concrete and metal, because
the building itself is of Type I
construction (concrete and
steel). Since it is a dormitory,
it must be able to withstand fire
for at least three hours.
This last rule proscribes coat
ing the loft with sheet rock or
gypsum, since they can resist
fire for only two hours.
But, if the residents of Soto
"meet the intent of the code,"
Chowney and Higgins feel that
the Fire Department will allow
the loft to remain in the lounge.
"We maintain a feeling of op
timism," Higgins told the Daily,
while looking somewhat wor
ried.

The loft was the idea of Lau
rence Pickup, a member-of So
to's decoration committee. The
wood work was done four week
ends ago from 4 p.m. Friday
through 2:30 Saturday morning.
Two weeks later, they hired
an arc welder and put together
the staircase. This had to be
done in two days, because com
plaints about the noise of the
arc welder forced them to stop
work late Saturday night.
Shortly after it was finished,
William Friedrich, Business
Manager of University resi
dences, happened to be walking
through the lounge and saw the
loft for the first time. He imme
diately questioned its legality.

"I felt it was my responsibili
ty as Business Manager of resi
dences to call in the fire chief
and get his opinion," Friedrich
said.
This was the start of Soto's
troubles.
Friedrich was also disturbed
at the fact that he had not been
notified before the loft was
erected.
"All offices have to cooperate
on these things," he said. "We
could have saved a lot of trou
ble. We could have found out
for them what had to be done,
or stopped the building. Now
there's a lot of work been put
into it."
But the fate of the loft is still
up in the air.


IT'S A LOFT, IT'S A MEZZANINE . . . Whatever the structure In the lounge of Soto House is railed
it violates several state fire and building laws, and is in danger of being condemned.
