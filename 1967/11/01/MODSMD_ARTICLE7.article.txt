## Critics Blast SDS For Planned Sit-in

(Editor's Note: The Daily so
licited written opinions on the
threatened SDS action against
CIA recruiting on campus today
and tomorrow. These and others

• Baxter
Editor, The Daily:
A Daily editor has requested
that I express my view on the
justifiability of student protests
against the appearance on the
University campus of CIA re
cruiters. On the basis of student
reactions elsewhere, I assume
the question would not be
changed significantly if the
Dow Chemical Co. was substi
tuted for that of CIA.
The issue, as I understand it,
is not whether the protesters
would be justified in attempting
to persuade their fellow stu
dents, by letters, picket signs,
pamphlets, speeches or other
means stopped short of physical
interference, not to interview
the CIA. No one, so far as I am
aware, has cast doubt on the
propriety of such efforts.
The issue, rather, is the justi
fiability of demands that the Uni
versity exclude from its facilities
this particular employer and the
justifiability of the use of phy
sical interference to thwart the
interviews as a means of achiev
ing that exclusion.
If a university were to take
the position that no prospective
employer were welcome on the
campus, I do not see that any
important issue of principle
would be raised. However, to in
sist that all recruiting should
occur off-campus would, in my
view, be foolish: on-campus re
cruiting serves the convenience
of both students and prospective
employers of many types.
Assuming then, that some em
ployers are to be permitted to
conduct interviews on campus,
the questions arise: Which ones?
What are the criteria of selec
tion to be? Who is to apply
those criteria?
Tentative answers flow from
the functional justification for
permitting any interviewing and
from the organizational struc
ture of the University. Articula
tion and application of the cri
teria are ultimately the respon

sibility of the University Presi
dent, as are all institutional de
cisions: he may delegate the au
thority to make them but not
responsibility for them.
The functionally derived cri
terion is that student interest in
discussing career possibilities
with an employer is a necessary
and sufficient condition to uni
versity provision of facilities. If,
as I assume, there are some stu
dents on the campus who wish
to interview the CIA, then the
CIA falls within this tentative
criterion.
But the criterion is only ten
tative, and the student protests
raise the issue whether it should
be modified. The additional cri
terion they seek to impose, as I
understand their position, is that
an employer should be excluded,
and the wishes of those students
who wish to interview the em
ployer should be subordinated, if
the employer engages (has en
gaged?) regularly (once? sev
eral times?) in conduct which
is believed to be morally abhor
rent by some other students
(a majority of other students?
one other?).
Even if all the ambiguities are
taken as resolved in favor of its
advocates, I think the proposed
criterion is wholly unacceptable.
Whether the proposition is
viewed as one of morals or gov
ernment, it is outrageous to sug
gest that the freedom of those
students who wish to have inter
views, and whose conduct in so
doing will harm none save pos
sibly themselves, should be rou
tinely subordinated to the pref
erences of the majority.
A majority that insisted on
that proposition could fairly be
characterized as a totalitarian
mob. An institution, particularly
a university, that acceded to
such demands could fairly be
characterized as cowardly and
irresponsible.
I am particularly troubled, al
though I am no longer surpris
ed, by the fact that those from
whom the demand comes see
themselves as, or at least pos
ture as, spokesmen for indivi
dualism and humanistic values.
Either their perception or their
integrity is strikingly deficient.
I choose to believe, perhaps
with undue charity, that in the
case of most of the advocates

the failure is in perception: they
seem to have fallen prey to the
dangerous fallacy that they pos
sess a direct pipeline to their
God and therefore that their
moral judgments are indisput
ably superior to those of all
others. Historically that fallacy
mean that those who practice it
no longer believe that the uni
versity is an arena in which ra
tional debate and encounter can
take place.
The proposed sit-in also con
fuses the issue if, when the real
target is the CIA, the actual
has proved a frequent seedbed
of totalitarianism.

Motivation for the planned
violent demonstration against
placement interviews with the
CIA was set forth with admira
ble honesty and clarity by Mr.
Steven Weissmann at the prepa
ratory rally in White Plaza to
day (October 31). Free speech
and respect for the opinions of
others is irrelevant. Even the
CIA as such is not the issue; the
whole system is rotten and must
be overturned. The purpose of
the demonstration, like that of
the Tuesday demonstration in
Oakland, is to draw a large pro
portion of the population into a
revolutionary struggle.
As Mr. Weissmann and Mr.
Bogart have emphasized, the
aim is not to stop the war in
Vietnam nor to cripple the CIA;
it is rejection of the whole sys
tem in all of its parts, and any
particular occasion on which it
is possible to mobilize support
should be seized on. The funda
mental aim is not partial change
but total revolution. Since the
legitimacy of existing authority
everywhere is explicitly rejected,
I presume that one of my lec
tures would be as acceptable a
target as the CIA if only people
were interested enough to care.
I do not think that in a short
letter I can adequately summar
ize the reasons for the great tra
dition of freedom of speech and
respect for the antagonist; may
I only note that in this case the
direct victim is the fellow stu
dent who wishes to explore the

possibility of CIA employment.
Mr. Weissman has no confidence
that the truth as he sees it will
prevail. Though he was speak
ing with no noticeable police in
terference on a public address
system supplied by the Univer
sity, he explicitly stated that his
people were bound to lose in a
propaganda contest with the
State Department. Two and a
half years of what he regarded
as unsuccessful liberal struggle
has convinced him of this.
Apart from the matter of prin
ciple involved, one wonders why
a group that is unable to per
suade others to its viewpoint
will be more successful in forc
ing them. The two and a half
years of liberal struggle would,
even in his views, surely be fol
lowed by an indefinite long pe
riod of radical revolution. In the
present historical context there
can be little doubt as to the out
come of the struggle; in all prob
ability the radical threat will
shortly disappear as a signifi
cant force, but if it were to be
come important it would be the
Reagans and the John Birch So
ciety who would be the bene
ficiary.
The tradition of freedom of
speech and of intellectual in
quiry on the campus has been
invaluable to the SDS and to
other groups questioning our so
ciety. I should think they would
reflect a bit upon the conse
quences of destroying this safe
guard.

As I read about projected
plans for sit-ins against the CIA
and attempts to create situations
where those who wish to have
appointments with CIA repre
sentatives will be unable to do
so, I cannot avoid the conclusion
that we are getting our priori
ties confused.
As one who has had occasion
to practice civil disobedience, I
would suggest that it is not an
automatic panacaea for all occa
sions, that the extent of its prac
tice should be exceedingly re
strained, and that the university
campus is one of the last places
where its exercise is appropri
ate, since such exercise can only

point of challenge becomes not
the CIA but the correctness of
university procedures about off
campus representatives visiting
on campus. One need not defend
the CIA (as I certainly do not)
to believe that in a university
students have a right to be ex
posed to all points of view, par
ticularly those with which they
disagree.
For the university to ban cer
tain groups from appearing on
campus would be just as heavy
handed if exercised against the
far right, as it would be if exer
cised against the far left. And
for students to insist that the
university should act as censor
in this fashion is a curious re
version to the in loco parentis
argument which on almost every
other occasion students wish the
university to disavow.
There are vehicles of protest,
such as picketing, through
which opposition to the CIA can
be registered, which will make
the point and still not coercively
deny other students the right to
talk with off-campus representa
tives of any organization. One
does not find members of the
R.O.T.C. preventing students
from keeping their appoint
ments with the counselor for
conscientious objectors, and one
can imagine the uproar that
would properly result if they
did.
Those of us who request the
privilege of free expression
must be willing to extend that
privilege to others.

Editor, the Daily:
Stanford's SDS today demon
strates against campus recruit
ing by the CIA and last week
Oberlin students marooned a
Navy recruiter in his car for
four hours. Protests against re
cruiting by private corporations
and law firms will be the next
logical step.
These protests are manifesta
tions of a larger protest against
the failures of the American
dream and against many of its
institutions and values that
seem to be overworked, misdi
rected, or obsolete.
Some of these demonstrators
participate merely to identify
themselves with the ranks of
the alienated and thereby to dis
engage themselves from that
which they find repugnant.
Others, while finding comfort
in this detachment, believe that
they can actually effect changes
through their protests.
The protestors must under
stand that, in practical terms,
the demonstrations have the
general immediate effect of re
enforcing the average person's
belief in that which is being
protested. The minority thus be
comes even smaller as reaction
sets in.
A more viable justification,
however lies in long-run or evo
lutionary goals. Traditionally
the existence of vocal extremes
on the right and the left guides
institutions and beliefs down
some middle road. Without a
protesting left, the road would
certainly wander far right.
This justification from a long
run, evolutionary point of view
must be qualified, however, by
the same admonition brought to
bear on the short-run point of
view. In other words, the prac
tical impact of the demonstra
tions over an extended period
of time depends equally upon
the ability of the protestors to
communicate.
In order to accomplish the
desired end—that of encourag
ing a critical introspection on
the part of both Americans and
American society—the demon
strators must not reconcile
themselves to a position of rela
tive impotence by relying solely
on physical and verbal protest
from without.
They must also attempt to
work within the system—its in
stitutions and beliefs—so as to
successfully convey their ideas
to those who need to under
stand. The former without the
latter means relative ineffectu
ality.

• Baxter
Editor, The Daily:
A Daily editor has requested
that I express my view on the
justifiability of student protests
against the appearance on the
University campus of CIA re
cruiters. On the basis of student
reactions elsewhere, I assume
the question would not be
changed significantly if the
Dow Chemical Co. was substi
tuted for that of CIA.
The issue, as I understand it,
is not whether the protesters
would be justified in attempting
to persuade their fellow stu
dents, by letters, picket signs,
pamphlets, speeches or other
means stopped short of physical
interference, not to interview
the CIA. No one, so far as I am
aware, has cast doubt on the
propriety of such efforts.
The issue, rather, is the justi
fiability of demands that the Uni
versity exclude from its facilities
this particular employer and the
justifiability of the use of phy
sical interference to thwart the
interviews as a means of achiev
ing that exclusion.
If a university were to take
the position that no prospective
employer were welcome on the
campus, I do not see that any
important issue of principle
would be raised. However, to in
sist that all recruiting should
occur off-campus would, in my
view, be foolish: on-campus re
cruiting serves the convenience
of both students and prospective
employers of many types.
Assuming then, that some em
ployers are to be permitted to
conduct interviews on campus,
the questions arise: Which ones?
What are the criteria of selec
tion to be? Who is to apply
those criteria?
Tentative answers flow from
the functional justification for
permitting any interviewing and
from the organizational struc
ture of the University. Articula
tion and application of the cri
teria are ultimately the respon

sibility of the University Presi
dent, as are all institutional de
cisions: he may delegate the au
thority to make them but not
responsibility for them.
The functionally derived cri
terion is that student interest in
discussing career possibilities
with an employer is a necessary
and sufficient condition to uni
versity provision of facilities. If,
as I assume, there are some stu
dents on the campus who wish
to interview the CIA, then the
CIA falls within this tentative
criterion.
But the criterion is only ten
tative, and the student protests
raise the issue whether it should
be modified. The additional cri
terion they seek to impose, as I
understand their position, is that
an employer should be excluded,
and the wishes of those students
who wish to interview the em
ployer should be subordinated, if
the employer engages (has en
gaged?) regularly (once? sev
eral times?) in conduct which
is believed to be morally abhor
rent by some other students
(a majority of other students?
one other?).
Even if all the ambiguities are
taken as resolved in favor of its
advocates, I think the proposed
criterion is wholly unacceptable.
Whether the proposition is
viewed as one of morals or gov
ernment, it is outrageous to sug
gest that the freedom of those
students who wish to have inter
views, and whose conduct in so
doing will harm none save pos
sibly themselves, should be rou
tinely subordinated to the pref
erences of the majority.
A majority that insisted on
that proposition could fairly be
characterized as a totalitarian
mob. An institution, particularly
a university, that acceded to
such demands could fairly be
characterized as cowardly and
irresponsible.
I am particularly troubled, al
though I am no longer surpris
ed, by the fact that those from
whom the demand comes see
themselves as, or at least pos
ture as, spokesmen for indivi
dualism and humanistic values.
Either their perception or their
integrity is strikingly deficient.
I choose to believe, perhaps
with undue charity, that in the
case of most of the advocates

the failure is in perception: they
seem to have fallen prey to the
dangerous fallacy that they pos
sess a direct pipeline to their
God and therefore that their
moral judgments are indisput
ably superior to those of all
others. Historically that fallacy
mean that those who practice it
no longer believe that the uni
versity is an arena in which ra
tional debate and encounter can
take place.
The proposed sit-in also con
fuses the issue if, when the real
target is the CIA, the actual
has proved a frequent seedbed
of totalitarianism.

Editor, The Daily:
Motivation for the planned
violent demonstration against
placement interviews with the
CIA was set forth with admira
ble honesty and clarity by Mr.
Steven Weissmann at the prepa
ratory rally in White Plaza to
day (October 31). Free speech
and respect for the opinions of
others is irrelevant. Even the
CIA as such is not the issue; the
whole system is rotten and must
be overturned. The purpose of
the demonstration, like that of
the Tuesday demonstration in
Oakland, is to draw a large pro
portion of the population into a
revolutionary struggle.
As Mr. Weissmann and Mr.
Bogart have emphasized, the
aim is not to stop the war in
Vietnam nor to cripple the CIA;
it is rejection of the whole sys
tem in all of its parts, and any
particular occasion on which it
is possible to mobilize support
should be seized on. The funda
mental aim is not partial change
but total revolution. Since the
legitimacy of existing authority
everywhere is explicitly rejected,
I presume that one of my lec
tures would be as acceptable a
target as the CIA if only people
were interested enough to care.
I do not think that in a short
letter I can adequately summar
ize the reasons for the great tra
dition of freedom of speech and
respect for the antagonist; may
I only note that in this case the
direct victim is the fellow stu
dent who wishes to explore the

possibility of CIA employment.
Mr. Weissman has no confidence
that the truth as he sees it will
prevail. Though he was speak
ing with no noticeable police in
terference on a public address
system supplied by the Univer
sity, he explicitly stated that his
people were bound to lose in a
propaganda contest with the
State Department. Two and a
half years of what he regarded
as unsuccessful liberal struggle
has convinced him of this.
Apart from the matter of prin
ciple involved, one wonders why
a group that is unable to per
suade others to its viewpoint
will be more successful in forc
ing them. The two and a half
years of liberal struggle would,
even in his views, surely be fol
lowed by an indefinite long pe
riod of radical revolution. In the
present historical context there
can be little doubt as to the out
come of the struggle; in all prob
ability the radical threat will
shortly disappear as a signifi
cant force, but if it were to be
come important it would be the
Reagans and the John Birch So
ciety who would be the bene
ficiary.
The tradition of freedom of
speech and of intellectual in
quiry on the campus has been
invaluable to the SDS and to
other groups questioning our so
ciety. I should think they would
reflect a bit upon the conse
quences of destroying this safe
guard.

As I read about projected
plans for sit-ins against the CIA
and attempts to create situations
where those who wish to have
appointments with CIA repre
sentatives will be unable to do
so, I cannot avoid the conclusion
that we are getting our priori
ties confused.
As one who has had occasion
to practice civil disobedience, I
would suggest that it is not an

sions, that the extent of its prac
tice should be exceedingly re
strained, and that the university
campus is one of the last places

Motivation for the planned
violent demonstration against
placement interviews with the
CIA was set forth with admira
ble honesty and clarity by Mr.
Steven Weissmann at the prepa
ratory rally in White Plaza to
day (October 31). Free speech
and respect for the opinions of
others is irrelevant. Even the
CIA as such is not the issue; the
whole system is rotten and must
be overturned. The purpose of
the demonstration, like that of
the Tuesday demonstration in
Oakland, is to draw a large pro
portion of the population into a
revolutionary struggle.
As Mr. Weissmann and Mr.
Bogart have emphasized, the
aim is not to stop the war in
Vietnam nor to cripple the CIA;
it is rejection of the whole sys
tem in all of its parts, and any
particular occasion on which it
is possible to mobilize support
should be seized on. The funda
mental aim is not partial change
but total revolution. Since the
legitimacy of existing authority
everywhere is explicitly rejected,
I presume that one of my lec
tures would be as acceptable a
target as the CIA if only people
were interested enough to care.
I do not think that in a short
letter I can adequately summar
ize the reasons for the great tra
dition of freedom of speech and
respect for the antagonist; may
I only note that in this case the
direct victim is the fellow stu
dent who wishes to explore the

possibility of CIA employment.
Mr. Weissman has no confidence
that the truth as he sees it will
prevail. Though he was speak
ing with no noticeable police in
terference on a public address
system supplied by the Univer
sity, he explicitly stated that his
people were bound to lose in a
propaganda contest with the
State Department. Two and a
half years of what he regarded
as unsuccessful liberal struggle
has convinced him of this.
Apart from the matter of prin
ciple involved, one wonders why
a group that is unable to per
suade others to its viewpoint
will be more successful in forc
ing them. The two and a half
years of liberal struggle would,
even in his views, surely be fol
lowed by an indefinite long pe
riod of radical revolution. In the
present historical context there
can be little doubt as to the out
come of the struggle; in all prob
ability the radical threat will
shortly disappear as a signifi
cant force, but if it were to be
come important it would be the
Reagans and the John Birch So
ciety who would be the bene
ficiary.
The tradition of freedom of
speech and of intellectual in
quiry on the campus has been
invaluable to the SDS and to
other groups questioning our so
ciety. I should think they would
reflect a bit upon the conse
quences of destroying this safe

As one who has had occasion

• Baxter
Editor, The Daily:
A Daily editor has requested
that I express my view on the
justifiability of student protests
against the appearance on the
University campus of CIA re
cruiters. On the basis of student
reactions elsewhere, I assume
the question would not be
changed significantly if the
Dow Chemical Co. was substi
tuted for that of CIA.
The issue, as I understand it,
is not whether the protesters
would be justified in attempting
to persuade their fellow stu
dents, by letters, picket signs,
pamphlets, speeches or other
means stopped short of physical
interference, not to interview
the CIA. No one, so far as I am
aware, has cast doubt on the
propriety of such efforts.
The issue, rather, is the justi
fiability of demands that the Uni
versity exclude from its facilities
this particular employer and the
justifiability of the use of phy
sical interference to thwart the
interviews as a means of achiev
ing that exclusion.
If a university were to take
the position that no prospective
employer were welcome on the
campus, I do not see that any
important issue of principle
would be raised. However, to in
sist that all recruiting should
occur off-campus would, in my
view, be foolish: on-campus re
cruiting serves the convenience
of both students and prospective
employers of many types.
Assuming then, that some em
ployers are to be permitted to
conduct interviews on campus,
the questions arise: Which ones?
What are the criteria of selec
tion to be? Who is to apply
those criteria?
Tentative answers flow from
the functional justification for
permitting any interviewing and
from the organizational struc
ture of the University. Articula
tion and application of the cri
teria are ultimately the respon

sibility of the University Presi
dent, as are all institutional de
cisions: he may delegate the au
thority to make them but not
responsibility for them.
The functionally derived cri
terion is that student interest in
discussing career possibilities
with an employer is a necessary
and sufficient condition to uni
versity provision of facilities. If,
as I assume, there are some stu
dents on the campus who wish
to interview the CIA, then the
CIA falls within this tentative
criterion.
But the criterion is only ten
tative, and the student protests
raise the issue whether it should
be modified. The additional cri
terion they seek to impose, as I
understand their position, is that
an employer should be excluded,
and the wishes of those students
who wish to interview the em
ployer should be subordinated, if
the employer engages (has en
gaged?) regularly (once? sev
eral times?) in conduct which
is believed to be morally abhor
rent by some other students
(a majority of other students?
one other?).
Even if all the ambiguities are
taken as resolved in favor of its
advocates, I think the proposed
criterion is wholly unacceptable.
Whether the proposition is
viewed as one of morals or gov
ernment, it is outrageous to sug
gest that the freedom of those
students who wish to have inter
views, and whose conduct in so
doing will harm none save pos
sibly themselves, should be rou
tinely subordinated to the pref
erences of the majority.
A majority that insisted on
that proposition could fairly be
characterized as a totalitarian
mob. An institution, particularly
a university, that acceded to
such demands could fairly be
characterized as cowardly and
irresponsible.
I am particularly troubled, al
though I am no longer surpris
ed, by the fact that those from
whom the demand comes see
themselves as, or at least pos
ture as, spokesmen for indivi
dualism and humanistic values.
Either their perception or their
integrity is strikingly deficient.
I choose to believe, perhaps
with undue charity, that in the
case of most of the advocates

the failure is in perception: they
seem to have fallen prey to the
dangerous fallacy that they pos
sess a direct pipeline to their
God and therefore that their
moral judgments are indisput
ably superior to those of all
others. Historically that fallacy
mean that those who practice it
no longer believe that the uni
versity is an arena in which ra
tional debate and encounter can
take place.
The proposed sit-in also con
fuses the issue if, when the real
target is the CIA, the actual
has proved a frequent seedbed
of totalitarianism.

sical interference to thwart the
interviews as a means of achiev
ing that exclusion.
If a university were to take
the position that no prospective
employer were welcome on the
campus, I do not see that any
important issue of principle
would be raised. However, to in
sist that all recruiting should
occur off-campus would, in my
view, be foolish: on-campus re
cruiting serves the convenience
of both students and prospective
employers of many types.
Assuming then, that some em
ployers are to be permitted to
conduct interviews on campus,
the questions arise: Which ones?
What are the criteria of selec
tion to be? Who is to apply
those criteria?
Tentative answers flow from
the functional justification for
permitting any interviewing and
from the organizational struc
ture of the University. Articula
tion and application of the cri
teria are ultimately the respon

sibility of the University Presi
dent, as are all institutional de
cisions: he may delegate the au
thority to make them but not
responsibility for them.
The functionally derived cri
terion is that student interest in
discussing career possibilities
with an employer is a necessary
and sufficient condition to uni
versity provision of facilities. If,
as I assume, there are some stu
dents on the campus who wish
to interview the CIA, then the
CIA falls within this tentative
criterion.
But the criterion is only ten
tative, and the student protests
raise the issue whether it should
be modified. The additional cri
terion they seek to impose, as I
understand their position, is that
an employer should be excluded,
and the wishes of those students
who wish to interview the em
ployer should be subordinated, if
the employer engages (has en
gaged?) regularly (once? sev
eral times?) in conduct which
is believed to be morally abhor
rent by some other students
(a majority of other students?
one other?).
Even if all the ambiguities are
taken as resolved in favor of its
advocates, I think the proposed
criterion is wholly unacceptable.
Whether the proposition is
viewed as one of morals or gov
ernment, it is outrageous to sug
gest that the freedom of those
students who wish to have inter
views, and whose conduct in so
doing will harm none save pos
sibly themselves, should be rou
tinely subordinated to the pref
erences of the majority.
A majority that insisted on
that proposition could fairly be
characterized as a totalitarian
mob. An institution, particularly
a university, that acceded to
such demands could fairly be
characterized as cowardly and
irresponsible.
I am particularly troubled, al
though I am no longer surpris
ed, by the fact that those from
whom the demand comes see
themselves as, or at least pos
ture as, spokesmen for indivi
dualism and humanistic values.
Either their perception or their
integrity is strikingly deficient.
I choose to believe, perhaps
with undue charity, that in the
case of most of the advocates

the failure is in perception: they
seem to have fallen prey to the
dangerous fallacy that they pos
sess a direct pipeline to their
God and therefore that their
moral judgments are indisput
ably superior to those of all
others. Historically that fallacy
mean that those who practice it
no longer believe that the uni
versity is an arena in which ra
tional debate and encounter can
take place.
The proposed sit-in also con
fuses the issue if, when the real

has proved a frequent seedbed

Motivation for the planned
violent demonstration against
placement interviews with the
CIA was set forth with admira
ble honesty and clarity by Mr.
Steven Weissmann at the prepa
ratory rally in White Plaza to
day (October 31). Free speech
and respect for the opinions of
others is irrelevant. Even the
CIA as such is not the issue; the
whole system is rotten and must
be overturned. The purpose of
the demonstration, like that of
the Tuesday demonstration in
Oakland, is to draw a large pro
portion of the population into a
revolutionary struggle.
As Mr. Weissmann and Mr.

aim is not to stop the war in
Vietnam nor to cripple the CIA;
it is rejection of the whole sys

particular occasion on which it
is possible to mobilize support
should be seized on. The funda
mental aim is not partial change
but total revolution. Since the
legitimacy of existing authority
everywhere is explicitly rejected,
I presume that one of my lec

were interested enough to care.
I do not think that in a short

I only note that in this case the

Mr. Weissman has no confidence
that the truth as he sees it will

system supplied by the Univer

people were bound to lose in a
propaganda contest with the
State Department. Two and a
half years of what he regarded
as unsuccessful liberal struggle
has convinced him of this.
Apart from the matter of prin

a group that is unable to per
suade others to its viewpoint
will be more successful in forc
ing them. The two and a half
years of liberal struggle would,
even in his views, surely be fol

present historical context there
can be little doubt as to the out
come of the struggle; in all prob
ability the radical threat will
shortly disappear as a signifi

ficiary.
The tradition of freedom of

Editor, the Daily:
Stanford's SDS today demon
strates against campus recruit
ing by the CIA and last week
Oberlin students marooned a
Navy recruiter in his car for
four hours. Protests against re
cruiting by private corporations
and law firms will be the next
logical step.
These protests are manifesta
tions of a larger protest against
the failures of the American
dream and against many of its
institutions and values that
seem to be overworked, misdi
rected, or obsolete.
Some of these demonstrators
participate merely to identify
themselves with the ranks of
the alienated and thereby to dis
engage themselves from that
which they find repugnant.
Others, while finding comfort
in this detachment, believe that
they can actually effect changes
through their protests.
The protestors must under
stand that, in practical terms,
the demonstrations have the
general immediate effect of re
enforcing the average person's
belief in that which is being
protested. The minority thus be
comes even smaller as reaction
sets in.
A more viable justification,
however lies in long-run or evo
lutionary goals. Traditionally
the existence of vocal extremes
on the right and the left guides
institutions and beliefs down
some middle road. Without a
protesting left, the road would
certainly wander far right.
This justification from a long
run, evolutionary point of view
must be qualified, however, by
the same admonition brought to
bear on the short-run point of
view. In other words, the prac
tical impact of the demonstra
tions over an extended period
of time depends equally upon
the ability of the protestors to
communicate.
In order to accomplish the
desired end—that of encourag
ing a critical introspection on
the part of both Americans and
American society—the demon
strators must not reconcile
themselves to a position of rela
tive impotence by relying solely
on physical and verbal protest
from without.
They must also attempt to
work within the system—its in
stitutions and beliefs—so as to
successfully convey their ideas
to those who need to under
stand. The former without the
latter means relative ineffectu
ality.

• Baxter
Editor, The Daily:
A Daily editor has requested
that I express my view on the
justifiability of student protests
against the appearance on the
University campus of CIA re
cruiters. On the basis of student
reactions elsewhere, I assume
the question would not be
changed significantly if the
Dow Chemical Co. was substi
tuted for that of CIA.
The issue, as I understand it,
is not whether the protesters
would be justified in attempting
to persuade their fellow stu
dents, by letters, picket signs,
pamphlets, speeches or other
means stopped short of physical
interference, not to interview
the CIA. No one, so far as I am
aware, has cast doubt on the
propriety of such efforts.
The issue, rather, is the justi
fiability of demands that the Uni
versity exclude from its facilities
this particular employer and the
justifiability of the use of phy
sical interference to thwart the
interviews as a means of achiev
ing that exclusion.
If a university were to take
the position that no prospective
employer were welcome on the
campus, I do not see that any

• Baxter
Editor, The Daily:
A Daily editor has requested
that I express my view on the
justifiability of student protests
against the appearance on the
University campus of CIA re
cruiters. On the basis of student
reactions elsewhere, I assume
the question would not be
changed significantly if the
Dow Chemical Co. was substi
tuted for that of CIA.
The issue, as I understand it,
is not whether the protesters
would be justified in attempting
to persuade their fellow stu
dents, by letters, picket signs,
pamphlets, speeches or other
means stopped short of physical
interference, not to interview
the CIA. No one, so far as I am
aware, has cast doubt on the
propriety of such efforts.
The issue, rather, is the justi
fiability of demands that the Uni
versity exclude from its facilities
this particular employer and the
justifiability of the use of phy
sical interference to thwart the
interviews as a means of achiev
ing that exclusion.
If a university were to take
the position that no prospective
employer were welcome on the
campus, I do not see that any
important issue of principle
would be raised. However, to in
sist that all recruiting should
occur off-campus would, in my
view, be foolish: on-campus re
cruiting serves the convenience
of both students and prospective
employers of many types.
Assuming then, that some em
ployers are to be permitted to
conduct interviews on campus,
the questions arise: Which ones?
What are the criteria of selec
tion to be? Who is to apply
those criteria?
Tentative answers flow from
the functional justification for
permitting any interviewing and
from the organizational struc
ture of the University. Articula
tion and application of the cri
teria are ultimately the respon

sibility of the University Presi
dent, as are all institutional de
cisions: he may delegate the au
thority to make them but not
responsibility for them.
The functionally derived cri
terion is that student interest in
discussing career possibilities
with an employer is a necessary
and sufficient condition to uni
versity provision of facilities. If,
as I assume, there are some stu
dents on the campus who wish
to interview the CIA, then the
CIA falls within this tentative
criterion.
But the criterion is only ten
tative, and the student protests
raise the issue whether it should
be modified. The additional cri
terion they seek to impose, as I
understand their position, is that
an employer should be excluded,
and the wishes of those students
who wish to interview the em
ployer should be subordinated, if
the employer engages (has en
gaged?) regularly (once? sev
eral times?) in conduct which
is believed to be morally abhor
rent by some other students
(a majority of other students?
one other?).
Even if all the ambiguities are
taken as resolved in favor of its
advocates, I think the proposed
criterion is wholly unacceptable.
Whether the proposition is
viewed as one of morals or gov
ernment, it is outrageous to sug
gest that the freedom of those
students who wish to have inter
views, and whose conduct in so
doing will harm none save pos
sibly themselves, should be rou
tinely subordinated to the pref
erences of the majority.
A majority that insisted on
that proposition could fairly be
characterized as a totalitarian
mob. An institution, particularly
a university, that acceded to
such demands could fairly be
characterized as cowardly and
irresponsible.
I am particularly troubled, al
though I am no longer surpris
ed, by the fact that those from
whom the demand comes see
themselves as, or at least pos
ture as, spokesmen for indivi
dualism and humanistic values.
Either their perception or their
integrity is strikingly deficient.
I choose to believe, perhaps
with undue charity, that in the
case of most of the advocates

the failure is in perception: they
seem to have fallen prey to the
dangerous fallacy that they pos
sess a direct pipeline to their
God and therefore that their
moral judgments are indisput
ably superior to those of all
others. Historically that fallacy
mean that those who practice it
no longer believe that the uni
versity is an arena in which ra
tional debate and encounter can
take place.
The proposed sit-in also con
fuses the issue if, when the real
target is the CIA, the actual
has proved a frequent seedbed
of totalitarianism.

Motivation for the planned
violent demonstration against
placement interviews with the
CIA was set forth with admira
ble honesty and clarity by Mr.
Steven Weissmann at the prepa
ratory rally in White Plaza to
day (October 31). Free speech
and respect for the opinions of
others is irrelevant. Even the
CIA as such is not the issue; the
whole system is rotten and must
be overturned. The purpose of
the demonstration, like that of
the Tuesday demonstration in
Oakland, is to draw a large pro
portion of the population into a
revolutionary struggle.
As Mr. Weissmann and Mr.
Bogart have emphasized, the
aim is not to stop the war in
Vietnam nor to cripple the CIA;
it is rejection of the whole sys
tem in all of its parts, and any
particular occasion on which it
is possible to mobilize support
should be seized on. The funda
mental aim is not partial change
but total revolution. Since the
legitimacy of existing authority
everywhere is explicitly rejected,
I presume that one of my lec
tures would be as acceptable a
target as the CIA if only people
were interested enough to care.
I do not think that in a short
letter I can adequately summar
ize the reasons for the great tra
dition of freedom of speech and
respect for the antagonist; may
I only note that in this case the
direct victim is the fellow stu
dent who wishes to explore the

possibility of CIA employment.
Mr. Weissman has no confidence
that the truth as he sees it will
prevail. Though he was speak
ing with no noticeable police in
terference on a public address
system supplied by the Univer
sity, he explicitly stated that his
people were bound to lose in a
propaganda contest with the
State Department. Two and a
half years of what he regarded
as unsuccessful liberal struggle
has convinced him of this.
Apart from the matter of prin
ciple involved, one wonders why
a group that is unable to per
suade others to its viewpoint
will be more successful in forc
ing them. The two and a half
years of liberal struggle would,
even in his views, surely be fol
lowed by an indefinite long pe
riod of radical revolution. In the
present historical context there
can be little doubt as to the out
come of the struggle; in all prob
ability the radical threat will
shortly disappear as a signifi
cant force, but if it were to be
come important it would be the
Reagans and the John Birch So
ciety who would be the bene
ficiary.
The tradition of freedom of
speech and of intellectual in
quiry on the campus has been
invaluable to the SDS and to
other groups questioning our so
ciety. I should think they would
reflect a bit upon the conse
quences of destroying this safe
guard.

As I read about projected
plans for sit-ins against the CIA
and attempts to create situations
where those who wish to have
appointments with CIA repre
sentatives will be unable to do
so, I cannot avoid the conclusion
that we are getting our priori
ties confused.
As one who has had occasion
to practice civil disobedience, I
would suggest that it is not an
automatic panacaea for all occa
sions, that the extent of its prac
tice should be exceedingly re
strained, and that the university
campus is one of the last places
where its exercise is appropri
ate, since such exercise can only

point of challenge becomes not
the CIA but the correctness of
university procedures about off
campus representatives visiting
on campus. One need not defend
the CIA (as I certainly do not)
to believe that in a university
students have a right to be ex
posed to all points of view, par
ticularly those with which they
disagree.
For the university to ban cer
tain groups from appearing on
campus would be just as heavy
handed if exercised against the
far right, as it would be if exer
cised against the far left. And
for students to insist that the
university should act as censor
in this fashion is a curious re
version to the in loco parentis
argument which on almost every
other occasion students wish the
university to disavow.
There are vehicles of protest,
such as picketing, through
which opposition to the CIA can
be registered, which will make
the point and still not coercively
deny other students the right to
talk with off-campus representa
tives of any organization. One
does not find members of the
R.O.T.C. preventing students
from keeping their appoint
ments with the counselor for
conscientious objectors, and one
can imagine the uproar that
would properly result if they
did.

(Editor's Note: The Daily so
licited written opinions on the
threatened SDS action against
CIA recruiting on campus today
and tomorrow. These and others
that have been submitted to the
Daily are included below.)
• Baxter
Editor, The Daily:
A Daily editor has requested
that I express my view on the
justifiability of student protests
against the appearance on the
University campus of CIA re
cruiters. On the basis of student
reactions elsewhere, I assume
the question would not be
changed significantly if the
Dow Chemical Co. was substi
tuted for that of CIA.
The issue, as I understand it,
is not whether the protesters
would be justified in attempting
to persuade their fellow stu
dents, by letters, picket signs,
pamphlets, speeches or other
means stopped short of physical
interference, not to interview
the CIA. No one, so far as I am
aware, has cast doubt on the
propriety of such efforts.
The issue, rather, is the justi
fiability of demands that the Uni
versity exclude from its facilities
this particular employer and the
justifiability of the use of phy
sical interference to thwart the
interviews as a means of achiev
ing that exclusion.
If a university were to take
the position that no prospective
employer were welcome on the
campus, I do not see that any
important issue of principle
would be raised. However, to in
sist that all recruiting should
occur off-campus would, in my
view, be foolish: on-campus re
cruiting serves the convenience
of both students and prospective
employers of many types.
Assuming then, that some em
ployers are to be permitted to
conduct interviews on campus,
the questions arise: Which ones?
What are the criteria of selec
tion to be? Who is to apply
those criteria?
Tentative answers flow from
the functional justification for
permitting any interviewing and
from the organizational struc
ture of the University. Articula
tion and application of the cri
teria are ultimately the respon

sibility of the University Presi
dent, as are all institutional de
cisions: he may delegate the au
thority to make them but not
responsibility for them.
The functionally derived cri
terion is that student interest in
discussing career possibilities
with an employer is a necessary
and sufficient condition to uni
versity provision of facilities. If,
as I assume, there are some stu
dents on the campus who wish
to interview the CIA, then the
CIA falls within this tentative
criterion.
But the criterion is only ten
tative, and the student protests
raise the issue whether it should
be modified. The additional cri
terion they seek to impose, as I
understand their position, is that
an employer should be excluded,
and the wishes of those students
who wish to interview the em
ployer should be subordinated, if
the employer engages (has en
gaged?) regularly (once? sev
eral times?) in conduct which
is believed to be morally abhor
rent by some other students
(a majority of other students?
one other?).
Even if all the ambiguities are
taken as resolved in favor of its
advocates, I think the proposed
criterion is wholly unacceptable.
Whether the proposition is
viewed as one of morals or gov
ernment, it is outrageous to sug
gest that the freedom of those
students who wish to have inter
views, and whose conduct in so
doing will harm none save pos
sibly themselves, should be rou
tinely subordinated to the pref
erences of the majority.
A majority that insisted on
that proposition could fairly be
characterized as a totalitarian
mob. An institution, particularly
a university, that acceded to
such demands could fairly be
characterized as cowardly and
irresponsible.
I am particularly troubled, al
though I am no longer surpris
ed, by the fact that those from
whom the demand comes see
themselves as, or at least pos
ture as, spokesmen for indivi
dualism and humanistic values.
Either their perception or their
integrity is strikingly deficient.
I choose to believe, perhaps
with undue charity, that in the
case of most of the advocates

the failure is in perception: they
seem to have fallen prey to the
dangerous fallacy that they pos
sess a direct pipeline to their
God and therefore that their
moral judgments are indisput
ably superior to those of all
others. Historically that fallacy
mean that those who practice it
no longer believe that the uni
versity is an arena in which ra
tional debate and encounter can
take place.
The proposed sit-in also con
fuses the issue if, when the real
target is the CIA, the actual
has proved a frequent seedbed
of totalitarianism.

Editor, The Daily:
Motivation for the planned
violent demonstration against
placement interviews with the
CIA was set forth with admira
ble honesty and clarity by Mr.
Steven Weissmann at the prepa
ratory rally in White Plaza to
day (October 31). Free speech
and respect for the opinions of
others is irrelevant. Even the
CIA as such is not the issue; the
whole system is rotten and must
be overturned. The purpose of
the demonstration, like that of
the Tuesday demonstration in
Oakland, is to draw a large pro
portion of the population into a
revolutionary struggle.
As Mr. Weissmann and Mr.
Bogart have emphasized, the
aim is not to stop the war in
Vietnam nor to cripple the CIA;
it is rejection of the whole sys
tem in all of its parts, and any
particular occasion on which it
is possible to mobilize support
should be seized on. The funda
mental aim is not partial change
but total revolution. Since the
legitimacy of existing authority
everywhere is explicitly rejected,
I presume that one of my lec
tures would be as acceptable a
target as the CIA if only people
were interested enough to care.
I do not think that in a short
letter I can adequately summar
ize the reasons for the great tra
dition of freedom of speech and
respect for the antagonist; may
I only note that in this case the
direct victim is the fellow stu
dent who wishes to explore the

possibility of CIA employment.
