# The Outpost
## Pilot Project: New Education 
### Louis Knowles 
The UCM-Community House
project is a first, small-scale at
tempt at utilizing academic
credit for off-campus action
analysis education. Its experi
ences so far are instructive of
what a larger program would
need to be successful.
The program rests on three
institutional supports that
bridge the gap between Stan
ford and the mid-peninsula area.
The Political Science Depart
ment provides the credit and the
academic adviser. UCM publi
cizes the program and recruits
students as well as marshaling
financial resources.
Community House supplies
the vital "in" to the city that
gives at least partial legitimacy
to the group in the eyes of other
organizations and the populace
as well as providing channels
for action.
Department Ties
This supportive bridge run
ning from a Stanford depart
ment through an intermediate
to a local center of ferment rep

resents an important pattern
that could be copied in other
instances.
It demands close cooperation
between faculty, students, and
organizers which is not always
easy to obtain. But it also leaves
the group in a position without
total dependence on any one
structure and so it can steer
a relatively free course once it
is established.
The majority of the partici
pants live together in a house.
Three units of credit are taken
as directed reading in Political
Science by the students who at
tend a weekly gathering that
combines elements of a seminar,
a political campaign strategy
meeting, and a community in
formation exchange.
Debates
Here ideology and tactics are
debated with the assistance of
Prof. Ken Prewitt, the Rev. Lane
Barton, and community orga
nizer, Peter Ware. Although dif
ferences exist among the mem
bers, the sense of corporate de

cision-making hammered out in
intensive sessions encourages
unanimous support of action
strategy once it is adopted.
The group decided to concen
trate its efforts on educating the
white community to the need
for radical change in the power
structure. The issues used for
this purpose are local ones upon
which people can work at the
level of town-hall democracy.
Change is possible, and the in
fluence of small pressure groups
and direct votes gives a sense
of accomplishment and impact
that builds a vigorous move
ment.
At the same time for students
with a desire to shake the en
tire nation it is slow and frus
trating work for small gain.
But the experience gives them a
strong awareness of the great
apathy barrier and the strength
of the American middle class.
In the mid-peninsula area the
subject of Black Power has
come to the fore as a primary
local issue. The Community

House project is now working
with white high school students
to propogate an understanding
of black demands and of ghetto
conditions that produce the un
rest.
A study of oppressed people
just across the freeway can lead
easily to a discussion of the gen
eral authoritarianism of school
administrations and the irrelev
ance of so much of the standard
curriculum. Parallel structures
in the black community such as
freedom schools can serve as
models for similar organizations
in the white community if suf
ficient discontent is aroused.
Much time is spent at tedious,
mechanical tasks. The three
units of credit are not enough
to cover all the hours spent in
meetings, at typewriters, and
working through relevant lit
erature. An arrangement that
would free participants from
university commitments for
most of the work week would
greatly increase the efficiency of
the group. But this situation
can only be created by univers
ity action along lines suggested
by Dwight Clark and, more rec
ently, Bruce Campbell.
The Community House pro
ject will mean nothing unless it
stimulates the exodus of similar
groups from Stanford and other
universities. Students interested
in a radical education for the
rigorous years of social crisis
ahead must band together to
initiate such programs with the
help of existing structures.
