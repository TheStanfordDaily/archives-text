Business takes a new look at the issues
1 - Mr. Ralph Kimball September 20,1967
Stanford University

Palo Alto, California
Dear Mr. Kimball:
During the preceding school year, I gained insight into campus attitudes toward business by
exchanging views with seven erudite and articulate undergraduates. They were.
Mark A. Belnick, Cornell University; James T. Hill. Harvard University; Robert Byman,
University of Illinois; Edward A. Kokalas and Steven Stelmach, Michigan State University,
H. Thomas Fehn, University of Southern California; Larry W. Warner, University of Texas.
This letter-exchange was designed to bring into the open certain negative opinions concerning
business. It provided me with an opportunity to respond with thoughts to back up my conviction
that business most certainly contributes to society ... that it offers rewarding, exciting, and
honorable careers, as do teaching, the professions, and other worthwhile vocations.
In the discussions it was not my desire to persuade students away from some other worthy
career pursuit in favor of a career in business. I say, choose the career for which you are best
suited, but make your selection on the basis of factual information.
Questions to me, my answers, and our subsequent dialogue, were published throughout the
school year in college newspapers. The exchange stimulated a flow of correspondence from
other college students, faculty members, businessmen, and parents. New questions were
raised. Added emphasis was given to issues discussed in the published Dialogue.
The significance of this year-long Dialogue is difficult to assess. I have no precise indication \
that attitudes on campus toward business have generally modified. But interest in the program V Jg
suggests that paths for the free-flow of communication between the corporation and the campus \
are a necessity. It is only through mutual understanding that business will attract a sufficient \
number of creative, potentially capable young men who are to become tomorrow's leaders. \ - M
Let me emphasize "paths" of communication—these exchanges between college students \ |<|
and myself are by no means the only way. The Dialogue program is one positive movement \ 11
toward a dual objective—the exchange of ideas and views, (1) to generate mutual understanding \ - m
and respect between campus and business, and (2) to build empathy between those in the \
professions and other vocations and those who choose business as a career. \
The correspondence implied to me that the inadequate two-way communication up to now \
has resulted in certain misleading impressions of the business world. It indicated also, that some Va
of the negative attitudes are based on existing imperfections in modern business.
There is no denyina imperfections in business. Corporations are run by people, and of course, 7m
people are subject to errors in judgment. It is my sincere hope that by examining student Jk
viewpoints, we will find ways for business to make itself more attractive as a meaningful career.
I hope also' that bright young college students will view some of the imperfect areas as
challenges they may tackle from the inside as they pursue careers in business.
Last year's Dialogists expressed such opinions as: V-
/T\ "The distinguishing mark of the businessman is sameness."
/ W "Corporations strangle talent with organizational inertia, hobble ambition with
I bureaucratic lethargy." |||
V * j "Ambition decays into dependence upon seniority."
"Competence becomes clouded by boredom."
0 "Business makes few worthwhile contributions to society."
Are you willing to take up the exchange of views where the other students and I left off last
year? If you are. let's discuss the pros and cons of business on the open platform of your
campus newspaper. I'd like to know your thinking and that of your contemporaries. Do
you regard business as stimulating, satisfying, rewarding? Or stultifying and unexciting?
May I have your views, on the level? I|
Sincerely, ' . *|112

ROUND TWO . . . "Don't sell business short," says Robert W. Galvin, Chairman of
Motorola fnc. After a unique year-long exchange of viewpoints with students at six colleges
voicing campus attitudes toward business in general, Galvin contends that business can truly offer
fulfilling, meaningful careers to the better college graduates. Business—he wrote—is not entirely
self.aeekina. It contributes substantially to modern society; it is mainstream in American life. It Is not dull, de
humanizina or solefy profit motivated, as many believe. D The students' letters expressing their questions and
views Regarding business, and Mr. Galvin's replies, were published in 29 campus newspapers. It is with the hope of
ikV increasing the understanding and mutual respect between campus and businessmen, as well as among the professions,
government, and business, that Mr. Galvin engages in this second year of campus dialogue which he calls Round Two.
