# YR Resolution
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following resolution was unanmiously passed
last night by the executive board of the Stanford Young Repub
licans.)
Whereas: The right of all individuals and groups to express their
views is an inherent part of any free academic institution, and
Whereas: The maintenance of this requires the mutual respect of
one individual for another, and of one institution for another, and
Whereas: The actions of a number of Stanford students in attempt
ing to prevent other Stanford students from being interviewed by
the Central Intelligence Agency is a blatant violation of the civil
rights of the government and those being interviewed:
Be it Therefore Resolved: That the Stanford Area Young Republi
cans condemn those who use physical force in implementing their
disagreement with the CIA recruiters presently on campus, and
be it
Further Resolved: That the SAYR's call on the Administration of the
University to protect the free exchange of views and opinions on
campus through disciplinary action against those who would
disrupt this exchange in a physical way.
