# The 						Capitol Scene
## Letter From A War-torn Land 
### Art Buchwald 
16 Avenue Hoche
Paris, France
My Dear Pierre,
Forgive me for not writing
sooner, but as you know there
is a war going on in the United
States and I have been in my
fallout shelter for several
months.
Without giving away secrets,
here is the military situation in
the United States at the moment.
The Pentagon is still in the
hands of the government. An as
sault last weekend by members
of the 51st Light Peace Brigade,
known as the Fighting Doves,
supported by the 33rd Flower
Battalion, failed and was re
pulsed by members of the 82nd
Airborne Division of the U.S.
Army. There was heavy fighting
in the north parking lot, and sui
cide units of the SDS (Students
for a Democratic Society) man
aged to get to the steps of the

building before they were turn
ed back.
Gen. Mailer Captured
Gen. Norman Mailer of the
22nd Heavy Obscenity Corps
was captured as were 600 other
Militant Peace Commandos.
The attack started with a bar
rage of curse words followed by
an assault across the demilitariz
ed zone with clubs, pop bottles
and tomatoes.
In fierce hand-to-hand combat
the loyal government troops
held their ground, and by eve
ning Army spokesmen were able
to announce that the Pentagon
was safe, at least for the mo
ment.
Government Victory
But while it turned out to be
a military victory for the gov
ernment, neutral observers here
believe that President Johnson's
pacification program in the
United States is failing.

In order to win the war in
the United States, Mr. Johnson
has to win the hearts and minds
of the American people. This he
is failing to do, and there is con
siderable speculation that his
regime may be overthrown by
November, 1968.
Tremendous Support
While the President still has
support in Washington, D.C.,
(his wife, Sen. Everett Dirksen,
and his future son-in-law) it's
very hard to find it in the coun
tryside. There has been fighting
in Madison, Wis., Boston, Mass.,
Oakland, Calif., and Brooklyn,
N.Y.
The military is dissatisfied
with the civilian control of the
situation and would like to wipe
out the peace resisters once and
for all. They want to bomb Har
vard, Yale, the University of
Michigan, the University of Wis
consin and the University of
California at Berkeley, but these

targets for political reasons, are
still off limits.
The military men claim they
can't win the war if the peace
marchers continue to use the Dr.
Benjamin Spock Trail.
So you see, my dear Pierre,
the situation in the United States
is quite serious, and some ex
perts predict it will go on for
20 years. I know you are wor
ried for our safety, but please
be assured we are taking all pre
cautions.
We sleep in the fallout shelter,
and Helene only goes out in
the morning to buy bread and
milk. I fly the French flag from
my automobile to show every
one I am neutral, and, if worse
comes to worse, the embassy
has assured us a cruiser will
be sent to evacuate us. Thank
God I kept my French passport.
Your cher ami,
FRANCOIS
