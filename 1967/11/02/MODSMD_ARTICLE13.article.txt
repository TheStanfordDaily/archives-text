## Security Committee Creates Insecurity 
### Philip Taubman 
If anyone has doubts about
the internal security of the
United States, there are two
places he can go to get them re
inforced — the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee (HU
AC) and the Senate Internal Se
curities Subcommittee.
These powerful, self-proclaim
ed guardians of the "American
Way," have the nasty habit of
reinstating McCarthy ism at least
once a year.
Their newest inquisition was
announced in Washington last
week. Senator James O. East
land, a Democrat from Missis
sippi and Chairman of the Sen
ate subcommittee, told the world
that his committee is beginning
an investigation of the recent
New Politics conference held in
Chicago.
Unfortunately, he failed to
point out the irony in his plans.
Only Theatened Themselves
The only threat presented by
the attending groups at the con
ference was to themselves. Rare
ly in political history has a meet
ing accomplished so little, so
fast. No one could agree with
anyone else, and the Black
Power advocates broke the pro
ceedings into a wild, unconstruc
tive debate about the represen
tation of Black Power at the
conference.
What might have been a con
structive effort to unify opposi
tion to the two-party system
and present a viable third party,
ended with disillusionment for
those attending, and gave the na
tion a good laugh about "those
new leftists."
Beware Of The Senator
This same shambles, however,
is what Senator Eastland thinks
threatens our security. Does he
know something that no one else
does?
Apparently he believes so, but
his sources of information and
the way he received them sug
gest that the greatest threat to
American security may be Sena
tor Eastland himself.
All during the conference, he
had agents grabbing whatever
documents they could find, in
cluding and emphasizing those
to be found in private rooms and
private suitcases.
He's Not Talking
Primary attention was given
to the Mississippi Freedom Dem
ocratic Party (MFDP), which
just happens to be a po
litical action group strongly op
posed to Senator Eastland.
According to the New York

Times, its headquarters were
"apparently systematically rifl
ed," and files were removed.
But the Senator does not have
to admit how he got his infor
mation. His office said last week,
"As U.S. Senator, he doesn't
have to divulge the names of his
informants."
Rally 'Bound And Investigate
There were hundreds of or
ganizations represented at the
conference. Senator Eastland
could presumably have his pick
from the Community Party
U.S.A., The NAACP, CORE,
SANE, Martin Luther King's
Southern Christian Leadership
Organization, or even the Sum
mit County (Ohio) Adequate
Welfare Committee.
It's obvious that the good
Senator can have a rousing go at
a major Black Power - New Left
investigation.
It is interesting to note that
there was no mention of any
investigation until long after the
conference had been carefully
skimmed for material.
Last week in Washington,
lawyers for the MFDP went to
court trying to enjoin further
distribution and use of their
files. Senator Eastland responded
that they were already in the
process of an authorized Senate
investigation. To prove his point,
he presented an October 11th res
olution approving the inquiry.
This in itself raised two im
portant questions: Why was the
resolution made five weeks after
the conference, and why was it
kept secret until last week?
Th subcommittee's future ac
tions may throw a white hood
and burning cross in front of
opposition to the two-party sys
tem, the Vietnam War, or any
thing but apple pie.
It might even occur to some
people that maybe the time has
come to do some investigating
of the Senator himself. That
could supply an answer to just
what happened to the right of
dissent.

United States, there are two
places he can go to get them re
inforced — the House Un-Ameri

AC) and the Senate Internal Se
curities Subcommittee.
These powerful, self-proclaim
ed guardians of the "American
Way," have the nasty habit of
reinstating McCarthy ism at least
once a year.
Their newest inquisition was
announced in Washington last
week. Senator James O. East
land, a Democrat from Missis
sippi and Chairman of the Sen
ate subcommittee, told the world
that his committee is beginning
an investigation of the recent
New Politics conference held in
Chicago.
Unfortunately, he failed to
point out the irony in his plans.
Only Theatened Themselves
The only threat presented by
the attending groups at the con
ference was to themselves. Rare
ly in political history has a meet
ing accomplished so little, so
fast. No one could agree with
anyone else, and the Black
Power advocates broke the pro
ceedings into a wild, unconstruc
tive debate about the represen
tation of Black Power at the
conference.
What might have been a con
structive effort to unify opposi
tion to the two-party system
and present a viable third party,
ended with disillusionment for
those attending, and gave the na
tion a good laugh about "those
new leftists."
Beware Of The Senator
This same shambles, however,
is what Senator Eastland thinks
threatens our security. Does he
know something that no one else
does?
Apparently he believes so, but
his sources of information and
the way he received them sug
gest that the greatest threat to
American security may be Sena
tor Eastland himself.
All during the conference, he
had agents grabbing whatever
documents they could find, in
cluding and emphasizing those
to be found in private rooms and
private suitcases.
He's Not Talking
Primary attention was given
to the Mississippi Freedom Dem
ocratic Party (MFDP), which
just happens to be a po
litical action group strongly op
posed to Senator Eastland.
According to the New York

Times, its headquarters were
"apparently systematically rifl
ed," and files were removed.
But the Senator does not have
to admit how he got his infor
mation. His office said last week,
"As U.S. Senator, he doesn't
have to divulge the names of his
informants."
Rally 'Bound And Investigate
There were hundreds of or
ganizations represented at the
conference. Senator Eastland
could presumably have his pick
from the Community Party
U.S.A., The NAACP, CORE,
SANE, Martin Luther King's
Southern Christian Leadership
Organization, or even the Sum
mit County (Ohio) Adequate
Welfare Committee.
It's obvious that the good
Senator can have a rousing go at
a major Black Power - New Left
investigation.
It is interesting to note that
there was no mention of any
investigation until long after the
conference had been carefully
skimmed for material.
Last week in Washington,
lawyers for the MFDP went to
court trying to enjoin further
distribution and use of their
files. Senator Eastland responded
that they were already in the
process of an authorized Senate
investigation. To prove his point,
he presented an October 11th res
olution approving the inquiry.
This in itself raised two im
portant questions: Why was the
resolution made five weeks after
the conference, and why was it
kept secret until last week?
Th subcommittee's future ac
tions may throw a white hood
and burning cross in front of
opposition to the two-party sys
tem, the Vietnam War, or any
thing but apple pie.
It might even occur to some
people that maybe the time has
come to do some investigating
of the Senator himself. That
could supply an answer to just
what happened to the right of
dissent.
