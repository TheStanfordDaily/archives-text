## CIA Legal Brief: Straw-man-manship 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I think that Mr. Baxter's com
ments in yesterday's Daily de
serve some careful consideration
from at least three groups of
students — 1) those considering
attending law school, 2) those
already there, 3) those who oft
en find themselves coming up
against the "legal mind" in at
tempting to change (or even dis
cuss) the social and political or
der.
His essay raises aquestion
which has troubled me quite a
bit this fall, but one that is sel
dom posed In such clear relief—
it is the question of the effect of
a legal "education" on the
mind's ability to comprehend
and cope with social problems.
At first glance I had dismissed
the article as simply another let
ter, but after a law professor
yesterday morning recommend
ed that his class all read it as an
example of a "good brief" I re
read it. Why should a lawyer
find it so appealing? On closer
examination I recognized it as a
brilliant example of "Straw-man
manship." Straw-man-manship is
a dialectical technique we are
taught as a "trick of the legal
trade," that is to say, as a so
phisticated form of lying (per
haps to oneself?). Its basic
structure is simple.
Step 1: (optional) State the
obvious as often as you can. It
confuses the reader and gets
him into the habit of agreeing
with you.
Step 2: (this is the tricky one)
Carefully focus the argument
around one irrelevant issue. This
creates the impression that the
opponent's entire position rides
or falls with the validity of this
statement. It also implies 1) that
this issue is in fact the one re
lied on by the opponent or 2)
that this is the only statement
upon which he could logically
base his action.
Step 3: State the issue in a
form which appears to be "re
solved in favor of its advocates"
(carefully pointing out this gen
erousity). Then shoot hell out of
it.
However effective this tactic
may be in winning law suits, it
doesn't seem very helpful in at
tempting to present to a student
faced with a difficult decision
anything which might help him
reach an informed judgement.
Besides the fact that the issue
chosen by Mr. Baxter (posses
sion of a "direct pipeline to
God") was not in fact the one
bothering any student I know,
it is obviously not the only pos
sible basis for action.
Consider for example 1) the
inconsistency of the purposes of
the University and the C.I.A.
There is no place in an institu
tion supposedly dedicated to
truth, freer communication be
tween men and creation for an
agency whose admitted purposes
are lying, spying and destroy
ing. Or 2) the inconsistency of
University policy, i.e., no "re
cruiting" on campus for the
Free U. There are many others.
But an even more fundamen
tal misconception of the prob
lem seems to be the perspective
from which it is approached. We

are given the entire problem
from the point of view of the
University President! What re
lation such considerations have
to the problem faced by the stu
dent trying to decide whether
or not to act is not clear, unless
we are told, "You cannot act as
a student unless your actions
would be justified if you were
an administrator."
It seems to me that "straw
man" arguments are indeed
"needed," not by the troubled
student, but by another genera
tion who have difficulty justify
ing their actions in the mirror
of their own minds. To this need
the lawyer will always (?) re
spond with his stock in trade,
the clever rationalization.
The real problem (and it
seems to me to be a very real
problem) is the one raised at
Nuremberg, i.e., "What do you
do when the interests of a ma
jority of mankind are opposed
to the interests of a majority in
your own incredibly powerful
nation-state?" This is the prob
lem of my generation, and not
much light will be shown upon
it by liberal rhetoric about "ma
jority rights."

Editor, The Daily:
In Mr. Hargrove's excellent
news story regarding the issue
of CIA recruiting and the plans
for a sit-in at Encina there is
one erroneous statement which
I should like to cQrrect. It is that
"no company or government
agency is allowed to see this
file [i.e. the Placement Office
dossier] without the student's
permission or a subpoena."
That statement would be true
of the student records kept by
the University (the "confidential
records" referred to earlier in
the story), but not of the Place
ment dossiers.
Past practice has been to make
these Placement dossiers avail
able to employers at the discre
tion of the Placement Office Di
rector, where the employer was
similar to one to whom the stu
dent had authorized release of
the dossier.
For example, if a student ex
pressed an interest in General
Motors, and Ford expressed in

terest in that student, his file
(made up of his own contribu
tions plus letters of recommen
dation from people of his own
choosing) would be made avail
able to Ford as well.
No Complaints
There has never been an in
stance of a student complaint to
Placement Service Director
Ralph Keller growing out of this
practice, but in order to avert
any possibility of misunderstand
ing I have directed that the stu
dent's permission be requested
henceforth.
It remains true that faculty
members can request that Place
ment forward a student's file to
a potential employer and the
Placement Office will do so. To
prohibit this would prejudice
many students' chances to get
jobs — particularly academic
jobs — that suit their talents.
Two points ought to be re
emphasized. First, there is no
relation whatsoever between
these Placement Service dossiers
and the confidential records of
a student's Stanford career,
which are never made available
to outsiders without the stu
dent's explicit permission, except
after subpoena, and even then
only with warning to the stu
dent so that he has the oppor
tunity of contesting that sub
poena in the courts.
Second, student use of the
Placement Office is, of course,
wholly voluntary.
It would be unfortunate if
anyone listening to yesterday's
speeches in White Memorial
Plaza derived from what was
said there the impression that
he was putting his career in jeo
pardy, or risking exposure of
his Stanford records, by taking
advantage of the service offered
by Mr. Keller and his staff, for
such is emphatically not the
case.

Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Weinberger's journalism,
at least regarding beards and
the Faculty Club, tends to be
less than thorough. The policy
at issue involves bearded food
handlers only. Both the Faculty
Club and Tresidder Union em

ploy bearded students in their
food service operations. The
head waiter at lunch at the Fac
ulty Club has worn a beard all
quarter. Each operation has
bearded dishwashers. Bearded
students have been employed in
positions of high visibility in
each facility — the information
cei.ter at Tresidder, for example.
Mr. Weinberger has had this
information for several days but
apparently has not thought it
germane. I do.

rector, where the employer was
similar to one to whom the stu
dent had authorized release of
the dossier.
For example, if a student ex
pressed an interest in General
Motors, and Ford expressed in

terest in that student, his file
(made up of his own contribu
tions plus letters of recommen
dation from people of his own
choosing) would be made avail
able to Ford as well.
No Complaints
There has never been an in
stance of a student complaint to
Placement Service Director
Ralph Keller growing out of this
practice, but in order to avert
any possibility of misunderstand
ing I have directed that the stu
dent's permission be requested
henceforth.
It remains true that faculty
members can request that Place
ment forward a student's file to
a potential employer and the
Placement Office will do so. To
prohibit this would prejudice
many students' chances to get
jobs — particularly academic
jobs — that suit their talents.
Two points ought to be re
emphasized. First, there is no
relation whatsoever between
these Placement Service dossiers
and the confidential records of
a student's Stanford career,
which are never made available
to outsiders without the stu
dent's explicit permission, except
after subpoena, and even then
only with warning to the stu
dent so that he has the oppor
tunity of contesting that sub
poena in the courts.
Second, student use of the
Placement Office is, of course,
wholly voluntary.
It would be unfortunate if
anyone listening to yesterday's
speeches in White Memorial
Plaza derived from what was
said there the impression that
he was putting his career in jeo
pardy, or risking exposure of

such is emphatically not the

Editor, The Daily:
The Daily's piece on Stanford
in Washington (October 30) re
fers to Stanford's program as
the "oldest and largest". Come
on now; let's no I be so parochial.
Our program was initiated
through a lot of devoted effort
by Jamie G. Hunter, LL.B. '64,
a Yale alumnus who had been
in Yale's successful intern pro
gram before he entered Law
School here.
It's not like we don't owe Yale
enough already yet — Dean of
the Law School, Dean of the
Chapel, Executive Heads of His
tory and Surgery, not to men
tion other distinguished mem
bers of the faculty. How about a
little Boola Boola!
K. ML CUTHBERTSON
Vice Pres. for Finance
Editor, The Dally:
I think that Mr. Baxter's com
ments in yesterday's Daily de
serve some careful consideration
from at least three groups of
students — 1) those considering
attending law school, 2) those
already there, 3) those who oft
en find themselves coming up
against the "legal mind" in at
tempting to change (or even dis
cuss) the social and political or
der.
His essay raises aquestion
which has troubled me quite a
bit this fall, but one that is sel
dom posed In such clear relief—
it is the question of the effect of
a legal "education" on the
mind's ability to comprehend
and cope with social problems.
At first glance I had dismissed
the article as simply another let
ter, but after a law professor
yesterday morning recommend
ed that his class all read it as an
example of a "good brief" I re
read it. Why should a lawyer
find it so appealing? On closer
examination I recognized it as a
brilliant example of "Straw-man
manship." Straw-man-manship is
a dialectical technique we are
taught as a "trick of the legal
trade," that is to say, as a so
phisticated form of lying (per
haps to oneself?). Its basic
structure is simple.
Step 1: (optional) State the
obvious as often as you can. It
confuses the reader and gets
him into the habit of agreeing
with you.
Step 2: (this is the tricky one)
Carefully focus the argument
around one irrelevant issue. This
creates the impression that the
opponent's entire position rides
or falls with the validity of this
statement. It also implies 1) that
this issue is in fact the one re
lied on by the opponent or 2)
that this is the only statement
upon which he could logically
base his action.
Step 3: State the issue in a
form which appears to be "re
solved in favor of its advocates"
(carefully pointing out this gen
erousity). Then shoot hell out of
it.
However effective this tactic
may be in winning law suits, it
doesn't seem very helpful in at
tempting to present to a student
faced with a difficult decision
anything which might help him
reach an informed judgement.
Besides the fact that the issue
chosen by Mr. Baxter (posses
sion of a "direct pipeline to
God") was not in fact the one
bothering any student I know,
it is obviously not the only pos
sible basis for action.
Consider for example 1) the
inconsistency of the purposes of
the University and the C.I.A.
There is no place in an institu
tion supposedly dedicated to
truth, freer communication be
tween men and creation for an
agency whose admitted purposes
are lying, spying and destroy
ing. Or 2) the inconsistency of
University policy, i.e., no "re
cruiting" on campus for the
Free U. There are many others.
But an even more fundamen
tal misconception of the prob
lem seems to be the perspective
from which it is approached. We

are given the entire problem
from the point of view of the
University President! What re
lation such considerations have
to the problem faced by the stu
dent trying to decide whether
or not to act is not clear, unless
we are told, "You cannot act as
a student unless your actions
would be justified if you were
an administrator."
It seems to me that "straw
man" arguments are indeed
"needed," not by the troubled
student, but by another genera
tion who have difficulty justify
ing their actions in the mirror
of their own minds. To this need
the lawyer will always (?) re
spond with his stock in trade,
the clever rationalization.
The real problem (and it
seems to me to be a very real
problem) is the one raised at
Nuremberg, i.e., "What do you
do when the interests of a ma
jority of mankind are opposed
to the interests of a majority in
your own incredibly powerful
nation-state?" This is the prob
lem of my generation, and not
much light will be shown upon
it by liberal rhetoric about "ma
jority rights."

manship." Straw-man-manship is
a dialectical technique we are
taught as a "trick of the legal
trade," that is to say, as a so
phisticated form of lying (per
haps to oneself?). Its basic
structure is simple.
Step 1: (optional) State the
obvious as often as you can. It
confuses the reader and gets
him into the habit of agreeing
with you.
Step 2: (this is the tricky one)
Carefully focus the argument
around one irrelevant issue. This
creates the impression that the
opponent's entire position rides
or falls with the validity of this
statement. It also implies 1) that
this issue is in fact the one re
lied on by the opponent or 2)
that this is the only statement
upon which he could logically
base his action.
Step 3: State the issue in a
form which appears to be "re
solved in favor of its advocates"
(carefully pointing out this gen
erousity). Then shoot hell out of
it.
However effective this tactic
may be in winning law suits, it
doesn't seem very helpful in at
tempting to present to a student
faced with a difficult decision
anything which might help him
reach an informed judgement.
Besides the fact that the issue
chosen by Mr. Baxter (posses
sion of a "direct pipeline to
God") was not in fact the one
bothering any student I know,
it is obviously not the only pos
sible basis for action.
Consider for example 1) the
inconsistency of the purposes of
the University and the C.I.A.
There is no place in an institu
tion supposedly dedicated to
truth, freer communication be
tween men and creation for an
agency whose admitted purposes
are lying, spying and destroy
ing. Or 2) the inconsistency of
University policy, i.e., no "re
cruiting" on campus for the
Free U. There are many others.
But an even more fundamen
tal misconception of the prob
lem seems to be the perspective
from which it is approached. We

are given the entire problem
from the point of view of the
University President! What re
lation such considerations have
to the problem faced by the stu
dent trying to decide whether
or not to act is not clear, unless
we are told, "You cannot act as
a student unless your actions
would be justified if you were
an administrator."
It seems to me that "straw
man" arguments are indeed
"needed," not by the troubled
student, but by another genera
tion who have difficulty justify
ing their actions in the mirror
of their own minds. To this need
the lawyer will always (?) re
spond with his stock in trade,
the clever rationalization.
The real problem (and it
seems to me to be a very real
problem) is the one raised at
Nuremberg, i.e., "What do you
do when the interests of a ma
jority of mankind are opposed
to the interests of a majority in
your own incredibly powerful
nation-state?" This is the prob
lem of my generation, and not
much light will be shown upon
it by liberal rhetoric about "ma
jority rights."

Editor, The Daily:
In Mr. Hargrove's excellent
news story regarding the issue
of CIA recruiting and the plans
for a sit-in at Encina there is
one erroneous statement which
I should like to cQrrect. It is that
"no company or government
agency is allowed to see this
file [i.e. the Placement Office
dossier] without the student's
permission or a subpoena."
That statement would be true
of the student records kept by
the University (the "confidential
records" referred to earlier in
the story), but not of the Place
ment dossiers.
Past practice has been to make
these Placement dossiers avail
able to employers at the discre
tion of the Placement Office Di
rector, where the employer was
similar to one to whom the stu
dent had authorized release of
the dossier.
For example, if a student ex
pressed an interest in General
Motors, and Ford expressed in

terest in that student, his file
(made up of his own contribu
tions plus letters of recommen
dation from people of his own
choosing) would be made avail
able to Ford as well.
No Complaints
There has never been an in
stance of a student complaint to
Placement Service Director
Ralph Keller growing out of this
practice, but in order to avert
any possibility of misunderstand
ing I have directed that the stu
dent's permission be requested
henceforth.
It remains true that faculty
members can request that Place
ment forward a student's file to
a potential employer and the
Placement Office will do so. To
prohibit this would prejudice
many students' chances to get
jobs — particularly academic
jobs — that suit their talents.
Two points ought to be re
emphasized. First, there is no
relation whatsoever between
these Placement Service dossiers
and the confidential records of
a student's Stanford career,
which are never made available
to outsiders without the stu
dent's explicit permission, except
after subpoena, and even then
only with warning to the stu
dent so that he has the oppor
tunity of contesting that sub
poena in the courts.
Second, student use of the
Placement Office is, of course,
wholly voluntary.
It would be unfortunate if
anyone listening to yesterday's
speeches in White Memorial
Plaza derived from what was
said there the impression that
he was putting his career in jeo
pardy, or risking exposure of
his Stanford records, by taking
advantage of the service offered
by Mr. Keller and his staff, for
such is emphatically not the

The Daily's piece on Stanford

Our program was initiated
through a lot of devoted effort

in Yale's successful intern pro

I think that Mr. Baxter's com

serve some careful consideration
from at least three groups of
students — 1) those considering
attending law school, 2) those
already there, 3) those who oft
en find themselves coming up
against the "legal mind" in at
tempting to change (or even dis

His essay raises aquestion
which has troubled me quite a

dom posed In such clear relief—
it is the question of the effect of
a legal "education" on the
mind's ability to comprehend
and cope with social problems.
At first glance I had dismissed
the article as simply another let

yesterday morning recommend
ed that his class all read it as an
example of a "good brief" I re
read it. Why should a lawyer
find it so appealing? On closer

Editor, The Daily:
The Daily's piece on Stanford
in Washington (October 30) re
fers to Stanford's program as
the "oldest and largest". Come
on now; let's no I be so parochial.
Our program was initiated
through a lot of devoted effort
by Jamie G. Hunter, LL.B. '64,
a Yale alumnus who had been
in Yale's successful intern pro
gram before he entered Law
School here.
It's not like we don't owe Yale
enough already yet — Dean of
the Law School, Dean of the
Chapel, Executive Heads of His
tory and Surgery, not to men
tion other distinguished mem
bers of the faculty. How about a
little Boola Boola!
K. ML CUTHBERTSON
Vice Pres. for Finance
Editor, The Dally:
I think that Mr. Baxter's com
ments in yesterday's Daily de
serve some careful consideration
from at least three groups of
students — 1) those considering
attending law school, 2) those
already there, 3) those who oft
en find themselves coming up
against the "legal mind" in at
tempting to change (or even dis
cuss) the social and political or
der.
His essay raises aquestion
which has troubled me quite a
bit this fall, but one that is sel
dom posed In such clear relief—
it is the question of the effect of
a legal "education" on the
mind's ability to comprehend
and cope with social problems.
At first glance I had dismissed
the article as simply another let
ter, but after a law professor
yesterday morning recommend
ed that his class all read it as an
example of a "good brief" I re
read it. Why should a lawyer
find it so appealing? On closer
examination I recognized it as a
brilliant example of "Straw-man
manship." Straw-man-manship is
a dialectical technique we are
taught as a "trick of the legal
trade," that is to say, as a so
phisticated form of lying (per
haps to oneself?). Its basic
structure is simple.
Step 1: (optional) State the
obvious as often as you can. It
confuses the reader and gets
him into the habit of agreeing
with you.
Step 2: (this is the tricky one)
Carefully focus the argument
around one irrelevant issue. This
creates the impression that the
opponent's entire position rides
or falls with the validity of this
statement. It also implies 1) that
this issue is in fact the one re
lied on by the opponent or 2)
that this is the only statement
upon which he could logically
base his action.
Step 3: State the issue in a
form which appears to be "re
solved in favor of its advocates"
(carefully pointing out this gen
erousity). Then shoot hell out of
it.
However effective this tactic
may be in winning law suits, it
doesn't seem very helpful in at
tempting to present to a student
faced with a difficult decision
anything which might help him
reach an informed judgement.
Besides the fact that the issue
chosen by Mr. Baxter (posses
sion of a "direct pipeline to
God") was not in fact the one
bothering any student I know,
it is obviously not the only pos
sible basis for action.
Consider for example 1) the
inconsistency of the purposes of
the University and the C.I.A.
There is no place in an institu
tion supposedly dedicated to
truth, freer communication be
tween men and creation for an
agency whose admitted purposes
are lying, spying and destroy
ing. Or 2) the inconsistency of
University policy, i.e., no "re
cruiting" on campus for the
Free U. There are many others.
But an even more fundamen
tal misconception of the prob
lem seems to be the perspective
from which it is approached. We

are given the entire problem
from the point of view of the
University President! What re
lation such considerations have
to the problem faced by the stu
dent trying to decide whether
or not to act is not clear, unless
we are told, "You cannot act as
a student unless your actions
would be justified if you were
an administrator."
It seems to me that "straw
man" arguments are indeed
"needed," not by the troubled
student, but by another genera
tion who have difficulty justify
ing their actions in the mirror
of their own minds. To this need
the lawyer will always (?) re
spond with his stock in trade,
the clever rationalization.
The real problem (and it
seems to me to be a very real
problem) is the one raised at
Nuremberg, i.e., "What do you
do when the interests of a ma
jority of mankind are opposed
to the interests of a majority in
your own incredibly powerful
nation-state?" This is the prob
lem of my generation, and not
much light will be shown upon
it by liberal rhetoric about "ma
jority rights."
DOUG SORENSEN,

• Dossiers Open
Editor, The Daily:
In Mr. Hargrove's excellent
news story regarding the issue
of CIA recruiting and the plans
for a sit-in at Encina there is
one erroneous statement which
I should like to cQrrect. It is that
"no company or government
agency is allowed to see this
file [i.e. the Placement Office
dossier] without the student's
permission or a subpoena."
That statement would be true
of the student records kept by
the University (the "confidential
records" referred to earlier in
the story), but not of the Place
ment dossiers.
Past practice has been to make
these Placement dossiers avail
able to employers at the discre
tion of the Placement Office Di
rector, where the employer was
similar to one to whom the stu
dent had authorized release of
the dossier.
For example, if a student ex
pressed an interest in General
Motors, and Ford expressed in

terest in that student, his file
(made up of his own contribu
tions plus letters of recommen
dation from people of his own
choosing) would be made avail
able to Ford as well.
No Complaints
There has never been an in
stance of a student complaint to
Placement Service Director
Ralph Keller growing out of this
practice, but in order to avert
any possibility of misunderstand
ing I have directed that the stu
dent's permission be requested
henceforth.
It remains true that faculty
members can request that Place
ment forward a student's file to
a potential employer and the
Placement Office will do so. To
prohibit this would prejudice
many students' chances to get
jobs — particularly academic
jobs — that suit their talents.
Two points ought to be re
emphasized. First, there is no
relation whatsoever between
these Placement Service dossiers
and the confidential records of
a student's Stanford career,
which are never made available
to outsiders without the stu
dent's explicit permission, except
after subpoena, and even then
only with warning to the stu
dent so that he has the oppor
tunity of contesting that sub
poena in the courts.

doesn't seem very helpful in at
tempting to present to a student
faced with a difficult decision
anything which might help him
reach an informed judgement.
Besides the fact that the issue
chosen by Mr. Baxter (posses
sion of a "direct pipeline to
God") was not in fact the one
bothering any student I know,
it is obviously not the only pos
sible basis for action.
Consider for example 1) the
inconsistency of the purposes of
the University and the C.I.A.
There is no place in an institu
tion supposedly dedicated to
truth, freer communication be
tween men and creation for an
agency whose admitted purposes
are lying, spying and destroy
ing. Or 2) the inconsistency of
University policy, i.e., no "re
cruiting" on campus for the
Free U. There are many others.
But an even more fundamen
tal misconception of the prob
lem seems to be the perspective
from which it is approached. We

are given the entire problem
from the point of view of the
University President! What re
lation such considerations have
to the problem faced by the stu
dent trying to decide whether
or not to act is not clear, unless
we are told, "You cannot act as
a student unless your actions
would be justified if you were
an administrator."
It seems to me that "straw
man" arguments are indeed
"needed," not by the troubled
student, but by another genera
tion who have difficulty justify
ing their actions in the mirror
of their own minds. To this need
the lawyer will always (?) re
spond with his stock in trade,
the clever rationalization.
The real problem (and it
seems to me to be a very real
problem) is the one raised at
Nuremberg, i.e., "What do you
do when the interests of a ma
jority of mankind are opposed
to the interests of a majority in
your own incredibly powerful
nation-state?" This is the prob
lem of my generation, and not
much light will be shown upon
it by liberal rhetoric about "ma
jority rights."

Editor, The Daily:
In Mr. Hargrove's excellent
news story regarding the issue
of CIA recruiting and the plans
for a sit-in at Encina there is
one erroneous statement which
I should like to cQrrect. It is that
"no company or government
agency is allowed to see this
file [i.e. the Placement Office
dossier] without the student's
permission or a subpoena."
That statement would be true
of the student records kept by
the University (the "confidential
records" referred to earlier in
the story), but not of the Place
ment dossiers.
Past practice has been to make
these Placement dossiers avail
able to employers at the discre
tion of the Placement Office Di
rector, where the employer was
similar to one to whom the stu
dent had authorized release of
the dossier.
For example, if a student ex
pressed an interest in General
Motors, and Ford expressed in

terest in that student, his file
(made up of his own contribu
tions plus letters of recommen
dation from people of his own
choosing) would be made avail
able to Ford as well.
No Complaints
There has never been an in
stance of a student complaint to
Placement Service Director
Ralph Keller growing out of this
practice, but in order to avert
any possibility of misunderstand
ing I have directed that the stu
dent's permission be requested
henceforth.
It remains true that faculty
members can request that Place
ment forward a student's file to
a potential employer and the
Placement Office will do so. To
prohibit this would prejudice
many students' chances to get
jobs — particularly academic
jobs — that suit their talents.
Two points ought to be re
emphasized. First, there is no
relation whatsoever between
these Placement Service dossiers
and the confidential records of
a student's Stanford career,
which are never made available
to outsiders without the stu
dent's explicit permission, except
after subpoena, and even then
only with warning to the stu
dent so that he has the oppor
tunity of contesting that sub
poena in the courts.
Second, student use of the
Placement Office is, of course,
wholly voluntary.
It would be unfortunate if
anyone listening to yesterday's
speeches in White Memorial
Plaza derived from what was
said there the impression that
he was putting his career in jeo
pardy, or risking exposure of
his Stanford records, by taking
advantage of the service offered
by Mr. Keller and his staff, for
such is emphatically not the
case.

Mr. Weinberger's journalism,
at least regarding beards and
the Faculty Club, tends to be
less than thorough. The policy
at issue involves bearded food
handlers only. Both the Faculty
Club and Tresidder Union em

ploy bearded students in their
food service operations. The
head waiter at lunch at the Fac

quarter. Each operation has
bearded dishwashers. Bearded
students have been employed in
positions of high visibility in
each facility — the information

Mr. Weinberger has had this
information for several days but
apparently has not thought it

The Daily's piece on Stanford
in Washington (October 30) re
fers to Stanford's program as
the "oldest and largest". Come
on now; let's no I be so parochial.
Our program was initiated
through a lot of devoted effort
by Jamie G. Hunter, LL.B. '64,
a Yale alumnus who had been
in Yale's successful intern pro
gram before he entered Law
School here.
It's not like we don't owe Yale
enough already yet — Dean of
the Law School, Dean of the
Chapel, Executive Heads of His
tory and Surgery, not to men
tion other distinguished mem
bers of the faculty. How about a
little Boola Boola!
K. ML CUTHBERTSON
Vice Pres. for Finance
Editor, The Dally:
I think that Mr. Baxter's com
ments in yesterday's Daily de
serve some careful consideration
from at least three groups of
students — 1) those considering
attending law school, 2) those
already there, 3) those who oft
en find themselves coming up
against the "legal mind" in at
tempting to change (or even dis
cuss) the social and political or
der.
His essay raises aquestion
which has troubled me quite a
bit this fall, but one that is sel
dom posed In such clear relief—
it is the question of the effect of
a legal "education" on the
mind's ability to comprehend
and cope with social problems.
At first glance I had dismissed
the article as simply another let
ter, but after a law professor
yesterday morning recommend
ed that his class all read it as an
example of a "good brief" I re
read it. Why should a lawyer
find it so appealing? On closer
examination I recognized it as a
brilliant example of "Straw-man
manship." Straw-man-manship is
a dialectical technique we are
taught as a "trick of the legal
trade," that is to say, as a so
phisticated form of lying (per
haps to oneself?). Its basic
structure is simple.
Step 1: (optional) State the
obvious as often as you can. It
confuses the reader and gets
him into the habit of agreeing
with you.
Step 2: (this is the tricky one)
Carefully focus the argument
around one irrelevant issue. This
creates the impression that the
opponent's entire position rides
or falls with the validity of this
statement. It also implies 1) that
this issue is in fact the one re
lied on by the opponent or 2)
that this is the only statement
upon which he could logically
base his action.
Step 3: State the issue in a
form which appears to be "re
solved in favor of its advocates"
(carefully pointing out this gen
erousity). Then shoot hell out of
it.
However effective this tactic
may be in winning law suits, it
doesn't seem very helpful in at
tempting to present to a student
faced with a difficult decision
anything which might help him
reach an informed judgement.
Besides the fact that the issue
chosen by Mr. Baxter (posses
