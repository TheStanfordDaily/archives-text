# Paly Playhouse Tries Arthur Miller
## â€˜View From Bridge' Has Only Surface Reality 
### 
frank s. alberti
THE 1955 New York produc
tion of A View From the
Bridge was remote and aus
tere. One act, instead of two, fo
cused on the stage the tragedy of
Eddie's passion somewhere in the
darkness beneath the silent and
elusive figure of the bridge-back
ground.
"I had originally conceived Ed
die as a phenomenon, a rather awe
some fact of existence, and I had
kept a certain distance from in
volvement in his self-justifications."
At the same time, Arthur Miller's
expressed estrangements released
the audience from the emphathic
involvement of a realistic portrayal
of the same plot. What at first
glance seems to be a realistic play
is actually an effort to "present
rather than to represent an inter
pretation of reality."
The drama is thus seen from a

bird-on-a-bridge eye's view from
above and eminently suited to the
half-round stage of the Manhattan
Playhouse in downtown Palo Alto
at the corner of Manhattan Avenue
and West Bayshore Road. One is
constantly reminded that people on
the side of the stage are watching
a play and so are we. It is Miller's
desire "not to forge a pretense of
life, but to be abrupt, clear, and
explicit in setting forth fact as fact
and art as art so that the sea of
theatrical sentiment, which is so
easily let in to drown all shape,
meaning, and perspective, might be
held back and some hard outline of
a human dilemma be allowed to
rise and stand." The physical setup
of this type of stage lends itself to
the transparency and distance of
our participation in an art form
which usually demands a more to
tal concern.
Unfortunately, there is more of

Manhattan in the name of the thea
ter than on the stage which the
playwright was sure to situate in
the "slum that faces the bay on the
seaward side of Brooklyn Bridge."
Needless to say this is the same
bridge that gives its name to the
play. The sea, a primary poetic
force is absent as well. So, too, is a
certain directness of detail.
Now, if one is to establish the
artificial presence of a dynamic,
ever-present happening that tran
scends the environment from which
it grows, than this stage reality
must be as hard and at least as true
as possible leading eventually to
the easy destruction of the illusion
of spectacle and a return to the
immediate destiny of the spectator.
I object, therefore, to Marco's mod
green belt buckle, to Eddie's ex
pensive-for-a - longshoreman apres
ski boots, to Beatrice's fashionable
horn-rimmed glasses. The flip-top

of a beer can which goes "snap"
is distracting for other reasons in a
play which is not a commercial.
Even the new suit of Rodolpho,
who Eddie insists is "not right"
(i.e. queer), is more California
than 42nd Street.
But these are details brought to
light first because they are super
ficial and easily contested. The cast
which includes a former Stanford
student, Jacqueline Ames (Speech
and Drama) and Professor Wood
worth (Statistics) beams with the
satisfaction that comes from a seri
ous and intense evening in the thea
ter.
Briefly, the action is as follows.
Eddie doesn't understand that his
concern for his niece Catherine's
future exceeds paternity. Catherine
falls in love with Rodolpho, one of
two submarines who comes to life
with them. (A submarine is an il
legal immigrant.) Eddie's latent

passion becomes overwhelming and
leads to destruction making him the
tragic hero of the play in the Mil
lerean sense which implies that
"the closer a man approaches trag
edy the more intense is his concen
tration of emotion upon the fixed
point of his commitment." This in
tensity is not far from fanaticism.
Eric Silins' portrayal of Eddie
shows great control but lack of an
intelligent build-up in anticipation
of the dramatic denouement. This
criticism applies to Miss Ames as
well who, fails to assume the deli
cate being of a rapidly maturing
adolescent. She is too determined
in her movements and has adopted
a tone of voice which assures the
a priori image of goodness she pro
claims. This critique is partly based
on the playwright's failure to endow
his characters with a sense of guilt.
Brigita Silins, Eddie's real and
stage wife, is more successful in
the ambiguous role she plays as the

devoted but frustrated wife. Fred
Scott as Alfieri, the lawyer and Ed
die's counsel, and "engaged" nar
rator-chorus of a disengaged play
rises eloquently to the poetry of his
lines and his gentle voice is a wel
come relief. It would certainly help
if all these actors and actresses
looked at their visitors in the audi
ence. The rapport of the players to
one another has already been estab
lished before curtain time and too
much visual contact on stage is re
dundant.
Judith Dresch, the director of A
View From the Bridge has not for
gotten to delineate the comic ele
ments of this tragedy of the every
day and has certainly made her in
spiration felt. I am looking forward
to the forthcoming production of
Slow Dance on the Killing Grounds
and to Madame Dresch's own ap
pearance as Dolly in The Merchant
of Yonkers.

THE 1955 New York produc
tion of A View From the
Bridge was remote and aus
tere. One act, instead of two, fo
cused on the stage the tragedy of
Eddie's passion somewhere in the
darkness beneath the silent and
elusive figure of the bridge-back
ground.
"I had originally conceived Ed
die as a phenomenon, a rather awe
some fact of existence, and I had
kept a certain distance from in
volvement in his self-justifications."
At the same time, Arthur Miller's
expressed estrangements released
the audience from the emphathic
involvement of a realistic portrayal
of the same plot. What at first
glance seems to be a realistic play
is actually an effort to "present
rather than to represent an inter
pretation of reality."
The drama is thus seen from a

bird-on-a-bridge eye's view from
above and eminently suited to the
half-round stage of the Manhattan
Playhouse in downtown Palo Alto
at the corner of Manhattan Avenue
and West Bayshore Road. One is
constantly reminded that people on
the side of the stage are watching
a play and so are we. It is Miller's
desire "not to forge a pretense of
life, but to be abrupt, clear, and
explicit in setting forth fact as fact
and art as art so that the sea of
theatrical sentiment, which is so
easily let in to drown all shape,
meaning, and perspective, might be
held back and some hard outline of
a human dilemma be allowed to
rise and stand." The physical setup
of this type of stage lends itself to
the transparency and distance of
our participation in an art form
which usually demands a more to
tal concern.
Unfortunately, there is more of

Manhattan in the name of the thea
ter than on the stage which the
playwright was sure to situate in
the "slum that faces the bay on the
seaward side of Brooklyn Bridge."
Needless to say this is the same
bridge that gives its name to the
play. The sea, a primary poetic
force is absent as well. So, too, is a
certain directness of detail.
Now, if one is to establish the
artificial presence of a dynamic,
ever-present happening that tran
scends the environment from which
it grows, than this stage reality
must be as hard and at least as true
as possible leading eventually to
the easy destruction of the illusion
of spectacle and a return to the
immediate destiny of the spectator.
I object, therefore, to Marco's mod
green belt buckle, to Eddie's ex
pensive-for-a - longshoreman apres
ski boots, to Beatrice's fashionable
horn-rimmed glasses. The flip-top

of a beer can which goes "snap"
is distracting for other reasons in a
play which is not a commercial.
Even the new suit of Rodolpho,
who Eddie insists is "not right"
(i.e. queer), is more California
than 42nd Street.
But these are details brought to
light first because they are super
ficial and easily contested. The cast
which includes a former Stanford
student, Jacqueline Ames (Speech
and Drama) and Professor Wood
worth (Statistics) beams with the
satisfaction that comes from a seri
ous and intense evening in the thea
ter.
Briefly, the action is as follows.
Eddie doesn't understand that his
concern for his niece Catherine's
future exceeds paternity. Catherine
falls in love with Rodolpho, one of
two submarines who comes to life
with them. (A submarine is an il
legal immigrant.) Eddie's latent

passion becomes overwhelming and
leads to destruction making him the
tragic hero of the play in the Mil
lerean sense which implies that
"the closer a man approaches trag
edy the more intense is his concen
tration of emotion upon the fixed
point of his commitment." This in
tensity is not far from fanaticism.
Eric Silins' portrayal of Eddie
shows great control but lack of an
intelligent build-up in anticipation
of the dramatic denouement. This
criticism applies to Miss Ames as
well who, fails to assume the deli
cate being of a rapidly maturing
adolescent. She is too determined
in her movements and has adopted
a tone of voice which assures the
a priori image of goodness she pro
claims. This critique is partly based
on the playwright's failure to endow
his characters with a sense of guilt.
Brigita Silins, Eddie's real and
stage wife, is more successful in
the ambiguous role she plays as the

devoted but frustrated wife. Fred
Scott as Alfieri, the lawyer and Ed
die's counsel, and "engaged" nar
rator-chorus of a disengaged play
rises eloquently to the poetry of his
lines and his gentle voice is a wel
come relief. It would certainly help
if all these actors and actresses
looked at their visitors in the audi
ence. The rapport of the players to
one another has already been estab
lished before curtain time and too
much visual contact on stage is re
dundant.

View From the Bridge has not for
gotten to delineate the comic ele
ments of this tragedy of the every
day and has certainly made her in
spiration felt. I am looking forward

one another has already been estab

much visual contact on stage is re

Judith Dresch, the director of A

THE 1955 New York produc
tion of A View From the
Bridge was remote and aus
tere. One act, instead of two, fo
cused on the stage the tragedy of
Eddie's passion somewhere in the
darkness beneath the silent and
elusive figure of the bridge-back
ground.
"I had originally conceived Ed
die as a phenomenon, a rather awe
some fact of existence, and I had
kept a certain distance from in
volvement in his self-justifications."
At the same time, Arthur Miller's
expressed estrangements released
the audience from the emphathic
involvement of a realistic portrayal
of the same plot. What at first
glance seems to be a realistic play
is actually an effort to "present
rather than to represent an inter
pretation of reality."
The drama is thus seen from a

bird-on-a-bridge eye's view from
above and eminently suited to the
half-round stage of the Manhattan
Playhouse in downtown Palo Alto
at the corner of Manhattan Avenue
and West Bayshore Road. One is
constantly reminded that people on
the side of the stage are watching
a play and so are we. It is Miller's
desire "not to forge a pretense of
life, but to be abrupt, clear, and
explicit in setting forth fact as fact
and art as art so that the sea of
theatrical sentiment, which is so
easily let in to drown all shape,
meaning, and perspective, might be
held back and some hard outline of
a human dilemma be allowed to
rise and stand." The physical setup
of this type of stage lends itself to
the transparency and distance of
our participation in an art form
which usually demands a more to
tal concern.
Unfortunately, there is more of

Manhattan in the name of the thea
ter than on the stage which the
playwright was sure to situate in
the "slum that faces the bay on the
seaward side of Brooklyn Bridge."
Needless to say this is the same
bridge that gives its name to the
play. The sea, a primary poetic
force is absent as well. So, too, is a
certain directness of detail.
Now, if one is to establish the
artificial presence of a dynamic,
ever-present happening that tran
scends the environment from which
it grows, than this stage reality
must be as hard and at least as true
as possible leading eventually to
the easy destruction of the illusion
of spectacle and a return to the
immediate destiny of the spectator.
I object, therefore, to Marco's mod
green belt buckle, to Eddie's ex
pensive-for-a - longshoreman apres
ski boots, to Beatrice's fashionable
horn-rimmed glasses. The flip-top

of a beer can which goes "snap"
is distracting for other reasons in a
play which is not a commercial.
Even the new suit of Rodolpho,
who Eddie insists is "not right"
(i.e. queer), is more California
than 42nd Street.
But these are details brought to
light first because they are super
ficial and easily contested. The cast
which includes a former Stanford
student, Jacqueline Ames (Speech
and Drama) and Professor Wood
worth (Statistics) beams with the
satisfaction that comes from a seri
ous and intense evening in the thea
ter.
Briefly, the action is as follows.
Eddie doesn't understand that his
concern for his niece Catherine's
future exceeds paternity. Catherine
falls in love with Rodolpho, one of
two submarines who comes to life
with them. (A submarine is an il
legal immigrant.) Eddie's latent

passion becomes overwhelming and
leads to destruction making him the
tragic hero of the play in the Mil
lerean sense which implies that
"the closer a man approaches trag
edy the more intense is his concen
tration of emotion upon the fixed
point of his commitment." This in
tensity is not far from fanaticism.
Eric Silins' portrayal of Eddie
shows great control but lack of an
intelligent build-up in anticipation
of the dramatic denouement. This
criticism applies to Miss Ames as
well who, fails to assume the deli
cate being of a rapidly maturing
adolescent. She is too determined
in her movements and has adopted
a tone of voice which assures the
a priori image of goodness she pro
claims. This critique is partly based
on the playwright's failure to endow
his characters with a sense of guilt.
Brigita Silins, Eddie's real and
stage wife, is more successful in
the ambiguous role she plays as the

devoted but frustrated wife. Fred
Scott as Alfieri, the lawyer and Ed
die's counsel, and "engaged" nar
rator-chorus of a disengaged play
rises eloquently to the poetry of his
lines and his gentle voice is a wel
come relief. It would certainly help
if all these actors and actresses
looked at their visitors in the audi
ence. The rapport of the players to
one another has already been estab
lished before curtain time and too
much visual contact on stage is re
