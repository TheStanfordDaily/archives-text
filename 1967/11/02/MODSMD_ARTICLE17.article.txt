Stanford has just been be
queathed $2,297,543. The amount
is one of the largest gifts that
the university has ever received.
The donor is James H. Polhe
mus, a Stanford graduate and
Portland, Oregon engineer.
Under the terms of his will,
the money is to be used to set up
the James H. Polhemus Fund
for the School of Engineering.
He received his bachelor of arts
in civil engineering degree from
.his department when he grad
uated in 1911.
Polhemus specified that a por
tion of the income from his en
dowment fund be used to pro
vide five School of Engineering
scholarships each year for tui
tion plus $1,000. The will stipu
lates that a majority of the
recipients must be from his
homestate of Oregon.
The rest of the income from

the endowment fund will be
spent at the discretion of the
Dean of the School of Engineer
ing for equipment, expenses of
professional meetings of profes

time member of the Alumni As
sociation ai well as a member
of Stanford Associates, a group
of volunteer leaders.
The engineer was eminent in
his field, and he was credited
with designing the first Diesel
electric dredge; with making
Portland the first city in the
United States with a paved, all
weather airport runway; and
with making Portland a year
