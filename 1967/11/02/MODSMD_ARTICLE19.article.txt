# Paintings and Sculpture Shown In Serra Lounge
## 
### 
The paintings and sculpture of
Tracy Marshall are being shown
in the Serra lounge. The collec
tion on display includes 17 of
her works, ranging from color
ful landscapes to simple scenes
of children.
The artist has had her work
shown for the past three years
in the Shaker Square Art Show
in Cleveland and in museums in
Hartford, Norwich, and New
London, Conn. She has studied
under painters William McCloy
and Richard Lukosius and sculp
tor David Smalley.
In describing her work she
says, "In my earlier work land
scape was the determining fact
or." Later she shifted to "thick
rich impastos, color and paint
almost for its own sake. But it
was too overwhelming." She be
gan to change her style.
Deciding on acrylic stains, she
began "going away from identi
fiable landscape context." Now
she seeks to use the "canvas as
a whole, not just subject or
paint are important."
Miss Marshall views her work
in sculpture as a "struggle to
bring myself away from two-di

mensional context." In her work
with laminated wood, she finds
that she can "simplify to utmost
to bring across the point in
strong, stark way."
In another vein she paints in
a "strong memory of a colorful,
simple time past. Children's
world-remembered as easy and
carefree."
