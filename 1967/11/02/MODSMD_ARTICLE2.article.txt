# Lyman Speech Heads Busy LASSU Agenda
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Major proposals by student
leaders which could determine
the future role of the Associated
Students will come before the
legislature tonight.
The heavy agenda includes a
response by ASSU President
Peter Lyman to Monday's invi
tation by the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES) that he
form a student advisory com
mittee to review SES recom
mendations.
Also at the 7:30 p.m. meeting
in Geology room 370, Speaker
Michael Weinstein will appoint
a special committee to study
"community government"
schemes. Community govern
ment would shift University
policy decisions to a legislature
representing students, faculty,
and administration.
Also, Lyman will nominate
student members to the existing
prototype community govern
ment at Stanford, the Commit
tee of Fifteen. This key group
was first organized two years
ago in answer to student com
plaints they had no voice in Uni
versity decisions. Although in
itially intended as a forum, it
soon emerged as a policy-mak
ing body on such issues as
liquor regulations and on-cam
pus worship.
The Legislature must give
majority vote approval to Ly
man's five nominees.
Lyman's statement on the stu
dent advisory committee to SES
will include recommendations
on the use of ASSU funds for

some kind of independent stu
dent approach to reforming
Stanford education.
Speaker Weinstein also plans
to ask the legislature, "What
are our goals this year?" He
will seek open discussion from
the floor.
Both he and Lyman have crit
icized the weak position of
ASSU in the University. Tonight
they plan to involve the legisla
ture in long-range change of
the student role at Stanford,
particularly concerning SES.
More immediate issues before
L A S S U include a by-laws
amendment introduced last
month to simplify the legisla
ture's committees. The amend
ment would refer all money
bills to the Finance Committee
without first coming on the floor
of the legislature. A two-thirds
majority must approve this
amendment for passage.
Weinstein is sponsoring this
"committee restructuring" be
cause he wants to speed up the
legislature's work. Tonight he
will assign one of the six-mem
ber "autonomous committees"
the amendment creates to the
community government study.
LASSU will also vote on a
proposal for a University-wide
referendum Nov. 8 on Stan
ford's challenged membership
in the National Student Associa
tion. Bob Rund, El Toro's repre
sentative, will introduce a reso
lution calling for a student con
sensus on whether Stanford
should "retain its membership."
At a legislature meeting Oct.

19 a bill to eliminate the ASSU
appropriation for NSA national
dues was defeated 22-17.
If the legislature approves a
referendum, and if a majority
of the students vote against
NSA, further action still would
be necessary to sever the Stan
ford-NSA connection. Since the
ASSU by-laws provide for Stan
ford's membership, Weinstein
said, the legislature would have
to pass a by-laws amendment
striking out the NSA passage by
a two-thirds vote.

response by ASSU President
Peter Lyman to Monday's invi
tation by the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES) that he
form a student advisory com
mittee to review SES recom
mendations.
Also at the 7:30 p.m. meeting
in Geology room 370, Speaker
Michael Weinstein will appoint
a special committee to study
"community government"
schemes. Community govern
ment would shift University
policy decisions to a legislature
representing students, faculty,
and administration.
Also, Lyman will nominate
student members to the existing
prototype community govern
ment at Stanford, the Commit
tee of Fifteen. This key group
was first organized two years
ago in answer to student com
plaints they had no voice in Uni
versity decisions. Although in
itially intended as a forum, it
soon emerged as a policy-mak
ing body on such issues as
liquor regulations and on-cam
pus worship.
The Legislature must give
majority vote approval to Ly
man's five nominees.
Lyman's statement on the stu
dent advisory committee to SES
will include recommendations
on the use of ASSU funds for

some kind of independent stu
dent approach to reforming
Stanford education.
Speaker Weinstein also plans
to ask the legislature, "What
are our goals this year?" He
will seek open discussion from
the floor.
Both he and Lyman have crit
icized the weak position of
ASSU in the University. Tonight
they plan to involve the legisla
ture in long-range change of
the student role at Stanford,
particularly concerning SES.
More immediate issues before
L A S S U include a by-laws
amendment introduced last
month to simplify the legisla
ture's committees. The amend
ment would refer all money
bills to the Finance Committee
without first coming on the floor
of the legislature. A two-thirds
majority must approve this
amendment for passage.
Weinstein is sponsoring this
"committee restructuring" be
cause he wants to speed up the
legislature's work. Tonight he
will assign one of the six-mem
ber "autonomous committees"
the amendment creates to the
community government study.
LASSU will also vote on a
proposal for a University-wide
referendum Nov. 8 on Stan
ford's challenged membership
in the National Student Associa
tion. Bob Rund, El Toro's repre
sentative, will introduce a reso
lution calling for a student con
sensus on whether Stanford
should "retain its membership."
At a legislature meeting Oct.

19 a bill to eliminate the ASSU
appropriation for NSA national
dues was defeated 22-17.
If the legislature approves a
referendum, and if a majority
of the students vote against
NSA, further action still would
be necessary to sever the Stan
ford-NSA connection. Since the
ASSU by-laws provide for Stan
ford's membership, Weinstein
said, the legislature would have
to pass a by-laws amendment
striking out the NSA passage by
a two-thirds vote.
Major proposals by student
leaders which could determine
the future role of the Associated
Students will come before the
legislature tonight.
The heavy agenda includes a
response by ASSU President
Peter Lyman to Monday's invi
tation by the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES) that he

mittee to review SES recom
mendations.
