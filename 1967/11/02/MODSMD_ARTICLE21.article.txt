### 
Twenty students met last
night in the office of Dean of
the Chapel B. Davie Napier to
formulate plans for a Peace
Vigil on the night of Saturday,
November 11.
The vigil will take place in
front of Memorial Church start
ing at 9 p.m., with an ecumen
ical service at midnight, led by
Dean Napier, Professor of Re
ligion Robert McAfee Brown,
and other campus ministers.
The planning group will begin
wearing white armbands today
to express their concern for the
VNietnam war and their desire
for peace. They hope to alert
the entire campus to the vigil
and are asking all supporters to
wear white armbands each day
until November 11.
