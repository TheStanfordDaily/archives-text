# Music Professors Praise Rock Bands
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
From high atop the Knoll,
Stanford's music professors are
responding enthusiastically to

pop music, be it soul music or
the Indian-inspired s}tar sounds
of George Harrison. Few of
them object to today's music,

and nearly all feel rock is be
coming more imaginative and
exploratory.
The most familiar and appre
ciated groups were the local
Jefferson Airplane and the omni
present Beatles. Most professors
had trouble identifying other
groups, but one quickly circled
the Byrds, Supremes, and Roll
ing Stones on a questionnaire.
Edward Colby, head of the mu
sic library, recently lectured on
"The Beatles, Bachwards and
Forwards." He praised them for
having "pioneered in develop
ing new media" in their imagi
native use of traditional "seri
ous" music, as well as in their
own successful creations.
Colby played selections from
Chopin related to "She's Leaving
Home," and demonstrated ba
roque trumpet in "Penny Lane,"
Roaring '20's vaudeville in
"When I'm 64," and chamber
music techniques in "Yester
day."
More sophisticated were the
Indian influences of Ravi Shan
kar in "Within You, Without
You" and the Stockhausen end
ing of "Day in the Life."
He said that the Beatles are
showing less and less depen
dence on their heavy, loud beat.
Their appeal has broadened to
include adults anxious to grasp
the message as well as the usual
teenage following.
The Sound
Colby also discussed groups
who are known for their
"sound." These are groups who
have "developed a sound of their
own and have become identified
with that sound.
He cited the Supremes as the
leading proponents of the melli
flous "Motown Sound." He spoke
of the long hours that Paul Re
vere and the Raiders spent in

the recording studio to perfect
one section of "Steppin' Out."
Professor Leonard Ratner
commented recently that the
"powerful impact and rhythmic
momentum "of pop music are
significant. This musical genre
"provides a framework for thou
sands of groups to make music
—it's a language that is commu
nal."
The great virtue of it is that
a few people with a guitar can
easily pick up a tune and play
it, he said. More people than
ever before are able to partici
pate in music.
East Meets West
He went on to point out that
although ornamentation - based
experimental music was once
the opposite of rhythm-based
pop music, the two may be mov
ing closer. The reason for this
shift lies in the expansion of mu
sical forms, particularly pop.
Ratner mentioned the Beatles'
Sargeant Pepper album as an
example of this growth, saying
it was "very imaginative,
though perhaps too manneris
tic."
Ratner criticized pop music
for being "too loud" but Profes
sor Earle Blew felt that "vol
ume" was one of the aspects he
liked best.
Colby commented on the "lip
sync" technique where perform
ers mouth their recordings on
TV and in concerts. This way,
he added, some groups may last
a lifetime "without the danger
of a live performance."
Concerts should be avoided at
all costs, he said, since they re
semble a night-time battle com
plete with screaming, groaning,
exploding flashbulbs, and the
bodies of fainting girls being
carried off to the first aid sta
tions.

riONEERS? — Edward Colby, music lecturer, praised the Beatles
as imaginative users of old and new forms.


CITES POWER — Prof. Leonard Ratner plays a few tunes to illus
trate the "powerful impact and rhythmic momentum of pop music."
From high atop the Knoll,
Stanford's music professors are
responding enthusiastically to

pop music, be it soul music or
the Indian-inspired s}tar sounds
of George Harrison. Few of
them object to today's music,

and nearly all feel rock is be
coming more imaginative and
exploratory.
The most familiar and appre
ciated groups were the local
Jefferson Airplane and the omni
present Beatles. Most professors
had trouble identifying other
groups, but one quickly circled
the Byrds, Supremes, and Roll
ing Stones on a questionnaire.
Edward Colby, head of the mu
sic library, recently lectured on
"The Beatles, Bachwards and
Forwards." He praised them for
having "pioneered in develop
ing new media" in their imagi
native use of traditional "seri
ous" music, as well as in their
own successful creations.
Colby played selections from
Chopin related to "She's Leaving
Home," and demonstrated ba
roque trumpet in "Penny Lane,"
Roaring '20's vaudeville in
"When I'm 64," and chamber
music techniques in "Yester
day."
More sophisticated were the
Indian influences of Ravi Shan
kar in "Within You, Without
You" and the Stockhausen end
ing of "Day in the Life."
He said that the Beatles are
showing less and less depen
dence on their heavy, loud beat.
Their appeal has broadened to
include adults anxious to grasp
the message as well as the usual
teenage following.
The Sound
Colby also discussed groups
who are known for their
"sound." These are groups who
have "developed a sound of their
own and have become identified
with that sound.
He cited the Supremes as the
leading proponents of the melli
flous "Motown Sound." He spoke
of the long hours that Paul Re
vere and the Raiders spent in

the recording studio to perfect
one section of "Steppin' Out."
Professor Leonard Ratner
commented recently that the
"powerful impact and rhythmic
momentum "of pop music are
significant. This musical genre
"provides a framework for thou
sands of groups to make music
—it's a language that is commu
nal."
The great virtue of it is that
a few people with a guitar can
