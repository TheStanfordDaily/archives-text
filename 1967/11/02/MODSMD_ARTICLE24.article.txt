## Fine 'Butterfly’ 
### RICHARD N. ATKINS PIERCE A. McNALLY 
Puccini with a flair greeted
the Palo Alto Community Thea
ter last weekend as the West
Bay Opera Company premiered
its twelfth season with a fine
performance of Madame Butter
fly. Let's face It; the Met it
wasn't. But we were, nonethe
less, shocked that a group of
opera amateurs could produce
such a relatively good show.
As Jan Riese, the company's
vivacious public relations officer,
told us after the performance:
"We've found this to be general
ly true. People do walk away
from here somewhat amazed.
They come into the theater in
many cases not knowing what
to expect as far as a perform
ance goes . . . and they are us
ually quite pleasantly sur
prised."
The story takes place around
1900 in Nagasaki, Japan. Fif
teen year old Geisha, Cio-Cio-
San, shows her husband-to-be,
American Navy Lieutenant B. F.
Pinkerton, her small treasures
while Sharpless, the American
Consul, looks on. Among her
possessions is a sheathed dagger
which, it is explained, was a gift
to her father from the Mikado
with a message forcefully indi
cating hara-kiri. "He obeyed,"
Butterfly confesses to her lover.
"Un bel di"
Shortly after the wedding,
however, Pinkerton is called
back to the States. Butterfly, al
most penniless, sings the beauti
ful "Un bel di" reaffirming her
belief in his eventual return; she
has borne Pinkerton's son dur
ing his absence.
Pinkerton does return but
brings with him his American
wife; the two wish to take the
child away with them. But Pink
erton cannot face Butterfly with
the truth and leaves. Butterfly
rushes in, looks everywhere for
Pinkerton, and, upon seeing his
wife in the courtyard, guesses
the horrible truth.
Left alone, Butterfly takes up
her father's dagger and reads

the inscription: "To die with
honor when one can no longer
live with honor." In a last tear
filled gesture Butterfly embraces
her child, plunges the dagger
homeward, and dies as Pinker
ton's guilt-ridded cries for for
giveness ring through the thea
ter.
No Orchestra
The company's lack of an or
chestra (they use two pianos)
did not detract from the many
good qualities of the show. The
audience however seemed to suf
fer from the dread San Francis
co disease (and how well we
know it after a season at the
War Memorial House) of ap
plausitis; they clapped for every
thing from curtain calls to
scene changes. There was even
a slight rumble as tenor Remy
Paquet cleared his throat in the
third act after missing some mi
nor note along the way.
Paquet as Pinkerton struck us
as being the most professional
singer with the group. His voice
was always full and clear with
many rich subtleties that only
a professional possesses. He told
us after the performance that
he plans to devote all his time
to singing from now on. And
good luck to him. We can cer
tainly think of one Macbeth he
could successfully replace in the
big leagues.
Dawn McClelland as Butterfly
has a pleasant voice though not
really refined. She tends to over
whelm the audience with her
somewhat overvolumed notes in
many places during the perform
ance. Obviously a well-rehearsed
number, "Un bel di" was sung
remarkably well until the very
last few words—the first bars
were even vaguely reminiscent
of the de los Angeles style.
Bravos to Anthony Cuevas for
a well sung Sharpless, to young
Simon R. Asato for a cute per
formance as the child, and espe
cially to Henry Holt, General
Director of Production and Mu
sical Director for a job well
done.
