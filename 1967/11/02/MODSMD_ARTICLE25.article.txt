# New Provost Studies Jobs

### JOHN R. ALCORN 
Dr. Robert M. Rosenzweig,
recently appointed associate pro
vost, has been given the respon
sibility of studying matters af
fecting the employment of
minority group members at Stan
ford.
Dr. Rosenzweig told the Daily
that Stanford is "an equal oppor
tunity employer," and does not
overtly discriminate in its em
ployment policy. But, he explain
ed, the real question is "does the
University actively seek out peo
ple from minority groups who
would not otherwise apply for
omployment at Stanford?"

Rosenzweig noted that the Uni
versity is doing several things
in order to actively establish a
fair employment policy. One of
ficial in the personnel office now
devotes half of his time to spe
cial employment problems con
cerning minority groups here at
Stanford.
In connection with this, the
personnel office is presently con
ducting a survey of employees
from minority groups. How
these people came to Stanford,
why they came here, and how
they have been treated as em
ployees of the University are
questions which Rosenzweig
hopes the survey will answer.
True Potential
"Once this survey is complet
ed," Rosenzweig emphasized,
"the personnel office will have
the information needed to pro
mote minority group members
based on their true potential."
He added that the University
would be able to help train peo
ple to do specific jobs in areas
where they are not yet profi
cient.
Until now, Rosenzweig stated,
there has been no discrimina
tion by the University, but there
have also been no "special ef
forts to identify people who have

the potential for higher level
work."
He hopes that when it becomes
known throughout the commu
nity that Stanford is a fair em
ployer and a good place to work,
more people from minority
groups will be attracted to work
for the University, and no "spe
cial efforts" will have to be taken
by the University to employ
minority group members.
Provost Concerned
In response to why an associ
ate provost had been given this
responsibility, Rosenzweig re
plied, "Provost Lyman (who ap
pointed him) is personally very
much concerned about civil
rights, and this appointment is
a reflection of his concern. What
is significant is that I was asked
to do the job, and by the way
was appointed as an associate
provost."
He emphasized that it is im
portant to distinguish between
the University as an employer
and the University as an educa
tional institution and is con
vinced that the problems of the
former role can be solved in the
near future.
He noted, however, that the
University as an educational in
stitution faces more complex
problems concerning "culturally
deprived" students and indicated
that a great deal of time and ef
fort will be needed to solve these
problems.
Rosenzweig also mentioned
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) subcommittee on re
cruitment, admissions, and finan
cial aid to minority group mem
bers, which is studying the treat
ment of people from minority
groups once they are on campus.
Major Step
This subcommittee will issue
a report sometime in the near
future, and Rosenzweig hopes
that it will be a major step to
wards eliminating some of the
problems facing minority group
members at Stanford.
In addition to his new appoint
ment as associate provost, Rosen
zweig remains director of Stan
ford's Center for Research in In
ternational Studies. Before his
appointment, he served as asso
ciate dean of the Graduate Divi
sion and lecturer in the Depart
ment of Political Science since
coming to Stanford in 1962.
He is a native of Detroit who
earned his bachelor's and mast
er's degrees at the University of
Michigan and his doctorate in
political science at Yale.
