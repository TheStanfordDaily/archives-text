# Negro Students Protest Emphasis On Athletics
## 
### 
Grambling College, a predom
inantly Negro school in Louisi
ana, expelled 22 students Mon
day, October 30, including the
student body president and the
editor of the student paper, for
participating In a six-day pro
test.
The protesters demanded that
the importance of athletics on
campus be decreased, that seven
administrators be dismissed,
and that President R. W. E.
Jones resign his position as base
ball coach.
Grambling, reputed for its ath
letic teams, is ranked academ
ically among the "lowest of Ne
gro colleges in the country," ac
cording to one faculty member.
The protest began on Wednes
day, October 25, when 1500 stu
dents out of the 4200 enrolled,

boycotted classes. At the end of
the week, a more violent tactic
was initiated, as students threw
dishes in the cafeteria and tossed
meat from the refrigerators
into the street. President Jones
asked Governor John McKeithen
Friday night to activate the
Louisiana National Guard
troops. The 500 guardsmen never
entered the campus, however,
but stood by at Ruston six miles
away.
Saturday, at the homecoming
football game, 1000 students re
fused to sit in the stands. The
homecoming queen's court also
joined the demonstrators.
Sunday night 3500 students
met in a rally and decided to con
tinue the strike until the admin
istration met their demands.
Expelled student body presi
dent, Willie Zanders, said, "This
is not Black Power. All we want
is an education and we aren't
getting it. You cannot get an
education now at Grambling."
