# Elections Nov. 8
## Students Vote '68 Yell Leader 
### HANK LIESE 
Stanford goes to the polls next
Wednesday to elect its BMOC,
(big mouth on campus), more
commonly referred to as head
yell leader.
Two voting booths, one near

the Post Office and another at
Engineering Corner, will be open
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The new yell leader, plus the
cheerleaders he has the privilege
of selecting, will usher in the
basketball season next month

and will hold his slot through
next year's football season.
Eight candidates are in the
running, ranging from Soul Man
to Silent Man to Spiderrhan.
Certain to carry Stanford's
Motown electorate is Scott

Keeney, a Delta Chi sophmore
running on a "soul" platform.
Keeny feels the band could
play a major part by joining in
the cheers, and is also anxious
to erase what he calls the "gold
en-haired, blue-eyed, Greek god"
image of cheerleaders.
At the moment, Keeney is "an
noyed at the rate my posters
have been torn down. Neverthe
less, he has already named his
five soul brothers: Art Wilson,
Harold Becks, Joe Bedford, Gary
Thompson, and Doug Cutting.
He has even written an an
swer to E. A. Poe's "The Raven"
and titled it 'The Keeney" (see
your local clutter-post) and
promises "several" surprises
this Monday and Tuesday.
No Longer Secret
Seeking a revolution in cheers
is Tim Llewellyn, a Kappa Sig
junior who has Joel McDon
ough as his former "secret run
ning mate."
His own poop-sheet reads:
"We have a voice in nearly all
other aspects of college life (ex
cept the draft, the Board of Trus
tees, the C.1.A., and a few oth
ers), why not in something as
unquestionably our own as in
cheers."
"Tim Llewellyn," it continues,
"has the gift of genius in lead
ing hosannas and hallelujahs."
(If he doesn't win the election,
maybe he could lead the choir.)

Spiderman T-shirts and post

Keeney's are pushing ahead the
Phi Kappa Sig sophmore's cam

Doug Pirnie, a junior from
Theta Chi, has so far solved the
problem of lost posters by not
putting his up yet.
"My basic reason for running,'
says Pirnie, "is to bring back a
little of the spirit which seems
so be lacking." He promises
"voodoo" and other novel cheers
and more coordination with the
band.
Nixes Poetry, Fishnet
Mike Snyder, a Theta Xi soph
more, doesn't write poetry or
wear fishnet under his armpits.
He hasn't done any active cam
paigning since the UCLA game.
Snyder feels that the present
cheerleaders take themselves
too sriously and is running more
or less as a protest against them.
"I'm not sure I could do better
than they, but I could try," Sny
der remarked. As for his silent

campaign, he says,"I don't want
to give the idea I'm going to do
something I'm not."
More Dollle Action
Nick Farwell and Tim Carpen
ter, cheerleaders with a year's
experience who are running for
head yell leader as a team, feel
that cheerleaders have to take
themselves seriously.
Farwell pointed out that cheer
leaders represent Stanford and
very often come into contact
with alumni. "Thus," Farwell
commented, "the idea of cheer
leading must be taken seriously,
but this doesn't prevent you
from having a little fun at the
games."
Both candidates are soph
mores and Alpha Sigs. They are
running as a team because they
feel there is not enough variety
with one man on the mike.
Farwell feels that the cheer
leaders must get the crowd more
involved, and he and Carpenter
suggest more stunts and more
participation by the band and
the dollies.
Bruce Malfait, a junior from
El Tigre, is a candidate out to
"ban the sounds of silence." He
could not be reached for further
comment.

Nick Farwell and Tim Carpen
ter, cheerleaders with a year's
experience who are running for
head yell leader as a team, feel
that cheerleaders have to take
themselves seriously.
Farwell pointed out that cheer
leaders represent Stanford and
very often come into contact
with alumni. "Thus," Farwell
commented, "the idea of cheer
leading must be taken seriously,
but this doesn't prevent you
from having a little fun at the
games."
Both candidates are soph
mores and Alpha Sigs. They are
running as a team because they
feel there is not enough variety
with one man on the mike.
Farwell feels that the cheer
leaders must get the crowd more
involved, and he and Carpenter
suggest more stunts and more
participation by the band and
the dollies.
Bruce Malfait, a junior from
El Tigre, is a candidate out to
"ban the sounds of silence." He
could not be reached for further
comment.
Stanford goes to the polls next
Wednesday to elect its BMOC,
(big mouth on campus), more
commonly referred to as head
yell leader.
Two voting booths, one near

the Post Office and another at
Engineering Corner, will be open
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The new yell leader, plus the
cheerleaders he has the privilege
of selecting, will usher in the
basketball season next month

and will hold his slot through
next year's football season.
Eight candidates are in the
running, ranging from Soul Man
to Silent Man to Spiderrhan.
Certain to carry Stanford's
Motown electorate is Scott

Keeney, a Delta Chi sophmore
running on a "soul" platform.
Keeny feels the band could
play a major part by joining in
the cheers, and is also anxious
to erase what he calls the "gold
en-haired, blue-eyed, Greek god"
image of cheerleaders.
At the moment, Keeney is "an
noyed at the rate my posters
have been torn down. Neverthe
less, he has already named his
five soul brothers: Art Wilson,
Harold Becks, Joe Bedford, Gary
Thompson, and Doug Cutting.
He has even written an an
swer to E. A. Poe's "The Raven"
and titled it 'The Keeney" (see
your local clutter-post) and
promises "several" surprises
this Monday and Tuesday.

Doug Pirnie, a junior from
Theta Chi, has so far solved the
problem of lost posters by not
putting his up yet.
"My basic reason for running,'
says Pirnie, "is to bring back a
little of the spirit which seems
so be lacking." He promises
"voodoo" and other novel cheers
and more coordination with the
band.
Nixes Poetry, Fishnet
Mike Snyder, a Theta Xi soph
more, doesn't write poetry or
wear fishnet under his armpits.
He hasn't done any active cam
paigning since the UCLA game.
Snyder feels that the present
cheerleaders take themselves
too sriously and is running more
or less as a protest against them.
"I'm not sure I could do better
than they, but I could try," Sny
der remarked. As for his silent

campaign, he says,"I don't want
to give the idea I'm going to do
something I'm not."
More Dollle Action
Nick Farwell and Tim Carpen
ter, cheerleaders with a year's
experience who are running for
head yell leader as a team, feel
that cheerleaders have to take
themselves seriously.
Farwell pointed out that cheer
leaders represent Stanford and
very often come into contact
with alumni. "Thus," Farwell
commented, "the idea of cheer
leading must be taken seriously,
but this doesn't prevent you
from having a little fun at the
games."
Both candidates are soph
mores and Alpha Sigs. They are
running as a team because they
feel there is not enough variety
with one man on the mike.
Farwell feels that the cheer
leaders must get the crowd more
involved, and he and Carpenter
suggest more stunts and more
participation by the band and
the dollies.
Bruce Malfait, a junior from
El Tigre, is a candidate out to
"ban the sounds of silence." He
could not be reached for further
comment.
Stanford goes to the polls next
Wednesday to elect its BMOC,
(big mouth on campus), more
commonly referred to as head
yell leader.
Two voting booths, one near

the Post Office and another at
Engineering Corner, will be open
from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
The new yell leader, plus the
cheerleaders he has the privilege
of selecting, will usher in the
basketball season next month

and will hold his slot through
next year's football season.
Eight candidates are in the
running, ranging from Soul Man
to Silent Man to Spiderrhan.
Certain to carry Stanford's
Motown electorate is Scott

Keeney, a Delta Chi sophmore
running on a "soul" platform.
Keeny feels the band could
play a major part by joining in
the cheers, and is also anxious
to erase what he calls the "gold
en-haired, blue-eyed, Greek god"
image of cheerleaders.
At the moment, Keeney is "an
noyed at the rate my posters
have been torn down. Neverthe
less, he has already named his
five soul brothers: Art Wilson,
Harold Becks, Joe Bedford, Gary
Thompson, and Doug Cutting.
He has even written an an
swer to E. A. Poe's "The Raven"
and titled it 'The Keeney" (see
your local clutter-post) and
promises "several" surprises
this Monday and Tuesday.
No Longer Secret
Seeking a revolution in cheers
is Tim Llewellyn, a Kappa Sig
junior who has Joel McDon
ough as his former "secret run
ning mate."
His own poop-sheet reads:
"We have a voice in nearly all
other aspects of college life (ex
cept the draft, the Board of Trus
tees, the C.1.A., and a few oth
ers), why not in something as
unquestionably our own as in
cheers."
