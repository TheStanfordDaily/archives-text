# Visit 'Inner City’
## Students See Poverty 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
This weekend, two dozen Stan
ford students will live for two
days and two nights in the heart
of San Francisco's Inner City.
They will wander down the
streets of Skid Row, talk with
Negroes from a ghetto "nobody
knows is there," visit bars in
the Tenderloin area with homo
sexuals as their guides, discuss
drug addiction with addicts. For
most of these white middle class
students, it will be the first ex
perience of what life is like in
the heart of an American city.
The Inner City Exploration
Trip, sponsored by the Univer
sity Christian Movement, is the
first of a two-weekend project
of confrontation with urban
problems and suburban values.
Project organizers have nick
named the program SMASH —
"Suburban - Metropolitan Anta
gonisms — Social Hiatus."
The combination program will
continue next week with a sur
vey of a middle-class suburb.
The program was sponsored
last year by the United Campus
Christian Ministry with the co
operation of the Office of Eco
nomic Opportunity in San Fran
cisco and coordinated by UCM
minister Richard Roe.
Inadequacy
Past participants consider the
experience a powerful one that
introduces the average student
to a world totally different from
his own. Several students ex
pressed a feeling of inadequacy
at confronting these problems.
"There was a feeling of a total
lack of understanding and com
munication," said one. "In a con
versation with a man on relief,
who was perfectly happy sitting
in a doorstep and had no other
ambition, you get a glimpse of
a set of values beyond your com
prehension. You say words, and
he says words, but you really
can't comprehend what he's talk
ing about. It's a frightening
feeling."
The program begins with a
night of discussion by workers
from the poverty program.
These are not social workers,
but people with experience in
the problems they are seeking
to solve — drug addicts, homo
sexuals, members of minority
groups, alcoholics. These dis
cussions serve as an initial orien
tation to urban problems. Many
students react defensively to
these discussions and to the at
titudes toward man and society
that the workers present. Dis
cussion afterwards helps to solve
some of the problems caused by
such reaction.
Confrontation
Saturday consists of a loosely
structured confrontation with
the Inner City. The students are
introduced to local geography—

ghetto areas, Skid Row, the
hemophile community — and
then are turned loose to wander,
talk to people, get a feeling for
the area, encounter some of the
people who until this time have
existed for them only as socio
logical abstractions.
Discussions with members of
the Society for Individual Rights
(SIR), a homophile organization,
with members of the community
of South Park, a Negro ghetto
of a few blocks holding over a
thousand people, and lunch at
St. Anthony's Kitchen, where
free meals are served daily, are
also included in Saturday's pro
gram.
Another World
"It's really a hard-hitting ex
perience," says one participant
in the last trip. "You come back
with a sense of another world,

of not knowing where to begin.
We all felt ill at the problems we
were most impressed with were
not theirs, but ours. It's the
white middle-class community
that needs to be educated before
these problems can be solved."
"More Stanford students need
to be confronted with these prob
lems," one student says. "Around
here we hear a lot of talk about
social problems by people who
regard them as statistics. Those
of us who went on the laat trip
have a different perspective now
about homosexuality, about wel
fare, about a lot of these issues.
It's only a limited beginning, but
this kind of first-hand knowledge
is essential if we're going to talk
about social issues."

regard them as statistics. Those
of us who went on the laat trip
have a different perspective now
about homosexuality, about wel
fare, about a lot of these issues.
It's only a limited beginning, but
this kind of first-hand knowledge
is essential if we're going to talk

Information about this trip
and subsequent ones can be ob

This weekend, two dozen Stan
ford students will live for two
days and two nights in the heart
of San Francisco's Inner City.
They will wander down the
streets of Skid Row, talk with
Negroes from a ghetto "nobody
knows is there," visit bars in
the Tenderloin area with homo
sexuals as their guides, discuss
drug addiction with addicts. For
most of these white middle class
students, it will be the first ex
perience of what life is like in
the heart of an American city.
The Inner City Exploration
Trip, sponsored by the Univer
sity Christian Movement, is the
first of a two-weekend project
of confrontation with urban
problems and suburban values.
Project organizers have nick
named the program SMASH —
"Suburban - Metropolitan Anta
gonisms — Social Hiatus."
The combination program will
continue next week with a sur
vey of a middle-class suburb.
The program was sponsored
last year by the United Campus
Christian Ministry with the co
operation of the Office of Eco
nomic Opportunity in San Fran
cisco and coordinated by UCM
minister Richard Roe.
Inadequacy
Past participants consider the
experience a powerful one that
introduces the average student
to a world totally different from
his own. Several students ex
pressed a feeling of inadequacy
at confronting these problems.
"There was a feeling of a total
lack of understanding and com
munication," said one. "In a con
versation with a man on relief,
who was perfectly happy sitting
in a doorstep and had no other
ambition, you get a glimpse of
a set of values beyond your com
prehension. You say words, and
he says words, but you really
can't comprehend what he's talk
ing about. It's a frightening
feeling."
The program begins with a
night of discussion by workers
from the poverty program.
These are not social workers,
but people with experience in
the problems they are seeking
to solve — drug addicts, homo
sexuals, members of minority
groups, alcoholics. These dis
cussions serve as an initial orien
tation to urban problems. Many
students react defensively to
these discussions and to the at
titudes toward man and society
that the workers present. Dis
cussion afterwards helps to solve
some of the problems caused by
such reaction.
Confrontation
Saturday consists of a loosely
structured confrontation with
the Inner City. The students are
introduced to local geography—

ghetto areas, Skid Row, the
hemophile community — and
then are turned loose to wander,
talk to people, get a feeling for
the area, encounter some of the
people who until this time have
existed for them only as socio
logical abstractions.
Discussions with members of
the Society for Individual Rights
(SIR), a homophile organization,
with members of the community
of South Park, a Negro ghetto
of a few blocks holding over a
thousand people, and lunch at
St. Anthony's Kitchen, where
free meals are served daily, are
also included in Saturday's pro
gram.

"It's really a hard-hitting ex

not theirs, but ours. It's the

that needs to be educated before
these problems can be solved."
