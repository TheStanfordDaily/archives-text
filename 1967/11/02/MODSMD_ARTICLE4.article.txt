## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Between 50 and 100 demon
strators protested Central In
telligence Agency interviews on
campus yesterday at Encina
Hall.
The demonstrators, members
of Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) and the Resist
ance, plan to resume protests
at 8 a.m. this morning. Twelve
more CIA interviews are sched
uled between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.
in Encina's west wing. Dem
onstrators also plan "continuous
debate on the CIA" for the En
cina lawn beginning at 9 a.m.
The protestors gained en
trance to the building at one
point during the morning, but
spent most of the time block
ing the front door of the build
ing's west wing.
Student police guarded the
locked door of the building's
West wing where J. Fred Win
ters of the CIA was conducting
job interviews.
Gain Entrance
About 9:45 several demonstra
tors climbed a fire escape and
through a third story window
where they danced and stomped
heavily in the room above that
used for interviewing.
Bruce Franklin, associate pro
fessor of English, who entered
the building, says he was con
fronted at one point by a plain
clothes policeman, Sgt. Carl
Gilitz, carrying a small object
with two holes in the front. It
was a teargas pen, which was
not issued as Stanford police
equipment, according to assist
ant police chief Tom Bell.
According to Franklin, Gielitz
said loudly, "Shall I let him have
it?" and associate dean of stu
dents Willard Wyman physi
cally spun the officer around to
prevent him from using the
chemical.
When Franklin tried to force
his way into the interviewing

room, Chief Bell grabbed his
shirt and closed the door.
Leave Building
The demonstrators left the
building when dean of students
Joel P. Smith told them their
presence constituted a violation
of a university regulation pro
hibiting demonstrations inside a
building. John Saari urged
demonstrators to force their
way into the interviewing room,
but they left the building with
out further incident.
Of the six interviews sched
uled for Wednesday morning,
three were held, one was re
scheduled, one was not held be
cause the student failed to show
up and one because the inter
viewee refused to enter any
place but the front door. After
noon interviews took place as
scheduled.
Yesterday's protest began at
eight o'clock when a small
group of students proceeded
from White Plaza to the main
door of Encina's west wing.
Marc Sapir gathered the group
together and obtained nine vol
unteers to sit-in in the building
if it were possible.
First Interview
SDS member Jack Gerson had
the first interview of the morn
ing with the CIA. When he was
ousted from the building, dem
onstrators unsuccessfully tried
to keep the door open. Gerson
explained that his regularly
scheduled interview had been
cut short when he questioned
the official about the ClA's pur
pose for hiring economists.
Gerson entered the interview
wearing a Mao Tse-tung button
on his jacket and "asked for a
general description of CIA and
its activities." The CIA repre
sentative, Gerson says, told him
to read about it in the library
and refused to answer ques
tions, saying Gerson was "mix
ing apples and bananas."

Mike Miller, another anti-CIA
interviewee, entered the build
ing with the demonstrators and
remained at the second floor
entrance awaiting his 10:30 in
terview. He then left the build
ing and moved to the main door
in front of the crowd of pro
testors.
Attempts To Enter
Attempts to push through the
door as it was opened for Miller
to enter were unsuccessful;
neither Miller nor any others
got in.
Several people sang and oth
ers, including Dave Harris, Re
sistance leader, talked on the
lawn.
Smith warned the students
blocking the front door that
their presence violated a uni
versity regulation because they

obstructed a normal entrance to
the building. He said the stu
dents would be identified and
disciplined if they persisted.
Williard Wyman, associate
dean of students, later offered
demonstrators to ask the CIA
official to come out and talk to
the demonstrators for half an
hour if they would agree to let
the interviews proceed after
that. Barry Greenberg, a leader
of the protest, said he thought
this wculd be acceptable but
Winters did not appear.
Protestors Disperse
Shortly after noon the pro
testers dispersed.
Dave Lischinsky, graduate
biology student who was being
interviewed at the time of the
third floor disturbance, says
Winters kept calm. When the
protesters' dancing shook the
ceiling, the two moved the desk
so the light fixture could not
fall on them. Lischinsky says
when questioned about the CIA,
the official said "You're here for
a job interview; we're not here
to talk politics."
The Stanford Young Republi

cans in a meeting last night
condemned "those who use
physical force" to demonstrate
against CIA recruiting on cam
pus.
The Executive board of the
Stanford YR's voted unanimous
ly to adopt the resolution, which
called on the university to dis
cipline those involved.
In related demonstrations yes

terday, three hundred students
at the University of California
at Santa Cruz claimed a victory
after four hours of demonstrat
ing yesterday when a U.S. Air
Force recruiting team failed to
show. University officials say
the visit had been postponed.
Roger Heyns, chancellor of
the University of California at
Berkeley, says that any students

interfering with CIA and Dow
Chemical Company job inter
views scheduled for Monday and
Tuesday will be placed on in
terim suspension.
In rallies Monday and Tues
day of this week Stanford SDS
spokesmen explained that they
were opposed to CIA interviews
on campus because the CIA was
designed to meddle in the affairs
of other governments. The
ClA's right to freedom of speech
on the campus has, according
to the protesters been forfeited
by the secret nature of the or
ganization.
University officials have up
held the right of groups with
diverse purposes and views to
conduct job interviews on cam
pus.

through a third story window
where they danced and stomped
heavily in the room above that

Bruce Franklin, associate pro
fessor of English, who entered
the building, says he was con
fronted at one point by a plain
clothes policeman, Sgt. Carl
Gilitz, carrying a small object
with two holes in the front. It
was a teargas pen, which was
not issued as Stanford police
equipment, according to assist
ant police chief Tom Bell.
According to Franklin, Gielitz
said loudly, "Shall I let him have
it?" and associate dean of stu
dents Willard Wyman physi
cally spun the officer around to
prevent him from using the
chemical.
When Franklin tried to force
his way into the interviewing

room, Chief Bell grabbed his
shirt and closed the door.
Leave Building
The demonstrators left the
building when dean of students
Joel P. Smith told them their
presence constituted a violation
of a university regulation pro
hibiting demonstrations inside a
building. John Saari urged
demonstrators to force their
way into the interviewing room,
but they left the building with
out further incident.
Of the six interviews sched
uled for Wednesday morning,
three were held, one was re
scheduled, one was not held be
cause the student failed to show
up and one because the inter
viewee refused to enter any
place but the front door. After
noon interviews took place as
scheduled.
Yesterday's protest began at
eight o'clock when a small
group of students proceeded
from White Plaza to the main
door of Encina's west wing.
Marc Sapir gathered the group
together and obtained nine vol
unteers to sit-in in the building
if it were possible.
First Interview
SDS member Jack Gerson had
the first interview of the morn
ing with the CIA. When he was
ousted from the building, dem
onstrators unsuccessfully tried
to keep the door open. Gerson
explained that his regularly
scheduled interview had been
cut short when he questioned
the official about the ClA's pur
pose for hiring economists.
Gerson entered the interview
wearing a Mao Tse-tung button
on his jacket and "asked for a
general description of CIA and
its activities." The CIA repre
sentative, Gerson says, told him
to read about it in the library
and refused to answer ques
tions, saying Gerson was "mix
ing apples and bananas."

Mike Miller, another anti-CIA
interviewee, entered the build
ing with the demonstrators and
remained at the second floor
entrance awaiting his 10:30 in
terview. He then left the build
ing and moved to the main door
in front of the crowd of pro
testors.
Attempts To Enter
Attempts to push through the
door as it was opened for Miller
to enter were unsuccessful;
neither Miller nor any others
got in.
Several people sang and oth
ers, including Dave Harris, Re
sistance leader, talked on the
lawn.
Smith warned the students
blocking the front door that
their presence violated a uni
versity regulation because they

obstructed a normal entrance to
the building. He said the stu
dents would be identified and
disciplined if they persisted.
Williard Wyman, associate
dean of students, later offered
demonstrators to ask the CIA
official to come out and talk to
the demonstrators for half an
hour if they would agree to let
the interviews proceed after
that. Barry Greenberg, a leader
of the protest, said he thought
this wculd be acceptable but
Winters did not appear.
Protestors Disperse
Shortly after noon the pro
testers dispersed.
Dave Lischinsky, graduate
biology student who was being
interviewed at the time of the
third floor disturbance, says
Winters kept calm. When the
protesters' dancing shook the
ceiling, the two moved the desk
so the light fixture could not
fall on them. Lischinsky says
when questioned about the CIA,
the official said "You're here for
a job interview; we're not here
to talk politics."
The Stanford Young Republi

cans in a meeting last night
condemned "those who use
physical force" to demonstrate
against CIA recruiting on cam
pus.
The Executive board of the

First Interview
SDS member Jack Gerson had
the first interview of the morn
ing with the CIA. When he was
ousted from the building, dem
onstrators unsuccessfully tried
to keep the door open. Gerson
explained that his regularly
scheduled interview had been
cut short when he questioned
the official about the ClA's pur
pose for hiring economists.
Gerson entered the interview
wearing a Mao Tse-tung button
on his jacket and "asked for a
general description of CIA and
its activities." The CIA repre
sentative, Gerson says, told him
to read about it in the library
and refused to answer ques
tions, saying Gerson was "mix
ing apples and bananas."

Mike Miller, another anti-CIA
interviewee, entered the build
ing with the demonstrators and
remained at the second floor

to enter were unsuccessful;
neither Miller nor any others

Smith warned the students
blocking the front door that
their presence violated a uni
versity regulation because they

obstructed a normal entrance to
the building. He said the stu
dents would be identified and
disciplined if they persisted.
Williard Wyman, associate
dean of students, later offered
demonstrators to ask the CIA
official to come out and talk to
the demonstrators for half an
hour if they would agree to let
the interviews proceed after
that. Barry Greenberg, a leader
of the protest, said he thought
this wculd be acceptable but
Winters did not appear.
Protestors Disperse
Shortly after noon the pro
testers dispersed.
Dave Lischinsky, graduate
biology student who was being
interviewed at the time of the
third floor disturbance, says
Winters kept calm. When the
protesters' dancing shook the
ceiling, the two moved the desk
so the light fixture could not
fall on them. Lischinsky says
when questioned about the CIA,
the official said "You're here for
a job interview; we're not here
to talk politics."
The Stanford Young Republi

West wing where J. Fred Win
ters of the CIA was conducting
job interviews.
Gain Entrance
About 9:45 several demonstra
tors climbed a fire escape and
through a third story window
where they danced and stomped
heavily in the room above that
used for interviewing.
Bruce Franklin, associate pro
fessor of English, who entered
the building, says he was con
fronted at one point by a plain
clothes policeman, Sgt. Carl
Gilitz, carrying a small object
with two holes in the front. It
was a teargas pen, which was
not issued as Stanford police
equipment, according to assist
ant police chief Tom Bell.
According to Franklin, Gielitz
said loudly, "Shall I let him have
it?" and associate dean of stu
dents Willard Wyman physi
cally spun the officer around to
prevent him from using the
chemical.
When Franklin tried to force
his way into the interviewing

room, Chief Bell grabbed his
shirt and closed the door.
Leave Building
The demonstrators left the
building when dean of students
Joel P. Smith told them their
presence constituted a violation
of a university regulation pro
hibiting demonstrations inside a
building. John Saari urged
demonstrators to force their
way into the interviewing room,
but they left the building with
out further incident.
Of the six interviews sched
uled for Wednesday morning,
three were held, one was re
scheduled, one was not held be
cause the student failed to show
up and one because the inter
viewee refused to enter any
place but the front door. After
noon interviews took place as
scheduled.
Yesterday's protest began at
eight o'clock when a small
group of students proceeded
from White Plaza to the main
door of Encina's west wing.
Marc Sapir gathered the group
together and obtained nine vol
unteers to sit-in in the building
if it were possible.
First Interview
SDS member Jack Gerson had
the first interview of the morn
ing with the CIA. When he was
ousted from the building, dem
onstrators unsuccessfully tried
to keep the door open. Gerson
explained that his regularly
scheduled interview had been
cut short when he questioned
the official about the ClA's pur
pose for hiring economists.
Gerson entered the interview
wearing a Mao Tse-tung button
on his jacket and "asked for a
general description of CIA and
its activities." The CIA repre
sentative, Gerson says, told him
to read about it in the library
and refused to answer ques
tions, saying Gerson was "mix
ing apples and bananas."

Mike Miller, another anti-CIA
interviewee, entered the build
ing with the demonstrators and
remained at the second floor
entrance awaiting his 10:30 in
terview. He then left the build
ing and moved to the main door
in front of the crowd of pro
testors.
Attempts To Enter
Attempts to push through the
door as it was opened for Miller
to enter were unsuccessful;
neither Miller nor any others
got in.
Several people sang and oth
ers, including Dave Harris, Re
sistance leader, talked on the
lawn.
Smith warned the students
blocking the front door that
their presence violated a uni
versity regulation because they

obstructed a normal entrance to
the building. He said the stu
dents would be identified and
disciplined if they persisted.
Williard Wyman, associate
dean of students, later offered
demonstrators to ask the CIA
official to come out and talk to
the demonstrators for half an
hour if they would agree to let
the interviews proceed after
that. Barry Greenberg, a leader
of the protest, said he thought
this wculd be acceptable but
Winters did not appear.
Protestors Disperse
Shortly after noon the pro
testers dispersed.
Dave Lischinsky, graduate
biology student who was being
interviewed at the time of the
third floor disturbance, says
Winters kept calm. When the
protesters' dancing shook the
ceiling, the two moved the desk
so the light fixture could not
fall on them. Lischinsky says
when questioned about the CIA,
the official said "You're here for
a job interview; we're not here
to talk politics."
The Stanford Young Republi

cans in a meeting last night
condemned "those who use
physical force" to demonstrate
against CIA recruiting on cam
pus.
The Executive board of the
Stanford YR's voted unanimous
ly to adopt the resolution, which
called on the university to dis
cipline those involved.
In related demonstrations yes

terday, three hundred students
at the University of California
at Santa Cruz claimed a victory
after four hours of demonstrat
ing yesterday when a U.S. Air
Force recruiting team failed to
show. University officials say
the visit had been postponed.
Roger Heyns, chancellor of
the University of California at
Berkeley, says that any students

interfering with CIA and Dow
Chemical Company job inter
views scheduled for Monday and
Tuesday will be placed on in
terim suspension.
In rallies Monday and Tues
day of this week Stanford SDS
spokesmen explained that they
were opposed to CIA interviews
on campus because the CIA was
designed to meddle in the affairs
of other governments. The
ClA's right to freedom of speech
on the campus has, according
to the protesters been forfeited
by the secret nature of the or
ganization.
University officials have up
held the right of groups with
diverse purposes and views to
conduct job interviews on cam
pus.
