# AFL-CIO Action
## Graduate Union Chartered 
### CLAUDIA WILKEN 
Stanford's newly formed 100-
member graduate student union
will soon receive its charter,
making it officially a local of
the American Federation of
Teachers (AFT) of the AFL
CIO.
The main weight of the un
ion's membership is in the hu
manities—especially English and
history—and in political science,
according to Andrew Moss,
graduate research assistant and
president of the union. Ten non
professional library employees
are also members.
There are no union members
from the business or engineer
ing departments.

When the group receives its
charter, which is expected with
in a week, it will "start being
more formal," Moss said. The
union will release a list of de
partmental representatives of
the union, and will consult with
the Dean of Graduate Students.
No Historical Parallel
An attempt at collective bar
gaining is not an immediate aim
of the union. Collective bargain
ing is "too loose a term," Moss
said, "It is a mistake to see in
the union a parallel to classical
labor history."
The union "wants to make de
mands for graduate students"
and would like to see a collective
bargaining agent sometime in

the future, but this is a "remote
prospect," according to Moss.
Also, not all the bargaining
that the union will want to d<-> Is
necessarily collective bargain
ing, in the sense of involving tho
whole University, Moss ex
plained. Some conditions that
might call for bargaining are set
by the individual departments
within the University.
The new union has not yet re
ceived any opposition or hos
tility from the faculty or admin
istration. "But," says Moss, "we
haven't been pushing very hard
yet. We don't expect opposition,
threats, or hostility, but non-co
operation." Moss claims, how
ever, that the group has heard
of some faculty and administra
tors that are very sympathetic
to their cause.
The union has not yet made a
policy statement of goals, be
cause it is now gathering infor
mation on what union members
want. Some of the suggested
topics according to Moss, are
higher pay and improved work
ing conditions for research and
teaching assistants. Improved
working conditions would in
clude such things as more office
space and a lighter working
load.
Specifically, the group would
like to encourage the passing of
a proposal for a $200 across the
board pay increase for teaching
assistants. This proposal was
brought up last year and turned
down, and is being proposed
again for next year.
Make Policies Public
Other preliminary goals are to
try to find out the administra
tion's policy on graduate stu
dents, and to bring the whole
structure of graduate student
pay scales into the open.
The union will also try to re
late with departmental graduate
student associations, and to en
courage the formation of these
associations, whether or not
they approve of the union.
The union "would like to hear
from anyone with information
on the condition of working
graduate students," Moss said.
Union organizers in certain de
partments, and in the libraries,
are also needed.
In other developments, the
APT announced last week the
start of a campaign to organize
locals at the California state
colleges. There will be union lo
cals on all 18 campuses by the
end of the month, according to
the national director of organi
zation for the teacher's unions.
The AFT expects to negotiate a
state-wide contract covering all
the campuses.

The AFT expects to negotiate a
state-wide contract covering all
the campuses.
Stanford's newly formed 100-
member graduate student union
will soon receive its charter,
making it officially a local of
the American Federation of
Teachers (AFT) of the AFL
CIO.
The main weight of the un
ion's membership is in the hu
manities—especially English and
history—and in political science,
according to Andrew Moss,
graduate research assistant and
president of the union. Ten non
professional library employees
are also members.
There are no union members
from the business or engineer
ing departments.

When the group receives its
charter, which is expected with
in a week, it will "start being
more formal," Moss said. The
union will release a list of de
partmental representatives of
the union, and will consult with
the Dean of Graduate Students.
No Historical Parallel
An attempt at collective bar
gaining is not an immediate aim
of the union. Collective bargain
ing is "too loose a term," Moss
said, "It is a mistake to see in
the union a parallel to classical
labor history."
The union "wants to make de
mands for graduate students"
and would like to see a collective
bargaining agent sometime in

the future, but this is a "remote
prospect," according to Moss.
Also, not all the bargaining
that the union will want to d<-> Is
necessarily collective bargain
ing, in the sense of involving tho
whole University, Moss ex
plained. Some conditions that
might call for bargaining are set
by the individual departments
within the University.
The new union has not yet re
ceived any opposition or hos
tility from the faculty or admin
istration. "But," says Moss, "we
haven't been pushing very hard
yet. We don't expect opposition,
threats, or hostility, but non-co
operation." Moss claims, how
ever, that the group has heard
of some faculty and administra
tors that are very sympathetic
to their cause.
The union has not yet made a
policy statement of goals, be
cause it is now gathering infor
mation on what union members
want. Some of the suggested
topics according to Moss, are
higher pay and improved work
ing conditions for research and
teaching assistants. Improved
working conditions would in
clude such things as more office
space and a lighter working
load.
Specifically, the group would
like to encourage the passing of
a proposal for a $200 across the
board pay increase for teaching
assistants. This proposal was
brought up last year and turned
down, and is being proposed
again for next year.
Make Policies Public
Other preliminary goals are to
try to find out the administra
tion's policy on graduate stu
dents, and to bring the whole
structure of graduate student
pay scales into the open.
The union will also try to re
late with departmental graduate
student associations, and to en
courage the formation of these
associations, whether or not
they approve of the union.
The union "would like to hear
from anyone with information
on the condition of working
graduate students," Moss said.
Union organizers in certain de
partments, and in the libraries,
are also needed.
In other developments, the
APT announced last week the
start of a campaign to organize
locals at the California state
colleges. There will be union lo
cals on all 18 campuses by the
end of the month, according to
the national director of organi
zation for the teacher's unions.
