# North Speech Hits Resource Shortage

### SUE NEIL 
Last night Dr. Robert C.
North made two projections of
possible future world conditions
in a talk on "The International
Political System," the fourth in
the Century 21 series.
Tomorrow night Century 21
will continue with a speech on
"The World Rule of Law," by
Dr. Louis B. Sohn, professor of
international law at Harvard, at
7:30 in Tresidder Lounge.
North's two projections were
antithetical, one pessimistic, the
other optimistic.
In the pessimistic one he pic
tured the world in a state of war
—either nuclear war, biological
war, worldwide conventional
war, ideological war, escalating
wars of national liberation, or
worst of all, a vast racial and
economic war. "Super-govern
ment, super - business, super
crime" would be among the
groups completely controlling
individual lives.
If we are to avoid this, he
stated, we must form an inter
national governmental system,
in which all armed forces are ob
solete or carefully controlled in
an international peace-keeping
organization. With increased
technology and use of cybernet
ics, citizens will have time to
participate in all levels of gov
ernment.
North spoke of three "key
variables to the future of man
kind." These are environmental
resources, size and density of
population, and "differential lev
els of technology." These three
are interdependent—a change in
one usually associated with a
change in the others.
He noted that a shortage of
resources often causes war,
which in turn necessitates dras
tic political, economic, and tech

nological re-organization. This
development can lead to more
uneven distribution of resources,
which in turn causes more con
flict.
Population pressure is more
dangerous today because there
is no more rich empty land for
nations to overflow into, North
said. He asserted that it is a
mistake to "indulge in petty
ideological wars" when these
"time bombs (population growth
and resource depletion) are tick
ing away."
North also analyzed the prop
erties of nation-states and the
tensions between them. He be
lieves that "nation-states ha v e
proved themselves a dangerous,
almost lethal," institution, only
a little better than anarchy.
"Regardless of ideology," he
said, the great powers always
measure the growth rates of
other great powers. The strong
est usually feels compelled to
support the status quo, while
the second strongest may take
the role of a challenger to it.
This generates tensions that are
increased as the weaker over
takes the stronger.
The strategy used to strength
en one's position is to increase
technological capability or to re
allocate resources. As this in
crease enters the military
sphere, it creates a continual
spiral of growing expenditures.
Tonight's speaker, Sohn, has
worked as a consultant for the
United Nations in the legal de
partment of the Secretariat and
in the Office of Legal Affairs.
He has been on the staff of
the Permanent Court of Inter
national Justice and of the Car
negie Endowment for Interna
tional Peace, and is presently a
member of the International
Law Association.

Political System," the fourth in
the Century 21 series.
Tomorrow night Century 21
will continue with a speech on
"The World Rule of Law," by
Dr. Louis B. Sohn, professor of
international law at Harvard, at
7:30 in Tresidder Lounge.
North's two projections were
antithetical, one pessimistic, the
other optimistic.
In the pessimistic one he pic
tured the world in a state of war
—either nuclear war, biological
war, worldwide conventional
war, ideological war, escalating
wars of national liberation, or
worst of all, a vast racial and
economic war. "Super-govern
ment, super - business, super
crime" would be among the
groups completely controlling
individual lives.
If we are to avoid this, he
stated, we must form an inter
national governmental system,
in which all armed forces are ob
solete or carefully controlled in
an international peace-keeping
organization. With increased
technology and use of cybernet
ics, citizens will have time to
participate in all levels of gov
ernment.
North spoke of three "key
variables to the future of man
kind." These are environmental
resources, size and density of
population, and "differential lev
els of technology." These three
are interdependent—a change in
one usually associated with a
change in the others.
He noted that a shortage of
resources often causes war,
which in turn necessitates dras
tic political, economic, and tech

nological re-organization. This
development can lead to more
uneven distribution of resources,
which in turn causes more con
flict.
Population pressure is more
dangerous today because there
is no more rich empty land for
nations to overflow into, North
said. He asserted that it is a
mistake to "indulge in petty
ideological wars" when these
"time bombs (population growth
and resource depletion) are tick
ing away."
North also analyzed the prop
erties of nation-states and the
tensions between them. He be
lieves that "nation-states ha v e
proved themselves a dangerous,
almost lethal," institution, only
a little better than anarchy.
"Regardless of ideology," he
said, the great powers always
measure the growth rates of
other great powers. The strong
est usually feels compelled to
support the status quo, while
the second strongest may take
the role of a challenger to it.
This generates tensions that are
increased as the weaker over
takes the stronger.
The strategy used to strength
en one's position is to increase
technological capability or to re
allocate resources. As this in
crease enters the military
sphere, it creates a continual
spiral of growing expenditures.
Tonight's speaker, Sohn, has
worked as a consultant for the
United Nations in the legal de
partment of the Secretariat and
in the Office of Legal Affairs.
He has been on the staff of
the Permanent Court of Inter
national Justice and of the Car
negie Endowment for Interna
tional Peace, and is presently a
member of the International
Law Association.
