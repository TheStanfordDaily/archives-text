## A 						Suggestion To SES: Let's Make Things Experimental 
### Bob Fishman 
The magnum opus recently
promulgated by the Steering
Committee of the Study of Edu
cation is as exciting as Web
ster's Unabridged Dictionary, as
profound as Reader's Digest, and
as radical as Ronald Reagan.
No one, at least, will ever
doubt that it was written by a
committee.
After a few cliches which pur
port to be the aims of under
graduate education, the Steer
ing Committee puts forth its so
called "recommendations for
sweeping changes."
These "sweeping changes"
must have been made with a
whiskbroom, since they leave
existing structures intact and
almost as dusty as before.

In general, the Steering Com
mittee follows this pattern: The
Study of Education at Stanford
giveth, and the Study taketh
away.
First, we are told that Stan
ford undergraduates "represent
the most intellectually able and
motivated segment of our popu
lation." Then we hear that it is
a mistake to force such students
to assimilate a prescribed body
of knowledge.
This seems to be a good argu
ment for questioning not only
the form but the concept of Gen
eral Studies. But read further:
Aim Carefully
"Mechanisms must be pro
vided to insure that the imma
ture do not wander aimlessly
through the university."

Therefore, the Committee con
cludes, the vast—and presuma
bly immature — majority must
continue to endure a General
Studies program with minor
modifications, while a select few
are admitted to a "University
Honors Program."
So much for our "intellectual
ly able and motivated" student
body.
Praise, Then Lamentations
Similarly, the Committee
voices a few retrained paens
praising independent study. But
evidently, SES does not believe
that the majority of Stanford
students are capable of profiting
from this sort of work.
They lament only that so few
students who graduated with
distinction had taken honors
work. As for the rest—you bet
ter go back to the lecture hall
and stop crowding my office.
Finally, the Committee reveals
its piece de resistance: the Ex
perimental College. This is a
small group of faculty and stu
dents who would do all the
things that SES rejected for the
rest of the campus.
Containment Policy
Whether this College would
be surrounded by guards and a
ten-foot fence was not made
clear. It was clear, however, that
the innovations of this College
would not be allowed to spread
to the rest of the campus until
they had been carefully reviewed
—perhaps by the next Study of
Education at Stanford.
The Steering Committee's rec
ommendations ignore what I be
lieve to be the major problem
facing Stanford education: the
vast disparity between the edu
cational experience of the top
students and the fate of those
whose GPA or motivation is low
er. A few undergraduates—and
generally the same undergradu
ates — participate in honors
programs, experimental houses,
directed reading and the like.
Are They Educated?
A far greater number never
get past the frat house and the
mass lecture. Most of this group
gains admission to graduate
schools, but whether they are
ever educated remains an open
question.
The SES program does a little
for those who are already being
educated, and almost nothing
for those who are not. It is true
that Stanford admissions leaves
something to be desired, but I
think that even Rixford Snyder
could — if he tried — select a
class whose members were cap
able of choosing their own
courses.
Why not admit the entire
freshman class to the "Univer
sity Honors Program" ? Why not
make individual work and edu
cational innovation part of every
student's Stanford experience?
It is time we made the whole
University an Experimental Col
lege.
