# A 						Business World
## 
### 
The business world and the university will
again attempt to communicate this year, thanks
to Motorola, Inc.
In yesterday's Daily Motorola's Board Chair
man Robert W. Galvin began the second
"round" of advertisements designed "to bring
into the open certain negative opinions con
cerning business."
The advertisements, printed in 29 univer
sity newspapers, make public an exchange of
letters between Galvin and one of four stu
dents nationwide. This year one of the stu
dents is a first year Stanford graduate majoring
in electrical engineering, Ralph Kimball.
We believe that without uttering a printed
word, Kimball has already run up against a
brick wall. For the second year in a row, Motor
ola's advertising agency has written a Galvin
letter laying down premises for discussion that
make dialogue with the student's genuinely
questioning business impossible.
Calvin, as so many businessmen, starts with
I he immovable premise that business represents
(lie very finest in the American tradition, that
.students who are properly respectful of business
find it so, and that anyone who does not agree
has not enough information about what busi
ness is really like. Last year this led to a most
inane and irrelevant exchange of meaningless
data, known as "round one" of the Motorola
dialogues.
But evidently even Galvin realizes this for he
says in his letter yesterday he has "no precise
indication that attitudes on campus toward
business have generally modified." Small won
der.
Galvin, or rather his ghost, cries out for

"factual information" to clear up all misunder
standings. Yet he states the series provides
him "with the opportunity to respond with
thoughts to back up my conviction that busi
ness most certainly contributes to society . . .
that it offers rewarding, exciting, and honorable
careers."
Convictions are one very important thing,
but so many businessmen will not admit busi
nesses might possibly be operated according to
some incorrect assumptions. Galvin admits
some negative attitudes toward business "are
based on existing imperfections in modern busi
ness." However, he immediately dismisses the
attitudes by stating "corporations are run by
people, and of course, people are subject to
errors in judgment."
If business is to have a serious dialogue with
the student, business leaders must acknowl
edge the changing values of many of today's
college students. No longer do the appeals of
personal wealth, prestige, and advancement
ring true for those Motorola is trying to reach
through their dialogue.
In an affluent society, students can look be
yond to what is really meaningful, not what is
really profitable. They demand their society
does the same. No longer do these youth seek
to hitch onto the establishment to seek success
in the establishment's terms. They seek a per
sonal success perceived by the self, and not
the society.
There are a few open and questioning busi
nessmen, and a few genuine expressions of con
cern within the business world. It is unfortu
nate Motorola, willing to commit extensive
funds to the dialogue program, could not evi
dence these concerns.
