## Rusk's Repartee Hardly Discussion 
### Tim Haight 
This week part of Dean Rusk's
speech to a group at Indiana
University was broadcast on
Huntley-Brinkley. Rusk was say
ing, "We are not in Vietnam be
cause of a civil war, but because
of infiltration and aid from
North Vietnam."
At this point a few people,
estimated at about 20 out of 3000
started to groan and heckle,
Rusk bore through it and final
ly, when the hecklers called "Ne
gotiations Now!" said, "I agree.
Now!" Great repartee. Another
bunch of demonstrators put
down.
A little later, Rusk again al
luded to those shouting in the
audience. "We will negotiate
with someone who can stop the
shooting. I'm not going to ne
gotiate with you."
This little interchange says a
lot. First, the news coverage —
indeed the only reason that film
clip made Huntley-Brinkley —
was because of the heckling.
That was the news. What was
not news was the Rusk is say
ing, again, that we are in Viet
nam because it is an invasion
from the North.
Is It True?
That is the good old rationa
lization of the American position.
But is it true? A strong case
can be made that the national
popularity of Ho Chi Minh, the
botch-up Diem made of the land
reform, and the favoritism and
distance from the people of the
Diem regime fostered a civil war.
Further, the statistics of the
current level of the Viet Cong,
without the North Vietnamese,
seem to indicate that their re
cruiting is keeping their num
bers relatively constant, in spite
of our kill figures. Could a to
tally unpopular force do that?
But what is in the news is
not a debate of this old point.
Perhaps, regardless of the fact
it underlies our Vietnam com
mitment, the "civil war" ques
tion is old hat. More likely, it's
just that what makes news to
day is not argument but demon
stration.
Subject Of Discussion
People aren't talking about the
war. They're talking about who's
for or against the war. It's as
if the school of philosophy that
sees discussion as the simulta-

neous ejaculation of unchanging
opinion has won.
And when all the people pay
attention to is form, rather than
content, can we blame those
who try more and more sensa
tional means to attract atten
tion? We do, though. We say
they're not being rational, order
ly, or legal.
But if they were, all that
would be on TV would be John
son's news conferences, the fu
tile UN, the Beverly Hillbillies,
Lawrence Welk, Star Trek, Lost
in Space, Mannix, and Shirley
Temple.
Toward The Back
Further, Rusk said, "I'm not
going to negotiate with you."
That could make a person feel
alienated. But, of course, Rusk
could not enter into a debate
with one of us. Our place is in
the audience, preferably toward
the back. Neither do we expect
the CIA to tell us what kind of
jobs we might get.
The government holds all the
chips. They can make news at
the drop of a press conference.
They have control of the means
of violence — to a degree that,
as long as the Army remains
loyal, makes revolution impos
sible. (This is a recent pheno
menon, so we can understand
some here on campus having a
sentimental attachment to vio
lent revolution. But it's absurd.)
What can we do? We cannot
adopt the usual liberal pose of
heart-rending guilt and ass-fat
tening torpor. But it is galling
to think that our side was a
foil for that myth-encrusted
bureaucrat in Indiana. We must
adopt a stance that does not al
low the shallow government lie,
to pick on our faults to jus
tify itself.

What can we do? We cannot
adopt the usual liberal pose of
heart-rending guilt and ass-fat
tening torpor. But it is galling
to think that our side was a
foil for that myth-encrusted
bureaucrat in Indiana. We must
adopt a stance that does not al
low the shallow government lie,
to pick on our faults to jus
tify itself.
This week part of Dean Rusk's
speech to a group at Indiana
University was broadcast on
Huntley-Brinkley. Rusk was say
ing, "We are not in Vietnam be
cause of a civil war, but because
of infiltration and aid from
North Vietnam."
At this point a few people,
estimated at about 20 out of 3000
started to groan and heckle,
Rusk bore through it and final
ly, when the hecklers called "Ne
gotiations Now!" said, "I agree.
Now!" Great repartee. Another
bunch of demonstrators put
down.
A little later, Rusk again al
luded to those shouting in the
audience. "We will negotiate
with someone who can stop the
shooting. I'm not going to ne
gotiate with you."
This little interchange says a
lot. First, the news coverage —
indeed the only reason that film
clip made Huntley-Brinkley —
was because of the heckling.
That was the news. What was
not news was the Rusk is say
ing, again, that we are in Viet
nam because it is an invasion
from the North.
Is It True?
That is the good old rationa
lization of the American position.
But is it true? A strong case
can be made that the national
popularity of Ho Chi Minh, the
botch-up Diem made of the land
reform, and the favoritism and
distance from the people of the
Diem regime fostered a civil war.
Further, the statistics of the
current level of the Viet Cong,
without the North Vietnamese,
seem to indicate that their re
cruiting is keeping their num
bers relatively constant, in spite
of our kill figures. Could a to
tally unpopular force do that?
But what is in the news is
not a debate of this old point.
Perhaps, regardless of the fact
it underlies our Vietnam com
mitment, the "civil war" ques
tion is old hat. More likely, it's
just that what makes news to
day is not argument but demon
stration.
Subject Of Discussion
People aren't talking about the
war. They're talking about who's
for or against the war. It's as
if the school of philosophy that
sees discussion as the simulta-

neous ejaculation of unchanging
opinion has won.
And when all the people pay
attention to is form, rather than
content, can we blame those
who try more and more sensa
tional means to attract atten
tion? We do, though. We say
they're not being rational, order
ly, or legal.
But if they were, all that
would be on TV would be John
son's news conferences, the fu
tile UN, the Beverly Hillbillies,
Lawrence Welk, Star Trek, Lost
in Space, Mannix, and Shirley
Temple.
Toward The Back
Further, Rusk said, "I'm not
going to negotiate with you."
That could make a person feel
alienated. But, of course, Rusk
could not enter into a debate
with one of us. Our place is in
the audience, preferably toward
the back. Neither do we expect
the CIA to tell us what kind of
jobs we might get.
The government holds all the
chips. They can make news at
the drop of a press conference.
They have control of the means
of violence — to a degree that,
as long as the Army remains
loyal, makes revolution impos
sible. (This is a recent pheno
menon, so we can understand
some here on campus having a
sentimental attachment to vio
lent revolution. But it's absurd.)

with one of us. Our place is in
the audience, preferably toward
the back. Neither do we expect
the CIA to tell us what kind of
jobs we might get.
The government holds all the
chips. They can make news at
the drop of a press conference.
They have control of the means
of violence — to a degree that,
as long as the Army remains
loyal, makes revolution impos
sible. (This is a recent pheno
menon, so we can understand
some here on campus having a
sentimental attachment to vio
lent revolution. But it's absurd.)
What can we do? We cannot
adopt the usual liberal pose of
heart-rending guilt and ass-fat
tening torpor. But it is galling
to think that our side was a
foil for that myth-encrusted
bureaucrat in Indiana. We must
adopt a stance that does not al
low the shallow government lie,
to pick on our faults to jus
tify itself.
