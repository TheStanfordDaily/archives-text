# Force: Only Way To Beat The System
## 
### STEVE WEISSMAN 
The nation-wide protests
against the CIA have raised
what might be the most import
ant intellectual issue to face uni
versity people in the past dec
ade.
Unfortunately, the liberal aca
demics who have blasted radical
demonstrations have so far
failed to tackle intellectually the
social analysis which justifies
these demonstrations.
Instead the critics have shown
a religious commitment to the
liberal orthodoxy laid down by
James Madison and John Stuart
Mill in a far different age.
The mechanical repetitiveness
and consistency of the critics'
arguments suggest that Ameri
ca is lar more bound by ideol
ogy than its historians have led
us to believe.
As intellectuals, the critics
(and their students) ought to
examine their own x-eligious be
lief in liberalism with the same
cold reasoning they apply to
their scholarship.
What are the assumptions be
hind a commitment to free
speech? Do those assumptions
fit present-day America?
As Herbert Marcuse argues
(The Critique of Pure Toler
ance, Beacon 1965), liberal tol
erance of free speech is based
on the assumption that progress

is possible through the unhind
ered competition of ideas.
In the liberal view, the public
is a group of autonomous, un
manipulated individuals, capable
of weighing all sides of a ques
tion and finding "truth." And
the minority (or at least their
ideas) have some hope of peace
fully converting the majority.
The situation in the United
States is quite different.
Here the ritualistic defense of
free speech only strengthens the
legitimacy of an oppressive
status quo.
The national administration
publicizes its tolerance of dis
sent as an example of the free
doms for which we are fighting
in Vietnam.
The existence of channels for
peaceful (and ineffective) civil
disobedience justifies condemn
ing those who would seek to
stop the draft forecably.
The insistence on civil politi
cal behavior—moderation— sup
ports criticism of ghetto dwell
ers who see that riots do better
their lives.
And closer to home, liberal
tolerance becomes defense of
the intolerable: "free speech"
for a foreign policy agency
which should be destroyed, re
cruiting "rights" for a napalm
producer, individual "rights" of
students to decide whether or

not they want to kill Vietna
mese.
These particular consequences
of liberal tolerance, though un
pleasant, are not in themselves
unexpected of illiberal. Free
markets, economic or intellect
ual, generally give way to mon
opolies.
The monopoly of resources in
the hands of industrialists, their
philanthropic foundations, the
State Department, the Pentagon
and the CIA guarantee their
domination of even the freest
academic marketplace. They are
the major buyers of ideas.
In fact, for their purposes,
hindrance of a free flow of ideas
within the system (such as Mc-
Carthyism) is inefficient.
The monopolized resources in
clude even our patterns of
thought. Free debate over for
eign policy, for example, has
generally operated in a very
confined context. Is the Alliance
for Progress or the Green
Berets the best way to stop
communism in Latin America?
Or, is Vietnam the right place
to draw the line?
Excluded here is the possibil
ity of openly supporting com
munist revolutions in Bolivia or
Vietnam. That, even among
doves, is unthinkable.
The responsibility for these

constraints rests heavily with
the CIA, which sponsors Cold
Warriors of the right, center
and left. They effectively estab
lish the limits of the debate and
the underlying assumptions.
And even this limited kind of
debating is filtered through the
fear that the dirty commies
might someday be landing in
San Diego.
These and similar prior limi
tations on free thought, and
therefore on free speech, render
the majority immune to radical
change.
These limitations affect no
less the protesting minority.
The Berkeley Free Speech Move
ment, for example, was caught
up in the thought patterns of
free speech, association and
petition. We were never able
to see that the real issue was
not free speech but power—who
would control the use of campus
facilities.
Similarly, few of us could
understand that the Sproul Hall
sit-in was not a petition to the
faculty but rather a simple re
sort to force.
We were trapped In liberal
orthodoxy and unable to see the
situation as it really »vas.
Given these monopolized and
manipulated thought patterns,
the assumptions behind a com
mitment to free speech do not
hold. Pretending that they do
distracts us from substantive
reality and denies to the minor
ity the means to promote neces
sary change.
Free speech will not undo
America's commitment to em

pire nor the underlying liberal
commitment to maintain an
open door to the underdeveloped
world for U.S. business.
The battlefield might be
moved from Vietnam to Laos,
but even that will depend more
on the Viet Cong than on dis
sent in the United States.
America might eliminate the
ghettos, but that, too, depends
on force: on the disruptions
caused by the ghetto-dwellers
themselves.
If the liberals who oppose
force in the name of free speech
disagree with this picture of
American reality, logically they
must show us either that
"things aren't so bad" or that
major change can come without
force.
In any case, reciting the lib
eral rosary does not fit with a
professed commitment to de
bate. To repeat "The Truth Will
Out" a thousand times will not
make that assertion true.
If, on the other hand, these
liberals are willing to question
their orthodoxy, they should
join with us.
Revolution is far off. But the
use of force could deny to the
established system the minds,
the bodies and the legitimacy
which universities now provide
it.

is possible through the unhind
ered competition of ideas.
In the liberal view, the public
is a group of autonomous, un
manipulated individuals, capable
of weighing all sides of a ques
tion and finding "truth." And
the minority (or at least their
ideas) have some hope of peace
fully converting the majority.
The situation in the United
States is quite different.
Here the ritualistic defense of
free speech only strengthens the
legitimacy of an oppressive
status quo.
The national administration
publicizes its tolerance of dis
sent as an example of the free
doms for which we are fighting
in Vietnam.
The existence of channels for
peaceful (and ineffective) civil
disobedience justifies condemn
ing those who would seek to
stop the draft forecably.
The insistence on civil politi
cal behavior—moderation— sup
ports criticism of ghetto dwell
ers who see that riots do better
their lives.
And closer to home, liberal
tolerance becomes defense of
the intolerable: "free speech"
for a foreign policy agency
which should be destroyed, re
cruiting "rights" for a napalm
producer, individual "rights" of
students to decide whether or

not they want to kill Vietna
mese.
These particular consequences
of liberal tolerance, though un
pleasant, are not in themselves
unexpected of illiberal. Free
markets, economic or intellect
ual, generally give way to mon
opolies.
The monopoly of resources in
the hands of industrialists, their
philanthropic foundations, the
State Department, the Pentagon
and the CIA guarantee their
domination of even the freest
academic marketplace. They are
the major buyers of ideas.
In fact, for their purposes,
hindrance of a free flow of ideas
within the system (such as Mc-
Carthyism) is inefficient.
The monopolized resources in
clude even our patterns of
thought. Free debate over for
eign policy, for example, has
generally operated in a very
confined context. Is the Alliance
for Progress or the Green
Berets the best way to stop
communism in Latin America?
Or, is Vietnam the right place
to draw the line?
Excluded here is the possibil
ity of openly supporting com
munist revolutions in Bolivia or
Vietnam. That, even among
doves, is unthinkable.
The responsibility for these

constraints rests heavily with
the CIA, which sponsors Cold
Warriors of the right, center
and left. They effectively estab
lish the limits of the debate and
the underlying assumptions.
And even this limited kind of
debating is filtered through the
fear that the dirty commies
might someday be landing in
San Diego.
These and similar prior limi
tations on free thought, and
therefore on free speech, render
the majority immune to radical
change.
These limitations affect no
less the protesting minority.
The Berkeley Free Speech Move
ment, for example, was caught
up in the thought patterns of
free speech, association and
petition. We were never able
to see that the real issue was
not free speech but power—who
would control the use of campus
facilities.
Similarly, few of us could
understand that the Sproul Hall
sit-in was not a petition to the
faculty but rather a simple re
sort to force.
We were trapped In liberal
orthodoxy and unable to see the
situation as it really »vas.
Given these monopolized and
manipulated thought patterns,
the assumptions behind a com
mitment to free speech do not
hold. Pretending that they do
distracts us from substantive
reality and denies to the minor
ity the means to promote neces
sary change.
Free speech will not undo
America's commitment to em

pire nor the underlying liberal
commitment to maintain an
open door to the underdeveloped
world for U.S. business.
The battlefield might be
moved from Vietnam to Laos,
but even that will depend more
on the Viet Cong than on dis
sent in the United States.
America might eliminate the
ghettos, but that, too, depends
on force: on the disruptions
caused by the ghetto-dwellers
themselves.
If the liberals who oppose
force in the name of free speech
disagree with this picture of
American reality, logically they
must show us either that
"things aren't so bad" or that
major change can come without
force.
In any case, reciting the lib
eral rosary does not fit with a
professed commitment to de
bate. To repeat "The Truth Will
Out" a thousand times will not
make that assertion true.
If, on the other hand, these
liberals are willing to question
their orthodoxy, they should
join with us.
Revolution is far off. But the
use of force could deny to the
established system the minds,
the bodies and the legitimacy
which universities now provide
it.

The monopoly of resources in

In fact, for their purposes,
hindrance of a free flow of ideas
within the system (such as Mc-

The monopolized resources in
clude even our patterns of
thought. Free debate over for

Excluded here is the possibil

The responsibility for these

These and similar prior limi

therefore on free speech, render
the majority immune to radical
change.
These limitations affect no

The Berkeley Free Speech Move
ment, for example, was caught
up in the thought patterns of
free speech, association and
petition. We were never able
to see that the real issue was
not free speech but power—who
would control the use of campus
facilities.
Similarly, few of us could
understand that the Sproul Hall
sit-in was not a petition to the
faculty but rather a simple re
sort to force.
We were trapped In liberal
orthodoxy and unable to see the
situation as it really »vas.
Given these monopolized and
manipulated thought patterns,
the assumptions behind a com
mitment to free speech do not
hold. Pretending that they do
distracts us from substantive
reality and denies to the minor
ity the means to promote neces
sary change.
Free speech will not undo
America's commitment to em

pire nor the underlying liberal
commitment to maintain an
open door to the underdeveloped
world for U.S. business.
The battlefield might be
moved from Vietnam to Laos,
but even that will depend more
on the Viet Cong than on dis
sent in the United States.
America might eliminate the
ghettos, but that, too, depends
on force: on the disruptions
caused by the ghetto-dwellers
themselves.
If the liberals who oppose
force in the name of free speech
disagree with this picture of
American reality, logically they
must show us either that
"things aren't so bad" or that
major change can come without
force.
In any case, reciting the lib
eral rosary does not fit with a
professed commitment to de
bate. To repeat "The Truth Will
Out" a thousand times will not
make that assertion true.
If, on the other hand, these
liberals are willing to question
their orthodoxy, they should
join with us.
Revolution is far off. But the
use of force could deny to the
established system the minds,
the bodies and the legitimacy
which universities now provide

The nation-wide protests

Unfortunately, the liberal aca

As Herbert Marcuse argues
(The Critique of Pure Toler

on the assumption that progress

is possible through the unhind

the minority (or at least their

The situation in the United
States is quite different.
Here the ritualistic defense of
free speech only strengthens the
legitimacy of an oppressive
status quo.
The national administration
publicizes its tolerance of dis

The existence of channels for
peaceful (and ineffective) civil
disobedience justifies condemn

stop the draft forecably.
The insistence on civil politi
cal behavior—moderation— sup
ports criticism of ghetto dwell
ers who see that riots do better
their lives.
And closer to home, liberal
tolerance becomes defense of
the intolerable: "free speech"
for a foreign policy agency
which should be destroyed, re

the CIA, which sponsors Cold
Warriors of the right, center
and left. They effectively estab
lish the limits of the debate and
the underlying assumptions.
And even this limited kind of
debating is filtered through the
fear that the dirty commies
might someday be landing in
San Diego.
These and similar prior limi
tations on free thought, and
therefore on free speech, render
the majority immune to radical
change.
These limitations affect no
less the protesting minority.
The Berkeley Free Speech Move
ment, for example, was caught
up in the thought patterns of
free speech, association and
petition. We were never able
to see that the real issue was
not free speech but power—who
would control the use of campus
facilities.
Similarly, few of us could
understand that the Sproul Hall
sit-in was not a petition to the
faculty but rather a simple re
sort to force.
We were trapped In liberal
orthodoxy and unable to see the
situation as it really »vas.
Given these monopolized and
manipulated thought patterns,
the assumptions behind a com
mitment to free speech do not
hold. Pretending that they do
distracts us from substantive
reality and denies to the minor
ity the means to promote neces
sary change.
Free speech will not undo
America's commitment to em

pire nor the underlying liberal
commitment to maintain an
open door to the underdeveloped
world for U.S. business.
The battlefield might be
moved from Vietnam to Laos,
but even that will depend more
on the Viet Cong than on dis
sent in the United States.
America might eliminate the
ghettos, but that, too, depends
on force: on the disruptions
caused by the ghetto-dwellers
themselves.
If the liberals who oppose
force in the name of free speech
disagree with this picture of
American reality, logically they
must show us either that
"things aren't so bad" or that
major change can come without
force.
In any case, reciting the lib
eral rosary does not fit with a
professed commitment to de
bate. To repeat "The Truth Will
Out" a thousand times will not
make that assertion true.
If, on the other hand, these
liberals are willing to question
their orthodoxy, they should
join with us.
Revolution is far off. But the
use of force could deny to the
established system the minds,
the bodies and the legitimacy
which universities now provide
it.
