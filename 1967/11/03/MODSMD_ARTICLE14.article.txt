# Poor Direction Mars ACT Play
## 
### THOMAS STOCKFISCH 
The American Conservatory
Theatre opened its second San
Francisco season Tuesday night
with an undistinguished per
formance of Shakespeare's
Twelfth Might.
The reasons for the failure
can be clearly assigned to the
director, William Ball. His
Twelfth Wight is noticeably lack
ing in the boldness of concep
tion which marked his Tiny
Alice and Siix Characters in
Search of an Author. In the ab
sence of siuch a unifying concep

tion, the play leaps back and
forth between two signposts, one
labeled "Slapstick," the other
"Saccharine." Ball has neither
reconciled the two, nor taken his
pick.
Of the many instances of
slapstick and buffoonery, Ken
Ruta's Malvolio is the most glar
ing. Ruta brings his usual thor
oughness to characterization, but
to little avail. Ball allows him to
go only from goon to goonier.
More heed than a black costume
must be paid to Malvolio's puri
tanism. And what of his self
righteousness and arrogance?

Are they merely more occasion
for foolishness?
Narrowness is also the down
fall of several characterizations.
Carol Mayo Jenkins is charm
ing as Olivia, but does not con
vey enough of the independence
and sanity (a necessary alterna
tive to # Orsino's mooning) which
characterize this countess. De
Ann Mears makes little or no
vocal or bodily effort toward a
male characterization of Cae
sario. Her blue eye shadow does
not aid the cause. In the final
scene she returns as Viola look
ing like something straight out
of Modern Bride.
These uni vocal renderings
have a way appealing to the pit,
where people like to be able to
identify their players without
sacrificing the price of a score
card; but they do little service
to the script.
The saccharine side of things

is frightfully enhanced by Con
rad Susa's musical score, which
I would describe as schmaltz
with pastoral relief. Curiously
inappropriate to an urban com
edy, it completely fails to give
life to Feste's songs. David
Grimm's lullabyish singing com
pounds the crime.
Single Setting
The production is staged in a
single setting which features
skeletonized patches of trees,
arbors, and designer Stuart
Wurtzel's Ã¼biquitous hanging
vines in front of a drop which
is variously illuminated to simu
late the changing colors of the
sky. This is a far cry from the
striking visual effects of Tiny
Alice and Six Characters; but
only be inspired by a director's
visual equivalents can, of course,
precise conception of the play
itself.
Mr. Ball has set precedents

which lead us to expect very
much from him, at times per
haps too much. We can only
hope that his massive respon
sibilities as general director of
the Conservatory will not hamp
er his ability to continue, as a
stage director, to extend the
frontiers of theatrical exper
ience.


A VACANT ROOM and its new occupant, portrayed by Carillo Gant
ner, occupy the attention of the building's caretaker (Ruth Hunt)
in Eugene lonesco's "The New Tenant" The play will run Novem
ber 24 at 8:30 p.m. in the Miedel Room at the Stanford Museum.
All tickets are $1.00 and are available by mail at Tresidder Memorial
