# Can Tribe Bounce Back?
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Stanford footballers will ans
wer an important question this
weekend at Washington. Do
they still have the stuff to win
after two straight heartbreak
ing losses?
The Huskies are always tough
in Seattle, but since 1958 Stan
ford has failed to beat Wash
ington anywhere.
Earlier this season the In
dians defeated Washington
State, ending a loss "jinx" with
that team that had extended to
1956.
This Time The Upset?
For two weeks in a row, Stan
ford has "nearly" pulled off the
big upset. A sell-out crowd of
55,000 is expected and a victory
over the 5-2 Huskies would in
deed be an upset.
Stanford, behind the passing
of Chuck Williams, did every
thing but win the ball game
against both UCLA and Army
in the last two outings.
Stanford has had the edge in
all departments for those two
contests, but statistics aren't
enough—and you can ask Wash
ington Coach Jim Owens about
that.
Against California last week,
Owens' team ran fewer plays,
had fewer first downs, and far
less passing yardage, but won
23-6.
Huskies Opportunistic
Washington defenders won
the game, picking off three pass
interceptions and recovering
three Bear fumbles.
This is a team for Stanford
to prepare well for, since the
Indians lost three passes and
three fumbles last week to
Army.
Stanford's offensive attack

has come alive in the last three
games. Chuck Williams' three
week ledger reads 539 yards
gaineo passing and 123 yards
rushing.
Gene Washington has been
the principal Williams target,
and has taken down 21 grabs
for 246 yards.
Huskies' Dogged Defense
Defense is traditionally the
Washington strong point, and

the Huskies have a bona fide
All-American in tackle Steve
Thompson.
Thompson's credentials are
outstanding. He's 6-5, 235, and
has won "Lineman-of-the-Game"
honors three times already this
season.
Offensively, Washington is
somewhat like UCLA, with
sophomore quarterback Tom
Manke running the sweep-op

tion series as sort of a "Poor
man's Gary Beban."
Five-Man Backfield
Manke has gained 284 yards
and 458 yards passing, and runs
what Jim Owens calls a "Five
man Backfield."
Owens has a fiankerback-split
end combination of Jim Cope
and Harris Wood that alternates
between the two positions.
Cope goes short for the
Huskies, and has caught 18
passes thus far, while Wood
specializes in the deep patterns.
To Cope With Wood
Wood has averaged 33 yards
a catch for 8 receptions, and
has scored four times.
Stanford might not see much
of Tom Sparlin, the man who
led the Huskies to a 41-6 victory
the last time Stanford visited
Seattle, as Sparlin is on the
bench behind Manke.
But the Indians can definitely

count on seeing Don M'artin.
Martin's kicking game is ;an in
tegral part of the Husky of
fense, and his field goa 1 last
year defeated Stanford with
only seconds remaining Kn the
game.
Indian Changes
Stanford Coach John Ralston
mulled over changes in both the
offense and defense this week,
and decided to make them.
Bill Nicholson replaces Doug
McKenzie at defensive I;ackle,
Stu Kellner supplants John
Haygood at linebacker, an does
Mike Carrigan over Pat Pres
ton. Bob Bittner fills in fojr John
de la Forest at middle guard.
On offense, Ralston still has
made no decision between
Howie Williams and Nate Kirt
man at halfback, but will re
place Mike Williard, who has a
slight neck injury, with Bob
Heffernan at guard.

One."

outstanding. He's 6-5, 235, and
has won "Lineman-of-the-Game"
honors three times already this
season.
Offensively, Washington is
somewhat like UCLA, with
sophomore quarterback Tom
Manke running the sweep-op

tion series as sort of a "Poor
man's Gary Beban."
Five-Man Backfield
Manke has gained 284 yards
and 458 yards passing, and runs
what Jim Owens calls a "Five
man Backfield."
Owens has a fiankerback-split
end combination of Jim Cope
and Harris Wood that alternates
between the two positions.
Cope goes short for the
Huskies, and has caught 18
passes thus far, while Wood
specializes in the deep patterns.
To Cope With Wood
Wood has averaged 33 yards
a catch for 8 receptions, and
has scored four times.
Stanford might not see much
of Tom Sparlin, the man who
led the Huskies to a 41-6 victory
the last time Stanford visited
Seattle, as Sparlin is on the
bench behind Manke.
But the Indians can definitely

count on seeing Don M'artin.
Martin's kicking game is ;an in
tegral part of the Husky of
fense, and his field goa 1 last
year defeated Stanford with
only seconds remaining Kn the
game.
Indian Changes
Stanford Coach John Ralston
mulled over changes in both the
offense and defense this week,
and decided to make them.
Bill Nicholson replaces Doug
McKenzie at defensive I;ackle,
Stu Kellner supplants John
Haygood at linebacker, an does
Mike Carrigan over Pat Pres
ton. Bob Bittner fills in fojr John
de la Forest at middle guard.
On offense, Ralston still has
made no decision between
Howie Williams and Nate Kirt
man at halfback, but will re
place Mike Williard, who has a
slight neck injury, with Bob
Heffernan at guard.

OOF! Stanford defender Don Parish gTapples with UCLA's Gary
Beban. Washington's sophomore quarterback Tom Manke, like
Beban, runs a lot of wide sweep and option piays. Hopefully the
Tribe can stop Manke more effectively than they did "The Great
One."
Stanford footballers will ans
wer an important question this
weekend at Washington. Do
they still have the stuff to win
after two straight heartbreak
ing losses?
The Huskies are always tough
in Seattle, but since 1958 Stan
ford has failed to beat Wash
ington anywhere.
Earlier this season the In
dians defeated Washington
State, ending a loss "jinx" with
that team that had extended to
1956.
This Time The Upset?
For two weeks in a row, Stan
ford has "nearly" pulled off the
big upset. A sell-out crowd of
55,000 is expected and a victory
over the 5-2 Huskies would in
deed be an upset.
Stanford, behind the passing
of Chuck Williams, did every
thing but win the ball game
against both UCLA and Army
in the last two outings.
Stanford has had the edge in
all departments for those two
contests, but statistics aren't
enough—and you can ask Wash
ington Coach Jim Owens about
that.
Against California last week,
Owens' team ran fewer plays,
had fewer first downs, and far
less passing yardage, but won
23-6.
Huskies Opportunistic
Washington defenders won
the game, picking off three pass
interceptions and recovering
three Bear fumbles.
This is a team for Stanford
to prepare well for, since the
Indians lost three passes and
three fumbles last week to
Army.
Stanford's offensive attack

has come alive in the last three
games. Chuck Williams' three
week ledger reads 539 yards
gaineo passing and 123 yards
rushing.
Gene Washington has been
the principal Williams target,
and has taken down 21 grabs
for 246 yards.
Huskies' Dogged Defense
Defense is traditionally the
Washington strong point, and

the Huskies have a bona fide
All-American in tackle Steve
Thompson.

OOF! Stanford defender Don Parish gTapples with UCLA's Gary
Beban. Washington's sophomore quarterback Tom Manke, like
Beban, runs a lot of wide sweep and option piays. Hopefully the
Tribe can stop Manke more effectively than they did "The Great
One."
Stanford footballers will ans
wer an important question this
weekend at Washington. Do
they still have the stuff to win
after two straight heartbreak
ing losses?
The Huskies are always tough
in Seattle, but since 1958 Stan
ford has failed to beat Wash
ington anywhere.
Earlier this season the In
dians defeated Washington
State, ending a loss "jinx" with
that team that had extended to
1956.
This Time The Upset?
For two weeks in a row, Stan
ford has "nearly" pulled off the
big upset. A sell-out crowd of
55,000 is expected and a victory
over the 5-2 Huskies would in
deed be an upset.
Stanford, behind the passing
of Chuck Williams, did every
thing but win the ball game
against both UCLA and Army
in the last two outings.
Stanford has had the edge in
all departments for those two
contests, but statistics aren't
enough—and you can ask Wash
ington Coach Jim Owens about
that.
Against California last week,
Owens' team ran fewer plays,
had fewer first downs, and far
less passing yardage, but won
23-6.
Huskies Opportunistic
Washington defenders won
the game, picking off three pass
interceptions and recovering
three Bear fumbles.
This is a team for Stanford
to prepare well for, since the
Indians lost three passes and
three fumbles last week to
Army.
Stanford's offensive attack

has come alive in the last three
games. Chuck Williams' three
week ledger reads 539 yards
gaineo passing and 123 yards
rushing.
Gene Washington has been
the principal Williams target,
and has taken down 21 grabs
for 246 yards.
Huskies' Dogged Defense
Defense is traditionally the
Washington strong point, and

the Huskies have a bona fide
All-American in tackle Steve
Thompson.
Thompson's credentials are
outstanding. He's 6-5, 235, and
has won "Lineman-of-the-Game"
honors three times already this
season.
Offensively, Washington is
somewhat like UCLA, with
sophomore quarterback Tom
Manke running the sweep-op

tion series as sort of a "Poor
man's Gary Beban."
Five-Man Backfield
Manke has gained 284 yards
and 458 yards passing, and runs
what Jim Owens calls a "Five
man Backfield."
Owens has a fiankerback-split
end combination of Jim Cope
and Harris Wood that alternates
between the two positions.
Cope goes short for the
Huskies, and has caught 18
passes thus far, while Wood
specializes in the deep patterns.
To Cope With Wood
Wood has averaged 33 yards
a catch for 8 receptions, and
has scored four times.
Stanford might not see much
of Tom Sparlin, the man who
led the Huskies to a 41-6 victory
the last time Stanford visited
Seattle, as Sparlin is on the
bench behind Manke.
But the Indians can definitely

count on seeing Don M'artin.
Martin's kicking game is ;an in
tegral part of the Husky of
fense, and his field goa 1 last
year defeated Stanford with
only seconds remaining Kn the
game.
Indian Changes
Stanford Coach John Ralston
mulled over changes in both the
offense and defense this week,
and decided to make them.
Bill Nicholson replaces Doug
McKenzie at defensive I;ackle,
Stu Kellner supplants John
Haygood at linebacker, an does
Mike Carrigan over Pat Pres
ton. Bob Bittner fills in fojr John
de la Forest at middle guard.
On offense, Ralston still has
made no decision between
Howie Williams and Nate Kirt
man at halfback, but will re
place Mike Williard, who has a
slight neck injury, with Bob
Heffernan at guard.
