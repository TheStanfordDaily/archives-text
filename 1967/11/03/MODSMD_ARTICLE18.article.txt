# Mini-Ax, Perfect Record At Stake With Cal Frosh
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
.The Stanford Papooses' bid
for an undefeated season will
undergo its final and hardest
test this Saturday, as the fresh
men meet the undefeated Cali
fornia Bear Cubs in a showdown
match at Berkeley.
The team is fresh from an
other come-from-behind victory,
as it downed the USC Trobabes
last Saturday, 18-17, after trail
ing 17-0 at halftime.
Ouch!
Unfortunately the Papooses
are ailing at several positions.
The defensive line is especially
hard-pressed by injuries.
Out for the year with a br ':en
arm is defensive end Mark
Heirero. Defensive tackles Tom
Jones and Larry Butler will also
probably miss the finale due to
knee ailments.
""The offense will have to do
without guard Jerry Sprout, and
once again the backfield will be
without a healthy Jack Schultz.
Schultz, who has gained over
400 yards in three games will

start, but he is still slightly in
capacitated due to a leg injury
sustained in the UCLA game.
However, quarterback Don
Bunce and his receivers, Jim
Haufman and Damea Washing
ton, are capable of putting the
Papooses on the scoreboard.
Despite injuries the Frosh de
fense has held up well. The line,
whom Coach Terry DeSylvia
compares with any frosh defen
sive line in the country when
healthy, has repeatedly been
tough in clutch situations.
In addition, the defensive sec
ondary has improved greatly the
last two games.
It will take an outstanding per
formance both offensively and
defensively to beat Berkeley. The
Cal Cubbies are well coached by
Jim Callum, and as a rule make
very few mistakes.
Virgin Defense
To get an idea as to just how
tough Cal is, they have trounced
UCLA and San Jose State by
scores of 29-0 and 61-0.
If there is any substance in

comparing scores, the Papooses
beat San Jose handily 41-12, but
squeaked by UCLA 21-20.
In relation to first half mis
takes in both the UCLA and USC
games, Coach DeSylvia said,
"the Frosh have yet to play a
complete football game."
Cal is a team that takes ad
vantage of errors. If the
Frosh are to end the year with
a 4-0 record, it will require such
a "complete football game" to
do it.

complete football game."
Cal is a team that takes ad
vantage of errors. If the
Frosh are to end the year with
a 4-0 record, it will require such
a "complete football game" to
do it.
.The Stanford Papooses' bid
for an undefeated season will
undergo its final and hardest
test this Saturday, as the fresh
men meet the undefeated Cali
fornia Bear Cubs in a showdown
match at Berkeley.
The team is fresh from an
other come-from-behind victory,
as it downed the USC Trobabes
last Saturday, 18-17, after trail
ing 17-0 at halftime.
Ouch!
Unfortunately the Papooses
are ailing at several positions.
The defensive line is especially
hard-pressed by injuries.
Out for the year with a br ':en
arm is defensive end Mark
Heirero. Defensive tackles Tom
Jones and Larry Butler will also
probably miss the finale due to
knee ailments.
""The offense will have to do
without guard Jerry Sprout, and
once again the backfield will be
without a healthy Jack Schultz.
Schultz, who has gained over
400 yards in three games will

start, but he is still slightly in
capacitated due to a leg injury
sustained in the UCLA game.
However, quarterback Don
Bunce and his receivers, Jim
Haufman and Damea Washing
ton, are capable of putting the
Papooses on the scoreboard.
Despite injuries the Frosh de
fense has held up well. The line,
whom Coach Terry DeSylvia
compares with any frosh defen
sive line in the country when
healthy, has repeatedly been
tough in clutch situations.
In addition, the defensive sec
ondary has improved greatly the
last two games.
It will take an outstanding per
formance both offensively and
defensively to beat Berkeley. The
Cal Cubbies are well coached by
Jim Callum, and as a rule make
very few mistakes.
Virgin Defense
To get an idea as to just how
tough Cal is, they have trounced
UCLA and San Jose State by
scores of 29-0 and 61-0.
If there is any substance in

comparing scores, the Papooses
beat San Jose handily 41-12, but
squeaked by UCLA 21-20.
In relation to first half mis
takes in both the UCLA and USC
games, Coach DeSylvia said,
"the Frosh have yet to play a
complete football game."
