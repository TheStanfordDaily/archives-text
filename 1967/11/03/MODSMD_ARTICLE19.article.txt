## Water Poloists Host USC, LBS 
### 
USC water poloists get a shot
at avenging a 9-8, fourth over
time, sudden death loss to Stan
ford when the Trojans invade
Encina Pool at 3:30 p.m. today.
Long Beach State, who demol
ished USC early in the year,
takes on the Indians at 10 a.m.
Saturday.
Stanford and USC slogged
through two hours of competi
tion before John Parker settled
the score in Stanford's favor
last weekend in Los Angeles.
The Indians broke men open
enough to run up a five goal
margin, but the shots just didn't
materialize.
Coach Jim Gaughran has
changed the Indian's offensive
pattern to take better advantage
of the Cards superior speed. Un
til now, the Cards used Mark

Parmely and occasionally Gary
Sheerer as post men in the hole,
feeding a breaking pattern to
wards the goal.
Bust Your Buns
Gaughran has abandoned the
hole temporarily, and has ori
ented the whole pattern to a con
stant fast break. The Cards,
with five NCAA swimming rec
ord holders in the lineup con
stantly blasting, should be able
to break a man open for a free
shot.
The constant pressure-motion
is also likely to draw a penalty
shot in front of the goal.
Long Beach State destroyed
USC earlier this year, skating to
a 10-1 lead before the second
string finished the job. Bob
Saari, who went to the Olympics
under coach Uhro Saari, and

Jerry Ray will be big threats
from a set-up position in the
hole.
Traditional Squeaker
In 1963, Stanford edged Long
Beach 9-8 before a capacity
crowd in the Encina Pool to pin
down the collegiate champion

ship. The last time Long Beach
came here, in 1965, Stanford
again squeaked out a double
overtime victory.
Stanford needs a victory over
USC to solidify the Indians'
grasp of the second spot in the
conference. UCLA has virtually

wrapped up the college cham
pionship.
Frosh
The Stanford frosh, fresh from
a pair of victories over Palo
Alto High and De Anza JC last
weekend, play after each of the
varsity contests.

varsity contests.
USC water poloists get a shot
at avenging a 9-8, fourth over
time, sudden death loss to Stan
ford when the Trojans invade
Encina Pool at 3:30 p.m. today.
Long Beach State, who demol
ished USC early in the year,
takes on the Indians at 10 a.m.
Saturday.
Stanford and USC slogged
through two hours of competi
tion before John Parker settled
the score in Stanford's favor
last weekend in Los Angeles.
The Indians broke men open
enough to run up a five goal
margin, but the shots just didn't
materialize.
Coach Jim Gaughran has
changed the Indian's offensive
pattern to take better advantage
of the Cards superior speed. Un
til now, the Cards used Mark

Parmely and occasionally Gary
Sheerer as post men in the hole,
feeding a breaking pattern to
wards the goal.
Bust Your Buns
Gaughran has abandoned the
hole temporarily, and has ori
ented the whole pattern to a con
stant fast break. The Cards,
with five NCAA swimming rec
ord holders in the lineup con
stantly blasting, should be able
to break a man open for a free
shot.
The constant pressure-motion
is also likely to draw a penalty
shot in front of the goal.
Long Beach State destroyed
USC earlier this year, skating to
a 10-1 lead before the second
string finished the job. Bob
Saari, who went to the Olympics
under coach Uhro Saari, and

Jerry Ray will be big threats
from a set-up position in the
hole.
Traditional Squeaker
In 1963, Stanford edged Long
Beach 9-8 before a capacity
crowd in the Encina Pool to pin
down the collegiate champion

ship. The last time Long Beach
came here, in 1965, Stanford
again squeaked out a double
overtime victory.
Stanford needs a victory over
USC to solidify the Indians'
grasp of the second spot in the
conference. UCLA has virtually

wrapped up the college cham
pionship.
Frosh
The Stanford frosh, fresh from
a pair of victories over Palo
Alto High and De Anza JC last
weekend, play after each of the
varsity contests.
