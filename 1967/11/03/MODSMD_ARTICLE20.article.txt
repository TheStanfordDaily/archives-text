# Cross Country Team To Get High At Lake Tahoe (Gasp!)
## 
### 
The Stanford cross-country
team travels to South Tahoe
this Saturday to test their abil
ity at high altitudes. The race
course is at 6200 feet, and is ex
pected to provide experience for
this year's NCAA champion
ships at Wyoming.
Three Stanford harriers, Greg
Brock, Dave Redwine, and
Chuck Menz, ran last year as
freshmen in the high altitude
race. They finished third behind
the University of Utah and Ida
ho State varsities. Brock finished
12th followed by Menz 19th and
Redwine 23rd.
Fast Top Four
The varsity team consisting of
Greg Brock, Allen Sanford,
Brook Thomas, Jim Letterer,

Dave Redwine, and Chuck Menz
has a strong chance to place
high in the team championship
because the scoring will be on
the basis of a four man team.
The Indians are strong
through their first four men,
but, because of injuries, have
been plagued with a large gap
between the fourth and fifth
men. Most races are scored on
the basis of the top five men.
.Running for the Frosh at Ta
hoe will be Don Kardong, Dun
can Mac Donald, Jay Rice, Brian
Cox, Mark Jones, and Pete Fair
child.
Don Kardong and Dun Mac-
Donald, who have been leading
the Frosh, expect competition
from Jay Rice. Rice hails from

Susanville, California, which is
over a mile high.
The athletes will undergo tests
again this year to determine the
effects of high altitude running
on sea level trained athletes ver
sus altitude trained runners.
