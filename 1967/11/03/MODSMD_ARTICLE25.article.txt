Yes, Virginia, there is a 1967
Big Game Gaieties. It is called
Wumberiogue. It opens next Fri
day night.
Wumberiogue is Ram's Head's
57th annual contribution to the
fun and frolics of Big Game
Week.
For 52 of those 57 years
Gaieties was a revue, a collec
tion of skits satirizing Stanford
life in general. Four Gaieties
productions have been full
length "book shows" satirizing
Stanford life in general.
According to producer Bob
Stone, "Wumberiogue is with
out a doubt different from all
previous Gaieties productions. It
is, however, still Gaieties and
will play a significant part in
the tradition surrounding Big
Game."
Director Alan Mokler com
mented, "It's a good show, per
haps the best we've ever done.
The cast and crews have really
worked hard on this one, and
that itself is an indication that
Wumberiogue has something

special to offer. We're in the last
week now, and the spirit every
one is showing is really beau
tiful."
Tickets for all four perfor
mances of Wumberlognue are
available from the TMU box of
fice and from Ram's Head's tick
et booth in front of the post of
fice.


Stan Rutherford, the Wumberlogpue, the world's only Wumberlogue

house, looks on admiringly. "Wumberlofirue" opens one week from
today. Tickets are available from the box office and in front of the
post office.
