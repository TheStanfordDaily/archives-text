# Undergraduate Special Seminars: Eleven Ways To Earn Easy Credit
## 
### MARY HAGAN 
How to make an instant genu
ine credit type seminar: Find
two or three friends (ordinary
undergraduates may be substi
tuted), find one willing faculty
member, and choose a topic,
almost any topic.
Stanford students have been
given the opportunity to set up
their own Undergraduate Spe
cial Seminars. Taken for one to
three units credit, these courses
are student initiated and con-

ducted on any topic of mutual
interest. This fall eleven such
courses are being offered.
The Undergraduate Specials
for this quarter include such di
verse topics as "Ethics in Busi
ness," "Studies in Mao Tse
Tung," "Workshop in Social
Drama," "Motivation of Educa
tion in Depressed Areas." and
"Conflict and Its Resolution."
The deadline for approval of
winter quarter specials is De
cember 16. However, since copy

for the Time Schedule has
already been approved, only one
of these courses, "Myth and
Opera," will be listed. Notice of
all other Seminars will appear
in the Daily.
Many of the seminars have
been organized by campus living
groups. In these cases residents
are limited to 50 per cent of the
enrollment.
Only a minimum of paper
work is needed to set up a
course. Information required by
the Committee on Undergradu
ate Education includes the name
of the faculty member teaching
the course, title of the course,
a two or three sentence descrip
tion, the number of units, and
the enrollment limit. This infor
mation should be sent to Robert
Hind, Room 107, Law Annex.
In the past all requests for
special seminars have been ap
proved as long as they met the
above requirements. Hind said
the primary reason for rejection
of applications has been the fail
ure of students to choose a
member of the University fac
ulty as instructor for the course.
He went on to say that profes
sors have been "very receptive"
when approached by students,

and the committee "will be glad
to help in finding likely people
to teach."
Two other types of Under
graduate Specials are available
to students this year. The orig
inal model is seminars estab
lished by the faculty designed
to give undergraduates the
chance to take a course from
the faculty of the University's
professional schools. These
courses are all numbered below
150, with numbers above 150 in
dicating student initiated sem
inars.
This spring, for instance, a
course in "Human Sexuality"
will be offered under this pro
gram. Four courses of this type
are being given this quarter.
This year only, students may
take Seminar 199: University
Problems. Sponsored by SES
and ASSU, it has been or
ganized to study questions be
fore the Study of Education at
Stanford.
The four winter specials may
be signed up for in the SES
office. They are "Government of
the University," "University Fi
nancing," "Interaction of Re
search and Education," and a
study of living groups. Enroll
ment is limited to 20 people.
