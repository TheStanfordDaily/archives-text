# Unitarian Group Takes Stand In Favor Of Draft Resistance
## 
### JAN WELLS 
Twenty local clergymen have
signed a resolution of support
for conscientious objectors and
draft resistors.
The resolution was passed
October 30 by the Bay Area Uni
tarian Universalist Ministers As
sociation, of which Michael
Young, a Stanford campus min
ister, is president.
The statement reads in part:
"We have become increasingly
outraged by the immorality of
our national policy in Vietnam;
"We sense that a growing
number of youth today are as
suming moral leadership by ac
tions which reflect their desire
to relate effectively commitment
and behavior; . . .
"We shall regard it as a major
professional obligation to ex
press our views in this matter
as forthrightly as possible. We
will give to the youth our ex
plicit and continual support in
their refusal to participate in a
military system which they feel
to be immoral. And we shall en
deavor to inform them fully of
their rights as American citi
zens to implement their con
scientious stand.

"... If our support of these
youth violates Selective Service
law or results in their actions
in violation of local regulations,
then we consider ourselves
equally guilty with those who
by their courageous and non
violent acts are subjected to
persecution.
"We wish to acknowledge our
indebtedness and sense of com
munity with those person's who,
recognizing that the individual
conscience of a human being is
the final seat of authority for be
lief and action, have by non-vio
lent acts of civil disobedience
done so much to awaken us and
other Americans to the call for
a moral and religious response
to this central issue which faces
our land."
According to Young, the min
isters have all been involved with
counselling conscientious objec
tors. The resolution represents
their determination "not just to
feel the commitment, but to com
mit the action to back it up."
Reverend Young commented,
"For all practical purposes a
young man becomes a part of
the military establishment on his
18th birthday. When a man is ar

rested he must legally be ap
praised of his rights, but when
a young man reaches eighteen,
he is told nothing."
Young predicted that most
signers will "be on the line on
December 4 and 16, although
whether or not they will com
mit civil disobedience is up to
each man's own conscience."

indebtedness and sense of com
munity with those person's who,
recognizing that the individual
conscience of a human being is
the final seat of authority for be
lief and action, have by non-vio
lent acts of civil disobedience
done so much to awaken us and
other Americans to the call for
a moral and religious response
to this central issue which faces
our land."
According to Young, the min
isters have all been involved with
counselling conscientious objec
tors. The resolution represents
their determination "not just to
feel the commitment, but to com
mit the action to back it up."
Reverend Young commented,
"For all practical purposes a
young man becomes a part of
the military establishment on his
18th birthday. When a man is ar

rested he must legally be ap
praised of his rights, but when
a young man reaches eighteen,
he is told nothing."
Young predicted that most
signers will "be on the line on
December 4 and 16, although
whether or not they will com
mit civil disobedience is up to
each man's own conscience."
Twenty local clergymen have
signed a resolution of support
for conscientious objectors and
draft resistors.
The resolution was passed
October 30 by the Bay Area Uni
tarian Universalist Ministers As
sociation, of which Michael
Young, a Stanford campus min
ister, is president.
The statement reads in part:
"We have become increasingly
outraged by the immorality of
our national policy in Vietnam;
"We sense that a growing
number of youth today are as
suming moral leadership by ac
tions which reflect their desire
to relate effectively commitment
and behavior; . . .
"We shall regard it as a major
professional obligation to ex
press our views in this matter
as forthrightly as possible. We
will give to the youth our ex
plicit and continual support in
their refusal to participate in a
military system which they feel
to be immoral. And we shall en
deavor to inform them fully of
their rights as American citi
zens to implement their con
scientious stand.

"... If our support of these
youth violates Selective Service
law or results in their actions
in violation of local regulations,
then we consider ourselves
equally guilty with those who
by their courageous and non
violent acts are subjected to
persecution.
"We wish to acknowledge our
indebtedness and sense of com
munity with those person's who,
recognizing that the individual
conscience of a human being is
the final seat of authority for be
lief and action, have by non-vio
lent acts of civil disobedience
