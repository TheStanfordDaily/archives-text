# Proposition P Put On ASSU Ballot
## 
### 
The Legislature of the Asso
ciated Students voted last night
to place two questions concern
ing the war in Vietnam before
the student body in the Novem
ber 8 elections.
One is Proposition P, the pro
posal presently on the ballot in
San Francisco urging immediate
withdrawal of U.S. troops from
Vietnam. The other supports the
Peace Vigil to be held November
11 in Memorial Church, calling
it a "reasonable" way to show
"a deep concern for peace in
Vietnam."
The action came after a reso
lution supporting the vigil was
squelched. A majority of the
representatives still present
overturned Speaker Mike Wein
stein's ruling that such a resolu
tion did not violate the ASSU
By-laws section banning the

Legislature from taking a stand
on off-campus Issues.
Proposition P was placed on
the ballot because legislators
felt the statement supporting
the peace vigil would not yield
a clear-cut expression of cam
pus opinion on the issue of the
Vietnam war.
Next year's head cheerleader
and off-campus representatives
for Legislature will also be
chosen in the Nov. 8 elections.
Earlier the Legislature de
cided to postpone appointing
student members to the tri-par
tite Committee of 15 until the
nominees could reply in writ
ing to a series of questions
posed by legislators. The ques
tions would ask the positions of
the nominees on several current
campus issues. Five students
were nominated by ASSU Presi
dent Peter Lyman, and three
others by the Legislature.
In a report to the body, Lyman
said that the Committee of 15
(Cl 5), where students sit as
bonafide members, should be a
model for all university com
mittees.
He strongly criticised the re
cently-proposed faculty senate
for not including students as full
members. Lyman also attacked
the present structure of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) where students are
viewed as "free-lance intellec
tuals" rather than representa
tives of the student body. Lyman
called the SES "a model of bur
eaucratic government, which is
probably the last form of govern
ment a university should have."
He recommended the Legisla
ture appoint a special committee
on community government. One
purpose of the committee, Ly
man said, would be to make pro
posals to the SES on commun
ity government. He said the SES
committee on university gov
ernment, on which he serves,
has asked him to make such pro
posals.
Speaker Weinstein appointed
the following Legislature mem
bers to the committee: Steve Mc-
Millan, chairman; David Brown,
Vonria Crause. Dennis Rut
kins, Jon Kottke, Robert Davis,
and Gail Anderson.
jL.yina.ii a nominations to the
Committee of 15 were John Ras
kin, Maureen Colbates, Tom For
stenzer, Dell Martin, and Steve
McMillan. Raskin, a senior is
chairman of Judicial Council,

Colbates is a graduate student
in Political Science and a mem
ber of the AFT, the local union
of teaching assistants.
Forstenzer a graduate student
in History is a former speaker
of the Legislature. Martin and
McMillan are sponsors. McMil
lan is Legislative Laison Officer
for the ASSU.
Other Nominees
In addition to Lyman's nom
inees, Mike Weinstein, Eric
Treisman and Fritz Schaeffer
were nominated by the Legisla
ture.
In other action, the Legisla
ture voted down an attempt to
put the question of Stanford's
membership in the National
Student Association (NSA) on
the November ballot.
ASSU Vice-president Cesare
Massarenti reported that jazz
musician Nat Coleman cancelled
a scheduled appearance at Stan-

ford because of racial discrim
ination Coleman believed he en
countered during a brief stay on
campus. Massarenti refused to
elaborate further on the dis
crimination.
Craig Brown, current head
yell leader, was named Elec
tions Commission chairman for
the remainder of the year.
The motions to place the two
questions relating to the Viet
nam war came at the very end
of the meeting.

Church November 11, will in
clude speeches about the Viet
nam war by Rev. B. Davie
Napier and several students. Ly
man, in his report, urged the
body to adopt some form of
resolution supporting the vigil.

the present structure of the

probably the last form of govern

He recommended the Legisla

on community government. One
purpose of the committee, Ly

committee on university gov

TEXT OF PEACE VIGIL
RESOLUTION
We, the Associated Students
of Stanford University sup
port the activities and intent
of the Peace Vigil of Novem
ber 11-12, said Intent being: to
show in a reasonable way a
deep concern for peace in Viet
nam.
TEXT OF PROPOSITION P
Shall it be the policy of the
city and county of San Fran
cisco that there be an imme
diate cease fire and withdraw
al of U.S. troops from Viet
nam so that the Vietnamese
people can settle their own
problems?
The Legislature of the Asso
ciated Students voted last night
to place two questions concern
ing the war in Vietnam before
the student body in the Novem
ber 8 elections.
One is Proposition P, the pro
posal presently on the ballot in
San Francisco urging immediate
withdrawal of U.S. troops from
Vietnam. The other supports the
Peace Vigil to be held November
11 in Memorial Church, calling
it a "reasonable" way to show
"a deep concern for peace in
Vietnam."
The action came after a reso
lution supporting the vigil was
squelched. A majority of the
representatives still present
overturned Speaker Mike Wein
stein's ruling that such a resolu
tion did not violate the ASSU
By-laws section banning the

Legislature from taking a stand
on off-campus Issues.
Proposition P was placed on
the ballot because legislators
felt the statement supporting
the peace vigil would not yield
a clear-cut expression of cam
pus opinion on the issue of the
Vietnam war.
Next year's head cheerleader
and off-campus representatives
for Legislature will also be
chosen in the Nov. 8 elections.
Earlier the Legislature de
cided to postpone appointing
student members to the tri-par
tite Committee of 15 until the
nominees could reply in writ
ing to a series of questions
posed by legislators. The ques
tions would ask the positions of
the nominees on several current
campus issues. Five students
were nominated by ASSU Presi
dent Peter Lyman, and three
others by the Legislature.
In a report to the body, Lyman
said that the Committee of 15
(Cl 5), where students sit as
bonafide members, should be a
model for all university com
mittees.
He strongly criticised the re
cently-proposed faculty senate
for not including students as full
members. Lyman also attacked
the present structure of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) where students are
viewed as "free-lance intellec
tuals" rather than representa

TEXT OF PEACE VIGIL
RESOLUTION
We, the Associated Students
of Stanford University sup
port the activities and intent
of the Peace Vigil of Novem
ber 11-12, said Intent being: to
show in a reasonable way a
deep concern for peace in Viet
nam.
TEXT OF PROPOSITION P
Shall it be the policy of the
city and county of San Fran
cisco that there be an imme
diate cease fire and withdraw
al of U.S. troops from Viet
nam so that the Vietnamese
people can settle their own
problems?
The Legislature of the Asso
ciated Students voted last night
to place two questions concern
ing the war in Vietnam before
the student body in the Novem
ber 8 elections.
One is Proposition P, the pro
posal presently on the ballot in
San Francisco urging immediate
withdrawal of U.S. troops from
Vietnam. The other supports the
Peace Vigil to be held November
11 in Memorial Church, calling
it a "reasonable" way to show
"a deep concern for peace in
Vietnam."
The action came after a reso
lution supporting the vigil was
squelched. A majority of the
representatives still present
overturned Speaker Mike Wein
stein's ruling that such a resolu
tion did not violate the ASSU
By-laws section banning the

Legislature from taking a stand
on off-campus Issues.
Proposition P was placed on
the ballot because legislators
felt the statement supporting
the peace vigil would not yield
a clear-cut expression of cam
pus opinion on the issue of the
Vietnam war.
Next year's head cheerleader
and off-campus representatives
for Legislature will also be
chosen in the Nov. 8 elections.
Earlier the Legislature de
cided to postpone appointing
student members to the tri-par
tite Committee of 15 until the
nominees could reply in writ
ing to a series of questions
posed by legislators. The ques
tions would ask the positions of
the nominees on several current
campus issues. Five students
were nominated by ASSU Presi
dent Peter Lyman, and three
others by the Legislature.
In a report to the body, Lyman
said that the Committee of 15
(Cl 5), where students sit as
bonafide members, should be a
model for all university com
mittees.
He strongly criticised the re
cently-proposed faculty senate
for not including students as full
members. Lyman also attacked
the present structure of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) where students are
viewed as "free-lance intellec
tuals" rather than representa
tives of the student body. Lyman
called the SES "a model of bur
eaucratic government, which is
probably the last form of govern
ment a university should have."
He recommended the Legisla
ture appoint a special committee
on community government. One
purpose of the committee, Ly
man said, would be to make pro
posals to the SES on commun
ity government. He said the SES
committee on university gov
ernment, on which he serves,
has asked him to make such pro
posals.
Speaker Weinstein appointed
the following Legislature mem
bers to the committee: Steve Mc-
Millan, chairman; David Brown,
Vonria Crause. Dennis Rut
kins, Jon Kottke, Robert Davis,
and Gail Anderson.
jL.yina.ii a nominations to the
Committee of 15 were John Ras
kin, Maureen Colbates, Tom For
stenzer, Dell Martin, and Steve
McMillan. Raskin, a senior is
chairman of Judicial Council,

Colbates is a graduate student
in Political Science and a mem
ber of the AFT, the local union
of teaching assistants.
Forstenzer a graduate student
in History is a former speaker
of the Legislature. Martin and
McMillan are sponsors. McMil
lan is Legislative Laison Officer
for the ASSU.
Other Nominees
In addition to Lyman's nom
inees, Mike Weinstein, Eric
Treisman and Fritz Schaeffer
were nominated by the Legisla
ture.
In other action, the Legisla
ture voted down an attempt to
put the question of Stanford's
membership in the National
Student Association (NSA) on
the November ballot.
