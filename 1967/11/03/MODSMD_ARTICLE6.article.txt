# Century 21 Speech
## Sohn Urges 'World Rule Of Law' 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
Louis B. Sohn, Professor of
International Law at Harvard
urged the replacement of world
rule of force by the rule of law
in last night's Century 21 talk.
Speaking in Tresidder Union,
Sohn said a world rule of law
will be necessary for the main
tenance of peace in the future.
He stated many of the prob

lems faced today are the result
of the lack of proper educa
tional preparation in the 1930'5.
Sohn also pointed out that many
of today's leaders received their
education in the isolationist at
mosphere of pre-World War II
United States.
Therefore, Sohn said, we must
prepare today for the problems
of Century 21. He noted future

problems will, in all probability,
be even more complex than those
we face today.
Professor Sohn envisions three
basic problems in the accom
plishment of this world rule of
law. The first is the problem of
universality. In order for any
world government to be effective
there must be universality of
membership. The exclusion of

major powers from the United
Nations is a serious problem,
Sohn continued. He cited the
result of the United States' ab
sence from the League of Na
tions as proof of the importance
of universality.
Sohn said It seemed to him
"we made a serious mistake in
1945 when we did not say that
membership in the United Na
tions was a duty and an obliga
tion of every state, not a priv
ilege given to well-behaving na
tions.
"It is an obligation to belong
and to be bound by the resolu
tion of the community. The
United Nations can not function
properly without the presence of
the major powers of Asia and
Europe," he added.
Red China Cited
Professor Sohn mentioned
Communist China and East and
West Germany as examples of
such non-participation. He sug
gested the "problem" of recog
nition was not as serious as it
seemed since the Arabs and
Israel have managed to exist in
the same body.
The second problem we face
in the creation of a world rule
of law is the "balance of power
with responsibility," he said.
Professor Sohn noted the ma
jority of the General Assembly
of the United Nations is "in the
hands of a group of small, de
veloping countries. It is not
likely they will agree to relin
quish the power which they
have thus acquired."
One suggestion Sohn made
was that an executive commit
tee of the General Assembly be
formed to implement Assembly
decision. This committee would
be made up of the larger pow
ers, who would decide whether
to enforce the decisions of the
body as a whole.
A second posibility would be
to change the present voting
procedure. Votes would be
weighted according to the rela
tive power of each country and
its contribution to the U.N.
A final alternative would be

the creation of a second assem
bly whose membership would
be based on population rather
than political units.
The final problem in the at
tainment of world rule through
law would be the enforcement
of international laws.
Sohn emphasized that the con
flict between these nations who
have the balance of power and
the so-called super-powers must
be solved before a world rule
of law can be established. He
recommended several alterna
tive ways of easing this con
flict.
Ideally, of course, enforcement
would not be necessary if all na
tions would accede to the deci
sions of a world court. Sohn
pointed out, however, that realis
tically some sort of peacekeeping
force would be necessary. He
suggested the maintenance of
a force of 5,000 to 10,000 troops
who would be available on short
notice.
Inherent in this problem of
enforcement is disarmament.
Sohn said that general and com
plete disarmament would be es
sential for an ideal Century 21.
Sohn concluded by saying an
integrated plan of action was
necessary for the achievement
of world rule under law rather
than force.

would not be necessary if all na

LOUIS B. SOHN
Louis B. Sohn, Professor of
International Law at Harvard
urged the replacement of world
rule of force by the rule of law
in last night's Century 21 talk.
Speaking in Tresidder Union,
Sohn said a world rule of law
will be necessary for the main
tenance of peace in the future.
He stated many of the prob

lems faced today are the result
of the lack of proper educa
tional preparation in the 1930'5.
Sohn also pointed out that many
of today's leaders received their
education in the isolationist at
mosphere of pre-World War II
United States.
Therefore, Sohn said, we must
prepare today for the problems
of Century 21. He noted future

problems will, in all probability,
be even more complex than those
we face today.
Professor Sohn envisions three
basic problems in the accom
plishment of this world rule of
law. The first is the problem of
universality. In order for any
world government to be effective
there must be universality of
membership. The exclusion of

major powers from the United
Nations is a serious problem,
Sohn continued. He cited the
result of the United States' ab
sence from the League of Na
tions as proof of the importance
of universality.
Sohn said It seemed to him
"we made a serious mistake in
1945 when we did not say that
membership in the United Na
tions was a duty and an obliga
tion of every state, not a priv
ilege given to well-behaving na
tions.
"It is an obligation to belong
and to be bound by the resolu
tion of the community. The
United Nations can not function
properly without the presence of
the major powers of Asia and
Europe," he added.
Red China Cited
Professor Sohn mentioned
Communist China and East and
West Germany as examples of
such non-participation. He sug
gested the "problem" of recog
nition was not as serious as it
seemed since the Arabs and
Israel have managed to exist in
the same body.
The second problem we face
in the creation of a world rule
of law is the "balance of power
with responsibility," he said.
Professor Sohn noted the ma
jority of the General Assembly
of the United Nations is "in the
hands of a group of small, de
veloping countries. It is not
likely they will agree to relin
quish the power which they
have thus acquired."
One suggestion Sohn made
was that an executive commit
tee of the General Assembly be
formed to implement Assembly
decision. This committee would
be made up of the larger pow
ers, who would decide whether
to enforce the decisions of the
body as a whole.
A second posibility would be
to change the present voting
procedure. Votes would be
weighted according to the rela
tive power of each country and
its contribution to the U.N.
A final alternative would be

the creation of a second assem
bly whose membership would
be based on population rather
than political units.
The final problem in the at
tainment of world rule through
law would be the enforcement
of international laws.
Sohn emphasized that the con

the same body.
The second problem we face
in the creation of a world rule
of law is the "balance of power
with responsibility," he said.
Professor Sohn noted the ma
jority of the General Assembly
of the United Nations is "in the
hands of a group of small, de
veloping countries. It is not
likely they will agree to relin
quish the power which they
have thus acquired."
One suggestion Sohn made
was that an executive commit
tee of the General Assembly be
formed to implement Assembly
decision. This committee would
be made up of the larger pow
ers, who would decide whether
to enforce the decisions of the
body as a whole.
A second posibility would be
to change the present voting
procedure. Votes would be
weighted according to the rela
tive power of each country and
its contribution to the U.N.
A final alternative would be

the creation of a second assem
bly whose membership would
be based on population rather
than political units.
The final problem in the at
tainment of world rule through
law would be the enforcement
of international laws.
Sohn emphasized that the con
flict between these nations who
have the balance of power and
the so-called super-powers must
be solved before a world rule
of law can be established. He
recommended several alterna
tive ways of easing this con
flict.
Ideally, of course, enforcement
would not be necessary if all na
tions would accede to the deci
sions of a world court. Sohn
pointed out, however, that realis
tically some sort of peacekeeping
force would be necessary. He
suggested the maintenance of
a force of 5,000 to 10,000 troops
who would be available on short
notice.
Inherent in this problem of
enforcement is disarmament.
Sohn said that general and com
plete disarmament would be es
sential for an ideal Century 21.
Sohn concluded by saying an
integrated plan of action was
necessary for the achievement
of world rule under law rather
than force.
