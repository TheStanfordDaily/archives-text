# SDS Fails To Stop CIA Interviews
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The "continuous debate" and
sit-in against the CIA planned
yesterday turned out to be noth
ing more than a two-hour dis
cussion by fewer than 20 people
on Encina's Hall's front lawn.
Twelve interviews inside the
building continued without inter
ruption from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The
demonstrators left at 10 a.m.
Joel Smith, dean of students,

said yesterday disciplinary ac
tion against the two dozen dem
onstrators who entered Encina
Wednesday is "actively being
considered."
Smith, who confronted the
demonstrators when they tried
to enter the room where CIA rep
resentative J. Fred Winters was
interviewing, told them they
were violating a university reg
ulation on demonstrations.

This regulation, effective May
22, 1964, states the University
must "maintain on the campus
an atmosphere conducive to aca
demic work ... and to respect
the private rights of all individ
uals."
Demonstrations must be "con
ducted in an orderly manner,"
must not interfere with sched
uled meetings, or be held within

University buildings, according
to the regulations.
The demonstrators entered En
cina Wednesday through a fire
escape and tried to disrupt a job
interview one story below. They
also tried repeatedly to push
their way inside through the
main door to Encina's west
wing. The demonstrators were
resisted by student police.
Smith indicated if the Uni
versity decides on proceedings
against the demonstrators, they
will be conducted by the Asso
ciated Students' judicial council,
a ten-member student court.
Easy Identification
Presumably the defendants
would be identified by the many
photographs taken of the dem
onstration.
About half of the 30 students
scheduled for CIA job inter
views were members of the Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
(SDS), the small leftist group
which planned the demonstra
tions. The Resistance, an anti
draft organization, joined the
CIA protest.
An SDS source said yesterday
protests will take place against
Dow Chemical Company inter
views, scheduled by the Place
ment Service for Nov. 10, 16 and
17. Dow makes napalm used by
the U.S. expeditionary force in
Vietnam.
The CIA demonstration at
Stanford was tepid compared to

protests at other campuses
around the nation. At the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania yester
day about 100 students held a
sit-in in the placement office
against Dow and CIA recruit
ment. About ten students forced
their way into the Dow recruit
er's office. He continued to inter
view applicants while students
students chanted "We shall not
be moved." After an hour the
dean of men asked the recruiter
to leave.
Power Failure
The Penn demonstrators then
shut off the lights in the build
ing, forcing the CIA recruiter
,to leave. The dean of men took
down 20 names of students in
volved but is uncertain of dis
ciplinary action.
A Dow recruiter was barred
from the University of Connec
ticut and a CIA recruiter from
Brown University Wednesday.
The Stanford protest, which
didn't prevent the CIA recruiter
from interviewing the handful
of students seriously interested
in a CIA job, was exaggerated
in national press coverage. The
Associated Press reported that
"100 students climbed a fire es
cape to an alcove over the con
ference room and began yelling
and stomping." According to a
demonstrator, the fewer than
30 students were "singing," and
left down the fire escape when
asked by Joel Smith.
