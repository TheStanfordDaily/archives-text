### BARBARA HYLAND 
According to a recent adver
tisement in "The New York
Times Book Review," Edward
M. Farmer, an emeritus profes
sor at Stanford, has started an
"amazing new short-cut art
course." However, when inter
viewed, Farmer said he knew
"nothing about it."
The advertisement for the
"Transachrome Home Art
Course" appeared on page 24
of the October 22 edition of "The
New York Times Book Review."
At the top of the page are two
quotes endorsing the course,
both of which are attributed to
Farmer.
The first quote reads, "In just
ONE short hour I'll have you
painting magnificent, authentic

still lifes, landscapes and por
traits on canvas!" Farmer was
"amazed" for he had never made
this remark.
At the top right side of the
page under the headlines, "A
Vital Message Front Professor
Farmer!"; there is a longer,
more explicit explanation of the
course. This quote states;
"In all my years of teaching
art, I've never seen such an
easy-to-follow course of instruc
tions as the new Transachrome
Home Art Course. I've recom
mended this Course to hundreds
of my students and have been
amazed at how it helps them
to switfly blossom as more ac
complished artists.
"It is a rapid, logical, easy-to
understand method of art In

struction that eliminates the
drudgery normally involved in
mastering the basics of painting.
It is truly a scientific short-cut
method that will help both the
beginner and the more advanced
student to quickly capture the
joy and satisfaction of creating
original and authentic paintings
on canvas while it develops the
knowledge necessary to truly ap
preciate the world's great works
of art. To all those who have
desired to realize the pure joy of
painting, I say, mail the coupon
below, without delay."
The address to send for the
course is in New York City.
Farmer thought he might have
been confused with his son, an
artist who lives in New York,
named Edward L. Farmer. He
was never a Stanford professor.
