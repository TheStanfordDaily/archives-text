# Fire Hazards Plague Row, Fraternities
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ BILL RORABAUGH 
While fraternity cluster number
three rises behind Wilbur Hall, and
cluster number four looms nebulously
in the future, the residents of many of
the houses which the clusters will re

place wait nervously in buildings
which are little more than fire traps.
Stanford's aged fraternity houses
— some as old as the University —
find it hard to meet the fire prevention
standards of the 20th century.
Phi Sigma Kappa's main worry is

people throwing cigarettes on the
floor, according to fraternity president
Bruce Black. If anything larger than
a wastepaper basket catches fire, he
fears "the whole house will go."
Phi Kappa Psi spent $28,000 on reno
vations over the summer and cleared
up their two main fire hazards, the
kitchen and the attic, but if any good
sized portion of the house starts burn
ing, residents say nothing will prevent
the rest from burning, too.
Seventeen members of homeless
Alpha Sigma Phi are living in Man
zanita House, which has an estimated
total burning time of six minutes, ac
cording to the fire department.
Meanwhile, the future of these
houses is uncertain. Phi Sig's move
into a cluster is "several years away"
at best, according to Black.
And Phi Psi's house manager said
that estimates on when his fraternity
would move range from eight to 20
years.
Increased County Pressure
Meanwhile, the fraternities and Uni
versity-owned row houses are being
subjected to increased pressure from
the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea
sures are all that can be accomplished,
because the structures are in such
poor condition that steps which would
save property in a fire are no longer
feasible undertakings.
Health And Safety
At the Phi Sig house, the improve
ments were made "only for the pur
poses of health and safety," president
Black said.
The changes are only so that every
one can get out of the place if it does
catch fire. A lot of property would be
lost, he noted, "but there is nothing
that can be done about that," because
the building is so old.
The 60 or 70 year-old former bam
"is crumbling already," Black remark
ed. But despite the difficulties, the fra
ternity has already had much work
done to remove some of the hazards,
and more is planned.
Still, if the house caught fire, "it
would be an all or nothing proposi
tion," as Phi Sig Doug Gunesch said.
Same At Phi Psi
Bill Holt, Phi Psi president, expres
sed similar feelings. "If there were
ever a fire on the first floor a lot of
guys might be killed," he said.
The University has not ignored the
problems of the fraternities and some
of the women's row houses. The most
luxurious student housing on campus
has been built to replace the old wood
en houses. These are the fraternity
clusters, two now completed around
Lake Lagunita, a third rapidly rising
on Campus drive, and a fourth plan
ned.

But the occupied old fraternities re
main. The eight women's row houses,
although owned by the University and
more closely supervised, have prob
lems, too.
For all the old residences, admits
Edward Scoles, assistant business
manager for University housing, "Fire
danger is one of the major problems.
They are all in bad shape."
First Frat Inspection
The first inspection of the old fra
ternities by the county fire marshal
was in 1957. As a result of that inves
tigation and other surveys undertaken
by the University, the decision to re
locate the fraternities in new cluster
housing was made.
Scoles noted that some of the fra
ternity buildings at that time were re
garded as having "minus years life."
Although the twenty year cluster
program was undertaken to remove
the fraternities from potentially un
safe quarters, apparently the Univer
sity did not feel 'iny clear and present
danger, for the earliest occupants of
the cluster program were chosen on
the basis of finance rather than build
ing deterioration.
'The Theta Delts moved into cluster
number one, although their house was
in good shape," said Scoles.
The state fire code was extremely
permissive until 1963. It was strength
ened in 1965. The tough inspections of
1967 are among the first under the
new code.
Scoles believes the typhoid scare at
Beta House last spring "focused atten
tion on all housing regulations. Coun

ty and state officials got alarmed over
typhoid. The fire marshal has put on
a more intense campaign than in pre
vious years."
Fire Marshal Bruce Wiggins agreed
the campaign is more intense, but
says it is mere coincidence. A lack of
manpower in former years prevented
rigorous investigation.
Will Meet All Frats
Wiggins has met with or plans to
meet with, each of the sixteen fra
ternities before the end of November,
to discuss the specific items that need
to be completed for each house.
Already, after only seven meetings,
Wiggins is pleased. "We have found
marked progress on our return in
spection tours," he said.
Many of the houses have similar
troubles, but they have been getting
cooperation from the fire department
in fixing them.
'The fire people were quite con
cerned about the situation here last
year," said Allen Ruby, Phi Psi resi
dent assistant. "But over the summer
several thousand dollars of capital im
provements were put into the house,
and as a result many possible fire
hazards were eliminated."
"We realize there is a fire hazard,
since this is one of the older houses
on campus," president Bill Holt said.
"We make sure that everyone knows
every exit, and knows it well. We
don't have fire drills, although we've
thought about it."
"We try not to use extension cords,"
he noted. "We also use very low amp
