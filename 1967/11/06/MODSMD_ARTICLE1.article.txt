# Fire Hazards Plague Row, Fraternities
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ BILL RORABAUGH 
While fraternity cluster number
three rises behind Wilbur Hall, and
cluster number four looms nebulously
in the future, the residents of many of
the houses which the clusters will re

place wait nervously in buildings
which are little more than fire traps.
Stanford's aged fraternity houses
— some as old as the University —
find it hard to meet the fire prevention
standards of the 20th century.
Phi Sigma Kappa's main worry is

people throwing cigarettes on the
floor, according to fraternity president
Bruce Black. If anything larger than
a wastepaper basket catches fire, he
fears "the whole house will go."
Phi Kappa Psi spent $28,000 on reno
vations over the summer and cleared
up their two main fire hazards, the
kitchen and the attic, but if any good
sized portion of the house starts burn
ing, residents say nothing will prevent
the rest from burning, too.
Seventeen members of homeless
Alpha Sigma Phi are living in Man
zanita House, which has an estimated
total burning time of six minutes, ac
cording to the fire department.
Meanwhile, the future of these
houses is uncertain. Phi Sig's move
into a cluster is "several years away"
at best, according to Black.
And Phi Psi's house manager said
that estimates on when his fraternity
would move range from eight to 20
years.
Increased County Pressure
Meanwhile, the fraternities and Uni
versity-owned row houses are being
subjected to increased pressure from
the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea
sures are all that can be accomplished,
because the structures are in such
poor condition that steps which would
save property in a fire are no longer
feasible undertakings.
Health And Safety
At the Phi Sig house, the improve
ments were made "only for the pur
poses of health and safety," president
Black said.
The changes are only so that every
one can get out of the place if it does
catch fire. A lot of property would be
lost, he noted, "but there is nothing
that can be done about that," because
the building is so old.
The 60 or 70 year-old former bam
"is crumbling already," Black remark
ed. But despite the difficulties, the fra
ternity has already had much work
done to remove some of the hazards,
and more is planned.
Still, if the house caught fire, "it
would be an all or nothing proposi
tion," as Phi Sig Doug Gunesch said.
Same At Phi Psi
Bill Holt, Phi Psi president, expres
sed similar feelings. "If there were
ever a fire on the first floor a lot of
guys might be killed," he said.
The University has not ignored the
problems of the fraternities and some
of the women's row houses. The most
luxurious student housing on campus
has been built to replace the old wood
en houses. These are the fraternity
clusters, two now completed around
Lake Lagunita, a third rapidly rising
on Campus drive, and a fourth plan
ned.

But the occupied old fraternities re
main. The eight women's row houses,
although owned by the University and
more closely supervised, have prob
lems, too.
For all the old residences, admits
Edward Scoles, assistant business
manager for University housing, "Fire
danger is one of the major problems.
They are all in bad shape."
First Frat Inspection
The first inspection of the old fra
ternities by the county fire marshal
was in 1957. As a result of that inves
tigation and other surveys undertaken
by the University, the decision to re
locate the fraternities in new cluster
housing was made.
Scoles noted that some of the fra
ternity buildings at that time were re
garded as having "minus years life."
Although the twenty year cluster
program was undertaken to remove
the fraternities from potentially un
safe quarters, apparently the Univer
sity did not feel 'iny clear and present
danger, for the earliest occupants of
the cluster program were chosen on
the basis of finance rather than build
ing deterioration.
'The Theta Delts moved into cluster
number one, although their house was
in good shape," said Scoles.
The state fire code was extremely
permissive until 1963. It was strength
ened in 1965. The tough inspections of
1967 are among the first under the
new code.
Scoles believes the typhoid scare at
Beta House last spring "focused atten
tion on all housing regulations. Coun

ty and state officials got alarmed over
typhoid. The fire marshal has put on
a more intense campaign than in pre
vious years."
Fire Marshal Bruce Wiggins agreed
the campaign is more intense, but
says it is mere coincidence. A lack of
manpower in former years prevented
rigorous investigation.
Will Meet All Frats
Wiggins has met with or plans to
meet with, each of the sixteen fra
ternities before the end of November,
to discuss the specific items that need
to be completed for each house.
Already, after only seven meetings,
Wiggins is pleased. "We have found
marked progress on our return in
spection tours," he said.
Many of the houses have similar
troubles, but they have been getting
cooperation from the fire department
in fixing them.
'The fire people were quite con
cerned about the situation here last
year," said Allen Ruby, Phi Psi resi
dent assistant. "But over the summer
several thousand dollars of capital im
provements were put into the house,
and as a result many possible fire
hazards were eliminated."
"We realize there is a fire hazard,
since this is one of the older houses
on campus," president Bill Holt said.
"We make sure that everyone knows
every exit, and knows it well. We
don't have fire drills, although we've
thought about it."
"We try not to use extension cords,"
he noted. "We also use very low amp

dryer.
fuses. We do blow a lot of fuses,
because the wiring is overloaded.
We use low fuses to blow the
wiring and not the house."
"The fire department has re
ally laid down the law this year,"
Holt explained. All inside doors
have been replaced with solid
wood doors, which have a much
longer burning time. He said the
house had taken action on about
half of the fire marshal's list so
far, and is currently working
on the rest.
"Basically, they've let the
houses be below standards be
cause everyone knew that they
couldn't meet state standards,"
said Holt. He was glad to see
the fire marshal take a more
active interest in the fraternities
to relieve some of the dangers.
Beta Chi was less willing to
talk about their dealings with
the fire department than some
other fraternities. Mel Ellis, fra
ternity president, claimed that
"Beta Chi is in no worse condi
tion than the row houses."
The fire department called for
several improvements at the
Beta Chi house, however. These
included enclosing open stair
wells and extending one fire es
cape, which ends about seven
feet from the ground.
Quick-Set Latches
Also, the fraternity must re
place quick-set latches which
are on the doors to the bed
rooms. These violate the fire
code because special manipula
tion of the handle is required to
open them.
"The fire marshal came up to
the house last Wednesday, and
told us we did not have to make
expensive repairs," Ellis said.
He was upset with a September
16th inspection of the house
which precipitated a four page

set of correction orders from the
fire marshal. Ellis termed many
of the recommendations "pica
yune."
More than three quarters of
the recommendations had now
been carried out. "We're not
interested in taking risks with
health and fire dangers," he said.
Phi Sigma Kappa seems to
have more troubles than most,
which is to be expected, consider
ing their house was originally
a barn. But they don't let this
faze them.
Not A Deathtrap
Bruce Black, Phi Sig presi
dent said, "Our house is not a
deathtrap, but we know it's not
entirely safe, and that makes it
kind of exciting living here."
"We've never had a fire drill,"
he noted, but emphasized that
the house tries to make sure
that everyone is familiar with all
of the ways out of the house.
"We might lose the house in a
bad fire, but there are plenty of
ways of getting out," Black said.
The Phi Sig house has two fire
escapes, one of the ladder type,
the other with a platform and
ladder.
The officers of the fraternity
met with Fire Marshal Wiggins
last Thursday.
"He was fairly pleased with
what we'd done since they in
spected the house September 23,"
Black said, although many im
provements still have to be
made.
Rewiring Still Needed
The main work still to be
done is in rewiring. This basic
ally consists of getting more out
lets in the rooms, rather than
using extension cords.
"The fire department has nev
er been very happy, but every
one knows that we're going to
move sooner or later. Mayfield

Avenue is scheduled to corm
through our living room," saic
Black. The Fire Department
sent the Phi Sigs a four page
letter listing deficiencies early
in October.
The fire department asked
that exit signs be displayed, and
demanded that the stairwell be
sealed off at the top and bottom.
The Cornell University fire ear
lier this year resulted in several
deaths due to poisonous smoke
traveling through an open stair
well.
This remains to be done, al
though it has already been con
tracted for, and Black expects
it to be completed by the end of
the week. Another major change
is building a new fire escape
over the kitchen, from the sec
ond floor. The present one is
merely an old wooden ladder.
Much Already Completed
Phi Sig has already complied
with many of the fire depart
ment's requests, including par
titioning off the attic, fixing
broken plaster to prevent the
spread of fire through walls, and
putting up two heavy wooden
doors to replace old, more easily
ignited ones.
Over at Jordan House, a
women's residence, the main
trouble seems to be with the
fire department, rather than
with the house.
Ann Grekel, a Jordan resident,
related an incident that occurred
two years ago. On two consecu
tive Tuesdays, someone broke
into the house at 3:30 a.m. and
set off the fire alarm.
The first time this happened,
the firemen took over half
an hour to arrive. They didn't
seem to know where Jordan
House was, and got confused
with Jordan Hall and Jordan
Quad.
The firemen have been at Jor
dan two other times recently.
Once was because of a short
circuit, and the other was caused
by a gas leak.
Several Blown Fuses
There were several blown
fuses in the house last year.
Miss Grekel said, "You learn
not to use extension cords, and
that you can't put a coffee pot
and a light on the same outlet."
Jordan House is equipped with
fire escapes, of the crank-down
ladder type. There is one at
each end of the second floors. "I
assume they're not rusty," Gre
kel said, adding that she had nev
er known any student to actually
test one. There is ivy partially
growing over one of the ladders,
she added.
Miss Grekel also noted that
fire drills are somewhat strange.
"You run down the stairs and
meet in the front hall," she said,
"because the only convenient
exit is at the front of the house."
Meanwhile, Fire Marshal Wig
gins is trying to make it as easy
as possible for the residents of
these unsafe houses.
"We're here to help people,"
emphasized Wiggins. "We don't
want one penny more spent on
changes than has to be."
Life Most Important
He noted, 'The primary em
phasis of the code is placed on
saving life, not property damage.
Enclosed stairwells are the most
important single feature."
Dan Williams, assistant dean
of students for fraternities, ex
plained there are three main
problems with fraternities: in
terior stairwells are not en
closed, fire escapes do not meet
the required sixty degree slope,
and wiring is faulty.
"All but one or two of the old
houses fails to meet all three
criteria," he said.
Robert Summers, university
fraternity manager, said, "The
University is not neutral. Either

the University owns the houses
or the land. So we're very inter
ested in seeing that the law is
complied with." *
Fiscal Problems
"There are definite money
problems," said Scoles, assistant
business manager for housing.
The University has granted
loans to four fraternities to
make repairs and replacements.
"We haven't turned down any
loan requests yet," he said.
Apparently no house will be
required to do extensive rewir
ing. This would have been the
single most expensive item that
a house would have to do, ex
plained Scoles.
Williams explained the maxi
mum expenditure on a single
house would be $800. "Those
moving into clusters won't have
to spend as much money," he
added, because the fire marshal
only requires that progress is
being made, not that all pro
posed corrections be undertaken
immediately.
Pleased With Response
Williams said, "I've been ex
tremely pleased with the re
sponse of the fraternities. No
body's had to be convinced that
the issue is serious."
Fire Marshal Wiggins pointed
out that fraternities are not be
ing singled out for study. The
fraternities are being studied as
part of an overall study of fire
potential in University groups.
Fire safety procedures, in
cluding fire drills, in the row
houses have recently come un
der the scrutiny of a group of
University officers. Assistant
Dean of Students Sally Mahoney
noted that fire safety is largely
just making sure that people
have correct information.
Fire Alarm Operation
"For example, in all Univer
sity owned residences except the
Row, the fire alarm triggers a
device at the fire department.
In the eight Row houses, the fire
alarm is internal. One must call
the fire department on the tele
phone or use the fire alarm box
on the street," she said.

She feels that a rational dis
cussion of fire hazards in a spe
cific residence would be more
useful than a pre-announced
night-time fire drill. "The prob
lems are different in Storey than
in Jordan House, or in Stern
Hall."
Carlee Mack, director of the
row houses, commented on fire
drills that "what we were doing
in the past is quite inadequate."
"We had talks about fire pre
vention last year. We talked
about revising the fire drills last
year," she said. "I rather doubt
if everyone running to the end
of the hall with their coat and
shoes on would be adequate in a
real fire."
And sometimes the real fire
happens. On April 25, 1966,
faulty wiring in the wooden Phi

Kappa Sigma house on Mayfield
Avenue started a fire that gutted
the attic and third floor.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books and oth
er belongings out the windows.
Fire extinguishers were broken
out but most malfunctioned.
Twenty-two Stanford firemen
fought the blaze and prevented
total destruction of the house.
Before they had the fire under
control, student firemen had to
enter the burning building where
several had their clothing
burned by the surrounding
flames.
Fire chief John Marston said
then he was "thankful there
wasn't much wind. If there had
been, the fire could easily have
spread to other buildings."
Stanford escaped that fire with

no loss of life and $50,000 prop
erty damage. No one knows if
we'll be so lucky next time a
wire burns out on the Row.


The Phi Psi house pictured here is one of the oldest on campus;
it has an estimated burning time of ten minutes. The fire escape
seen here is one of a number of fire hazards at the house due to
its vertical rather than 60 degree tilt.

Not one of the more recently erected campus residences, Jordan has its share of death traps. Seen
here is an erstwhile fire escape almost completely blocked by indigenous shrubbery.

Row, the fire alarm triggers a
device at the fire department.
In the eight Row houses, the fire
alarm is internal. One must call
the fire department on the tele
phone or use the fire alarm box
on the street," she said.

She feels that a rational dis
cussion of fire hazards in a spe
cific residence would be more
useful than a pre-announced
night-time fire drill. "The prob
lems are different in Storey than
in Jordan House, or in Stern
Hall."
Carlee Mack, director of the
row houses, commented on fire
drills that "what we were doing
in the past is quite inadequate."
"We had talks about fire pre
vention last year. We talked
about revising the fire drills last
year," she said. "I rather doubt
if everyone running to the end
of the hall with their coat and
shoes on would be adequate in a
real fire."
And sometimes the real fire
happens. On April 25, 1966,
faulty wiring in the wooden Phi

Kappa Sigma house on Mayfield
Avenue started a fire that gutted
the attic and third floor.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books and oth
er belongings out the windows.
Fire extinguishers were broken
out but most malfunctioned.
Twenty-two Stanford firemen
fought the blaze and prevented
total destruction of the house.
Before they had the fire under
control, student firemen had to
enter the burning building where
several had their clothing
burned by the surrounding
flames.
Fire chief John Marston said
then he was "thankful there
wasn't much wind. If there had
been, the fire could easily have
spread to other buildings."
Stanford escaped that fire with

no loss of life and $50,000 prop
erty damage. No one knows if
we'll be so lucky next time a
wire burns out on the Row.


The Phi Psi house pictured here is one of the oldest on campus;
it has an estimated burning time of ten minutes. The fire escape
seen here is one of a number of fire hazards at the house due to
its vertical rather than 60 degree tilt.

Not one of the more recently erected campus residences, Jordan has its share of death traps. Seen
here is an erstwhile fire escape almost completely blocked by indigenous shrubbery.
While fraternity cluster number
three rises behind Wilbur Hall, and
cluster number four looms nebulously
in the future, the residents of many of
the houses which the clusters will re

place wait nervously in buildings
which are little more than fire traps.
Stanford's aged fraternity houses
— some as old as the University —
find it hard to meet the fire prevention
standards of the 20th century.
Phi Sigma Kappa's main worry is

people throwing cigarettes on the
floor, according to fraternity president
Bruce Black. If anything larger than
a wastepaper basket catches fire, he
fears "the whole house will go."
Phi Kappa Psi spent $28,000 on reno
vations over the summer and cleared
up their two main fire hazards, the
kitchen and the attic, but if any good
sized portion of the house starts burn
ing, residents say nothing will prevent
the rest from burning, too.
Seventeen members of homeless
Alpha Sigma Phi are living in Man
zanita House, which has an estimated
total burning time of six minutes, ac
cording to the fire department.
Meanwhile, the future of these
houses is uncertain. Phi Sig's move
into a cluster is "several years away"
at best, according to Black.
And Phi Psi's house manager said
that estimates on when his fraternity
would move range from eight to 20
years.
Increased County Pressure
Meanwhile, the fraternities and Uni
versity-owned row houses are being
subjected to increased pressure from
the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea
sures are all that can be accomplished,
because the structures are in such
poor condition that steps which would
save property in a fire are no longer
feasible undertakings.
Health And Safety
At the Phi Sig house, the improve
ments were made "only for the pur
poses of health and safety," president
Black said.
The changes are only so that every
one can get out of the place if it does
catch fire. A lot of property would be
lost, he noted, "but there is nothing
that can be done about that," because
the building is so old.
The 60 or 70 year-old former bam
"is crumbling already," Black remark
ed. But despite the difficulties, the fra
ternity has already had much work
done to remove some of the hazards,
and more is planned.
Still, if the house caught fire, "it
would be an all or nothing proposi
tion," as Phi Sig Doug Gunesch said.
Same At Phi Psi
Bill Holt, Phi Psi president, expres
sed similar feelings. "If there were
ever a fire on the first floor a lot of
guys might be killed," he said.
The University has not ignored the
problems of the fraternities and some
of the women's row houses. The most
luxurious student housing on campus
has been built to replace the old wood
en houses. These are the fraternity
clusters, two now completed around
Lake Lagunita, a third rapidly rising
on Campus drive, and a fourth plan
ned.

But the occupied old fraternities re
main. The eight women's row houses,
although owned by the University and
more closely supervised, have prob
lems, too.
For all the old residences, admits
Edward Scoles, assistant business
manager for University housing, "Fire
danger is one of the major problems.
They are all in bad shape."
First Frat Inspection
The first inspection of the old fra
ternities by the county fire marshal
was in 1957. As a result of that inves
tigation and other surveys undertaken
by the University, the decision to re
locate the fraternities in new cluster
housing was made.
Scoles noted that some of the fra
ternity buildings at that time were re
garded as having "minus years life."
Although the twenty year cluster
program was undertaken to remove
the fraternities from potentially un
safe quarters, apparently the Univer
sity did not feel 'iny clear and present
danger, for the earliest occupants of
the cluster program were chosen on
the basis of finance rather than build
ing deterioration.
'The Theta Delts moved into cluster
number one, although their house was
in good shape," said Scoles.
The state fire code was extremely
permissive until 1963. It was strength
ened in 1965. The tough inspections of
1967 are among the first under the
new code.
Scoles believes the typhoid scare at
Beta House last spring "focused atten
tion on all housing regulations. Coun

ty and state officials got alarmed over
typhoid. The fire marshal has put on
a more intense campaign than in pre
vious years."
Fire Marshal Bruce Wiggins agreed
the campaign is more intense, but
says it is mere coincidence. A lack of
manpower in former years prevented
rigorous investigation.
Will Meet All Frats
Wiggins has met with or plans to
meet with, each of the sixteen fra
ternities before the end of November,
to discuss the specific items that need
to be completed for each house.
Already, after only seven meetings,
Wiggins is pleased. "We have found
marked progress on our return in
spection tours," he said.
Many of the houses have similar
troubles, but they have been getting
cooperation from the fire department
in fixing them.
'The fire people were quite con
cerned about the situation here last
year," said Allen Ruby, Phi Psi resi
dent assistant. "But over the summer
several thousand dollars of capital im
provements were put into the house,
and as a result many possible fire
hazards were eliminated."
"We realize there is a fire hazard,
since this is one of the older houses
on campus," president Bill Holt said.
"We make sure that everyone knows
every exit, and knows it well. We
don't have fire drills, although we've
thought about it."
"We try not to use extension cords,"
he noted. "We also use very low amp

fuses. We do blow a lot of fuses,
because the wiring is overloaded.
We use low fuses to blow the
wiring and not the house."
"The fire department has re
ally laid down the law this year,"
Holt explained. All inside doors
have been replaced with solid
wood doors, which have a much
longer burning time. He said the
house had taken action on about
half of the fire marshal's list so
far, and is currently working
on the rest.
"Basically, they've let the
houses be below standards be
cause everyone knew that they
couldn't meet state standards,"
said Holt. He was glad to see
the fire marshal take a more
active interest in the fraternities
to relieve some of the dangers.
Beta Chi was less willing to
talk about their dealings with
the fire department than some
other fraternities. Mel Ellis, fra
ternity president, claimed that
"Beta Chi is in no worse condi
tion than the row houses."
The fire department called for
several improvements at the
Beta Chi house, however. These
included enclosing open stair
wells and extending one fire es
cape, which ends about seven
feet from the ground.
Quick-Set Latches
Also, the fraternity must re
place quick-set latches which
are on the doors to the bed
rooms. These violate the fire
code because special manipula
tion of the handle is required to
open them.
"The fire marshal came up to
the house last Wednesday, and
told us we did not have to make
expensive repairs," Ellis said.
He was upset with a September
16th inspection of the house
which precipitated a four page

set of correction orders from the
fire marshal. Ellis termed many
of the recommendations "pica
yune."
More than three quarters of
the recommendations had now
been carried out. "We're not
interested in taking risks with
health and fire dangers," he said.
Phi Sigma Kappa seems to
have more troubles than most,
which is to be expected, consider
ing their house was originally
a barn. But they don't let this
faze them.
Not A Deathtrap
Bruce Black, Phi Sig presi
dent said, "Our house is not a
deathtrap, but we know it's not
entirely safe, and that makes it
kind of exciting living here."
"We've never had a fire drill,"
he noted, but emphasized that
the house tries to make sure
that everyone is familiar with all
of the ways out of the house.
"We might lose the house in a
bad fire, but there are plenty of
ways of getting out," Black said.
The Phi Sig house has two fire
escapes, one of the ladder type,
the other with a platform and
ladder.
The officers of the fraternity
met with Fire Marshal Wiggins
last Thursday.
"He was fairly pleased with
what we'd done since they in
spected the house September 23,"
Black said, although many im
provements still have to be
made.
Rewiring Still Needed
The main work still to be
done is in rewiring. This basic
ally consists of getting more out
lets in the rooms, rather than
using extension cords.
"The fire department has nev
er been very happy, but every
one knows that we're going to
move sooner or later. Mayfield

Avenue is scheduled to corm
through our living room," saic
Black. The Fire Department
sent the Phi Sigs a four page
letter listing deficiencies early
in October.
The fire department asked
that exit signs be displayed, and
demanded that the stairwell be
sealed off at the top and bottom.
The Cornell University fire ear
lier this year resulted in several
deaths due to poisonous smoke
traveling through an open stair
well.
This remains to be done, al
though it has already been con
tracted for, and Black expects
it to be completed by the end of
the week. Another major change
is building a new fire escape
over the kitchen, from the sec
ond floor. The present one is
merely an old wooden ladder.
Much Already Completed
Phi Sig has already complied
with many of the fire depart
ment's requests, including par
titioning off the attic, fixing
broken plaster to prevent the
spread of fire through walls, and
putting up two heavy wooden
doors to replace old, more easily
ignited ones.
Over at Jordan House, a
women's residence, the main
trouble seems to be with the
fire department, rather than
with the house.
Ann Grekel, a Jordan resident,
related an incident that occurred
two years ago. On two consecu
tive Tuesdays, someone broke
into the house at 3:30 a.m. and
set off the fire alarm.
The first time this happened,
the firemen took over half
an hour to arrive. They didn't
seem to know where Jordan
House was, and got confused
with Jordan Hall and Jordan
Quad.
The firemen have been at Jor
dan two other times recently.
Once was because of a short
circuit, and the other was caused
by a gas leak.
Several Blown Fuses
There were several blown
fuses in the house last year.
Miss Grekel said, "You learn
not to use extension cords, and
that you can't put a coffee pot
and a light on the same outlet."
Jordan House is equipped with
fire escapes, of the crank-down
ladder type. There is one at
each end of the second floors. "I
assume they're not rusty," Gre
kel said, adding that she had nev
er known any student to actually
test one. There is ivy partially
growing over one of the ladders,
she added.
Miss Grekel also noted that
fire drills are somewhat strange.
"You run down the stairs and
meet in the front hall," she said,
"because the only convenient
exit is at the front of the house."
Meanwhile, Fire Marshal Wig
gins is trying to make it as easy
as possible for the residents of
these unsafe houses.
"We're here to help people,"
emphasized Wiggins. "We don't
want one penny more spent on
changes than has to be."
Life Most Important
He noted, 'The primary em
phasis of the code is placed on
saving life, not property damage.
Enclosed stairwells are the most
important single feature."
Dan Williams, assistant dean
of students for fraternities, ex
plained there are three main
problems with fraternities: in
terior stairwells are not en
closed, fire escapes do not meet
the required sixty degree slope,
and wiring is faulty.
"All but one or two of the old
houses fails to meet all three
criteria," he said.
Robert Summers, university
fraternity manager, said, "The
University is not neutral. Either

the University owns the houses
or the land. So we're very inter
ested in seeing that the law is
complied with." *
Fiscal Problems
"There are definite money
problems," said Scoles, assistant
business manager for housing.
The University has granted
loans to four fraternities to
make repairs and replacements.
"We haven't turned down any
loan requests yet," he said.
Apparently no house will be
required to do extensive rewir
ing. This would have been the
single most expensive item that
a house would have to do, ex
plained Scoles.
Williams explained the maxi
mum expenditure on a single
house would be $800. "Those
moving into clusters won't have
to spend as much money," he
added, because the fire marshal
only requires that progress is
being made, not that all pro
posed corrections be undertaken
immediately.
Pleased With Response
Williams said, "I've been ex
tremely pleased with the re
sponse of the fraternities. No
body's had to be convinced that
the issue is serious."
Fire Marshal Wiggins pointed
out that fraternities are not be
ing singled out for study. The
fraternities are being studied as
part of an overall study of fire
potential in University groups.
Fire safety procedures, in
cluding fire drills, in the row
houses have recently come un
der the scrutiny of a group of
University officers. Assistant
Dean of Students Sally Mahoney
noted that fire safety is largely
just making sure that people
have correct information.
Fire Alarm Operation
"For example, in all Univer
sity owned residences except the
Row, the fire alarm triggers a
device at the fire department.
In the eight Row houses, the fire
alarm is internal. One must call
the fire department on the tele
phone or use the fire alarm box
on the street," she said.

She feels that a rational dis
cussion of fire hazards in a spe
cific residence would be more
useful than a pre-announced
night-time fire drill. "The prob
lems are different in Storey than
in Jordan House, or in Stern
Hall."
Carlee Mack, director of the
row houses, commented on fire
drills that "what we were doing
in the past is quite inadequate."
"We had talks about fire pre
vention last year. We talked
about revising the fire drills last
year," she said. "I rather doubt
if everyone running to the end
of the hall with their coat and
shoes on would be adequate in a
real fire."
And sometimes the real fire
happens. On April 25, 1966,
faulty wiring in the wooden Phi

Kappa Sigma house on Mayfield

the attic and third floor.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books and oth
er belongings out the windows.
Fire extinguishers were broken

Twenty-two Stanford firemen
fought the blaze and prevented
total destruction of the house.

several had their clothing

Life Most Important
He noted, 'The primary em
phasis of the code is placed on
saving life, not property damage.
Enclosed stairwells are the most
important single feature."
Dan Williams, assistant dean
of students for fraternities, ex
plained there are three main
problems with fraternities: in
terior stairwells are not en
closed, fire escapes do not meet
the required sixty degree slope,
and wiring is faulty.
"All but one or two of the old
houses fails to meet all three
criteria," he said.
Robert Summers, university
fraternity manager, said, "The
University is not neutral. Either

the University owns the houses
or the land. So we're very inter
ested in seeing that the law is
complied with." *
Fiscal Problems
"There are definite money
problems," said Scoles, assistant
business manager for housing.
The University has granted
loans to four fraternities to
make repairs and replacements.
"We haven't turned down any
loan requests yet," he said.
Apparently no house will be
required to do extensive rewir
ing. This would have been the
single most expensive item that
a house would have to do, ex
plained Scoles.
Williams explained the maxi
mum expenditure on a single
house would be $800. "Those
moving into clusters won't have
to spend as much money," he
added, because the fire marshal
only requires that progress is
being made, not that all pro
posed corrections be undertaken
immediately.
Pleased With Response
Williams said, "I've been ex
tremely pleased with the re
sponse of the fraternities. No
body's had to be convinced that
the issue is serious."
Fire Marshal Wiggins pointed
out that fraternities are not be
ing singled out for study. The
fraternities are being studied as
part of an overall study of fire
potential in University groups.
Fire safety procedures, in
cluding fire drills, in the row
houses have recently come un
der the scrutiny of a group of
University officers. Assistant
Dean of Students Sally Mahoney
noted that fire safety is largely
just making sure that people
have correct information.
Fire Alarm Operation
"For example, in all Univer
sity owned residences except the
Row, the fire alarm triggers a
device at the fire department.
In the eight Row houses, the fire
alarm is internal. One must call
the fire department on the tele
phone or use the fire alarm box
on the street," she said.

She feels that a rational dis
cussion of fire hazards in a spe
cific residence would be more
useful than a pre-announced
night-time fire drill. "The prob
lems are different in Storey than
in Jordan House, or in Stern
Hall."
Carlee Mack, director of the
row houses, commented on fire
drills that "what we were doing
in the past is quite inadequate."
"We had talks about fire pre
vention last year. We talked
about revising the fire drills last
year," she said. "I rather doubt
if everyone running to the end
of the hall with their coat and
shoes on would be adequate in a
real fire."
And sometimes the real fire
happens. On April 25, 1966,
faulty wiring in the wooden Phi

Kappa Sigma house on Mayfield
Avenue started a fire that gutted
the attic and third floor.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books and oth
er belongings out the windows.
Fire extinguishers were broken
out but most malfunctioned.
Twenty-two Stanford firemen
fought the blaze and prevented
total destruction of the house.
Before they had the fire under
control, student firemen had to
enter the burning building where
several had their clothing
burned by the surrounding
flames.
Fire chief John Marston said
then he was "thankful there
wasn't much wind. If there had
been, the fire could easily have
spread to other buildings."
Stanford escaped that fire with

no loss of life and $50,000 prop
erty damage. No one knows if
we'll be so lucky next time a
wire burns out on the Row.


The Phi Psi house pictured here is one of the oldest on campus;
it has an estimated burning time of ten minutes. The fire escape
seen here is one of a number of fire hazards at the house due to
its vertical rather than 60 degree tilt.

Not one of the more recently erected campus residences, Jordan has its share of death traps. Seen
here is an erstwhile fire escape almost completely blocked by indigenous shrubbery.
While fraternity cluster number
three rises behind Wilbur Hall, and
cluster number four looms nebulously
in the future, the residents of many of
the houses which the clusters will re

place wait nervously in buildings
which are little more than fire traps.
Stanford's aged fraternity houses
— some as old as the University —
find it hard to meet the fire prevention
standards of the 20th century.
Phi Sigma Kappa's main worry is

people throwing cigarettes on the
floor, according to fraternity president
Bruce Black. If anything larger than
a wastepaper basket catches fire, he
fears "the whole house will go."
Phi Kappa Psi spent $28,000 on reno
vations over the summer and cleared
up their two main fire hazards, the
kitchen and the attic, but if any good
sized portion of the house starts burn
ing, residents say nothing will prevent
the rest from burning, too.
Seventeen members of homeless
Alpha Sigma Phi are living in Man
zanita House, which has an estimated
total burning time of six minutes, ac
cording to the fire department.
Meanwhile, the future of these
houses is uncertain. Phi Sig's move
into a cluster is "several years away"
at best, according to Black.
And Phi Psi's house manager said
that estimates on when his fraternity
would move range from eight to 20
years.
Increased County Pressure
Meanwhile, the fraternities and Uni
versity-owned row houses are being
subjected to increased pressure from
the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea
sures are all that can be accomplished,
because the structures are in such
poor condition that steps which would
save property in a fire are no longer
feasible undertakings.
Health And Safety
At the Phi Sig house, the improve
ments were made "only for the pur
poses of health and safety," president
Black said.
The changes are only so that every
one can get out of the place if it does
catch fire. A lot of property would be
lost, he noted, "but there is nothing
that can be done about that," because
the building is so old.
The 60 or 70 year-old former bam
"is crumbling already," Black remark
ed. But despite the difficulties, the fra
ternity has already had much work
done to remove some of the hazards,
and more is planned.
Still, if the house caught fire, "it
would be an all or nothing proposi
tion," as Phi Sig Doug Gunesch said.
Same At Phi Psi
Bill Holt, Phi Psi president, expres
sed similar feelings. "If there were
ever a fire on the first floor a lot of
guys might be killed," he said.
The University has not ignored the
problems of the fraternities and some
of the women's row houses. The most
luxurious student housing on campus
has been built to replace the old wood
en houses. These are the fraternity
clusters, two now completed around
Lake Lagunita, a third rapidly rising
on Campus drive, and a fourth plan
ned.

But the occupied old fraternities re
main. The eight women's row houses,
although owned by the University and
more closely supervised, have prob
lems, too.
For all the old residences, admits
Edward Scoles, assistant business
manager for University housing, "Fire
danger is one of the major problems.
They are all in bad shape."
First Frat Inspection
The first inspection of the old fra
ternities by the county fire marshal
was in 1957. As a result of that inves
tigation and other surveys undertaken
by the University, the decision to re
locate the fraternities in new cluster
housing was made.
Scoles noted that some of the fra
ternity buildings at that time were re
garded as having "minus years life."
Although the twenty year cluster
program was undertaken to remove
the fraternities from potentially un
safe quarters, apparently the Univer
sity did not feel 'iny clear and present
danger, for the earliest occupants of
the cluster program were chosen on
the basis of finance rather than build
ing deterioration.
'The Theta Delts moved into cluster
number one, although their house was
in good shape," said Scoles.
The state fire code was extremely
permissive until 1963. It was strength
ened in 1965. The tough inspections of
1967 are among the first under the
new code.
Scoles believes the typhoid scare at
Beta House last spring "focused atten
tion on all housing regulations. Coun

ty and state officials got alarmed over
typhoid. The fire marshal has put on
a more intense campaign than in pre
vious years."
Fire Marshal Bruce Wiggins agreed
the campaign is more intense, but
says it is mere coincidence. A lack of
manpower in former years prevented
rigorous investigation.
Will Meet All Frats
Wiggins has met with or plans to
meet with, each of the sixteen fra
ternities before the end of November,
to discuss the specific items that need
to be completed for each house.
Already, after only seven meetings,
Wiggins is pleased. "We have found
marked progress on our return in
spection tours," he said.
Many of the houses have similar
troubles, but they have been getting
cooperation from the fire department
in fixing them.
'The fire people were quite con
cerned about the situation here last
year," said Allen Ruby, Phi Psi resi
dent assistant. "But over the summer
several thousand dollars of capital im
provements were put into the house,
and as a result many possible fire
hazards were eliminated."
"We realize there is a fire hazard,
since this is one of the older houses
on campus," president Bill Holt said.
"We make sure that everyone knows
every exit, and knows it well. We
don't have fire drills, although we've
thought about it."
"We try not to use extension cords,"
he noted. "We also use very low amp

fuses. We do blow a lot of fuses,
because the wiring is overloaded.
We use low fuses to blow the
wiring and not the house."
"The fire department has re
ally laid down the law this year,"
Holt explained. All inside doors
have been replaced with solid
wood doors, which have a much
longer burning time. He said the
house had taken action on about
half of the fire marshal's list so
far, and is currently working
on the rest.
"Basically, they've let the
houses be below standards be
cause everyone knew that they
couldn't meet state standards,"
said Holt. He was glad to see
the fire marshal take a more
active interest in the fraternities
to relieve some of the dangers.
Beta Chi was less willing to
talk about their dealings with
the fire department than some
other fraternities. Mel Ellis, fra
ternity president, claimed that
"Beta Chi is in no worse condi
tion than the row houses."
The fire department called for
several improvements at the
Beta Chi house, however. These
included enclosing open stair
wells and extending one fire es
cape, which ends about seven
feet from the ground.
Quick-Set Latches
Also, the fraternity must re
place quick-set latches which
are on the doors to the bed
rooms. These violate the fire
code because special manipula
tion of the handle is required to
open them.
"The fire marshal came up to
the house last Wednesday, and
told us we did not have to make
expensive repairs," Ellis said.
He was upset with a September
16th inspection of the house
which precipitated a four page

set of correction orders from the
fire marshal. Ellis termed many
of the recommendations "pica
yune."
More than three quarters of
the recommendations had now
been carried out. "We're not
interested in taking risks with
health and fire dangers," he said.
Phi Sigma Kappa seems to
have more troubles than most,
which is to be expected, consider
ing their house was originally
a barn. But they don't let this
faze them.
Not A Deathtrap
Bruce Black, Phi Sig presi
dent said, "Our house is not a
deathtrap, but we know it's not
entirely safe, and that makes it
kind of exciting living here."
"We've never had a fire drill,"
he noted, but emphasized that
the house tries to make sure
that everyone is familiar with all
of the ways out of the house.
"We might lose the house in a
bad fire, but there are plenty of
ways of getting out," Black said.
The Phi Sig house has two fire
escapes, one of the ladder type,
the other with a platform and
ladder.
The officers of the fraternity
met with Fire Marshal Wiggins
last Thursday.
"He was fairly pleased with
what we'd done since they in
spected the house September 23,"
Black said, although many im
provements still have to be
made.
Rewiring Still Needed
The main work still to be
done is in rewiring. This basic
ally consists of getting more out
lets in the rooms, rather than
using extension cords.
"The fire department has nev
er been very happy, but every
one knows that we're going to
move sooner or later. Mayfield

Avenue is scheduled to corm
through our living room," saic
Black. The Fire Department
sent the Phi Sigs a four page
letter listing deficiencies early
in October.
The fire department asked
that exit signs be displayed, and
demanded that the stairwell be
sealed off at the top and bottom.
The Cornell University fire ear
lier this year resulted in several
deaths due to poisonous smoke
traveling through an open stair
well.
This remains to be done, al
though it has already been con
tracted for, and Black expects
it to be completed by the end of
the week. Another major change
is building a new fire escape
over the kitchen, from the sec
ond floor. The present one is
merely an old wooden ladder.
Much Already Completed
Phi Sig has already complied
with many of the fire depart
ment's requests, including par
titioning off the attic, fixing
broken plaster to prevent the
spread of fire through walls, and
putting up two heavy wooden
doors to replace old, more easily
ignited ones.
Over at Jordan House, a
women's residence, the main
trouble seems to be with the
fire department, rather than
with the house.
Ann Grekel, a Jordan resident,
related an incident that occurred
two years ago. On two consecu
tive Tuesdays, someone broke
into the house at 3:30 a.m. and
set off the fire alarm.
The first time this happened,
the firemen took over half
an hour to arrive. They didn't
seem to know where Jordan
House was, and got confused
with Jordan Hall and Jordan
Quad.
The firemen have been at Jor
dan two other times recently.
Once was because of a short
circuit, and the other was caused
by a gas leak.
Several Blown Fuses
There were several blown
fuses in the house last year.
Miss Grekel said, "You learn
not to use extension cords, and
that you can't put a coffee pot
and a light on the same outlet."
Jordan House is equipped with
fire escapes, of the crank-down
ladder type. There is one at
each end of the second floors. "I
assume they're not rusty," Gre
kel said, adding that she had nev
er known any student to actually
test one. There is ivy partially
growing over one of the ladders,
she added.
Miss Grekel also noted that
fire drills are somewhat strange.
"You run down the stairs and
meet in the front hall," she said,
"because the only convenient
exit is at the front of the house."
Meanwhile, Fire Marshal Wig
gins is trying to make it as easy
as possible for the residents of
these unsafe houses.
"We're here to help people,"
emphasized Wiggins. "We don't
want one penny more spent on
changes than has to be."
Life Most Important
He noted, 'The primary em
phasis of the code is placed on
saving life, not property damage.
Enclosed stairwells are the most
important single feature."
Dan Williams, assistant dean
of students for fraternities, ex
plained there are three main
problems with fraternities: in

the required sixty degree slope,
and wiring is faulty.

fraternity manager, said, "The

over the kitchen, from the sec
ond floor. The present one is
merely an old wooden ladder.
Much Already Completed
Phi Sig has already complied
with many of the fire depart
ment's requests, including par
titioning off the attic, fixing
broken plaster to prevent the
spread of fire through walls, and
putting up two heavy wooden
doors to replace old, more easily
ignited ones.
Over at Jordan House, a
women's residence, the main
trouble seems to be with the
fire department, rather than
with the house.
Ann Grekel, a Jordan resident,
related an incident that occurred
two years ago. On two consecu
tive Tuesdays, someone broke
into the house at 3:30 a.m. and
set off the fire alarm.
The first time this happened,
the firemen took over half
an hour to arrive. They didn't
seem to know where Jordan
House was, and got confused
with Jordan Hall and Jordan
Quad.
The firemen have been at Jor
dan two other times recently.
Once was because of a short
circuit, and the other was caused
by a gas leak.
Several Blown Fuses
There were several blown
fuses in the house last year.
Miss Grekel said, "You learn
not to use extension cords, and
that you can't put a coffee pot
and a light on the same outlet."
Jordan House is equipped with
fire escapes, of the crank-down
ladder type. There is one at
each end of the second floors. "I
assume they're not rusty," Gre
kel said, adding that she had nev
er known any student to actually
test one. There is ivy partially
growing over one of the ladders,
she added.
Miss Grekel also noted that
fire drills are somewhat strange.
"You run down the stairs and
meet in the front hall," she said,
"because the only convenient
exit is at the front of the house."
Meanwhile, Fire Marshal Wig
gins is trying to make it as easy
as possible for the residents of
these unsafe houses.
"We're here to help people,"
emphasized Wiggins. "We don't
want one penny more spent on
changes than has to be."
Life Most Important
He noted, 'The primary em
phasis of the code is placed on
saving life, not property damage.
Enclosed stairwells are the most
important single feature."
Dan Williams, assistant dean
of students for fraternities, ex
plained there are three main
problems with fraternities: in
terior stairwells are not en
closed, fire escapes do not meet
the required sixty degree slope,
and wiring is faulty.
"All but one or two of the old
houses fails to meet all three
criteria," he said.
Robert Summers, university
fraternity manager, said, "The
University is not neutral. Either

the University owns the houses
or the land. So we're very inter
ested in seeing that the law is
complied with." *
Fiscal Problems
"There are definite money
problems," said Scoles, assistant
business manager for housing.
The University has granted
loans to four fraternities to
make repairs and replacements.
"We haven't turned down any
loan requests yet," he said.
Apparently no house will be
required to do extensive rewir
ing. This would have been the
single most expensive item that
a house would have to do, ex
plained Scoles.
Williams explained the maxi
mum expenditure on a single
house would be $800. "Those
moving into clusters won't have
to spend as much money," he
added, because the fire marshal
only requires that progress is
being made, not that all pro
posed corrections be undertaken
immediately.
Pleased With Response
Williams said, "I've been ex
tremely pleased with the re
sponse of the fraternities. No
body's had to be convinced that
the issue is serious."
Fire Marshal Wiggins pointed
out that fraternities are not be
ing singled out for study. The
fraternities are being studied as
part of an overall study of fire
potential in University groups.
Fire safety procedures, in
cluding fire drills, in the row
houses have recently come un
der the scrutiny of a group of
University officers. Assistant
Dean of Students Sally Mahoney
noted that fire safety is largely
just making sure that people
have correct information.
Fire Alarm Operation
"For example, in all Univer
sity owned residences except the
Row, the fire alarm triggers a
device at the fire department.
In the eight Row houses, the fire
alarm is internal. One must call
the fire department on the tele
phone or use the fire alarm box
on the street," she said.

She feels that a rational dis
cussion of fire hazards in a spe
cific residence would be more
useful than a pre-announced
night-time fire drill. "The prob
lems are different in Storey than
in Jordan House, or in Stern
Hall."
Carlee Mack, director of the
row houses, commented on fire
drills that "what we were doing
in the past is quite inadequate."
"We had talks about fire pre
vention last year. We talked
about revising the fire drills last
year," she said. "I rather doubt
if everyone running to the end
of the hall with their coat and
shoes on would be adequate in a
real fire."
And sometimes the real fire
happens. On April 25, 1966,
faulty wiring in the wooden Phi

Kappa Sigma house on Mayfield
Avenue started a fire that gutted
the attic and third floor.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books and oth
er belongings out the windows.
Fire extinguishers were broken
out but most malfunctioned.
Twenty-two Stanford firemen
fought the blaze and prevented
total destruction of the house.
Before they had the fire under
control, student firemen had to
enter the burning building where
several had their clothing
burned by the surrounding
flames.
Fire chief John Marston said
then he was "thankful there
wasn't much wind. If there had
been, the fire could easily have
spread to other buildings."
Stanford escaped that fire with

no loss of life and $50,000 prop
erty damage. No one knows if
we'll be so lucky next time a
wire burns out on the Row.


The Phi Psi house pictured here is one of the oldest on campus;
it has an estimated burning time of ten minutes. The fire escape
seen here is one of a number of fire hazards at the house due to
its vertical rather than 60 degree tilt.

Not one of the more recently erected campus residences, Jordan has its share of death traps. Seen
here is an erstwhile fire escape almost completely blocked by indigenous shrubbery.
While fraternity cluster number
three rises behind Wilbur Hall, and
cluster number four looms nebulously
in the future, the residents of many of
the houses which the clusters will re

place wait nervously in buildings
which are little more than fire traps.
Stanford's aged fraternity houses
— some as old as the University —
find it hard to meet the fire prevention
standards of the 20th century.
Phi Sigma Kappa's main worry is

people throwing cigarettes on the
floor, according to fraternity president
Bruce Black. If anything larger than
a wastepaper basket catches fire, he
fears "the whole house will go."
Phi Kappa Psi spent $28,000 on reno
vations over the summer and cleared
up their two main fire hazards, the
kitchen and the attic, but if any good
sized portion of the house starts burn
ing, residents say nothing will prevent
the rest from burning, too.
Seventeen members of homeless
Alpha Sigma Phi are living in Man
zanita House, which has an estimated
total burning time of six minutes, ac
cording to the fire department.
Meanwhile, the future of these
houses is uncertain. Phi Sig's move
into a cluster is "several years away"
at best, according to Black.
And Phi Psi's house manager said
that estimates on when his fraternity
would move range from eight to 20
years.
Increased County Pressure
Meanwhile, the fraternities and Uni
versity-owned row houses are being
subjected to increased pressure from
the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea
sures are all that can be accomplished,
because the structures are in such
poor condition that steps which would
save property in a fire are no longer
feasible undertakings.
Health And Safety
At the Phi Sig house, the improve
ments were made "only for the pur
poses of health and safety," president
Black said.
The changes are only so that every
one can get out of the place if it does
catch fire. A lot of property would be
lost, he noted, "but there is nothing
that can be done about that," because
the building is so old.
The 60 or 70 year-old former bam
"is crumbling already," Black remark
ed. But despite the difficulties, the fra
ternity has already had much work
done to remove some of the hazards,
and more is planned.
Still, if the house caught fire, "it
would be an all or nothing proposi
tion," as Phi Sig Doug Gunesch said.
Same At Phi Psi
Bill Holt, Phi Psi president, expres
sed similar feelings. "If there were
ever a fire on the first floor a lot of
guys might be killed," he said.
The University has not ignored the
problems of the fraternities and some
of the women's row houses. The most
luxurious student housing on campus
has been built to replace the old wood
en houses. These are the fraternity
clusters, two now completed around
Lake Lagunita, a third rapidly rising
on Campus drive, and a fourth plan
ned.

But the occupied old fraternities re
main. The eight women's row houses,
although owned by the University and
more closely supervised, have prob
lems, too.
For all the old residences, admits
Edward Scoles, assistant business
manager for University housing, "Fire
danger is one of the major problems.
They are all in bad shape."
First Frat Inspection
The first inspection of the old fra
ternities by the county fire marshal
was in 1957. As a result of that inves
tigation and other surveys undertaken
by the University, the decision to re
locate the fraternities in new cluster
housing was made.
Scoles noted that some of the fra
ternity buildings at that time were re
garded as having "minus years life."
Although the twenty year cluster
program was undertaken to remove
the fraternities from potentially un
safe quarters, apparently the Univer
sity did not feel 'iny clear and present
danger, for the earliest occupants of
the cluster program were chosen on
the basis of finance rather than build
ing deterioration.
'The Theta Delts moved into cluster
number one, although their house was
in good shape," said Scoles.
The state fire code was extremely
permissive until 1963. It was strength
ened in 1965. The tough inspections of
1967 are among the first under the
new code.
Scoles believes the typhoid scare at
Beta House last spring "focused atten
tion on all housing regulations. Coun

ty and state officials got alarmed over
typhoid. The fire marshal has put on
a more intense campaign than in pre
vious years."
Fire Marshal Bruce Wiggins agreed
the campaign is more intense, but
says it is mere coincidence. A lack of
manpower in former years prevented
rigorous investigation.
Will Meet All Frats
Wiggins has met with or plans to
meet with, each of the sixteen fra
ternities before the end of November,
to discuss the specific items that need
to be completed for each house.
Already, after only seven meetings,
Wiggins is pleased. "We have found
marked progress on our return in
spection tours," he said.
Many of the houses have similar
troubles, but they have been getting
cooperation from the fire department
in fixing them.
'The fire people were quite con
cerned about the situation here last
year," said Allen Ruby, Phi Psi resi
dent assistant. "But over the summer
several thousand dollars of capital im
provements were put into the house,
and as a result many possible fire
hazards were eliminated."
"We realize there is a fire hazard,
since this is one of the older houses
on campus," president Bill Holt said.
"We make sure that everyone knows
every exit, and knows it well. We
don't have fire drills, although we've
thought about it."
"We try not to use extension cords,"
he noted. "We also use very low amp

fuses. We do blow a lot of fuses,
because the wiring is overloaded.
We use low fuses to blow the
wiring and not the house."
"The fire department has re
ally laid down the law this year,"
Holt explained. All inside doors
have been replaced with solid
wood doors, which have a much
longer burning time. He said the
house had taken action on about
half of the fire marshal's list so
far, and is currently working
on the rest.
"Basically, they've let the
houses be below standards be
cause everyone knew that they
couldn't meet state standards,"
said Holt. He was glad to see
the fire marshal take a more
active interest in the fraternities
to relieve some of the dangers.
Beta Chi was less willing to
talk about their dealings with
the fire department than some
other fraternities. Mel Ellis, fra
ternity president, claimed that
"Beta Chi is in no worse condi
tion than the row houses."
The fire department called for
several improvements at the
Beta Chi house, however. These
included enclosing open stair
wells and extending one fire es
cape, which ends about seven
feet from the ground.
Quick-Set Latches
Also, the fraternity must re
place quick-set latches which
are on the doors to the bed
rooms. These violate the fire
code because special manipula
tion of the handle is required to
open them.
"The fire marshal came up to
the house last Wednesday, and
told us we did not have to make
expensive repairs," Ellis said.
He was upset with a September
16th inspection of the house
which precipitated a four page

set of correction orders from the
fire marshal. Ellis termed many
of the recommendations "pica
yune."
More than three quarters of
the recommendations had now
been carried out. "We're not
interested in taking risks with
health and fire dangers," he said.
Phi Sigma Kappa seems to
have more troubles than most,
which is to be expected, consider
ing their house was originally
a barn. But they don't let this
faze them.
Not A Deathtrap
Bruce Black, Phi Sig presi
dent said, "Our house is not a
deathtrap, but we know it's not
entirely safe, and that makes it
kind of exciting living here."
"We've never had a fire drill,"
he noted, but emphasized that
the house tries to make sure
that everyone is familiar with all
of the ways out of the house.
"We might lose the house in a
bad fire, but there are plenty of
ways of getting out," Black said.
The Phi Sig house has two fire
escapes, one of the ladder type,
the other with a platform and
ladder.
The officers of the fraternity
met with Fire Marshal Wiggins
last Thursday.
"He was fairly pleased with
what we'd done since they in
spected the house September 23,"
Black said, although many im
provements still have to be
made.
Rewiring Still Needed
The main work still to be
done is in rewiring. This basic
ally consists of getting more out
lets in the rooms, rather than
using extension cords.
"The fire department has nev
er been very happy, but every
one knows that we're going to
move sooner or later. Mayfield

Avenue is scheduled to corm
through our living room," saic
Black. The Fire Department
sent the Phi Sigs a four page
letter listing deficiencies early
in October.
The fire department asked
that exit signs be displayed, and
demanded that the stairwell be
sealed off at the top and bottom.
The Cornell University fire ear
lier this year resulted in several
deaths due to poisonous smoke
traveling through an open stair
well.
This remains to be done, al
though it has already been con
tracted for, and Black expects
it to be completed by the end of
the week. Another major change
is building a new fire escape
over the kitchen, from the sec
ond floor. The present one is
merely an old wooden ladder.
Much Already Completed
Phi Sig has already complied
with many of the fire depart
ment's requests, including par
titioning off the attic, fixing
broken plaster to prevent the
spread of fire through walls, and
putting up two heavy wooden
doors to replace old, more easily
ignited ones.

ladder type. There is one at

kel said, adding that she had nev

More than three quarters of
the recommendations had now
been carried out. "We're not
interested in taking risks with
health and fire dangers," he said.
Phi Sigma Kappa seems to
have more troubles than most,
which is to be expected, consider
ing their house was originally
a barn. But they don't let this
faze them.
Not A Deathtrap
Bruce Black, Phi Sig presi
dent said, "Our house is not a
deathtrap, but we know it's not
entirely safe, and that makes it
kind of exciting living here."
"We've never had a fire drill,"
he noted, but emphasized that
the house tries to make sure
that everyone is familiar with all
of the ways out of the house.
"We might lose the house in a
bad fire, but there are plenty of
ways of getting out," Black said.
The Phi Sig house has two fire
escapes, one of the ladder type,
the other with a platform and
ladder.
The officers of the fraternity
met with Fire Marshal Wiggins
last Thursday.
"He was fairly pleased with
what we'd done since they in
spected the house September 23,"
Black said, although many im
provements still have to be
made.
Rewiring Still Needed
The main work still to be
done is in rewiring. This basic
ally consists of getting more out
lets in the rooms, rather than
using extension cords.
"The fire department has nev
er been very happy, but every
one knows that we're going to
move sooner or later. Mayfield

Avenue is scheduled to corm
through our living room," saic
Black. The Fire Department
sent the Phi Sigs a four page
letter listing deficiencies early
in October.
The fire department asked
that exit signs be displayed, and
demanded that the stairwell be
sealed off at the top and bottom.
The Cornell University fire ear
lier this year resulted in several
deaths due to poisonous smoke
traveling through an open stair
well.
This remains to be done, al
though it has already been con
tracted for, and Black expects
it to be completed by the end of
the week. Another major change
is building a new fire escape
over the kitchen, from the sec
ond floor. The present one is
merely an old wooden ladder.
Much Already Completed
Phi Sig has already complied
with many of the fire depart
ment's requests, including par
titioning off the attic, fixing
broken plaster to prevent the
spread of fire through walls, and
putting up two heavy wooden
doors to replace old, more easily
ignited ones.
Over at Jordan House, a
women's residence, the main
trouble seems to be with the
fire department, rather than
with the house.
Ann Grekel, a Jordan resident,
related an incident that occurred
two years ago. On two consecu
tive Tuesdays, someone broke
into the house at 3:30 a.m. and
set off the fire alarm.
The first time this happened,
the firemen took over half
an hour to arrive. They didn't
seem to know where Jordan
House was, and got confused
with Jordan Hall and Jordan
Quad.
The firemen have been at Jor
dan two other times recently.
Once was because of a short
circuit, and the other was caused
by a gas leak.
Several Blown Fuses
There were several blown
fuses in the house last year.
Miss Grekel said, "You learn
not to use extension cords, and
that you can't put a coffee pot
and a light on the same outlet."
Jordan House is equipped with
fire escapes, of the crank-down
ladder type. There is one at
each end of the second floors. "I
assume they're not rusty," Gre
kel said, adding that she had nev
er known any student to actually
test one. There is ivy partially
growing over one of the ladders,
she added.
Miss Grekel also noted that
fire drills are somewhat strange.
"You run down the stairs and
meet in the front hall," she said,
"because the only convenient
exit is at the front of the house."
Meanwhile, Fire Marshal Wig
gins is trying to make it as easy
as possible for the residents of
these unsafe houses.
"We're here to help people,"
emphasized Wiggins. "We don't
want one penny more spent on
changes than has to be."
Life Most Important
He noted, 'The primary em
phasis of the code is placed on
saving life, not property damage.
Enclosed stairwells are the most
important single feature."
Dan Williams, assistant dean
of students for fraternities, ex
plained there are three main
problems with fraternities: in
terior stairwells are not en
closed, fire escapes do not meet
the required sixty degree slope,
and wiring is faulty.
"All but one or two of the old
houses fails to meet all three
criteria," he said.
Robert Summers, university
fraternity manager, said, "The
University is not neutral. Either

the University owns the houses
or the land. So we're very inter
ested in seeing that the law is
complied with." *
Fiscal Problems
"There are definite money
problems," said Scoles, assistant
business manager for housing.
The University has granted
loans to four fraternities to
make repairs and replacements.
"We haven't turned down any
loan requests yet," he said.
Apparently no house will be
required to do extensive rewir
ing. This would have been the
single most expensive item that
a house would have to do, ex
plained Scoles.
Williams explained the maxi
mum expenditure on a single
house would be $800. "Those
moving into clusters won't have
to spend as much money," he
added, because the fire marshal
only requires that progress is
being made, not that all pro
posed corrections be undertaken
immediately.
Pleased With Response
Williams said, "I've been ex
tremely pleased with the re
sponse of the fraternities. No
body's had to be convinced that
the issue is serious."
Fire Marshal Wiggins pointed
out that fraternities are not be
ing singled out for study. The
fraternities are being studied as
part of an overall study of fire
potential in University groups.
Fire safety procedures, in
cluding fire drills, in the row
houses have recently come un
der the scrutiny of a group of
University officers. Assistant
Dean of Students Sally Mahoney
noted that fire safety is largely
just making sure that people
have correct information.
Fire Alarm Operation
"For example, in all Univer
sity owned residences except the
Row, the fire alarm triggers a
device at the fire department.
In the eight Row houses, the fire
alarm is internal. One must call
the fire department on the tele
phone or use the fire alarm box
on the street," she said.

She feels that a rational dis
cussion of fire hazards in a spe
cific residence would be more
useful than a pre-announced
night-time fire drill. "The prob
lems are different in Storey than
in Jordan House, or in Stern
Hall."
Carlee Mack, director of the
row houses, commented on fire
drills that "what we were doing
in the past is quite inadequate."
"We had talks about fire pre
vention last year. We talked
about revising the fire drills last
year," she said. "I rather doubt
if everyone running to the end
of the hall with their coat and
shoes on would be adequate in a
real fire."
And sometimes the real fire
happens. On April 25, 1966,
faulty wiring in the wooden Phi

Kappa Sigma house on Mayfield
Avenue started a fire that gutted
the attic and third floor.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books and oth
er belongings out the windows.
Fire extinguishers were broken
out but most malfunctioned.
Twenty-two Stanford firemen
fought the blaze and prevented
total destruction of the house.
Before they had the fire under
control, student firemen had to
enter the burning building where
several had their clothing
burned by the surrounding
flames.
Fire chief John Marston said
then he was "thankful there
wasn't much wind. If there had
been, the fire could easily have
spread to other buildings."
Stanford escaped that fire with

no loss of life and $50,000 prop
erty damage. No one knows if
we'll be so lucky next time a
wire burns out on the Row.


The Phi Psi house pictured here is one of the oldest on campus;
it has an estimated burning time of ten minutes. The fire escape
seen here is one of a number of fire hazards at the house due to
its vertical rather than 60 degree tilt.

Not one of the more recently erected campus residences, Jordan has its share of death traps. Seen
here is an erstwhile fire escape almost completely blocked by indigenous shrubbery.
While fraternity cluster number
three rises behind Wilbur Hall, and
cluster number four looms nebulously
in the future, the residents of many of
the houses which the clusters will re

place wait nervously in buildings
which are little more than fire traps.
Stanford's aged fraternity houses
— some as old as the University —
find it hard to meet the fire prevention
standards of the 20th century.
Phi Sigma Kappa's main worry is

people throwing cigarettes on the
floor, according to fraternity president
Bruce Black. If anything larger than
a wastepaper basket catches fire, he
fears "the whole house will go."
Phi Kappa Psi spent $28,000 on reno
vations over the summer and cleared
up their two main fire hazards, the
kitchen and the attic, but if any good
sized portion of the house starts burn
ing, residents say nothing will prevent
the rest from burning, too.
Seventeen members of homeless
Alpha Sigma Phi are living in Man
zanita House, which has an estimated
total burning time of six minutes, ac
cording to the fire department.
Meanwhile, the future of these
houses is uncertain. Phi Sig's move
into a cluster is "several years away"
at best, according to Black.
And Phi Psi's house manager said
that estimates on when his fraternity
would move range from eight to 20
years.
Increased County Pressure
Meanwhile, the fraternities and Uni
versity-owned row houses are being
subjected to increased pressure from
the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea
sures are all that can be accomplished,
because the structures are in such
poor condition that steps which would
save property in a fire are no longer
feasible undertakings.
Health And Safety
At the Phi Sig house, the improve
ments were made "only for the pur
poses of health and safety," president
Black said.
The changes are only so that every
one can get out of the place if it does
catch fire. A lot of property would be
lost, he noted, "but there is nothing
that can be done about that," because
the building is so old.
The 60 or 70 year-old former bam
"is crumbling already," Black remark
ed. But despite the difficulties, the fra
ternity has already had much work
done to remove some of the hazards,
and more is planned.
Still, if the house caught fire, "it
would be an all or nothing proposi
tion," as Phi Sig Doug Gunesch said.
Same At Phi Psi
Bill Holt, Phi Psi president, expres
sed similar feelings. "If there were
ever a fire on the first floor a lot of
guys might be killed," he said.
The University has not ignored the
problems of the fraternities and some
of the women's row houses. The most
luxurious student housing on campus
has been built to replace the old wood
en houses. These are the fraternity
clusters, two now completed around
Lake Lagunita, a third rapidly rising
on Campus drive, and a fourth plan
ned.

But the occupied old fraternities re
main. The eight women's row houses,
although owned by the University and
more closely supervised, have prob
lems, too.
For all the old residences, admits
Edward Scoles, assistant business
manager for University housing, "Fire
danger is one of the major problems.
They are all in bad shape."
First Frat Inspection
The first inspection of the old fra
ternities by the county fire marshal
was in 1957. As a result of that inves
tigation and other surveys undertaken
by the University, the decision to re
locate the fraternities in new cluster
housing was made.
Scoles noted that some of the fra
ternity buildings at that time were re
garded as having "minus years life."
Although the twenty year cluster
program was undertaken to remove
the fraternities from potentially un
safe quarters, apparently the Univer
sity did not feel 'iny clear and present
danger, for the earliest occupants of
the cluster program were chosen on
the basis of finance rather than build
ing deterioration.
'The Theta Delts moved into cluster
number one, although their house was
in good shape," said Scoles.
The state fire code was extremely
permissive until 1963. It was strength
ened in 1965. The tough inspections of
1967 are among the first under the
new code.
Scoles believes the typhoid scare at
Beta House last spring "focused atten
tion on all housing regulations. Coun

ty and state officials got alarmed over
typhoid. The fire marshal has put on
a more intense campaign than in pre
vious years."
Fire Marshal Bruce Wiggins agreed
the campaign is more intense, but
says it is mere coincidence. A lack of
manpower in former years prevented
rigorous investigation.
Will Meet All Frats
Wiggins has met with or plans to
meet with, each of the sixteen fra
ternities before the end of November,
to discuss the specific items that need
to be completed for each house.
Already, after only seven meetings,
Wiggins is pleased. "We have found
marked progress on our return in
spection tours," he said.
Many of the houses have similar
troubles, but they have been getting
cooperation from the fire department
in fixing them.
'The fire people were quite con
cerned about the situation here last
year," said Allen Ruby, Phi Psi resi
dent assistant. "But over the summer
several thousand dollars of capital im
provements were put into the house,
and as a result many possible fire

"We realize there is a fire hazard,
since this is one of the older houses
on campus," president Bill Holt said.
"We make sure that everyone knows
every exit, and knows it well. We
don't have fire drills, although we've
thought about it."
"We try not to use extension cords,"
he noted. "We also use very low amp

fuses. We do blow a lot of fuses,
because the wiring is overloaded.
We use low fuses to blow the
wiring and not the house."
"The fire department has re
ally laid down the law this year,"
Holt explained. All inside doors
have been replaced with solid
wood doors, which have a much
longer burning time. He said the
house had taken action on about
half of the fire marshal's list so
far, and is currently working
on the rest.
"Basically, they've let the
houses be below standards be
cause everyone knew that they
couldn't meet state standards,"
said Holt. He was glad to see
the fire marshal take a more
active interest in the fraternities
to relieve some of the dangers.
Beta Chi was less willing to
talk about their dealings with
the fire department than some
other fraternities. Mel Ellis, fra
ternity president, claimed that
"Beta Chi is in no worse condi
tion than the row houses."
The fire department called for
several improvements at the
Beta Chi house, however. These
included enclosing open stair
wells and extending one fire es
cape, which ends about seven
feet from the ground.
Quick-Set Latches
Also, the fraternity must re
place quick-set latches which
are on the doors to the bed
rooms. These violate the fire
code because special manipula
tion of the handle is required to
open them.
"The fire marshal came up to
the house last Wednesday, and
told us we did not have to make
expensive repairs," Ellis said.
He was upset with a September
16th inspection of the house
which precipitated a four page

set of correction orders from the
fire marshal. Ellis termed many
of the recommendations "pica
yune."
More than three quarters of
the recommendations had now
been carried out. "We're not
interested in taking risks with
health and fire dangers," he said.
Phi Sigma Kappa seems to
have more troubles than most,
which is to be expected, consider
ing their house was originally
a barn. But they don't let this
faze them.

At one of the older frat houses on campus, a multi-functional
wooden ladder serves as a fire escape, and also as a handy laundry
dryer.
While fraternity cluster number
three rises behind Wilbur Hall, and
cluster number four looms nebulously
in the future, the residents of many of
the houses which the clusters will re

place wait nervously in buildings
which are little more than fire traps.
Stanford's aged fraternity houses
— some as old as the University —
find it hard to meet the fire prevention
standards of the 20th century.
Phi Sigma Kappa's main worry is

people throwing cigarettes on the
floor, according to fraternity president
Bruce Black. If anything larger than
a wastepaper basket catches fire, he
fears "the whole house will go."
Phi Kappa Psi spent $28,000 on reno
vations over the summer and cleared
up their two main fire hazards, the
kitchen and the attic, but if any good
sized portion of the house starts burn
ing, residents say nothing will prevent
the rest from burning, too.
Seventeen members of homeless
Alpha Sigma Phi are living in Man
zanita House, which has an estimated
total burning time of six minutes, ac
cording to the fire department.
Meanwhile, the future of these
houses is uncertain. Phi Sig's move
into a cluster is "several years away"
at best, according to Black.
And Phi Psi's house manager said
that estimates on when his fraternity
would move range from eight to 20
years.
Increased County Pressure
Meanwhile, the fraternities and Uni
versity-owned row houses are being
subjected to increased pressure from
the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea
sures are all that can be accomplished,
because the structures are in such
poor condition that steps which would
save property in a fire are no longer
feasible undertakings.
Health And Safety
At the Phi Sig house, the improve
ments were made "only for the pur
poses of health and safety," president
Black said.
The changes are only so that every
one can get out of the place if it does
catch fire. A lot of property would be
lost, he noted, "but there is nothing
that can be done about that," because
the building is so old.
The 60 or 70 year-old former bam
"is crumbling already," Black remark
ed. But despite the difficulties, the fra
ternity has already had much work
done to remove some of the hazards,
and more is planned.
Still, if the house caught fire, "it
would be an all or nothing proposi
tion," as Phi Sig Doug Gunesch said.
Same At Phi Psi
Bill Holt, Phi Psi president, expres
sed similar feelings. "If there were
ever a fire on the first floor a lot of
guys might be killed," he said.
The University has not ignored the
problems of the fraternities and some
of the women's row houses. The most
luxurious student housing on campus
has been built to replace the old wood
en houses. These are the fraternity
clusters, two now completed around
Lake Lagunita, a third rapidly rising
on Campus drive, and a fourth plan
ned.

But the occupied old fraternities re
main. The eight women's row houses,
although owned by the University and
more closely supervised, have prob
lems, too.
For all the old residences, admits
Edward Scoles, assistant business
manager for University housing, "Fire
danger is one of the major problems.
They are all in bad shape."
First Frat Inspection
The first inspection of the old fra
ternities by the county fire marshal
was in 1957. As a result of that inves
tigation and other surveys undertaken
by the University, the decision to re
locate the fraternities in new cluster
housing was made.
Scoles noted that some of the fra
ternity buildings at that time were re
garded as having "minus years life."
Although the twenty year cluster
program was undertaken to remove
the fraternities from potentially un
safe quarters, apparently the Univer
sity did not feel 'iny clear and present
danger, for the earliest occupants of
the cluster program were chosen on
the basis of finance rather than build
ing deterioration.
'The Theta Delts moved into cluster
number one, although their house was
in good shape," said Scoles.
The state fire code was extremely
permissive until 1963. It was strength
ened in 1965. The tough inspections of
1967 are among the first under the
new code.
Scoles believes the typhoid scare at
Beta House last spring "focused atten
tion on all housing regulations. Coun

ty and state officials got alarmed over
typhoid. The fire marshal has put on
a more intense campaign than in pre
vious years."
Fire Marshal Bruce Wiggins agreed
the campaign is more intense, but
says it is mere coincidence. A lack of
manpower in former years prevented
rigorous investigation.
Will Meet All Frats
Wiggins has met with or plans to
meet with, each of the sixteen fra
ternities before the end of November,
to discuss the specific items that need
to be completed for each house.
Already, after only seven meetings,
Wiggins is pleased. "We have found
marked progress on our return in
spection tours," he said.
Many of the houses have similar
troubles, but they have been getting
cooperation from the fire department
in fixing them.
'The fire people were quite con
cerned about the situation here last
year," said Allen Ruby, Phi Psi resi
dent assistant. "But over the summer
several thousand dollars of capital im
provements were put into the house,
and as a result many possible fire
hazards were eliminated."
"We realize there is a fire hazard,
since this is one of the older houses
on campus," president Bill Holt said.
"We make sure that everyone knows
every exit, and knows it well. We
don't have fire drills, although we've
thought about it."
"We try not to use extension cords,"
he noted. "We also use very low amp

fuses. We do blow a lot of fuses,
because the wiring is overloaded.
We use low fuses to blow the
wiring and not the house."
"The fire department has re
ally laid down the law this year,"
Holt explained. All inside doors
have been replaced with solid
wood doors, which have a much
longer burning time. He said the
house had taken action on about
half of the fire marshal's list so
far, and is currently working
on the rest.
"Basically, they've let the
houses be below standards be
cause everyone knew that they
couldn't meet state standards,"
said Holt. He was glad to see
the fire marshal take a more
active interest in the fraternities
to relieve some of the dangers.
Beta Chi was less willing to
talk about their dealings with
the fire department than some
other fraternities. Mel Ellis, fra
ternity president, claimed that
"Beta Chi is in no worse condi
tion than the row houses."
The fire department called for
several improvements at the
Beta Chi house, however. These
included enclosing open stair
wells and extending one fire es
cape, which ends about seven
feet from the ground.
Quick-Set Latches
Also, the fraternity must re
place quick-set latches which
are on the doors to the bed
rooms. These violate the fire
code because special manipula
tion of the handle is required to
open them.
"The fire marshal came up to
the house last Wednesday, and
told us we did not have to make
expensive repairs," Ellis said.
He was upset with a September
16th inspection of the house
which precipitated a four page

set of correction orders from the
fire marshal. Ellis termed many
of the recommendations "pica
yune."
More than three quarters of
the recommendations had now
been carried out. "We're not
interested in taking risks with
health and fire dangers," he said.
Phi Sigma Kappa seems to
have more troubles than most,
which is to be expected, consider
ing their house was originally
a barn. But they don't let this
faze them.
Not A Deathtrap
Bruce Black, Phi Sig presi
dent said, "Our house is not a
deathtrap, but we know it's not
entirely safe, and that makes it
kind of exciting living here."
"We've never had a fire drill,"
he noted, but emphasized that
the house tries to make sure
that everyone is familiar with all
of the ways out of the house.
"We might lose the house in a
bad fire, but there are plenty of
ways of getting out," Black said.
The Phi Sig house has two fire
escapes, one of the ladder type,
the other with a platform and
ladder.
The officers of the fraternity
met with Fire Marshal Wiggins
last Thursday.
"He was fairly pleased with
what we'd done since they in
spected the house September 23,"
Black said, although many im
provements still have to be
made.
Rewiring Still Needed
The main work still to be
done is in rewiring. This basic
ally consists of getting more out
lets in the rooms, rather than
using extension cords.
"The fire department has nev
er been very happy, but every
one knows that we're going to
move sooner or later. Mayfield

Avenue is scheduled to corm
through our living room," saic
Black. The Fire Department
sent the Phi Sigs a four page
letter listing deficiencies early
in October.
The fire department asked
that exit signs be displayed, and
demanded that the stairwell be
sealed off at the top and bottom.
The Cornell University fire ear
lier this year resulted in several
deaths due to poisonous smoke
traveling through an open stair
well.
This remains to be done, al
though it has already been con
tracted for, and Black expects
it to be completed by the end of
the week. Another major change
is building a new fire escape
over the kitchen, from the sec
ond floor. The present one is
merely an old wooden ladder.
Much Already Completed
Phi Sig has already complied
with many of the fire depart
ment's requests, including par
titioning off the attic, fixing
broken plaster to prevent the
spread of fire through walls, and
putting up two heavy wooden
doors to replace old, more easily
ignited ones.
Over at Jordan House, a
women's residence, the main
trouble seems to be with the
fire department, rather than
with the house.
Ann Grekel, a Jordan resident,
related an incident that occurred
two years ago. On two consecu
tive Tuesdays, someone broke
into the house at 3:30 a.m. and
set off the fire alarm.
The first time this happened,
the firemen took over half
an hour to arrive. They didn't
seem to know where Jordan
House was, and got confused
with Jordan Hall and Jordan
Quad.
The firemen have been at Jor
dan two other times recently.
Once was because of a short
circuit, and the other was caused
by a gas leak.
Several Blown Fuses
There were several blown
fuses in the house last year.
Miss Grekel said, "You learn
not to use extension cords, and
that you can't put a coffee pot
and a light on the same outlet."
Jordan House is equipped with
fire escapes, of the crank-down
ladder type. There is one at
each end of the second floors. "I
assume they're not rusty," Gre
kel said, adding that she had nev
er known any student to actually
test one. There is ivy partially
growing over one of the ladders,
she added.
Miss Grekel also noted that
fire drills are somewhat strange.
"You run down the stairs and
meet in the front hall," she said,
"because the only convenient
exit is at the front of the house."
Meanwhile, Fire Marshal Wig
gins is trying to make it as easy
as possible for the residents of
these unsafe houses.
"We're here to help people,"
emphasized Wiggins. "We don't
want one penny more spent on
changes than has to be."
Life Most Important
He noted, 'The primary em
phasis of the code is placed on
saving life, not property damage.
Enclosed stairwells are the most
important single feature."
Dan Williams, assistant dean
of students for fraternities, ex
plained there are three main
problems with fraternities: in
terior stairwells are not en
closed, fire escapes do not meet
the required sixty degree slope,
and wiring is faulty.
"All but one or two of the old
houses fails to meet all three
criteria," he said.
Robert Summers, university
fraternity manager, said, "The
University is not neutral. Either

the University owns the houses
or the land. So we're very inter
ested in seeing that the law is
complied with." *
Fiscal Problems
"There are definite money
problems," said Scoles, assistant
business manager for housing.
The University has granted
loans to four fraternities to
make repairs and replacements.
"We haven't turned down any
loan requests yet," he said.
Apparently no house will be
required to do extensive rewir
ing. This would have been the
single most expensive item that
a house would have to do, ex
plained Scoles.
Williams explained the maxi
mum expenditure on a single
house would be $800. "Those
moving into clusters won't have
to spend as much money," he
added, because the fire marshal
only requires that progress is
being made, not that all pro
posed corrections be undertaken
immediately.
Pleased With Response
Williams said, "I've been ex
tremely pleased with the re
sponse of the fraternities. No
body's had to be convinced that
the issue is serious."
Fire Marshal Wiggins pointed
out that fraternities are not be
ing singled out for study. The
fraternities are being studied as
part of an overall study of fire
potential in University groups.
Fire safety procedures, in
cluding fire drills, in the row
houses have recently come un
der the scrutiny of a group of
University officers. Assistant
Dean of Students Sally Mahoney
noted that fire safety is largely
just making sure that people
have correct information.
Fire Alarm Operation
"For example, in all Univer
sity owned residences except the
Row, the fire alarm triggers a
device at the fire department.
In the eight Row houses, the fire
alarm is internal. One must call
the fire department on the tele
phone or use the fire alarm box
on the street," she said.

She feels that a rational dis
cussion of fire hazards in a spe
cific residence would be more
useful than a pre-announced
night-time fire drill. "The prob
lems are different in Storey than
in Jordan House, or in Stern
Hall."
Carlee Mack, director of the
row houses, commented on fire
drills that "what we were doing
in the past is quite inadequate."
"We had talks about fire pre
vention last year. We talked
about revising the fire drills last
year," she said. "I rather doubt
if everyone running to the end
of the hall with their coat and
shoes on would be adequate in a
real fire."
And sometimes the real fire
happens. On April 25, 1966,
faulty wiring in the wooden Phi

Kappa Sigma house on Mayfield
Avenue started a fire that gutted
the attic and third floor.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books and oth
er belongings out the windows.
Fire extinguishers were broken
out but most malfunctioned.
Twenty-two Stanford firemen
fought the blaze and prevented
total destruction of the house.
Before they had the fire under
control, student firemen had to
enter the burning building where
several had their clothing
burned by the surrounding
flames.
Fire chief John Marston said
then he was "thankful there
wasn't much wind. If there had
been, the fire could easily have
spread to other buildings."
Stanford escaped that fire with

no loss of life and $50,000 prop
erty damage. No one knows if
we'll be so lucky next time a
wire burns out on the Row.


The Phi Psi house pictured here is one of the oldest on campus;
it has an estimated burning time of ten minutes. The fire escape
seen here is one of a number of fire hazards at the house due to
its vertical rather than 60 degree tilt.

While fraternity cluster number
three rises behind Wilbur Hall, and
cluster number four looms nebulously
in the future, the residents of many of
the houses which the clusters will re

place wait nervously in buildings
which are little more than fire traps.
Stanford's aged fraternity houses
— some as old as the University —
find it hard to meet the fire prevention
standards of the 20th century.
Phi Sigma Kappa's main worry is

people throwing cigarettes on the
floor, according to fraternity president
Bruce Black. If anything larger than
a wastepaper basket catches fire, he
fears "the whole house will go."
Phi Kappa Psi spent $28,000 on reno
vations over the summer and cleared
up their two main fire hazards, the
kitchen and the attic, but if any good
sized portion of the house starts burn
ing, residents say nothing will prevent
the rest from burning, too.
Seventeen members of homeless
Alpha Sigma Phi are living in Man
zanita House, which has an estimated
total burning time of six minutes, ac
cording to the fire department.
Meanwhile, the future of these
houses is uncertain. Phi Sig's move
into a cluster is "several years away"
at best, according to Black.
And Phi Psi's house manager said
that estimates on when his fraternity
would move range from eight to 20
years.
Increased County Pressure
Meanwhile, the fraternities and Uni
versity-owned row houses are being
subjected to increased pressure from
the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea
sures are all that can be accomplished,
because the structures are in such
poor condition that steps which would
save property in a fire are no longer
feasible undertakings.
Health And Safety
At the Phi Sig house, the improve
ments were made "only for the pur
poses of health and safety," president
Black said.
The changes are only so that every
one can get out of the place if it does
catch fire. A lot of property would be
lost, he noted, "but there is nothing
that can be done about that," because
the building is so old.
The 60 or 70 year-old former bam
"is crumbling already," Black remark
ed. But despite the difficulties, the fra
ternity has already had much work
done to remove some of the hazards,
and more is planned.
Still, if the house caught fire, "it
would be an all or nothing proposi
tion," as Phi Sig Doug Gunesch said.
Same At Phi Psi
Bill Holt, Phi Psi president, expres
sed similar feelings. "If there were
ever a fire on the first floor a lot of
guys might be killed," he said.
The University has not ignored the
problems of the fraternities and some
of the women's row houses. The most
luxurious student housing on campus
has been built to replace the old wood
en houses. These are the fraternity
clusters, two now completed around
Lake Lagunita, a third rapidly rising
on Campus drive, and a fourth plan
ned.

But the occupied old fraternities re
main. The eight women's row houses,
although owned by the University and
more closely supervised, have prob
lems, too.
For all the old residences, admits
Edward Scoles, assistant business
manager for University housing, "Fire
danger is one of the major problems.
They are all in bad shape."
First Frat Inspection
The first inspection of the old fra
ternities by the county fire marshal
was in 1957. As a result of that inves
tigation and other surveys undertaken
by the University, the decision to re
locate the fraternities in new cluster
housing was made.
Scoles noted that some of the fra
ternity buildings at that time were re
garded as having "minus years life."
Although the twenty year cluster
program was undertaken to remove
the fraternities from potentially un
safe quarters, apparently the Univer
sity did not feel 'iny clear and present
danger, for the earliest occupants of
the cluster program were chosen on
the basis of finance rather than build
ing deterioration.
'The Theta Delts moved into cluster
number one, although their house was
in good shape," said Scoles.
The state fire code was extremely
permissive until 1963. It was strength
ened in 1965. The tough inspections of
1967 are among the first under the
new code.
Scoles believes the typhoid scare at
Beta House last spring "focused atten
tion on all housing regulations. Coun

ty and state officials got alarmed over
typhoid. The fire marshal has put on
a more intense campaign than in pre
vious years."
Fire Marshal Bruce Wiggins agreed
the campaign is more intense, but
says it is mere coincidence. A lack of
manpower in former years prevented
rigorous investigation.
Will Meet All Frats
Wiggins has met with or plans to
meet with, each of the sixteen fra
ternities before the end of November,
to discuss the specific items that need
to be completed for each house.
Already, after only seven meetings,
Wiggins is pleased. "We have found
marked progress on our return in
spection tours," he said.
Many of the houses have similar
troubles, but they have been getting
cooperation from the fire department
in fixing them.
'The fire people were quite con
cerned about the situation here last
year," said Allen Ruby, Phi Psi resi
dent assistant. "But over the summer
several thousand dollars of capital im
provements were put into the house,
and as a result many possible fire
hazards were eliminated."
"We realize there is a fire hazard,
since this is one of the older houses
on campus," president Bill Holt said.
"We make sure that everyone knows
every exit, and knows it well. We
don't have fire drills, although we've
thought about it."
"We try not to use extension cords,"
he noted. "We also use very low amp

fuses. We do blow a lot of fuses,
because the wiring is overloaded.
We use low fuses to blow the
wiring and not the house."
"The fire department has re
ally laid down the law this year,"
Holt explained. All inside doors
have been replaced with solid
wood doors, which have a much
longer burning time. He said the
house had taken action on about
half of the fire marshal's list so
far, and is currently working
on the rest.
"Basically, they've let the
houses be below standards be
cause everyone knew that they
couldn't meet state standards,"
said Holt. He was glad to see
the fire marshal take a more
active interest in the fraternities
to relieve some of the dangers.
Beta Chi was less willing to
talk about their dealings with
the fire department than some
other fraternities. Mel Ellis, fra
ternity president, claimed that
"Beta Chi is in no worse condi
tion than the row houses."
The fire department called for
several improvements at the
Beta Chi house, however. These
included enclosing open stair
wells and extending one fire es
cape, which ends about seven
feet from the ground.
Quick-Set Latches
Also, the fraternity must re
place quick-set latches which
are on the doors to the bed
rooms. These violate the fire
code because special manipula
tion of the handle is required to
open them.
"The fire marshal came up to
the house last Wednesday, and
told us we did not have to make
expensive repairs," Ellis said.
He was upset with a September
16th inspection of the house
which precipitated a four page

set of correction orders from the
fire marshal. Ellis termed many
of the recommendations "pica
yune."
More than three quarters of
the recommendations had now
been carried out. "We're not
interested in taking risks with
health and fire dangers," he said.
Phi Sigma Kappa seems to
have more troubles than most,
which is to be expected, consider
ing their house was originally
a barn. But they don't let this
faze them.
Not A Deathtrap
Bruce Black, Phi Sig presi
dent said, "Our house is not a
deathtrap, but we know it's not
entirely safe, and that makes it
kind of exciting living here."
"We've never had a fire drill,"
he noted, but emphasized that
the house tries to make sure
that everyone is familiar with all
of the ways out of the house.
"We might lose the house in a
bad fire, but there are plenty of
ways of getting out," Black said.
The Phi Sig house has two fire
escapes, one of the ladder type,
the other with a platform and
ladder.
The officers of the fraternity
met with Fire Marshal Wiggins
last Thursday.
"He was fairly pleased with
what we'd done since they in
spected the house September 23,"
Black said, although many im
provements still have to be
made.
Rewiring Still Needed
The main work still to be
done is in rewiring. This basic
ally consists of getting more out
lets in the rooms, rather than
using extension cords.
"The fire department has nev
er been very happy, but every
one knows that we're going to
move sooner or later. Mayfield

Avenue is scheduled to corm
through our living room," saic
Black. The Fire Department
sent the Phi Sigs a four page
letter listing deficiencies early
in October.
The fire department asked
that exit signs be displayed, and
demanded that the stairwell be
sealed off at the top and bottom.
The Cornell University fire ear
lier this year resulted in several
deaths due to poisonous smoke
traveling through an open stair
well.
This remains to be done, al
though it has already been con
tracted for, and Black expects
it to be completed by the end of
the week. Another major change
is building a new fire escape
over the kitchen, from the sec
ond floor. The present one is
merely an old wooden ladder.
Much Already Completed
Phi Sig has already complied
with many of the fire depart
ment's requests, including par
titioning off the attic, fixing
broken plaster to prevent the
spread of fire through walls, and
putting up two heavy wooden
doors to replace old, more easily
ignited ones.
Over at Jordan House, a
women's residence, the main
trouble seems to be with the
fire department, rather than
with the house.
Ann Grekel, a Jordan resident,
related an incident that occurred
two years ago. On two consecu
tive Tuesdays, someone broke
into the house at 3:30 a.m. and
set off the fire alarm.
The first time this happened,
the firemen took over half
an hour to arrive. They didn't
seem to know where Jordan
House was, and got confused
with Jordan Hall and Jordan
Quad.
The firemen have been at Jor
dan two other times recently.
Once was because of a short
circuit, and the other was caused
by a gas leak.
Several Blown Fuses
There were several blown
fuses in the house last year.
Miss Grekel said, "You learn
not to use extension cords, and
that you can't put a coffee pot
and a light on the same outlet."
Jordan House is equipped with
fire escapes, of the crank-down
ladder type. There is one at
each end of the second floors. "I
assume they're not rusty," Gre
kel said, adding that she had nev
er known any student to actually
test one. There is ivy partially
growing over one of the ladders,
she added.
Miss Grekel also noted that
fire drills are somewhat strange.
"You run down the stairs and
meet in the front hall," she said,
"because the only convenient
exit is at the front of the house."
Meanwhile, Fire Marshal Wig
gins is trying to make it as easy
as possible for the residents of
these unsafe houses.
"We're here to help people,"
emphasized Wiggins. "We don't
want one penny more spent on
changes than has to be."
Life Most Important
He noted, 'The primary em
phasis of the code is placed on
saving life, not property damage.
Enclosed stairwells are the most
important single feature."
Dan Williams, assistant dean
of students for fraternities, ex
plained there are three main
problems with fraternities: in
terior stairwells are not en
closed, fire escapes do not meet
the required sixty degree slope,
and wiring is faulty.
"All but one or two of the old
houses fails to meet all three
criteria," he said.
Robert Summers, university
fraternity manager, said, "The
University is not neutral. Either

the University owns the houses
or the land. So we're very inter
ested in seeing that the law is
complied with." *
Fiscal Problems
"There are definite money
problems," said Scoles, assistant
business manager for housing.
The University has granted
loans to four fraternities to
make repairs and replacements.
"We haven't turned down any
loan requests yet," he said.
Apparently no house will be
required to do extensive rewir
ing. This would have been the
single most expensive item that
a house would have to do, ex
plained Scoles.
Williams explained the maxi
mum expenditure on a single
house would be $800. "Those
moving into clusters won't have
to spend as much money," he
added, because the fire marshal
only requires that progress is
being made, not that all pro
posed corrections be undertaken
immediately.
Pleased With Response
Williams said, "I've been ex
tremely pleased with the re
sponse of the fraternities. No
body's had to be convinced that
the issue is serious."
Fire Marshal Wiggins pointed
out that fraternities are not be
ing singled out for study. The
fraternities are being studied as
part of an overall study of fire
potential in University groups.
Fire safety procedures, in
cluding fire drills, in the row
houses have recently come un
der the scrutiny of a group of
University officers. Assistant
Dean of Students Sally Mahoney
noted that fire safety is largely
just making sure that people
have correct information.
Fire Alarm Operation
"For example, in all Univer
sity owned residences except the
Row, the fire alarm triggers a
device at the fire department.
In the eight Row houses, the fire
alarm is internal. One must call
the fire department on the tele
phone or use the fire alarm box
on the street," she said.

She feels that a rational dis
cussion of fire hazards in a spe
cific residence would be more
useful than a pre-announced
night-time fire drill. "The prob
lems are different in Storey than
in Jordan House, or in Stern
Hall."
Carlee Mack, director of the
row houses, commented on fire
drills that "what we were doing
in the past is quite inadequate."
"We had talks about fire pre
vention last year. We talked
about revising the fire drills last
year," she said. "I rather doubt
if everyone running to the end
of the hall with their coat and
shoes on would be adequate in a
real fire."
And sometimes the real fire
happens. On April 25, 1966,
faulty wiring in the wooden Phi

Kappa Sigma house on Mayfield
Avenue started a fire that gutted
the attic and third floor.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books and oth
er belongings out the windows.
Fire extinguishers were broken
out but most malfunctioned.
Twenty-two Stanford firemen
fought the blaze and prevented
total destruction of the house.
Before they had the fire under
control, student firemen had to
enter the burning building where
several had their clothing
burned by the surrounding
flames.
Fire chief John Marston said
then he was "thankful there
wasn't much wind. If there had
been, the fire could easily have
spread to other buildings."
Stanford escaped that fire with

no loss of life and $50,000 prop
erty damage. No one knows if
we'll be so lucky next time a
wire burns out on the Row.


The Phi Psi house pictured here is one of the oldest on campus;
it has an estimated burning time of ten minutes. The fire escape
seen here is one of a number of fire hazards at the house due to
its vertical rather than 60 degree tilt.

Not one of the more recently erected campus residences, Jordan has its share of death traps. Seen
here is an erstwhile fire escape almost completely blocked by indigenous shrubbery.
While fraternity cluster number
three rises behind Wilbur Hall, and
cluster number four looms nebulously
in the future, the residents of many of
the houses which the clusters will re

place wait nervously in buildings
which are little more than fire traps.
Stanford's aged fraternity houses
— some as old as the University —
find it hard to meet the fire prevention
standards of the 20th century.
Phi Sigma Kappa's main worry is

people throwing cigarettes on the
floor, according to fraternity president
Bruce Black. If anything larger than
a wastepaper basket catches fire, he
fears "the whole house will go."
Phi Kappa Psi spent $28,000 on reno
vations over the summer and cleared
up their two main fire hazards, the
kitchen and the attic, but if any good
sized portion of the house starts burn
ing, residents say nothing will prevent
the rest from burning, too.
Seventeen members of homeless
Alpha Sigma Phi are living in Man
zanita House, which has an estimated
total burning time of six minutes, ac
cording to the fire department.
Meanwhile, the future of these
houses is uncertain. Phi Sig's move
into a cluster is "several years away"
at best, according to Black.
And Phi Psi's house manager said
that estimates on when his fraternity
would move range from eight to 20
years.
Increased County Pressure
Meanwhile, the fraternities and Uni
versity-owned row houses are being
subjected to increased pressure from
the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea
sures are all that can be accomplished,
because the structures are in such
poor condition that steps which would
save property in a fire are no longer
feasible undertakings.
Health And Safety
At the Phi Sig house, the improve
ments were made "only for the pur
poses of health and safety," president
Black said.
The changes are only so that every
one can get out of the place if it does
catch fire. A lot of property would be
lost, he noted, "but there is nothing
that can be done about that," because
the building is so old.
The 60 or 70 year-old former bam
"is crumbling already," Black remark
ed. But despite the difficulties, the fra
ternity has already had much work
done to remove some of the hazards,
and more is planned.
Still, if the house caught fire, "it
would be an all or nothing proposi
tion," as Phi Sig Doug Gunesch said.
Same At Phi Psi
Bill Holt, Phi Psi president, expres
sed similar feelings. "If there were
ever a fire on the first floor a lot of
guys might be killed," he said.
The University has not ignored the
problems of the fraternities and some
of the women's row houses. The most
luxurious student housing on campus
has been built to replace the old wood
en houses. These are the fraternity
clusters, two now completed around
Lake Lagunita, a third rapidly rising
on Campus drive, and a fourth plan
ned.

But the occupied old fraternities re
main. The eight women's row houses,
although owned by the University and
more closely supervised, have prob
lems, too.
For all the old residences, admits
Edward Scoles, assistant business
manager for University housing, "Fire
danger is one of the major problems.
They are all in bad shape."
First Frat Inspection
The first inspection of the old fra
ternities by the county fire marshal
was in 1957. As a result of that inves
tigation and other surveys undertaken
by the University, the decision to re
locate the fraternities in new cluster
housing was made.
Scoles noted that some of the fra
ternity buildings at that time were re
garded as having "minus years life."
Although the twenty year cluster
program was undertaken to remove
the fraternities from potentially un
safe quarters, apparently the Univer
sity did not feel 'iny clear and present
danger, for the earliest occupants of
the cluster program were chosen on
the basis of finance rather than build
ing deterioration.
'The Theta Delts moved into cluster
number one, although their house was
in good shape," said Scoles.
The state fire code was extremely
permissive until 1963. It was strength
ened in 1965. The tough inspections of
1967 are among the first under the
new code.
Scoles believes the typhoid scare at
Beta House last spring "focused atten
tion on all housing regulations. Coun

ty and state officials got alarmed over
typhoid. The fire marshal has put on
a more intense campaign than in pre
vious years."
Fire Marshal Bruce Wiggins agreed
the campaign is more intense, but
says it is mere coincidence. A lack of
manpower in former years prevented
rigorous investigation.

the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea
sures are all that can be accomplished,
because the structures are in such
poor condition that steps which would
save property in a fire are no longer
feasible undertakings.
Health And Safety
At the Phi Sig house, the improve
ments were made "only for the pur
poses of health and safety," president
Black said.
The changes are only so that every
one can get out of the place if it does
catch fire. A lot of property would be
lost, he noted, "but there is nothing
that can be done about that," because
the building is so old.
The 60 or 70 year-old former bam
"is crumbling already," Black remark
ed. But despite the difficulties, the fra
ternity has already had much work
done to remove some of the hazards,
and more is planned.
Still, if the house caught fire, "it
would be an all or nothing proposi
tion," as Phi Sig Doug Gunesch said.
Same At Phi Psi
Bill Holt, Phi Psi president, expres
sed similar feelings. "If there were
ever a fire on the first floor a lot of
guys might be killed," he said.
The University has not ignored the
problems of the fraternities and some
of the women's row houses. The most
luxurious student housing on campus
has been built to replace the old wood
en houses. These are the fraternity
clusters, two now completed around
Lake Lagunita, a third rapidly rising
on Campus drive, and a fourth plan
ned.

But the occupied old fraternities re
main. The eight women's row houses,
although owned by the University and
more closely supervised, have prob
lems, too.
For all the old residences, admits
Edward Scoles, assistant business
manager for University housing, "Fire
danger is one of the major problems.
They are all in bad shape."
First Frat Inspection
The first inspection of the old fra
ternities by the county fire marshal
was in 1957. As a result of that inves
tigation and other surveys undertaken
by the University, the decision to re
locate the fraternities in new cluster
housing was made.
Scoles noted that some of the fra
ternity buildings at that time were re
garded as having "minus years life."
Although the twenty year cluster
program was undertaken to remove
the fraternities from potentially un
safe quarters, apparently the Univer
sity did not feel 'iny clear and present
danger, for the earliest occupants of
the cluster program were chosen on
the basis of finance rather than build
ing deterioration.
'The Theta Delts moved into cluster
number one, although their house was
in good shape," said Scoles.
The state fire code was extremely
permissive until 1963. It was strength
ened in 1965. The tough inspections of
1967 are among the first under the
new code.
Scoles believes the typhoid scare at
Beta House last spring "focused atten
tion on all housing regulations. Coun

ty and state officials got alarmed over
typhoid. The fire marshal has put on
a more intense campaign than in pre
vious years."
Fire Marshal Bruce Wiggins agreed
the campaign is more intense, but
says it is mere coincidence. A lack of
manpower in former years prevented
rigorous investigation.
Will Meet All Frats
Wiggins has met with or plans to
meet with, each of the sixteen fra
ternities before the end of November,
to discuss the specific items that need
to be completed for each house.
Already, after only seven meetings,
Wiggins is pleased. "We have found
marked progress on our return in
spection tours," he said.
Many of the houses have similar
troubles, but they have been getting
cooperation from the fire department
in fixing them.
'The fire people were quite con
cerned about the situation here last
year," said Allen Ruby, Phi Psi resi
dent assistant. "But over the summer
several thousand dollars of capital im
provements were put into the house,
and as a result many possible fire
hazards were eliminated."
"We realize there is a fire hazard,
since this is one of the older houses
on campus," president Bill Holt said.
"We make sure that everyone knows
every exit, and knows it well. We
don't have fire drills, although we've
thought about it."
"We try not to use extension cords,"
he noted. "We also use very low amp

dryer.
fuses. We do blow a lot of fuses,
because the wiring is overloaded.
We use low fuses to blow the
wiring and not the house."
"The fire department has re
ally laid down the law this year,"
Holt explained. All inside doors
have been replaced with solid
wood doors, which have a much
longer burning time. He said the
house had taken action on about
half of the fire marshal's list so
far, and is currently working
on the rest.
"Basically, they've let the
houses be below standards be
cause everyone knew that they
couldn't meet state standards,"
said Holt. He was glad to see
the fire marshal take a more
active interest in the fraternities
to relieve some of the dangers.
Beta Chi was less willing to
talk about their dealings with
the fire department than some
other fraternities. Mel Ellis, fra
ternity president, claimed that
"Beta Chi is in no worse condi
tion than the row houses."
The fire department called for
several improvements at the
Beta Chi house, however. These
included enclosing open stair
wells and extending one fire es
cape, which ends about seven
feet from the ground.
Quick-Set Latches
Also, the fraternity must re
place quick-set latches which
are on the doors to the bed
rooms. These violate the fire
code because special manipula
tion of the handle is required to
open them.
"The fire marshal came up to
the house last Wednesday, and
told us we did not have to make
expensive repairs," Ellis said.
He was upset with a September
16th inspection of the house
which precipitated a four page

set of correction orders from the
fire marshal. Ellis termed many
of the recommendations "pica
yune."
More than three quarters of
the recommendations had now
been carried out. "We're not
interested in taking risks with
health and fire dangers," he said.
Phi Sigma Kappa seems to
have more troubles than most,
which is to be expected, consider
ing their house was originally
a barn. But they don't let this
faze them.
Not A Deathtrap
Bruce Black, Phi Sig presi
dent said, "Our house is not a
deathtrap, but we know it's not
entirely safe, and that makes it
kind of exciting living here."
"We've never had a fire drill,"
he noted, but emphasized that
the house tries to make sure
that everyone is familiar with all
of the ways out of the house.
"We might lose the house in a
bad fire, but there are plenty of
ways of getting out," Black said.
The Phi Sig house has two fire
escapes, one of the ladder type,
the other with a platform and
ladder.
The officers of the fraternity
met with Fire Marshal Wiggins
last Thursday.
"He was fairly pleased with
what we'd done since they in
spected the house September 23,"
Black said, although many im
provements still have to be
made.
Rewiring Still Needed
The main work still to be
done is in rewiring. This basic
ally consists of getting more out
lets in the rooms, rather than
using extension cords.
"The fire department has nev
er been very happy, but every
one knows that we're going to
move sooner or later. Mayfield

Avenue is scheduled to corm
through our living room," saic
Black. The Fire Department
sent the Phi Sigs a four page
letter listing deficiencies early
in October.
The fire department asked
that exit signs be displayed, and
demanded that the stairwell be
sealed off at the top and bottom.
The Cornell University fire ear
lier this year resulted in several
deaths due to poisonous smoke
traveling through an open stair
well.
This remains to be done, al
though it has already been con
tracted for, and Black expects
it to be completed by the end of
the week. Another major change
is building a new fire escape
over the kitchen, from the sec
ond floor. The present one is
merely an old wooden ladder.
Much Already Completed
Phi Sig has already complied
with many of the fire depart
ment's requests, including par
titioning off the attic, fixing
broken plaster to prevent the
spread of fire through walls, and
putting up two heavy wooden
doors to replace old, more easily
ignited ones.
Over at Jordan House, a
women's residence, the main
trouble seems to be with the
fire department, rather than
with the house.
Ann Grekel, a Jordan resident,
related an incident that occurred
two years ago. On two consecu
tive Tuesdays, someone broke
into the house at 3:30 a.m. and
set off the fire alarm.
The first time this happened,
the firemen took over half
an hour to arrive. They didn't
seem to know where Jordan
House was, and got confused
with Jordan Hall and Jordan
Quad.
The firemen have been at Jor
dan two other times recently.
Once was because of a short
circuit, and the other was caused
by a gas leak.
Several Blown Fuses
There were several blown
fuses in the house last year.
Miss Grekel said, "You learn
not to use extension cords, and
that you can't put a coffee pot
and a light on the same outlet."
Jordan House is equipped with
fire escapes, of the crank-down
ladder type. There is one at
each end of the second floors. "I
assume they're not rusty," Gre
kel said, adding that she had nev
er known any student to actually
test one. There is ivy partially
growing over one of the ladders,
she added.
Miss Grekel also noted that
fire drills are somewhat strange.
"You run down the stairs and
meet in the front hall," she said,
"because the only convenient
exit is at the front of the house."
Meanwhile, Fire Marshal Wig
gins is trying to make it as easy
as possible for the residents of
these unsafe houses.
"We're here to help people,"
emphasized Wiggins. "We don't
want one penny more spent on
changes than has to be."
Life Most Important
He noted, 'The primary em
phasis of the code is placed on
saving life, not property damage.
Enclosed stairwells are the most
important single feature."
Dan Williams, assistant dean
of students for fraternities, ex
plained there are three main
problems with fraternities: in
terior stairwells are not en
closed, fire escapes do not meet
the required sixty degree slope,
and wiring is faulty.
"All but one or two of the old
houses fails to meet all three
criteria," he said.
Robert Summers, university
fraternity manager, said, "The
University is not neutral. Either

the University owns the houses
or the land. So we're very inter
ested in seeing that the law is
complied with." *
Fiscal Problems
"There are definite money
problems," said Scoles, assistant
business manager for housing.
The University has granted
loans to four fraternities to
make repairs and replacements.
"We haven't turned down any
loan requests yet," he said.
Apparently no house will be
required to do extensive rewir
ing. This would have been the
single most expensive item that
a house would have to do, ex
plained Scoles.
Williams explained the maxi
mum expenditure on a single
house would be $800. "Those
moving into clusters won't have
to spend as much money," he
added, because the fire marshal
only requires that progress is
being made, not that all pro
posed corrections be undertaken
immediately.
Pleased With Response
Williams said, "I've been ex
tremely pleased with the re
sponse of the fraternities. No
body's had to be convinced that
the issue is serious."
Fire Marshal Wiggins pointed
out that fraternities are not be
ing singled out for study. The
fraternities are being studied as
part of an overall study of fire
potential in University groups.
Fire safety procedures, in
cluding fire drills, in the row
houses have recently come un
der the scrutiny of a group of
University officers. Assistant
Dean of Students Sally Mahoney
noted that fire safety is largely
just making sure that people
have correct information.
Fire Alarm Operation
"For example, in all Univer
sity owned residences except the
Row, the fire alarm triggers a
device at the fire department.
In the eight Row houses, the fire
alarm is internal. One must call
the fire department on the tele
phone or use the fire alarm box
on the street," she said.

She feels that a rational dis
cussion of fire hazards in a spe
cific residence would be more
useful than a pre-announced
night-time fire drill. "The prob
lems are different in Storey than
in Jordan House, or in Stern
Hall."
Carlee Mack, director of the
row houses, commented on fire
drills that "what we were doing
in the past is quite inadequate."
"We had talks about fire pre
vention last year. We talked
about revising the fire drills last
year," she said. "I rather doubt
if everyone running to the end
of the hall with their coat and
shoes on would be adequate in a
real fire."
And sometimes the real fire
happens. On April 25, 1966,
faulty wiring in the wooden Phi

Kappa Sigma house on Mayfield
Avenue started a fire that gutted
the attic and third floor.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books and oth
er belongings out the windows.
Fire extinguishers were broken
out but most malfunctioned.
Twenty-two Stanford firemen
fought the blaze and prevented
total destruction of the house.
Before they had the fire under
control, student firemen had to
enter the burning building where
several had their clothing
burned by the surrounding
flames.
Fire chief John Marston said
then he was "thankful there
wasn't much wind. If there had
been, the fire could easily have
spread to other buildings."
Stanford escaped that fire with

no loss of life and $50,000 prop
erty damage. No one knows if
we'll be so lucky next time a
wire burns out on the Row.


The Phi Psi house pictured here is one of the oldest on campus;
it has an estimated burning time of ten minutes. The fire escape
seen here is one of a number of fire hazards at the house due to
its vertical rather than 60 degree tilt.

Not one of the more recently erected campus residences, Jordan has its share of death traps. Seen
here is an erstwhile fire escape almost completely blocked by indigenous shrubbery.
While fraternity cluster number
three rises behind Wilbur Hall, and
cluster number four looms nebulously
in the future, the residents of many of
the houses which the clusters will re

place wait nervously in buildings
which are little more than fire traps.
Stanford's aged fraternity houses
— some as old as the University —
find it hard to meet the fire prevention
standards of the 20th century.
Phi Sigma Kappa's main worry is

people throwing cigarettes on the
floor, according to fraternity president
Bruce Black. If anything larger than
a wastepaper basket catches fire, he
fears "the whole house will go."
Phi Kappa Psi spent $28,000 on reno
vations over the summer and cleared
up their two main fire hazards, the
kitchen and the attic, but if any good
sized portion of the house starts burn
ing, residents say nothing will prevent
the rest from burning, too.
Seventeen members of homeless
Alpha Sigma Phi are living in Man
zanita House, which has an estimated
total burning time of six minutes, ac
cording to the fire department.
Meanwhile, the future of these
houses is uncertain. Phi Sig's move
into a cluster is "several years away"
at best, according to Black.
And Phi Psi's house manager said
that estimates on when his fraternity
would move range from eight to 20
years.
Increased County Pressure
Meanwhile, the fraternities and Uni
versity-owned row houses are being
subjected to increased pressure from
the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea

then he was "thankful there
wasn't much wind. If there had
been, the fire could easily have

Stanford escaped that fire with

erty damage. No one knows if
we'll be so lucky next time a
wire burns out on the Row.

While fraternity cluster number
three rises behind Wilbur Hall, and
cluster number four looms nebulously
in the future, the residents of many of
the houses which the clusters will re

place wait nervously in buildings
which are little more than fire traps.
Stanford's aged fraternity houses
— some as old as the University —
find it hard to meet the fire prevention
standards of the 20th century.
Phi Sigma Kappa's main worry is

people throwing cigarettes on the
floor, according to fraternity president
Bruce Black. If anything larger than
a wastepaper basket catches fire, he
fears "the whole house will go."
Phi Kappa Psi spent $28,000 on reno
vations over the summer and cleared
up their two main fire hazards, the
kitchen and the attic, but if any good
sized portion of the house starts burn
ing, residents say nothing will prevent
the rest from burning, too.
Seventeen members of homeless
Alpha Sigma Phi are living in Man
zanita House, which has an estimated
total burning time of six minutes, ac
cording to the fire department.
Meanwhile, the future of these
houses is uncertain. Phi Sig's move
into a cluster is "several years away"
at best, according to Black.
And Phi Psi's house manager said
that estimates on when his fraternity
would move range from eight to 20
years.
Increased County Pressure
Meanwhile, the fraternities and Uni
versity-owned row houses are being
subjected to increased pressure from
the County Fire Marshal to modernize
buildings to meet provisions of the
California fire code.
The University is cooperating with
Santa Clara County fire marshal Bruce
Wiggins and the sixteen fraternities
not yet located in clusters in an at
tempt to reduce the potential for loss
of life due to fire.
But the fire code Is principally a
life-safing system, designed to protect
people, not property.

An in many cases, life-saving mea
sures are all that can be accomplished,
because the structures are in such
poor condition that steps which would
save property in a fire are no longer
feasible undertakings.
Health And Safety
At the Phi Sig house, the improve
ments were made "only for the pur
poses of health and safety," president
Black said.
The changes are only so that every
one can get out of the place if it does
catch fire. A lot of property would be
lost, he noted, "but there is nothing
that can be done about that," because
the building is so old.
The 60 or 70 year-old former bam
"is crumbling already," Black remark
ed. But despite the difficulties, the fra
ternity has already had much work
done to remove some of the hazards,
and more is planned.
Still, if the house caught fire, "it
would be an all or nothing proposi
tion," as Phi Sig Doug Gunesch said.
Same At Phi Psi
Bill Holt, Phi Psi president, expres
sed similar feelings. "If there were
ever a fire on the first floor a lot of
guys might be killed," he said.
The University has not ignored the
problems of the fraternities and some
of the women's row houses. The most
luxurious student housing on campus
has been built to replace the old wood
en houses. These are the fraternity
clusters, two now completed around
Lake Lagunita, a third rapidly rising
on Campus drive, and a fourth plan
ned.

But the occupied old fraternities re
main. The eight women's row houses,
although owned by the University and
more closely supervised, have prob
lems, too.
For all the old residences, admits
Edward Scoles, assistant business
manager for University housing, "Fire
danger is one of the major problems.
They are all in bad shape."
First Frat Inspection
The first inspection of the old fra
ternities by the county fire marshal
was in 1957. As a result of that inves
tigation and other surveys undertaken
by the University, the decision to re
locate the fraternities in new cluster
housing was made.
Scoles noted that some of the fra
ternity buildings at that time were re
garded as having "minus years life."
Although the twenty year cluster
program was undertaken to remove
the fraternities from potentially un
safe quarters, apparently the Univer
sity did not feel 'iny clear and present
danger, for the earliest occupants of
the cluster program were chosen on
the basis of finance rather than build
ing deterioration.
'The Theta Delts moved into cluster
number one, although their house was
in good shape," said Scoles.
The state fire code was extremely
permissive until 1963. It was strength
ened in 1965. The tough inspections of
1967 are among the first under the
new code.
Scoles believes the typhoid scare at
Beta House last spring "focused atten
tion on all housing regulations. Coun

ty and state officials got alarmed over
typhoid. The fire marshal has put on
a more intense campaign than in pre
vious years."
Fire Marshal Bruce Wiggins agreed
the campaign is more intense, but
says it is mere coincidence. A lack of
manpower in former years prevented
rigorous investigation.
Will Meet All Frats
Wiggins has met with or plans to
meet with, each of the sixteen fra
ternities before the end of November,
to discuss the specific items that need
to be completed for each house.
Already, after only seven meetings,
Wiggins is pleased. "We have found
marked progress on our return in
spection tours," he said.
Many of the houses have similar
troubles, but they have been getting
cooperation from the fire department
in fixing them.
'The fire people were quite con
cerned about the situation here last
year," said Allen Ruby, Phi Psi resi
dent assistant. "But over the summer
several thousand dollars of capital im
provements were put into the house,
and as a result many possible fire
hazards were eliminated."
"We realize there is a fire hazard,
since this is one of the older houses
on campus," president Bill Holt said.
"We make sure that everyone knows
every exit, and knows it well. We
don't have fire drills, although we've
thought about it."
"We try not to use extension cords,"
he noted. "We also use very low amp

fuses. We do blow a lot of fuses,
because the wiring is overloaded.
We use low fuses to blow the
wiring and not the house."
"The fire department has re
ally laid down the law this year,"
Holt explained. All inside doors
have been replaced with solid
wood doors, which have a much
longer burning time. He said the
house had taken action on about
half of the fire marshal's list so
far, and is currently working
on the rest.
"Basically, they've let the
houses be below standards be
cause everyone knew that they
couldn't meet state standards,"
said Holt. He was glad to see
the fire marshal take a more
active interest in the fraternities
to relieve some of the dangers.
Beta Chi was less willing to
talk about their dealings with
the fire department than some
other fraternities. Mel Ellis, fra
ternity president, claimed that
"Beta Chi is in no worse condi
tion than the row houses."
The fire department called for
several improvements at the
Beta Chi house, however. These
included enclosing open stair
wells and extending one fire es
cape, which ends about seven
feet from the ground.
Quick-Set Latches
Also, the fraternity must re
place quick-set latches which
are on the doors to the bed
rooms. These violate the fire
code because special manipula
tion of the handle is required to
open them.
"The fire marshal came up to
the house last Wednesday, and
told us we did not have to make
expensive repairs," Ellis said.
He was upset with a September
16th inspection of the house
which precipitated a four page

set of correction orders from the
fire marshal. Ellis termed many
of the recommendations "pica
yune."
More than three quarters of
the recommendations had now
been carried out. "We're not
interested in taking risks with
health and fire dangers," he said.
Phi Sigma Kappa seems to
have more troubles than most,
which is to be expected, consider
ing their house was originally
a barn. But they don't let this
faze them.
Not A Deathtrap
Bruce Black, Phi Sig presi
dent said, "Our house is not a
deathtrap, but we know it's not
entirely safe, and that makes it
kind of exciting living here."
"We've never had a fire drill,"
he noted, but emphasized that
the house tries to make sure
that everyone is familiar with all
of the ways out of the house.
"We might lose the house in a
bad fire, but there are plenty of
ways of getting out," Black said.
The Phi Sig house has two fire
escapes, one of the ladder type,
the other with a platform and
ladder.
The officers of the fraternity
met with Fire Marshal Wiggins
last Thursday.
"He was fairly pleased with
what we'd done since they in
spected the house September 23,"
Black said, although many im
provements still have to be
made.
Rewiring Still Needed
The main work still to be
done is in rewiring. This basic
ally consists of getting more out
lets in the rooms, rather than
using extension cords.
"The fire department has nev
er been very happy, but every
one knows that we're going to
move sooner or later. Mayfield

Avenue is scheduled to corm
through our living room," saic
Black. The Fire Department
sent the Phi Sigs a four page
letter listing deficiencies early
in October.
The fire department asked
that exit signs be displayed, and
demanded that the stairwell be
sealed off at the top and bottom.
The Cornell University fire ear
lier this year resulted in several
deaths due to poisonous smoke
traveling through an open stair
well.
This remains to be done, al
though it has already been con
tracted for, and Black expects
it to be completed by the end of
the week. Another major change
is building a new fire escape
over the kitchen, from the sec
ond floor. The present one is
merely an old wooden ladder.
Much Already Completed
Phi Sig has already complied
with many of the fire depart
ment's requests, including par
titioning off the attic, fixing
broken plaster to prevent the
spread of fire through walls, and
putting up two heavy wooden
doors to replace old, more easily
ignited ones.
Over at Jordan House, a
women's residence, the main
trouble seems to be with the
fire department, rather than
with the house.
Ann Grekel, a Jordan resident,
related an incident that occurred
two years ago. On two consecu
tive Tuesdays, someone broke
into the house at 3:30 a.m. and
set off the fire alarm.
The first time this happened,
the firemen took over half
an hour to arrive. They didn't
seem to know where Jordan
House was, and got confused
with Jordan Hall and Jordan
Quad.
The firemen have been at Jor
dan two other times recently.
Once was because of a short
circuit, and the other was caused
by a gas leak.
Several Blown Fuses
There were several blown
fuses in the house last year.
Miss Grekel said, "You learn
not to use extension cords, and
that you can't put a coffee pot
and a light on the same outlet."
Jordan House is equipped with
fire escapes, of the crank-down
ladder type. There is one at
each end of the second floors. "I
assume they're not rusty," Gre
kel said, adding that she had nev
er known any student to actually
test one. There is ivy partially
growing over one of the ladders,
she added.
Miss Grekel also noted that
fire drills are somewhat strange.
"You run down the stairs and
meet in the front hall," she said,
"because the only convenient
exit is at the front of the house."
Meanwhile, Fire Marshal Wig
gins is trying to make it as easy
as possible for the residents of
these unsafe houses.
"We're here to help people,"
emphasized Wiggins. "We don't
want one penny more spent on
changes than has to be."
Life Most Important
He noted, 'The primary em
phasis of the code is placed on
saving life, not property damage.
Enclosed stairwells are the most
important single feature."
Dan Williams, assistant dean
of students for fraternities, ex
plained there are three main
problems with fraternities: in
terior stairwells are not en
closed, fire escapes do not meet
the required sixty degree slope,
and wiring is faulty.
"All but one or two of the old
houses fails to meet all three
criteria," he said.
Robert Summers, university
fraternity manager, said, "The
University is not neutral. Either

the University owns the houses
or the land. So we're very inter
ested in seeing that the law is
complied with." *
Fiscal Problems
"There are definite money
problems," said Scoles, assistant
business manager for housing.
The University has granted
loans to four fraternities to
make repairs and replacements.
"We haven't turned down any
loan requests yet," he said.
Apparently no house will be
required to do extensive rewir
ing. This would have been the
single most expensive item that
a house would have to do, ex
plained Scoles.
Williams explained the maxi
mum expenditure on a single
house would be $800. "Those
moving into clusters won't have
to spend as much money," he
added, because the fire marshal
only requires that progress is
being made, not that all pro
posed corrections be undertaken
immediately.
Pleased With Response
Williams said, "I've been ex
tremely pleased with the re
sponse of the fraternities. No
body's had to be convinced that
the issue is serious."
Fire Marshal Wiggins pointed
out that fraternities are not be
ing singled out for study. The
fraternities are being studied as
part of an overall study of fire
potential in University groups.
Fire safety procedures, in
cluding fire drills, in the row
houses have recently come un
der the scrutiny of a group of
University officers. Assistant
Dean of Students Sally Mahoney
noted that fire safety is largely
just making sure that people
have correct information.
Fire Alarm Operation
"For example, in all Univer
sity owned residences except the
Row, the fire alarm triggers a
device at the fire department.
In the eight Row houses, the fire
alarm is internal. One must call
the fire department on the tele
phone or use the fire alarm box
on the street," she said.

She feels that a rational dis
cussion of fire hazards in a spe
cific residence would be more
useful than a pre-announced
night-time fire drill. "The prob
lems are different in Storey than
in Jordan House, or in Stern
Hall."
Carlee Mack, director of the
row houses, commented on fire
drills that "what we were doing
in the past is quite inadequate."
"We had talks about fire pre
vention last year. We talked
about revising the fire drills last
year," she said. "I rather doubt
if everyone running to the end
of the hall with their coat and
shoes on would be adequate in a
real fire."
And sometimes the real fire
happens. On April 25, 1966,
faulty wiring in the wooden Phi

Kappa Sigma house on Mayfield
Avenue started a fire that gutted
the attic and third floor.
Immediately, residents started
throwing clothes, books and oth
er belongings out the windows.
Fire extinguishers were broken
out but most malfunctioned.
Twenty-two Stanford firemen
fought the blaze and prevented
total destruction of the house.
Before they had the fire under
control, student firemen had to
enter the burning building where
several had their clothing
burned by the surrounding
flames.
Fire chief John Marston said
then he was "thankful there
wasn't much wind. If there had
been, the fire could easily have
spread to other buildings."
Stanford escaped that fire with

no loss of life and $50,000 prop
erty damage. No one knows if
we'll be so lucky next time a
wire burns out on the Row.
