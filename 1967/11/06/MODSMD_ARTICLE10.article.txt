# What's In A Grade?
## 
### 
Yale Univerity took a not-so-bold step late
last week to eliminate numerical grading.
If you line up the grading categories at Yale
and at Stanford, you find Yale with four: honors,
high pass, pass and fail; and Stanford with five:
A, B, C, D and F. That puts Yale one step ahead
of Stanford in the drive to eliminate grades.
It appears some committee got hold of a sim
ple proposal to eliminate grading at Yale and
proceeded to dilute it. Even Stanford's limited
pass-fail option is more liberal than the new
Yale plan.
But not much more liberal.
A strange ambiguity remains concerning the
status of Stanford grading. Last June the Univer
sity trustees voted to abolish class ranking, yet
all the vestiges remain. The Dean's List contin
ues to dispense rewards for good grades, and
departments can still rank their students by nu
merical grades.
Either Stanford has class ranking or it doesn't.
Without more significant changes, the action of
the trustees last June is merely a hoax.
Stanford can say it is not compiling class rank
ing, and it may even eliminate the Dean's List
and the right of the departments to compile de
partmental rankings, but until there are no four
or five easy classifications, there will continue to
be de facto class ranking.

Yale's plan does have some attractive aspects.
By making their divisions derivatives of the fa
miliar pass-fail evaluation, they create the im
pression that no compilation can be made. Stu
dents may rest a little easier and fewer gradu
ate schools will rely on a cold numerical evalua
tion of four years of personal growth.
The Yale plan also wall encourage closer at
tention to the individual student's work. As one
Stanford professor commended, the new regula
tions will encourage Yale professors to write
prose comments concerning the work of their
students.
As yet Stanford has neither of these advan
tages. The very opportunity to make an easy 0.0
to 4.0 calculation causes it to be made continual
ly. Furthermore, professors are not encouraged
or usually permitted to qualify the decisive eval
uations they must give their students an assign
ing a single grade for course work done.
A bold and extensive experiment must be un
dertaken to insure that the evaluations of work
done are meaningful to the student and an aid to
his further development.
We feel students will respond best to a system
that eliminates the pressures of numerical grad
ing. We believe students will work if confronted
by a challenging and relevant educational pro
gram.

ple proposal to eliminate grading at Yale and
proceeded to dilute it. Even Stanford's limited
pass-fail option is more liberal than the new
Yale plan.
But not much more liberal.
A strange ambiguity remains concerning the
status of Stanford grading. Last June the Univer
sity trustees voted to abolish class ranking, yet
all the vestiges remain. The Dean's List contin
ues to dispense rewards for good grades, and
departments can still rank their students by nu
merical grades.
Either Stanford has class ranking or it doesn't.
Without more significant changes, the action of
the trustees last June is merely a hoax.
Stanford can say it is not compiling class rank
ing, and it may even eliminate the Dean's List
and the right of the departments to compile de
partmental rankings, but until there are no four
or five easy classifications, there will continue to
be de facto class ranking.

Yale's plan does have some attractive aspects.
By making their divisions derivatives of the fa
miliar pass-fail evaluation, they create the im
pression that no compilation can be made. Stu
dents may rest a little easier and fewer gradu
ate schools will rely on a cold numerical evalua
tion of four years of personal growth.
The Yale plan also wall encourage closer at
tention to the individual student's work. As one
Stanford professor commended, the new regula
tions will encourage Yale professors to write
prose comments concerning the work of their
students.
As yet Stanford has neither of these advan
tages. The very opportunity to make an easy 0.0
to 4.0 calculation causes it to be made continual
ly. Furthermore, professors are not encouraged
or usually permitted to qualify the decisive eval
uations they must give their students an assign
ing a single grade for course work done.
A bold and extensive experiment must be un
dertaken to insure that the evaluations of work
done are meaningful to the student and an aid to
his further development.
We feel students will respond best to a system
that eliminates the pressures of numerical grad
ing. We believe students will work if confronted
by a challenging and relevant educational pro
gram.
Yale Univerity took a not-so-bold step late
last week to eliminate numerical grading.
If you line up the grading categories at Yale
and at Stanford, you find Yale with four: honors,
high pass, pass and fail; and Stanford with five:
A, B, C, D and F. That puts Yale one step ahead
of Stanford in the drive to eliminate grades.
It appears some committee got hold of a sim
ple proposal to eliminate grading at Yale and
proceeded to dilute it. Even Stanford's limited
pass-fail option is more liberal than the new
Yale plan.
