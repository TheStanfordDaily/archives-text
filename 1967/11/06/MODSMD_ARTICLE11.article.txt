# Decision-making
## Stanford Won't Rock Boat 
### DANIEL BERNSTEIN 
There is currently a great
amount of challenge of Stanford
education. A part of the Uni
versity which stands out as
needing change is the Adminis
tration. I spent last year work
ing with administrative officers
in trying to institute a minor
change in Army ROTC regula
tions. My efforts were greeted
with discouragement and har
assment. Here are my experi
ences and comments.
Robert Sears, Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences, was the
first member of the Administra
tion to learn of the question
posed. He was interested, friend
ly, and cooperative throughout
the course of my efforts. Once
out of the academic offices and
into pure administrative posi
tions, however, matters got
worse.
In all dealings there seemed
to be a great resentment toward
any pressure from a source out
side of the President's office.
Nothing had been accomplished
on my report to Sterling in over
four months, and I began to in
quire about any progress.
On two such occasions Fred
Glover chastized me in public
for being aggressive, for having
a chip on my shoulder, for pres
suring his office, and for intrud
ing in matters about which I
knew nothing. This rebuke was
most unpleasant since all prop
er procedures had been patient

ly followed and the President's
office had been so inactive.
Art Of The Possible
It was also often difficult to
get any positive statements of
position from representatives of
the administration. That which
was most often exercised was
caution. E. Howard Brooks ex
pressed a typical attitude by lec
turing me on politics—the art
of the possible. He admonished
me not to rock the boat and not
to make waves. One must stay
on good terms, for compromise
is eventual and negotiation is
very sensitive. The basis for all
his operations, he told me, was
keeping people pleased with
each other.
This philosophy was embodied
in action by Wallace Sterling in
his dealings with the Army. A
General proposed the possibility
of a plan for solution of the
problem. The plan involved each
student submitting a letter of
application through a series of
Army command groups until
Continental Army Command
gave its permission—for a Stan
ford course.
Sterling thought this was a
fine idea and was happy for
such Army flexibility. He was,
in fact, unwilling to ask for any
thing more independent. His ac
tions were designed not to up
set any members of the group
with which he was negotiating.
In all cases every effort was
made not to antagonize the
Army.
Mechanism For Change
To begin an evaluation of my
experience, I would look at the
mechanism for change within
the administration. It is recom
mended that one generally fol
low the procedures offered. It is,
however, extremely difficult to
do this, for the channels become
hopelessly clogged with people
discouraging any sudden change
or large measure of movement.
My case is but one excellent ex
ample of the reticence of the
positions of power to be flexible.

The obvious answer to my
criticism is to point to the Study
of Education at Stanford — a
two year panacea for all the
University's ills. The SES will
make the sweeping changes
needed to keep Stanford on the
brink of greatness.
I would make two points on
that argument. First, whatever
the changes suggested by the
SES, the implementation of
change will have to come from
the administrative officials.
Overly cautious action or fear
of disruption of current practice
will severely limit the effective
ness of any suggested modifica
tion.
Second, the SES will cease to
exist after two years. Is it then
the understanding that change
will stop until another study is
undertaken? Assuming change,
when desired, is a good part of
the University, the administra
tive officers will be instrumental
in affecting it It is essential
again that these officers not be
excessively attached to or de
pendent upon a status quo.
Shift Of Power
As I see it, the problem cen
ters around two basic items—
the decision making structure
and the guiding tactical philoso
phy. Many administrative offi
cers are not members of the aca
demic community proper, and
the only source of their position
is the power to make decisions
about various functions. When
a challenge is made which
wishes to shift this decision
power (particularly a shift of
power to students), it is likely
to be resisted.
A good deal of suggested re
form involves taking academic
decisions away from solely ad
ministrative officers and putting
it into the hands of students
and faculty. Thus the present
structure will likely inhibit the
mechanism of basic change. The
prevailing tactical philosophy of
the University's entire adminis
tration appears to have been
well summed up in Brooks' ad
monition not to rock the boat.
Being in a state of agreement

is seen as naturally preferable
to any discord among points of
view. Many individuals are less
concerned with the nature and
value of an agreement than
with the desire that there be no
disharmony. I do not feel that
the University is so fragile that
its public face has to be so ex
cessively coddled.
I have related my personal
dealings with some of the ad
ministrative processes and offi
cers of the University. Also, I
evaluated some of the implica
tions of these events. The open
ing of ROTC is a rather small
and unimportant event in the
University. The revealed mech
anism of the administration,
however, is something which
must be considered in great de
tail.

cers are not members of the aca
demic community proper, and
the only source of their position
is the power to make decisions
about various functions. When
a challenge is made which
wishes to shift this decision
power (particularly a shift of
power to students), it is likely
to be resisted.
A good deal of suggested re
form involves taking academic
decisions away from solely ad
ministrative officers and putting
it into the hands of students
and faculty. Thus the present
structure will likely inhibit the
mechanism of basic change. The
prevailing tactical philosophy of
the University's entire adminis
tration appears to have been
well summed up in Brooks' ad
monition not to rock the boat.
Being in a state of agreement

is seen as naturally preferable
to any discord among points of
view. Many individuals are less
concerned with the nature and
value of an agreement than
with the desire that there be no
disharmony. I do not feel that
the University is so fragile that
its public face has to be so ex
cessively coddled.
I have related my personal
dealings with some of the ad
ministrative processes and offi
cers of the University. Also, I
evaluated some of the implica
tions of these events. The open
ing of ROTC is a rather small
and unimportant event in the
University. The revealed mech
anism of the administration,
however, is something which
must be considered in great de
tail.
There is currently a great
amount of challenge of Stanford
education. A part of the Uni
versity which stands out as
needing change is the Adminis
tration. I spent last year work
ing with administrative officers
in trying to institute a minor
change in Army ROTC regula
tions. My efforts were greeted
with discouragement and har
assment. Here are my experi
ences and comments.
Robert Sears, Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences, was the
first member of the Administra
tion to learn of the question
posed. He was interested, friend
ly, and cooperative throughout
the course of my efforts. Once
out of the academic offices and
into pure administrative posi
tions, however, matters got
worse.
In all dealings there seemed
to be a great resentment toward
any pressure from a source out
side of the President's office.
Nothing had been accomplished
on my report to Sterling in over
four months, and I began to in
quire about any progress.
On two such occasions Fred
Glover chastized me in public
for being aggressive, for having
a chip on my shoulder, for pres
suring his office, and for intrud
ing in matters about which I
knew nothing. This rebuke was
most unpleasant since all prop
er procedures had been patient

ly followed and the President's
office had been so inactive.
Art Of The Possible
It was also often difficult to
get any positive statements of
position from representatives of
the administration. That which
was most often exercised was
caution. E. Howard Brooks ex
pressed a typical attitude by lec
turing me on politics—the art
of the possible. He admonished
me not to rock the boat and not
to make waves. One must stay
on good terms, for compromise
is eventual and negotiation is
very sensitive. The basis for all
his operations, he told me, was
keeping people pleased with
each other.
This philosophy was embodied
in action by Wallace Sterling in
his dealings with the Army. A
General proposed the possibility
of a plan for solution of the
problem. The plan involved each
student submitting a letter of
application through a series of
Army command groups until
Continental Army Command
gave its permission—for a Stan
ford course.
Sterling thought this was a
fine idea and was happy for
such Army flexibility. He was,
in fact, unwilling to ask for any
thing more independent. His ac
tions were designed not to up
set any members of the group
with which he was negotiating.
In all cases every effort was
made not to antagonize the
Army.
Mechanism For Change
To begin an evaluation of my
experience, I would look at the
mechanism for change within
the administration. It is recom
mended that one generally fol
low the procedures offered. It is,
however, extremely difficult to
do this, for the channels become
hopelessly clogged with people
discouraging any sudden change
or large measure of movement.
My case is but one excellent ex
ample of the reticence of the
positions of power to be flexible.

The obvious answer to my
criticism is to point to the Study
of Education at Stanford — a
two year panacea for all the
University's ills. The SES will
make the sweeping changes
needed to keep Stanford on the
brink of greatness.
I would make two points on
that argument. First, whatever
the changes suggested by the
SES, the implementation of
change will have to come from
the administrative officials.
Overly cautious action or fear
of disruption of current practice
will severely limit the effective
ness of any suggested modifica
tion.
Second, the SES will cease to
exist after two years. Is it then
the understanding that change
will stop until another study is
undertaken? Assuming change,
when desired, is a good part of
the University, the administra
tive officers will be instrumental
in affecting it It is essential
again that these officers not be
excessively attached to or de
pendent upon a status quo.

mended that one generally fol
low the procedures offered. It is,
however, extremely difficult to
do this, for the channels become
hopelessly clogged with people
discouraging any sudden change
or large measure of movement.
My case is but one excellent ex
ample of the reticence of the
positions of power to be flexible.

The obvious answer to my
criticism is to point to the Study
of Education at Stanford — a
two year panacea for all the
University's ills. The SES will
make the sweeping changes
needed to keep Stanford on the
brink of greatness.
I would make two points on
that argument. First, whatever
the changes suggested by the
SES, the implementation of
change will have to come from
the administrative officials.
Overly cautious action or fear
of disruption of current practice
will severely limit the effective
ness of any suggested modifica
tion.
Second, the SES will cease to
exist after two years. Is it then
the understanding that change
will stop until another study is
undertaken? Assuming change,
when desired, is a good part of
the University, the administra
tive officers will be instrumental
in affecting it It is essential
again that these officers not be
excessively attached to or de
pendent upon a status quo.
Shift Of Power
As I see it, the problem cen
ters around two basic items—
the decision making structure
and the guiding tactical philoso
phy. Many administrative offi
cers are not members of the aca
demic community proper, and
the only source of their position
is the power to make decisions
about various functions. When
a challenge is made which
wishes to shift this decision
power (particularly a shift of
power to students), it is likely
to be resisted.
A good deal of suggested re
form involves taking academic
decisions away from solely ad
ministrative officers and putting
it into the hands of students
and faculty. Thus the present
structure will likely inhibit the
mechanism of basic change. The
prevailing tactical philosophy of
the University's entire adminis
tration appears to have been
well summed up in Brooks' ad
monition not to rock the boat.
Being in a state of agreement

is seen as naturally preferable
to any discord among points of
view. Many individuals are less
concerned with the nature and
value of an agreement than
with the desire that there be no
disharmony. I do not feel that
the University is so fragile that
its public face has to be so ex
cessively coddled.
I have related my personal
dealings with some of the ad
ministrative processes and offi
cers of the University. Also, I
evaluated some of the implica
tions of these events. The open
ing of ROTC is a rather small
and unimportant event in the
University. The revealed mech
anism of the administration,
however, is something which
must be considered in great de
tail.
There is currently a great
amount of challenge of Stanford
education. A part of the Uni
versity which stands out as
needing change is the Adminis
tration. I spent last year work
ing with administrative officers
in trying to institute a minor
change in Army ROTC regula
tions. My efforts were greeted
with discouragement and har
assment. Here are my experi
ences and comments.
Robert Sears, Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences, was the
first member of the Administra
tion to learn of the question
posed. He was interested, friend
ly, and cooperative throughout
the course of my efforts. Once
out of the academic offices and
into pure administrative posi
tions, however, matters got
worse.
In all dealings there seemed
to be a great resentment toward
any pressure from a source out
side of the President's office.
Nothing had been accomplished
on my report to Sterling in over
four months, and I began to in
quire about any progress.
On two such occasions Fred
Glover chastized me in public
for being aggressive, for having
a chip on my shoulder, for pres
suring his office, and for intrud
ing in matters about which I
knew nothing. This rebuke was
most unpleasant since all prop
er procedures had been patient

ly followed and the President's
office had been so inactive.
Art Of The Possible
It was also often difficult to
get any positive statements of
position from representatives of
the administration. That which
was most often exercised was
caution. E. Howard Brooks ex
pressed a typical attitude by lec
turing me on politics—the art
of the possible. He admonished
me not to rock the boat and not
to make waves. One must stay
on good terms, for compromise
is eventual and negotiation is
very sensitive. The basis for all
his operations, he told me, was
keeping people pleased with
each other.
This philosophy was embodied
in action by Wallace Sterling in
his dealings with the Army. A
General proposed the possibility
of a plan for solution of the
problem. The plan involved each
student submitting a letter of
application through a series of
Army command groups until
Continental Army Command
gave its permission—for a Stan
ford course.
Sterling thought this was a
fine idea and was happy for
such Army flexibility. He was,
in fact, unwilling to ask for any
thing more independent. His ac
tions were designed not to up
set any members of the group
with which he was negotiating.
In all cases every effort was
made not to antagonize the
Army.
