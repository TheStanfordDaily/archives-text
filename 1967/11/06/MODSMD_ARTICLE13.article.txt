# Another Attempts
## Encina High Jinks But Joel Is Tough 
### Herbie Hinckes 
Although last week's demon
strations against the CIA didn't
come off too well, I suspect all
the demonstrators had fun, par
ticularly on Wednesday.
The humorous incidents didn't
get reported in the papers, as
usual. So, as a loyal guardian
of the 4th estate, I will Chronicle
and Examine these Times.

As I was rushing up the back
stairway of Encina with the
protesters, I suddenly noticed a
rather large fellow just ahead
of me. I had never seen him be
fore, even though I've been to
every noon rally.
He was wearing a red and
green long-sleeved flannel shirt
and blue jeans, sufficiently grub
by. But his belt buckle was the
giveaway — centered on the
buckle in large letters was "Pur
due."
"An obvious imposter," I told
myself. No one at Stanford who
had gone to Purdue would ever
admit it.
I saw him again an hour later,
part of a group of 10 students
listening to Dave Harris tell of
his adventures in Santa Rita
Jail. He was leaning against one
of the sandstone pillars that
allegedly support Encina Hall,
taking in every word from the
leader's mouth.
Then I remembered: The
Santa Clara County Sheriff sent
some plainclothes deputies to
the sit-in. I asked a few people
if they had ever seen him be
fore, taking into account the
vague possibility he might be
some unknown graduate stu
dent.
No one knew him. Then David
Ransom, ace photographer and
co-editor of the Midpeninsula
Observer, tried to take his pic
ture. No matter which angle
Dave tried, he couldn't snap the

picture because the man con
tinually shielded his face.
Finally he left, Purdue belt
and all, with Ransom in hot
pursuit. Dave eventually got the
picture, which should be printed
in his paper soon.

Around 10 a.m., the protesters
started climbing up a fire escape
and entered a third floor win
dow. The Stanford Police had
cleverly sealed off the building's
door, but left the windows open.
Once upstairs, the demonstra
tors noted the generally filthy
condition of Encina, then pro
ceded with plans to disrupt the
CIA interviews one floor below.
About seven students went in
to one of the old dormitory's
rooms and noisily stomped
around for a few minutes. Then
the press photographers and TV
cameramen started climbing in
the window and entering the
dormitory room.
All of the demonstrators left
the room as all the pressmen
went in. What we wound up
with was the three major TV
networks and several local
newspaper representatives
standing in the room together
and the protestors standing out
side, watching them.
"Come on in," the photograph
ers begged. So the demonstrat
ors did, formed a ring, and
started folkdancing, while sing
ing Hava Nageela.
Downstairs, the CIA agent
was frantically moving his desk
to avoid being hit by a shaky
light fixture.

On the serious side, however,
most of the violence at the
Wednesday demonstration was
caused by University officials.
When Jack Gerson left the
building after his interview with
the CIA agent, he paused mo
mentarily with the carefully
guarded door open.
Behind him, fearless Dean of
Students Joel Smith decided
Gerson had taken enough time
at the door. Joel pushed the stu
dent roughly, trying to force
him out. (If anybody is going
to get violent, it should be the
police, don't you think, Joel?)
Smith pushed Gerson out of
the doorway, then he and a
Stanford policeman tried to
close it. But on the other side,
four demonstrators did their
best to keep it open.
Huffing and puffing, Joel just
couldn't close that door.
At this point another student
shoved his picket sign into the
doorway. Joel pulled the sign
off the stick, but gosharootie!!
that didn't help much, the stick
was still in the doorway.
Eventually the Powers That
Be won the battle and the door
was closed.

door, but left the windows open.
Once upstairs, the demonstra

condition of Encina, then pro
ceded with plans to disrupt the
CIA interviews one floor below.
About seven students went in
to one of the old dormitory's
rooms and noisily stomped
around for a few minutes. Then
the press photographers and TV
cameramen started climbing in
the window and entering the
dormitory room.
All of the demonstrators left
the room as all the pressmen
went in. What we wound up
with was the three major TV
networks and several local
newspaper representatives
standing in the room together
and the protestors standing out
side, watching them.
"Come on in," the photograph
ers begged. So the demonstrat
ors did, formed a ring, and
started folkdancing, while sing
ing Hava Nageela.
Downstairs, the CIA agent
was frantically moving his desk
to avoid being hit by a shaky
light fixture.

On the serious side, however,
most of the violence at the
Wednesday demonstration was
caused by University officials.
When Jack Gerson left the
building after his interview with
the CIA agent, he paused mo
mentarily with the carefully
guarded door open.
Behind him, fearless Dean of
Students Joel Smith decided
Gerson had taken enough time
at the door. Joel pushed the stu
dent roughly, trying to force
him out. (If anybody is going
to get violent, it should be the
police, don't you think, Joel?)
Smith pushed Gerson out of
the doorway, then he and a
Stanford policeman tried to
close it. But on the other side,
four demonstrators did their
best to keep it open.
Huffing and puffing, Joel just
couldn't close that door.
At this point another student
shoved his picket sign into the
doorway. Joel pulled the sign
off the stick, but gosharootie!!
that didn't help much, the stick
was still in the doorway.
Eventually the Powers That
Be won the battle and the door

Although last week's demon

As I was rushing up the back
stairway of Encina with the
protesters, I suddenly noticed a
rather large fellow just ahead
of me. I had never seen him be
fore, even though I've been to
every noon rally.
He was wearing a red and
green long-sleeved flannel shirt
and blue jeans, sufficiently grub
by. But his belt buckle was the
giveaway — centered on the
buckle in large letters was "Pur
due."
"An obvious imposter," I told
myself. No one at Stanford who
had gone to Purdue would ever
admit it.
I saw him again an hour later,
part of a group of 10 students
listening to Dave Harris tell of
his adventures in Santa Rita
Jail. He was leaning against one
of the sandstone pillars that
allegedly support Encina Hall,
taking in every word from the
leader's mouth.
Then I remembered: The
Santa Clara County Sheriff sent
some plainclothes deputies to
the sit-in. I asked a few people
if they had ever seen him be
fore, taking into account the
vague possibility he might be
some unknown graduate stu
dent.
No one knew him. Then David
Ransom, ace photographer and
co-editor of the Midpeninsula
Observer, tried to take his pic
ture. No matter which angle
Dave tried, he couldn't snap the

picture because the man con
tinually shielded his face.
Finally he left, Purdue belt
and all, with Ransom in hot
pursuit. Dave eventually got the
picture, which should be printed
in his paper soon.

come off too well, I suspect all
the demonstrators had fun, par
ticularly on Wednesday.
The humorous incidents didn't
get reported in the papers, as
usual. So, as a loyal guardian
of the 4th estate, I will Chronicle
and Examine these Times.

As I was rushing up the back
stairway of Encina with the
protesters, I suddenly noticed a
rather large fellow just ahead
of me. I had never seen him be
fore, even though I've been to
every noon rally.
He was wearing a red and
green long-sleeved flannel shirt
and blue jeans, sufficiently grub
by. But his belt buckle was the
giveaway — centered on the
buckle in large letters was "Pur
due."
"An obvious imposter," I told
myself. No one at Stanford who
had gone to Purdue would ever
admit it.
I saw him again an hour later,
part of a group of 10 students
listening to Dave Harris tell of
his adventures in Santa Rita
Jail. He was leaning against one
of the sandstone pillars that
allegedly support Encina Hall,
taking in every word from the
leader's mouth.
Then I remembered: The
Santa Clara County Sheriff sent
some plainclothes deputies to
the sit-in. I asked a few people
if they had ever seen him be
fore, taking into account the
vague possibility he might be
some unknown graduate stu
dent.
No one knew him. Then David
Ransom, ace photographer and
co-editor of the Midpeninsula
Observer, tried to take his pic
ture. No matter which angle
Dave tried, he couldn't snap the

picture because the man con
tinually shielded his face.
Finally he left, Purdue belt
and all, with Ransom in hot
pursuit. Dave eventually got the
picture, which should be printed
in his paper soon.

Around 10 a.m., the protesters
started climbing up a fire escape
and entered a third floor win
dow. The Stanford Police had
cleverly sealed off the building's
door, but left the windows open.
Once upstairs, the demonstra
tors noted the generally filthy
condition of Encina, then pro
ceded with plans to disrupt the
CIA interviews one floor below.
About seven students went in
to one of the old dormitory's
rooms and noisily stomped
around for a few minutes. Then
the press photographers and TV
cameramen started climbing in
the window and entering the
dormitory room.
All of the demonstrators left
the room as all the pressmen
went in. What we wound up
with was the three major TV
networks and several local
newspaper representatives
standing in the room together
and the protestors standing out
side, watching them.
"Come on in," the photograph
ers begged. So the demonstrat
ors did, formed a ring, and
started folkdancing, while sing
ing Hava Nageela.
Downstairs, the CIA agent
was frantically moving his desk
to avoid being hit by a shaky
light fixture.

On the serious side, however,
most of the violence at the
Wednesday demonstration was
caused by University officials.
When Jack Gerson left the
building after his interview with
the CIA agent, he paused mo
mentarily with the carefully
guarded door open.
Behind him, fearless Dean of
Students Joel Smith decided
Gerson had taken enough time
at the door. Joel pushed the stu
dent roughly, trying to force
him out. (If anybody is going
to get violent, it should be the
police, don't you think, Joel?)
Smith pushed Gerson out of
the doorway, then he and a
Stanford policeman tried to
close it. But on the other side,
four demonstrators did their
best to keep it open.
Huffing and puffing, Joel just
couldn't close that door.
At this point another student
shoved his picket sign into the
doorway. Joel pulled the sign
off the stick, but gosharootie!!
that didn't help much, the stick
was still in the doorway.
Eventually the Powers That
Be won the battle and the door
was closed.
