## In Our Need: Where Are The Frats? 
### 
Editor, the Daily:
I think I speak for a lot of
Freshmen when I say that I am
disappointed with Stanford. No,
I am not speaking about the
supposedly over-restrictive cur
ricula, nor am I speaking about
the inconsistency of the football
team, nor am I referring to the
consistency of the protests.
I am disappointed, however
with the way Cal is pushing
Stanford around. In the first
place, they have the axe, and it
seems that no one is doing much
to get it back. Then, today I
read in Herb Caen's column in
the Examiner (sic) that Cal rec
ently made "a daring foray to
Palo Alto that netted all of Stan
ford's goal posts." What will
they take next? Maybe the sta
dium, or even the football team.
Where are the fraternities,
the eating houses, the dorm or
ganizations in our time of need?
Are we Freshmen supposed to
believe that Cal can and does
walk on Stanford like this all
the time? What an example you
are setting for us. Will we ever
be able to hold our heads up in
public again?

• Book Baggers
Editor, the Daily:
I'm getting sick and tired of
psuedo-intellectual book baggers
undermining tradition at Stan

ford under the guise of worldly
sophistication.
Mike Snyder, candidate for
head cheerleader, has shown by
his campaign (non-existent) and
his comments in yesterday's
Daily that he thinks intercolleg
iate sports in general and cheer
leading, specifically, is a farce.
Maybe it is stupid to feel
proud of your school and its
athletic teams. Personally, I
don't think so. Only a flaming
book bagger would deny the ex
citement of the crowd and the
glory of a hard fought match.
Snyder's candidacy, like Wendy
Wonka's running for homecom
ing queen, make tragic laughing
matters of some of our finest
traditions.

• Here I Am
Editor, The Daily:
I am now available for com
ment.
While standing in White Plaza,
surveying the various campaigns
for Head Yell Leader, I viewed
one candidate wearing red un
derwear with webbed armpits,
one candidate putting up a post
er followed moments later by
three other people tearing it
down, and one candidate preach
ing about his own salvation. I
was appalled. Something has to

be done to return this campaign
to its true perspective.
The Head Yell Leader exists to
initiate and co-ordinate the en
thusiasm of those attending
games. In the past there has
been an equally weak attempt
at both initiation and co-ordina
tion, resulting in a greal deal of
dissention in the yell section.
What our rooting section needs
is enthusiasm, not cynicism;
originality, not gimmicks; but
most of all, let's ban the Sound
of Silence!!!

• Lacerda Coverage
Editor, The Daily:
I covered the speech of Car
los Lacerda on Monday, October
31, on behalf of the Stanford
News Service as well as Agence
France Presse and United Press
International. At no time did
I hear him accuse Students for
a Democratic Society of being
Communist, of "demagoguery,"
and of "making political hay of
the poverty of others." Further
more, I detected no implication,
which is a dangerous conclusion
for any reporter to draw, that
SDS was supporting the Com
munist Revolution in Russia, as
reporter James Perloff asserts
in the October 31 Daily.
What he did speak to, refer
ring to the pamphlet distributed

before his talk by the Stanford
chapter of SDS, was the epithet
"the Barry Goldwater of Bra
zil." Lacerda said that the term
was not original with SDS, that
it first appeared in a story about
him in the Paris edition of "the
late Herald-Tribune," and furth
er that "I am not associated
with such awful reactionaries"
(referring to Goldwater). "I'm
surprised at Students for a Dem
ocratic Society. I thought they
had their own thoughts," he said.
Nor was he "addressing him
self to SDS" when he said that
Brazil had made more relative
progress in 50 years than Rus
sia has made with a revolution.
This was one of a series of re
marks about Brazil's propsects
for the future.
The deliberate attempt to
make a visiting Brazilian politi
cal leader appear to be criticiz
ing a student political group in
a foreign country is biased re
porting at its worst as well as a
flagrant violation of the canons
of journalism.

A New-Leftie's Lament
I turned in my draft card

here's the truthful price I
pay — Now how the hell

Editor, the Daily:
I think I speak for a lot of
Freshmen when I say that I am
disappointed with Stanford. No,
I am not speaking about the
supposedly over-restrictive cur
ricula, nor am I speaking about
the inconsistency of the football
team, nor am I referring to the
consistency of the protests.
I am disappointed, however
with the way Cal is pushing
Stanford around. In the first
place, they have the axe, and it
seems that no one is doing much
to get it back. Then, today I
read in Herb Caen's column in
the Examiner (sic) that Cal rec
ently made "a daring foray to
Palo Alto that netted all of Stan
ford's goal posts." What will
they take next? Maybe the sta
dium, or even the football team.
Where are the fraternities,
the eating houses, the dorm or
ganizations in our time of need?
Are we Freshmen supposed to
believe that Cal can and does
walk on Stanford like this all
the time? What an example you
are setting for us. Will we ever
be able to hold our heads up in
public again?

• Book Baggers
Editor, the Daily:
I'm getting sick and tired of
psuedo-intellectual book baggers
undermining tradition at Stan

ford under the guise of worldly
sophistication.
Mike Snyder, candidate for
head cheerleader, has shown by
his campaign (non-existent) and
his comments in yesterday's
Daily that he thinks intercolleg
iate sports in general and cheer
leading, specifically, is a farce.
Maybe it is stupid to feel
proud of your school and its
athletic teams. Personally, I
don't think so. Only a flaming
book bagger would deny the ex
citement of the crowd and the
glory of a hard fought match.
Snyder's candidacy, like Wendy
Wonka's running for homecom
ing queen, make tragic laughing
matters of some of our finest
traditions.

• Here I Am
Editor, The Daily:
I am now available for com
ment.
While standing in White Plaza,
surveying the various campaigns
for Head Yell Leader, I viewed
one candidate wearing red un
derwear with webbed armpits,
one candidate putting up a post
er followed moments later by
three other people tearing it
down, and one candidate preach
ing about his own salvation. I
was appalled. Something has to

be done to return this campaign
to its true perspective.
The Head Yell Leader exists to
initiate and co-ordinate the en
thusiasm of those attending
games. In the past there has
been an equally weak attempt
at both initiation and co-ordina
tion, resulting in a greal deal of
dissention in the yell section.
What our rooting section needs
is enthusiasm, not cynicism;
originality, not gimmicks; but
most of all, let's ban the Sound
of Silence!!!

Editor, The Daily:
I covered the speech of Car
los Lacerda on Monday, October
31, on behalf of the Stanford
News Service as well as Agence
France Presse and United Press
International. At no time did
I hear him accuse Students for
a Democratic Society of being
Communist, of "demagoguery,"
and of "making political hay of
the poverty of others." Further
more, I detected no implication,
which is a dangerous conclusion
for any reporter to draw, that
SDS was supporting the Com
munist Revolution in Russia, as
reporter James Perloff asserts
in the October 31 Daily.
What he did speak to, refer
ring to the pamphlet distributed

before his talk by the Stanford
chapter of SDS, was the epithet
"the Barry Goldwater of Bra
zil." Lacerda said that the term
was not original with SDS, that
it first appeared in a story about
him in the Paris edition of "the
late Herald-Tribune," and furth
er that "I am not associated
with such awful reactionaries"
(referring to Goldwater). "I'm

I hear him accuse Students for
a Democratic Society of being
Communist, of "demagoguery,"
and of "making political hay of
the poverty of others." Further
more, I detected no implication,
which is a dangerous conclusion
for any reporter to draw, that
SDS was supporting the Com
munist Revolution in Russia, as
reporter James Perloff asserts
in the October 31 Daily.
What he did speak to, refer
ring to the pamphlet distributed

before his talk by the Stanford
chapter of SDS, was the epithet
"the Barry Goldwater of Bra
zil." Lacerda said that the term
was not original with SDS, that
it first appeared in a story about
him in the Paris edition of "the
late Herald-Tribune," and furth
er that "I am not associated
with such awful reactionaries"
(referring to Goldwater). "I'm
surprised at Students for a Dem
ocratic Society. I thought they
had their own thoughts," he said.
Nor was he "addressing him
self to SDS" when he said that
Brazil had made more relative
progress in 50 years than Rus
sia has made with a revolution.
This was one of a series of re
marks about Brazil's propsects
for the future.
The deliberate attempt to
make a visiting Brazilian politi
cal leader appear to be criticiz
ing a student political group in
a foreign country is biased re
porting at its worst as well as a
flagrant violation of the canons
of journalism.

A New-Leftie's Lament

here's the truthful price I
pay — Now how the hell

Editor, the Daily:
I think I speak for a lot of
Freshmen when I say that I am
disappointed with Stanford. No,
I am not speaking about the
supposedly over-restrictive cur
ricula, nor am I speaking about
the inconsistency of the football
team, nor am I referring to the
consistency of the protests.
I am disappointed, however
with the way Cal is pushing
Stanford around. In the first
place, they have the axe, and it
seems that no one is doing much
to get it back. Then, today I
read in Herb Caen's column in
the Examiner (sic) that Cal rec
ently made "a daring foray to
Palo Alto that netted all of Stan
ford's goal posts." What will
they take next? Maybe the sta
dium, or even the football team.
Where are the fraternities,
the eating houses, the dorm or
ganizations in our time of need?
Are we Freshmen supposed to
believe that Cal can and does
walk on Stanford like this all
the time? What an example you
are setting for us. Will we ever
be able to hold our heads up in
public again?

• Book Baggers
Editor, the Daily:
I'm getting sick and tired of
psuedo-intellectual book baggers
undermining tradition at Stan

ford under the guise of worldly
sophistication.
Mike Snyder, candidate for
head cheerleader, has shown by
his campaign (non-existent) and
his comments in yesterday's
Daily that he thinks intercolleg
iate sports in general and cheer
leading, specifically, is a farce.
Maybe it is stupid to feel
proud of your school and its
athletic teams. Personally, I
don't think so. Only a flaming
book bagger would deny the ex
citement of the crowd and the
glory of a hard fought match.
Snyder's candidacy, like Wendy
Wonka's running for homecom
ing queen, make tragic laughing
matters of some of our finest
traditions.

• Here I Am
Editor, The Daily:
I am now available for com
ment.
While standing in White Plaza,
surveying the various campaigns
for Head Yell Leader, I viewed
one candidate wearing red un
derwear with webbed armpits,
one candidate putting up a post
er followed moments later by
three other people tearing it
down, and one candidate preach
ing about his own salvation. I
was appalled. Something has to

be done to return this campaign
to its true perspective.
The Head Yell Leader exists to
initiate and co-ordinate the en
thusiasm of those attending
games. In the past there has
been an equally weak attempt
at both initiation and co-ordina
tion, resulting in a greal deal of
dissention in the yell section.
What our rooting section needs
is enthusiasm, not cynicism;
originality, not gimmicks; but
most of all, let's ban the Sound
of Silence!!!
