## Free Speech Is Not The Issue 
### Christopher Hargrove 
The real issue in the CIA re
cruiting controversy, our liberal
professors to the contrary not
withstanding, is not free speech
at all. It is power.
The CIA has immense power,
and it is using this power to
overthrow legal governments,
stifle free thought in very sub
tle ways and steer world events
in directions favorable to the
American power structure.
It obtained this power with
the knowledge and consent of
our freely elected leaders. It is
not an autonomous organization
which operates in far-off lands
in ways unbeknownst to our
government. It is an arm of that
government, and nothing it does
is a secret from Lyndon John
son.
CIA Compatible
The CIA is entirely compat
ible with the conscious and un
conscious aims of American lib
erals, who want only the best
(as they see it) for the people
of the world. It has been said,
in fact, that there are more
liberals per square foot in the
CIA than in any other branch of
the government.
Thus, to attack the CIA is to
attack those in whose names
it acts—our national leaders and
those in whose names it acts—
our national leaders and those
who vote for them. And these
are the people who rush to de
fend CIA recruiting on grounds
of free speech.
It is almost as if they know
subconsciously whose side the
CIA is on.

The free speech argument,
however, doesn't make much
sense when we see how free
speech operates in every-day
affairs.
For instance, if we allow the
CIA at Stanford on grounds of
free speech (or pure tolerance,
as Marcuse calls it), we should
also allow representatives of
Fidel Castro and Ho Chi Minh.
Yet these latter aren't even al
lowed in the country by the
State Department.
Is that the University's fault?
Partly, because the University
cooperates with and legitimizes
our government.
Free speech is permitted only
for those who do not appear to
threaten up by stepping too far
out of line. And by that I do not
mean yelling "Fire" in a
crowded theater. I mean, for ex
ample, advocating forcible re
sistence to forcible oppression
in the Negro ghettos.
Not For Viet Cong
Free speech does not apply,
in this country, for the Viet
Cong but it does apply for a
secret Federal agency which for
years has acted in violation of
even the most rudimentary pre
cepts of international law.
Is there not a discrepancy
here? Is not free speech limited
by the very system that says
we should fight to the death for
it? Is it not true, therefore, that
truly free speech, in whose
name CIA recruiting is de
fended, does not really exist at
all here?
It is true, of course, that a

person can say nearly anything
he wants in the U.S., if he does
n't mind being followed by the
FBI and having his mail opened
and his telephone tapped.
No Resources
But if he wants to reach 190
million people, he cannot call a
press conference and bring the
TV networks scrambling to the
State Department auditorium
within minutes. Nor can he
mobilize the government print
ing office on his behalf.
The huge resources of the fed
eral government make the free
and open competition of ideas
an impossibility. Dissenters are
overwhelmed, and their only re
course is force of one kind or
another.

If free speech fails, should we
turn to violence? I believe that
would be foolish in the extreme.
Our police and army are too
strong and too loyal.
Bethinking
But there are other kinds of
force, and their end is to force
people to rethink their precon
ceptions, get their consciences
worked up perhaps and, it is
hoped, change their minds.
Certain kinds of confronta
tion tactics do this very well;
the Berkeley sit-in of 1964 is an
example. The anti-CIA non-sit-in
of last week is a good example
of a failure.
Maybe things will be different
Friday when Dow Chemical is
here to recruit.
