# Stanford And Concord Establish New Alliance
## 
### 
Stanford has established an
across-t he-Bay alliance with the
booming, sprawling, potpourri
town of Concord in Contra
Costa County.
The Concord Chamber of
Commerce has put up $2,000 to
cover expenses and apply to the
University's year-long Commun
ity Planning Laboratory (CPL),
in the Department of Art and
Architecture, for a study with
recommendations due next
June.
Concord was designated one
of 22 finalists in the Look Maga
zine-National Municipal League
Ail-American City Contest. The
CPL picked Concord's proposal
from more than a dozen appli
cations.

Regarded as a testing ground
for new relationships between
universities and communities,
the alliance between Stanford
and Concord involves townspeo
ple, students, regular faculty,
and an auxiliary expert.
With a population of 85,000
and an erea of 22 square miles,
Concord has some of the prob
lems many communities face to
day. Experts predict the city's
population may reach 200,000 in
only a few years. Concord's pop
ulation in 1940 was 1,000.
It has a new enclosed shop
ping center, said to be the larg
est in the world, and an older
downtown or "intown" section
that is lagging. A new four-year

state college is planned with
opening date set for 1971. Port
Chicago, the Naval arms ship
ping center, is its neighbor.
The city has a planning office
and a several-years-old city plan
done by a team of professionals.
Earlier this month it received
recognition for its efforts to
cope with its problems of rapid
growth, contrasts, and change
when it was mentioned in Look
Magazine.
A Metamorphosis
John Lytton, visiting lecturer
in Urban Design in the Division
of Architecture, told the Con
cord Chamber of Commerce
"Stanford has chosen Concord,
but remember you have also
chosen Stanford. The two work
ing together could create a re
markable metamorphosis."
Stanford's CPL includes 20
students in architecture, engi
neering, law, business, geology,
history and communication. The
group includes Teaching Assis
tant John Platou from Norway,
the son of Srithjos Platou, archi
tect in charge of major rede
velopment going on now in Oslo.
The CPL, now in its fourth
year, will make a program pre
sentation at 8 p.m. on November
21 in the Concord City Council
Chamber.
