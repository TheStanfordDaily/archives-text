# Faculty Club Nixes Bearded Employees
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Bearded senior Muni Bar ash
has l>een officially turned down
in his bid for a Faculty Club
waiter position.
Barash's disbarment came
after a decision last Thursday
by the faculty committee on
Faculty Club management to
continue its present policy of
denying food handling jobs to
men with beards.
"The decision was based only
an sanitary considerations and
not on aesthetics," according
to Mason Yearian, professor of
physics, and chairman of the
Faculty Club committee.
Yearian acknowledged that
state and county sanitary laws
do not prohibit bearded waiter
or food handlers. The commit
tee felt that "the laws are de
ficient," Yearian explained.
Only Hairnets Required
A check with state and coun
ty authorities revealed that the
only requirement is that fe
male food handlers must wear
hairnets while on duty.
An informed source reported
that this state law is not being
actively enforced in the club;
women who pour coffee wore
hairnets one day last week
after the first Daily article on
Barash's disbarment appeared,
but have not worn them any
time before or since.
A faculty member described
this as a "hypocritical interpre
tation of the law. They decided
to extend the law, while ignor
ing its original provisions."
Yearian said the committee

arrived at its decision after
considering faculty opinion.
"The feelings of the committee
members and the faculty in
general were that they would
prefer not to have bearded
waiters." He emphasized that
sanitary—and not aesthetic —
considerations were the basis
for these opinions.
"Fooling No One"
Barash had this comment on
the committee decision: "The
Faculty Club decided not to
change its present policy of
exclusion. Being a private club
the> have the right to do so.
Nevertheless, they are fooling
no one by their ruling made
under the guise of sanitary
considerations.
"More germane to their de
cision was a dogmatic aes
thetic condemnation of beards
and the independence of
thought they represent."
Yearian was asked if the
recent University Food Service
decision to liberalize its policy
and employ waiters with neat
ly trimmed beards had affect
ed their deliberations. He re
plied "the Food Service is a
different kind of operation. We
felt that the reasons for rever
sing their decision did not ap
ply in the case of the Faculty
Club." He refused to elaborate
further on the distinction.
Although Barash is now offi
cially barred from the Faculty
Club position he sought, he
congratulated the Food Service
former policy, the University

Food Service found It unnec
essarily restrictive," he stated.
Yearian added that the club
committee members reaffrmed
the right of any student or fac
ulty member to wear a beard,
but that the faculty prefers
that only clean shaven men
handle their food at the club.
Barash had a philosophic re
action to the committee's atti
tude: "Each person has his
own glasses; many of the pre
vious generation are accus
tomed to viewing the world
through frames shaded by cri
teria of race, creed, or color.
I try to judge every person on
his personal habits and ability
to live harmoniously with his
fellows."
Yearian emphasized that the
committee meeting was not
(tailed primarily for considera
tion of the beard problem.
"The meeting was called origi
nally to discuss the Faculty
Club's financial status. The
beard question was only one
of about ten items on the agen
da." The committee meets
about once a quarter.
Chester Berry, manager of
Tresidder Union and the Facul
ty Club, refused to comment
over the weekend on the com
mittee's deliberations. Berry
stated, however, that any posi
tion except a food handling
job is open to Barash or any
one with a beard —at Tresidder
and the club. At least one Fac
ulty Club food service em
ployee has a small beard, but
he does not handle food.
