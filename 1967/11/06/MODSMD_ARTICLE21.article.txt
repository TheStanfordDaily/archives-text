# The 						Demonstration Life
## Serrans Talk On Comm Action, Coed Life 
### VIC OWEN ODYS WOLLAN 
What do you think of Serra
House? "It's my home and I dig
it."
How are the projects regard
ing the theme, "Community Ac
tion"? "Well, there are a lot of
them, and most are a challenge
beyond just a liberal commit
ment."
And co-ed living? "It's just
more natural."
★ ★ ★
This is just part of an inter
view with one of the residents of
Serra house, the "Community
Action" demonstration house in
Stern Hall.
Serra House is one of the four
co - educational demonstration
houses recommended by the
Dean of Student's Office and
chosen by the Board of Trus
tees last year as an experiment
in undergraduate living.
There are three basic differ
ences between the demonstra
tion houses and the "normal"
undergraduate housing:
• All four houses are planned
around a specific theme, in this
case "Community Action",
• The demonstration houses
are co-educational, and
• An attempt is made to cre
ate a more intense academic at
mosphere.
Resident Opinions
When asked how she liked the
demonstration house structure
as an introduction to Stanford,
Debie Howard, freshman resi
dent answered, "I like it be
cause I'm not surrounded by
(freshmen. The upperclassmen
give us a lot of good advice."
Carl Andurin, house president
noted, "People just do things
for the house. We hardly do
any soliciting for help with proj
ects."
Tina Press, Junior resident
said, "My main reason for liv
ing here was the fact it would
combine academic atmosphere
with living conditions. The for
mal academic program has been
disappointing, but I enjoy the
informal living structure. I think
it's the best alternative for wom
en's residences."
Bill Lau, who lived in Serra
House for two years before it
became a demonstration house,
said, "This is the first time I've
seen it where people are inter
ested in meeting the other peo
ple in the house. Also, it's the
first year when there have been
guests here for meals."
Minimum Committmnt
The minimum committment of
house residents to the Commu
nity Action projects is three
hours a week.
Every resident has his choice
of how he would like to partici
pate. There is little or no for
mal structure. If the student
does not wish to participate in
any of the house projects, he
may find one of his own.
Mrs. Robert Freelen, wife of
the faculty resident, is the co
ordinator of most of the projects
within the house. She stated that
the program is not so much en
tirely innovation as an expan
sion of several programs that
were run last year.
Mrs. Freelen emphasizes sev
eral basic aims at the heart of
the Community Action program:
• To keep underprivileged
schoolchiddren in school by giv
ing them the basic skills to get
more out of their education;
• to improve housing condi
tions among the underprivileged
by helping families to improve
their living quarters;
• to train schoolchildren to
be good workers so that they

will be good job holders in the
future;
• To provide immediate part
time jobs to school-age children
to help out families, so that the
school children will not be forced
to drop school for work; and
• to teach heads of families
employment skills to improve
their employment level.
No Give-A way
Mrs. Freelen emphasized that
the overall program was not a
give-away but designed to pro
vide underprivileged groups, par
ticularly school children, with
the skills to help themselves.
The programs designed to car
ry out these aims are the follow
ing:
There is the organization of
Stanford Friends in Mountain
View which works in the Whis
man Elementary School District.
This program aims at creating
a friendship with a college stu
dent that will hopefully act as
an inspiration for many aspects
of the child' life.
There is a tutorial program in
the Mountain View-Los Altos
High School District designed to
work with high school students
with academic problems.
Black Power Tutoring
One of the most interesting
programs is the tutoring for the
Black Community Relations As
sociation, a black power oriented
association. In this project, tu
tors will be working under the
black power organization, and
will be advising - tutoring school
children, high school drop-outs,
or adults who would like to get
some more education. The age of
the tutees was given by the
BCRA director as "anywhere
from 4 to 64." The tutors will
meet at the homes of the tutees,
and the meetings will unstruct
ured. According to the BCRA
director, "One night you may
teach him math, the other night
he'll teach you to dig soul mu
sic." The tutoring is on a 1:1
basis.
There is another program
working with Spanish-surname
students of high ability but low
achievement to prepare them for
further education. One student
commented on this project, "The
kids just seem to have no inter
est. We're trying some experi
mental education like helping
them act out skits, and then
hopefully we'll write some to
gether."
The Share Project is another
in which the students meet at
the homes of the tutees. One
eighth grade student could only
read remedial fantasy stories.
Her Serra House tutor said,
"She's really receptive, and her
mother wants everything for
her, but the environment just
hasn't given her the breaks."
Big Brother
There is a Big Brother pro
gram at Crittendon Jr. High.
Those in this project are work
ing with 7th and Bth grade stu
dents, many of whom have read
ing problems.
There are several creative in
dependent projects. Some of the
men of Serra are attempting to
form a recreational soccer lea
gue for the Mt. View school chil
dren. There are other indepen
dent tutoring projects, as well
as residents working at no sal
ary as teaching assistants.
The development of casual re
lationships is stressed in all proj
ects. Later in the year, there will
be several picnics with the tu
tors and tutees.
A Student Projects Committee
is in charge of this aspect of
the Serra House Program. One
of the duties of the committee is

to prevent a Serra House dupli
cation of an already existing
community project.
Naturally Co-ed
The co-educational aspect of
the house is taken for granted.
Anduri said, "The social situa
tion hasn't affected many peo
ple very much. It's just more
natural." The students have
found it rewarding to be able to
establish relationships that are
not bounded by courtship rules.
The other big aspect of the
house program is the academic
program. This is an attempt to
approach social problems from
a number of different areas and
to give it relevance in an aca
demic framework.
This area of the Community
Action program appears to have
run into some difficulties. Three
student reactions to this pro
gram were as follows: (All the
students interviewed in this area
wished to remain anonymous.)
"There is absolutely no relevance
between the course I'm taking
and the theme of the house.
(Community Action)''. "What
academic atmosphere?" "It's
really pretty pathetic."
The house Academic Planning
committee is in charge of this
area. They have completed a
study of the various depart
ments, selecting topics that
would be relevant to the theme
of Community Action.
Problems With Seminars
The greatest problem involved
in initiating seminars is the fact
that professors are not paid for
teaching the in-house seminars.
Also, credit is not given for sem
inars that are taught by some
one other than a professor.
There are two in-house semi
nars for the fall quarter. One is
Business and Ethics, and the
other is a Workshop in American
Social Drama.
The Business and Ethics semi
nar is taught by Prof. Krepps.
The course seeks to examine var
ious phases of business ethics
within the community — the re
sponsibility of business in a so
cial sense, creating jobs, etc.;
the ethics of operating a busi
ness focusing on such aspects as
quality, price differentiation in
income groups; and, finally, the
problems of the individual and
his ethics in an organization
which makes unethical choices.
The Workshop in American
Social Drama seeks to under
stand and to probe the personal
ity of those with social problems
by performing their roles.
Less than a third of the resi
dents are involved with the in
house seminars.
There are also special pro

grams of individual with em
phasis of particular aspects of
social problems. These programs
are presented to those of the
house that are interested.
Thus far, George Brosi, Stan
ford graduate and social worker,
has given an open seminar on
"Vocations for Social Change";
there was a seminar on "Drug
Use and Abuse" presented by
doctors from the Stanford Medi
cal Center and the Haight-Ash
bury Clinic; and the Resistance
presented slides on North Viet
nam.
In discussing the history and
conception of the program, Mrs.
Freelen said it was first thought
of as an extension of last year's
program. She said that the
Dean's Office first became aware
of the program when they re
ceived activity credits for peo
ple who had worked on the jobs
service and the tutorial pro
grams. It was then suggested
that the program be verbalized
and presented to the Board of
Trustees.
Perhaps the best summation
of this demonstration house was
given by Martha Sward, fresh
man resident, who said, "It may
not fulfill all the expectations,
but I like it, and as far as I'm
concerned, it's a lot better than
the other housing posibilities."

happy work on one of the many Community Action projects open
to house members.
