# Irregularities Found In LASSU Petitions
## 
### 
A last-minute flood of nomin
ating petitions for legislature
seats reached the Associated Stu
dents' office by Friday's dead
line, but many are invalid, ac
cording to elections commis
sioner Craig Brown.
Speaker Michael Weinstein
ruled that candidates whose pe
titions contain signatures of
students who are not in their
constituency will have until
noon tomorrow to collect 15
valid signatures.
Most of the bad petitions are
for the 27 vacant seats for off
campus undergraduates. Only
undergraduates who are living
off campus and not paying dues
to an eating club or fraternity

are eligible to sign these nom
inating petitions.
Many of the off-campus peti
tions Brown received contained
signatures of fraternity mem
bers and graduates.
Thirty-eight petitions were sub
mitted for the 22 seats for
humanities and science school
graduate students. The at-large
election Wednesday and Thurs
day will choose the representa
tives for both the unfilled grad
uate and undergraduate seats in
the student legislature.
Only three engineering grad
uate students submitted peti
tions. The engineering school
has 19 vacant seats in LASSU,
so the three, Lawrence E. Jer
ome, Gene E. Willeke, and Jo

seph H. Lane, will automatically
become LASSU members if
Brown certifies their petitions
as valid.
One education student, Gor
don S. Jones, submitted a peti
tion. The education school has
seven vacant seats.
Because vacancies remain In
these constituencies, Weinstein
said engineering and education
students can automatically be
come LASSU members if they
turn in valid petitions.
The polls will be open 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. Wednesday and Thurs
day at the Quad's engineering
corner and at the post office,
Brown announced.
Also on the ballot will be a
referendum on two propositions.
The first is "Proposition P,"
now before the voters In San
Francisco, which will read:
"Shall it be the policy of the
students of Stanford University
that there be an immediate
cease fire and withdrawal of
U.S. troops from Vietnam so
that the Vietnamese people can
settle their own problems."
The second proposition ex
presses sympathy for the "peace
vigil" planned in Memorial
Church Saturday.
All students will be eligible to
vote on the propositions, but
only graduates and off-campus
undergraduates are eligible in
LASSU elections.
