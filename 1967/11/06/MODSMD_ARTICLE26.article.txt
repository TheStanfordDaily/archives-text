# Women To Study Anti-War Action
## 
### 
Women who sympathize with
the Resistance anti-draft move
ment will meet this evening at
7:30 in Tresidder Union. The
room number will be available
at the information desk.
The purpose of the meeting is
to familiarize Stanford women
with a petition that announces
the signer's complicity in dis
obeying the Selective Service
Act "along with the young men
who are refusing the draft."
According to Amy Newell, or
ganizer of the meeting, mem
bers of the Resistance will
speak to the women and explain
the petition to them. The state
ment is the same as one signed
by a group of faculty members
last spring.
Dorm Discussions
Miss Newell reports that after
Monday discussion groups will
be held in the dorms. She en
courages all women interested
in the Resistance, signing the
statement, or helping to organ
ize discussions to attend the
meeting.
The complicity statement will
be presented to the public some
time around Dec. 4, supporting
the second Resistance draft-card
protest. During the first demon
stration on October 16, more
than 1500 young men returned
their draft cards to the govern
ment.
The signers of the petition
will be women who "stand with

those young men who in the
American tradition of civil dis
obedience refuse to submit to an
unconscionable military draft."
Miss Newell stressed the impor
tance of women realizing the
consequence of a possible jail
sentence before they sign, for
signing it would place a woman
in the same legal jeopardy as
the men who have returned
their cards.
"Women are not called upon
to fight the American govern
ment's immoral war," Miss
Newell said. "There is no equiv
alent action for them to take
and therefore it is difficult to
demonstrate their feelings about
it," she said, emphasiing that
"the moral issues involved are
relevant to us also."
"We're given such an easy
way out," she continued, "and
this is the only act we can per
form—an act of support."

Miss Newell reports that after
Monday discussion groups will
be held in the dorms. She en
courages all women interested
in the Resistance, signing the
statement, or helping to organ
ize discussions to attend the
meeting.
The complicity statement will
be presented to the public some
time around Dec. 4, supporting
the second Resistance draft-card
protest. During the first demon
stration on October 16, more
than 1500 young men returned
their draft cards to the govern
ment.
The signers of the petition
will be women who "stand with

those young men who in the
American tradition of civil dis
obedience refuse to submit to an
unconscionable military draft."
Miss Newell stressed the impor
tance of women realizing the
consequence of a possible jail
sentence before they sign, for
signing it would place a woman
in the same legal jeopardy as
the men who have returned
their cards.
"Women are not called upon
to fight the American govern
ment's immoral war," Miss
Newell said. "There is no equiv
alent action for them to take
and therefore it is difficult to
demonstrate their feelings about
it," she said, emphasiing that
"the moral issues involved are
relevant to us also."
"We're given such an easy
way out," she continued, "and
this is the only act we can per
form—an act of support."
