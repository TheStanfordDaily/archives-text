# Volcano Erupts
## 
### 
The summit crater of Kilauea
Volcano erupted yesterday on
the island of Hawaii, touching
off a display of lava fountains
that shot 200 feet into the air.
The eruption in Halemaumau,
which means House Of The
Fern, caused no danger to any
communities. The crater is about
30 miles from Hilo, the island's
largest city.
