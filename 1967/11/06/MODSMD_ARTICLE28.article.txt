Stanford has suggested estab
lishing a joint Brazilian-Ameri
can seminar on the problems of
urban development.
Raul Penne Firme, Professor
of Urban and Regional Planning
at the Federal University tof JRio
de Janeiro, envision holding the
seminar for six months in Bra
zil and six months at Stanford.
During his official visit to
Stanford's Department of Archi
tecture and Urban Development,
Prof. Penne Firme has received
favorable responses to his idea
from faculty members and stu
dents at Stanford and Berkeley.
He hopes the seminar might be

Seminar Plans
Prof. Penne Firme outlined his
plans for the seminar during a
recent interview in Grove House.
He is staying there with his
daughter Thereza who is a grad
uate student in Education and a
tutor at the Grove. He said,
'There is a great need to discuss
the common problems of urban
development facing Brazil and
the United States."
The first problem the profes
sor would examine involves pos
sible construction of a road be
tween San Francisco and Brazil.
He feels such a channel for tra
vel would open the way to co
operation between the United
States and all the countries of
South America.

Firme discussed include examin
ing the slums of Brazilian and

American cities, and working

and social problems in cities as
well as the problem of over-pop
ulation.
