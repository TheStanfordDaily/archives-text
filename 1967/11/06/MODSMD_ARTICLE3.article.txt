## Yale Adopts New Grading 
### TOM DAWSON 
The faculty of Yale University
last week voted to abolish nu
merical grading system on the
undergraduate level. In its place
they installed a modified pass
fail system. The New York
Times called the new plan "one
of the least restrictive grading
systems in higher education in
the United States."
However, some members of
the Stanford faculty questioned
whether the new system was,
in fact, very different from that
in effect at many other colleges,
including Stanford.
Professor Gabriel A. Almond,
Executive Head of Political Sci
ence said, "I don't think that it
(the Yale system) is very differ
ent from the one at Stanford. I
feel undue publicity may have
been given to a system that is
not in itself very unusual." Paul
S. Seaver, asst. professor of his
tory, expressed a similar view.
New Designations
The Yale plan replaces per
centage grading with a four
category plan. The designations
are honors, high pass, pass, and
fail.
David M. Potter, professor of

history at Stanford, said that he
feared that there might be "a
lack of margin in the new sys
tem." He cited the narrow dis
tinction between 'honors' and
'high pass'. No provision is
mado in the Yale plan for any
borderline cases. Professor Pot
ter said he felt the incorpora
tion of "pluses and minuses
might be to a student's advan
tage."
Professor William K e s s en,
chairman of the Yale College
Course of Study Committee,
said the plan "ought to lead to
more stress in graduate admis
sions on things like meaningful
letters of recommendation from
the faculty."
Tentative moves away from
what one educator called "the
excessive preoccupation with
number or letter grades" have
been made at various colleges in
recent years including Stanford.
Columbia and the University of
California at Santa Cruz.
While a radical departure
from the grading norm might
create problems of admission to
graduate schools with lesser
reputations than Yales, the be
lief is that such difficulties are

not likely to be encountered in
the case of high-prestige institu
tions. Since the draft has vir
tually moved out of the under
graduate level, it is not likely
that Yale's action will affect the
relationship of students to the
Selective Service System.
The Yale action will take ef

feet in January and last for five
years on an experimental basis.
The faculty vote in favor of the
measure was by an overwhelm
ing ten to one margin. Propo
nents of the system enacted at
Yale have predicted that it will
encourage the students to take
more of the difficult courses.

The faculty of Yale University
last week voted to abolish nu
merical grading system on the
undergraduate level. In its place
they installed a modified pass
fail system. The New York
Times called the new plan "one
of the least restrictive grading
systems in higher education in
the United States."
However, some members of
the Stanford faculty questioned
whether the new system was,
in fact, very different from that
in effect at many other colleges,
including Stanford.
Professor Gabriel A. Almond,
Executive Head of Political Sci
ence said, "I don't think that it
(the Yale system) is very differ
ent from the one at Stanford. I
feel undue publicity may have
been given to a system that is
not in itself very unusual." Paul
S. Seaver, asst. professor of his
tory, expressed a similar view.
New Designations
The Yale plan replaces per
centage grading with a four
category plan. The designations
are honors, high pass, pass, and
fail.
David M. Potter, professor of

history at Stanford, said that he
feared that there might be "a
lack of margin in the new sys
tem." He cited the narrow dis
tinction between 'honors' and
'high pass'. No provision is
mado in the Yale plan for any
borderline cases. Professor Pot
ter said he felt the incorpora
tion of "pluses and minuses
might be to a student's advan
tage."
Professor William K e s s en,
chairman of the Yale College
Course of Study Committee,
said the plan "ought to lead to
more stress in graduate admis
sions on things like meaningful
letters of recommendation from
the faculty."
Tentative moves away from
what one educator called "the
excessive preoccupation with
number or letter grades" have
been made at various colleges in
recent years including Stanford.
Columbia and the University of
California at Santa Cruz.
While a radical departure
from the grading norm might
create problems of admission to
graduate schools with lesser
reputations than Yales, the be
lief is that such difficulties are

not likely to be encountered in
the case of high-prestige institu
tions. Since the draft has vir
tually moved out of the under
graduate level, it is not likely
that Yale's action will affect the
relationship of students to the
Selective Service System.
The Yale action will take ef

feet in January and last for five
years on an experimental basis.
The faculty vote in favor of the
measure was by an overwhelm
ing ten to one margin. Propo
nents of the system enacted at
Yale have predicted that it will
encourage the students to take
more of the difficult courses.
