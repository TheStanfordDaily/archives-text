# Stanford Poloists Subdue USC, Long Beach
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford water poloists, riding
high on a rejuvenated fast break
and the accurate arms of Gary
Sheerer and John Parker,
knocked off USC 11-8 and
downed touted Long Beach State
15-9 at Stanford last weekend.
Stanford now needs victories
over San Jose State and Cal this
weekend on the Farm to cement
the nation's number two rank
ing.
The Cards drove to a 6-2 half
time lead over USC, and
stretched it to 10-5 before the
last quarter.
Settle The Issue
USC and Stanford fought
through four overtime periods
before Stanford won 9-8 in sud
den death in the Trojans pool

two weeks ago. All the Cards
could hit in Los Angeles was
red lights.
Sheerer scored four times last
weekend against Southern Cal.
Parker, Mark Parmely, and Luis
Nicolao hit two each, and Greg
Buckingham put in one. Indian
goalie Bob Momsen was on the
beam, blocking 9 of the 14 shots
hurled at him.
USC's Bill Johnson, a member
of the US Pan Am team, hit
four of the Trojan's goals.
Cards Nail Long Beach
The game against Long Beach
started out the same, but the
Cards didn't stop at 11 goals.
Parker could do no wrong, hit
ting three goals in the first pe
riod, including a 15 yarder to
open the game.

The Cards marched to a 7-2
halftime advantage, and kept up
the scoring pace through the
second hall.
Seven Indians made it into
the scoring column. Sheerer
jammed in five and passed two
assists. Parker hit 4 out of 6 at
tempts. Parmely scored twice
and chucked the set-up passes
for three more scores. Tom Hill,
Ken Hammer, Jeff Hammett,
and Pete Siebert hit one each.
Momsen made 12 saves, hold
ing Olympian Bob Saari to one
goal.
Hatchet Game
The game sot progressively
rougher as Long Beach drifted
further behind. Three men were
kicked out for major fouls, two
from Long Beach.
Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran
abandoned Stanford's holeÂ«post
offense after the Cards could not

get moving against UCLA and
USC two weeks ago. The Indian
offense is a fast breaking drive
which features a series of men
blasting down the middle court
and then swinging off to the
wings until one man can get a
yard advantage.
The Cards' NCAA champion
swimming speed netted the In
dians an open man a number of
times last weekend, and Stan
ford capitalized.
Froeh Beat Await
The Stanford frosh beat Await
High School, 6-3, Friday after
noon. Mitch Ivey and Brian Put
nam sparked the Papoose of
fense that zoomed to a 5-0 lead
by the third period.
Await, the alma mater of one
third of the US Pan Am team,
boasts another great one on the
way up. Junior goalie Kevin
Craig made an incredible 21
saves in the game.
