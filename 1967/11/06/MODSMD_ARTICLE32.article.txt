# The 						Rattle Is Half The Battle
## Poloists' Wit Cuts Foe 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Water polo is technically a
non-contact sport; but when
three-fourths of the action is
underwater, it's not too sur
prising that non-contact is non
existent.
While physical retaliation is
gratifying, it also stands one
a good chance of getting kicked
out of the game. Polo players
have developed a more effective
weapon, the RATTLE. The Rat
tle is a verbal phenomenon (no
matter how abrubtly the pitch
of one's voice has changed in
the last few minutes of play).
Like, Kill Stanford
Long Beach State charged out
of the Encina Gym last Satur
day gleefully muttering some
thing psychologically devastat
ing like "Kill Stanford."
Stanford's starting lineup
yawned ostensibly as the 49'ers
took off their blue tennies and
hit the water for a game billed
as a playoff for the nation's
number two ranking.
Greg Buckingham took the
sprint for Stanford; the Indians
controlled for half a minute.
John Parker reared back behind
the half court line apparently
to chuck a wing pass . . . the
Long Beach goalie woke up to
the sudden flat thwock of rub
ber against the canvas behind
him.
Gary Sheerer then enlight
ened the Tribe to the fact that
"Goalie's a sieve."
Goalie replied wittily, "You're
a sphincter." Without euphemy.
His feelings cut to the quick,
Sheerer proceeded to score 5

goals and toss two assists in the
15-9 Stanford victory.
Long Beach later In the game
was awarded a penalty shotâ€” a
blast from 4 yards away with
only the goalie between the
shooter and ten feet of goal.
Sheerer instructed teammate
Doug Mac Lean to "Get ready
for the rebound. This guy's
really going to clutch."
The ref called, "Ball up," blew
his whistle, and the Indian
goalie Bob Momsen batted the
shot away. Sheerer grabbed the
rebound; but the ref called Mom
sen for lurching out too soon,
and gave Long Beach another
try.
Sheerer clutched both hands
around his throat, turned his
face purple, lolled his tongue
in the pool, and gasped to the
Long Beach man, "Say, how're
you going to shoot if you're
about to choke to death?"
Ball Up . ..
As the Long Beach man
turned away and tried to con
centrate on the upcoming shot,
Sheerer gave the command,
"Ball up."
Long Beach duly lifted the
ball ready for the whistle . . .
and brought the ball down with
a disgusted splash when he
realized the ref was tying his
shoe.
He missed the shot. Rattle,
rattle.
Meanwhile, back in the game,
Buckingham and Pete Siebert

were guarding Long Beach's
Big Gun, a 1964 Olympian. Gun
shows a decided preference to
sit in the hole and shoot the
glamor backhands. Gun scored
one, and flipped five more into
Momsen's awaiting arms.
Burn, Gun, Burn
When the ball changed hands,
the Cards' fast break left Gun
alone in the hole, giving Stan
ford a man advantage on of
fense (and a 7-2 half time lead).
While Gun was fighting for
position in front of the goal,
Mac Lean chirped from the
bench in the tradition of Doug
Jensen, "Man, you better shoot
as soon as you get the ball. You
better do something soon, 'cause
you are really getting burned."
Gun, while cordially inviting
Mac Lean to a post game sem
inar in social thought, ignored
the lact that a Long Beach pass
landed in front of him, and
Stanford charged off with the
ball "These things happen,
Bob."
Words obviously don't win
polo games, but they add an un
mistakeable flavor to competi
tion.
A good rattle leaves an ex
asperated antagonist completely
ridiculed. For example, a Stan
ford man who had just had his
nylon tank suit ripped in half
turned to the fingernailed de
filer and queried condescending
ly, "What do you want me to
do, cough?"
