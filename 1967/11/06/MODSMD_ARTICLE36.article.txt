# Fight Tribe Defense Upsets Huskies
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
For the last three weeks Stan
ford has beaten teams up and
down the football field, but
without a victory. Saturday in
Seattle, the Indians made an up
set register on the scoreboard,
defeating the University of
Washington, 14-7.
52,000 spectators saw the
Huskies, 10 point favorites,
beaten at their own game, de
fense; and the defeat was in
part administered by two Wash
ington state products, now sen
iors at Stanford.
Name co-receipients of the
Lineman-of-the-Game honor, An
dy Carrigan and Tom Hazelrigg
made or assisted in 34 tackles
during the game.
Local Boys Make Good
Carrigan, from Orting, Wash
ington, made 16 tackles in the
first half, and had six in a row
at one stretch. Playing his first
entire game since the start of
the season, Carrigan gave the
linebacking corps the authority
that bottled up the vaunted
Washington option play.
Hazelrigg made the bulk of
his stops in the crucial second
half.
Hazelrigg, from Olympia,
Washington, listed among his
day's achievements the tackle
that stopped the last Husky
drive of the day on the five
yard line, several tackles in the
closing minutes of play, and a
blocked field goal that would
have put the Huskies in the lead
in the third quarter.
Williams' Throws 2 TD's
Stanford's two touchdowns
came on TD passes from Chuck
Williams, unanimously named
the Back-of-the-Game.
The first was of the "bomb"
variety, with Williams hitting
his favorite target, Gene Wash
ington.
With first-and-ten on the Stan
ford 43, Williams threw a strike
to Washington, who was three
steps ahead of the nearest de
fender when he caught the ball.
Bill Shoemaker booted the
extra point and kicked off to
Washington's Gerald Wea.
One Husky Standout
Wea, who was the only con
sistent Husky performer of the
day, almost tied it up with this
kickoff return, going 34 yards

before being brought down by
Greg Beale.
Washington was at the Stan
ford 24 and threatening when
Dick Oliver intercepted a Tom
Manke aerial and returned it
45 yards.
Stanford could not capitalize
on the break and returned the
ball to Washington 4 plays later.
Washington Scores
Two plays netted the Huskies
minus one yard; but then on a
keeper, QB Manke broke over
right tackle and romped 81
yards for a score.
Deep backs Renwick and Tom
Massey had the final shot at
Manke, but knocked each other
down before touching the her
alded sophomore quarterback.
At the end of the second quar-

ter, the Huskies were back in
the game at 7-7.
Indians Take Over
Washington then had its first
real drive of the game and
ended up in a fourth and one sit
uation on the Stanford 29.
Rather than try for a field
goal, Manke elected to pass.
Hazelrigg forced a quick toss to
Jeff Huget, who was hit as he
dove for the ball; the pass fell
incomplete.
Both teams made determined
drives as the quarter drew to a
close, but both drives stalled.
Stanford came out to win in
the second half and almost got
an onside kick to start it off.
After the game Stanford Coach
John Ralston explained that the
attempt was decided on at half
time.
At Halftime
"I suggested the attempt to
the team, and they almost blew
the roof of the locker room off.

We were going to carry it to
them in the second half."
Though they got the ball, the
Huskies' ensuing drive was halt
ed by a fourth down situation
on the Stanford 31.
This time Washington went
for the three-pointer; the at
tempt was blocked by Tom
Hazelrigg.
Washington Coach Jim
Owens, victor over Stanford in
every game since 1958, later
commented that this series of
downs was the game's turning
point in many ways.
The Turning Point
The blocked kick actually
stopped the drive; but the on
side kick, though a failure,
"seemed to fire up the Stanford
squad," Owens said.
The Indians received the ball
on their own 45 after the
blocked kick and marched 55
yards in 11 plays to go into the
lead.
The scoring play was a five
yard Williams to Jim Cross pass
on the same look-in type

of pass Williams used so effec
tively against Washington State.
Washington's offense after
this was virtually Impotent. The
Huskies gained only 31 net
yards in the second half.
Another Interception?
Marty Brill and Blaine Nye
stopped the next few ground
attempts; and when Manke
again took to the air, Donn Ren
wick was there for an inter
ception.

The final Husky offensive
effort came at the beginning of
the fourth quarter. In Stanford
territory, Chuck Williams threw
for Bruce Cass, but the ball was
deflected into the hands of
Husky George Jugum.
Jugum headed down the side
line and Williams, GO pounds
lighter than Jugum, had the last
chance at him. A body block
put Jugum out of bounds, and
the Stanford defense then put

the clincher on their finest "en
tile game" of the season.
With fourth and six inches,
Hazelrigg made the tackle on
Manke that really stopped it.
Winding It Up
Stanford kept the ball mov
ing long enough during the re
mainder of the quarter to keep
the ball out of Washington scor
ing range.
On one play, Jack Root,

whose father is Dean of Men
at Washington, broke his own
high jump record for the year
with a leap that got Stanford
a first down and used valuable
time.
Offensively, Stanford lagged
behind the Huskies at the end
of the first half, though leading
at the game's conclusion.
But the name of the game
was defense, anu the Indians
were at their season's finest.

yards and had two TD aerials on Saturday. During the game, however, Williams suffered a sprained
knee and Is a questionable starter for next week's game with Oregon.

Hazelrigg made the tackle on
Manke that really stopped it.
Winding It Up
Stanford kept the ball mov
ing long enough during the re
mainder of the quarter to keep
the ball out of Washington scor
ing range.
On one play, Jack Root,

whose father is Dean of Men
at Washington, broke his own
high jump record for the year
with a leap that got Stanford
a first down and used valuable
time.
Offensively, Stanford lagged
behind the Huskies at the end
of the first half, though leading
at the game's conclusion.
But the name of the game
was defense, anu the Indians
were at their season's finest.

IT'S IN THE AIR: Stanford quarterback Chuck Williams (11) has just released the ball and it's
heading straight for his favorite receiver, Gene Washington (18). Williams threw for a total of 108
yards and had two TD aerials on Saturday. During the game, however, Williams suffered a sprained
knee and Is a questionable starter for next week's game with Oregon.
For the last three weeks Stan
ford has beaten teams up and
down the football field, but
without a victory. Saturday in
Seattle, the Indians made an up
set register on the scoreboard,
defeating the University of
Washington, 14-7.
52,000 spectators saw the
Huskies, 10 point favorites,
beaten at their own game, de
fense; and the defeat was in
part administered by two Wash
ington state products, now sen
iors at Stanford.
Name co-receipients of the
Lineman-of-the-Game honor, An
dy Carrigan and Tom Hazelrigg
made or assisted in 34 tackles
during the game.
Local Boys Make Good
Carrigan, from Orting, Wash
ington, made 16 tackles in the
first half, and had six in a row
at one stretch. Playing his first
entire game since the start of
the season, Carrigan gave the
linebacking corps the authority
that bottled up the vaunted
Washington option play.
Hazelrigg made the bulk of
his stops in the crucial second
half.
Hazelrigg, from Olympia,
Washington, listed among his
day's achievements the tackle
that stopped the last Husky
drive of the day on the five
yard line, several tackles in the
closing minutes of play, and a
blocked field goal that would
have put the Huskies in the lead
in the third quarter.
Williams' Throws 2 TD's
Stanford's two touchdowns
came on TD passes from Chuck
Williams, unanimously named
the Back-of-the-Game.
The first was of the "bomb"
variety, with Williams hitting
his favorite target, Gene Wash
ington.
With first-and-ten on the Stan
ford 43, Williams threw a strike
to Washington, who was three
steps ahead of the nearest de
fender when he caught the ball.
Bill Shoemaker booted the
extra point and kicked off to
Washington's Gerald Wea.
One Husky Standout
Wea, who was the only con
sistent Husky performer of the
day, almost tied it up with this
kickoff return, going 34 yards

before being brought down by
Greg Beale.
Washington was at the Stan
ford 24 and threatening when
Dick Oliver intercepted a Tom
Manke aerial and returned it
45 yards.
Stanford could not capitalize
on the break and returned the
ball to Washington 4 plays later.
Washington Scores
Two plays netted the Huskies
minus one yard; but then on a
keeper, QB Manke broke over
right tackle and romped 81
yards for a score.
Deep backs Renwick and Tom
Massey had the final shot at
Manke, but knocked each other
down before touching the her
alded sophomore quarterback.
At the end of the second quar-

ter, the Huskies were back in
the game at 7-7.
Indians Take Over
Washington then had its first
real drive of the game and
ended up in a fourth and one sit
uation on the Stanford 29.
Rather than try for a field
goal, Manke elected to pass.
Hazelrigg forced a quick toss to
Jeff Huget, who was hit as he
dove for the ball; the pass fell
incomplete.
Both teams made determined
drives as the quarter drew to a
close, but both drives stalled.
Stanford came out to win in
the second half and almost got
an onside kick to start it off.
After the game Stanford Coach
John Ralston explained that the
attempt was decided on at half
time.
At Halftime
"I suggested the attempt to
the team, and they almost blew
the roof of the locker room off.

We were going to carry it to
them in the second half."
Though they got the ball, the
Huskies' ensuing drive was halt
ed by a fourth down situation
on the Stanford 31.
This time Washington went
for the three-pointer; the at
tempt was blocked by Tom
Hazelrigg.
Washington Coach Jim
Owens, victor over Stanford in
every game since 1958, later
commented that this series of
downs was the game's turning
point in many ways.
The Turning Point
The blocked kick actually
stopped the drive; but the on
side kick, though a failure,
"seemed to fire up the Stanford
squad," Owens said.
The Indians received the ball
on their own 45 after the
blocked kick and marched 55
yards in 11 plays to go into the
lead.
The scoring play was a five
yard Williams to Jim Cross pass
on the same look-in type

of pass Williams used so effec
tively against Washington State.
Washington's offense after
this was virtually Impotent. The
Huskies gained only 31 net
yards in the second half.
Another Interception?
Marty Brill and Blaine Nye
stopped the next few ground
attempts; and when Manke
again took to the air, Donn Ren
wick was there for an inter
ception.

The final Husky offensive
effort came at the beginning of
the fourth quarter. In Stanford
territory, Chuck Williams threw
for Bruce Cass, but the ball was
deflected into the hands of
Husky George Jugum.
Jugum headed down the side
line and Williams, GO pounds
lighter than Jugum, had the last
chance at him. A body block
put Jugum out of bounds, and
the Stanford defense then put

the clincher on their finest "en
tile game" of the season.
With fourth and six inches,
Hazelrigg made the tackle on
Manke that really stopped it.

lead.
The scoring play was a five
yard Williams to Jim Cross pass
on the same look-in type

of pass Williams used so effec
tively against Washington State.
Washington's offense after
this was virtually Impotent. The
Huskies gained only 31 net
yards in the second half.
Another Interception?
Marty Brill and Blaine Nye
stopped the next few ground
attempts; and when Manke
again took to the air, Donn Ren
wick was there for an inter
ception.

The final Husky offensive
effort came at the beginning of
the fourth quarter. In Stanford
territory, Chuck Williams threw
for Bruce Cass, but the ball was
deflected into the hands of
Husky George Jugum.
Jugum headed down the side
line and Williams, GO pounds
lighter than Jugum, had the last
chance at him. A body block
put Jugum out of bounds, and
the Stanford defense then put

the clincher on their finest "en
tile game" of the season.
With fourth and six inches,
Hazelrigg made the tackle on
Manke that really stopped it.
Winding It Up
Stanford kept the ball mov
ing long enough during the re
mainder of the quarter to keep
the ball out of Washington scor
ing range.
On one play, Jack Root,

whose father is Dean of Men
at Washington, broke his own
high jump record for the year
with a leap that got Stanford
a first down and used valuable
time.
Offensively, Stanford lagged
behind the Huskies at the end
of the first half, though leading
at the game's conclusion.
But the name of the game
was defense, anu the Indians
were at their season's finest.

IT'S IN THE AIR: Stanford quarterback Chuck Williams (11) has just released the ball and it's
heading straight for his favorite receiver, Gene Washington (18). Williams threw for a total of 108
yards and had two TD aerials on Saturday. During the game, however, Williams suffered a sprained
knee and Is a questionable starter for next week's game with Oregon.
For the last three weeks Stan
ford has beaten teams up and
down the football field, but
without a victory. Saturday in
Seattle, the Indians made an up
set register on the scoreboard,
defeating the University of
Washington, 14-7.
52,000 spectators saw the
Huskies, 10 point favorites,
beaten at their own game, de
fense; and the defeat was in
part administered by two Wash
ington state products, now sen
iors at Stanford.
Name co-receipients of the
Lineman-of-the-Game honor, An
dy Carrigan and Tom Hazelrigg
made or assisted in 34 tackles
during the game.
Local Boys Make Good
Carrigan, from Orting, Wash
ington, made 16 tackles in the
first half, and had six in a row
at one stretch. Playing his first
entire game since the start of
the season, Carrigan gave the
linebacking corps the authority
that bottled up the vaunted
Washington option play.
Hazelrigg made the bulk of
his stops in the crucial second
half.
Hazelrigg, from Olympia,
Washington, listed among his
day's achievements the tackle
that stopped the last Husky
drive of the day on the five
yard line, several tackles in the
closing minutes of play, and a
blocked field goal that would
have put the Huskies in the lead
in the third quarter.
Williams' Throws 2 TD's
Stanford's two touchdowns
came on TD passes from Chuck
Williams, unanimously named
the Back-of-the-Game.
The first was of the "bomb"
variety, with Williams hitting
his favorite target, Gene Wash
ington.
With first-and-ten on the Stan
ford 43, Williams threw a strike
to Washington, who was three
steps ahead of the nearest de
fender when he caught the ball.
Bill Shoemaker booted the
extra point and kicked off to
Washington's Gerald Wea.
One Husky Standout
Wea, who was the only con
sistent Husky performer of the
day, almost tied it up with this
kickoff return, going 34 yards

before being brought down by
Greg Beale.
Washington was at the Stan
ford 24 and threatening when
Dick Oliver intercepted a Tom
Manke aerial and returned it
45 yards.
Stanford could not capitalize
on the break and returned the
ball to Washington 4 plays later.
Washington Scores
Two plays netted the Huskies
minus one yard; but then on a
keeper, QB Manke broke over
right tackle and romped 81
yards for a score.
Deep backs Renwick and Tom
Massey had the final shot at
Manke, but knocked each other
down before touching the her
alded sophomore quarterback.
At the end of the second quar-

ter, the Huskies were back in
the game at 7-7.
Indians Take Over
Washington then had its first
real drive of the game and
ended up in a fourth and one sit
uation on the Stanford 29.
Rather than try for a field
goal, Manke elected to pass.
Hazelrigg forced a quick toss to
Jeff Huget, who was hit as he
dove for the ball; the pass fell
incomplete.
Both teams made determined
drives as the quarter drew to a
close, but both drives stalled.
Stanford came out to win in
the second half and almost got
an onside kick to start it off.
After the game Stanford Coach
John Ralston explained that the
attempt was decided on at half
time.
At Halftime
"I suggested the attempt to
the team, and they almost blew
the roof of the locker room off.

We were going to carry it to
them in the second half."
Though they got the ball, the
Huskies' ensuing drive was halt
ed by a fourth down situation
on the Stanford 31.
This time Washington went
for the three-pointer; the at
tempt was blocked by Tom
Hazelrigg.
Washington Coach Jim
Owens, victor over Stanford in
every game since 1958, later
commented that this series of
downs was the game's turning
point in many ways.
The Turning Point
The blocked kick actually
stopped the drive; but the on
side kick, though a failure,
"seemed to fire up the Stanford
squad," Owens said.
The Indians received the ball
on their own 45 after the
blocked kick and marched 55
yards in 11 plays to go into the
lead.

After the game Stanford Coach
John Ralston explained that the
attempt was decided on at half
time.
At Halftime
"I suggested the attempt to
the team, and they almost blew
the roof of the locker room off.

We were going to carry it to
them in the second half."
Though they got the ball, the
Huskies' ensuing drive was halt
ed by a fourth down situation
on the Stanford 31.
This time Washington went
for the three-pointer; the at
tempt was blocked by Tom
Hazelrigg.
Washington Coach Jim
Owens, victor over Stanford in
every game since 1958, later
commented that this series of
downs was the game's turning
point in many ways.
The Turning Point
The blocked kick actually
stopped the drive; but the on
side kick, though a failure,
"seemed to fire up the Stanford
squad," Owens said.
The Indians received the ball
on their own 45 after the
blocked kick and marched 55
yards in 11 plays to go into the
lead.
The scoring play was a five
yard Williams to Jim Cross pass
on the same look-in type

of pass Williams used so effec
tively against Washington State.
Washington's offense after
this was virtually Impotent. The
Huskies gained only 31 net
yards in the second half.
Another Interception?
Marty Brill and Blaine Nye
stopped the next few ground
attempts; and when Manke
again took to the air, Donn Ren
wick was there for an inter
ception.

The final Husky offensive
effort came at the beginning of
the fourth quarter. In Stanford
territory, Chuck Williams threw
for Bruce Cass, but the ball was
deflected into the hands of
Husky George Jugum.
Jugum headed down the side
line and Williams, GO pounds
lighter than Jugum, had the last
chance at him. A body block
put Jugum out of bounds, and
the Stanford defense then put

the clincher on their finest "en
tile game" of the season.
With fourth and six inches,
Hazelrigg made the tackle on
Manke that really stopped it.
Winding It Up
Stanford kept the ball mov
ing long enough during the re
mainder of the quarter to keep
the ball out of Washington scor
ing range.
On one play, Jack Root,

whose father is Dean of Men
at Washington, broke his own
high jump record for the year
with a leap that got Stanford
a first down and used valuable
time.
Offensively, Stanford lagged
behind the Huskies at the end
of the first half, though leading
at the game's conclusion.
But the name of the game
was defense, anu the Indians
were at their season's finest.

IT'S IN THE AIR: Stanford quarterback Chuck Williams (11) has just released the ball and it's
heading straight for his favorite receiver, Gene Washington (18). Williams threw for a total of 108
yards and had two TD aerials on Saturday. During the game, however, Williams suffered a sprained
knee and Is a questionable starter for next week's game with Oregon.
For the last three weeks Stan
ford has beaten teams up and
down the football field, but
without a victory. Saturday in
Seattle, the Indians made an up
set register on the scoreboard,
defeating the University of
Washington, 14-7.
52,000 spectators saw the
Huskies, 10 point favorites,
beaten at their own game, de
fense; and the defeat was in
part administered by two Wash
ington state products, now sen
iors at Stanford.
Name co-receipients of the
Lineman-of-the-Game honor, An
dy Carrigan and Tom Hazelrigg
made or assisted in 34 tackles
during the game.
Local Boys Make Good
Carrigan, from Orting, Wash
ington, made 16 tackles in the
first half, and had six in a row
at one stretch. Playing his first
entire game since the start of
the season, Carrigan gave the
linebacking corps the authority
that bottled up the vaunted
Washington option play.
Hazelrigg made the bulk of
his stops in the crucial second
half.
Hazelrigg, from Olympia,
Washington, listed among his
day's achievements the tackle
that stopped the last Husky
drive of the day on the five
yard line, several tackles in the
closing minutes of play, and a
blocked field goal that would
have put the Huskies in the lead
in the third quarter.
Williams' Throws 2 TD's
Stanford's two touchdowns
came on TD passes from Chuck
Williams, unanimously named
the Back-of-the-Game.
The first was of the "bomb"
variety, with Williams hitting
his favorite target, Gene Wash
ington.
With first-and-ten on the Stan
ford 43, Williams threw a strike
to Washington, who was three
steps ahead of the nearest de
fender when he caught the ball.
Bill Shoemaker booted the
extra point and kicked off to
Washington's Gerald Wea.
One Husky Standout
Wea, who was the only con
sistent Husky performer of the
day, almost tied it up with this
kickoff return, going 34 yards

before being brought down by
Greg Beale.
Washington was at the Stan
ford 24 and threatening when
Dick Oliver intercepted a Tom
Manke aerial and returned it
45 yards.
Stanford could not capitalize
on the break and returned the
ball to Washington 4 plays later.
Washington Scores
Two plays netted the Huskies
minus one yard; but then on a
keeper, QB Manke broke over
right tackle and romped 81
yards for a score.
Deep backs Renwick and Tom
Massey had the final shot at
Manke, but knocked each other
down before touching the her
alded sophomore quarterback.
At the end of the second quar-

ter, the Huskies were back in
the game at 7-7.
Indians Take Over
Washington then had its first
real drive of the game and
ended up in a fourth and one sit
uation on the Stanford 29.
Rather than try for a field
goal, Manke elected to pass.
Hazelrigg forced a quick toss to
Jeff Huget, who was hit as he
dove for the ball; the pass fell
incomplete.
Both teams made determined
drives as the quarter drew to a
close, but both drives stalled.
Stanford came out to win in
the second half and almost got
an onside kick to start it off.
