# Discuss Vietnam, Congress
## McCloskey Will Speak 
### 
Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey,
candidate for Congress in the
11th District, will speak on Viet
nam and the Congressional race
this afternoon in the law school
courtyard. He will talk both for
mally and informally between
3:30 and 5:30 p.m.
A liberal Republican and grad
uate of both Stanford and Stan
ford Law School, McCloskey has
emerged from political obscurity
to seek the seat vacated by the
death of Rep. J. Arthur Young
er. His Republican opposition in
the November 14 primary con
sists of "hawks" and "owls,"
most notable of whom is Shirley
Temple Black. Recent polls show
McCloskey sharing the lead
with Mrs. Black.
"The most urgent issue of the
present time is the conflict in
Vietnam and the position regard
ing such conflict which Congress
must take in future months,"
states McCloskey. The twice
decorated Korean war veteran
has made the Vietnam war a
prime campaign issue. He at
tacks the "Win the War" posi
tions of his Republican oppo
nents saying that "a military
victory would determine nothing
except that we would thereafter
be committed to years of con
tinuing guerrilla warfare."
McCloskey's alternative to the

voters of San Mateo county in
cludes advocacy of de-escalation
and support of Vietnam's reuni
fication by negotiations. Such re
unification, he admits, will prob
ably result in a communist gov
ernment. If the administration
does not make meaningful at
tempts to bring the opposition to
the negotiating table, McCloskey
has said that he will call in Con
gress for a gradual disengage
ment of American forces "in a
period not to exceed two years"
and for an offer of refuge for
those South Vietnamese fearing
retribution.
Two of McCloskey's goals in
the campaign are to help change
the face of the conservative Cali
fornia Republican party and to
show potential candidates
throughout the country that
they can express their anti-war
beliefs and win in 1968. His
victory, he feels, could not be
disregarded by leaders of either
party.
McCloskey's support comes
from both Republicans and
Democrats, according to law stu
dent Paul Leach, an organizer
of Stanford Volunteers for Mc-
Closkey. "In this traditionally
Republican county," said Leach,
"many conscientious Democrats
are crossing party lines to help

pick the most capable Republi
can."
At this afternoon's meeting,
Stanford Volunteers for McClos
key will seek volunteers both
for a "blitz" campaign effort on
the weekend of November 11
and 12 and for help on election
day. Signup tables will also be
in White Plaza through Wednes
day.


PAUL. N. McCLOSKEY
