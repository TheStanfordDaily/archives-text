# German To Review Exchange Program
## 
### 
Ruddiger Struck, a 23-year-old
German student who lives at
SAE house, will speak this eve
ning at 7:30 in Tresidder Room
275 on the Free University of
Berlin exchange program which
brought him to Stanford.
Applications are available at
the International Center until
Nov. 14 for the competition for
the one scholarship which will
provide a year's study for a
Stanford undergraduate who has
a working knowledge of Ger
man.
Unlike Stanford's own foreign
campus programs, this exchange
totally immerses the student in
the other nation's culture. He
will live in a German home and
attend German classes with stu
dents at the Free University.
Tuition expenses are paid and a

living stipend provided.
The exchange is administered
completely by students, and
sponsored by the Institute of In
ternational Relations. Robert
Robertson, a senior psychology
student, is Stanford's present ex
change student.
At the meeting tonight Struck
will discuss the political climate
in Berlin and show slides of the
picturesque sights in Berlin,
such as the fortified, guarded
wall between the east and west
sectors.
