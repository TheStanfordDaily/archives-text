# SES To Seek Reactions At TMU 'Town Meeting'
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A "town meeting" tomorrow
open to all students and faculty
will be the next forum used by
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) to get reactions to
the position paper on undergrad
uate education issued a week
ago.
The meeting, in Tresidder
Union's large lounge at 4:10
p.m., was organized by the stu
dent-run Tresidder Union Board.
Gloria Strauss, a member, will
preside as Herbert Packer and
other members of the SES steer
ing committee answer questions
and hear suggestions from the
floor.
Packer, vice-provost and chair
man of the SES steering commit
tee, hopes to "get some views of
what students think of the
paper."
And a member of the Tresid
der Union Board said the meet
ing will be "a chance to tell
Packer what we want."
Criticizes Curriculum
The position paper, "Toward
a More Flexible Undergraduate
Education," criticized many exist
ing curriculum requirements and
proposed more independent hon
ors work. It redefined undergra
duate education at Stanford as
a "time for more general intel
lectual and personal growth" be
tween high school and specializ
ed graduate work.
The SES mandate from Presi
dent Wallace Sterling is to re

evaluate all aspects of Stanford's
educational policy. The policies
laid out in the position paper, al
though tentative, could change
undergraduate education here
within two years.
The report has been critcized
by some administrators and fac
ulty as neglecting the special in
terests of individual depart
ments. On the other hand, stu
dents have blasted the report for
preserving the "existing struc
ture" of classes, units and
grades. Peter Lyman, ASSU
president, asserted SES "adopt
ed the liberal rhetoric of educa
tional reform but didn't get into
the fundamental questions."
Copies Available
Dissemination of the 5,000
word position paper has been the
first problem of the nine-member
steering committee that wrote

it. Copies will be available at
the "town meeting" tomorrow,
and the text was mailed to all
faculty members Friday.
More feedback on the position
paper will be requested in a let
ter tomorrow to all campus liv
ing groups. It contains a list of
seven detailed questions on the
report, with a covering letter
from Packer asking that "your
group set aside all or part of a
meeting to give consideration to
these proposals on undergradu
ate education.
"We hope that a discussion
of the propositions set forth will
generate responses which you
will submit in writing to the
SES."
A "briefing session" for resi
dence leaders is scheduled Nov.
13 to discuss the plan for direct


HERBERT PACKER heads
the study of Education at
Stanford.
