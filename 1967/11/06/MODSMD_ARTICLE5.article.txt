# SES To Seek Reactions At TMU 'Town Meeting'
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A "town meeting" tomorrow
open to all students and faculty
will be the next forum used by
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) to get reactions to
the position paper on undergrad
uate education issued a week
ago.
The meeting, in Tresidder
Union's large lounge at 4:10
p.m., was organized by the stu
dent-run Tresidder Union Board.
Gloria Strauss, a member, will
preside as Herbert Packer and
other members of the SES steer
ing committee answer questions
and hear suggestions from the
floor.
Packer, vice-provost and chair
man of the SES steering commit
tee, hopes to "get some views of
what students think of the
paper."
And a member of the Tresid
der Union Board said the meet
ing will be "a chance to tell
Packer what we want."
Criticizes Curriculum
The position paper, "Toward
a More Flexible Undergraduate
Education," criticized many exist
ing curriculum requirements and
proposed more independent hon
ors work. It redefined undergra
duate education at Stanford as
a "time for more general intel
lectual and personal growth" be
tween high school and specializ
ed graduate work.
The SES mandate from Presi
dent Wallace Sterling is to re

evaluate all aspects of Stanford's
educational policy. The policies
laid out in the position paper, al
though tentative, could change
undergraduate education here
within two years.
The report has been critcized
by some administrators and fac
ulty as neglecting the special in
terests of individual depart
ments. On the other hand, stu
dents have blasted the report for
preserving the "existing struc
ture" of classes, units and
grades. Peter Lyman, ASSU
president, asserted SES "adopt
ed the liberal rhetoric of educa
tional reform but didn't get into
the fundamental questions."

Dissemination of the 5,000
word position paper has been the
first problem of the nine-member
steering committee that wrote

it. Copies will be available at
the "town meeting" tomorrow,
and the text was mailed to all
faculty members Friday.
More feedback on the position
paper will be requested in a let
ter tomorrow to all campus liv
ing groups. It contains a list of
seven detailed questions on the
report, with a covering letter
from Packer asking that "your
group set aside all or part of a
meeting to give consideration to
these proposals on undergradu
ate education.
"We hope that a discussion
of the propositions set forth will
generate responses which you
will submit in writing to the
SES."
A "briefing session" for resi
dence leaders is scheduled Nov.

comments from students.
The questions for living
groups include:
"Do you agree with the stated
objectives of undergraduate edu
cation? Eliminating the math •
language course option as a
universal requirement?
"Do you agree with the pro
posed emphasis on independent
honors work?
"How do you feel about pro
posed experimental programs,
including particularly the experi
mental college?
"What is your reaction to per
mitting alternatives to the West
ern Civ course for those follow
ing the general studies pattern?
"What is your reaction to the
idea of changing all regular cour
ses to five units so that the nor
mal load is three courses per
quarter?"

The steering committee may
send representatives to some of
the living group meetings.
Letters Sent
Faculty reaction hasn't been
neglected by SES, either. In the
letter mailed Friday, the steer
ing committee invites "reaction
via memorandum" from all Aca
demic Council members.
Speaking softly to the teach
ers whose curriculum they may
change extensively, the steering
committee writes, "We attach
greater importance to the basic
approach than to the 'highly
tentative proposals for carrying
it out' . . . wt- seek your views
on the spirit rather than the let
ter."
And yet another mechanism
for evaluating the position paper
is the "student advisory commit
tee" to be formed by ASSU
President Peter Lyman. Packer,

who invited Lyman Monday to
form such a group to insure
graduate students and off-cam
pus undergraduates of a voice,
commented "the initiative with
that lies entirely with him."
Lyman is currently consider
ing appointees for such a com
mittee, according to an ASSU
officer.
Other SES ideas to "generate
widespread discussion and reac
tions which will guide further
deliberations in this area" in
clude a questionnaire to faculty
on specific issues.
The hurried action by the steer
ing committee to solicit student
and faculty opinion is explained
by a statement in the position
paper itself. The proposals are
"worth pursuing only if it has
the strong endorsement of a sub
stantial majority of the commu
nity," the paper states.

The questions for living

"Do you agree with the pro

"How do you feel about pro

"What is your reaction to per

"What is your reaction to the

The steering committee may

Faculty reaction hasn't been
neglected by SES, either. In the
letter mailed Friday, the steer
ing committee invites "reaction
via memorandum" from all Aca
demic Council members.
Speaking softly to the teach
ers whose curriculum they may
change extensively, the steering
committee writes, "We attach
greater importance to the basic
approach than to the 'highly
tentative proposals for carrying
it out' . . . wt- seek your views
on the spirit rather than the let
ter."
And yet another mechanism
for evaluating the position paper
is the "student advisory commit
tee" to be formed by ASSU
President Peter Lyman. Packer,

who invited Lyman Monday to
form such a group to insure
graduate students and off-cam
pus undergraduates of a voice,
commented "the initiative with
that lies entirely with him."
Lyman is currently consider
ing appointees for such a com
mittee, according to an ASSU
officer.

widespread discussion and reac
tions which will guide further
deliberations in this area" in
clude a questionnaire to faculty
on specific issues.
The hurried action by the steer
ing committee to solicit student
and faculty opinion is explained
by a statement in the position
paper itself. The proposals are
"worth pursuing only if it has
the strong endorsement of a sub
stantial majority of the commu
nity," the paper states.
A "town meeting" tomorrow
open to all students and faculty
will be the next forum used by
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) to get reactions to
the position paper on undergrad
uate education issued a week
ago.
The meeting, in Tresidder
Union's large lounge at 4:10
p.m., was organized by the stu
dent-run Tresidder Union Board.
Gloria Strauss, a member, will
preside as Herbert Packer and
other members of the SES steer
ing committee answer questions
and hear suggestions from the
floor.
Packer, vice-provost and chair
man of the SES steering commit
tee, hopes to "get some views of
what students think of the
paper."
And a member of the Tresid
der Union Board said the meet
ing will be "a chance to tell
Packer what we want."
Criticizes Curriculum
The position paper, "Toward
a More Flexible Undergraduate
Education," criticized many exist
ing curriculum requirements and
proposed more independent hon
ors work. It redefined undergra
duate education at Stanford as
a "time for more general intel
lectual and personal growth" be
tween high school and specializ
ed graduate work.
The SES mandate from Presi
dent Wallace Sterling is to re

evaluate all aspects of Stanford's
educational policy. The policies
laid out in the position paper, al
though tentative, could change
undergraduate education here
within two years.
The report has been critcized
by some administrators and fac
ulty as neglecting the special in
terests of individual depart
ments. On the other hand, stu
dents have blasted the report for
preserving the "existing struc
ture" of classes, units and
grades. Peter Lyman, ASSU
president, asserted SES "adopt
ed the liberal rhetoric of educa
tional reform but didn't get into
the fundamental questions."

mittee, according to an ASSU
officer.
Other SES ideas to "generate
widespread discussion and reac
tions which will guide further
deliberations in this area" in
clude a questionnaire to faculty
on specific issues.
The hurried action by the steer
ing committee to solicit student
and faculty opinion is explained
by a statement in the position
paper itself. The proposals are
"worth pursuing only if it has
the strong endorsement of a sub
stantial majority of the commu
nity," the paper states.
A "town meeting" tomorrow
open to all students and faculty
will be the next forum used by
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) to get reactions to
the position paper on undergrad
uate education issued a week
ago.
The meeting, in Tresidder
Union's large lounge at 4:10
p.m., was organized by the stu
dent-run Tresidder Union Board.
Gloria Strauss, a member, will
preside as Herbert Packer and
other members of the SES steer
ing committee answer questions
and hear suggestions from the
floor.
Packer, vice-provost and chair
man of the SES steering commit
tee, hopes to "get some views of
what students think of the
paper."
And a member of the Tresid
der Union Board said the meet
ing will be "a chance to tell
Packer what we want."
Criticizes Curriculum
The position paper, "Toward
a More Flexible Undergraduate
Education," criticized many exist
ing curriculum requirements and
proposed more independent hon
ors work. It redefined undergra
duate education at Stanford as
a "time for more general intel
lectual and personal growth" be
tween high school and specializ
ed graduate work.
The SES mandate from Presi
dent Wallace Sterling is to re

evaluate all aspects of Stanford's
educational policy. The policies
laid out in the position paper, al
though tentative, could change
undergraduate education here
within two years.
The report has been critcized
by some administrators and fac
ulty as neglecting the special in
terests of individual depart
ments. On the other hand, stu
dents have blasted the report for
preserving the "existing struc
ture" of classes, units and
grades. Peter Lyman, ASSU
president, asserted SES "adopt
ed the liberal rhetoric of educa
tional reform but didn't get into
the fundamental questions."

Dissemination of the 5,000
word position paper has been the
first problem of the nine-member
steering committee that wrote

it. Copies will be available at
the "town meeting" tomorrow,
and the text was mailed to all
faculty members Friday.
More feedback on the position
paper will be requested in a let
ter tomorrow to all campus liv
ing groups. It contains a list of
seven detailed questions on the
report, with a covering letter
from Packer asking that "your
group set aside all or part of a
meeting to give consideration to
these proposals on undergradu
ate education.
"We hope that a discussion
of the propositions set forth will
generate responses which you
will submit in writing to the
SES."
A "briefing session" for resi
dence leaders is scheduled Nov.

comments from students.
The questions for living
groups include:
"Do you agree with the stated
objectives of undergraduate edu
cation? Eliminating the math •
language course option as a
universal requirement?
"Do you agree with the pro
posed emphasis on independent
honors work?
"How do you feel about pro
posed experimental programs,
including particularly the experi
mental college?
"What is your reaction to per
mitting alternatives to the West
ern Civ course for those follow
ing the general studies pattern?
"What is your reaction to the
idea of changing all regular cour
ses to five units so that the nor
mal load is three courses per
quarter?"

The steering committee may
send representatives to some of
the living group meetings.
Letters Sent
Faculty reaction hasn't been
neglected by SES, either. In the
letter mailed Friday, the steer
ing committee invites "reaction
via memorandum" from all Aca
demic Council members.
Speaking softly to the teach
ers whose curriculum they may
change extensively, the steering
committee writes, "We attach
greater importance to the basic
approach than to the 'highly
tentative proposals for carrying
it out' . . . wt- seek your views
on the spirit rather than the let
ter."
And yet another mechanism
for evaluating the position paper
is the "student advisory commit
tee" to be formed by ASSU
President Peter Lyman. Packer,

who invited Lyman Monday to
form such a group to insure
graduate students and off-cam
pus undergraduates of a voice,
commented "the initiative with
that lies entirely with him."
