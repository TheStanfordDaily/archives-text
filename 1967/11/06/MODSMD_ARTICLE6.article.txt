A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS — In his sermon yesterday morning.
Dean of the Chapel, B. Davie Napier, called for "prophetic pro
test" He said, "It is a time for prophets. In prophetism it is also
very meet, right, and our bounden duty that we should at all times
and in all places declare and decry our national derailment, our
abandonment of vocation, our betrayal of hope and heritage. Hut
if protest is prophetic its ultimate aim is restoration, renewal *»nd
redemption. The prophet may In a figurative sense bum all kinds
of draft cards — or in a literal sense he may burn the one draft
card, his own, but he shatters the classical prophetic image of the
prophet if he burns his birth certificate ..."
Earlier he had said, "This country has reared me. It is this coun
try which has made possible my own fulfillment of true vocation.
Now I think, in certain particulars more than in others, its present
practices and policies stink — especially domestically in problems
relating to poverty and race; and abroad to her present astonishing
and to me totally repugnant posture of militant American Messiah.
But it is still my country . . . ami I am no more going to split with
it than I am with mv own son."
