# Red Hot Contest Promises Chaos At Polling Place
## 
### 
During most elections on cam
pus, stuffing the ballot box, buy
ing votes, bribing voters, cam
paigning at the polling place,
and destroying other candidates'
votes have been frowned upon.
In the Red Hot Prof. Contest,
however, chicanery is the guid
ing principle of the day.
The voting will be held at the
engineering corner on Monday
through Wednesday from 8:40
to 3:15 and on Thursday from
8:40 until 5.
Now any student, regardless
of age, race, or religion, can vote
and let the professors know who
is the most red hot. Literacy is
considered helpful, but there are
no voter competence tests. This
should be one election on cam
pus when apathy is not a prob
lem.
The winning professor will be
exempted from making an in
augural address. However, he
will be in the political spotlight
on Saturday when he must lead
a cheer at the football game
against Oregon.
There is a 25c fee to nominate,
1c to cast a positive vote, and
5c to cast a negative vote. There
is no charge for destroying other
candidates' votes. Voters are
urged to vote as often as pos
sible since the proceeds go to the
International Student Fund
Drive.
