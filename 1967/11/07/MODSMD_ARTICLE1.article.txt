# Groups Oppose Prop. P; Referendum Questioned
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Two ad-hoc committees have
rallied to defeat Stanford's own
version of Proposition P, but
their efforts may prove unneces
sary because the Vietnam war
referendum may not be held
after all.
Student opponents of the anti
war Proposition have purchased
a full-page advertisement in The
Daily today and blanketed the
campus with leaflets bearing
the plea, "Vote No on Proposi
tion P."
The Proposition was placed
on the ballot for Stanford's gen
eral autumn student elections
tomorrow and Thursday by the
Legislature at the meeting Nov.
2.
But it was learned last night
that the resolution proposing a
referendum on Proposition P
was introduced on the floor Nov.
2 by a student who is not a
member of the Legislature. This
technicality casts doubt on the
legality of the referendum. Leg
islature Speaker Michael Wein
stein said last night he will give
a ruling on the legality of the
student referendum today after
consulting other ASSU officials.
Leaflets Distributed
Opponents of the Proposition
purchased the advertisement on
page 5 of todya's Daily at a cost
of $300. Leaflets were distrib
uted at campus residences Sun
day and last night urging a "no"
vote in the Stanford refer
endum.
No organized campus group
has taken any action in support
of the Proposition in tomor
row's referendum.
Proposition P was to appear
on the student ballot as follows:
"Shall it be the policy of the
students of Stanford University
that there be an immediate
cease fire and withdrawal of
U.S. troops from Vietnam so
that the Vietnamese people can
settle their own problems?"
The original Proposition P
will be considered by voters to
day in San Francisco. The city

of Cambridge, Mass. will have a
similar referendum on a pro
posal that U.S. troops withdraw
from Vietnam.
On The Ballot
The bizarre story of how
Proposition P was placed on the
ballot by the Legislature un
folded last night. The motion to
put the controversial Proposi
tion up to a student referendum
was made by Dennis Hayes, a
22-year-old undergraduate who
lives at 2248 Euclid Avenue in
Palo Alto.
Hayes attended the meeting
as a spectator. He says he
started acting as a substitute
member on the basis of an oral
understanding with a fraternity
member who left the meeting
early.
Hayes' action violated ASSU
by-laws, according to Weinstein.
He pointed out that "We go by
the honor code at Legislature,"
not formally checking to see
that each student who votes is
a bona fide member.
The Legislature's overwhelm
ing approval of the Proposition
P referendum came late in the
evening when only 42 members
were still present, barely a
quorum.
Vigil Referendum
Hayes, proposed the referen
dum on Proopsition P after the
Legislature approved a refer
endum on the Memorial Church
"peace vigil" this coming Sat
urday.
Hayes admits he had "not
thought at all about making the
suggestion before I came to the
meeting."
If Proposition P does appear
on the ballot tomorrow, it will
be one of many decisions before
the student voters. As well as
the peace vigil resolution, all
registered students can vote for
a head yell leader to lead cheer
leading at athletic events begin
ning winter quarter.
In addition, off-campus under
graduates and graduate students
in the schools of engineering,
education and humanities and
sciences will elect their Legisla
ture representatives.

The determined publicity cam
paign to defeat Proposition P at
Stanford was undertaken before
the news broke that the referen
dum may be illegal.
Ad-hoc Committees
Two ad-hoc committees are be
hind the campaign to defeat the
Proposition. They are "Concern
ed Students for Responsible De
bate," and "Stanford Committee
for the Defeat of Proposition P."
The first distributed leaflets Sun
day and the second arranged to
day's advertisement and yester
day's leafleting.
About 30 students are work
ing on the two groups, which
have cooperated closely since
they were spontaneously formed
Friday.
"Proposition P calls for im
mediate withdrawal, without
provisions for negotiations or
gradual disengagement," the ad
vertisement states.
"The issue is not the Vietnam
War. The issue is irresponsible
diplomacy," it reads. The adver
tisement gives quotations from
Senator J. William Fulbright,
Edwin O. Reischauer, and Stan
ford Prof. Claude Buss. All the
quotations suggest negotiations
or oppose withdrawal.
Charge 'Emotionalism'
The students opposing Propo
sition P criticize it as an all-or
nothing policy based on "emo
tionalism."
"What we're especially con
cerned with is the polarization of
an issue in an academic commu
nity," according to Robert Walk
er, chairman of the Concerned
Students group. "My own view
point on the Vietnam war," he
said, "is that it is the kind of
issue which should be approach
ed with reason and not with a
black and white decision like
Proposition P."
Walker, a history graduate
student, is immediate past presi
dent of the Stanford Young Re
publicans (YR).
Charles Bell, chairman of the
committee which sponsored the
Daily advertisement, emphasized
that his opposition to the Prop
osition "doesn't mean I'm a hawk
on the war."

"I originally supported our
commitment in Vietnam but now
it has become a question of na
tional priorities."
Bell, president of Lambda Nu
fraternity and last year's head
of the Political Union, is trea
surer of the San Mateo County
YRs.
The opponents of Proposition
P hope that financial support
for their three-day campaign
will come from "a variety of
sources." But for the present,
the cost of the full-page adver
tisement came out of the pocket
of Brian Benson, a business
graduate student.
Like Bell and Walker, Benson
said he was "surprised" when
he learned that the Legislature
had approved a referendum on
Proposition P.
"My impression was that the
Proposition was thrown on the
ballot at the very end of the
meeting," Bell said.

K.APS CITY PROBLEMS â€” Paul McCloskey, liberal Republican candidate for San Mateo County Con
gTessman, spoke yesterday at the Law School. (For story, see page 8.)
Two ad-hoc committees have
rallied to defeat Stanford's own
version of Proposition P, but
their efforts may prove unneces
sary because the Vietnam war
referendum may not be held
after all.
Student opponents of the anti
war Proposition have purchased
a full-page advertisement in The
Daily today and blanketed the
campus with leaflets bearing
the plea, "Vote No on Proposi
tion P."
The Proposition was placed
on the ballot for Stanford's gen
eral autumn student elections
tomorrow and Thursday by the
Legislature at the meeting Nov.
2.
But it was learned last night
that the resolution proposing a
referendum on Proposition P
was introduced on the floor Nov.
2 by a student who is not a
member of the Legislature. This
technicality casts doubt on the
legality of the referendum. Leg
islature Speaker Michael Wein
stein said last night he will give
a ruling on the legality of the
student referendum today after
consulting other ASSU officials.
Leaflets Distributed
Opponents of the Proposition
purchased the advertisement on
page 5 of todya's Daily at a cost
of $300. Leaflets were distrib
uted at campus residences Sun
day and last night urging a "no"
vote in the Stanford refer
endum.
No organized campus group
has taken any action in support
of the Proposition in tomor
row's referendum.
Proposition P was to appear
on the student ballot as follows:
"Shall it be the policy of the
students of Stanford University
that there be an immediate
cease fire and withdrawal of
U.S. troops from Vietnam so
that the Vietnamese people can
settle their own problems?"
The original Proposition P
will be considered by voters to
day in San Francisco. The city

of Cambridge, Mass. will have a
similar referendum on a pro
posal that U.S. troops withdraw
from Vietnam.
On The Ballot
The bizarre story of how
Proposition P was placed on the
ballot by the Legislature un
folded last night. The motion to
put the controversial Proposi
tion up to a student referendum
was made by Dennis Hayes, a
22-year-old undergraduate who
lives at 2248 Euclid Avenue in
Palo Alto.
Hayes attended the meeting
as a spectator. He says he
started acting as a substitute
member on the basis of an oral
understanding with a fraternity
member who left the meeting
early.
Hayes' action violated ASSU
by-laws, according to Weinstein.
He pointed out that "We go by
the honor code at Legislature,"
not formally checking to see
that each student who votes is
a bona fide member.
The Legislature's overwhelm
ing approval of the Proposition
P referendum came late in the
evening when only 42 members
were still present, barely a
quorum.
Vigil Referendum
Hayes, proposed the referen
dum on Proopsition P after the
Legislature approved a refer
endum on the Memorial Church
"peace vigil" this coming Sat
urday.
Hayes admits he had "not
thought at all about making the
suggestion before I came to the
meeting."
If Proposition P does appear
on the ballot tomorrow, it will
be one of many decisions before
the student voters. As well as
the peace vigil resolution, all
registered students can vote for
a head yell leader to lead cheer
leading at athletic events begin
ning winter quarter.
In addition, off-campus under
graduates and graduate students
in the schools of engineering,
education and humanities and
sciences will elect their Legisla
ture representatives.

The determined publicity cam
paign to defeat Proposition P at
Stanford was undertaken before
the news broke that the referen
dum may be illegal.
Ad-hoc Committees
Two ad-hoc committees are be
hind the campaign to defeat the
Proposition. They are "Concern
ed Students for Responsible De
bate," and "Stanford Committee
for the Defeat of Proposition P."
The first distributed leaflets Sun
day and the second arranged to
day's advertisement and yester
day's leafleting.
About 30 students are work
ing on the two groups, which
have cooperated closely since
they were spontaneously formed
Friday.
"Proposition P calls for im
mediate withdrawal, without
provisions for negotiations or
gradual disengagement," the ad
vertisement states.
"The issue is not the Vietnam
War. The issue is irresponsible
diplomacy," it reads. The adver
tisement gives quotations from
Senator J. William Fulbright,
Edwin O. Reischauer, and Stan
ford Prof. Claude Buss. All the
quotations suggest negotiations
or oppose withdrawal.
Charge 'Emotionalism'
The students opposing Propo
sition P criticize it as an all-or
nothing policy based on "emo
tionalism."
"What we're especially con
cerned with is the polarization of
an issue in an academic commu
nity," according to Robert Walk
er, chairman of the Concerned
Students group. "My own view
point on the Vietnam war," he
said, "is that it is the kind of
issue which should be approach
ed with reason and not with a
black and white decision like
Proposition P."
Walker, a history graduate
student, is immediate past presi
dent of the Stanford Young Re
publicans (YR).
Charles Bell, chairman of the
committee which sponsored the
Daily advertisement, emphasized
that his opposition to the Prop
osition "doesn't mean I'm a hawk
on the war."

"I originally supported our
commitment in Vietnam but now
it has become a question of na
tional priorities."
Bell, president of Lambda Nu
fraternity and last year's head
of the Political Union, is trea
surer of the San Mateo County
YRs.
The opponents of Proposition
P hope that financial support
for their three-day campaign
will come from "a variety of
sources." But for the present,
the cost of the full-page adver
tisement came out of the pocket
of Brian Benson, a business
graduate student.
Like Bell and Walker, Benson
said he was "surprised" when
he learned that the Legislature
had approved a referendum on
Proposition P.
"My impression was that the
Proposition was thrown on the
ballot at the very end of the

K.APS CITY PROBLEMS â€” Paul McCloskey, liberal Republican candidate for San Mateo County Con
gTessman, spoke yesterday at the Law School. (For story, see page 8.)
Two ad-hoc committees have
rallied to defeat Stanford's own
version of Proposition P, but
their efforts may prove unneces
sary because the Vietnam war
referendum may not be held
after all.
Student opponents of the anti
war Proposition have purchased
a full-page advertisement in The
Daily today and blanketed the
campus with leaflets bearing
the plea, "Vote No on Proposi
tion P."
The Proposition was placed
on the ballot for Stanford's gen
eral autumn student elections
tomorrow and Thursday by the
Legislature at the meeting Nov.
2.
But it was learned last night
that the resolution proposing a
referendum on Proposition P
was introduced on the floor Nov.
2 by a student who is not a
member of the Legislature. This
technicality casts doubt on the
legality of the referendum. Leg
islature Speaker Michael Wein
stein said last night he will give
a ruling on the legality of the
student referendum today after
consulting other ASSU officials.
Leaflets Distributed
Opponents of the Proposition
purchased the advertisement on
page 5 of todya's Daily at a cost
of $300. Leaflets were distrib
uted at campus residences Sun
day and last night urging a "no"
vote in the Stanford refer
endum.
No organized campus group
has taken any action in support
of the Proposition in tomor
row's referendum.
Proposition P was to appear
on the student ballot as follows:
"Shall it be the policy of the
students of Stanford University
that there be an immediate
cease fire and withdrawal of
U.S. troops from Vietnam so
that the Vietnamese people can
settle their own problems?"
The original Proposition P
will be considered by voters to
day in San Francisco. The city

of Cambridge, Mass. will have a
similar referendum on a pro
posal that U.S. troops withdraw
from Vietnam.
On The Ballot
The bizarre story of how
Proposition P was placed on the
ballot by the Legislature un
folded last night. The motion to
put the controversial Proposi
tion up to a student referendum
was made by Dennis Hayes, a
22-year-old undergraduate who
lives at 2248 Euclid Avenue in
Palo Alto.
Hayes attended the meeting
as a spectator. He says he
started acting as a substitute
member on the basis of an oral
understanding with a fraternity
member who left the meeting
early.
Hayes' action violated ASSU
by-laws, according to Weinstein.
He pointed out that "We go by
the honor code at Legislature,"
not formally checking to see
that each student who votes is
a bona fide member.
The Legislature's overwhelm
ing approval of the Proposition
P referendum came late in the
evening when only 42 members
were still present, barely a
quorum.
Vigil Referendum
Hayes, proposed the referen
dum on Proopsition P after the
Legislature approved a refer
endum on the Memorial Church
"peace vigil" this coming Sat
urday.
Hayes admits he had "not
thought at all about making the
suggestion before I came to the
meeting."
If Proposition P does appear
on the ballot tomorrow, it will
be one of many decisions before
the student voters. As well as
the peace vigil resolution, all
registered students can vote for
a head yell leader to lead cheer
leading at athletic events begin
ning winter quarter.
In addition, off-campus under
graduates and graduate students
in the schools of engineering,
education and humanities and
sciences will elect their Legisla
ture representatives.

The determined publicity cam
paign to defeat Proposition P at
Stanford was undertaken before
the news broke that the referen
dum may be illegal.
Ad-hoc Committees
Two ad-hoc committees are be
hind the campaign to defeat the
Proposition. They are "Concern
ed Students for Responsible De
bate," and "Stanford Committee
for the Defeat of Proposition P."
The first distributed leaflets Sun
day and the second arranged to
day's advertisement and yester
day's leafleting.
About 30 students are work
ing on the two groups, which
have cooperated closely since
they were spontaneously formed
Friday.
"Proposition P calls for im
mediate withdrawal, without
provisions for negotiations or
gradual disengagement," the ad
vertisement states.
"The issue is not the Vietnam
War. The issue is irresponsible
diplomacy," it reads. The adver
tisement gives quotations from
Senator J. William Fulbright,
Edwin O. Reischauer, and Stan
ford Prof. Claude Buss. All the
quotations suggest negotiations
or oppose withdrawal.
Charge 'Emotionalism'
The students opposing Propo
sition P criticize it as an all-or
nothing policy based on "emo
tionalism."
"What we're especially con
cerned with is the polarization of
an issue in an academic commu
nity," according to Robert Walk
er, chairman of the Concerned
Students group. "My own view
point on the Vietnam war," he
said, "is that it is the kind of
issue which should be approach
ed with reason and not with a
black and white decision like
Proposition P."
Walker, a history graduate
student, is immediate past presi
dent of the Stanford Young Re
publicans (YR).
Charles Bell, chairman of the
committee which sponsored the
Daily advertisement, emphasized
that his opposition to the Prop
osition "doesn't mean I'm a hawk
on the war."

"I originally supported our
commitment in Vietnam but now
it has become a question of na
tional priorities."
Bell, president of Lambda Nu
fraternity and last year's head
of the Political Union, is trea
surer of the San Mateo County
YRs.
The opponents of Proposition
P hope that financial support
for their three-day campaign
will come from "a variety of
sources." But for the present,
the cost of the full-page adver
tisement came out of the pocket
of Brian Benson, a business
graduate student.
Like Bell and Walker, Benson
said he was "surprised" when
he learned that the Legislature
had approved a referendum on
Proposition P.
"My impression was that the
Proposition was thrown on the

the cost of the full-page adver
tisement came out of the pocket
of Brian Benson, a business
graduate student.
Like Bell and Walker, Benson
said he was "surprised" when
he learned that the Legislature
had approved a referendum on
Proposition P.
"My impression was that the
Proposition was thrown on the
ballot at the very end of the
meeting," Bell said.

gTessman, spoke yesterday at the Law School. (For story, see page 8.)
Two ad-hoc committees have
rallied to defeat Stanford's own
version of Proposition P, but
their efforts may prove unneces
sary because the Vietnam war
referendum may not be held
after all.
Student opponents of the anti
war Proposition have purchased
a full-page advertisement in The
Daily today and blanketed the
campus with leaflets bearing
the plea, "Vote No on Proposi
tion P."
The Proposition was placed
on the ballot for Stanford's gen
eral autumn student elections
tomorrow and Thursday by the
Legislature at the meeting Nov.
2.
But it was learned last night
that the resolution proposing a
referendum on Proposition P
was introduced on the floor Nov.
2 by a student who is not a
member of the Legislature. This
technicality casts doubt on the
legality of the referendum. Leg
islature Speaker Michael Wein
stein said last night he will give
a ruling on the legality of the
student referendum today after
consulting other ASSU officials.
Leaflets Distributed
Opponents of the Proposition
purchased the advertisement on
page 5 of todya's Daily at a cost
of $300. Leaflets were distrib
uted at campus residences Sun
day and last night urging a "no"
vote in the Stanford refer
endum.
No organized campus group
has taken any action in support
of the Proposition in tomor
row's referendum.
Proposition P was to appear
on the student ballot as follows:
"Shall it be the policy of the
students of Stanford University
that there be an immediate
cease fire and withdrawal of
U.S. troops from Vietnam so
that the Vietnamese people can
settle their own problems?"
The original Proposition P
will be considered by voters to
day in San Francisco. The city

of Cambridge, Mass. will have a
similar referendum on a pro
posal that U.S. troops withdraw
from Vietnam.
On The Ballot
The bizarre story of how
Proposition P was placed on the
ballot by the Legislature un
folded last night. The motion to
put the controversial Proposi
tion up to a student referendum
was made by Dennis Hayes, a
22-year-old undergraduate who
lives at 2248 Euclid Avenue in
Palo Alto.
Hayes attended the meeting
as a spectator. He says he
started acting as a substitute
member on the basis of an oral
understanding with a fraternity
member who left the meeting
early.
Hayes' action violated ASSU
by-laws, according to Weinstein.
He pointed out that "We go by
the honor code at Legislature,"
not formally checking to see
that each student who votes is
a bona fide member.
The Legislature's overwhelm
ing approval of the Proposition
P referendum came late in the
evening when only 42 members
were still present, barely a
quorum.
Vigil Referendum
Hayes, proposed the referen
dum on Proopsition P after the
Legislature approved a refer
endum on the Memorial Church
"peace vigil" this coming Sat
urday.
Hayes admits he had "not
thought at all about making the
suggestion before I came to the
meeting."
If Proposition P does appear
on the ballot tomorrow, it will
be one of many decisions before
the student voters. As well as
the peace vigil resolution, all
registered students can vote for
a head yell leader to lead cheer
leading at athletic events begin
ning winter quarter.
In addition, off-campus under
graduates and graduate students
in the schools of engineering,
education and humanities and
sciences will elect their Legisla
ture representatives.

The determined publicity cam
paign to defeat Proposition P at
Stanford was undertaken before
the news broke that the referen
dum may be illegal.
Ad-hoc Committees
Two ad-hoc committees are be
hind the campaign to defeat the
Proposition. They are "Concern
ed Students for Responsible De
bate," and "Stanford Committee
for the Defeat of Proposition P."
The first distributed leaflets Sun
day and the second arranged to
day's advertisement and yester
day's leafleting.
About 30 students are work
ing on the two groups, which
have cooperated closely since
they were spontaneously formed
Friday.
"Proposition P calls for im
mediate withdrawal, without
provisions for negotiations or
gradual disengagement," the ad
vertisement states.
"The issue is not the Vietnam
War. The issue is irresponsible
diplomacy," it reads. The adver
tisement gives quotations from
Senator J. William Fulbright,
Edwin O. Reischauer, and Stan
ford Prof. Claude Buss. All the
quotations suggest negotiations
or oppose withdrawal.
Charge 'Emotionalism'
The students opposing Propo
sition P criticize it as an all-or
nothing policy based on "emo
tionalism."
"What we're especially con
cerned with is the polarization of
an issue in an academic commu
nity," according to Robert Walk
er, chairman of the Concerned
Students group. "My own view
point on the Vietnam war," he
said, "is that it is the kind of
issue which should be approach
ed with reason and not with a
black and white decision like
Proposition P."
Walker, a history graduate
student, is immediate past presi
dent of the Stanford Young Re
publicans (YR).
Charles Bell, chairman of the
committee which sponsored the
Daily advertisement, emphasized
that his opposition to the Prop
osition "doesn't mean I'm a hawk
on the war."

"I originally supported our
commitment in Vietnam but now
it has become a question of na
tional priorities."
Bell, president of Lambda Nu
fraternity and last year's head
of the Political Union, is trea
surer of the San Mateo County
YRs.
The opponents of Proposition
P hope that financial support
for their three-day campaign
will come from "a variety of
sources." But for the present,
the cost of the full-page adver
tisement came out of the pocket
of Brian Benson, a business
graduate student.
Like Bell and Walker, Benson
said he was "surprised" when
he learned that the Legislature
had approved a referendum on
Proposition P.
"My impression was that the
Proposition was thrown on the
ballot at the very end of the
meeting," Bell said.
