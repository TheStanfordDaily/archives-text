# Activist Groups Are Suffering Through Lack Of Organization

ideology in defense of strategy,
witnessed during the Anti-
Draft Week and CIA week ac
tivities—from the less militant
as well as the more militant
radicals—makes real radical dia
logue improbable. It therefore
fragments the movement, caus
ing its rationale, its ideological
position, as well as its overt ac
tions and action tactics to fail
through incoherency and dis
unity.
As long as SDS, the Resist
ance, and other groups are only
functional as small leadership
groups, their very existence
demonstrates the weakness and
lack of definition (ideological
and organizational) within the
"radical community."
This weakness is inadvertent
ly explointed by the "free press"
(eg. Daily), which inevitably
identifies the most adventuristic
acts and the "best known radi
cals" with these organizations.
While this is not always bad, it
is often misleading.
Not Really Broad-Based
Ironically, the Daily (and
therefore the student body)
seems to know more about what
Stanford SDS is and does than
most pf the members of that or
ganization. (Lest anyone think
this facetious, I might point out
that I have attended but two or
three SDS meetings in two
years, yet I have twice been re
ported as its president and more
often as a member or repre
sentative.)
This can only occur because
SDS does not really exist as a

Failure evokes self-criticism
and self-understanding, laying
the groundwork for great in
dividual and collective success.
It is in this context that we can
learn a great deal from the dis
mal failure of the demonstra
tion against the CIA. After
crawling around various nooks
and crannies with ears to walls,
I have come to the following
conclusions.
The time has long since come
for activists to understand and
adopt the definition of "orga
nizing" that they have been
peddling in their rhetoric.
Students have had enough of
being organized and talked at.
They want to participate in
open discussion, and they want
an end to authoritarianism —
from any direction. Radical dog
matism, too, is equated with au
thoritarianism.
The most important split
within the Movement is not be
tween liberals and radicals but
among people who consider
themselves radical. While the
argumentation between liberals
and radicals tends to be sym
bolic (pro or con the basic insti
tutions, pro or con the Monop
oly-Capital status quo) and lack
ing in even potential communi
tation, the argumentation
among radicals tends to be sub
stantive, angry, muddled, real,
open, and most important, ideo
logically resolvable.
Defending- Strategy
The dogmatic promulgation of

broad-based radical organiza
tion.
The notion of constituency or
ganizing demands an abundant
supply of resourceful and toler
ant organizers whose communi
ties are defined by natural
work, play, study, living en
vironments.
Spontaneous Generation
In a sense, these kinds of lo
cal radical communities spring
up by themselves; but what is
to bring them together or hold
them together? What kind of
structural model can break
through the tediousness of po
litical meetings, through the
bureaucratic and dictatorial na
ture of centralized organiza
tion?
There is a rather simple
though somewhat naive model:
everybody works, everybody
speaks, everybody acts and in
teracts in small groups. Groups
are impelled to coordinate by
their own need to act, to act for
radical change. Is it not possible
for each man and woman to be
both a leader and follower?
Through our acquiescence the
Dow Chemical Corporation has
had both the right and the
power to make Napalm bombs.
I am granted neither the right
nor the power to stop them
from making those Napalm
bombs (nor are you). If I were
Mr. McAfee Brown I would feel
morally obligated to sit-in
against Dow, but as a social and
political animal I ought not act
except as part of the radical
community. So let's talk first;
in small groups. Maybe Do w
should be left alone, too!

witnessed during the Anti-
Draft Week and CIA week ac
tivities—from the less militant
as well as the more militant
radicals—makes real radical dia
logue improbable. It therefore
fragments the movement, caus
ing its rationale, its ideological
position, as well as its overt ac
tions and action tactics to fail
through incoherency and dis
unity.
As long as SDS, the Resist
ance, and other groups are only
functional as small leadership
groups, their very existence
demonstrates the weakness and
lack of definition (ideological
and organizational) within the
"radical community."
This weakness is inadvertent
ly explointed by the "free press"
(eg. Daily), which inevitably
identifies the most adventuristic
acts and the "best known radi
cals" with these organizations.
While this is not always bad, it
is often misleading.
Not Really Broad-Based
Ironically, the Daily (and
therefore the student body)
seems to know more about what
Stanford SDS is and does than
most pf the members of that or
ganization. (Lest anyone think
this facetious, I might point out
that I have attended but two or
three SDS meetings in two
years, yet I have twice been re
ported as its president and more
often as a member or repre
sentative.)
This can only occur because
SDS does not really exist as a

Failure evokes self-criticism
and self-understanding, laying
the groundwork for great in
dividual and collective success.
It is in this context that we can
learn a great deal from the dis
mal failure of the demonstra
tion against the CIA. After
crawling around various nooks
and crannies with ears to walls,
I have come to the following
conclusions.
The time has long since come
for activists to understand and
adopt the definition of "orga
nizing" that they have been
peddling in their rhetoric.
Students have had enough of
being organized and talked at.
They want to participate in
open discussion, and they want
an end to authoritarianism —
from any direction. Radical dog
matism, too, is equated with au
thoritarianism.
The most important split
within the Movement is not be
tween liberals and radicals but
among people who consider
themselves radical. While the
argumentation between liberals
and radicals tends to be sym
bolic (pro or con the basic insti
tutions, pro or con the Monop
oly-Capital status quo) and lack
ing in even potential communi
tation, the argumentation
among radicals tends to be sub
stantive, angry, muddled, real,
open, and most important, ideo
logically resolvable.
Defending- Strategy
The dogmatic promulgation of

broad-based radical organiza
tion.
The notion of constituency or
ganizing demands an abundant
supply of resourceful and toler
ant organizers whose communi
ties are defined by natural
work, play, study, living en
vironments.
Spontaneous Generation
In a sense, these kinds of lo
cal radical communities spring
up by themselves; but what is
to bring them together or hold
them together? What kind of
structural model can break
through the tediousness of po
litical meetings, through the
bureaucratic and dictatorial na
ture of centralized organiza
tion?
There is a rather simple
though somewhat naive model:
everybody works, everybody
speaks, everybody acts and in
teracts in small groups. Groups
are impelled to coordinate by
their own need to act, to act for
radical change. Is it not possible
for each man and woman to be
both a leader and follower?
Through our acquiescence the
Dow Chemical Corporation has
had both the right and the
power to make Napalm bombs.
I am granted neither the right
nor the power to stop them
from making those Napalm
bombs (nor are you). If I were
Mr. McAfee Brown I would feel
morally obligated to sit-in
against Dow, but as a social and
political animal I ought not act
except as part of the radical
community. So let's talk first;
in small groups. Maybe Do w
should be left alone, too!
