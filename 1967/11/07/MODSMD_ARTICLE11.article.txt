"As a concerned American as
well as a Republican, I cannot
leave unchallenged any candi

abandon a million and a half

Today is the big day. That's
right, it's election day. If you
read the Chronicle yesterday or
today you wouldn't even know
that there was an election go
ing on in San Mateo. There is,
however, and it's rather an im
portant one, too.
Without a doubt, the most im
portant question facing San Ma
teo voters is the special election
to fill the congressional seat
left vacant by the death of Rep
resentative J. Arthur Younger.
The number of candidates for
this post might lead one to
think that this election is being
held in France where the num
ber of possible candidates for
any office is usually astronomi
cal.
After cutting through all the

shouting, however, only three
candidates appear as strong con
tenders. Election of either of
the two men wouldn't be so bad,
but the mother? Please no.
In 1964, Barry Goldwater felt
that for the good of the country
the eastern seaboard should be
severed from the rest of the na
tion and be allowed to float out
to sea.
If Shirley Temple Black
should win today's election, his
statement would be even more
a propos, providing of course
that western be substituted for
eastern.
See Shirley Run
It really is a shame that little
Shirley Temple isn't running.
She would be a far more ap
pealing candidate than big Shir
ley Temple Black.
This country has more than
its share of concerned mothers
and most of them are most con
cerned about the very policies
which Mrs. Black seems to be
supporting. Besides, concerned
motherhood is somewhat weak
as the basis for a campaign.
Then too, being a mother is
not really the best qualification
for being a congresswoman. Oh
I'm sure that it is helpful to
know how to prepare meals and
wash kids and take out the gar
bage, but the opportunities to
do this in the capitol are unfor
tunately limited.
It is easy to sympathize with
Mrs. Black.

She had a beautiful career
and she gave it up. She would
not be the first woman in such
a situation to begin to find her
self feeling unfulfilled. This lack
of fulfillment often causes wom
en to look for something to do
outside of the family circle. This
need is often referred to as the
feminine mystique.
All of this is fine and good.
Mrs. Black, if you are feeling
the tortuous pangs of unfulfill
ment, we understand what you
are going through. We'll even
help you find a job which is in
keeping with your many and
wonderful talents. You could
maybe babysit or volunteer at
the county hospital. There is a
big need for concerned mothers
in those two fields. But, not in
Congress.
Congress is not a household—
it is certainly not a happy house
hold. It is not a place where
comments about "you look a bit
thin; are you eating all right?"
would be entirely in place with
debates on foreign aid to under
developed countries.
It is very thoughtful of you
Mrs. Black to want to serve as
your country's mother, but
America's mother was a hardy
pioneer woman and her father
was a strapping backwoodsman.
They are both long gone, per
haps unfortunately so, but what
they have left is for the chil
dren to develop.

Today is the big day. That's
right, it's election day. If you
read the Chronicle yesterday or
today you wouldn't even know
that there was an election go
ing on in San Mateo. There is,
however, and it's rather an im
portant one, too.
Without a doubt, the most im
portant question facing San Ma
teo voters is the special election
to fill the congressional seat
left vacant by the death of Rep
resentative J. Arthur Younger.
The number of candidates for
this post might lead one to
think that this election is being
held in France where the num
ber of possible candidates for
any office is usually astronomi
cal.
After cutting through all the

shouting, however, only three
candidates appear as strong con
tenders. Election of either of
the two men wouldn't be so bad,
but the mother? Please no.
In 1964, Barry Goldwater felt
that for the good of the country
the eastern seaboard should be
severed from the rest of the na
tion and be allowed to float out
to sea.
If Shirley Temple Black
should win today's election, his
statement would be even more
a propos, providing of course
that western be substituted for
eastern.

It really is a shame that little
Shirley Temple isn't running.
She would be a far more ap
pealing candidate than big Shir
ley Temple Black.
This country has more than
its share of concerned mothers
and most of them are most con
cerned about the very policies
which Mrs. Black seems to be
supporting. Besides, concerned
motherhood is somewhat weak
as the basis for a campaign.
Then too, being a mother is
not really the best qualification
for being a congresswoman. Oh
I'm sure that it is helpful to
know how to prepare meals and
wash kids and take out the gar
bage, but the opportunities to
do this in the capitol are unfor
tunately limited.
It is easy to sympathize with
Mrs. Black.

She had a beautiful career
and she gave it up. She would
not be the first woman in such
a situation to begin to find her
self feeling unfulfilled. This lack
of fulfillment often causes wom
en to look for something to do
outside of the family circle. This
need is often referred to as the
feminine mystique.
All of this is fine and good.
Mrs. Black, if you are feeling
the tortuous pangs of unfulfill
ment, we understand what you
are going through. We'll even
help you find a job which is in
keeping with your many and
wonderful talents. You could
maybe babysit or volunteer at
the county hospital. There is a
big need for concerned mothers
in those two fields. But, not in
Congress.
Congress is not a household—
it is certainly not a happy house
hold. It is not a place where
comments about "you look a bit
thin; are you eating all right?"
would be entirely in place with
debates on foreign aid to under
developed countries.
It is very thoughtful of you
Mrs. Black to want to serve as
your country's mother, but
America's mother was a hardy
pioneer woman and her father
was a strapping backwoodsman.
They are both long gone, per
haps unfortunately so, but what
they have left is for the chil
dren to develop.
