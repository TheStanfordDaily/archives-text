# On Moral Imperatives And Other American Dilemmas

### KEN WASHINGTON 
(Editor's Note: Mr. Washing
ton is a member of the Black
Student Union.)
If there weren't always a vic
tim, it could even be humorous
self-torture and circumstance)
presents itself as an alternative
to the American mind, only as
the primacy of immorality finds
itself losing. The immediacy of
a decade of newly-found Life, a
highly intensified Human self
consciousness gyrating the dis
possessed of the world, and the
unique ways in which this Life
force confronts the Western/
American white, finds America
curiously in the grip of a "mor
al rebirth".
"Anti - Vietnam - war feeling"
oozes as a shallow and transpar
ent pus from Main St. to the
halls of Congress . . . and it con
tinues to foment in direct pro
portion to the extent America
finds itself getting whipped by
the sheer nerve and ingenuity
of the National Liberation Front
and the Vietnamese people. Th -
glut of anti-war morality today
remains, good ole' American
Fear in the face of defeat.
As a paradigm case, it is an
anti-warism that moves editor
ialists to articulate, looming, con
tradictions (Daily, Oct. 16) on
"Draft Resistance": "... We
support these men in their act
of conscience in what they feel
is the only means to stop the
Vietnam war. However, we can
not support those who turn in
their cards to oppose conscrip
tion to all wars . . . the nation
has a right to conscript men in
a defensive action ..."
With a comfortable main
stream of historical precedent
behind it, editorial and popular
nonsense continue to gorge upon
the innocent. The most final of
solutions and genocides are per
petrated and theologized with
the notion of "defensive action".
Hitler convinced his Aryans
that the very existence of Jewish
human beings was a need for
"defensive action". The United
Klans of America has been a
defensive society for well nigh
100 years — to say nothing of
the formidable economic sup

port South Africa and Rhodesia
receive from the banks of the
U.S. for their own "defensive"
style of life. Vietnam.
In an essential sense, merely
the historical experience of that
aspect of the world which lives
as Black, Red, and Yellow hu
man beings, presents very real
questions as to the innate capa
city for a morality of justice as
it might extend from white
America.
One has only to reflect for an
instant on the deep moral im
peratives that are enmeshed in
such systems as the "local po
lice"; the armed services; the
CIA; the unique pathology that
inspires members of the allied
draft-boards of this nation; to
say nothing of the dry-rot of
patriotism. To consider the hu
man despair that is inflicted in
the name of and by these enti
ties, merely begs the question ...
the Revolution germinates . . .
and as those particular systems
are denied by freedmen-gone
wild, amongst former masters,
there is much loose talk of "sick
ness in society" — when for the
first time since its inception
America may be getting well.
To recall that a nation is found
ed upon sickness and erected
over the systematic brutalization
of a whole sector of Black and
Red humanity, begs a truck-load
of questions more ...
As the utter reasonableness of
the most "radical" of Revolu
tionary Life comes into focus,
there is usually a query that
hangs so sanguinely from the
begs: "Why a Black Union
here?" Why indeed.
And we recall a most recent
loss of job by a Black student
because of a "lack of qualifica
tion" that not one of his retain
ed white co-workers possessed.
Or we may recall the sub-racist
drive of a professor-turned-grad
uate-administrator who had oc
casion to comment: "I can be
more patient with Southerners
who fear change . . . but I can
also understand charitably the
Negroes who have never had the
centuries of training in disci
pline and self-control and re
spect for the law that most of

us inherit from England and Eu
rope." In the wake of centuries
of English colonialism, slavery,
and acculturated beastiality,
moreover in a nation initiated
by disregard for that body of
"English law", the infinite capa
city of the entrenched player
for (morally) legitimizing the
peculiar depravity of his game,
is no more apparent than here.
Yet, petty considerations of
jobs and deans are somehow
lost in the immediacy of the
hour. We are Alive. From those
who live an exhilarating disen
francisement, the basic question
facing Western Civilization and
the peculiarly American refine
ments of Western-ethics, is a
classically simple question of
Survival. The bitterest and
Blackest irony is demanding a
recompense nothing short of
profound.
In the historical context of
the relatively short inhabitance
of Western white men on this
continent, in the context of the
attitude that fostered and has
emotionally sustained his para
sitic existence here; from the
most basic of human demands
for self-direction and self-realiza
tion, there is no such activity as
"radical" action. There can be
no activity radical enough. That
attitude which must judge the
just desires of exploited men as
"radical" and subversive, re
mains, in a land constructed by
and upon human exploitation,
as dominant an aspect of the
American character as any.
