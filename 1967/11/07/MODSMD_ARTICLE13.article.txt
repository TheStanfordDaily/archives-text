# Proposition P Endangers Effective Dissent
## 
### 
Editor, the Daily:
On Wednesday, November 8,
the Stanford student community
will be asked to support or
reject San Francisco Proposi
tion P, the so-called Vietnam
policy referendum. Proposition
P calls for "an immediate cease
fire and withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Vietnam so that the
Vietnamese people can solve
their own problems."
Many Stanford students deep
ly concerned about the nature
of American commitment to
South Vietnam or about the de
gree of our involvement there,
or both, should examine care
fully the implications of this
Proposition:
(1) It is not simply a "yes-no"
vote on current American policy.
Rather, it calls only for immedi
ate ceasefire and withdrawal —
such a policy of unconditional,
unnegotiated, and thus precipi
tous withdrawal is opposed by
such distinguished war critics as
Senators Fulbright, Kennedy,
Hatfield, General Gavin, and
George Kennan.
(2) Further, a unilateral with
drawal, no matter how desir
able it may seem, would have
diplomatic repercussions far be
yond the Far Eastern situation
—it would paralyze the regular
pattern of world diplomatic ac
tivity, which has reached some
what of a tense great power
stability in spite of the ominous
questionmark of U.S.-China re
lations. Precipitous, unilateral
withdrawal would create a cha
otic power vacuum, complete
confusion, and thus infinitely
greater chance of World War
and annihilation.
(3) The consequences of tak
ing a precipitous action, it
seems to me, surpass those of
not acting or of taking a more
reasonable course of action, and
indeed obliviate the dialectical
cant of those who would argue
that to rebuild (American for
eign policy), we must first tear
down (the current policy). De
sirable as that may seem to
some, the reality of the Pan
dora's Box that would open up
is more important than some
one's revolutionary purity or
self-indulgent conscience.
These are the issues at stake
on Wednesday. To those who
would argue that some action is
better than none at all, I hope
the logic of my third point an
swers your anguish—for this
essentially undirected Proposi
tion of Protest is one whose
consequences could do much to
completely destroy any effective
action or dissent.

• Maintain Dignity
Editor, the Daily:
What good has all the open
discussion on Viet-nam on the
Stanford campus done? Are we
to express monolithically a sim
plistic answer to a complex
problem—without any hint of
the extensive thoughtful consid
eration that is supposed to be
characteristic of a university
community? A yes vote on Prop
osition P would be but another
blow to the dignity of Stanford
University.

Editor, the Daily:
As members of the planning
committee for the Convocation
for Peace this Saturday, we
were rather surprised at the
wording of the LASSU resolu
tion calling for support of the
"peace vigil." We would like to
allay any misconceptions about
the purpose and intent of the

gathering which may stem from
the tone of the resolution.
The meeting Is conceived not
as a protest utilizing some par
ticular tactic. It is to be an op
portunity for individuals at all
different stages of commitment
and concern to come together to
discuss and share their feelings
—not to debate and battle over
them.
Unfortunately, the phrase, "to
show a reasonable way," may
carry with it the connotation
that other expressions of con
cern are necessarily "unreason
able." This is hardly the inten
tion of the planning committee.
Our main interest is in pro
viding a context for communi
cation and reflections among
members of the Stanford-Palo
Alto communities who have con
cerns for peace in Vietnam. The
political impact and press cover
age which may or may not be
a result of the controversy is
secondary.

• Nonsense
Editor, The Daily:
Monday's column by "Herbie
Hinckes," states that "fearless
Dean of Students Joel Smith
decided (Jack) Gerson had taken
enough time at the door. Joel
pushed the student roughly, try
ing to force the student out"
(the front door of Encina dur
ing the CIA demonstration).
As a witness to the same in
cident, I found it difficult to be
lieve that Gerson would have
failed to mention having been
roughed up by the dean, if this
in fact was the case. Gerson
made no such charge in his short
talk on the bullhorn immediately
after leaving the building.
When I called Gerson Monday
afternoon and asked him about
"Hinckes" account, he said:
"Thats' nonsense. I don't remem
ber being pushed out the door."
"Hinckes" did not mention the
fact that the poster which was
shoved through the front door
opening after Gerson left grazed
Dean Smith's head — a fact
which "Hinckes" was not in a
position to witness personally.

(My apologies to Dean of Stu
dents Joel Smith for saying he
pushed Jack Gerson. I was stand
ing three feet away and that is
what I thought I saw take place.
But since Gerson denies it, I
must be wrong. I will try to get
an appointment with an eye doc
tor as soon as possible. H.H.)
• Arab Appeal
Editor, The Daily:
The "Appeal for Israel" (The
Daily, Oct. 26) is an ignominous
commentary on the perception
of truth and justice by Ameri
cans, particularly its men of
learning.
Justice, morality, and con
science, whose only beneficiaries
would be the Arabs, have been
invoked again to blackmail
American conscience.
The call for direct negotiations
is unacceptable to the Arabs as
it implies:
1. Condoning a Western set
tler-colonialist group which de
nies the indigenous people even
the right of physical exis
tence in their own homes.
2. Rejection of United Nations
authority and its more than 250
Resolutions, including the U.N.
1947 Partition Plan delineating
the extent of Israel territory
(which itself was denial to
Arabs their right of self-deter
mination.)
3. Consolidation of Israeli ex
pansion through aggressions in
1948, 1956, and 1957.
King Husain's statement to

the U.N. General Assembly on
June 6 should be a required read
ing. He said: "... should the
return of all our lands be delay
ed any longer and should all
traces of aggression which be
gan on 5 June not be completely
erased, Jordan will still survive.
Ground down by sorrow for the
moment, we will rise again. And
with us will arise the Arab Na
tion."
We are witnessing today the
reawakening of over 700 million
Arabs and Muslims along with
other uncounted millions who be
lieve in the justice of the Arab
cause.

• Political Rostrum?
Editor, The Daily:
The pulpit of our campus has
become a political soap box es
pousing a point of view which
goes beyond the ethics of our
country's foreign policy. No one
would argue that the war in
Vietnam is good or just. Far
from it. But realize the limita
tion of ethical boundaries as the
solution to all problems.
The "Sermon" by the Dean of
the Chapel in Memorial Church
on Sunday was a one-sided po
litical speech, not a sermon.
Should the campus church de
cide to take the path of elevat
ing politics over Christianity,
then I firmly believe that equal
time for rebuttal from the pul
pit should be given for the op
posing political point of view.
Though "peace" is congruent
with Judeo - Christian ethic,
"peace at any price" is a philo
sophy which cannot be substan
tiated on the same grounds.

Editor, The Daily:
According to an article on
page seven of The Daily, Mon

we went to the ASSU office Mon
day. There we were informed by
the secretary that "there is no
list of those who submitted in

• Intrinsic Value
Editor, The Daily:
The interesting article by Rob
in Knight on current student at
titudes toward the Peace Corps
(Friday, October 20) was dis
heartening to me. For those op
posed to the war in Vietnam to
decline to volunteer for Peace
Corps service as a means
of indicating their disapproval
of the current administration's
policies may have ideological ap

peal, but its human consequences
could be harsh.
For example, Peace Corps
programs have recently begun
for Tonga and Samoa. I have
had the opportunity to observe
the conditions that led those
Polynesian nations to ask for
Peace Corps help. I have also
had the opportunity to talk with
some of the ex-volunteers now
serving as the Washington staff
responsible for planning the op
erations, which are just now
getting well underway.
The dedication and perception
of those doing the planning is
evident and impressive. The need
of the islanders for some ex
ternal help with hygiene, basic
education, and agricultural devel
opment on a strictly local level
is also clear. The economic and
social problems created by ex
plosive population growth and
rising expectations in these is
land groups with limited resour
ces will exist and intensify re
gardless of the course of events
in Vietnam.
The Peace Corps operations
have intrinsic worth. Their value
to the people directly involved
does not depend upon coordina
tion with wars elsewhere. Would
anything of lasting value be
gained by abandoning the whole
field of foreign service to the
armed forces?

• Really Existing?
Editor, The Dally:
That Monday, when I left my
draft card at the Federal Build
ing in San Francisco, I began
to exist. It only then hit me how
true what I have been telling
myself for six months really is:
that whatever I believe is mean
ingless unless I live it. I am
dealt with as a statistic because
I do not choose to become a
person. But now I have begun
to create my own identity, not
the one my parents would like
to give me, that Stanford would
like me to have, or that the gov
ernment would like me to com
ply with.
It has been too easy at Stan
ford to be absorbed in making
the Dean's List and Cum Laude,
in hermit scholarship, all of
which is detached from the kill
ing and maiming that goes on
and on and on. In our name.
It has been too easy to think
that the wrong done by the sys
tem happens because the wrong
people are in power, quite miss
ing the point that the wrong will
always exist so long as that cen
tralized power is made possible.
Yet, one does not have to
leave Stanford to confront the
forces that seek to control and
use us. There is a great deal to
be done right here.
The question is, when will you
begin to exist? When will you
begin to create your own iden
tity and cease to be defined sole
ly by the institutions that envel
ope you?

• LASSU Snafu
Editor, The Daily:
Friday's article on LASSU was
very well written, but it omit

factual errors.
First, it was Arnette Cole

man, one of the kings of jazz
(not "Nat Coleman" as report
ed), who cancelled his appear
ance here because of racial dis
crimination.
More important, LASSU in
structed that a committee inves
tigate the nature of the discrim
ination. LASSU has no inten
tion of sweeping this incident
under the rug as the omission
of this in The Daily implied.
Last, the "Dennis Rutkins"

• Beards No Problem
Editor, The Daily:
What's the big deal? I pick
up a Daily and the first thing
I see is a story about a guy
who doesn't get a job because
he has a beard. So what! I was
dismissed from a job in a library
language laboratory, because
I'm black; I couldn't find a suit
able place to live, because I'm
black!
If our friend the waiter shaves

ho has a job. But what about my
lab job and what about a place
for me to live? All the shaving
cream on earth can't help me
get the lab job back.
So if anyone wants to know
if there is any discrimination
on Stanford's campus ask the
bearded waiter and then ask me.

• Nonsense
Editor, The Daily:
Monday's column by "Herbie
Hinckes," states that "fearless
Dean of Students Joel Smith
decided (Jack) Gerson had taken
enough time at the door. Joel
pushed the student roughly, try
ing to force the student out"
(the front door of Encina dur
ing the CIA demonstration).
As a witness to the same in
cident, I found it difficult to be
lieve that Gerson would have
failed to mention having been
roughed up by the dean, if this
in fact was the case. Gerson
made no such charge in his short
talk on the bullhorn immediately
after leaving the building.
When I called Gerson Monday
afternoon and asked him about
"Hinckes" account, he said:
"Thats' nonsense. I don't remem
ber being pushed out the door."
"Hinckes" did not mention the
fact that the poster which was
shoved through the front door
opening after Gerson left grazed
Dean Smith's head — a fact
which "Hinckes" was not in a
position to witness personally.

pushed Jack Gerson. I was stand

• Arab Appeal
Editor, The Daily:
The "Appeal for Israel" (The
Daily, Oct. 26) is an ignominous
commentary on the perception
of truth and justice by Ameri
cans, particularly its men of
learning.
Justice, morality, and con
science, whose only beneficiaries
would be the Arabs, have been
invoked again to blackmail
American conscience.
The call for direct negotiations
is unacceptable to the Arabs as
it implies:
1. Condoning a Western set
tler-colonialist group which de
nies the indigenous people even
the right of physical exis
tence in their own homes.
2. Rejection of United Nations
authority and its more than 250
Resolutions, including the U.N.
1947 Partition Plan delineating
the extent of Israel territory
(which itself was denial to
Arabs their right of self-deter
mination.)
3. Consolidation of Israeli ex
pansion through aggressions in
1948, 1956, and 1957.
King Husain's statement to

the U.N. General Assembly on
June 6 should be a required read
ing. He said: "... should the
return of all our lands be delay
ed any longer and should all
traces of aggression which be
gan on 5 June not be completely
erased, Jordan will still survive.
Ground down by sorrow for the
moment, we will rise again. And
with us will arise the Arab Na
tion."
We are witnessing today the
reawakening of over 700 million
Arabs and Muslims along with
other uncounted millions who be
lieve in the justice of the Arab
cause.

• Political Rostrum?
Editor, The Daily:
The pulpit of our campus has
become a political soap box es
pousing a point of view which
goes beyond the ethics of our
country's foreign policy. No one
would argue that the war in
Vietnam is good or just. Far
from it. But realize the limita
tion of ethical boundaries as the
solution to all problems.
The "Sermon" by the Dean of
the Chapel in Memorial Church
on Sunday was a one-sided po
litical speech, not a sermon.
Should the campus church de
cide to take the path of elevat
ing politics over Christianity,
then I firmly believe that equal
time for rebuttal from the pul
pit should be given for the op
posing political point of view.
Though "peace" is congruent
with Judeo - Christian ethic,
"peace at any price" is a philo
sophy which cannot be substan
tiated on the same grounds.

• Intrinsic Value
Editor, The Daily:
The interesting article by Rob
in Knight on current student at
titudes toward the Peace Corps
(Friday, October 20) was dis
heartening to me. For those op
posed to the war in Vietnam to
decline to volunteer for Peace
Corps service as a means
of indicating their disapproval
of the current administration's
policies may have ideological ap

peal, but its human consequences
could be harsh.
For example, Peace Corps
programs have recently begun
for Tonga and Samoa. I have
had the opportunity to observe
the conditions that led those
Polynesian nations to ask for
Peace Corps help. I have also
had the opportunity to talk with
some of the ex-volunteers now
serving as the Washington staff
responsible for planning the op
erations, which are just now
getting well underway.
The dedication and perception
of those doing the planning is
evident and impressive. The need
of the islanders for some ex
ternal help with hygiene, basic
education, and agricultural devel
opment on a strictly local level
is also clear. The economic and
social problems created by ex
plosive population growth and
rising expectations in these is
land groups with limited resour
ces will exist and intensify re
gardless of the course of events
in Vietnam.
The Peace Corps operations
have intrinsic worth. Their value
to the people directly involved
does not depend upon coordina
tion with wars elsewhere. Would
anything of lasting value be
gained by abandoning the whole
field of foreign service to the
armed forces?

• Really Existing?
Editor, The Dally:
That Monday, when I left my
draft card at the Federal Build
ing in San Francisco, I began
to exist. It only then hit me how
true what I have been telling
myself for six months really is:
that whatever I believe is mean
ingless unless I live it. I am
dealt with as a statistic because
I do not choose to become a
person. But now I have begun
to create my own identity, not
the one my parents would like
to give me, that Stanford would
like me to have, or that the gov
ernment would like me to com
ply with.
It has been too easy at Stan
ford to be absorbed in making
the Dean's List and Cum Laude,
in hermit scholarship, all of
which is detached from the kill
ing and maiming that goes on
and on and on. In our name.
It has been too easy to think
that the wrong done by the sys
tem happens because the wrong
people are in power, quite miss
ing the point that the wrong will
always exist so long as that cen
tralized power is made possible.
Yet, one does not have to
leave Stanford to confront the
forces that seek to control and
use us. There is a great deal to
be done right here.
The question is, when will you
begin to exist? When will you
begin to create your own iden
tity and cease to be defined sole
ly by the institutions that envel

• Beards No Problem
Editor, The Daily:
What's the big deal? I pick
up a Daily and the first thing
I see is a story about a guy
who doesn't get a job because
he has a beard. So what! I was
dismissed from a job in a library
language laboratory, because
I'm black; I couldn't find a suit
able place to live, because I'm
black!
If our friend the waiter shaves

ho has a job. But what about my
lab job and what about a place
for me to live? All the shaving
cream on earth can't help me
get the lab job back.
So if anyone wants to know
if there is any discrimination
on Stanford's campus ask the
bearded waiter and then ask me.
MERNOY HARRISON
Junior, Industrial Eng.
Editor, the Daily:
On Wednesday, November 8,
the Stanford student community
will be asked to support or
reject San Francisco Proposi
tion P, the so-called Vietnam
policy referendum. Proposition
P calls for "an immediate cease
fire and withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Vietnam so that the
Vietnamese people can solve
their own problems."
Many Stanford students deep
ly concerned about the nature
of American commitment to
South Vietnam or about the de
gree of our involvement there,
or both, should examine care
fully the implications of this
Proposition:
(1) It is not simply a "yes-no"
vote on current American policy.
Rather, it calls only for immedi
ate ceasefire and withdrawal —
such a policy of unconditional,
unnegotiated, and thus precipi
tous withdrawal is opposed by
such distinguished war critics as
Senators Fulbright, Kennedy,
Hatfield, General Gavin, and
George Kennan.
(2) Further, a unilateral with
drawal, no matter how desir
able it may seem, would have
diplomatic repercussions far be
yond the Far Eastern situation
—it would paralyze the regular
pattern of world diplomatic ac
tivity, which has reached some
what of a tense great power
stability in spite of the ominous
questionmark of U.S.-China re
lations. Precipitous, unilateral
withdrawal would create a cha
otic power vacuum, complete
confusion, and thus infinitely
greater chance of World War
and annihilation.
(3) The consequences of tak
ing a precipitous action, it
seems to me, surpass those of
not acting or of taking a more
reasonable course of action, and
indeed obliviate the dialectical
cant of those who would argue
that to rebuild (American for
eign policy), we must first tear
down (the current policy). De
sirable as that may seem to
some, the reality of the Pan
dora's Box that would open up
is more important than some
one's revolutionary purity or
self-indulgent conscience.
These are the issues at stake
on Wednesday. To those who
would argue that some action is
better than none at all, I hope
the logic of my third point an
swers your anguish—for this
essentially undirected Proposi
tion of Protest is one whose
consequences could do much to
completely destroy any effective
action or dissent.

Editor, the Daily:
As members of the planning
committee for the Convocation
for Peace this Saturday, we
were rather surprised at the
wording of the LASSU resolu
tion calling for support of the
"peace vigil." We would like to
allay any misconceptions about
the purpose and intent of the

gathering which may stem from
the tone of the resolution.
The meeting Is conceived not
as a protest utilizing some par
ticular tactic. It is to be an op
portunity for individuals at all
different stages of commitment
and concern to come together to
discuss and share their feelings
—not to debate and battle over
them.
Unfortunately, the phrase, "to
show a reasonable way," may
carry with it the connotation
that other expressions of con

able." This is hardly the inten

pousing a point of view which
goes beyond the ethics of our
country's foreign policy. No one
would argue that the war in
Vietnam is good or just. Far
from it. But realize the limita
tion of ethical boundaries as the
solution to all problems.
The "Sermon" by the Dean of
the Chapel in Memorial Church
on Sunday was a one-sided po
litical speech, not a sermon.
Should the campus church de
cide to take the path of elevat
ing politics over Christianity,
then I firmly believe that equal
time for rebuttal from the pul
pit should be given for the op
posing political point of view.
Though "peace" is congruent
with Judeo - Christian ethic,
"peace at any price" is a philo
sophy which cannot be substan

• Intrinsic Value
Editor, The Daily:
The interesting article by Rob
in Knight on current student at
titudes toward the Peace Corps
(Friday, October 20) was dis
heartening to me. For those op
posed to the war in Vietnam to
decline to volunteer for Peace
Corps service as a means
of indicating their disapproval
of the current administration's
policies may have ideological ap

peal, but its human consequences
could be harsh.
For example, Peace Corps
programs have recently begun
for Tonga and Samoa. I have
had the opportunity to observe
the conditions that led those
Polynesian nations to ask for
Peace Corps help. I have also
had the opportunity to talk with
some of the ex-volunteers now
serving as the Washington staff
responsible for planning the op
erations, which are just now
getting well underway.
The dedication and perception
of those doing the planning is
evident and impressive. The need
of the islanders for some ex
ternal help with hygiene, basic
education, and agricultural devel
opment on a strictly local level
is also clear. The economic and
social problems created by ex
plosive population growth and
rising expectations in these is
land groups with limited resour
ces will exist and intensify re
gardless of the course of events
in Vietnam.
The Peace Corps operations
have intrinsic worth. Their value
to the people directly involved
does not depend upon coordina
tion with wars elsewhere. Would
anything of lasting value be
gained by abandoning the whole
field of foreign service to the
armed forces?

• Really Existing?
Editor, The Dally:
That Monday, when I left my
draft card at the Federal Build
ing in San Francisco, I began
to exist. It only then hit me how
true what I have been telling
myself for six months really is:
that whatever I believe is mean
ingless unless I live it. I am
dealt with as a statistic because
I do not choose to become a
person. But now I have begun
to create my own identity, not
the one my parents would like
to give me, that Stanford would
like me to have, or that the gov
ernment would like me to com
ply with.
It has been too easy at Stan
ford to be absorbed in making
the Dean's List and Cum Laude,
in hermit scholarship, all of
which is detached from the kill
ing and maiming that goes on
and on and on. In our name.
It has been too easy to think
that the wrong done by the sys
tem happens because the wrong
people are in power, quite miss
ing the point that the wrong will
always exist so long as that cen
tralized power is made possible.
Yet, one does not have to
leave Stanford to confront the
forces that seek to control and
use us. There is a great deal to
be done right here.
The question is, when will you
begin to exist? When will you
begin to create your own iden

More important, LASSU in

• Beards No Problem
Editor, The Daily:
What's the big deal? I pick
up a Daily and the first thing
I see is a story about a guy
who doesn't get a job because
he has a beard. So what! I was
dismissed from a job in a library
language laboratory, because
I'm black; I couldn't find a suit
able place to live, because I'm
black!
If our friend the waiter shaves

ho has a job. But what about my
lab job and what about a place
for me to live? All the shaving
cream on earth can't help me
get the lab job back.
So if anyone wants to know
if there is any discrimination
on Stanford's campus ask the
bearded waiter and then ask me.
MERNOY HARRISON
Junior, Industrial Eng.
Editor, the Daily:
On Wednesday, November 8,
the Stanford student community
will be asked to support or
reject San Francisco Proposi
tion P, the so-called Vietnam
policy referendum. Proposition
P calls for "an immediate cease
fire and withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Vietnam so that the
Vietnamese people can solve
their own problems."
Many Stanford students deep
ly concerned about the nature
of American commitment to
South Vietnam or about the de
gree of our involvement there,
or both, should examine care
fully the implications of this
Proposition:
(1) It is not simply a "yes-no"
vote on current American policy.
Rather, it calls only for immedi
ate ceasefire and withdrawal —
such a policy of unconditional,
unnegotiated, and thus precipi
tous withdrawal is opposed by
such distinguished war critics as
Senators Fulbright, Kennedy,
Hatfield, General Gavin, and
George Kennan.
(2) Further, a unilateral with
drawal, no matter how desir
able it may seem, would have
diplomatic repercussions far be
yond the Far Eastern situation
—it would paralyze the regular
pattern of world diplomatic ac
tivity, which has reached some
what of a tense great power
stability in spite of the ominous
questionmark of U.S.-China re
lations. Precipitous, unilateral
withdrawal would create a cha
otic power vacuum, complete
confusion, and thus infinitely
greater chance of World War
and annihilation.
(3) The consequences of tak
ing a precipitous action, it
seems to me, surpass those of
not acting or of taking a more
reasonable course of action, and
indeed obliviate the dialectical
cant of those who would argue
that to rebuild (American for
eign policy), we must first tear
down (the current policy). De
sirable as that may seem to
some, the reality of the Pan
dora's Box that would open up
is more important than some
one's revolutionary purity or
self-indulgent conscience.
These are the issues at stake
on Wednesday. To those who
would argue that some action is
better than none at all, I hope
the logic of my third point an
swers your anguish—for this
essentially undirected Proposi
tion of Protest is one whose
consequences could do much to
completely destroy any effective
action or dissent.

• Pressing It
Editor, the Daily:
As members of the planning
committee for the Convocation
for Peace this Saturday, we
were rather surprised at the
wording of the LASSU resolu
tion calling for support of the
"peace vigil." We would like to
allay any misconceptions about
the purpose and intent of the

gathering which may stem from
the tone of the resolution.
The meeting Is conceived not
as a protest utilizing some par
ticular tactic. It is to be an op
portunity for individuals at all
different stages of commitment
and concern to come together to
discuss and share their feelings
—not to debate and battle over
them.
Unfortunately, the phrase, "to
show a reasonable way," may
carry with it the connotation
that other expressions of con
cern are necessarily "unreason
able." This is hardly the inten
tion of the planning committee.
Our main interest is in pro
viding a context for communi
cation and reflections among
members of the Stanford-Palo
Alto communities who have con
cerns for peace in Vietnam. The
political impact and press cover
age which may or may not be
a result of the controversy is
secondary.

• Nonsense
Editor, The Daily:
Monday's column by "Herbie
Hinckes," states that "fearless
Dean of Students Joel Smith
decided (Jack) Gerson had taken
enough time at the door. Joel
pushed the student roughly, try
ing to force the student out"
(the front door of Encina dur
ing the CIA demonstration).
As a witness to the same in
cident, I found it difficult to be
lieve that Gerson would have
failed to mention having been
roughed up by the dean, if this
in fact was the case. Gerson
made no such charge in his short
talk on the bullhorn immediately
after leaving the building.
When I called Gerson Monday
afternoon and asked him about
"Hinckes" account, he said:
"Thats' nonsense. I don't remem
ber being pushed out the door."
"Hinckes" did not mention the
fact that the poster which was
shoved through the front door
opening after Gerson left grazed
Dean Smith's head — a fact
which "Hinckes" was not in a
position to witness personally.

• Arab Appeal
Editor, The Daily:
The "Appeal for Israel" (The
Daily, Oct. 26) is an ignominous
commentary on the perception
of truth and justice by Ameri
cans, particularly its men of
learning.
Justice, morality, and con
science, whose only beneficiaries
would be the Arabs, have been
invoked again to blackmail
American conscience.
The call for direct negotiations
is unacceptable to the Arabs as
it implies:
1. Condoning a Western set
tler-colonialist group which de
nies the indigenous people even
the right of physical exis
tence in their own homes.
2. Rejection of United Nations
authority and its more than 250
Resolutions, including the U.N.
1947 Partition Plan delineating
the extent of Israel territory
(which itself was denial to
Arabs their right of self-deter
mination.)
3. Consolidation of Israeli ex
pansion through aggressions in
1948, 1956, and 1957.
King Husain's statement to

the U.N. General Assembly on
June 6 should be a required read
ing. He said: "... should the
return of all our lands be delay
ed any longer and should all
traces of aggression which be
gan on 5 June not be completely
erased, Jordan will still survive.
Ground down by sorrow for the
moment, we will rise again. And
with us will arise the Arab Na
tion."
We are witnessing today the
reawakening of over 700 million
Arabs and Muslims along with
other uncounted millions who be
lieve in the justice of the Arab
cause.

I do not choose to become a
person. But now I have begun
to create my own identity, not
the one my parents would like
to give me, that Stanford would
like me to have, or that the gov
ernment would like me to com
ply with.
It has been too easy at Stan
ford to be absorbed in making
the Dean's List and Cum Laude,
in hermit scholarship, all of
which is detached from the kill
ing and maiming that goes on
and on and on. In our name.
It has been too easy to think
that the wrong done by the sys
tem happens because the wrong
people are in power, quite miss
ing the point that the wrong will
always exist so long as that cen
tralized power is made possible.
Yet, one does not have to
leave Stanford to confront the
forces that seek to control and
use us. There is a great deal to
be done right here.
The question is, when will you
begin to exist? When will you
begin to create your own iden
tity and cease to be defined sole
ly by the institutions that envel

• Beards No Problem
Editor, The Daily:
What's the big deal? I pick
up a Daily and the first thing
I see is a story about a guy
who doesn't get a job because
he has a beard. So what! I was
dismissed from a job in a library
language laboratory, because
I'm black; I couldn't find a suit
able place to live, because I'm
black!
If our friend the waiter shaves

ho has a job. But what about my
lab job and what about a place
for me to live? All the shaving
cream on earth can't help me
get the lab job back.
So if anyone wants to know
if there is any discrimination
on Stanford's campus ask the

Editor, the Daily:
On Wednesday, November 8,
the Stanford student community
will be asked to support or
reject San Francisco Proposi
tion P, the so-called Vietnam
policy referendum. Proposition
P calls for "an immediate cease
fire and withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Vietnam so that the
Vietnamese people can solve
their own problems."
Many Stanford students deep
ly concerned about the nature
of American commitment to
South Vietnam or about the de
gree of our involvement there,
or both, should examine care
fully the implications of this
Proposition:
(1) It is not simply a "yes-no"
vote on current American policy.
Rather, it calls only for immedi
ate ceasefire and withdrawal —
such a policy of unconditional,
unnegotiated, and thus precipi
tous withdrawal is opposed by
such distinguished war critics as
Senators Fulbright, Kennedy,
Hatfield, General Gavin, and
George Kennan.
(2) Further, a unilateral with
drawal, no matter how desir
able it may seem, would have
diplomatic repercussions far be
yond the Far Eastern situation
—it would paralyze the regular
pattern of world diplomatic ac
tivity, which has reached some
what of a tense great power
stability in spite of the ominous
questionmark of U.S.-China re
lations. Precipitous, unilateral
withdrawal would create a cha
otic power vacuum, complete
confusion, and thus infinitely
greater chance of World War
and annihilation.
(3) The consequences of tak
ing a precipitous action, it
seems to me, surpass those of
not acting or of taking a more
reasonable course of action, and
indeed obliviate the dialectical
cant of those who would argue
that to rebuild (American for
eign policy), we must first tear
down (the current policy). De
sirable as that may seem to
some, the reality of the Pan
dora's Box that would open up
is more important than some
one's revolutionary purity or
self-indulgent conscience.
These are the issues at stake
on Wednesday. To those who
would argue that some action is
better than none at all, I hope
the logic of my third point an
swers your anguish—for this
essentially undirected Proposi
tion of Protest is one whose
consequences could do much to
completely destroy any effective
action or dissent.

• Pressing It
Editor, the Daily:
As members of the planning
committee for the Convocation
for Peace this Saturday, we
were rather surprised at the
wording of the LASSU resolu
tion calling for support of the
"peace vigil." We would like to
allay any misconceptions about
the purpose and intent of the

gathering which may stem from
the tone of the resolution.
The meeting Is conceived not
as a protest utilizing some par
ticular tactic. It is to be an op
portunity for individuals at all
different stages of commitment
and concern to come together to
discuss and share their feelings
—not to debate and battle over
them.
Unfortunately, the phrase, "to
show a reasonable way," may
carry with it the connotation
that other expressions of con
cern are necessarily "unreason
able." This is hardly the inten
tion of the planning committee.
Our main interest is in pro
viding a context for communi
cation and reflections among
members of the Stanford-Palo
Alto communities who have con
cerns for peace in Vietnam. The
political impact and press cover
age which may or may not be
a result of the controversy is
secondary.

Editor, The Daily:
Monday's column by "Herbie
Hinckes," states that "fearless
Dean of Students Joel Smith
decided (Jack) Gerson had taken
enough time at the door. Joel
pushed the student roughly, try
ing to force the student out"
(the front door of Encina dur
ing the CIA demonstration).
As a witness to the same in

lieve that Gerson would have
failed to mention having been
roughed up by the dean, if this
in fact was the case. Gerson
made no such charge in his short
talk on the bullhorn immediately
after leaving the building.
When I called Gerson Monday
afternoon and asked him about
"Hinckes" account, he said:
"Thats' nonsense. I don't remem
ber being pushed out the door."
"Hinckes" did not mention the
fact that the poster which was
shoved through the front door

Dean Smith's head — a fact
which "Hinckes" was not in a

• Arab Appeal
Editor, The Daily:
The "Appeal for Israel" (The
Daily, Oct. 26) is an ignominous
commentary on the perception
of truth and justice by Ameri
cans, particularly its men of
learning.
Justice, morality, and con
science, whose only beneficiaries
would be the Arabs, have been
invoked again to blackmail
American conscience.
The call for direct negotiations
is unacceptable to the Arabs as
it implies:
1. Condoning a Western set
tler-colonialist group which de
nies the indigenous people even
the right of physical exis
tence in their own homes.
2. Rejection of United Nations
authority and its more than 250
Resolutions, including the U.N.
1947 Partition Plan delineating
the extent of Israel territory
(which itself was denial to
Arabs their right of self-deter
mination.)
3. Consolidation of Israeli ex
pansion through aggressions in
1948, 1956, and 1957.
King Husain's statement to

the U.N. General Assembly on
June 6 should be a required read
ing. He said: "... should the
return of all our lands be delay
ed any longer and should all
traces of aggression which be
gan on 5 June not be completely
erased, Jordan will still survive.
Ground down by sorrow for the
moment, we will rise again. And
with us will arise the Arab Na
tion."
We are witnessing today the
reawakening of over 700 million
Arabs and Muslims along with
other uncounted millions who be
lieve in the justice of the Arab
cause.

• Political Rostrum?
Editor, The Daily:
The pulpit of our campus has
become a political soap box es
pousing a point of view which
goes beyond the ethics of our
country's foreign policy. No one
would argue that the war in
Vietnam is good or just. Far
from it. But realize the limita
tion of ethical boundaries as the
solution to all problems.
The "Sermon" by the Dean of
the Chapel in Memorial Church
on Sunday was a one-sided po
litical speech, not a sermon.
Should the campus church de
cide to take the path of elevat
ing politics over Christianity,
then I firmly believe that equal
time for rebuttal from the pul
pit should be given for the op
posing political point of view.
Though "peace" is congruent
with Judeo - Christian ethic,
"peace at any price" is a philo
sophy which cannot be substan
tiated on the same grounds.

• Intrinsic Value
Editor, The Daily:
The interesting article by Rob
in Knight on current student at
titudes toward the Peace Corps
(Friday, October 20) was dis
heartening to me. For those op
posed to the war in Vietnam to
decline to volunteer for Peace
Corps service as a means
of indicating their disapproval
of the current administration's
policies may have ideological ap

peal, but its human consequences
could be harsh.
For example, Peace Corps
programs have recently begun
for Tonga and Samoa. I have
had the opportunity to observe
the conditions that led those
Polynesian nations to ask for
Peace Corps help. I have also
had the opportunity to talk with
some of the ex-volunteers now
serving as the Washington staff
responsible for planning the op
erations, which are just now
getting well underway.
The dedication and perception
of those doing the planning is
evident and impressive. The need
of the islanders for some ex
ternal help with hygiene, basic
education, and agricultural devel
opment on a strictly local level
is also clear. The economic and
social problems created by ex
plosive population growth and
rising expectations in these is
land groups with limited resour
ces will exist and intensify re
gardless of the course of events
in Vietnam.
The Peace Corps operations
have intrinsic worth. Their value
to the people directly involved
does not depend upon coordina
tion with wars elsewhere. Would
anything of lasting value be
gained by abandoning the whole
field of foreign service to the
armed forces?

(2) Further, a unilateral with
drawal, no matter how desir
able it may seem, would have
diplomatic repercussions far be
yond the Far Eastern situation
—it would paralyze the regular
pattern of world diplomatic ac
tivity, which has reached some
what of a tense great power
stability in spite of the ominous
questionmark of U.S.-China re
lations. Precipitous, unilateral
withdrawal would create a cha
otic power vacuum, complete
confusion, and thus infinitely
greater chance of World War
and annihilation.
(3) The consequences of tak
ing a precipitous action, it
seems to me, surpass those of
not acting or of taking a more
reasonable course of action, and
indeed obliviate the dialectical
cant of those who would argue
that to rebuild (American for
eign policy), we must first tear
down (the current policy). De
sirable as that may seem to
some, the reality of the Pan
dora's Box that would open up
is more important than some
one's revolutionary purity or
self-indulgent conscience.
These are the issues at stake
on Wednesday. To those who
would argue that some action is
better than none at all, I hope
the logic of my third point an
swers your anguish—for this
essentially undirected Proposi
tion of Protest is one whose
consequences could do much to
completely destroy any effective
action or dissent.

Editor, the Daily:
As members of the planning
committee for the Convocation
for Peace this Saturday, we
were rather surprised at the
wording of the LASSU resolu
tion calling for support of the
"peace vigil." We would like to
allay any misconceptions about
the purpose and intent of the

gathering which may stem from
the tone of the resolution.
The meeting Is conceived not
as a protest utilizing some par
ticular tactic. It is to be an op
portunity for individuals at all
different stages of commitment
and concern to come together to
discuss and share their feelings
—not to debate and battle over
them.
Unfortunately, the phrase, "to
show a reasonable way," may
carry with it the connotation
that other expressions of con

able." This is hardly the inten

Our main interest is in pro

cation and reflections among
members of the Stanford-Palo
Alto communities who have con
cerns for peace in Vietnam. The
political impact and press cover

• Nonsense
Editor, The Daily:
Monday's column by "Herbie
Hinckes," states that "fearless
Dean of Students Joel Smith
decided (Jack) Gerson had taken
enough time at the door. Joel
pushed the student roughly, try
ing to force the student out"
(the front door of Encina dur
ing the CIA demonstration).
As a witness to the same in

lieve that Gerson would have
failed to mention having been
roughed up by the dean, if this
in fact was the case. Gerson
made no such charge in his short
talk on the bullhorn immediately
after leaving the building.
When I called Gerson Monday
afternoon and asked him about
"Hinckes" account, he said:
"Thats' nonsense. I don't remem

"Hinckes" did not mention the
fact that the poster which was
shoved through the front door

Dean Smith's head — a fact
which "Hinckes" was not in a

• Arab Appeal
Editor, The Daily:
The "Appeal for Israel" (The
Daily, Oct. 26) is an ignominous
commentary on the perception
of truth and justice by Ameri
cans, particularly its men of
learning.
Justice, morality, and con
science, whose only beneficiaries
would be the Arabs, have been
invoked again to blackmail
American conscience.
The call for direct negotiations
is unacceptable to the Arabs as
it implies:
1. Condoning a Western set
tler-colonialist group which de
nies the indigenous people even
the right of physical exis
tence in their own homes.
2. Rejection of United Nations
authority and its more than 250
Resolutions, including the U.N.
1947 Partition Plan delineating
the extent of Israel territory
(which itself was denial to
Arabs their right of self-deter
mination.)
3. Consolidation of Israeli ex
pansion through aggressions in
1948, 1956, and 1957.
King Husain's statement to

the U.N. General Assembly on
June 6 should be a required read
ing. He said: "... should the
return of all our lands be delay
ed any longer and should all
traces of aggression which be
gan on 5 June not be completely
erased, Jordan will still survive.
Ground down by sorrow for the
moment, we will rise again. And
with us will arise the Arab Na
tion."
We are witnessing today the
reawakening of over 700 million
Arabs and Muslims along with
other uncounted millions who be
lieve in the justice of the Arab
cause.

• Political Rostrum?
Editor, The Daily:
The pulpit of our campus has
become a political soap box es
pousing a point of view which
goes beyond the ethics of our
country's foreign policy. No one
would argue that the war in
Vietnam is good or just. Far
from it. But realize the limita
tion of ethical boundaries as the
solution to all problems.
The "Sermon" by the Dean of
the Chapel in Memorial Church
on Sunday was a one-sided po
litical speech, not a sermon.
Should the campus church de
cide to take the path of elevat
ing politics over Christianity,
then I firmly believe that equal
time for rebuttal from the pul
pit should be given for the op
posing political point of view.
Though "peace" is congruent
with Judeo - Christian ethic,
"peace at any price" is a philo
sophy which cannot be substan
tiated on the same grounds.

• Intrinsic Value
Editor, The Daily:
The interesting article by Rob
in Knight on current student at
titudes toward the Peace Corps
(Friday, October 20) was dis
heartening to me. For those op
posed to the war in Vietnam to
decline to volunteer for Peace
Corps service as a means
of indicating their disapproval
of the current administration's
policies may have ideological ap

peal, but its human consequences
could be harsh.
For example, Peace Corps
programs have recently begun
for Tonga and Samoa. I have
had the opportunity to observe
the conditions that led those
Polynesian nations to ask for
Peace Corps help. I have also
had the opportunity to talk with
some of the ex-volunteers now
serving as the Washington staff
responsible for planning the op
erations, which are just now
getting well underway.
The dedication and perception
of those doing the planning is
evident and impressive. The need
of the islanders for some ex
ternal help with hygiene, basic
education, and agricultural devel
opment on a strictly local level
is also clear. The economic and
social problems created by ex
plosive population growth and
rising expectations in these is
land groups with limited resour
ces will exist and intensify re
gardless of the course of events
in Vietnam.
The Peace Corps operations
have intrinsic worth. Their value
to the people directly involved
does not depend upon coordina
tion with wars elsewhere. Would
anything of lasting value be
gained by abandoning the whole
field of foreign service to the
armed forces?

• Really Existing?
Editor, The Dally:
That Monday, when I left my
draft card at the Federal Build
ing in San Francisco, I began
to exist. It only then hit me how
true what I have been telling
myself for six months really is:
that whatever I believe is mean
ingless unless I live it. I am
dealt with as a statistic because
I do not choose to become a
person. But now I have begun
to create my own identity, not
the one my parents would like
to give me, that Stanford would
like me to have, or that the gov
ernment would like me to com
ply with.
It has been too easy at Stan
ford to be absorbed in making
the Dean's List and Cum Laude,
in hermit scholarship, all of
which is detached from the kill
ing and maiming that goes on
and on and on. In our name.
It has been too easy to think
that the wrong done by the sys
tem happens because the wrong
people are in power, quite miss
ing the point that the wrong will
always exist so long as that cen
tralized power is made possible.
Yet, one does not have to
leave Stanford to confront the
forces that seek to control and
use us. There is a great deal to
be done right here.
The question is, when will you
begin to exist? When will you
begin to create your own iden

If our friend the waiter shaves

On Wednesday, November 8,

will be asked to support or
reject San Francisco Proposi

policy referendum. Proposition
P calls for "an immediate cease
fire and withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Vietnam so that the
Vietnamese people can solve
their own problems."
Many Stanford students deep
ly concerned about the nature
of American commitment to
South Vietnam or about the de
gree of our involvement there,
or both, should examine care
fully the implications of this
Proposition:
(1) It is not simply a "yes-no"
vote on current American policy.
Rather, it calls only for immedi
ate ceasefire and withdrawal —
such a policy of unconditional,
unnegotiated, and thus precipi
tous withdrawal is opposed by
such distinguished war critics as
Senators Fulbright, Kennedy,
Hatfield, General Gavin, and
George Kennan.
(2) Further, a unilateral with

• Arab Appeal
Editor, The Daily:
The "Appeal for Israel" (The
Daily, Oct. 26) is an ignominous
commentary on the perception
of truth and justice by Ameri
cans, particularly its men of
learning.
Justice, morality, and con
science, whose only beneficiaries
would be the Arabs, have been
invoked again to blackmail
American conscience.
The call for direct negotiations
is unacceptable to the Arabs as
it implies:
1. Condoning a Western set
tler-colonialist group which de
nies the indigenous people even
the right of physical exis
tence in their own homes.
2. Rejection of United Nations
authority and its more than 250
Resolutions, including the U.N.
1947 Partition Plan delineating
the extent of Israel territory
(which itself was denial to
Arabs their right of self-deter
mination.)
3. Consolidation of Israeli ex
pansion through aggressions in
1948, 1956, and 1957.
King Husain's statement to

the U.N. General Assembly on
June 6 should be a required read
ing. He said: "... should the
return of all our lands be delay
ed any longer and should all
traces of aggression which be
gan on 5 June not be completely
erased, Jordan will still survive.
Ground down by sorrow for the
moment, we will rise again. And
with us will arise the Arab Na
tion."
We are witnessing today the
reawakening of over 700 million
Arabs and Muslims along with
other uncounted millions who be
lieve in the justice of the Arab
cause.

• Political Rostrum?
Editor, The Daily:
The pulpit of our campus has
become a political soap box es
pousing a point of view which
goes beyond the ethics of our
country's foreign policy. No one
would argue that the war in
Vietnam is good or just. Far
from it. But realize the limita
tion of ethical boundaries as the
solution to all problems.
The "Sermon" by the Dean of
the Chapel in Memorial Church
on Sunday was a one-sided po
litical speech, not a sermon.
Should the campus church de
cide to take the path of elevat
ing politics over Christianity,
then I firmly believe that equal
time for rebuttal from the pul
pit should be given for the op

Though "peace" is congruent
with Judeo - Christian ethic,
"peace at any price" is a philo

• Intrinsic Value
Editor, The Daily:
The interesting article by Rob
in Knight on current student at
titudes toward the Peace Corps
(Friday, October 20) was dis
heartening to me. For those op
posed to the war in Vietnam to
decline to volunteer for Peace
Corps service as a means
of indicating their disapproval
of the current administration's
policies may have ideological ap

peal, but its human consequences
could be harsh.
For example, Peace Corps
programs have recently begun
for Tonga and Samoa. I have
had the opportunity to observe
the conditions that led those
Polynesian nations to ask for
Peace Corps help. I have also
had the opportunity to talk with
some of the ex-volunteers now
serving as the Washington staff
responsible for planning the op
erations, which are just now
getting well underway.
The dedication and perception
of those doing the planning is
evident and impressive. The need
of the islanders for some ex
ternal help with hygiene, basic
education, and agricultural devel
opment on a strictly local level
is also clear. The economic and
social problems created by ex
plosive population growth and
rising expectations in these is
land groups with limited resour
ces will exist and intensify re
gardless of the course of events
in Vietnam.
The Peace Corps operations
have intrinsic worth. Their value
to the people directly involved
does not depend upon coordina
tion with wars elsewhere. Would
anything of lasting value be
gained by abandoning the whole
field of foreign service to the
armed forces?

• Really Existing?
Editor, The Dally:
That Monday, when I left my
draft card at the Federal Build
ing in San Francisco, I began
to exist. It only then hit me how
true what I have been telling
myself for six months really is:
that whatever I believe is mean
ingless unless I live it. I am
dealt with as a statistic because
I do not choose to become a
person. But now I have begun
to create my own identity, not
the one my parents would like
to give me, that Stanford would
like me to have, or that the gov
ernment would like me to com
ply with.
It has been too easy at Stan
ford to be absorbed in making
the Dean's List and Cum Laude,
in hermit scholarship, all of
which is detached from the kill
ing and maiming that goes on
and on and on. In our name.
It has been too easy to think
that the wrong done by the sys
tem happens because the wrong
people are in power, quite miss
ing the point that the wrong will
always exist so long as that cen
tralized power is made possible.
Yet, one does not have to
leave Stanford to confront the
forces that seek to control and
use us. There is a great deal to
be done right here.
The question is, when will you
begin to exist? When will you
begin to create your own iden

• Beards No Problem
Editor, The Daily:
What's the big deal? I pick
up a Daily and the first thing
I see is a story about a guy
who doesn't get a job because
he has a beard. So what! I was
dismissed from a job in a library
language laboratory, because
I'm black; I couldn't find a suit
able place to live, because I'm
black!
If our friend the waiter shaves

ho has a job. But what about my
lab job and what about a place
for me to live? All the shaving
cream on earth can't help me
get the lab job back.
So if anyone wants to know
if there is any discrimination
on Stanford's campus ask the
bearded waiter and then ask me.
MERNOY HARRISON
Junior, Industrial Eng.
Editor, the Daily:
On Wednesday, November 8,
the Stanford student community
will be asked to support or
reject San Francisco Proposi
tion P, the so-called Vietnam
policy referendum. Proposition
P calls for "an immediate cease
fire and withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Vietnam so that the
Vietnamese people can solve
their own problems."
Many Stanford students deep
ly concerned about the nature
of American commitment to
South Vietnam or about the de
gree of our involvement there,
or both, should examine care
fully the implications of this
Proposition:
(1) It is not simply a "yes-no"
vote on current American policy.
Rather, it calls only for immedi
ate ceasefire and withdrawal —
such a policy of unconditional,
unnegotiated, and thus precipi
tous withdrawal is opposed by
such distinguished war critics as
Senators Fulbright, Kennedy,
Hatfield, General Gavin, and
George Kennan.
(2) Further, a unilateral with
drawal, no matter how desir
able it may seem, would have
diplomatic repercussions far be
yond the Far Eastern situation
—it would paralyze the regular
pattern of world diplomatic ac
tivity, which has reached some
what of a tense great power
stability in spite of the ominous
questionmark of U.S.-China re
lations. Precipitous, unilateral
withdrawal would create a cha
otic power vacuum, complete
confusion, and thus infinitely
greater chance of World War
and annihilation.
(3) The consequences of tak
ing a precipitous action, it
seems to me, surpass those of
not acting or of taking a more
reasonable course of action, and
indeed obliviate the dialectical
cant of those who would argue
that to rebuild (American for
eign policy), we must first tear
down (the current policy). De
sirable as that may seem to
some, the reality of the Pan
dora's Box that would open up
is more important than some
one's revolutionary purity or
self-indulgent conscience.
These are the issues at stake
on Wednesday. To those who
would argue that some action is
better than none at all, I hope
the logic of my third point an
swers your anguish—for this
essentially undirected Proposi
tion of Protest is one whose
consequences could do much to
completely destroy any effective
action or dissent.

Editor, the Daily:
As members of the planning
committee for the Convocation
for Peace this Saturday, we
were rather surprised at the
wording of the LASSU resolu
tion calling for support of the
"peace vigil." We would like to
allay any misconceptions about
the purpose and intent of the

gathering which may stem from
the tone of the resolution.
The meeting Is conceived not
as a protest utilizing some par
ticular tactic. It is to be an op
portunity for individuals at all
different stages of commitment
and concern to come together to
discuss and share their feelings
—not to debate and battle over
them.
Unfortunately, the phrase, "to
show a reasonable way," may
carry with it the connotation
that other expressions of con
cern are necessarily "unreason
able." This is hardly the inten
tion of the planning committee.
Our main interest is in pro
viding a context for communi
cation and reflections among
members of the Stanford-Palo
Alto communities who have con
cerns for peace in Vietnam. The
political impact and press cover

a result of the controversy is

• Intrinsic Value
Editor, The Daily:
The interesting article by Rob
in Knight on current student at
titudes toward the Peace Corps
(Friday, October 20) was dis
heartening to me. For those op
posed to the war in Vietnam to
decline to volunteer for Peace
Corps service as a means
of indicating their disapproval
of the current administration's
policies may have ideological ap

peal, but its human consequences
could be harsh.
For example, Peace Corps
programs have recently begun
for Tonga and Samoa. I have
had the opportunity to observe
the conditions that led those
Polynesian nations to ask for
Peace Corps help. I have also
had the opportunity to talk with
some of the ex-volunteers now
serving as the Washington staff
responsible for planning the op
erations, which are just now
getting well underway.
The dedication and perception
of those doing the planning is
evident and impressive. The need
of the islanders for some ex
ternal help with hygiene, basic
education, and agricultural devel
opment on a strictly local level
is also clear. The economic and
social problems created by ex
plosive population growth and
rising expectations in these is
land groups with limited resour
ces will exist and intensify re
gardless of the course of events
in Vietnam.
The Peace Corps operations
have intrinsic worth. Their value
to the people directly involved
does not depend upon coordina
tion with wars elsewhere. Would
anything of lasting value be
gained by abandoning the whole
field of foreign service to the
armed forces?

• Really Existing?
Editor, The Dally:
That Monday, when I left my
draft card at the Federal Build
ing in San Francisco, I began
to exist. It only then hit me how
true what I have been telling
myself for six months really is:
that whatever I believe is mean
ingless unless I live it. I am
dealt with as a statistic because
I do not choose to become a
person. But now I have begun
to create my own identity, not
the one my parents would like
to give me, that Stanford would
like me to have, or that the gov
ernment would like me to com
ply with.
It has been too easy at Stan
ford to be absorbed in making
the Dean's List and Cum Laude,
in hermit scholarship, all of
which is detached from the kill
ing and maiming that goes on
and on and on. In our name.
It has been too easy to think
that the wrong done by the sys
tem happens because the wrong
people are in power, quite miss
ing the point that the wrong will
always exist so long as that cen
tralized power is made possible.
Yet, one does not have to
leave Stanford to confront the
forces that seek to control and
use us. There is a great deal to
be done right here.
The question is, when will you
begin to exist? When will you
begin to create your own iden
tity and cease to be defined sole
ly by the institutions that envel
ope you?

• LASSU Snafu
Editor, The Daily:
Friday's article on LASSU was
very well written, but it omit
ted mention of a fairly signi
ficant item; as well, it made two
factual errors.
First, it was Arnette Cole

man, one of the kings of jazz
(not "Nat Coleman" as report
ed), who cancelled his appear
ance here because of racial dis
crimination.
More important, LASSU in
structed that a committee inves
tigate the nature of the discrim
ination. LASSU has no inten
tion of sweeping this incident
under the rug as the omission
of this in The Daily implied.
Last, the "Dennis Rutkins"
appointed to the special commit
tee on community government
is in fact Steve Rutkus.

• Beards No Problem
Editor, The Daily:
What's the big deal? I pick
up a Daily and the first thing
I see is a story about a guy
who doesn't get a job because
he has a beard. So what! I was
dismissed from a job in a library
language laboratory, because
I'm black; I couldn't find a suit
able place to live, because I'm
black!
If our friend the waiter shaves

ho has a job. But what about my
lab job and what about a place
for me to live? All the shaving
cream on earth can't help me
get the lab job back.
So if anyone wants to know
if there is any discrimination
on Stanford's campus ask the
bearded waiter and then ask me.

Editor, the Daily:
On Wednesday, November 8,
the Stanford student community
will be asked to support or
reject San Francisco Proposi
tion P, the so-called Vietnam
policy referendum. Proposition
P calls for "an immediate cease
fire and withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Vietnam so that the
Vietnamese people can solve
their own problems."
Many Stanford students deep
ly concerned about the nature
of American commitment to
South Vietnam or about the de
gree of our involvement there,
or both, should examine care
fully the implications of this
Proposition:
(1) It is not simply a "yes-no"
vote on current American policy.
Rather, it calls only for immedi
ate ceasefire and withdrawal —
such a policy of unconditional,
unnegotiated, and thus precipi
tous withdrawal is opposed by
such distinguished war critics as
Senators Fulbright, Kennedy,
Hatfield, General Gavin, and
George Kennan.
(2) Further, a unilateral with
drawal, no matter how desir
able it may seem, would have
diplomatic repercussions far be
yond the Far Eastern situation
—it would paralyze the regular
pattern of world diplomatic ac
tivity, which has reached some
what of a tense great power
stability in spite of the ominous
questionmark of U.S.-China re
lations. Precipitous, unilateral
withdrawal would create a cha
otic power vacuum, complete
confusion, and thus infinitely
greater chance of World War
and annihilation.
(3) The consequences of tak
ing a precipitous action, it
seems to me, surpass those of
not acting or of taking a more
reasonable course of action, and
indeed obliviate the dialectical
cant of those who would argue
that to rebuild (American for
eign policy), we must first tear
down (the current policy). De
sirable as that may seem to
some, the reality of the Pan
dora's Box that would open up
is more important than some
one's revolutionary purity or
self-indulgent conscience.
These are the issues at stake
on Wednesday. To those who
would argue that some action is
better than none at all, I hope
the logic of my third point an
swers your anguish—for this
essentially undirected Proposi
tion of Protest is one whose
consequences could do much to
completely destroy any effective
action or dissent.

• Maintain Dignity
Editor, the Daily:
What good has all the open
discussion on Viet-nam on the
Stanford campus done? Are we
to express monolithically a sim
plistic answer to a complex
problem—without any hint of

characteristic of a university
community? A yes vote on Prop
osition P would be but another
blow to the dignity of Stanford

• Pressing It
Editor, the Daily:
As members of the planning
committee for the Convocation
for Peace this Saturday, we
were rather surprised at the
wording of the LASSU resolu
tion calling for support of the
"peace vigil." We would like to
allay any misconceptions about
the purpose and intent of the

gathering which may stem from
the tone of the resolution.
The meeting Is conceived not
as a protest utilizing some par
ticular tactic. It is to be an op
portunity for individuals at all
different stages of commitment
and concern to come together to
discuss and share their feelings
—not to debate and battle over
them.
Unfortunately, the phrase, "to
show a reasonable way," may
carry with it the connotation
that other expressions of con
cern are necessarily "unreason
able." This is hardly the inten
tion of the planning committee.
Our main interest is in pro
viding a context for communi
cation and reflections among
members of the Stanford-Palo
Alto communities who have con
cerns for peace in Vietnam. The
political impact and press cover
age which may or may not be
a result of the controversy is
secondary.

• Nonsense
Editor, The Daily:
Monday's column by "Herbie
Hinckes," states that "fearless
Dean of Students Joel Smith
decided (Jack) Gerson had taken
enough time at the door. Joel
pushed the student roughly, try
ing to force the student out"
(the front door of Encina dur
ing the CIA demonstration).
As a witness to the same in
cident, I found it difficult to be
lieve that Gerson would have
failed to mention having been
roughed up by the dean, if this
in fact was the case. Gerson
made no such charge in his short
talk on the bullhorn immediately
after leaving the building.
When I called Gerson Monday
afternoon and asked him about
"Hinckes" account, he said:
"Thats' nonsense. I don't remem
ber being pushed out the door."
"Hinckes" did not mention the
fact that the poster which was
shoved through the front door
opening after Gerson left grazed
Dean Smith's head — a fact
which "Hinckes" was not in a
position to witness personally.

(My apologies to Dean of Stu
dents Joel Smith for saying he
pushed Jack Gerson. I was stand

But since Gerson denies it, I
must be wrong. I will try to get
an appointment with an eye doc

• Arab Appeal
Editor, The Daily:
The "Appeal for Israel" (The
Daily, Oct. 26) is an ignominous
commentary on the perception
of truth and justice by Ameri
cans, particularly its men of
learning.
Justice, morality, and con
science, whose only beneficiaries
would be the Arabs, have been
invoked again to blackmail
American conscience.
The call for direct negotiations
is unacceptable to the Arabs as
it implies:
1. Condoning a Western set
tler-colonialist group which de
nies the indigenous people even
the right of physical exis
tence in their own homes.
2. Rejection of United Nations
authority and its more than 250
Resolutions, including the U.N.
1947 Partition Plan delineating
the extent of Israel territory
(which itself was denial to
Arabs their right of self-deter
mination.)
3. Consolidation of Israeli ex
pansion through aggressions in
1948, 1956, and 1957.
King Husain's statement to

the U.N. General Assembly on
June 6 should be a required read
ing. He said: "... should the
return of all our lands be delay
ed any longer and should all
traces of aggression which be
gan on 5 June not be completely
erased, Jordan will still survive.
Ground down by sorrow for the
moment, we will rise again. And
with us will arise the Arab Na
tion."
We are witnessing today the
reawakening of over 700 million
Arabs and Muslims along with
other uncounted millions who be
lieve in the justice of the Arab
cause.

• Political Rostrum?
Editor, The Daily:
The pulpit of our campus has
become a political soap box es
pousing a point of view which
goes beyond the ethics of our
country's foreign policy. No one
would argue that the war in
Vietnam is good or just. Far
from it. But realize the limita
tion of ethical boundaries as the
solution to all problems.
The "Sermon" by the Dean of
the Chapel in Memorial Church
on Sunday was a one-sided po
litical speech, not a sermon.
Should the campus church de
cide to take the path of elevat
ing politics over Christianity,
then I firmly believe that equal
time for rebuttal from the pul
pit should be given for the op
posing political point of view.
Though "peace" is congruent
with Judeo - Christian ethic,
"peace at any price" is a philo
sophy which cannot be substan
tiated on the same grounds.

be done right here.
The question is, when will you
begin to exist? When will you
begin to create your own iden
tity and cease to be defined sole
ly by the institutions that envel
ope you?

• LASSU Snafu
Editor, The Daily:
Friday's article on LASSU was
very well written, but it omit
ted mention of a fairly signi
ficant item; as well, it made two
factual errors.
First, it was Arnette Cole

man, one of the kings of jazz
(not "Nat Coleman" as report
ed), who cancelled his appear
ance here because of racial dis
crimination.
More important, LASSU in
structed that a committee inves
tigate the nature of the discrim
ination. LASSU has no inten
tion of sweeping this incident
under the rug as the omission
of this in The Daily implied.
Last, the "Dennis Rutkins"
appointed to the special commit
tee on community government
is in fact Steve Rutkus.

• Beards No Problem
Editor, The Daily:
What's the big deal? I pick
up a Daily and the first thing
I see is a story about a guy
who doesn't get a job because
he has a beard. So what! I was
dismissed from a job in a library
language laboratory, because
I'm black; I couldn't find a suit
able place to live, because I'm
black!
If our friend the waiter shaves

ho has a job. But what about my
lab job and what about a place
for me to live? All the shaving
cream on earth can't help me
get the lab job back.
So if anyone wants to know
if there is any discrimination
on Stanford's campus ask the
bearded waiter and then ask me.
