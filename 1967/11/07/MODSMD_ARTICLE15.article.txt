# Forty In Family Come To Stanford
## 
### STEVE TOLLEFSON 
Back in the first class to com
plete four years at Stanford
was a young Easterner —Carl
Smith. And Carl Smith started
something that Stanford hasn't
been able to get rid of since. He
was the founder of a generation
of people who have educated
and been educated at Stanford.
Soon after he graduated, Mr.
Smith, not wanting to be known
by such a common name as
"Smith," changed his surname
to "Carlsmith." This is the
name that his decendents still
bear.
The latest of the Carlsmiths
at Stanford is Dr. J. Merrill
Carlsmith, Assistant Professor
of Psychology. Dr. Carlsmith
attended Stanford as an under
graduate and has been teaching
here for the past four years.
He is also a member of the SES
Commission on Admissions. His
uncle, Bob Sears, is Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences, and his
aunt, Pat Sears, teaches educa
tion here.
Forty Graduated
Nearly forty people from this
amazing family have attended
Stanford. They have become
prominent in education and oth
er fields.
All four of Dr. Carlsmith's
grandparents attended Stanford
in its first years as a University.
One of his grandfathers was a
founder of something else that
Stanford hasn't been able to get
rid of—The Stanford Daily. One
of them also returned to teach
education here.
Both of his parents attended
Stanford, as well as several of
his mother's seven and his
father's four brothers and sis
ters.
Gone On Further
Carlsmiths have not only dis
tinguished themselves at Stan
ford. Some have gone on to
graduate school at Harvard,

Yale, MIT, and Columbia. They
have taught — in addition to
those at Stanford —at UCLA,
Columbia, Cal. Medical School,
and Harvard. Several are mem
bers of the law firm of Carl
smith, Carlsmith, and Carlsmith
located in Hawaii.
Why have so many of these
people attended Stanford? An
swers Dr. Carlsmith, "Each has
come for his own reasons, I
guess."
What is the future of the
"Carlsmith Dynasty?" It looks
as though another one will be
entering as a freshman next
year.
After that, who knows?
