# Apathy Stymies Union

### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Apattfy among student body
presidents at campuses in the
Bay has temporarily squel
eched ambitious plans for a
multi-campus student union.
Weinstein, speaker of
Stanfordis student legislature,
canceled a mLfTTVig to discuss
his plan for a "Bay Area Student
Association." Instead he sent
a letter last week to the student
body presidents proposing a "re
gional coordinating committee"
to arrange cut-rate tours of en
tertainers and speakers.
"It is quite evident that if
schools share cultural programs,
the costs of such programs to
the individual campus will be
greatly reduced," Weinstein
writes. Other services such as
student discounts could be ar

ranged by the committee, he
believes.
On visits to student legisla
tures throughout the Bay Area,
Weinstein will propose that one
representative from each of
more than 20 schools compose
the committee. On any particu
lar program, a school's partici
pation would be completely vol
untary.
Weinstein said his strategic
retreat to the coordinating com
mittee scheme was suggested by
student leaders at Berkeley,
Mills, Menlo College and Santa
Clara.
"The original suggestion for
a Bay Area Student Associa
tion," according to Weinstein,
"called for individual member
ship and thus individual dues.
While this type of structure has

several advantages, the lack of
favorable response indicates that
such an organization is current
ly impossible in the Bay Area."
Weinstein indicated the cool
ness of student leaders to the ini
tial BASA proposals reflected
the radical overtones of such
an organization and the abstract
ness of the benefits it promised.
In lobbying for his less revo
lutionary cultural cooperative,
Weinstein is stressing the prac
tical, dollars-and-cents advant
ages.
"The economies that can be re
alized in transportation and
other costs by sharing programs
among the several schools in the
area will allow all schools, both
large and small, to sponsor pro
grams that they would not nor
mally be able to finance," he
writes.

the committee. On any particu
lar program, a school's partici
pation would be completely vol
untary.
Weinstein said his strategic
retreat to the coordinating com
mittee scheme was suggested by
student leaders at Berkeley,
Mills, Menlo College and Santa
Clara.
"The original suggestion for
a Bay Area Student Associa
tion," according to Weinstein,
"called for individual member
ship and thus individual dues.
While this type of structure has

several advantages, the lack of
favorable response indicates that
such an organization is current
ly impossible in the Bay Area."
Weinstein indicated the cool
ness of student leaders to the ini
tial BASA proposals reflected
the radical overtones of such
an organization and the abstract
ness of the benefits it promised.
In lobbying for his less revo
lutionary cultural cooperative,
Weinstein is stressing the prac
tical, dollars-and-cents advant
ages.
"The economies that can be re
alized in transportation and
other costs by sharing programs
among the several schools in the
area will allow all schools, both
large and small, to sponsor pro
grams that they would not nor
mally be able to finance," he
writes.
