# Search For Jacks Professor Continues After Three Years
## 
### 
For three years the position
on the David Jacks Professor
ship of Higher Education has
not been filled.
The Jacks chair is one of the
several endowed professorships
at Stanford. Dr. W. H. Cowley
of the Department of Education
accepted the position nearly
twenty years ago. Until his re
tirement from the position in
1964, Dr. Cowley remained one
of the first professors of higher
education in the country. Com
parable to other departments of
education, the study of higher
education is a relatively new
field.
A committee of faculty and
administration, headed by Dr.
Arthur Coladarci, Associate
Dean of the School of Educa
tion, has been evaluating appli
cations for the position.

Dr. Coladarci stated that his
committee is seeking applicants
from almost any background
"who have an interest in the
study of higher education." The
committee is studying applica
tions from persons in fields such
as sociology, economics, law an
thropology, and history.
"We hope to get the person's
name this year," he stated. Oth
er members of the committee
include Dean James of the
school of Education, Professor
David M. Potter of American
History, Associate Provost Hu
bert Heffner, and Professor
John D. Krumboltz, professor of
education and psychology.
The historical background of
the Jacks family, who have en
dowed several professorships at
Stanford, dates back to 1849 to
the days of the gold rush in
Monterey.
