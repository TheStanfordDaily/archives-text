# SF State 'Gater'
## Staff Attacked, Beaten 
### RENTON ROLPH 
A dozen young Negro men in
vaded the San Francisco State
College newspaper Monday, se
verely beat the editor, manhand
led other staff members and
wrecked office furnishings.
The victims said at least some
of the attacking group were
members of the three-year-old
Black Student Union.
Jim Vaszko, editor of The
Golden Gater, was hospitalized
with possible internal injuries
from kicks and with severe

bruises from blows about his
face. Lynn Ludlow, San Franci
sco Examiner staff writer who
is part-time instructor at the
college, suffered a broken finger
in the melee. Several other stu
dent staff members sustained
minor injuries.
No Explanation
The newspaper's staff was at
a loss to explain the cause of
the incident which was over in
five minutes. James Loveland,
the Gater managing editor, was
"shocked and amazed" by the

attack, noting that his paper's
past coverage of the Black Stu
dent Union was "particularly un
biased." However, late last night
it developed that "there had ap
parently been some ill-feeling
about a delay in running a pic
ture of the homecoming queen
candidate sponsored by the
Black Student Union." City Edit
or Dan Moore commented that
the picture had been contributed
tardily.
Moore recounted the incident:
Vaszko was on the telephone
when the men walked into the
office. It was obvious that they
wanted to speak with the editor
who interrupted his conversa
tion twice to tell them that he
was busy on the phone. One of
them then yanked the receiver
from Vaszko's hand and said,
"Man, we want to talk to you."
Then several of them started to
hit and then kick Vaszko.
Another Attack?
Managing Editor Loveland in
dicated late yesterday afternoon
that the paper was fearful that
the violent attack might be re
peated. To prevent this a po
lice guard was stationed last
night to protect the Gater office.
College President John Sum
merskill also asked police to
investigate and said the attack
ers were being identified by wit
nesses and by photographs
taken by staff members during
the brief assault.
