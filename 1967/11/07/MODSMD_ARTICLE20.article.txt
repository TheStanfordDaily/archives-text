# The
						Trick To Pom-Ponning
## Dollies Find Place For Fun 
### NICK SELBY 
As much a part of the Stan
ford sports scene as the athletes
themselves, the pom-pon girls
present an interesting question
as to the place of fun in an ath
letic community.
Why, it has been asked, would
anyone want to dance in a fancy
tunic before thousands of
screaming fans at a football or
basketball game?
The answer, many people have
said, is that it allows a pretty
girl a chance to be "Big Woman
on Campus." And they add that
pom-pon girls don't deserve such
attention in Stanford's scholarly
atmosphere.
Having Fun The Answer
Yet, a talk with this year's
pom-pon girls — Sue Beck, Sue
McCann, Sue Phillips, Nancy
Kerr, and Ellie Watkins — gives
an entirely different answer to
the question.
"I don't think people on this

campus worship pom-pon girls
at all," says Miss Watkins. "I
think we decided to become pom
pon girls to have fun and add
to school spirit."
"We know that school spirit
sounds corny," adds Miss Beck,
"but most people who say it's
meaningless refuse to do any
thing for the school."
Girl Scout Mentors
But developing school spirit
definitely takes a back seat
to having fun. Among the var
ious activities connected with
pom-ponning are luncheons, din
ners at freshman houses, and
even visits to local Girl Scout
troops.
The five girls showed the
scouts all the tricks to pom-pon
ning. "They wouldn't have cared
what we showed them if we
hadn't been pom-pon girls.
"That's the great thing to
this — just by being a pom-pon

girl you can make people so
happy," concludes Miss Kerr.
Love Those Wilbur Men
It seems that the highpoint
of each week is the meal with
freshman boys in Wilbur. "We
just love freshman boys," the
five girls say unanimously.
"They're so nice to us, and have
the most spirit on campus."
For three weeks before the
start of fall quarter, the five
girls lived with families in Palo
Alto, allowing them to get to
gether and practice their rou
tines. The families are "Stanford
families" to the Nth degree and
take on the girls every year.
All the girls say they made
lasting friendships with each
other and the families in the
short time.
A Steep Price
But if pom-ponning gives the
immeasurable benefits of friend
ships and fun, it does so at a
price. It requires at least ten
hours of practice and meetings
per week, plus time for rallies
and the athletic contests.
Most practice time is spent
with the band, but the girls also
work with the yell leaders.
All paraphenalia connected
with pom-ponning comes from
a $300 a quarter subsidy from
ASSU. But it rarely completely
covers the cost of tunics, sweat
ers, sneakers, and flowers, and

the rest comes from the girls'
pocketbooks.
When game time comes, the
girls say they are torn between
dancing for the crowd and watch
ing the game. "You can't follow
the game at all from field level,"
says Miss Phillips, "but then
we're very close to the players
and the action. We all get emo
tionally involved."
"We don't feel we have any
thing to do with the success of
the team, or that much to do
with exciting the fans," explains
Miss Kerr. "The band deserves
the credit for firing up the
crowd."
Excitement and cheers from
the crowd, however, do have a
big effect on the team compet
ing. Many of the football players
said the vocal support helped
them tremendously in the UCLA
game, a heart-breaker where
Stanford just missed winning in
the last seconds.
"The greatest part of pom-pon
ning is doing the half-time show
with the band," they all agreed.
Personal Effects
What effect does being a pom
pon girl have on their personal
lives? "We aren't filling any im
age of a perfect Stanford wom
an," they say, "and when it
comes to making a decision
which would reflect on the
school, we forget about being
pom-pon girls."
Whatever their private mis
givings about being pom-pon
girls, especially when close
friends have chided them for
pursuing such "empty" recrea
tion, pom-pon girls are not about
to minimize the value of the ex
perience.
"It's the first time I've ever

worked with a group so closely,"
says Miss Watkins. "I realize
now the sacrifice it takes to work
successfully with other people.
We've become very close friends.
There's so much more to pom
ponning than all the rah-rah
stuff."

while instead of trying to dance is Nancy Kerr, who sits on the Big
Bed Machine of cheerleader Norm Boone. The motorcycle action
took place before the UCLA game, and word has it that a complete
thrill show will transpire this Saturday before the Oregon game.
