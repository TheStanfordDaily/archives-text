# Cricket Team Bowls To Win Over Marin, Nor Cal Crown
## 
### 
Stanford did it again. For the
third successive year, the In
dian cricket team won the
Northern California League
Cricket Championship, the sym
bol of supremacy in Northern
California cricket play.
The Cards took this honor last
Sunday by soundly defeating
Marin Cricket Club by the wide
margin of 212-37 runs.
The Stanford total, accumu
lated through a hard hitting dis
play by the Tribe batsmen, was
the highest for all teams in the
league for the season.
Winston Severn was the lead
ing Tribe batsman, scoring a
"century" with 104 runs.
In turn, the low opposing
score was accounted for by the

devastating bowling perfor
mances put on by the three Stan
ford fast bowlers. Michael Bond,
Mark Feldman, and Horis Hurst
managed to befuddle the Marin
batsmen completely.
14 Of 17
In romping to their third
straight championship, the
Cards won 14 out of 17 matches.
"This has been a most satis
fying season," said captain Feld
man. "To start with we won the
six-a-side tourney; then the lea
gue championship, and if we
win next Sunday, in the finals
of the Price Cup elimination
competition, then we will have
bagged all that the Northern
California Cricket Association
has to offer."
This is the fifth year that Stan

ford has competed in the North
ern Cal cricket arena. During its
short but brilliant history, the
Card cricketers have won tro
phies in four out of five years.
On the strength of this per
formance, Stanford has estab
lished itself as one of the best
cricket teams in the country.
