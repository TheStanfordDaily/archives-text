# McCloskey:
## Cites Vietnam, City Problems 
### PAUL DeLIBAN 
City problems and Vietnam
were the main issues Paul N.
"Pete" McCloskey, Republican
congressional candidate, discus
sed yesterday before about 100
members of the Stanford com
munity.
He is running against Mrs.
Shirley Temple Black.
McCloskey, a graduate of both
Stanford and its law school, said
we should be sensitive to these
problems in the cities and not
sweep them under the rug.
The best government is the
least government, McCloskey be
lieves, citing education as an ex
ample of government ineffi
ciency. Four levels of govern
ment — city, county, state, and
federal — are all involved in
education.
He compared this to the inef
ficiency of a business run by
four sets of administrators. Only
one level of government should
concern itself with the problem,
McCloskey noted.
East Palo Alto was cited as a
potential trouble-spot. Residents
need a body that will consider
their grievances, he said. They
also need an incentive for self
government, and job-training. If
people own property, they tend
to avoid trouble, McCloskey
claimed.
He also feels that a tax-shar
ing program whereby income

taxes are returned to the com
munity in the form of direct
monetary grants would be an
other major solution to poverty
troubles.
McCloskey said that free en
terprise should have a more im
portant role in the Jobs Corps
program. Corps members could
receive tax and depreciation ben
efits as incentives for hiring Job
Corps people.
Our foreign policy is wrong,
McCloskey commented. He at
tacked three common defenses
of our presence in Vietnam.
Although the U.S. has fought
since 1954 to protect South
Vietnam from Communist inva
sion by the north, "We fight na
tionalism as much as we fight
Communism," McCloskey as
serts.
U.S. national security and the
containment of Communist
China are fallacious reasons for
being in Vietnam, he claims. A
united Communist Vietnam
would be no threat to us, he add
ed. Refugees from the Commu
nist government could resettle
in an area where their numeri
cal strength would discourage
Communist attack.
The congressional candidate
also berated faith in the admin
istration merely because it sup
posedly has the best qualified
personnel and best conception of
the situation.

He feels we should gradually
de-escalate the war to permit a
situation where the Vietnams
could unify and return to the
Geneva Conventions. McCloskey
feels we need not fear this type
of communist government.
Larger U.N. Role
For future "wars of national
liberation," the U.S. should care
fully consider each nation's sit
uation before determining a pol
icy, McCloskey said. Also, the
United Nations should play a
larger part in world peace main
tenance, he feels.
McCloskey believes that dem

onstrators "do not have the
right to take the law into their
own hands. "It is wrong to de
liberately violate federal law."
American respect for law and
order differentiates us from na
tions with a history of revolu
tions like Latin American states,
he claimed.
The major goal of this meet
ing was to recruit volunteers for
this weekend, according to
Woody Garnsey. He predicts
100-150 workers for the descent
on Daly City this weekend. Sign
up tables will be manned all
week on White Plaza.
