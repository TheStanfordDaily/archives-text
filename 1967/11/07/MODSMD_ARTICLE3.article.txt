# Peace Party Rallies

Barbara Garson called Presi
dent Johnson a "villain" yester
day, but quickly added that none
of his rivals were much better.
She spoke in White Plaza.
The 26-year-old playwright,
whose play "Macbird" was very
controversial, spoke at a noon
rally sponsored by the Stanford
chapter of the Peace and Free
dom Party (PFP).
Mrs. Garson said she did not
believe that "dumping Johnson"
in 1968 will solve the nation's
problems. People are so obses
sed with the "clearness and ob
noxiousness of the Johnson per
sonality," she said, that they
overlook the opportunism of
other candidates for the Presi
dency.
"We want to get on the bal
lot," she said, "so we can speak
to the people in a clear way."
Her husband, Marvin Garson,
a "founding father of the party,"
noted the meaningless of elec
tions in the United States. "Next
year we are going to have an
election between competing ad
vertising agencies," he said.
"Only if the Peace and Freedom
Party can get on the ballot, will
the election have any signifi
cance."

Richard White, a pediatrician
at the Stanford Medical Center,
and midpeninsula chairman of
the party, spoke at the opening
of the rally. Noting the party's
undefined nature, he said that
the PFP is not based around
a leader, but "based around ideas
and around a movement."
He added that while the party
is presently working to meet the
December 31 registration dead
line, "We really want to do more
than this; I hope we can take an
active part in the activities of
the entire left movement."
The Peace and Freedom party
is planning a Be-In at El Camino
Park, near the Stanford Shop
ping Center, on November 12.
