# Administrators Voice Draft Concern
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Stanford students have their
own, diverse ways of protesting
the draft.
Although they are less publi
cized, Stanford administrators
also have their own ways of
showing concern about the draft
laws. Many of them are becom
ing vocal about their opposition.
Richard W. Lyman, Vice-
President and Provost, ex
presses concern that "not more
people are worrying about this
problem.
"I know that people in Wash
ington are worried, that gradu
ate deans all over the country
are beginning to worry, but peo
ple don't seem to realize that
unless something is done, every
non-exempt, physically fit man
in the Class of '68 is going to be
drafted.
Enrollment To Drop
"This means that next year
enrollment in many of our grad
uate schools will drop drastic
ally, and the University will be
in a dangerous position."
Lyman and Dean of Students
Joel P. Smith recently attended
a conference of the American
Council on Education (ACE).
One of the subjects discussed
at the convention was the prob
lem of the draft.
"We were briefed by members
of the staff of the ACE on these

frightening facts about the new
draft law, and we talked about
it with administrators from all
over the country," Lyman ex
plained in an interview with The
Daily. Since then, he has made
several statements about the
ways in which the draft will
affect higher education.
Distorts Educational System
He opposes extension of draft
exempt categories of graduate
study, "not because I think
more people should be drafted,
but because that's not the best

way to deal with the problem.
To divide the graduate students
of the nation into two categor
ies, one draftable and one not,
according to fields of study,
would produce tragic results.
"It would encourage students
to choose lifetime careers on the
basis of whether their choice
would expose them to military
service. It would distort the edu
cational system in such a way
as to do lasting damage to the
arts, humanities, and social sci
ences, while giving excessive
emphasis to technological fields.
Law Called Irrational
Smith, who heads the Uni
versity Selective Service Com
mittee adds, "The present law is
an irrational way to treat the
education system. It is tanta
mount to saying that graduate
education doesn't matter."
The Selective Service Commit
tee holds as its aims to examine
the Selective Service Act, keep
track of the latest developments
in selective service and make
recommendations as to how
Stanford can best use its in
fluence toward repealing or
amending the draft law.
Lyman says "Every high
school spnior should be notified
of his status, and could plan
his future around his educa
tional needs and interests in
stead of military expediency.

"The establishment of such a
system, however, seems to be
ruled out by political circum
stance. The new draft law spe
cifically denies President John
son the right to set up a ran
dom selection system, and it's
unlikely that Congress would
consider abolishing student de
ferments.
"If this is the case," he adds,
the next best system would be
to integrate all draft-eligible in
dividuals who have been de
ferred to get an undergraduate

education into the pool of all
draft-eligible men. so that each
student would be notified of his
standing some time in his senior
year and could plan his educa
tion accordingly. "This would
eliminate what now amounts to
a qualitative judgment between
an engineering and an English
major."
Whitaker Talks
Stanford Graduate Dean Vir
gil Whitaker has also voiced op
position to the draft law.
"Centering deferments upon
certain disciplines now believed
to be directly related to military
need will inevitably, in the long
er view, impede the strength
and warp the free intellectual
development of the U. 5.," the
graduate educator warns.
"All advanced education is
vital to the national interest.
"In fact, past experience has
indicated that we have no sure
knowledge in one decade as to
what areas of knowledge will be
important even for military se
curity one or two decades hence.
"The armed services them
selves are deeply committed to
program of graduate education
in a set of disciplines almost as
broad as the full range of our
most comprehensive graduate
schools.

Council on Education (ACE).
One of the subjects discussed
at the convention was the prob
lem of the draft.
"We were briefed by members
of the staff of the ACE on these

frightening facts about the new
draft law, and we talked about
it with administrators from all
over the country," Lyman ex
plained in an interview with The
Daily. Since then, he has made
several statements about the
ways in which the draft will
affect higher education.
Distorts Educational System
He opposes extension of draft
exempt categories of graduate
study, "not because I think
more people should be drafted,
but because that's not the best

way to deal with the problem.
To divide the graduate students
of the nation into two categor
ies, one draftable and one not,
according to fields of study,
would produce tragic results.
"It would encourage students
to choose lifetime careers on the
basis of whether their choice
would expose them to military
service. It would distort the edu
cational system in such a way
as to do lasting damage to the
arts, humanities, and social sci
ences, while giving excessive
emphasis to technological fields.
Law Called Irrational
Smith, who heads the Uni
versity Selective Service Com
mittee adds, "The present law is
an irrational way to treat the
education system. It is tanta
mount to saying that graduate
education doesn't matter."
The Selective Service Commit
tee holds as its aims to examine
the Selective Service Act, keep
track of the latest developments
in selective service and make
recommendations as to how
Stanford can best use its in
fluence toward repealing or
amending the draft law.
Lyman says "Every high
school spnior should be notified
of his status, and could plan
his future around his educa
tional needs and interests in
stead of military expediency.

"The establishment of such a
system, however, seems to be
ruled out by political circum
stance. The new draft law spe
cifically denies President John
son the right to set up a ran
dom selection system, and it's
unlikely that Congress would
consider abolishing student de
ferments.
"If this is the case," he adds,
the next best system would be
to integrate all draft-eligible in
dividuals who have been de
ferred to get an undergraduate

education into the pool of all
draft-eligible men. so that each
student would be notified of his
standing some time in his senior
year and could plan his educa
tion accordingly. "This would
eliminate what now amounts to
a qualitative judgment between
an engineering and an English
major."
Whitaker Talks
Stanford Graduate Dean Vir
gil Whitaker has also voiced op
position to the draft law.
"Centering deferments upon
certain disciplines now believed
to be directly related to military
need will inevitably, in the long
er view, impede the strength
and warp the free intellectual
development of the U. 5.," the
graduate educator warns.
"All advanced education is
vital to the national interest.
"In fact, past experience has
indicated that we have no sure
knowledge in one decade as to
what areas of knowledge will be
important even for military se
curity one or two decades hence.
"The armed services them
selves are deeply committed to
program of graduate education
in a set of disciplines almost as
broad as the full range of our
most comprehensive graduate
schools.

Law Called Irrational
Smith, who heads the Uni

mittee adds, "The present law is

the Selective Service Act, keep

in selective service and make
recommendations as to how
Stanford can best use its in

amending the draft law.
Lyman says "Every high
school spnior should be notified
of his status, and could plan

"If this is the case," he adds,
the next best system would be
to integrate all draft-eligible in

education into the pool of all
draft-eligible men. so that each

Whitaker Talks
Stanford Graduate Dean Vir

position to the draft law.
"Centering deferments upon
certain disciplines now believed
to be directly related to military
need will inevitably, in the long
er view, impede the strength
and warp the free intellectual
development of the U. 5.," the
graduate educator warns.
"All advanced education is
vital to the national interest.
"In fact, past experience has
indicated that we have no sure
knowledge in one decade as to
what areas of knowledge will be
important even for military se
curity one or two decades hence.
"The armed services them
selves are deeply committed to
program of graduate education
in a set of disciplines almost as
broad as the full range of our
most comprehensive graduate
schools.

Stanford students have their
own, diverse ways of protesting
the draft.
Although they are less publi
cized, Stanford administrators
also have their own ways of
showing concern about the draft
laws. Many of them are becom
ing vocal about their opposition.
Richard W. Lyman, Vice-
President and Provost, ex
presses concern that "not more
people are worrying about this
problem.
"I know that people in Wash
ington are worried, that gradu
ate deans all over the country
are beginning to worry, but peo
ple don't seem to realize that
unless something is done, every
non-exempt, physically fit man
in the Class of '68 is going to be
drafted.
Enrollment To Drop
"This means that next year
enrollment in many of our grad
uate schools will drop drastic
ally, and the University will be
in a dangerous position."
Lyman and Dean of Students
Joel P. Smith recently attended
a conference of the American
Council on Education (ACE).
One of the subjects discussed
at the convention was the prob
lem of the draft.
"We were briefed by members
of the staff of the ACE on these

frightening facts about the new
draft law, and we talked about
it with administrators from all
over the country," Lyman ex
plained in an interview with The
Daily. Since then, he has made
several statements about the
ways in which the draft will
affect higher education.
Distorts Educational System
He opposes extension of draft
exempt categories of graduate
study, "not because I think
more people should be drafted,
but because that's not the best

way to deal with the problem.
To divide the graduate students
of the nation into two categor
ies, one draftable and one not,
according to fields of study,
would produce tragic results.
"It would encourage students
to choose lifetime careers on the
basis of whether their choice
would expose them to military
service. It would distort the edu
cational system in such a way
as to do lasting damage to the
arts, humanities, and social sci
ences, while giving excessive
emphasis to technological fields.
