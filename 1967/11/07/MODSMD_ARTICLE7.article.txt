# Local Communities, Army, Stanford Battle Over Farm Land Annexation
## 
### CONNIE COLLIER 
Stanford wants a research
park on it; Ladera wants a golf
course on it; the Army Corps of
Engineers wants to build a dam
there; Portola Valley, Menlo
Park, and Woodside all want
to annex parts of it.
The land being disputed —
about 1000 acres of it — is locat
ed between Alpine Road and the
Stanford Linear Accelerator.
Hearings will begin on Decem
ber 20 to determine its use and
jurisdiction.
San Mateo County's Local
Agency Formation Commission
(LAFCO) will conduct the hear
ings; Portola Valley, Menlo
Park, and Woodside, all of which
desire to annex the area, will
present their cases.

None of the land is incorpor
ated at present. By precedent,
Stanford annexes its land to a
city before developing it; the
purpose is to obtain the services
which accompany falling within
a city's jurisdiction.
The San Mateo County Plan
ning Commission is preparing a
study to determine the best plan
of the area in terms of which
city could annex it to the best
advantage and in terms of its
use once annexed.
Existing plans are being ana
lyzed by the Planning Commis
sion in the light of transporta
tion networks, visual effects, eco
nomic effects, and impact on rec
reation and conservation.
It's policy should be formulated

by mid-December to coincide
with the LAFCO hearings.
Once incorporated, the land
will be zoned according to the
plans of that city. Thus, Stan
ford is interested in lining up
with the city which most closely
accommodates its demands.
Stanford plans to use 900 acres
of the area for a development
similar to the Stanford Indus
trial Park. Industries related to
university research projects or
SLAC would establish centers
there.
However, the Army Corps of
Engineers has recommended
that 550 acres of this land be
used for a Ledera Dam. This
dam would provide flood control
for the areas bordering San
Francisquito Creek, which oc
casionally overflows and causes
considerable damage.
Proposals Considered
There are various other pro
posals being considered for its
use. Ladera, Portola Valley, and
Woodside are in favor of estab

lishing a "buffer zone" such as
a golf course or park to protect
their rural character.
Residents of all the surround
ing communities fear the im
pact of Stanford's proposed de
velopment on the traffic pat
terns and residential atmo
sphere.
Stanford objects to the pro
[posal for a dam, since this
would involve a loss of 550 acres
of revenue land. Now the near
by municipalities, flood control
districts, and San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties are unable
to agree on a joint project.
A study of the dam and pos
sible alternatives is now under
way and, when completed, will
affect the LAFCO hearings. No
development of the area can
take place until this question is
settled, at least two years from
now.
Most likely, a compromise
consisting of a series of small
dams and partial reinforcement
with concrete, will be the final
outcome.
