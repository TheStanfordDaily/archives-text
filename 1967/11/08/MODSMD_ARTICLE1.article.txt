# SES Hears Dissent On Languages, Math
## 
### ROBERT BRODY 
Discussion of the General Stu
dies requirements, especially the
language requirement, domi
nated yesterday afternoon's
"town meeting" of the Steer
ing Committee on the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES) in
Tresidder Union's large lounge.
The audience of about 80 ad
dressed its questions and com
ments to the SES panel consist
ing of Steering Committee
Chairman Herbert Packer, Elec
trical Engineering Professor
James Gibbons, and undergrad
uates Norton Batkin and Gloria
Strauss.
The major issue in the evalua
tion of requirements was the
ability of students to make their
own decisions, either by design
ing their own programs or by
choosing among recommended
courses. The other alternatives
were a continuation of a modi
fied General Studies program or
increased student-adviser con
tact.
SES's approach to foreign
languages came under attack
as "utilitarian". Peter Dahl, As
sistant to the Director of Gen
eral Studies, cited the phrase
"The interests and needs of
many students" which appeared
in the report's criticism of the
foreign language-math require
ment as an example of "practi
cality which I don't endorse."
Core Of Experience
Packer replied, "I think that
this report tries to strike a bal
ance between two very attractive
but mutually exclusive goals of
education. First, to provide a
common core experience of edu
cation for everybody. Second, to
provide the basics for the talents
and interests of individuals to
be fulfilled.
History Professor Louis Spitz
remarked, "I am profoundly dis
turbed that anything might be
done to reduce the foreign lang
uage requirement from a quali
tative, not a utilitarian, point of
view. Language gives students
an added depth in understand
ing their own minds and speech
and Americanese. It is a bold
face lie to say that one can get
along in any discipline with
knowledge of only the English
language."
Staff member Vern Thompson
responded to this statement by
asking the audience to consider
the relation of the individual to
society and the universe about

them. "Mathematics," he assert
ed, "is the most important lang
uage today. If you don't know
math, you can't understand the
science of today. No student has
the right to ignore the implica
tions of science in this advanced
academic environment."
Introducing the issue of the
merits of any course require
ments, one student remarked,
"I'm overwhelmed by the aca
demic arrogance I see in this
conversation. After the SES
says it wants what is best for
the individual development of
students, it then proceeds to
deal with requirements. I think
the problem is one of provid
ing opportunities for the stu
dent."
Packer replied, "Now that
we've been attacked by both
sides, I feel much better."
End Need For Requirements
Gibbons stated, "There is the
problem of making courses
self-recommending. I've had to
deal with this problem in the
sciences. I would put the burden
of improving courses on the
faculty." This would, he claimed,
eliminate much of the need for
course requirements.
Packer pointed out that Yale

abolished a similar "general
studies" program over a year
ago and replaced it with recom
mended programs.
A freshman commented, "I
think the recommendations
rather than requirements would
allow me to decide what I want
to be, rather than telling me
what to be."
Packer replied, "I don't think
that any students, even Stan
ford students, can be turned
loose to wander at will through
the academic pastures. The cen
tral issue is that guidance has
to be there. The answer ulti
mately lies in bringing students
into closer contact with advisers,
rather than depending on Gen
eral Studies."
