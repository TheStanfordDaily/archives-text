# The 						Outpost
## White Cops And Black People 
### Louis Knowles 
Henry Anthony is a man of
moderate views. He is not a
Black Power politician. In fact,
he is an "Uncle Tom" to many
of East Palo Alto's leaders. But
he is black and he too has be
come angry.
Last week in the wake of bru
tal police action in East Palo
Alto mild-mannered Mr. An
thony was telling the whites that
his community was not going
to remain silent and subservient
much longer. Black Power peo
ple have been issuing warnings
for a long time, but of course
nobody listens to "extremists".
And since nobody has listened
the situation has degenerated
to the point where even the
moderates are talking tough.
On Friday night, October 27
two unrelated incidents occur
red in East Palo Alto. Both were
examples of the vicious overre
action of white cops to situations
that demanded law officers with
an understanding of the black
community.
-lust A Crowd Watching
A group of high school stu
dents were returning from a
dance at Ravenswood High. As
they passed a local market they
came upon a man and a woman
having a rather violent quarrel.
Soon a crowd had gathered to

watch the proceedings. The quar
reling woman in her anger threw
a bottle through the window of
the store.
About this time the white po
lice arrived. It was a black
crowd, it was late at night, and
someone was fighting. A white
cop could only reach one con
clusion: a riot was brewing and
the crowd must be dispersed im
mediately and at all costs.
One of the deputies first on
the scene used his dog in an at
tempt to disperse the crowd.
The dog attacked at least one
person, David Jefferson, who
was bitten in the groin.
The patrolman called for "as
sistance". That term could be
interpreted as a small occupa
tion of whites.
Not Routine Policing
Henry Anthony and his asso
ciates counted 30 patrol cars in
East Palo Alto that night and
the next evening as well. (The
number of cars considered ade
quate for routine policing of
the area is two.)
Most patrol cars carried two
or three men and many were
furnished with a dog. The cars
operated from 4 points which
effectively surrounded most of
East Palo Alto.

Four people were arrested for
assaulting the officer with the
dog.
Reserve Deputy Arrested
One of them was David Jef
ferson. He received no medical
attention for his wound inflict
ed by the dog during his over
night detention in San Mateo
County Jail.
Another man arrested for as
sault was Joachim R. Cretien
who happens to be a reserve
San Mateo Sheriff's deputy.
Cretien said that when he
approached the officers to tell
them what had transpired be
fore their arrival he was knock
ed to the ground and kicked in
the groin. When he identified
himself as a sheriff's deputy one
of the patrolmen said, "That's
nice," and kicked him again in
the groin. You see, Cretien was
black.
Gambling With Lives
Later that same evening in
another section of East Palo
Alto two men started shooting
it out over a gambling dispute.
A Menlo Park policeman shot
one of the combatants to death.
The killing was a justifiable
police action although it may be
argued that something less than
a shotgun blast in the face
would have stopped the man. But

then a crowd gathered as is only
natural after a shooting. Forty
policemen were called in to dis
perse a crowd of 50 to 100 per
sons.
This shooting incident was to
tally unrelated to the crowd at
Ravenswood, but in the minds
of the police and the public the
two merged and grew into a
threat of serious violence.
All Look Alike
To a white cop all black men
look alike at night. He knows
nothing about black society and
his foremost emotions toward
black people are hate and fear.
He shouldn't be trying to po
lice East Palo Alto in the first
place, but since he is there he
does not hesitate to react to any
crowd situation with overwhelm
ing force that does nothing but
antagonize the residents.
Mild-mannered Mr. Anthony
says that on the weekend of
the 27th the Sheriff had mobil
ized for war on East Palo Alto.
Mr. Anthony still wants to
talk to white people, but they
aren't listening. Sheriff Whit
more couldn't take time out of
his campaign for Congress to
meet with black leaders to dis
cuss the charges of brutality
Black people are buying guns
against his troops.

crowd situation with overwhelm
ing force that does nothing but
antagonize the residents.
Mild-mannered Mr. Anthony
says that on the weekend of
the 27th the Sheriff had mobil
ized for war on East Palo Alto.
Mr. Anthony still wants to
talk to white people, but they
aren't listening. Sheriff Whit
more couldn't take time out of
his campaign for Congress to
meet with black leaders to dis
cuss the charges of brutality
Black people are buying guns
against his troops.
Henry Anthony is a man of
moderate views. He is not a
Black Power politician. In fact,
he is an "Uncle Tom" to many
of East Palo Alto's leaders. But
he is black and he too has be
come angry.
Last week in the wake of bru
tal police action in East Palo
Alto mild-mannered Mr. An
thony was telling the whites that
his community was not going
to remain silent and subservient
much longer. Black Power peo
ple have been issuing warnings
for a long time, but of course
nobody listens to "extremists".
And since nobody has listened
the situation has degenerated
to the point where even the
moderates are talking tough.
On Friday night, October 27
two unrelated incidents occur
red in East Palo Alto. Both were
examples of the vicious overre
action of white cops to situations
that demanded law officers with
an understanding of the black
community.
-lust A Crowd Watching
A group of high school stu
dents were returning from a
dance at Ravenswood High. As
they passed a local market they
came upon a man and a woman
having a rather violent quarrel.
Soon a crowd had gathered to

watch the proceedings. The quar
reling woman in her anger threw
a bottle through the window of
the store.
About this time the white po
lice arrived. It was a black
crowd, it was late at night, and
someone was fighting. A white
cop could only reach one con
clusion: a riot was brewing and
the crowd must be dispersed im
mediately and at all costs.
One of the deputies first on
the scene used his dog in an at
tempt to disperse the crowd.
The dog attacked at least one
person, David Jefferson, who
was bitten in the groin.
The patrolman called for "as
sistance". That term could be
interpreted as a small occupa
tion of whites.
Not Routine Policing
Henry Anthony and his asso
ciates counted 30 patrol cars in
East Palo Alto that night and
the next evening as well. (The
number of cars considered ade
quate for routine policing of
the area is two.)
Most patrol cars carried two
or three men and many were
furnished with a dog. The cars
operated from 4 points which
effectively surrounded most of
East Palo Alto.

Four people were arrested for
assaulting the officer with the
dog.
Reserve Deputy Arrested
One of them was David Jef
ferson. He received no medical
attention for his wound inflict
ed by the dog during his over
night detention in San Mateo
County Jail.
Another man arrested for as
sault was Joachim R. Cretien
who happens to be a reserve
San Mateo Sheriff's deputy.
Cretien said that when he
approached the officers to tell
them what had transpired be
fore their arrival he was knock
ed to the ground and kicked in
the groin. When he identified
himself as a sheriff's deputy one
of the patrolmen said, "That's
nice," and kicked him again in
the groin. You see, Cretien was
black.
Gambling With Lives
Later that same evening in
another section of East Palo
Alto two men started shooting
it out over a gambling dispute.
A Menlo Park policeman shot
one of the combatants to death.
The killing was a justifiable
police action although it may be
argued that something less than
a shotgun blast in the face
would have stopped the man. But

then a crowd gathered as is only
natural after a shooting. Forty
policemen were called in to dis
perse a crowd of 50 to 100 per
sons.
This shooting incident was to
tally unrelated to the crowd at
Ravenswood, but in the minds
of the police and the public the
two merged and grew into a
threat of serious violence.
All Look Alike
To a white cop all black men
look alike at night. He knows
nothing about black society and
his foremost emotions toward
black people are hate and fear.
He shouldn't be trying to po
lice East Palo Alto in the first
place, but since he is there he
does not hesitate to react to any
crowd situation with overwhelm
ing force that does nothing but
antagonize the residents.

tally unrelated to the crowd at
Ravenswood, but in the minds
of the police and the public the
two merged and grew into a
threat of serious violence.
All Look Alike
To a white cop all black men
look alike at night. He knows
nothing about black society and
his foremost emotions toward
black people are hate and fear.
He shouldn't be trying to po
lice East Palo Alto in the first
place, but since he is there he
does not hesitate to react to any
crowd situation with overwhelm
ing force that does nothing but
antagonize the residents.
Mild-mannered Mr. Anthony
says that on the weekend of
the 27th the Sheriff had mobil
ized for war on East Palo Alto.
Mr. Anthony still wants to
talk to white people, but they
aren't listening. Sheriff Whit
more couldn't take time out of
his campaign for Congress to
meet with black leaders to dis
cuss the charges of brutality
Black people are buying guns
against his troops.
Henry Anthony is a man of
moderate views. He is not a
Black Power politician. In fact,
he is an "Uncle Tom" to many
of East Palo Alto's leaders. But
he is black and he too has be
come angry.
Last week in the wake of bru
tal police action in East Palo
Alto mild-mannered Mr. An
thony was telling the whites that
his community was not going
to remain silent and subservient
much longer. Black Power peo
ple have been issuing warnings
for a long time, but of course
nobody listens to "extremists".
And since nobody has listened
the situation has degenerated
to the point where even the
moderates are talking tough.
On Friday night, October 27
two unrelated incidents occur
red in East Palo Alto. Both were
examples of the vicious overre
action of white cops to situations
that demanded law officers with
an understanding of the black
community.
-lust A Crowd Watching
A group of high school stu
dents were returning from a
dance at Ravenswood High. As
they passed a local market they
came upon a man and a woman
having a rather violent quarrel.
Soon a crowd had gathered to

watch the proceedings. The quar
reling woman in her anger threw
a bottle through the window of
the store.
About this time the white po
lice arrived. It was a black
crowd, it was late at night, and
someone was fighting. A white
cop could only reach one con
clusion: a riot was brewing and
the crowd must be dispersed im
mediately and at all costs.
One of the deputies first on
the scene used his dog in an at
tempt to disperse the crowd.
The dog attacked at least one
person, David Jefferson, who
was bitten in the groin.
The patrolman called for "as
sistance". That term could be
interpreted as a small occupa
tion of whites.
Not Routine Policing
Henry Anthony and his asso
ciates counted 30 patrol cars in
East Palo Alto that night and
the next evening as well. (The
number of cars considered ade
quate for routine policing of
the area is two.)
Most patrol cars carried two
or three men and many were
furnished with a dog. The cars
operated from 4 points which
effectively surrounded most of
East Palo Alto.

Four people were arrested for
assaulting the officer with the
dog.
Reserve Deputy Arrested
One of them was David Jef
ferson. He received no medical
attention for his wound inflict
ed by the dog during his over
night detention in San Mateo
County Jail.
Another man arrested for as
sault was Joachim R. Cretien
who happens to be a reserve
San Mateo Sheriff's deputy.
Cretien said that when he
approached the officers to tell
them what had transpired be
fore their arrival he was knock
ed to the ground and kicked in
the groin. When he identified
himself as a sheriff's deputy one
of the patrolmen said, "That's
nice," and kicked him again in
the groin. You see, Cretien was
black.
Gambling With Lives
Later that same evening in
another section of East Palo
Alto two men started shooting
it out over a gambling dispute.
A Menlo Park policeman shot
one of the combatants to death.
The killing was a justifiable
police action although it may be
argued that something less than
a shotgun blast in the face
would have stopped the man. But

then a crowd gathered as is only
natural after a shooting. Forty
policemen were called in to dis
perse a crowd of 50 to 100 per
sons.
This shooting incident was to
tally unrelated to the crowd at
Ravenswood, but in the minds
of the police and the public the
two merged and grew into a
