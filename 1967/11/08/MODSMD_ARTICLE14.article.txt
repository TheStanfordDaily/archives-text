## We Can't Neglect The 'Real' Issue 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Once again members of the
Stanford community have gone
on a crusade without using their
presupposed ability to reason.
I refer specifically to the rash
of monomanic literature against
Proposition P.
I am told (in a $300 full page
ad in the Tuesday issue of The
Daily) by not so subtle implica
tion that the consequence of my
yes vote is "irresponsible diplo
macy."
Our troops will, of course, be
immediately withdrawn, leaving
"forces from Australia, Thai
land, New Zealand, South Korea,
the Philippines, and Taiwan"
at the mercy of the non de-esca
lated Viet Cong.
My yes vote negates the pos
sibility of negotiations (to re
tain our honorably and justly
gained possessions).
It is almost inconceivable how
anyone could miss the point of
a proposition so completely.
Proposition P is an expression
of dissent against a most hor
rible reality. Even given an over
whelming majority voting
against the war, I will person
ally guarantee anyone that none
of the aforementioned manifes
tations of "irresponsible diplo
macy" will occur.
Charles Bell, chairman of this
first class, intelligent campaign
to disclose all of the havoc and
confusion caused by a yes vote
on Proposition P, tells us in no
uncertain terms "The conse
quences of taking a precipitious
action, it seems to me, surpass
those of not acting ..."
Well, how in the hell are the
"consequences" of a legal, demo
cratic action such as this going
to even begin to compare with
the illegal, immoral, unjust, nau
seating daily "consequences" of
our involvement in Vietnam?
What gives us the right to talk
about inconsequential wording
when the issue is the most con
sequential travesty of justice in
the world today?
I can only hope that anyone
who is sincere in his concern
about the war wili not lose sight
of the real issue here.

• Yes, But . . .
Editor, The Daily:
The choice of language in yes
terday's paid political advertise
ment ("Honoring the American
Commitment" or "Guarantee of
South Vietnamese Indepen
dence") adequately points up

the position of those who spon
sored the ad.
I am one of those who favor
immediate negotiations and
gradual withdrawal. But should
Proposition P appear on the bal
lot, I — as one who considers
our presence in Vietnam dishon
orable and destructive of Viet
namese life and freedom — will
vote for it.

• Gammatically
Editor, the Daily:
It is obvious from the very
first six words of the text of
Tuesday's Vote No on Propo
sition P Paid Political Adver
tisement that its authors are
shooting from the periphery of
the issue. It is obvious, more
over, that Mr. Charles Bell's
Committee to Defeat P does not
yet understand the English
wording of the Proposition.
Mr. Bell, as his letter of yes
terday indicates, assumes
straightway and recklessly that
the adjective "immediate" ap
plies both to "ceasefire" and
"withdrawal." The authors of
Proposition P, if one listens to
them or Chairman Sally Hell
yer, have themselves pointed
out during the campaign that
this is neither a grammatically
nor logically correct assump
tion.
In a recent debate of all San
Francisco Propositions televised
on KQED, the advocates of
Proposition P stressed that "im
mediate" does not modify both
nouns following. This is an im
portant point as its misunder
standing, a misunderstanding
of the true meaning and intent
of the proposition, forms the
premise of much of the opposi
tion to P including the Commit
tee headed by Mr. Bell.
This is not to say that there
is not cause for misunderstand
ing since the wording, for some,
may be unclear. Furthermore,
Mr. Bell is, I feel, correct in
saying that "immediate" and
"precipitous" withdrawal would
be disastrous for both the U.S.
and South Vietnam. What I am
saying is that the initiators of
Proposition P in San Francisco
agree with us on this point and
at no time have argued for
such a course of action.

• In The Wind
Editor, the Daily:
To the person or persons who
in the past few days have made
a concerted effort to destroy
the principle of free speech at
Stanford University through de
struction of my campaign post
ers (Vote Soul, Vote Keeney,
14" by 22," green and yellow),
let it be known that one cam
paign poster of said propor
tions remains on quad.
Let it be proclaimed through
out the land that said poster is
a stirring and reassuring testi
mony that the winds of freedom
do, in fact, continue to pass gas
over the Stanford campus.

• Making The Grade
Editor, the Daily:
I recently completed a year of
study in the Yale Graduate
School where the modified pass
fail system just adopted on the
undergraduate level has been in
use for some time.
It is certainly true that such
a system eliminates the oppor
tunity for making grade point
calculations as such; most stu
dents, however, tended to habit
ually equate the four categories
with letter grades and the fact
remains that, at least in the De
partment of Geology, the bases
for any final grade were nu
merical examination, paper, and
homework scores compiled dur
ing the semester.
In this respect, a simple
"pass-fail" system has the ad
vantage that both professor and
student are generally aware of
whether a student is passing or
failing; the use of only two
categories makes such numeri
cal grades solely an indication,
for his own benefit, of a stu
dent's performance and reduces
the tendency for both student

and professor to make the equa
tion mentioned above.
That a professor's "closer at
tention to the individual stu
dent's work" supposedly pro
moted by the Yale plan can lead
to a serious distortion of its
underlying philosophy was blat
antly obvious in my department.
Successful completion of grad
uate work required that a stu
dent receive two honors or four
high passes during each year's
course work. The grade game,
in many cases, became subjec
tive to the point of absurdity,
and students who needed "one
more honors" found it expedi
ent literally to go begging to a
professor for the desired grade.
Girls found crying often helped,
and more than one student sud
denly became extremely inter
ested in a professor's research
projects, etc.
Because requirements for suc
cessful completion of either un
dergraduate or graduate work
will probably never be entirely
eliminated, their statement in
terms of a simple pass-fail sys
tem might well avoid the degen
eration to extreme subjectivity
that has crept into the Yale
system.

• Breaking The Spell
Editor, the Dally:
The name of the musician
who left Stanford because of
racial discrimination is Ornette
Coleman, not Nat Coleman as
printed in the Daily on Friday,
Nov. 3, and not even Amette
Coleman as of Steve Rutkus let
ter in the Daily of Nov. 7. Also,
the expression "king of jazz"
(in Rutkus's letter) is quite
ridiculous and outdated, and has
assumed racial overtones in rec
ent years.
Is it so difficult for a Daily
reporter and for a person in
charge of investigating the inci
dent to check the spelling of
one of the greatest contempor
ary American musicians?
