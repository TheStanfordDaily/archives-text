# The 						Capitol Scenes
## The 						Battle Of The Recruiters 
### Art Buchwald 
The operations room of the
24th U.S. Army Recruiting Corps
was tense with excitement. Gen.
Rubicom, the commanding of
ficer, came in with his staff and
stared at the map on the wall.
"Any news from the front, col
onel?"
"Yes, sir. We've heard from
the Dartmouth patrol. They man
aged to get on campus unseen
and got their card table set up
in the administration building.
They report they signed up four

students for Officers Candidate
School before they were dis
covered and had to retreat."
"Good show. Any word from
Princeton?"
Running Low
"No, sir. Not for two days. The
last report we had was that Capt.
Reilly and his men were sur
rounded by students who would
n't let their car move. They're
running short on water and food,
and I don't know how much
longer they'll be able to hold
out."

"Call the Air Force and ask
them if they'll make a drop."
"I did, sir, but the weather's
been bad and all planes are
grounded."
Reserves at Harvard
"Dammit, colonel, we've got to
get relief to them somehow."
"I know sir. We were think
ing of sending in a relief force,
but we've used up all our re
serves at Harvard."
"Lt. Shivers is trapped with
three recruiters in the office of
the Harvard Crimson."
That's Cruel!
"Lt. Shivers?" a major cried.
"That's my brother. How can
you send a kid up to a place
like that?"
"Easy does it, major," Gen.
Rubicom said grimly. "Lt. Shiv
ers knew what he was doing
when he volunteered for the
24th U.S. Army Recruiting
Corps."
"Sure, you can say that stand
ing here in this nice comfortable
office seven stories underneath
the Pentagon. But what about
the kids you send out day after
day to Ohio State and the Uni
versities of Michigan, Wiscon
sin and Berkeley? What are you
running, a suicide mission?"
'War Is Hell'
"Major, I will overlook your
insubordination because I know
how you feel about your broth
er. But I would just like to as

sure you that I'm not heartless.
How do you think I feel every
time I send a patrol out to
Yale or Columbia or Oberlin?
Sure, I know they may never
come back. But we've got a job
to do, and I can't let emotion
stand in the way of the Army's
recruiting plans. Somebody's
got to do the dirty work. War
is hell, son."
At this juncture, the colonel
says, "Sir, we've just got word
from Reilly at Princeton."
"What does he say?"
"His message reads: 'Send us
more students.'"
Trouble At Stanford
The general smiles. "Isn't that
typical of Reilly, Colonel? I
want to recommend him for the
distinguished recruiting cross,
and send out that quote to the
press. We need a hero at a time
like this."
"Sir, the Ist Provisional Re
cruiters Brigade has just got
back from Stanford," a staff offi
cer says.
"How many missing?"
"Five. Schwartz, Weatherill,
Punchinski, Kelly and Ascereiil
were last seen going into the
student union to rescue a Dow
Chemical Co. recruiter and they
never came out."
The general looks off into
space and says, "Why do the
good ones always go first?"
