# More Profs Uphold Student Freedoms

WASHINGTON (CPS) — The
American Association of Uni
versity Professors has become
the second of five national or
ganizations to go on record in
favor of a joint statement on
the rights and freedoms of stu
dents.
The statement endorses such
rights as a student role in pol
icy-making and due process for
students in disciplinary cases.
The AAUP's national council
unanimously endorsed the state
ment during a closed meeting
here last weekend. Although the
statement still must be present
ed to the full AAUP member
ship at a meeting next April, pas
sage there appears likely. The
Council is the organization's pol
icy-making body and its recom
mendations have considerable
influence on the membership.
The Council consists of 30 elect
ed representatives.
The National Student Associ
ation was the first of the five
organizations to endorse the
statement. This action came at
the NSA Congress in August.
Consider In January
In addition to AAUP and NSA,
the statement was drafted by
representatives of the American
Association of Colleges, the Na
tional Association of Student
Personnel Administrators, and
the National Association of
Women's Deans and Counselors.
The governing body of AAC will
consider the statement in Jan
uary, and the policy-making
bodies of NASPA and NAWDC
will review it next April.
These three hurdles for the
statement are considered tough
er than NSA and AAUP appro
val, since these groups, particu
larly the AAC, were more con
servative in their views during
the drawing up of the state
ment this summer. A survey of
college presidents conducted by
the magazine College Manage
ment showed that most of them
agreed with basic academic free
doms of students in principle but
were less willing to approve such
practical applications as a free
student press and free choice
of campus speakers.
The statement is considered
significant because the bodies

which drafted it represent ad
ministrators, faculty members,
and students.
Council Is 'Enthusiastic'
Robert Van Waes, associate
secretary of AAUP, said the
AAUP council was "very enthu
siastic" about the principles of
academic freedom for students.
He termed the joint statement
"a big step toward creating a
national consensus on certain
student rights and freedoms and
a prelude to achieving a nation
al consensus on the student role
in institutional government."
Some of the major provisions
of the statement include:
• A long list of due process
requirements in major cases, in
cluding putting the burden of
proof on the college and guar
anteeing the student's right to
defend himself.
• The right to attend college
without regard to race, to invite
speakers of students' own choos
ing, and to have complete free
rom of off-campus action with
out fear of university punish
ment for the violation of civil
laws.
• Protection of students from
"arbitrary and prejudiced" grad
ing by professors.
• A free student press. When
ever possible, the statement says,
student newspapers should be
legally and financially autono
mous from the university as a
separate corporation. When this
is not possible, the statement
urges a student press sufficient
ly autonomous to remain a ve
hicle for freedom of inquiry
and expression.
The joint drafting committee
also made recommendations for
the implementation of the prin
ciples outlined in the statement.
Perhaps the most significant was
the recommendation for joint
approaches to regional accredit
ing agencies to seek embodiment
of the new principles in stand
ards for accreditation.
The drafting committee also
advocated joint efforts to pro
mote acceptance of the new
standards on the institutional
level and the establishment of
machinery to facilitate continu
ing joint interpretation.
