# Phi Psi Split
## Rush Rules Questioned 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Trouble is brewing in the Phi
Kappa Psi house, and it is ex
pected to come to a head this
week.
The trouble is a split basically
between two groups; the actives,
who want the house to keep a
selective rushing system, and the
pledges, who want future house
membership to be determined
by draw.
The pledges outnumber the ac
tives by more than two to one,
but pledges cannot vote on house
policies.
At the moment, the house is
at an uncertain stage. The ac
tives, reluctant to give up selec

tive rush, expect some compro
mise to be worked out.
Such a compromise was pro
posed at a house meeting Mon
day night. Rushees who wanted
to join the fraternity would place
their names in a hat and then
a number of names would be
drawn.
If any active felt strongly
against letting a particular per
son join, however, he could still
exercise a veto, or "ding."
The understanding of the
house under such a plan would
be that the "dong" would seldom,
if ever, be used.
One pledge said, however, the
actives "won't initiate us unless
we agree with this plan." And

he added, "At least two-thirds
of the pledges are going to leave
by the end of the quarter . . .
unless they institute a draw sys
tem."
According to one active, the
house has been getting some
pressure from the national or
ganization and alumni who want
Phi Psi here to keep selective
rush. A representative of the
national is visiting the house this
week, apparently to inspect the
situation.
On the other hand, according
to this active, "Some of the pres
sures we've been getting from
the outside have had the ten
dency to pull the house to
gether." He added the feeling
of the house is that they "can

work out these problems our
selves."
Another active said, "We're
not going to refuse to initiate
any of [the pledges]. We'll keep
on postponing it until we can
work out some sort of a compro
mise."
But one pledge put it another
way. "They're holding this over
our heads," he said. "They
won't initiate us unless we agree
with this plan."
(Phi Psi pledges are usually
initiated before the school year
begins in September.)
"We really don't want to im
press ourselves on them," the
pledge said. "We recognize that
it is their house."
An active said, "Before they
are initiated, we have to feel that
there is a general feeling of
friendship between us and that
they won't try to do things that
will make our lives miserable."
Another said, "I think [the
pledges] are going to have to
meet us part way."
The current pledge class at
Phi Psi joined in a block last
spring. One of their intentions
then was eventually to eliminate
selective rush, according to one
pledge.
Whether or not the current
rift in the Phi Psi house can be
closed is not certain.
One active, asked what the
chances were of adopting a
straight draw system, answered
"None."
But one pledge said, "It's just
hard for them to conceive that
we're not going to compromise."
It is apparent, however, some
of the pledges will compromise
and some of the actives will not.
A house meeting is planned for
tonight. The question of rush
policy is expected to be high on
the agenda.

week.
The trouble is a split basically
between two groups; the actives,
who want the house to keep a
selective rushing system, and the
pledges, who want future house
membership to be determined
by draw.
The pledges outnumber the ac
tives by more than two to one,
but pledges cannot vote on house
policies.
At the moment, the house is
at an uncertain stage. The ac
tives, reluctant to give up selec

tive rush, expect some compro
mise to be worked out.
Such a compromise was pro
posed at a house meeting Mon
day night. Rushees who wanted
to join the fraternity would place
their names in a hat and then
a number of names would be
drawn.
If any active felt strongly
against letting a particular per
son join, however, he could still
exercise a veto, or "ding."
The understanding of the
house under such a plan would
be that the "dong" would seldom,
if ever, be used.
One pledge said, however, the
actives "won't initiate us unless
we agree with this plan." And

he added, "At least two-thirds
of the pledges are going to leave
by the end of the quarter . . .
unless they institute a draw sys
tem."
According to one active, the
house has been getting some
pressure from the national or
ganization and alumni who want
Phi Psi here to keep selective
rush. A representative of the
national is visiting the house this
week, apparently to inspect the
situation.
On the other hand, according
to this active, "Some of the pres
sures we've been getting from
the outside have had the ten
dency to pull the house to
gether." He added the feeling
of the house is that they "can

work out these problems our
selves."
Another active said, "We're
not going to refuse to initiate
any of [the pledges]. We'll keep
on postponing it until we can
work out some sort of a compro
mise."
But one pledge put it another
way. "They're holding this over
our heads," he said. "They
won't initiate us unless we agree
with this plan."
(Phi Psi pledges are usually
initiated before the school year
begins in September.)
"We really don't want to im
press ourselves on them," the
pledge said. "We recognize that
it is their house."
An active said, "Before they
are initiated, we have to feel that
there is a general feeling of
friendship between us and that
they won't try to do things that
will make our lives miserable."
Another said, "I think [the
pledges] are going to have to
meet us part way."
The current pledge class at
Phi Psi joined in a block last
spring. One of their intentions
then was eventually to eliminate
selective rush, according to one
pledge.
Whether or not the current
rift in the Phi Psi house can be
closed is not certain.
One active, asked what the
chances were of adopting a
straight draw system, answered
"None."
But one pledge said, "It's just
hard for them to conceive that
we're not going to compromise."
It is apparent, however, some
of the pledges will compromise
and some of the actives will not.
A house meeting is planned for
tonight. The question of rush
policy is expected to be high on
the agenda.
