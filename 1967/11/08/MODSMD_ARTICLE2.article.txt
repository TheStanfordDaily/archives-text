# Viol D'Amour Swiped At Dink
## 
### 
A 14 stringed viol d'amour,
worth more than $1300, was
stolen from Dinkelspiel Audi
torium Monday while its owner
was taking a 15 minute break
from a practice session.
John Planting, executive assis
tant to the Department of Music,
said he was "checking things in
the music building" at the time
his viol was stolen.
The instrument was to be
played in a special performance
last night called "Music Then
and Now," however, Planting
was able to borrow a similar
instrument from the Music De
partment.
The viol d'amour is a modern
reproduction of similar 17th cen
tury instruments and has seven
strings for playing with an ad
ditional seven strings below
them to produce "sympathetic
vibrations," Planting said.
