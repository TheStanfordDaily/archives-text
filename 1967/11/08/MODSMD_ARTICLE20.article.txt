# CIA And Dow Seeking Additional Recruiting
## 
### 
The Dow Chemical Company
and the CIA will soon again
hold recruitment interviews on
the Stanford campus. Tentative
sites are the Graduate School
of Business (Dow Company,
Nov. 10) and the Stanford
Placement Center (CIA, Nov. 28
and 29; Dow Company, Nov. 16
and 17).
At the University of Califor
nia Berkeley campus, mean
while, both the CIA and the
Dow Company discontinued
their interviews yesterday. The
action followed Monday's dem
onstration by more than 250
students.
According to Dr. Ralph Keller,
Director of the Stanford Place
ment Service, the interview
sites "depend on what we ex
pect to happen. I would assume
the decision would be made to
move over to Encina if we an
ticipate any disturbances."

Because other students will
be having interviews at the
same time, he added, "it would
n't be fair to hold them here
(Placement Center) if we ex
pect difficulties."
Leonard Siegel, member of
the Stanford chapter of Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
(SDS) which last week held
demonstrations against the two
organizations, told the Daily
that "We will probably have a
rally on Dow against napalm
this Friday at White Plaza."

"We need more organization,"
he said, "before attempting any
more demonstrations."
At Cal, leaders of the SDS
said the recruiters had "chick
ened out," but organization rep
resentatives said they had al
ready completed their sched
ules.
The university's Student
Placement Service reported that
14 students were interviewed on
Monday in spite of the demon
strators.
