# Ferry To Discuss Urbanization As Prime Crisis Of Integration
## 
### 
The Century 21 series con
tinues tonight with a speech on
the social impact of urbaniza
tion by W. H. Ferry at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium at 7:30 p.m.
Ferry, who has earned a repu
tation for "intellectual napalm
ing," is on the staff of the Study
of the Economic Order at the
Center for the Study of Demo
cratic Institutions in Santa Bar
bara.
His speech "Urbanization: A
Farewell to Integration" will
discuss the role and revelance
of integration to modern urban
society. He will talk about how

the U.S. can avoid total disin
tegration before the current
racial crisis reaches its peak.
Ferry, who considers himself
a satirist operating within the
establishment, is currently vice
president of the Fund for the
Republic in Santa Barbara.
After his graduation from Dart
mouth in 1932, he worked as a
journalist for several years, and
during the war worked for the
OPA and the Army Air Force
in a civilian advisory position.
Since the war's end, he has
become a partner in the public
relations firm of Earl Newsom

& Co. In that capacity he has
handled such accounts as Stan
dard Oil, Ford, and Internation
al Paper Company.
Drawing from his background
with business, he has also been
contributor to many books and
pamphlets, and was the editor
of a book entitled The Corporar
tion in Modern Society. A recent
speech, advocating the abolition
of the stock market, aroused na
tional attention and prompted
letters from various stock brok
erage firms and the President
of the New York Stock Ex
change.
