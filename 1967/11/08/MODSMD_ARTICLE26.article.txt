# Ralston Denies End To Indian Air Attack
## 
### NICK SELBY 
(An Interview with Stanford
football coach John Ralston.)
Q. If Marquess starts at quar
terback Saturday in place of the
injured Chuck Williams, will it
mean a reversion of the Stan
ford offense to a reliance on the
ground attack used against San
Jose and Kansas?
Coach Ralston: Marquess will
start at quarterback Saturday
against Oregon. We don't know
as yet how well Chuck's knee
is responding to treatment.
We definitely don't see any
reversion or change in the of
fense. Marquess* passing has
progressed steadily in practice
the last few weeks and we have
confidence that we can continue
to emphasize the pass attack.
Q. What do you expect from
Oregon this weekend?
Coach Ralston: Oregon has a
very aggressive squad that is
starting to gain momentum. The
Ducks have two wins in their
last three games, over Washing
ton State and Idaho, losing to
USC. Defense is their strong
point — Jim Smith, their defen
sive halfback limited Earl Mc-
Coullouch to one reception in
the Southern Cal game.

Oregon's middle guard George
Dames has been named Lineman
of the Game four times this sea
son and presents special prob
lems for our blockers. We've
been working on that in practice.
Q. What happened on the
touchdown pass from Williams
to Washington that covered 57
yards against Washington?
Coach Ralston: It was a case
of good personal effort by Wash
ington. The pattern called for
him to curl over the middle, but
he got even with Dave DuPree
and just burned past him. Wil
liams had good protection and
hit him perfectly.
Q. What happened on the
touchdown pass to Cross? Did
you think about trying to score
with line plunges?
Coach Ralston: We weren't
able to score with plunges
against a less strong defensive
team last week at Army, and
several third down plunges had
already been stopped. Williams
crosed up the Huskies by throw
ing the ball.
Williams showed great poise
on the play, because Cross was
initially well covered on his slant
over the middle. He broke free
and Williams calmly laced the
ball between two defenders.
Q. How did Manke manage to
break away for the 81 yard TD?
Coach Ralston: It was basical
ly a fluke play in which luck
and bad tackling by our defense
worked together. Manke is not
very fast, but Renwick slipped
and Oliver tripped over him. Wo
didn't pursue well and he went
all the way.
Q. Who were the offensive and
and defensive standouts besides
Williams, Hazelrigg, and Carri
gan? Did Carrigan play so well
because he had been kept out
of the last few games?
Coach Ralston: Blaine Nye
and Bill Nicholson stood out on
defense along with John de la
Forest, who didn't start but came
up with his best effort of the
season.
George Beuhler, the tight end,
handled Steve Thompson, Husky
Ail-American, all day, and tackle
Malcolm Snider and guard Bob
Heffernan blocked well.
You'll never know about why
Carrigan played so well. He was
hurt earlier and we felt he was
ready to play. Everyone on this
team wants to play and he was
extremely eager.

THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN: Indian split end Jim Cross holds
the ball triumphantly above his head in imitation of the referee
giving the touchdown signal. The Willianis-to-Cross pass play was
the deciding score in the Indians' 14-7 win over Washington in
Seattle last Saturday. Cross is seventh in PAC-8 receiving statistics
with 24 receptions for 231 yards and two touchdowns. Teammate
Gene Washington is second in receiving with 37 grabs, just one
behind Wayne Stewart of California,

THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN: Indian split end Jim Cross holds
the ball triumphantly above his head in imitation of the referee
giving the touchdown signal. The Willianis-to-Cross pass play was
the deciding score in the Indians' 14-7 win over Washington in
Seattle last Saturday. Cross is seventh in PAC-8 receiving statistics
with 24 receptions for 231 yards and two touchdowns. Teammate
Gene Washington is second in receiving with 37 grabs, just one
behind Wayne Stewart of California,
(An Interview with Stanford
football coach John Ralston.)
Q. If Marquess starts at quar
terback Saturday in place of the
injured Chuck Williams, will it
mean a reversion of the Stan
ford offense to a reliance on the
ground attack used against San
Jose and Kansas?
Coach Ralston: Marquess will
start at quarterback Saturday
against Oregon. We don't know
as yet how well Chuck's knee
is responding to treatment.
We definitely don't see any
reversion or change in the of
fense. Marquess* passing has
progressed steadily in practice
the last few weeks and we have
confidence that we can continue
to emphasize the pass attack.
Q. What do you expect from
Oregon this weekend?
Coach Ralston: Oregon has a
very aggressive squad that is
starting to gain momentum. The
Ducks have two wins in their
last three games, over Washing
ton State and Idaho, losing to
USC. Defense is their strong
point — Jim Smith, their defen
sive halfback limited Earl Mc-
Coullouch to one reception in
the Southern Cal game.

Oregon's middle guard George
Dames has been named Lineman
of the Game four times this sea
son and presents special prob
lems for our blockers. We've
been working on that in practice.
Q. What happened on the
touchdown pass from Williams
to Washington that covered 57
yards against Washington?
Coach Ralston: It was a case
of good personal effort by Wash
ington. The pattern called for
him to curl over the middle, but
he got even with Dave DuPree
and just burned past him. Wil
liams had good protection and
hit him perfectly.
Q. What happened on the
touchdown pass to Cross? Did
you think about trying to score
with line plunges?
Coach Ralston: We weren't
able to score with plunges
against a less strong defensive
team last week at Army, and
several third down plunges had
already been stopped. Williams
crosed up the Huskies by throw
ing the ball.
Williams showed great poise
on the play, because Cross was
initially well covered on his slant
over the middle. He broke free
and Williams calmly laced the
ball between two defenders.
Q. How did Manke manage to
break away for the 81 yard TD?
Coach Ralston: It was basical
ly a fluke play in which luck
and bad tackling by our defense
worked together. Manke is not
very fast, but Renwick slipped
and Oliver tripped over him. Wo
didn't pursue well and he went
all the way.
Q. Who were the offensive and
and defensive standouts besides
Williams, Hazelrigg, and Carri
gan? Did Carrigan play so well
because he had been kept out
of the last few games?
Coach Ralston: Blaine Nye
and Bill Nicholson stood out on
defense along with John de la
Forest, who didn't start but came

of good personal effort by Wash
ington. The pattern called for
him to curl over the middle, but
he got even with Dave DuPree
and just burned past him. Wil
liams had good protection and
hit him perfectly.
Q. What happened on the
touchdown pass to Cross? Did
you think about trying to score
with line plunges?
Coach Ralston: We weren't
able to score with plunges
against a less strong defensive
team last week at Army, and
several third down plunges had
already been stopped. Williams
crosed up the Huskies by throw
ing the ball.
Williams showed great poise
on the play, because Cross was
initially well covered on his slant
over the middle. He broke free
and Williams calmly laced the
ball between two defenders.
Q. How did Manke manage to
break away for the 81 yard TD?
Coach Ralston: It was basical
ly a fluke play in which luck
and bad tackling by our defense
worked together. Manke is not
very fast, but Renwick slipped
and Oliver tripped over him. Wo
didn't pursue well and he went
all the way.
Q. Who were the offensive and
and defensive standouts besides
Williams, Hazelrigg, and Carri
gan? Did Carrigan play so well
because he had been kept out
of the last few games?
Coach Ralston: Blaine Nye
and Bill Nicholson stood out on
defense along with John de la
Forest, who didn't start but came
up with his best effort of the
season.
George Beuhler, the tight end,
handled Steve Thompson, Husky
Ail-American, all day, and tackle
Malcolm Snider and guard Bob
Heffernan blocked well.
You'll never know about why
Carrigan played so well. He was
hurt earlier and we felt he was
ready to play. Everyone on this
team wants to play and he was
extremely eager.

THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN: Indian split end Jim Cross holds
the ball triumphantly above his head in imitation of the referee
giving the touchdown signal. The Willianis-to-Cross pass play was

Seattle last Saturday. Cross is seventh in PAC-8 receiving statistics
with 24 receptions for 231 yards and two touchdowns. Teammate
Gene Washington is second in receiving with 37 grabs, just one
behind Wayne Stewart of California,
