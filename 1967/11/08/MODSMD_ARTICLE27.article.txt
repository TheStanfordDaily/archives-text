# Sports Profile: Brock Is Indian Harrier On The Go!
## 
### BOB RUND 
Sophomore Greg Brock is a
young man on the move, lit
'rally. Brock, a nineteen year
old Stanford sophomore, has
established himself as the lead
ing runner on the Stanford
cross-country team this season.
He has been improving con
sistently each meet. At the
South Tahoe Invitational cross
country meet last Saturday, he
won his first collegiate cham
pionship.
Brock's victory at Tahoe was
significant because he defeated
Darryl Dent, the winner of the
Sacramento and Long Beach
State invitationals.
San Jose's coach, Ted Banks,
was among those surprised by
Brock's victory. After the race
Coach Banks congratulated
Brock, "Nice race, I didn't think
you were that tough."
High School Success
Brock, who hails from Sacra
mento, California, ran the two
mile in 9:13 while still a senior
at Norte Del Rio High School.

This time ranked him as on of
the twenty top prep two milers
in the nation. He also recorded
prep times of 4:19 and 1:57 for
the mile and half mile runs.
Brock had a good season last
year as a freshman, running
second on a Frosh team that
went undefeated and recorded
the best total team time of any
freshman team in Stanford his
tory.
In freshman track he was
unable to run to his full poten
tial because of an ankle injury
sustained during baton passing
practice.
Hill Workouts
During the summer he com
bined his training with his sum
mer job. He got up before it was
time for work and ran dis
tance workouts. After work, he
either ran again or lifted
weights to build up his strength.
This fall in practice he has
continued working in every
practice. Coach Jrery Barland
stated, "Greg has worked espe
cially hard this year on hills

to build up his strength and
speedâ€”which were his weak
nesses last year."
Morning Trots
In addition to the afternoon
workouts with the team, Brock
gets up every morning and runs
five or six miles. On Sundays,
he does a twelve to eighteen
mile road run to build up his
endurance.
Brock, a psychology major, is
also a good team athlete. He en
joys helping the other runners
on their form, and is quick to
encourage his teammates when
they need it.
No Psyching Out
Unlike many runners, Brock
doesn't believe in "psyching
out" in certain races. The fact
that he has been the first Stan
ford finisher in every race is
proof of his consistency.
Coach Barland believes "there
is no limit to what Brock can
do if he keeps working as hard
in the future as he has this
season.
"With more racing experience
he could become one of the
best."
Two and a half more years of
competing in the AAWU should
provide him with that experi
ence.
