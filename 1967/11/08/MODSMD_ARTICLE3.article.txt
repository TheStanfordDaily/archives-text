# Hoo Tow Now 'Lenin Tower'
## 
### 
Hoover Tower was renamed
late Monday night. However,
University officials had nothing
to do with the rechristening.
The name "Lenin Tower" was
discovered on the Tower's front
door yesterday morning by Stan
ford police. The artwork was
scrawled in bold red paint.
Yesterday marked the 50th
anniversary of the Russian Rev
olution. Police speculated that
this may have prompted the
Tower decoration. Hoover Tower
houses many volumes dealing
with Russia and the Bolshevik
Revolution.
A Stanford workcrew was sent
to erase the misdeed shortly
after it was discovered. All
traces of the misdeed were gone
by 9:45 a.m.
The last inscription to appear
on the Tower's wall was the slo
gal "Beat Stanford" in six-foot
high letters that showed up a
year ago next week. Police saw
no connection between the two
incidences.
Several years ago, members of
the Alpine Club created a stir
when, under the cover of dark
ness, they scaled one side of
the Tower and descended the
other, leaving a trail of 10-foot
high painted footprints behind.
