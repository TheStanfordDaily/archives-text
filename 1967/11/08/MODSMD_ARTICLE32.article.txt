Striking parallels between the
U.S. situation in Vietnam today
and its relation with China in
the late '40's are pointed out by
Prof. Lyman Van Slyke of Stan
ford in his introduction to "The
China White Paper, August
1949."
In the two-volume work to be
published Nov. 20 in paperbacks
the biggest difference he sees
is that in Vietnam the U.S. de
cided to engage, while in the
Nationalist-Communist situa
tion, the U.S. chose to disengage
from both sides,
"In both our situations," Prof.
Van Slyke writes, "our recogni
tion and support went to a re
gime with acknowledged short
comings but to which there
seemed to be no adequate al
ternatives." He notes the orig
inal U.S. course in each situa
tion—limited aid and advice
without direct military partici
pation—promised quick victory.
But, in both cases withdrawal
became more difficult as time
went on, and grave conse
quences ensued. Specifically, he
compares the relations in Viet

nam today with those in China
in 1944.
"In Vietnam, smaller in size
and population than any Chi
nese provinces, what began as
limited and indirect assistance,
has grown to half a million
men and $2 billion per month."
Prof. Van Slyke parallels this
to the U.S. policy toward Chiang
Kia-shek in 1944 which advo
cated support for his govern
ment in the war, besides pro
moting unity, democracy and
needed reforms.
But, he notes, "it is clear now
that these goals were irrecon
cilable, for if there was no pos
sibility of our withdrawing our
support from Chiang, there was
no way of getting him to make
changes he did not choose to
make. America's role as medi
ator was compromised for the
same reason."
He concludes by recalling
some negative results of the
war. Among them are the Re
publican attack on the adminis
tration and the rise of Sen.
Joseph McCarthy. With these
came the furor over the State
Department's White Paper.

went on, and grave conse
quences ensued. Specifically, he
compares the relations in Viet

nam today with those in China
in 1944.
"In Vietnam, smaller in size
and population than any Chi
nese provinces, what began as
limited and indirect assistance,
has grown to half a million
men and $2 billion per month."
Prof. Van Slyke parallels this
to the U.S. policy toward Chiang
Kia-shek in 1944 which advo
cated support for his govern
ment in the war, besides pro
moting unity, democracy and
needed reforms.
But, he notes, "it is clear now
that these goals were irrecon
cilable, for if there was no pos
sibility of our withdrawing our
support from Chiang, there was
no way of getting him to make
changes he did not choose to
make. America's role as medi
ator was compromised for the
same reason."
He concludes by recalling
some negative results of the
war. Among them are the Re
publican attack on the adminis
tration and the rise of Sen.
Joseph McCarthy. With these
came the furor over the State
Department's White Paper.
Striking parallels between the
U.S. situation in Vietnam today
and its relation with China in
the late '40's are pointed out by
Prof. Lyman Van Slyke of Stan
ford in his introduction to "The
China White Paper, August
1949."
In the two-volume work to be
published Nov. 20 in paperbacks
the biggest difference he sees
is that in Vietnam the U.S. de
cided to engage, while in the
Nationalist-Communist situa
tion, the U.S. chose to disengage
from both sides,
"In both our situations," Prof.
Van Slyke writes, "our recogni
tion and support went to a re
gime with acknowledged short
comings but to which there
seemed to be no adequate al
ternatives." He notes the orig
inal U.S. course in each situa
tion—limited aid and advice
without direct military partici
pation—promised quick victory.
But, in both cases withdrawal
became more difficult as time
went on, and grave conse
quences ensued. Specifically, he
compares the relations in Viet

nam today with those in China
in 1944.
"In Vietnam, smaller in size
and population than any Chi
nese provinces, what began as
limited and indirect assistance,
