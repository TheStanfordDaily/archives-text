According to the California
State Automobile Association,

vehicle registration cards, stud
ded tires and odometers.
The speed limit is raised to
55 miles per hour for trucks,
school buses, and cars towing
trailers, except where lower
speeds are posted.
A 15 mile-per-hour speed limit
has been established for ve
hicles approaching any yield
right of way sign at any inter
section or entrance to a high
way.
Minimum Insurance liaise
Minimum insurance require
ments under financial responsi
bility laws will require auto
mobile owners to carry $15,000

for bodily injury or death to
any one person involved in an
accident; $30,000 for bodily in
jury or death to all persons in
volved in an accident; and
$5,000 for property damage re
sulting from an accident. These
new insurance limits become
effective July 1, 19G8.
The driver of any vehicle that
is involved in an accident re
sulting in property damage in
excess of $200 (formerly $100)
must report the accident to the
Department of Motor Vehicles
within 15 days. (Present law
also requires a report if bodily
injury or a death occurs).
No car dealer shall offer for
sale any used passenger vehicles
manufactured after January 1,
1962 unless they are equipped
with at least two approved
safety belts in the front seat.
Present Registration
On Demand
Certificates of registration

need no longer be visibly dis
played in vehicles. However, it
must be retained in the vehicle
in some suitable place and must
be presented to a police officer
upon demand.
Metal studded tires (generally
used in snow areas) became
legal on California highways on
October 1, 1967 for a two-year
experimental period. The use of
the tires is permitted during the
months of October through
April during this trial period.
Odometers must not be con
nected, reset or turned back
with intent to reduce the num
ber of miles on the odometer
gauge.
Effective January 1, 1968, all
motor vehicles registered in
California must be equipped
with an outside rearview mirror
on the driver's side in addition
to the mirror on the inside of
the vehicle.
