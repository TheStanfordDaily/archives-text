SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
peace proposition urging an im
mediate cease fire in the Viet
nam war went down to defeat
Tuesday night in a San Fran
cisco municipal election poll on
the war issue.
The initiative ballot question
was the first testing of public
opinion on the war in a major
U.S. city election.
The count from 600 of 1,341
precincts gave 57,032 against
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
and 32,339 for a cease fire.

The Proposition P peace bal
lot question asked voters:
"Shall it be the policy of the
people of the City and County
of San Francisco that there be
an immediate cease fire and with
drawal of U.S. troops from Viet
nam so that the Vietnamese peo
ple can settle their own prob
lems?"
Attorney Joseph Alioto won
election as San Francisco's may
or last night. He will succeed
John F. Shelley, who did not
seek a second four-year term

because of ill health.
The count from 1,305 of 1,341
precincts gave Alioto 103,590;
Harold Dobbs 87,921, and Jack
Morrison 38,788.
These three were regarded as
the leading contenders in a field
of 18 aspirants for the mayor's
office.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Re
publican Louie B. Nunn was
elected governor of Kentucky
yesterday, Massachusetts Secre
tary of State Kevin H. White
defeated Louise Day Hicks to
take charge of Boston City Hall,
and a Negro Democrat was
elected mayor of Gary, Ind.
Richard G. Hatcher edged Re
publican Joseph Radigan in a
tight contest for mayor of the
Indiana steel-making city. The
arithmetic of race was evident
in a Gary vote count that clear
ly followed color lines.
Those voter decisions, with
their overtones of racial contro
versy and national policy, could
hold portents for 1968 and the
Presidential election one year
away.
Nunn aimed his campaign
past his Democratic opponent,
Henry Ward, contending that a
GOP vote was a vote to repudi
ate President Johnson's admin
istration and his policy in Viet
nam. The conservative lawyer
from southern Kentucky be
came the first Republican elect
ed governor there in 24 years.
White beat Mrs. Hicks, a con
troversial grandmother, in a bat
tle between Democrats which
centered on the issue of racial
balance in the public schools.
The issue of race was crucial,
too, in Cleveland, where a Re
publican and a Negro Democrat
were tangled in a tight mayoral
contest.
In Cleveland, as in Gary, Na
tional Guardsmen stood by lest
polling place contests spill over
into racial violence. No serious
trouble was reported in either
city.

CLEVELAND (AP)—Carl B.
Stokes apparently won an uphill
fight Tuesday to become the first
Negro mayor of a major Ameri
can city.
Stokes had trailed most of the
night but as final returns came
in from the Negro East Side he
cut Republican Seth C. Taft's
once substantial lead and finally
forged ahead.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
peace proposition urging an im
mediate cease fire in the Viet
nam war went down to defeat
Tuesday night in a San Fran
cisco municipal election poll on
the war issue.
The initiative ballot question
was the first testing of public
opinion on the war in a major
U.S. city election.
The count from 600 of 1,341
precincts gave 57,032 against
U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam
and 32,339 for a cease fire.

The Proposition P peace bal
lot question asked voters:
"Shall it be the policy of the
people of the City and County
of San Francisco that there be
an immediate cease fire and with
drawal of U.S. troops from Viet
nam so that the Vietnamese peo
ple can settle their own prob
lems?"
Attorney Joseph Alioto won
election as San Francisco's may
or last night. He will succeed
John F. Shelley, who did not
seek a second four-year term

because of ill health.
The count from 1,305 of 1,341
precincts gave Alioto 103,590;
Harold Dobbs 87,921, and Jack
Morrison 38,788.
These three were regarded as
the leading contenders in a field
of 18 aspirants for the mayor's
office.
