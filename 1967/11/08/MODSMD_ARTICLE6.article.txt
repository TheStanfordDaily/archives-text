# Collector Makes Pledge For New Art Building
## 
### 
Nathan Cummings, Chicago in
dustrialist and philanthropist,
has made a major pledge to
Stanford for its new art building,
which will bear his name, Presi
dent Wallace Sterling announced
today.
The amount of the pledge was
not revealed.
Cummings is Chairman of Con
solidated Foods Corp., and long
has been an avid and expert art
collector. Critics have described
his collection of 19th and 20th
century French paintings, and
ancient Peruvian ceramics, as
"extremely distinguished."
His office and homes in Chi
cago and New York are filled
with the works of artists such
as Renoir, Picasso, Dufy, Madig
liani, Lautrec, Gauguin, and
Degas.

The Nathan Cummings Art
Building is being built adjacent
to the Hoover Institution and be
tween the Art Gallery and the
Main Library at a total cost of
$2,425,000. Additional financing
is being provided by other pri
vate gifts and a federal construc
tion grant from the Department
of Health, Education and Wel
fare. The building is scheduled
for completion in the late spring
of 1949.
"The new art building will
rank, with the facilities at Ber
keley and UCLA, as one of the
three important centers for the
study of art in the West, and as
the only privately controlled in
stitution of its kind and scope
in this part of the country," said
Prof. Lorenz Eitner, head of the
Department of Art and Archi
tecture. "It is in this context that
Nathan Cummings' generous do
nation, for which we are deeply
grateful, takes on a significance
which transcends the immediate
importance of the new building
for Stanford.
"It will house a comprehen
sive research library in the his
tory of art and architecture, as
well as the other collections and
photographic archives which are
indispensable for scholarly work
in the arts. Together with our
growing Museum collections and
with the exhibition spaces of
our Gallery, the new building
will function as a setting for
systematic study, for teaching,
publishing and display.
