# Peace Referendum Ruled Invalid For Today's Vote
## 
### 
Proposition P will not be con
sidered in a student referendum
today and tomorrow, according
to a ruling yesterday by Legis
lature Speaker Michael Wein
stein.
The regular elections will take
place with the entire student
body voting in the head yell lead
er primary and in a referendum
on Saturday's peace vigil.
Twenty off-campus undergrad
uate and 25 graduate Legislature
representatives will also be elect
ed at-large by members of their
constituencies.
Polls will be open 9 a.m. to
4 p.m. at the engineering corner
of Quad and outside the post of
fice, according to elections com
missioner Craig Brown.
The controversial Proposition
P, calling for immediate U.S.
withdrawal from Vietnam, was
removed from the ballot because
the motion in the Legislature to
hold a referendum on the Propo
sition was made by a non-mem
ber.
Weinstein did not learn until
Monday that Denis Hayes, who
made the motion, is not a mem
ber of Legislature. The motion
to hold the Proposition P refer
endum passed Thursday with
only three dissenting votes.
"Although it's just a techni
cality," Weinstein said, "the fact
that Hayes is not a member
makes the referendum invalid.
The Legislature will have the
opportunity to pass this referen
dum legally at the next meet
ing."
Futile Campaign
The announcement of a Prop
osition P referendum last Friday
caused a brief, vigorous cam
paign by students advocating a
"no" vote.
Their effort and expenditure
not only proved unnecessary but
turned out to be a violation of
election regulations in the As
sociated Students by-laws. ;
A $300 full-page advertisement
in Tuesday's Daily, sponsored by
an ad-hoc committee headed by
Charles Bell, violated a rule
limiting to ,£LS on each side "ex

penditure of all groups for, or
against, a proposition."
Another ad-hoc committee,
chaired by Robert Walker, vio
lated regulations limiting distri
bution of handbills. This group
blanketed the campus Sunday
with leaflets urging a "no" vote.
More than $15 was spent by this
group also.
Yesterday afternoon the ASSU
Violations Investigation Commit
tee met with members of the
two ad-hoc committees and told
them of the violations. No disci
plinary action was taken.
Bell, chairman of one of the
ad-hoc committees, said he was
"somewhat disappointed" that
Proposition P was off the ballot.
"It would be nice to see what
Stanford opinion is on the war,"
he commented.
Propistion P will be printed on
the paper ballots because the de
cision to cancel the referendum
came after they had been print
ed, Brown said. Votes on the
proposition will not be counted,
however.
Remeaning on the ballot will
be a "Peace Vigil Resolution"
reading:
"We, the Associated Students
of Stanford University support

the activities and intent of the
Peace Vigil of November 11-12,
said intent being to show in a
reasonable way a deep concern
for peace in Vietnam."
Cheerleaders Election
Eight candidates are running
for head yell leader. If none re
ceives a majority of votes cast,
a run-off election will be held
next Monday and Tuesday,
Brown said.
All registered Stanford stu
dents are eligible to vote on
the peace vigil resolution and in
the yell leader election.
The legislature will fill a to
tal of 45 of its empty seats in
the at-large election.
Off-campus undergraduates
who are not affiliated with an
eating club or fraternity will be
handed a ballot listing 49 can

didates for 20 seats.
Graduate students in the
school of humanities and sci
ences can vote for 25 candidates
out of 34 who were nominated.
These legislature seats are
apportioned to the off-campus
undergraduates on the basis of
one representative for every 75
students. Other undergraduates
are represented through their
living groups. Law, business
and medical students elect legis
lature members through their
schools' student organizations.
The candidates on today's
ballot gained nomination by
submitting petitions with 15 sig
natures. Six petitions for under
graduate seats were declared in
valid because the candidate was
affiliated with some living
group.

Futile Campaign
The announcement of a Prop
osition P referendum last Friday
caused a brief, vigorous cam
paign by students advocating a
"no" vote.
Their effort and expenditure
not only proved unnecessary but
turned out to be a violation of
election regulations in the As
sociated Students by-laws. ;
A $300 full-page advertisement
in Tuesday's Daily, sponsored by
an ad-hoc committee headed by
Charles Bell, violated a rule
limiting to ,£LS on each side "ex

penditure of all groups for, or
against, a proposition."
Another ad-hoc committee,
chaired by Robert Walker, vio
lated regulations limiting distri
bution of handbills. This group
blanketed the campus Sunday
with leaflets urging a "no" vote.
More than $15 was spent by this
group also.
Yesterday afternoon the ASSU
Violations Investigation Commit
tee met with members of the
two ad-hoc committees and told
them of the violations. No disci
plinary action was taken.
Bell, chairman of one of the
ad-hoc committees, said he was
"somewhat disappointed" that
Proposition P was off the ballot.
"It would be nice to see what
Stanford opinion is on the war,"
he commented.
Propistion P will be printed on
the paper ballots because the de
cision to cancel the referendum
came after they had been print
ed, Brown said. Votes on the
proposition will not be counted,
however.
Remeaning on the ballot will
be a "Peace Vigil Resolution"
reading:
"We, the Associated Students
of Stanford University support

the activities and intent of the
Peace Vigil of November 11-12,
said intent being to show in a
reasonable way a deep concern
for peace in Vietnam."
Cheerleaders Election
Eight candidates are running
for head yell leader. If none re
ceives a majority of votes cast,
a run-off election will be held
next Monday and Tuesday,
Brown said.
All registered Stanford stu
dents are eligible to vote on
the peace vigil resolution and in
the yell leader election.
The legislature will fill a to
tal of 45 of its empty seats in
the at-large election.
Off-campus undergraduates
who are not affiliated with an
eating club or fraternity will be
handed a ballot listing 49 can

didates for 20 seats.
Graduate students in the
school of humanities and sci
ences can vote for 25 candidates
out of 34 who were nominated.
These legislature seats are
apportioned to the off-campus
undergraduates on the basis of
one representative for every 75
students. Other undergraduates
are represented through their
living groups. Law, business
and medical students elect legis
lature members through their
schools' student organizations.
The candidates on today's
ballot gained nomination by
submitting petitions with 15 sig
natures. Six petitions for under
graduate seats were declared in
valid because the candidate was
affiliated with some living
group.
Proposition P will not be con
sidered in a student referendum
today and tomorrow, according
to a ruling yesterday by Legis
lature Speaker Michael Wein
stein.
The regular elections will take
place with the entire student
body voting in the head yell lead
er primary and in a referendum
on Saturday's peace vigil.
Twenty off-campus undergrad
uate and 25 graduate Legislature
representatives will also be elect
ed at-large by members of their
constituencies.
Polls will be open 9 a.m. to
4 p.m. at the engineering corner
of Quad and outside the post of
fice, according to elections com
missioner Craig Brown.
The controversial Proposition
P, calling for immediate U.S.
withdrawal from Vietnam, was
removed from the ballot because
the motion in the Legislature to
hold a referendum on the Propo

Weinstein did not learn until
Monday that Denis Hayes, who
made the motion, is not a mem

Proposition P was off the ballot.
"It would be nice to see what
Stanford opinion is on the war,"
he commented.
Propistion P will be printed on
the paper ballots because the de
cision to cancel the referendum
came after they had been print
ed, Brown said. Votes on the
proposition will not be counted,
however.
Remeaning on the ballot will
be a "Peace Vigil Resolution"
reading:
"We, the Associated Students
of Stanford University support

the activities and intent of the
Peace Vigil of November 11-12,
said intent being to show in a
reasonable way a deep concern
for peace in Vietnam."
Cheerleaders Election
Eight candidates are running
for head yell leader. If none re
ceives a majority of votes cast,
a run-off election will be held
next Monday and Tuesday,
Brown said.
All registered Stanford stu
dents are eligible to vote on
the peace vigil resolution and in
the yell leader election.
The legislature will fill a to
tal of 45 of its empty seats in
the at-large election.
Off-campus undergraduates
who are not affiliated with an
eating club or fraternity will be
handed a ballot listing 49 can

didates for 20 seats.
Graduate students in the
school of humanities and sci
ences can vote for 25 candidates
out of 34 who were nominated.
These legislature seats are
apportioned to the off-campus
undergraduates on the basis of
one representative for every 75
students. Other undergraduates
are represented through their
living groups. Law, business
and medical students elect legis
lature members through their
schools' student organizations.
The candidates on today's
ballot gained nomination by
submitting petitions with 15 sig
natures. Six petitions for under
graduate seats were declared in
valid because the candidate was
affiliated with some living
group.
Proposition P will not be con
sidered in a student referendum
today and tomorrow, according
to a ruling yesterday by Legis
lature Speaker Michael Wein
stein.
The regular elections will take
place with the entire student
body voting in the head yell lead
er primary and in a referendum
on Saturday's peace vigil.
Twenty off-campus undergrad
uate and 25 graduate Legislature
representatives will also be elect
ed at-large by members of their
constituencies.
Polls will be open 9 a.m. to
4 p.m. at the engineering corner
of Quad and outside the post of
fice, according to elections com
missioner Craig Brown.
The controversial Proposition
P, calling for immediate U.S.
withdrawal from Vietnam, was
removed from the ballot because
the motion in the Legislature to
hold a referendum on the Propo
sition was made by a non-mem
ber.
Weinstein did not learn until
Monday that Denis Hayes, who
made the motion, is not a mem
ber of Legislature. The motion
to hold the Proposition P refer
endum passed Thursday with
only three dissenting votes.
"Although it's just a techni
cality," Weinstein said, "the fact
that Hayes is not a member
makes the referendum invalid.
The Legislature will have the
opportunity to pass this referen
dum legally at the next meet
ing."
Futile Campaign
The announcement of a Prop
osition P referendum last Friday
caused a brief, vigorous cam
paign by students advocating a
"no" vote.
Their effort and expenditure
not only proved unnecessary but
turned out to be a violation of
election regulations in the As
sociated Students by-laws. ;
A $300 full-page advertisement
in Tuesday's Daily, sponsored by
an ad-hoc committee headed by
Charles Bell, violated a rule
limiting to ,£LS on each side "ex

penditure of all groups for, or
against, a proposition."
Another ad-hoc committee,
chaired by Robert Walker, vio
lated regulations limiting distri
bution of handbills. This group
blanketed the campus Sunday
with leaflets urging a "no" vote.
More than $15 was spent by this
group also.
Yesterday afternoon the ASSU
Violations Investigation Commit
tee met with members of the
two ad-hoc committees and told
them of the violations. No disci
plinary action was taken.
Bell, chairman of one of the
ad-hoc committees, said he was
"somewhat disappointed" that
Proposition P was off the ballot.
"It would be nice to see what
Stanford opinion is on the war,"
he commented.
Propistion P will be printed on
the paper ballots because the de
cision to cancel the referendum
