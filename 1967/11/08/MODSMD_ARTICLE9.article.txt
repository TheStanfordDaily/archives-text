# Lyman Anticipates Fall In Federal Fund Help
## 
### 
Provost Richard W. Lyman
today said federal support is
"likely to decline" somewhat at
Stanford this year and urged
"extraordinary restraint" in
campus spending on federally fi
nanced program until present
uncertainties in Washington
are clarified.
In a memorandum circulated
to deans, department heads, and

principal investigators, Lyman
said: "It may prove necessary
for investigators to make exist
ing support go much further
than originally forecast.
"Our aim should be to limit
as far as possible the impact of
any reduction in federal funding
upon the on-going process of
research and training at Stan
ford."
A report published last month
by the National Science Founda
tion ("Federal Support for Aca
demic Science and Other Edu
cational Activities in Univers
ities and Colleges," NSF 67-14,
U.5.G.P.0., 137 pp., 70c) showed
that Stanford received more
than $43 million in federal obli
gations for research and de
velopment during 1966, com
pared to $22 million in 1963.
Ranks Behind MIT
The University ranks third
nationally in this respect, be
hind MIT ($57 million) and
Michigan ($46 million). These
totals exclude nearly $51 million
in federal obligations for the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center, which NSF groups with
"federal contract research cen
ters associated with colleges and
universities."
Urging a "cautious and pru
dent husbanding of available re
sources" until present uncer
tainty about federal funding is
clarified, Provost Lyman sug
gested that commitments for
equipment purchases, remodel
ing, supplies and travel be post
poned.

"Appointments of new per
sonnel as well as appointments
to fill currently unfilled posi
tions on research staffs should
be deferred," he added.
"As the Congress and the
Executive Branch continue to
debate the question of govern
ment economy versus defense
costs, the proposed tax increase
and the size of the federal defi
cit, it is still too early to fore
cast what will be the precise
effect upon federal support of
higher education—particularly
federally-sponsored re se a r c h,
training, and construction con
tracts and grants," Lyman com
mented.
Support Will Decline
"It is clear that, however the
balance is struck, federal sup
port at Stanford is likely to de
cline to some extent during the
current academic year. . . . Pres
ently, a number of appropria
tions bills are yet to be ap
proved by the Congress or—if
approved—signed by the Presi
dent.
"Meanwhile, Congress has yet
to act on granting interim au
thority for those agencies af
fected to spend money; the
President has ordered a freeze
on all non-essential new con
struction funds; and many
agencies have been forced to
curtail drastically their re
search and training grant and
contract obligation because of
the uncertainty" of funds be
coming available.

Support Will Decline
"It is clear that, however the
balance is struck, federal sup
port at Stanford is likely to de
cline to some extent during the
current academic year. . . . Pres
ently, a number of appropria
tions bills are yet to be ap

"Meanwhile, Congress has yet
to act on granting interim au
thority for those agencies af
fected to spend money; the
President has ordered a freeze

struction funds; and many
agencies have been forced to
curtail drastically their re
search and training grant and
contract obligation because of
the uncertainty" of funds be
coming available.
Provost Richard W. Lyman
today said federal support is
"likely to decline" somewhat at
Stanford this year and urged
"extraordinary restraint" in
campus spending on federally fi
nanced program until present
uncertainties in Washington
are clarified.
In a memorandum circulated
to deans, department heads, and

principal investigators, Lyman
said: "It may prove necessary
for investigators to make exist
ing support go much further
than originally forecast.
"Our aim should be to limit
as far as possible the impact of
any reduction in federal funding
upon the on-going process of
research and training at Stan
ford."

tion ("Federal Support for Aca

that Stanford received more
than $43 million in federal obli
gations for research and de
velopment during 1966, com
pared to $22 million in 1963.
Ranks Behind MIT

nationally in this respect, be
