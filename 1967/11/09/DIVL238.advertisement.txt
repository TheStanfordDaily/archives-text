SEE US ON CAMPUS NOVEMBER 16 AND 17
You may discover a career of unlimited growth potential with Standard
Oil Company (New Jersey) and its worldwide affiliates in oil, chemicals,
plastics, cryogenics and minerals. In each of these, we re operating
an unusual system of developing management people.
It starts with decentralization of responsibility to autonomous affiliates.
We're ideally structured to see that you don't "get lost in the organization.
And as you grow, you'll never face the mid-career blight that comes from
choosing too small a company at the start. Your advancement can be inter
company as well as intracompany, overseas as well as domestic.
We'll give you a real growth challenge during your whole career—
because this is a basic responsibility of our top management.
If you have superior business and analytical ability, confidence, and
unusual breadth of view, we have immediate openings in a variety of
activities, including: marketing—pricing and research; investment
evaluation and coordination; financial management; feasibility studies;
business and operations analysis; supply planning; and mathematics
and systems.
The Jersey story is one you should hear. Make an appointment with your
placement office now to hear it while we re on campus.
