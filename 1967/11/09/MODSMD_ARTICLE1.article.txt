# Health Education 400: Academic Mirage?
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The dean of the education
school calls it a doctoral course,
but the majority of those taking
it are undergraduates. The di
rector of the athletic depart
ment says it is a regular aca
demic course, but his depart
ment recommends athletes take
it to raise their grade point aver
ages. The teacher himself admits
this is happening and is proud
that it is.
The course is Health Educa
tion 400. The teacher is Oliver E.
Byrd. He is head of the Depart
ment of Health Education,
which is nestled in a third floor
corner of the school of educa
tion:
Health Education 400 is listed
in the Stanford Courses And De
grees catalogue as "Individual
Study in Health Sciences." It is
one of six graduate courses of
fered by the department and can
be taken for up to 16 units a
quarter, more than the average
student's total academic load per
quarter at Stanford.

In the summer of 1966 one
student took it for 15 units,
three students enrolled for 12
units, and nine others took be
tween six and ten units.
Two of the students taking 12
and ten units each are members
of the basketball team, and one
student taking eight units is a
football star.
This past summer there were
16 students enrolled in Health
Education 400. One of these, a
football player, took it for eight
units from his home in Los An
geles, mailing in the required
work. He received an A-minus,
one of eleven to receive an A or
A-minus.
The University rules for study
in absentia state that such work
may be done by "graduate stu
dents." Donald H. KaulTman, as
sistant registrar, said yesterday
that only in the rarest cases
could an undergraduate study in
absentia. Only graduate and
terminal graduate students reg
istered in absentia this summer,
he said.

In a regular University quar
ter, spring of 1966, 25 students
enrolled in Health Ed 400, 17 of
them taking between five and
ten units. Nineteen were under
graduates.
When presented with these
facts, Richard W. Lyman, vice
president and provost, said, "If
the situation is as described it
would constitute a serious and
unfortunate situation. Dr. Byrd
has given long service to the
University. It would be grossly
unfair for me to make any fur
ther comment until I've investi
gated."
H. Thomas James, dean of the
education school, says he has no
knowledge that undergraduates
are enrolled in "a doctoral
course." He also says he is un
aware that the athletic depart
ment is recommending the
course as a boost to GPAs.
Phasing Out
There are indications, how
ever, that the department is be
ing slowly phased out by the
University. There are presently

three teachers: Byrd, a full pro
fessor, and two acting assistant
professors, B. Otis Cobb and
Harry E. Bryan.
The department secretary, Ann
Clagstone, said Cobb has not
been reappointed for next year
and suggested that the whole de
partment may disappear when
Byrd retires. That, however, will
not be for three more years.
Chuck Taylor, director of ath
letics, says that his department
recommends students take
Health Ed. courses, but not be
cause they are easy. In an inter
view yesterday, he stated, "Pro
fessor Byrd tells you exactly
what is required to get an A,
and if you are willing to do that
work you can get that A."
"Best Course"
He added that he took Health
Ed 400 when he was an under
graduate at Stanford. He calls it.
"the best course I ever took."
