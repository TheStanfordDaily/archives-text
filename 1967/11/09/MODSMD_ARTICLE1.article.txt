# Health Education 400: Academic Mirage?
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The dean of the education
school calls it a doctoral course,
but the majority of those taking
it are undergraduates. The di
rector of the athletic depart
ment says it is a regular aca
demic course, but his depart
ment recommends athletes take
it to raise their grade point aver
ages. The teacher himself admits
this is happening and is proud
that it is.
The course is Health Educa
tion 400. The teacher is Oliver E.
Byrd. He is head of the Depart
ment of Health Education,
which is nestled in a third floor
corner of the school of educa
tion:
Health Education 400 is listed
in the Stanford Courses And De
grees catalogue as "Individual
Study in Health Sciences." It is
one of six graduate courses of
fered by the department and can
be taken for up to 16 units a
quarter, more than the average
student's total academic load per
quarter at Stanford.

In the summer of 1966 one
student took it for 15 units,
three students enrolled for 12
units, and nine others took be
tween six and ten units.
Two of the students taking 12
and ten units each are members
of the basketball team, and one
student taking eight units is a
football star.
This past summer there were
16 students enrolled in Health
Education 400. One of these, a
football player, took it for eight
units from his home in Los An
geles, mailing in the required
work. He received an A-minus,
one of eleven to receive an A or
A-minus.
The University rules for study
in absentia state that such work
may be done by "graduate stu
dents." Donald H. KaulTman, as
sistant registrar, said yesterday
that only in the rarest cases
could an undergraduate study in
absentia. Only graduate and
terminal graduate students reg
istered in absentia this summer,
he said.

In a regular University quar
ter, spring of 1966, 25 students
enrolled in Health Ed 400, 17 of
them taking between five and
ten units. Nineteen were under
graduates.
When presented with these
facts, Richard W. Lyman, vice
president and provost, said, "If
the situation is as described it
would constitute a serious and
unfortunate situation. Dr. Byrd
has given long service to the
University. It would be grossly
unfair for me to make any fur
ther comment until I've investi
gated."
H. Thomas James, dean of the
education school, says he has no
knowledge that undergraduates
are enrolled in "a doctoral
course." He also says he is un
aware that the athletic depart
ment is recommending the
course as a boost to GPAs.
Phasing Out
There are indications, how
ever, that the department is be
ing slowly phased out by the
University. There are presently

three teachers: Byrd, a full pro
fessor, and two acting assistant
professors, B. Otis Cobb and
Harry E. Bryan.
The department secretary, Ann
Clagstone, said Cobb has not
been reappointed for next year
and suggested that the whole de
partment may disappear when
Byrd retires. That, however, will
not be for three more years.
Chuck Taylor, director of ath
letics, says that his department
recommends students take
Health Ed. courses, but not be
cause they are easy. In an inter
view yesterday, he stated, "Pro
fessor Byrd tells you exactly
what is required to get an A,
and if you are willing to do that
work you can get that A."
"Best Course"
He added that he took Health
Ed 400 when he was an under
graduate at Stanford. He calls it.
"the best course I ever took."
Peter Kmetovic, in charge of
student services for athletes,
notes that athletes in academic


CAN ATHLETICS ... AND ACADEMICS CO-EXIST?

trouble come to him for help. He
suggests they enroll in one of
several courses at Stanford in
which the student can get a
good grade,
Kmetovic says such courses,
popularly known as "Mickey
Mouse" or "gut" courses, are
the type in which athletes won't
flounder in the subject matter,
"the way they do in chemistry,
biology, and other science
courses."
Kmetovic and Taylor careful
ly point out that they see noth
ing wrong with suggesting such
courses. Commenting on Health
Ed, Taylor said, "It is a legiti
mate part of the University cur
riculum, listed in the course
catalogue. I can't question the
academic level of courses offered
by Stanford."
No Problem
Byrd realizes athletes are be
ing directed to his courses and
knows Health Ed 400 is a gradu
ate course, but he is proud that
he can help athletes "help them
selves" and sees no problem in
the undergraduate enrollment.
These views stem from his
philosophy of education, which
he admits differs from the usual
University philosophy. He feels
learning should be "an enjoy
able and even thrilling experi
ence." To achieve that goal, he
says,"I have abandoned some
accepted standards."

He cited three examples of
educational innovations he uses.
"First, I do not allow students
to take notes in class. I feel
note-taking doesn't allow them
to become intellectually involved
with me as I talk." Instead,
Byrd prepares his own notes,
giving them to students at the
end of each lecture,
Byrd, who has been on the
Stanford faculty since 1937, has
also abolished exams. He feels
that especially in courses such
as Health Ed, an exam is no
judge of what a student has
learned.
Unique Grading Method
Finally, he has devised hi s
own method for grading. He
contends that Stanford's artifi
cial percentage breakdown of
how many students should get
an A, how many a B, etc., does
a disservice to students. If
everyone does A work, he feels
everyone should get an A.
Byrd strongly feels that inde
pendent study can be the most
effective way for learning. He
therefore allows undergraduates
to take "Independent Study in
Health Education." He gives
every interested student a list of
requirements and has an indi
vidual talk with them before
they can enroll.
The main requirement in the
course is reading medical jour
nals and preparing abstracts of
articles. He does, however, insist
students pass a short test on the
requirements to stay in the
course.
Quantity Grading
Grading is done simply on the
number of abstracts handed in,
and the more abstracts, the high
er the grade. He states this out
line in the requirement sheet:
"If quality is superior then
the following ratio would be ap
proximately correct: equal num
ber of abstracts each week to
the number of units enrolled for
would represent a C grade, dou
ble the number of abstracts . . .
a B grade, and triple the number
... an A grade."
He notes that the quality of
these abstracts must meet cer
tain academic standards, but
many students who have taken
the course say they could hand
in practically anything.
Byrd keeps a notebook of stu
dent's pictures because he feels
knowing students is the most
important part of his job. He
says,"I am sympathetic and
concerned with students and I've
tried to set up a program that
can help them if they are willing
to work.
"A student is worth saving."

may be done by "graduate stu
dents." Donald H. KaulTman, as
sistant registrar, said yesterday
that only in the rarest cases
could an undergraduate study in
absentia. Only graduate and
terminal graduate students reg
istered in absentia this summer,
he said.

In a regular University quar
ter, spring of 1966, 25 students
enrolled in Health Ed 400, 17 of
them taking between five and
ten units. Nineteen were under
graduates.
When presented with these
facts, Richard W. Lyman, vice
president and provost, said, "If
the situation is as described it
would constitute a serious and
unfortunate situation. Dr. Byrd
has given long service to the
University. It would be grossly
unfair for me to make any fur
ther comment until I've investi
gated."
H. Thomas James, dean of the
education school, says he has no
knowledge that undergraduates
are enrolled in "a doctoral
course." He also says he is un
aware that the athletic depart
ment is recommending the
course as a boost to GPAs.
Phasing Out
There are indications, how
ever, that the department is be
ing slowly phased out by the
University. There are presently

three teachers: Byrd, a full pro
fessor, and two acting assistant
professors, B. Otis Cobb and
Harry E. Bryan.
The department secretary, Ann
Clagstone, said Cobb has not
been reappointed for next year
and suggested that the whole de
partment may disappear when
Byrd retires. That, however, will
not be for three more years.
Chuck Taylor, director of ath
letics, says that his department
recommends students take
Health Ed. courses, but not be
cause they are easy. In an inter
view yesterday, he stated, "Pro
fessor Byrd tells you exactly
what is required to get an A,
and if you are willing to do that
work you can get that A."
"Best Course"
He added that he took Health
Ed 400 when he was an under
graduate at Stanford. He calls it.
"the best course I ever took."
Peter Kmetovic, in charge of
student services for athletes,
notes that athletes in academic


CAN ATHLETICS ... AND ACADEMICS CO-EXIST?

trouble come to him for help. He
suggests they enroll in one of
several courses at Stanford in
which the student can get a
good grade,
Kmetovic says such courses,
popularly known as "Mickey
Mouse" or "gut" courses, are
the type in which athletes won't
flounder in the subject matter,
"the way they do in chemistry,
biology, and other science
courses."
Kmetovic and Taylor careful
ly point out that they see noth
ing wrong with suggesting such
courses. Commenting on Health
Ed, Taylor said, "It is a legiti
mate part of the University cur
riculum, listed in the course
catalogue. I can't question the
academic level of courses offered
by Stanford."
No Problem
Byrd realizes athletes are be
ing directed to his courses and
knows Health Ed 400 is a gradu
ate course, but he is proud that
he can help athletes "help them
selves" and sees no problem in
the undergraduate enrollment.
These views stem from his
philosophy of education, which
he admits differs from the usual
University philosophy. He feels
learning should be "an enjoy
able and even thrilling experi
ence." To achieve that goal, he
says,"I have abandoned some
accepted standards."

He cited three examples of
educational innovations he uses.
"First, I do not allow students
to take notes in class. I feel
note-taking doesn't allow them
to become intellectually involved
with me as I talk." Instead,
Byrd prepares his own notes,
giving them to students at the
end of each lecture,
Byrd, who has been on the
Stanford faculty since 1937, has
also abolished exams. He feels
that especially in courses such
as Health Ed, an exam is no
judge of what a student has
learned.
Unique Grading Method
Finally, he has devised hi s
own method for grading. He
contends that Stanford's artifi
cial percentage breakdown of
how many students should get
an A, how many a B, etc., does
a disservice to students. If
everyone does A work, he feels
everyone should get an A.
Byrd strongly feels that inde
pendent study can be the most
effective way for learning. He
therefore allows undergraduates
to take "Independent Study in
Health Education." He gives
every interested student a list of
requirements and has an indi
vidual talk with them before
they can enroll.
The main requirement in the
course is reading medical jour
nals and preparing abstracts of
articles. He does, however, insist
students pass a short test on the
requirements to stay in the
course.
Quantity Grading
Grading is done simply on the
number of abstracts handed in,
and the more abstracts, the high
er the grade. He states this out
line in the requirement sheet:
"If quality is superior then
the following ratio would be ap
proximately correct: equal num
ber of abstracts each week to
the number of units enrolled for
would represent a C grade, dou
ble the number of abstracts . . .
a B grade, and triple the number
... an A grade."
He notes that the quality of
these abstracts must meet cer
tain academic standards, but
many students who have taken
the course say they could hand
in practically anything.
Byrd keeps a notebook of stu
dent's pictures because he feels
knowing students is the most
important part of his job. He
says,"I am sympathetic and
concerned with students and I've
tried to set up a program that
can help them if they are willing
to work.
"A student is worth saving."
The dean of the education
school calls it a doctoral course,
but the majority of those taking
it are undergraduates. The di
rector of the athletic depart
ment says it is a regular aca

it to raise their grade point aver
ages. The teacher himself admits
this is happening and is proud
that it is.

Two of the students taking 12

football star.
This past summer there were
16 students enrolled in Health

cause they are easy. In an inter
view yesterday, he stated, "Pro
fessor Byrd tells you exactly
what is required to get an A,
and if you are willing to do that
work you can get that A."
"Best Course"
He added that he took Health
Ed 400 when he was an under
graduate at Stanford. He calls it.
"the best course I ever took."

trouble come to him for help. He
suggests they enroll in one of
several courses at Stanford in
which the student can get a
good grade,
Kmetovic says such courses,
popularly known as "Mickey
Mouse" or "gut" courses, are
the type in which athletes won't
flounder in the subject matter,
"the way they do in chemistry,
biology, and other science
courses."
Kmetovic and Taylor careful
ly point out that they see noth
ing wrong with suggesting such
courses. Commenting on Health
Ed, Taylor said, "It is a legiti
mate part of the University cur
riculum, listed in the course
catalogue. I can't question the
academic level of courses offered
by Stanford."
No Problem
Byrd realizes athletes are be
ing directed to his courses and
knows Health Ed 400 is a gradu
ate course, but he is proud that
he can help athletes "help them
selves" and sees no problem in
the undergraduate enrollment.
These views stem from his
philosophy of education, which
he admits differs from the usual
University philosophy. He feels
learning should be "an enjoy
able and even thrilling experi
ence." To achieve that goal, he
says,"I have abandoned some
accepted standards."

He cited three examples of
educational innovations he uses.
"First, I do not allow students
to take notes in class. I feel
note-taking doesn't allow them
to become intellectually involved
with me as I talk." Instead,
Byrd prepares his own notes,
giving them to students at the
end of each lecture,
Byrd, who has been on the
Stanford faculty since 1937, has
also abolished exams. He feels
that especially in courses such
as Health Ed, an exam is no
judge of what a student has
learned.
Unique Grading Method
Finally, he has devised hi s
own method for grading. He
contends that Stanford's artifi
cial percentage breakdown of
how many students should get
an A, how many a B, etc., does
a disservice to students. If
everyone does A work, he feels
everyone should get an A.
Byrd strongly feels that inde
pendent study can be the most
effective way for learning. He
therefore allows undergraduates
to take "Independent Study in
Health Education." He gives
every interested student a list of
requirements and has an indi
vidual talk with them before
they can enroll.
The main requirement in the
course is reading medical jour
nals and preparing abstracts of
articles. He does, however, insist
students pass a short test on the
requirements to stay in the
course.
Quantity Grading
Grading is done simply on the
number of abstracts handed in,
and the more abstracts, the high
er the grade. He states this out
line in the requirement sheet:
"If quality is superior then
the following ratio would be ap
proximately correct: equal num
ber of abstracts each week to
the number of units enrolled for
would represent a C grade, dou
ble the number of abstracts . . .
a B grade, and triple the number
... an A grade."
He notes that the quality of
these abstracts must meet cer
tain academic standards, but
many students who have taken
the course say they could hand
in practically anything.
Byrd keeps a notebook of stu
dent's pictures because he feels
knowing students is the most
important part of his job. He
says,"I am sympathetic and
concerned with students and I've
tried to set up a program that
can help them if they are willing
to work.
"A student is worth saving."
The dean of the education
school calls it a doctoral course,
but the majority of those taking
it are undergraduates. The di
rector of the athletic depart
ment says it is a regular aca
demic course, but his depart
ment recommends athletes take
it to raise their grade point aver
ages. The teacher himself admits
this is happening and is proud
that it is.
The course is Health Educa
tion 400. The teacher is Oliver E.
Byrd. He is head of the Depart
ment of Health Education,
which is nestled in a third floor
corner of the school of educa
tion:
Health Education 400 is listed
in the Stanford Courses And De
grees catalogue as "Individual
Study in Health Sciences." It is
one of six graduate courses of
fered by the department and can
be taken for up to 16 units a
quarter, more than the average
student's total academic load per
quarter at Stanford.

In the summer of 1966 one
student took it for 15 units,
three students enrolled for 12
units, and nine others took be
tween six and ten units.
Two of the students taking 12
and ten units each are members
of the basketball team, and one
student taking eight units is a
football star.
This past summer there were
16 students enrolled in Health
Education 400. One of these, a
football player, took it for eight
units from his home in Los An
geles, mailing in the required
work. He received an A-minus,
one of eleven to receive an A or
A-minus.
The University rules for study
in absentia state that such work
may be done by "graduate stu
dents." Donald H. KaulTman, as
sistant registrar, said yesterday
that only in the rarest cases
could an undergraduate study in
absentia. Only graduate and
terminal graduate students reg
istered in absentia this summer,
he said.

In a regular University quar
ter, spring of 1966, 25 students
enrolled in Health Ed 400, 17 of
them taking between five and
ten units. Nineteen were under
graduates.
When presented with these
facts, Richard W. Lyman, vice
president and provost, said, "If
the situation is as described it
would constitute a serious and
unfortunate situation. Dr. Byrd
has given long service to the
University. It would be grossly
unfair for me to make any fur
ther comment until I've investi
gated."
H. Thomas James, dean of the
education school, says he has no
knowledge that undergraduates
are enrolled in "a doctoral
course." He also says he is un
aware that the athletic depart
ment is recommending the
course as a boost to GPAs.
Phasing Out
There are indications, how
ever, that the department is be
ing slowly phased out by the
University. There are presently

three teachers: Byrd, a full pro
fessor, and two acting assistant
professors, B. Otis Cobb and
Harry E. Bryan.
The department secretary, Ann
Clagstone, said Cobb has not
been reappointed for next year
and suggested that the whole de
partment may disappear when
Byrd retires. That, however, will
not be for three more years.
Chuck Taylor, director of ath
letics, says that his department

able and even thrilling experi
ence." To achieve that goal, he
says,"I have abandoned some
accepted standards."

He cited three examples of
educational innovations he uses.
"First, I do not allow students
to take notes in class. I feel
note-taking doesn't allow them
to become intellectually involved
with me as I talk." Instead,
Byrd prepares his own notes,
giving them to students at the
end of each lecture,
Byrd, who has been on the
Stanford faculty since 1937, has
also abolished exams. He feels
that especially in courses such
as Health Ed, an exam is no
judge of what a student has
learned.
Unique Grading Method
Finally, he has devised hi s
own method for grading. He
contends that Stanford's artifi
cial percentage breakdown of
how many students should get
an A, how many a B, etc., does
a disservice to students. If
everyone does A work, he feels
everyone should get an A.
Byrd strongly feels that inde
pendent study can be the most
effective way for learning. He
therefore allows undergraduates
to take "Independent Study in
Health Education." He gives
every interested student a list of
requirements and has an indi
vidual talk with them before
they can enroll.
The main requirement in the
course is reading medical jour
nals and preparing abstracts of
articles. He does, however, insist
students pass a short test on the
requirements to stay in the
course.
Quantity Grading
Grading is done simply on the
number of abstracts handed in,
and the more abstracts, the high
er the grade. He states this out
line in the requirement sheet:
"If quality is superior then
the following ratio would be ap
proximately correct: equal num
ber of abstracts each week to
the number of units enrolled for
would represent a C grade, dou
ble the number of abstracts . . .
a B grade, and triple the number
... an A grade."
He notes that the quality of
these abstracts must meet cer
tain academic standards, but
many students who have taken
the course say they could hand
in practically anything.
Byrd keeps a notebook of stu
dent's pictures because he feels
knowing students is the most
important part of his job. He
says,"I am sympathetic and
concerned with students and I've
tried to set up a program that
can help them if they are willing
to work.
"A student is worth saving."
The dean of the education
school calls it a doctoral course,
but the majority of those taking
it are undergraduates. The di
rector of the athletic depart
ment says it is a regular aca
demic course, but his depart
ment recommends athletes take
it to raise their grade point aver
ages. The teacher himself admits
this is happening and is proud
that it is.
The course is Health Educa
tion 400. The teacher is Oliver E.
Byrd. He is head of the Depart
ment of Health Education,
which is nestled in a third floor
corner of the school of educa
tion:
Health Education 400 is listed
in the Stanford Courses And De
grees catalogue as "Individual
Study in Health Sciences." It is
one of six graduate courses of
fered by the department and can
be taken for up to 16 units a
quarter, more than the average
student's total academic load per
quarter at Stanford.

In the summer of 1966 one
student took it for 15 units,
three students enrolled for 12
units, and nine others took be
tween six and ten units.
Two of the students taking 12
and ten units each are members
of the basketball team, and one
student taking eight units is a
football star.
This past summer there were
16 students enrolled in Health
Education 400. One of these, a
football player, took it for eight
units from his home in Los An
geles, mailing in the required
work. He received an A-minus,
one of eleven to receive an A or
A-minus.
The University rules for study
in absentia state that such work
may be done by "graduate stu
dents." Donald H. KaulTman, as
sistant registrar, said yesterday
that only in the rarest cases
could an undergraduate study in
absentia. Only graduate and
terminal graduate students reg
istered in absentia this summer,
he said.

In a regular University quar
ter, spring of 1966, 25 students
enrolled in Health Ed 400, 17 of
them taking between five and
ten units. Nineteen were under
graduates.
When presented with these
facts, Richard W. Lyman, vice
president and provost, said, "If
the situation is as described it
would constitute a serious and
unfortunate situation. Dr. Byrd
has given long service to the
University. It would be grossly
unfair for me to make any fur
ther comment until I've investi
gated."
H. Thomas James, dean of the
education school, says he has no
knowledge that undergraduates
are enrolled in "a doctoral
course." He also says he is un
aware that the athletic depart
ment is recommending the
course as a boost to GPAs.
Phasing Out
There are indications, how
ever, that the department is be
ing slowly phased out by the
University. There are presently

three teachers: Byrd, a full pro
fessor, and two acting assistant
professors, B. Otis Cobb and
Harry E. Bryan.
The department secretary, Ann
Clagstone, said Cobb has not
been reappointed for next year
and suggested that the whole de
partment may disappear when
Byrd retires. That, however, will
not be for three more years.
Chuck Taylor, director of ath
letics, says that his department
recommends students take
Health Ed. courses, but not be
cause they are easy. In an inter
view yesterday, he stated, "Pro
fessor Byrd tells you exactly
what is required to get an A,
and if you are willing to do that
work you can get that A."
"Best Course"
He added that he took Health
Ed 400 when he was an under
graduate at Stanford. He calls it.
"the best course I ever took."
Peter Kmetovic, in charge of
student services for athletes,
notes that athletes in academic

trouble come to him for help. He
suggests they enroll in one of
several courses at Stanford in
which the student can get a
good grade,
Kmetovic says such courses,
popularly known as "Mickey
Mouse" or "gut" courses, are
the type in which athletes won't
flounder in the subject matter,
"the way they do in chemistry,
biology, and other science
courses."
Kmetovic and Taylor careful
ly point out that they see noth
ing wrong with suggesting such
courses. Commenting on Health
Ed, Taylor said, "It is a legiti
mate part of the University cur
riculum, listed in the course
catalogue. I can't question the
academic level of courses offered
by Stanford."
No Problem
Byrd realizes athletes are be
ing directed to his courses and
knows Health Ed 400 is a gradu
ate course, but he is proud that
he can help athletes "help them
selves" and sees no problem in
the undergraduate enrollment.
These views stem from his
philosophy of education, which
he admits differs from the usual
University philosophy. He feels
