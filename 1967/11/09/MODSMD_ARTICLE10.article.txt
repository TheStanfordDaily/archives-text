Stanford may have the best swimming team
in the country, but it may also have one of the
least enlightened athletic departments.
The revelations about the health education
department today present a regrettable and
pathetic picture of academics and athletics at
Stanford. It is a picture dominated by a profes
sor's misdirected ideals, an administrator's lack
of awareness, and the athletic department's mis
conceived objectives.
Oliver E. Byrd has spent 30 years at Stanford
educating on the basis of well-intentioned ideals.
He has a genuine concern for students and an
innovative approach to teaching, but his concern
only does harm and his approach is totally un
realistic. Preparing notes for students and drop
ping exams while requiring quantity more than
quality are not ways to challenge a student.
Independent study is fine, but it must be some
thing more than just preparing a predetermined
number of abstracts. The Provost's office should
take immediate action to correct this perversion
of independent study.
The school of education should be alert to its
own departments. When Dean Thomas James
says he is unaware that mostly undergraduates
are enrolled in what he considers a "doctoral
course," he shows a lack of responsibility. The
Daily should not have to point out to Dean
James what is happening two floors above his
office.
But Dean James seems godlike compared to
the athletic department. Stanford claims it has
shown how a highly distinguished school can
field good teams without lowering academic
standards for athletes. Other universities wait to
follow Stanford's lead.
They wait in vain, for Stanford has failed.
Chuck Taylor, director of athletics, recom
mends athletes take certain courses because these
will boost their grade point averages, but he
will not admit these are easy courses. He says
they are part of the university curriculum and
that curriculum, he contends, is uniformly ex
cellent. What need, then, to recommend a par
ticular course?
Taylor's assistant, Peter Kmetovic, claims that
the recommended courses involve as much work
as any others, but include subject matter that

can be more easily grasped. Does he mean that
cranking out a certain number of abstracts a
week constitutes a rigorous academic challenge?
This may take many hours of work, but it is hard
ly an education.
By recommending "mickey mouse" courses,
the athletic department is cheating students.
Stanford enrolls athletes of questionable aca
demic ability and must accept the responsibility
to help the individuals develop. Health Educa
tion 400 is not the way to develop.
The athletic department seems more concern
ed with keeping athletes enrolled than it does
in educating them. Satisfactory grades, not learn
ing, seem the ultimate goal of recommending
special courses.
At Stanford there can be no greater achieve
ment than the growth and development of a stu
dent. The University cannot allow the athletic
department to use these students for selfish pur
poses. A national championship in swimming
is a perverted achievement if it limits even a
single student's education.
