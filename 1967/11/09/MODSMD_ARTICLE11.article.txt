# Hands Off

### 
Outside influences once again threaten to de
termine the nature of a Stanford living group.
Phi Psi National Fraternity is dictating to the
members of the Stanford chapter how they are
to live and select new members.
This is improper in an educational commu
nity. Living groups should be able to evolve as
their members change and the focus of contemp
orary education shifts.
It is imperative that the University declare
openly that it will support the efforts of campus
living groups to secure autonomy. The Univer
sity of Oregon has guaranteed local autonomy in
determining rush procedures. At Berkeley the
Interfraternity and Pan-Hellenic councils re
solved to "support the autonomy of the local
body in selection of the membership."
Such action in favor of local autonomy may
require that Stanford provide financial assistance
to living groups. It will require Stanford to pro
tect them from the pressure of alumni and na
tional organizations.
