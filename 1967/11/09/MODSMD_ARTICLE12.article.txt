# Education Relies On Student Initiative

There is a danger that words
will set us back farther this year
than we realize.
Because there is something
called a committee to study ed
ucation at Stanford, to propose
things called improvements, peo
ple are going to assume that
when those proposals are acted
on that education at Stanford
will have improved. Some basic
assumptions have to be altered
before any change will mean
anything like improving educa
tion, or rather the opportunity
for education.
Except "for a small group of
students with the necessary tal
ents and achievements" who will
be eligible for independent
study SES hasn't gotten away
from the concept of a General
Studies education.
The Stanford General Studies
Requirements, or any modifica
tion of them, are askew to the
concept of education. They are
completely contrary to academic
freedom and stifle the relation
ship between the university and
the undergraduate.
Don't Stereotype
It is academic arrogance to
think that a graduate of Stan
ford should be a certain kind of
person. It is presumptous for
anyone to think in terms of Gen
eral Studies or any similar pro
gram.
General Studies is an embodi
ment of the fact that some peo
ple belipvp thev know what
every "educated man" should
know.
The universities today should
be seething with students who
are throbbing with indecision,
questions, and identity crises.
New ideas aren't going to arise
from a required structure. Any
sort of required structure such
as the General Studies program
immediately spoils the student's
opportunity for himself.
Recommend Rather
Than Require
At least half the freshman
year is spent with required
courses, and more than half, if
the freshman feels the need to
get rid of additional General
Studies requirements before em
barking on his education.
Change the General Studies
requirements to recommenda
tions and say that this program
is designed to turn out people
who can mumble at cocktail
parties.
General Studies recommenda
tions would provide structure
for those who need guidelines,
but would leave others free to
exercise academic freedom in

pursuing a degree (or any other
carrot they wish to run after).
'How I Was Educated'
The old rational "A lot of
engineers have had their eyes
opened to fields like art and re
ligion by being forced to take
courses outside their major"
sounds a lot like a scene out of
"How I Won the War (which
would be a fine General Studies
requirement). The camera pans
a beach covered with ripped
bodies while an officer says, "A
lot of advances in surgery have
come about thanks to war."
Courses taught in the humani
ties and social sciences aren't
going to make engineers and
physicists into individuals con
cerned with the sociological im
plications pf their work. The
idea is absurd.
Who has the right to take him
self so seriously as to say an
engineer should be a certain
kind of person who feels a re
sponsibility to society? It is
up to the engineering depart
ments and physics departments
to introduce the human element
to their students.
Imposing On Others
And who is to say everyone
should be acquainted with the
wonders of science? The oppor
tunity should be there, but be
yond that the word "should" is
irrelevant.
As soon as one starts taking
responsibility for others, he
starts imposing himself on them.
Such imposition is inevitable
in things as large as societies
and cultures but should be kept
to a minimum in universities
where thought should be look
ing out from the peak of the
wave, not wallowing around on
the ocean floor through chan
nels cut by others.
Student's Resopnsibility
Stanford doesn't have a re
sponsibility to educate its under
graduates. That responsibility is
their own.
Stanford is a word which takes
up space in vocabularies and
when interjected in a sentence
is thought to mean something.
It means absolutely nothing.
The closest meaning for Stan
ford is people â€” administrators,
professors, students. The admin
istrators and professors have a
lot to say about what students
do here, but they have no right
to say what students should
learn here.
The only responsibility they
have is to themselves as educa
tors, and one of the first things
an educator has to realize is
that he can't educate anyone but
himself. He can initiate ques
tioning, but only the student can
ask the questions of himself and
think about them.
