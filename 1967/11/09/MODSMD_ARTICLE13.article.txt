## Recognizing Student, Faculty Claims 
### 
Editor, the Dally:
Since Wednesday's Dally
leaves me looking like the stu
dent stereotype of the obtuse
administrator—and this in spite
of the fact that a Daily reporter
(?) called me at my home to
ask If I had been quoted cor
rectly—l wish to clarify the
context in which I made re
marks somewhat resembling
those attributed to me.
The occasion was the "town
meeting" in the large lounge
of Tresidder, called to allow
members of the Stanford com
munity to express their views
on the "position paper" released
by the Steering Committee of
SES in the Dally, October 30.
Mr. Packer asked for ques
tions, and I was the first to
respond. I tried to make it clear
that I endorsed the general
tenor of the paper as a whole,
because I found that in a tenta
tive and preliminary way it had
tried to frame an important
question: what are the legiti
mate claims of the student upon
the University and what are the
University's legitimate claims
upon the student in undergrad
uate education?
A Golden Mean?
The paper rejects the notion
(as do I) that all undergrad
uates would be better off if sim
ply left to themselves to ex
plore, without any supervision
whatsoever, whatever happens

to catch their fancy. The paper
rejects also (as do I) the notion
that all students should be pro
cessed through a series of
monolithic requirements, pre
sumably for their own good.
Once we establish the premise
that both students and the Uni
versity have their legitimate
claims on each other—that a
good educational situation exists
in the proper relationship be
tween these claims—the debate
begins: wherein lies this ideal
"proper relationship"?
Given this context and these
concerns, let us turn to my
opening question about a state
ment in the SES paper.
Not Opposed
Reference was to the section
discussing the possibility of
waiving the language require
ment for some students. The
passage in question reads as
follows: "It is certainly desir
able that as many students as
possible should be motivated to
do so (attain proficiency in a
foreign language); but the de
cision should be made In terms
that are responsive to the needs
and objectives of the individual
student ..." (my bold face).
I am not opposed to waiving
the language requirement in
some instances, but as a general
rule I believe the requirement
to be of great value.
My question to Mr. Packer
was, "Needs and objectives, as

defined by whom?" My intent
was to offer some resistance—
to try to establish the dialectic
between claims of the student
and those of the University—in
this specific instance in the
paper, where I personally felt
that implicitly too much was
being yielded to the claims of
the student. I was simply trying
to point out that the phrase
"needs and objectives" is very
slippery.
Smacking Of Pragmatism
To me, it smacks too much
of the pragmatic, the practical
—principles which to my mind
have become all too much a
part of our educational philoso
phy. If the "needs and objec
tives" of a student are to master
the art of manipulating infor
mation so he can get a good job
with IBM and make a lot of
money, should not the Univers
ity, through required exposure
to the human values inherent in
the study of foreign languages,
history, or science and technol
ogy, attempt to transform the
"needs and objectives' 'of our
wayward student?
Let me hasten to add that I
do not endorse absolute require
ments in any area. But there is
considerable difference between
an educational situation which
sets forth a series of require
ments, with an effective mech
anism for granting intelligent
exemptions from these require

ments (a mechanism which we
now lack, and sorely need), and
one which has no requirements
or guidelines at all.
Somewhere between the "ar
rogance" of professors and the
"arrogance" of half-educated
undergraduates there is a meet
ing place. But to get there each
must begin by recognizing the
legitimate claims of the other,
and must be willing to substi
tute honest dialogue for self
righteous outbursts.
In my opinion the first work
ing paper of SES admirably em
bodies the spirit of honest dia
logue. And while (alas!) it was
sparsely attended, the "town
meeting" was a fine idea and a
stimulating experience.

In the November 6th edition of
The Stanford Daily, Daniel Bern
stein relates his personal deal
ings with some of the adminis
trative processes and officers of
the University, with particular
reference to the problem of non-
ROTC student enrollment in
Military Science courses. Mr.
Bernstein refers specifically to
the difficulty of getting "any
positive statements of position
from representatives of the ad
ministration," and, to my "cau

tion." I have the following com
ments.
1.1 thought that the original
Army policy with respect to
the problem of non-ROTC stu
dent enrollment in Military
Science courses was in error
and said so to Mr. Bernstein.
2. While I cannot recall my exact
words to Mr. Bernstein, I am
sure that I indicated to him
that it would take time to
work out a solution that met
Stanford's interests and cor
rected the error.
3. In fact, the University did se
cure a change in Army policy,
a change which became effect
ive in the current academic
year. My colleague, Vice Pro
vost Herbert L. Packer, was
instrumental in securing this
change.
4.1 did not make the fatuous re
mark that the basis for all my
"operations was keeping peo
ple pleased with each other."
One of the duties of the Uni
versity officers is to identify
problems and to assist in
working out solutions to them,
keeping in mind all legitimate
interests; I know of few cases
in which all parties to a dis
pute are wholly satisfied with
the solution.

Since Wednesday's Dally
leaves me looking like the stu
dent stereotype of the obtuse
administrator—and this in spite
of the fact that a Daily reporter
(?) called me at my home to
ask If I had been quoted cor
rectly—l wish to clarify the
context in which I made re
marks somewhat resembling
those attributed to me.
The occasion was the "town
meeting" in the large lounge
of Tresidder, called to allow
members of the Stanford com
munity to express their views
on the "position paper" released
by the Steering Committee of
SES in the Dally, October 30.
Mr. Packer asked for ques
tions, and I was the first to
respond. I tried to make it clear
that I endorsed the general
tenor of the paper as a whole,
because I found that in a tenta
tive and preliminary way it had
tried to frame an important
question: what are the legiti
mate claims of the student upon
the University and what are the
University's legitimate claims
upon the student in undergrad
uate education?
A Golden Mean?
The paper rejects the notion
(as do I) that all undergrad
uates would be better off if sim
ply left to themselves to ex
plore, without any supervision
whatsoever, whatever happens

to catch their fancy. The paper
rejects also (as do I) the notion
that all students should be pro
cessed through a series of
monolithic requirements, pre
sumably for their own good.
Once we establish the premise
that both students and the Uni
versity have their legitimate
claims on each other—that a
good educational situation exists
in the proper relationship be
tween these claims—the debate
begins: wherein lies this ideal
"proper relationship"?
Given this context and these
concerns, let us turn to my
opening question about a state
ment in the SES paper.
Not Opposed
Reference was to the section
discussing the possibility of
waiving the language require
ment for some students. The
passage in question reads as
follows: "It is certainly desir
able that as many students as
possible should be motivated to
do so (attain proficiency in a
foreign language); but the de
cision should be made In terms
that are responsive to the needs
and objectives of the individual
student ..." (my bold face).
I am not opposed to waiving
the language requirement in
some instances, but as a general
rule I believe the requirement
to be of great value.
My question to Mr. Packer
was, "Needs and objectives, as

defined by whom?" My intent
was to offer some resistance—
to try to establish the dialectic
between claims of the student
and those of the University—in
this specific instance in the
paper, where I personally felt
that implicitly too much was
being yielded to the claims of
the student. I was simply trying
to point out that the phrase
"needs and objectives" is very
slippery.
Smacking Of Pragmatism
To me, it smacks too much
of the pragmatic, the practical
—principles which to my mind
have become all too much a
part of our educational philoso
phy. If the "needs and objec
tives" of a student are to master
the art of manipulating infor
mation so he can get a good job
with IBM and make a lot of
money, should not the Univers
ity, through required exposure
to the human values inherent in
the study of foreign languages,
history, or science and technol
ogy, attempt to transform the
"needs and objectives' 'of our
wayward student?
Let me hasten to add that I
do not endorse absolute require
ments in any area. But there is
considerable difference between
an educational situation which
sets forth a series of require
ments, with an effective mech
anism for granting intelligent
exemptions from these require

ments (a mechanism which we
now lack, and sorely need), and
one which has no requirements
or guidelines at all.
Somewhere between the "ar
rogance" of professors and the
"arrogance" of half-educated
undergraduates there is a meet
ing place. But to get there each
must begin by recognizing the
legitimate claims of the other,
and must be willing to substi
tute honest dialogue for self
righteous outbursts.
In my opinion the first work
ing paper of SES admirably em
bodies the spirit of honest dia
logue. And while (alas!) it was
sparsely attended, the "town
meeting" was a fine idea and a
stimulating experience.

3. In fact, the University did se

a change which became effect

administrator—and this in spite
of the fact that a Daily reporter
(?) called me at my home to
ask If I had been quoted cor
rectly—l wish to clarify the
context in which I made re
marks somewhat resembling
those attributed to me.
The occasion was the "town
meeting" in the large lounge
of Tresidder, called to allow
members of the Stanford com
munity to express their views
on the "position paper" released
by the Steering Committee of
SES in the Dally, October 30.
Mr. Packer asked for ques
tions, and I was the first to
respond. I tried to make it clear
that I endorsed the general
tenor of the paper as a whole,
because I found that in a tenta
tive and preliminary way it had
tried to frame an important
question: what are the legiti
mate claims of the student upon
the University and what are the
University's legitimate claims
upon the student in undergrad
uate education?
A Golden Mean?
The paper rejects the notion
(as do I) that all undergrad
uates would be better off if sim
ply left to themselves to ex
plore, without any supervision
whatsoever, whatever happens

to catch their fancy. The paper
rejects also (as do I) the notion
that all students should be pro
cessed through a series of
monolithic requirements, pre
sumably for their own good.
Once we establish the premise
that both students and the Uni
versity have their legitimate
claims on each other—that a
good educational situation exists
in the proper relationship be
tween these claims—the debate
begins: wherein lies this ideal
"proper relationship"?
Given this context and these
concerns, let us turn to my
opening question about a state
ment in the SES paper.
Not Opposed
Reference was to the section
discussing the possibility of
waiving the language require
ment for some students. The
passage in question reads as
follows: "It is certainly desir
able that as many students as
possible should be motivated to
do so (attain proficiency in a
foreign language); but the de
cision should be made In terms
that are responsive to the needs
and objectives of the individual
student ..." (my bold face).
I am not opposed to waiving
the language requirement in
some instances, but as a general
rule I believe the requirement
to be of great value.
My question to Mr. Packer
was, "Needs and objectives, as

defined by whom?" My intent
was to offer some resistance—
to try to establish the dialectic
between claims of the student
and those of the University—in
this specific instance in the
paper, where I personally felt
that implicitly too much was
being yielded to the claims of
the student. I was simply trying
to point out that the phrase
"needs and objectives" is very
slippery.
Smacking Of Pragmatism
To me, it smacks too much
of the pragmatic, the practical
—principles which to my mind
have become all too much a
part of our educational philoso
phy. If the "needs and objec
tives" of a student are to master
the art of manipulating infor
mation so he can get a good job
with IBM and make a lot of
money, should not the Univers
ity, through required exposure
to the human values inherent in
the study of foreign languages,
history, or science and technol
ogy, attempt to transform the
"needs and objectives' 'of our
wayward student?
Let me hasten to add that I
do not endorse absolute require
ments in any area. But there is
considerable difference between
an educational situation which
sets forth a series of require
ments, with an effective mech
anism for granting intelligent
exemptions from these require

ments (a mechanism which we
now lack, and sorely need), and
one which has no requirements
or guidelines at all.
Somewhere between the "ar
rogance" of professors and the
"arrogance" of half-educated
undergraduates there is a meet
ing place. But to get there each
must begin by recognizing the
legitimate claims of the other,
and must be willing to substi
tute honest dialogue for self
righteous outbursts.
In my opinion the first work
ing paper of SES admirably em
bodies the spirit of honest dia
logue. And while (alas!) it was
sparsely attended, the "town
meeting" was a fine idea and a
stimulating experience.

(?) called me at my home to
ask If I had been quoted cor
rectly—l wish to clarify the
context in which I made re
marks somewhat resembling
those attributed to me.
The occasion was the "town
meeting" in the large lounge
of Tresidder, called to allow
members of the Stanford com
munity to express their views
on the "position paper" released
by the Steering Committee of
SES in the Dally, October 30.
Mr. Packer asked for ques
tions, and I was the first to
respond. I tried to make it clear
that I endorsed the general
tenor of the paper as a whole,
because I found that in a tenta
tive and preliminary way it had
tried to frame an important
question: what are the legiti
mate claims of the student upon
the University and what are the
University's legitimate claims
upon the student in undergrad
uate education?
A Golden Mean?
The paper rejects the notion
(as do I) that all undergrad
uates would be better off if sim
ply left to themselves to ex
plore, without any supervision
whatsoever, whatever happens

to catch their fancy. The paper
rejects also (as do I) the notion
that all students should be pro
cessed through a series of
monolithic requirements, pre
sumably for their own good.
Once we establish the premise
that both students and the Uni
versity have their legitimate
claims on each other—that a
good educational situation exists
in the proper relationship be
tween these claims—the debate
begins: wherein lies this ideal
"proper relationship"?
Given this context and these
concerns, let us turn to my
opening question about a state
ment in the SES paper.
Not Opposed
Reference was to the section
discussing the possibility of
waiving the language require
ment for some students. The
passage in question reads as
follows: "It is certainly desir
able that as many students as
possible should be motivated to
do so (attain proficiency in a
foreign language); but the de
cision should be made In terms
that are responsive to the needs
and objectives of the individual
student ..." (my bold face).
I am not opposed to waiving
the language requirement in
some instances, but as a general
rule I believe the requirement
to be of great value.
My question to Mr. Packer
was, "Needs and objectives, as

defined by whom?" My intent
was to offer some resistance—
to try to establish the dialectic
between claims of the student
and those of the University—in
this specific instance in the
paper, where I personally felt
that implicitly too much was
being yielded to the claims of
the student. I was simply trying
to point out that the phrase
"needs and objectives" is very
slippery.
Smacking Of Pragmatism
To me, it smacks too much
of the pragmatic, the practical
—principles which to my mind
have become all too much a
part of our educational philoso
phy. If the "needs and objec
tives" of a student are to master
the art of manipulating infor
mation so he can get a good job
with IBM and make a lot of
money, should not the Univers
ity, through required exposure
to the human values inherent in
the study of foreign languages,
history, or science and technol
ogy, attempt to transform the
"needs and objectives' 'of our
wayward student?
Let me hasten to add that I
do not endorse absolute require
ments in any area. But there is
considerable difference between
an educational situation which
sets forth a series of require
ments, with an effective mech
anism for granting intelligent
exemptions from these require

ments (a mechanism which we
now lack, and sorely need), and
one which has no requirements
or guidelines at all.
Somewhere between the "ar
rogance" of professors and the
"arrogance" of half-educated
undergraduates there is a meet
ing place. But to get there each
must begin by recognizing the
legitimate claims of the other,
and must be willing to substi
tute honest dialogue for self
righteous outbursts.
In my opinion the first work
ing paper of SES admirably em
bodies the spirit of honest dia
logue. And while (alas!) it was
sparsely attended, the "town
meeting" was a fine idea and a
stimulating experience.

• Gradual Solutions
Editor, The Dally:
In the November 6th edition of
The Stanford Daily, Daniel Bern
stein relates his personal deal
ings with some of the adminis
trative processes and officers of
the University, with particular
reference to the problem of non-
ROTC student enrollment in
Military Science courses. Mr.
Bernstein refers specifically to
the difficulty of getting "any
positive statements of position
from representatives of the ad
ministration," and, to my "cau

tion." I have the following com
ments.
1.1 thought that the original
Army policy with respect to
the problem of non-ROTC stu
dent enrollment in Military
Science courses was in error
and said so to Mr. Bernstein.
2. While I cannot recall my exact
words to Mr. Bernstein, I am
sure that I indicated to him
that it would take time to
work out a solution that met
Stanford's interests and cor
rected the error.
3. In fact, the University did se
cure a change in Army policy,
a change which became effect
ive in the current academic
year. My colleague, Vice Pro
vost Herbert L. Packer, was
instrumental in securing this
change.
4.1 did not make the fatuous re
mark that the basis for all my
"operations was keeping peo
ple pleased with each other."
One of the duties of the Uni
versity officers is to identify
problems and to assist in
working out solutions to them,
keeping in mind all legitimate
interests; I know of few cases
in which all parties to a dis
pute are wholly satisfied with
the solution.
I enjoyed talking with Mr.
Bernstein during the course of
the year's campaign to effect a
change in Army policy.
