# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Life On Earth? 
### Art Buchwald 
There was great excitement
on the planet of Venus this
week. For the first time Ve
nusian scientists managed to
land a satellite on the planet
Earth, and it has been sending
back signals as well as photo
graphs ever since.
The satellite was directed into
an area known as Manhattan
(named after the great Venusi
an astronomer Prof. Manhattan,
who first discovered it with his
telescope 200,000 light years
ago.
Because of excellent weather
conditions and extremely strong
signals, Venusian scientists were
able to get valuable information
as to the feasibility of a manned
flying saucer landing on Earth.
A press conference was held at
the Venus Institute of Technolo
gy-
"We have come to the conclu
sion, based on last week's satel
lite landing," Prof. Zog said,
"that there is no life on Earth."
Composed Of Concrete
"How do you know this?" the
science reporter of the Venus
Evening Star asked.
"For one thing Earth's surface
in the area of Manhattan is com
posed of solid concrete and
nothing can grow there. For
another, the atmosphere is filled
with carbon monoxide and other
deadly gases and nobody could
possibly breathe this air and
survive."
"What does this mean as far
as our flying saucer program is
concerned?"
Con Edison Belt
"We shall have to take our
own oxygen with us, which
means a much heavier flying
saucer than we originally
planned."
"Are there any other hazards
that you discovered in your stud
ies?"
"Take a look at this photo.
You see this dark black cloud
hovering over the surface of
Earth? We call this the Consoli
dated Edison Belt. We don't
know wh&t it is made of, but it
could give us a lot of trouble
and we shall have to make fur
ther tests before we send a Ve
nus Being there.
Drink That?!
"Over here you will notice
what seems to be a river, but
the satellite findings indicate it
is polluted and the water is unfit
to drink. This means we shall
have to carry our own water
which will add even greater
weight to the saucer."
"Sir, what are all those tiny
black spots on the photo
graphs?"
"We're not certain. They seem
to be metal particles that move
along certain paths. They emit
gases, make noise and keep,,
crashing into each other. Thertf
are so many of these paths and
so many metal particles that it
is impossible to land a flying
saucer without being smashed
by one."
"What are those stalagmite
projections sticking up?"
"They're some type of granite
formations that give off light at

night. Prof. Glom has named
them skyscrapers since they
seem to be scraping the skies."
"If all you say is true, won't
this set back the flying saucer
program several years?"
"Yes, but we shall proceed as
soon as the Grubstart gives us
the added funds."
"Prof. Zog, why are we spend
ing billions and billions of zilch
es to land a flying saucer on
Earth when there is no life
there?"
"Because if we Venusians can
learn to breathe in an Earth
atmosphere, then we can live
anywhere."
