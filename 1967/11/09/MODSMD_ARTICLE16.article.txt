## Tuition Tripled In Twenty Years 
### 
(From CPS) — Four-fiths of
the nation's state colleges and
universities have raised tuition,
fees, and room and board rates
this year.
A report just issued by the
National Association of State
Universities and Land Grant
Colleges and the Association of
State Colleges and Universities
says, "Tuition fees, and room
and board charges are rising
so fast and so often that today's
state university senior is pay
ing about 15 per cent more for
his education this year than he
did as a freshman in 1964. This
figure is for in-state seniors;
non-residents are paying 23 per
cent more.
The report adds that increases
in room rates were sharpest at
the big state universities (12
per cent for men and 16 per cent
for women), whereas they were
slightly smaller at smaller
schools.
The two major causes for the
precipitate increases, the report
indicates, are: 1) failure by
state governments to appropri
ate sufficient funds for higher
education and 2) general rising
costs of labor, food and con
struction.
The report also notes that tui
tion is now nearly three times
as high as it was 20 years ago.
As announced last August,
Stanford's own tuition will jump
next year from the current rate
of $1770 to $1920, and similar
rises, are foreseen for "the next
two or three years." However,
Stanford's room and board
costs will remain the same
($1140).
No More Blackball
All fraternities
at Franklin and Marshall Col

lege, beginning this fall, will be
required to eliminate blackball
procedures in which a prospec
tive member may be dismissed
by one vote, or in some cases,
several votes, against him dur
ing his pledge period.
The dismissal instead requires
a two-thirds vote of a chapter's
membership by secret ballot.
This, according to a recommen
dation by a Committee To Study
Student Life, should be done
only "when there is sufficient
sentiment on the part of the
membership that the conduct of
any one of its members is con
trary to their standards of group
living," and not automatically
at the end of the pledge period.
The Committee described the
"social unacceptability blackball"
as "humiliating and unneces
sary", noting that it found "dis
tasteful a practice by which
young men who are considered
acceptable members of the Col
lege community are considered
unacceptable to a self-appointed
organization subordinate to that
community."
The Committee declared that
"students should have the right
to choose their friends and as
sociates, so long as prejudice
or bigotry are not reasons for
rejection" but pointed out that
"so long as a blackball proce
dure exists, members of frater
nities do not in fact have full
right to choose their fellow mem
bers."
Wesleyan Fellows
Nine Fellows
will be in residence at Wesleyan
University's Center for Advanc
ed Studies during the current
academic year.

Paul Horgan, the Pulitzer
prize • winning historian - novel
ist is the Director of the Center
and its first "permanent Fel
low."
The Nine Fellows residing at
the Center, established in 1959,
expressly for bringing distin
guished personalities to Wesley
an, are: Arvid Brodersen, social
scientist; Hans Magnus Enzens
berger, leading German poet;
Gorham Munson, literary histor
ian and critic; Lawrence Clark
Powell, writer, librarian, and
former Dean of the UCLA Li
brary School; Edward Weismil
ler, Milton Scholar, editor of
Prosody; Richard Wilbur, poet;
Huseyin Yilmaz, M.I.T. physicist;
Ralph Young, economist, and
Alan W. Watts, orientalist and
philosopher.
Although the Fellows are en
gaged in their own special proj
ects, the faculty and students of
the University benefit in both
direct and indirect ways.

A large number of the 80
Fellows who have been invited
to the Center since 1959 have
conducted special seminars and
tutorials for students. They also
give public lectures, consult with
faculty members, and attend so
cial and academic affairs.
In establishing the Center, the
Wesley an Trustees believed that
by nuturing some of the most
gifted men and women of our
time in their independent work,
the University might increase
their impact on thought and ac
tion at home and abroad.
'Reasonably Neat'
Yale University has reversed
one of its most staid traditions
—the rule requiring undergrad
uates to wear coats and ties in
the school dining halls.
The new rule, adopted by the
Council of Masters from Yale's
12 residential colleges, now spe
cifies a "reasonably neat appear
ance" for dining hall atten
dance.

The reason for the change,
according to Elias Clark, coun
cil chairman: "We Just felt it
was inappropriate and impracti
cal to enforce a rigid rule" with
regard to dress.

costs will remain the same
($1140).
No More Blackball
All fraternities
at Franklin and Marshall Col

lege, beginning this fall, will be
required to eliminate blackball
procedures in which a prospec
tive member may be dismissed
by one vote, or in some cases,
several votes, against him dur
ing his pledge period.
The dismissal instead requires
a two-thirds vote of a chapter's
membership by secret ballot.
This, according to a recommen
dation by a Committee To Study
Student Life, should be done
only "when there is sufficient
sentiment on the part of the
membership that the conduct of
any one of its members is con
trary to their standards of group
living," and not automatically
at the end of the pledge period.
The Committee described the
"social unacceptability blackball"
as "humiliating and unneces
sary", noting that it found "dis
tasteful a practice by which
young men who are considered
acceptable members of the Col
lege community are considered
unacceptable to a self-appointed
organization subordinate to that
community."
The Committee declared that
"students should have the right
to choose their friends and as
sociates, so long as prejudice
or bigotry are not reasons for
rejection" but pointed out that
"so long as a blackball proce
dure exists, members of frater
nities do not in fact have full
right to choose their fellow mem
bers."
Wesleyan Fellows
Nine Fellows
will be in residence at Wesleyan
University's Center for Advanc
ed Studies during the current
academic year.

Paul Horgan, the Pulitzer
prize • winning historian - novel
ist is the Director of the Center
and its first "permanent Fel
low."
The Nine Fellows residing at
the Center, established in 1959,
expressly for bringing distin
guished personalities to Wesley
an, are: Arvid Brodersen, social
scientist; Hans Magnus Enzens
berger, leading German poet;
Gorham Munson, literary histor
ian and critic; Lawrence Clark
Powell, writer, librarian, and
former Dean of the UCLA Li
brary School; Edward Weismil
ler, Milton Scholar, editor of
Prosody; Richard Wilbur, poet;
Huseyin Yilmaz, M.I.T. physicist;
Ralph Young, economist, and
Alan W. Watts, orientalist and
philosopher.
Although the Fellows are en
gaged in their own special proj
ects, the faculty and students of
the University benefit in both
direct and indirect ways.

A large number of the 80
Fellows who have been invited
to the Center since 1959 have
conducted special seminars and
tutorials for students. They also
give public lectures, consult with
faculty members, and attend so
cial and academic affairs.
In establishing the Center, the
Wesley an Trustees believed that
by nuturing some of the most
gifted men and women of our
time in their independent work,
the University might increase
their impact on thought and ac
tion at home and abroad.
'Reasonably Neat'
Yale University has reversed
one of its most staid traditions
—the rule requiring undergrad
uates to wear coats and ties in
the school dining halls.
The new rule, adopted by the
Council of Masters from Yale's
12 residential colleges, now spe
cifies a "reasonably neat appear
ance" for dining hall atten
dance.

The reason for the change,
according to Elias Clark, coun
cil chairman: "We Just felt it
was inappropriate and impracti
cal to enforce a rigid rule" with
regard to dress.
(From CPS) — Four-fiths of
the nation's state colleges and
universities have raised tuition,
fees, and room and board rates
this year.
A report just issued by the
National Association of State
Universities and Land Grant
Colleges and the Association of
State Colleges and Universities
says, "Tuition fees, and room
and board charges are rising
so fast and so often that today's
state university senior is pay
ing about 15 per cent more for
his education this year than he
did as a freshman in 1964. This
figure is for in-state seniors;
non-residents are paying 23 per
cent more.
The report adds that increases
in room rates were sharpest at
the big state universities (12
per cent for men and 16 per cent
for women), whereas they were
slightly smaller at smaller
schools.
The two major causes for the
precipitate increases, the report
indicates, are: 1) failure by
state governments to appropri
ate sufficient funds for higher
education and 2) general rising
costs of labor, food and con
struction.
The report also notes that tui
tion is now nearly three times
as high as it was 20 years ago.
As announced last August,
Stanford's own tuition will jump
next year from the current rate
of $1770 to $1920, and similar
rises, are foreseen for "the next
two or three years." However,

Wesleyan Fellows
Nine Fellows
will be in residence at Wesleyan
University's Center for Advanc
ed Studies during the current
academic year.

Paul Horgan, the Pulitzer
prize • winning historian - novel
ist is the Director of the Center
and its first "permanent Fel
low."
The Nine Fellows residing at
the Center, established in 1959,
expressly for bringing distin
guished personalities to Wesley
an, are: Arvid Brodersen, social
scientist; Hans Magnus Enzens
berger, leading German poet;
Gorham Munson, literary histor
ian and critic; Lawrence Clark
Powell, writer, librarian, and
former Dean of the UCLA Li
brary School; Edward Weismil
ler, Milton Scholar, editor of
Prosody; Richard Wilbur, poet;
Huseyin Yilmaz, M.I.T. physicist;
Ralph Young, economist, and
Alan W. Watts, orientalist and
philosopher.
Although the Fellows are en
gaged in their own special proj
ects, the faculty and students of
the University benefit in both
direct and indirect ways.

A large number of the 80
Fellows who have been invited
to the Center since 1959 have
conducted special seminars and
tutorials for students. They also
give public lectures, consult with
faculty members, and attend so
cial and academic affairs.
In establishing the Center, the
Wesley an Trustees believed that
by nuturing some of the most
gifted men and women of our
time in their independent work,
the University might increase
their impact on thought and ac
tion at home and abroad.
'Reasonably Neat'
Yale University has reversed
one of its most staid traditions
—the rule requiring undergrad
uates to wear coats and ties in
the school dining halls.
The new rule, adopted by the
Council of Masters from Yale's
12 residential colleges, now spe
cifies a "reasonably neat appear
ance" for dining hall atten
dance.

The reason for the change,
according to Elias Clark, coun
cil chairman: "We Just felt it
was inappropriate and impracti
cal to enforce a rigid rule" with
regard to dress.
(From CPS) — Four-fiths of
the nation's state colleges and
universities have raised tuition,
fees, and room and board rates
this year.
A report just issued by the
National Association of State
Universities and Land Grant
Colleges and the Association of
State Colleges and Universities
says, "Tuition fees, and room
and board charges are rising
so fast and so often that today's
state university senior is pay
ing about 15 per cent more for
his education this year than he
did as a freshman in 1964. This
figure is for in-state seniors;
non-residents are paying 23 per
cent more.
The report adds that increases
in room rates were sharpest at
the big state universities (12
per cent for men and 16 per cent
for women), whereas they were
slightly smaller at smaller
schools.
The two major causes for the
precipitate increases, the report
indicates, are: 1) failure by
state governments to appropri
ate sufficient funds for higher
education and 2) general rising
costs of labor, food and con
struction.
The report also notes that tui
tion is now nearly three times
as high as it was 20 years ago.
As announced last August,
Stanford's own tuition will jump
next year from the current rate
of $1770 to $1920, and similar
rises, are foreseen for "the next
two or three years." However,
Stanford's room and board
costs will remain the same
($1140).
No More Blackball
All fraternities
at Franklin and Marshall Col

lege, beginning this fall, will be
required to eliminate blackball
procedures in which a prospec
tive member may be dismissed
by one vote, or in some cases,
several votes, against him dur
ing his pledge period.
The dismissal instead requires
a two-thirds vote of a chapter's
membership by secret ballot.
This, according to a recommen
dation by a Committee To Study
Student Life, should be done
only "when there is sufficient
sentiment on the part of the
membership that the conduct of
any one of its members is con
trary to their standards of group
living," and not automatically
at the end of the pledge period.
The Committee described the
"social unacceptability blackball"
as "humiliating and unneces
sary", noting that it found "dis
tasteful a practice by which
young men who are considered
acceptable members of the Col
lege community are considered
unacceptable to a self-appointed
organization subordinate to that
community."
The Committee declared that
"students should have the right
to choose their friends and as
sociates, so long as prejudice
or bigotry are not reasons for
rejection" but pointed out that
"so long as a blackball proce
dure exists, members of frater
nities do not in fact have full
right to choose their fellow mem
bers."
