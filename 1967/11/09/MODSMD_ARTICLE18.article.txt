# McGill Paper Under Attack For Alleged Satire Obscenity
## 
### 
MONTREAL (CPS) â€” About
25 student demonstrators forced
the administration at McGill
University to postpone a meet
ing yesterday called to decide on
the punishment for three mem
bers of the student newspaper
staff who are involved in a heat
ed controversy here.
The demonstrators blocked
the room where the disciplinary

committee, composed of admin
istrators, was to meet. The ad
ministration said another meet
ing would not be attempted un
til next week.
The three student editors have
been in hot water with the ad
ministration since the newspa
per published an article purport
ing to be passages cut from Wil
liam Manchester's book, Death

Of A President. The newspaper
has been strongly criticized by
Montreal citizens, McGill alum
ni, and many members of the
campus community, who have
charged that the article was ob
scene.
However, a campus organiza
tion called Students for a Demo
cratic University, has supported
the right of the editors to print
the article. It was this group
which blocked the administra
tive meeting today. The group
plans to dramatize the issue by
staging a sleep-in at the admin
istration building tonight.
The SDU is demanding that
the university drop charges
against the students involved;
replace the present code of stu
dent discipline by a code made
up by a faculty-student commit
tee; end control over the McGill
Daily, and guarantee a much
greater student voice in disci
plinary and other matters on
campus.
The article which the newspa
per published last Friday origi
nally appeared in the April edi
tion of The Realist, an American
satirical magazine edited by
Paul Krassner. Its final section,
which is generally considered
the most offensive, describes
President Johnson performing a
sexual act with the body of the
late President Kennedy.
