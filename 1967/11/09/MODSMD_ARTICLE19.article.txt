SACRAMENTO (AP) â€”
Youngsters who take dangerous
drugs or marijuana do not ne
cessarily graduate to addictive
drugs, the California Youth Au
thority said Tuesday.
A report prepared by the
Youth Authority and the Insti
tution for the Study of Crime
and Delinquency says "a ma
jority of young people arrested
for non-opiate drug offenses
were never arrested again for
subsequent narcotics viola
tions."
Retiring Youth Authority Di
rector Heman G. Stark, also
vice president of the institute,
said the report "underscores the

importance of treating young
people who take to drugs at as
early an age as possible."
The report said a study of
886 juveniles arrested in Los
Angeles in 1960 and 1961 for
using non-opiate drugs showed
58 per cent were never again
arrested. Only 12 per cent were
arrested later for using opiates
and 30 per cent for repeated use
of non-addictive drugs, the re
port said.
While the use of opiates
among young people has been
declining, the report said,
"There has been a rapid rise in
the use of psychedelic drugs,
particularly among young in
tellectual and student groups."
