# Gen. Hershey Says 'Induct Obstructors'
## 
### 
General Lewis Hershey, Di
rector of Selective Service,
wrote a letter to all local draft
boards recommending that they
draft students who physically
obstruct .government recruiters.
Hershey said yesterday that
his Oct. 26 draft deferment re
vocation order does not apply
to persons legally protesting
the draft or the Vietnam war.
The letter was released yes
terday in Washington.
In the letter dated Oct. 26,
General Hershey noted that stu
dent deferments were "given
only when they serve the na
tional interest." By the same
token, he said, anyone who vio
lates the Selective Service Act
or any of its regulations or op
erations should be denied a de
ferment in the national interest.
Disclosure of General Hersh
ey's letter to local draft boards
across the country followed in
cidents in which recruiters for
the armed forces as well as
the Dow Chemical Company,
which manufactures napalm for
use in Vietnam, were blocked
by student antiwar demonstra
tors.
General Hershey's suggestion
to the local boards, which have
final responsibility for who is
drafted, also applies to anyone
who deliberately refuses to
carry his draft card or who in
vades a Selective Service office
to disrupt its operations.
"It follows that illegal activ
ity which interferes with re
cruiting or causes refusal of
duty in the military or naval
forces could not by any stretch
of the imagination be construed
as being in support of the na
tional interest," he said.
General Hershey's letter
made no mention of the anti
recruitment incidents. But a
spokesman in his office said it
was clear that the general con
sidered any interference with a
recruiting officer to be illegal.
"There's nothing new in
this," the spokesman said. "It's
been here in the law all along.
The attitude now is "let's en
force the law.' "
He said local draft boards had

authority to drop student defer
ments for such conduct because
of the Selective Service's re
sponsibility to furnish man
power for the armed forces.
He referred to a provision In
the law providing penalties for
"any person who shall know
ingly hinder or interfere or at
tempt to do so in any way by
force or violence or otherwise"
with the work of the Selective
Service.
When a local board receives
information about someone in
volved in an "illegal" demon
stration, General Hershey said,
the board may reclassify him,
declare him a delinquent and
order him to report for induc
tion if it has evidence of a vio
lation of law.
Students who are notified of a
loss of their so-called "2-S" col
lege deferment and are now
"1-A" can appeal, the spokes
man said. Delinquents are
placed at the top of priority list
for drafting.

General Hershey noted that stu
dent deferments were "given
only when they serve the na
tional interest." By the same
token, he said, anyone who vio
lates the Selective Service Act
or any of its regulations or op
erations should be denied a de
ferment in the national interest.
Disclosure of General Hersh
ey's letter to local draft boards
across the country followed in
cidents in which recruiters for
the armed forces as well as
the Dow Chemical Company,
which manufactures napalm for
use in Vietnam, were blocked
by student antiwar demonstra
tors.
General Hershey's suggestion
to the local boards, which have
final responsibility for who is
drafted, also applies to anyone
who deliberately refuses to
carry his draft card or who in
vades a Selective Service office
to disrupt its operations.
"It follows that illegal activ
ity which interferes with re
cruiting or causes refusal of
duty in the military or naval
forces could not by any stretch
of the imagination be construed
as being in support of the na
tional interest," he said.
General Hershey's letter
made no mention of the anti
recruitment incidents. But a
spokesman in his office said it
was clear that the general con
sidered any interference with a
recruiting officer to be illegal.
"There's nothing new in
this," the spokesman said. "It's
been here in the law all along.
The attitude now is "let's en
force the law.' "
He said local draft boards had

authority to drop student defer
ments for such conduct because
of the Selective Service's re
sponsibility to furnish man
power for the armed forces.
He referred to a provision In
the law providing penalties for
"any person who shall know
ingly hinder or interfere or at
tempt to do so in any way by
force or violence or otherwise"
with the work of the Selective
Service.
When a local board receives
information about someone in
volved in an "illegal" demon
stration, General Hershey said,
the board may reclassify him,
declare him a delinquent and
order him to report for induc
tion if it has evidence of a vio
lation of law.
Students who are notified of a
loss of their so-called "2-S" col
lege deferment and are now
"1-A" can appeal, the spokes
man said. Delinquents are
placed at the top of priority list
for drafting.
General Lewis Hershey, Di
rector of Selective Service,
wrote a letter to all local draft
boards recommending that they
draft students who physically
obstruct .government recruiters.
Hershey said yesterday that
his Oct. 26 draft deferment re
vocation order does not apply
to persons legally protesting
the draft or the Vietnam war.
The letter was released yes
terday in Washington.
