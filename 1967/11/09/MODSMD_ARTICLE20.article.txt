# Mideast Situation
## U.S. Action, Mixed Reaction 
### JOHN R. ALCORN 
Recent U.S. action on the Mid
dle East has drawn mixed feel
ings from Stanford professors
who signed a petition calling for
"direct negotiations between Is
rael and her neighbors."
A House of Representatives
vote to ban imports of Egyp
tian cotton and resume Ameri
can arms shipments to Israel re
ceived both approval and con
demnation from the supporters
of the petition, which appeared
in the Oct. 24 New York Times.
Nobel Laureate Arthur Rom
berg, professor of biochemistry,
stated in an earlier interview
with the Daily, "We would like
to see a political and economic
reconstruction, working towards
a permanent peace [in the Mid
dle East]."
Whether the recent actions by
the government will produce
such a "political and economic
reconstruction" was the question
which caused dissent among the
signers of the petition.
Favors Ban
James McGregor, a mathemat
ics professor, favors the action
taken by the House, although
the Senate is expected to vote
down the bill, and, in the words
of one high ranking government
official, the vote in the House
"will not help to decrease ten
sions in the Mideast."
"Militarily, the Arabs have
been continually provocative in
the past," McGregor said, and
"Egypt has reduced food produc
tion in order to grow more cot
ton." He maintained that Egypt
uses the money from cotton
sales to buy arms, and therefore
he did approve of banning Egyp
tian cotton imports.
The Arab-Israeli conflict is "a
typical instance of a local situa
tion which could be resolved ex
cept for the pressure of the ma
jor powers," asserted Avram
Goldstein, professor of pharma
cology.
He stated that he would like
to see the major powers get out,

and direct negotiations between
Israel and the Arab states be
gin. Goldstein maintained that
"as long as the big powers stay
in, catastrophe will eventually
result for the Middle East."
UN Could Be Used
He remarked that the United
Nations could be used effective
ly to resolve the crisis if the big
powers really wanted a lasting
solution.
Samuel Karlin, a mathematics
professor, stated, "I do not think
that it was wise to ban imports
on Egyptian cotton. America
shouldn't take this kind of be
hind-the-scenes action."
He added that the United
States "should certainly support
Israel because it is a democratic
and Western nation faced with
the possibility of annihilation."
Karlin believes that at the
same time the United States
should try to re-establish rela
tions with the Arab countries
and to appeal to the "moderate
and progressive factions" within
them, rather than alienate them
still further by economic means.
Reaction To Vote
Romberg's immediate reac
tion to the House vote was, "I
don't have the competence to
judge a complicated politico

economic issue of this kind. The
situation has so many overtones
as to what is apparent."
He did remark, however, that
"our main interest is to see sta
ble governments throughout the
Middle East. We certainly don't
want to see Egypt impover
ished."
Menahem A. Schiffer, a math
ematics professor who taught in
Israel for ten years and visited
the Middle East two years ago,
looked at the recent action from
a different perspective.
"We should not view the Mid
dle East situation only from an
Arab-Israeli conflict point of
view; this is only part of a much
larger context." He noted that
"Congress was probably acting
more in regard to Soviet-Egyp
tian relations than in response
to the Arab-Israeli conflict." He
also took into account economic
factors which might have per
suaded the House to ban Egyp
tian cotton.
Schiffer cautioned that the
United States must not drive
Egypt into the arms of the So
viet Union, and that it would be
to the best interest of the United

States to help create and main
tain a stable Middle East situa
tion.

economic issue of this kind. The

as to what is apparent."
He did remark, however, that

Menahem A. Schiffer, a math

Israel for ten years and visited
the Middle East two years ago,
looked at the recent action from
a different perspective.
"We should not view the Mid
dle East situation only from an
Arab-Israeli conflict point of
view; this is only part of a much
larger context." He noted that
"Congress was probably acting
more in regard to Soviet-Egyp
tian relations than in response
to the Arab-Israeli conflict." He
also took into account economic
factors which might have per
suaded the House to ban Egyp
tian cotton.
Schiffer cautioned that the
United States must not drive
Egypt into the arms of the So

Recent U.S. action on the Mid

who signed a petition calling for
"direct negotiations between Is

A House of Representatives
vote to ban imports of Egyp

Whether the recent actions by

James McGregor, a mathemat

taken by the House, although
the Senate is expected to vote
down the bill, and, in the words
of one high ranking government
official, the vote in the House
"will not help to decrease ten

"Militarily, the Arabs have
been continually provocative in
the past," McGregor said, and
"Egypt has reduced food produc

uses the money from cotton
sales to buy arms, and therefore
he did approve of banning Egyp
tian cotton imports.
The Arab-Israeli conflict is "a
typical instance of a local situa

Goldstein, professor of pharma

He stated that he would like
to see the major powers get out,

and direct negotiations between
Israel and the Arab states be

"as long as the big powers stay

result for the Middle East."

can arms shipments to Israel re
ceived both approval and con
demnation from the supporters
of the petition, which appeared
in the Oct. 24 New York Times.
Nobel Laureate Arthur Rom
berg, professor of biochemistry,
stated in an earlier interview
with the Daily, "We would like
to see a political and economic
reconstruction, working towards
a permanent peace [in the Mid
dle East]."
Whether the recent actions by
the government will produce
such a "political and economic
reconstruction" was the question
which caused dissent among the
signers of the petition.
Favors Ban
James McGregor, a mathemat
ics professor, favors the action
taken by the House, although
the Senate is expected to vote
down the bill, and, in the words
of one high ranking government
official, the vote in the House
"will not help to decrease ten
sions in the Mideast."
"Militarily, the Arabs have
been continually provocative in
the past," McGregor said, and
"Egypt has reduced food produc
tion in order to grow more cot
ton." He maintained that Egypt
uses the money from cotton
sales to buy arms, and therefore
he did approve of banning Egyp
tian cotton imports.
The Arab-Israeli conflict is "a
typical instance of a local situa
tion which could be resolved ex
cept for the pressure of the ma
jor powers," asserted Avram
Goldstein, professor of pharma
cology.
He stated that he would like
to see the major powers get out,

and direct negotiations between
Israel and the Arab states be
gin. Goldstein maintained that
"as long as the big powers stay
in, catastrophe will eventually
result for the Middle East."
UN Could Be Used
He remarked that the United
Nations could be used effective
ly to resolve the crisis if the big
powers really wanted a lasting
solution.
Samuel Karlin, a mathematics
professor, stated, "I do not think
that it was wise to ban imports
on Egyptian cotton. America
shouldn't take this kind of be
hind-the-scenes action."
He added that the United
States "should certainly support
Israel because it is a democratic
and Western nation faced with
the possibility of annihilation."
Karlin believes that at the
same time the United States
should try to re-establish rela
tions with the Arab countries
and to appeal to the "moderate
and progressive factions" within
them, rather than alienate them
still further by economic means.
Reaction To Vote
Romberg's immediate reac
tion to the House vote was, "I
don't have the competence to
judge a complicated politico

economic issue of this kind. The
situation has so many overtones
as to what is apparent."
He did remark, however, that
"our main interest is to see sta
ble governments throughout the
Middle East. We certainly don't
want to see Egypt impover
ished."
Menahem A. Schiffer, a math
ematics professor who taught in
Israel for ten years and visited
the Middle East two years ago,
looked at the recent action from
a different perspective.
"We should not view the Mid
dle East situation only from an
Arab-Israeli conflict point of
view; this is only part of a much
larger context." He noted that
"Congress was probably acting
more in regard to Soviet-Egyp
tian relations than in response
to the Arab-Israeli conflict." He
also took into account economic
factors which might have per
suaded the House to ban Egyp
tian cotton.
Schiffer cautioned that the
United States must not drive
Egypt into the arms of the So
viet Union, and that it would be
to the best interest of the United

States to help create and main
tain a stable Middle East situa
tion.
