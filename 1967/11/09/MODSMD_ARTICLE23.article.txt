# Big Game Festivities In The Works
## 
### ALEX TOWER 
When dawn broke on the
Farm last Sunday morning, it
was discovered that some things
had disappeared during the
night: the goalposts on the
practice fields.
It was the start of the annual
Big Game R.F.'s. Cal students
had snuck in under the cover
of darkness and made off with
the first prize in the 1967 hijinks.
Cal has not shown up here
since, nor have any Farmers
been at work in Berkeley. But
with the Big Game only nine
days away, things should begin
to happen soon.
SVe are fully expecting some
-7 most any night," a Stan-
Police Department spokes
said.
No "R.F.'s"
Neil Okabayashi, vice-presi
dent of Axe Comm, said that he
did not know of any definite
R.F.'s planned by the Stanford
Community. A few small groups

from here have gone over to Cal
in attempts to learn the where
abouts of the coveted Axe, which
was stolen from its locked case
last year by unknown Berkeley
ites.
No clues have been discovered,
however.
According to Okabayashi,
"There are some plans that are
kind of serious, but as of now
there is only a slim chance of
stealing it back, and it really de
pends on developments during
the next week."
He conjectured that the Axe
would return to Stanford, how
ever, although probably in the
hands of Cal students.
Not bringing it to the Big
Game, Okabayashi stated, would
be "an exercise in futility, be
cause the purpose of having it
is to display it to boost the
morale. If they don't bring it out,
it will show a decline in Bear
mentality."
There will be a meeting to

morrow between Cal and Stan
ford students to discuss the pres
entation of the Axe during half
time and other halftime activi
ties. Members of the Cardinal
Board and Axe Comm will repre
sent Stanford.
Display Planned
The Axe is always displayed
during halftime as a morale
booster and is later awarded to
the winner of the game. Because
the Axe was stolen last spring,
there will probably be a neces
sity for police protection this
year.
Despite the absence of the
Axe, Stanford is going ahead
with its usual Big Game plans.
The highlight of the pre-game
events will be the traditional
rally and bonfire on Lake Lag,
beginning at 6:30 Friday eve
ning, November 17.
According to Axe Comm, at
least 10,000 people are expected
to show up for the festivities.
Several Stanford alumni who
have been prominent in football
have been asked to speak at the
rally, although none have yet
accepted.
Those invited include Ernie
Nevers, now the president of the
Northern California Football
Foundation and The Hall of
Fame Scholarship Awards; Phil
Hoffatt; Milt Vucivich; Frankie
Albert; and John Brodie, quar
terback for the San Francisco
49'ers.
Bonfire
As usual, the bonfire will be
built by the freshman men, this

year headed by Adam Bennion,
who has also organized the vol
unteers into building crews and
groups to guard the campus
against Cal vandalism next
week.
Telephone poles will form the
bulk of the bonfire, with orange
crates filling the gaps. The re
sult, according to Bennion, will
be a bonfire which will easily
lend itself to premature incinera
tion.
In 1921, planes from Cal flew
over the campus and dropped
bombs at the unlit woodpile, but
missed their target. There is
nothing to stop them from try
ing again, however.
Before the bonfire will be a
"Bury the Bear" rally at noon,
Wednesday, in White Plaza.
Plans are being made to lay the
Golden Bear of Cal to rest. Any
one seen in Cal's blue and yel
low colors should be ready to
face the consequences.
Okabayashi remarked, "The
game is for most people a ra
tionale for having parties."
There are a good number of
orgies planned."
On Friday night and Saturday
morning, members of Axe
Comm will go into San Fran
cisco to the reunions of the
classes of '27, '32, '37, '42, '47, '52,
'57, and '62, and sell them feath
ers, buttons and pom pons to
wear to the game.
Prize For Decorations
Homecoming decorations, bas
ed on the theme "Indians, Hang
Bear Axe Bandits," will be

judged Saturday morning. The
prizes will be given at halftime.
Various living groups, mainly
fraternities and row houses, will
make up the decorations.
Friday night after the bonfire,
there will be a street dance on
the lower row.
The real orgies will begin Sat
urday night, when the fraterni
ties leave the campus for their
parties.
Okabayashi, a Zeta Psi, de
scribed these evenings as "one
long party, the greatest party
of the quarter, greatest party
of the year, because we are all
one big happy family. It is also
an evening of sin, debauchery,
and revelry."
Motels as far away as Carmel
and Santa Cruz are rented by
the fraternities.
Also planned for Saturday
night is The Induction, a party
sponsored by the freshmen.
Nearly 1000 people are expected

to jam Wilbur Hall, where the
party will be located. Each
house will provide different en
tertainment.
There will be old movies, two
light shows, and five bands play
ing from 7:15 until 3 a.m. The
bands are the Mourning Reign,
The Grapes of Wrath, The Liv
ing Color, The Midnight Haze,
and The Flower.
Tickets to The Induction are
available from the dorm social
chairmen at a cost of $2 until
Nov. 13, and $3 thereafter.
While all the plans for festivi
ties continue, the R.F.'s still lurk
in the background. Okabayashi
had only a tentative explanation
for the dearth of pranks so far.
"Maybe it is just a lack of
freshman spirit, maybe every
one is sick of useless messy
pranks," he said. "Stanford stu
dents are sophisticated, and we
have to give them something
new, something with class."
