# Otis—Humanity's Ice Cream Vendor
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Chuck Williams takes the snap
from center, retreats into the
pocket and looks downfleld. Gene
Washington gives his man a hip
fake to the inside and cuts for
the sideline.
He gathers in the perfect pass
and, tightroping the chalkline,
skitters for ten more yards be
fore being tackled. There is scat
tered applause and a few cheers
from the Stanford rooting sec
tion.
No Noise ...
The head cheerleader grabs
the microphone. Waving his fist
in the air, he exhorts the crowd.
"Let's have some noise when
that huddle breaks!" he screams.
"Go wild! Bedlam up there!"
He sighs in disgust as per
haps a hundred students raise
their voices half-heartedly.
... Without Otis
An ice cream vendor, with his
ample belly protruding from
under a sweat-soaked T-shirt,
sets down his tray of orange ice
bars and begins to clap his
hands.
"Go! Go! Go!" he shouts in a
hoarse, rasping voice. The crowd
sparks immediately to life, join
ing in the chant.
Students wrap their arms
around each others shoulders,
and entire rows of humanity be
gin swaying back and forth in
time to the vendor's gyrations.
The roar is deafening.
"OTIS! OTIS! OTIS!"
Clowns Are People
The source of this sudden
awakening grins as he surveys
his crowd. Otis, of course, has
been a Stanford institution for
as long as anyone seems to be
able to remember.

Cracking jokes, bird-dogging
dates, and frugging in the aisles,
he is known and loved by almost
everyone who attends football
games regularly.
He keeps the fans laughing,
and has the unself-conscious en
thusiasm to marshall their school
spirit as no cheerleader has ever
been able to do. He is the eternal
clown, the simple, lovable buf
foon.
His Name Is Otis, but...
His name actually is Otis, but
it's his last name, not his first.
Harrison G. Otis, 909 California
Ave., Palo Alto. Thirty-nine
years old, unmarried, lives with
his mother. Professional vendor.
Loves his work. A very simple
man with some deeply held opin
ions about the world.
One gets several impressions
talking with Otis. He is a big
man, over six feet, with a
paunchy beer belly. He is far
from handsome.
His eyes peer craggily out
from deep sockets, and his con
stant smile reveals crooked, yel
low teeth. His ears protrude bul
bously, and his sandy hair is
close-cropped and unkempt.
Small Child With Big Words
Otis' voice sounds like a
squeaky foghorn. He speaks
haltingly, as if mulling over the
meaning of each phrase as he
pronounces it. He tries to use
big words, but they often come
out in a mixed up, funny way.
His sentences are fragmented
and rambling, and one is re
minded of a small child strug
gling to express himself with
words that he just doesn't quite
understand.
But it's impossible to escape
the aura of friendliness which
surrounds Otis. He smiles con

stantly, and his eyes sparkle
with boyish enthusiasm for al
most everything.
A 100 Per Cent Optimist
"I'm a 100 per cent optimist,"
Otis said as he slouched in an
easy chair in the small living
room of his mother's house. He
sipped at a root beer."The world
is filled with wonderful people,
and they're the same the world
over."
Otis began selling ice cream
when he was nine years old. In
thirty years of vending at foot
ball games, state fairs, auto
races, and Beatle concerts, he
has entertained millions of hu
man beings. He mentioned with
obvious pride some of the people
he has sold ice cream to — John
Kennedy, Earl Warren, Dwight
Eisenhower, Richard Nixon.
"Big powerful people like to
have a good time just like every
body else," Otis said. "They like
simplicity."
Otis has full confidence in to
day's younger people, especially
Stanford students.
"I have 100 per cent optimism
for youth," he said. "I can see it
in their faces. They have more
compassion for their fellow man,
more feeling for humanity. You
can feel it. Youngsters take more
part in the community. They
will be tremendous leaders
of tomorrow."
Youth Needs More Fun
Talking further about the
growing seriousness and dedi
cation of young people, he call
ed it " . . . good, but they need
more fun."
Perhaps this is the secret of
Otis' popularity — he provides
serious people with a little fun.
Many Stanford students con
sider themselves too intellectual
to get excited about a complet-

Ed pass or a stolen Big Game
Axe. Otis' obvious non-intellec
tualism and child-like enthus
iasm are a welcome break from
being serious.
"He's A Nut!"
One student explained, "What
I like about the guy is that he's
so spontaneous and uninhibited."
"He's a nut!" proclaimed an
other. "We need a few nuts
around here, I mean besides the
serious ones."
Otis put it this way. "You've
got to let your hair down or
you'll crack under all the pres
sures of society and with all
the taxation."
Hair-Letter-Downers
Otis' repertoire of guaranteed
hair - letter - downers includes,
for example, "Buy a Coke and
help send my mother to Planned
Parenthood!" An equally irresis
table sales pitch is "Yummy,
Yummy, good for the tummy,
better than LSD!"
And who would dare refuse to
buy a malt from a vendor whose
dear Aunt Ruby desperately
needed money to repair her Har
ley Hog which had been damag
ed in a recent rumble?
"I just like to make people
happy," says Otis. "I don't want
to see anybody sad."
His Own Contribution
Otis brings happiness to more
than just Stanford football
crowds. He does volunteer work
with retarded children and juve
nile delinquents. He's spent
many hours entertaining, en
couraging and inspiring disabled
veterans at Palo Alto Hospital.
"You should see him work
with those guys," said Wayne,
an unemployed jack-of-all-trades
who also volunteers his time in
the veteran's ward. "He's just
great."

Otis explained, "I may not be
a success in monetary gains, but
I make a contribution to so
ciety in my own way. I mak?
people laugh."
Not Ignorance Of Unpleasant
Otis' "100 per cent optimism"
is not merely blissful ignorance
of the more unpleasant facts of
life. A nagging back injury re
minds him constantly of his com
bat days in the Korean War.
But apparently this experience
has made him all the more de
termined to keep smiling his
toothy grin and wearing his out
landish hats.
"I've seen Korea and Hiro
shima," he says. "After the
tragedy of war, I want to cheer
people up."
Make Things Easier On Man
My final question to Otis was,
"What is your goal in life?"
He tilted his head, reached
under his T-shirt, and after
thoughtfully scratching for a
few moments, said, "I'm just
going to try and make things
easier on humanity. That's all I
want."
