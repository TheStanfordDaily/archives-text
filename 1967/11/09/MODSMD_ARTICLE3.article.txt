# Israeli Peace Seen Distant By Official
## 
### 
Aharon S. Kidan, special as
sistant to Israel's premier Levi
Eskol, said last night in Tre
sidder that peace in the Middle
East would be reached only on
Israel's terms.
"We want peace but if it does
not come tomorrow we can
wait," he said to an overflow
crowd composed mostly of mem
bers of the Hillel foundation
which sponsored his talk.
Israel wanted peace badly be
fore the June war With the
Arabs, Kidan said, but now "the
shoe is on the other foot" be
cause the burden of defense ex
penditures and constant fear of
destructive attack fall on the
Arabs more than the Israelies.
Israel now "is not terribly
pressed to give anything up to
gain a peace settlement," he
noted. A war of border incidents
may drag on for years and
some Israeli factions argue the
nation must resign itself to a
perpetual state of readiness.
Kidan would say only that peace
is up to the Arabs.
Economic losses and the Is
raeli control of the Suez canal
seem to be pushing Egypt to
ward the conference table, Ki
dan noted, and Jordan's political
"disintegration" raised hopes
for a peace with that Arab
state.
In a tart comment on U.S.
policy toward Israel, Kidan
claimed U.S. policy was to en
sure a "balance of arms" in the
Middle East that meant Israel
would have "one plane for every
three Arab planes."
