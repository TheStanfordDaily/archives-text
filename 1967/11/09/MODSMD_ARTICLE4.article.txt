# Language Study?
## Profs Defend Requirements 
### LETA ZUCKERMAN JACK KAPLAN 
Stanford's language faculty
expressed overwhelming oppo
sition in Interviews yesterday
to suggestions that General
Studies language reguirements
be reduced or eliminated en
tirely.
Friedrich Strothmann, execu
tive head of the Modern Euro
pean Language department,
stated, "The proposed changes
would be a regression to paroch
ialism." He cited the example of
the Texan who was reported to
have said, "English was good
enough for Jesus; why should
I study French?"
"Why Study Languages?'
This same question, "Why
study languages?" found a
ready answer from several
Stanford professors interviewed
by The Daily.
"Most Americans can't com
municate adequately with for
eigners because of language de
ficiency," stated John C. Lapp,
executive head of the French
and Italian department. "This
failing is a handicap in diplo
matic, business, and scientific
pursuits."
Professor Walter Sokel feared
it would even lead to a type of
isolationism. Mile. Paola Villa
made a similar assertion. "After
all," she said, "We're not alone."
Strothmann went even further.
"The U.S. is becoming hated
abroad," he asserted, "partly be
cause not enough Americans
make the effort to communicate
with foreigners."
Requirements Guide
Kurt Mueller-Vollmer, profes
sor of German, said, "There is
a conflict between the fact that
the student must choose a
meaningful curriculum and yet,
without requirements, he would
have an absence of the tools to
help him choose. Language is
one of the most important of
these tools. To eliminate the re
quirement would be like putting
a man with a blindfold in an
art gallery and asking him to
choose the best painting."
Many professors cited other
reasons for language study. For
example, most agreed that it
helps us understand other cul
tures' modes of thought while
adding to our own understand
ing of the structure of our own
language.
Translations of literary works
are a very poor substitute for
the original, they concurred.
Many scholarly works in other
disciplines are not even avail
able in translation. Further
more, overseas travel becomes
more valuable if the visitor
speaks the native language.

In addition to this necessity
for language study, Professor
William C. Calin of the French
department, feels that there
must be a balance between dis
cipline and enthusiasm. Hence
the need for a required study
of language.
Lapp proposes language train
ing for all Stanford students.
"Rather than require a certain
number of courses and units,
we should establish a universal
proficiency standard. Stroth
mann believes language and
math, which teach "indispens
able tools," should have priority
over requirements in "subjects
of content." . . . Ignoring lan
guages makes about as much
sense as never memorizing the
alphabet," he asserted.
Although all the professors
did not agree that language
training should be extended to
everyone, they all foresaw the
dangers of eliminating the re
quirement entirely. Mueller-
Vollmer fears that liberal edu
cation itself would be endan
gered. We are tending too much
toward only sciences and math,
he said. "We're heading towards
a Brave New World."
Value Later
Most of the professors agreed
the main danger would be that
many students would discover
too late their need for lan
guages. Lapp recalls several stu
dents who were forced to study
languages and only later real
ized how valuable they were.
"A whole new dimension may
open up for the student," said
Sokel. He stated, in a letter writ
ten to Herbert L. Packer on July
19, that without the require
ment the student "would prob
ably have made up his mind con
cerning his major prior to enter
ing the university. His choice
would be mainly molded by and
reflect the cultural climate and
values of his community.
"Once in the university, he
would continue the path set out
for him by the values of his com
munity, without being deflected
and disturbed in the least by the
interference of 'irrelevant' and
'impractical' subjects. Lapp
guessed that about a 30 per cent
reduction in the number of lang
uage students would result.
Cultural Contact
Professors Robert G. Cohn of
the French department and him
self a Frenchman, added that
many of the language instruc
tors are foreigners. Such an ad
justment in requirements would
tend to knock down this pro
gram which provides contact be
tween cultures. Mueller-Vollmer
indicated. in addition, that

"There are some good people on
the faculty who might leave if
this policy came through."
Visiting Professor Duschenes
said, "Having no requirement
may lead to a situation like that
of a child who just decides, for
example, that he doesn't like
beans."
In summary, Calin indicated
that the proposal was a "move
toward anti-intellectualism."
'Town Meeting' Arguments
Lapp answered some of the
statements made against lang
uage requirements during SES's
"Town Meeting" Tuesday.

For example, one argument
advanced was that courses
should become self-recommend
ing so that students would take
important courses voluntarily.
"Languages necessarily include
a certain amount of drudgery,"
he stated, "which limits the im
mediate appeal of the subject."
Another person at the Town
Meeting argued that Stanford
students have the intelligence to
rate their own priorities. Lapp
warned against equating intelli
gence with the experience and
judgment needed for self-guid
ance.
