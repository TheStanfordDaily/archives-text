# Ferry Denounces Integration As No Cure For Racial Ills
## 
### JIM PERLOFF 
The idea of integration as the
cure to America's racial prob
lems and and urban ills was de
nounced by W. H. Ferry in his
Century 21 speech last night.
"I do not see integration re
sulting from present trends and
attitudes. It can only be pro
duced by some event overturn
ing these trends and providing

historically fresh conditions,"
the vice-president of the Fund
for the Republic said.
Ferry sees three steps towards
ameliorating the condition of
what he termed America's
"blacktown."
Most Important Step
"The first of these steps would
of course be to let the idea of
integration die, by common con

sent to banish it from the lips
of whitetown reformers and pol
iticians and from the expecta
tions of blacktown, he stated.
According to Ferry, "another
step would be a minimum agree
ment against humiliation on
one side and disturbance on the
other."
The third and most important
step, in his opinion, would be

"increased political autonomy
for blacktown, accomplished by
markedly stepped up subsidies
from whitetown, which will see
blacktown's needs for supple
mentary help to be at least as
important as the needs of the
shipping industry, the corporate
farmers, and other veterans of
the subsidy trough."
"Ferry envisions "separate po
litical and social communities as
far ahead as one can see. I am
not sure, but it probably also
means that blacktown will be
come a separate political com
munity."
Ferry's speech wa sentitled
"Urbanization: A Farewell to
Integration."
The improvements being
made in blacktown are primar
ily designed to prevent riots,
according to Ferry. They are
also designed to assuage the
guilt of whitetown. And lastly,
in his opinion, they are for the
blacks who live in blacktown.
Reversed Priorities
Ferry stated that the whites
really have no intention of raz
ing the slums. "Priorities tell
the story," he said. "In the last
seven years we have spent
$384 billion on war, $27 billion
on space, and less than $3 billion
on community development and
housing."

A tacit agreement must be
reached between blacktown and
whitetown in order for our na
tion to survive, he noted. "The
requirement is for agreement
on the terms of peaceful co-ex
istence between blacktown and
whitetown. Unless we can find
them, the second Civil War is
inevitable."
Ferry continued, 'The penalty
for failure will be rising vio
lence and bloodshed, and at the
end the showdown now called
for by reckless and vindictive
men in both towns."
He called for a "creative fed
eralism' 'to prevent the violence
through the recognition of
blacktowns as a reality of life.
"We must discover a philoso
phy and machinery for the dem
ocratic government of a separ
ated country," he said.
Ferry sees blacktowns as a
necessity because the Negro
will inevitably take over Ameri
can cities, at least numerically,
predicting that "our major
cities, already black, will be
come preponderantly black in
less than a generation."
Ferry continued by citing esti
mates that by 1970 or 1975 the
14 largest cities in the U.S. will
have 60 per cent black major
ities.
