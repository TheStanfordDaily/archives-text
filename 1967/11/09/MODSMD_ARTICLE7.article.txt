# Guthrie's 'Alice' Tops Red Hot Prof Race
## 
### 
Heavy voting continued
through Wednesday's balloting
in the Red Hot Prof Contest.
Thursday, however, has tra
ditionally been times for coups
and surprise candidates to make
their bid.
At present there are 91 entries
in the running, and more than
$160 has been raised for the In
ternational Student Fund by
buying votes for and against the
candidates.
Currently in the lead with
3489 votes is "Alice" from folk
singer Arlo Guthrie's song
"Alice's Restaurant." Her cause
was aided considerably by an
anonymous $25 contribution yes
terday.
In second with 2656 ballots

stands Henry Taube, professor
of inorganic chemistry, whose
students also gave over $25.
Otis, the football game ice
cream vendor, is making a
strong bid with 2038 votes,
backed up by a $15.13 donation
from Wilbur. B. Davie Napier,
Dean of the Chapel, fell from
second place to fourth yester
day with 2011 votes.
Voting for the least popular
campus figure appears to be a
run-away victory for Mrs. Malik,
head of the Wilbur food service.
Once again activists from Wil
bur made a strong showing and
gave her -157 votes. In next to
last position is Cardinal Mcln
tyre, the Roman Catholic leader
of the Los Angeles area.
