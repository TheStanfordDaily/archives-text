The Origin of War
Remove all people from the face of the earth and we'd have peace overnight
down here. Whatever is wrong with the world has to do with people in the
world. Nations are made up of individuals. If you notice something wrong with
your neighbor, this could be a projection of your own problems on them. To
bring about peace requires a deep inner change in man's nature rather than
an outward superficial treatment of the symptoms.
In all the current agitation for an end to war no one seems interested in
knowing why men are warlike and filled with hate. Everyone sees the symptom,
very few have any preception of the disease. The Bible says war is in the
world because men live for personal pleasure rather than for God. Writing in
the New Testament, James, the brother of Jesus Christ, tells us specifically why
men kill:
"What causes wars and what causes fightings among you? Is it not your
passions (Greek: hedonon, whence "hedonist ", a lover of pleasure) that war
in your members? You desire and do not have so you kill. And you covet and
cannot obtain, so you fight and wage war. You do not have because you do
not ask (God). You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly to spend
it on your passions. Adultressesl Do you not know that friendship with the
world makes you an enemy of God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend
of the world makes himself an enemy of God." (James 4:1—4).
To live only for your own desires in the "pursuit of happiness"' is to live a
life of increasing frustration, emptiness, and guilt. To live for self is to deny
one's neighbor your own love and friendship. Frustration and hate stuffed into
the subconscious find an outlet in man's inhumanity to man. America is at
war in Viet Nam becausc her people are godless and lawless, bent on personal
gain and selfish aggrandizement. To strive for peace without reconciling men
to God is the height of reckless foolishness. Jesus said, "Peace I leave with
you; my peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you"
(John 14:27|. God's cure for war starts with individuals: you and me. Our
personal repentance and faith toward God starts His program for peace in mo
tion in our lives. Read the third chapter of the Gospel according to John in the
New Testament. Apply this to yourself, and see if God s program for peace
does not in fact change both you and the world around you.
