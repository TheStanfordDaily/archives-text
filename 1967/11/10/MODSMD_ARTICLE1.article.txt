# National Phi Psi Expels Pledges, Suspends Local
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Phi Kappa Psi national fra
ternity yesterday suspended the
Stanford chapter and ordered
house officers to de-pledge the
entire 1967 pledge class.
The house was notified of the
action by telephone yesterday
morning by National President
Ralph Haney.
National Executive Secretary
Ralph Daniels, who visited the
house yesterday, refused to give
specific reasons for the suspen
sion, saying these would be con
tained in a later communica
tion to the chapter.

The apparent reason, how
ever, was the fear that the
pledge class intended to "de
stroy the fraternity."
Some of the pledges have
since last spring openly declared
they wanted eventually to dis
affiliate the Stanford chapter.
"A lot of them said they would
join the house and then elimin
ate the fraternity," said chapter
President William B. Holt.
Convince National
"The problem now is to try
to convince a very concerned
national that they may have
changed their minds and de
cided to work within the nation
al structure," Holt added.
According to Holt, being sus
pended means "all initiation ac
tivities are suspended until the
situation can be reviewed by
house members and national
representatives."
At a house meeting last night,
Daniels was asked why the ac
tion had been taken. According
to one pledge, "He talked about
a grapevine. He said he'd heard
from a Phi Psi at an eastern
chapter that the pledges were
going to be initiated and then
destroy the fraternity."
The pledge continued, "There
are some who want this, but a
majority of the pledges don't
care. . . .
Worried About Pledges
"[Daniels] was worried about
the pledge class. He'd heard
they were going to go local. And
then he's worried about the
draw system."
Many of the pledges advocate
a draw system of rush, as op
posed to the present "single

bong" (or blackball system,
which allows a single active
member to block any prospec
tive rushee.
Earlier this week, a compro
mise was worked out in the
house, which would combine
elements of the draw and
"bong."
According to Holt, "the com
promise policy has been sent
to the national and will be con
sidered by the attorney general
and executive council of the na
tional."
Holt added, "The house as a
whole wants to stay in the na
tional. The basic problem now
is for the house to determine
a rush policy that will fit within
the national framework."
One pledge, however, pre
dicted half the pledge class
would leave the fraternity no
matter what kind of compro
mise is worked out. An active
said, "It's enough to drive one
to drugs."
At last night's meeting, Dan
iels suggested to the actives
that they think about getting
a new resident assistant. He
said he felt R.A. Allen Ruby
was perhaps fostering dissen
tion in the house and was too
much in sympathy with the
pledge class.
During the meeting Daniels
said the arrest of four Phi Psi's
at Oakland was on his mind.
One of the pledges jokingly
mentioned something about
"Commuists." Daniels quipped,
"You never know."
Earlier yesterday chapter ad
viser Charles Kendall visited
The Daily offices and looked

over articles on the Oakland
demonstrations.
Actives Knew Intentions
While admitting the actives
knew the pledges intentions last
spring, Holt said, "It was the
hope of the house that, by living
in the house and associating
with the actives, the pledges
would find that to change a fra
ternity you don't have to de
stroy it.
Pledge David Pugh said, "The
man [Daniels] was very inflex
ible all the way through [the
house meeting],
"There are two fundamental
things that it's important to re
member. He came here with all
second-hand information and
much of it misinformation. And
the national officers had not
talked to the pledges."
Holt admitted, "Daniels' in
formation was not up to date,
basically because we had not
informed him, not through any
fault of his own."
Assistant Dean Notified
Assistant Dean of Students
Dan Williams said Daniels noti
fied him informally of the
house's suspension but said it
was not clear what the terms
of suspension were.
He said Dean of Students
Joel Smith, who will meet with
national officers today, "wants
to see some kind of decision
(regarding house policies) ac
ceptable to both actives and
pledges." Then, he said, the
University will "lend its powers
of persuasion" on behalf of the
house in its dealings with the
national."
