## Peace Convocation 
### 
Tomorrow night hundreds of us will gather
front of Memorial Church for a convocation for
peace. Even more than this our coming together
will be a celebration of ourselves, our humanity,
and our lives here together.
The college years are too often void of joy,
remaining cloaked in a cloud of self-imposed
seriousness. But then our whole world too is
often void of happiness.
Dr. Joseph Katz says the college years are not
the "greatest years" of our lives. Pressures for
performance and our emerging awareness of a
world of crisis create a college environment that
is so often unhappy, depressed, and confused.
The world's problems weigh heavily upon us.
We scoff at those who coast along happily
perceiving only the superficial aspects of life.
We scoff at football crowds and fraternity parties
and so many expressions of innocent fun. We
claim we are the aware people in this University
where most of the students don't really know
what is going on.
Yet we may be losing the hold we have on life.
We may be losing our understanding of man.
We may forget how to laugh, how to relax and
enjoy one another's company. We may forget
how to celebrate being alive.
Our weeks of impotent rage and depression
and frustration must give way tomorrow night
to a desire to share an evening together. We
must demand nothing of the person next to us,
not his opposition to the war or his agreement
with our beliefs. We must demand of each per
son only his humanity.
The afternoon's football game and the eve
ning's convocation are more alike than we ima
gine. It is even possible we would learn more
about celebrating ourselves and our lives by
attending the football game rather than the con
vocation.
But the convocation gives us the opportunity
to share simply ourselves and not have to add a
spectacle before us. The convocation may be
closer to the celebration of life than any frater
nity party or pot party or row house mixer this
year.

Those present will forget for a little while the
intensity and the urgency of their dissatisfaction
with our society. We will all acknowledge the
breadth of man and the rhythm of his life. We
may be serious and fight intensely for what we
believe, but we also take time to celebrate our
lives and our common humanity with other men.
There is a time for each in the rhythm of life.
Join the service of light, wine, and bread. Join
the convocation for peace and the celebration
of life. We will all return to our work and our
causes more aware of who we are.

peace. Even more than this our coming together
will be a celebration of ourselves, our humanity,
and our lives here together.
The college years are too often void of joy,
remaining cloaked in a cloud of self-imposed
seriousness. But then our whole world too is
often void of happiness.
Dr. Joseph Katz says the college years are not
the "greatest years" of our lives. Pressures for
performance and our emerging awareness of a
world of crisis create a college environment that
is so often unhappy, depressed, and confused.
The world's problems weigh heavily upon us.
We scoff at those who coast along happily
perceiving only the superficial aspects of life.
We scoff at football crowds and fraternity parties
and so many expressions of innocent fun. We
claim we are the aware people in this University
where most of the students don't really know
what is going on.
Yet we may be losing the hold we have on life.
We may be losing our understanding of man.
We may forget how to laugh, how to relax and
enjoy one another's company. We may forget
how to celebrate being alive.
Our weeks of impotent rage and depression
and frustration must give way tomorrow night
to a desire to share an evening together. We
must demand nothing of the person next to us,
not his opposition to the war or his agreement
with our beliefs. We must demand of each per
son only his humanity.
The afternoon's football game and the eve
ning's convocation are more alike than we ima
gine. It is even possible we would learn more
about celebrating ourselves and our lives by
attending the football game rather than the con
vocation.
But the convocation gives us the opportunity
to share simply ourselves and not have to add a
spectacle before us. The convocation may be
closer to the celebration of life than any frater
nity party or pot party or row house mixer this
year.

Those present will forget for a little while the
intensity and the urgency of their dissatisfaction
with our society. We will all acknowledge the
breadth of man and the rhythm of his life. We
may be serious and fight intensely for what we
believe, but we also take time to celebrate our
lives and our common humanity with other men.
There is a time for each in the rhythm of life.
Join the service of light, wine, and bread. Join
the convocation for peace and the celebration
of life. We will all return to our work and our
causes more aware of who we are.
Tomorrow night hundreds of us will gather
front of Memorial Church for a convocation for
peace. Even more than this our coming together
will be a celebration of ourselves, our humanity,
and our lives here together.
