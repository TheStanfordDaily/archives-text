Selective Service chief General Lewis Hershey
has directed that all who physically block
military recruiting teams should be immediately
drafted.
Issued at the height of campus protests against
the military and weapons producers, the direc
tive is a blatant threat against the demonstra
tors. Reminiscent of a smiliar order over a year
ago, the directive is both impotent and improper.
It first makes us angry that General Hershey
feels he should move onto campuses to take dis
ciplinary action against such students. Any pen
alties should rightfully be levied by the univer
sities where the action took place. The unique
double jeopardy introduced can only be founded
in a paternalism and extreme paranoia.
Furthermore, one wonders whether the Selec
tive Service system is really serious about such
directives. Draft protesters who have notified
their draft boards they will not cooperate have
been reclassified 1-Y and other deferred statuses
because the system just does not want to stimu
late the controversy involved in prosecuting
those who protest.
We feel General Hershey's order is merely a
misdirected threat towards the protesters. It at
tempts to supplant the university's obligation to
maintain campus order and to discipline those
who violate it. Such a directive also ignores the
responsibility of the university to give careful
consideration to the demands of the protesters.
The university must hear the protesters case, not
prejudge it.
