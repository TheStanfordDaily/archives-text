## Promises, Promises: Lie Or Murder 
### Tim Haight 
The latest rationale of our
presence in South Vietnam
seems to go like this. "Maybe
we shouldn't have gotten in
back at the dawn of time when
we did. But we're in. Now, if
we broke our promise of help
to South Vietnam, our word
wouldn't be worth a plugged
nickel anywhere else in the
world."
Question number one: Is our
word that good? Well, that de
pends. Certainly those Voice of
America people back in the
1950's who practically assured
the Hungarian people that we
would aid a revolution were
talking through their hats. We
have no guarantee that was of
ficial U.S. policy though.
What about previously in
Vietnam? We have violated the
Geneva Accords, by supplying
arms, men (advisors) and mili

tary bases to South Vietnam
back in the '50's. But of course,
we didn't sign the accords, we
only agreed not to oppose them
with force. Sitll, some people
might say that the only reason
we didn't disrupt them by force
was that, until the war there,
nobody objected. How could
they under Diem?
The Invisible Body
Or how about this? While we
can't go back on our word about
the tariff agreements the Ken
nedy Round has brought, ninety
senators feel that a de facto
circumvention of those agree
ments, through import quotas,
is defensible.
What about the 1962 Geneva
Accords for a free and neutral
Laos? It is pretty much known
that the CIA has been flying
Air America missions against
the Pathet Lao and the North

Vietnamese supply lines ther.
Of course, that's the CIA, that
invisible body that somebody
pays for but nobody recognizes.
We also know that campaign
promises to the American peo
ple can be gone back on. Such
as ideas about not sending Am
erican boys to do a job Vietna
mese boys should do. Even so,
one might argue that a super,
archetypical, no-kidding Texas
Ranger promise might be some
thing different.
Let that argument stand and
ask another: Is it better to be a
liar or a murderer? With the
regrettable accidents of war—
civilian casualties, refugees,
corruption, vice, destruction of
crops and forest—can we say
our promise is worth more to
the Vietnamese people than our
broken word would be?
Anyway, while we're keeping
our promises to the Vietnamese

government, we have broken
promises to their people. Ac
cording to a CBS News Special
shown at midnight last Tues
day, ("Where We Stand in Viet
nam, part two") one village had
to wait six months for rice the
government and Americans had
promised. The Americans had
made their promise so vehem
ently that they forbade the vil
lagers, who had been moved
from their homes to a secure
area, to take more than one
month's supply of rice.
The Consequences
Finally, what would be the
consequences of our breaking
our promise? Would that mean
that the government of Thai
land, representing a society
where one per cent of the popu
lation owns ninety per cent of
the country, would go Commun
ist?
Would it mean that Chile or

Peru would pay a higher price
to the French for jet airplanes
we can supply? Would it mean
that India would refuse food
for its starving millions?
Would all these countries pre
fer to go to the honest Soviet
Union or the impeccable China,
whose word they can trust?
Diplomacy is a flexible busi
ness. Times change fast. Indi
vidual promises may take on
different values in new contexts.
What should not change are
our basic principles, from which
the specific promises are sup
posed to flow.
If we now believe, as many
do, that events have shown that
we were mistaken, morally as
well as practically, in getting
into Vietnam, isn't it more im
portant that we admit the mis
take and relieve our conscience
—our highest morality—even at
the expense of a promise?

the country, would go Commun
ist?
Would it mean that Chile or

Peru would pay a higher price
to the French for jet airplanes
we can supply? Would it mean
that India would refuse food
for its starving millions?
Would all these countries pre
fer to go to the honest Soviet
Union or the impeccable China,
whose word they can trust?
Diplomacy is a flexible busi
ness. Times change fast. Indi
vidual promises may take on
different values in new contexts.
What should not change are
our basic principles, from which
the specific promises are sup
posed to flow.
If we now believe, as many
do, that events have shown that
we were mistaken, morally as
well as practically, in getting
into Vietnam, isn't it more im
portant that we admit the mis
take and relieve our conscience
—our highest morality—even at
the expense of a promise?
The latest rationale of our
presence in South Vietnam
seems to go like this. "Maybe
we shouldn't have gotten in
back at the dawn of time when
we did. But we're in. Now, if
we broke our promise of help
to South Vietnam, our word
wouldn't be worth a plugged
nickel anywhere else in the
world."
Question number one: Is our
word that good? Well, that de
pends. Certainly those Voice of
America people back in the
1950's who practically assured
the Hungarian people that we
would aid a revolution were
talking through their hats. We
have no guarantee that was of
ficial U.S. policy though.
What about previously in
Vietnam? We have violated the
Geneva Accords, by supplying
arms, men (advisors) and mili

tary bases to South Vietnam
back in the '50's. But of course,
we didn't sign the accords, we
only agreed not to oppose them
with force. Sitll, some people
might say that the only reason
we didn't disrupt them by force
was that, until the war there,
nobody objected. How could
they under Diem?
The Invisible Body
Or how about this? While we
can't go back on our word about
the tariff agreements the Ken
nedy Round has brought, ninety
senators feel that a de facto
circumvention of those agree
ments, through import quotas,
is defensible.
What about the 1962 Geneva
Accords for a free and neutral
Laos? It is pretty much known
that the CIA has been flying
Air America missions against
the Pathet Lao and the North

Vietnamese supply lines ther.
Of course, that's the CIA, that
invisible body that somebody
pays for but nobody recognizes.
We also know that campaign
promises to the American peo
ple can be gone back on. Such
as ideas about not sending Am
erican boys to do a job Vietna
mese boys should do. Even so,
one might argue that a super,
archetypical, no-kidding Texas
Ranger promise might be some
thing different.
Let that argument stand and
ask another: Is it better to be a
liar or a murderer? With the
regrettable accidents of war—
civilian casualties, refugees,
corruption, vice, destruction of
crops and forest—can we say
our promise is worth more to
the Vietnamese people than our
broken word would be?
Anyway, while we're keeping
our promises to the Vietnamese

government, we have broken
promises to their people. Ac
cording to a CBS News Special
shown at midnight last Tues
day, ("Where We Stand in Viet
nam, part two") one village had
to wait six months for rice the
government and Americans had
promised. The Americans had
made their promise so vehem
ently that they forbade the vil
lagers, who had been moved
from their homes to a secure
area, to take more than one
month's supply of rice.
The Consequences
Finally, what would be the
consequences of our breaking
our promise? Would that mean
that the government of Thai
land, representing a society
where one per cent of the popu
lation owns ninety per cent of
the country, would go Commun
ist?
Would it mean that Chile or

Peru would pay a higher price
to the French for jet airplanes
we can supply? Would it mean

our promise is worth more to
the Vietnamese people than our
broken word would be?
Anyway, while we're keeping
our promises to the Vietnamese

government, we have broken
promises to their people. Ac
cording to a CBS News Special
shown at midnight last Tues
day, ("Where We Stand in Viet
nam, part two") one village had
to wait six months for rice the
government and Americans had
promised. The Americans had
made their promise so vehem
ently that they forbade the vil
lagers, who had been moved
from their homes to a secure
area, to take more than one
month's supply of rice.
The Consequences
Finally, what would be the
consequences of our breaking
our promise? Would that mean
that the government of Thai
land, representing a society
where one per cent of the popu
lation owns ninety per cent of
the country, would go Commun
ist?
Would it mean that Chile or

Peru would pay a higher price
to the French for jet airplanes
we can supply? Would it mean
that India would refuse food
for its starving millions?
Would all these countries pre
fer to go to the honest Soviet
Union or the impeccable China,
whose word they can trust?
Diplomacy is a flexible busi
ness. Times change fast. Indi
vidual promises may take on
different values in new contexts.
What should not change are
our basic principles, from which
the specific promises are sup
posed to flow.
If we now believe, as many
do, that events have shown that
we were mistaken, morally as
well as practically, in getting
into Vietnam, isn't it more im
portant that we admit the mis
take and relieve our conscience
—our highest morality—even at
the expense of a promise?
