## Try To Modify Language Requirements 
### FRANCIS X. ALLARD (Mr. Allard is an Instructor in German) 
The study of education at
Stanford, closed-minded but
well-intentioned, conducted a
public forum this past Thurs
day on education at Stanford in
general and on the language/
math requirement in particular.
Few attended; in fact more fac
ulty than student body was pres
ent.
It was obvious from the start
that the Philistines had won the
day. Requirements are restric
tions and as such impede and
frustrate any meaningful indi
vidual effort to become educated.
It was never considered that the
General Studies Requirements
might represent more than just
the invested interests of individ
ual disciplines and departments.
It was never considered that re
quirements represent the insight
of professional educators con
cerned with having a relevant
program for intellectual inquiry.
No, requirements are the worst
kind of despotism.
Requirements can and should
be periodically re-evaluated with
in the context of our changing
times, but not eliminated. Ideal
ly, students should be left to
their own devices in determining
what is most relevant and most
meaningful. How many students
would require anything of them
selves? What would you require
of yourself?
I support those who contend
that the language requirement
is a meaningless exercise. It cer
tainly doesn't provide anyone
with a high level of foreign
language proficiency. Language
learning is a life-time proposi
tion.
I would recommend a refor
mation of the requirement. Each
and every student working for
the Bachelor of Arts degree
should demonstrate a certain
level of proficiency in a modern
foreign language when he en
ters the University, and an even
higher level when he leaves.

Levels of proficiency can be de
termined objectively. Courses
in foreign language training
should be provided and recom
mended, but not required. If the
student can achieve proficiency
by means other than course
work, then let him do so.
And now the Philistines will
argue that there is still a re

strictive requirement for the
student to meet. I contend that
the requirement is by no means
a restrictive one. It is a liberat
ing one, even though one based
on Enlightened Intellectual Des
potism.
America is in danger of being
a closed society because it
knows only one language. Many
other worlds stand outside our
borders. The individual thinker
must be able to see himself and
his culture from another per
spective which stands both out
side himself and his own cul
ture. Knowledge of a second
language is a means or tool to
this end.
Stanford can and should be
a place where young men and

women can find themselves.
Stanford's responsibility, how
ever, extends far beyond the
task of helping each student to
find a meaningful reality for
self. There is the communal self
which must be integrated into
the needs of the American Com
munity at large and of the
World Community.
Proficiency in a foreign lan
guage is a much needed mean.s
to the end of integrating the in
dividual into the community. In
the study of language one must
come to grips with the impor
tance of understanding the in
dividual utterance and individ
ual utterances are what bring
and bind all men togetherâ€”or
drive them infinitely apart.
