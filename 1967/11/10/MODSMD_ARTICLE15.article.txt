# Education Down The Drain
## 
### WALTER H. SOKEL (Mr. Sokel is a Professor of German) 
I would advocate the retention
of some general requirements—
such as Western Civilization, or
some equivalent thereof, world
literature or humanities, and
language study—for the follow
ing reasons:
If there are no requirements
in those subjects, the incoming
student would in all likelihood
choose his specialty and then
pursue a departmentally pre
scribed course of studies free of
the "encumbrances" of studies
unrelated to his major.
He would probably have made
up his mind concerning his ma
jor prior to entering the univer
sity. His choice would be mainly
molded by and reflect the cul
tural climate and values of his
community. Once in the univer
sity, he would continue the path
set out for him by the values of
his community, without being
deflected and disturbed in the
least by the interference of "ir
relevant" and "impractical" sub
jects.

This would accelerate the pace
of his professional maturing and
enable him to start making mon
ey in his predetermined career
that much sooner. From the
point of view of his future live
lihood and the practical needs
of his country, especially in time
of war, this would be an ideal
procedure.
However, would such a course
of studies deserve the name of
education as distinct from intri
cate and sophisticated training?
It is my contention, based on
nearly two decades of college
level teaching, that we owe it
mainly to the fact of the exist
ence of "unpopular" require
ments (language, literature, his
tory, etc.), inherited as they are
from a very different ideal of
education, that the American col
lege student is enabled to dis
cover knowledge, ways of
thought and values that offer
him the opportunity of trans
cending his parochialism.
It is in such initially unpopu
lar courses that he frequently
receives that shock of alienation
cum discovery that may be the
most meaningful part of human
education. By encountering, of
ten for the first time, values and
ways of thought that clash with
and challenge his community
supplied assumptions, he may
experience a radical expansion
of his horizons and a fundamen
tal deepening of his sensibility.
Those factors seem to me essen
tial ingredients in education as
distinguished from training.
Having been exposed to the
alienating effect of the "unpopu
lar" requirement, the under
graduate finds himself in the
proper position to choose his ma
jor. Having been exposed to
areas of knowledge and ways of
thought whose existence he had
hardly ssupected and the signifi
cance of which he had not been
able to gauge before, he now en
joys relative freedom from con
ditioning.
The argument commonly used
to counter this view refers to
contemporary high schools, and
claims that the high schools now
do the job which general college
requirements assume to serve.
This argument seems to me fal
lacious for two reasons: a) in
my experience, the high schools
normally fail to do that job; b)
even when they attempt it, the
levels at which the subjects are
taught in high school and in col
lege, are so different that we
cannot speak of duplication.
For the above-mentioned rea
sons I am for the retention of

some general requirements in
the humanities. Given the cul
tural climate of our society, the
abolition of such requirements
would help to create or intensi
fy a "brave new worldish" paro
chialism and complacency. It
would mean a large-scale re
striction of studies to "practi
cal", socially approved, and
above all pre-professional sub
jects.
If these requirements are
abolished, how can the educa
tional needs which these require
ments serve be met? Unless
equivalents are found, we will
invite the danger of eliminating
an essential aspect and possibili
ty from education.
It is not the fact of require
ments as such, but the teaching
approach, the organization and
presentation of material, in
courses such as Western Civili
zation, languages, etc. that
should be reviewed and possibly
challenged. It might perhaps be
a good idea to make a study of
the specific objections to re
quired courses such as Western
Civ., etc., and then suggest sub
stantial changes.
It seems to me it would be a
shame to let the child — struc
tured education — go down the
drain with the bath water —in-
adequate presentation of mate
rial.

enable him to start making mon
ey in his predetermined career
that much sooner. From the
point of view of his future live
lihood and the practical needs
of his country, especially in time
of war, this would be an ideal
procedure.
However, would such a course
of studies deserve the name of
education as distinct from intri
cate and sophisticated training?
It is my contention, based on
nearly two decades of college
level teaching, that we owe it
mainly to the fact of the exist
ence of "unpopular" require
ments (language, literature, his
tory, etc.), inherited as they are
from a very different ideal of
education, that the American col
lege student is enabled to dis
cover knowledge, ways of
thought and values that offer
him the opportunity of trans
cending his parochialism.
It is in such initially unpopu
lar courses that he frequently
receives that shock of alienation
cum discovery that may be the
most meaningful part of human
education. By encountering, of
ten for the first time, values and
ways of thought that clash with
and challenge his community
supplied assumptions, he may
experience a radical expansion
of his horizons and a fundamen
tal deepening of his sensibility.
Those factors seem to me essen
tial ingredients in education as
distinguished from training.
Having been exposed to the
alienating effect of the "unpopu
lar" requirement, the under
graduate finds himself in the
proper position to choose his ma
jor. Having been exposed to
areas of knowledge and ways of
thought whose existence he had
hardly ssupected and the signifi
cance of which he had not been
able to gauge before, he now en
joys relative freedom from con
ditioning.
The argument commonly used
to counter this view refers to
contemporary high schools, and
claims that the high schools now
do the job which general college
requirements assume to serve.
This argument seems to me fal
lacious for two reasons: a) in
my experience, the high schools
normally fail to do that job; b)
even when they attempt it, the
levels at which the subjects are
taught in high school and in col
lege, are so different that we
cannot speak of duplication.
For the above-mentioned rea
sons I am for the retention of

some general requirements in
the humanities. Given the cul
tural climate of our society, the
abolition of such requirements
would help to create or intensi
fy a "brave new worldish" paro
chialism and complacency. It
would mean a large-scale re
striction of studies to "practi
cal", socially approved, and
above all pre-professional sub
jects.
If these requirements are
abolished, how can the educa
tional needs which these require
ments serve be met? Unless
equivalents are found, we will
invite the danger of eliminating
an essential aspect and possibili
ty from education.
It is not the fact of require
ments as such, but the teaching
approach, the organization and
presentation of material, in
courses such as Western Civili
zation, languages, etc. that
should be reviewed and possibly
challenged. It might perhaps be
a good idea to make a study of
the specific objections to re
quired courses such as Western
Civ., etc., and then suggest sub
stantial changes.
It seems to me it would be a
shame to let the child — struc
tured education — go down the
drain with the bath water —in-
adequate presentation of mate
rial.
I would advocate the retention
of some general requirements—
such as Western Civilization, or
some equivalent thereof, world
literature or humanities, and
language study—for the follow
ing reasons:
If there are no requirements
in those subjects, the incoming
student would in all likelihood
choose his specialty and then
pursue a departmentally pre
scribed course of studies free of
the "encumbrances" of studies
unrelated to his major.
He would probably have made
up his mind concerning his ma
jor prior to entering the univer
sity. His choice would be mainly
molded by and reflect the cul
tural climate and values of his
community. Once in the univer
sity, he would continue the path
set out for him by the values of
his community, without being
deflected and disturbed in the
least by the interference of "ir
relevant" and "impractical" sub
jects.

This would accelerate the pace

ways of thought that clash with
and challenge his community
supplied assumptions, he may
experience a radical expansion
of his horizons and a fundamen
tal deepening of his sensibility.
Those factors seem to me essen
tial ingredients in education as
distinguished from training.
Having been exposed to the
alienating effect of the "unpopu
lar" requirement, the under
graduate finds himself in the
proper position to choose his ma
jor. Having been exposed to
areas of knowledge and ways of
thought whose existence he had
hardly ssupected and the signifi
cance of which he had not been
able to gauge before, he now en
joys relative freedom from con
ditioning.
The argument commonly used
to counter this view refers to
contemporary high schools, and
claims that the high schools now
do the job which general college
requirements assume to serve.
This argument seems to me fal
lacious for two reasons: a) in
my experience, the high schools
normally fail to do that job; b)
even when they attempt it, the
levels at which the subjects are
taught in high school and in col
lege, are so different that we
cannot speak of duplication.
For the above-mentioned rea
sons I am for the retention of

some general requirements in
the humanities. Given the cul
tural climate of our society, the
abolition of such requirements
would help to create or intensi
fy a "brave new worldish" paro
chialism and complacency. It
would mean a large-scale re
striction of studies to "practi
cal", socially approved, and
above all pre-professional sub
jects.
If these requirements are
abolished, how can the educa
tional needs which these require
ments serve be met? Unless
equivalents are found, we will
invite the danger of eliminating
an essential aspect and possibili
ty from education.
It is not the fact of require
ments as such, but the teaching
approach, the organization and
presentation of material, in
courses such as Western Civili
zation, languages, etc. that
should be reviewed and possibly
challenged. It might perhaps be
a good idea to make a study of
the specific objections to re
quired courses such as Western
Civ., etc., and then suggest sub
stantial changes.
It seems to me it would be a
shame to let the child — struc
tured education — go down the
drain with the bath water —in-
adequate presentation of mate
rial.
I would advocate the retention
of some general requirements—
such as Western Civilization, or
some equivalent thereof, world
literature or humanities, and
language study—for the follow
ing reasons:
If there are no requirements
in those subjects, the incoming
student would in all likelihood
choose his specialty and then
pursue a departmentally pre
scribed course of studies free of
the "encumbrances" of studies
unrelated to his major.
He would probably have made
up his mind concerning his ma
jor prior to entering the univer
sity. His choice would be mainly
molded by and reflect the cul
tural climate and values of his
community. Once in the univer
sity, he would continue the path
set out for him by the values of
his community, without being
deflected and disturbed in the
least by the interference of "ir
relevant" and "impractical" sub
jects.

This would accelerate the pace
of his professional maturing and
enable him to start making mon
ey in his predetermined career
that much sooner. From the
point of view of his future live
lihood and the practical needs
of his country, especially in time
of war, this would be an ideal
procedure.
However, would such a course
of studies deserve the name of
education as distinct from intri
cate and sophisticated training?
It is my contention, based on
nearly two decades of college
level teaching, that we owe it
mainly to the fact of the exist
ence of "unpopular" require
ments (language, literature, his
tory, etc.), inherited as they are
from a very different ideal of
education, that the American col
lege student is enabled to dis
cover knowledge, ways of
thought and values that offer
him the opportunity of trans
cending his parochialism.
It is in such initially unpopu
lar courses that he frequently
receives that shock of alienation
cum discovery that may be the
most meaningful part of human
education. By encountering, of
ten for the first time, values and
ways of thought that clash with
and challenge his community
supplied assumptions, he may
experience a radical expansion
of his horizons and a fundamen
tal deepening of his sensibility.
Those factors seem to me essen
