# Is There Any Hope At All For The Daily?
## 
### 
Editor, the Daily:
When Kirk Hanson was elec
ted (by the Daily staff) Editor
of the Dally last spring, there
were certain people (myself in
cluded) who were pleasantly
surprised and hoped that the
Dally might be about to take on
at least a marginally rational
outlook toward the world.
After all, last year everybody
knew that under Henry Muller,
the Daily was little more than
the party propaganda platform
for the Students For a Demo
cratic Society. And since Kirk
Hanson was surely less left
than Henry Muller, there ap
peared to be good reason to be
lieve that the Daily might be
about to take the big leap into
the real world.
But, alas, with the Fall quar
ter about half over, we find that
the Daily is in fact more rigidly
controlled by the lunatic fringe
than ever.
When the Stanford Daily Mag
azine was conceived last spring,
Henry Muller promised LASSU
that this publication would not
be just another left wing rag,
but would contain articles of
general Interest to the entire
Stanford Community. And, in
deed, last spring the Stanford
Daily Magazine was about as
reasonable a publication as one
could have expected, consider
ing its source. This year, either
the Daily has forgotten last
Spring's promise, or the money
for the Magazine is coming
from some source other than
the Associated Students of Stan
ford University.
In short the Stanford Daily
Magazine has been the sort of
atrocity which Stanford stu
dents shouldn't have to put up
with. As if it weren't enough to
sing the praises of the Oakland
Peacemongers in the regular
pages of the Daily for two
weeks straight, the Daily Mag
azine has taken an entire issue
to elevate to sainthood the

worst of our generation's mis
fits.
Back in the "normal" pages
of the Daily, the greater part of
one issue was taken up by a
description of the living quar
ters of David Harris and a few
of his nonstudent comrades. For
the life of me, I cannot under
stand why it is necessary for
the Daily to herald every aspect
of David Harris's existence,
right down to the particular
brand of soap he uses. If the
Daily can't find anything more
interesting to write about, then
it ought to cut down to two or
three issues a week.
Typical of the sort of blatant
political appeal which the Daily
has been making this year is a
picture of Dean Napier and an
accompanying caption which ap
peared on the front page of last
Monday's Daily. The headline
refers to Napier as "A Man For
All Seasons," and then gives
some quotes from a typical ser
mon by anti-American leftist
Napier. Napier's main point
seems to be that the "present
practices and policies (of (Amer
ica) stink." Napier certainly
has the right to say such things
(if only because other Ameri
cans are willing to give their
lives to defend such freedoms),
but the Daily might at least
give its readers a chance to
form their own opinions on
such statements. I personally
happen to think that it is Dean
Napier himself, and not Amer
ica, who stinks.
The task of dragging the
Daily, kicking and screaming,
back into reality is a particu
larly difficult one, since the
present Daily staffers elect fu
ture Daily staffers and the re
sult is a throughly inbred group.
Perhaps the only way to
straighten out the Daily is for
LASSU to simply refuse to pass
the Daily appropriation next
spring until certain policy
changes are made. LASSU mem-

bers, why not give the idea
some thought.

(Editor's Note: This article
was submitted to The Daily to
be published as a column under
the author's byline "Scene and
Herd." Because of the nature of
the article, it was considered
more appropriate as a letter to
the editor.
I would like to clarify a few
points for Mr. Schaefer.
1) the Daily staff is open to
all students. Tryouts and train
ing programs are announced at
the beginning of each quarter.
There are no prerequisites of
political leaning, just competent
journalism. Only the editor of
The Daily is elected, not the
staff.
2) The "appropriation" Mr.
Schaefer refers to in his final
paragraph Ls a subscription fee
of $.85 per quarter per student
collected from student fees and
transferred to The Daily accord
ing to ASSU bylaws, not by ae
tion of LASSU. (Art. V, Sec. 2,
Par. B).
3) The Stanford Daily
zine is not financed by a LASSU
appropriation, as. it. was. last
spring.. Advertising, revenue
now supports the magazine.
4) We really are glad to have
Mr. Schaefer as part of our
leftist, lunatic fringe. —KOH)
• Wrong Again
Editor, The Daily:
Never in all my days of read
ing newspapers have I seen a
more inaccurate review of a
speech than the one written of
Mr. Kidan's talk. The article is
replete with major distortions
and outright untruths .
Your reviewer reported Mr.
Kidan as saying that "peace in
the Middle East would be
reached only on Israel's terms."
What utter nonsense! Mr. Kidan
said nothing of the sort. He ex
plicitly stated over and over

again that peace in the area
could only come if both sides
were willing to engage in a seri
ous "give and take".
The headline to the article,
"Israeli Peace Seen Distant By
Official," may reflect the review
er's estimation of the situation
but certainly does not accurate
ly convey Mr. Kidan's thoughts.
Mr. Kidan was more optimistic
about chances for peace after
the war, but he was not pre
pared to prophesy a time limit
within which a peace settlement
would be drawn up.
Finally, as a board member of
Hillel, I would like to say that,
contrary to your reviewer's im
pression, the audionce was not
composed mainly of Hillel mem
bers. I would also like to request
that in the future articles re
viewing talks given on campus
be signed so that readers may
bo able to identify the reporter.

• Rally Round 'P'
Editor, The Daily:
Proposition P came and went,
at Stanford it didn't even fea
ture, and voices of protest were
raised both by supporters and
opponents of the war in Viet
nam.
But the true tragedy of its de
feat, largely caused by irrelevant
semantic quibbling amongst
those who might have voted for
a different wording, has been
missed. It was one of the last
opportunities for organizing
peace platforms to the 1968 par
ty conventions.
The most important issue in
world politics today could be re
duced to this question: will
there be a peace candidate in
America's 1968 presidential elec
tion? All the indications are that
there will not: the various peace
movements have effected no
coalition, the 'dump Johnson'
campaign has not even secured
Kennedy as a candidate and,
more important, the American

middle class is not excruciating
ly anguished about the war at
all.
"Crime on the streets" seems
to have priority.
Had Proposition P passed in
San Francisco, it could have
been a rallying point for gal
vanizing public dissent by point
ing to the verdict of a whole
major city. The Stanford Young
Republicans therefore did de
mocracy a grave disservice by
scorning the proposition as 'ir
responsible', for, in their small
way, they helped to ensure that
there will not be a peace repre
sentative in 19G8.
Still this is of minor impor
tance compared with the current
election for the Stanford 'Red
Hot Prof.'

• Questions And . . .?
Editor, The Dally:
For the benefit of some future
historian, I would like to record
some of the questions that are
unanswered, and which will
probably never be answered, re
garding ill-fated Proposition P.
1) When and by whom was
the idea of putting the proposi
tion on the cheerleader ballot
first conceived?
2) When and by whom was
the disqualifying technicality
first discovered?
3) When and by whom was
the decision made to bring said
technicality out into the open?
4) Was any thought given to
calling an emergency session of
LASSU to correct the technicali
ty, or was it (for some mysteri
ous reason) too late?
5) Were any of the afore men
tioned discoveries or decisions
(or other related decisions) in
fluenced by uneasiness resulting
from this week's campaign
against the proposition?
6) Since when have important
decisions regarding the Stanford
student government been made
on the basis of technicalities?

• Misplaced Values
Editor, The Daily:
The "yell leader" campaigns
are a ridiculous idea; they were
a worse reality.
This society is coming apart.
The large minorities who have
absorbed (or worked against)

all kinds of crap aren't doing
that any more. They are fight
ing and getting killed and kill
ing. While almost everyone in
the world is living miserably,
and while a fifth of the people
in the US are deprived of their
human rights, we rich "intelli
gent" middle-class white stu
dents are spending our energy
on nonsense.
It is our choice whether we
will fool around, or lead cheers,
or smoke dope all day, or in
stead if we will get ourselves to
gether and confront the world
as it is. And try to grapple with
it.
You might convince other peo
ple in 10 or 20 years that you
couldn't have seen rebellion and
genocide coming, but you won't
be able to convince yourself.

• It's A Bird . . .
Editor, The Daily:
We here, even now builders of
the Soto Object, are flabber
gasted by the misconceptions
and general balderdash noised
abroad about the true nature of
the Henneth Anun. Should any
one take but the slightest effort
to seek out the builder's coun
cils or were even to conduct the
most trivial logical inspection of
the Object, then would they
know that it lies dormant upon
the earth only because we have
been unable thus far to conform
with the stultifying California
exhaust pollution requirements
and litiginous F.A.A. air worthi
ness regulations.
These difficulties surmounted,
the Soto Object shall become the
Flying Object it was ever des
tined to be.
