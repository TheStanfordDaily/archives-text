# Disciplinary Action Initiated Against CIA Demonstrators
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Disciplinary action against
nine students who demonstrated
last week against Central Intel
ligence Agency recruiting at
Stanford was initiated yesterday
by Dean of Students Joel Smith.
Smith has turned the case
over to the ASSU Judicial Coun
cil. In a letter to Judicial Coun
cil chairman John Raskin, Smith
requests that the case be han
dled "as expeditiously as possi
ble." Raskin had not yet re
ceived the letter yesterday, but
speculated that hearings might
begin early next week.
Smith is pressing charges be
cause the students continued to
violate the University Policy on
Campus Demonstrations after
he had informed them they were
acting illegally. They were block

ing the entrance to the west
wing of Encina Hall, the site of
the CIA recruiting.
Nine Defendants
The nine students being
charged are Jeff Browning, Jack
Gerson, Judy Goldman, Barry
Greenberg, Andrew Parnes,
Marc Sapir, Leonard Siegel,
Mark Silverman, and Guy
Smythe. These nine were the
only ones identified on the scene
by Smith.
Smith points oat in his letter
that both Greenberg and Sapir
"have been found guilty on a
previous occasion of a violation
of the University Policy on Cam
pus Demonstrations." They were
put on probation, though Sapir
said yesterday he was never told
he was on probation.
The Dean of Students office

will not press for any particular
disciplinary action, according to
Associate Dean Bill Wyman.
"The Judicial Council has com
plete freedom to choose its
method of discipline," he said.
Probable Absolution
Asked about the charges and
hearings, one of the defendants,
Greenberg, said, "I feel the Judi
cial Council will probably ab
solve us of any real guilt. They
are students too and must real
ize the administration doesn't
consider them anything more
than infantile."
Greenberg speculated that if
the Judicial Council fails to take
action, the administration will
pursue the case over their heads
to the Interim Judicial Body, an
all-faculty group.
Commenting on this possi
bility, Wyman stated, "If the
Council refused to take on the
case we will appeal it. If they
do take it on and we find their
decision unsatisfactory, we
might take it to the Interim
Body."
The defendants can call for
an open hearing at which Smith
would have to present his

charges publicly and defend
them.
The decision to initiate discip
linary action was made over the
weekend by Smith and Wyman
consultation with Richard Ly
man, vice-president and provost.
The members of the ASSU
Judicial Council this year are:
Jane Aries, Dan Bernstein, Dan
Lewis, Henry Levinson, Barbara
Packer, Melinda Ray, Rick
Stewart, Richard Such, Raskin
and Professor Lorie Tarshis of
the Economics department.
