An article in yesterday's Dally
incorrectly quoted "Professor
Robert G. Cohn" on the General
Studies language requirement.
The statement should have been
attributed to Elie Cohen, teach
ing assistant in the French de
partment.
Furthermore, the real Prof.
Cohn is in France. Neither he
nor Mr. Cohen are Frenchmen.
