# Math Department Studies Grad Education
## 
### MARY JEANNE NEWTON 
Professor Karel de Leeuw of
the Mathematics Department is
conducting an informal Study of
Education in the graduate cur
riculum in math.
Prof. De Leeuw meets with
interested graduate students in
the department and with other
faculty members each Wednes
day noon in the second floor
lounge of Math Corner. There
are usually ten to fifteen people
at the meetings which may last
<n hour or more.
"I hope to find out what's go

ing on in the department," says
de Leeuw. He has stated two
basic aims: to discover how the
department looks from the stu
dents' point of view, and to find
out how it will look twenty
years from now.
Relative Satisfaction
The present situation in the
department, he feels, is one in
which everyone is more or less
satisfied with the way things
are. Unless anyone is confronted
with something, he isn't going
to do anything." He believes that
the only way to get things done
is to have a number of people

who feel strongly enough to
present proposals to the depart
ment.
De Leeuw is not interested,
however, in formalizing the
meetings. There may sub
stantial proposals resulting from
the study but only if there is
some unanimity on the idea and
several people willing to make a
formal suggestion to the depart
ment. One inevitable positive re
sult, according to de Leeuw is
the fact that "you feel good af
ter you've complained about
something."
De Leeuw tends to hope for

greater change than most of the
graduate stutdents. "As far as I
can see, I'm the only radical
here," he says. Personally, he
would like to see an end to all
competition among students; he
wants to eliminate "every aspect
of the system that is coercive."
He believes that the graduate
curriculum can eventually be
structured so that everyone who
wants to enter the program and
is accepted will deserve a Ph.D.
He also hopes to see a lessening
of "compartmentalization" in
the field.
Although many of the gradu

ate students hold more moderate
views than de Leeuw, they are
very much interested in imple
menting specific changes.
At last Wednesday's meeting
they discussed at length the
structure of Ph.D. qualifying
exams. They also considered the
possibility of first year graduate
seminars led by advanced grad
uate students. One student
asked, "Can we propose that we
eliminate grades on the gradu
ate level?"
Other suggestions have ranged
from the installation of a candy
machine in the lounge to the
formation of an instruction pro
gram in the teaching of math,
which, as a result, will begin
tentatively today.
Reactions to the meetings
have been favorable but varied.
Little Response
De Leeuw himself feels that
the sessions have been highly
profitable. In an attempt to dis
cover the reactions of others in
the department, he posts ideas
that are broached in the discus
sions on the bulletin board. Till
now, however, he has not re
ceived much feedback from oth
er faculty members.
The students are very much
in favor of the discussions. John
Nash, a first year graduate, de
scribed the meetings as forums,
not formal committee actions. A
fourth year student, Jim Ral
ston, concurred with Nash's

view of the informality of the
group. He says it's a "nice
thing" to have.
Both students are glad to have
the opportunity to air their opin
ions. Although they don't feel
that any major proposals must
necessarily come from the meet
ings, they do see the group as a
viable means of possible change
within the department.

Math Professor Halsey Roy
den, who has attended several
meetings, expressed a different
opinion. Although he terms
them a "pleasant thing," he
doesn't believe any great
changes will result. The ideas
being discussed have been tossed
around for years, he asserts.
For Royden, the greatest bene
fit derives from maintaining
contact with graduate students.
He feels the meetings are a good
way to become acquainted with
some of the new students in the
department.
An offshoot of the graduate
sessions has been the institution
of similar meetings on the un
dergraduate level. According to
de Leeuw, the undergraduates
suggest much more radical in
novations than the graduates.
He says that while the gradu
ates are, to a certain extent,
satisfied with the present sys
tem and willing to work pretty
much within it, the undergrad
uates see all sorts of problems
in the present structure and
would like to change almost
everything.
Although there have been un
dergraduate coffee hours with
the faculty for many years, de
Leeuw claims that these sessions
have been little more than social
gatherings. However, when the
students meet specifically to
consider departmental policy,
they really open up with ideas.

graduate stutdents. "As far as I
can see, I'm the only radical
here," he says. Personally, he
would like to see an end to all
competition among students; he
wants to eliminate "every aspect
of the system that is coercive."
He believes that the graduate
curriculum can eventually be
structured so that everyone who
wants to enter the program and
is accepted will deserve a Ph.D.
He also hopes to see a lessening
of "compartmentalization" in
the field.
Although many of the gradu

ate students hold more moderate
views than de Leeuw, they are
very much interested in imple
menting specific changes.
At last Wednesday's meeting
they discussed at length the
structure of Ph.D. qualifying
exams. They also considered the
possibility of first year graduate
seminars led by advanced grad
uate students. One student
asked, "Can we propose that we
eliminate grades on the gradu
ate level?"
Other suggestions have ranged
from the installation of a candy
machine in the lounge to the
formation of an instruction pro
gram in the teaching of math,
which, as a result, will begin
tentatively today.
Reactions to the meetings
have been favorable but varied.
Little Response
De Leeuw himself feels that
the sessions have been highly
profitable. In an attempt to dis
cover the reactions of others in
the department, he posts ideas
that are broached in the discus
sions on the bulletin board. Till
now, however, he has not re
ceived much feedback from oth
er faculty members.
The students are very much
in favor of the discussions. John
Nash, a first year graduate, de
scribed the meetings as forums,
not formal committee actions. A
fourth year student, Jim Ral
ston, concurred with Nash's

view of the informality of the
group. He says it's a "nice
thing" to have.
Both students are glad to have
the opportunity to air their opin
ions. Although they don't feel
that any major proposals must
necessarily come from the meet
ings, they do see the group as a
viable means of possible change
within the department.

Math Professor Halsey Roy
den, who has attended several
meetings, expressed a different
opinion. Although he terms
them a "pleasant thing," he
doesn't believe any great
changes will result. The ideas
being discussed have been tossed
around for years, he asserts.
For Royden, the greatest bene
fit derives from maintaining
contact with graduate students.
He feels the meetings are a good
way to become acquainted with
some of the new students in the
department.
An offshoot of the graduate
sessions has been the institution
of similar meetings on the un
dergraduate level. According to
de Leeuw, the undergraduates
suggest much more radical in
novations than the graduates.
He says that while the gradu
ates are, to a certain extent,
satisfied with the present sys
tem and willing to work pretty
much within it, the undergrad
uates see all sorts of problems
in the present structure and
would like to change almost
everything.
Although there have been un
dergraduate coffee hours with
the faculty for many years, de
Leeuw claims that these sessions
have been little more than social
gatherings. However, when the
students meet specifically to
consider departmental policy,
they really open up with ideas.


PROFESSOR KAREL DE
LEEUW is running an SES
type inquiry into the Math De
partment's graduate curricu
lum.
Professor Karel de Leeuw of
the Mathematics Department is
conducting an informal Study of
Education in the graduate cur
riculum in math.
Prof. De Leeuw meets with
interested graduate students in
the department and with other
faculty members each Wednes
day noon in the second floor
lounge of Math Corner. There
are usually ten to fifteen people
at the meetings which may last
<n hour or more.
"I hope to find out what's go

ing on in the department," says
de Leeuw. He has stated two
basic aims: to discover how the
department looks from the stu
dents' point of view, and to find
out how it will look twenty
years from now.
Relative Satisfaction
The present situation in the
department, he feels, is one in
which everyone is more or less
satisfied with the way things
are. Unless anyone is confronted
with something, he isn't going
to do anything." He believes that
the only way to get things done
is to have a number of people

who feel strongly enough to
present proposals to the depart
ment.
De Leeuw is not interested,
however, in formalizing the
meetings. There may sub
stantial proposals resulting from
the study but only if there is
some unanimity on the idea and
several people willing to make a
formal suggestion to the depart
ment. One inevitable positive re
sult, according to de Leeuw is
the fact that "you feel good af
ter you've complained about
something."

in favor of the discussions. John
Nash, a first year graduate, de
scribed the meetings as forums,
not formal committee actions. A
fourth year student, Jim Ral
ston, concurred with Nash's

view of the informality of the
group. He says it's a "nice
thing" to have.
Both students are glad to have
the opportunity to air their opin
ions. Although they don't feel
that any major proposals must
necessarily come from the meet
ings, they do see the group as a
viable means of possible change
within the department.

Math Professor Halsey Roy
den, who has attended several
meetings, expressed a different
opinion. Although he terms
them a "pleasant thing," he
doesn't believe any great
changes will result. The ideas
being discussed have been tossed
around for years, he asserts.
For Royden, the greatest bene
fit derives from maintaining
contact with graduate students.
He feels the meetings are a good
way to become acquainted with
some of the new students in the
department.
An offshoot of the graduate
sessions has been the institution
of similar meetings on the un
dergraduate level. According to
de Leeuw, the undergraduates
suggest much more radical in
novations than the graduates.
He says that while the gradu
ates are, to a certain extent,
satisfied with the present sys
tem and willing to work pretty
much within it, the undergrad
uates see all sorts of problems
in the present structure and
would like to change almost
everything.
Although there have been un
dergraduate coffee hours with
the faculty for many years, de
Leeuw claims that these sessions
have been little more than social
gatherings. However, when the
students meet specifically to
consider departmental policy,
they really open up with ideas.


PROFESSOR KAREL DE
LEEUW is running an SES
type inquiry into the Math De
partment's graduate curricu
lum.
Professor Karel de Leeuw of
the Mathematics Department is
conducting an informal Study of
Education in the graduate cur
riculum in math.
Prof. De Leeuw meets with
interested graduate students in
the department and with other
faculty members each Wednes
day noon in the second floor
lounge of Math Corner. There
are usually ten to fifteen people
at the meetings which may last
<n hour or more.
"I hope to find out what's go

ing on in the department," says
de Leeuw. He has stated two
basic aims: to discover how the
department looks from the stu
dents' point of view, and to find
out how it will look twenty
years from now.
Relative Satisfaction
The present situation in the
department, he feels, is one in
which everyone is more or less
satisfied with the way things
are. Unless anyone is confronted
with something, he isn't going
to do anything." He believes that
the only way to get things done
is to have a number of people

who feel strongly enough to
present proposals to the depart
ment.
De Leeuw is not interested,
however, in formalizing the
meetings. There may sub
stantial proposals resulting from
the study but only if there is
some unanimity on the idea and
several people willing to make a
formal suggestion to the depart
ment. One inevitable positive re
sult, according to de Leeuw is
the fact that "you feel good af
ter you've complained about
something."
De Leeuw tends to hope for

greater change than most of the
graduate stutdents. "As far as I
can see, I'm the only radical
here," he says. Personally, he
would like to see an end to all
competition among students; he
wants to eliminate "every aspect
of the system that is coercive."
He believes that the graduate
curriculum can eventually be
structured so that everyone who
wants to enter the program and
is accepted will deserve a Ph.D.
He also hopes to see a lessening
of "compartmentalization" in
the field.
Although many of the gradu

ate students hold more moderate
views than de Leeuw, they are
very much interested in imple
menting specific changes.
At last Wednesday's meeting
they discussed at length the
structure of Ph.D. qualifying
exams. They also considered the
possibility of first year graduate
seminars led by advanced grad
uate students. One student
asked, "Can we propose that we
eliminate grades on the gradu
ate level?"
Other suggestions have ranged
from the installation of a candy
machine in the lounge to the
formation of an instruction pro
gram in the teaching of math,
which, as a result, will begin
tentatively today.
Reactions to the meetings
have been favorable but varied.
Little Response
De Leeuw himself feels that
the sessions have been highly
profitable. In an attempt to dis
cover the reactions of others in
the department, he posts ideas
that are broached in the discus
sions on the bulletin board. Till
now, however, he has not re
ceived much feedback from oth
er faculty members.
