# Law School Legal Aid Society Assists The Underprivileged
## 
### DAN SNELL 
In East Palo Alto and several
other cities of the peninsula the
law is slowly and quietly being
made more just.
Members of the Stanford Law
School Legal Aid Society are
working to help lawyers tackle
the legal problems of the poor in
neighborhood legal aid offices.
"What we contend with here,"
Law School tutor Roy Schmidt,
a lawyer in one of the projects
the students staff, told The Daily,
!'is middle-class laws written
With the middle-class person in
mind."
The legal aid offices defend
persons who would previously
have had to live with justice
that was prejudiced against
them because there was no one
to speak for the poor in court
and to maneuver their cases
through legal red tape.
Schmidt points out that fre
quently the poor person simply
cannot be expected to react in
the same way or even to have
the same skills as the member
Of the middle class.
Break Agreements
"For one thing," Schmidt said,
"'many of them can't read or at
least don't read the contracts
they sign." This frequently leads
to their unknowingly breaking
legal agreements.
Schmidt's office, unique in this
area, is funded by a three-year
grant from the American Asso
ciation of Law Schools. Two
lawyers work with about 14 sec
ond- and third-year law students
in an office on Willow Road in
East Palo Alto. A group of citi
zens from the community deter
mines the office's policies and
practices.
"We wouldn't be here if it
weren't for the community,"
Schmidt said, "and we don't
make any major move without
them."
100 Cases Monthly
Thelton Henderson, an Office
of Economic Opportunity lawyer
who has been with the Justice
Department, works with Schmidt
and the students. The office,
opened last January, handles
about 100 cases a month, of
which 30 or 40 per cent go to
court.
"But this figure really is mis
leading," Schmidt said, "since
most of those that go to court
are bankruptcies and divorces,
which are dispensed with in five
minutes."
The Daily asked if Schmidt
felt the services to the poor
were changing their attitudes in
regard to the law.
"No, that's too much to expect.
The poor get so badly reamed
anyway by business that there's
no reason to think they'll change
their minds about the the law
because we can sometimes save
them a couple hundred dollars
because of a poorly worded con
tract," Schmidt replied.
Must Change Laws
Legislature must change the
laws if the poor are to respect
them, according to Schmidt. He
said he was "skeptical about
test cases." The test cases le
gal aid staffs bring to court us
ually do not get recorded since
to be recorded they must be
heard in appeals court.
The East Palo Alto program
is linked with a seminar in the
Law School called "Legal Prob
lems of the Poor," taught by
Schmidt and Professor Jack
Fredenthal, who worked to
bring about the program.
Schmidt feels that teaching
of law, like the teaching of med

icine, should be more connected
with clinical work in which the
student has to deal with practi
cal problems as well as theories.
Membership Booms
The membership of the Law
School's Legal Aid Society, some
members of which work with
Schmidt's office, has increased
markedly in the last couple of
years. Now 120 of the 450 stu
dents in the School belong to
the Society.
The Legal Aid Society at Stan
ford in cooperation with other
California law schools is draft
ing a bill that would allow stu
dents to argue cases in the courts
under the supervision of a law
yer. The student would be re
quired to consult closely with
the attorney, but would be able
to plead and offer arguments
even though he is not a member
of the bar.
Multiplies Lawyers
If this measure is passed, it
would in effect multiply the num
ber of lawyers who serve the
poor. Each lawyer could advise?
law students on many more
cases than he himself could ar
gue in court.
"The passage of such a bill
would be unlikely for at least
two years," Ambler said.
Meanwhile the members of his
organization are working, with
no reimbursement, in Office of
Economic Opportunity-sponsored
legal aid offices in Redwood
City, Mountain View, Sunnyvale,
San Jose, and South San Fran
cisco. In these offices the stu
dents draft documents, do re

search, make investigations, and
do some interviewing of clients.
But there is no opportunity to
follow a case through from
start to finish as there is in the
East Palo Alto program which
is more closely linked to the
Law School.
Ambler thinks the legal ser
vices his organization provides
"tend to reduce frustration that
leads to riots among the poor."

"The legal profession has not
begun to meet the needs of
the poor," Ambler said. "To a
large extent they're just victims
of society."
Besides working in the legal
aid offices, which deal with civil
suits. Society members also of
fer their services to help court
appointed assistant defenders in
San Mateo County in criminal
cases.

other cities of the peninsula the
law is slowly and quietly being
made more just.
Members of the Stanford Law
School Legal Aid Society are
working to help lawyers tackle
the legal problems of the poor in
neighborhood legal aid offices.
"What we contend with here,"
Law School tutor Roy Schmidt,
a lawyer in one of the projects
the students staff, told The Daily,
!'is middle-class laws written
With the middle-class person in
mind."
The legal aid offices defend
persons who would previously
have had to live with justice
that was prejudiced against
them because there was no one
to speak for the poor in court
and to maneuver their cases
through legal red tape.
Schmidt points out that fre
quently the poor person simply
cannot be expected to react in
the same way or even to have
the same skills as the member
Of the middle class.
Break Agreements
"For one thing," Schmidt said,
"'many of them can't read or at
least don't read the contracts
they sign." This frequently leads
to their unknowingly breaking
legal agreements.
Schmidt's office, unique in this
area, is funded by a three-year
grant from the American Asso
ciation of Law Schools. Two
lawyers work with about 14 sec
ond- and third-year law students
in an office on Willow Road in
East Palo Alto. A group of citi
zens from the community deter
mines the office's policies and
practices.
"We wouldn't be here if it
weren't for the community,"
Schmidt said, "and we don't
make any major move without
them."
100 Cases Monthly
Thelton Henderson, an Office
of Economic Opportunity lawyer
who has been with the Justice
Department, works with Schmidt
and the students. The office,
opened last January, handles
about 100 cases a month, of
which 30 or 40 per cent go to
court.
"But this figure really is mis
leading," Schmidt said, "since
most of those that go to court
are bankruptcies and divorces,
which are dispensed with in five
minutes."
The Daily asked if Schmidt
felt the services to the poor
were changing their attitudes in
regard to the law.
"No, that's too much to expect.
The poor get so badly reamed
anyway by business that there's
no reason to think they'll change
their minds about the the law
because we can sometimes save
them a couple hundred dollars
because of a poorly worded con
tract," Schmidt replied.
Must Change Laws
Legislature must change the
laws if the poor are to respect
them, according to Schmidt. He
said he was "skeptical about
test cases." The test cases le
gal aid staffs bring to court us
ually do not get recorded since
to be recorded they must be
heard in appeals court.
The East Palo Alto program
is linked with a seminar in the
Law School called "Legal Prob
lems of the Poor," taught by
Schmidt and Professor Jack
Fredenthal, who worked to
bring about the program.
Schmidt feels that teaching
of law, like the teaching of med

icine, should be more connected
with clinical work in which the
student has to deal with practi
cal problems as well as theories.
Membership Booms
The membership of the Law
School's Legal Aid Society, some
members of which work with
Schmidt's office, has increased
markedly in the last couple of
years. Now 120 of the 450 stu
dents in the School belong to
the Society.
The Legal Aid Society at Stan
ford in cooperation with other
California law schools is draft
ing a bill that would allow stu
dents to argue cases in the courts
under the supervision of a law
yer. The student would be re
quired to consult closely with
the attorney, but would be able
to plead and offer arguments
even though he is not a member
of the bar.
Multiplies Lawyers
If this measure is passed, it
would in effect multiply the num
ber of lawyers who serve the
poor. Each lawyer could advise?
law students on many more
cases than he himself could ar
gue in court.
"The passage of such a bill
would be unlikely for at least
two years," Ambler said.
Meanwhile the members of his
organization are working, with
no reimbursement, in Office of
Economic Opportunity-sponsored
legal aid offices in Redwood
City, Mountain View, Sunnyvale,
San Jose, and South San Fran
cisco. In these offices the stu
dents draft documents, do re

search, make investigations, and
do some interviewing of clients.
But there is no opportunity to
follow a case through from
start to finish as there is in the
East Palo Alto program which
is more closely linked to the
Law School.
Ambler thinks the legal ser
vices his organization provides
"tend to reduce frustration that
leads to riots among the poor."

"The legal profession has not
begun to meet the needs of
the poor," Ambler said. "To a
large extent they're just victims
of society."
Besides working in the legal
aid offices, which deal with civil
suits. Society members also of

Members of the Stanford Law
School Legal Aid Society are
working to help lawyers tackle
the legal problems of the poor in
neighborhood legal aid offices.
"What we contend with here,"
Law School tutor Roy Schmidt,
a lawyer in one of the projects
the students staff, told The Daily,
!'is middle-class laws written
With the middle-class person in
mind."
The legal aid offices defend
persons who would previously
have had to live with justice
that was prejudiced against
them because there was no one
to speak for the poor in court
and to maneuver their cases
through legal red tape.
Schmidt points out that fre
quently the poor person simply
cannot be expected to react in
the same way or even to have
the same skills as the member
Of the middle class.
Break Agreements
"For one thing," Schmidt said,
"'many of them can't read or at
least don't read the contracts
they sign." This frequently leads
to their unknowingly breaking
legal agreements.
Schmidt's office, unique in this
area, is funded by a three-year
grant from the American Asso
ciation of Law Schools. Two
lawyers work with about 14 sec
ond- and third-year law students
in an office on Willow Road in
East Palo Alto. A group of citi
zens from the community deter
mines the office's policies and
practices.
"We wouldn't be here if it
weren't for the community,"
Schmidt said, "and we don't
make any major move without
them."
100 Cases Monthly
Thelton Henderson, an Office
of Economic Opportunity lawyer
who has been with the Justice
Department, works with Schmidt
and the students. The office,
opened last January, handles
about 100 cases a month, of
which 30 or 40 per cent go to
court.
"But this figure really is mis
leading," Schmidt said, "since
most of those that go to court
are bankruptcies and divorces,
which are dispensed with in five
minutes."
The Daily asked if Schmidt
felt the services to the poor
were changing their attitudes in
regard to the law.
"No, that's too much to expect.
The poor get so badly reamed
anyway by business that there's
no reason to think they'll change
their minds about the the law
because we can sometimes save
them a couple hundred dollars
because of a poorly worded con
tract," Schmidt replied.
Must Change Laws
Legislature must change the
laws if the poor are to respect
them, according to Schmidt. He
said he was "skeptical about
test cases." The test cases le
gal aid staffs bring to court us
ually do not get recorded since
to be recorded they must be
heard in appeals court.
The East Palo Alto program
is linked with a seminar in the
Law School called "Legal Prob
lems of the Poor," taught by
Schmidt and Professor Jack
Fredenthal, who worked to
bring about the program.
Schmidt feels that teaching
of law, like the teaching of med

icine, should be more connected
with clinical work in which the
student has to deal with practi
cal problems as well as theories.
Membership Booms
The membership of the Law
School's Legal Aid Society, some
members of which work with
Schmidt's office, has increased
markedly in the last couple of
years. Now 120 of the 450 stu
dents in the School belong to
the Society.
The Legal Aid Society at Stan
ford in cooperation with other
California law schools is draft
ing a bill that would allow stu
dents to argue cases in the courts
under the supervision of a law
yer. The student would be re
quired to consult closely with
the attorney, but would be able
to plead and offer arguments
even though he is not a member
of the bar.
Multiplies Lawyers
If this measure is passed, it
would in effect multiply the num
ber of lawyers who serve the
poor. Each lawyer could advise?
law students on many more
cases than he himself could ar
gue in court.
"The passage of such a bill
would be unlikely for at least
two years," Ambler said.
Meanwhile the members of his
organization are working, with
no reimbursement, in Office of
Economic Opportunity-sponsored
legal aid offices in Redwood
City, Mountain View, Sunnyvale,
San Jose, and South San Fran
cisco. In these offices the stu
dents draft documents, do re

search, make investigations, and
do some interviewing of clients.
But there is no opportunity to
follow a case through from
start to finish as there is in the
East Palo Alto program which
is more closely linked to the
Law School.
Ambler thinks the legal ser
vices his organization provides
"tend to reduce frustration that
leads to riots among the poor."

"The legal profession has not
begun to meet the needs of
the poor," Ambler said. "To a
large extent they're just victims
of society."
Besides working in the legal
aid offices, which deal with civil
suits. Society members also of
fer their services to help court
appointed assistant defenders in
San Mateo County in criminal
cases.
In East Palo Alto and several
other cities of the peninsula the
