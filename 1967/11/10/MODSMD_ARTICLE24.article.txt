# 'We Won't Go' Petition Gains 100 Signatures In Past Week
## 
### 
In a week's time, close to 100
Stanford students have added
their names to a continuation of
a We Won't Go petition initiated
last year by the Anti-Draft Un
ion.
The petition consists of two
separate statements. A signer
agrees in the first statement not
to fight in Vietnam or in the sec
ond not to fight and at the same
time not be conscripted into the
military.
Leonard Siegel, chairman of
the Anti-Draft Union, anticipates
a total of 1,000 signatures by
the end of this quarter.
Strengthens Commitments
Depending on the response to
the statements, Siegel said, the
Union plans either to run the
names of signers in a Daily ad
or post them on campus, hope
fully before Christmas vacation.

Siegel feels such a petition
does much to strengthen a sign
er's commitment against the
draft and the war. "Just the
fact," he said, "that someone has
put his name on paper makes
him realize his commitment
more fully, and when he sees
that some 300 people feel the
same way he does, he becomes
more sure of his beliefs."
Siegel also added that the pe
tition serves as an organizing
tool for the Anti-Draft Union it
self. Through draft counseling,
by posting bail, and by acting
as a contact for lawyers, the Un
ion helps anyone who has agreed
not to fight in Vietnam or be
drafted.
Although signers of the peti
tion are not obligated to the
Anti-Draft Union, Siegel men
tioned that many become active

members and often help the Un
ion by distributing leaflets and
getting others concerned with
the draft.
Union Collaborates
This year the Anti-Draft Un
ion is collaborating with other
schools. We Won't Go petitions
are being distributed at Foot
hill College and will be distrib
uted at San Mateo College.
So far, no one signing the pe
tition has been sentenced for re
fusing the draft. But Jim Sayre,
who is now working in the Book
store and last year signed the
second statement, was turned
away twice this summer after
traveling to Oakland for his pre
induction physical.
Perhaps the reasons for the
shrug off were the black pa
jamas and coolie hat he wore
on both occasions.

hill College and will be distrib
uted at San Mateo College.
So far, no one signing the pe
tition has been sentenced for re
fusing the draft. But Jim Sayre,
who is now working in the Book
store and last year signed the
second statement, was turned
away twice this summer after
traveling to Oakland for his pre
induction physical.
Perhaps the reasons for the
shrug off were the black pa
jamas and coolie hat he wore
on both occasions.
In a week's time, close to 100
Stanford students have added
their names to a continuation of
a We Won't Go petition initiated
last year by the Anti-Draft Un
ion.
The petition consists of two
separate statements. A signer
agrees in the first statement not
to fight in Vietnam or in the sec
ond not to fight and at the same
time not be conscripted into the
military.
Leonard Siegel, chairman of
the Anti-Draft Union, anticipates
a total of 1,000 signatures by
the end of this quarter.
Strengthens Commitments
Depending on the response to
the statements, Siegel said, the
Union plans either to run the
names of signers in a Daily ad
or post them on campus, hope
fully before Christmas vacation.

Siegel feels such a petition
does much to strengthen a sign
er's commitment against the
draft and the war. "Just the
fact," he said, "that someone has
put his name on paper makes
him realize his commitment
more fully, and when he sees
that some 300 people feel the
same way he does, he becomes
more sure of his beliefs."
Siegel also added that the pe
tition serves as an organizing
tool for the Anti-Draft Union it
self. Through draft counseling,
by posting bail, and by acting
as a contact for lawyers, the Un
ion helps anyone who has agreed
not to fight in Vietnam or be
drafted.
Although signers of the peti
tion are not obligated to the
Anti-Draft Union, Siegel men
tioned that many become active

members and often help the Un
ion by distributing leaflets and
getting others concerned with
the draft.
Union Collaborates
This year the Anti-Draft Un
ion is collaborating with other
schools. We Won't Go petitions
are being distributed at Foot
hill College and will be distrib
uted at San Mateo College.
