# Prof. Byrd Speaks On Health Ed 400
## 
### RENTON ROLPH 
The controversy over Health
Education 400, the alleged
"mickey mouse" course for ath
letes, became clearer and more
defined yesterday as further evi
dence unfolded.
The conflict concerns an in
ordinate number of undergrad
uates, particularly athletes, en
rolled in Health Ed 400, desig
nated in Courses and Degrees
as a graduate course.
Moreover, the course has been
attacked as being too easy with
an over-emphasis on quantity
rather than quality of academic
production. The contract system
of grading, whereby a student
is assured of a certain grade
for doing a prescribed amount
of work, is also at issue.
Oliver E. Byrd, the head of
the Health Education depart
ment and professor of Health
Ed 400, in an interview yester
day openly and vigorously de
fended himself and his course.
Professor Byrd admitted that he
teaches "in a manner quite dif
ferent from most men but based
his teaching philosophy on a
firm conviction that independ
ent study, properly supervised,

is the most valuable method of
instruction.
If he could, Byrd would con
duct all his classes as independ
ent study courses.
He made it clear that he can
achieve successful education in
any given case only if he suc
ceeds in sparking a personal
desire within the student. He
sees his primary responsibility
as stimulation of the student's
interest so that he will work
on his own.
Byrd also pointed out with
absolute candor that he is sym
pathetic toward the student as a
person: "the day that the book
comes ahead of the human be
ing it will be a sad day in the
life of the University."
Speaking specifically to the
point raised concerning the un
dergraduate who took his course
in absentia in Los Angeles con
trary to University policy, Byrd
said he gave this student special
dispensation "because his moth
er was ill. She died during that
quarter he was away."
Push For Abolition
The professor commented
that for years there have been
forces within the University as
well as elsewhere that have be

littled the importance of the
field of Health Education and
pushed for the abolition <>112 His
department.
Byrd, obviously convinced of
the importance of the subject,
pointed out that the reason that
he has "not chosen to practice
medicine as the licensed sur
geon that he is, has boon his
goal of preventing health prob
lems and disease rather than
curing them.
With regard to athletes en
rolled in his course, Byrd
opened his records which re
vealed that athletes comprise
only about 20 per cent of his
students, a figure not dispro
portionate to the number of ath
letes in the student body at
large. (During the Summer
Quarter of 1967 only 3 out of
19 students enrolled in Health
Ed 400 were athletes,)
Moreover, he said that if, in

fact, the independent structure
of his course is being taken ad
vantage of "no athlete will en
roll in my course again." He
strongly emphasized that no
members of the athletic depart
ment staff have ever contacted
him with regard to taking on
wnak students.
Also contacted yesterday, H.
Thomas James, dean of the ed
ucation school, described the un
usual organization of his de
partment. He said that Health
Education operates almost com
pletely autonomously within his
schooi. The relationship of
Health Education and the School
of Education has changed often
and drastically over the years,
and at one time the department
operated with complete inde
pendence, responsible only to
the President of the University.
Therefore, there has been and
is today great freedom of op

eration within the Health Edu
cation department.
Dean James also received a
note yesterday, presumably, he
thought, from Dr. Byrd, stress
ing that Health Ed 400 is not a
doctoral course, since there are
no strictly doctoral courses
within the Health Education de
partment. (No doctorate de
grees are granted by the Health
Education department.) Dr.
Harvey Hall, registrar, further
pointed out that Health Ed 400
is open to all undergraduates
and graduates.
Byrd did allow, though, that
confusion over this point is un
derstandable, due to the num
bering in the catalogue. "The
numbering may be a mistake,
but the course has always been
open to undergraduates," he
said.

for doing a prescribed amount
of work, is also at issue.
Oliver E. Byrd, the head of
the Health Education depart
ment and professor of Health
Ed 400, in an interview yester
day openly and vigorously de
fended himself and his course.
Professor Byrd admitted that he
teaches "in a manner quite dif
ferent from most men but based
his teaching philosophy on a
firm conviction that independ
ent study, properly supervised,

is the most valuable method of
instruction.
If he could, Byrd would con
duct all his classes as independ
ent study courses.
He made it clear that he can
achieve successful education in
any given case only if he suc
ceeds in sparking a personal
desire within the student. He
sees his primary responsibility
as stimulation of the student's
interest so that he will work
on his own.
Byrd also pointed out with
absolute candor that he is sym
pathetic toward the student as a
person: "the day that the book
comes ahead of the human be
ing it will be a sad day in the
life of the University."
Speaking specifically to the
point raised concerning the un
dergraduate who took his course
in absentia in Los Angeles con
trary to University policy, Byrd
said he gave this student special
dispensation "because his moth
er was ill. She died during that
quarter he was away."
Push For Abolition
The professor commented
that for years there have been
forces within the University as
well as elsewhere that have be

littled the importance of the
field of Health Education and
pushed for the abolition <>112 His
department.
Byrd, obviously convinced of
the importance of the subject,
pointed out that the reason that
he has "not chosen to practice
medicine as the licensed sur
geon that he is, has boon his
goal of preventing health prob
lems and disease rather than
curing them.
With regard to athletes en
rolled in his course, Byrd
opened his records which re
vealed that athletes comprise
only about 20 per cent of his
students, a figure not dispro
portionate to the number of ath
letes in the student body at
large. (During the Summer
Quarter of 1967 only 3 out of
19 students enrolled in Health
Ed 400 were athletes,)
Moreover, he said that if, in

fact, the independent structure
of his course is being taken ad
vantage of "no athlete will en
roll in my course again." He
strongly emphasized that no
members of the athletic depart
ment staff have ever contacted
him with regard to taking on
wnak students.
Also contacted yesterday, H.
Thomas James, dean of the ed
ucation school, described the un
usual organization of his de
partment. He said that Health
Education operates almost com
pletely autonomously within his
schooi. The relationship of
Health Education and the School
of Education has changed often
and drastically over the years,
and at one time the department
operated with complete inde
pendence, responsible only to
the President of the University.
Therefore, there has been and
is today great freedom of op

eration within the Health Edu
cation department.
Dean James also received a
note yesterday, presumably, he
thought, from Dr. Byrd, stress
ing that Health Ed 400 is not a
doctoral course, since there are
no strictly doctoral courses
within the Health Education de
partment. (No doctorate de
grees are granted by the Health
Education department.) Dr.
Harvey Hall, registrar, further
pointed out that Health Ed 400
is open to all undergraduates
and graduates.
Byrd did allow, though, that
confusion over this point is un
derstandable, due to the num
bering in the catalogue. "The
numbering may be a mistake,
but the course has always been
open to undergraduates," he
said.
The controversy over Health
Education 400, the alleged
"mickey mouse" course for ath
letes, became clearer and more
defined yesterday as further evi
dence unfolded.
The conflict concerns an in
ordinate number of undergrad
uates, particularly athletes, en
rolled in Health Ed 400, desig
nated in Courses and Degrees
as a graduate course.
Moreover, the course has been
attacked as being too easy with
an over-emphasis on quantity
rather than quality of academic
production. The contract system
of grading, whereby a student
is assured of a certain grade
for doing a prescribed amount
of work, is also at issue.

any given case only if he suc
ceeds in sparking a personal
desire within the student. He
sees his primary responsibility
as stimulation of the student's
interest so that he will work
on his own.
Byrd also pointed out with
absolute candor that he is sym
pathetic toward the student as a
person: "the day that the book
comes ahead of the human be
ing it will be a sad day in the
life of the University."
Speaking specifically to the
point raised concerning the un
dergraduate who took his course
in absentia in Los Angeles con
trary to University policy, Byrd
said he gave this student special
dispensation "because his moth
er was ill. She died during that
quarter he was away."
Push For Abolition
The professor commented
that for years there have been
forces within the University as
well as elsewhere that have be

littled the importance of the
field of Health Education and
pushed for the abolition <>112 His
department.
Byrd, obviously convinced of
the importance of the subject,
pointed out that the reason that
he has "not chosen to practice
medicine as the licensed sur
geon that he is, has boon his
goal of preventing health prob
lems and disease rather than
curing them.
With regard to athletes en
rolled in his course, Byrd
opened his records which re
vealed that athletes comprise
only about 20 per cent of his
students, a figure not dispro
portionate to the number of ath
letes in the student body at
large. (During the Summer
Quarter of 1967 only 3 out of
19 students enrolled in Health
Ed 400 were athletes,)
Moreover, he said that if, in

fact, the independent structure
of his course is being taken ad
vantage of "no athlete will en
roll in my course again." He
strongly emphasized that no
members of the athletic depart
ment staff have ever contacted
him with regard to taking on
wnak students.
Also contacted yesterday, H.
Thomas James, dean of the ed
ucation school, described the un
usual organization of his de
partment. He said that Health
Education operates almost com
pletely autonomously within his
schooi. The relationship of
Health Education and the School
of Education has changed often
and drastically over the years,
and at one time the department
operated with complete inde
pendence, responsible only to
the President of the University.
Therefore, there has been and
is today great freedom of op

eration within the Health Edu
cation department.
Dean James also received a
note yesterday, presumably, he
thought, from Dr. Byrd, stress
ing that Health Ed 400 is not a
doctoral course, since there are
no strictly doctoral courses
within the Health Education de
partment. (No doctorate de
grees are granted by the Health
Education department.) Dr.
Harvey Hall, registrar, further
pointed out that Health Ed 400
is open to all undergraduates
and graduates.
Byrd did allow, though, that
confusion over this point is un
derstandable, due to the num
bering in the catalogue. "The
numbering may be a mistake,
but the course has always been
open to undergraduates," he
said.
The controversy over Health
Education 400, the alleged
"mickey mouse" course for ath
letes, became clearer and more
defined yesterday as further evi
dence unfolded.
The conflict concerns an in
ordinate number of undergrad
uates, particularly athletes, en
rolled in Health Ed 400, desig
nated in Courses and Degrees
as a graduate course.
Moreover, the course has been
attacked as being too easy with
an over-emphasis on quantity
rather than quality of academic
production. The contract system
of grading, whereby a student
is assured of a certain grade
for doing a prescribed amount
of work, is also at issue.
Oliver E. Byrd, the head of
the Health Education depart
ment and professor of Health
Ed 400, in an interview yester
day openly and vigorously de
fended himself and his course.
Professor Byrd admitted that he
teaches "in a manner quite dif
ferent from most men but based
his teaching philosophy on a
firm conviction that independ
ent study, properly supervised,

is the most valuable method of
instruction.
If he could, Byrd would con
duct all his classes as independ
ent study courses.
He made it clear that he can
achieve successful education in
any given case only if he suc
ceeds in sparking a personal
desire within the student. He
sees his primary responsibility
as stimulation of the student's
interest so that he will work
on his own.
