# White House Asked Before Draft Edict

### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—Draft
chief Lewis B. Hershey says the
White House knew in advance of
his order that local draft boards
revoke deferments of college
students who won't carry their
draft cards or who interfere
with campus military recruiting.
"The answer is easily 'yes,' "
Lt. Gen. Hershey told newsmen
Wednesday when asked if he
had conferred with the White
House before issuing the order.
"It's hard not to confer with
the White House," the Selective
Service director added. Hershey
is directly responsible to Presi
dent Johnson and reports direct
ly rather than through interme
diaries.
Hershey said the Oct. 26 or
der, issued five days after a
mass protest at the Pentagon,
wouldn't apply to students
peacefully protesting the draft
or the Vietnam war but only to
those who violate a law enacted
earlier this year.
The law, spurred in Congress
by demonstrations where draft
cards were burned, provides
maximum penalties of a five
year prison term and $10,000
fine for persons who illegally
interfere with the draft law or
regulations issued under it.
Hershey said regulations al
low deferred registrants with
out their draft cards to be re
classified as available for ser
vice, with their names advanced
to the top of the draft call list.
He ordered draft boards to
heed the regulations, saying
"those who violate the act
should be denied deferment in
the national interest."

BULLETIN
WASHINGTON (AP) — Top
Justice Department officials are
reviewing an executive order
proposed by the Selective Ser
vice System to facilitate draft
ing protesters who violate the
draft law.
The officials are said to
strongly oppose the order — ac
tually a change in draft regula
tions—because they feel it would
substitute draft boards for
courts.
Sources say the Selective Ser
vice feels the Justice Depart
ment has not vigorously prose
cuted those accused of violating
the draft law and, because of
court delays, some offenders
avoid induction into the armed
forces.
Specifically, the order would
change the definition of a draft
delinquent.
Present regulations define a
delinquent as one who fails for
example, to carry the required
Selective Service registration
and classification cards.
The proposed order would de
clare as delinquent anyone who
violates the Selective Service
Act—burns a draft card or im
pedes the administration of the
draft by physically protesting at
a draft board.
If an individual is declared de
linquent, he is listed first for in
duction unless he can persuade
his local draft board to recon
sider his case.
One problem would be how to
handle fairly all violators of Se
lective Service Act provisions.
