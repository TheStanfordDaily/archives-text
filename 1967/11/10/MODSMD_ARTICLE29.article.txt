# An Answer To Taubman

### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
c'hilip Taubman's treatment of the Health Education directed
i aiing controversy demonstrated irresponsible and sometimes
\ riolio journalism both in his supposedly objective news story
a I in his editorial comment.
lis news story war, conspicuous in the statistics he did not in
c ide. In ihe summer of 1960, 3 out of 13 students were varsity
a 'detes. Twenty five students took it last spring. For last summer,
Y mentions one athlete out of the 16 students registered.
What about the others? Why did they take the course? Was it
j ;t an easy GPA booster? Who recommended it to them?
About 15 percent of the undergraduate student body participates
i organized sports at Stanford. The number of athletes enrolled
i; lIE 400 is certainly not disproportionate.
because several athletes have taken the course, I see no justifi
c don for levelling indignant attack solely at Stanford athletes,
ti.e Stanford Athletic Department, or at athletics in general.
Mr. Taubman chose the swimming team for one of his editorial
c amples. Just to set the record straight, last winter quarter, while
the swimmers trained for the NCAA championship, the team
c : ned an overall GPA well over 3.0.
Fully half the swimming team is pre mod. Mickey mouse courses
ii Health Ed? Try comparative anatomy, neurophysiology, or or
g nie chemistry.
Vlr. Taubman assumed in his article that enrollment in HE 400
r cessarily constitutes an affront to the ethereal "educational
e perience." This may or may not be true. But until this point is
e rablished by something more than conjecture and personal inter
p station, there is no justification for righteously denouncing the
c urse as "mickey mouse" or a palliative to academic disqualifica
tion.
vTv personal feeling is that a quarter full of directed reading in
h ilrh education could very easily dilute the educational benefits
t.it could potentially be derived from other courses. This depends
i- on the individual, entirely. Athletes, like all individuals, may
h w faults.
Jirected reading, as a lazy man's alternative to perhaps more
n -aningful work, should be deplored. Directed reading as a mean
ii jful learning experience is not, however, inconceivable.
Directed reading for an easy grade, i.e. to keep a scholarship or
sly above the magic minus 17, may or may not be justified. Some
ti nes, because of severe personal problems, a student may fall into
a academic hole. If he can get a good grade to pull himself back
l , he may be better prepared psychologically for the demands
a ead. If the course is not an excuse for laziness, the grade may
1 a therapeutically justified one.
• IE 400 is open to any student who wants to sign up.
Dispute the enrollment policy if you will, Mr. Taubman, but don't
b ime all the injustices, real or fancied, on the Athletic Depart
n cnt.
Mr. Taubman faults the Athletic Department administration for
0 "?asionally recommending directed reading to athletes in academic
t >üble. That is a judgment which an editorial is entitled to make.
'3ut what about the other 80 percent enrolled in the course?
F ould the history department be attacked because four history
s 'dents took the course one quarter?
.early 95 percent of Stanford athletes graduate in four years,
1 above the overall student average. One cannot fulfill his major
r |uirements at Stanford by glutting his grade point on directed
riding.
think more objective reporting and responsible editorial writ
i. j would have helped Stanford understand the real situation.
