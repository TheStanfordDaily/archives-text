# Peace Convocation Set For Tomorrow
## 
### TOM DAWSON 
The Convocation for Peace
Committee will begin its multi
titled peace vigil Saturday
at 9 p.m. outside Memorial
Church, aiming for Sunday
morning at 6 a.m. More tnan
500 people are expressing their
support of the convocation by
wearing white armbands.
Organizers of the meeting em
phasize that it "is not conceived
as a protest utilizing and pre
scribing some dissenting tactic.
It is a context for members of
the Stanford-Palo Alto commu
nities with individual commit
ments and concerns to share
and discuss their feelingsâ€”not
to do battle over them."
Activities Planned
Among the activities planned
for the night-long affirmation
are two worship services, talks
by members of the Stanford
community, films on Vietnam,
piano music by Dean Napier,
and group singing. Slated speak
ers include Professor Charles
Drekmier of the Political Sci
ence Department, Dennis Swee
ney, and former members of
the Volunteers In Asia program.
The scheduled films are "Time
of the Locusts" and "Mekong
Valley Delta." The latter is a
documentary produced by the
Shell Oil Company. Slides of
North Vietnam taken by Felix
Greene will also be screened.
Some films will be both shown
before and after midnight.
Organizers of the Convocation
have urged all interested to at
tend even if they can only stay
for a short time.
Ecumenical Worship
At midnight there will be a
Service of Worship, led by Dean
Napier, Catholic campus minis
ter Father John Duryea, Episco
pal chaplain the Rev. Lane Bar
ton and other campus ministers.
The Service, in Memorial
Church, will be immediately pre
ceded by folk singing. The Mem
orial Choir and the Mendicants
will sing with and for the Con
vocation. The Service will fea
ture the distribution of light and
bread and wine, "symbols of our
need, our brokenness and our
common humanity," according
to Dean Napier.
Dean Napier announced that
the Service will employ "tradi
tional cultic language from the
Bible, from the Haggadah, and
the Prayer Book; but the Jews
and Christians and humanists,
believers and unbelievers, will
bring to the celebration their
own particular private language
of commitment to peace."
After the Midnight Service,
discussion groups will form to

talk over the participants' feel
ings on peace. There will also be
folk singing; all interested are
urged to bring guitars. Selec
tions will not be limited to pro
test songs. The organizers urge
all participants to suggest pos
sible songs.
Harris To Speak
Among the speakers in the
post-midnight session will be
David Harris, ex-student body
president and Resistance leader.
At 5:30 Sunday morning the
participants will leave the Mem
orial Church area and proceed
to the lawn in front of the Quad
(on Palm Drive). At 6 a.m. the
Sunrise Service will take place.
The gathering will be very in
formal, with folk songs, read
ings, and silence.
The organizers stated that the
mood of the Service "will move
from praise and adoration to
confession and judgment and
finally to the affirmation of
hope."
Sunrise Breakfast
The Convocation will end with
the Sunrise Service though
orange juice and doughnuts will
be available afterwards.
Officials of the Convocation
emphasize that the gathering is
meant as a sign of desire for
peace, not as a protest against
specific policies.
