## 
### BOB BUND 
Stanford cross country run
ners, fresh from last week's race
in the crystal clear air of Lake
Tahoe, will face their toughest
test of the year in smogbound
Los Angeles this Saturday.
The triangular meet with USC
and UCLA begins at 10:00 a.m.
on the hilly Griffith Park course.
USC is undefeated and ranks
as one of the top teams in the
nation. The Trojans placed five
men in front of San Jose State's
second man to score a smashing
28 to 68 victory in the Long
Beach Invitational. This was the
Spartan's only defeat of the
year.

The Bruins are improved and
should be stronger than they
were three weeks ago in their
26 to 30 loss to the Indians.
Greg Brock, winner of last
week's South Tahoe Invitational
meet, will face some of the na
tion's top collegiate distance
runners, in the race for individ
ual honors.
The Trojan's Neil Duggan and
John Link are two of the top
milers in the conference.
Duggan, an Englishman, ran
a 3:56 mile as a freshman at
Hancock Junior College, and
swept the National Junior Col
lege half mile, mile, and two
mile championships. Link, USC
number one harrier, is a 4:02
miler.

Rick Romero and George Hus
aruk of UCLA are also among
the best distance runners on the
coast. Romero, who defeated
Brock in the Stanford vs. UCLA
dual meet, is a 4:02 miler. Husa
ruk is one of the fastest two
milers in the nation.
Coach Jerry Barland cites con
sistency as the key to the In
dians chances.
He feels the Tribe can defeat
the Bruins with a "good team
effort," but that it will take an
"all out effort" to upset the Tro
jans. Stanford harriers Brook
Thomas, Jim Letterer, Allen
Sanford, Dave Redwine, Chuck
Menz, and Greg Brock are ready
to go all out.

John Link are two of the top
milers in the conference.
Duggan, an Englishman, ran
a 3:56 mile as a freshman at
Hancock Junior College, and
swept the National Junior Col
lege half mile, mile, and two
mile championships. Link, USC
number one harrier, is a 4:02
miler.

Rick Romero and George Hus
aruk of UCLA are also among
the best distance runners on the
coast. Romero, who defeated
Brock in the Stanford vs. UCLA
dual meet, is a 4:02 miler. Husa
ruk is one of the fastest two
milers in the nation.
Coach Jerry Barland cites con
sistency as the key to the In
dians chances.
He feels the Tribe can defeat
the Bruins with a "good team
effort," but that it will take an
"all out effort" to upset the Tro
jans. Stanford harriers Brook
Thomas, Jim Letterer, Allen
Sanford, Dave Redwine, Chuck
Menz, and Greg Brock are ready
to go all out.
