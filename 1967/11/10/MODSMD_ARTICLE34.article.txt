# Tribe Task: End Duck Momentummm
## 
### NICK SELBY 
It's a matter of simple addi
tion—win plus win equals mo
mentum.
That football formula will be
put to the test this Saturday
when the Stanford varsity meets
the University of Oregon in the
Stanford Stadium at 1:30 p.m.
in a contest termed by Bay Area
sportswriters as the "Battle of
Momentums."
Oregon has won two of its
last three games after losing the
first five games. Stanford came
of age in the UCLA game, and
although it lost that and the

Army contest, it defeated Wash
ington 14-7 last weekend in Seat
tle for a major upset.
Duck Offensive Force
Supplying the offensive force
for the Ducks in their resur
gence are quarterback Eric Ol
son, halfback Claxton Welch,
and fullback Jim Evenson.
Olson has apparently received
the starting nod from Oregon
coach Jerry Frei, the only new
coach in the PAC-8 this year.
Olson's forte is his passing abil
ity.
Against Washington State last
week, Olson guided the Ducks to

a 17-13 victory, completing 8 of
21 for 130 yards and one TD.
Olson, the seventh best passer in
the conference, also ran for 43
yards in 10 carries.
Claxton At His Best
Halfback Welch had his best
day in an Oregon uniform last
week against the Cougars in
Pullman. Welch rushed for 138
yards in 30 carries, picking holes
and breaking tackles with con
sistent craftiness.
Welch has 392 yards on the
season for a 3.88 yards per carry
average.
Fullback Evenson has netted
251 yards so far, for a 3.02 aver
age.
Scoring has not been the
Ducks' strong point this year,
however. Excluding a 31 point
binge in a win over Idaho, the
Oregon offense has averaged
only seven points a game.
Defense Proud
Defense is Oregon's boasting
ground. However, only two
teams in eight games have failed
to score less than 21 points.
Heading up Oregon's defense
is halfback Jim Smith. Smith's
regular duty is to guard the op
position's best receiver, and he
has played up to the task.
Man-To-Man Battles
He limited USC's Earl Mc-
Coullouch to one reception in
the Ducks' 28-6 loss, and stopped
WSU flanker Doug Flansberg
with one catch. Smith has no in
terceptions on the year, but his
partner on the wing, halfback
Jack Gleason, has come up with
three.
Smith will cover Indian flank
er Gene Washington in the game
Saturday. Washington is the
conference's second leading re
ceiver with 37 grabs, and the
two should have a real show
down.
Dames —A Problem
The pride of the Duck defense
is middle guard George Dames,

who has already been named
Lineman of the Game four
times this season. Dames' stunts
and aggressive line play have
enabled him to make 115 tackles
this season, and will definitely
provide blocking problems for
the Indian offensive line.
Change With Marquess?
Stanford's offensive force gets
a test this weekend when Mark
Marquess takes over for the in
jured Chuck Williams at the
quarterback spot. Coach John
Ralston has repeatedly stated
that Marquess' presence in the
Tribe backfield will have no ef
fect on Indian strategy.
There is no question about
Marquess' ability to handle roll
out plays, but many observers
have questioned his passing au
thority. Ralston is confident,
Marquess can do the job.
Plunkett Can Play
If Marquess Is suddenly in

capacitated by an injury, the In
dians will have sophomore Jim
Plunkett, whom many practice
observers feel is the best passer
on the Indian squad.
However, Ralston has kept
Plunkett out of play so far this
season in an attempt to preserve
his red shirt status.
The rest of the Indian offen
sive force will come from half
back Nate Kirtman and tri-cap
tain fullback Jack Root.
On the offensive line, there
are no changes from last week.
Tom Giallonardo will start at
center this game, but senior tri
captain Don Swartz will get the
nod for Big Game next week.
Hazelrigg For The Defense
If anything can stop the potent
Oregon offensive momentum, it
has to be the powerful Tribe
defense. Last week, led by senior
Tom Hazelrigg and junior Andy

Carrigan, it limited a strong
Washington team to seven
points.
Both Hazelrigg and Carrigan
performed brilliantly in their
home state, accounting for over
40 tackles between them. All-
America candidate Blaine Nye
at tackle and Don Parish also
were impressive.
Senior Dave Nelson is about
to crack back into action at the
safety spot. He has missed all
games since the first when he
broke his collarbone. He will
back up Tom Massey Saturday.
The Indians are picked as
heavy favorites for the game on
the basis of their win last week
and their 4-4 record on the year.
Oregon is hoping that its mo
mentum can fool both the ex
perts and the Tribe.

WHY? Stanford quarterback Chuck Williams sits dejectedly on the
bench after being injured on the next-to-the-last play at Washington.
The Pac-8 "Back of the Week" will also be out of action against Or
egon this Saturday.

HI THERE! Jim Smith, Oregon's super-quick defensive halfback,
will be covering Gene Washington man for man this Saturday, in
what should be one of the best personal duels of the season. Smith
has allowed a measly two receptions against him in the last two
games, and limited USC's highly-touted Earl "The Pearl" McCul
louch to just one.
