# Ex-Student Speaks On Viet Meeting
## 
### PENNY HILL 
Speaking in Tresidder Wed
nesday evening, Dennis Sweeney
gave his impressions of the Sep
tember conference between
Americans and members of the
Vietnamese National Liberation
Front (NLF.)
Sweeney, a former Stanford
student, is now wording with
the Palo Alto Resistance.
Sweeney was one of 40 Ameri
cans chosen to attend the con
ference in Bratislavoa, Czechslo
vakia. The American organizers
were Nick Egelson of Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS),
Tom Hayden of the Newark
Community Action Council and
former SDS President, and Dave
Dillinger, editor of Liberation
Magazine. The delegates were
chosen, Sweeney said, "on the
basis of those three person's
knowledge of people who were
active." There were no specific
organizations chosen, but rather
individuals who would actively

spread the information about the
conference.
Sweeney indicated that the
NLF sent the "highest level"
committee in several years. He
said he did not feel that the NLF
was "trying to put something
over on us" because the Ameri
can delegates, including journal
ists, professors, community or
ganizers and other activists, had
an extensive knowledge of the
subject and would have detected
such attempts.
Each of the 40 Americans in
dividually financed his trip to
the 8-day conference. The NLF
sent 30 delegates, about 20 from
North Vietnam and 10 from
South Vietnam. Some of the
NLF delegates had to travel al
most a month to get to Brati
slavia, according to Sweeney.
U.S. Not Effective
From the NLF's reports, the
United States' effectiveness in
Vietnam has been to dislocate
people, Sweeney reported. He

said the NLF believes that it
can defeat the United States on
the ground and then supported
this by indicating there is little
civilian support for the U.S.
troops and that most of the U.S.
ground activity is confined to
protecting its own bases.
That the bombing has much
effect in the war the NLF dele
gates denied by saying that 95
per cent of North Vietnam's
economy is from agriculture and
its few industries have been
scattered. Bridges are disassemb
led and transportation and ship
ping continue.
Presently the NLF is work
ing in South Vietnam to get
more support in the government
and in the army. Four or five
sectors of Saigon itself are un
der NLF control and troops now
do not enter these "liberated"
sectors.
Want To Exchange Information
The NLF is interested in
American peace and radical
movements. They are willing to
exchange information, leaflets
and newspapers and are eager
to start other forms of commu
nication for their people to gain
a greater respect for Americans.
They are also anxious to bring
more Americans to North Viet
nam to see "what the American
Air Force looks like at the other
end," says Sweeney.
The Vietnamese were baffled
by the effect the war has on the

majority of people in this coun
try. "They couldn't comprehend
the fact that the war doesn't
touch their lives here," Sweeney
said.
The Vietnamese were also sur
prised to hear that some of the
techniques of the peace groups
have changed, indicating that
they had learned from the
Americans /and were using some
of these techniques now.
Understand Time Perspective
Understanding the "time per
spective" of movements Sween
ey considers important. He told
of a conversation with one of
the NLF journalists who spoke
of 40 years of development to
make the NLF what it is today.
Le Tan, the journalist, said that
40 years ago under the French
domination many Vietnamese
felt despair which is similar to
current American feelings.
"Many Vietnamese students and
intellectuals committed suicide
and there were few people who
had any hope at all," Sweeney
said. Although many were im
prisoned or killed, the Vietna
mese continued resistance inspir
ed by the sacrifices.
Time is needed for growth,
Sweeney indicated. "It is hard
for me to understand people who
want to create new organiza
tions," he said. "In many ways,"
he continued, "the movement
has grown beyond us in the last
few months." He pointed out

that some individuals think it
has progressed 20 years in two
months.
He concluded by saying that
what is now needed is a "time of
consolidation" to promote a bet
ter understanding of the move
ment. Whether or not all the
information brought out in the
conference is absolute fact is still
a question he asks. But he feels
that "If what they say is true,
it has to be communicated to the
American people."
Resistance Sponsors Meetings
To help spread this knowledge
and information, the Stanford
Resistance, headed by Mark Sil
verman, sponsored a series of
discussions during the week in
Tresidder and mens' and wom
en's dorms.
Members of Stanford and Palo
Alto Resistance outlined past
activities and future plans. Pres
ently the major concern of the
non-cooperation group is to get
support for the Dec. 4 demon
stration when more American
men will return their draft cards
to the government.
For the first time women are
taking an active part in the Re
sistance. Monday evening in
Tresidder 12 women signed a
complicity statement admitting
"aiding and abeitin|" the men
who have turned in their cards.
Wednesday evening in Cardinal
house of Florence Moore, the
first dorm discussion was held to
further explain the woman's role
in the Resistance.
