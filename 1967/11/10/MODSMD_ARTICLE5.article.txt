# Stanford Cost Crisis
## $4 Million Deficit By '70 
### KIRK HANSON 
Despite a growing "cost crisis"
in higher education, Stanford's
financial statement for the past
academic year shows Stanford
to be still operating in the
black.
However, Kenneth M. Cuth
bertson, vice-president for fi
nance, warns that Stanford is
incurring a higher and higher
"educational deficit" in critically
important academic improve
ments which have been cancelled
or deferred.
The 1967 financial report, re
leased today, indicates total Uni
versity expenditures of $130 mil
lion dollars in the fiscal year
ending August 31. Total income
for the year narrowly exceeded
the total operating expenditures
and has given the University an
unrestricted and uncommitted
balance of less than $3 million
to carry into the new fiscal year.
Cuthbertson noted drama fa

cilities, library improvements,
and increases in student aid as
three prime areas of the educa
tional deficit.
Almost every one of the 1400
private colleges and universities
in the country faces a financial
crisis without historical prece
dent. Experts claim private in
stittuions of higher learning
cannot continue to operate with
out becoming exclusive academ
ies for the elite or inferior insti
tutions with huge educational
deficits. Many institutions of
higher learning are already en
tering the era of deficit finan
cing.
Ten years ago Stanford fore
saw a gap between minimum ex
penditures and predictable in
come of $2 million by 1962. Part
ly through incurring an educa
tional deficit and partly through
unexpected increases in income
Stanford has continued to oper
ate in the black. However, this
September, Vice President Cuth

bertson predicted a deficit of $4
million by 1972 and $9 million
by 1977.
Find New Sources
Stanford must find large
sources of new revenue or it
will be forced to curtail many
more educational programs and
innovations during the coming
years. Due to an uncertainty
concerning federal funds avail
able this year for research, Pro
vost Richard Lyman Tuesday di
rected programs dependent on
federal grants to limit the hir
ing of new faculty and the de
velopment of new programs.
Jordan Hall and the west wing
of Encina Hall remain empty
awaiting funds for rennovation.
Several universities have
faced crises of such proportions
that they have already become
public institutions. The Univer
sities of Houston, Buffalo, Pitts
burgh, Kansas City University,
and Temple University have all

become public during the past
five years.
Rising educational costs have
created the financial crisis for
private universities. In a letter
accompanying Stanford's finan
cial report, Cuthbertson writes:
"The highest quality of learning
and education will without
doubt continue to increase in
cost — and at a rapid rate." The
increases are primarily in fac
ulty salaries, the maintenance
of larger facilities, and the ne
cessity for private institutions
to offer higher quality. Some
consider the greatest value of
an independent institution to be
its ability to pursue and inde
pendent mission, and not simply
render services directed by the
state legislature.
McGeorge Bundy, president of
the Ford Foundation, has recent
ly criticized the universities for
not clearly stating the facts and
figures of the financial crisis. He
also chided the universities for
what he called timid and inex
pert investment of their endow
ments. The Ford Foundation has
recently announced it cannot
hope to provide the extensive
funds it has provided in the past
for higher education.
Stanford was the recipient of
one of the largest grants Ford
has made to any university. A
Ford gift of $25 million was
matched by over $75 million in
Stanford's PACE program. The
money was solicited between
1961 and 1964.
Stanford's success in avoiding
deficit financing is attributed pri
marily to the accurate cost pre
dictions it has made during the
past ten years. Only recently
have other universities adopted
many of the techniques long
used by Stanford. Two years ago
the Trustees considered the fi
nancial outlook and planned a
slower overall growth rate,
thereby introducing many edu
cational deficits.
War Impact
The cost crisis is complicated
today by several factors. The
first is the impact of the war on
both federal grants and private
philanthropy. In budgeting for
the next fiscal year, Cuthbertson
admits "we have to assume
there is going to be a downturn
if there is no change in other
federal expenditures, principally
for the Vietnam war. We have
to figure we will get hit pretty
hard in a rollback on research
grants."
However, Cuthbertson claims,
that Stanford's total income
from federal grants will not fall
during the coming year. This in
come figure has risen more than
20 percent per year to last
year's $53 million. Cuthbertson
sees a flattening out of the in

come from federal grants, but
not an immediate drop.
What avenues exist for Stan
ford to increase its total income,
thereby relieving the education
al deficit? Tuition is the first
possibility, and Cuthbertson pre
dicted that the direct cost of a
Stanford education will rise sig
nificantly in the next few years.
He estimated an 8 percent rise
per year which would carry tui
tion to $1920 in 1968, $2075 in
1969, and $2240 in 1970. He em
phasized these figures would be
reevaluated yearly. However, he
foresees little possible increase
beyond that.
Inadequate Endowment
Stanford's endowment cannot
absorb the crisis. It is $240 mil
lion while Harvard's is about $1
billion and Yale's runs well over
$500 million. Stanford receives
only 18 percent of its operating
revenue from endowment while
most other major universities
have upped the figure to about
30 percent. At the same time,
Stanford relies on gifts for 30
percent of its operating revenue
while other instittuions need
only about 20 percent.
The instability of gifts has ne
cessitated much more careful
projection of future financial sta
tus. A low endowment means
Stanford cannot support deficit
financing for long.
Stanford has succeeded in im
proving its educational pro
grams significantly in the past
twenty years, without incurring
a financial deficit. However, it is
now faced with the threat of an
educational deficit that will
make it not a bankrupt, but an
inferior university.

posed to finance higher educa
tion at Stanford and other pri

Ford gift of $25 million was
matched by over $75 million in
Stanford's PACE program. The
money was solicited between
1961 and 1964.
Stanford's success in avoiding
deficit financing is attributed pri
marily to the accurate cost pre
dictions it has made during the
past ten years. Only recently
have other universities adopted
many of the techniques long
used by Stanford. Two years ago
the Trustees considered the fi
nancial outlook and planned a
slower overall growth rate,
thereby introducing many edu
cational deficits.
War Impact
The cost crisis is complicated
today by several factors. The
first is the impact of the war on
both federal grants and private
philanthropy. In budgeting for
the next fiscal year, Cuthbertson
admits "we have to assume
there is going to be a downturn
if there is no change in other
federal expenditures, principally
for the Vietnam war. We have
to figure we will get hit pretty
hard in a rollback on research
grants."
However, Cuthbertson claims,
that Stanford's total income
from federal grants will not fall
during the coming year. This in
come figure has risen more than
20 percent per year to last
year's $53 million. Cuthbertson
sees a flattening out of the in

come from federal grants, but
not an immediate drop.
What avenues exist for Stan
ford to increase its total income,
thereby relieving the education
al deficit? Tuition is the first
possibility, and Cuthbertson pre
dicted that the direct cost of a
Stanford education will rise sig
nificantly in the next few years.
He estimated an 8 percent rise
per year which would carry tui
tion to $1920 in 1968, $2075 in
1969, and $2240 in 1970. He em
phasized these figures would be
reevaluated yearly. However, he
foresees little possible increase
beyond that.
Inadequate Endowment
Stanford's endowment cannot
absorb the crisis. It is $240 mil
lion while Harvard's is about $1
billion and Yale's runs well over
$500 million. Stanford receives
only 18 percent of its operating
revenue from endowment while
most other major universities
have upped the figure to about
30 percent. At the same time,
Stanford relies on gifts for 30
percent of its operating revenue
while other instittuions need
only about 20 percent.
The instability of gifts has ne
cessitated much more careful
projection of future financial sta
tus. A low endowment means
Stanford cannot support deficit
financing for long.
Stanford has succeeded in im
proving its educational pro
grams significantly in the past
twenty years, without incurring
a financial deficit. However, it is
now faced with the threat of an
educational deficit that will
make it not a bankrupt, but an
inferior university.

Despite a growing "cost crisis"
in higher education, Stanford's
financial statement for the past
academic year shows Stanford
to be still operating in the
black.
However, Kenneth M. Cuth
bertson, vice-president for fi
nance, warns that Stanford is
incurring a higher and higher
"educational deficit" in critically
important academic improve
ments which have been cancelled
or deferred.
The 1967 financial report, re
leased today, indicates total Uni
versity expenditures of $130 mil
lion dollars in the fiscal year
ending August 31. Total income
for the year narrowly exceeded
the total operating expenditures
and has given the University an
unrestricted and uncommitted
balance of less than $3 million
to carry into the new fiscal year.
Cuthbertson noted drama fa

cilities, library improvements,
and increases in student aid as
three prime areas of the educa
tional deficit.
Almost every one of the 1400
private colleges and universities
in the country faces a financial
crisis without historical prece
dent. Experts claim private in
stittuions of higher learning
cannot continue to operate with
out becoming exclusive academ
ies for the elite or inferior insti
tutions with huge educational
deficits. Many institutions of
higher learning are already en
tering the era of deficit finan
cing.
Ten years ago Stanford fore
saw a gap between minimum ex
penditures and predictable in
come of $2 million by 1962. Part
ly through incurring an educa
tional deficit and partly through
unexpected increases in income
Stanford has continued to oper
ate in the black. However, this
September, Vice President Cuth

bertson predicted a deficit of $4
million by 1972 and $9 million
by 1977.
Find New Sources
Stanford must find large
sources of new revenue or it
will be forced to curtail many
more educational programs and
innovations during the coming
years. Due to an uncertainty
concerning federal funds avail
able this year for research, Pro
vost Richard Lyman Tuesday di
rected programs dependent on
federal grants to limit the hir
ing of new faculty and the de
velopment of new programs.
Jordan Hall and the west wing
of Encina Hall remain empty
awaiting funds for rennovation.
Several universities have
faced crises of such proportions
that they have already become
public institutions. The Univer
sities of Houston, Buffalo, Pitts
burgh, Kansas City University,
and Temple University have all

become public during the past
five years.
Rising educational costs have
created the financial crisis for
private universities. In a letter
accompanying Stanford's finan
cial report, Cuthbertson writes:
"The highest quality of learning
and education will without
doubt continue to increase in
cost — and at a rapid rate." The
increases are primarily in fac
ulty salaries, the maintenance
of larger facilities, and the ne
cessity for private institutions
to offer higher quality. Some
consider the greatest value of
an independent institution to be
its ability to pursue and inde
pendent mission, and not simply
render services directed by the
state legislature.
McGeorge Bundy, president of
the Ford Foundation, has recent
ly criticized the universities for
not clearly stating the facts and
figures of the financial crisis. He
also chided the universities for
what he called timid and inex
pert investment of their endow
ments. The Ford Foundation has
recently announced it cannot
hope to provide the extensive
funds it has provided in the past
for higher education.
Stanford was the recipient of
one of the largest grants Ford
has made to any university. A
Ford gift of $25 million was
matched by over $75 million in

Despite a growing "cost crisis"
in higher education, Stanford's
financial statement for the past
academic year shows Stanford
to be still operating in the
black.
However, Kenneth M. Cuth
bertson, vice-president for fi
nance, warns that Stanford is
incurring a higher and higher
"educational deficit" in critically
important academic improve
ments which have been cancelled
or deferred.
The 1967 financial report, re
leased today, indicates total Uni
versity expenditures of $130 mil
lion dollars in the fiscal year
ending August 31. Total income
for the year narrowly exceeded
the total operating expenditures
and has given the University an
unrestricted and uncommitted
balance of less than $3 million
to carry into the new fiscal year.
Cuthbertson noted drama fa

cilities, library improvements,
and increases in student aid as
three prime areas of the educa
tional deficit.
Almost every one of the 1400
private colleges and universities
in the country faces a financial
crisis without historical prece
dent. Experts claim private in
stittuions of higher learning
cannot continue to operate with
out becoming exclusive academ
ies for the elite or inferior insti
tutions with huge educational
deficits. Many institutions of
higher learning are already en
tering the era of deficit finan
cing.
Ten years ago Stanford fore
saw a gap between minimum ex
penditures and predictable in
come of $2 million by 1962. Part
ly through incurring an educa
tional deficit and partly through
unexpected increases in income
Stanford has continued to oper
ate in the black. However, this
September, Vice President Cuth

bertson predicted a deficit of $4
million by 1972 and $9 million
by 1977.
Find New Sources
Stanford must find large
sources of new revenue or it
will be forced to curtail many
more educational programs and
innovations during the coming
years. Due to an uncertainty
concerning federal funds avail
able this year for research, Pro
vost Richard Lyman Tuesday di
rected programs dependent on
federal grants to limit the hir
ing of new faculty and the de
velopment of new programs.
Jordan Hall and the west wing
of Encina Hall remain empty
awaiting funds for rennovation.
Several universities have
faced crises of such proportions
that they have already become
public institutions. The Univer
sities of Houston, Buffalo, Pitts
burgh, Kansas City University,
and Temple University have all

become public during the past
five years.
Rising educational costs have
created the financial crisis for
private universities. In a letter
accompanying Stanford's finan
cial report, Cuthbertson writes:
"The highest quality of learning
and education will without
doubt continue to increase in
cost — and at a rapid rate." The
increases are primarily in fac
ulty salaries, the maintenance
of larger facilities, and the ne
cessity for private institutions
to offer higher quality. Some
consider the greatest value of
an independent institution to be
its ability to pursue and inde
pendent mission, and not simply
render services directed by the
state legislature.
McGeorge Bundy, president of
the Ford Foundation, has recent
ly criticized the universities for
not clearly stating the facts and
figures of the financial crisis. He
also chided the universities for
what he called timid and inex
pert investment of their endow
ments. The Ford Foundation has
recently announced it cannot
hope to provide the extensive
funds it has provided in the past
for higher education.
Stanford was the recipient of
one of the largest grants Ford
has made to any university. A
Ford gift of $25 million was
matched by over $75 million in
Stanford's PACE program. The
money was solicited between
1961 and 1964.
Stanford's success in avoiding
deficit financing is attributed pri
marily to the accurate cost pre
dictions it has made during the
past ten years. Only recently
have other universities adopted
many of the techniques long
used by Stanford. Two years ago
the Trustees considered the fi
nancial outlook and planned a
slower overall growth rate,
thereby introducing many edu
cational deficits.
War Impact
The cost crisis is complicated
today by several factors. The
first is the impact of the war on
both federal grants and private
philanthropy. In budgeting for
the next fiscal year, Cuthbertson
admits "we have to assume
there is going to be a downturn
if there is no change in other
federal expenditures, principally
for the Vietnam war. We have
to figure we will get hit pretty
hard in a rollback on research
grants."
However, Cuthbertson claims,
that Stanford's total income
from federal grants will not fall
during the coming year. This in
come figure has risen more than
20 percent per year to last
year's $53 million. Cuthbertson
sees a flattening out of the in

come from federal grants, but
not an immediate drop.
What avenues exist for Stan
ford to increase its total income,
thereby relieving the education
al deficit? Tuition is the first
possibility, and Cuthbertson pre
dicted that the direct cost of a
Stanford education will rise sig
nificantly in the next few years.
He estimated an 8 percent rise
per year which would carry tui
tion to $1920 in 1968, $2075 in
1969, and $2240 in 1970. He em
phasized these figures would be
reevaluated yearly. However, he
foresees little possible increase
beyond that.
Inadequate Endowment
Stanford's endowment cannot
absorb the crisis. It is $240 mil
lion while Harvard's is about $1
billion and Yale's runs well over
$500 million. Stanford receives
only 18 percent of its operating
revenue from endowment while
most other major universities
have upped the figure to about
30 percent. At the same time,
Stanford relies on gifts for 30
percent of its operating revenue
while other instittuions need
only about 20 percent.
The instability of gifts has ne
cessitated much more careful
projection of future financial sta
tus. A low endowment means
Stanford cannot support deficit
financing for long.
Stanford has succeeded in im
proving its educational pro
grams significantly in the past
twenty years, without incurring
a financial deficit. However, it is
now faced with the threat of an
educational deficit that will
make it not a bankrupt, but an
inferior university.

also chided the universities for
what he called timid and inex
pert investment of their endow
ments. The Ford Foundation has
recently announced it cannot
hope to provide the extensive
funds it has provided in the past
for higher education.
Stanford was the recipient of
one of the largest grants Ford
has made to any university. A
Ford gift of $25 million was
matched by over $75 million in
Stanford's PACE program. The
money was solicited between
1961 and 1964.
Stanford's success in avoiding
deficit financing is attributed pri
marily to the accurate cost pre
dictions it has made during the
past ten years. Only recently
have other universities adopted
many of the techniques long
used by Stanford. Two years ago
the Trustees considered the fi
nancial outlook and planned a
slower overall growth rate,
thereby introducing many edu
cational deficits.
War Impact
The cost crisis is complicated
today by several factors. The
first is the impact of the war on
both federal grants and private
philanthropy. In budgeting for
the next fiscal year, Cuthbertson
admits "we have to assume
there is going to be a downturn
if there is no change in other
federal expenditures, principally
for the Vietnam war. We have
to figure we will get hit pretty
hard in a rollback on research
grants."
However, Cuthbertson claims,
that Stanford's total income
from federal grants will not fall
during the coming year. This in
come figure has risen more than
20 percent per year to last
year's $53 million. Cuthbertson
sees a flattening out of the in

come from federal grants, but
not an immediate drop.
What avenues exist for Stan
ford to increase its total income,
thereby relieving the education
al deficit? Tuition is the first
possibility, and Cuthbertson pre
dicted that the direct cost of a
Stanford education will rise sig
nificantly in the next few years.
He estimated an 8 percent rise
per year which would carry tui
tion to $1920 in 1968, $2075 in
1969, and $2240 in 1970. He em
phasized these figures would be
reevaluated yearly. However, he
foresees little possible increase
beyond that.
Inadequate Endowment
Stanford's endowment cannot
absorb the crisis. It is $240 mil
lion while Harvard's is about $1
billion and Yale's runs well over
$500 million. Stanford receives
only 18 percent of its operating
revenue from endowment while
most other major universities
have upped the figure to about
30 percent. At the same time,
Stanford relies on gifts for 30
percent of its operating revenue
while other instittuions need
only about 20 percent.
The instability of gifts has ne
cessitated much more careful
projection of future financial sta
tus. A low endowment means
Stanford cannot support deficit
financing for long.
Stanford has succeeded in im
proving its educational pro
grams significantly in the past
twenty years, without incurring
a financial deficit. However, it is
now faced with the threat of an
educational deficit that will
make it not a bankrupt, but an
inferior university.

Despite a growing "cost crisis"
in higher education, Stanford's
financial statement for the past
academic year shows Stanford
to be still operating in the
black.
However, Kenneth M. Cuth
bertson, vice-president for fi
nance, warns that Stanford is
incurring a higher and higher
"educational deficit" in critically
important academic improve
ments which have been cancelled
or deferred.
The 1967 financial report, re
leased today, indicates total Uni
versity expenditures of $130 mil
lion dollars in the fiscal year
ending August 31. Total income
for the year narrowly exceeded
the total operating expenditures
and has given the University an
unrestricted and uncommitted
balance of less than $3 million
to carry into the new fiscal year.
Cuthbertson noted drama fa

cilities, library improvements,
and increases in student aid as
three prime areas of the educa
tional deficit.
Almost every one of the 1400
private colleges and universities
in the country faces a financial
crisis without historical prece
dent. Experts claim private in
stittuions of higher learning
cannot continue to operate with
out becoming exclusive academ
ies for the elite or inferior insti
tutions with huge educational
deficits. Many institutions of
higher learning are already en
tering the era of deficit finan
cing.
Ten years ago Stanford fore
saw a gap between minimum ex
penditures and predictable in
come of $2 million by 1962. Part
ly through incurring an educa
tional deficit and partly through
unexpected increases in income
Stanford has continued to oper
ate in the black. However, this
September, Vice President Cuth

bertson predicted a deficit of $4
million by 1972 and $9 million
by 1977.
Find New Sources
Stanford must find large
sources of new revenue or it
will be forced to curtail many
more educational programs and
innovations during the coming
years. Due to an uncertainty
concerning federal funds avail
able this year for research, Pro
vost Richard Lyman Tuesday di
rected programs dependent on
federal grants to limit the hir
ing of new faculty and the de
velopment of new programs.
Jordan Hall and the west wing
of Encina Hall remain empty
awaiting funds for rennovation.
Several universities have
faced crises of such proportions
that they have already become
public institutions. The Univer
sities of Houston, Buffalo, Pitts
burgh, Kansas City University,
and Temple University have all

become public during the past
five years.
Rising educational costs have
created the financial crisis for
private universities. In a letter
accompanying Stanford's finan
cial report, Cuthbertson writes:
"The highest quality of learning
and education will without
doubt continue to increase in
cost — and at a rapid rate." The
increases are primarily in fac
ulty salaries, the maintenance
of larger facilities, and the ne
cessity for private institutions
to offer higher quality. Some
consider the greatest value of
an independent institution to be
its ability to pursue and inde
pendent mission, and not simply
render services directed by the
state legislature.
McGeorge Bundy, president of
the Ford Foundation, has recent
ly criticized the universities for
not clearly stating the facts and
figures of the financial crisis. He
also chided the universities for
what he called timid and inex
pert investment of their endow
ments. The Ford Foundation has
recently announced it cannot
hope to provide the extensive
funds it has provided in the past

from federal grants will not fall
during the coming year. This in
come figure has risen more than
20 percent per year to last
year's $53 million. Cuthbertson
sees a flattening out of the in

come from federal grants, but
not an immediate drop.
What avenues exist for Stan
ford to increase its total income,
thereby relieving the education
al deficit? Tuition is the first
possibility, and Cuthbertson pre
dicted that the direct cost of a
Stanford education will rise sig
nificantly in the next few years.
He estimated an 8 percent rise
per year which would carry tui
tion to $1920 in 1968, $2075 in
1969, and $2240 in 1970. He em
phasized these figures would be
reevaluated yearly. However, he
foresees little possible increase
beyond that.
Inadequate Endowment
Stanford's endowment cannot
absorb the crisis. It is $240 mil
lion while Harvard's is about $1
billion and Yale's runs well over
$500 million. Stanford receives
only 18 percent of its operating
revenue from endowment while
most other major universities
have upped the figure to about
30 percent. At the same time,
Stanford relies on gifts for 30
percent of its operating revenue
while other instittuions need
only about 20 percent.
The instability of gifts has ne
cessitated much more careful
projection of future financial sta
tus. A low endowment means
Stanford cannot support deficit
financing for long.
Stanford has succeeded in im
proving its educational pro
grams significantly in the past
twenty years, without incurring
a financial deficit. However, it is
now faced with the threat of an
educational deficit that will
make it not a bankrupt, but an
inferior university.

Despite a growing "cost crisis"
in higher education, Stanford's
financial statement for the past
academic year shows Stanford
to be still operating in the
black.
However, Kenneth M. Cuth
bertson, vice-president for fi
nance, warns that Stanford is
incurring a higher and higher
"educational deficit" in critically
important academic improve
ments which have been cancelled
or deferred.
The 1967 financial report, re
leased today, indicates total Uni
versity expenditures of $130 mil
lion dollars in the fiscal year
ending August 31. Total income
for the year narrowly exceeded
the total operating expenditures
and has given the University an
unrestricted and uncommitted
balance of less than $3 million
to carry into the new fiscal year.
Cuthbertson noted drama fa

cilities, library improvements,
and increases in student aid as
three prime areas of the educa
tional deficit.
Almost every one of the 1400
private colleges and universities
in the country faces a financial
crisis without historical prece
dent. Experts claim private in
stittuions of higher learning
cannot continue to operate with
out becoming exclusive academ
ies for the elite or inferior insti
tutions with huge educational
deficits. Many institutions of
higher learning are already en
tering the era of deficit finan
cing.
Ten years ago Stanford fore
saw a gap between minimum ex
penditures and predictable in
come of $2 million by 1962. Part
ly through incurring an educa
tional deficit and partly through
unexpected increases in income
Stanford has continued to oper
ate in the black. However, this
September, Vice President Cuth

bertson predicted a deficit of $4
million by 1972 and $9 million
by 1977.
Find New Sources
Stanford must find large
sources of new revenue or it
will be forced to curtail many
more educational programs and
innovations during the coming
years. Due to an uncertainty
concerning federal funds avail
able this year for research, Pro
vost Richard Lyman Tuesday di
rected programs dependent on
federal grants to limit the hir
ing of new faculty and the de
velopment of new programs.
Jordan Hall and the west wing
of Encina Hall remain empty
awaiting funds for rennovation.
Several universities have
faced crises of such proportions
that they have already become
public institutions. The Univer
sities of Houston, Buffalo, Pitts
burgh, Kansas City University,
and Temple University have all

become public during the past
five years.
Rising educational costs have
created the financial crisis for
private universities. In a letter
accompanying Stanford's finan
cial report, Cuthbertson writes:
"The highest quality of learning
and education will without
doubt continue to increase in
cost — and at a rapid rate." The
increases are primarily in fac
ulty salaries, the maintenance
of larger facilities, and the ne
cessity for private institutions
to offer higher quality. Some
consider the greatest value of
an independent institution to be
its ability to pursue and inde
pendent mission, and not simply
render services directed by the
state legislature.
McGeorge Bundy, president of
the Ford Foundation, has recent
ly criticized the universities for
not clearly stating the facts and
figures of the financial crisis. He
also chided the universities for
what he called timid and inex
pert investment of their endow
ments. The Ford Foundation has
recently announced it cannot
hope to provide the extensive
funds it has provided in the past
for higher education.
Stanford was the recipient of
one of the largest grants Ford
has made to any university. A
Ford gift of $25 million was
matched by over $75 million in
Stanford's PACE program. The
money was solicited between
1961 and 1964.
Stanford's success in avoiding
deficit financing is attributed pri
marily to the accurate cost pre
dictions it has made during the
past ten years. Only recently
have other universities adopted
many of the techniques long
used by Stanford. Two years ago
the Trustees considered the fi
nancial outlook and planned a
slower overall growth rate,
thereby introducing many edu
cational deficits.
War Impact
The cost crisis is complicated
today by several factors. The
first is the impact of the war on
both federal grants and private
philanthropy. In budgeting for
the next fiscal year, Cuthbertson
admits "we have to assume
there is going to be a downturn
if there is no change in other
federal expenditures, principally
for the Vietnam war. We have
to figure we will get hit pretty
hard in a rollback on research
grants."
However, Cuthbertson claims,
that Stanford's total income
from federal grants will not fall
during the coming year. This in
come figure has risen more than
20 percent per year to last
year's $53 million. Cuthbertson
sees a flattening out of the in

come from federal grants, but
not an immediate drop.
What avenues exist for Stan
ford to increase its total income,
thereby relieving the education
al deficit? Tuition is the first
possibility, and Cuthbertson pre
dicted that the direct cost of a
Stanford education will rise sig
nificantly in the next few years.

per year which would carry tui
tion to $1920 in 1968, $2075 in
1969, and $2240 in 1970. He em
phasized these figures would be
reevaluated yearly. However, he
foresees little possible increase
beyond that.
