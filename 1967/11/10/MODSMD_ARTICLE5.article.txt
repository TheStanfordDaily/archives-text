# Stanford Cost Crisis
## $4 Million Deficit By '70 
### KIRK HANSON 
Despite a growing "cost crisis"
in higher education, Stanford's
financial statement for the past
academic year shows Stanford
to be still operating in the
black.
However, Kenneth M. Cuth
bertson, vice-president for fi
nance, warns that Stanford is
incurring a higher and higher
"educational deficit" in critically
important academic improve
ments which have been cancelled
or deferred.
The 1967 financial report, re
leased today, indicates total Uni
versity expenditures of $130 mil
lion dollars in the fiscal year
ending August 31. Total income
for the year narrowly exceeded
the total operating expenditures
and has given the University an
unrestricted and uncommitted
balance of less than $3 million
to carry into the new fiscal year.
Cuthbertson noted drama fa

cilities, library improvements,
and increases in student aid as
three prime areas of the educa
tional deficit.
Almost every one of the 1400
private colleges and universities
in the country faces a financial
crisis without historical prece
dent. Experts claim private in
stittuions of higher learning
cannot continue to operate with
out becoming exclusive academ
ies for the elite or inferior insti
tutions with huge educational
deficits. Many institutions of
higher learning are already en
tering the era of deficit finan
cing.
Ten years ago Stanford fore
saw a gap between minimum ex
penditures and predictable in
come of $2 million by 1962. Part
ly through incurring an educa
tional deficit and partly through
unexpected increases in income
Stanford has continued to oper
ate in the black. However, this
September, Vice President Cuth

bertson predicted a deficit of $4
million by 1972 and $9 million
by 1977.
Find New Sources
Stanford must find large
sources of new revenue or it
will be forced to curtail many
more educational programs and
innovations during the coming
years. Due to an uncertainty
concerning federal funds avail
able this year for research, Pro
vost Richard Lyman Tuesday di
rected programs dependent on
federal grants to limit the hir
ing of new faculty and the de
velopment of new programs.
Jordan Hall and the west wing
of Encina Hall remain empty
awaiting funds for rennovation.
Several universities have
faced crises of such proportions
that they have already become
public institutions. The Univer
sities of Houston, Buffalo, Pitts
burgh, Kansas City University,
and Temple University have all

become public during the past
five years.
Rising educational costs have
created the financial crisis for
private universities. In a letter
accompanying Stanford's finan
cial report, Cuthbertson writes:
"The highest quality of learning
and education will without
doubt continue to increase in
cost — and at a rapid rate." The
increases are primarily in fac
ulty salaries, the maintenance
of larger facilities, and the ne
cessity for private institutions
to offer higher quality. Some
consider the greatest value of
an independent institution to be
its ability to pursue and inde
pendent mission, and not simply
render services directed by the
state legislature.
McGeorge Bundy, president of
the Ford Foundation, has recent
ly criticized the universities for
not clearly stating the facts and
figures of the financial crisis. He
