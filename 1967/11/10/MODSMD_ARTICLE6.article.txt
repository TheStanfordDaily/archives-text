# Cheerleader Results Delayed By Irregularities In Election
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Alleged election irregularities
have delayed the announcement
of head cheerleader voting re

sults until after a Judicial Coun
cil ruling next Monday.
Forty-five legislature repre
sentatives were also to have
been elected yesterday, but two
ties have necessitated a run-off
election Nov. 15 and 16.
A proposition supporting
the "peace vigil" passed by a
4.4 to 1 ratio.
Violations of electioneering
procedures constitute the accu
sations, according to said Elec
tions Commissioner Craig
Brown. Charges include placing
posters in illegal locations, over
expenditures, and campaigning
within 25 feet of the polls.
"Four of the seven candidates
have been accused of violations,"
Assistant Commissioner Skip
Tammany said.
The five-member Judicial Coun
cil will meet Monday at 7:30
p.m. to decide whether to dis
miss the charges, assess fines,
or disqualify candidates. "The
ballots have been counted," said
Brown, "but we can't release the
results without a ruling from
the Judicial Council."
Violations Referred
The elections commission ex
plained in a statement last
night, "We have decided to refer
to Judicial Council several viola
tions reported to us in the Head
Yell Leader election, on the
grounds that no penalty we are

constitutionally able to impose
would have any effect on the
votes already cast. The results
of the primary voting will not
be announced until the Judicial
Council has met and decided on
these violations."
If no candidate receives the
necessary majority of votes, the
top two candidates will meet in
a run-off election. A four way
tie for three graduate school
humanities and sciences LASSU
representatives and a two way
tie for an off-campus represent
ative will also be broken in an
other election.
"Any run-offs needed will be
held Wednesday and Thursday
of next week," said Brown.
"Not too many people partici
pated," added Brown, citing the
2935 voter turnout. 1518 sup
ported the "peace vigil"; 344 op
posed it. 226 votes for head
cheerleader were received from

overseas campuses. "This is the
first time ballots have been sent
overseas," said Tammany.
Distracted Main Purpose
"Placing a proposition of na
tional interest on the ballot de
tracted from the main purpose
of the election, to elect head
cheerleader and LASSU repre
sentatives," Tammany said.
"Only about two-thirds of the
people who voted, voted for a
head cheerleader candidate," he
added.
"Because of the effect of this
proposition we're planning to re
view the bylaws and have this
sort of question decided during
a separate election or poll,"
Tammany stated. Such a change,
he notes, would have to be ap
proved by the Legislature.
255 of the undergraduates not
living in a University residence
and not affiliated with a fra
ternity or eating club selected
19 of 49 candidates as Legisla
ture representatives.
They are: John Avery, Rich
ard S. Bogart, Jeffrey Brown
ing, Phair Corey, Michael Cou
zens, Owen Daniels, Kirk Han
son, Christopher Hargrove, John
W. Hejl, Jeffrey H. Kane, Tim
Logan, Henry Muller, A. Elder
field Osborne, Jr., Joe Reich,
Johnie Scott, Mary Lynne Sharp,

Theodore Spearman, John Parks
Trowbridge, Jr., Arthur L. Wil
son.
David Mannheimer and Kath
erine L. McMillan are tied for
the twentieth position.
242 of the graduate students
in the school of humanities and
sciences chose the following 22
representatives from 34 candi
dates.
William Henry Alexander,
Barry E. Askinas, Albert Ber
gensen, Salvatore Bizzarro, Yale

M. Braunstein, Michael Miller

George Lindsberg, David Lisch

Parnes, Edward John Ray, Jim
Roth, Fritz (Henry F.) Schae
fer, Stephen S. Smith, Richard
W. Wien.
Charles Brody, Guillermo Del
bue, Charles Fitts, and Delores
Mack are tied for the remaining
three positions.
At least four new Legislature
members belong to the Black
Student Union, at least five to
the Resistance or SDS, and at
least eight are graduate students
actively agitating for reforms in
University policy toward teach
ing assistants.
Controversial Proposition P,
urging immediate U.S. withdraw
al from Vietnam, was not consid
ered although it did appear on
the ballot.
The motion putting the propo
sition on the ballot was declared
invalid by Legislature speaker
Michael Weinstein when he
learned the motion's author was
not a member of the Legislature.
The new Legislature will hold
its first meeting next Thursday

"Placing a proposition of na

Tammany stated. Such a change,

sort of question decided during

Tammany stated. Such a change,
he notes, would have to be ap
proved by the Legislature.
255 of the undergraduates not

At least four new Legislature

actively agitating for reforms in
University policy toward teach

Controversial Proposition P,
urging immediate U.S. withdraw
al from Vietnam, was not consid
ered although it did appear on
the ballot.
The motion putting the propo

invalid by Legislature speaker
Michael Weinstein when he
learned the motion's author was
not a member of the Legislature.
The new Legislature will hold
its first meeting next Thursday
evening, Room 320, Geology cor

Alleged election irregularities
have delayed the announcement
of head cheerleader voting re

sults until after a Judicial Coun
cil ruling next Monday.
Forty-five legislature repre
sentatives were also to have
been elected yesterday, but two
ties have necessitated a run-off
election Nov. 15 and 16.
A proposition supporting
the "peace vigil" passed by a
4.4 to 1 ratio.
Violations of electioneering
procedures constitute the accu
sations, according to said Elec
tions Commissioner Craig
Brown. Charges include placing
posters in illegal locations, over
expenditures, and campaigning
within 25 feet of the polls.
"Four of the seven candidates
have been accused of violations,"
Assistant Commissioner Skip
Tammany said.
The five-member Judicial Coun
cil will meet Monday at 7:30
p.m. to decide whether to dis
miss the charges, assess fines,
or disqualify candidates. "The
ballots have been counted," said
Brown, "but we can't release the
results without a ruling from
the Judicial Council."
Violations Referred
The elections commission ex
plained in a statement last
night, "We have decided to refer
to Judicial Council several viola
tions reported to us in the Head
Yell Leader election, on the
grounds that no penalty we are

constitutionally able to impose
would have any effect on the
votes already cast. The results
of the primary voting will not
be announced until the Judicial
Council has met and decided on
these violations."
If no candidate receives the
necessary majority of votes, the
top two candidates will meet in
a run-off election. A four way
tie for three graduate school
humanities and sciences LASSU
representatives and a two way
tie for an off-campus represent
ative will also be broken in an
other election.
"Any run-offs needed will be
held Wednesday and Thursday
of next week," said Brown.
"Not too many people partici
pated," added Brown, citing the
2935 voter turnout. 1518 sup
ported the "peace vigil"; 344 op
posed it. 226 votes for head
cheerleader were received from

overseas campuses. "This is the
first time ballots have been sent
overseas," said Tammany.
Distracted Main Purpose
"Placing a proposition of na
tional interest on the ballot de
tracted from the main purpose
of the election, to elect head
cheerleader and LASSU repre
sentatives," Tammany said.
"Only about two-thirds of the
people who voted, voted for a
head cheerleader candidate," he
added.
