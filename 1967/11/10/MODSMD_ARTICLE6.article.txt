# Cheerleader Results Delayed By Irregularities In Election
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Alleged election irregularities
have delayed the announcement
of head cheerleader voting re

sults until after a Judicial Coun
cil ruling next Monday.
Forty-five legislature repre
sentatives were also to have
been elected yesterday, but two
ties have necessitated a run-off
election Nov. 15 and 16.
A proposition supporting
the "peace vigil" passed by a
4.4 to 1 ratio.
Violations of electioneering
procedures constitute the accu
sations, according to said Elec
tions Commissioner Craig
Brown. Charges include placing
posters in illegal locations, over
expenditures, and campaigning
within 25 feet of the polls.
"Four of the seven candidates
have been accused of violations,"
Assistant Commissioner Skip
Tammany said.
The five-member Judicial Coun
cil will meet Monday at 7:30
p.m. to decide whether to dis
miss the charges, assess fines,
or disqualify candidates. "The
ballots have been counted," said
Brown, "but we can't release the
results without a ruling from
the Judicial Council."
Violations Referred
The elections commission ex
plained in a statement last
night, "We have decided to refer
to Judicial Council several viola
tions reported to us in the Head
Yell Leader election, on the
grounds that no penalty we are

constitutionally able to impose
would have any effect on the
votes already cast. The results
of the primary voting will not
be announced until the Judicial
Council has met and decided on
these violations."
If no candidate receives the
necessary majority of votes, the
top two candidates will meet in
a run-off election. A four way
tie for three graduate school
humanities and sciences LASSU
representatives and a two way
tie for an off-campus represent
ative will also be broken in an
other election.
"Any run-offs needed will be
held Wednesday and Thursday
of next week," said Brown.
"Not too many people partici
pated," added Brown, citing the
2935 voter turnout. 1518 sup
ported the "peace vigil"; 344 op
posed it. 226 votes for head
cheerleader were received from

overseas campuses. "This is the
first time ballots have been sent
overseas," said Tammany.
Distracted Main Purpose
"Placing a proposition of na
tional interest on the ballot de
tracted from the main purpose
of the election, to elect head
cheerleader and LASSU repre
sentatives," Tammany said.
"Only about two-thirds of the
people who voted, voted for a
head cheerleader candidate," he
added.
"Because of the effect of this
proposition we're planning to re
view the bylaws and have this
sort of question decided during
a separate election or poll,"
Tammany stated. Such a change,
he notes, would have to be ap
proved by the Legislature.
