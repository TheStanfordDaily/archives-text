# TA's Slated To Get $200 Salary Hike
## 
### 
Provost Richard Lyman an
nounced yesterday that teaching
assistant stipends at Stanford
will be increased from $2,100 to
$2,300 per year, effective with
the start of winter quarter.
Many of the teaching assist
ants organized into a union ear
lier this quarter and have ob
tained a charter from the Amer
ican Federation of Teachers.
The organizers stated two goals
for the union. One was the in
crease in salaries, and the other
was the elimination of the "ma
chine-like" grind involved in get
ting a graduate degree.
Administration officials em
phasize that the increase is in
no way connected with the new
union. Mr. Raymond Bacchetti
of Provost Lyman's office said
that the timing of the raise was
"entirely coincidental" and in no
way connected with the organi
zation of the TA's.
Dean Robert R. Sears of the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences commented that his only
"regret is that the raise isn't
$500 instead of $200."
Andrew Moss, TA in statistics
and head of the union, said,
"Sure it (the union) was an in
fluence, though it is hard to say
how much. I think we can cer
tainly claim some credit, espe
cially for getting it for the win
ter quarter." Moss further noted
that the raise "still leaves sala
ries very low."
The normal teaching assistant
assignment is for half-time

work. A tuition grant of up to
$1,104 accompanies these stip
ends, bringing their total value
up to $3,404 per year.
According to administration
sources an increase in teaching
assistant stipends was the high
est priority item among those
improvements for which funds
could not be assigned this year.
New budget projections, com
pleted last month, showed that
sufficient unrestricted income
would be available to finance the
$200 increase for the remainder
of the current academic year.
Provost Lyman said, in an
nouncing the increase, "Even at
$2,300 we still need to improve.
Recommendation for further in
creases will continue to be part
of our annual assessment of
budget priorities."
