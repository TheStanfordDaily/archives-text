"What does IBM offer a
tPh.D? I'd say diversity. But
" I think IBM's worth listening to because the advantages
that attracted mc are even stronger today. (This is Gary
Kozak, Ph.D. in Analytical-Physical Chemistry, an IBM
Development Chemist and Project Manager.)
"At IBM you're constantly working with people doing
advanced work in many different fields. That's a great asset
to any scientist because today's problems are often
interdisciplinary. You can't solve them with one kind of
background. You need inputs from three or four different
kinds of people.
"A good example is the solid logic technology used in
building the IBM System/360. The EE tells you how many
conductors you'll have, where they go, and what should be
at the terminals. An ME designs fixturing and automatic
processes. A Polymer Chemist formulates insulators
and says how they should be used. The Metallurgist
specifies alloy compositions. The Physicist decides how to
optimize a process for producing transistors and diodes.
And all these people have to talk with each other and
help each other.
"It's a stimulating environment, and it keeps you tech
nologically sharp. Of course, to do all this interfacing with
other disciplines, you need a free and informal atmosphere,
and IBM has it. It's a good place for a scientist to work."
There's more to the IBM story than Gary has mentioned.
You can get all the facts when we interview Ph.D.'s on
campus. Make an appointment at your placement office,
even if you're headed for military service.
Or if you can't make a campus interview, send an outline
of your interests and educational background to
