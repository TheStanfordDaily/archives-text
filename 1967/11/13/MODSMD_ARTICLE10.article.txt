## They'll Come Clean Under 3rd-Degree 
### Michael Sweeney 
The great interrogration comes Thursday.
At that time the nominees for the five student seats on the Com
mittee of Fifteen will submit to a third degree by the legislature.
The grilling promises to equal the best performances of McCarthy's
Committee on Un-American Activities.
LASSU will eventually select its representatives to the long
dormant Committee of Fifteen, but not before each has unfolded
his soul by answering 18 questions on campus issues.
Sparks will fly Thursday. The questions were drawn up by a
disgruntled group with political sentiments far different from those
of Peter Lyman's five nominees, some of whom are slightly to the
left of Che Guevara.
A usually unreliable source tipped us off as to the answers one
nominee plans to give.
(Imagine the scene. Speaker Michael Weinstein gravely intones
the questions, as an excited legislature quivers with anticipation.
The first nominee, Tom Trotsky, answers in a high, resounding
voice reminiscent of Robespierre.)
Question: What do you think of civil disobedience?
Answer: You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.
Question: Is the existence of ROTC on the Stanford campus legit
imate?
Answer: Is the existence of the Stanford campus legitimate?
Question: Should Stanford be engaged in "Big Time" sports?
Answer: Yes. But secretly.
Question: Should students be allowed to take any courses they
want?
Answer: No. Obviously we should throw out the science, mathe
matics and language requirements. In their place we should re
quire the Social Thought seminar. Taught by an outside agitator,
of course. Lovingly.
Question: Who should have ultimate decision-making responsi
bility at Stanford: the faculty, the administration, or the students?
Answer: You forgot the trustees. Actually, we all know the ulti
mate decision-maker here is Otis the ice cream vendor. I favor
instituting a student veto committee over Otis.
Question. What do you think about Stanford fraternities?
Answer: Yes, I think about Stanford fraternities.
Question: What are your special qualifications to represent stu
dents on the Committee of Fifteen?
Answer: My hometown is Pasadena and I am sexually frustrated.
Question: Do you feel that Committee of Fifteen secrecy serves
a purpose?
Answer: Certainly it serves a purpose. Have you ever tried to
negotiate when some damn Daily reporter is writing down every
thing you say?
Question: Would you favor increased parking facilities?
Answer: I demand the University tear up its parking lots and
plant flowers.
Question: Would you favor changes in graduate student meals?
Answer: Serve more meat. Any more stupid questions?
Question: Do you think ROTC courses should be taught for credit
or dropped completely?
Answer: I advocate moving all ROTC courses, students and pro
fessors to Fort Dix, N.J.
Question: How do you feel about demonstrations?
Answer: Deeply.
Question: If the question of the validity of the fraternity as a
living group in an "academic" community is brought before the
Committee of Fifteen, what views would you express?
Answer: It's not a question of validity. It's a question of taste.
Question: Are you In accordance with the action by various mem
bers of Resistance taken against the job interviews by the CIA?
Answer: Of course not. They left Encina hall standing.
Question: What is your notion of what constitutes an "academic
community?"
Answer: People relating to one another. Grass. No grades. No
tuition.
Question: Do you believe that all students be they of the far left
or the racist right should be permitted to utilize campus facilities
to air their point of view?
Answer: The far left and racist right do not have points of view.
They have faiths. I do not believe the campus has facilities which
can air a faith, that is, make it airborne. Maybe the aeronautics
department can come up with something.
Question: Do you believe that the University should provide facili
ties for all organizations, be they of the Free University of Palo
Alto or the CIA, to recruit students on the Stanford campus?
Answer. Haven't you heard? The CIA infiltrated Free University
eight months ago. That's why Free University, then called the
Experiment, moved off campus. All the radical students, CIA fig
ured, would spend so much time traveling to and from off-campus
classes that they'd fall behind in their Stanford classes and flunk
out. But we fooled them. We formed a new undercover Free Uni
versity right on campus. We call it the Department of Health
Education.
