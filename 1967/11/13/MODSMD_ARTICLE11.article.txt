# Another Attempt
## Big Game Riots Rage In Inner Quad 
### Herbie Hinckes 
Gunther Morgan burst into
his Wilbur room, out of breath
and quaking with fear.
His roommate, Milton Pallid,
put down his book and asked,
"Going out for cross-country?
You look like you've been run
ning around a little."
"There's a riot out there,"
Morgan said, pointing toward
Quad. "Why hasn't the National
Guard been called in yet?"
"A riot?"
"Yes. I may be only a foreign
student here, but I can tell a
riot when I see one. People are
painting big blue C's on every
thing, small groups of students
armed with clubs are roaming
all over, and they're building a
fortress in the middle of the dry
lake bed."
Just Big Game
Pallid pickod up his book
again. "It's just Big Game
week."
"But in Germany, troops

would have been called out
hours ago to stop all this de
struction."
Pallid put down his book
again, lit his pipe, and tried his
best to adopt a paternal atti
tude. "Look, roomie, it's an an
nual thing around here. Those
were just student pranks that
you saw. It's all part of the
rivalry between Stanford and
Cal."
Gunther was puzzled. "You
mean it's a joke? But I saw a
mob run into Inner Quad and
paint everything blue."
"Sure, there are probably a
few Stanford students painting
Berkeley red tonight, too."
"But what will happen to
them?"
Nothing Wrong
"Well, why should anything
happen, they haven't done any
thing wrong."
"But the people who were
blocking the doorway when the
CIA recruiter came are going to

be taken to Judicial Council."
Pallid laughed. "That's a dif
ferent matter entirely. Painting
the campus is just a harmless
RF, but obstructing the official
business of a government em
ployee is much more serious."
"Well, they didn't hurt the
CIA agent, but it's going to cost
some money to get all that paint
off the walls."
"No, you don't understand.
The university has plenty of
money to repair Big Gamf week
damage, but anybody who does
n't want the CIA to practice
free speech on campus will have
to be punished."
All Hell
"You Americans have a funny
system. On one hand, you find
a small covey of homosexuals
running around with your state
governor, but you don't do any
thing about it. But let a few
students protest the CIA and all
hell breaks loose."
"If you had ever studied Am

erican history, you would have
found out that this is just our
system of checks and balances."
"It's a pretty queer system if
you ask me. But what about
that fortress they're building in
the middle of the lake?" Morgan
asked. "Is that going to be the
recruiting office for the CIA
agent the next time he comes
to campus?"
"Don't be ridiculous. That will
be burned up in a bonfire the
night before Big Game."
"That doesn't sound very prac
tical. Wasteful Americans!"
"Remember those small bands
of students you saw roaming
around campus? Well, they
were guarding the bonfire."
Protect To Destroy
"They were protecting some
thing they were about to de
stroy?"
"We can't let Cal burn it
down first."
"What does it matter who
burns it down? A fire is a fire."

"It's very important to us,
almost as important as who
wins the Axe."
Morgan was in hysterics by
this time. "Axe? You mean to
tell me that besides fires, cam
pus vigilante squads, and mass
vandalism of the campus, you
have an Axe? What do you use
it for, executions?"
"No, it's a symbol. The win
ner of the football game on
Saturday gets to keep it for a
full year."
"What a thrill," Morgan in
toned, scarcely believing his
ears.
Pallid bowed his head. "But
our Axe was stolen this year."
"Are you going to play Big
Game? If the Axe is gone, then
there's nothing to be gained
from playing the game, is
there?"
"We can't pull out now and
still save face. We have to honor
our sacred commitment to the
athletic department."
Gunther Morgan burst into

Quad. "Why hasn't the National
Guard been called in yet?"
"A riot?"
"Yes. I may be only a foreign
student here, but I can tell a
riot when I see one. People are
painting big blue C's on every
thing, small groups of students
armed with clubs are roaming
all over, and they're building a
fortress in the middle of the dry
lake bed."
Just Big Game
Pallid pickod up his book
again. "It's just Big Game
week."
"But in Germany, troops

would have been called out
hours ago to stop all this de
struction."
Pallid put down his book
again, lit his pipe, and tried his
best to adopt a paternal atti
tude. "Look, roomie, it's an an
nual thing around here. Those
were just student pranks that
you saw. It's all part of the
rivalry between Stanford and
Cal."
Gunther was puzzled. "You
mean it's a joke? But I saw a
mob run into Inner Quad and
paint everything blue."
"Sure, there are probably a
few Stanford students painting
Berkeley red tonight, too."
"But what will happen to
them?"
Nothing Wrong
"Well, why should anything
happen, they haven't done any
thing wrong."
"But the people who were
blocking the doorway when the
CIA recruiter came are going to

be taken to Judicial Council."
Pallid laughed. "That's a dif
ferent matter entirely. Painting
the campus is just a harmless
RF, but obstructing the official
business of a government em
ployee is much more serious."
"Well, they didn't hurt the
CIA agent, but it's going to cost
some money to get all that paint
off the walls."
"No, you don't understand.
The university has plenty of
money to repair Big Gamf week
damage, but anybody who does
n't want the CIA to practice
free speech on campus will have
to be punished."
All Hell
"You Americans have a funny
system. On one hand, you find
a small covey of homosexuals
running around with your state
governor, but you don't do any
thing about it. But let a few
students protest the CIA and all
hell breaks loose."
"If you had ever studied Am

erican history, you would have
found out that this is just our
system of checks and balances."
"It's a pretty queer system if
you ask me. But what about
that fortress they're building in
the middle of the lake?" Morgan
asked. "Is that going to be the
recruiting office for the CIA
agent the next time he comes
to campus?"
"Don't be ridiculous. That will
be burned up in a bonfire the
night before Big Game."
"That doesn't sound very prac
tical. Wasteful Americans!"
"Remember those small bands
of students you saw roaming
around campus? Well, they
were guarding the bonfire."
Protect To Destroy
"They were protecting some
thing they were about to de
stroy?"
"We can't let Cal burn it
down first."
"What does it matter who
burns it down? A fire is a fire."

"It's very important to us,
almost as important as who
wins the Axe."
Morgan was in hysterics by
this time. "Axe? You mean to
tell me that besides fires, cam
pus vigilante squads, and mass
vandalism of the campus, you
have an Axe? What do you use
it for, executions?"
"No, it's a symbol. The win
ner of the football game on
Saturday gets to keep it for a
full year."
"What a thrill," Morgan in
toned, scarcely believing his
ears.
Pallid bowed his head. "But
our Axe was stolen this year."
"Are you going to play Big
Game? If the Axe is gone, then
there's nothing to be gained
from playing the game, is
there?"
"We can't pull out now and
still save face. We have to honor
our sacred commitment to the
athletic department."
Gunther Morgan burst into
his Wilbur room, out of breath
and quaking with fear.
His roommate, Milton Pallid,
put down his book and asked,
"Going out for cross-country?
You look like you've been run
ning around a little."
"There's a riot out there,"
Morgan said, pointing toward
Quad. "Why hasn't the National
Guard been called in yet?"
"A riot?"

fortress in the middle of the dry
lake bed."
Just Big Game
Pallid pickod up his book
again. "It's just Big Game
week."
"But in Germany, troops

would have been called out
hours ago to stop all this de
struction."
Pallid put down his book
again, lit his pipe, and tried his
best to adopt a paternal atti
tude. "Look, roomie, it's an an
nual thing around here. Those
were just student pranks that
you saw. It's all part of the
rivalry between Stanford and
Cal."
Gunther was puzzled. "You
mean it's a joke? But I saw a
mob run into Inner Quad and
paint everything blue."
"Sure, there are probably a
few Stanford students painting
Berkeley red tonight, too."
"But what will happen to
them?"
Nothing Wrong
"Well, why should anything
happen, they haven't done any
thing wrong."
"But the people who were
blocking the doorway when the
CIA recruiter came are going to

be taken to Judicial Council."
Pallid laughed. "That's a dif
ferent matter entirely. Painting
the campus is just a harmless
RF, but obstructing the official
business of a government em
ployee is much more serious."
"Well, they didn't hurt the
CIA agent, but it's going to cost
some money to get all that paint
off the walls."
"No, you don't understand.
The university has plenty of
money to repair Big Gamf week
damage, but anybody who does
n't want the CIA to practice
free speech on campus will have
to be punished."
All Hell
"You Americans have a funny
system. On one hand, you find
a small covey of homosexuals
running around with your state
governor, but you don't do any
thing about it. But let a few
students protest the CIA and all
hell breaks loose."
"If you had ever studied Am

erican history, you would have
found out that this is just our
system of checks and balances."
"It's a pretty queer system if
you ask me. But what about
that fortress they're building in
the middle of the lake?" Morgan
asked. "Is that going to be the
recruiting office for the CIA
agent the next time he comes
to campus?"
"Don't be ridiculous. That will
be burned up in a bonfire the
night before Big Game."
"That doesn't sound very prac
tical. Wasteful Americans!"
"Remember those small bands
of students you saw roaming
around campus? Well, they
were guarding the bonfire."
Protect To Destroy
"They were protecting some
thing they were about to de
stroy?"
"We can't let Cal burn it
down first."
"What does it matter who
burns it down? A fire is a fire."

"It's very important to us,
almost as important as who
wins the Axe."
Morgan was in hysterics by
this time. "Axe? You mean to
tell me that besides fires, cam
pus vigilante squads, and mass
vandalism of the campus, you
have an Axe? What do you use
it for, executions?"
"No, it's a symbol. The win
ner of the football game on
Saturday gets to keep it for a
full year."
"What a thrill," Morgan in
toned, scarcely believing his
ears.
Pallid bowed his head. "But
our Axe was stolen this year."
"Are you going to play Big
Game? If the Axe is gone, then
there's nothing to be gained
from playing the game, is
there?"
"We can't pull out now and
still save face. We have to honor
our sacred commitment to the
athletic department."
Gunther Morgan burst into
his Wilbur room, out of breath
and quaking with fear.
His roommate, Milton Pallid,
put down his book and asked,
"Going out for cross-country?
You look like you've been run
ning around a little."
"There's a riot out there,"
Morgan said, pointing toward
Quad. "Why hasn't the National
Guard been called in yet?"
"A riot?"
"Yes. I may be only a foreign
student here, but I can tell a
riot when I see one. People are
painting big blue C's on every
thing, small groups of students
armed with clubs are roaming
all over, and they're building a
fortress in the middle of the dry
lake bed."
