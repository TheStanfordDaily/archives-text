## 'Educational Deficit,' What Would You Like To Spend 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
What is an "educational defi
cit?" Cam it be measured in dol
lars? We are told that such a
deficit now exists at Stanford
because of an austerity program
introduced two years ago and
that the situation will get worse
in the future. Just what should
we make of all this?
The problem of running a uni

verslty should not be approached
from the viewpoint of crisis- or
deficit-mongering; neither should
funds be considered unlimited.
Instead the administration and
the trustees should choose those
areas that are truly important
and plan to spend, as needed, to
improve them. If, after this is
done, the amount of money re
quired is greater than will be
available, what should be done?

Raise tuition?
Several solutions are both sim
ple and obvious —raise tuition,
restrict pay increases, reduce li
brary book buying or student
aid, or refuse to construct a new
building. But any such plans are
inadequate unless a reason
able effort is made to determine
what the priorities of this uni
versity should be. And it is not
obvious that a new space sci

ences building is more important
than increased T.A. salaries.
Now to return to the "educa
tional deficit" described by Mr.
Cuthbertson. It must be the sum
of the student aid "deficit" and
the classics faculty "deficit" and
all the other "deficits" one can
imagine. These are the differ
ences between what is planned
or hoped for and what can be
provided. Therefore the educa
tional deficit can be any size—
all that matters is how much
more you would like to spend
after you find out what you
can spend.
Instead of dire forecasts of an
impending "cost crisis" and talk
of an educational deficit, we
could all benefit from a rational
discussion of what the budget
priorities are and who sets
them. Maybe there is a deficit of
educational planners and budg
eters.

• YR's Not Anti-P
Editor, the Daily:
I'd like to set the record
straight. A recent Daily article
contained the innuendo that the
Stanford Young Republicans
were the eminence gTls behind
the anti-P movement.
We were not. If it were so we

would not have used Fulbright
as an authority. His views on
Viet Nam are no more trans
cendent than are his views on
race. Both are myopic.
The Stanford YR's took no
action in favor of the anti-P
drive. Not a cent left our treas
ury on its behalf. While a ma
jority of our membership may
support our commitment to Viet
Nam there are those who do
not.
We have no desire to can
nibalize our club over this issue
which is far beyond any means
of our own resolution. There
fore we have refrained from
taking a stand. Besides, in this
age of the jack-ass there are too
few Republicans on the campus
as it is.
It is true that some of our
members were in the anti-P
drive. It is equally true that
there were those in the anti-P
drive who were not YR's. They
belong to the other party. In
any case they were acting as in
dividuals not as YR's or Demo
crats.

Editor, the Dally:
If the quotation from Mr.

Charles Bell ("It would be nice
to see what Stanford opinion
is on the war") is accurate, let
us hear no more crap from him
and his Young Republican
friends about "irresponsibility"
and other assorted evils. For
Mr. Bell and his cohorts, the
referendum on Proposition P is
a vote on the war, not on al
ternative proposals for ending
the war.
Their advertisement in Tues
day's Daily was a very sophisti
cated attempt to co-opt all posi
tions which do not agree pre
cisely with the wording of Prop
osition P. It is disappointing to
see how many people were
taken in.
The peace movement is not
splitting from within. It is be
ing split by the willingness of
many of its sympathizers to be
co-opted and thus immobilized
rather than to violate their pris
tine morality.
The issue of the war has to
be political if it is to be acted
upon, and pristine morality is
not a very effective political
tool. If those who consider
themselves to be part of the
movement don't have the so
phistication to deal with these
co-opting tactics, they had bet
ter develop it in a hurry.

Editor, The Dally:
The University's action in in
dicting nine students for activi
ties in the CIA demonstrations
is regrettable for several rea
sons, especially timing and se
lection. At a time when General
Hershey is demanding immedi
ate conscription of recruitment
protestors, the University has
seen fit to single out nine people
who may fall under this cate
gory.
Also, there were more than
100 people at the demonstration;
the University has tried to split
off nine "leaders." We feel that
this situation is intolerable. Any
one who was involved in any
way in the demonstration has
the same degree of guilt or in
nocence as the nine who have
been charged.
Therefore, on Friday we will
submit a letter to Mr. John Ras
kin, chairman of the Judicial
Council, implicating ourselves in
this action and demanding to be
prosecuted equally with the
nine. We call on all who want
to join us in this statement of
complicity to contact Merle Ra

• YR's Not Anti-P
Editor, the Daily:
I'd like to set the record
straight. A recent Daily article
contained the innuendo that the
Stanford Young Republicans
were the eminence gTls behind
the anti-P movement.
We were not. If it were so we

would not have used Fulbright
as an authority. His views on
Viet Nam are no more trans
cendent than are his views on
race. Both are myopic.
The Stanford YR's took no
action in favor of the anti-P
drive. Not a cent left our treas
ury on its behalf. While a ma
jority of our membership may
support our commitment to Viet
Nam there are those who do
not.
We have no desire to can
nibalize our club over this issue
which is far beyond any means
of our own resolution. There
fore we have refrained from
taking a stand. Besides, in this
age of the jack-ass there are too
few Republicans on the campus
as it is.
It is true that some of our
members were in the anti-P
drive. It is equally true that
there were those in the anti-P

belong to the other party. In
any case they were acting as in

If the quotation from Mr.

us hear no more crap from him
and his Young Republican
friends about "irresponsibility"
and other assorted evils. For
Mr. Bell and his cohorts, the
referendum on Proposition P is
a vote on the war, not on al
ternative proposals for ending
the war.
Their advertisement in Tues

cated attempt to co-opt all posi
tions which do not agree pre
cisely with the wording of Prop
osition P. It is disappointing to
see how many people were
taken in.
The peace movement is not
splitting from within. It is be
ing split by the willingness of
many of its sympathizers to be
co-opted and thus immobilized
rather than to violate their pris

The issue of the war has to
be political if it is to be acted

The University's action in in
dicting nine students for activi
ties in the CIA demonstrations
is regrettable for several rea
sons, especially timing and se
lection. At a time when General
Hershey is demanding immedi
ate conscription of recruitment
protestors, the University has
seen fit to single out nine people
who may fall under this cate
gory.
Also, there were more than
100 people at the demonstration;
the University has tried to split
off nine "leaders." We feel that
this situation is intolerable. Any
one who was involved in any
way in the demonstration has
the same degree of guilt or in
nocence as the nine who have
been charged.
Therefore, on Friday we will
submit a letter to Mr. John Ras
kin, chairman of the Judicial
Council, implicating ourselves in
this action and demanding to be
prosecuted equally with the
nine. We call on all who want
to join us in this statement of

What is an "educational defi
cit?" Cam it be measured in dol
lars? We are told that such a
deficit now exists at Stanford
because of an austerity program
introduced two years ago and
that the situation will get worse
in the future. Just what should
we make of all this?
The problem of running a uni

verslty should not be approached
from the viewpoint of crisis- or
deficit-mongering; neither should
funds be considered unlimited.
Instead the administration and
the trustees should choose those
areas that are truly important
and plan to spend, as needed, to
improve them. If, after this is
done, the amount of money re
quired is greater than will be
available, what should be done?

Raise tuition?
Several solutions are both sim
ple and obvious —raise tuition,
restrict pay increases, reduce li
brary book buying or student
aid, or refuse to construct a new
building. But any such plans are
inadequate unless a reason
able effort is made to determine
what the priorities of this uni
versity should be. And it is not
obvious that a new space sci

ences building is more important
than increased T.A. salaries.
Now to return to the "educa
tional deficit" described by Mr.
Cuthbertson. It must be the sum
of the student aid "deficit" and
the classics faculty "deficit" and
all the other "deficits" one can
imagine. These are the differ
ences between what is planned
or hoped for and what can be
provided. Therefore the educa
tional deficit can be any size—
all that matters is how much
more you would like to spend
after you find out what you
can spend.
Instead of dire forecasts of an
impending "cost crisis" and talk
of an educational deficit, we
could all benefit from a rational

The University's action in in
dicting nine students for activi
ties in the CIA demonstrations
is regrettable for several rea
sons, especially timing and se
lection. At a time when General
Hershey is demanding immedi
ate conscription of recruitment
protestors, the University has
seen fit to single out nine people
who may fall under this cate
gory.
Also, there were more than
100 people at the demonstration;
the University has tried to split
off nine "leaders." We feel that
this situation is intolerable. Any
one who was involved in any
way in the demonstration has
the same degree of guilt or in
nocence as the nine who have
been charged.
Therefore, on Friday we will
submit a letter to Mr. John Ras
kin, chairman of the Judicial
Council, implicating ourselves in
this action and demanding to be
prosecuted equally with the
nine. We call on all who want
to join us in this statement of

What is an "educational defi
cit?" Cam it be measured in dol
lars? We are told that such a
deficit now exists at Stanford
because of an austerity program
introduced two years ago and
that the situation will get worse
in the future. Just what should
we make of all this?
The problem of running a uni

verslty should not be approached
from the viewpoint of crisis- or
deficit-mongering; neither should
funds be considered unlimited.
Instead the administration and
the trustees should choose those
areas that are truly important
and plan to spend, as needed, to
improve them. If, after this is
done, the amount of money re
quired is greater than will be
available, what should be done?

Raise tuition?
Several solutions are both sim
ple and obvious —raise tuition,
restrict pay increases, reduce li
brary book buying or student
aid, or refuse to construct a new
building. But any such plans are
inadequate unless a reason
able effort is made to determine
what the priorities of this uni
versity should be. And it is not
obvious that a new space sci

ences building is more important
than increased T.A. salaries.
Now to return to the "educa
tional deficit" described by Mr.
Cuthbertson. It must be the sum
of the student aid "deficit" and
the classics faculty "deficit" and
all the other "deficits" one can
imagine. These are the differ
ences between what is planned
or hoped for and what can be
provided. Therefore the educa
tional deficit can be any size—
all that matters is how much
more you would like to spend
after you find out what you
can spend.
Instead of dire forecasts of an
impending "cost crisis" and talk
of an educational deficit, we
could all benefit from a rational
discussion of what the budget
priorities are and who sets
them. Maybe there is a deficit of
educational planners and budg
eters.

not.
We have no desire to can
