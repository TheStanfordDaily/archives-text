## Is Idealism A Trap 
### RENTON ROLPH 
Is idealism a trap? Is the life
style of idealism merely a treach
erous mirage, ever enticing the
most moral of men to frustra
tion and ruin?
This last week climaxed, as
Saturday passed into Sunday, in
a stirring and beautiful celebra
tion of peace and idealism in
Memorial Church. But during
that same week a Stanford pro
fessor found his idealistic way
of life and teaching sharply at
tacked.
Oliver E. Byrd, professor of
Health Education and head of
the department, has taught at
Stanford for the last thirty years.
And he has lived an ardent philo
sophy of the ideal governed by
his faith in the motives of the
people around him, particularly
his students. Last week, how
ever, Dr. Byrd was forced to
doubt his faith.
Abstracts As Evidence
Professor Byrd, believing sin
cerely in the self-perfectibility of
his students, has, since he began
teaching here in 1937, organized
his courses as much as possible
around independent study. He
'has always granted his stu
dents great freedom, allowing
them to evidence their reading
of numerous medical journal ar
ticles by submitting abstracts of
the articles.
The efficiency of this particu
lar system of learning which too
greatly emphasizes the mechan
ical and the quantitative, is defi
nitely questionable. However, the
philosophy behind it, freedom
for students, is precisely the
thought that is today the gen
erative force of the SES.
Professor Byrd's dilemma,
taken in a wider context, per

haps suggests certain limits of
general human capability.
Professor Byrd's idealism has
been taken advantage of by
grade-hungry students, non-ath
letes and athletes alike. Students
have enrolled in Health Ed 400
for the easy contract grades.
Athletes, in particular though,
have perversely used Byrd's sys
tem of granting up to 16 units
for independent work. In the
summer of 1966, three athletic
stars received 8, 10, and 12 units
of A for work in Health Ed 400.
Independent Study
Byrd is adamant in his devo
tion to independent study as the
best means to education. He
does not plan to change his
teaching style. He stands by his
ideals. And, for this, he well
might be ingenuous. I rathe*
think that he is a man of faith.
The moral burden because of
Dr. Byrd's stand has shifted.
It has come to rest on the stu
dents who enroll in his courses,
and upon the men in the ath
letic department who recom
mend Byrd's courses as "mickey
mouse."
There is truly little shame
around this University if peo
ple will continue to parasitically
attach themselves to a man's
vision. To defile a man's idealism
in this way is to deny all men
the possibility of the ideal and
to ultimately downgrade the
quality of the community.
Dr. Byrd has surely erred in
following certain teaching tech
niques, viz. the abstracts, but
the fact remains that he is an
inspiring and fine man. I ask,
what is really gained by fouling
his ideal? And, moreover, what
is lost?
I think Willy Loman could

well answer these questions.
Willy, certainly not perfect but
full of faith in the motives and
hopes of his sons and others
around him, comes to mind to
day. When Willy was fired as
a salesman, he lamented to us
as well as his employer, "A man
is not an orange. You can't eat
him and then throw away the
peel." But Willy was eaten and
died at his own hand. Perhaps,
let us hope not, but perhaps,
this is the way of faith.

grade-hungry students, non-ath
letes and athletes alike. Students
have enrolled in Health Ed 400
for the easy contract grades.
Athletes, in particular though,
have perversely used Byrd's sys
tem of granting up to 16 units
for independent work. In the
summer of 1966, three athletic
stars received 8, 10, and 12 units
of A for work in Health Ed 400.
Independent Study
Byrd is adamant in his devo
tion to independent study as the
best means to education. He
does not plan to change his
teaching style. He stands by his
ideals. And, for this, he well
might be ingenuous. I rathe*
think that he is a man of faith.
The moral burden because of
Dr. Byrd's stand has shifted.
It has come to rest on the stu
dents who enroll in his courses,
and upon the men in the ath
letic department who recom
mend Byrd's courses as "mickey
mouse."
There is truly little shame
around this University if peo
ple will continue to parasitically
attach themselves to a man's
vision. To defile a man's idealism
in this way is to deny all men
the possibility of the ideal and
to ultimately downgrade the
quality of the community.
Dr. Byrd has surely erred in
following certain teaching tech
niques, viz. the abstracts, but
the fact remains that he is an
inspiring and fine man. I ask,
what is really gained by fouling
his ideal? And, moreover, what
is lost?
I think Willy Loman could

well answer these questions.
Willy, certainly not perfect but
full of faith in the motives and
hopes of his sons and others
around him, comes to mind to
day. When Willy was fired as
a salesman, he lamented to us
as well as his employer, "A man
is not an orange. You can't eat
him and then throw away the
peel." But Willy was eaten and
died at his own hand. Perhaps,
let us hope not, but perhaps,
this is the way of faith.
Is idealism a trap? Is the life
style of idealism merely a treach
erous mirage, ever enticing the
most moral of men to frustra
tion and ruin?
This last week climaxed, as
Saturday passed into Sunday, in
a stirring and beautiful celebra
tion of peace and idealism in
Memorial Church. But during
that same week a Stanford pro
fessor found his idealistic way
of life and teaching sharply at
tacked.
Oliver E. Byrd, professor of
Health Education and head of
the department, has taught at
Stanford for the last thirty years.
And he has lived an ardent philo
sophy of the ideal governed by
his faith in the motives of the
people around him, particularly
his students. Last week, how
ever, Dr. Byrd was forced to
doubt his faith.
Abstracts As Evidence
Professor Byrd, believing sin
cerely in the self-perfectibility of
his students, has, since he began
teaching here in 1937, organized
his courses as much as possible
around independent study. He
'has always granted his stu
dents great freedom, allowing
them to evidence their reading
of numerous medical journal ar
ticles by submitting abstracts of
the articles.
The efficiency of this particu
lar system of learning which too
greatly emphasizes the mechan
ical and the quantitative, is defi
nitely questionable. However, the
philosophy behind it, freedom
for students, is precisely the
thought that is today the gen
erative force of the SES.
Professor Byrd's dilemma,
taken in a wider context, per

haps suggests certain limits of
general human capability.
