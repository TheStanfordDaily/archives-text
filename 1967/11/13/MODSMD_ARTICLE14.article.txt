Stanford students, compared
to those at the University of
London, seem financially better
off, better dressed, more polite,
and more politically involved at
the moment, according to a
world-famed classics scholar.
In an interview with The
Daily, Professor Thomas B. L.
Webster said he left England to
escape its "cloistered atmos
phere."
He thought that the "cultural
center of the world might al
ready be moving to California"
with its outlook over the Pa
cific.
He chose Stanford rather
than an Eastern university be
cause he "liked a good climate."
At Stanford there is "all the
excitement of making what you
can."
He Is "not sure if the thing

isn't much more alive and
changeable and fresh here"
than at some place like Harvard.
This is not the first time Web
ster has been at Stanford. He
visited here for one day In 1959,
and was a visiting professor
here for two quarters in 1964
and for the winter quarter in
1966.
In discussing ways of teach
ing Latin, Webster believes that
Latin should, if possible, be
started early when one still has
a "parrot memory" and can
memorize easily. He started
Latin when he was eight and
Greek when he was 9. When
he was 13, someone told him
that he might not do well in
classics since he "started Greek
so late."
Latin Mind?
He thinks it is wrong to drive
people to Latin if "they can't
do well." Webster wishes that

there were some method "to de
cide if (a person) has the sort
of mind that is happy with a
written language" before he
starts Latin.
In England, Latin is now
usually started at age 13 and
Greek at 16. This means that by
the time a British classics stu
dent starts taking university
courses he has a greater com
mand of the language than an
American who often does not
even have Greek in high school.
Since an American knows less
grammar when he reaches col
lege, it is more difficult for him
to read the literature. It takes
him more time to translate so
he has less time to think.
Progress Possible
In the United States, often a
student will not become inter
ested in the classics until he is
19. If he really wants to learn

and the "carrot is in front of
his nose," he can make remark
able progress. By the time a stu
dent who started Latin when he
was 13 and one who started
when he was 19 reach graduate
school, they may be "indistin
guisable."
There are problems in the lit
erature curriculum. "All girls
and boys read Caesar" in the
U.S. and Britain. This is "abso
lute nonsense" especially for
girls who are uninterested in
reading about waging war. The
students could just as easily
read Virgil. In England, they
must read Caesar because it is
on the national exam which stu
dents take when they are 16.
Webster objects to the British
system because it "puts exces
sive stress on technique in
language." He likes the Ameri
can idea of emphasizing litera
ture.

Progress Possible
In the United States, often a
student will not become inter

19. If he really wants to learn

and the "carrot is in front of
his nose," he can make remark
able progress. By the time a stu

was 13 and one who started
when he was 19 reach graduate
school, they may be "indistin

There are problems in the lit

and boys read Caesar" in the
U.S. and Britain. This is "abso

girls who are uninterested in
reading about waging war. The
students could just as easily
read Virgil. In England, they
must read Caesar because it is
on the national exam which stu

Webster objects to the British

Stanford students, compared
to those at the University of
London, seem financially better
off, better dressed, more polite,
and more politically involved at
the moment, according to a
world-famed classics scholar.
In an interview with The
Daily, Professor Thomas B. L.
Webster said he left England to
escape its "cloistered atmos
phere."
He thought that the "cultural
center of the world might al
ready be moving to California"
with its outlook over the Pa
cific.
He chose Stanford rather
than an Eastern university be
cause he "liked a good climate."
At Stanford there is "all the
excitement of making what you
can."
He Is "not sure if the thing

isn't much more alive and
changeable and fresh here"
than at some place like Harvard.
This is not the first time Web
ster has been at Stanford. He
visited here for one day In 1959,
and was a visiting professor
here for two quarters in 1964
and for the winter quarter in
1966.
In discussing ways of teach
ing Latin, Webster believes that
Latin should, if possible, be
started early when one still has
a "parrot memory" and can
memorize easily. He started
Latin when he was eight and
Greek when he was 9. When
he was 13, someone told him
that he might not do well in
classics since he "started Greek
so late."
Latin Mind?
He thinks it is wrong to drive
people to Latin if "they can't
do well." Webster wishes that

there were some method "to de
cide if (a person) has the sort
of mind that is happy with a
written language" before he
starts Latin.
In England, Latin is now
usually started at age 13 and
Greek at 16. This means that by
the time a British classics stu
dent starts taking university
courses he has a greater com
mand of the language than an
American who often does not
