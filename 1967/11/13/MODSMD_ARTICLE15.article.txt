## 130 Sit-In At Howard U. 
### 
Washington (CPS) — About
150 Howard University students
staged a sit-in Thursday in the
office of President James Nabrit
to protest compulsory ROTC re
quirements.
The sit-in ended after Nabrit
announced he would call a spe
cial meeting of the school's
Board of Trustees within 10 days
so a decision on the future of
compulsory ROTC can be made.
"We are going to get rid of
compulsory ROTC one way or
the other," according to Mich
ael Harris, freshman class presi
dent and one of the protest lead
ers. "If the school doesn't drop
it, then we will abolish it our
selves by not going to ROTC
classes or drills."
Every male Howard student
must take four semesters of
ROTC before he can graduate.

Students receive one credit hour
for each semester.
Harris said today's protest did
not involve the principle of hav
ing ROTC on campus, but mere
ly the fact that it is compulsory.
About 200 students were par
ticipating in the demonstration

when it began about 1 p.m.
The protesters hung in effigy
two dummies dressed in ROTC
uniforms.
The demonstration then pro
ceeded from the center of cam
pus to the president's office.
The 150 students at the sit-in
filled three rooms of the office.

Although today's protest end
ed with Nabrit's announcement
that he would call a special
board meeting, the students
said they will continue their
demonstrations until the school
decides to drop ROTC as a re
quirement for graduation.
