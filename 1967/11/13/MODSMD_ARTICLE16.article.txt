# Frats Spread Lots Of Cheer To UGLYers
## 
### 
Fraternities are finding the
year-old J. Henry Meyer Memor
ial Library a favorite initiation
ceremony grounds.
The second floor center area
of the library serves as a stage
for third and fourth floor bal
cony audiences for fraternity
pranks.
Delta Upsilon fraternity pre
sented several improvised skits
on the library stage last Thurs
day.
A Romeo and Juliet scene, a
short ballet, and falling objects
from the balconies were includ
ed in the show.
On Friday evening, Sigma
Alpha Epsilon pledges came to
the loan desk as a part of an ini
tiation treasure hunt. The twen
ty pledges were given the next
clue by the library worker in
charge after loudly reciting the
entire Greek alphabet.
Amused weekend bookers
watched from their balcony van
tage points.
Among other fraternity
pranks and skits, a group of
pledges from one fraternity kick
ed a boxful of empty beer cans
down the stairs from the fourth
floor to the first.
