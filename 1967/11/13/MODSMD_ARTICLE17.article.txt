## 'Wumberlogue' Hit 
### 
Late in Act I Heather Fergu
son sings her robust, ribald "All
He Needs is A Mother" and the
1967 Gaieties is airborne.
The Ram's Head musical
keeps soaring with humor and
song that make it the best Gaie
ties in recent years. Perhaps it
is the best Gaieties ever, be
cause it goes far in breaking out
of the stultifying confines of
topical Stanford humor.
The show opened Nov. 10 and
will play Thursday and Friday
in Memorial Auditorium.
"Wumberlogue," as the musi
cal is mis-named, starts off a bit
erratically but shows flashes of
brilliance that tell the audience
the show will rise above its
meandering plot. Then Miss
Ferguson, as Tweeny, a brazen
upstairs maid out to seduce the
sinister Duke of Berkeley
(Chuck Feinstein), brings down
the house with her burlesque
song and dance on how she will
win her man. Wumberlogue
starts rolling.
Gaieties In Transition
Generally Wumberlogue shows
the Gaieties in transition be
tween the pep-rally-on-stage and
the creative musical. The plot is,
as usual, merely a vehicle for
jokes and songs. Prince Stan
ford woos enchanted Princess,
daughter of evil Duke who feeds
unsuccessful suitors to goats.
Oppressed townspeople of Ber
keley persuade Tweeny to se
duce Duke, in hope he'll mel
low. Prince overcomes Stan
ford's dreaded "Trustybordal,"
and wins Princess, with help of
magical Wumberlogue. The two
couples eventually unite, one

hilariously, one soapily.
"Wumberlogue" turns the
trick of cracking sophisticated
jokes so well that they're imme
diately funny. Example: the
Duke of Berkeley asks, "What
is the magic word that drove
the barbarians out of my nu
merous provincial castles, kept
many from entering here, and
insured the sanctity of our pri
vacy and the furtherance of our
cause?"
Reply: "tuition."
Or this swipe at the off-cam
pus ruling last June in an ex
change between Prince Stanford
and Wumberlogue:
Prince: ". . . . the terrible
Trustybordal has decided to let
100 ladies go out of the kingdom
to live."
Wumberlogue: "Why just a
hundred?"
Prince: "Nobody knew. It's a
nice round number."
High Point
As for the production's most
outstanding characteristic, it's a
toss-up between acting and mu
sic. Feinstein and Miss Fergu
son show their wide theatrical
experience in thoroughly profes
sional performances. Feinstein
projects a wry, cynical wit as
the archetype evil Duke, and
Miss Ferguson, besides provid
ing the show's choreographic
highpoint, is completely believe
able in her role as a dumb but
lovable slut.
Bob Mattson as Prince Stan
ford ,a lampoon of our protect
ed, naive students, delights the
audience with his innocence.
The Princess, whose wooing by
Prince Stanford despite the

Duke's threats constitutes the
main plot, is played well by
Becky Whitehouse. The role
doesn't amount to much, but
Miss Whitehouse, an oldtimer at
Ram's Head, makes the most of
it.
The stars have as fine a sup
porting cast as they deserve.
Outstanding as the narrator is
Dan Erickson. Sid Weiss, as
Clump the guard, and Shannon
Mow, as Mary Drudge, are per
fect in their stock roles. And the
chorus is professional in its
song and dance.
The score was as fine as we've
come to expect from Gaieties,
and the technical aspects of the
production were exceptional.
Lighting, costumes and sets con
tributed to the air of a profes
sional musical.
Mis-Named Plot
I suppose I can't put off any
longer discussing the Wumber
logue himself. The play is mis
named because its plot, spirit
and best music and humor are
unrelated to the Wumberlogue,
a kind of effeminate Merlin
played by Stan Rutherford. The
audience loved his frivolity, so
perhaps I stand on weak ground
when I say the part was trivial
and a bit tedious. Although Ru
therford plays the Wumber
logue perfectly, he can't contrib
ute much to the show when his
jokes aren't really funny and his
actions don't really contribute to
the smoothness of the story
line.
In fact, the part of the Wum
berlogue illustrates the funda
mental problem of Gaieties — it
has just four performances. In
a professional musical, the show
is rewritten and restaged again
and again in New Haven or
Philadelphia before making the
big plunge on Broadway. Gaie
ties could be improved by some
judicious cuts and additions, if
director Mokler, playwright Rob
ert Sevra and composer Gary
Levinson had the time.
But since Gaieties is confined
to a few performances just be
fore the California football
match, it will always be hard to
improve much on the traditional
Gaieties, based on parochial Big
Game jokes with songs and a
plot thrown in as an after
thought. Mokler succeeds in his
ambition to direct a Gaieties
that would "stand on its own."
But will future Ram's Head
casts put in as much effort for
just four shows?
The show's best songs, for in
stance, would stand out the
more if the more inaudible sing
ers were written out of the
script. The magic in the subplot
of Tweeny and the Duke would
lighten the musical more if
these two characters received a
larger role at the expense of the
Prince of Stanford and the Prin
cess, who are good, but not as
good. But prefering the cynical
and ribald to the sincere and
pure characters merely reflects
a personal life view, so I'll make
that last judgment a tentative
one. — Michael Sweeney


DUKE AND UPSTAIRS MAID — Heather Ferguson, as Tweeney,
clutches a reluctant Chuck Feinstein playing the evil Duke of Ber
keley in the 1967 Gaities. Eventually she gets her man.
