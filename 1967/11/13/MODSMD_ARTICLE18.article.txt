## Gals' Mini-Garb Ranked 
### SCOTT KEENEY 
When, in the course of journal
istic events, it becomes neces
sary for a male reporter to do
an article on women's fashions,
he usually gets sick.
But when the story is about
collegiate fashion, when the sub
ject is mini-skirts and culottes,
and when the skirt wearers are
Stanford women, he still gets
sick.
But an assignment is an as
signment, as Clark Kent once
said, so your mild-mannered
fashion reporter has dauntlessly
accepted the challenge: to write
a story about women's skirt
fashions at Stanford.
Etymological Tautology
To define a mini-skirt or a eu?
lottes is to waste time. Ah! But
we Daily people often waste
time!
A mini-skirt is, tautologically,
a small skirt. Current average
skirt length, according to Mrs.
Gail Blake at the Stanford Em
porium, is 19 inches, or about
four inches above the knee of
the average girl.

"Culottes" is more difficult to
define. Webster's first definition
says, somewhat ironically, "hair
on the thighs of an animal." Per
haps (?) more apropos is the
second definition: "a divided
skirt."
Now that our terms are de
fined, we can move on. Or so
General Sherman stated as he
approached Georgia.
Male Reaction
What is really important
about mini-skirts and culottes is
the reaction of the Stanford
male to them. (Let us dismiss,
in this story at least, the socio
logical and psychological impli
cations of said skirt styles.)
"Culottes are for girls who
like to wear mini-skirts and who
like to cross their legs," says
Gary Thompson, a sophomore in
psychology.
Humanities major Hal Hughes
summarizes, "Culottes are the
coward's mini-skirt." He further
aphorizes, "Culottes are a fash
ionable chastity belt."
Willi am Eakland, "Spider
Man" to those who read last
week's ballot, comments, "They

(culottes, mini-skirts) look good
as long as they're also wearing
blue fishnet stockings."
Philosophical Comment
Professor John Mothershead
of the philosophy department re
marks, "The esthetic desirability
of mini-skirts varies directly
with the esthetic desirability of
that which is displayed."
Bob "Texas" Cheek, a senior
in history, concurs: "Ah think
they're cool cuz ya get ta see
more a the laigs."
Cheek is a big barbecue fan.
Psychology Professor Thomas
Landauer, after consulting his
alter ego, Professor J. Merrill
Carlsmith, ventures, "I like mini
skirts better than culottes."
Norris Pope, president of Del
Tache Fratty Club, doesn't like

mini-skirts or culottes. After
swearing mildly, he replies, "I
like them on basket cases."
Puritan Ethic
Bob "Rock" Hickman, senior
geology major, says, "I'm op
posed to them. They're immoral,
indecent, and unhealthy." He did
not elaborate.
Opinion Is not unanimous.
Most men interview like short
skirts, and most appear to favor
mini-skirts over culottes. Gen
erally, if it's short, it's liked;
and mini-skirts and culottes are
short.
As Mrs. Fay Carolina, a portly
clerk at Macy's, comments,
"They are selling well; and they
look good on young girls."
With that statement even Dave
Harris would agree.


HIGH RISE â€” The all-seeing eye of the camera here catches a
view of the latest feminine fashion rage, i.e M mini-divided-skirt or
culottes.
