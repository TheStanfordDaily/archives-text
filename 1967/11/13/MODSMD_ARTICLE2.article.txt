# Axe Comm Plans Rallies, R.F. 's For Big Game Week
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
Big Game Week 1067 offi
cially begins today! By next
Sunday the campus will have
witnessed six days and nights
of R.F.'s, dances, rallies, deco
rations competition, reunions,
movies, comedies, and a bon
fire — all culminating in the
big game itself and the festi
vities, parties, and orgies fol
lowing it.
While Cal has already
stolen our goalposts and made
a parity raid on one of the
coed houses in Stern, there
have been no reports yet of
Indian R.F.'s on the Berkeley
campus. The big question still
in everyone's mind is the lo
cation of the Axe.
Neil Okabayashi and mem
bers of the Axe Comm met
with Cal's Rally Comm Fri
day to discuss recovery of
the Axe. Neither Rally Comm
nor an assistant Cal dean ad
mitted any knowledge as to
the whereabouts of the Axe.
However, Okabayshi has re
ported Stanford presently
does have spies infiltrating the
Cal campus. He claimed, "We
have some very good ideas
about who stole it."
Both organizations are urg
ing their respective student
bodies to refrain from shoot
ing water balloons or using
sling shots during the game
Saturday. Last year this re
sulted In several chipped
teeth and other injuries.
Bury The Bear
A "Bury the Bear" rally
will be held Wednesday noon
on White Plaza. It is hoped
that a large crowd of Stan
ford students will see Oskl
laid to rest.
Over 400 freshmen have
signed up to participate in
Lake Lag's defense plan,
which begins today. Alex Mc-
Gilvray, chairman of bonfire
security, said that a loud
speaker system will be in
stalled and wallde talkies
given to guards in strategic

locations. There will be an
emergency siren system set
up in Wilbur in case guards
are ever outnumbered by Cal
raiders.
Young Boozer and Robin
Torrey, in charge of construc
tion and refreshments, plan to
start work on the bonfire at
7:00 a.m. Friday. Robin plans
to have the frosh dollies out
in force dispensing coffee,
hamburgers and donuts all
week to both the vigilant
freshman security teams and
the dauntless workers plan
ning to do the actual con
struction.
Concentric Rings
"Over 400 gallons of kero
sene will be poured on the
wood after construction is
completed Friday afternoon,"
stated freshman Adam Ben
noin. He is the frosh coordi
nator working under John
Arnold, a member of Cardi
nals Board, who is bonfire
chairman. Bennion added that
the bonfire will then be guard
ed in three concentric rings
totaling 350 people — includ
ing the frosh football team.
No one will then be allowed
to approach the lake until
6:30 Friday night, when a
pre-bonfire rally is slated to
begin.
Cardinals Board, a leading
service group at Stanford
composed of 13 juniors and
seniors, is responsible for to
tal organization of the bon
fire. John Arnold explained
this his group is responsible
for renting seven trucks
which will haul the wood, ob
taining a tractor, and secur
ing the telephone poles. The
wood was donated by
Pepsi Cola, Libby Fruit Com
pany, the Peninsula Cream
ery and various members of
the community.
Friday night there will be
a street dance on the lower
row financed by the Inter-Fra
ternity Council and co-spon
sored with Cardinals Board.

Cardinals Board is also in
charge of homecoming deco
rations competition. Chairman
Jim Massey stated that tro
phies will be awarded in five
areas: sweepstakes, anima
tion, humor, theme and origi
nality. The dorms, fraterni
ties, and other living groups
competing for the trophies
will be judged on Saturday
morning starting at 9:00 a.m.
Massey and Ron Nahas,
chairman of Cardinals Board,
agreed that "the decorations
should be quite novel this
year" because of the theme:
"Indians, Hang Bear Axe Ban
dits." They urge both stu
dents and alumni to tour the
campus Saturday morning to
view the decorations. Tro
phies will be awarded at half
time Saturday.
The Indians clash head-on
with the Bears at 1:30 Satur
day afternoon in Stanford
Stadium. It should be quite
a contest with Stanford's 54
record going against Cal's
4-5. A near-capacity crowd is
expected.
Many Celebrations
Following the game there
will be a number of celebra
tions both on and off campus.
The freshman • sponsored
party, The Induction, will be
held at Wilbur. It will feature
movies, light shows, and five
bands which will play until
3:00 a.m.
A number of fraternities
and dorms are planning off
campus frolics. Fred Tempes,
social chairman at Phi Kappa
Sigma, has planned a com
plete Saturday program with
a luncheon for alumni and
Phi Kaps from Cal in the af
ternoon and an overnight
party at Big Sur lodge in Car
mel. Dave Whitehead, Muir
House president, is looking
forward to dinner at the
White Whale restaurant in
San Francisco to the music of
the Howard Fredricks Quar
tet.

party, The Induction, will be
held at Wilbur. It will feature
movies, light shows, and five
bands which will play until
3:00 a.m.
A number of fraternities
and dorms are planning off
campus frolics. Fred Tempes,
social chairman at Phi Kappa
Sigma, has planned a com
plete Saturday program with
a luncheon for alumni and
Phi Kaps from Cal in the af
ternoon and an overnight
party at Big Sur lodge in Car
mel. Dave Whitehead, Muir
House president, is looking
forward to dinner at the
White Whale restaurant in
San Francisco to the music of
the Howard Fredricks Quar
tet.
Big Game Week 1067 offi
cially begins today! By next
Sunday the campus will have
witnessed six days and nights
of R.F.'s, dances, rallies, deco
rations competition, reunions,
movies, comedies, and a bon
fire — all culminating in the
big game itself and the festi
vities, parties, and orgies fol
lowing it.
While Cal has already
stolen our goalposts and made
a parity raid on one of the
coed houses in Stern, there
have been no reports yet of
Indian R.F.'s on the Berkeley
campus. The big question still
in everyone's mind is the lo
cation of the Axe.
Neil Okabayashi and mem
bers of the Axe Comm met
with Cal's Rally Comm Fri
day to discuss recovery of
the Axe. Neither Rally Comm
nor an assistant Cal dean ad
mitted any knowledge as to
the whereabouts of the Axe.
However, Okabayshi has re
ported Stanford presently
does have spies infiltrating the
Cal campus. He claimed, "We
have some very good ideas
about who stole it."
Both organizations are urg
ing their respective student
bodies to refrain from shoot
ing water balloons or using
sling shots during the game
Saturday. Last year this re
sulted In several chipped
teeth and other injuries.
Bury The Bear
A "Bury the Bear" rally
will be held Wednesday noon
on White Plaza. It is hoped
that a large crowd of Stan
ford students will see Oskl
laid to rest.
Over 400 freshmen have
signed up to participate in
Lake Lag's defense plan,
which begins today. Alex Mc-
Gilvray, chairman of bonfire
security, said that a loud
speaker system will be in
stalled and wallde talkies
given to guards in strategic

locations. There will be an
emergency siren system set
up in Wilbur in case guards
are ever outnumbered by Cal
raiders.
Young Boozer and Robin
Torrey, in charge of construc
tion and refreshments, plan to
start work on the bonfire at
7:00 a.m. Friday. Robin plans
to have the frosh dollies out
in force dispensing coffee,
hamburgers and donuts all
week to both the vigilant
freshman security teams and
the dauntless workers plan
ning to do the actual con
struction.
Concentric Rings
"Over 400 gallons of kero
sene will be poured on the
wood after construction is
completed Friday afternoon,"
stated freshman Adam Ben
noin. He is the frosh coordi
nator working under John
Arnold, a member of Cardi
nals Board, who is bonfire
chairman. Bennion added that
the bonfire will then be guard
ed in three concentric rings
totaling 350 people — includ
ing the frosh football team.
No one will then be allowed
to approach the lake until
6:30 Friday night, when a
pre-bonfire rally is slated to
begin.
Cardinals Board, a leading
service group at Stanford
composed of 13 juniors and
seniors, is responsible for to
tal organization of the bon
fire. John Arnold explained
this his group is responsible
for renting seven trucks
which will haul the wood, ob
taining a tractor, and secur
ing the telephone poles. The
wood was donated by
Pepsi Cola, Libby Fruit Com
pany, the Peninsula Cream
ery and various members of
the community.
Friday night there will be
a street dance on the lower
row financed by the Inter-Fra
ternity Council and co-spon
sored with Cardinals Board.

Cardinals Board is also in
charge of homecoming deco
rations competition. Chairman
Jim Massey stated that tro
phies will be awarded in five
areas: sweepstakes, anima
tion, humor, theme and origi
nality. The dorms, fraterni
ties, and other living groups
competing for the trophies
will be judged on Saturday
morning starting at 9:00 a.m.
Massey and Ron Nahas,
chairman of Cardinals Board,
agreed that "the decorations
should be quite novel this
year" because of the theme:
"Indians, Hang Bear Axe Ban
dits." They urge both stu
dents and alumni to tour the
campus Saturday morning to
view the decorations. Tro
phies will be awarded at half
time Saturday.
The Indians clash head-on
with the Bears at 1:30 Satur
day afternoon in Stanford
Stadium. It should be quite
a contest with Stanford's 54
record going against Cal's
4-5. A near-capacity crowd is
expected.

"Indians, Hang Bear Axe Ban
dits." They urge both stu
dents and alumni to tour the
campus Saturday morning to
view the decorations. Tro
phies will be awarded at half
time Saturday.
The Indians clash head-on
with the Bears at 1:30 Satur
day afternoon in Stanford
Stadium. It should be quite
a contest with Stanford's 54
record going against Cal's
4-5. A near-capacity crowd is
expected.
Many Celebrations
Following the game there
will be a number of celebra
tions both on and off campus.
The freshman • sponsored
party, The Induction, will be
held at Wilbur. It will feature
movies, light shows, and five
bands which will play until
3:00 a.m.
A number of fraternities
and dorms are planning off
campus frolics. Fred Tempes,
social chairman at Phi Kappa
Sigma, has planned a com
plete Saturday program with
a luncheon for alumni and
Phi Kaps from Cal in the af
ternoon and an overnight
party at Big Sur lodge in Car
mel. Dave Whitehead, Muir
House president, is looking
forward to dinner at the
White Whale restaurant in
San Francisco to the music of
the Howard Fredricks Quar
tet.
Big Game Week 1067 offi
cially begins today! By next
Sunday the campus will have
witnessed six days and nights
of R.F.'s, dances, rallies, deco
rations competition, reunions,
movies, comedies, and a bon
fire — all culminating in the
big game itself and the festi
vities, parties, and orgies fol
lowing it.
While Cal has already
stolen our goalposts and made
a parity raid on one of the
coed houses in Stern, there
have been no reports yet of
Indian R.F.'s on the Berkeley
campus. The big question still
in everyone's mind is the lo
cation of the Axe.
Neil Okabayashi and mem
bers of the Axe Comm met
with Cal's Rally Comm Fri
day to discuss recovery of
the Axe. Neither Rally Comm
nor an assistant Cal dean ad
mitted any knowledge as to
the whereabouts of the Axe.
However, Okabayshi has re
ported Stanford presently
does have spies infiltrating the
Cal campus. He claimed, "We
have some very good ideas
about who stole it."
Both organizations are urg
ing their respective student
bodies to refrain from shoot
ing water balloons or using
sling shots during the game
Saturday. Last year this re
sulted In several chipped
teeth and other injuries.
Bury The Bear
A "Bury the Bear" rally
will be held Wednesday noon
on White Plaza. It is hoped
that a large crowd of Stan
ford students will see Oskl
laid to rest.
Over 400 freshmen have
signed up to participate in
Lake Lag's defense plan,
which begins today. Alex Mc-
Gilvray, chairman of bonfire
security, said that a loud
speaker system will be in
stalled and wallde talkies
given to guards in strategic

locations. There will be an
emergency siren system set
up in Wilbur in case guards
are ever outnumbered by Cal
raiders.
Young Boozer and Robin
Torrey, in charge of construc
tion and refreshments, plan to
start work on the bonfire at
7:00 a.m. Friday. Robin plans
to have the frosh dollies out
in force dispensing coffee,
hamburgers and donuts all
week to both the vigilant
freshman security teams and
the dauntless workers plan
ning to do the actual con
struction.
Concentric Rings
"Over 400 gallons of kero
sene will be poured on the
wood after construction is
completed Friday afternoon,"
stated freshman Adam Ben
noin. He is the frosh coordi
nator working under John
Arnold, a member of Cardi
nals Board, who is bonfire
chairman. Bennion added that
the bonfire will then be guard
ed in three concentric rings
totaling 350 people — includ
ing the frosh football team.
No one will then be allowed
to approach the lake until
6:30 Friday night, when a
pre-bonfire rally is slated to
begin.
Cardinals Board, a leading
service group at Stanford
composed of 13 juniors and
seniors, is responsible for to
tal organization of the bon
fire. John Arnold explained
this his group is responsible
for renting seven trucks
which will haul the wood, ob
taining a tractor, and secur
ing the telephone poles. The
wood was donated by
Pepsi Cola, Libby Fruit Com
pany, the Peninsula Cream
ery and various members of
the community.
Friday night there will be
a street dance on the lower
row financed by the Inter-Fra
ternity Council and co-spon
sored with Cardinals Board.

Cardinals Board is also in
charge of homecoming deco
rations competition. Chairman
Jim Massey stated that tro
phies will be awarded in five
areas: sweepstakes, anima
tion, humor, theme and origi
nality. The dorms, fraterni
ties, and other living groups
competing for the trophies
will be judged on Saturday
morning starting at 9:00 a.m.
Massey and Ron Nahas,
chairman of Cardinals Board,
