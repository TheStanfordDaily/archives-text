## Daily SPORTS 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford water poloists clinch
ed the PAC-8 second spot as the
Indians shot down Cal, 10-5, at
Stanford last weekend. The
Cards face San Jose State Wed
nesday, 3:00 p.m. at the Encina
Pool in a "must game" to solidify
a national second ranking behind
UCLA.
The Stanford frosh traded the
lead with Cal's frosh four four
times before the Papooses surg
ed late in the last quarter to pin
down a 7-6 victory.
The Stanford varsity beat Cal,
94, early in the season, but since
that time the Bears beat USC
twice by more convincing mar
gins the Stanford did. Cal also
beat San Jose twice. Stanford
lost to San Jose in the Spartan's
abbreviated pool.
Things looked grim at the
start of the game when Cal's
Pan Am veteran Barry Weitzen
berg drew a penalty shot in front
of the Indian goal. Stanford
goalie Bob Momsen deflected the
shot with a smile.
Aggressive defense on both
sides gave each team a penalty
shot for ten personal fouls in
the first period. John Parker
broke the 1-1 tie as he climbed
out from underneath Cal's Jon
Shores to power an 8 yard shot
into the Cal goal.

The Indians exploded for four
goals in the second quarter while
the Bears couldn't break through
the Stanford defense. Gary
Sheerer zeroed in twice from 10
yards out and converted on a
penalty shot, and Mark Parmely
hit his first goal of the game.
Roll Out The Carpet
Pete Siebert started the sec
ond half as he fired a long bomb
past Cal's Tony Kajlich, former
ly Czechoslovakia's national
goalie. That gave the Cards a
7-1 lead. A Greg Buckingham lob
balanced a Cal penalty shot to
leave the count 8-2 in the last
period.
Cal collected three goals in
the fourth quarter. Parmely hit
his second score for Stanford,
and Doug Mac Lean took a pass
from Buckingham and slapped it
into the corner to leave the final
score 10-5.
Brick Welsh
The freshman game started
just like the varsity game. Goalie
Joe Welsh knocked a Cal pen
alty shot out of the pool.
Cal got on the scoreboard
first, and held a 3-2 lead at half
time. After repeated juggling of
the lead, the Cal frosh moved
ahead 6-5 with two minutes left.
Mitch Ivey hammered in his
third goal of the game to tie
the score and Brian Putman

tagged home the winning score
with less than a minute remain
ing.
Ken Terry and Ray Collins
stood out on defense for the Pa
pooses, stealing the ball more
than ten times between them.
Rick Eagleston, who scored once,
has dominated the sprints
throughout the season.
