# Tribe Wakes Up To Bag Ducks
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
Behind the running of Howie
Williams and the cheering of
Dean Ernest Arbuckle, the "red
hot" Stanford Indians made it
two in a row Saturday as they
downed the Oregon Ducks 17-14.
With regular Quarterback
Chuck Williams out with a knee
injury, southpaw Mark Mar
quess did a fine job in running
the Indian attack.
Marquess completed 6 out of
12 passes for 56 yards and
scored the winning touchdown
with a 2 yard scamper in the
fourth quarter.
Williams Carries Team
However, the Back of the
Game was sophomore halfback
Howie Williams, who had his
best day as a varsity perform
er. Williams gained 99 yards in
24 carries and was instrumental
in each Tribe scoring drive.
In a game that was devoid of
excitement until the last ten
minutes, the Indians made nu
merous mistakes. Fortunately
for the Tribe the Ducks were not
able to take advantage of the
errors.
Will Someone Please Score?
Neither team seemed very
anxious to score in the first half
A somniferous Stanford offense
was going nowhere, while the

Duck attack was going every
where except into the end zone.
Oregon blew two excellent
scoring opportunities. In the
first quarter they marched 96
yards to the Tribe one but were
held by a strong Stanford goal
line stand.
On the first play after the
Tribe regained possession on
their own one, Jack Root fum
bled and the Ducks recovered
on the nine.
Oregon proceeded to botch an-

other opportunity as three in
completed passes and a missed
field goal left the score at 0-0.
Stanford Obliges
The deadlock remained intact
until with 1:37 left in the half,
Marquess passed 18 yards to
Jim Cross for a touchdown to
climax a 69 yard drive. Bill
Shoemaker converted making it
7-0 Stanford.
Oregon, convinced that man
can indeed score, wasted no time
in tying it. Following a 47 yard
kickoff return by Claxton Welch,
Q.B. Eric Olsen hit Lefty Hen
drickson in the endzone to knot
the score 7-7 at halftime.
In the second half the Stan

ford defense tightened up and
contained the Oregon ground at
tack. Duck fullback Jim Even
son, who gained 89 yards in the
first half, was held to 11 in the
last two quarters.
Late in the third quarter the
Ducks managed to score, how
ever, after Howie Williams fum
bled a pitchout on the Card 35.
After the recovery, Olson
passed to end Steve Kantola,
who was awarded possession af
ter battling with Dick Oliver on
the 5. Three plays later Welch
slammed in from the one mak
ing it 14-7 Ducks.
Tribe Responds
Forced to play catch-up foot
ball, the Tribe responded in fine
fashion. Behind the running of
Williams they drove to the Ore
gon 23. On fourth down Shoe
maker booted a 41 yard field
goal to narrow the gap to 14-10.
On the first play following the
kickoff Stanford received its big
break of the game. Going off
tackle, Evenson was hit hard by
Marty Brill and Stu Kellner and
fumbled. Kellner recovered the
ball on Oregon's 17.
Marquess Scores
Williams promptly carried the
ball to the three with runs of 2
and 12 yards. On second and
goal Marquess fumbled the
snap but picked up the ball and
dashed in to score over left
tackle.
Shoemaker converted and the
17-14 score stood up for the final
seven minutes.
Oregon threatened mildly with
two minutes left, but Tribe line
backer Brill intercepted an Ol
sen pass on the Stanford 45 to
halt the final Duck drive.
Brill, who made 15 tackles in
addition to his interception, was
voted Lineman of the Game.

ing it 14-7 Ducks.
Tribe Responds
Forced to play catch-up foot
ball, the Tribe responded in fine
fashion. Behind the running of
Williams they drove to the Ore
gon 23. On fourth down Shoe
maker booted a 41 yard field
goal to narrow the gap to 14-10.
On the first play following the
kickoff Stanford received its big
break of the game. Going off
tackle, Evenson was hit hard by
Marty Brill and Stu Kellner and
fumbled. Kellner recovered the
ball on Oregon's 17.
Marquess Scores
Williams promptly carried the
ball to the three with runs of 2
and 12 yards. On second and
goal Marquess fumbled the
snap but picked up the ball and
dashed in to score over left
tackle.
Shoemaker converted and the
17-14 score stood up for the final
seven minutes.
Oregon threatened mildly with
two minutes left, but Tribe line
backer Brill intercepted an Ol
sen pass on the Stanford 45 to
halt the final Duck drive.
Brill, who made 15 tackles in
addition to his interception, was
voted Lineman of the Game.

UP IN THE AIR: Stanford split end Jim Cross (80), leaps In front of Oregon defensive halfback Jim
Smith (34), to snare a pass from Tribe quarterback Mark Marquess. Cross scored the first touchdown
of the game when he caught another pass from Marquess just inside the endzone retaining line. Mar
quess completed six of twelve passes, but the Indian emphasis was definitely on a running attack.
Behind the running of Howie
Williams and the cheering of
Dean Ernest Arbuckle, the "red
hot" Stanford Indians made it
two in a row Saturday as they
downed the Oregon Ducks 17-14.
With regular Quarterback
Chuck Williams out with a knee
injury, southpaw Mark Mar
quess did a fine job in running
the Indian attack.
Marquess completed 6 out of
12 passes for 56 yards and
scored the winning touchdown
with a 2 yard scamper in the
fourth quarter.
Williams Carries Team
However, the Back of the
Game was sophomore halfback
Howie Williams, who had his
best day as a varsity perform
er. Williams gained 99 yards in
24 carries and was instrumental
in each Tribe scoring drive.
In a game that was devoid of
excitement until the last ten
minutes, the Indians made nu
merous mistakes. Fortunately
for the Tribe the Ducks were not
able to take advantage of the
errors.
Will Someone Please Score?
Neither team seemed very
anxious to score in the first half
A somniferous Stanford offense
was going nowhere, while the

Duck attack was going every
where except into the end zone.
Oregon blew two excellent
scoring opportunities. In the
first quarter they marched 96
yards to the Tribe one but were
held by a strong Stanford goal
line stand.
On the first play after the
Tribe regained possession on
their own one, Jack Root fum
bled and the Ducks recovered
on the nine.
Oregon proceeded to botch an-

other opportunity as three in
completed passes and a missed
field goal left the score at 0-0.
Stanford Obliges
The deadlock remained intact
until with 1:37 left in the half,
Marquess passed 18 yards to
Jim Cross for a touchdown to
climax a 69 yard drive. Bill
Shoemaker converted making it
7-0 Stanford.
Oregon, convinced that man
can indeed score, wasted no time
in tying it. Following a 47 yard
kickoff return by Claxton Welch,
Q.B. Eric Olsen hit Lefty Hen
drickson in the endzone to knot
the score 7-7 at halftime.
In the second half the Stan

ford defense tightened up and
contained the Oregon ground at
tack. Duck fullback Jim Even
son, who gained 89 yards in the
first half, was held to 11 in the
last two quarters.
Late in the third quarter the
Ducks managed to score, how
ever, after Howie Williams fum
bled a pitchout on the Card 35.
After the recovery, Olson
passed to end Steve Kantola,
who was awarded possession af
ter battling with Dick Oliver on
the 5. Three plays later Welch
slammed in from the one mak
ing it 14-7 Ducks.
