# How Did We Look Today? Ralston: Very, Very Flat
## 
### NICK SELBY 
It isn't often that a player
asks a reporter the questions
after an athletic contest. Yet
after Stanford's narrow 17-14
win over Oregon Saturday, de
fensive halfback Dick Oliver
was doing just that.
Oliver's tired face showed ex
treme frustration when he ask
ed this reporter, "How do you
think we looked today?"
A few moments later, in a
room close to the football lack
ers in Encina Gym, Tribe coach
John Ralston answered the ques
tion for him.
"We were very flat today. We
didn't play well. We've been
sharp for the last four weeks
and I suppose we were due for
a bad performance. Fortunately,
we got out of the game without
it being too costly."
300 Per Cent Better
Ralston specified what he
meant. "We will have to play
300 per cent better to beat Cal
next week, maybe 500 per cent
better. I learned something to
day. In our practices this week,
I was lax in working on spirit
and we were stale this after
noon."
Ralston was careful not to
take anything away from Ore
gon's determined resistance. "We
may have been flat, but they
made sure we stayed flat."
"It sure feels good to be flat
and win for once," he concluded.
Can Williams Play?
A major question in Stanford
fans' minds is whether Chuck
Williams, who missed the Ore
gon game with a knee injury,
will be able to quarterback the
Cards against Cal. At present,
no one is sure he will or won't
be able to play.
Mark Marquess, the Indian
who handled the QB chores
against the Ducks, said he hoped
Williams would be able to play.
Marquess, perhaps the best
sportsman on the Stanford cam
pus, commented, "Chuck is a
senior and wants to play very
badly. I hope he gets to go."
Marquess' Problems
Ralston explained that part of
the lethargy of the Tribe of
fense was due to the change in
quarterbacks. He said the of
fense was used to Williams'
tempo after four games in a row
and that the change was bound
to affect something.
He also said that Marquess
may have been drifting too much
as he dropped back to pass.
"When a quarterback drifts
out, he doesn't give the block
ers time to set up protection.

Mark may have been throwing
off-balance as he drifted, and he
had to throw across the field a
lot," Ralston concluded.
Marquess scored the winning
touchdown on a keeper play
around left end. He fumbled the
snap, but calmly picked the ball
off the ground and scampered
in for six points.
"I was supposed to fake the
handoff and keep the ball, but I
pulled away too fast from center
and fumbled the ball. The line
kept the hole open for ages," he
explained.
To Rerun
Marquess also fired a touch
down pass to split end Jim
Cross. The play was used earlier
this season, when Chuck Wil
liams fired a long bomb to Bill
Shoemaker against UCLA.
The play calls for a fake to
fullback Jack Root, who is osten
sibly diving for a first down on
short yardage. The quarterback
then fades and throws the pass.
Cross explained that he was
worried about running out of
room. "The play is designed to
allow the receiver to run deep.
I had to curl across the end
zone to stay in bounds. Mark put
the ball right in my hands and
I just had to make sure my
feet were in."
Smith As Good As Clippings
Cross and his receiving part
ner flanker Gene Washington
had to face one of the confer
ence's best defensive backs, Jim
Smith. Both agreed that Smith
was everything his press clip
pings said he was.
"He's the best I've faced this
year," said Washington,"and
he's the best I'll meet next year."
Ralston said after the game
that Smith's presence in the Ore

gon secondary forced Stanford
to concentrate more on its run
ning game.
Williams Almost Scores
In going to the running game,
Stanford decided to put strength
against strength. The Indians
ran consistently right up the
middle at and through middle
guard George Dames, who had
been named Lineman of the
Game four times this year.
Spearheading this running at
tack was Howie Williams, who
rushed 24 times for 99 yards.
His ten yard run in the fourth
quarter set up the final score.
"I thought I might go all the
way on that one," said Williams.
"But my calfs tightened up and
I couldn't make it. I don't know
if (Jack) Root or (Greg) Brough
ton was the fullback, but who
ever it was, he threw a great
block to set me free."
Root, one of three Indian cap
tains, summed up the game:
"It wasn't a great team effort
for us. Next week, we'll get our
spirit up. The spirit won't come
from the coaches or captains;
it will come from the team as
a whole."
