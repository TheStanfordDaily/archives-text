## Berliner Cites Similarities 
### ROBIN KNIGHT 
Wolf • Ruediger (Roger to
Americans) Struck is one of
the halves that go to make up
the undergraduate exchange
program between Stanford and
the Free University of Berlin.
In Berlin at the moment is Rob
Robertson, a senior in psycho
logy. These scholarships are of
fered annually, and application
for the 1968-69 year must be
completed by Nov. 14th. Other
universities involved are Beirut
and Keio, Japan.
After six weeks at Stanford,
Roger Struck made some inter
esting comments when he spoke
to me yesterday morning. Uni
versities in West Germany are
all state run, and the outstand
ing difference is "the lack of a
community, campus life" in Ber
lin. The student there "is always
on his own. He's not backed up
by a living community, and so
he's much freer, and can act
more easily as an individual."
Despite the example of Oak
land, Herr Struck has found
nothing here to compare with
the student riots in Berlin this
summer. These concerned the
visit to the Shah of Iran, and
led to the death of one demon
strator, the resignation of the
Mayor of Berlin, and the prema
ture retirement of the police
chief. The demonstration "in
volved the whole student body"
in a way Oakland did not.
Greater Personal Freedom
The reason for this involve
ment, in Berlin, was that "the
student in Germany has much
more time 'for political activities.
He's not busy piling up 180 units
of credit. Exams are held an
nually, and what one does in
between them is largely a mat
ter of personal choice," Struck
commented. Asked if the rela

tionship between staff and stu
dents differed between Stanford
and Berlin, Struck was emphatic.
"In Berlin the professor are also
the administrators. So all the an
tagonism between staff and stu
dents, which at Stanford is di
rected at the administration, in
Berlin is aimed at your profes
sor."
At Stanford Roger Struck is
living with a fraternity, SAE,
which pays half his board and
room. The other half is paid
for by the Institute of Interna
tional Relations, whose spokes
man, George Sanborn, was en
thusiastic in his praise of the
exchange program. Stanford
pays tuition fees, and the lIR
provides spending money. All
the student is required to pro
vide is his travel fare. A similar
arrangement is organized for
the Stanford student going to
Berlin.
Living in a fraternity Struck
has quickly become aware of
the "you are an Indian" outlook.
This is quite a contrast to Ber
lin. So, too, is the introverted
character of Stanford, which
comes from being "so self-con
tained," and which "doesn't en
courage activity outside this
community." In general, Struck
commented, "students here are
not responsible for their own
lives in the same way that they
are when everyone lives off cam
pus."
Dating was not a problem —
but it was different. When I ask
ed him why, Struck replied, "Be
cause you have to pay for every
-thing. Girls here don't pay for
themselves," echoing a com
plaint often heard from those
in the bread-line community at
Stanford. He seemed to prefer
girls who had been to Europe,
because they were "more extro

verted than those that haven't
left the States."
Like most new students at
Stanford, Struck complained of
the lack of contact here. "They
need some sort of coffee-house
on campus where one can go to

meet people, and be entertained.
The only reason anyone goes to
Tresiddor is to eat, not to get
to know other people." The I-
Center, though it suffered from
the absence of Americans, was
the "only way many foreign stu
dents make any friends here."
He was surprised no one was
doing anything to attack this
problem.
Asked what he thought of the
States, Roger Struck emphasized
the informality of California.
Particularly he found student
attitudes to professors surpris
ing. "In Germany you'd never
go to a lecture where the stu
dents were so undressed, and
even sit with their shoes off
and their feet on the tables."
He'd also noticed a much great
er desire amongst Americans to
subordinate their private lives
in the interests of greater pers
onal prosperity. "Stanford is a
paradise for students," he went
on, and having visited Berkeley
recently he felt that that uni
versity was much more similar
to Berlin than was Stanford.
Anyone who is interested in
this exchange scholarship should
call George Sanborn (328-7239).
