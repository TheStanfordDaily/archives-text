# BSU: Don't Say 'Negro'
## Cal State Editor Threatened 
### 
Another college newspaper
has been threatened by members
of the Black Student Union.
Eight Negroes, claiming to
be members of the Black Stu
dent Union, marched in the of
fice of the student newspaper at
California State College at Los
Angeles, the Daily College
Times, last week and demanded
that editor David Shelburne stop
using the word "Negro" in
stories.
When Shelburne refused, an
African-robed spokesman for the
group told the editor he would
"face the political consequences
of your decision," according to
the campus public relations di
rector, Bob Lerner.
Last Monday, 12 young Ne
groes invaded the office of the
San Francisco State College

Gater and assaulted the editor,
two staff members, and a part
time journalism instructor.
The group included members
of the San Francisco State chap
ter of the Black Student Union.
After the Los Angeles threat,
campus police were ordered to
guard the Daily College Times
office, to prevent an incident
similar to that in San Francisco.
Los Angeles police department
officers were later called in to
supplement campus police.
The spokesman for the group,
who threatened editor Shelburne,
was identified by Lerner as An
thony C. Ashley, a senior socio
logy major, who prefers to be
called Ayuko Babu.
He demanded that the terms
"black" or "Afro-American" be
used instead of "Negro."
Ashley issued the threat when

Shelburne refused his demand,
stating that "Negro" was the
most common form used by
newspapers, as well as the gen
eral public.
Last Friday, six Negro youths
surrendered in the attack on the
San Francisco State Gater of
fice.
Three more of those accused
of the raid were supposed to sur
render over the weekend, accord
ing to Negro Democratic As
semblyman Willie Brown, the
group's lawyer, but there was
no report of this happening.
When the six surrendered, 25
students picketed the Hall of
Justice.
Also, a white picket line form
ed outside the (Jater office. Dean
of Students Fred Reddel said
that they were protesting poli
cies of editor Jim Vasko, but

was not sure of their complaints.
Vasko was hospitalized after
the attack Monday. He stated
the Negroes who invaded his
office had pulled the phone out
of his hand after he had asked
them to wait, and that he was
"kicked in the head and back
and punched."
He said that the Negroes ob
jected to the fact that the paper
identified the Black Student
Union as a "club," rather than
as an "organization."
Campus authorities said mem
bers of the BSU have been at
odds with the Gater for some
months, because the paper sup
posedly slanted or underplayed
news about Negroes.
They also stated that the BSU
complained about a delay in run
ning a picture of the Union's
homecoming queen candidate.
