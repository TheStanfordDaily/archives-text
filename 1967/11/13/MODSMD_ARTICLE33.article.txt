# Brecht Prod. To Open Soon
## 
### 
Undergraduate Production at
Stanford will present its first
feature, Bertholt Brecht's "Man
Is Man," at 8 p.m., Wednesday
in The Nitery. The play, directed
by Sheldon Feldner, will run
through Saturday, November 19.
Tickets are available by mail or
at the Tresidder Box Office, and
cost two dollars for general ad
mission and one dollar for stu
dents.
Feldner believes "Man Is Man"
is a direct comment on today,
in that the play describes the
moral and psychological disinte
gration of a soldier as he is
forced to join a machine-gun
crew.
The soldier, Galy Gay, be
comes what Feldner terms "a
desperately quiet killer who
pragmatically does his duty, but
becomes dehumanized in the
process." Gay eventually rejects
his own mild personality and
substitutes a killer's identity for
it.
Feldner's rehearsals are aimed
at instilling the personalities of
Brecht's characters in the
actors themselves. He urges
them to question each other in
a darkened room, like a "third
degree" sequence in a gangster
movie. They are also encouraged
to steal from each other without
being caught.
