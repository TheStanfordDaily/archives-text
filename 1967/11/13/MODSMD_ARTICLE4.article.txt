# Vigil Draws 2000 To Prayers, Discussions On Vietnam War
## 
### CLAUDIA WILKIN 
More than 2000 members of
the Stanford community took
part in a midnight worship ser
vice and all night convocation
for peace in Memorial Chuch
Saturday and Sunday.
The service of music, scrip
ture and a common meal was
led by B. Davie Napier, dean of
the chapel; Father John Duryea,
the campus Catholic minister;
and Episcopalian chaplain Lane
Barton.
The Convocation for Peace
began at 9 p.m. Saturday and
ended with a sunrise service at
6 a.m. Sunday.
The convocation, publicized as
an "opportunity for those con
cerned about Vietnam to spend
an evening together," was plan
ned by a group of twenty stu
dents, with the help of Napier
and his staff.
The evening included speak
ers, music, conversation, films,
slides, and the two worship
services. Dwight Clark, head of
Stanford's Volunteers in Asia,
Kit Anderton, last year's Pre-
Reg Comm chairman, senior
history major Henry Hooker,
junior history major John Trim
bur, and medical student Joe
Neal spoke of their experiences
as Volunteers in Asia, and Den
nis Sweeney, one of the leaders
of the Resistance, told of his
visit to the Prague Conference
with North Vietnamese officials.
Moral Costs
Charles Drekmeier, professor
of political science ,spoke on the
moral costs of the war. A film
about Vietnam, "The Time of
the Locust", was shown, as well
as slides of Vietnam.
Impromptu singing, with gui
tar and piano accompaniment,
and conversation characterized
th e unstructured night-long
vigil.
The midnight service began
with the playing of "Universal
Soldier" and "Sounds of Si
lence" in the darkened church.
After candles were lit in the

front and center aisles, and the
Mendicants sang the Introit,
Napier gave an introduction to
the service.
"Let no one be turned off by
the sound of another's cultic
language. In sharing light and
love, and bread and wine, we
testify in sorrow to our broken
ness and our common need; and
in joy to our common humanity
and common hope that we may
yet live in this world as men,"
he said.
Passing Peace
ASSU President Peter Lyman
then gave the Call to Worship,
which was followed by singing
by the Memorial Church choir,
the passing of the peace by
handshakes, and prayers of in
tercession and thanksgiving.
"The Traditional Word," six

selections from the Old Testa
ment, was read by students
standing in various parts of the
church. "The Contemporary
Word" consisted of a talk by
Napier.
The high point of the service
was the consecration of bread
and wine by Father Duryea and
the Rev. Mr. Barton, and the
common meal. Nearly everyone
in the church came forward to
receive small glasses of wine
and to share pieces of bread.
During the meal, the choir,
the Mendicants, and several
barefoot guitarists sitting on
the altar steps led in singing
folk songs, such as Kum Bah
Yah and Michael.
"I don't think anything like
this has ever happened on a
University campus," Napier

said. "I think this is a tribute
to Stanford. It was a joyous
celebration, with people singing
and having fun."
Father Duryea commented,
"It makes me feel wonderful
that people feel strongly enough
about Vietnam to come at mid
night and participate in a reli
gious service, although some of
them may have no religious
feelings."
At the beginning of the eve
ning, about 850 people were
present. Napier played the piano
in the Round Room of the
church, and coffee and cookies
were served.
Clark, the first speaker, pre
sented his talk in the main
church. He called the recent
South Vietnamese elections a
fraud, and said Americans in
Vietnam are tainted by the CIA
image.
The other speakers from Vol
unteers in Asia spoke inform
ally in the Round Room on their
experiences in Vietnam. They
emphasized the role the CIA

was playing in the towns they
worked in.
In his talk on the moral costs
of the war, Drekmeier argued
"the actions by France and the
United States in Vietnam have
been the major impediment to
the realization of self-determin
ation and independence."

The major moral cost of the
war is the "virtual abandon
ment of programs to improve
the lot of poorer citizens" in the
United States, Drekmeier said.
He pointed out the cost of one
Polaris submarine would pay
for 331 elementary schools, or
13,700 low-cost housing units;
the Great Society poverty pro
grams are budgeted for less
each year than the Vietnam war
is costing each month.
Bombs Maim
The damage being done to the
civilian population of Vietnam
is another moral cost of the
war, according to Drekmeier.
Although it is said the United
States is bombing only military
targets, there is increasing use
of anti-personnel bombs which
rarely kill, but severely maim,
he said.

After the midnight service,
which followed Drekmeier's
talk, some people stayed in the
main church to watch movies
and slides, others went to the
Round Room or outside to sing,
talk or sleep. Students passed
out free coffee and cookies.
At 6 a.m., the 150 people pres
ent lit candles and walked in
procession out of Memorial
Church. The sunrise service out
side was planned by the campus
Presbyterian and Methodist
ministers as a service of "ador
ation and praise, confession and
judgment, and silence."
Participants read from the
Bible and the poetry of Law
rence Ferlinghetti, then sang,
and voiced their spontaneous re
actions to the peace vigil. At
7 a.m., free orange juice and
doughnuts were served, and the
vigil ended.

Neal spoke of their experiences
as Volunteers in Asia, and Den
nis Sweeney, one of the leaders
of the Resistance, told of his
visit to the Prague Conference
with North Vietnamese officials.
Moral Costs
Charles Drekmeier, professor
of political science ,spoke on the
moral costs of the war. A film
about Vietnam, "The Time of
the Locust", was shown, as well
as slides of Vietnam.
Impromptu singing, with gui
tar and piano accompaniment,
and conversation characterized
th e unstructured night-long
vigil.
The midnight service began
with the playing of "Universal
Soldier" and "Sounds of Si
lence" in the darkened church.
After candles were lit in the

front and center aisles, and the
Mendicants sang the Introit,
Napier gave an introduction to
the service.
"Let no one be turned off by
the sound of another's cultic
language. In sharing light and
love, and bread and wine, we
testify in sorrow to our broken
ness and our common need; and
in joy to our common humanity
and common hope that we may
yet live in this world as men,"
he said.
Passing Peace
ASSU President Peter Lyman
then gave the Call to Worship,
which was followed by singing
by the Memorial Church choir,
the passing of the peace by
handshakes, and prayers of in
tercession and thanksgiving.
"The Traditional Word," six

selections from the Old Testa
ment, was read by students
standing in various parts of the
church. "The Contemporary
Word" consisted of a talk by
Napier.
The high point of the service
was the consecration of bread
and wine by Father Duryea and
the Rev. Mr. Barton, and the
common meal. Nearly everyone
in the church came forward to
receive small glasses of wine
and to share pieces of bread.
During the meal, the choir,
the Mendicants, and several
barefoot guitarists sitting on
the altar steps led in singing
folk songs, such as Kum Bah
Yah and Michael.
"I don't think anything like
this has ever happened on a
University campus," Napier

said. "I think this is a tribute
to Stanford. It was a joyous
celebration, with people singing
and having fun."
Father Duryea commented,
"It makes me feel wonderful
that people feel strongly enough
about Vietnam to come at mid
night and participate in a reli
gious service, although some of
them may have no religious
feelings."
At the beginning of the eve
ning, about 850 people were
present. Napier played the piano
in the Round Room of the
church, and coffee and cookies
were served.
Clark, the first speaker, pre
sented his talk in the main
church. He called the recent
South Vietnamese elections a
fraud, and said Americans in
Vietnam are tainted by the CIA
image.
The other speakers from Vol
unteers in Asia spoke inform
ally in the Round Room on their
experiences in Vietnam. They
emphasized the role the CIA

was playing in the towns they
worked in.
In his talk on the moral costs
of the war, Drekmeier argued
"the actions by France and the
United States in Vietnam have
been the major impediment to
the realization of self-determin
ation and independence."

The major moral cost of the
war is the "virtual abandon
ment of programs to improve
the lot of poorer citizens" in the
United States, Drekmeier said.
He pointed out the cost of one
Polaris submarine would pay
for 331 elementary schools, or
13,700 low-cost housing units;
the Great Society poverty pro
grams are budgeted for less
each year than the Vietnam war
is costing each month.
Bombs Maim
The damage being done to the
civilian population of Vietnam
is another moral cost of the
war, according to Drekmeier.
Although it is said the United
States is bombing only military
targets, there is increasing use
of anti-personnel bombs which
rarely kill, but severely maim,
he said.

After the midnight service,
which followed Drekmeier's
talk, some people stayed in the
main church to watch movies
and slides, others went to the
Round Room or outside to sing,
talk or sleep. Students passed
out free coffee and cookies.
At 6 a.m., the 150 people pres
ent lit candles and walked in
procession out of Memorial
Church. The sunrise service out
side was planned by the campus
Presbyterian and Methodist
ministers as a service of "ador
ation and praise, confession and
judgment, and silence."
Participants read from the
Bible and the poetry of Law
rence Ferlinghetti, then sang,
and voiced their spontaneous re
actions to the peace vigil. At
7 a.m., free orange juice and
doughnuts were served, and the
vigil ended.

the lot of poorer citizens" in the
United States, Drekmeier said.
He pointed out the cost of one
Polaris submarine would pay
for 331 elementary schools, or
13,700 low-cost housing units;
the Great Society poverty pro
grams are budgeted for less
each year than the Vietnam war
is costing each month.
Bombs Maim
The damage being done to the
civilian population of Vietnam
is another moral cost of the
war, according to Drekmeier.
Although it is said the United
States is bombing only military
targets, there is increasing use
of anti-personnel bombs which
rarely kill, but severely maim,
he said.

After the midnight service,
which followed Drekmeier's
talk, some people stayed in the
main church to watch movies
and slides, others went to the
Round Room or outside to sing,
talk or sleep. Students passed
out free coffee and cookies.
At 6 a.m., the 150 people pres
ent lit candles and walked in
procession out of Memorial
Church. The sunrise service out

Presbyterian and Methodist
ministers as a service of "ador

COMMUNAL MEAL — Part of the crowd of 2000 come to the foot
of the chaneel in Mem. Chu. to partake of the bread and wine.
More than 2000 members of
the Stanford community took
part in a midnight worship ser
vice and all night convocation
for peace in Memorial Chuch
Saturday and Sunday.
The service of music, scrip
ture and a common meal was
led by B. Davie Napier, dean of
the chapel; Father John Duryea,
the campus Catholic minister;
and Episcopalian chaplain Lane
Barton.
The Convocation for Peace
began at 9 p.m. Saturday and
ended with a sunrise service at
6 a.m. Sunday.
The convocation, publicized as
an "opportunity for those con
cerned about Vietnam to spend
an evening together," was plan
ned by a group of twenty stu
dents, with the help of Napier
and his staff.
The evening included speak
ers, music, conversation, films,
slides, and the two worship
services. Dwight Clark, head of
Stanford's Volunteers in Asia,
Kit Anderton, last year's Pre-
Reg Comm chairman, senior
history major Henry Hooker,
junior history major John Trim
bur, and medical student Joe
Neal spoke of their experiences
as Volunteers in Asia, and Den
nis Sweeney, one of the leaders
of the Resistance, told of his
visit to the Prague Conference
with North Vietnamese officials.
Moral Costs
Charles Drekmeier, professor
of political science ,spoke on the
moral costs of the war. A film
about Vietnam, "The Time of
the Locust", was shown, as well
as slides of Vietnam.
Impromptu singing, with gui
tar and piano accompaniment,
and conversation characterized
th e unstructured night-long
vigil.
The midnight service began
with the playing of "Universal
Soldier" and "Sounds of Si
lence" in the darkened church.
After candles were lit in the

front and center aisles, and the
Mendicants sang the Introit,
Napier gave an introduction to
the service.
"Let no one be turned off by
the sound of another's cultic
language. In sharing light and
love, and bread and wine, we
testify in sorrow to our broken
ness and our common need; and
in joy to our common humanity
and common hope that we may
yet live in this world as men,"
he said.
Passing Peace
ASSU President Peter Lyman
then gave the Call to Worship,
which was followed by singing
by the Memorial Church choir,
the passing of the peace by
handshakes, and prayers of in
tercession and thanksgiving.
"The Traditional Word," six

selections from the Old Testa
ment, was read by students
standing in various parts of the
church. "The Contemporary
Word" consisted of a talk by
Napier.
The high point of the service
was the consecration of bread
and wine by Father Duryea and
the Rev. Mr. Barton, and the
common meal. Nearly everyone
in the church came forward to
receive small glasses of wine
and to share pieces of bread.
During the meal, the choir,
the Mendicants, and several
barefoot guitarists sitting on
the altar steps led in singing
folk songs, such as Kum Bah
Yah and Michael.
"I don't think anything like
this has ever happened on a
University campus," Napier

said. "I think this is a tribute
to Stanford. It was a joyous
celebration, with people singing
and having fun."
Father Duryea commented,
"It makes me feel wonderful
that people feel strongly enough
about Vietnam to come at mid
night and participate in a reli
gious service, although some of
them may have no religious
feelings."
At the beginning of the eve
ning, about 850 people were
present. Napier played the piano
in the Round Room of the
church, and coffee and cookies
were served.
Clark, the first speaker, pre
sented his talk in the main
church. He called the recent
South Vietnamese elections a
fraud, and said Americans in
Vietnam are tainted by the CIA
image.

Father Duryea commented,
"It makes me feel wonderful
that people feel strongly enough
about Vietnam to come at mid
night and participate in a reli
gious service, although some of
them may have no religious
feelings."
At the beginning of the eve
ning, about 850 people were
present. Napier played the piano
in the Round Room of the
church, and coffee and cookies
were served.
Clark, the first speaker, pre
sented his talk in the main
church. He called the recent
South Vietnamese elections a
fraud, and said Americans in
Vietnam are tainted by the CIA
image.
The other speakers from Vol
unteers in Asia spoke inform
ally in the Round Room on their
experiences in Vietnam. They
emphasized the role the CIA

was playing in the towns they
worked in.
In his talk on the moral costs
of the war, Drekmeier argued
"the actions by France and the
United States in Vietnam have
been the major impediment to
the realization of self-determin
ation and independence."

The major moral cost of the
war is the "virtual abandon
ment of programs to improve
the lot of poorer citizens" in the
United States, Drekmeier said.
He pointed out the cost of one
Polaris submarine would pay
for 331 elementary schools, or
13,700 low-cost housing units;
the Great Society poverty pro
grams are budgeted for less
each year than the Vietnam war
is costing each month.
Bombs Maim
The damage being done to the
civilian population of Vietnam
is another moral cost of the
war, according to Drekmeier.
Although it is said the United
States is bombing only military
targets, there is increasing use
of anti-personnel bombs which
rarely kill, but severely maim,
he said.

After the midnight service,
which followed Drekmeier's
talk, some people stayed in the
main church to watch movies
and slides, others went to the
Round Room or outside to sing,
talk or sleep. Students passed
out free coffee and cookies.
At 6 a.m., the 150 people pres
ent lit candles and walked in
procession out of Memorial
Church. The sunrise service out
side was planned by the campus
Presbyterian and Methodist
ministers as a service of "ador
ation and praise, confession and
judgment, and silence."
Participants read from the
Bible and the poetry of Law
rence Ferlinghetti, then sang,
and voiced their spontaneous re
actions to the peace vigil. At
7 a.m., free orange juice and
doughnuts were served, and the
vigil ended.
