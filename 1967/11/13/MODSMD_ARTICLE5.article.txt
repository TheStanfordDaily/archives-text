# Computer Committee Large Part Of SES

### HERBERT TERRY 
What SES staff director Rob
ert Hind has termed "almost an
accident" is now the largest sub
committee of the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford (SES).
The Subcommittee on Compu
ter Problems, which now in
cludes 23 faculty and three stu
dent members, began formal
study last week of the relation
ships between Stanford and ex
panding computer technology.
According to Hind, a subcom
mittee on computers was not
proposed during last year's or
ganization of SES.
It gained its "accidental na
ture" because it was formed dur
ing the summer after members
of the Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science Depart
ments expressed "concern over
the computer both as a tool for
education and as a subject about
which people should be edu
cated," said Hind.
Since the Aug. 9 organization
the subcommittee has grown
rapidly as members from di
verse fields have been included
in its deliberations. This, accord
ing to Hind, is a reflection of
"the immense importance of the
computer in a modern univer
sity."
Lederb*'rff Leads
Headed by nobel lauriate Josh
ua Lederberg, Head of the De
partment of Genetics, the com
mittee includes members of the

Civil Engineering, Communica
tions, Computer Science, Educa
tion, Electrical Engineering, In
dustrial Engineering, Math, Mod
ern European Languages, Mu
sic, Political Science, Psychology
and Religion Departments.
Also represented are the Law
School, Library and SLAC. Stu
dent members of the subcommit
tee are Susan Ott, sophomore in
mathematics; Charles Blitzer,
graduate student in economics
and Charles Tidd of the Gradu
ate School of Business.
The Oct. 30 statement of ob
jectives issued by the SES Steer
ing Committee suggested a plan
which will be investigated by
the computer subcommittee.
The Steering Committee said,
"It may be that an entirely new
introductory course dealing with

mathematical logic as it relates
to computation . . . will provide,
for students who do not plan to
go in science or technology,
some understanding of the
changes being wrought in many
disciplines and in society as a
whole by recent advances in
computer capabilities."
Students Short-Changed?
At least some members of the
subcommittee, however, object
to the suggestion that this "new
introductory course" be used as
a replacement for current Gen
eral Studies mathematics re
quirements.
"I don't believe in requiring
any course of any student . . .
but I think that any student who
doesn't become informed about
computers simewhere in his
