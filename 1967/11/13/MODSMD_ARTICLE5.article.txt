# Computer Committee Large Part Of SES
## 
### HERBERT TERRY 
What SES staff director Rob
ert Hind has termed "almost an
accident" is now the largest sub
committee of the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford (SES).
The Subcommittee on Compu
ter Problems, which now in
cludes 23 faculty and three stu
dent members, began formal
study last week of the relation
ships between Stanford and ex
panding computer technology.
According to Hind, a subcom
mittee on computers was not
proposed during last year's or
ganization of SES.
It gained its "accidental na
ture" because it was formed dur
ing the summer after members
of the Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science Depart
ments expressed "concern over
the computer both as a tool for
education and as a subject about
which people should be edu
cated," said Hind.
Since the Aug. 9 organization
the subcommittee has grown
rapidly as members from di
verse fields have been included
in its deliberations. This, accord
ing to Hind, is a reflection of
"the immense importance of the
computer in a modern univer
sity."
Lederb*'rff Leads
Headed by nobel lauriate Josh
ua Lederberg, Head of the De
partment of Genetics, the com
mittee includes members of the

Civil Engineering, Communica
tions, Computer Science, Educa
tion, Electrical Engineering, In
dustrial Engineering, Math, Mod
ern European Languages, Mu
sic, Political Science, Psychology
and Religion Departments.
Also represented are the Law
School, Library and SLAC. Stu
dent members of the subcommit
tee are Susan Ott, sophomore in
mathematics; Charles Blitzer,
graduate student in economics
and Charles Tidd of the Gradu
ate School of Business.
The Oct. 30 statement of ob
jectives issued by the SES Steer
ing Committee suggested a plan
which will be investigated by
the computer subcommittee.
The Steering Committee said,
"It may be that an entirely new
introductory course dealing with

mathematical logic as it relates
to computation . . . will provide,
for students who do not plan to
go in science or technology,
some understanding of the
changes being wrought in many
disciplines and in society as a
whole by recent advances in
computer capabilities."
Students Short-Changed?
At least some members of the
subcommittee, however, object
to the suggestion that this "new
introductory course" be used as
a replacement for current Gen
eral Studies mathematics re
quirements.
"I don't believe in requiring
any course of any student . . .
but I think that any student who
doesn't become informed about
computers simewhere in his
college education is getting ter
ribly short-changed," said Rich
ard Atkinson, member of the
subcommittee and Professor of
Psychology and Education.
Members of the subcommittee
have expressed a variety of rea
sons for participation in the
study. Robert Mac Afee Brown,
Professor of Religion, thinks in
terms of "not being scared about
computers but rather seeing
what they can do for the whole
state of man."
"I'm primarily concerned to
see how we can put this incredi
ble breakthroughs to the use of
man," he said.
Committee Divides
The committee will, because of

its large size and the broad
scope of its inquiry, divide into
five study groups. Associate
Professor of Communications
Edwin B. Parker said, "The only
way you can work with a com
mittee of this size is to break
it up and carefully deliniate
tasks."
The study groups will investi
gate computerized instruction,
libraries, academic organization
of computer studies, manage
ment structure and inter-univer
sity cooperation.
Students may attend the de
liberations of the Subcommittee
on Computer Problems, but
must first make a written re
quest to Hind.

The Oct. 30 statement of ob
jectives issued by the SES Steer
ing Committee suggested a plan
which will be investigated by
the computer subcommittee.
The Steering Committee said,
"It may be that an entirely new
introductory course dealing with

mathematical logic as it relates
to computation . . . will provide,
for students who do not plan to
go in science or technology,
some understanding of the
changes being wrought in many
disciplines and in society as a
whole by recent advances in
computer capabilities."
Students Short-Changed?
At least some members of the
subcommittee, however, object
to the suggestion that this "new
introductory course" be used as
a replacement for current Gen
eral Studies mathematics re
quirements.
"I don't believe in requiring
any course of any student . . .
but I think that any student who
doesn't become informed about
computers simewhere in his
college education is getting ter
ribly short-changed," said Rich
ard Atkinson, member of the
subcommittee and Professor of
Psychology and Education.
Members of the subcommittee
have expressed a variety of rea
sons for participation in the
study. Robert Mac Afee Brown,
Professor of Religion, thinks in
terms of "not being scared about
computers but rather seeing
what they can do for the whole
state of man."
"I'm primarily concerned to
see how we can put this incredi
ble breakthroughs to the use of
man," he said.
Committee Divides
The committee will, because of

its large size and the broad
scope of its inquiry, divide into
five study groups. Associate
Professor of Communications
Edwin B. Parker said, "The only
way you can work with a com
mittee of this size is to break
it up and carefully deliniate
tasks."
The study groups will investi
gate computerized instruction,
libraries, academic organization
of computer studies, manage
ment structure and inter-univer
sity cooperation.
Students may attend the de
liberations of the Subcommittee
on Computer Problems, but
must first make a written re
quest to Hind.
What SES staff director Rob

accident" is now the largest sub
committee of the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford (SES).
The Subcommittee on Compu
ter Problems, which now in
cludes 23 faculty and three stu
dent members, began formal
study last week of the relation
ships between Stanford and ex
panding computer technology.
According to Hind, a subcom
mittee on computers was not
proposed during last year's or
ganization of SES.
It gained its "accidental na
ture" because it was formed dur
ing the summer after members
of the Electrical Engineering
and Computer Science Depart
ments expressed "concern over
the computer both as a tool for
education and as a subject about
which people should be edu
cated," said Hind.
Since the Aug. 9 organization
the subcommittee has grown
rapidly as members from di
verse fields have been included
in its deliberations. This, accord
ing to Hind, is a reflection of
"the immense importance of the
computer in a modern univer
sity."
