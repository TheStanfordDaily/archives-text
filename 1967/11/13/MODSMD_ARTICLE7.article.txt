# Hearing Dates Set For CIA Sitters-In
## 
### 
Judicial Council hearings for
the nine students indicted for
violations at the Nov. 1 demon
stration against Central Intelli
gence Agency (CIA) campus re
'cruiting are tentatively sche
duled for next Monday.
The Council will meet this
evening to consider election ir
regularity charges from last
week's cheerleader voting. The
demonstrators' cases will not
come up since the Council has
not had enough time to collect
evidence, according John Raskin,
chairman.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
stated over the weekend that
there is a "good possibility" that
disciplinary action will be sought
against several more demonstra
tors later in the week.
At least one other demonstra
tor, Yale Braunstein, expects to

be charged within the next few
days. He was told by Associate
Dean Bill Wyman that he would
receive a letter charging him for
the same offense that the other
nine have been indicted.
The nine students were charg
ed with violating University
demonstration policy after block
ing the entrance to Encina Hall,
where the recruiting took place.
"We will not hear the case
this week because we have not
given the defendants enough
time to prepare," Raskin ex
plained.
"Also, we want to talk to the
defendants to find out whether
or not they want an open hear
ing, to obtain a chronology of
events from Dean Smith, and to
talk to other people who were
at the demonstration," Raskin
added.
