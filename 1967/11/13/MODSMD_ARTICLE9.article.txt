# Elect McCloskey
## 
### 
A political campaign of national importance
has emerged just the other side of the San Fran
cisquito Creek.
San Mateo County elects its Congressman to
morrow in the only contest for a House seat this
season in the country. It is being watched.
Political schemers in both parties will attach
to this election, as they do to a New Hampshire
primary, far more importance than it deserves.
This presents a meaningful opportunity to
those of us in anguish at a dirty war which muti
lates—as wars will do—both the antagonist and
the antagonized.
The San Mateo election will bear on national
politics in a way that Proposition P never could,
for two reasons. First, it has the concrete effect
of putting a man in office. By implication, it sug
gests whom the voters might very well put out of
office in 1^)68.
Second, the election has brought forward
eleven candidates, whose range of conviction al
lows a better choice than San Francisco's hard
nosed proposition.
One of the candidates, Paul N. McCloskey,
has been unusual in a field which includes a re
tired jockey and the County Sheriff who plies his
trade in East Palo Alto. He has presented him
self sensibly and comported himself well. We
strongly urge his election.
McCloskey is a graduate of Stanford and of
the Stanford Law School. As a lieutenant-colonel
in the Marines, he won the Navy Cross and the
Silver Star in Korea.
On Vietnam, he urges a stepped military de
escalation, to be coordinated with negotiations
considering the country unified.
He is sanguine, and realistic, to say that this
may result in a Communist government. Insist
ence on treating the country as two segments,
he contends, has been the chief bar to negotia
tions as well as a violation of the Geneva accords.
Coming from an attractive young candidate
who is a certified war hero and a firm Republi
can, this is heady stuff indeed. His election could
shake some sense into many of his party's lead
ers, who appear not to have learned anything
from the 1964 disaster.
Two other candidates should be mentioned.
It will not do to dismiss Shirley Temple Black
as a fractured flicker. Her statements, while re
maining obdurate and reactionary, have im
proved in quality over the campaign. This is an
index of her advisers' energies, and of how much
needed to be done.

Her public declamations have been all too in
structive:
"I think it's time for the Moms and Pops of
America to take Big Brother to the woodshed
and remind him who is running things," (Oct.
23.)
"How can you say, 'stop the bombing' when a
case can be made that it hasn't really started."
(Last Friday.)
A campaign letter she distributed through the
County alleged that McCloskey advocated the
extermination of one and a half million Vietna
mese, should a Communist government come to
power. What he said, according to the Palo Alto
Times, was that this number of people might
have to be offered sanctuary elsewhere.
"Little Miss Hawk," as The Economist of Lon
don called her, should not be brushed aside for
the immaturity of her declamations. The mea
sure of our energies should be the travesty that
would be her election. And the boost it would be
to a likewise theatrical Governor.
Edward Keating, another candidate, has
spoken out more firmly but less convincingly
than McCloskey against the war. His solution
involves this country calling an international
conference and agreeing to abide by its decision.
Former publisher of Ramparts, Keating ran
unsuccessfully 'against Mark Sullivan in the
Democratic primary two years ago. Sullivan in
turn lost to J. Arthur Younger, Republican,
whose death vacated the seat to be filled to
morrow.
We urge those who would support Keating
as a first choice to vote for McCloskey in this
primary election.
The curious election procedure is that if any
candidate receives a majority, he is declared the
winner. Otherwise, those with the highest vote
in each party will runoff on Dec. 12.
The crucial question appears to be who will
win among the Republicans. We anticipate that
a runoff would be won by the Republican in any
case. Thus, the electoral system is an invitation
to Democrats to help their Republican brethren
make a decision.
This is especially important, since the winner
of this election will be an example to his own
party. While both parties need the lesson, the
Democrats, for 1968, appear beyond salvation.
To members of both parties in the Eleventh
Congressional District, we reiterate the strong
est support for Paul McCloskey in tomorrow's
election. M.C.
