Half-price to
college students and
faculty:
the newspaper that
newspaper people
read. . .
At last count, we hud more than 3,800 news
paper editors on our list of subscribers to The
Christian Science Monitor. Editors from all
over the world.
There is a good reason why these "pros" read
the Monitor: the Monitor is the world's only
daily international newspaper. Unlike local
papers, the Monitor focuses exclusively on
world news — the important news.
The Monitor selects the news it considers
most significant and reports it, interprets it,
analyzes it —in depth. It takes you further into
the news than any local paper can.
If this is the kind of paper you would like to
be reading, we will send it to you right away at
half the regular price of $24.00 a year.
Clip the coupon. Find out why newspaper
men themselves read the Monitor — and why
they invariably name it as one of the five best
papers in the world.
