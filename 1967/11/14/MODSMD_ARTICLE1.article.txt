# Charges Fly, San Mateo Voters To Decide Today
## 
### TOM DAWSON 
The only congressional elec
tion in the country this year will
be held today in San Mateo
County. It is the culmination of
a campaign highlighted by the
candidacy of former child movie
star Shirley Temple Black and
sharp debate on the Vietnam
war.
Today's voting will be an open
primary. If none of the four
Republican, six Democratic, and
one Independent candidates re
ceives 51 per cent of the vote,
there will be a runoff election
between the top Republican and
Democratic vote getters Decem
ber 12.
A recent exchange of charges
between Mrs. Black and her
main Republican rival, Paul N.
"Pete" McCloskey has enlivened
the campaign.
McCloskey has advocated a
policy of gradual withdrawal
from Vietnam. He favors the
expatriation of our South Viet
namese allies in case of Com
munist takeover.

Mrs. Black is in favor of in
creased military pr ess u r e
against North Vietnam, and
some of her backers last week
charged McCloskey with advo
cating a policy that would "con
sign more than a million and a
half of our South Vietnamese
allies to the threat of extinction
—a slaughter unparalleled since
the days of Nazi Germany."
McCloskey responded by fil
ing a complaint with the Na
tional Fair Campaign Practices
Committee charging the Black
camp with "preaching fear, hate
and anger."
In all there are ten candidates
to fill the seat of the late J.
Arthur Younger, a Republican
who represented the district for
15 years.
Mrs. Black Favored
Mrs. Black is generally con
sidered the favorite, but three
other Republicans and three
Democrats are all given chances
in the open primary.
Besides Mrs. Black and Pete
McCloskey, the other Republi

can candidates are Earl B. Whit
more, Sheriff of San Mateo
County, and William Draper
111, a business consultant..
The Democrats include Ed
ward N. Keating, former pub
lisher of Ramparts magazine,
Daniel J. Monaco, a past Demo
cratic County Central Commit
tee chairman, and Roy Archi
bald, an official of the National
Education Association.
Stanford graduate McCloskey
favors a modified version of the
enclave theory first proposed by
retired Lieutenant General
James M. Gavin.
Mrs. Black, 39-year-old Wood
side mother of three, is best
known as the former curly-hair
ed child movie star of the 1930'5.
Sheriff Whitmore has held his
post for the last 16 years and is
considered a supporter of the
war in Vietnam. He has been
consistently returned to office
with 75 per cent majorities.
William Draper's campaign
has been picking up momentum
lately after the widow of Con

gressman Younger endorsed him
to fill her late husband's seat.
He too is considered a hawk on
Vietnam.
Three Democrats
Daniel Monaco also toured
South Vietnam recently and con
siders himself a "hawk." He
wants an end to the bombing
of North Vietnam and would
call in "any . . . agency sincerely
interested in achieving peace."
Edward Keating, also a Stan
ford graduate, feels that the war
"is without just cause."
He also has questioned the
Vietnam war, asking, "Why
should a war on poverty be
fought with popguns while a
war in Vietnam bombs billions
away into a jungle?"
The other major Democratic
candidate is Roy Archibald. He
is a former Washington lobbyist
for the National Education As
sociation, and is now their senior
executive in the west. He empha
sizes bringing more Federal mon
ey and talent to bear on local
problems.
Two-Way Race
Many political observers feel
that the race will boil down to a
contest between McCloskey and
Mrs. Black. Mrs. Black has ac
cused McCloskey of being a
Democrat and has refused to de
bate other Republicans in the
interest of "party unity."
Last Friday night Mrs. Black
had a debate with four of her
Democratic opponents. Vietnam
was the main issue though other
topics were also discussed.
Concerning the marijuana
problem Mrs. Black stated, "If
a pusher is arrested, he should
be imprisoned and we should
throw away the key."

(Candidates McCloskey and Keating have both spoken on the Stanford campus during the past few
weeks. Mrs. Shirley Temple Black's position a»s the early favorite had faded during the past week, ac
cording to some observers.)
