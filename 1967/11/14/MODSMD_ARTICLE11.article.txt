By NORMAN S. GIDDAN
(An imaginary conversation)
P: Professor S: Student
P. Sorry to see that the CIA
demonstration didn't work
out as planned.
S. It wasn't a demonstration. It
was an attempt to shut off
the CIA interviewer and if
some fence-sitting liberals
over 30 like you had been
there it could have been more
effective.
P. We do care and are concern
ed but this kind of political
activism is not "our thing"
as you younger people term
it. Besides, the CIA should
be here and so should every
other employer or organiza
tion which is primarily for
students' use or composed of
students.
S. Rights and privacy and these
kinds of freedom are irrele
vant — you old guys got to
get it through your heads
that to fight the whole cor
rupt System POWER is the
only answer — we can't vote
the CIA away, or do any
thing but use power and co
ercion to stop it.
Learning The Lesson
P. You've learned your lessons
very well, haven't you? It's
just that kind of righteous
ness and benevolent power
grabbing that you hate in the
CIA — personally assuming
power to change something
that is part of the govern
ment, but wrong and im
moral in your view. It's not
a very attractive group —
the CIA — to me either, you
know.
S. What's wrong with power?
We need it — the whole
colonialist - imperialist - capi
talist - monopolistic free
world is based on corruption
and power! Do you want me
to count on the ballot-box? I
don't want to choose between
two oranges — I want to be
able to have an apple. You're
giving me a lot of crap — to
fight corrupt power by bal
lots or pickets — the only
thing power understands is
counter-power — not Gandhi
or passive non-violence but
power, as coercive as need be.
P. Don't you feel that this power
has to be appropriate to the
"crime" or problem?
There Is A Price
S. No — we use all we can
muster at any confrontation
if we think it's worth the
risks of being beaten or jail
ed by the cops. If we'd had
5,000 at Encina Hall, we
could have done it. Of if ma
chine guns would have work
ed, we'd have done that.
They'll have to learn the
price to be paid.
P. That's going overboard to
stop one CIA interviewer,
isn't it? .
S. If we let that one come here
there'll be more and more
and more of them — like
Dominoes — Dow and the
rest — then we're really lost.
Home Defense First!
P. Why not go to the source —
the CIA Building outside
Washington — and picket
there?
S. They're sending their men
here — onto our campus —
we've got to learn to fight
them here — "the blue water
of all the fish has to be poi
soned.'" You saw what hap
ened at Oakland and Wiscon
sin — they're brutal and
spreading and they're im
moral.
P. So, legal non-coercive forms
of protest simply aren't
enough —
S. Right — they're ineffective
—power gets more attention
and when we're organized
enough and stronger we'll
upset all the little apple
carts and then the whole
orchard will be spoiled too.
P. I was just thinking that's it
too bad we don't have a panel
of four or five other people
here to discuss these things
so vital to us all — the CIA,
Vietnam, political power,

civil rights — whatever else
might come up.
S. Baloney! You want a panel
to cover all views and keep
up the myth and fetish of an
open mind and considering
all sides of a problem. That's
your way of life — no guts,
no action, no strong beliefs
you'll sacrifice anything for.
P. You don't know the differ
ence between indecision or
apathy, and careful rational
consideration of the problem,
its possible solutions, and
their short- and long-range
consequences. When I was
In college I felt about action
much as you. . . .
S. Well, you're not in college —
but you are In a college and
it's run by the System — big
government, big corporations,
lawyers, businessmen — the
only people who have no
voice are the students, the
sweetly submissive faculty,
and the greater Stanford com
munity. You're still In it, but
you don't realize it.
We Do Have Liberty
P. Whatever else, our system
has survived and been modi
fied and there's a lot of po
litical liberty here. There's
no monolith — there is
plenty of healthy debate and
open disagreement. Even our
President can call me a trait
or for being ambivalent about
Vietnam. I don't go for his
violence any more than your
force or coercion, so am I
not a free political animal?
S. With your support the Sys
tem could be toppled. . . .
Then we. . . .
P. And with your opposition it
apparently can't be moved
very much — and where
would you lead it anyway?
Would you have everyone
"do their thing" and live hap
pily ever after? This is the
most complex and technologi
cal age in history — we need
some kind of organization,
order, of continuity together
with change. What kind of
constructive alternative do
you have?
I'll Kill For Love
S. I don't have one yet — I'm
mostly only sure that what
I'm against is very corrupt
ing and stultifying — leav
ing people dehumanized and
alienated and demoralized —
I'm for love, peace, human
ity, and participatory demo
cracy where we each have a
voice and power and I'll kill
to get it.
P. You sound a little like Dean
Rusk.
S. But he's got all the power
and . . .
P. He thinks that what he's do
ing is for the good of the peo
ple of Vietnam and that he's
right and moral and prevent
ing aggression and has to use
unfortunate means to "do his
thing."
'Tragically Wrongheaded'
S. But his System is big and im
personal and he's tragically
wrongheaded — he thinks
that we can step in anywhere
in the world and do whatever
we feel necessary to protect
ourselves — he's got to be
stopped.
P. He might feel the same way
about you.
S. He might — the only thing he
. and I probably agree on is
that you're a lousy middle of
the roader — you won't join
the American Legion and you
won't actively protest in Oak
land.
Must We Be Extreme?
P. Do we all have to go to the
extreme to be human? I'm
confused, frightened, and vul
nerable to arguments — ra
tional arguments, that is —
from all sides on these mat
ters. I keep informed and
talk to all the people I can
concerned with these issues
— then I'll vote for the in
dividuals and parties best ex
pressing my view, or I may
picket or march at a demon
stration. I might even vote
for a peace candidate if I
think he can also run the
country.
S. Don't you think I've thought

about all these things and
the pros and cons, too? I then
took a stand! I think I'm
right and Dean Rusk is
wrong and that you'll always
be weak and undecided.
P. You seem to feel powerless
and I sure feel uncertain —
maybe Dean Rusk does, too.
S. But he's got the power and ...
Are You Scared?
P. Yes, and maybe it's out of
control, even his control, and
he's just as scared as I am.
By the way, are you scared?
S. In many ways, no — through
introspection and meditation
I've freed myself from fears
pounded into me — if I go to
jail so what? Or if I'm killed
by a cop in a demonstration,
that's O.K. and I might even
help our cause . . .
P. Become a martyr or symbol
like Malcolm X or someone
like that?
S. Yes — and don't give me any
crap about me glorifying

death in a moral combat like
a statue to a soldier. This is
different — my way would
only be temporary — till the
System is broken down and
put back together again like
Humpty-Dumpty. Then those
of us who died lor what we
believed could be easily for
gotten.
P. Dead radicals aren't forgotten
any more easily than dead
soldiers, are they?
S. I'm getting sick of your ver
bal tricks! Do you want to
talk about Zen or Buddhism
or democracy or the facts of
the suffering we've inflicted
on the poor Vietnamese peo
ple? I hate the war and I
hate this country and I can
tell you why and maybe make
you act, too.
P. We really haven't talked
about many facte have we?
Oh, by the way, I hate the
war, too, but I do love this
country.
