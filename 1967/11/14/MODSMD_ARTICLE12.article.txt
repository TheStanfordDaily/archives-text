# Letters To The Editor
## The 						Axe Comm Is Really Not In The R.F. Business 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As chairman of Axe Comm, I
think this letter is necessary.
There are absolutely no "R.F.s"
planned by the Comm this week
nor will there by any. Our group
may be spirited and worthless,
but as a group with myself at
its head, we certainly won't be
that worthless.
Big Game R.F.s are harmful,
time consuming, and costly, and
I wish to have none of the same
attributed to Axe Comm as a
group.
I have no control over what
the individual members of my
organization may do on their
own time, but I would recom
mend to them that they spend
their time doing something use
ful with their minds rather than
going to Cal.
Let Cal students show their
immaturity by coming down
here and painting our school,
but please let all Stanford stu
dents remain on our campus as
a tribute to what our school is
becoming. This would not be a
demonstration of less spirit by
or for the school, but rather
a demonstration of more self
restraint and less "high school
ism."
T also must comment on the
axe. A sophomore at Cal in the
Beta house stole the axe in the
spring and held it in the Beta
house until recently when he
moved it somewhere more se
cure. Axe Comm does have a
committee to get it back, headed
by Mike Wall.
If anyone has knowledge of
the Axe's whereabouts or wishes
to help get it back, he may con
tact Mike at the Boathouse.
Please don't think that Axe
Comm has done nothing to re

gain this sacred treasure, for
there were unsuccessful at
tempts while it was in the Beta
house.

• Playing Games?
Editor, The Daily:
Re: Monday's editorial "Elect
McCloskey."
It seems as though the ultra
conservatives are continually
calling the tricks. They put up
Goldwater, we supported John
son; they put up Reagan, we
supported Brown; they put up
Shirley, again we rise to the
bait. How long must we play this
game, Mr. Editor?
The Keating campaign offers
a positive alternative. The peace
movement in this area has
enough talent, manpower, and
money to help elect Ed Keating
in today's primary, and to Con
gress on December 12th. There
is no reason to settle for second
best.

• Just In Case
Editor, The Daily:
For the Daily to support a
candidate in a congressional elec
tion is questionable; but from a
standpoint of professional ethics
the presentation of an editorial
the day before an election when
it can not be effectively rebutted,
is deplorable.
In particular I take exception
to the implications concerning
Edward Keating. If voters want
to have a peace candidate in the

runoffs, their safest bet by far is
to vote for Keating.
As the Daily explained, it is
the top Democrat and the top
Republican who go into the run
off election. At this point even
McCloskey's official polls credit
Ed Keating as the one most like
ly to win the Democratic pri
mary. On the other hand, few are
willing to credit McCloskey with
a similar chance among the Re
publicans.
One other point remains to
be made and that is that San
Mateo County is not a Repub
lican county. It was when Young
er first won, but now 54 per cent
of the registered voters are
Democrats, and needless to say
the Republicans will not be run
ning as incumbents this time.
Thus I think a good case can
be made for the other side. If
one's objective is to get a peace
candidate into the runoff, and
one that can win, Ed Keating is
the safe bet.

• Badge Of . . .
Editor, The Dally:
The white armbands are gone.
They were an effective advertise
ment for the convocation Satur
day night; and now the cam
paign is over.
But the vigil is just begin
ning. If the armbands were more
than a public relations gimmick
— if they symbolized a commit
ment to oppose the Vietnam war,
serving as the badge of a fra
ternity far larger than any one
political group — they are still
needed. Needed more than ever,
in fact; it is very easy to wear
such a badge in a sympathetic
community, but the real witness

must take place outside the Stan
ford enclave.
Over Thanksgiving and espe
cially Christmas we have a
chance to spread the vigil's mes
sage across the country. The
Vietnam war is a national trag
edy; the white armband can be
a national symbol of united op
position to that war.

• From The Editor
Readers:
The San Francisco Chronicle
yesterday reported that the staff
of The Stanford Daily had voted
unanimously to endorse Paul
N. McCloskey in the San Mateo
County congressional race.
While it is consoling to know
that other newspapers have ac
curacy problems, it did disturb
us, for this editorial decision, as
all others, was made by the edit
or in consultation with an edi
torial committee. The four mem
bers of the editorial committee
all agreed to the endorsement.

• 'Jasmine Silence 9
Editor, The Daily:
Good morning, my friend.
My candle has nearly burned
itself out, and unfortunately, I
must put on my new face at
dawn. But for this night my
thoughts have rested naked —
riding in a Volkswagon bus, no
shoes, my hair blowing free and
very much stoned. So full of
love; tonight is the only reality
for myself and those resting
with my thoughts.
Between bowls of rice and
nectarine juice, I have written
poems for mirages and ghosts
that seem alive and warm at
fleeting moments.
It's a good thing to forget
about reasons why once in a
while and whirl with dreams
and ideals. Just every now and
then so as not to forget all that
ever was lies suspended and
waiting somewhere. I wrote a
poem for you, but somehow it is
for everyone. Perhaps because
you are everyone and everyone
is you — the order of the uni
verse always seems to become
lost in surreality.
a man free from war at peace
must be free from hate
and sin and lust
and action.
for as fire burns fuel to ashes
so wisdom burns action to
to ashes.
to burn off sins—
action in inaction

here and here
after . . .
"What would you say if I
sang out of key?" I'm getting
high with a little help from my
brother and his friends, but I
keep running across you in Don
ovan's castles, so bear with my
sudden letter for it helps to
talk to you. I am desperately in
need of being on someone's
trip. My friends are trying their
best, but they never come along
with me. It's really frustrating
and I wonder how far out or
in I am.
Perhaps none of this matters
or makes much sense to you,
but it is better expressed and
one more day behind me. I must
also say that I feel well in what
you are doing now and felt a
part of something universal in
reading your letters. There is
no need to feel you must write.
These sudden mind explosions

of mine are hardly the kind of
thing one responds to frequent
ly-
I am spending as much of
my time in Big Sur as possible
and taking hours for nature
communication. It helps me to
see myself more clearly.
This plastic involvement with
everyone is so ridiculous that I
have a hearth that can warm
only a few hands. The tunes I
know are old ones but the only
true ones for me. So, in naked
honesty I'll unleash youthful
gentle winds to touch your
thoughts and help you in any
way you might need.
But, I'm not making much
sense to you, I'm sure, so please
laugh and say unbelievable once
to put this fantasy in the proper
jar on your shelf. And if you
find yourself getting lost in a
dream now and then, open the
jar and return me a thought or

wish mack of the jasmine silrnot
within.
If you have read this fur, y<u
are good peopl< . . .
