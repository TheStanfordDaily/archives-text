# In Glass Houses
## November Christmas 
### Robert E. Stone 
Ho, ho, ho, merry Christmas,
ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas
everybody. Ho, ho, ho. That's
right folks, it's Christmas time
again. What's that you say? It's
too early for it to be Christmas
time. Obviously you have not
been off-campus for a while.
In the past week the follow
ing reminders of yuletide spirit
have been placed in prominent
view. The huge silver Christmas
tree has been erected in the Stan
ford shopping center. The Em
porium had its Santa Claus pa
rade in the city. Santa landed
on Nob Hill and rode down to
Macy's. Christmas decorations
are up in all the department
: tores. Gift catalogues have been
flooding the mails. The Post Of
fice is reminding everybody to
'nail early to insure prompty
delivery.
Now all of this doesn't bother
me because I did my Christmas
shopping last January, but I
really worry about the millions
of people who are being thrown
into the hectic commercialism of
Christmas at this late date.
While I am sitting home re
flecting on the joyous season,
which begins in about a month,
these poor unfortunates will be
wearily plodding the streets in
futile attempts to find just the
right thing for some relative.
If they are really lucky they will
find it in time to go to church
on Christmas day.
I am sure that It takes a real
effort for many people to remem
ber what Christmas is all about.
It takes an even bigger effort to
remember what Thanksgiving is
all about. We are, I think, still
having Thanksgiving this year.
There was a time when Christ
mas was more than getting to
gether and exchanging gifts,
then going home and trying to
decide what you should return
so that you could get what you
really wanted.
More and more people are get
ting around this problem by the
simple trick of asking for mon
ey. "Give me what ever you were
going to spend and then I'll go
out and get what I want."
Is commercialism ruining

Christmas? Is Christmas no
more than Bob Hope's trip to
Vietnam, and Dickens, and Pea
nuts? It would seem that way.
Christmas is a time when store
managers smile greedily and
salespeople fall over themselves
trying to help you out. It is get
ting disgusting.
Tom Lehrer put it much bet
ter than I can. "On Christmas
day you can't get sore,/ Your
brother man you must adore,/
There's time to rob him all the
more,/ The other 364." Each year
the robbery starts just a little
bit earlier, and frankly I'm wor
ried.
I worried that my special
little trick to avoid all the push
of Christmas is going to catch
on. Shopping in January is ideal.
The stores are empty and the
prices are lower than during the
special Christmas "sales."
But imagine how horrible it
would be if we all did this.

Christmas season would begin
in January. Soon we would dis
cover that January wasn't big
enough to handle the rush, so
February would be included. I
can see the signs now — Only
363 more shopping days 'til
Christmas.
I don't have any suggestions
on how to avoid a year-long
Christmas, but I am sure that
there must be some way of do
ing it.
I hope that we can find it, be
cause I'll sort of miss all the
other holidays. You know Easter,
and July 4th, and Thanksgiving.
They are all meaningful and
wonderful holidays and it would
really be a shame to see them
get swallowed up by the big
monster Christmas.
It is time, I think to sit down
and take a long look at the
Christmas season, to discover
what's missing from it, and find
a way of replacing it.
Ho, ho, ho, merry Christmas,
ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas
everybody. Ho, ho, ho. That's

Macy's. Christmas decorations
are up in all the department
: tores. Gift catalogues have been
flooding the mails. The Post Of
fice is reminding everybody to
'nail early to insure prompty
delivery.
Now all of this doesn't bother
me because I did my Christmas
shopping last January, but I
really worry about the millions
of people who are being thrown
into the hectic commercialism of
Christmas at this late date.
While I am sitting home re
flecting on the joyous season,
which begins in about a month,
these poor unfortunates will be
wearily plodding the streets in
futile attempts to find just the
right thing for some relative.
If they are really lucky they will
find it in time to go to church
on Christmas day.
I am sure that It takes a real
effort for many people to remem
ber what Christmas is all about.
It takes an even bigger effort to
remember what Thanksgiving is
all about. We are, I think, still
having Thanksgiving this year.
There was a time when Christ
mas was more than getting to
gether and exchanging gifts,
then going home and trying to
decide what you should return
so that you could get what you
really wanted.
More and more people are get
ting around this problem by the
simple trick of asking for mon
ey. "Give me what ever you were
going to spend and then I'll go
out and get what I want."
Is commercialism ruining

Christmas? Is Christmas no
more than Bob Hope's trip to
Vietnam, and Dickens, and Pea
nuts? It would seem that way.
Christmas is a time when store
managers smile greedily and
salespeople fall over themselves
trying to help you out. It is get
ting disgusting.
Tom Lehrer put it much bet
ter than I can. "On Christmas
day you can't get sore,/ Your
brother man you must adore,/
There's time to rob him all the
more,/ The other 364." Each year
the robbery starts just a little
bit earlier, and frankly I'm wor
ried.
I worried that my special
little trick to avoid all the push
of Christmas is going to catch
on. Shopping in January is ideal.
The stores are empty and the
prices are lower than during the
special Christmas "sales."
But imagine how horrible it
would be if we all did this.

Christmas season would begin
in January. Soon we would dis
cover that January wasn't big
enough to handle the rush, so
February would be included. I
can see the signs now — Only
363 more shopping days 'til
Christmas.
I don't have any suggestions
on how to avoid a year-long
Christmas, but I am sure that
there must be some way of do
ing it.
I hope that we can find it, be
cause I'll sort of miss all the
other holidays. You know Easter,
and July 4th, and Thanksgiving.
They are all meaningful and
wonderful holidays and it would
really be a shame to see them
get swallowed up by the big
monster Christmas.
It is time, I think to sit down
and take a long look at the
Christmas season, to discover
what's missing from it, and find
a way of replacing it.
Ho, ho, ho, merry Christmas,
ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas
everybody. Ho, ho, ho. That's
right folks, it's Christmas time
again. What's that you say? It's
too early for it to be Christmas
time. Obviously you have not
been off-campus for a while.
In the past week the follow
ing reminders of yuletide spirit
have been placed in prominent

tree has been erected in the Stan
