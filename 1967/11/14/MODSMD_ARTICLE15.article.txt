# Stanford Professors Learn About College Football As Guests Of Athletic Department
## 
### DAVID NOLAND 
The scene is the football train
ing room at Encina Gym, one
hour before the Oregon game.
! The air is filled with the smell
of sweat and ointment. Middle
!. linebacker Marty Brill, 6 feet
* and 220 pounds, braces his left
! leg as the trainer wraps him
from ankle to waist in bandages
and tape.
* Next to him sits Blaine Nye,
6-4 and 246. He wraps a roll of
adhesive tape around his
clenched fist, slamming it re
peatedly into his other palm.
Behind Nye stands Robert
Packenham, Professor of Politi
cal Science, 5-8, 145 pounds, be
spectacled, dressed in a coat and
. . . Wait a minute! There must
be some mistake!

No, there's no mistake. Pro
fessor Packenham and 3 of his
colleagues really were in the
football training room last Sat
urday. It's all part of a weekly
program designed to give in
terested profs an inside look at
big-time college football.
Professors Adopted
Each home game, the players
"adopt" four or Ave professors,
who spend the entire day with
the team as official guests of the
athletic department. The re
sponse is almost always enthus
iastic.
"We usually get two kinds of
profs interested in doing this
sort of thing," reports Bob
Butler, administrator of the pro
gram. "The real sports fans and
the doubters."
Last Saturday's group were

all real sports fans. Other guests
besides prof. Packenham were
Sanford M. Dornbusch, profes
sor of sociology, Sidney Drell,
a professor of physics who
works at SLAC, and Prof. Tom
J. Connolly of the Mechanical
Engineering Dept.
Preliminary Meeting
Their day began with a pre
liminary meeting and introduc
tion to their chaperones, injured
players Bob Rinker and Ken
Ambrose. After sitting in on
the players' meeting at Ricky's
Hyatt House, the profs accom
panied the team to the training
room to observe the gladiators
preparing for combat.
Prof. Drell chatted with Gene
Washington, who sat naked in a
whirlpool bath, and fellow phys
iccist Nye.

Prof. Packenham gingerly
tried out one of the weight
training devices. Puffing and
grimacing, he managed to lift
it an inch or two.
Professors Dornbush and Con
nolly bombarded Ambrose with
questions and marvelled at the
quantities of tape and bandages
used on Brill's knee.
On Sidelines
As game time drew nearer,
players and professors walked
over to the stadium. The team
began their ritual warm-up
drills as the profs wandered up
and down the sidelines watch
ing and munching on box
lunches provided them.
Despite their exposure to the
pregame preparations, the profs
did not yet seem completely
caught up in the atmosphere of

the game. They were still just
interested spectators.
Engineering Professor Con
nolly's first observation on the
field, for example, concerned the
convex contour of the field and
its effect on the drainage.
After the opening kickoff,
however, the nearness of the
action and the enthusiasm of the
players quickly caught them up.
Prof. Dornbusch spent much
of his time standing up on the
bench, excitedly peering over
the sea of helmets in front of
him.
Packenham Cheers
As the Tribe drove for their
first touchdown, Prof. Packen
ham cheered enthusiastically
from his spot directly behind
the end zone. He looked as if he
wanted to be ten years old
again, so he could join the
swarm of kids in pursuit of
Shoemaker's extra point kick.
After listening to a Ralston
locker room tirade during half
time, the profs returned to the
field to urge on the Indians in
the second half. Their enthusi

asm never waned; they followed
the last play along the side
line just as closely as the first.
Besides feeling the normal ex
citement any sports fan would
feel at being so close to the field,
the profs were most impressed
by the incredible violence of the
physical contact.
Commenting on the ferocity
of the blocking and tackling,
Prof. Dornbusch said, "From
the press box it's all so tech
nical. Down here it's different."
Professor Drell agreed. "You
have just got to admire the
players' courage. The contact
is really something."
All in all, the profs seemed to
enjoy their experience immens
ely. And they all came away
with a good deal more respect
for Stanford football players.
"It's a closed world that few
people get to see," commented
Professor Connolly. For these
and other profs who have par
ticipated in this program, the
"closed world" of big time col
legiate football has opened up
a bit.
