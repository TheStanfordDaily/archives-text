# House Leaders Meet Hind
## 
### 
The presidents of four living
groups met yesterday for a
briefing with Robert Hind, staff
director of the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES).
The purpose of the meeting
was to advise them in their
efforts to organize house discus
sions on seven detailed ques
tions posed by SES in a recent
letter to all campus residences.
Dean Hind stressed that "stu
dent participation is key" to the
successful and meaningful pro
gress of SES. He expressed
hope that the presidents, includ

ing those not present, would be
able to marshal a significant
general response from the stu
dent body.
Hind also pointed out that re
ports on why students fail to
attend the meetings, other than
obvious situational excuses,
would also be pertinent to the
Study.
Norton Batkin 111, undergrad
uate member of the steering
committee, declared that if stu
dents fail to respond to the SES
questions, "the faculty will have
an open field."
