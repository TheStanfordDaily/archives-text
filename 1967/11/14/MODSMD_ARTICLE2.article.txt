# American Back From Peking Talks Of Red Guard Life
## 
### ROBIN KNIGHT 
Chris Milton, 18, holder of an
American passport but also a
Red Guard from Peking describ
ed China's Cultural Revolution
yesterday afternoon as "a big
debate concerning every conceiv
able issue both internal and ex
ternal."
Apparently the Red Guard
movement "occurred spontan
eously. Nobody controlled the
Red Guards," Chris asserted. In

many cases the Red Guards were
drametrically opposed to one an
other" and the aims of the move
ment "was according to the peo
ple who made up the Red Guard
Guards."
Chris arrived in Peking with
his parents three years ago. He
refused to say whether or not
his parents were Communists.
His father is still teaching at
Peking's Foreign Language In
stitute, and Chris obviously wish
ed to avoid saying anything
which would jeopardize his fath
er's position, which he called
"tricky."
In Peking Chris attended the
University's Secondary School.
From June 1966 to September
1967 the school was closed. It
was during this period that most

Chris Milton will speak on
"A Participant's View of The
Red Guards" this afternoon
at 4:15 In Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. He will describe his
experiences with the Red
Guard movement. Christ re
turned from three years in
China in August.

of the Red Guard activity oc
curred.
In describing what happened
at his school, Chris said that the
original trouble concerned exams
and the educational system in
general. In March 1966 a strike
occurred over the exam system
By summer 1966 the main tar
get was the Party Secretary,
who was also the Principal.
"Quite a bit of hostility" was
felt towards the teachers "be
cause at first it seemed as if
most of them stood up for the
Party Secretary." Why was this
wrong — "Because she was cor
rupt, never carried out the mass
line, and was a bureaucrat,"
Chris replied.
Practically all the teachers
were criticized, Chris continued.
"Some were struggled against."
By the end there was much
more integration." Some of the
struggle sessions went on "for
days" with irregular breaks for
food.
From the end of November
1966 to late January 1967, Chris
and twenty friends walked 800
miles through Hopei and Ho
nan. The purpose of this walk
"was to get to know the coun
try, understand the people and


CHRIS MILTON
learn how they lived and
thought" Chris emphasized.
Know The People
This "get to know the people
movement" was repeated "by
thousands of groups all over
China." Chris saw his group "as
a kind of propaganda team. We
often performed skits and plays
to the villagers about the Cul
tural Revolution. We gave out
printed material, conducted so
cial investigations and usually
paid our own way." The govern
ment "gave us a lot of money"
as well.
Chris's group "didn't have too
much to do with the cadres."
After three months they decided
to return to Peking where the
struggle within their school had
reached a critical stage.
Chris was full of praise for
the railways, which by this

time were overwhelmed with
Red Guards.
Back in Peking, he discovered
that the Red Flag group in the
school, which was "predomin
antly the sons of cadres" had
developed "along a fascist line,"
meaning arrogant and high
handed. This struggle was re
solved in favor of the Red
Guards who eventually asserted
control.
Classrooms Were Closed
Meanwhile the classrooms re
mained shut. The students
"spent the day attending meet
ings, writing posters, visiting
neighboring units and gather
ing evidence," presumably for
further struggle sessions.
Chris described how the cap
italists—in this case meaning
former factory owners who still
receive a fixed 5 per cent in
terest payment—were attacked.
He admitted some were killed.
On violence, Chris compared
Peking favorably to a New
York neighborhood. He had
taken part in demonstrations

outside the British and Viet
namese embassies.
Time and again Chris empha
sized the spontaneity of the Red
Guards. "There was very little
control. The only control the
Central Committee or the Party
had was through editorials in
the People's Daily," Chris as
serted.
How much is the Red Guard
movement associated with the
Party? "Oh, everybody in China
is associated with the Party,"
Chris replied. What about the
Army? "The Army wasn't real
ly running the Red Guards, and
didn't have too much to do with
it."
When asked about Mao, Chris
replied that if anyone criticized
Mao, "people would laugh at
him." It appeared to Chris that
Mao enjoyed absolute respect
from all the people.
Is it impossible for Mao to be
wrong? "No, I don't think its
impossible for him to be wrong,"
Chris replied. "It just appears
that he hasn't been yet. . . . "

of the Red Guard activity oc
curred.
In describing what happened
at his school, Chris said that the
original trouble concerned exams
and the educational system in
general. In March 1966 a strike
occurred over the exam system
By summer 1966 the main tar
get was the Party Secretary,
who was also the Principal.
"Quite a bit of hostility" was
felt towards the teachers "be
cause at first it seemed as if
most of them stood up for the
Party Secretary." Why was this
wrong — "Because she was cor
rupt, never carried out the mass
line, and was a bureaucrat,"
Chris replied.
Practically all the teachers
were criticized, Chris continued.
"Some were struggled against."
By the end there was much
more integration." Some of the
struggle sessions went on "for
days" with irregular breaks for
food.
From the end of November
1966 to late January 1967, Chris
and twenty friends walked 800
miles through Hopei and Ho
nan. The purpose of this walk
"was to get to know the coun
try, understand the people and


CHRIS MILTON
learn how they lived and
thought" Chris emphasized.
Know The People
This "get to know the people
movement" was repeated "by
thousands of groups all over
China." Chris saw his group "as
a kind of propaganda team. We
often performed skits and plays
to the villagers about the Cul
tural Revolution. We gave out
printed material, conducted so
cial investigations and usually
paid our own way." The govern
ment "gave us a lot of money"
as well.
Chris's group "didn't have too
much to do with the cadres."
After three months they decided
to return to Peking where the
struggle within their school had
reached a critical stage.
Chris was full of praise for
the railways, which by this

time were overwhelmed with
Red Guards.
Back in Peking, he discovered
that the Red Flag group in the
school, which was "predomin
antly the sons of cadres" had
developed "along a fascist line,"
meaning arrogant and high
handed. This struggle was re
solved in favor of the Red
Guards who eventually asserted
control.
Classrooms Were Closed
Meanwhile the classrooms re
mained shut. The students
"spent the day attending meet
ings, writing posters, visiting
neighboring units and gather
ing evidence," presumably for
further struggle sessions.
Chris described how the cap
italists—in this case meaning
former factory owners who still
receive a fixed 5 per cent in
terest payment—were attacked.
He admitted some were killed.
On violence, Chris compared
Peking favorably to a New
York neighborhood. He had
taken part in demonstrations

outside the British and Viet
namese embassies.
Time and again Chris empha
sized the spontaneity of the Red
Guards. "There was very little
control. The only control the
Central Committee or the Party
had was through editorials in
the People's Daily," Chris as
serted.
How much is the Red Guard
movement associated with the
Party? "Oh, everybody in China
is associated with the Party,"
Chris replied. What about the
Army? "The Army wasn't real
ly running the Red Guards, and
didn't have too much to do with
it."
When asked about Mao, Chris
replied that if anyone criticized
Mao, "people would laugh at
him." It appeared to Chris that
Mao enjoyed absolute respect
from all the people.
Is it impossible for Mao to be
wrong? "No, I don't think its
impossible for him to be wrong,"
Chris replied. "It just appears
that he hasn't been yet. . . . "
Chris Milton, 18, holder of an
American passport but also a
Red Guard from Peking describ
ed China's Cultural Revolution
yesterday afternoon as "a big
debate concerning every conceiv
able issue both internal and ex
ternal."
Apparently the Red Guard
movement "occurred spontan
eously. Nobody controlled the
Red Guards," Chris asserted. In

many cases the Red Guards were
drametrically opposed to one an
other" and the aims of the move
ment "was according to the peo
ple who made up the Red Guard
Guards."
Chris arrived in Peking with
his parents three years ago. He
refused to say whether or not
his parents were Communists.
His father is still teaching at
Peking's Foreign Language In
stitute, and Chris obviously wish
ed to avoid saying anything
which would jeopardize his fath
er's position, which he called
"tricky."
In Peking Chris attended the
University's Secondary School.
From June 1966 to September
1967 the school was closed. It

try, understand the people and


CHRIS MILTON
learn how they lived and
thought" Chris emphasized.
Know The People
This "get to know the people
movement" was repeated "by
thousands of groups all over
China." Chris saw his group "as
a kind of propaganda team. We
often performed skits and plays
to the villagers about the Cul
tural Revolution. We gave out
printed material, conducted so
cial investigations and usually
paid our own way." The govern
ment "gave us a lot of money"
as well.
Chris's group "didn't have too
much to do with the cadres."
After three months they decided
to return to Peking where the
struggle within their school had
reached a critical stage.
Chris was full of praise for
the railways, which by this

time were overwhelmed with
Red Guards.
Back in Peking, he discovered
that the Red Flag group in the
school, which was "predomin
antly the sons of cadres" had
developed "along a fascist line,"
meaning arrogant and high
handed. This struggle was re
solved in favor of the Red
Guards who eventually asserted
control.
Classrooms Were Closed
Meanwhile the classrooms re
mained shut. The students
"spent the day attending meet
ings, writing posters, visiting
neighboring units and gather
ing evidence," presumably for
further struggle sessions.
Chris described how the cap
italists—in this case meaning
former factory owners who still
receive a fixed 5 per cent in
terest payment—were attacked.
He admitted some were killed.
On violence, Chris compared
Peking favorably to a New
York neighborhood. He had
taken part in demonstrations

outside the British and Viet
namese embassies.
Time and again Chris empha
sized the spontaneity of the Red
Guards. "There was very little
control. The only control the
Central Committee or the Party
had was through editorials in
the People's Daily," Chris as
serted.
How much is the Red Guard
movement associated with the
Party? "Oh, everybody in China
is associated with the Party,"
Chris replied. What about the
Army? "The Army wasn't real
ly running the Red Guards, and
didn't have too much to do with
it."
When asked about Mao, Chris
replied that if anyone criticized
Mao, "people would laugh at
him." It appeared to Chris that
Mao enjoyed absolute respect
from all the people.
Is it impossible for Mao to be
wrong? "No, I don't think its
impossible for him to be wrong,"
Chris replied. "It just appears
that he hasn't been yet. . . . "
Chris Milton, 18, holder of an
American passport but also a
Red Guard from Peking describ
ed China's Cultural Revolution
yesterday afternoon as "a big
debate concerning every conceiv
able issue both internal and ex
ternal."
Apparently the Red Guard
movement "occurred spontan
eously. Nobody controlled the
Red Guards," Chris asserted. In

many cases the Red Guards were
drametrically opposed to one an
other" and the aims of the move
ment "was according to the peo
ple who made up the Red Guard
Guards."
Chris arrived in Peking with
his parents three years ago. He
refused to say whether or not
his parents were Communists.
His father is still teaching at
Peking's Foreign Language In
stitute, and Chris obviously wish
ed to avoid saying anything
which would jeopardize his fath
er's position, which he called
"tricky."
In Peking Chris attended the
University's Secondary School.
From June 1966 to September
1967 the school was closed. It
was during this period that most

Chris Milton will speak on
"A Participant's View of The
Red Guards" this afternoon
at 4:15 In Dinkelspiel Audi
torium. He will describe his
experiences with the Red
Guard movement. Christ re
turned from three years in
China in August.

of the Red Guard activity oc
curred.
In describing what happened
at his school, Chris said that the
original trouble concerned exams
and the educational system in
general. In March 1966 a strike
occurred over the exam system
By summer 1966 the main tar
get was the Party Secretary,
who was also the Principal.
"Quite a bit of hostility" was
felt towards the teachers "be
cause at first it seemed as if
most of them stood up for the
Party Secretary." Why was this
wrong — "Because she was cor
rupt, never carried out the mass
line, and was a bureaucrat,"
Chris replied.
Practically all the teachers
were criticized, Chris continued.
"Some were struggled against."
By the end there was much
more integration." Some of the
struggle sessions went on "for
days" with irregular breaks for
food.
From the end of November
1966 to late January 1967, Chris
and twenty friends walked 800
miles through Hopei and Ho
nan. The purpose of this walk
