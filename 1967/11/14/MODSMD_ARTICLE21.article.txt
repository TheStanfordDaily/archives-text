# Renaissance Theater Villains Portrayed
## 
### GARY M. SALT 
"Welcome to The Man Behind
the Mask, an evening of episodes
from Elizabethan and Jacobean
drama."
Thus began the second The
atre-at-the-Museum production
presented last Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday evenings in the
Museum's Meidel Room. Direc
tor Robert Morgan, second-year
MFA student, selected scenes
from Shakespeare's Richard 111
and Othello, and Webster's The
Dutchess of MalA to demon
strate 'the development of the
villain figure in Renaissance
drama." A visit to the Meidel
Room for any one of the per
formances was well worth it.
Difficult Scenes
Morgan was not easy on his
company. The scenes were diffi
cult, and the three-quarter stag
ing demanded movement and
positioning that enabled the
actors to relate not only to each
other but to all of the audience.
The action was intense and
complex, often subdued, almost
languid, yet just as often aggre
sive and brutal. From the open
ing moments of the production,
an impressive ensemble en
trance, each actor possessed a
presence, a command of the ma
terial and the character that
was rarely abandoned.
To illustrate the first type of
villainy, Morgan chose the open
ing soliloquy from Richard 111
coupled with Richard's brief but
successful courtship of Lady
Anne at the funeral of her fath
er-in-law, one of Richard's vic
tims. Joe Medalis as Richard and
Ruth Hunt as Lady Anne must
confront each other in a scene
inherently grotesque. Richard
has murdered Anne's husband
and father-in-law and his evil is
obvious and well-planned. Yet
his wicked charm and persuasion
are his most effective weapons

in forcing Anne to accept his
misshapen mind and body as
husband and king.
His assault on her hatred is
climaxed when, on his knee, he
offers her a dagger, that she
might kill him or order his sui
cide. Friday evening, Lady Anne
was too child-like in her rejec
tion of the dagger and her loath
ing for Richard was transferred
to the blade itself. Her compo
sure as a royal widow lapsed
into squeamishness. In the other
two performances, however,
Lady Anne was played with con
sumate poise and intensity and
the emotional force of her sub
mission equalled the force of
Richard's insidious urgings.
Superb Portrayal
Medalis' portrayal was superb
in its execution and devastating
in its sacrifice of love to power.
Medalis infused Richard with the
monumental pride that he must
have to attempt the seemingly
impossible task of wooing and
winning Lady Anno at the very
height of her passionate disgust
for him. Medalis and Mrs. Hunt
capably used the absurdity of
the situation to make it work.
Preserving the thread of vil
liany established by Richard,
Morgan next presented the
"more complex and less ob
vious" evil of lago. He selected
the crucial moments in Act 111,
Scene three, where lago first
suggests Desdemona's infidelity
to Othello. Medalis was lago,
and Sergei Tschernisch was
Othello. Of the three scenes pre
sented, Othello showed the most
consistent improvement over the
three nights. The timing and
movement were precise and well
played. The cloak of friendship
that surrounds Othello and lago
at this point in the play and
which could not be discarded de
spite playing the scene out of
context, became more apparent

with each production. Tscher
nisch established Othello's con
fidence as a commander and hus
band early in the scene. In con
trast, lago masterfully wormed
his suspicions into Othello's mind
and thus laid the foundation for
Othello's pitiable question, "Why
did I marry?"
Othello's Anguish
Finally, Morgan presented the
execution scene from the Duch
ass of Main. Medalis played Bo
sola, henchman to Ferdinand,
who was played by Kurt Smith.
If it seemed at times as though
the force of evil previously
established had been weakened
by splitting it among three char
acters, only two of whom are
seen, this feeling soon passed
when Medalis and Smith conspir
ed together to murder the Duch
ess. Indeed, the impression was
not of less villainy but of more.
Most Taxing Part
Medalis had reached his most
taxing part of the evening.
Having constructed Richard and
lago, he had to continue as Bo
sola and as the agent of Mor
gan's development of evil. His
success in all four roles was em
bodied in yet another, when, as
a tombmaker, he took the stage
completely hidden in a black
robe. He sat mournfully on the
Duchess' coffin and suddenly the
development had crested. Here
was all that we had seen: Rich
ard, lago, Bosola, and Ferdi
nand; the devil, evil, death, and
the worst potentialities of the
human mind.
Smith as the wolfish, half mad
Ferdinand conveyed the resolute
sentence of death and destruc
tion that was the perfect com
plement to Bosola. Miss Haefele
was excellent as the Duchess
striving to preserve her integ
rity and dignity in the face of
death. Miss Kemp's skills were
evident throughout but espe

cially in her hopeless efforts to
evoid a brutal execution.
Easy Fluid Style
Norbert Davidson and Howard
Brown who played Tressel and
Berkeley in Richard III, ap
peared again as the executioners.
The narration was written and
presented by Carillo Gantner in
an easy fluid style that helped
link the scenes thematically. It
was sufficient without being in
trusive. Steven Vickers' setting
was remarkable. His draped
walls and the ugly, black-brick
front behind the playing area
were appropriate lor every scene
and served to initiate the sense
of evil even while the audience
was being seated.
All of this resulted in a to
tally absorbing evening of fine
theatre. If ever one wished for
continued production, it was for
this show. Perchance Mr. Mor
gan will see fit to resurrect it in
the future.

Anne at the funeral of her fath
er-in-law, one of Richard's vic
tims. Joe Medalis as Richard and
Ruth Hunt as Lady Anne must
confront each other in a scene
inherently grotesque. Richard
has murdered Anne's husband
and father-in-law and his evil is
obvious and well-planned. Yet
his wicked charm and persuasion
are his most effective weapons

in forcing Anne to accept his
misshapen mind and body as
husband and king.
His assault on her hatred is
climaxed when, on his knee, he
offers her a dagger, that she
might kill him or order his sui
cide. Friday evening, Lady Anne
was too child-like in her rejec
tion of the dagger and her loath
ing for Richard was transferred
to the blade itself. Her compo
sure as a royal widow lapsed
into squeamishness. In the other
two performances, however,
Lady Anne was played with con
sumate poise and intensity and
the emotional force of her sub
mission equalled the force of
Richard's insidious urgings.
Superb Portrayal
Medalis' portrayal was superb
in its execution and devastating
in its sacrifice of love to power.
Medalis infused Richard with the
monumental pride that he must
have to attempt the seemingly
impossible task of wooing and
winning Lady Anno at the very
height of her passionate disgust
for him. Medalis and Mrs. Hunt
capably used the absurdity of
the situation to make it work.
Preserving the thread of vil
liany established by Richard,
Morgan next presented the
"more complex and less ob
vious" evil of lago. He selected
the crucial moments in Act 111,
Scene three, where lago first
suggests Desdemona's infidelity
to Othello. Medalis was lago,
and Sergei Tschernisch was
Othello. Of the three scenes pre
sented, Othello showed the most
consistent improvement over the
three nights. The timing and
movement were precise and well
played. The cloak of friendship
that surrounds Othello and lago
at this point in the play and
which could not be discarded de
spite playing the scene out of
context, became more apparent

with each production. Tscher
nisch established Othello's con
fidence as a commander and hus
band early in the scene. In con
trast, lago masterfully wormed
his suspicions into Othello's mind
and thus laid the foundation for
Othello's pitiable question, "Why
did I marry?"
Othello's Anguish
Finally, Morgan presented the
execution scene from the Duch
ass of Main. Medalis played Bo
sola, henchman to Ferdinand,
who was played by Kurt Smith.
If it seemed at times as though
the force of evil previously
established had been weakened
by splitting it among three char
acters, only two of whom are
seen, this feeling soon passed
when Medalis and Smith conspir
ed together to murder the Duch
ess. Indeed, the impression was
not of less villainy but of more.
Most Taxing Part
Medalis had reached his most
taxing part of the evening.
Having constructed Richard and
lago, he had to continue as Bo
sola and as the agent of Mor
gan's development of evil. His
success in all four roles was em
bodied in yet another, when, as
a tombmaker, he took the stage
completely hidden in a black
robe. He sat mournfully on the
Duchess' coffin and suddenly the
development had crested. Here
was all that we had seen: Rich
ard, lago, Bosola, and Ferdi
nand; the devil, evil, death, and
the worst potentialities of the
human mind.
Smith as the wolfish, half mad
Ferdinand conveyed the resolute
sentence of death and destruc
tion that was the perfect com
plement to Bosola. Miss Haefele
was excellent as the Duchess
striving to preserve her integ
rity and dignity in the face of
death. Miss Kemp's skills were
evident throughout but espe

cially in her hopeless efforts to
evoid a brutal execution.
Easy Fluid Style
Norbert Davidson and Howard
Brown who played Tressel and
Berkeley in Richard III, ap
peared again as the executioners.
The narration was written and
presented by Carillo Gantner in
an easy fluid style that helped
link the scenes thematically. It
was sufficient without being in
trusive. Steven Vickers' setting
was remarkable. His draped
walls and the ugly, black-brick
front behind the playing area
were appropriate lor every scene
and served to initiate the sense
of evil even while the audience
was being seated.
All of this resulted in a to
tally absorbing evening of fine
theatre. If ever one wished for
continued production, it was for
this show. Perchance Mr. Mor
gan will see fit to resurrect it in
the future.

Thus began the second The
atre-at-the-Museum production
presented last Thursday, Friday,

Museum's Meidel Room. Direc

MFA student, selected scenes
from Shakespeare's Richard 111
and Othello, and Webster's The
Dutchess of MalA to demon

villain figure in Renaissance
drama." A visit to the Meidel
Room for any one of the per

Difficult Scenes
Morgan was not easy on his
company. The scenes were diffi
cult, and the three-quarter stag
ing demanded movement and
positioning that enabled the
actors to relate not only to each
other but to all of the audience.
The action was intense and
complex, often subdued, almost
languid, yet just as often aggre
sive and brutal. From the open
ing moments of the production,
an impressive ensemble en
trance, each actor possessed a
presence, a command of the ma
terial and the character that
was rarely abandoned.
To illustrate the first type of
villainy, Morgan chose the open

coupled with Richard's brief but

Anne at the funeral of her fath
er-in-law, one of Richard's vic

for him. Medalis and Mrs. Hunt
capably used the absurdity of
the situation to make it work.
Preserving the thread of vil
liany established by Richard,
Morgan next presented the
"more complex and less ob
vious" evil of lago. He selected
the crucial moments in Act 111,
Scene three, where lago first
suggests Desdemona's infidelity
to Othello. Medalis was lago,
and Sergei Tschernisch was
Othello. Of the three scenes pre
sented, Othello showed the most
consistent improvement over the
three nights. The timing and
movement were precise and well
played. The cloak of friendship
that surrounds Othello and lago
at this point in the play and
which could not be discarded de
spite playing the scene out of
context, became more apparent

with each production. Tscher
nisch established Othello's con
fidence as a commander and hus
band early in the scene. In con
trast, lago masterfully wormed
his suspicions into Othello's mind
and thus laid the foundation for
Othello's pitiable question, "Why
did I marry?"
Othello's Anguish
Finally, Morgan presented the
execution scene from the Duch
ass of Main. Medalis played Bo
sola, henchman to Ferdinand,
who was played by Kurt Smith.
If it seemed at times as though
the force of evil previously
established had been weakened
by splitting it among three char
acters, only two of whom are
seen, this feeling soon passed
when Medalis and Smith conspir
ed together to murder the Duch
ess. Indeed, the impression was
not of less villainy but of more.
Most Taxing Part
Medalis had reached his most
taxing part of the evening.
Having constructed Richard and
lago, he had to continue as Bo
sola and as the agent of Mor
gan's development of evil. His
success in all four roles was em
bodied in yet another, when, as
a tombmaker, he took the stage
completely hidden in a black
robe. He sat mournfully on the
Duchess' coffin and suddenly the
development had crested. Here
was all that we had seen: Rich
ard, lago, Bosola, and Ferdi
nand; the devil, evil, death, and
the worst potentialities of the
human mind.
Smith as the wolfish, half mad
Ferdinand conveyed the resolute
sentence of death and destruc
tion that was the perfect com
plement to Bosola. Miss Haefele
was excellent as the Duchess
striving to preserve her integ
rity and dignity in the face of
death. Miss Kemp's skills were
evident throughout but espe

cially in her hopeless efforts to
evoid a brutal execution.
Easy Fluid Style
Norbert Davidson and Howard
Brown who played Tressel and
Berkeley in Richard III, ap
peared again as the executioners.
The narration was written and
presented by Carillo Gantner in
an easy fluid style that helped
link the scenes thematically. It
was sufficient without being in
trusive. Steven Vickers' setting
was remarkable. His draped
walls and the ugly, black-brick
front behind the playing area
were appropriate lor every scene
and served to initiate the sense
of evil even while the audience
was being seated.
All of this resulted in a to
tally absorbing evening of fine
theatre. If ever one wished for
continued production, it was for
this show. Perchance Mr. Mor
gan will see fit to resurrect it in
the future.
"Welcome to The Man Behind
the Mask, an evening of episodes
from Elizabethan and Jacobean
drama."
Thus began the second The
atre-at-the-Museum production
presented last Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday evenings in the
Museum's Meidel Room. Direc
tor Robert Morgan, second-year
MFA student, selected scenes
from Shakespeare's Richard 111
and Othello, and Webster's The
Dutchess of MalA to demon
strate 'the development of the
villain figure in Renaissance
drama." A visit to the Meidel
Room for any one of the per
formances was well worth it.
Difficult Scenes
Morgan was not easy on his
company. The scenes were diffi
cult, and the three-quarter stag
ing demanded movement and
positioning that enabled the
actors to relate not only to each
other but to all of the audience.
The action was intense and
complex, often subdued, almost
languid, yet just as often aggre
sive and brutal. From the open
ing moments of the production,
an impressive ensemble en
trance, each actor possessed a
presence, a command of the ma
terial and the character that
was rarely abandoned.
To illustrate the first type of
villainy, Morgan chose the open
ing soliloquy from Richard 111
coupled with Richard's brief but
successful courtship of Lady
Anne at the funeral of her fath
er-in-law, one of Richard's vic
tims. Joe Medalis as Richard and
Ruth Hunt as Lady Anne must
confront each other in a scene
inherently grotesque. Richard
has murdered Anne's husband
and father-in-law and his evil is
obvious and well-planned. Yet
his wicked charm and persuasion
are his most effective weapons

in forcing Anne to accept his
misshapen mind and body as
husband and king.
His assault on her hatred is
climaxed when, on his knee, he
offers her a dagger, that she
might kill him or order his sui
cide. Friday evening, Lady Anne
was too child-like in her rejec
tion of the dagger and her loath
ing for Richard was transferred
to the blade itself. Her compo
sure as a royal widow lapsed
into squeamishness. In the other
two performances, however,
Lady Anne was played with con
sumate poise and intensity and
the emotional force of her sub
mission equalled the force of
Richard's insidious urgings.
Superb Portrayal
Medalis' portrayal was superb
in its execution and devastating
in its sacrifice of love to power.
Medalis infused Richard with the
monumental pride that he must
have to attempt the seemingly
impossible task of wooing and
winning Lady Anno at the very
height of her passionate disgust
for him. Medalis and Mrs. Hunt
capably used the absurdity of
the situation to make it work.
Preserving the thread of vil

Morgan next presented the

by splitting it among three char
acters, only two of whom are
seen, this feeling soon passed
when Medalis and Smith conspir
ed together to murder the Duch
ess. Indeed, the impression was
not of less villainy but of more.
Most Taxing Part
Medalis had reached his most
taxing part of the evening.
Having constructed Richard and
lago, he had to continue as Bo
sola and as the agent of Mor
gan's development of evil. His
success in all four roles was em
bodied in yet another, when, as
a tombmaker, he took the stage
completely hidden in a black
robe. He sat mournfully on the
Duchess' coffin and suddenly the
development had crested. Here
was all that we had seen: Rich
ard, lago, Bosola, and Ferdi
nand; the devil, evil, death, and
the worst potentialities of the
human mind.
Smith as the wolfish, half mad
Ferdinand conveyed the resolute
sentence of death and destruc
tion that was the perfect com
plement to Bosola. Miss Haefele
was excellent as the Duchess
striving to preserve her integ
rity and dignity in the face of
death. Miss Kemp's skills were
evident throughout but espe

cially in her hopeless efforts to
evoid a brutal execution.
Easy Fluid Style
Norbert Davidson and Howard
Brown who played Tressel and
Berkeley in Richard III, ap
peared again as the executioners.
The narration was written and
presented by Carillo Gantner in
an easy fluid style that helped
link the scenes thematically. It
was sufficient without being in
trusive. Steven Vickers' setting
was remarkable. His draped
walls and the ugly, black-brick
front behind the playing area
were appropriate lor every scene
and served to initiate the sense
of evil even while the audience
was being seated.
All of this resulted in a to
tally absorbing evening of fine
theatre. If ever one wished for
continued production, it was for
this show. Perchance Mr. Mor
gan will see fit to resurrect it in
the future.
