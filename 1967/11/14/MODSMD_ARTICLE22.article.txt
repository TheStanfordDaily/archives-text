# Students Aid Group Interaction Study
## 
### 
More than 400 students are
taking part in a Stanford re
search study on social interac
tion. Hamit Fisek, research asso
ciate for the Lab for Social Re
search, has been conducting the
study since October.
Fisek, along with Murray Deb
ster of the department, recruited
the students from Western Civ
classes for $1.50 an hour.
"Ninety-two per cent of the
students in classes we contacted
agreed to take part," Webster
noted. "People do not seem to
participate for the money. A lot
of the students refuse payment."
The students were told that
an exceedingly large number of
participants were needed. They
were also told that the experi
ment was to be neither painful
nor uncomfortable.
The testing laboratory con
sists of an observation room,
wired with microphones at each
end, and containing a two-way
mirror. Observers record the
conversations of three students,
formulating a mathematical
irtodel from the conversations
that take place.

'"We are mainly concerned
with decision making and group
processes," Webster stated. "We
are not interested in studying
people directly, but only with
the interaction between people."
Part of the money used to
finance the research came from
the National Science Foundation.
In this study, as well as other
studies of social interaction, con
ditions are kept as natural as
possible, Webster explained. He
pointed o ut,however, the neces
sary steps that should be taken
to insure onjectivity in the stu
dies.
A sign "Please do not talk"
is on the bulletin board to dis
courage students from becom
ing acquainted with each other
before the study.
"We can only bring in maga
zines like Look and Life," Web
ster commented. "In a study
group people are supposed to
be total strangers. They form
impressions of ecah other if they
see each other reading such
magazines as Playboy or occa
sionally, a car magazine."
