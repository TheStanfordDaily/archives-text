# Marquess To Start
## Spirit Vital To Big Game Win Streak 
### NICK SELBY 
Will Stanford lose the Big
Game this year?
That question seems to be the
major concern for many stu
dents as Stanford and California
prepare for the 70th gridiron
classic between the two schools.
Stanford has several factors
on its side. The Indians are pres
ently 5-4 and 3-3 in the confer
ence, while Cal is 4-5 and 1-3
in the PAC-8. Desire for a win
ning season and a good confer
ence record gives the Tribe a
psychological advantage.
Stanford has also won Big
Game six times in a row, but
Card coach John Ralston fears
the odds against seven straight
wins in the Big Game series.
"Seven In '67" may be the
cheer that ignites the Tribe,
however.
The mental factor in this
year's Big Game seems to be
more important than ever. Ral
ston and Bear coach Ray Will
sey both feel the teams are an
even match in personnel and
ability.
Cards Knew They'd Win
Last year, Stanford took the
contest 13-7 on a swampish
Memorial Stadium field in Ber
keley. After the game, many
Stanford players said they
"knew" they were going to win.
They said they never considered
losing at all.
The mental assuredness made
a significant difference as the
Cards played their most flaw
less game of the season. This
year, mistakes at crucial times
have been the only thing keep
ing the Tribe from a 7-2 log.
Against UCLA for example,
a fumbled pitchout prevented a
score in the second quarter that
would have won the game.
Two fumbles and an inter
ception resulted in 17 enemy

points in the Army game, and a
15 yard punt gave Oregon State
the chance to win the first
game.
Rise To Peaks
But the uniqueness of the
Cal game for Stanford has
allowed the Indians to rise to
mental and physical peaks that
prevent those careless miscues
in the last six years.
Stanford players again
"know" they will win, and the
mistakes preventing victory in
the past should disappear.
In Stanford minds, then, vic
tory is certain. But Cal's squad
has demonstrated some brilli
ance on the field that can't be
overlooked.
Defense has been the Bears'
strongest point. Willsey named
tackle Bobby Crittendon, the
defensive captain, as his line
man of the year yesterday at
the Bay Area Sports Writers
luncheon.
Standouts In Loos
Crittendon, tackle Ed White,
and defensive ends Irby Augus
tine and Mike McCaffrey stood
out against USC in the Bears'
31-12 loss, and have made the
Bears rushing defense third best
in the PAC-8.
Linebacker Jim Featherston
led a Bear defense that dropped
San Jose quarterback Danny
Holman behind the line eight
times for a total loss of 73
yards.
Cal also recovered three of
four fumbles, intercepted four
passes, and blocked a punt in
the 30-6 win.
McCaffrey and defensive half
back Ken Wiedemann made two
of the interceptions. Wiedemann
leads the PAC-8 with six inter
ceptions.
On oflVnse, the Bears will suf
fer Saturday from the loss of
halfback Paul Williams, who suf

fered a broken arm against the
Spartans.
Williams was the Bears' lead
ing ground gainer with 432
yards, seventh best in the PAC
8. Williams has largely had to
make his own holes this season,
because the Berkeley offensive
line has not measured up to
Willsey's hopes. One of Cal's ma
jor weaknesses this year has
been its inability to launch sus
tained drives. Gary Fowler will
fill in for Williams.
Willsey has settled on sopho
more Randy Humphries as his
quarterback for the game Satur
day. Humphries and last year's

starter Barry Bronk have alter
nated throughout the season due
to injuries to Bronk. Humphries
has generally moved the team
better, however.
Humphries, who went all the
way against San Jose, does not
have Bronk's passing or total of
fensive statistics, although both
have the same completion per
centage.
Marquess To Start
Stanford has its own injury
problems on oflense, too. Mark
Marquess, who quarterbacked
the Cards in a lacklustre 17-14
win over Oregon, has received
the starting nod from Ralston.

Chuck Williams, the passing
magician who has sparked th 1
Indians in their best perfor
mances this year, has a knee
injury.
Ralston said yesterday that
he felt Williams would be able
to play, but how much and how
well he can play depends on how
the knee is Saturday morning,
and the game situation. He was
running yesterday.
Behind Marquess is a strong
backfield, consisting of fullback
Jack Root, the tri-captain whom
Ralston named yesterday his
most valuable back because of
his blocking ability, sophomores
Nate Kirtman and Howie Wil
liams at the half, and Gene
Washington at flanker.
Washington Second In Stats
Washington continues to trail
Cal split end Wayne Stewart by
only one catch in PAC-8 receiv
ing statistics. He has 38 grabs
for 473 yards, 17 yards behind
leader Earl McCoullough of
USC. Cal's defensive secondary
has given up more TD's in tho
air than any other team.
The strength of the running
backs and the blockers on the of
fensive line have allowed the
Cjirds to average 180 yards rush
ing a game, fifth best in the
PAC-8, while the Bears aver
aged close to half that, 98 yards
a game for ninth place.
Stanford hopes to tire the Bear
defense with ball control.
Both teams have strong pass
ing attacks. The clubs are close
in every other statistic except
pass defense and rushing, where
Stanford has a solid margin. If
that margin alone isn't enough
for victory, the Cards hope the
mental advantage along with it
will be.

ANONYMOUS PICTURE: This picture, which was mysteriously
sent to the "Daily" yesterday, was accompanied with a note stating
"missing: Stanford Axe seems right at home with Cal's Centennial
B .inner." Members of the Cal Band were seen snapping shots of
the Axe in front of Hoover Tower and the I<aw School on Sunday.
As efforts to recover the Axe proceed, Big Game events continue:
there was a band concert yesterday atop Hoo Tow, freshmen are
already guarding Lake Lag, and a "Bury the Bear" rally will be
held tomorrow at noon on White Plaza.

Behind Marquess is a strong
backfield, consisting of fullback
Jack Root, the tri-captain whom
Ralston named yesterday his
most valuable back because of
his blocking ability, sophomores
Nate Kirtman and Howie Wil
liams at the half, and Gene
Washington at flanker.
Washington Second In Stats
Washington continues to trail
Cal split end Wayne Stewart by
only one catch in PAC-8 receiv
ing statistics. He has 38 grabs
for 473 yards, 17 yards behind
leader Earl McCoullough of
USC. Cal's defensive secondary
has given up more TD's in tho
air than any other team.
The strength of the running
backs and the blockers on the of
fensive line have allowed the
Cjirds to average 180 yards rush
ing a game, fifth best in the
PAC-8, while the Bears aver
aged close to half that, 98 yards
a game for ninth place.
Stanford hopes to tire the Bear
defense with ball control.
Both teams have strong pass
ing attacks. The clubs are close
in every other statistic except
pass defense and rushing, where
Stanford has a solid margin. If
that margin alone isn't enough
for victory, the Cards hope the
mental advantage along with it
will be.

ANONYMOUS PICTURE: This picture, which was mysteriously
sent to the "Daily" yesterday, was accompanied with a note stating
"missing: Stanford Axe seems right at home with Cal's Centennial
B .inner." Members of the Cal Band were seen snapping shots of
the Axe in front of Hoover Tower and the I<aw School on Sunday.
As efforts to recover the Axe proceed, Big Game events continue:
there was a band concert yesterday atop Hoo Tow, freshmen are
already guarding Lake Lag, and a "Bury the Bear" rally will be
held tomorrow at noon on White Plaza.
Will Stanford lose the Big
Game this year?
That question seems to be the
major concern for many stu
dents as Stanford and California
prepare for the 70th gridiron
classic between the two schools.
Stanford has several factors
on its side. The Indians are pres
ently 5-4 and 3-3 in the confer
ence, while Cal is 4-5 and 1-3
in the PAC-8. Desire for a win
ning season and a good confer
ence record gives the Tribe a
psychological advantage.
Stanford has also won Big
Game six times in a row, but
Card coach John Ralston fears
the odds against seven straight
wins in the Big Game series.
"Seven In '67" may be the
cheer that ignites the Tribe,
however.
The mental factor in this
year's Big Game seems to be
more important than ever. Ral
ston and Bear coach Ray Will
sey both feel the teams are an
even match in personnel and
ability.
Cards Knew They'd Win
Last year, Stanford took the
contest 13-7 on a swampish
Memorial Stadium field in Ber
keley. After the game, many
Stanford players said they
"knew" they were going to win.
They said they never considered
losing at all.
The mental assuredness made
a significant difference as the
Cards played their most flaw
less game of the season. This
year, mistakes at crucial times
have been the only thing keep
ing the Tribe from a 7-2 log.
Against UCLA for example,
a fumbled pitchout prevented a
score in the second quarter that
would have won the game.
Two fumbles and an inter
ception resulted in 17 enemy

points in the Army game, and a
15 yard punt gave Oregon State
the chance to win the first
game.
Rise To Peaks
But the uniqueness of the
Cal game for Stanford has
allowed the Indians to rise to
mental and physical peaks that
prevent those careless miscues
in the last six years.
Stanford players again
"know" they will win, and the
mistakes preventing victory in
the past should disappear.
In Stanford minds, then, vic
tory is certain. But Cal's squad
has demonstrated some brilli
ance on the field that can't be
overlooked.
Defense has been the Bears'
strongest point. Willsey named
tackle Bobby Crittendon, the
defensive captain, as his line
man of the year yesterday at
the Bay Area Sports Writers
luncheon.
Standouts In Loos
Crittendon, tackle Ed White,
and defensive ends Irby Augus
tine and Mike McCaffrey stood
out against USC in the Bears'
31-12 loss, and have made the
Bears rushing defense third best
in the PAC-8.
Linebacker Jim Featherston
led a Bear defense that dropped
San Jose quarterback Danny
Holman behind the line eight
times for a total loss of 73
yards.
Cal also recovered three of
four fumbles, intercepted four
passes, and blocked a punt in
the 30-6 win.
McCaffrey and defensive half
back Ken Wiedemann made two
of the interceptions. Wiedemann
leads the PAC-8 with six inter
ceptions.
On oflVnse, the Bears will suf
fer Saturday from the loss of
halfback Paul Williams, who suf

fered a broken arm against the
Spartans.
Williams was the Bears' lead
ing ground gainer with 432
yards, seventh best in the PAC
8. Williams has largely had to
make his own holes this season,
because the Berkeley offensive
line has not measured up to
Willsey's hopes. One of Cal's ma
jor weaknesses this year has
been its inability to launch sus
tained drives. Gary Fowler will
fill in for Williams.
Willsey has settled on sopho
more Randy Humphries as his
quarterback for the game Satur
day. Humphries and last year's

starter Barry Bronk have alter
nated throughout the season due
to injuries to Bronk. Humphries
has generally moved the team
better, however.
Humphries, who went all the
way against San Jose, does not
have Bronk's passing or total of
fensive statistics, although both
have the same completion per
centage.
Marquess To Start
Stanford has its own injury
problems on oflense, too. Mark
Marquess, who quarterbacked
the Cards in a lacklustre 17-14
win over Oregon, has received
the starting nod from Ralston.

Chuck Williams, the passing
magician who has sparked th 1
Indians in their best perfor
mances this year, has a knee
injury.
Ralston said yesterday that
he felt Williams would be able
to play, but how much and how
well he can play depends on how
the knee is Saturday morning,
and the game situation. He was
running yesterday.
Behind Marquess is a strong
backfield, consisting of fullback
Jack Root, the tri-captain whom
Ralston named yesterday his
most valuable back because of

the 30-6 win.
McCaffrey and defensive half
back Ken Wiedemann made two
of the interceptions. Wiedemann
leads the PAC-8 with six inter
ceptions.
On oflVnse, the Bears will suf
fer Saturday from the loss of
halfback Paul Williams, who suf

fered a broken arm against the
Spartans.
Williams was the Bears' lead
ing ground gainer with 432
yards, seventh best in the PAC
8. Williams has largely had to
make his own holes this season,
because the Berkeley offensive
line has not measured up to
Willsey's hopes. One of Cal's ma
jor weaknesses this year has
been its inability to launch sus
tained drives. Gary Fowler will
fill in for Williams.
Willsey has settled on sopho
more Randy Humphries as his
quarterback for the game Satur
day. Humphries and last year's

starter Barry Bronk have alter
nated throughout the season due
to injuries to Bronk. Humphries
has generally moved the team
better, however.
Humphries, who went all the
way against San Jose, does not
have Bronk's passing or total of
fensive statistics, although both
have the same completion per
centage.
Marquess To Start
Stanford has its own injury
problems on oflense, too. Mark
Marquess, who quarterbacked
the Cards in a lacklustre 17-14
win over Oregon, has received
the starting nod from Ralston.

Chuck Williams, the passing
magician who has sparked th 1
Indians in their best perfor
mances this year, has a knee
injury.
Ralston said yesterday that
he felt Williams would be able
to play, but how much and how
well he can play depends on how
the knee is Saturday morning,
and the game situation. He was
running yesterday.
Behind Marquess is a strong
backfield, consisting of fullback
Jack Root, the tri-captain whom
Ralston named yesterday his
most valuable back because of
his blocking ability, sophomores
Nate Kirtman and Howie Wil
liams at the half, and Gene
Washington at flanker.
Washington Second In Stats
Washington continues to trail
Cal split end Wayne Stewart by
only one catch in PAC-8 receiv
ing statistics. He has 38 grabs
for 473 yards, 17 yards behind
leader Earl McCoullough of
USC. Cal's defensive secondary
has given up more TD's in tho
air than any other team.
The strength of the running
backs and the blockers on the of
fensive line have allowed the
Cjirds to average 180 yards rush
ing a game, fifth best in the
PAC-8, while the Bears aver
aged close to half that, 98 yards
a game for ninth place.
Stanford hopes to tire the Bear
defense with ball control.
Both teams have strong pass
ing attacks. The clubs are close
in every other statistic except
pass defense and rushing, where
Stanford has a solid margin. If
that margin alone isn't enough
for victory, the Cards hope the
mental advantage along with it
will be.

ANONYMOUS PICTURE: This picture, which was mysteriously
sent to the "Daily" yesterday, was accompanied with a note stating
"missing: Stanford Axe seems right at home with Cal's Centennial
B .inner." Members of the Cal Band were seen snapping shots of
the Axe in front of Hoover Tower and the I<aw School on Sunday.
As efforts to recover the Axe proceed, Big Game events continue:
there was a band concert yesterday atop Hoo Tow, freshmen are
already guarding Lake Lag, and a "Bury the Bear" rally will be
held tomorrow at noon on White Plaza.
Will Stanford lose the Big
Game this year?
That question seems to be the
major concern for many stu
dents as Stanford and California
prepare for the 70th gridiron
classic between the two schools.
Stanford has several factors
on its side. The Indians are pres
ently 5-4 and 3-3 in the confer
ence, while Cal is 4-5 and 1-3
in the PAC-8. Desire for a win
ning season and a good confer
ence record gives the Tribe a
psychological advantage.
Stanford has also won Big
Game six times in a row, but
Card coach John Ralston fears
the odds against seven straight
wins in the Big Game series.
"Seven In '67" may be the
cheer that ignites the Tribe,
however.
The mental factor in this
year's Big Game seems to be
more important than ever. Ral
ston and Bear coach Ray Will
sey both feel the teams are an
even match in personnel and
ability.
Cards Knew They'd Win
Last year, Stanford took the
contest 13-7 on a swampish
Memorial Stadium field in Ber
keley. After the game, many
Stanford players said they
"knew" they were going to win.
They said they never considered
losing at all.
The mental assuredness made
a significant difference as the
Cards played their most flaw
less game of the season. This
year, mistakes at crucial times
have been the only thing keep
ing the Tribe from a 7-2 log.
Against UCLA for example,
a fumbled pitchout prevented a
score in the second quarter that
would have won the game.
Two fumbles and an inter
ception resulted in 17 enemy

points in the Army game, and a
15 yard punt gave Oregon State
the chance to win the first
game.
Rise To Peaks
But the uniqueness of the
Cal game for Stanford has
allowed the Indians to rise to
mental and physical peaks that
prevent those careless miscues
in the last six years.
Stanford players again
"know" they will win, and the
mistakes preventing victory in
the past should disappear.
In Stanford minds, then, vic
tory is certain. But Cal's squad
has demonstrated some brilli
ance on the field that can't be
overlooked.
Defense has been the Bears'
strongest point. Willsey named
tackle Bobby Crittendon, the
defensive captain, as his line
man of the year yesterday at
the Bay Area Sports Writers
luncheon.
Standouts In Loos
Crittendon, tackle Ed White,
and defensive ends Irby Augus
tine and Mike McCaffrey stood
out against USC in the Bears'
31-12 loss, and have made the
Bears rushing defense third best
in the PAC-8.
Linebacker Jim Featherston
led a Bear defense that dropped
San Jose quarterback Danny
Holman behind the line eight
times for a total loss of 73
yards.
Cal also recovered three of
four fumbles, intercepted four
passes, and blocked a punt in
the 30-6 win.
McCaffrey and defensive half
back Ken Wiedemann made two
of the interceptions. Wiedemann
leads the PAC-8 with six inter

"knew" they were going to win.
They said they never considered
losing at all.
The mental assuredness made
a significant difference as the
Cards played their most flaw
less game of the season. This
year, mistakes at crucial times
have been the only thing keep
ing the Tribe from a 7-2 log.
Against UCLA for example,
a fumbled pitchout prevented a
score in the second quarter that
would have won the game.
Two fumbles and an inter
ception resulted in 17 enemy

points in the Army game, and a
15 yard punt gave Oregon State
the chance to win the first
game.
Rise To Peaks
But the uniqueness of the
Cal game for Stanford has
allowed the Indians to rise to
mental and physical peaks that
prevent those careless miscues
in the last six years.
Stanford players again
"know" they will win, and the
mistakes preventing victory in
the past should disappear.
In Stanford minds, then, vic
tory is certain. But Cal's squad
has demonstrated some brilli
ance on the field that can't be
overlooked.
Defense has been the Bears'
strongest point. Willsey named
tackle Bobby Crittendon, the
defensive captain, as his line
man of the year yesterday at
the Bay Area Sports Writers
luncheon.
Standouts In Loos
Crittendon, tackle Ed White,
and defensive ends Irby Augus
tine and Mike McCaffrey stood
out against USC in the Bears'
31-12 loss, and have made the
Bears rushing defense third best
in the PAC-8.
Linebacker Jim Featherston
led a Bear defense that dropped
San Jose quarterback Danny
Holman behind the line eight
times for a total loss of 73
yards.
Cal also recovered three of
four fumbles, intercepted four
passes, and blocked a punt in
the 30-6 win.
McCaffrey and defensive half
back Ken Wiedemann made two
of the interceptions. Wiedemann
leads the PAC-8 with six inter
ceptions.
On oflVnse, the Bears will suf
fer Saturday from the loss of
halfback Paul Williams, who suf

fered a broken arm against the
Spartans.
Williams was the Bears' lead
ing ground gainer with 432
yards, seventh best in the PAC
8. Williams has largely had to
make his own holes this season,
because the Berkeley offensive
line has not measured up to
Willsey's hopes. One of Cal's ma
jor weaknesses this year has
been its inability to launch sus
tained drives. Gary Fowler will
fill in for Williams.
Willsey has settled on sopho
more Randy Humphries as his
quarterback for the game Satur
day. Humphries and last year's

starter Barry Bronk have alter
nated throughout the season due
to injuries to Bronk. Humphries
has generally moved the team
better, however.
Humphries, who went all the
way against San Jose, does not
have Bronk's passing or total of
fensive statistics, although both
have the same completion per
centage.
Marquess To Start
Stanford has its own injury
problems on oflense, too. Mark
Marquess, who quarterbacked
the Cards in a lacklustre 17-14
win over Oregon, has received
the starting nod from Ralston.

Chuck Williams, the passing
magician who has sparked th 1
Indians in their best perfor
mances this year, has a knee
injury.
Ralston said yesterday that
he felt Williams would be able
to play, but how much and how
well he can play depends on how
the knee is Saturday morning,
and the game situation. He was
running yesterday.
Behind Marquess is a strong
backfield, consisting of fullback
Jack Root, the tri-captain whom
Ralston named yesterday his
most valuable back because of
his blocking ability, sophomores
Nate Kirtman and Howie Wil
liams at the half, and Gene
Washington at flanker.
Washington Second In Stats
Washington continues to trail
Cal split end Wayne Stewart by
only one catch in PAC-8 receiv
ing statistics. He has 38 grabs
for 473 yards, 17 yards behind
leader Earl McCoullough of
USC. Cal's defensive secondary
has given up more TD's in tho
air than any other team.
The strength of the running
backs and the blockers on the of
fensive line have allowed the
Cjirds to average 180 yards rush
ing a game, fifth best in the
PAC-8, while the Bears aver
aged close to half that, 98 yards
a game for ninth place.
Stanford hopes to tire the Bear
defense with ball control.
Both teams have strong pass
ing attacks. The clubs are close
in every other statistic except
pass defense and rushing, where
Stanford has a solid margin. If
that margin alone isn't enough
for victory, the Cards hope the
mental advantage along with it
will be.

ANONYMOUS PICTURE: This picture, which was mysteriously
sent to the "Daily" yesterday, was accompanied with a note stating
"missing: Stanford Axe seems right at home with Cal's Centennial
B .inner." Members of the Cal Band were seen snapping shots of
the Axe in front of Hoover Tower and the I<aw School on Sunday.
As efforts to recover the Axe proceed, Big Game events continue:
there was a band concert yesterday atop Hoo Tow, freshmen are
already guarding Lake Lag, and a "Bury the Bear" rally will be
held tomorrow at noon on White Plaza.
Will Stanford lose the Big
Game this year?
That question seems to be the
major concern for many stu
dents as Stanford and California
prepare for the 70th gridiron
classic between the two schools.
Stanford has several factors
on its side. The Indians are pres
ently 5-4 and 3-3 in the confer
ence, while Cal is 4-5 and 1-3
in the PAC-8. Desire for a win
ning season and a good confer
ence record gives the Tribe a
psychological advantage.
Stanford has also won Big
Game six times in a row, but
Card coach John Ralston fears
the odds against seven straight
wins in the Big Game series.
"Seven In '67" may be the
cheer that ignites the Tribe,
however.
The mental factor in this
year's Big Game seems to be
more important than ever. Ral
ston and Bear coach Ray Will
sey both feel the teams are an
even match in personnel and
ability.
Cards Knew They'd Win
Last year, Stanford took the
contest 13-7 on a swampish
Memorial Stadium field in Ber
keley. After the game, many
Stanford players said they
"knew" they were going to win.
They said they never considered
losing at all.
The mental assuredness made
a significant difference as the
Cards played their most flaw
less game of the season. This
year, mistakes at crucial times
