# Judicial Council Voids Cheerleader Election
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
The contested election for head
cheerleader was declared in
valid last night by the ASSU
Judicial Council.
A new primary election for the
position will be part of the sche
duled election tomorrow and
Thursday to break the tie for
two legislature seats.
The Council was also slated to
announce the hearing date for
the nine students charged with
university violations stemming
from the Nov. 1 demonstration
against the Central Intelligence
Agency.
There was "at least one" cam
paign violation of a candidate
spending more than the $20
limit stated in ASSU by-laws, ac
cording to John Raskin, Judi
cial Council chairman who an
nounced the decision.

The entire election was nulli
fied because candidates were not
given proper campaign instruc
tions until ten days after formal
campaigning began, Raskin
stated.
Campaigning began with the
cheer tryout by the seven hope
fuls at the UCLA football game
on Oct. 21. The candidates were
not callcd together for a rules
meeting until Nov. 1.
The apparent reason for the
delay was that Craig Brown,
elections commissioner, was not
appointed to his post until Oct.
30. Brown immediately called a
meeting of the candidates, but
the Council ruled that this de
lay cast doubt on the election's
outcome.
Brown stated late last night
that he will contest the Council's
decision. By-laws do not state

when candidates must be given
the rules, Brown claimed. Skip
Tammany, Brown's assistant,
said that they will take their
case tomorrow "to whoever will
listen."
Brown said that he read the
campaign regulations to six of
the seven candidates at the Nov.
1 meeting.
By this time, however, some
of the candidates may have ex
ceeded the legal limit on cam
paign expenditures.
Raskin announced that all
seven candidates can spend no
more funds for tomorrow's pri
mary or next week's final elec
tion, if needed. Electioneering
will be restricted to personal
campaigning.
In the CIA demonstrators'

outcome.
Brown stated late last night
that he will contest the Council's
decision. By-laws do not state

when candidates must be given
the rules, Brown claimed. Skip
Tammany, Brown's assistant,
said that they will take their
case tomorrow "to whoever will
listen."
Brown said that he read the
campaign regulations to six of
the seven candidates at the Nov.
1 meeting.
By this time, however, some
of the candidates may have ex
ceeded the legal limit on cam
paign expenditures.
Raskin announced that all
seven candidates can spend no
more funds for tomorrow's pri
mary or next week's final elec
tion, if needed. Electioneering
will be restricted to personal
campaigning.
In the CIA demonstrators'
case, an open hearing was to be
set by the Council late last night.
The contested election for head
cheerleader was declared in
valid last night by the ASSU
Judicial Council.
A new primary election for the
position will be part of the sche
duled election tomorrow and
Thursday to break the tie for
two legislature seats.
The Council was also slated to
announce the hearing date for
the nine students charged with
university violations stemming
from the Nov. 1 demonstration
against the Central Intelligence
Agency.
There was "at least one" cam
paign violation of a candidate
spending more than the $20
limit stated in ASSU by-laws, ac
cording to John Raskin, Judi
cial Council chairman who an
nounced the decision.

The entire election was nulli
fied because candidates were not
given proper campaign instruc
tions until ten days after formal
campaigning began, Raskin
stated.
Campaigning began with the
cheer tryout by the seven hope
fuls at the UCLA football game
on Oct. 21. The candidates were
not callcd together for a rules
meeting until Nov. 1.
The apparent reason for the
delay was that Craig Brown,
elections commissioner, was not
appointed to his post until Oct.
30. Brown immediately called a
meeting of the candidates, but
the Council ruled that this de
lay cast doubt on the election's
outcome.
