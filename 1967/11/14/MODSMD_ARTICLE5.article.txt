# University Financing
## Solutions To Cost Rise Sought 
### KIRK HANSON (Second of Two Articles) 
There are many proposed ans
wers to today's financial squeeze
on private universities and col
leges, but there are still no real
solutions.
This year many institutions
contemplate deficit spending and
others face drastic increases in
tuition or severe cutbacks in edu
cational programs.
Rising costs have forced Stan
ford to project an 8% per year
rise in tuition over the next
three years. The Vietnam War
and congressional indecision last

week forced Provost Richard Ly
man to direct university projects
dependent on federal funds to
restrict expenditures until Con
gress appropriates the money
to federal higher education pro
grams.
While Stanford's endowment
continues to provide its 18% to
the University operating expend
itures, most of Stanford's hope
for additional funds rests with
gifts. Last year total private giv
ing amounted to $21.6 million
dollars and provided 30% of
the operating expenditures.
The Controller's Office has set

Stanford's gift needs at $25.8
million for the next year, but
few seem confident that these
funds will be received.
Meanwhile Stanford officials
and financial experts nationwide
are considering several proposals
for massive federal fianancing
programs.
Probably the best known is
the "Brewster Plan," proposed
in speeches across the U.S. by
Yale President Kingman Brew
ster. His proposal calls for stu
dents to pay the full cost of edu
cating themselves. This figure
might run from $4000 to over
$6000 depending on the univer
sity.
Annual Surcharge
Students would borrow that
amount, plus room and board
charges, from the federal gov
ernment and would repay it
throughout their lives with an
annual surcharge on their in
come taxes. The higher amount
paid by those who made more
and lived longer would offset
those who earn little or die
young.
Early in September a White
House advisory panel recom
mended the federal government
adopt a modified program simi
lar to the "Brewster Plan." The
proposal called for the estab
lishment of an Educational Op
portunity Bank authorized to
borrow money at going rates.
The bank would lend money to

any undergraduate college or
postsecondary student for financ
ing his education in return for
an agreement by the student to
pay back a small percentage of
his annual income for 30 or 40
years after graduation.
The plan was designed to
make it easier for colleges to
raise their tuition and other
charges. With students able to
borrow all the money they need
for their education, both public
and private institutions would
no longer feel obliged to keep
prices as low as possible and stu
dents might conceivably pay the
full cost of their education.
Strong Opposition
Stiff opposition to the Educa
tional Opportunity Bank imme
diately arose from two power
ful college associations. A joint
statement rejecting the recom
mendation was released by the
National Association of State
Universities and Land Grant Col
leges and the Association of
State Colleges and Universities.
The two associations represent
more than 300 institutions of
higher education enrolling more
than half of all U.S. students. An
official for the American Asso
ciation of Junior Colleges also
opposed the proposal.
The public institutions charg
ed the bank "would on one hand
destroy the whole concept of
public higher education, and on
the other, if successful, destroy
the whole basis of voluntary
support for private higher edu
cation."
Last month Rep. John Con
vers, Jr. (D-Mich.) introduced
in Congress a higher educa
tion bill authorizing the estab
lishment of a special loan pro
gram to finance students' post
secondary education. Any stu
dent attending a post-secondary
