## Slanted Observer 
### Philip Taubman 
Look, parents, look.
Read, alumni, read.
The Stanford Observer is
here. Everything is fine at Stan
ford.
See how Stanford makes
money.
See how students conform.
See how SES works.
See how many students are
registered.
But come quick and read
about the Hoover Institution.
There is a new building. It
has arches.
Many people say nice things
about it. People like the Insti
tution.
Read about the conference. It
is good. Many people spoke.
Everyone praised everything.
The Hoover Institution is
good. It is nice. Look how ob
jective it is.
I am happy. I will give Stan
ford more money.

Stanford University ought to
be ashamed of itself. Anyone
can understand that it wants
to keep parents and alumni in
formed about campus news, and
one can even understand that it
likes to keep parents and alum
ni happy so they will give
money. But to combine both de
sires in the printed word is not
to publish a newspaper.
It is impossible to complain
that the Observer has not
printed legitimate news. But it
is unquestionable that it has
emphasized both in word and
presentation the sweet and tidy
stories about the University.
The University has a right to
print anything it wants. But it
has absolutely no right to de
ceive the reader about the con

tent of what it's printing. Par
ents and alumni should be in
formed that The Observer is
carefully catered to their de
sires and is, in essence, a pre
sentation of the news as the
University would like to see it
presented.
This month's issue includes
a flagrant example of such de
ceit. There is a four page sup
plement on the Hoover Institu
tion. It was financed by the In
stitution and prepared with the
support of the University News
and Publication Service.
The Hoover Institution is en
titled to pay for whatever it
wants and the Observer should
print whatever the Institution
desires. But since when have ad
vertisements been printed as
news supplements? The whole
presentation is a far cry from
any kind of professional jour
nalism.
The Institution held a con
ference and dedicated a build
ing. Those activities were re
ported by the News and Publi
cations Service. So far so good.
But suddenly the Institution is
paying for that coverage and
what should be an independent
report becomes a four page ad
vertisement. It's much like hav
ing the New York Times report
a speech by President Johnson
in the form of a paid announce
ment by the White House.
The immediate response to
this argument will be: but the
News and Publications Service
and the Hoover Institution are
part of the same organization
so there can be no conflict of
interest. Such an argument
totally invalidates any claims
the University may make that

the Observer is a "newspaper."
If it is, this case makes it a
complete prostitution of jour
nalism.
If Stanford prints an adver
tisement as a news supplement,
it has a very great responsibil
ity to inform the reader there
may be another side to the story
being covered.
The Editor of the Observer,
Harry Press, says that the sole
purpose of the supplement was
to cover the dedication of the
Lou Henry Hoover Buliding and
the conference on "Fifty Years
of Communism in Russia."
What then is all the material
on page D? There is only one
story related to either the dedi
cation or the conference and
that covers at most a tenth of
the page.
Mr. Press and the News and
Publication Service know very
well that the Hoover Institu
tion has been the subject of
great controversy. If they print
so much on the Institution, they
must inform the reader that the
Institution is a controversial
subject and they should even
print something extended ex
plaining the controversy.
If the Observer is to be any
thing more than a propaganda
organ for Stanford it must
meet the basic standards of
journalism. I challenge Mr.
Press and Stanford to present
the criticisms of the Hoover In
stitution in the next issue of
the Observer. I also submit this
column as a letter to the editor
for publication in that same
issue.
Let's grow up around here
and stop pretending we're living
in a Utopia.
Look, parents, look.
Read, alumni, read.

stories about the University.
The University has a right to
print anything it wants. But it
has absolutely no right to de
ceive the reader about the con

tent of what it's printing. Par
ents and alumni should be in
formed that The Observer is
carefully catered to their de
sires and is, in essence, a pre
sentation of the news as the
University would like to see it
presented.
This month's issue includes
a flagrant example of such de
ceit. There is a four page sup
plement on the Hoover Institu
tion. It was financed by the In
stitution and prepared with the
support of the University News
and Publication Service.
The Hoover Institution is en
titled to pay for whatever it
wants and the Observer should
print whatever the Institution
desires. But since when have ad
vertisements been printed as
news supplements? The whole
presentation is a far cry from
any kind of professional jour
nalism.
The Institution held a con
ference and dedicated a build
ing. Those activities were re
ported by the News and Publi
cations Service. So far so good.
But suddenly the Institution is
paying for that coverage and
what should be an independent
report becomes a four page ad
vertisement. It's much like hav
ing the New York Times report
a speech by President Johnson
in the form of a paid announce
ment by the White House.
The immediate response to
this argument will be: but the
News and Publications Service
and the Hoover Institution are
part of the same organization
so there can be no conflict of
interest. Such an argument
totally invalidates any claims
the University may make that

the Observer is a "newspaper."
If it is, this case makes it a
complete prostitution of jour
nalism.
If Stanford prints an adver
tisement as a news supplement,
it has a very great responsibil
ity to inform the reader there
may be another side to the story
being covered.
The Editor of the Observer,
Harry Press, says that the sole
purpose of the supplement was
to cover the dedication of the
Lou Henry Hoover Buliding and
the conference on "Fifty Years
of Communism in Russia."
What then is all the material
on page D? There is only one
story related to either the dedi
cation or the conference and
that covers at most a tenth of
the page.
Mr. Press and the News and
Publication Service know very
well that the Hoover Institu
tion has been the subject of
great controversy. If they print
so much on the Institution, they
must inform the reader that the
Institution is a controversial
subject and they should even
print something extended ex
plaining the controversy.
If the Observer is to be any
thing more than a propaganda
organ for Stanford it must
meet the basic standards of
journalism. I challenge Mr.
Press and Stanford to present
the criticisms of the Hoover In
stitution in the next issue of
the Observer. I also submit this
column as a letter to the editor
for publication in that same
issue.
Let's grow up around here
and stop pretending we're living
in a Utopia.
Look, parents, look.
Read, alumni, read.
The Stanford Observer is
here. Everything is fine at Stan
ford.
See how Stanford makes
money.
See how students conform.
See how SES works.
See how many students are
registered.
But come quick and read
about the Hoover Institution.
There is a new building. It
has arches.
Many people say nice things
about it. People like the Insti
tution.
Read about the conference. It
is good. Many people spoke.
Everyone praised everything.
The Hoover Institution is
good. It is nice. Look how ob

I am happy. I will give Stan

Stanford University ought to
be ashamed of itself. Anyone
can understand that it wants
to keep parents and alumni in
formed about campus news, and
one can even understand that it
likes to keep parents and alum
ni happy so they will give
money. But to combine both de
sires in the printed word is not
to publish a newspaper.
It is impossible to complain
that the Observer has not
printed legitimate news. But it

ing the New York Times report
a speech by President Johnson
in the form of a paid announce
ment by the White House.
The immediate response to
this argument will be: but the
News and Publications Service
and the Hoover Institution are
part of the same organization
so there can be no conflict of
interest. Such an argument
totally invalidates any claims
the University may make that

the Observer is a "newspaper."
If it is, this case makes it a
complete prostitution of jour
nalism.
If Stanford prints an adver
tisement as a news supplement,
it has a very great responsibil
ity to inform the reader there
may be another side to the story
being covered.
The Editor of the Observer,
Harry Press, says that the sole
purpose of the supplement was
to cover the dedication of the
Lou Henry Hoover Buliding and
the conference on "Fifty Years
of Communism in Russia."
What then is all the material
on page D? There is only one
story related to either the dedi
cation or the conference and
that covers at most a tenth of
the page.
Mr. Press and the News and
Publication Service know very
well that the Hoover Institu
tion has been the subject of
great controversy. If they print
so much on the Institution, they
must inform the reader that the
Institution is a controversial
subject and they should even
print something extended ex
plaining the controversy.
If the Observer is to be any
thing more than a propaganda
organ for Stanford it must
meet the basic standards of
journalism. I challenge Mr.
Press and Stanford to present
the criticisms of the Hoover In
stitution in the next issue of
the Observer. I also submit this
column as a letter to the editor
for publication in that same
issue.
Let's grow up around here
and stop pretending we're living
in a Utopia.
Look, parents, look.
Read, alumni, read.
The Stanford Observer is
here. Everything is fine at Stan
ford.
See how Stanford makes
money.
See how students conform.
See how SES works.
See how many students are
registered.
But come quick and read
about the Hoover Institution.
There is a new building. It
has arches.
Many people say nice things
about it. People like the Insti
tution.
Read about the conference. It
is good. Many people spoke.
Everyone praised everything.
The Hoover Institution is
good. It is nice. Look how ob
jective it is.
I am happy. I will give Stan
ford more money.

Stanford University ought to
be ashamed of itself. Anyone
can understand that it wants
to keep parents and alumni in
formed about campus news, and
one can even understand that it
likes to keep parents and alum
ni happy so they will give
money. But to combine both de
sires in the printed word is not
to publish a newspaper.
It is impossible to complain
that the Observer has not
printed legitimate news. But it
is unquestionable that it has
emphasized both in word and
presentation the sweet and tidy
stories about the University.
The University has a right to
print anything it wants. But it
has absolutely no right to de
ceive the reader about the con

tent of what it's printing. Par
ents and alumni should be in
formed that The Observer is
carefully catered to their de
sires and is, in essence, a pre
sentation of the news as the
University would like to see it
presented.
This month's issue includes
a flagrant example of such de
ceit. There is a four page sup
plement on the Hoover Institu
tion. It was financed by the In
stitution and prepared with the
support of the University News
and Publication Service.
The Hoover Institution is en
titled to pay for whatever it
wants and the Observer should
print whatever the Institution
desires. But since when have ad
vertisements been printed as
news supplements? The whole
presentation is a far cry from
any kind of professional jour
nalism.
The Institution held a con
ference and dedicated a build
ing. Those activities were re
ported by the News and Publi
cations Service. So far so good.
But suddenly the Institution is
paying for that coverage and
what should be an independent
report becomes a four page ad
vertisement. It's much like hav
ing the New York Times report
a speech by President Johnson
in the form of a paid announce
ment by the White House.
