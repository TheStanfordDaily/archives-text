# Authorities Fear Big Game Trouble
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
University and student of
ficials expressed fear that vio
lence will erupt at Big Game if
the missing Stanford Axe is dis
played by its Berkeley captors.
They also expressed hope that
the Axe will be returned before
game time. "Cal officials are
just as anxious as we that the
Axe be returned before the
game," said Barbara Dray, as
sistant to the Dean of Students
yesterday.
She said there is a possibility
that if Cal officials get the Axe
they may turn it over to the
Stanford Axe Comm, so that it
can be displayed at the bonfire
and rally Friday evening. The
rally begins at 6:30 at Lake Lag.
But in a meeting last Friday,
Jim Miller, Cal's Rally Comm
Chairman, told Stanford stu
dents and officials that he had
no official knowledge of the
whereabouts of the Axe.
"I know he knows where it
is," said Neal Okabayashi, Axe
Comm Vicje President. "I am
optimistic that it will be re
tuned sometime before the
game," he added.
Okaybayshi also said the Axe
might be returned Saturday in
a ceremony before the game,
because "Cal thinks they are
going to win it back and they
may want to receive it ceremon
iously themselves."
He emphasized, however, that
the University, the Santa Clara
Police, and the Sheriff's Office
will be prepared if the Axe shows
up at the Game and trouble
seems imminent.
Today is "Red and White Day"
and will be celebrated with a
noon rally in White Plaza.
Everyone is urged to come and
display Stanford's colors. Frosh
dollies will be on hand to give
out "Beat Cal" stickers and but
tons.
Captains Arrested
Last weekend the co-captains
of Stanford's freshman football
team were arrested while paint
ing "S" and "Stanford" in large
red letters on the Cal football
stadium. Captains Jack Schultz
and Jim Collings were leading
a band of Stanford raiders com
posed mainly of members from
the team. Both leaders claim that
they will not be booked for the
prank.
Big Game hi jinks started on
the Stanford campus early Sun
day morning when Stanford po
lice apprehended four Cal stu
dents with 500 pounds of rock
salt and several gallons of paint
in their car.

The students confessed to
plans to paint the Stanford band
shack California blue and gold
and to burn UC's initials into
the turf of the Stanford stadium.
Their names were referred to
the dean of students at the Ber
keley campus.
Balloon Cannon
The water balloon cannon
which was constructed last
spring may also make an ap
pearance at the game. It is ru
mored that it will be used to
bombard the Cal bleachers with
colored water during the game.
The thing is rumored to be in
the possession of members of a
Stanford fraternity.
"We are going to try and stop
any effort to bring it into the sta
dium," said Okaybayashi.
Its inventors were former stu
dents and Professor Robert Mc-
Kim. The cannon has a range of
205 yards with excellent accura
cy, although gunners do have to
zero in on small targets with sev
eral shots. It weighs 20 pounds
and is powered by a compressed
air cylinder.
"A bazooka" is how is was de
scribed by Col. David Y. Nan
ney, Professor of Military Sci
ence. Nanny said, "ROTC is
prohibited in participating in
anything of this nature because
of the possibility of danger in
volved."
May Cause Harm
A doctor at the Cowell Student
Health Center, though he admit
ted to having no scientific knowl
edge pertaining to the cannon,
said that anything that is
thrown hard enough or fast
enough is bound to cause in
jury.
Last night in the pouring rain
Adam Bennion and his freshmen
guards stood watch over Lake
Lag. One car drove suspiciously
back and forth on roads close to
the lake, but disappeared after
only a few minutes. Bennion ex
pects at least 60 boys and 40
girls out tonight.
Meanwhile plans for the rest
of Big Game continue. The final
two presentations of this year's
Gaieties will be tomorrow and
Friday night in Mem Aud.
Friday night after the bonfire
the Inter-Fraternity Council is
sponsoring a dance in the area
behind the post office and Dink.
It will be free and will feature
the Initial Shock.
Saturday morning the deco
rations will be judged by Cardi
nals Board, and Saturday after
noon will be the culminating
event of the entire week, Big
Game.
