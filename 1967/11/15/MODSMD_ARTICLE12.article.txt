# Big Game Unreality
## 
### 
We sleep better every night this week know
ing that forty freshman guards patrol our cam
pus protecting it from the daring forays of
the feared Cal rooters.
However, our sympathy cannot help but fly
to those who lie sleepless at Berkeley awaiting
the needless damage of vandalism our sons will
inflict upon them. As Lyndon Johnson, we ask
ourselves before we go to bed each night, what
have we done to secure a lasting peace for our
campus.
While the long nights and cold mornings
provide wonderful opportunities for those Wil
bur freshmen to discover Lake Lag on the
other side of campus and the attractions of the
Roble dollies who live by the lake, they cast
freshmen into the midst of an unreality that
too often backfires.

The unreality has already backfired for a
few members of the freshman football team who
were caught splashing red paint around Cal
this last weekend. The Big Game unreality may
backfire for us all if the enjoyment of the week
turns to vandalism and violence.
The ridiculous suggestion that fights may
ensue Saturday if the Axe appears in the Cal
rooting section shows how far the unreality
has gone. We are also amazed that a powerful
cannon may blast water balloons from one
rooting section to the other, ignoring the in
juries that could easily occur as they have in
the past.
When will students grow up, put away their
petty vandalism, and quit attaching such all
important significance to a football game or
a spirit trophy? How far must the unreality
carry us?
