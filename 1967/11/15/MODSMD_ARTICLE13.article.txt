The "community meeting of the left" sche
duled for tonight in Cubberley Auditorium is
a direct outgrowth of failure.
The failure is that of the anti-war move
ments on campus — splintered and separated
from those they ought to represent — to arouse
any significant or widespread ire against the
CIA.
The open meeting is intended to draw in
more people, to attract their interest and to
stimulate their hopes that through concerted
community action here, the war might come to
an earlier end.
The meeting tonight is not being sponsored
by any particular protest group, and it is not

meant to attract coherents of any particular
viewpoint. The only common bond will be a
desire to end the war and improve our society.
Peace convocations in Memorial Church not
withstanding, the anti-war movement on this
campus is close to defunct. Dedication to a
just cause is waning, hope is vanishing and op
position to America's Vietnam policy is split
ting at the seams.
The meeting in Cubberlev tonight will, it is
hoped, begin to unify the anti-war movement
at Stanford. Perhaps it will give it a new re
solve. At the very least, it will bring people to
gether.
And that is as good a place as any to start
over again. — C. H.
