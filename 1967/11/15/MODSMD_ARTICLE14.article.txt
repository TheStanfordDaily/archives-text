# The 						Outpost
## Well-Meaning May Not Be Well-Doing 
### Louis Knowles 
Wes Pomeroy, Under-sheriff of
San Mateo County, is a good,
liberal man; he is a far cry from
the stereotyped cop that stu
dents saw in Oakland. For years
he has been working to impove
relations between the black com
munity and the white sheriff's
deputies that police unincorpor
ated East Palo Alto.
But Undersheriff Pomeroy is
losing his sight for a very simple
reason: he is trying to do the
impossible. He is attempting to
reform a colonial, racist insti
tution from the insides. His best
efforts can be nothing more
than stop-gap measures that
buy time.
Last July 31 after a night of
bitter clashes between black
citizens and white deputies in
East Palo Alto, Pomeroy made
a deal with a group of young
black men who called them
selves the Black Community Re
lations Association. Pomeroy
withdrew all extra patrols from
the area and the BCRA agreed
to stop the trouble which it did.
The BCRA set itself up dur
ing August as a sort of buffer
agent between the people and
the cops. Certain white people
including Wes Pomeroy agreed
to help find funds and equip
ment for the BCRA.
Just Cooperate
Mr. Pomeroy will tell you
there was $50,000 available from
private donors and the BCRA
could have it if it had only been
willing to cooperate with the
whites.
That is a rather incredible
figure and the fact is that the
BCRA never saw more than
$700 of the promised funds. It
wasn't willing to soften its black
power line because it knows it
is playing for bigger stakes;
and once black people stop play
ing the liberal game, whites,
even nice whites, won't support
them.
On October 28 after a night
of disturbances similar to those
in July but of lesser size, Un
dersheriff Pomeroy ordered into
East Palo Alto five times as
many patrol cars as are nor
mally stationed there. It seems
that a lot of Pomeroy's liberal
ity washed out of him since
July.

There was no question of
making a deal this time. Pom
eroy's reversion to the tough
line is evidence that he too has
become institutionalized. It
shows he is more concerned
about the job of keeping law
and order than he is about the
dignity and freedom of black
people.
And you can be sure that if
those priorities were reversed
he wouldn't keep his job long.
The best of community rela
tions programs is not going to
alter the fact that the sheriff's
force is a white institution
assigned the task of keeping
black people in line.
Political Problem
Desipte Mr. Pomeroy's efforts
the racial antagonisms have
grown rather than diminishing.
The answer is not a more liberal
sheirff's force but a black police
agency for black East Palo Alto.
And that is a political problem.
In a very real sense whites
like Mr. Pomeroy expect blacks
to be super-people. They ex
pected the BCRA to work with
a budget the equivalent of which
is spent on sheriff's deputies in
East Palo Alto in two or three
days. They thought the BCRA
could become an organization
acceptable to white liberals and
still lead the alienated black
youth.
The whites expect black peo
ple to be responsible when they
have no political power about
which to be responsible.
Give Them Autonomy
It is time for whites like Mr.
Pomeroy to get outside of their
structures at least in spirit and
to concentrate on the political
question of giving East Palo
Alto urban autonomy.
Black people do not by nature
hate authority, but they do hate
authority imposed from the out
side on their politically unrepre
sented city. And they recognize
a colonial force even if it is
decorated with human relations
programs and a well-meaning
undersheriff.
Too many black people have
looked down the barrel of riot
guns held by whites to see it
any other way.

ple to be responsible when they
have no political power about
which to be responsible.
Give Them Autonomy
It is time for whites like Mr.
Pomeroy to get outside of their
structures at least in spirit and
to concentrate on the political
question of giving East Palo
Alto urban autonomy.
Black people do not by nature
hate authority, but they do hate
authority imposed from the out
side on their politically unrepre
sented city. And they recognize
a colonial force even if it is
decorated with human relations
programs and a well-meaning
undersheriff.
Too many black people have
looked down the barrel of riot
guns held by whites to see it
any other way.
Wes Pomeroy, Under-sheriff of
San Mateo County, is a good,
liberal man; he is a far cry from
the stereotyped cop that stu
dents saw in Oakland. For years
he has been working to impove
relations between the black com
munity and the white sheriff's
deputies that police unincorpor
ated East Palo Alto.
But Undersheriff Pomeroy is
losing his sight for a very simple
reason: he is trying to do the
impossible. He is attempting to
reform a colonial, racist insti
tution from the insides. His best
efforts can be nothing more
than stop-gap measures that
buy time.
Last July 31 after a night of
bitter clashes between black
citizens and white deputies in
East Palo Alto, Pomeroy made
a deal with a group of young
black men who called them
selves the Black Community Re
lations Association. Pomeroy
withdrew all extra patrols from
the area and the BCRA agreed
to stop the trouble which it did.
The BCRA set itself up dur
ing August as a sort of buffer
agent between the people and
the cops. Certain white people
including Wes Pomeroy agreed
to help find funds and equip
ment for the BCRA.
Just Cooperate
Mr. Pomeroy will tell you
there was $50,000 available from
private donors and the BCRA
could have it if it had only been
willing to cooperate with the
whites.
That is a rather incredible
figure and the fact is that the
BCRA never saw more than
$700 of the promised funds. It
wasn't willing to soften its black
power line because it knows it
is playing for bigger stakes;
and once black people stop play
ing the liberal game, whites,
even nice whites, won't support
them.
On October 28 after a night
of disturbances similar to those
in July but of lesser size, Un
dersheriff Pomeroy ordered into
East Palo Alto five times as
many patrol cars as are nor
mally stationed there. It seems
that a lot of Pomeroy's liberal
ity washed out of him since
July.

There was no question of
making a deal this time. Pom
eroy's reversion to the tough
line is evidence that he too has
become institutionalized. It
shows he is more concerned
about the job of keeping law
and order than he is about the
dignity and freedom of black
people.
And you can be sure that if
those priorities were reversed
he wouldn't keep his job long.
The best of community rela
tions programs is not going to
alter the fact that the sheriff's
force is a white institution
assigned the task of keeping
black people in line.
Political Problem
Desipte Mr. Pomeroy's efforts
the racial antagonisms have
grown rather than diminishing.
The answer is not a more liberal
sheirff's force but a black police
agency for black East Palo Alto.
And that is a political problem.
In a very real sense whites
like Mr. Pomeroy expect blacks
to be super-people. They ex
pected the BCRA to work with
a budget the equivalent of which
is spent on sheriff's deputies in
East Palo Alto in two or three
days. They thought the BCRA
could become an organization
acceptable to white liberals and
still lead the alienated black
youth.

ple to be responsible when they
have no political power about

grown rather than diminishing.
The answer is not a more liberal
sheirff's force but a black police
agency for black East Palo Alto.
And that is a political problem.
In a very real sense whites
like Mr. Pomeroy expect blacks
to be super-people. They ex
pected the BCRA to work with
a budget the equivalent of which
is spent on sheriff's deputies in
East Palo Alto in two or three
days. They thought the BCRA
could become an organization
acceptable to white liberals and
still lead the alienated black
youth.
The whites expect black peo
ple to be responsible when they
have no political power about
which to be responsible.
Give Them Autonomy
It is time for whites like Mr.
Pomeroy to get outside of their
structures at least in spirit and
to concentrate on the political
question of giving East Palo
Alto urban autonomy.
Black people do not by nature
hate authority, but they do hate
authority imposed from the out
side on their politically unrepre
sented city. And they recognize
a colonial force even if it is
decorated with human relations
programs and a well-meaning
undersheriff.
Too many black people have
looked down the barrel of riot
guns held by whites to see it
any other way.
