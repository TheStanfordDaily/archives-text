## Black Student Union Intends Action 
### JOHNIE SCOTT 
(Mr. Scott is a member of the
Black Student Union.)
For those of you who are
still wondering about this so
called Stanford Black Student
Union, its effect upon the lives
of black folk, my hope is that
after reading the next few lines
you will be a whole lot wiser
on the issue.
The Black Student Union is
not a structure. It is not a series
of rules, or a fixed mode of be
havior. The Black Student Union
is not a melting-pot of ideas, nor
is it planned to constitute an
organ for black bourgeois intel
ligentsia fronts.
The Black Student Union is
every black face on this campus
involved in some sort of mean
ingful social action. This may
political action, if you want. Nev
er the less, the BSU is not apoli
tical. Politics are all a part
of social intercourse.
The Black Student Union pur
ports to represent the ideas of
every American black man and
woman — purports to do this in
the multivarigated nature of the
black faces within it, black folk
who themselves make up the
conscious elements of black so
ciety.
Bound At The Farm
This is not difficult to under
stand. In making up the con
scious elements of black society,
we Blacks are the elements for
Black Consciousness—a height
ened form of Racial Memory:
one that spans gerenations of
both right- and wrong-doing.
Black Consciousness, there
fore, in both the physical-active
and psychological-perverted na
ture of white people in general,
tends to bind black people at The

Farm, in the nature of life af
fairs we can participate in, as
student body card-holders, with
both the White world and
amongst ourselves.
It has not been the intent of
the Black Student Union to fost
er upon Whites some ideological
structure-unit. The sort of struc
tural unit that holds all the ans
wers. A chauvinistic posture,
held by the weakling in a world
of animals. If we did dare such
a thing, even here where Kiddie
Politics are played, we would no
doubt be devoured.
A Fantasy World
The Black Student Union
exists in a world of make-be
lieve. Here, on this campus, are
those people who believe within
their very Beings that they rep
resent tomorrow's leaders. Bank
presidents. Politicians. Econo
mists. Judges. Architects. Civil
Engineers. College professors.
And more, all of the same va
riety — the cream of the nation's
crop.
In this world, the illusory be
comes inseparable from the real
ity. Campus and off-campus
newspapers have a difficult time
in deciding whether they will
cater to local or world audiences.
The news becomes varied (in one
sense, this column, miltant
though it might be, does show
the strength of America's Assi
milation System — that it can
tolerate and even absorb black
militancy into a Daily column).
Why is this important to un
derstand? It is important to un
derstand because a Black Stu
dent Union, operating out of a
particular environmental psyche
that is the American black man.
Aberrated, forced (even uncon
sciously and in spite of himself)

to ape the mannerisms of White
People — Why, this same BSU
is either no more than a White
world's interpretation of black
justice or else, this BSU becomes
too dangerous to talk about.
Kenny Washington, in a col
umn last week, said that in
America, using all the rules of
social justice, allowing for the
passage of Time to absolve all
overt feelings of guilt and/or
shame, for those people, Red and
Black, who still feel the stirrings
of resistance in their breasts,
there could be no activity radi
cal enough to warrant censure
from the American public, active
or otherwise.
Now this meant that, in the
context of those members of
the SF State Black Student
Union who beat up the editor
of that school's newspaper and
who were later arrested, Theirs
was not an immoral act. It was
moral, considered from the van
tage point of: (a) Time, and (b)
Situation Ethics. Time itself does
not dim the racial memory (i.e.,
Black Consciousness) of The
Whip.
And Situation Ethics, consid
ered cooly and objectively, de
manded such action on the part
of the BSU'ers at SF State.
Those of you who still would
like to know why, all you have
to do is some investigating of
your own into that affair to un
derstand why it was a moral act.
But these are not the gains
we are after. To bathe oneself
in the blood of a Saxon is not
the sole aim of colored peoples.
There exists a higher ethic, call
it Oar Karma — it is the fused
physical perspective that sees
into all human situations.
I talk from one vantage point.

The slumchild. This affords me
an entirely different thought
process, and, from everyday ex
perience, a much quicker route
towards being effective with peo
ple. I did not come to Stanford
to be a diplomatic black man.
I came to Stanford so that my
fury could be absorbed into the
experiences of those around me,
enriching them while I, slowly,
became pallid/a Pale Man.
Within the next two weeks,
elections will be held in the

BSU. There will be new officers,
coming from a different genera
tion, and, in the light of present
times, a more militant/demand
ing life-attitude. The BSU Maga
zine, Black On Black, now on
sale, to a degree the way
of Us on this campus, felt about
the way things go down.
We are not that passive any
longer. Revolutionary thinkers
begin their work in their homes.
And the BSU knows it has to
start right here!

lieve. Here, on this campus, are
those people who believe within
their very Beings that they rep
resent tomorrow's leaders. Bank
presidents. Politicians. Econo
mists. Judges. Architects. Civil
Engineers. College professors.
And more, all of the same va
riety — the cream of the nation's
crop.
In this world, the illusory be
comes inseparable from the real
ity. Campus and off-campus
newspapers have a difficult time
in deciding whether they will
cater to local or world audiences.
The news becomes varied (in one
sense, this column, miltant
though it might be, does show
the strength of America's Assi
milation System — that it can
tolerate and even absorb black
militancy into a Daily column).
Why is this important to un
derstand? It is important to un
derstand because a Black Stu
dent Union, operating out of a
particular environmental psyche
that is the American black man.
Aberrated, forced (even uncon
sciously and in spite of himself)

to ape the mannerisms of White
People — Why, this same BSU
is either no more than a White
world's interpretation of black
justice or else, this BSU becomes
too dangerous to talk about.
Kenny Washington, in a col
umn last week, said that in
America, using all the rules of
social justice, allowing for the
passage of Time to absolve all
overt feelings of guilt and/or
shame, for those people, Red and
Black, who still feel the stirrings
of resistance in their breasts,
there could be no activity radi
cal enough to warrant censure
from the American public, active
or otherwise.
Now this meant that, in the
context of those members of
the SF State Black Student
Union who beat up the editor
of that school's newspaper and
who were later arrested, Theirs
was not an immoral act. It was
moral, considered from the van
tage point of: (a) Time, and (b)
Situation Ethics. Time itself does
not dim the racial memory (i.e.,
Black Consciousness) of The
Whip.
And Situation Ethics, consid
ered cooly and objectively, de
manded such action on the part
of the BSU'ers at SF State.
Those of you who still would
like to know why, all you have
to do is some investigating of
your own into that affair to un
derstand why it was a moral act.
But these are not the gains
we are after. To bathe oneself
in the blood of a Saxon is not
the sole aim of colored peoples.
There exists a higher ethic, call
it Oar Karma — it is the fused
physical perspective that sees
into all human situations.
I talk from one vantage point.

The slumchild. This affords me
an entirely different thought
process, and, from everyday ex
perience, a much quicker route
towards being effective with peo
ple. I did not come to Stanford
to be a diplomatic black man.
I came to Stanford so that my
fury could be absorbed into the
experiences of those around me,
enriching them while I, slowly,
became pallid/a Pale Man.
Within the next two weeks,
elections will be held in the

BSU. There will be new officers,
coming from a different genera
tion, and, in the light of present
times, a more militant/demand
ing life-attitude. The BSU Maga
zine, Black On Black, now on
sale, to a degree the way
of Us on this campus, felt about
the way things go down.
We are not that passive any
longer. Revolutionary thinkers
begin their work in their homes.
And the BSU knows it has to
start right here!

For those of you who are
still wondering about this so
called Stanford Black Student
Union, its effect upon the lives
of black folk, my hope is that
after reading the next few lines
you will be a whole lot wiser
on the issue.
The Black Student Union is
not a structure. It is not a series
of rules, or a fixed mode of be
havior. The Black Student Union
is not a melting-pot of ideas, nor
is it planned to constitute an
organ for black bourgeois intel
ligentsia fronts.
The Black Student Union is
every black face on this campus
involved in some sort of mean
ingful social action. This may
political action, if you want. Nev
er the less, the BSU is not apoli
tical. Politics are all a part
of social intercourse.
The Black Student Union pur
ports to represent the ideas of
every American black man and
woman — purports to do this in
the multivarigated nature of the
black faces within it, black folk
who themselves make up the
conscious elements of black so
ciety.
Bound At The Farm
This is not difficult to under
stand. In making up the con
scious elements of black society,
we Blacks are the elements for
Black Consciousness—a height
ened form of Racial Memory:
one that spans gerenations of
both right- and wrong-doing.
Black Consciousness, there
fore, in both the physical-active
and psychological-perverted na
ture of white people in general,
tends to bind black people at The

Farm, in the nature of life af
fairs we can participate in, as
student body card-holders, with
both the White world and
amongst ourselves.
It has not been the intent of
the Black Student Union to fost
er upon Whites some ideological
structure-unit. The sort of struc
tural unit that holds all the ans
wers. A chauvinistic posture,
held by the weakling in a world
of animals. If we did dare such
a thing, even here where Kiddie
Politics are played, we would no

Those of you who still would

The slumchild. This affords me
an entirely different thought

I came to Stanford so that my

Within the next two weeks,
elections will be held in the

For those of you who are
still wondering about this so
called Stanford Black Student
Union, its effect upon the lives
of black folk, my hope is that
after reading the next few lines
you will be a whole lot wiser
on the issue.
The Black Student Union is
not a structure. It is not a series
of rules, or a fixed mode of be
havior. The Black Student Union
is not a melting-pot of ideas, nor
is it planned to constitute an
organ for black bourgeois intel
ligentsia fronts.
The Black Student Union is
every black face on this campus
involved in some sort of mean
ingful social action. This may
political action, if you want. Nev
er the less, the BSU is not apoli
tical. Politics are all a part
of social intercourse.
The Black Student Union pur
ports to represent the ideas of
every American black man and
woman — purports to do this in
the multivarigated nature of the
black faces within it, black folk
who themselves make up the
conscious elements of black so
ciety.
Bound At The Farm
This is not difficult to under
stand. In making up the con
scious elements of black society,
we Blacks are the elements for
Black Consciousness—a height
ened form of Racial Memory:
one that spans gerenations of
both right- and wrong-doing.
Black Consciousness, there
fore, in both the physical-active
and psychological-perverted na
ture of white people in general,
tends to bind black people at The

Farm, in the nature of life af
fairs we can participate in, as
student body card-holders, with
both the White world and
amongst ourselves.
It has not been the intent of
the Black Student Union to fost
er upon Whites some ideological
structure-unit. The sort of struc
tural unit that holds all the ans
wers. A chauvinistic posture,
held by the weakling in a world
of animals. If we did dare such
a thing, even here where Kiddie
Politics are played, we would no
doubt be devoured.
A Fantasy World
The Black Student Union
exists in a world of make-be
lieve. Here, on this campus, are
those people who believe within
their very Beings that they rep
resent tomorrow's leaders. Bank
presidents. Politicians. Econo
mists. Judges. Architects. Civil
Engineers. College professors.
And more, all of the same va
riety — the cream of the nation's
crop.
In this world, the illusory be
comes inseparable from the real
ity. Campus and off-campus
newspapers have a difficult time
in deciding whether they will
cater to local or world audiences.
The news becomes varied (in one
sense, this column, miltant
though it might be, does show
the strength of America's Assi
milation System — that it can
tolerate and even absorb black
militancy into a Daily column).
Why is this important to un
derstand? It is important to un
derstand because a Black Stu
dent Union, operating out of a
particular environmental psyche
that is the American black man.
Aberrated, forced (even uncon
sciously and in spite of himself)

to ape the mannerisms of White
People — Why, this same BSU
is either no more than a White
world's interpretation of black
justice or else, this BSU becomes
too dangerous to talk about.
Kenny Washington, in a col
umn last week, said that in
America, using all the rules of
social justice, allowing for the
passage of Time to absolve all
overt feelings of guilt and/or
shame, for those people, Red and
Black, who still feel the stirrings
of resistance in their breasts,
there could be no activity radi
cal enough to warrant censure
from the American public, active
or otherwise.
Now this meant that, in the
context of those members of
the SF State Black Student
Union who beat up the editor
of that school's newspaper and
who were later arrested, Theirs
was not an immoral act. It was
moral, considered from the van
tage point of: (a) Time, and (b)
Situation Ethics. Time itself does
not dim the racial memory (i.e.,
Black Consciousness) of The

And Situation Ethics, consid
