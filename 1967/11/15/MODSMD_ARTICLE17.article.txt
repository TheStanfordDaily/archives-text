# Letters To The Editor
## Represent Many Opinions On Committee Of 15 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
This Thursday, November 16,
LASSU will select the five stu
dent members of the Committee
of Fifteen.
Essentially, the Committee of
Fifteen represents an effort to
establish a communications
bridge between the three major
segments of the Stanford com
munity (students, administra
tion and faculty). It does not
have any decision-making capa
city, although any unanimous
recommendations that it does
make are given a great deal of
consideration by the various ap
pointing powers of the Commit
tee, since they are, in theory,
representative of the views of
the entire community.
Unfortunately, we believe that
the student representatives to
the Committee in the past have
not always been representative
of the student body as a whole,
due to: (1) the efforts of active
minority groups to "push" one
point of view to the exclusion
of all others; and (2) the gen
eral apathy displayed by the ma
jority of students.
We believe that the student
members of the Committee will
not be able to operate effectively
unless they have the respect of
the Committee representatives
from the other two segments of
the community. In order to gain
that respect, they must be repre
sentative of as many of the di
verse points of view of their
fellows as possible.
Hopefully, any student with an
interest in this matter will speak
to his or her representative
about it, and all the representa
tives will be present at the
Thursday meeting.

Editor, The Daily:
At a time when University of
ficials bemoan the cuts in fed
eral loans and have a difficulty

in making ends meet, isn't it
possible for us, the students, to
help out?
Take, for instance, the new
library: here is a prime example
of a building that could be made
to pay its own way. I suggest
that for each fraternity initia
tion, prank or hoax the UGLY
levy a small charge. For each
ball game, ballet or opera in
volving more than one floor in
addition to the stage let the
charge be increased somewhat.
Or better still, why not build
a playpen outside for the chil
dren to play in? Why not have
the administration enforce a few
rules and maintain some silence
for those who don't want to
play?
I find it a little difficult to re
main polite when confronted
with the inconsiderate behaviour
that is exhibited in the library.

Perhaps there was some justifi
cation for these childish actions
when the library was newly
opened, but by now the thrill
should have worn off and been
replaced by a more serious at
titude.
The point of my letter should
be clear by now. Just how the
present state of affairs should
be changed I leave up to the li
brary staff—and if they are not
competent enough I suggest that
someone go and take a look at
Berkeley or one of the other uni
versities around here to see how
they cope with children.

Editor, The Daily:
Less than a year away from
student days on the Farm, I
am now teaching college English

in North Bengal and would glad
ly welcome any books your read
ers may want to dispose of at
the end of the autumn quarter.
Our library is perhaps the most
beautifully situated in the world,
seven thousand feet up in the
Himalayas with a picture-win
dow view of Kanchenjunga (28,-
150 ft.), but with too few books.
Many of our students are
from the surrounding areas of
Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Ti
bet, and they all read English,
the medium of instruction. Any
syllabus test of undergraduate
level in science, and of both un
dergraduate and graduate levels
in humanities, would be a great
help. My address is:

Editor, the Daily:
"This society is coming apart,"
or so says Bernard Wasow (Let
ter to the Editor, November 10,
1967). That's just great, Ber
nard, but why the implication
that this society (or any for
that matter) was ever together
(on anything)?
You state that the large mi
norities who used to absorb
and/or fight against "all kinds
of crap aren't doing that any
more." Rather, they're busy
blowing out their brains while
we "rich 'intellectual' middle
class white students" at Stan
ford are wasting our precious
time (the latest UPI release
states that the average Ameri
can—obviously limited to whites
—has a life expectancy of 63
years to save the world) on
nonsense.
But just maybe, Bernard, just

maybe all that crap and non
sense you speak of (electing
cheer leaders and smoking pot)
isn't really such "nonsense and
crap" after all. Perhaps it's
nothing but the world we "co
habitate" in. And, Bernard, did
you ever think that maybe it's
you and your deep concern for
misery and death who are wast
ing time on "nonsense and
crap?"
Well, best of luck in unifying
our society and prohibiting crap
and the like. Hopefully, how
ever, I will long have decom
posed back into nothingness—
Now I lie me down to sleep,/
I pray the Lord my soul to
keep./ If I should die before I
wake,/ I pray the Lord my soul
to take — when that happens.

Less than a year away from
student days on the Farm, I
am now teaching college English

in North Bengal and would glad
ly welcome any books your read
ers may want to dispose of at
the end of the autumn quarter.
Our library is perhaps the most
beautifully situated in the world,
seven thousand feet up in the
Himalayas with a picture-win
dow view of Kanchenjunga (28,-
150 ft.), but with too few books.
Many of our students are
from the surrounding areas of
Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan and Ti
bet, and they all read English,
the medium of instruction. Any
syllabus test of undergraduate
level in science, and of both un
dergraduate and graduate levels
in humanities, would be a great

"This society is coming apart,"
or so says Bernard Wasow (Let
ter to the Editor, November 10,
1967). That's just great, Ber
nard, but why the implication
that this society (or any for
that matter) was ever together
(on anything)?
You state that the large mi
norities who used to absorb
and/or fight against "all kinds
of crap aren't doing that any
more." Rather, they're busy
blowing out their brains while
we "rich 'intellectual' middle
class white students" at Stan
ford are wasting our precious
time (the latest UPI release
states that the average Ameri
can—obviously limited to whites
—has a life expectancy of 63
years to save the world) on
nonsense.
But just maybe, Bernard, just

maybe all that crap and non
sense you speak of (electing
cheer leaders and smoking pot)
isn't really such "nonsense and
crap" after all. Perhaps it's
nothing but the world we "co
habitate" in. And, Bernard, did
you ever think that maybe it's
you and your deep concern for
misery and death who are wast
ing time on "nonsense and
crap?"
Well, best of luck in unifying
our society and prohibiting crap
and the like. Hopefully, how
ever, I will long have decom
posed back into nothingness—
Now I lie me down to sleep,/
I pray the Lord my soul to
keep./ If I should die before I
wake,/ I pray the Lord my soul

This Thursday, November 16,
LASSU will select the five stu
dent members of the Committee
of Fifteen.
Essentially, the Committee of
Fifteen represents an effort to
establish a communications
bridge between the three major
segments of the Stanford com
munity (students, administra
tion and faculty). It does not
have any decision-making capa
city, although any unanimous
recommendations that it does
make are given a great deal of
consideration by the various ap
pointing powers of the Commit
tee, since they are, in theory,
representative of the views of
the entire community.
Unfortunately, we believe that
the student representatives to
the Committee in the past have
not always been representative
of the student body as a whole,
due to: (1) the efforts of active
minority groups to "push" one
point of view to the exclusion
of all others; and (2) the gen
eral apathy displayed by the ma
jority of students.
We believe that the student
members of the Committee will
not be able to operate effectively
unless they have the respect of
the Committee representatives
from the other two segments of
the community. In order to gain
that respect, they must be repre
sentative of as many of the di
verse points of view of their
fellows as possible.
Hopefully, any student with an
interest in this matter will speak
to his or her representative
about it, and all the representa
tives will be present at the
Thursday meeting.

Editor, The Daily:
At a time when University of
ficials bemoan the cuts in fed
eral loans and have a difficulty

in making ends meet, isn't it
possible for us, the students, to
help out?
Take, for instance, the new
library: here is a prime example
of a building that could be made
to pay its own way. I suggest
that for each fraternity initia
tion, prank or hoax the UGLY
levy a small charge. For each
ball game, ballet or opera in
volving more than one floor in
addition to the stage let the
charge be increased somewhat.
Or better still, why not build
a playpen outside for the chil
dren to play in? Why not have
the administration enforce a few
rules and maintain some silence
for those who don't want to
play?
I find it a little difficult to re
main polite when confronted
with the inconsiderate behaviour
that is exhibited in the library.

Perhaps there was some justifi
cation for these childish actions
when the library was newly
opened, but by now the thrill
should have worn off and been
replaced by a more serious at
titude.
The point of my letter should
be clear by now. Just how the
present state of affairs should
be changed I leave up to the li
brary staff—and if they are not
competent enough I suggest that
someone go and take a look at
Berkeley or one of the other uni
versities around here to see how
they cope with children.

Editor, The Daily:
At a time when University of
ficials bemoan the cuts in fed
eral loans and have a difficulty

in making ends meet, isn't it
possible for us, the students, to
help out?
Take, for instance, the new
library: here is a prime example
of a building that could be made
to pay its own way. I suggest
that for each fraternity initia
tion, prank or hoax the UGLY
levy a small charge. For each
ball game, ballet or opera in
volving more than one floor in
addition to the stage let the
charge be increased somewhat.
Or better still, why not build
a playpen outside for the chil
dren to play in? Why not have
the administration enforce a few
rules and maintain some silence
for those who don't want to
play?
I find it a little difficult to re
main polite when confronted
with the inconsiderate behaviour
that is exhibited in the library.

Perhaps there was some justifi
cation for these childish actions
when the library was newly
opened, but by now the thrill
should have worn off and been
replaced by a more serious at
titude.
The point of my letter should
be clear by now. Just how the
present state of affairs should
be changed I leave up to the li
brary staff—and if they are not
competent enough I suggest that
someone go and take a look at
Berkeley or one of the other uni
versities around here to see how
they cope with children.

"This society is coming apart,"
or so says Bernard Wasow (Let
ter to the Editor, November 10,
1967). That's just great, Ber
nard, but why the implication
that this society (or any for
that matter) was ever together
(on anything)?
You state that the large mi
norities who used to absorb
and/or fight against "all kinds
of crap aren't doing that any
more." Rather, they're busy
blowing out their brains while
we "rich 'intellectual' middle
class white students" at Stan
ford are wasting our precious
time (the latest UPI release
states that the average Ameri
can—obviously limited to whites
—has a life expectancy of 63
years to save the world) on
nonsense.
But just maybe, Bernard, just

maybe all that crap and non
sense you speak of (electing
cheer leaders and smoking pot)
isn't really such "nonsense and
crap" after all. Perhaps it's
nothing but the world we "co
habitate" in. And, Bernard, did
you ever think that maybe it's
you and your deep concern for
misery and death who are wast
ing time on "nonsense and
crap?"
Well, best of luck in unifying
our society and prohibiting crap
and the like. Hopefully, how
