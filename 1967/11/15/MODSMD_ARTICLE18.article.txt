# Big Game Week: It's Not Very Intellectual, But It Really Is Fun
## 
### RON NAHAS 
(Mr. Nahas is Chairman of the
Cardinal's Board)
Big Game Week is here again,
with all the usual trappings.
Slogans are sprayed on sand
stone walls; bands playing in
the library, monstrous chicken
wire Indians and Bears stalking
the Row; and tales of somewhat
childish pranks stealing Daily
headline space from pressing ed
ucational issues.
Minds reflect on the notorious
Wendy Wonka and the inimit
able Doodles Weaver, that su
perman of yesteryear, remem
bered by few, but loved by all.
Freshmen, barely six weeks
into their Stanford experience
patrol the campus from dusk
till dawn and sleep in the muddy
basin of Lake Lag, protecting a
bunch of telephone poles from

sinister members of Cal's Rally
Comm.
Living groups on the Row
spend days engineering and con
structing house decorations
which, after completion, will be
fortunate to last an entire day.
Thousands of students, faculty,
and alumni flock to watch the
ignition of the forty-foot-high
bonfire climaxing the Pre-Big
Game activities.
'The Search For Relevance'
One might ask who is re
sponsible for this, alarming in
terruption of our carefully con
structed academic atmosphere.
Of what possible relevance are
such goings on to progressive
educational processes?
One explanation is that Car
dinals Board is just up to its
old tricks. They're the ones who
organize the Homecoming dec
orations, the Bonfire, and othor
such frivolous pastimes. Last
year, they were also responsible
for insulting the Stanford com
munity with the thought of hav
ing a Homecoming Queen.
Of course Axe Command the
Band are in there too, organiz
ing the rallies, card stunts, and
half time entertainment. Put
those three together, and you've
just about wrapped up the
whole messy phenomenon.
Sorry About That
Unfortunately the explana
tion fails to account for the
thirty or forty living groups
that are building decorations,
the hundreds of freshmen who
will build the Bonfire, and the
thousands of students who will
gather for the rally and fire this
Friday night.
These people are not all per
sonal friends of the fourteen
members of Cardinals Board or
the fifty members of Axe
Comm. They participate during
Big Game week because they
feel that very illogical and un
sophisticated attachment to
Stanford known as "school
spirit."
School spirit is a difficult
thing to account for. It mani
fests itself in such strange prac
tices as stealing handleless axes,
stuffing crepe paper into chick
en wire, and shouting cheers
until nothing is left but a
whisper.

It cannot be justified or made
academically relevant; it can
only be enjoyed.
At Stanford, school spirit
seems to vary inversely with
the degree of education; to most
freshmen it seems natural, but
to most seniors, it must be ex
plained. Cardinals Board cannot
create school spirit. Big Game
and Homecoming projects mere
ly provide an exciting opportun
ity for those who haven't felt it
necessary to stop to analyse
their enthusiasm over football
games and fight songs.
It isn't intended that everyone
take part in the activities of
Big Game week. There are those
who cannot participate, and
those who will not participate.
For them, other types of enter
tainment are available.
If, however, you'd like to ex
press a rather unintellectual in
volvement with this University,
perhaps Big Game Week and
all its trappings can help. The
experience will not contribute to
your academic achievement, but
it may make your four years
here a bit more enjoyable.
