FLAG WAVERS â€”Student members of the Stanford Fire Depart
ment recently scaled Half Dome in Yosemite National Park to dis
play their BEAT CAL banner. The valley floor is 3000 feet straight
down. Members of the El Capitan Eating Club accomplished a sim
ilar feat by climbing Yosemite's El Capitan Mountain in an annual
ritual performed at Big Game time. As the firemen's banner flut
tered above the valley. Warren G. Wonka, posing as a bear nearby,
was deeply moved.
