# Researcher Foresees Falling Of Birth Rates
## 
### 
By the turn of this century,
most developing countries will
be well on their way toward
lower birth rates, a Stanford ex
pert forecasts.
But in the initial stages of
modernization, birth rates may
actually increase, Prof. Dudley
Kirk of the Stanford Food Re
search Institute observes.
His views are contained in a
paper on "Fertility Trends and
Prospects in the Developing
Countries," circulated to partici
pants in a University of Michi
gan conference on fertility and
population planning, which
opens here today.
Demographic director of The
Population Council prior to his
Stanford appointment earlier
this year, Prof. Kirk says the
"setting for (a) breakthrough"
in family planning now is "fav
orable in many ways":
• More countries are ap
proaching the threshold of eco
nomic and social development at
which birth rates usually begin
to decline;
• The tempo of transition,
once begun, is faster than be
fore; and
• New national family plan
ning programs, armed with bet
ter contraceptive methods, are
greatly reinforcing the normal
spread of family planning prac
tices.
Policies Begin
Twenty-three countries in the
developing regions now have
official family planning policies
or programs, Prof. Kirk said.
"Often too much is expected
of the progams. They are too
new and the problems are much
too great to be solved overnight.
"(Yet) the elements for suc
cess are gathering—government
action, improved technology,
and broad social and economic
progress."
While only rough data are
available, he added, "there
seems little question that reduc
tion of the birth rate, once firm
ly begun, has been very greatly
accelerated over time."
In his own studies of 38 coun
tries, extending back more than
a century, Prof. Kirk computed
the average time it took a na
tion which achieved an annual
birth rate of 35 per thousand
population to reduce this rate
to 20 or lower. In the mid-19th
century, the average time lapse
was 73 years. By the turn of
this century, it had fallen to 43
years. Since 1950, it has dropped
to a projected average of 21
years.
Rapid Decline
"The higher the birth rate at
the time of entering the transi
tion, the more rapid the de
cline," Prof. Kirk said. "The
higher they are, the faster they
start to fall—once they start to
fall."
During the initial stages of
modernization, birth rates may
actually rise briefly. Over the
past generation, birth rates
have risen "certainly in the
West Indies, very likely in the
Middle Americas, and probably
in a number of African and
Asian countries."
By 1960, however, a few coun
tries—Taiwan, Singapore, and
Puerto Rico—were "firmly on
the path of fertility declines."
Since then there have been "im
portant harbingers of change,"
especially in East Asia.
Transcend Ideology
Changes in birth rates, Prof.
Kirk said, transcend communist
ideology (in Eastern Europe and
Russia), cultural and economic
barriers between European and
the Orient (in Japan, for ex
ample), and religious interdic
tion (among the predominantly
Catholic countries of Europe).

Recent experience has con
firmed that major immigrant
groups from the developing
countries will reduce their birth
rates when they live in areas
of greater social and economic
development. This has happened
with Asians in Hawaii, Chinese
and Indians in Southeast Asia
and widely scattered islands,
and with Mexicans in the U.S.
Birth rates in the developing
nations now are about twice as
high as those in industrialized
nations. "It has not yet been
demonstrated that major fer
tility reduction can be achieved
in advance of, or without, major
parallel economic and social ad
vances," Prof. Kirk said.
Masses Unaffected
Countries in which there have
been substantial recent reduc
tions are those experiencing an
economic "take off"—Sou th
Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Malaysia, and Singapore. "The
tough, hard core masses of the
less developed world are not yet
in this category," he com
mented.
But the transition, when it
comes, may well be faster than
it was in the industial countries,
he concluded. "The reduction of
birth rates in the West was ac
complished by individual couples
in the face of restrictive legis
lation, religious opposition (Pro
testant as well as Catholic), and
public denunciation of birth con
trol.
"The private decisions and
actions of couples were made
within a 'conspiracy of silence'
which deprived them of the
psychological support of friends
and neighbors with common
views. "The restrictive atmos
phere in less developed coun
tries is rapidly giving way to
free discussion, permissive atti
tudes, and even outright social
and government pressure to
adopt birth control," he said.
Doctrine Not Obstacle
"Religious doctrine, except in
Latin America, is not a serious
obstacle . . . ," Kirk continued.
"The rapid decline of infant
mortality in the developing
countries has had a major im
pact on family size and pressure
to limit the number of births.
Fears that parents may be left
without children — especially
sons — are reduced by the fact
that more children are physi
cally present and the hazards to
their survival are visibly re
duced.

phere in less developed coun
tries is rapidly giving way to
free discussion, permissive atti
tudes, and even outright social
and government pressure to
adopt birth control," he said.
Doctrine Not Obstacle
"Religious doctrine, except in
Latin America, is not a serious
obstacle . . . ," Kirk continued.
"The rapid decline of infant
mortality in the developing
countries has had a major im
pact on family size and pressure
to limit the number of births.
Fears that parents may be left
without children — especially
sons — are reduced by the fact
that more children are physi
cally present and the hazards to
their survival are visibly re
duced.
By the turn of this century,
most developing countries will
be well on their way toward
lower birth rates, a Stanford ex
pert forecasts.
But in the initial stages of
modernization, birth rates may
actually increase, Prof. Dudley
Kirk of the Stanford Food Re
search Institute observes.
His views are contained in a
paper on "Fertility Trends and
Prospects in the Developing
Countries," circulated to partici
pants in a University of Michi
gan conference on fertility and
population planning, which
opens here today.
Demographic director of The
Population Council prior to his
Stanford appointment earlier
this year, Prof. Kirk says the
"setting for (a) breakthrough"
in family planning now is "fav
orable in many ways":
• More countries are ap
proaching the threshold of eco
nomic and social development at
which birth rates usually begin
to decline;
• The tempo of transition,
once begun, is faster than be
fore; and
• New national family plan
ning programs, armed with bet
ter contraceptive methods, are
greatly reinforcing the normal
spread of family planning prac
tices.
Policies Begin
Twenty-three countries in the
developing regions now have
official family planning policies
or programs, Prof. Kirk said.
"Often too much is expected
of the progams. They are too
new and the problems are much
too great to be solved overnight.
"(Yet) the elements for suc
cess are gathering—government
action, improved technology,
and broad social and economic
progress."
While only rough data are
available, he added, "there
seems little question that reduc
tion of the birth rate, once firm
ly begun, has been very greatly
accelerated over time."
In his own studies of 38 coun
tries, extending back more than
a century, Prof. Kirk computed
the average time it took a na
tion which achieved an annual
birth rate of 35 per thousand
population to reduce this rate
to 20 or lower. In the mid-19th
century, the average time lapse
was 73 years. By the turn of
this century, it had fallen to 43
years. Since 1950, it has dropped
to a projected average of 21
years.
Rapid Decline
"The higher the birth rate at
the time of entering the transi
tion, the more rapid the de
cline," Prof. Kirk said. "The
higher they are, the faster they
start to fall—once they start to
fall."
During the initial stages of
modernization, birth rates may
actually rise briefly. Over the
past generation, birth rates
have risen "certainly in the
West Indies, very likely in the
Middle Americas, and probably
in a number of African and
Asian countries."
By 1960, however, a few coun
tries—Taiwan, Singapore, and
Puerto Rico—were "firmly on
the path of fertility declines."
Since then there have been "im
portant harbingers of change,"
especially in East Asia.
Transcend Ideology
Changes in birth rates, Prof.
Kirk said, transcend communist
ideology (in Eastern Europe and
Russia), cultural and economic
barriers between European and
the Orient (in Japan, for ex
ample), and religious interdic
tion (among the predominantly
Catholic countries of Europe).

Recent experience has con
firmed that major immigrant
groups from the developing
countries will reduce their birth
rates when they live in areas
of greater social and economic
development. This has happened
with Asians in Hawaii, Chinese
and Indians in Southeast Asia
and widely scattered islands,
and with Mexicans in the U.S.
Birth rates in the developing
nations now are about twice as
high as those in industrialized
nations. "It has not yet been
demonstrated that major fer
tility reduction can be achieved
in advance of, or without, major
parallel economic and social ad
vances," Prof. Kirk said.
Masses Unaffected
Countries in which there have
been substantial recent reduc
tions are those experiencing an
economic "take off"—Sou th
Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Malaysia, and Singapore. "The
tough, hard core masses of the
less developed world are not yet
in this category," he com
mented.
But the transition, when it
comes, may well be faster than
it was in the industial countries,
he concluded. "The reduction of
birth rates in the West was ac
complished by individual couples
in the face of restrictive legis
lation, religious opposition (Pro
testant as well as Catholic), and
public denunciation of birth con
trol.
"The private decisions and
actions of couples were made
within a 'conspiracy of silence'
which deprived them of the
psychological support of friends
and neighbors with common
views. "The restrictive atmos
phere in less developed coun
tries is rapidly giving way to
free discussion, permissive atti

tough, hard core masses of the
less developed world are not yet
in this category," he com
mented.
But the transition, when it
comes, may well be faster than
it was in the industial countries,
he concluded. "The reduction of
birth rates in the West was ac
complished by individual couples
in the face of restrictive legis
lation, religious opposition (Pro
testant as well as Catholic), and
public denunciation of birth con
trol.
"The private decisions and
actions of couples were made
within a 'conspiracy of silence'
which deprived them of the
psychological support of friends
and neighbors with common
views. "The restrictive atmos
phere in less developed coun
tries is rapidly giving way to
free discussion, permissive atti
tudes, and even outright social
and government pressure to
adopt birth control," he said.
Doctrine Not Obstacle
"Religious doctrine, except in
Latin America, is not a serious
obstacle . . . ," Kirk continued.
"The rapid decline of infant
mortality in the developing
countries has had a major im
pact on family size and pressure
to limit the number of births.
Fears that parents may be left
without children — especially
sons — are reduced by the fact
that more children are physi
cally present and the hazards to
their survival are visibly re
duced.
By the turn of this century,
most developing countries will
be well on their way toward
lower birth rates, a Stanford ex
pert forecasts.
But in the initial stages of
modernization, birth rates may
actually increase, Prof. Dudley
Kirk of the Stanford Food Re
search Institute observes.
His views are contained in a
paper on "Fertility Trends and
Prospects in the Developing
Countries," circulated to partici
pants in a University of Michi
gan conference on fertility and
population planning, which
opens here today.
Demographic director of The
Population Council prior to his
Stanford appointment earlier
this year, Prof. Kirk says the
"setting for (a) breakthrough"
in family planning now is "fav
orable in many ways":
• More countries are ap
proaching the threshold of eco
nomic and social development at
which birth rates usually begin
to decline;
• The tempo of transition,
once begun, is faster than be
fore; and
• New national family plan
ning programs, armed with bet
ter contraceptive methods, are
greatly reinforcing the normal
spread of family planning prac
tices.
Policies Begin
Twenty-three countries in the
developing regions now have
official family planning policies
or programs, Prof. Kirk said.
"Often too much is expected
of the progams. They are too
new and the problems are much
too great to be solved overnight.
"(Yet) the elements for suc
cess are gathering—government
action, improved technology,
and broad social and economic
progress."
While only rough data are
available, he added, "there
seems little question that reduc
tion of the birth rate, once firm
ly begun, has been very greatly
accelerated over time."
In his own studies of 38 coun
tries, extending back more than
a century, Prof. Kirk computed
the average time it took a na
tion which achieved an annual
birth rate of 35 per thousand
population to reduce this rate
to 20 or lower. In the mid-19th
century, the average time lapse
was 73 years. By the turn of
this century, it had fallen to 43
years. Since 1950, it has dropped
to a projected average of 21
years.
Rapid Decline
"The higher the birth rate at
the time of entering the transi
tion, the more rapid the de
cline," Prof. Kirk said. "The
higher they are, the faster they
start to fall—once they start to
fall."
During the initial stages of
modernization, birth rates may
actually rise briefly. Over the
past generation, birth rates
have risen "certainly in the
West Indies, very likely in the
Middle Americas, and probably
in a number of African and
Asian countries."
By 1960, however, a few coun
tries—Taiwan, Singapore, and
Puerto Rico—were "firmly on
the path of fertility declines."
Since then there have been "im
portant harbingers of change,"
especially in East Asia.
Transcend Ideology
Changes in birth rates, Prof.
Kirk said, transcend communist
ideology (in Eastern Europe and
Russia), cultural and economic
barriers between European and
the Orient (in Japan, for ex
ample), and religious interdic
tion (among the predominantly
Catholic countries of Europe).

Recent experience has con
firmed that major immigrant
groups from the developing
countries will reduce their birth
rates when they live in areas
of greater social and economic
development. This has happened
with Asians in Hawaii, Chinese
and Indians in Southeast Asia
and widely scattered islands,
and with Mexicans in the U.S.
Birth rates in the developing
nations now are about twice as
high as those in industrialized
nations. "It has not yet been
demonstrated that major fer
tility reduction can be achieved
in advance of, or without, major
parallel economic and social ad
vances," Prof. Kirk said.
Masses Unaffected
Countries in which there have
been substantial recent reduc
tions are those experiencing an
economic "take off"—Sou th
Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Malaysia, and Singapore. "The
tough, hard core masses of the
less developed world are not yet
in this category," he com
mented.
But the transition, when it
comes, may well be faster than
