# Eleven Hours Underwater

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)â€”After
spending 11 hours with only
4,000 fish for company, Harry
Goldfarb decided to come up for
air.
Goldfarb, a Hollywood stunt
man, submerged himself in a
540,000-gallon fish tank at Ma
rineland promising to stay down
for more than 41 hours, which
he said was the record for stay
ing under water using only
scuba gear.
But according to Marineland
officials, the original record was
set in a heated swimming pool.
Goldfarb, wearing a wetsuit and
breathing gear, went into a tank
with an ocean temeprature of
68 degrees.
Early the following morning
Goldfarb surfaced saying he
was intensely chilled.
He noted, however, that the
fish in the tank were very
friendly. Even the 880-pound 18-
foot-long sawfish didn't bother
him.
