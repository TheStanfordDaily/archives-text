# Capital Punishment
## Court Orders Halt To Convict Deaths 
### 
San Francisco (AP) â€” The
state Supreme Court Tuesday
stayed all executions in Califor
nia.
The stay applies to prisoners
already under sentence of death
and to others who may receive
such sentences before the court
hears challenges of constitution
ality of capital punishment next
January.
The court announced last week
that it would hold hearings early
next year in all death penalty
cases involving constitutional is
sues.
The action was taken in blank
et cases originally filed in U.S.
District Court. U.S. District
Court Judge Robert F. Peckham
had ordered the condemned men
to exhaust remedies in state
courts.
Issues Opinion
Tuesday the State Supreme
Court issued a brief opinion say
ing:
"Pending final determination
in this court of the above entitled
proceedings, the execution of all
judgments of death heretofore
or hereafter entered by the Su
perior Courts of this state in all
cases involving other defendants
is hereby stayed."
The blanket proceedings affect
60 men on Death Row at San
Quentin Prison.
The specific proceedings be
fore the high court involve Rob
ert P. Anderson, 28, who killed
a San Diego pawn shop employe,
and Frederick Sater field, 51,
who killed his common law wife
and her 16-year-old daughter in
Orange County in 1965.
Refuse Hearing
Judge Peckham dropped ac
tion involving Robert Lee Mas
sie, Los Angeles killer, when ad
vised of the state Supreme
Court action. Massie was sche
duled to be executed Wednesday
for killing Mrs. Morris Weiss in
San Gabriel Jan. 7, 1965, during
a holdup.
Anderson and Saterfield were
the key names in a blanket ac
tion filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union and others chal
lenging the death penalty.
Defense attorneys charge that
California penalty juries were
death oriented, that there were

no standards to guide juries and
judges in sentencing killers to
death, that capital punishment
is cruel and unusual punishment,
and that after the automatic ap
peal from a death sentence con
demned are not guaranteed
counsel.
