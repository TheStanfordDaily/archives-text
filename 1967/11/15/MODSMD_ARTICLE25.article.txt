SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€”
Those who preach love as an
antidote for world hatred but
forget to love their own country
were sharply criticized by Dr.
Max Rafferty recently.
"The self-appointed Pied Pi
pers of today's youth have been
making a big thing out of hate,"
Rafferty said. "In all this talk
about the positivism of love and
the negativism of hate, no one
ever seems to want to talk
about love of country.
"It's the black eye hung on
love which nonplusses me," he
continued. "That's all patriotism
is, you know: just love ..."
Rafferty acknowledged that
this country has not yet attain
ed perfect freedom and justice.
