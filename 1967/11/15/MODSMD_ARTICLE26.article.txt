# Zetes, Theta Delt Clash For Crown
## 
### JOHN WRIGHT 
The intramural football sea
son .eaches a climax this after
noon when the Zetes and Theta
Delts battle for the University
championship at 3:45 on IM
field five.
Today's victor, besides earn
ing 100 IM points, will take on
Cal's fraternity champion Sat
urday morning, hopefully in
Stanford Stadium.
Both the Zetes and Theta
Delts have rolled up eight con

secutive wins so far this season.
The Zetes made it to the finals
by ousting the defending cham
pion and first-seeded Phi Kaps in
Monday's semifinals by 13-0.
The Theta Delts, who were
seeded second in the playoffs be
hind the Phi Kaps and just ahead
of the third-seeded Zetes, nosed
out last year's runners-up, SAE,
19-13 on Monday.
The Zete offense features a
powerful running attack, some
thing rarely found in touch foot

ball.
Quarterback John Frankovich
tries to establish his team's
ground attack before going to
the air, but the Zete passing at
tack is just as effective.
Frankovich's aerials have
found the sure hands of ends
Brad Alden, Gil Stansbury, and
Mar Agnew all season.
Center Ted Boutacoff, and
halfbacks Scott Smith and Chris
Esslinger provide the wall of
protection that gives Frankovich

enough time to pass, or opens up
the holes for his runs.
The Zetes have a separate de
fensive platoon, unlike the Theta
Delts who have several players
regularly going both ways.
Dick Taubman and Wayne Mil
ler comprise the Zete rush, which
was the team's weak point early
in the season.
But against the Phi Kaps on
Monday, Tubman and Miller
broke through several times in
the first half to nail quarterback

Ken Philpot.
Consequently, Philpot seemed
a bit gunshy at crucial moments
later in the game.
Linebackers Gary Pape and
John "Maddog" Landon have
been mean and efficient all sea
son long in front of the talented
Zete secondary.
Chris Gibson, Jeff Webber, and
Greg Adams have alternated at
left cornerback until now, but
Gibson will probably get the
starting nod today.

Sam Barnum mans the other
cornerback position, while Den
nis Lockhart roams at safety
for the Zetes.
Lockhart's effective coverage
has kept the Zetes from being
burned long, and the team's phy
sical aggressiveness has kept
oponents off balance.
The Theta Delts have annhi
lated six of their first eight op
ponents. They slipped past Sig
ma Chi Omega, 13-12, in their
first playoff game, but then
crushed El Cuadro, 33-0.

Theta Delt quarterback and
captain Fred Moseley has had a
strong season, continually zero
ing in on receivers John Scales,
Steve Ammons and Phil Ensz.
The blocking of Wilson Riles,
John Tracey and Jim Butler has
been virtually impenetrable.
The speedy Riles also plays
on the defensive line along with
Don Gilbert.
Butler and Van Fishback have
alternated at middle linebacker,
while Ensz and Bob Johnston
play the corners.

sical aggressiveness has kept
oponents off balance.
The Theta Delts have annhi
lated six of their first eight op
ponents. They slipped past Sig
ma Chi Omega, 13-12, in their
first playoff game, but then
crushed El Cuadro, 33-0.

Theta Delt quarterback and
captain Fred Moseley has had a
strong season, continually zero
ing in on receivers John Scales,
Steve Ammons and Phil Ensz.
The blocking of Wilson Riles,
John Tracey and Jim Butler has
been virtually impenetrable.
The speedy Riles also plays
on the defensive line along with
Don Gilbert.
Butler and Van Fishback have
alternated at middle linebacker,
while Ensz and Bob Johnston
play the corners.
The intramural football sea
son .eaches a climax this after
noon when the Zetes and Theta
Delts battle for the University
championship at 3:45 on IM
field five.
Today's victor, besides earn
ing 100 IM points, will take on
Cal's fraternity champion Sat
urday morning, hopefully in
Stanford Stadium.
Both the Zetes and Theta
Delts have rolled up eight con

secutive wins so far this season.
The Zetes made it to the finals
by ousting the defending cham
pion and first-seeded Phi Kaps in
Monday's semifinals by 13-0.
The Theta Delts, who were
seeded second in the playoffs be
hind the Phi Kaps and just ahead
of the third-seeded Zetes, nosed
out last year's runners-up, SAE,
19-13 on Monday.
The Zete offense features a
powerful running attack, some
thing rarely found in touch foot

ball.
Quarterback John Frankovich
tries to establish his team's
ground attack before going to
the air, but the Zete passing at
tack is just as effective.
Frankovich's aerials have
found the sure hands of ends
Brad Alden, Gil Stansbury, and
Mar Agnew all season.
Center Ted Boutacoff, and
halfbacks Scott Smith and Chris
Esslinger provide the wall of
protection that gives Frankovich

enough time to pass, or opens up
the holes for his runs.
The Zetes have a separate de
fensive platoon, unlike the Theta
Delts who have several players
regularly going both ways.
Dick Taubman and Wayne Mil
ler comprise the Zete rush, which
was the team's weak point early
in the season.
But against the Phi Kaps on
Monday, Tubman and Miller
broke through several times in
the first half to nail quarterback

Ken Philpot.
Consequently, Philpot seemed
a bit gunshy at crucial moments
later in the game.
Linebackers Gary Pape and
John "Maddog" Landon have
been mean and efficient all sea
son long in front of the talented
Zete secondary.
Chris Gibson, Jeff Webber, and
Greg Adams have alternated at
left cornerback until now, but
Gibson will probably get the
starting nod today.

Sam Barnum mans the other
cornerback position, while Den
nis Lockhart roams at safety
for the Zetes.
Lockhart's effective coverage
has kept the Zetes from being
burned long, and the team's phy
sical aggressiveness has kept
oponents off balance.
