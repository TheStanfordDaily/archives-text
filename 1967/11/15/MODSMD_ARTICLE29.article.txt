# Ralston Views Marquess, Spirit
## 
### NICK SELBY 
(An Interview with Stanford
football coach John Ralston.)
Q. AH last week before the
Oregon game you said that
Mark Marquess would have no
trouble filling in for Chuck Wil
liams at quarterback, that the
two were nearly the same in
motions. Yet after the game you
said Marquess was a bit rusty.
What happened?
Ralston: Mark mostly sat on
the bench for four weeks and
then we asked him to play as if
he had been playing. It was a
big order, especially when he
had no real chance to be ready.
He was a shade off in his timing,
but he'll be ready to start
against Cal.
Q. Isn't it harder for a quar
terback to throw across his
body? It seemed that Marquess
rolled out a lot to his right,
when actually, since he Is left
handed, It would have been
easier to roll to the left.
Ralston: It is harder to throw
across your body and maybe he
should have rolled more to his
left. It wasn't as if we were try
ing to simulate Chuck Williams'
roll outs to his right and there
is no difference in our pass pro
tection to either side.
Q. You said that you didn't
worry especially about getting
the team up for the Oregon
game. Can you get a team spirit
ed for every game in the sea
son?
Ralston: It is almost impos

sible to get a team fired up for
every one of the ten games.
Sometimes this season we've
been very spirited â€” the USC,
UCLA, and Oregon State games,
for example.
In the UCLA game, we fell
behind 7-0. The adversity of
losing at that time allowed the
team to crack through the bar
rier of too high spirit and we
moved ahead 10-7.
What is dangerous is if you're
not fired up and then meet ad
versity. Then you may go even
more flat, as we did against
Oregon. But this team is good in
that it doesn't panic when be
hind. I have good confidence in

it. That's why we went for the
field goal in the fourth quarter.
I knew we could come back to
score again.
Q. What did you see after
studying the Oregon game
films?
Ralston: We decided during the
game we were trap blocking well
in the middle and although we
are getting good yardage, we
had to go to more sweeps. The
films showed that several of
those sweeps by Howie Williams
just missed going all the way.
Q. Cal's offense has not
moved well on the ground, but
the Bears do pass well. Will you
change your defensive strat

egy? Also, Cal's defensive line
seems to be the best part of the
team. Will this affect the offens
ive strategy?
.Ralston: We will have to con
centrate on getting to the passer
more, but we rarely use blitzes
or anything like that. Gary
Fowler and Mike McGaffey run
well and we can't ignore them
either. I doubt our offensive
strategy will change from the
varied attack we've been using.
Q. Didn't you play In a Big
Game when you were at Cal?
What does this game mean?

Ralston: Yes, I played in the
7-7 tie in 1950. We not only want
to win the game for good season
and conference records, but it
helps keep momentum through
the winter and spring while we
prepare for next year.
And it means a tremendous
amount for me as coach to see
a dedicated team like this win.
I think this team is the best I've
coached as to its developing
unity. It certainly will be my
most rewarding season as a
coach.
