# CIA Limits College Recruiting
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS)â€”In the
interest of "maintaining a peace
ful academic atmosphere," the
Central Intelligence Agency has
decided not to recruit on cam
puses that lie near one of the
Agency's regional recruiting of
fices.
A CIA spokesman today con
firmed that college and univer

sity placement bureaus affected
are being notified of the deci
sion, but did not say where the
Agency's regional offices are lo
cated. He estimated that there
are "ten or twelve" of them,
however, presumably in the ma
jor cities.
The spokesman also noted that
in some cases interviews would

be conducted in a downtown area
of cities that do not have CIA
offices. He mentioned Boston as
an example, explaining that in
terviews would be conducted in
the Federal Building there rath
er than on campuses in the area.
Met With Protests
The CIA has met with pro
tests, some of them obstructive
and others not, on several cam
puses this fall. Among them
are the Universities of Colorado,
Maryland, lowa, and the Uni
versity at Berkeley.
According to the CIA spokes
man, the Agency normally re
cruits at 100 campuses around
the country. He added that "at
many of them we've had no
trouble."
Deny SDS 'Victory'
The CIA spokesman denied
that the Agency was succumbing
to pressure from students who
have protested CIA recruiting.
"We don't view it in that light,"
he said. He added, "One of the
young men who called here said
SDS was calling it a victory,"
but denied that the change was
likely to affect the Agency's re
cruiting efforts.
The CIA may well attempt to
reinstate on-campus recruiting
on the campuses where it is be
ing halted, according to the
spokesman. He said that if the
protests died down, "I'm sure
we would look at it again, to
see if we could return to the
campus."
