# Leftists Seek Consolidation
## 
### 
There will be a "community
meeting of the left" tonight at
8 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium
for those who oppose the war
and other aspects of our society.
Some members of the Left
feel that there has been a break
down of communication in the
left that has caused a decline in
its effectiveness. The meeting is
to discuss ways of correcting
this situation, and as Jack Ger
son of SDS said, "to revitalize
the left on campus."
