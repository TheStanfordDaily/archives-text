FOOTBALL FOR SHUT-INS
At next Saturday's football game while you are sitting
in your choice student's seat behind the end zone, won't
you pause and give a thought to football's greatest and,
alas, most neglected name? I refer, of course, to Champert
Sigafoos.
Champert Sigafoos (1714-1928) started life humbly on
a farm near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both
named Walter, were bean-gleaners, and Champert became
a bean-gleaner too. But he tired of the work and went to
Montana where he got a job with a logging firm. Here the
erstwhile bean-gleaner worked as a stump-thumper. After
a month he went to North Dakota where he tended the
furnace in a granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted to
Texas where he tidied up oil fields (pipe-wiper). Then to
Arizona where he strung dried fruit (fig-rigger). Then
to Kentucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oat
toter). Then to Long Island where he dressed poultry
(duck-plucker). Then to Alaska where he drove a delivery
van for a bakery (bread-sledder). Then to Minnesota
where he cut up frozen lakes (ice-slicer). Then to Nevada
where he determined the odds in a gambling house (dice
pricer). Then to Milwaukee where he pasted camera
lenses together (Zeiss-splicer).
Finally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a tan
nery, beating pig hides until they were soft and supple
(hog-'!ogger). Here occurred the event that changed not
only Champert's life, but all of ours.
Next door to Champert's hog-floggery was a mooring
mast for dirigibles. In flew a dirigible one day, piloted by
a girl named Graffa von Zeppelin. Champert watched
Graffa descend from the dirigible, and his heart turned
over, and he knew love. Though Graffa's beauty was not
quite perfect—one of her legs was shorter than the other
(blimp-gimper) — she was nonetheless ravishing, what
with her tawny hair and her eyes of Lake Louise blue and
her marvelously articulated haunches. Champert, smitten,
ran quickly back to the hog-floggery to plan the wooing.
To begin with, naturally, he would give Graffa a pres
ent. This presented problems, for hog-fiogging, as we all
know, is a signally underpaid profession. Still, thought
Champert, if he had no money, there were two things he
did have: ingenuity and pigskin.
So he selected several high grade pelts and stitched
them together and blew air into them and made for Graffa
a perfectly darling little replica of a dirigible. "She will
love this," said he confidently to himself and proceeded to
make ready to call on Graffa.
First, of course, he shaved with Personna Super Stain
less Steel Blades. And wouldn't you? If you were looking
to impress a girl, if you wanted jowls as smooth as ivory,
dewlaps like damask, a chin strokable, cheeks fondlesome,
upper lip kissable, would you not use the blade that
whisks away whiskers quickly and slickly, tuglessly and
nicklessly, scratchlessly and matchlessly? Would you not,
in short, choose Personna, available both in Injector style
and double-edge style? Of course you would.

So Champert, his face a study in epidermal elegance,
rushed next door with his little pigskin dirigible. But
Graffa, alas, had run off, alas, with a bush pilot who spe
cialized in dropping limes to scurvy-ridden Eskimo vil
lages (fruit-chuter).
Champert, enraged, started kicking his little pigskin
blimp all over the place. And who should walk by just
then but Jim Thorpe, Knute Rockne, Walter Camp, and
Pete Rozelle!
They walked silently, heads down, four discouraged
men. For weeks they had been trying to invent football,
but they couldn't seem to find the right kind of ball. They
tried everything-hockey pucks, badminton birds, bowling
balls, quoits—but nothing worked. Now seeing Champert
kicking his pigskin spheroid, their faces lit up and as one
man they hollered "Eureka!" The rest is history.

(hog-'!ogger). Here occurred the event that changed not
only Champert's life, but all of ours.
Next door to Champert's hog-floggery was a mooring
mast for dirigibles. In flew a dirigible one day, piloted by
a girl named Graffa von Zeppelin. Champert watched
Graffa descend from the dirigible, and his heart turned
over, and he knew love. Though Graffa's beauty was not
quite perfect—one of her legs was shorter than the other
(blimp-gimper) — she was nonetheless ravishing, what
with her tawny hair and her eyes of Lake Louise blue and
her marvelously articulated haunches. Champert, smitten,
ran quickly back to the hog-floggery to plan the wooing.
To begin with, naturally, he would give Graffa a pres
ent. This presented problems, for hog-fiogging, as we all
know, is a signally underpaid profession. Still, thought
Champert, if he had no money, there were two things he
did have: ingenuity and pigskin.
So he selected several high grade pelts and stitched
them together and blew air into them and made for Graffa
a perfectly darling little replica of a dirigible. "She will
love this," said he confidently to himself and proceeded to
make ready to call on Graffa.
First, of course, he shaved with Personna Super Stain
less Steel Blades. And wouldn't you? If you were looking
to impress a girl, if you wanted jowls as smooth as ivory,
dewlaps like damask, a chin strokable, cheeks fondlesome,
upper lip kissable, would you not use the blade that
whisks away whiskers quickly and slickly, tuglessly and
nicklessly, scratchlessly and matchlessly? Would you not,
in short, choose Personna, available both in Injector style
and double-edge style? Of course you would.

So Champert, his face a study in epidermal elegance,
rushed next door with his little pigskin dirigible. But
Graffa, alas, had run off, alas, with a bush pilot who spe
cialized in dropping limes to scurvy-ridden Eskimo vil
lages (fruit-chuter).
Champert, enraged, started kicking his little pigskin
blimp all over the place. And who should walk by just
then but Jim Thorpe, Knute Rockne, Walter Camp, and
Pete Rozelle!
They walked silently, heads down, four discouraged
men. For weeks they had been trying to invent football,
but they couldn't seem to find the right kind of ball. They
tried everything-hockey pucks, badminton birds, bowling
balls, quoits—but nothing worked. Now seeing Champert
kicking his pigskin spheroid, their faces lit up and as one
man they hollered "Eureka!" The rest is history.

FOOTBALL FOR SHUT-INS
At next Saturday's football game while you are sitting
in your choice student's seat behind the end zone, won't
you pause and give a thought to football's greatest and,
alas, most neglected name? I refer, of course, to Champert
Sigafoos.
Champert Sigafoos (1714-1928) started life humbly on
a farm near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both
named Walter, were bean-gleaners, and Champert became
a bean-gleaner too. But he tired of the work and went to
Montana where he got a job with a logging firm. Here the
erstwhile bean-gleaner worked as a stump-thumper. After
a month he went to North Dakota where he tended the
furnace in a granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted to
Texas where he tidied up oil fields (pipe-wiper). Then to
Arizona where he strung dried fruit (fig-rigger). Then
to Kentucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oat
toter). Then to Long Island where he dressed poultry
(duck-plucker). Then to Alaska where he drove a delivery
van for a bakery (bread-sledder). Then to Minnesota
where he cut up frozen lakes (ice-slicer). Then to Nevada
where he determined the odds in a gambling house (dice
pricer). Then to Milwaukee where he pasted camera
lenses together (Zeiss-splicer).
Finally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a tan
nery, beating pig hides until they were soft and supple
(hog-'!ogger). Here occurred the event that changed not

upper lip kissable, would you not use the blade that
whisks away whiskers quickly and slickly, tuglessly and
nicklessly, scratchlessly and matchlessly? Would you not,
in short, choose Personna, available both in Injector style
and double-edge style? Of course you would.

So Champert, his face a study in epidermal elegance,
rushed next door with his little pigskin dirigible. But
Graffa, alas, had run off, alas, with a bush pilot who spe

lages (fruit-chuter).
Champert, enraged, started kicking his little pigskin
blimp all over the place. And who should walk by just
then but Jim Thorpe, Knute Rockne, Walter Camp, and
Pete Rozelle!
They walked silently, heads down, four discouraged
men. For weeks they had been trying to invent football,
but they couldn't seem to find the right kind of ball. They
tried everything-hockey pucks, badminton birds, bowling
balls, quoits—but nothing worked. Now seeing Champert
kicking his pigskin spheroid, their faces lit up and as one
man they hollered "Eureka!" The rest is history.

FOOTBALL FOR SHUT-INS
At next Saturday's football game while you are sitting
in your choice student's seat behind the end zone, won't
you pause and give a thought to football's greatest and,
alas, most neglected name? I refer, of course, to Champert
Sigafoos.
Champert Sigafoos (1714-1928) started life humbly on
a farm near Thud, Kansas. His mother and father, both
named Walter, were bean-gleaners, and Champert became
a bean-gleaner too. But he tired of the work and went to
Montana where he got a job with a logging firm. Here the
erstwhile bean-gleaner worked as a stump-thumper. After
a month he went to North Dakota where he tended the
furnace in a granary (wheat-heater). Then he drifted to
Texas where he tidied up oil fields (pipe-wiper). Then to
Arizona where he strung dried fruit (fig-rigger). Then
to Kentucky where he fed horses at a breeding farm (oat
toter). Then to Long Island where he dressed poultry
(duck-plucker). Then to Alaska where he drove a delivery
van for a bakery (bread-sledder). Then to Minnesota
where he cut up frozen lakes (ice-slicer). Then to Nevada
where he determined the odds in a gambling house (dice
pricer). Then to Milwaukee where he pasted camera
lenses together (Zeiss-splicer).
Finally he went to Omaha where he got a job in a tan
nery, beating pig hides until they were soft and supple
(hog-'!ogger). Here occurred the event that changed not
only Champert's life, but all of ours.
Next door to Champert's hog-floggery was a mooring
mast for dirigibles. In flew a dirigible one day, piloted by
a girl named Graffa von Zeppelin. Champert watched
Graffa descend from the dirigible, and his heart turned
over, and he knew love. Though Graffa's beauty was not
quite perfect—one of her legs was shorter than the other
(blimp-gimper) — she was nonetheless ravishing, what
with her tawny hair and her eyes of Lake Louise blue and
her marvelously articulated haunches. Champert, smitten,
ran quickly back to the hog-floggery to plan the wooing.
To begin with, naturally, he would give Graffa a pres
ent. This presented problems, for hog-fiogging, as we all
know, is a signally underpaid profession. Still, thought
Champert, if he had no money, there were two things he
did have: ingenuity and pigskin.
So he selected several high grade pelts and stitched
them together and blew air into them and made for Graffa
a perfectly darling little replica of a dirigible. "She will
love this," said he confidently to himself and proceeded to
make ready to call on Graffa.
First, of course, he shaved with Personna Super Stain
less Steel Blades. And wouldn't you? If you were looking
to impress a girl, if you wanted jowls as smooth as ivory,
dewlaps like damask, a chin strokable, cheeks fondlesome,
upper lip kissable, would you not use the blade that
whisks away whiskers quickly and slickly, tuglessly and
nicklessly, scratchlessly and matchlessly? Would you not,
in short, choose Personna, available both in Injector style
and double-edge style? Of course you would.

So Champert, his face a study in epidermal elegance,
rushed next door with his little pigskin dirigible. But
Graffa, alas, had run off, alas, with a bush pilot who spe
cialized in dropping limes to scurvy-ridden Eskimo vil
lages (fruit-chuter).
Champert, enraged, started kicking his little pigskin
blimp all over the place. And who should walk by just
then but Jim Thorpe, Knute Rockne, Walter Camp, and
Pete Rozelle!
