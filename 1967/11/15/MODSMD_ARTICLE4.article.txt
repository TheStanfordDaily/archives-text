# Red Guard Explains Chinese Activism
## 
### ROBIN KNIGHT 
A former Red Guard activist
claimed yesterday that the Cul
tural Revolution was "a rebel
lion against the bureaucracy."
18-year-old Chris Milton ad
dressed an audience of 400 in
Dinkelspiel yesterday afternoon.
He traced the start of the Red
Guard movement to discussions,
held in April and May of 1966
in his school, concerning exam
inations.
These examinations "weeded
out the children of workers and
peasants," and betrayed the
"whole purpose of the Revolu
tion," Milton claimed. The old
educational system "was cre
ating another elite."
He attacked the Young Com
munist League saying that it
was made up of "teacher's
pets," and "wasn't out to serve
the people."
Ignore Party Committee
Once the Red Guard move
ment assumed definite form
within his school, Peking Uni
versity's Secondary School, the
pupils turned against the Party
Secretary. "From that time on
I don't think anyone listened

to the Party Committee in our
school," Milton said.
Milton's school ended on June
1, 1966. Pupils then began to
spend their time writing "char
acter posters." Soon "you could
n't find any space to put up the
big posters" and"the whole
school was covered with posters
on every possible topic."
A work team of two people
was sent by the Party to the
school in mid-June. "Within
two or three days they had

thrown a wet blanket on the
movement in our school. In ef
fect they said 'Don't do any
thing—leave it to us'," Milton
continued.
Led To Criticism
Not surprisingly this policy
led to further criticism, but dur
ing June and July Milton, as a
foreigner, was largely excluded
from the Cultural Revolution.
"Most of what I learned I
read on the character posters,"
he said.

Once the work teams were
withdrawn, following interven
tion by Chou En-Lai, Milton was
told he could go back to school
if he wanted.
Milton's hour-long talk em
phasized the "Long March" he
and 20 friends undertook from
November 1966 to February
1967. The aim was "to spread
the whole concept of rebellion
to bureaucracy to the country
side." The marchers averaged
"about 30 miles a day." There
were nine girls and twelve boys
in the group.
For two months and 800 miles
the group remained together.
There was continual internal
stuggle, respecially among the
girls. "The girls split into three
parts," Milton said.
"This split was on the basis
of class background—workers,
in-betweeners, and cadres."
When the group returned to
to Peking the stuggle between
the Red Flag and Red Guard
groups in the school was rag
ing fiercely. Milton and a few
companions managed to re-unite
the Red Guards.
Asked about the Chinese atti
tudes to American involvement
in Vietnam, Milton said, "Gen
erally thp feeling is that the
U.S. is the imperialist aggres
sor, murdering people for
money or whatever. But the Chi
nese make a distinction between
the American government and
the American poeple."
