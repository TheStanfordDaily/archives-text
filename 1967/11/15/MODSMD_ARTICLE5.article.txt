## Council To Study Cases 
### 
The ASSU Judicial Council
will meet tonight to consider
the cases of nine students who
demonstrated against Central
Intelligence Agency recruiting
on campus two weeks ago.
The council discussed the mat
ter at its meeting Monday night
but took no action then.
It is now debating whether

or not to assume jurisdiction at
all, according to Council Chair
man John Raskin.
Meanwhile, several of the stu
dents charged with violating
University policy on demonstra
tions are circulating a "letter
of complicity," which they hope
other students in the demonstra
tion will sign.
The statement reads in part:
"We declare our complicity with
the actions of these nine stu
dents and assert that our guilt
or innocence is the same as
theirs.
"We demand to be prosecuted
equally with them."
So far at least a dozen stu
dents and non-students have
signed the statement, although
none has yet reached Raskin or
Dean of Students Joel Smith.
Since the first nine students
were charged by Smith with
violating University policy on
campus demonstrations, one
more student has had charges
brought against him.
Smith said he anticipated no
further prosecutions except for
those who may turn themselves
in. The original nine were iden
tified from photographs taken
at the demonstration.
Several of the accused demon
strators have said they will re
quest an open hearing before
Judicial Council, a right guaran
teed in the ASSU Constitution.
Most council proceedings in the
past have been closed.
