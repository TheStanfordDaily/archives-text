# Anti-draft Supporters To Protest Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's Resistance and
other supporters of the anti
draft movement in the Bay Area
will demonstrate at noon tomor
row in front of San Francisco's
Federal Building.
A car caravan will leave for
San Francisco from the Stan
ford Bookstore Thursday at
10:30 a.m.
The demonstration, according
to Mark Silverman, Stanford
Resistance spokesman, is intend
ed to show support for almost
200 people in Boston who will
turn in their draft cards Thurs
day and for anti-draft demon
strators across the country who
have been arrested.
Fifteen persons who burned
their draft cards last April in
New York have recently been
arrested, in addition to three in

Denver and a high school stu
dent in Ohio.
Two Stanford students with
out their draft cards have re
ceived delinquency notices from
their draft boards stating that
they may now be placed at the
top of the call lists. They ar?
Doug Sorenson, a first year law
student, and Jerry Silvergeld, a
graduate student in history.
Silverman remarked the pres
ent demonstrations are not iso
lated events, but are a response
to General Lewis Hershey's let
ter to all local draft boards
recommending that they draft
students who physically obstruct
government recruiters.
"We are trying," Silverman
said, "to establish a precedent
showing how students will react
to federal intimidation and
threats like Hershey's letter."
