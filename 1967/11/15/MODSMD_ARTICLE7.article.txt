# McCloskey Leads Vote In San Mateo Election
## 
### 
Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey
scored an upset victory over
former child movie idol Shirley
Temple Black in San Mateo
County's special congressional
primary election yesterday. He
won by a surprising margin of
17,000 votes.
The open primary, in which
voters of either party can freely
cross party lines, called for the
leading Republican to face the
leading Democrat in a runoff.
The election would have been
settled if any candidate had
polled 51 per cent of the votes.
McCloskey, however, won
only 27 percent of the vote and
will face Roy A. Archibald, the
top Democratic vote-getter, in a
runoff Dec. 12. Archibald topped
peace candidate Edward M.
Keating by a margin of 6000
votes.
Pro Viet Stand
Mrs. Black, a strong supporter
of national policy in Vietnam,
had been considered the favorite
by many observers. McCloskey
has advocated gradual with
drawal from Vietnam, making
provision for the resettlement
of our Vietnamese allies in case
of Communist takeover.
Archibald favors "an all-out
diplomatic offensive to bring
about negotiations ... we
should stop our bombing of the
north."
Mrs. Black's bad news started
coming within minutes of the
closing of the polls when she
lost her home precinct to Mc-
Closkey, 75 to 66.
McCloskey, a Stanford gradu
ate, won the Navy Cross in the
Korean War and is currently a
Woodside attorney. He is also
the author of a textbook, "U.S.
Constitution" which is used in
many school systems throughout
the country.
Archibald is West Coast rep

resentative of the National Edu
cation Association and has serv
ed as their lobbyist in Washing
ton.
In her concession statement
Mrs. Black stated, "This was my
first race, and I know how the
game is played. I will be back. I

plan to dedicate my life and ener
gies to public service, because
I think my country needs it
now more than ever. I offer my
congratulations to the winners.
I might even see them next year,
who knows."
Remainder Of Term
The special election was to
fill the seat vacated by the
death of Representative J. Ar
thur Younger, a Republican. The
runoff will fill merely the re
mainder of Younger's term.
With all but 11 of San Mateo's
575 precincts counted, McClos
key piled up 50,634 votes to 33,-
025 for Mrs. Black. Archibald
led his nearest Democratic rival,
Keating, 14,645 to 3,546.
Mrs. Black's presence in the
race made what would other
wise have been an obscure race
into one of world-wide interest.
For weeks she was beseiged with
requests for interviews from all
over the world.

death of Representative J. Ar
thur Younger, a Republican. The
runoff will fill merely the re
mainder of Younger's term.
With all but 11 of San Mateo's
575 precincts counted, McClos

025 for Mrs. Black. Archibald
led his nearest Democratic rival,
Keating, 14,645 to 3,546.

PAUL McCLOSKEY
Paul N. "Pete" McCloskey
scored an upset victory over
former child movie idol Shirley
Temple Black in San Mateo
County's special congressional
primary election yesterday. He
won by a surprising margin of
17,000 votes.
The open primary, in which
voters of either party can freely
cross party lines, called for the
leading Republican to face the
leading Democrat in a runoff.
The election would have been
settled if any candidate had
polled 51 per cent of the votes.
McCloskey, however, won
only 27 percent of the vote and
will face Roy A. Archibald, the
top Democratic vote-getter, in a
runoff Dec. 12. Archibald topped
peace candidate Edward M.
Keating by a margin of 6000
votes.
Pro Viet Stand
Mrs. Black, a strong supporter
of national policy in Vietnam,
had been considered the favorite
by many observers. McCloskey
has advocated gradual with
drawal from Vietnam, making
provision for the resettlement
of our Vietnamese allies in case
of Communist takeover.
Archibald favors "an all-out
diplomatic offensive to bring
about negotiations ... we
should stop our bombing of the
north."
Mrs. Black's bad news started
coming within minutes of the
closing of the polls when she
lost her home precinct to Mc-
Closkey, 75 to 66.
McCloskey, a Stanford gradu
ate, won the Navy Cross in the
Korean War and is currently a
Woodside attorney. He is also
the author of a textbook, "U.S.
Constitution" which is used in
many school systems throughout
the country.
Archibald is West Coast rep

resentative of the National Edu
cation Association and has serv
ed as their lobbyist in Washing
ton.
In her concession statement
Mrs. Black stated, "This was my
first race, and I know how the
game is played. I will be back. I

plan to dedicate my life and ener
gies to public service, because
I think my country needs it
now more than ever. I offer my
congratulations to the winners.
I might even see them next year,
who knows."
