Election Invalidated
The first yell leader election
was invalidated by the Judicial
Council Monday on the grounds
that candidates had not been
informed of election rules until
well after campaigning had be
gun. Craig Brown held a meet
ing of candidates on November 1
after being appointed elections
commissioner on October 30.
Brown questioned the deci
sion of the Council Monday night
but stated yesterday afternoon
he would go along with the plan.
The top two yell leader can
didates may cheer at half-time
of the Big Game on Saturday.
Michael Weinstein, speaker of
the Legislature, emphasized that
all members elected last week
should attend tomorrow's
LASSU meeting along with
members elected earlier.
The Legislature will meet at
7:30 p.m. in Room 320, Geology
Corner. LASSU is expected to
appoint student representatives
to the Committee of Fifteen.
Weinstein announced that six
additional Legislature members
will automatically take seats to
morrow night. The six represent
graduate schools that have less
than full representation.
New Members
The new members are: Joseph
Lane, Bernard Mendes, Law
rence Jerome, and Gene Willeke
from Engineering; Gordon Jones
from Education; and David Rut
ledge from Food Research.
There are currently 115
LASSU members, according
Weinstein. Almost 50 openings
remain.
Nineteen of 23 seats are still
open in the Engineering gradu
ate School; 11 of 12 School of
Education seats are open; and
the Business School has filled
3 of 7 openings.
In addition, 10 fraternities, Ar
royo and Trancos in Wilbur,
Gavilan and Mirlo in Florence
Moore, and Lathrop House on
the Row have not sent official
representatives to LASSU.
