# Legislature Will Discuss Election, C15, Fun Stan
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Committee of Fifteen appoint
ments will dominate discussion
at tonight's legislative session.
Legislature members will quiz
seven nominees for the five stu
dent positions on the committee
which has equal representation
from students, faculty and ad
ministration.
LASSU's composition will be
decidedly changed tonight as 41
members elected last week take
office. This represents an in
crease of more than sixty per
cent in the legislature's size
since the last meeting.
Legislature Speaker Michael
Weinstein announced yesterday
that all new members as well as
regular members should attend

tonight's session at 7:30 in
Room 320.
Fun Stan Change
LASSU is also expected to
consider a proposal for a new
"Fundamental Standard," the
placement of San Francisco's
Proposition P on the ballot with
the head yell leader final elec
tion next week, and support for
a projected student strike at
Eerkeley next week.
Before legislature votes on the
Committee of Fifteen member
ship, nominees will discuss eigh
teen questions announced by
LASSU two weeks ago.
ASSU President Peter Lyman
nominated Maureen Colbates,
Tom Forstenzer, Steve McMil
lan, Dell Martin, and John Ras
kin.
LASSU made three additional
nominations at its last meeting:
Fritz Schaefer, Eric Treisman,
and Weinstein. Weinstein re
cently declined the nomination.
Although Lyman can veto any
of LASSU's choices for student
representation, this is considered
unlikely.
LASSU Questions
The eighteen questions in
clude:
"What do you think of civil
disobedience on campus?"
"Is the existence of ROTC on
the Stanford campus legiti
mate?"
"Should Stanford be engaged
in 'Big Time' sports?"
"What do you think about
Stanford fraternities?"
The Fundamental Standard
amendment to the ASSU by-laws
was given a "pass" recommen
dation yesterday by the LASSU
judicial committee.

The proposed change states
that University rules are not
binding on the Fundamental
Standard. Weinstein explained
that under the new amendment,
"the Fundamental Standard can
not necessarily be invoked over
a conflict of law between the
University and ASSU laws."
The bill reads, in part: "Vio
lations of University regulations
or policy shall not be construed
as per se violations of the Fun
damental Standard."
As an example, Weinstein
pointed out recent demonstra
tors against Central Intelligence
Agency campus recruitment are
being charged with breaking
University policies against dem
onstrations. Passage of the by
laws amendment would insure
that Fundamental Standard vio
lations could not be brought
against them, unless they were
cited for breaking ASSU laws.
A resolution will also be in
troduced attempting to establish
an ASSU policy on demonstra
tions separate from University
policy.
Support Cal
Legislature will be asked to
pass a statement supporting the
students at Berkeley who face
possible suspension as a result
of participation in demonstra
tions against the CIA.
A student strike is planned at
Cal if the administration deci
sion, to be announced next Mon
day, is suspension. The LASSU
resolution supports the Berkeley
strike, in case it does occur.
A request for an appropria
tion will be introduced tonight
by the National Student Associa
tion (NSA) for $83.70 to pay for

an increase in the association's
national dues. Earlier, LASSU
gave NSA $155 for dues.
Weinstein indicated that there
"could be opposition" to the re
quest for increased financing.
He will refer the bill to the fi
nance committee.
The speaker speculated that a
motion may be made to place
Proposition P on the ballot in
next week's cheerleader voting.
The proposition calls for "an
immediate cease fire and with
drawal of U.S. troops from Viet
nam." It was almost included on
last week's primary ballot, but
was removed because of the il
legality of the motion to enter
the proposition.
Weinstein stated that inclu
sion of Proposition P on the bal
lot "might stimulate interest in
the final cheerleader election
next week."
Other Actions
In other action, the legislature
will vote on an Institute for In
ternational Relations (IIR)
"sense of the legislature" re
quest for $5,200 to finance an
overseas exchange program for
three foreign students next
year.
The resolution cannot be offi
cially approved until Spring
when next year's budget is
drawn up. Tonight's vote will
indicate to lIR if it should con
tinue its plans for the program.
Legislature will also consider
a resolution asking the lIR to
change ihe topic of a speech by
Nicholas de B. Katzenbach to the
Vietnamese war or to arrange a
debate on Vietnam between Kat
zenbach and a Stanford profes
sor.

RALLY 'HOUNI) THE CLAW: Yesterday's Noon Rally brought the largest crowd yet this week to
White Plaza. As the kickoff of the liig Game nears, spirit activities grow more frenzied to a climax Fri
day night in tin 1 : annual bonfire. At yesterday's Red and White Rally, the Stanford Indian frolicked
with ill-fated Oski the Bear, and both landed in Claw Lake during the Bear's burial. Twice Oski
lost his head, an event which was interpreted by observers as a definite omen. Loud cries of "7 in 67"
arose as the star-crossed Oski slipped to ins watery burial. (See page 3 for story on Stanford's lethal
new water weapon.)

RALLY 'HOUNI) THE CLAW: Yesterday's Noon Rally brought the largest crowd yet this week to
White Plaza. As the kickoff of the liig Game nears, spirit activities grow more frenzied to a climax Fri
day night in tin 1 : annual bonfire. At yesterday's Red and White Rally, the Stanford Indian frolicked
with ill-fated Oski the Bear, and both landed in Claw Lake during the Bear's burial. Twice Oski
lost his head, an event which was interpreted by observers as a definite omen. Loud cries of "7 in 67"
arose as the star-crossed Oski slipped to ins watery burial. (See page 3 for story on Stanford's lethal
new water weapon.)
Committee of Fifteen appoint
ments will dominate discussion
at tonight's legislative session.
Legislature members will quiz
seven nominees for the five stu
dent positions on the committee
which has equal representation
from students, faculty and ad
ministration.
LASSU's composition will be
decidedly changed tonight as 41
members elected last week take
office. This represents an in
crease of more than sixty per
cent in the legislature's size
since the last meeting.
Legislature Speaker Michael
Weinstein announced yesterday
that all new members as well as
regular members should attend

tonight's session at 7:30 in
Room 320.
Fun Stan Change
LASSU is also expected to
consider a proposal for a new
"Fundamental Standard," the
placement of San Francisco's
Proposition P on the ballot with
the head yell leader final elec
tion next week, and support for
a projected student strike at
Eerkeley next week.
Before legislature votes on the
Committee of Fifteen member
ship, nominees will discuss eigh
teen questions announced by
LASSU two weeks ago.
ASSU President Peter Lyman
nominated Maureen Colbates,
Tom Forstenzer, Steve McMil
lan, Dell Martin, and John Ras
kin.
LASSU made three additional
nominations at its last meeting:
Fritz Schaefer, Eric Treisman,
and Weinstein. Weinstein re
cently declined the nomination.
Although Lyman can veto any
of LASSU's choices for student
representation, this is considered
unlikely.
LASSU Questions
The eighteen questions in
clude:
"What do you think of civil
disobedience on campus?"
"Is the existence of ROTC on
the Stanford campus legiti
mate?"
"Should Stanford be engaged
in 'Big Time' sports?"
"What do you think about
Stanford fraternities?"
The Fundamental Standard
amendment to the ASSU by-laws
was given a "pass" recommen
dation yesterday by the LASSU
judicial committee.

The proposed change states
that University rules are not
binding on the Fundamental
Standard. Weinstein explained
that under the new amendment,
"the Fundamental Standard can
not necessarily be invoked over
a conflict of law between the
University and ASSU laws."
The bill reads, in part: "Vio
lations of University regulations
or policy shall not be construed
as per se violations of the Fun
damental Standard."
As an example, Weinstein
pointed out recent demonstra
tors against Central Intelligence
Agency campus recruitment are
being charged with breaking
University policies against dem
onstrations. Passage of the by
laws amendment would insure
that Fundamental Standard vio
lations could not be brought
against them, unless they were
cited for breaking ASSU laws.
A resolution will also be in
troduced attempting to establish
an ASSU policy on demonstra
tions separate from University
policy.
Support Cal
Legislature will be asked to
pass a statement supporting the
students at Berkeley who face
possible suspension as a result
of participation in demonstra
tions against the CIA.
A student strike is planned at
Cal if the administration deci
sion, to be announced next Mon
day, is suspension. The LASSU
resolution supports the Berkeley
strike, in case it does occur.
A request for an appropria
tion will be introduced tonight
by the National Student Associa
tion (NSA) for $83.70 to pay for

an increase in the association's
national dues. Earlier, LASSU
gave NSA $155 for dues.
Weinstein indicated that there
"could be opposition" to the re
quest for increased financing.
He will refer the bill to the fi
nance committee.
The speaker speculated that a
motion may be made to place
Proposition P on the ballot in
next week's cheerleader voting.
The proposition calls for "an
immediate cease fire and with
drawal of U.S. troops from Viet
nam." It was almost included on
last week's primary ballot, but
was removed because of the il
legality of the motion to enter
the proposition.

that Fundamental Standard vio

A resolution will also be in

policy.
Support Cal
Legislature will be asked to
pass a statement supporting the
students at Berkeley who face
possible suspension as a result
of participation in demonstra
tions against the CIA.
A student strike is planned at
Cal if the administration deci
sion, to be announced next Mon
day, is suspension. The LASSU
resolution supports the Berkeley
strike, in case it does occur.
A request for an appropria
tion will be introduced tonight
by the National Student Associa
tion (NSA) for $83.70 to pay for

an increase in the association's
national dues. Earlier, LASSU
gave NSA $155 for dues.
Weinstein indicated that there
"could be opposition" to the re
quest for increased financing.
He will refer the bill to the fi
nance committee.
The speaker speculated that a
motion may be made to place
Proposition P on the ballot in
next week's cheerleader voting.
The proposition calls for "an
immediate cease fire and with
drawal of U.S. troops from Viet
nam." It was almost included on
last week's primary ballot, but
was removed because of the il
legality of the motion to enter
the proposition.
Weinstein stated that inclu
sion of Proposition P on the bal
lot "might stimulate interest in
the final cheerleader election
next week."
Other Actions
In other action, the legislature
will vote on an Institute for In
ternational Relations (IIR)
"sense of the legislature" re
quest for $5,200 to finance an
overseas exchange program for
three foreign students next
year.
The resolution cannot be offi
cially approved until Spring
when next year's budget is
drawn up. Tonight's vote will
indicate to lIR if it should con
tinue its plans for the program.
Legislature will also consider
a resolution asking the lIR to
change ihe topic of a speech by
Nicholas de B. Katzenbach to the
Vietnamese war or to arrange a
debate on Vietnam between Kat
zenbach and a Stanford profes

RALLY 'HOUNI) THE CLAW: Yesterday's Noon Rally brought the largest crowd yet this week to
White Plaza. As the kickoff of the liig Game nears, spirit activities grow more frenzied to a climax Fri
day night in tin 1 : annual bonfire. At yesterday's Red and White Rally, the Stanford Indian frolicked
with ill-fated Oski the Bear, and both landed in Claw Lake during the Bear's burial. Twice Oski
lost his head, an event which was interpreted by observers as a definite omen. Loud cries of "7 in 67"
arose as the star-crossed Oski slipped to ins watery burial. (See page 3 for story on Stanford's lethal
new water weapon.)
Committee of Fifteen appoint
ments will dominate discussion
at tonight's legislative session.
Legislature members will quiz
seven nominees for the five stu
dent positions on the committee
which has equal representation
from students, faculty and ad
ministration.
LASSU's composition will be
decidedly changed tonight as 41
members elected last week take
office. This represents an in
crease of more than sixty per
cent in the legislature's size
since the last meeting.
Legislature Speaker Michael
Weinstein announced yesterday
that all new members as well as
regular members should attend

tonight's session at 7:30 in
Room 320.
Fun Stan Change
LASSU is also expected to
consider a proposal for a new
"Fundamental Standard," the
placement of San Francisco's
Proposition P on the ballot with
the head yell leader final elec
tion next week, and support for
a projected student strike at
Eerkeley next week.
Before legislature votes on the
Committee of Fifteen member
ship, nominees will discuss eigh
teen questions announced by
LASSU two weeks ago.
ASSU President Peter Lyman
nominated Maureen Colbates,
Tom Forstenzer, Steve McMil
lan, Dell Martin, and John Ras
kin.
LASSU made three additional
nominations at its last meeting:
Fritz Schaefer, Eric Treisman,
and Weinstein. Weinstein re
cently declined the nomination.
Although Lyman can veto any
of LASSU's choices for student
representation, this is considered
unlikely.
LASSU Questions
The eighteen questions in
clude:
"What do you think of civil
disobedience on campus?"
"Is the existence of ROTC on
the Stanford campus legiti
mate?"
"Should Stanford be engaged
in 'Big Time' sports?"
"What do you think about
Stanford fraternities?"
The Fundamental Standard
amendment to the ASSU by-laws
was given a "pass" recommen
dation yesterday by the LASSU
judicial committee.

The proposed change states
that University rules are not
binding on the Fundamental
Standard. Weinstein explained
that under the new amendment,
"the Fundamental Standard can
not necessarily be invoked over
a conflict of law between the
University and ASSU laws."
The bill reads, in part: "Vio
lations of University regulations
or policy shall not be construed
as per se violations of the Fun
damental Standard."
As an example, Weinstein
pointed out recent demonstra
tors against Central Intelligence
Agency campus recruitment are
being charged with breaking
University policies against dem
onstrations. Passage of the by
laws amendment would insure
that Fundamental Standard vio
lations could not be brought
against them, unless they were
cited for breaking ASSU laws.
A resolution will also be in
troduced attempting to establish
an ASSU policy on demonstra
