The Study of Education is actively seeking
student participation, but responses this fall
have been woefully lacking.
Part of the blame for this apathy must rest
with The Study's past errors in soliciting stu
dent involvement, but this fall has seen a
change in the attitude of SES.
This change, however, has been met by any
thing but an enthusiastic response. SES widely
circulated its position paper on undergraduate
education, followed by a "Town Meeting" in
Tresidder Union where students were encour
aged to question and criticize. What happened?
Only 80 people attended and the great majority
of those were faculty members.
This past Monday the Study invited all resi
dent presidents to attend a briefing on the po
sition paper so they would better be able to
lead discussions on the paper at house meetings.
What happened? Four presidents turned up for
the meeting.
The Study of Education cannot be expected
to continually seek student involvement if past
efforts prove fruitless. Neither can it be expec
ted to stop work, waiting for students to appear
with ideas and criticisms. The Study's deadline
for recommendations is next fall, but it is now
that the guiding philosophy for those recom
mendations is being formed and it is now that
students must take part.
Several weeks ago Herbert Packer, Chairman
of SES, told Peter Lyman, ASSU president, that

he could form an advisory committee of stu
dents which might collectively voice criticism
and opposition to SES proposals, as well as
offer its own proposals.
Two long weeks after that suggestion, Lyman
has decided to take applications for that com
mittee which he describes as a "Student Review
Hoard of SES." Lyman should have acted
sooner.
During the past weeks however, he has talked
to many people asking them to serve on the
committee, only to be met by a stone wall.
There is no doubt he has not received the ac
tive support he expected, but neither has he
generated the provocative and stimulating lead
ership that deserves such support.
It is not too late. A committee will be formed
and its actions can play a very important part
in the future of Stanford. But there can be no
committee unless students begin to get in
volved.
Such involvement is crucial to the success of
Lyman's administration and the success of SES.
The fall of 1967 is not a time for despair and
apathy. This is a year when there is an ASSU
president and a university administration will
ing to open doors for student participation. It
is a year for hope and improvement.
Stanford's future educational structure de
pends in no small measure on students going to
the ASSU offices today to apply for the advis
ory committee.
