# C15 Representation
## 
### 
The Legislature tonight will consider student
appointments to the Committee of 15. Con
ceived as a forum for disputes which have
reached an impass, the committee has recently
been described as the only truly representative
political body on the campus.
The controversy over the appointments arose
at the last LASSU meeting when Peter Lyman,
misreading the intent of the committee and of
the Legislature, attempted to appoint five rep
resentatives of one political viewpoint as the
student members.
The five all express very radical and activist
politics and can hardly be considered represen
tative of the student Ixxly as a whole. Because
they represent such a narrow viewpoint, LASSU
held up the appointments and nominated ad
ditional candidates for the student positions.
Tonight more candidates may be nominated
and LASSU will select the five members it
wishes.
Lyman, in recommending such a narrow slate,
contradicted the purposes of the Committee of
15. The committee was established in response
to the demand for representation of the diverse
constituencies of the university. If the meaning
ful and representative dialogue were to take
place, it was reasoned, the many viewpoints of
the University had to be expressed in an open
and egalitarian forum.
The administration, faculty, and student con

stituencies are therefore represented by five
members each. Yet now, by proposing such a
narrow slate of viewpoints, Lyman is denying
the existence of different viewpoints within the
student constituency, constituencies within the
constituencies, if you like. He implies the stu
dent constituency is of one mind. It is not.
If he were to be really interested in the prin
ciples inherent in the community government
he has so often mentioned, he would select stu
dent members for the Committee of 15 which
in some way express the breadth of student
politics. The 50.01 per cent of the vote Lyman
received last spring does not convince us every
student is radical
This approach has been the source of much
disappointment for Lyman and for all of us
during the last two months. Time and again he
feels he has been let down by the students who
elected him and encouraged him to run.
This is true to a great degree. Those who
rallied to elect him in the spring are largely
interested this fall in other things and have
not enacted the myriads of programs and pro
posals that Lyman articulated last spring.
However, if Lyman continues to see only the
radical student and the activist student as a
member of the student body, he must prepare
himself for much more disappointment. There
are many students and many viewpoints that
must be heard.
