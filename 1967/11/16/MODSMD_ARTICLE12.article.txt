## Choices For Black And White 
### TERRY BARNETT 
"Culture draws lines, starting
patterns./ Then* is u line be
tween you arid me/ between
yours and mine./ How deeply
will I let you touch me?/ How
much can I afford to show/
give/ take? For I must com
munieate and fx* moved by
YOl'. Not the line." ' John Mc-
Cluskeyi
This is what Black on Black,
the first publication of the Black
Student Union, is about: tln
line separating black and white
in America, and what that line
means to seventeen black peo
ple.
Dr. James Gibbs i faculty ad
visor to the Black Student Un
ion i appeals jn the preface for
meaningful communication l>e
tween black and white, asking
that we not only listen to each
other "but that we hear each
other."
Several of the writers clearly
did not share his confidence in
the possibility of all men living
humanely together. These peo
ple gushed pure hatred, flatly
condemning whites for the
atrocity wreaked on black men,
without any glimmer of an at
tempt to impart understanding
which might lead to change
without wholesale destruction.
Tired Of Waiting
From a literary viewpoint,
these writings varied from con
trived to purely narcissistic
jumble almost totally devoid of

any sensitive verbal expression.
These wrilmgs did have some
thing to say that the black man
is tired of waiting, tired of be
ing pushed down, tired of not
being able to look himself in
the face and see a man.
Sylvia Harding says that
"You'd better move over like
Stokely says' Or believe me
white man you'll be wishin (sic)
you were dead. These writings
communicate onh an insistence
that I listen, that I hear: they
take their outrage to be without
any human mutuality.
History supports their dis
belief of expressions of white
ingenuousness toward blacks.
Anyone black or white can see
that white America has never
given a damn about what the
black man thinks: more than
that, whites collectively have
not even recognized the black
as a man, let alone as capable
of thinking.
Drive To Provide Meaning
The black man has for 400
years in America been a Negro,
a term the dictionary shows to
be wholly divorced from any
historical or cultural context
that would lend credence to the
black as a man. The desperate
drive for the black man to give
his life meaning, his hatred for
whites, grows from a belief that
no real dialogue between black
and white is possible, that the
white man will brutishly seek
his own ends as long as he is
able to do so.

Some of the writers sensi
tively called for a different reso
lution. Their work lacked none
of the dynamic power of the
other pieces; they beautifully
humanized both deepest rage
and quietest love. John McClus
key, Robert O'Meally, Johnie
Scott, Art Wilson and A 1 Young
were particularly impressive in
this respect. They decry hate as
the source of their identity: A 1
Young says ". . . nor must you
let the great haters of our time/
rattle in yr (sic) heart/ honey
they are small potatoes/ their
old cries for blood/ may be had/
any afternoon of the millenium/
any portion of this/ schoolroom
globe." Robert O'Meally says
that historically blacks in Am
erica have been "like fleas on
the Great White American
Eagle's back." Some white see
that too, and find it equally in
tolerable. Lawrence Ferlinghetti
writes: ... I am waiting for
someone/ to really discover
America/and wail/ ... I am
waiting/ for the American
Eagle/ to really spread its
wings/ and straighten up and
fly right . .
I don't mean to dichotomize
hate and constructive belief.
Scott says that "here, in my
hatred, is the only love that can
bridge the gap between the
worlds." Yes, "Lying with the
ashes/is the truth, a cripple."
It must be healed. He says of
Watts, ". . . there was never a
thought given ... for the peo
ple." Hate destroys individual
ity, obscuring the possibility of

blacks seeing whites as people,
too. The editorial introduction
to the publication cautioned
readers to remember that the
contributors are expressing
themselves as individuals: too
few of them made recognition
of their audience. After con
demnation, the aim must be to
bridge.
The hate position is not in
herently invalid philosophically.
It assumes consequently from
history that whites should be
destroyed; but this view reflects
the same kind of futile, puerile
historicism of Nat Turner's dis
astrous rebellion.
The other attitude does imply
human regeneration, a growth
of power; Art Wilson chides
"Here, use my glasses Negro,
they are constructed of black/
awareness". But not at the ex
pense of what humanity there
might be on the other side.
John McCluskey finishes "Con
nections":
"My face is
black and mine, but I see it
through YOU.
Mirros do not speak or touch."

the possibility of all men living
humanely together. These peo
ple gushed pure hatred, flatly
condemning whites for the
atrocity wreaked on black men,
without any glimmer of an at
tempt to impart understanding
which might lead to change
without wholesale destruction.
Tired Of Waiting
From a literary viewpoint,
these writings varied from con
trived to purely narcissistic
jumble almost totally devoid of

any sensitive verbal expression.
These wrilmgs did have some
thing to say that the black man
is tired of waiting, tired of be
ing pushed down, tired of not
being able to look himself in
the face and see a man.
Sylvia Harding says that
"You'd better move over like
Stokely says' Or believe me
white man you'll be wishin (sic)
you were dead. These writings
communicate onh an insistence
that I listen, that I hear: they
take their outrage to be without
any human mutuality.
History supports their dis
belief of expressions of white
ingenuousness toward blacks.
Anyone black or white can see
that white America has never
given a damn about what the
black man thinks: more than
that, whites collectively have
not even recognized the black
as a man, let alone as capable
of thinking.
Drive To Provide Meaning
The black man has for 400
years in America been a Negro,
a term the dictionary shows to
be wholly divorced from any
historical or cultural context
that would lend credence to the
black as a man. The desperate
drive for the black man to give
his life meaning, his hatred for
whites, grows from a belief that
no real dialogue between black
and white is possible, that the
white man will brutishly seek
his own ends as long as he is
able to do so.

Some of the writers sensi
tively called for a different reso
lution. Their work lacked none
of the dynamic power of the
other pieces; they beautifully
humanized both deepest rage
and quietest love. John McClus
key, Robert O'Meally, Johnie
Scott, Art Wilson and A 1 Young
were particularly impressive in
this respect. They decry hate as
the source of their identity: A 1
Young says ". . . nor must you
let the great haters of our time/
rattle in yr (sic) heart/ honey
they are small potatoes/ their
old cries for blood/ may be had/
any afternoon of the millenium/
any portion of this/ schoolroom
globe." Robert O'Meally says
that historically blacks in Am
erica have been "like fleas on
the Great White American
Eagle's back." Some white see
that too, and find it equally in
tolerable. Lawrence Ferlinghetti
writes: ... I am waiting for
someone/ to really discover
America/and wail/ ... I am
waiting/ for the American
Eagle/ to really spread its
wings/ and straighten up and
fly right . .
I don't mean to dichotomize
hate and constructive belief.
Scott says that "here, in my
hatred, is the only love that can
bridge the gap between the
worlds." Yes, "Lying with the
ashes/is the truth, a cripple."
It must be healed. He says of
Watts, ". . . there was never a
thought given ... for the peo
ple." Hate destroys individual
ity, obscuring the possibility of

blacks seeing whites as people,
too. The editorial introduction
to the publication cautioned
readers to remember that the
contributors are expressing
themselves as individuals: too
few of them made recognition
of their audience. After con
demnation, the aim must be to
bridge.
The hate position is not in
herently invalid philosophically.
It assumes consequently from
history that whites should be
destroyed; but this view reflects
the same kind of futile, puerile
historicism of Nat Turner's dis
astrous rebellion.
The other attitude does imply
human regeneration, a growth
of power; Art Wilson chides
"Here, use my glasses Negro,
they are constructed of black/
awareness". But not at the ex
pense of what humanity there
might be on the other side.
John McCluskey finishes "Con
nections":
"My face is
black and mine, but I see it
through YOU.
Mirros do not speak or touch."
"Culture draws lines, starting
patterns./ Then* is u line be
tween you arid me/ between
yours and mine./ How deeply
will I let you touch me?/ How
much can I afford to show/
give/ take? For I must com
munieate and fx* moved by

Cluskeyi

take their outrage to be without
any human mutuality.
History supports their dis
belief of expressions of white
ingenuousness toward blacks.
Anyone black or white can see
that white America has never
given a damn about what the
black man thinks: more than
that, whites collectively have
not even recognized the black
as a man, let alone as capable
of thinking.
Drive To Provide Meaning
The black man has for 400
years in America been a Negro,
a term the dictionary shows to
be wholly divorced from any
historical or cultural context
that would lend credence to the
black as a man. The desperate
drive for the black man to give
his life meaning, his hatred for
whites, grows from a belief that
no real dialogue between black
and white is possible, that the
white man will brutishly seek
his own ends as long as he is
able to do so.

Some of the writers sensi
tively called for a different reso
lution. Their work lacked none
of the dynamic power of the
other pieces; they beautifully
humanized both deepest rage
and quietest love. John McClus
key, Robert O'Meally, Johnie
Scott, Art Wilson and A 1 Young
were particularly impressive in
this respect. They decry hate as
the source of their identity: A 1
Young says ". . . nor must you
let the great haters of our time/
rattle in yr (sic) heart/ honey
they are small potatoes/ their
old cries for blood/ may be had/
any afternoon of the millenium/
any portion of this/ schoolroom
globe." Robert O'Meally says
that historically blacks in Am
erica have been "like fleas on
the Great White American
Eagle's back." Some white see
that too, and find it equally in
tolerable. Lawrence Ferlinghetti
writes: ... I am waiting for
someone/ to really discover
America/and wail/ ... I am
waiting/ for the American
Eagle/ to really spread its
wings/ and straighten up and
fly right . .
I don't mean to dichotomize
hate and constructive belief.
Scott says that "here, in my
hatred, is the only love that can
bridge the gap between the
worlds." Yes, "Lying with the
ashes/is the truth, a cripple."
It must be healed. He says of
Watts, ". . . there was never a
thought given ... for the peo
ple." Hate destroys individual
ity, obscuring the possibility of

blacks seeing whites as people,
too. The editorial introduction
to the publication cautioned
readers to remember that the
contributors are expressing
themselves as individuals: too
few of them made recognition
of their audience. After con
demnation, the aim must be to
bridge.
The hate position is not in
herently invalid philosophically.
It assumes consequently from
history that whites should be
destroyed; but this view reflects
the same kind of futile, puerile
historicism of Nat Turner's dis
astrous rebellion.
The other attitude does imply
human regeneration, a growth
of power; Art Wilson chides
"Here, use my glasses Negro,
they are constructed of black/
awareness". But not at the ex
pense of what humanity there
might be on the other side.
John McCluskey finishes "Con
nections":
"My face is
black and mine, but I see it
through YOU.
Mirros do not speak or touch."
"Culture draws lines, starting
patterns./ Then* is u line be
tween you arid me/ between
yours and mine./ How deeply
will I let you touch me?/ How
much can I afford to show/
give/ take? For I must com
munieate and fx* moved by
YOl'. Not the line." ' John Mc-
Cluskeyi
This is what Black on Black,
the first publication of the Black
Student Union, is about: tln
line separating black and white
in America, and what that line
means to seventeen black peo
ple.
Dr. James Gibbs i faculty ad
visor to the Black Student Un
ion i appeals jn the preface for
meaningful communication l>e
tween black and white, asking
that we not only listen to each
other "but that we hear each
other."
Several of the writers clearly
did not share his confidence in
the possibility of all men living
humanely together. These peo
ple gushed pure hatred, flatly
condemning whites for the
atrocity wreaked on black men,
without any glimmer of an at
tempt to impart understanding
which might lead to change
without wholesale destruction.
Tired Of Waiting
From a literary viewpoint,
these writings varied from con
trived to purely narcissistic
jumble almost totally devoid of

any sensitive verbal expression.
These wrilmgs did have some
thing to say that the black man
is tired of waiting, tired of be
ing pushed down, tired of not
being able to look himself in
the face and see a man.
Sylvia Harding says that
"You'd better move over like
Stokely says' Or believe me
white man you'll be wishin (sic)
you were dead. These writings
communicate onh an insistence
that I listen, that I hear: they
