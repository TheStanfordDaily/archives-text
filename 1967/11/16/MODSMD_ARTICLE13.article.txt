# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Shocking Readers With Clean Books 
### Art Buchwald 
Newsweek magazine has just
done a cover story on the "Per
missive Society." The article, il
lustrated with a nude Jane Fon
da, deals with the great strides
that have been made in the last
few years with respect to sex in
films, songs, fashions and, of
course, books.
Since you can't shock Ameri
cans any more with sex, a new
school of writing is now in the
making and I interviewed its
leader, Malcolm McMoral. He is
the author of the first antiporno
graphic novel, "A Kiss on the
Cheek."
"Malcolm, I have read your
book from cover to cover and
didn't find one obscene word.
Did you have a reason for elimi
nating all the dirty words or
were you just trying to shock
your readers?"
"Some reviewers have ac
cused me of the latter, but the
truth of the matter is my char
acters had no reason to curse
and, therefore, I had no reason
to put obscene words in their
mouths."
Only One Kiss
"Malcolm, in your book the
title 'A Kiss on the Cheek' is
apparently taken from a scene
on page 157 where the mother
kisses her 8-year-old son on the
cheek. This is the only kiss in
the book. Why?"
"Every writer has to deal with
life, and that kiss was necessary
for the development of the story.
I didn't just throw it in for the
heck of it."
"I'm not criticizing you for
putting the kiss in. I'm criticiz
ing you because there is abso
lutely no sex in the book at all.
Do you think it's fair for people
to pay $5.95 and not have at
least one really hot love scene
somewhere in your novel?"
"All I can do is refer to the
Supreme Court decision of 1943
which says that you can publish
a book without a love scene in
it, providing it has some social
value."
"So you justify your lack of

love scenes in the book on the
grounds that it has social
value?"
"Yes. Some dirty-mindod peo
ple have accused me of writing
a clean book for money. Well, I
say, who is to judge whether a
book is clean or not? Sure, there
are clean passages in it, but you
have to have those if you're
going to deal with reality."
He Actually Loves Her
"In your book the husband
doesn't even commit adultery.
Don't you think that's going a
bit far?"
"Not in the context of the
story. If you take it out of con
text, certainly it might sound
that way. But the husband hap
pens to be in love with his wife
and that's why people have said
it's a clean book. There are a
lot of cleaner books in drug
stores now, so I don't know why
my book should have been sin
gled out."
"Yet your novel seems to be
some sort of a breakthrough,
and there is fear that other
writers might start copying you,
particularly if you prove there's
money to be made in writing a
clean book."
"That's not my problem. If I
didn't do it, somebody else
would have. Society is changing
all the time. It's true that the
clean novel is considered avant
garde at the moment, but that
doesn't mean it's wrong. Some
day there will be so many clean
books on the market that no one
will be shocked any more.
