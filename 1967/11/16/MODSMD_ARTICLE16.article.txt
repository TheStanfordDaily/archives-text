## Doc Watson 
### JERRY FOGEL 
Doc Watson, considered by
many to be the finest folk and
country musician alive today,
was characteristically outstand
ing in an afternoon perform
ance in the Tresidder Large
Lounge last Friday.
Volumes could be written
about Doc Watson, describing
his unequalled facility with the
guitar, his emotion-laden voice,
his honest, warm personality.
Some might write about him as
a kind of hero, an example of
what a man can do to overcome
adversity if he wants toâ€” he
has been blind since birth.
However, nothing that one
can write or say about Doc Wat
son does him justice. His per
formances are full of life. Like
Theodore Bikel and Pete Seeger,
he brings out the latent human
ity in people.
His Tresidder concert was ar
tistically uneven, although his
rapport with his audience kept
the flaws in the background. He
began with a large number of
country ballads which, on occa

sion, featured his voice but
which rarely indicated his in
strumental skill. Significantly,
the few songs in the first half
which did accent the guitar
were the best received.
Whatever the early part of
the performance lacked was re
gained later. The second half of
the concert seemed to throb
with excitement as Watson
drew repeated gasps from the
audience with seemingly im
possible runs on the guitar.
Toward the end he was joined
by three musicians from Berke
ley. The quartet played a pol
ished set of dance tunes which
highlighted fine fiddle playing
by Hank Bradshaw and unusu
ally good banjo by Rick Chub.
Doc Watson rarely gives a
concert that is not received
with almost unreal enthusiasm
by his listeners. The Tresidder
concert was no exception. There
is a sense about this man which
affects all who see and hear him,
and that sense stays with one
long after the performance is
over.
