# Higher Education Goals For '67 Set By Johnson
## 
### 
COLUMBUS, Ohio (CPS) —
President Johnson today gave
presidents of state colleges and
universities three goals for high
er education to achieve by 1976.
In a telephone hook-up John
son spoke for about 10 minutes
to members of the National As
sociation of State Universities
and Land Grant Colleges and
the Association of State Univer
sities and Colleges outlining
these goals:
Increasing from half to two
thirds the number of high school
students who go on to college.
—"Let's strike down the finan
cial barriers to higher educa
tion. Let's make it national pol
icy that you don't have to be
rich to get an education."
—"Let us do these things
without any decline in quality."
Johnson also talked about the
problems of higher education.
Among them, he said, are the
questions of how the Federal
government plans to assist stu
dents in breaking down those
financial barriers, how to devel
op excellence in higher educa
tion, and how the Federal gov
ernment can help universities
meet their expenses.
The President invited the edu
cators to "enlist in the effort" to
answer these questions.
He also called on them to seek
more funding from private and
state sources. He noted that the
Federal share of support for
education has risen while state
support has remained the same.
He said state support oi edu
cation is "not only a state's
right, it is its responsibility" and
said educators should also ask
for more private support, espe
cially from businessmen.
Although they gave him a cita
tion for helping move the nation
toward the goal of "Educational
Opportunity for All" the educa
tors also intend to ask the Presi
dent to press for even more
Federal assistance for higher
education.
In the program released by
the two associations just before
Johnson spoke, they called for

more Federal funds for higher
education, particularly assist
ance which would be given di
rectly to colleges and universi
ties.
The Association opposed such
proposals for giving money to
students as a tax credit for tui
tion expenses and the "Educa
tional Opportunity Bank," which
would give loans to students,
partly because they feel these
programs would be an open in
vitation to institutions to in
crease student fees. Both propo
sals would give students enough
funds to meet whatever charges
the institutions set.
Johnson said he had hoped to
come to Columbus to speak but
had to stay in Washington to
meet with Vietnam Ambassador
Ellsworth Bunker, Gen. William
Westmoreland, and Secretary of
State Dean Rusk.
