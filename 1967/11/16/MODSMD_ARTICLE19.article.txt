# Frat Issues Challenge To Cal To Test Water Cannon Skill
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Members of the Kappa Alpha
fraternity have challenged the
students at Cal to a water bal
loon slinging contest.
Bob Parsons issued the chal
lenge on behalf of the students
who built Stanford's water can
non as an engineering project.
Last year Cal students bom
barded the Stanford cheering
section with water balloons
slung by a sling shot.
If Cal accepts the challenge,
the match will be held in White
Memorial Plaza shooting to
wards the Business School. It
is tentatively set for 12:00 noon
on Saturday.
Whether or not Cal accepts
the challenge to a duel, the wa
ter cannon will not be smuggled
into the stadium to blast the
California rooting section.
A Weapon of Destruction
Parsons stated that the can
non will not be used offensively
though "it would have been a
hell of a lot of fun." He de
scribed the bazooka shaped
weapon of destruction as "more
in line with a mortar" than
with a bazooka.
The weapon was designed by

Parsons in conjunction with
Dick Barklcy, now-., a graduate
student at MIT. It was original
ly conceived as an engineering
project for Professor Robert Mc-
Kim. McKim had no part iti the
planning of the machine as was
reported in yesterday's Daily.
Parsons quoted McKim as
calling the project "the most
difficult undertaken last year."
Parsons and Barkley worked
on the project over the summer
in a successful attempt to in
crease the weapon's range and
accuracy. Barkley has been
mailing improved parts to Stan
ford as they have been manu
factured.
Fantastic Accuracy
In testing yesterday, the can
non proved accurate to within
seven feet at a distance of 175
yards, once it had been zeroed
in on the target. The zeroing in
process takes no more than
three test shots.
According to Parsons the test
firings were held on the stadium
grounds. The participants in the
test practiced by taking pot
shots at one another.
Over 130 man-hours were
spent on the testing phase of
the project, while about 150

were spent in the initial devel
opment of the weapons system.
The University gave permis
sion for the contest on the con
dition that the firings not be
held in the stadium.

at a distance of 175 yards, given three chances to aim it.

KAPPA ALPHA FRATERNITY MEMBERS Bob Parsons and Neil
Ciarfalia prepare to test the water cannon in the stadium. Parsons is
the co-designer of the cannon. In an interview with "The Daily", Par
sons stated that the cannon can hit within 7 feet of a given point
at a distance of 175 yards, given three chances to aim it.
Members of the Kappa Alpha
fraternity have challenged the
students at Cal to a water bal
loon slinging contest.
Bob Parsons issued the chal
lenge on behalf of the students
who built Stanford's water can
non as an engineering project.
Last year Cal students bom
barded the Stanford cheering
section with water balloons
slung by a sling shot.
If Cal accepts the challenge,
the match will be held in White
Memorial Plaza shooting to
wards the Business School. It
is tentatively set for 12:00 noon
on Saturday.
Whether or not Cal accepts
the challenge to a duel, the wa
ter cannon will not be smuggled
into the stadium to blast the
California rooting section.
A Weapon of Destruction
Parsons stated that the can
non will not be used offensively
though "it would have been a
hell of a lot of fun." He de
scribed the bazooka shaped
weapon of destruction as "more
in line with a mortar" than
with a bazooka.
The weapon was designed by

Parsons in conjunction with
Dick Barklcy, now-., a graduate
student at MIT. It was original
ly conceived as an engineering
project for Professor Robert Mc-
Kim. McKim had no part iti the
planning of the machine as was
reported in yesterday's Daily.
Parsons quoted McKim as
calling the project "the most
difficult undertaken last year."
Parsons and Barkley worked
on the project over the summer
in a successful attempt to in
crease the weapon's range and
accuracy. Barkley has been
mailing improved parts to Stan
ford as they have been manu
factured.
Fantastic Accuracy
In testing yesterday, the can
non proved accurate to within
seven feet at a distance of 175
yards, once it had been zeroed
in on the target. The zeroing in
process takes no more than
three test shots.
According to Parsons the test
firings were held on the stadium
grounds. The participants in the
test practiced by taking pot
shots at one another.
Over 130 man-hours were
spent on the testing phase of
the project, while about 150

were spent in the initial devel
opment of the weapons system.
The University gave permis
sion for the contest on the con
dition that the firings not be
held in the stadium.
