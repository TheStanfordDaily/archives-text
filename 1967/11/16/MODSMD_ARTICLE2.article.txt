# Answers SES
## Society Studies Engineering 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The Engineering School's an
swer to the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) will come
Monday night at an open meet
ing on the Stanford engineering
program.
The meeting, sponsored by en
gineering honors society Tau
Beta Pi, will be held at 7:30 p.m.
in the Large Lounge, Trosidder.
Several SES steering commit
tee members, including James
Gibbons, associate professor of
engineering, and SES Staff Di
rector Robert Hind, will answer
audience questions.
A SES position paper on un
dergraduate education, issued

last month scarcely mentioned
the engineering, but proposed
widespread loosening of the
General Studies requirements.
Tau Beta Pi President Eck
hard Schulz, a senior from Ger
many in electrical engineering,
said the meeting's purpose is to
make SES and engineering fac
ulty aware of the opinions of
engineering students about their
education. It is open to all engi
neering faculty and students.
"The trouble is that engineer
ing students just don't talk,"
Schulz said. "They aren't on the
SES subcommittees and they
have few legislature representa
tives.

"If we don't, say what we
want, we're bound to be ignored
by SES" he added. "SES will
certainly affect engineering edu
cation."
Tau Beta Pi's meeting follows
completion of a year-long study
of the engineering core curricu
lum. This 100-page document,
which will soon be released,
criticizes the rigid requirements
for engineering degrees, course
by course.
"But the overall, broad out
look on engineering was missed
by that study," Schulz believes.
"It looked at the individual
courses but did not look into the
question of whether we even
need a core curriculum."
Schulz feels that the recom
mendations of the Tau Beta Pi
report could most easily go into
effect as part of a general SES
overhaul of undergraduate edu
cation.
SES Position Paper
The Monday meeting will be
gin with an introduction of the
SES representatives by Schulz,
followed by a free exchange of
ideas and questions dealing with
the SES position paper and oth
er issues. Schulz has urged all
who plan to attend to read the
position paper.
Schulz hopes to learn how
much consideration was given to
the engineering program by the
steering committee before the
position paper was written.

There is little mention of the
complex curriculum problems of
engineering, Schulz maintains,
and no evidence that the com
mittee as a whole really under
stands the problems of an engi
neering student struggling to
earn his degree in four years.
Another issue is the language
requirement. Schulz, who came
to this country in 1963, hopes
requirements will be changed to
allow engineering students to
learn a foreign language, some
thing few are now able to do.

engineering, and SES Staff Di
rector Robert Hind, will answer
audience questions.
A SES position paper on un
dergraduate education, issued

last month scarcely mentioned
the engineering, but proposed
widespread loosening of the
General Studies requirements.
Tau Beta Pi President Eck
hard Schulz, a senior from Ger
many in electrical engineering,
said the meeting's purpose is to
make SES and engineering fac
ulty aware of the opinions of
engineering students about their
education. It is open to all engi
neering faculty and students.
"The trouble is that engineer
ing students just don't talk,"
Schulz said. "They aren't on the
SES subcommittees and they
have few legislature representa
tives.

"If we don't, say what we
want, we're bound to be ignored
by SES" he added. "SES will
certainly affect engineering edu
cation."
Tau Beta Pi's meeting follows
completion of a year-long study
of the engineering core curricu
lum. This 100-page document,
which will soon be released,
criticizes the rigid requirements
for engineering degrees, course
by course.
"But the overall, broad out
look on engineering was missed
by that study," Schulz believes.
"It looked at the individual
courses but did not look into the
question of whether we even
need a core curriculum."
Schulz feels that the recom
mendations of the Tau Beta Pi
report could most easily go into
effect as part of a general SES
overhaul of undergraduate edu
cation.
SES Position Paper
The Monday meeting will be
gin with an introduction of the
SES representatives by Schulz,
followed by a free exchange of
ideas and questions dealing with
the SES position paper and oth
er issues. Schulz has urged all
who plan to attend to read the
position paper.
Schulz hopes to learn how
much consideration was given to
the engineering program by the
steering committee before the
position paper was written.

There is little mention of the
complex curriculum problems of
engineering, Schulz maintains,
and no evidence that the com
mittee as a whole really under
stands the problems of an engi
neering student struggling to
earn his degree in four years.
Another issue is the language
requirement. Schulz, who came
to this country in 1963, hopes
requirements will be changed to
allow engineering students to
learn a foreign language, some
thing few are now able to do.
The Engineering School's an
swer to the Study of Education
at Stanford (SES) will come
Monday night at an open meet
ing on the Stanford engineering
program.
The meeting, sponsored by en
gineering honors society Tau
Beta Pi, will be held at 7:30 p.m.
in the Large Lounge, Trosidder.
Several SES steering commit
tee members, including James
