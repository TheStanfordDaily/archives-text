# Directories Can Be Fun
## 
### VALERIE WESTEN 
Stanford students' statistics
could very well provide delight
ful conversation topics at your
next cocktail party. Have you
considered that there are 11,440
students enrolled this quarter,
and that the ratio can be broken
down to 8814: 2626 (men to
women) ?
If you can pronounce it, you
will be able to discuss the long
est name in the 1967 Autumn
Quarter Directory — Bahiagui
maraes.
But then if you are concerned
with quantity rather than qual
ity you might be inclined to talk
about the fact there are no few
er than 58 Browns, 71 Johnsons,
and the winner and champion
remains Smith with a new high
of 96.
For the amateur detectives,
the student directory provides a
myriad of facts for testing one's

abilities. Given the material at
hand, could you, for example,
locate the other 15 students
from your home state of New
Hampshire, or could you devise
a method of determining whelh
er Chris Katzenbach is the son
of Nicholas deß?
Or possibly you can surprise
your friends with little known
facts about them. For example
won't Kathy Nixon be snowed
the first time you call her
Sarah?
For those who are inclined to
make puns, why not try making
sentences from names. The
nouns available, including Beer,
Flood, Lane, Stone, and Wade,
are only a few of the possible
starting points. Some clever in
dividual could go so far as to
publish his witticisms; a sug
gested title might be How to
Amuse Your Friends and Make
Enemies.
For you Stanford girls who

have not yet snagged your Stan
ford man, you might look into
Electrical Engineering or the
School of Business, for men
there form the overwhelming
majority of students.
On the other hand, for the
man who would like to even up
the odds, may I suggest the
School of Education, Anthropol
ogy, Art, or as a last resort, the
School of Nursing?
