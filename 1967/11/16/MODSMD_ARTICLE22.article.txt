# Students Organize Campus Life Club
## 
### 
A group of Stanford students
have formed a "College Life"
club, a continuation of the
Young Life clubs in many high
schools.
Despite similarities in the pro
grams, club chairman Clif Da
vidson stressed that Campus
Life is not "just an old Young
Life." He claimed that Campus
Life is "gauged to the college
student," characterizing it as
"challenging, meaningful."
According to Davidson, the
club's practical value is that
through it "people can get to
gether and talk about things
from a Christian point of view."
Open Membership
However, membership or at
tendence is not limited to any
particular sect or to Christians.
Davidson feels that response

to Campus Life has been indica
tive of a great demand for such
a group at Stanford.
Craig Schindler spoke at the
club's first meeting, last Monday
in the clubhouse. Activities also
included folksinging and a
"spontaneous melodrama."
No Strings Attached
Future meetings are planned
for every three weeks and will
last about an hour. Davidson
said that there are "no strings
attached in attending."
The next meeting is scheduled
for December 4.
The club is also sponsoring
Bible study groups and a lead
ership program in which Stan
ford students assist Young Life
Clubs at local high schools.
Davidson may be contacted at
Alpha Tau Omega fraternity
for further information.
