# First-Hand Report
## Toro Sets Pizza Run Record 
### BOB RUND 
(Editor's Note: Mr. Itund is
a member of K1 Toro eating club,
a well-known gang of pizza-run
ners.)
Screaming and shouting hys
terically, we stampeded from the
"L", past the Pavilion, breaking
the tranquility of last Sunday's
pro-dawn air.
It was 4:13 a.m. and 14 mem
bers of El Toro eating club were
seeing varsity cross country run
ner Allen Sanford off on the first
leg of a 120 mile pizza run to
Sacramento. We were carrying a
mushroom pizza to the captital
to give to the governor.
Since distance runners com
prise nearly half the Toro mem
bership, we planned an all-out
assault on the world pizza run
record in time, distance and
speed.
The record is held by Theta
Xi fraternity at Lafayette Col
lege, Allentown, Pa., who car
ried a pizza 23 miles in 2 hours
and 25 minutes.
We wrapped our apolitical piz
za in four or five layers of alu
minum foil and pinned it on
the inside of Harry Kcllogg's
bicycle back pack. Strings were
attached to the pack and fitted
on the runners' shoulders.
Sanford had barely started
when a patrol car, flashing its
lights menacingly, blocked our
path back to the cars.
"Hold it right there, every

body," the cop's voice boomed.
John Boeschen and Alex Whit
tle, hoping to quickly correct
the situation, told the officer,
"We're just running a pizza to
Sacramento."
"Sure you are," he replied
scornfully.
Finally, after a few minutes
of fast talking and showing his
identification, Boeschen con
vinced him that we weren't Cal
pranksters and that we were
actually running a pizza to Sac
ramento.
Before continuing on our way
we decided to buy some copies
of the Palo Alto Times, which
had announced the relay at
tempt, and to give them to the
drivers of the three cars as
proof to the police in case they
were stopped again.
At the start of the Dumbarton
Bridge, Gary Montante had just
taken the first pizza hand-off
from Sanford when flashing
lights were spotted again. Mon
tante kept going while we park
ed the cars and jumped out wav
ing newspapers.
The policemen asked us if
there had been an accident since
we were travelling so slowly.
Jeff Richey started to explain,
"We are running a . . . "
He was cut short by the other
policeman who starting bounc
ing up and down in his seat and
blurted out in recognition,
"You're the pizza runners!"

This unexpected notoriety
really inspired the runners; so
much that they began quarrel
ling over who would get to run
the next leg.
Roy Otis was given the honor
of sneaking through the toll
gate at the east side of the Dum
barton Bridge. We hoped that
this would be our last encounter
with the cops, but right outside
of Fremont, flashing red and
white lights again beamed omi
nously.
All Points Bulletin
The drivers, Larry Bowerman,
John Richards, and Alex Whit
tle, again jumped out of the
cars waving the prized articles.
After reading the article the
patrolman wired an all-points
bulletin ahead to let the runners
pass and pointed out an alter
nate route that would allow them
to avoid the famed "Livermore
Hill."
At about 6:20 a.m. Sterling
Speirn, Steve Lawry and I kick
ed in the last mile and a half to
break the Theta Xi's 23 mile
record by 1(! minutes. We now
had a mere 97 miles to go.
Two hours later Dennis Mesiek
blasted through the 50-mile
mark, located in the foothills
outside of Livermore.
The relay passes of the pack

became more hilarious as the
string fastening the pack to the
runner became knotted.
Passing cars slowed down as
they saw John Richards run
after Bill Bryson with a knife
to cut the knotted string.
Bruce Sramek also attracted
undue attention by wearing a
Mill's College T-shirt that hung
down below his shorts. A Pon
tiac containing two blondes
cirlced the block three times
whistling and waving at Sramek
as he ran.
Everyone ran the last mile,
arriving at the Capitol at 4:00
p.m., fully expecting a team of
photographers and reporters.
Only the elevator lady was there
to greet us.
No Photographers
We crowded into the Capitol
elevator and went to the 2nd
lloor IT PI office. The operator
said that all the photographers
were gone, but that he would
send a few paragraphs over the
wire.
This satisfied some, but a few
members thought that since
they had carried the pizza so
far, they should give it to some
one. All the state offices were
closed, so we decided to take
the pizza to Ronnie's house.
After all, we had just set a
world record: 120 miles in 11

hours, 47 minutes, a 5:53 per
mile pace.
The sight of 14 dirty, sweaty
boys jumping out of the cars
made the Reagans' guard ex
tremely uneasy. He stared at
us and we stared back at him.
Finally relay spokesman Steve
Lawry took the precious clip
ping up to the befuddled guard
and lor five minutes pleaded
with him to give the El Toro
runners an audience with the
Governor. Alter several phone
calls, he told us that Reagan had
just returned from a speaking
engagement in Washington and
Oregon, and was sleeping, but
informed us that Mrs. Reagan
would come out.
She was somewhat incredu
lous when Lawry handed her a
pizza, and informed her that we
had carried it from Stanford
especially for Governor Reagan.
She asked us why we picked
the Governor to receive our piz
za, and Lawry quipped that he
couldn't think of anyone more
logical to be the recipient. Laugh
ingly, she said she couldn't
either.
It took five minutes for her
to unwrap the pizza, but her
doubts about El Toro's claim
were immediately dispelled.
Every mushroom on the cold,
squashed pizza was still there.

were immediately dispelled.
Every mushroom on the cold,
squashed pizza was still there.
(Editor's Note: Mr. Itund is
a member of K1 Toro eating club,
a well-known gang of pizza-run
ners.)
Screaming and shouting hys
terically, we stampeded from the
"L", past the Pavilion, breaking
the tranquility of last Sunday's
pro-dawn air.
It was 4:13 a.m. and 14 mem
bers of El Toro eating club were
seeing varsity cross country run
ner Allen Sanford off on the first
leg of a 120 mile pizza run to
Sacramento. We were carrying a
mushroom pizza to the captital
to give to the governor.
Since distance runners com
prise nearly half the Toro mem
bership, we planned an all-out
assault on the world pizza run
record in time, distance and
speed.
The record is held by Theta
Xi fraternity at Lafayette Col
lege, Allentown, Pa., who car
ried a pizza 23 miles in 2 hours
and 25 minutes.
We wrapped our apolitical piz
za in four or five layers of alu
minum foil and pinned it on
the inside of Harry Kcllogg's
bicycle back pack. Strings were
attached to the pack and fitted
on the runners' shoulders.
Sanford had barely started
when a patrol car, flashing its
lights menacingly, blocked our
path back to the cars.
"Hold it right there, every

body," the cop's voice boomed.
John Boeschen and Alex Whit
tle, hoping to quickly correct
the situation, told the officer,
"We're just running a pizza to
Sacramento."
"Sure you are," he replied
scornfully.
Finally, after a few minutes
of fast talking and showing his
identification, Boeschen con
vinced him that we weren't Cal
pranksters and that we were
actually running a pizza to Sac
ramento.
Before continuing on our way
we decided to buy some copies
of the Palo Alto Times, which
had announced the relay at
tempt, and to give them to the
drivers of the three cars as
proof to the police in case they
were stopped again.
At the start of the Dumbarton
Bridge, Gary Montante had just
taken the first pizza hand-off
from Sanford when flashing
lights were spotted again. Mon
tante kept going while we park
ed the cars and jumped out wav
ing newspapers.
The policemen asked us if
there had been an accident since
we were travelling so slowly.
Jeff Richey started to explain,
"We are running a . . . "
He was cut short by the other
policeman who starting bounc
ing up and down in his seat and
blurted out in recognition,
"You're the pizza runners!"

This unexpected notoriety
really inspired the runners; so
much that they began quarrel
ling over who would get to run
the next leg.
Roy Otis was given the honor
of sneaking through the toll
gate at the east side of the Dum
barton Bridge. We hoped that
this would be our last encounter
with the cops, but right outside
of Fremont, flashing red and
white lights again beamed omi
nously.
All Points Bulletin
The drivers, Larry Bowerman,
John Richards, and Alex Whit
tle, again jumped out of the
cars waving the prized articles.
After reading the article the
patrolman wired an all-points
bulletin ahead to let the runners
pass and pointed out an alter
nate route that would allow them
to avoid the famed "Livermore
Hill."
At about 6:20 a.m. Sterling
Speirn, Steve Lawry and I kick
ed in the last mile and a half to
break the Theta Xi's 23 mile
record by 1(! minutes. We now
had a mere 97 miles to go.
Two hours later Dennis Mesiek
blasted through the 50-mile
mark, located in the foothills
outside of Livermore.
The relay passes of the pack

became more hilarious as the
string fastening the pack to the
runner became knotted.
Passing cars slowed down as
they saw John Richards run
after Bill Bryson with a knife
to cut the knotted string.
Bruce Sramek also attracted
undue attention by wearing a
Mill's College T-shirt that hung
down below his shorts. A Pon
tiac containing two blondes
cirlced the block three times
whistling and waving at Sramek
as he ran.
Everyone ran the last mile,
arriving at the Capitol at 4:00
p.m., fully expecting a team of
photographers and reporters.
Only the elevator lady was there
to greet us.
No Photographers
We crowded into the Capitol
elevator and went to the 2nd
lloor IT PI office. The operator
said that all the photographers
were gone, but that he would
send a few paragraphs over the
wire.
This satisfied some, but a few
members thought that since
they had carried the pizza so
far, they should give it to some
one. All the state offices were
closed, so we decided to take
the pizza to Ronnie's house.
After all, we had just set a
world record: 120 miles in 11

hours, 47 minutes, a 5:53 per
mile pace.
The sight of 14 dirty, sweaty
boys jumping out of the cars
made the Reagans' guard ex
tremely uneasy. He stared at
us and we stared back at him.
Finally relay spokesman Steve
Lawry took the precious clip
ping up to the befuddled guard
and lor five minutes pleaded
with him to give the El Toro
runners an audience with the
Governor. Alter several phone
calls, he told us that Reagan had
just returned from a speaking
engagement in Washington and
Oregon, and was sleeping, but
informed us that Mrs. Reagan
would come out.
She was somewhat incredu
lous when Lawry handed her a
pizza, and informed her that we
had carried it from Stanford
especially for Governor Reagan.
She asked us why we picked
the Governor to receive our piz
za, and Lawry quipped that he
couldn't think of anyone more
logical to be the recipient. Laugh
ingly, she said she couldn't
either.
It took five minutes for her
to unwrap the pizza, but her
doubts about El Toro's claim
were immediately dispelled.

to unwrap the pizza, but her
doubts about El Toro's claim
were immediately dispelled.
Every mushroom on the cold,
squashed pizza was still there.
(Editor's Note: Mr. Itund is
a member of K1 Toro eating club,
a well-known gang of pizza-run
ners.)
Screaming and shouting hys
terically, we stampeded from the
"L", past the Pavilion, breaking
the tranquility of last Sunday's
pro-dawn air.
It was 4:13 a.m. and 14 mem
bers of El Toro eating club were
seeing varsity cross country run
ner Allen Sanford off on the first
leg of a 120 mile pizza run to
Sacramento. We were carrying a
mushroom pizza to the captital
to give to the governor.
Since distance runners com
prise nearly half the Toro mem
bership, we planned an all-out
assault on the world pizza run
record in time, distance and
speed.
The record is held by Theta
Xi fraternity at Lafayette Col
lege, Allentown, Pa., who car
ried a pizza 23 miles in 2 hours
and 25 minutes.
We wrapped our apolitical piz
za in four or five layers of alu
minum foil and pinned it on
the inside of Harry Kcllogg's
bicycle back pack. Strings were
attached to the pack and fitted
on the runners' shoulders.
Sanford had barely started
when a patrol car, flashing its
lights menacingly, blocked our
path back to the cars.
"Hold it right there, every

body," the cop's voice boomed.
John Boeschen and Alex Whit
tle, hoping to quickly correct
the situation, told the officer,
"We're just running a pizza to
Sacramento."
"Sure you are," he replied
scornfully.
Finally, after a few minutes
of fast talking and showing his
identification, Boeschen con
vinced him that we weren't Cal
pranksters and that we were
actually running a pizza to Sac
ramento.
Before continuing on our way
we decided to buy some copies
of the Palo Alto Times, which
had announced the relay at
tempt, and to give them to the
drivers of the three cars as
proof to the police in case they
were stopped again.
At the start of the Dumbarton
Bridge, Gary Montante had just
taken the first pizza hand-off
from Sanford when flashing
lights were spotted again. Mon
tante kept going while we park
ed the cars and jumped out wav
ing newspapers.
The policemen asked us if
there had been an accident since
we were travelling so slowly.
Jeff Richey started to explain,
"We are running a . . . "
He was cut short by the other
policeman who starting bounc
ing up and down in his seat and
blurted out in recognition,
"You're the pizza runners!"

This unexpected notoriety
really inspired the runners; so
much that they began quarrel
ling over who would get to run
the next leg.
Roy Otis was given the honor
of sneaking through the toll
gate at the east side of the Dum
barton Bridge. We hoped that
this would be our last encounter
with the cops, but right outside
of Fremont, flashing red and
white lights again beamed omi
nously.
All Points Bulletin
The drivers, Larry Bowerman,
John Richards, and Alex Whit
tle, again jumped out of the
cars waving the prized articles.
After reading the article the
patrolman wired an all-points
bulletin ahead to let the runners
pass and pointed out an alter
nate route that would allow them
to avoid the famed "Livermore
Hill."
At about 6:20 a.m. Sterling
Speirn, Steve Lawry and I kick
ed in the last mile and a half to
break the Theta Xi's 23 mile
record by 1(! minutes. We now
had a mere 97 miles to go.
Two hours later Dennis Mesiek
blasted through the 50-mile
mark, located in the foothills
outside of Livermore.
The relay passes of the pack

became more hilarious as the
string fastening the pack to the
runner became knotted.
Passing cars slowed down as
they saw John Richards run
after Bill Bryson with a knife
to cut the knotted string.
Bruce Sramek also attracted
undue attention by wearing a
Mill's College T-shirt that hung
down below his shorts. A Pon
tiac containing two blondes
cirlced the block three times
whistling and waving at Sramek
as he ran.
Everyone ran the last mile,
arriving at the Capitol at 4:00
p.m., fully expecting a team of
photographers and reporters.
Only the elevator lady was there
to greet us.
No Photographers
We crowded into the Capitol
elevator and went to the 2nd
lloor IT PI office. The operator
said that all the photographers
were gone, but that he would
send a few paragraphs over the
wire.
This satisfied some, but a few
members thought that since
they had carried the pizza so
far, they should give it to some
one. All the state offices were
closed, so we decided to take
the pizza to Ronnie's house.
After all, we had just set a
world record: 120 miles in 11

hours, 47 minutes, a 5:53 per
mile pace.
The sight of 14 dirty, sweaty
boys jumping out of the cars
made the Reagans' guard ex
tremely uneasy. He stared at
us and we stared back at him.
Finally relay spokesman Steve
Lawry took the precious clip
ping up to the befuddled guard
and lor five minutes pleaded
with him to give the El Toro
runners an audience with the
Governor. Alter several phone
calls, he told us that Reagan had
just returned from a speaking
engagement in Washington and
Oregon, and was sleeping, but
informed us that Mrs. Reagan
would come out.
She was somewhat incredu
lous when Lawry handed her a
pizza, and informed her that we
had carried it from Stanford
especially for Governor Reagan.
She asked us why we picked
the Governor to receive our piz
za, and Lawry quipped that he
couldn't think of anyone more
logical to be the recipient. Laugh
ingly, she said she couldn't
either.
It took five minutes for her
to unwrap the pizza, but her
doubts about El Toro's claim
were immediately dispelled.
Every mushroom on the cold,

either.
It took five minutes for her
to unwrap the pizza, but her
doubts about El Toro's claim
were immediately dispelled.
Every mushroom on the cold,
squashed pizza was still there.
(Editor's Note: Mr. Itund is
a member of K1 Toro eating club,
a well-known gang of pizza-run
ners.)
Screaming and shouting hys
terically, we stampeded from the
"L", past the Pavilion, breaking
the tranquility of last Sunday's
pro-dawn air.
It was 4:13 a.m. and 14 mem
bers of El Toro eating club were
seeing varsity cross country run
ner Allen Sanford off on the first
leg of a 120 mile pizza run to
Sacramento. We were carrying a
mushroom pizza to the captital
to give to the governor.
Since distance runners com
prise nearly half the Toro mem
bership, we planned an all-out
assault on the world pizza run
record in time, distance and
speed.
The record is held by Theta
Xi fraternity at Lafayette Col
lege, Allentown, Pa., who car
ried a pizza 23 miles in 2 hours
and 25 minutes.
We wrapped our apolitical piz
za in four or five layers of alu
minum foil and pinned it on
the inside of Harry Kcllogg's
bicycle back pack. Strings were
attached to the pack and fitted
on the runners' shoulders.
Sanford had barely started
when a patrol car, flashing its
lights menacingly, blocked our
path back to the cars.
"Hold it right there, every

body," the cop's voice boomed.
John Boeschen and Alex Whit
tle, hoping to quickly correct
the situation, told the officer,
"We're just running a pizza to
Sacramento."
"Sure you are," he replied
scornfully.
Finally, after a few minutes
of fast talking and showing his
identification, Boeschen con
vinced him that we weren't Cal
pranksters and that we were
actually running a pizza to Sac
ramento.
Before continuing on our way
we decided to buy some copies
of the Palo Alto Times, which
had announced the relay at
tempt, and to give them to the
drivers of the three cars as
proof to the police in case they
were stopped again.
At the start of the Dumbarton
Bridge, Gary Montante had just
taken the first pizza hand-off
from Sanford when flashing
lights were spotted again. Mon
tante kept going while we park
ed the cars and jumped out wav
ing newspapers.
The policemen asked us if
there had been an accident since
we were travelling so slowly.
Jeff Richey started to explain,
"We are running a . . . "
He was cut short by the other
policeman who starting bounc
ing up and down in his seat and
blurted out in recognition,
"You're the pizza runners!"

This unexpected notoriety
really inspired the runners; so
much that they began quarrel
ling over who would get to run
the next leg.
Roy Otis was given the honor
of sneaking through the toll
gate at the east side of the Dum
barton Bridge. We hoped that
this would be our last encounter
with the cops, but right outside
of Fremont, flashing red and
white lights again beamed omi
nously.
All Points Bulletin
The drivers, Larry Bowerman,
John Richards, and Alex Whit
tle, again jumped out of the
cars waving the prized articles.
After reading the article the
patrolman wired an all-points
bulletin ahead to let the runners
pass and pointed out an alter
nate route that would allow them
to avoid the famed "Livermore
Hill."
At about 6:20 a.m. Sterling
Speirn, Steve Lawry and I kick
ed in the last mile and a half to
break the Theta Xi's 23 mile
record by 1(! minutes. We now
had a mere 97 miles to go.
Two hours later Dennis Mesiek
blasted through the 50-mile
mark, located in the foothills
outside of Livermore.
The relay passes of the pack

became more hilarious as the
string fastening the pack to the
runner became knotted.
Passing cars slowed down as
they saw John Richards run
after Bill Bryson with a knife
to cut the knotted string.
Bruce Sramek also attracted
undue attention by wearing a
Mill's College T-shirt that hung
down below his shorts. A Pon
tiac containing two blondes
cirlced the block three times
whistling and waving at Sramek
as he ran.
Everyone ran the last mile,
arriving at the Capitol at 4:00
p.m., fully expecting a team of
photographers and reporters.
Only the elevator lady was there
to greet us.
No Photographers
We crowded into the Capitol
elevator and went to the 2nd
lloor IT PI office. The operator
said that all the photographers
were gone, but that he would
send a few paragraphs over the
wire.
This satisfied some, but a few
members thought that since
they had carried the pizza so
far, they should give it to some
one. All the state offices were
closed, so we decided to take
the pizza to Ronnie's house.
After all, we had just set a
world record: 120 miles in 11

hours, 47 minutes, a 5:53 per
mile pace.
The sight of 14 dirty, sweaty
boys jumping out of the cars
made the Reagans' guard ex
tremely uneasy. He stared at
us and we stared back at him.
Finally relay spokesman Steve
Lawry took the precious clip
ping up to the befuddled guard
and lor five minutes pleaded
with him to give the El Toro
runners an audience with the
Governor. Alter several phone
calls, he told us that Reagan had
just returned from a speaking
engagement in Washington and
Oregon, and was sleeping, but
informed us that Mrs. Reagan
would come out.
She was somewhat incredu
lous when Lawry handed her a
pizza, and informed her that we
had carried it from Stanford
especially for Governor Reagan.
She asked us why we picked
the Governor to receive our piz
za, and Lawry quipped that he
couldn't think of anyone more
logical to be the recipient. Laugh
ingly, she said she couldn't
either.
It took five minutes for her
to unwrap the pizza, but her
doubts about El Toro's claim
were immediately dispelled.
Every mushroom on the cold,
squashed pizza was still there.
