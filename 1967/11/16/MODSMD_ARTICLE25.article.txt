# Theta Delt Aerials Capture IM Title
## 
### JOHN WRIGHT 
The passing wizardry of quar
terback Fred Moseley ignited the
Theta Delts to a 25-13 victory
over the Zetes yesterday in the
championship game of the in
tramural touch football play
offs.
The strong-armed Moseley
fired four touchdown passes, in
cluding two into the sure hands
of John Scales, and one each to

Bob Johnston and Steve Am
nions.
The Theta Delts appeared to
have the game wrapped up mid
way in the second half with a
19-6 lead, but the Zetes came
roaring back on a fifty-yard
bomb from John Frankovich to
Mar Agnew.
Frankovich's extra-point pass
also connected, and suddenly the
Theta Delts found themselves

with a shaky 19-13 lead with sev
eral minutes still to play.
The Long- Bomb
Moseley answered the chal
lenge. After a couple of short
completions to Scales and John
ston, he unloaded a monstrous
pass, leading Steve Ammons by
a good ten to fifteen yards.
His legs churning like pistons,
Ammons drew away from Zetn
safety Dennis Lockhart and

made an unbelievable fingertip
catch before somersaulting to
the ground beyond the goalline.
The extra-point play failed;
but with a twelve-point lead and
a minute and a half left, the
Theta Delt defense had little
trouble stopping a desperation
drive by the Zetes.
On the final play of the game,
Frankovich rifled a long bomb
in the general direction of the
endzone.
Moseley, who played defensive
safety as well as quarterback,
intercepted on the goalline and
ran out the clock.
The first half had been an
even struggle, as each team
scored once and missed the extra
point.
The first time the Theta Delts
got their hands on the ball, it
took only three plays for them
to score. After a roughing tho
passer penalty, Moseley zeroed
in on Scales three consecutive
times.
The third time Scales had

worked himself free in the end
zone, and the Theta Delts enjoy
ed an early 6-0 lead.
Zetes Bounce Back
Frankovich, a recent transfer
from the Naval Academy who
showed a tremendous amount of
poise all season, brought the
Zetes right back to tie the score.
Behind good protection, Frank
ovich bulleted passes to Agnew
and Ted Boutacoff before hitting
Agnew for the touchdown from
thirty yards.
Brad Alden later caught a
Frankovich toss just before

stepping out of the endzone, but
the Theta Delts took over on the
next play by foiling a Zete re
verse.
The Zete defense held tough,
however, and forced a punt with
just seconds remaining in the
half.
Another long pass from Frank
ovich resulted in a fantastic
catch by Gil Stansbury just short
of the goalline as time ran out.
Second Half Explosion
The Theta Delts wasted no
time moving in front at the
start of the second half.

Moseley threw eight consecu
tive passes, connecting with Phil
Ensz, Johnston, and Scales on
the drive.
Johnston angled over center
and took in a ten-yard pitch from
Moseley for the score.
The same combination click
ed for the extra point to make
the score 13-6.
A TD pass to Scales was nulli
fied by an illegal procedure pen
alty; but two plays later, Mose
ley called the same pattern and
this time Scales hit paydirt to
make it 19-6.

The passing wizardry of quar
terback Fred Moseley ignited the
Theta Delts to a 25-13 victory
over the Zetes yesterday in the
championship game of the in
tramural touch football play
offs.
The strong-armed Moseley
fired four touchdown passes, in
cluding two into the sure hands
of John Scales, and one each to

Bob Johnston and Steve Am
nions.
The Theta Delts appeared to
have the game wrapped up mid
way in the second half with a
19-6 lead, but the Zetes came
roaring back on a fifty-yard
bomb from John Frankovich to
Mar Agnew.
Frankovich's extra-point pass
also connected, and suddenly the
Theta Delts found themselves

with a shaky 19-13 lead with sev
eral minutes still to play.
The Long- Bomb
Moseley answered the chal
lenge. After a couple of short
completions to Scales and John
ston, he unloaded a monstrous
pass, leading Steve Ammons by
a good ten to fifteen yards.
His legs churning like pistons,
Ammons drew away from Zetn
safety Dennis Lockhart and

made an unbelievable fingertip
catch before somersaulting to
the ground beyond the goalline.
The extra-point play failed;
but with a twelve-point lead and
a minute and a half left, the
Theta Delt defense had little
trouble stopping a desperation
drive by the Zetes.
On the final play of the game,
Frankovich rifled a long bomb
in the general direction of the
endzone.
Moseley, who played defensive
safety as well as quarterback,
intercepted on the goalline and
ran out the clock.
The first half had been an
even struggle, as each team
scored once and missed the extra
point.
The first time the Theta Delts
got their hands on the ball, it
took only three plays for them
to score. After a roughing tho
passer penalty, Moseley zeroed
in on Scales three consecutive
times.
The third time Scales had

worked himself free in the end
zone, and the Theta Delts enjoy
ed an early 6-0 lead.
Zetes Bounce Back
Frankovich, a recent transfer
from the Naval Academy who
showed a tremendous amount of
poise all season, brought the
Zetes right back to tie the score.
Behind good protection, Frank
ovich bulleted passes to Agnew
and Ted Boutacoff before hitting
Agnew for the touchdown from
thirty yards.
Brad Alden later caught a
Frankovich toss just before

stepping out of the endzone, but
the Theta Delts took over on the
next play by foiling a Zete re
verse.
The Zete defense held tough,
however, and forced a punt with
just seconds remaining in the
half.
Another long pass from Frank
ovich resulted in a fantastic
catch by Gil Stansbury just short
of the goalline as time ran out.
Second Half Explosion
The Theta Delts wasted no
time moving in front at the
start of the second half.

Moseley threw eight consecu
tive passes, connecting with Phil
Ensz, Johnston, and Scales on
the drive.
Johnston angled over center
and took in a ten-yard pitch from
Moseley for the score.

the score 13-6.
