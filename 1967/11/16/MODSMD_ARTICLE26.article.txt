Close to two hundred Stanford
sports fans crowded around IM
field five yesterday to see the
Theta Delts whip the Zetes 25-13
in the intramural touch football
championship.
They witnessed one of the
most brutal and exciting murals
contests ever played on the
Stanford campus.
Sceptics who think touch foot
ball doesn't require a special
brand of courage should have
been there. Both the Zetes and
Theta Delts drew blood.
One Zete had a round gash
on the top of his head, but he

stoically ignored the pain as the
blood caked onto his neck. The
urge to tackle and throw vicious
body blocks was barely held in
check by both clubs.
The four referees supplied by
the intramural office kept the
body contact under control, and
the only injuries seemed to be
bruised shoulders and thighs.
Theta Delt fans nearly suc
ceeded in doing what the Zetes
could not: destroying the team.
At the end of the game, John
Moseley intercepted a pass and
ran out the clock.
The fans swarmed onto the

field and crushed the squad with
congratulatory slaps on the
back.
