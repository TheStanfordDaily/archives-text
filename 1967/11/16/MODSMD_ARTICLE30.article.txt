# Harrier Test: How Fast Can Lumbering Bears Run?
## 
### BOB RUND 
Stanford's cross country team,
now 2-2 in dual meets, will try
to finish its season with a win
ning record by defending its Big
Meet title against Cal this Thurs
day. The Indians defeated Cal
26-29 in last year's meet.
The race, which will be the
last cross-country meet for Sen
iors Jim Letterer and Mike Ja
cobs, will begin at the second
tee of the Stanford golf course
at 3:50 p.m.
Tribe Harriers will also be
trying to better their season to
tal team record of 1:46:00 which
is the best time turned in by a
Stanford squad in three years.
Cal Improved
Cal, led by sophomore Bob

Waldon, has improved since its
loss to the Indians at Sacra
mento.
A comparison of Cal's efforts
against mutual opponents shows
the two teams to be nearly even.
The Bears lost to San Jose
State 22-33. Stanford was downed
by the Spartans 22-37.
Against USC Cal lost 17-41.
The Indians fared better losing
20-38. Both squads defeated
UCLA.
Greg Brock and Brook Thomas,
who have raced consistently well
all season, along with Waldon
figure to be the pre-meet favor
ites. However, Captain Jim Let
terer and Allen Sanford are cap
able of winning if they have a
good race.

Rounding out the Varsity
squad will be rapidly improving
Chuck Menz, Dave Redwine, and
Steve Jones.
Froah Attempt Record
The Frosh led by Don Kar
dong and Duncan Mac Donald
will try to break the all-time
freshman course record. Three
weeks ago they missed it by
only five seconds.
A victory over the Cal frosh
would give the Frosh a perfect
record against freshman compe
tition. They have taken the first
five places in all dual meets.
Rounding out the freshman
team will be Brian Cox, Jay
Rice, Mark Jones, Pete Fair
child, and A 1 Smith.
