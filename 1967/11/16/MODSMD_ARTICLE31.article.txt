## In Schuller Opera Surrealistic Kafka 
### 
The Visitation by Gunther Schuller, Wednesday, November 8.
Gunther Schuller writes as an introduction to The Visitation,
"This work is dedicated to all men who, through hate, injustice, and
oppression, are denied freedom in their pursuit of happiness."
There was no mistaking the mood of the opera; the performers are
not going to be gayly tripping through nineteenth century Euro
pean high society in quest of amourous adventure.
The curtain rises to atonal dissidence and the audience is pre
sented with a set that resembles a structure that someone might
have thrown together with a Gilbert Erector set many years ago.
Steel pipes, ladders, and scaffolds seem senselessly entangled before
an ominous, forboding, dark backdrop.
As the story of Carter Jones unfolds, it becomes evident that
Schuller is using the plot of another twentieth century artist: Franz
Kafka's surrealistic The Trial. The drama has a different setting,
however, presumably that of the southern United States in the
twentieth century during the persecution of a Negro man, Carter
Jones, by the local white. Schuller's version of the story preserves
the same meticulous, seemingly incessant, but slow, plodding of
events that eventually culminate with the death of the protagonist,
the effects of which are punctured by Schuller's juxtoposition of
jazz themes and atonal chords. The opera is given additional sur
realistic underlining by the performers' jerky, stylized movements
and their way of subtly appearing and disappearing.
We felt as if we were being led through an impossible, dream
like world at times, only to be shocked out of it by the haunting
atonality which heightened the frustrating realization that Carter's
fate was sealed and there was no reprieve.
Schuller's music never achieves rhythmic melodies that one
comes to expect from opera. The music on the whole is dry. The
baritone Simon Estes, who played Carter Jones, is very impressive
both musically and dramatically, however. He acts with verve and
poise in a highly commendable portrayal of a difficult dramatic
role. His voice is rich and sonorous, yet he has no difficulty mak
ing transitions to moods of bewilderment and bitterness. The nu
merous minor roles are performed, generally, very well. Alan Cro
foot as a wheeler-dealer night club manager is particularly good,
as is Felicia Weathers as Teena, the advocate's maid.
San Francisco's production of The Visitation is the best yet done.
The opera is of top-notch quality from the set to the singers to the
orchestra, with Schuller himself conducting. It deserved this type
of rendition when it first opened in Hamburg last year and in New
York last summer. The opera, if it is to be at all appreciated or
understood, must be exceptionally and painstakingly prepared. The
Sail Francisco Opera Company deserves hearty congratulations for
their laborious efforts in attempting to give the opera the meticu
lous attention it must have.
For us, the opera is of primarily academic interest. Schuller
is not yet sure of how he is going to master-mind his synthesis of
the various modes of music he is toying with. With each year, how
ever, his style crystallizes and the direction of his stylistic evolu
tion becomes more definite. The opera was neither entertaining,
which opera need not necessarily be, nor rich in philosophical im
port. What Schuller is attempting to do—to create a meaningful
operatic experience for the Twentieth century by employing con
temporary sounds and issues — represents a significant attempt
to rejuvenate the operatic art form. He is already a highly regarded
composer and someone who will be seriously approached in the
near future. The relevance of The Visitation lies in the fact that
therein are glimmerings of the Schuller of the next several decades.
