# 'Visitation' With Nicolai Ghiaurov
## 
### RICHARD N. ATKINS 
I had been warned to expect
the worst: an opera star who
has been "cued in" on his great
ness by such media as unfailing
ly favorable press reviews and
exorbitantly high salaries can,
in a word, be tempermental. But
Nicolai Ghiaurov is one — so it
appears to me — who does not
fall into that pattern.
I was invited backstage to
meet the bass after last Friday's
performance of Faust — San
Francisco's fourth showing of
Gounod's opera as well as my
fourth night in the audience.
Ghiaurov had enjoyed top per
formances on previous evenings;
he had even suffered one that
was slightly less than perfect—
but when the final curtain fell
that Friday there was no doubt
ing his phenomenal ability in
the operatic world. Ghiaurov's
voice, with all its fantastically
rich qualities, filled the San
Francisco Opera House through
out the show, and, after his mag
nificent aria, Vous qui faites
l'endormie, in the third act
(fourth of the original), the San
Francisco audience responded
for the first time this season
appropriately. Nicolai Ghiaurov
brought down the house.

The door marked twenty-four
backstage looked fairly innocu
ous except for the bold letters
on the front: Mr. Ghiaurov. I
was halfway through the door
way when Ghiaurov's costumer
came running through nearly
capturing us both between the
great red plume which had been
Mephistopheles' trademark dur
ing this opera season. Notice
ably the one who did not belong
to his entourage (his costumer
and his wife were the only peo
ple in his dressing room at the
time), I suppose Ghiaurov look
ed as confusingly at me for the
first few seconds as I did at him.
No sooner had I introduced my
self as a member of the Stanford
University Press than Ghiaurov,
beaming, said in that impeccable
accent which distinguishes a
Russian from other Europeans:
"University Press! University!
Come — sit down in BIG chair."
Nicolai Ghiaurov is a massive
individual — much larger than
my six feet and built like a foot
ball player just beginning to
grow portly. Whether or not his
mood was based on a successful
performance, warmer individuals
are far and few between. Ghiau
rov does have a problem with
English and asked if I could

speak to him in another langu
age. A graduate of the great fra
ternity Austria 111, I decided to
shake the dust off my German
and give that a try. "Deutsch,"
said Ghiaurov, "Moment." He
called to his wife who speaks
German superbly, and as I rat
tled off several preliminary ques
tions, she translated them into
their common Slavic tongue. She
would then translate his ans
wers back to German. Soon frus
trated with that, Ghiaurov then
tried to get a second language
out of me so we could commu
nicate directly. I hadn't used my
French for years, but weakly ad
mitted some meagre comprehen
sion. As it worked out, I asked
his wife questions in German
which she then translated where
upon Ghiaurov would respond
in French.
Ghiaurov and I touched upon
many points of mutual interest
—from opera to Stanford. Ghiau
rov enjoys his fellow workers
very much. He was quite im
pressed with several snapshots
which had been taken of Alfredo
Kraus, the capable tenor who
sang the role of Faust, and hin
self on an outing and busily
showed them all to me explain
ing each one as he went along.

On the subject of the San
Francisco audience, Ghiaurov
agreed with me: there is too
much clapping. Everything,
worth it or not, merits applause.
And that's one soapbox Pierce
and I have continually stood on
this season. It's reassuring to
receive support from higher up!
His plans for the future? "Off
to New York after the engage
ment here in San Francisco,"
Ghiaurov explained, "for Forze
del Destlno. Then to Philadelphia
for another stand in Faust And
then perhaps to Europe for a
while." "What about visiting us
at Stanford?" I threw in jok
ingly. "Next time," was his quick
reply.
The Austrian Adventure still
very much in me, I asked him
if he enjoyed performing in
Vienna. "Not another city like
it for music," he replied. "There
they know how to appreciate it."
I still recall the first time I saw
Nicolai Ghiaurov at the Vienna
Staatsoper last spring. So, as I
explained to Ghiaurov, a troupe
of Americans, Messrs. Atkins,
Livermore, Toth, and Garry (the
Ghiaurov of the Mendicant set),
queued ten hours for the per
formance. After a magnificent
show, we gave one cheer which

set the Staatsoper on Its ear. In
that type of recollection, true or
not, which is just grand Ghiau
rov bubbled: "You know It was
Mephlsto. I remember."
