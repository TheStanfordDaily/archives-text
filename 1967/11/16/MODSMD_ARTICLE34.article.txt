# Resistance Rides Today
## 
### 
Rides will leave from behind
the Stanford Bookstore this
morning at 10:30 for a Resis
tance demonstration on the
steps of San Francisco's Federal
Building at noon.
Resistance groups in the Bay
Area and signers of the state
ment of complicity are demon
strating in support of those per
sons recently arrested for will
ful non-possession or destruction
of their draft cards.
The demonstration will also
support some 200 men of the
Boston Resistance who are re
turning their draft cards to the
government today.
One or two speakers from the
Resistance and the complicity
group will address the rally.
Stanford Resistance spokes
man Mark Silverman hopes to
day's demonstration will estab
lish a precedent for the way stu
dents will react to such direct
threats as Gen. Lewis Hershey's
statement to draft boards rec
ommending induction of persons
who physically obstruct govern
ment and military recruiters.
