# Summer Management Interns Challenged By Diverse Jobs
## 
### RENTON ROLPH 
An informational discussion
on the Stanford Management
Intern Program (SMIP) will
take place tomorrow at 4:30

p.m. in the Tresidder Small
Lounge.
Tom Shanahan, SMIP direc
tor. encourages any undergrad
uate interested in making a
"critical evaluation of business"
to attend. Applications for the
program will be available at the
meeting.
SMIP was organized to pro
vide a close-up view of business
administration, but not neces
sarily to prepare them for busi
ness careers. For 10 to 12 weeks
during the summer, interns
serve with various firms and
are able to investigate the chal
lenges — and shortcomings
afforded by careers in business
before reaching their own
career decisions.
Management interns earn
around $500 a month hut Shana
han points out that "most stu
dents accepted for the program
are not worried about salary.
We want to explore different
possibilities, while helping earn
our way through college."
Water And Braceros
Past experiences with the
three-year-old program have
been excellent. R. Patrick For
ster, now studying at England's
University of Manchester on a
Marshall scholarship, valued his
internship highly since he had
"the opportunity to observe the
function of business and its roie
in the economy."
In his service for the Kern
County Land Co. he worked on
position papers on the bracero
and water problems and drafted
a new company policy on mili
tary leave.
Forster changed his opinion
of the difficulty of the business
man's job. "One of the things
that impressed me was the num
ber of hours executives spend
on business, the time they spend

on business-reading after regu
lar hours," Forster said, "They
work longer than the nine-to
five most people think they do."
But Forster was not con
vinced that all executives hud
get their time as carefully as
they should. "I think there's a
tendency for executives to
spend too much time on paper
shuflling," he commented.
"Coming into an organization
fresh, you sometimes wonder
why so much time is spent on
programs that really don't seem
important."
Richard T. Williams, presi
dent of Beta Chi fraternity last
year, said his position with R.

R. Donnelly and Sons, a large
Chicago-based printing firm,
"brilliantly fulfilled SMIP's goal
of exposure to a broad range of
managerial functions."
Assigned to the controller's
office as a "special projects
man," he spent 10 weeks writ
ing a 200 page confidential re
port which was digested into 25
pages for the company's execu
tive committee and directors.
Homework
The project "kept me fully oc
cupied to the point of taking
work home nightly," he added.
Former director of the Stan
ford-Ravenswood tutorial pro
gram. Williams found that the
internship "strongly encour
aged" his decision to switch
from a career in government or
law to one in business.
A U.S. Senate intern during
the Kennedy Administration, he
has become "disenchanted" with
federal services. "Business can
offer the challenge and diversity
that young men are seeking,"
he declared.
One Stanford student interned
with a large liquor company in
the East and learned just "how
dirty the liquor business can
be" in the process of writing a
report on the company's high
rate of personnel turnover.
Companies in both finance and
industry are becoming more and
more concerned about their
image with young people. These
apprehensions are leading vari
ous firms to value their student
intern very much as critic-at
large. Last summer Hewlett-
Packard employed Kirk Hanson,
though not actually an SMIP in
tern, as nothing but a fault
finder.
Given a free hand Kirk stud
ied the operation and people be
hind Hewlett-Packard, and then
submitted a paper presenting
his ideas on how to improve the
image and social contribution of
the company. Many other com
panies hope to learn as much
from the intern as the intern
does from the company.
Shanahan's own experience
with the Bank of America
turned his primary interest from
daily banking to finance admin

istration and gave him a clear
orientation in a business hierar
chy.
His duties at a branch office
in Pasadena included discussing
time-plan loans with customers
and drawing up a report on the
efficiency of the flow of checks
through the bank. Informing
persons of the bank's refusal to
grant loans, Shanahan re
marked, was particularly lively.
The program is designed to
fit each company and intern. Us
ually the intern is supervised by
a member of the personnel de
partment. After a week of basic
orientation in company struc
ture and tradition, the interns
are assigned to a series of de
partments and, in some cases,
to only one where they conduct
a summer long project or study.
In their movement through
the company the interns observe
and at times participate in tough
managerial decisions, see sales
campaigns plotted, witness crea
tion and development of new
products and watch their indus
trial hosts juggling particularly
hard-to-handle public relations
footballs.
No Obligations
SMIP focuses not on what the
intern can produce, but on what
he can learn of industry's some
times obscure ways. Neither
company nor student is obli
gated to establish a lasting rela
tionship.
Shanahan hopes to see the pro
gram expand to include more
seminars conducted by a Busi
ness School professor before and
after the internship. One semi

nar last year centered on the
ways Hugh Hefner's organiza
tion, Playboy Enterprises, re
flects his personality.
Last summer over 50 compa
nies participated in the program,
including American Airlines,
Bethlehem Steel, Pacific Tele
phone, North American Avia
tion, R.C.A., and the United Cali
fornia Bank. Twenty-four stu
dents, out of a field of 50 appli
cants, served as interns, but
Shanahan feels that "up to 40"
can be accommodated this sum
mer.

on the Stanford Management
Intern Program (SMIP) will
take place tomorrow at 4:30

p.m. in the Tresidder Small
Lounge.
Tom Shanahan, SMIP direc
tor. encourages any undergrad
uate interested in making a
"critical evaluation of business"
to attend. Applications for the
program will be available at the
meeting.
SMIP was organized to pro
vide a close-up view of business
administration, but not neces
sarily to prepare them for busi
ness careers. For 10 to 12 weeks
during the summer, interns
serve with various firms and
are able to investigate the chal
lenges — and shortcomings
afforded by careers in business
before reaching their own
career decisions.
Management interns earn
around $500 a month hut Shana
han points out that "most stu
dents accepted for the program
are not worried about salary.
We want to explore different
possibilities, while helping earn
our way through college."
Water And Braceros
Past experiences with the
three-year-old program have
been excellent. R. Patrick For
ster, now studying at England's
University of Manchester on a
Marshall scholarship, valued his
internship highly since he had
"the opportunity to observe the
function of business and its roie
in the economy."
In his service for the Kern
County Land Co. he worked on
position papers on the bracero
and water problems and drafted
a new company policy on mili
tary leave.
Forster changed his opinion
of the difficulty of the business
man's job. "One of the things
that impressed me was the num
ber of hours executives spend
on business, the time they spend

on business-reading after regu
lar hours," Forster said, "They
work longer than the nine-to
five most people think they do."
But Forster was not con
vinced that all executives hud
get their time as carefully as
they should. "I think there's a
tendency for executives to
spend too much time on paper
shuflling," he commented.
"Coming into an organization
fresh, you sometimes wonder
why so much time is spent on
programs that really don't seem
important."
Richard T. Williams, presi
dent of Beta Chi fraternity last
year, said his position with R.

R. Donnelly and Sons, a large
Chicago-based printing firm,
"brilliantly fulfilled SMIP's goal
of exposure to a broad range of
managerial functions."
Assigned to the controller's
office as a "special projects
man," he spent 10 weeks writ
ing a 200 page confidential re
port which was digested into 25
pages for the company's execu
tive committee and directors.
Homework
The project "kept me fully oc
cupied to the point of taking
work home nightly," he added.
Former director of the Stan
ford-Ravenswood tutorial pro
gram. Williams found that the
internship "strongly encour
aged" his decision to switch
from a career in government or
law to one in business.
A U.S. Senate intern during
the Kennedy Administration, he
has become "disenchanted" with
federal services. "Business can
offer the challenge and diversity
that young men are seeking,"
he declared.
One Stanford student interned
with a large liquor company in
the East and learned just "how
dirty the liquor business can
be" in the process of writing a
report on the company's high
rate of personnel turnover.
Companies in both finance and
industry are becoming more and
more concerned about their
image with young people. These
apprehensions are leading vari
ous firms to value their student
intern very much as critic-at
large. Last summer Hewlett-
Packard employed Kirk Hanson,
though not actually an SMIP in
tern, as nothing but a fault
finder.
Given a free hand Kirk stud
ied the operation and people be
hind Hewlett-Packard, and then
submitted a paper presenting
his ideas on how to improve the
image and social contribution of
the company. Many other com
panies hope to learn as much
from the intern as the intern
does from the company.
Shanahan's own experience
with the Bank of America
turned his primary interest from
daily banking to finance admin

istration and gave him a clear
orientation in a business hierar
chy.
His duties at a branch office
in Pasadena included discussing
time-plan loans with customers
and drawing up a report on the
efficiency of the flow of checks
through the bank. Informing
persons of the bank's refusal to
grant loans, Shanahan re
marked, was particularly lively.
The program is designed to
fit each company and intern. Us
ually the intern is supervised by
a member of the personnel de
partment. After a week of basic
orientation in company struc
ture and tradition, the interns
are assigned to a series of de
partments and, in some cases,
to only one where they conduct
a summer long project or study.
In their movement through
the company the interns observe
and at times participate in tough
managerial decisions, see sales
campaigns plotted, witness crea
tion and development of new
products and watch their indus
trial hosts juggling particularly
hard-to-handle public relations
footballs.
No Obligations
SMIP focuses not on what the
intern can produce, but on what
he can learn of industry's some
times obscure ways. Neither
company nor student is obli
gated to establish a lasting rela
tionship.
Shanahan hopes to see the pro
gram expand to include more
seminars conducted by a Busi
ness School professor before and
after the internship. One semi

nar last year centered on the
ways Hugh Hefner's organiza
tion, Playboy Enterprises, re
flects his personality.
Last summer over 50 compa
nies participated in the program,
including American Airlines,
Bethlehem Steel, Pacific Tele
phone, North American Avia
tion, R.C.A., and the United Cali
fornia Bank. Twenty-four stu
dents, out of a field of 50 appli
cants, served as interns, but
Shanahan feels that "up to 40"
can be accommodated this sum
mer.

Companies in both finance and
industry are becoming more and
more concerned about their
image with young people. These
apprehensions are leading vari
ous firms to value their student
intern very much as critic-at
large. Last summer Hewlett-
Packard employed Kirk Hanson,
though not actually an SMIP in
tern, as nothing but a fault
finder.
Given a free hand Kirk stud
ied the operation and people be
hind Hewlett-Packard, and then
submitted a paper presenting
his ideas on how to improve the
image and social contribution of
the company. Many other com
panies hope to learn as much
from the intern as the intern
does from the company.
Shanahan's own experience
with the Bank of America
turned his primary interest from
daily banking to finance admin

istration and gave him a clear
orientation in a business hierar
chy.
His duties at a branch office
in Pasadena included discussing
time-plan loans with customers
and drawing up a report on the
efficiency of the flow of checks
through the bank. Informing
persons of the bank's refusal to
grant loans, Shanahan re
marked, was particularly lively.
The program is designed to
fit each company and intern. Us
ually the intern is supervised by
a member of the personnel de
partment. After a week of basic
orientation in company struc
ture and tradition, the interns
are assigned to a series of de
partments and, in some cases,
to only one where they conduct
a summer long project or study.
In their movement through
the company the interns observe
and at times participate in tough
managerial decisions, see sales
campaigns plotted, witness crea
tion and development of new
products and watch their indus
trial hosts juggling particularly
hard-to-handle public relations
footballs.
No Obligations
SMIP focuses not on what the
intern can produce, but on what
he can learn of industry's some
times obscure ways. Neither
company nor student is obli
gated to establish a lasting rela
tionship.
Shanahan hopes to see the pro
gram expand to include more
seminars conducted by a Busi
ness School professor before and
after the internship. One semi

nar last year centered on the
ways Hugh Hefner's organiza
tion, Playboy Enterprises, re
flects his personality.
Last summer over 50 compa
nies participated in the program,
including American Airlines,
Bethlehem Steel, Pacific Tele
phone, North American Avia
tion, R.C.A., and the United Cali
fornia Bank. Twenty-four stu
dents, out of a field of 50 appli
cants, served as interns, but
Shanahan feels that "up to 40"
can be accommodated this sum
mer.

An informational discussion
on the Stanford Management
Intern Program (SMIP) will
take place tomorrow at 4:30

p.m. in the Tresidder Small
Lounge.
Tom Shanahan, SMIP direc
tor. encourages any undergrad
uate interested in making a
"critical evaluation of business"
to attend. Applications for the
program will be available at the
meeting.
SMIP was organized to pro
vide a close-up view of business
administration, but not neces
sarily to prepare them for busi
ness careers. For 10 to 12 weeks
during the summer, interns
serve with various firms and
are able to investigate the chal
lenges — and shortcomings
afforded by careers in business
before reaching their own
career decisions.
Management interns earn
around $500 a month hut Shana
han points out that "most stu
dents accepted for the program
are not worried about salary.
We want to explore different
possibilities, while helping earn
our way through college."
Water And Braceros
Past experiences with the
three-year-old program have
been excellent. R. Patrick For
ster, now studying at England's
University of Manchester on a
Marshall scholarship, valued his
internship highly since he had
"the opportunity to observe the
function of business and its roie
in the economy."
In his service for the Kern
County Land Co. he worked on
position papers on the bracero
and water problems and drafted
a new company policy on mili
tary leave.
Forster changed his opinion
of the difficulty of the business
man's job. "One of the things
that impressed me was the num
ber of hours executives spend
on business, the time they spend

on business-reading after regu
lar hours," Forster said, "They
work longer than the nine-to
five most people think they do."
But Forster was not con
vinced that all executives hud
get their time as carefully as
they should. "I think there's a
tendency for executives to
spend too much time on paper
shuflling," he commented.
"Coming into an organization
fresh, you sometimes wonder
why so much time is spent on
programs that really don't seem
important."
Richard T. Williams, presi
dent of Beta Chi fraternity last
year, said his position with R.

R. Donnelly and Sons, a large
Chicago-based printing firm,
"brilliantly fulfilled SMIP's goal
of exposure to a broad range of
managerial functions."
Assigned to the controller's
office as a "special projects
man," he spent 10 weeks writ
ing a 200 page confidential re
port which was digested into 25
pages for the company's execu
tive committee and directors.
Homework
The project "kept me fully oc
cupied to the point of taking
work home nightly," he added.

take place tomorrow at 4:30

p.m. in the Tresidder Small
Lounge.
Tom Shanahan, SMIP direc
tor. encourages any undergrad
uate interested in making a
"critical evaluation of business"
to attend. Applications for the
program will be available at the
meeting.
SMIP was organized to pro
vide a close-up view of business
administration, but not neces
sarily to prepare them for busi
ness careers. For 10 to 12 weeks
during the summer, interns
serve with various firms and
are able to investigate the chal
lenges — and shortcomings
afforded by careers in business
before reaching their own
career decisions.
Management interns earn
around $500 a month hut Shana
han points out that "most stu
dents accepted for the program
are not worried about salary.
We want to explore different
possibilities, while helping earn
our way through college."
Water And Braceros
Past experiences with the
three-year-old program have
been excellent. R. Patrick For
ster, now studying at England's
University of Manchester on a
Marshall scholarship, valued his
internship highly since he had
"the opportunity to observe the
function of business and its roie
in the economy."
In his service for the Kern
County Land Co. he worked on
position papers on the bracero
and water problems and drafted
a new company policy on mili
tary leave.
Forster changed his opinion
of the difficulty of the business
man's job. "One of the things
that impressed me was the num
ber of hours executives spend
on business, the time they spend

on business-reading after regu
lar hours," Forster said, "They
work longer than the nine-to
five most people think they do."
But Forster was not con
vinced that all executives hud
get their time as carefully as
they should. "I think there's a
tendency for executives to
spend too much time on paper
shuflling," he commented.
"Coming into an organization
fresh, you sometimes wonder
why so much time is spent on
programs that really don't seem
important."
Richard T. Williams, presi
dent of Beta Chi fraternity last
year, said his position with R.

R. Donnelly and Sons, a large
Chicago-based printing firm,
"brilliantly fulfilled SMIP's goal
of exposure to a broad range of
managerial functions."
Assigned to the controller's
office as a "special projects
man," he spent 10 weeks writ
ing a 200 page confidential re
port which was digested into 25
pages for the company's execu
tive committee and directors.
Homework
The project "kept me fully oc
cupied to the point of taking
work home nightly," he added.
Former director of the Stan
ford-Ravenswood tutorial pro
gram. Williams found that the
internship "strongly encour
aged" his decision to switch
from a career in government or
law to one in business.
A U.S. Senate intern during
the Kennedy Administration, he
has become "disenchanted" with
federal services. "Business can
offer the challenge and diversity
that young men are seeking,"
he declared.
One Stanford student interned
with a large liquor company in
the East and learned just "how
dirty the liquor business can
be" in the process of writing a
report on the company's high
rate of personnel turnover.
Companies in both finance and
industry are becoming more and
more concerned about their
image with young people. These
apprehensions are leading vari
ous firms to value their student
intern very much as critic-at
large. Last summer Hewlett-
Packard employed Kirk Hanson,
though not actually an SMIP in
tern, as nothing but a fault
finder.
Given a free hand Kirk stud
ied the operation and people be
hind Hewlett-Packard, and then
submitted a paper presenting
his ideas on how to improve the
image and social contribution of
the company. Many other com
panies hope to learn as much
from the intern as the intern
does from the company.
Shanahan's own experience
with the Bank of America
turned his primary interest from
daily banking to finance admin

istration and gave him a clear
orientation in a business hierar
chy.
His duties at a branch office
in Pasadena included discussing
time-plan loans with customers
and drawing up a report on the
efficiency of the flow of checks
through the bank. Informing
persons of the bank's refusal to
grant loans, Shanahan re
marked, was particularly lively.
The program is designed to
fit each company and intern. Us
ually the intern is supervised by
a member of the personnel de
partment. After a week of basic
orientation in company struc
ture and tradition, the interns
are assigned to a series of de
partments and, in some cases,
to only one where they conduct
a summer long project or study.
In their movement through
the company the interns observe
and at times participate in tough
managerial decisions, see sales
campaigns plotted, witness crea
tion and development of new
products and watch their indus
trial hosts juggling particularly
hard-to-handle public relations
footballs.
No Obligations
SMIP focuses not on what the
intern can produce, but on what
he can learn of industry's some
times obscure ways. Neither
company nor student is obli
gated to establish a lasting rela
tionship.
Shanahan hopes to see the pro
gram expand to include more
seminars conducted by a Busi
ness School professor before and
after the internship. One semi

nar last year centered on the
ways Hugh Hefner's organiza
tion, Playboy Enterprises, re
flects his personality.
Last summer over 50 compa
nies participated in the program,
including American Airlines,
Bethlehem Steel, Pacific Tele
phone, North American Avia
tion, R.C.A., and the United Cali
fornia Bank. Twenty-four stu
dents, out of a field of 50 appli
cants, served as interns, but
Shanahan feels that "up to 40"
can be accommodated this sum
mer.
