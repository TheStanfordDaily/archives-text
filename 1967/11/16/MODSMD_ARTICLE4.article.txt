# Summer Management Interns Challenged By Diverse Jobs
## 
### RENTON ROLPH 
An informational discussion
on the Stanford Management
Intern Program (SMIP) will
take place tomorrow at 4:30

p.m. in the Tresidder Small
Lounge.
Tom Shanahan, SMIP direc
tor. encourages any undergrad
uate interested in making a
"critical evaluation of business"
to attend. Applications for the
program will be available at the
meeting.
SMIP was organized to pro
vide a close-up view of business
administration, but not neces
sarily to prepare them for busi
ness careers. For 10 to 12 weeks
during the summer, interns
serve with various firms and
are able to investigate the chal
lenges — and shortcomings
afforded by careers in business
before reaching their own
career decisions.
Management interns earn
around $500 a month hut Shana
han points out that "most stu
dents accepted for the program
are not worried about salary.
We want to explore different
possibilities, while helping earn
our way through college."
Water And Braceros
Past experiences with the
three-year-old program have
been excellent. R. Patrick For
ster, now studying at England's
University of Manchester on a
Marshall scholarship, valued his
internship highly since he had
"the opportunity to observe the
function of business and its roie
in the economy."
In his service for the Kern
County Land Co. he worked on
position papers on the bracero
and water problems and drafted
a new company policy on mili
tary leave.
Forster changed his opinion
of the difficulty of the business
man's job. "One of the things
that impressed me was the num
ber of hours executives spend
on business, the time they spend

on business-reading after regu
lar hours," Forster said, "They
work longer than the nine-to
five most people think they do."
But Forster was not con
vinced that all executives hud
get their time as carefully as
they should. "I think there's a
tendency for executives to
spend too much time on paper
shuflling," he commented.
"Coming into an organization
fresh, you sometimes wonder
why so much time is spent on
programs that really don't seem
important."
Richard T. Williams, presi
dent of Beta Chi fraternity last
year, said his position with R.

R. Donnelly and Sons, a large
Chicago-based printing firm,
"brilliantly fulfilled SMIP's goal
of exposure to a broad range of
managerial functions."
Assigned to the controller's
office as a "special projects
man," he spent 10 weeks writ
ing a 200 page confidential re
port which was digested into 25
pages for the company's execu
tive committee and directors.
Homework
The project "kept me fully oc
cupied to the point of taking
work home nightly," he added.
