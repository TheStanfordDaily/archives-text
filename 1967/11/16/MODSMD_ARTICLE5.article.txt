# Election Continues
## 
### 
A very small voter turn-out
characterized the first day of the
head cheerleader election and
LASSU run-off.
"Only 300 people voted. That's
all!" said elections commissioner
Craig Brown. The polls will be
open today at Engineering Cor
ner and possibly at the post of
fice, between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
added Brown.
All students may vote for one
of the eight head yell leader
candidates in a second primary
election. The first primary was
invalidated by the Judicial Coun
cil on Monday because it felt
candidates had not been in
formed of election rules until
well after campaigning had be
gun. Several violations of the
rules had been charged.
Graduate students in the
school of humanities and sci
ences may vote for three of four
Legislature candidates in a run
off election. Students not living
in a University residence and not
affiliated with a fraternity or
eating club may vote for one of
two candidates to fill the final
LASSU representative post.
Forty-one Legislature repre
sentatives were elected last
Wednesday and Thursday and
took office last night. If a run
off election is needed for head
cheerleader it will take place
- Tuesday and Wednesday.
