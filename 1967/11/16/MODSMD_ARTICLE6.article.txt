# SES Review Set
## 
### 
A "Student Review Board"
to examine and comment on
proposals of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
is being established by ASSU
President Peter Lyman.
The creation of such a
board was agreed to by SES
Chairman Herbert Packer
several weeks ago in a meet
ing with Lyman.
Lyman yesterday outlined
the role of the hoard in rela
tion to the Study. Me said,
"Until tills point students as a
group have had no right or
opportunity to say what they
think of the activities of SES.
While the formal function of
the board is to review the ac
tivities and statements of the
steering committee, I hope it
can expand to not only criti
cize and approve but also to
offer alternative proposals."
Lyman hopes that a wide
range of student opinion ap

plies for the board. He said,
"One of th<* mistakes of SES
has been its consensus aj>-
proach to reform. I consider
this a characteristic of bu
reaucratic rather than crea
tive thinking. If a wide range
of student opinion constitutes
the Review Board, hopefully
it could show SES what crea
tive thinking looks like."
A conflict of different ap
proaches. Lyman hopes, will
allow the board to come up
with more than one approach
or another and even a series
of critiques on SES proposals.
Applications can be made in
the ASSI I offices through next
Tuesday. Application will in
clude the opportunity to dis
cuss the functions and po*
sible organization of the
board. Lyman also wants to
find out the specific aspects
of SES that prospective l>oard
members are interested in.
