# Poor Countries To Become Superfluous, Says Boulding
## 
### ROBERT BRODY 
The economically successful
nations of the world will eventu
ally become independent of the
unsuccessful ones, Kenneth
Boulding, noted economist,
warned an audience of about
400 at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
last night.
Particpating in Century 21's
lecture series, Boulding spoke
on the widening gap between
two distinct groups of nations

in the future, one uniformly
prosperous, the other, the mis
cellaneous poor.
"In a stationary society in
equalities of income are derived
almost entirely from differences
in status. In feudal societies
you were poor because you
were a slave or a serf.
"In a developing world, as we
have today, inequalities are
mainly a result of different
rates of growth."
Graph Of Growth
He illustrated his belief in a
future dichotomy of wealth
with a table based on economic
statistics of the 1950'5. On a
graph of Gross National Pro
duct (GNP) versus growth in
GNP, he showed two clusters.
"There are the successful
countries, which are either al
ready rich and developing slow
ly, such as the United States,
or fairly poor but developing
fast, such as Japan.
"On the other hand we have
the unsuccessful countries, all
of which are poor, most of
which are developing slowly. In
this decade statistics indicate
that the richest countries are
growing a little faster and the
poor a little slower."

When a nation is rich, he con
tinued, it has the power to pro
duce disagreeable as well as
agreeable things, ie, nuclear
weapons. Poor nations can't pro
duce either.
Rich Won't Need Poor
Given the widening economic
gap between the two groups of
nations, he predicted, "Rich na
tions won't need poor countries

anymore. If you can't exploit
them as they once were, or they
can't be a nuisance to you (lack
ing nuclear weapons), you ig
nore them."
Boulding noted two interest
ing sidelights of his study. First,
socialism is "completely irrele
vant to economic progress.
With the exception of Albania
and China, they (the socialist
nations) are growing on the
same line as the non-socialist
successful ones. Thus it is be
cause they are poor, not social
ist, that they are developing."
The second point he made is
that virtually all the "success
ful" countries are either in the
temperate zone or the Caribbean
while most of the "unsuccessful"
countries are in the tropics.
"Thus the major division of
the world," he concluded, "is not
East-West but temperate-trop
ics."
Boulding expressed a belief in
world peace without internation
al controls by establishing the
habit of peace, as it. is in North
America. lie described human
society as moving from a state
of stable war to unstable war to
unstable peace to stable peace.

anymore. If you can't exploit
them as they once were, or they
can't be a nuisance to you (lack
ing nuclear weapons), you ig
nore them."
Boulding noted two interest
ing sidelights of his study. First,
socialism is "completely irrele
vant to economic progress.
With the exception of Albania
and China, they (the socialist
nations) are growing on the
same line as the non-socialist
successful ones. Thus it is be
cause they are poor, not social
ist, that they are developing."
The second point he made is
that virtually all the "success
ful" countries are either in the
temperate zone or the Caribbean
while most of the "unsuccessful"
countries are in the tropics.
"Thus the major division of
the world," he concluded, "is not
East-West but temperate-trop
ics."
Boulding expressed a belief in
world peace without internation
al controls by establishing the
habit of peace, as it. is in North
America. lie described human
society as moving from a state
of stable war to unstable war to
unstable peace to stable peace.

The economically successful
nations of the world will eventu
ally become independent of the
unsuccessful ones, Kenneth
Boulding, noted economist,
warned an audience of about
400 at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
last night.
Particpating in Century 21's
lecture series, Boulding spoke
on the widening gap between
two distinct groups of nations

in the future, one uniformly
prosperous, the other, the mis
cellaneous poor.
"In a stationary society in
equalities of income are derived
almost entirely from differences
in status. In feudal societies
you were poor because you
were a slave or a serf.
"In a developing world, as we
have today, inequalities are
mainly a result of different
rates of growth."
Graph Of Growth
He illustrated his belief in a
future dichotomy of wealth
with a table based on economic
statistics of the 1950'5. On a
graph of Gross National Pro
duct (GNP) versus growth in
GNP, he showed two clusters.
"There are the successful
countries, which are either al
ready rich and developing slow
ly, such as the United States,
or fairly poor but developing
fast, such as Japan.
"On the other hand we have
the unsuccessful countries, all
of which are poor, most of
which are developing slowly. In
this decade statistics indicate
that the richest countries are
growing a little faster and the
poor a little slower."

When a nation is rich, he con
tinued, it has the power to pro
duce disagreeable as well as
agreeable things, ie, nuclear
weapons. Poor nations can't pro
duce either.
Rich Won't Need Poor
Given the widening economic
gap between the two groups of
nations, he predicted, "Rich na
tions won't need poor countries

anymore. If you can't exploit
them as they once were, or they
can't be a nuisance to you (lack
ing nuclear weapons), you ig
nore them."
Boulding noted two interest
