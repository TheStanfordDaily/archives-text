# Convocation Of Left Discusses Organizations' Effectiveness
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Campus left-wing loaders met
in Cubberlcy Auditorium last
night to discuss ways of making
their organizations more effec
tive. About 130 attended.
The group voted to set up a
coordinating organization so
that the u hole Stanford comrnu

nity could bo informed nf and
involved in anti-war and other
protest activities. There will bo
another meeting' next Monday
night.
Senior anthropology major
Jackie Griffith sot the tone of
the evening by declaiming the
"alienation" that she felt the
left wing groups were responsi
ble for.
Too much attention is being
focused on institutions and not
enough on personal relations
here on campus, she noted,
stating, "We must give them a
sense of what it means to be
long to a body politic."
She proposed "work-study
groups" to examine problems
such as "the Stanford admini
stration power structure" in an
effort to interest stuoents in
local affairs.
Transcend Moral Issues
Mary Hanson. a senior major
irg in social thought, urged war
protestors to "transcend the
moral issues" in an effort to
"analytically oppose the war."
She felt that "someone who can
not be dismissed nÂ«s emotional"
w ill br much more effective,

Speaking from the floor, Wil
bur sponsor Dell Martin criti
cized the pervious speakers as
being "too theoretical. "Most of
the guys in my dorm are so re
actionary they think that labor
unions are the greatest menace
to America,"he said.
Instead of a "dozen of you
sitting around your commune
in East Palo Alto, why don't
you have dinner in Wilbur?"
This effort he said was a "per
sonal, valid approach."
A Negro floor speaker sug
gested that all of us consider
tactics. This is something you
can't overlook."
Romantic Idea
He said that for a white col
lege student "it is a romantic
idea to be confronted by a cop
with a stick or gun. For a
Negro this situation has been
going on for many years." He
concluded by saying "there are
people in this room dedicated
to the destruction of America."
John Shippec of the Resistance
made it c lear that in future dem
onstrations "there will be non
violence above all else. The
means must be consistent with
the ends."
