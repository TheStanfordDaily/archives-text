Compiled by the

It took a group of college stu
dents to cut through the pre
tensions and moral judgments
being aired about psychedelic
drugs. This S(K pamphlet
tells just the factsâ€”the social,
medical, and legal aspects of
psychedelic drug use, descrip
tions of a successful and un
successful trip, and clear defi
nitions of drug-related terms.
