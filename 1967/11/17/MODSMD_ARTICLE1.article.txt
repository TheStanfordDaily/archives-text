# Big Game And Bonfire Ready, But Still No Axe
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
Big Game week activities draw
to a close with the traditional
bonfire tonight and California
game tomorrow, the last in Stan
ford's spotty football season.
The bonfire rally starts at 6:30
with the Stanford Band, pom
pon girls, and former sports
stars. Big Game, itself, at Stan
ford this year, starts at 1:30
p.m. Saturday.
Located on the muddy bed of
Lake Lagunita, tonight's bon
fire is in the shape of a giant
"C".
To acquire construction work
ers for the bonfire, the band
marched through Wilbur at 5
a.m. this morning, rousting
bleary-eyed freshmen out of bed.
Work on the fire is expected to
be completed late this afternoon.
Faces Boathouse
The open part of the "C" shap
ed bonfire will face Lake Lag
unita's boathouse, and will con
tain a long arrow belonging to
the Stanford Indian. The shaft

of the arrow will be painted
orange and thf featners and
head bright red.
The bonfire, which has been
guarded constantly since Mon
day by freshmen (aided by
frosh dollies), is supposed to be
surrounded by a human wall of
300 people from the time it is
completed until tonight's rally.
The rally's M.C. will be Bob
Stone, producer of the 1967
Gaieties. Following the rally
will be a street dance on the low
er Row, sponsored by the Inter-
Fraternity Council. The Initial
Shock will supply the initial
shocks (musical).
House Decorations
Those not attending the IFC
dance may be making last-ditch
efforts to improve their house
sponsored decorations. Approxi
mately 25 houses have entered
the competition. Decorations will
be judged tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.
and trophies will be awarded to
the winners in each of five cate

gories at half-time during the
Big Game.
Crown Prince Vong Savang of
Laos will present engraved sil
ver bowls to the captains of both
the Stanford and California foot
ball teams tomorrow, also dur
ing the half-time ceremonies.
Yesterday Mayor Frances Dias
and the city of Palo Alto sent
an official proclamation to Stan
ford commerating the Big Game
and the festivities leading up to
it. The proclamation was slight
ly damaged, however, by three
large bear tracks. Mrs. Dias is
an alumna of the University of
California at Berkeley.
Yesterday Bob Parsons, co-in
ventor of the Stanford water bal
loon cannon, was notified that
Cal's ATO fraternity had accept
ed Stanford's challenge to match
the cannon against its water bal
loon sling shot.
The duel will take place to
morrow in White Plaza follow
ing the Intramural title game,
which should end at about 12:15.
Parsons affirmed that the can

non, which shoots six ounce
water balloons, is "not destruc
tive." The winner will be deter
mined by the length and accu
racy of shots.
Axe Still Gone
The missing Stanford Axe still
has not turned up, and chances
appear slight that it will be re
turned in time for tonight's bon
fire rally.
It was found that the anony
mous picture of the Axe printed
in Wednesday's Daily was a sup
erimposed photograph. This new
development only led to more
speculation as to who presently
possesses the Axe.
Wednesday night an unidenti
fied group of Stanford students,
posing as Cal men interested in
joining Berkeley's radio station,
almost succeeded in playing a
tape over the air proclaiming the
virtues of Stanford.
The Stanford men managed
to lead the Berkeley station engi


HARD TO CATCH — A major worry for the Cal defense tomorrow will be the eluslveness of Stan
ford quarterback Mark Marquess (12), here slipping between Oregon's Jack Rust (69) and Jeff
Macßae (55). Malcolm Snider (75) and Bob Heffernan (79) move up to block for Marquess. Mar

But the engineer returned be

10 seconds of silence were gen
erated. The imposters left in a
hurry, leaving their tape behind.
The Stanford Rifle Team, af
ter a contest with Cal, plastered
Campanile with "Oskie Bites"
and "Kill Cal" posters.
Upcoming parties include the
Big Game Frosh dance, The In
duction in Wilbur Hall Saturday
from 7:15 p.m. until 3:00 a.m.
Five live bands will play, and re
freshments will be served. Ad
mission is $3.00.
Each of the nine Wilbur hous

es will have its own entertain
ment. In addition to the bands,
The Sunshine Yellow and the
Freakout Lighting will provide
light shows. The movies feature
Bogart, Brando and W. C. Fields.
Bill Center, Induction chair
man, estimates that 90 per cent
of Wilbur men have already pur
chased tickets and that atten
dance should be at least 1,000
and possibly as high as 1,800.
"The cooperation in planning has
been fantastic," said Center.
In addition to the planned ac
tivities Soto' House will have a
light show staged by resident
Laurence Pickup. The Gyre will
provide music the entire night In
Soto.


UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS discovered yesterday three large bear
tracks on the City of Palo Alto's official proclamation of Big Game
Week. Frances Dias, Palo Alto's mayor and an alumna of the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley, sent the Big Game proclamation,
which urged "all Palo Alto residents to participate in the many
traditional activities in the spirit of good sportsmanship and fun."
Last year, on request, she sent along a similar proclamation,
which just happened to have blue and gold ribbons (Cal colors)
affixed to the city seal on the bottom. Mrs. Dias compromised with
the ribbon colors this year, putting Stanford's red and white in the
document along with blue and gold.

UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS discovered yesterday three large bear
tracks on the City of Palo Alto's official proclamation of Big Game
Week. Frances Dias, Palo Alto's mayor and an alumna of the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley, sent the Big Game proclamation,
which urged "all Palo Alto residents to participate in the many
traditional activities in the spirit of good sportsmanship and fun."
Last year, on request, she sent along a similar proclamation,
which just happened to have blue and gold ribbons (Cal colors)
affixed to the city seal on the bottom. Mrs. Dias compromised with
the ribbon colors this year, putting Stanford's red and white in the
document along with blue and gold.

ALL THAT FOR NOTHING — A forest of telephone poles in the
middle of Lake Lagunita, guarded around-the-clock for the past
week by Stanford freshmen, will go up in flames at tonight's 6:30
rally.
Big Game week activities draw
to a close with the traditional
bonfire tonight and California
game tomorrow, the last in Stan
ford's spotty football season.
The bonfire rally starts at 6:30
with the Stanford Band, pom
pon girls, and former sports
stars. Big Game, itself, at Stan
ford this year, starts at 1:30
p.m. Saturday.
Located on the muddy bed of
Lake Lagunita, tonight's bon
fire is in the shape of a giant
"C".
To acquire construction work
ers for the bonfire, the band
marched through Wilbur at 5
a.m. this morning, rousting
bleary-eyed freshmen out of bed.
Work on the fire is expected to
be completed late this afternoon.
Faces Boathouse
The open part of the "C" shap
ed bonfire will face Lake Lag
unita's boathouse, and will con
tain a long arrow belonging to
the Stanford Indian. The shaft

of the arrow will be painted
orange and thf featners and
head bright red.
The bonfire, which has been
guarded constantly since Mon
day by freshmen (aided by
frosh dollies), is supposed to be
surrounded by a human wall of
300 people from the time it is
completed until tonight's rally.
The rally's M.C. will be Bob
Stone, producer of the 1967
Gaieties. Following the rally
will be a street dance on the low
er Row, sponsored by the Inter-
Fraternity Council. The Initial
Shock will supply the initial
shocks (musical).
House Decorations
Those not attending the IFC
dance may be making last-ditch
efforts to improve their house
sponsored decorations. Approxi
mately 25 houses have entered
the competition. Decorations will
be judged tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.
and trophies will be awarded to
the winners in each of five cate

gories at half-time during the
Big Game.
Crown Prince Vong Savang of
Laos will present engraved sil
ver bowls to the captains of both
the Stanford and California foot
ball teams tomorrow, also dur
ing the half-time ceremonies.
Yesterday Mayor Frances Dias
and the city of Palo Alto sent
an official proclamation to Stan
ford commerating the Big Game
and the festivities leading up to
it. The proclamation was slight
ly damaged, however, by three
large bear tracks. Mrs. Dias is
an alumna of the University of
California at Berkeley.
Yesterday Bob Parsons, co-in
ventor of the Stanford water bal
loon cannon, was notified that
Cal's ATO fraternity had accept
ed Stanford's challenge to match
the cannon against its water bal
loon sling shot.
The duel will take place to
morrow in White Plaza follow
ing the Intramural title game,
which should end at about 12:15.
Parsons affirmed that the can

non, which shoots six ounce
water balloons, is "not destruc
tive." The winner will be deter
mined by the length and accu
racy of shots.
Axe Still Gone
The missing Stanford Axe still
has not turned up, and chances
appear slight that it will be re
turned in time for tonight's bon
fire rally.
It was found that the anony
mous picture of the Axe printed
in Wednesday's Daily was a sup
erimposed photograph. This new
development only led to more
speculation as to who presently
possesses the Axe.
Wednesday night an unidenti
fied group of Stanford students,
posing as Cal men interested in
joining Berkeley's radio station,
almost succeeded in playing a
tape over the air proclaiming the
virtues of Stanford.

fire is in the shape of a giant
"C".
To acquire construction work
ers for the bonfire, the band
marched through Wilbur at 5
a.m. this morning, rousting
bleary-eyed freshmen out of bed.
Work on the fire is expected to
be completed late this afternoon.
Faces Boathouse
The open part of the "C" shap
ed bonfire will face Lake Lag
unita's boathouse, and will con
tain a long arrow belonging to
the Stanford Indian. The shaft

of the arrow will be painted
orange and thf featners and
head bright red.
The bonfire, which has been
guarded constantly since Mon
day by freshmen (aided by
frosh dollies), is supposed to be
surrounded by a human wall of
300 people from the time it is
completed until tonight's rally.
The rally's M.C. will be Bob
Stone, producer of the 1967
Gaieties. Following the rally
will be a street dance on the low
er Row, sponsored by the Inter-
Fraternity Council. The Initial
Shock will supply the initial
shocks (musical).
House Decorations
Those not attending the IFC
dance may be making last-ditch
efforts to improve their house
sponsored decorations. Approxi
mately 25 houses have entered
the competition. Decorations will
be judged tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.
and trophies will be awarded to
the winners in each of five cate

gories at half-time during the
Big Game.
Crown Prince Vong Savang of
Laos will present engraved sil
ver bowls to the captains of both
the Stanford and California foot
ball teams tomorrow, also dur
ing the half-time ceremonies.
Yesterday Mayor Frances Dias
and the city of Palo Alto sent
an official proclamation to Stan
ford commerating the Big Game
and the festivities leading up to
it. The proclamation was slight
ly damaged, however, by three
large bear tracks. Mrs. Dias is
an alumna of the University of
California at Berkeley.
Yesterday Bob Parsons, co-in
ventor of the Stanford water bal
loon cannon, was notified that
Cal's ATO fraternity had accept
ed Stanford's challenge to match
the cannon against its water bal
loon sling shot.
The duel will take place to
morrow in White Plaza follow
ing the Intramural title game,
which should end at about 12:15.
Parsons affirmed that the can

non, which shoots six ounce
water balloons, is "not destruc
tive." The winner will be deter
mined by the length and accu
racy of shots.
Axe Still Gone
The missing Stanford Axe still
has not turned up, and chances
appear slight that it will be re
turned in time for tonight's bon
fire rally.
It was found that the anony
mous picture of the Axe printed
in Wednesday's Daily was a sup
erimposed photograph. This new
development only led to more
speculation as to who presently
possesses the Axe.
Wednesday night an unidenti
fied group of Stanford students,
posing as Cal men interested in
joining Berkeley's radio station,
almost succeeded in playing a
tape over the air proclaiming the
virtues of Stanford.

HARD TO CATCH — A major worry for the Cal defense tomorrow will be the eluslveness of Stan
ford quarterback Mark Marquess (12), here slipping between Oregon's Jack Rust (69) and Jeff
Macßae (55). Malcolm Snider (75) and Bob Heffernan (79) move up to block for Marquess. Mar
quess will start for the Injured Chuck Williams in the 70th Big Game.
Big Game week activities draw
to a close with the traditional
bonfire tonight and California
game tomorrow, the last in Stan
ford's spotty football season.
The bonfire rally starts at 6:30

UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS discovered yesterday three large bear
tracks on the City of Palo Alto's official proclamation of Big Game
Week. Frances Dias, Palo Alto's mayor and an alumna of the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley, sent the Big Game proclamation,
which urged "all Palo Alto residents to participate in the many
traditional activities in the spirit of good sportsmanship and fun."
Last year, on request, she sent along a similar proclamation,
which just happened to have blue and gold ribbons (Cal colors)
affixed to the city seal on the bottom. Mrs. Dias compromised with
the ribbon colors this year, putting Stanford's red and white in the
document along with blue and gold.

UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS discovered yesterday three large bear
tracks on the City of Palo Alto's official proclamation of Big Game
Week. Frances Dias, Palo Alto's mayor and an alumna of the Univer
sity of California at Berkeley, sent the Big Game proclamation,
which urged "all Palo Alto residents to participate in the many
traditional activities in the spirit of good sportsmanship and fun."
Last year, on request, she sent along a similar proclamation,
which just happened to have blue and gold ribbons (Cal colors)
affixed to the city seal on the bottom. Mrs. Dias compromised with
the ribbon colors this year, putting Stanford's red and white in the
document along with blue and gold.

ALL THAT FOR NOTHING — A forest of telephone poles in the
middle of Lake Lagunita, guarded around-the-clock for the past
week by Stanford freshmen, will go up in flames at tonight's 6:30
rally.
Big Game week activities draw
to a close with the traditional
bonfire tonight and California
game tomorrow, the last in Stan
ford's spotty football season.
The bonfire rally starts at 6:30
with the Stanford Band, pom
pon girls, and former sports
stars. Big Game, itself, at Stan
ford this year, starts at 1:30
p.m. Saturday.
Located on the muddy bed of
Lake Lagunita, tonight's bon
fire is in the shape of a giant
"C".
To acquire construction work
ers for the bonfire, the band
marched through Wilbur at 5
a.m. this morning, rousting
bleary-eyed freshmen out of bed.
Work on the fire is expected to
be completed late this afternoon.
Faces Boathouse
The open part of the "C" shap
ed bonfire will face Lake Lag
unita's boathouse, and will con
tain a long arrow belonging to
the Stanford Indian. The shaft

of the arrow will be painted
orange and thf featners and
head bright red.
The bonfire, which has been
guarded constantly since Mon
day by freshmen (aided by
frosh dollies), is supposed to be
surrounded by a human wall of
300 people from the time it is
completed until tonight's rally.
The rally's M.C. will be Bob
Stone, producer of the 1967
Gaieties. Following the rally
will be a street dance on the low
er Row, sponsored by the Inter-
Fraternity Council. The Initial
Shock will supply the initial
shocks (musical).
House Decorations
Those not attending the IFC
dance may be making last-ditch
efforts to improve their house
sponsored decorations. Approxi
mately 25 houses have entered
the competition. Decorations will
be judged tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.
and trophies will be awarded to
the winners in each of five cate

gories at half-time during the
Big Game.
Crown Prince Vong Savang of
Laos will present engraved sil
ver bowls to the captains of both
the Stanford and California foot
ball teams tomorrow, also dur
ing the half-time ceremonies.
Yesterday Mayor Frances Dias
and the city of Palo Alto sent
an official proclamation to Stan
ford commerating the Big Game
and the festivities leading up to
it. The proclamation was slight
ly damaged, however, by three
large bear tracks. Mrs. Dias is
an alumna of the University of
California at Berkeley.
Yesterday Bob Parsons, co-in
ventor of the Stanford water bal
loon cannon, was notified that
Cal's ATO fraternity had accept
ed Stanford's challenge to match
the cannon against its water bal
loon sling shot.
The duel will take place to
morrow in White Plaza follow
ing the Intramural title game,
which should end at about 12:15.
Parsons affirmed that the can

non, which shoots six ounce
water balloons, is "not destruc
tive." The winner will be deter
mined by the length and accu
racy of shots.
Axe Still Gone
The missing Stanford Axe still
has not turned up, and chances
appear slight that it will be re
turned in time for tonight's bon
fire rally.
It was found that the anony
mous picture of the Axe printed
in Wednesday's Daily was a sup
erimposed photograph. This new
development only led to more
speculation as to who presently
possesses the Axe.
Wednesday night an unidenti
fied group of Stanford students,
posing as Cal men interested in
joining Berkeley's radio station,
almost succeeded in playing a
tape over the air proclaiming the
virtues of Stanford.
The Stanford men managed
to lead the Berkeley station engi


HARD TO CATCH — A major worry for the Cal defense tomorrow will be the eluslveness of Stan
ford quarterback Mark Marquess (12), here slipping between Oregon's Jack Rust (69) and Jeff
Macßae (55). Malcolm Snider (75) and Bob Heffernan (79) move up to block for Marquess. Mar
quess will start for the Injured Chuck Williams in the 70th Big Game.
