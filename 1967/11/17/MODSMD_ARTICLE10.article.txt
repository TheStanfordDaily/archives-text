# What Is Education?
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
(Mr. Campbell is a graduate
theology student at the Unives
ity of Toronto. He worked for
SES last summer.)
Is it possible that the Study
of Education is founded on an
unsubstantiated a s s u mption,
namely that there is education
at Stanford to be studied?
If people are being educated
here, do they do it through the
existing structure or rather by
going counter to it?
, B. Davie Napier, in his talk to
the freshmen in September, dis
cussed the necessity to apply
Bertolt Brecht's "estrangement
effect' 'to (he "frightening, for
midable, one-dimensional, homo
genized, manipulated, garrison
conditioned, all-mothering, all
smothering culture mass" of
our country.
The estrangement effect is
"any device which makes it pos
sible for us to break through
our stereotypes and illusions
about things, and people, and
the world." As Brecht himself
says, in the estrangement effect
"the things of everyday life are
lifted out of the realm of the
self-evident (and) that which
is 'natural' assumes the features
o£ the extraordinary."
The Effect's The Same
;The estrangement effect can
be applied just as well to educa
tion as it can to our "massive,
monochrome, monaural, anti
communist" society. In fact,
some of the ways in which we
can break through the everyday
stereotypes of society are also
keys to breaking through the
stereotypes of education to see
what education really is.
We are caught in the vast
clouds of a culture front, said
Napier, that has "been a-build
ing since the first wars of his-

Tory and the first human act in
which human life was reduced
to human property."
Our problem is a problem of
humanity, "the recovery of the
real image of man from all the
culture-sponsored distortions of
the image of man. The problem
is to be a person . . . (and) we
are being brought to accept as
satisfactory-man what is in fact
not man, what is less than man,
distorted man, fractionalized
perverted man."
Unnatural Becomes Natural
"The massive monochrome
cultural environment is forever
bombarding us, even sublimin
ally, with the proposition that
it's all right, Joe; that you can
remain a human being, while
you live and move and exist in a
dehumanized environment; that
you can somehow retain your
status as a person in a society
that is appallingly depersonal
ized; in short, that the distorted,
reduced, shattered, warring, hat
ing, "corupting, bleeding image
of man is natural."
Doesn't Stanford set forth an
image of man that is equally,
though more subtly, distorted
and inhuman? The existing edu
cational structure tells you that
training your mind is the end of
education. It does not tell you
that seeing your education as a
tool leads to conceiving your
self as a tool.
The existing educational
structure tells you that sharpen
ing your mental tools is an end
in itself and that using them
is enjoyable irespective of other
considerations. It does "not make
you aware of or sensitive to the
human cost of pursuing those
ends, i.e. of the fact that life
comes to be seen as a game,
a competition and being-with a
person disappears into a life

time of being-against; of the
fact that the game is so enrap
turing that psychological fac
tors go unseen, that your effects
on the other person's person are
ignored and thus that you come
to accept as yourself the shat
tered image of man that you
see (and have helped to create)
in others.
Evading; The Question
The existing educational
structure tells you that your en
vironment is part of the educa
tional process. It does not tell
you how the environment fos
ters (or inhibits) such human
qualities as self-awareness,
curiosity, sensitivity, autonomy,
responsibility, creativity, open
ness, trust, wonder.
The existing educational
structure tells you that relation
ships in institutions are neces
sarily functional. It does not
tell you that, in the words of
Napier, "the image of man In
y®u is shattered when you ra
tionalize or buy, support, or ac
cept or passively countenance
the abuse of person, the depri
vation of humanity, the isola
tion of any one human being
anywhere."
In short, the existing educa
tional structure paints a dis
torted, shattered, debased, in
complete image of man and
then holds up this image as the
norm, giving the rationalization
that the University is concerned
only with the development of
the mind.
But is the mind really de
veloped when it is ignorant of
the effects of its actions on
others and on itself? Is educa
tion taking place when develop
ment of the mind is isolated
from full human development?
Is there education at Stan
ford to be studied?

Napier, that has "been a-build

Tory and the first human act in

to human property."
Our problem is a problem of
humanity, "the recovery of the
real image of man from all the
culture-sponsored distortions of
the image of man. The problem
is to be a person . . . (and) we
are being brought to accept as
satisfactory-man what is in fact
not man, what is less than man,
distorted man, fractionalized
perverted man."
Unnatural Becomes Natural
"The massive monochrome
cultural environment is forever
bombarding us, even sublimin
ally, with the proposition that
it's all right, Joe; that you can
remain a human being, while
you live and move and exist in a
dehumanized environment; that
you can somehow retain your
status as a person in a society
that is appallingly depersonal
ized; in short, that the distorted,
reduced, shattered, warring, hat
ing, "corupting, bleeding image
of man is natural."
Doesn't Stanford set forth an
image of man that is equally,
though more subtly, distorted
and inhuman? The existing edu
cational structure tells you that
training your mind is the end of
education. It does not tell you
that seeing your education as a
tool leads to conceiving your
self as a tool.
The existing educational
structure tells you that sharpen
ing your mental tools is an end
in itself and that using them
is enjoyable irespective of other
considerations. It does "not make
you aware of or sensitive to the
human cost of pursuing those
ends, i.e. of the fact that life
comes to be seen as a game,
a competition and being-with a
person disappears into a life

time of being-against; of the
fact that the game is so enrap
turing that psychological fac
tors go unseen, that your effects
on the other person's person are
ignored and thus that you come
to accept as yourself the shat
tered image of man that you
see (and have helped to create)
in others.
Evading; The Question
The existing educational

vironment is part of the educa

you how the environment fos
ters (or inhibits) such human
qualities as self-awareness,
curiosity, sensitivity, autonomy,
responsibility, creativity, open
ness, trust, wonder.
The existing educational
structure tells you that relation
ships in institutions are neces
sarily functional. It does not
tell you that, in the words of
Napier, "the image of man In
y®u is shattered when you ra
tionalize or buy, support, or ac
cept or passively countenance
the abuse of person, the depri
vation of humanity, the isola
tion of any one human being
anywhere."
In short, the existing educa
tional structure paints a dis
torted, shattered, debased, in
complete image of man and
then holds up this image as the
norm, giving the rationalization
that the University is concerned
only with the development of
the mind.
But is the mind really de
veloped when it is ignorant of
the effects of its actions on
others and on itself? Is educa
tion taking place when develop
ment of the mind is isolated
from full human development?
Is there education at Stan
ford to be studied?

Is it possible that the Study

person disappears into a life

time of being-against; of the
fact that the game is so enrap

Evading; The Question
The existing educational
structure tells you that your en
vironment is part of the educa
tional process. It does not tell
you how the environment fos
ters (or inhibits) such human
qualities as self-awareness,
curiosity, sensitivity, autonomy,
responsibility, creativity, open
ness, trust, wonder.
The existing educational
structure tells you that relation
ships in institutions are neces
sarily functional. It does not
tell you that, in the words of
Napier, "the image of man In
y®u is shattered when you ra
tionalize or buy, support, or ac
cept or passively countenance
the abuse of person, the depri
vation of humanity, the isola
tion of any one human being
anywhere."
In short, the existing educa
tional structure paints a dis
torted, shattered, debased, in
complete image of man and
then holds up this image as the
norm, giving the rationalization
that the University is concerned
only with the development of
the mind.
But is the mind really de
veloped when it is ignorant of
the effects of its actions on
others and on itself? Is educa
tion taking place when develop
ment of the mind is isolated
from full human development?
Is there education at Stan
ford to be studied?
(Mr. Campbell is a graduate
theology student at the Unives
ity of Toronto. He worked for
SES last summer.)
Is it possible that the Study
of Education is founded on an
unsubstantiated a s s u mption,
namely that there is education
at Stanford to be studied?
If people are being educated
here, do they do it through the
existing structure or rather by
going counter to it?
, B. Davie Napier, in his talk to
the freshmen in September, dis
cussed the necessity to apply
Bertolt Brecht's "estrangement
effect' 'to (he "frightening, for
midable, one-dimensional, homo
genized, manipulated, garrison
conditioned, all-mothering, all
smothering culture mass" of
our country.
The estrangement effect is
"any device which makes it pos
sible for us to break through
our stereotypes and illusions
about things, and people, and
the world." As Brecht himself
says, in the estrangement effect
"the things of everyday life are
lifted out of the realm of the
self-evident (and) that which
is 'natural' assumes the features
o£ the extraordinary."
The Effect's The Same
;The estrangement effect can
be applied just as well to educa
tion as it can to our "massive,
monochrome, monaural, anti
communist" society. In fact,
some of the ways in which we
can break through the everyday
stereotypes of society are also
keys to breaking through the
stereotypes of education to see
what education really is.
We are caught in the vast
clouds of a culture front, said
Napier, that has "been a-build
ing since the first wars of his-

Tory and the first human act in
which human life was reduced
to human property."
Our problem is a problem of
humanity, "the recovery of the
real image of man from all the
culture-sponsored distortions of
the image of man. The problem
is to be a person . . . (and) we
are being brought to accept as
satisfactory-man what is in fact
not man, what is less than man,
distorted man, fractionalized
perverted man."
Unnatural Becomes Natural
"The massive monochrome
cultural environment is forever
bombarding us, even sublimin
ally, with the proposition that
it's all right, Joe; that you can
remain a human being, while
you live and move and exist in a
dehumanized environment; that
you can somehow retain your
status as a person in a society
that is appallingly depersonal
ized; in short, that the distorted,
reduced, shattered, warring, hat
ing, "corupting, bleeding image
of man is natural."
Doesn't Stanford set forth an
image of man that is equally,
though more subtly, distorted
and inhuman? The existing edu
cational structure tells you that
training your mind is the end of
education. It does not tell you
that seeing your education as a
tool leads to conceiving your
self as a tool.
The existing educational
structure tells you that sharpen
ing your mental tools is an end
in itself and that using them
is enjoyable irespective of other
considerations. It does "not make
you aware of or sensitive to the
human cost of pursuing those

comes to be seen as a game,
a competition and being-with a
