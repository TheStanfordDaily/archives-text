## A 						Bad Year For Poor People 
### Art Buchwald 
Some of my best friends are
poor. The other day I ran into
Slattery, who was nursing a beer
in the corner saloon.
"How's it going, Slattery?" 1
asked him.
; "Pretty bad," Slattery said
sadly. "This hasn't been a good
year for poor people."
"I didn't think any year was
good for poor people."
"Oh, we had a couple of good
years there when everyone was
worried about poor people, and
everyone talked about winning
the war on poverty and helping
people pull themselves up by
their bootstraps. But I knew it
wouldn't last."
"Why not?"
. "You just can't seem to sus
tain interest in poor people over
the long run. I read somewhere
that the attention span to poor
people's problems in Congress
was exactly 84 seconds.
So Much To Think About
"Of course, I don't blame
them. They have a lot more
things to think about, such as
elections and crime in the
sfreets and how much cotton is
coming in from Hong Kong. Be
sides, poor people can't contrib
ute too much to a candidate's
campaign, so why should he
give them too much time?"

"I think your exaggerating,
Slattery. Why, every congress
man I've spoken to says he's in
terested in poor people."
"Yeh, that's why when they
gave a raise to all federal em
ployes, they specifically excluded
people who worked for the pov
erty program."
A Choice ...
"I'm sure there was nothing
personal in that, Slattery. Con
gress probably felt that people
who worked for the poverty pro
gram could get along on less
money because they knew how
poor people lived. Don't forget,
Congress had to cut somewhere
and what better place than in
poverty? You wouldn't want
them to cut the oil depletion al
lowances, would you?"
"Of course not," Slattery said.
"I'm not a fanatic about these
things. But I can't help thinking
that if the poor people had a rich
lobby they would have got all
the poverty money they want
ed."
"I'm surprised at you, Slat
tery, for thinking such evil
thoughts. Congress never bows
to vested interests. I can't recall
a single case where a congress
man has been influenced by a
strong lobby. What kind of rep

resentatives do you think we
have?"
"I guess you're right," Slat
tery admitted. "Perhaps they
have made life difficult for us
because they just don't like us."
"Now that makes more sense.
Nobody likes poor people, Slat
tery. They give people guilt feel
ings, and frankly, poverty gives
the country a bad name. Con
gress probably feels that by
strangling the poverty program
this year, they won't have to
face up to the problem next
year. This would certainly sim
plify everybody's life."
"Except mine."
Hung Up
"You never look at the big
picture. Do you, Slattery?"
"Poor people never do," he
said, still nursing the same beer.
"I guess that's our hang-up."
"I have an idea, Slattery,
though it may seem like a wild
one. Why don't poor people start
making missiles for defense?"
"What the heck for?"
"Well, once you start making
missiles, you could change your
name to the Office of Economic
Defense, and Congress would
give you twice as much money
as you need."
