# Letters To The Editor
## Water Cannoneers Display Initiative 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
To those Daily readers who
are wondering how an Engineer
ing School faculty member
could possibly sponsor such a
diabolical instrument of campus
warfare as a water balloon can
non, Daily Nov. 15, a word of
explanation:
Dr. Joseph Katz, in his recent
ly published report "Growth and
Constraint in College Students"
recommended that "Those fresh
men who feel ready to assume
independence, even if it seems
a brash independence, ought to
be given it, with the expectation
that they will confront them
selves and will be confronted
with the consequence of mis
taken choices."
A central objective of the
course in which the water bal
loon cannon was developed was
exactly as stated by Dr. Katz.
The senior design students who
designed the water balloon can
non were given complete free
dom of choice of project, along
with consequent responsibility,
probably for the first time in
their educational careers.
The design results of this un
usual gift of independence were
not all as "brash" as was the
cannon. For example, other stu
dents in the same course freely
chose and developed (l)a device
to aid in the treatment of cystic
fibrosis, (2) a wheel chair aid
for hemoplegics, and (3) a ski
binding which prevents a com
mon kind of leg fracture.
"Confronted with the conse
quences," how did the cannon
eers handle their responsibility?
The water balloon cannon has
an immaculate safety record. It
should; a tiny water balloon
diameter, 6 ounces) is a
far less dangerous projectile
than those more common cam
pus projectiles, the car, the bi
cycle, or the football player.
Further, the cannon itself is
carefully designed for safe oper
ation.
In ten years of teaching at
Stanford, I have often wondered
what has managed to suppress
the "Doodles Weaver dimen
sion" in the contemporary stu
dent. (If the reader hasn't heard
of the fabulous Doodles, this
lapse reinforces my point.) Sud
denly faced with a group of de
sign students with a Weaver
like glint in their eyes, I was
grateful to be teaching a course
intended to kindle, rather than
suppress, that turned-on sparkle
which is at the heart of the
creative process. I deeply enjoy
and trust that spark of life and
wish only that I saw it more
often in the eyes of Stanford
students.

Editor, The Daily:
We were present on the porch
of Encina Hall at the demonstra
tion against the C.I.A. when
Dean Joel Smith warned the
demonstrators that action would
be taken against them if they
did not clear away from the
doorway. While recognizing that
the occasion was noisy, and that
he could hardly be expected to
make a lengthy statement, we
do feel that his statement was
too broad to be enforced with
justice.
We are not signing a state
ment of complicity with those
charged, because we had no in
tention of blocking anyone's en
trance to the building. Many
people in the crowd were per
fectly willing to let people pass
amongst them. Indeed, they
made way for several people
who shouted "Excuse me" as
they passed through to the
door.
It would seem, then, very dif

ficult for Dean Joel Smith to
judge the intentions of members
of the crowd, and we believe that
he did so from his knowledge of
past actions.
Even the most militant of the
demonstrators were in fact seek
ing a symbolic confrontation, for
they blocked only one doorway
of a building that has many.
Thus, the nature of the action
itself would seem to be unclear,
and the criteria used to single
out some of those who commit
ted it for prosecution highly
questionable. We ask the admin
istration, not to pardon those
charged or to condone the dem
onstration, but to drop the
charges for insufficient evidence.

Editor, The Daily:
The pseudo-indictment by Mr.
Taubman in Tuesday's issue

wears better relative to the
Daily than to the Observer.
His article would not appear
so obviously hypocritical if it
were not for the fact that it
follows, by only a few days, the
poignant remarks of Mr. Schae
fer which relegated the Daily to
its proper position as the epi
tome of incompentent journal
ism. The rancor of a Hargrove,
the sophomoric bleatings of a
Weinberger, and the non-factual
reporting of a now off-campus
Kugelmass (Harvard's loss is
Stanford's gain, fortunately) are
only a few of myriad examples
to illustrate the point.
The small group of Stanford
ites representing the Land of
Oods lost its Wizard, Harris.
Why does the Daily continue
catering to these dubiously-mo
tivated malcontents whose ex
perience is far from overtaking
their ambitions? Such policy is
to the detriment of the paper
itself and the disgust of the com
munity at large.
Mr. Taubman himself used

the words "meet the standards
of journalism." Why not accept
the challenge, outside of the edi
torial which even the non-luna
tic fringe agrees is your invio
late prerogative, and proceed
about the business of producing
an objective newspaper?

It would be helpful to the
University Library if students
suggesting books for purchase
would put their names and ad
dresses in the spaces provided
on the suggestion blanks. They
will then be notified of action
taken, or new approaches to
finding what they need.
In a case at hand, a student
protested that "It seems impos
sible (but true according to the
catalog) that the library has
nothing by the eminent Cath
olic theologian Hans Kung." In
fact, there are approximately
twelve works under this author
in the main library catalog in
cluding eight or nine transla
tions of German works. The
problem is perhaps that the
catalog files his name as Kueng,
since the English language does
not use the umlaut. Since our
baffled inquirer did not sign his
name or address, we cannot
help him in this matter; we can
only hope that he reads the let
ters in the Dally.

To those Daily readers who
are wondering how an Engineer
ing School faculty member
could possibly sponsor such a
diabolical instrument of campus
warfare as a water balloon can
non, Daily Nov. 15, a word of
explanation:
Dr. Joseph Katz, in his recent
ly published report "Growth and
Constraint in College Students"
recommended that "Those fresh
men who feel ready to assume
independence, even if it seems
a brash independence, ought to
be given it, with the expectation
that they will confront them
selves and will be confronted
with the consequence of mis
taken choices."
A central objective of the
course in which the water bal
loon cannon was developed was
exactly as stated by Dr. Katz.
The senior design students who
designed the water balloon can
non were given complete free
dom of choice of project, along
with consequent responsibility,
probably for the first time in
their educational careers.
The design results of this un
usual gift of independence were
not all as "brash" as was the
cannon. For example, other stu
dents in the same course freely
chose and developed (l)a device
to aid in the treatment of cystic
fibrosis, (2) a wheel chair aid
for hemoplegics, and (3) a ski
binding which prevents a com
mon kind of leg fracture.
"Confronted with the conse
quences," how did the cannon
eers handle their responsibility?
The water balloon cannon has
an immaculate safety record. It
should; a tiny water balloon
diameter, 6 ounces) is a
far less dangerous projectile
than those more common cam
pus projectiles, the car, the bi
cycle, or the football player.
Further, the cannon itself is
carefully designed for safe oper
ation.
In ten years of teaching at
Stanford, I have often wondered
what has managed to suppress
the "Doodles Weaver dimen
sion" in the contemporary stu
dent. (If the reader hasn't heard
of the fabulous Doodles, this
lapse reinforces my point.) Sud
denly faced with a group of de
sign students with a Weaver
like glint in their eyes, I was
grateful to be teaching a course
intended to kindle, rather than
suppress, that turned-on sparkle
which is at the heart of the
creative process. I deeply enjoy
and trust that spark of life and
wish only that I saw it more
often in the eyes of Stanford
students.

We were present on the porch
of Encina Hall at the demonstra

Dean Joel Smith warned the
demonstrators that action would
be taken against them if they
did not clear away from the
doorway. While recognizing that
the occasion was noisy, and that
he could hardly be expected to
make a lengthy statement, we
do feel that his statement was
too broad to be enforced with
justice.
We are not signing a state
ment of complicity with those
charged, because we had no in
tention of blocking anyone's en
trance to the building. Many
people in the crowd were per
fectly willing to let people pass
amongst them. Indeed, they
made way for several people
who shouted "Excuse me" as
they passed through to the
door.
It would seem, then, very dif

ficult for Dean Joel Smith to
judge the intentions of members
of the crowd, and we believe that
he did so from his knowledge of
past actions.
Even the most militant of the
demonstrators were in fact seek
ing a symbolic confrontation, for
they blocked only one doorway
of a building that has many.
Thus, the nature of the action
itself would seem to be unclear,
and the criteria used to single
out some of those who commit

questionable. We ask the admin

its proper position as the epi

The pseudo-indictment by Mr.
Taubman in Tuesday's issue

wears better relative to the
Daily than to the Observer.
His article would not appear
so obviously hypocritical if it
were not for the fact that it
follows, by only a few days, the
poignant remarks of Mr. Schae
fer which relegated the Daily to
its proper position as the epi
tome of incompentent journal
ism. The rancor of a Hargrove,
the sophomoric bleatings of a
Weinberger, and the non-factual
reporting of a now off-campus
Kugelmass (Harvard's loss is
Stanford's gain, fortunately) are
only a few of myriad examples
to illustrate the point.
The small group of Stanford
ites representing the Land of
Oods lost its Wizard, Harris.
Why does the Daily continue
catering to these dubiously-mo
tivated malcontents whose ex
perience is far from overtaking
their ambitions? Such policy is
to the detriment of the paper
itself and the disgust of the com
munity at large.
Mr. Taubman himself used

the words "meet the standards
of journalism." Why not accept
the challenge, outside of the edi
torial which even the non-luna
tic fringe agrees is your invio
late prerogative, and proceed
about the business of producing
an objective newspaper?

To those Daily readers who
are wondering how an Engineer
ing School faculty member
could possibly sponsor such a
diabolical instrument of campus
warfare as a water balloon can
non, Daily Nov. 15, a word of
explanation:
Dr. Joseph Katz, in his recent
ly published report "Growth and
Constraint in College Students"
recommended that "Those fresh
men who feel ready to assume
independence, even if it seems
a brash independence, ought to
be given it, with the expectation
that they will confront them
selves and will be confronted
with the consequence of mis
taken choices."
A central objective of the
course in which the water bal
loon cannon was developed was
exactly as stated by Dr. Katz.
The senior design students who
designed the water balloon can
non were given complete free
dom of choice of project, along
with consequent responsibility,
probably for the first time in
their educational careers.
The design results of this un
usual gift of independence were
not all as "brash" as was the
cannon. For example, other stu
dents in the same course freely
chose and developed (l)a device
to aid in the treatment of cystic
fibrosis, (2) a wheel chair aid
for hemoplegics, and (3) a ski
binding which prevents a com
mon kind of leg fracture.
"Confronted with the conse
quences," how did the cannon
eers handle their responsibility?
The water balloon cannon has
an immaculate safety record. It
should; a tiny water balloon
diameter, 6 ounces) is a
far less dangerous projectile
than those more common cam
pus projectiles, the car, the bi
cycle, or the football player.
Further, the cannon itself is
carefully designed for safe oper
ation.
In ten years of teaching at
Stanford, I have often wondered
what has managed to suppress
the "Doodles Weaver dimen
sion" in the contemporary stu
dent. (If the reader hasn't heard
of the fabulous Doodles, this
lapse reinforces my point.) Sud
denly faced with a group of de
sign students with a Weaver
like glint in their eyes, I was
grateful to be teaching a course
intended to kindle, rather than
suppress, that turned-on sparkle
which is at the heart of the
creative process. I deeply enjoy
and trust that spark of life and
wish only that I saw it more
often in the eyes of Stanford
students.

We were present on the porch

Editor, The Daily:
We were present on the porch
of Encina Hall at the demonstra
tion against the C.I.A. when
Dean Joel Smith warned the
demonstrators that action would
be taken against them if they
did not clear away from the
doorway. While recognizing that
the occasion was noisy, and that
he could hardly be expected to
make a lengthy statement, we
do feel that his statement was
too broad to be enforced with
justice.
We are not signing a state
ment of complicity with those
charged, because we had no in
tention of blocking anyone's en
trance to the building. Many
people in the crowd were per
fectly willing to let people pass
amongst them. Indeed, they
made way for several people
who shouted "Excuse me" as
they passed through to the
door.
It would seem, then, very dif

ficult for Dean Joel Smith to
judge the intentions of members
of the crowd, and we believe that
he did so from his knowledge of
past actions.
Even the most militant of the
demonstrators were in fact seek
ing a symbolic confrontation, for
they blocked only one doorway
of a building that has many.
Thus, the nature of the action
itself would seem to be unclear,
and the criteria used to single
out some of those who commit
ted it for prosecution highly
questionable. We ask the admin
istration, not to pardon those
charged or to condone the dem
onstration, but to drop the
charges for insufficient evidence.

The pseudo-indictment by Mr.
Taubman in Tuesday's issue

wears better relative to the
Daily than to the Observer.
His article would not appear
so obviously hypocritical if it
were not for the fact that it
follows, by only a few days, the
poignant remarks of Mr. Schae
fer which relegated the Daily to
its proper position as the epi
tome of incompentent journal
ism. The rancor of a Hargrove,
the sophomoric bleatings of a
Weinberger, and the non-factual
reporting of a now off-campus
Kugelmass (Harvard's loss is
Stanford's gain, fortunately) are
only a few of myriad examples
to illustrate the point.
The small group of Stanford
ites representing the Land of
Oods lost its Wizard, Harris.
Why does the Daily continue
catering to these dubiously-mo
tivated malcontents whose ex
perience is far from overtaking
their ambitions? Such policy is
to the detriment of the paper
itself and the disgust of the com
munity at large.
Mr. Taubman himself used

the words "meet the standards
of journalism." Why not accept
the challenge, outside of the edi
torial which even the non-luna
tic fringe agrees is your invio
late prerogative, and proceed
about the business of producing
an objective newspaper?

It would be helpful to the
University Library if students
suggesting books for purchase
would put their names and ad
dresses in the spaces provided
on the suggestion blanks. They
will then be notified of action
taken, or new approaches to
finding what they need.
In a case at hand, a student
protested that "It seems impos
sible (but true according to the
catalog) that the library has
nothing by the eminent Cath
olic theologian Hans Kung." In
fact, there are approximately
twelve works under this author
in the main library catalog in
cluding eight or nine transla
tions of German works. The
problem is perhaps that the
catalog files his name as Kueng,
since the English language does
not use the umlaut. Since our
baffled inquirer did not sign his
name or address, we cannot
help him in this matter; we can
only hope that he reads the let
ters in the Dally.

Editor, The Daily:
To those Daily readers who
are wondering how an Engineer
ing School faculty member
could possibly sponsor such a
diabolical instrument of campus
warfare as a water balloon can
non, Daily Nov. 15, a word of
explanation:
Dr. Joseph Katz, in his recent
ly published report "Growth and
Constraint in College Students"
recommended that "Those fresh
men who feel ready to assume
independence, even if it seems
a brash independence, ought to
be given it, with the expectation
that they will confront them
selves and will be confronted
with the consequence of mis
taken choices."
A central objective of the
course in which the water bal
loon cannon was developed was
exactly as stated by Dr. Katz.
The senior design students who
designed the water balloon can
non were given complete free
dom of choice of project, along
with consequent responsibility,
probably for the first time in
their educational careers.
The design results of this un
usual gift of independence were
not all as "brash" as was the
cannon. For example, other stu
dents in the same course freely
chose and developed (l)a device
to aid in the treatment of cystic
fibrosis, (2) a wheel chair aid
for hemoplegics, and (3) a ski
binding which prevents a com
mon kind of leg fracture.
"Confronted with the conse
quences," how did the cannon
eers handle their responsibility?
The water balloon cannon has
an immaculate safety record. It
should; a tiny water balloon
diameter, 6 ounces) is a
far less dangerous projectile
than those more common cam
pus projectiles, the car, the bi
cycle, or the football player.
Further, the cannon itself is
carefully designed for safe oper
ation.
In ten years of teaching at
Stanford, I have often wondered
what has managed to suppress
the "Doodles Weaver dimen
sion" in the contemporary stu
dent. (If the reader hasn't heard
of the fabulous Doodles, this
lapse reinforces my point.) Sud
denly faced with a group of de
sign students with a Weaver
like glint in their eyes, I was
grateful to be teaching a course
intended to kindle, rather than
suppress, that turned-on sparkle
which is at the heart of the
creative process. I deeply enjoy
and trust that spark of life and
wish only that I saw it more
often in the eyes of Stanford
students.
