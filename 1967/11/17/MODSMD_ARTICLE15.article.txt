# Two Minutes of Haight
## The 						'War' Is Not Lost 
### Tim Haigbt 
Exactly one month ago today,
the protest movement was
rocked -by the violence of the
Tuesday confrontation a t the
Oakland Induction Center. After
that cataclysm, participants and
observers alike thought a mile
stone in the American peace
movement had been reached.
But a lot has happened since
then.
More demonstrations have oc
cured—the big one in Washing
ton, the anti-Dow sit-in at Har
vard, the anti-Rusk protest in
New York City. The ballot box
has figured heavily in the news,
too, not only with the defeat of
Proposition P and Shirley Tem
ple, but also with the election
of Carl Stokes and Richard
Hatcher.
Here at Stanford a lot of peo
ple came out of the Santa Rita
Jail with new dedication; the
anti-CIA protest flared for a
day then fizzled; and 2000 peo
ple, overwhelmingly students,
gathered for a midnight cele
bration for peace at Mem Chu
last Friday.
Change In Political Scene
In the national political arena,
Senator Eugene McCarthy be
gan to emerge as a rallying
point for the numerous anti-
Johnson Democrats looking for
a leader. Further, a war hero
aligned with the doves (like
Paul McCloskey) General James
Gavin, returned from Vietnam
with still dovish views. No one
is denying the possibility of his
running for President in the
New Hampshire primary.
It has not been a slow news
month. But here at Stanford
many are disconcerted. The im
pact of the anti-CIA debacle,
and the still-unresolved prob
lems of the Oakland demonstra

tions have somehow bogged
down the most articulate lead
ers of the local peace move
ment.
The debate goes on over "vio
lence" versus "non-violence".
Everyone searches for a new
tactic. The radicals huddle to
gether in Cubberley and bewail
their fate.
Looking Up To A Blue Sky?
They shouldn't. In sharp con
trast to the national administra
tion's policy of talking a win
ning war and fighting a stale
mated one, the radicals here are
singing the blues when things
are looking up.
Take Proposition P, for ex
ample. It would be folly to say
"75,000 San Franciscans can't
be wrong." That kind of think
ing is best left to the Gold
water Republicans. But one
could say that one-third of the
voters of San Francisco en
dorsed a solution of the war so
radical that not even William
Fullbright could fully support
it.
And then there's McCloskey.
While much of the election may
have been determined by "Anti-
Movie Backlash," at least a
straightforward proposal for de
escalation even if negotiations
fail is not certain political sui
cide. In fact, perhaps super
hawkisness a la Temple Black
is becoming the liability.
In spite of all the fulmination
over the possible reactions to
students' violent demonstra
tions, all peace candidates or
proposals are not being re
jected.
So why, if things aren't go
ing so poorly, are the radicals
feeling so bad? One reason is
extravagent expectations. We
seem to feel that nothing less

than LBJ's total capitulation
will satisfy us.
We also feel that we are a
dramatic and persecuted minor
ity romantically struggling, like
fish in a brackish ocean of
apathetic Americans. In a way
these feelings are good and
true. We need the pressure of
a difficult goal to keep us go
ing. And any student of Civil
Rights can see that "arousing
the American conscience" is an
idealistic dream.
Get Out Of The Bag
But wlien our self-dramatiza
tion and self-pity paralyzes in
stead of motivates, something is
wrong. Somehow we are letting
outside estimates of the move
ment, or petty squabbles over
idealized tactics (violence vs.
non-violence) erase the feelings
of hope that events may bring.
This is not just a problem of
the leaders of the radical move
ment at Stanford. Daily column
ists (mea culpa) have been
caught in the same bag.
The idea is to get out of that
bag. Any demonstration that
can come off, within limits of
practicality and morality, is
worth something—no matter if
it is a little disorderly or as ter
ribly orthodox as an election
or a church service. Any at
tempt to show people where the
peace movement is, even if
door-to-door canvassing is frus
trating and meetings are some
times poorly attended by new
faces, every bit helps.
The dilemma of the left is not
that of a hopeless minority in
a callous world, but of a grow
ing movement needing the stay
ing power that characterizes a
struggle once the romantic be
ginnings are over and the real
work drags on.
