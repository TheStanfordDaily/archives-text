# Drama Analysis
## Play Misinterprets Brecht 
### 
Defying the Aristotelian uni
ties of time, place and action,
Bertolt Brecht developed a com
plete theory of drama.
His plot is horizontally con
structed, held together by the
instructive meaning which the
play must contain: slides, songs,
asides — anything that might
serve to illumine the meaning
— become a part of the produc
tion. Episodes are grouped to
gether in some loose form which
is ultimately the didactic intent
of the play. To Brecht, theater
must be objective: if the viewer
becomes involved vicariously in
the production, if he "identifies"
with the actors and thereby ex
periences Aristotelian catharsis,
the objective meaning of the
play is lost.
To insure alienation, both in
the audience and in the actors
themselves, Brecht was careful
that the realism was never too
real, the sets never too com
plete, the sympathy or emotion
in the play never fully released.
He wanted his actors and his au
dience relaxed and aware that
the play was real only in its in
struction. That is, the actors
were never to "be" the people
they represented. The actors
judge the character, then play
the role in such a way that the
script's meaning is objectively
defined; that the viewer is aware
that he is outside the world of
the play and can evaluate the ac
tion.
Man is Man is structured
definitely by the question it
poses — what is man?, or, is
"The Keynote now is relativity."
Uriah will say later:
Give me your identity card.
Identity cards must in no way
and at no time be damaged.
And why not? Because a man
can be replaced any time but
nothing is sacred any more
unless its identity cards. (Act
I).
Identity in the play is assigned;
qualities and acts define the in
dividual and are never static.
Bloody Five, the expression of
the nature of war, turns into
Bloody Gent in a symbolic
change of clothes: his energy,
which has been released in war,
is now released sexually.
Galy Gay, the protaganist,
identified as a weak man initi
ally, with a head "like an ele
phant's," assumes the identity of
a man of war. As Galy he sells a
fake elephant (his former self),
and must deny his existence as
the Galy who has been killed
(symbolically) for his "crime."
He then must become the identi
ty he has been "acting out" —
Jeriah Jip, the soldier.
When the real Jip returns to
the regiment, Galy gives the

real Jip his Galy identity card,
and keeps the Jip identity card.
The movement of the play,
then, is the exchange of identity
by Galy; or rather, the imposi
tion of a new identity on Galy
"who can't say no." The complex
countermovements within the
play — Bloody Eye's castration
and loss of identity at the cru
cial moment of Galy's assump
tion of the soldier-self — help
to define this central motivating
force of Galy's transformation.
It is unfortunate that the
speech and drama' produc
tion failed to realize the nature
of the play. Brecht's theory, if
not understood, can lend itself
too to oversimplification, which
occurred in this production. No
where does Brecht indicate, nor
does the play call for, a carica
ture style of presentation. The
play and the characters are
highly complex, especially in re
lation to the nature of the ques
tions posed by Brecht, and an
oversimplifiaction is an adulter
ation of Brecht's play.
The focus of the production
was never clear: Galy Gay, the
central character of the play was
strong at the beginning, not
weak. He grabbed his wife, made
advances toward the Widow
Begbick. This is in actual anti
pahy of the role Brecht wrote.
Galy does not possess the sexual
energy which he later assumes
in the guise of a soldier; how
ever, this production projected
that Galy had this energy at
the play's outset, in definance of
the movement of the play
(Galy's "change"), and of the
imagery (the elephant, Bloody
Five's emasculization, etc.).
Indeed, the moments of great
est dramatic tension in the play
— the trial scene, the castration
scene, the finish — were ignored
and de-emphasized and lacked
the tremendous energy which
the scenes have. The trial scene
did approach definition; how
ever, it lacked the build-up of
tension and focus of energy that
are paramount to the scene.
This lack of focus I think was
the problem of the whole play.
The imposition of the war
theme, including the song we all
heard on KFRC ("son, then
burn your birth certificate") be
tween acts, is indicative of the
mis-conception of the play: cer
tainly the theme was there, but
wholly subordinate to the ques
tion of identity, which was nev
er precisely dealt with.
Not only was the complexity
of the play lost, but the Brech
tian technique was misused. Th*
Widow Begbick gives several
"asides" in the script. Asides
which serve to illuminate the
play as do the slide projections.
In this sense, the actor "steps

out" of his role for a moment
and speaks to the audience. This
production never included this
(note Begbick's "I'm Widow Beg
bick and this is my canteen"
scene, in which she delivers all
the lines to the soldiers who
have been there and have known
Begbick before).
Music in a Brecht play should
be ugly, dissonant, especially
when war is involved. Again a
misconception was apparent, for
the music lacked the dissonance
and ugliness it should project
(Note the "musical adptation" of
the canteen scene in the first
act. This play is not a musical;
the dancing should be for sex,
not for fun). The four-letter
words in the play should not be
exploited for laughs, as they are
part of the world of the play.
The character of Bloody Five
was totally misconceived: he was
not tough enough, frightening
enough, irrational enough as
Bloody Five, nor was he changed
enough as Bloody Gent. His func
tion jas a counter-movement to
the change of Galy Gay was un
developed.
It is obvious that gimmicks
and laughs were more import
ant in this production than the
play, and more than apparent
that the playwright and his the
ory were misunderstood. The
play must be motivated by the
identity theme, and because the
production did not exploit this
theme, the pace of the show was
non-existant. Lines didn't regi
ster properly, and characters
were mis-read. Even basic act
ing problems were unsolved: th?
endless pauses between lines
made the show twice as long as
it should have been; the "busi
ness" in the show always took
too long (setting up a machine
gun, drawing faces).
I found Begbick the closest to
attaining a Brechtian attitude:
however, lack of focus and direc
tion affected her role despite h°r
efforts. Polly was well played,
and needed only good direction

to sharpen and emphasize his
character more fully. Polly's
voice and ability were appreciat
ed in the light of the general
mediocrity of the show. The
Brechtian atmosphere was well
carried off by the "orchestra"
before the play began, but dis
solved as soon as the play be
gan.
The best thing about the pro
duction was the very Brechtian
design. Dick Hay, designer for
SRT, did a beautiful job and is
to be commended. The costumes
were also well done. The show
itself, however, sloppily conceiv
ed and executed, and unrealized
in its meaning, was a real dis
appointment. It wasn't Brech
tian. And even what it attempted
to be was pathetic.

Defying the Aristotelian uni
ties of time, place and action,
Bertolt Brecht developed a com
plete theory of drama.
His plot is horizontally con
structed, held together by the
instructive meaning which the
play must contain: slides, songs,
asides — anything that might
serve to illumine the meaning
— become a part of the produc
tion. Episodes are grouped to
gether in some loose form which
is ultimately the didactic intent
of the play. To Brecht, theater
must be objective: if the viewer
becomes involved vicariously in
the production, if he "identifies"
with the actors and thereby ex
periences Aristotelian catharsis,
the objective meaning of the
play is lost.
To insure alienation, both in
the audience and in the actors
themselves, Brecht was careful
that the realism was never too
real, the sets never too com
plete, the sympathy or emotion
in the play never fully released.
He wanted his actors and his au
dience relaxed and aware that
the play was real only in its in
struction. That is, the actors
were never to "be" the people
they represented. The actors
judge the character, then play
the role in such a way that the
script's meaning is objectively
defined; that the viewer is aware
that he is outside the world of
the play and can evaluate the ac
tion.
Man is Man is structured
definitely by the question it
poses — what is man?, or, is
"The Keynote now is relativity."
Uriah will say later:
Give me your identity card.
Identity cards must in no way
and at no time be damaged.
And why not? Because a man
can be replaced any time but
nothing is sacred any more
unless its identity cards. (Act
I).
Identity in the play is assigned;
qualities and acts define the in
dividual and are never static.
Bloody Five, the expression of
the nature of war, turns into
Bloody Gent in a symbolic
change of clothes: his energy,
which has been released in war,
is now released sexually.
Galy Gay, the protaganist,
identified as a weak man initi
ally, with a head "like an ele
phant's," assumes the identity of
a man of war. As Galy he sells a
fake elephant (his former self),
and must deny his existence as
the Galy who has been killed
(symbolically) for his "crime."
He then must become the identi
ty he has been "acting out" —
Jeriah Jip, the soldier.
When the real Jip returns to
the regiment, Galy gives the

real Jip his Galy identity card,
and keeps the Jip identity card.
The movement of the play,
then, is the exchange of identity
by Galy; or rather, the imposi
tion of a new identity on Galy
"who can't say no." The complex
countermovements within the
play — Bloody Eye's castration
and loss of identity at the cru
cial moment of Galy's assump
tion of the soldier-self — help
to define this central motivating
force of Galy's transformation.
It is unfortunate that the
speech and drama' produc
tion failed to realize the nature
of the play. Brecht's theory, if
not understood, can lend itself
too to oversimplification, which
occurred in this production. No
where does Brecht indicate, nor
does the play call for, a carica
ture style of presentation. The
play and the characters are
highly complex, especially in re
lation to the nature of the ques
tions posed by Brecht, and an
oversimplifiaction is an adulter
ation of Brecht's play.
The focus of the production
was never clear: Galy Gay, the
central character of the play was
strong at the beginning, not
weak. He grabbed his wife, made
advances toward the Widow
Begbick. This is in actual anti
pahy of the role Brecht wrote.
Galy does not possess the sexual
energy which he later assumes
in the guise of a soldier; how
ever, this production projected
that Galy had this energy at
the play's outset, in definance of
the movement of the play
(Galy's "change"), and of the
imagery (the elephant, Bloody
Five's emasculization, etc.).
Indeed, the moments of great
est dramatic tension in the play
— the trial scene, the castration
scene, the finish — were ignored
and de-emphasized and lacked
the tremendous energy which
the scenes have. The trial scene
did approach definition; how
ever, it lacked the build-up of
tension and focus of energy that
are paramount to the scene.
This lack of focus I think was
the problem of the whole play.
The imposition of the war
theme, including the song we all
heard on KFRC ("son, then
burn your birth certificate") be
tween acts, is indicative of the
mis-conception of the play: cer
tainly the theme was there, but
wholly subordinate to the ques
tion of identity, which was nev
er precisely dealt with.
Not only was the complexity
of the play lost, but the Brech
tian technique was misused. Th*
Widow Begbick gives several
"asides" in the script. Asides
which serve to illuminate the
play as do the slide projections.
In this sense, the actor "steps

out" of his role for a moment
and speaks to the audience. This
production never included this
(note Begbick's "I'm Widow Beg
bick and this is my canteen"
scene, in which she delivers all
the lines to the soldiers who
have been there and have known
Begbick before).
Music in a Brecht play should
be ugly, dissonant, especially
when war is involved. Again a
misconception was apparent, for
the music lacked the dissonance
and ugliness it should project
(Note the "musical adptation" of
the canteen scene in the first
act. This play is not a musical;
the dancing should be for sex,
not for fun). The four-letter
words in the play should not be
exploited for laughs, as they are
part of the world of the play.
The character of Bloody Five
was totally misconceived: he was
not tough enough, frightening
enough, irrational enough as
Bloody Five, nor was he changed
enough as Bloody Gent. His func
tion jas a counter-movement to
the change of Galy Gay was un
developed.
It is obvious that gimmicks
and laughs were more import
ant in this production than the
play, and more than apparent
that the playwright and his the
ory were misunderstood. The
play must be motivated by the
identity theme, and because the
production did not exploit this
theme, the pace of the show was
non-existant. Lines didn't regi
ster properly, and characters
were mis-read. Even basic act
ing problems were unsolved: th?
endless pauses between lines
made the show twice as long as
it should have been; the "busi
ness" in the show always took
too long (setting up a machine
gun, drawing faces).
I found Begbick the closest to
attaining a Brechtian attitude:
however, lack of focus and direc
tion affected her role despite h°r
efforts. Polly was well played,
and needed only good direction

to sharpen and emphasize his
character more fully. Polly's
voice and ability were appreciat
ed in the light of the general
mediocrity of the show. The
Brechtian atmosphere was well
carried off by the "orchestra"
before the play began, but dis
solved as soon as the play be

Defying the Aristotelian uni
ties of time, place and action,
Bertolt Brecht developed a com
plete theory of drama.
His plot is horizontally con
structed, held together by the
instructive meaning which the
play must contain: slides, songs,
asides — anything that might
serve to illumine the meaning
— become a part of the produc
tion. Episodes are grouped to
gether in some loose form which
is ultimately the didactic intent
of the play. To Brecht, theater
must be objective: if the viewer
becomes involved vicariously in
the production, if he "identifies"
with the actors and thereby ex
periences Aristotelian catharsis,
the objective meaning of the
play is lost.
To insure alienation, both in
the audience and in the actors
themselves, Brecht was careful
that the realism was never too
real, the sets never too com
plete, the sympathy or emotion
in the play never fully released.
He wanted his actors and his au
dience relaxed and aware that
the play was real only in its in
struction. That is, the actors
were never to "be" the people
they represented. The actors
judge the character, then play
the role in such a way that the
script's meaning is objectively
defined; that the viewer is aware
that he is outside the world of
the play and can evaluate the ac
tion.
Man is Man is structured
definitely by the question it
poses — what is man?, or, is
"The Keynote now is relativity."
Uriah will say later:
Give me your identity card.
Identity cards must in no way
and at no time be damaged.
And why not? Because a man
can be replaced any time but
nothing is sacred any more
unless its identity cards. (Act
I).
Identity in the play is assigned;
qualities and acts define the in
dividual and are never static.
Bloody Five, the expression of
the nature of war, turns into
Bloody Gent in a symbolic
change of clothes: his energy,
which has been released in war,
is now released sexually.
Galy Gay, the protaganist,
identified as a weak man initi
ally, with a head "like an ele
phant's," assumes the identity of
a man of war. As Galy he sells a
fake elephant (his former self),
and must deny his existence as
the Galy who has been killed
(symbolically) for his "crime."
He then must become the identi
ty he has been "acting out" —
Jeriah Jip, the soldier.
When the real Jip returns to
the regiment, Galy gives the

real Jip his Galy identity card,
and keeps the Jip identity card.
The movement of the play,
then, is the exchange of identity
by Galy; or rather, the imposi
tion of a new identity on Galy
"who can't say no." The complex
countermovements within the
play — Bloody Eye's castration
and loss of identity at the cru
cial moment of Galy's assump
tion of the soldier-self — help
to define this central motivating
force of Galy's transformation.
It is unfortunate that the
speech and drama' produc
tion failed to realize the nature
of the play. Brecht's theory, if
not understood, can lend itself
too to oversimplification, which
occurred in this production. No
where does Brecht indicate, nor
does the play call for, a carica
ture style of presentation. The
play and the characters are
highly complex, especially in re
lation to the nature of the ques
tions posed by Brecht, and an
oversimplifiaction is an adulter
ation of Brecht's play.
The focus of the production
was never clear: Galy Gay, the
central character of the play was
strong at the beginning, not
weak. He grabbed his wife, made
advances toward the Widow
Begbick. This is in actual anti
pahy of the role Brecht wrote.
Galy does not possess the sexual
energy which he later assumes
in the guise of a soldier; how
ever, this production projected
that Galy had this energy at
the play's outset, in definance of
the movement of the play
(Galy's "change"), and of the
imagery (the elephant, Bloody
Five's emasculization, etc.).
Indeed, the moments of great
est dramatic tension in the play
— the trial scene, the castration
scene, the finish — were ignored
and de-emphasized and lacked
the tremendous energy which
the scenes have. The trial scene
did approach definition; how
ever, it lacked the build-up of
tension and focus of energy that
are paramount to the scene.
This lack of focus I think was
the problem of the whole play.
The imposition of the war
theme, including the song we all
heard on KFRC ("son, then
burn your birth certificate") be
tween acts, is indicative of the
mis-conception of the play: cer
tainly the theme was there, but
wholly subordinate to the ques
tion of identity, which was nev
er precisely dealt with.
Not only was the complexity
of the play lost, but the Brech
tian technique was misused. Th*
Widow Begbick gives several
"asides" in the script. Asides
which serve to illuminate the
play as do the slide projections.
In this sense, the actor "steps

out" of his role for a moment
and speaks to the audience. This
production never included this
(note Begbick's "I'm Widow Beg
bick and this is my canteen"
scene, in which she delivers all
the lines to the soldiers who
have been there and have known
Begbick before).
Music in a Brecht play should
be ugly, dissonant, especially
when war is involved. Again a
misconception was apparent, for
the music lacked the dissonance
and ugliness it should project
(Note the "musical adptation" of
the canteen scene in the first
act. This play is not a musical;
the dancing should be for sex,
not for fun). The four-letter
words in the play should not be
exploited for laughs, as they are
part of the world of the play.
The character of Bloody Five
was totally misconceived: he was
not tough enough, frightening
enough, irrational enough as
Bloody Five, nor was he changed
enough as Bloody Gent. His func
tion jas a counter-movement to
the change of Galy Gay was un
developed.
It is obvious that gimmicks
and laughs were more import
ant in this production than the
play, and more than apparent
that the playwright and his the
ory were misunderstood. The
play must be motivated by the
identity theme, and because the
production did not exploit this
theme, the pace of the show was
non-existant. Lines didn't regi
ster properly, and characters
were mis-read. Even basic act
ing problems were unsolved: th?
endless pauses between lines
made the show twice as long as
it should have been; the "busi

the change of Galy Gay was un

It is obvious that gimmicks
and laughs were more import

play, and more than apparent
that the playwright and his the

production did not exploit this
theme, the pace of the show was
non-existant. Lines didn't regi

were mis-read. Even basic act

endless pauses between lines
made the show twice as long as
it should have been; the "busi

I found Begbick the closest to
attaining a Brechtian attitude:
however, lack of focus and direc

voice and ability were appreciat

mediocrity of the show. The
Brechtian atmosphere was well
carried off by the "orchestra"
before the play began, but dis
solved as soon as the play be

The best thing about the pro

design. Dick Hay, designer for

to be commended. The costumes

Defying the Aristotelian uni
ties of time, place and action,
Bertolt Brecht developed a com
plete theory of drama.
His plot is horizontally con
structed, held together by the
instructive meaning which the
play must contain: slides, songs,
asides — anything that might
serve to illumine the meaning
— become a part of the produc
tion. Episodes are grouped to
gether in some loose form which
is ultimately the didactic intent
of the play. To Brecht, theater
must be objective: if the viewer
becomes involved vicariously in
the production, if he "identifies"
with the actors and thereby ex
periences Aristotelian catharsis,
the objective meaning of the
play is lost.
To insure alienation, both in
the audience and in the actors
themselves, Brecht was careful
that the realism was never too
real, the sets never too com
plete, the sympathy or emotion
in the play never fully released.
He wanted his actors and his au
dience relaxed and aware that
the play was real only in its in
struction. That is, the actors
were never to "be" the people
they represented. The actors
judge the character, then play
the role in such a way that the
script's meaning is objectively
defined; that the viewer is aware
that he is outside the world of
the play and can evaluate the ac
tion.
Man is Man is structured
definitely by the question it
poses — what is man?, or, is
"The Keynote now is relativity."
Uriah will say later:
Give me your identity card.
Identity cards must in no way
and at no time be damaged.
And why not? Because a man
can be replaced any time but
nothing is sacred any more
unless its identity cards. (Act
I).
Identity in the play is assigned;
qualities and acts define the in
dividual and are never static.
Bloody Five, the expression of
the nature of war, turns into
Bloody Gent in a symbolic
change of clothes: his energy,
which has been released in war,
is now released sexually.
Galy Gay, the protaganist,
identified as a weak man initi
ally, with a head "like an ele
phant's," assumes the identity of
a man of war. As Galy he sells a
fake elephant (his former self),
and must deny his existence as
the Galy who has been killed
(symbolically) for his "crime."
He then must become the identi
ty he has been "acting out" —
Jeriah Jip, the soldier.
When the real Jip returns to
the regiment, Galy gives the

real Jip his Galy identity card,
and keeps the Jip identity card.
The movement of the play,
then, is the exchange of identity
by Galy; or rather, the imposi
tion of a new identity on Galy
"who can't say no." The complex
countermovements within the
play — Bloody Eye's castration
and loss of identity at the cru
cial moment of Galy's assump
tion of the soldier-self — help
to define this central motivating
force of Galy's transformation.
It is unfortunate that the
speech and drama' produc
tion failed to realize the nature
of the play. Brecht's theory, if
not understood, can lend itself
too to oversimplification, which
occurred in this production. No
where does Brecht indicate, nor
does the play call for, a carica
ture style of presentation. The
play and the characters are
highly complex, especially in re
lation to the nature of the ques
tions posed by Brecht, and an
oversimplifiaction is an adulter
ation of Brecht's play.
The focus of the production
was never clear: Galy Gay, the
central character of the play was
strong at the beginning, not
weak. He grabbed his wife, made
advances toward the Widow
Begbick. This is in actual anti
pahy of the role Brecht wrote.
Galy does not possess the sexual
energy which he later assumes
in the guise of a soldier; how
ever, this production projected
that Galy had this energy at
the play's outset, in definance of
the movement of the play
(Galy's "change"), and of the
imagery (the elephant, Bloody
Five's emasculization, etc.).
Indeed, the moments of great
est dramatic tension in the play
— the trial scene, the castration
scene, the finish — were ignored
and de-emphasized and lacked
the tremendous energy which
the scenes have. The trial scene
did approach definition; how
ever, it lacked the build-up of
tension and focus of energy that
are paramount to the scene.
This lack of focus I think was
the problem of the whole play.
The imposition of the war
theme, including the song we all
heard on KFRC ("son, then
burn your birth certificate") be
tween acts, is indicative of the
mis-conception of the play: cer
tainly the theme was there, but
wholly subordinate to the ques
tion of identity, which was nev
er precisely dealt with.
Not only was the complexity
of the play lost, but the Brech
tian technique was misused. Th*
Widow Begbick gives several
"asides" in the script. Asides
which serve to illuminate the
play as do the slide projections.
In this sense, the actor "steps

out" of his role for a moment
and speaks to the audience. This
production never included this
(note Begbick's "I'm Widow Beg
bick and this is my canteen"
scene, in which she delivers all
the lines to the soldiers who
have been there and have known
Begbick before).
Music in a Brecht play should
be ugly, dissonant, especially
when war is involved. Again a
misconception was apparent, for
the music lacked the dissonance
and ugliness it should project
(Note the "musical adptation" of
the canteen scene in the first
act. This play is not a musical;
the dancing should be for sex,
not for fun). The four-letter
words in the play should not be
exploited for laughs, as they are
part of the world of the play.
The character of Bloody Five
was totally misconceived: he was
not tough enough, frightening
enough, irrational enough as
Bloody Five, nor was he changed
enough as Bloody Gent. His func
tion jas a counter-movement to
the change of Galy Gay was un
developed.
It is obvious that gimmicks
and laughs were more import
ant in this production than the
play, and more than apparent
that the playwright and his the

play must be motivated by the
identity theme, and because the

misconception was apparent, for
the music lacked the dissonance
and ugliness it should project
(Note the "musical adptation" of
the canteen scene in the first
act. This play is not a musical;
the dancing should be for sex,
not for fun). The four-letter
words in the play should not be
exploited for laughs, as they are
part of the world of the play.
The character of Bloody Five
was totally misconceived: he was
not tough enough, frightening
enough, irrational enough as
Bloody Five, nor was he changed
enough as Bloody Gent. His func
tion jas a counter-movement to
the change of Galy Gay was un
developed.
It is obvious that gimmicks
and laughs were more import
ant in this production than the
play, and more than apparent
that the playwright and his the
ory were misunderstood. The
play must be motivated by the
identity theme, and because the
production did not exploit this
theme, the pace of the show was
non-existant. Lines didn't regi
ster properly, and characters
were mis-read. Even basic act
ing problems were unsolved: th?
endless pauses between lines
made the show twice as long as
it should have been; the "busi
ness" in the show always took
too long (setting up a machine
gun, drawing faces).
I found Begbick the closest to
attaining a Brechtian attitude:
however, lack of focus and direc
tion affected her role despite h°r
efforts. Polly was well played,
and needed only good direction

to sharpen and emphasize his
character more fully. Polly's
voice and ability were appreciat
ed in the light of the general
mediocrity of the show. The
Brechtian atmosphere was well
carried off by the "orchestra"
before the play began, but dis
solved as soon as the play be
gan.
The best thing about the pro
duction was the very Brechtian
design. Dick Hay, designer for
SRT, did a beautiful job and is
to be commended. The costumes
were also well done. The show
itself, however, sloppily conceiv
ed and executed, and unrealized
in its meaning, was a real dis
appointment. It wasn't Brech
tian. And even what it attempted
to be was pathetic.
