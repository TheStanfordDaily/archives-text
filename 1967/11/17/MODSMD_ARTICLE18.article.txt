# 10 Picket Dow Recruiters
## 
### 
Ten pickets stood outside the
Placement Service yesterday af
ternoon to protest the presence
of Dow Chemical Company re
cruiters on campus.
Dow makes a large amount of
the napalm used in Vietnam.
A similar protest is planned
this afternoon.
After a noon White Plaza ral
ly, protestors "may picket En
cina," according to picketer
Jack Gerson.
The rally will feature discus
sion of "what Dow does: why
we protest; the complicity thing;
and Nicholas de√ü. Katzenbach's
speech," says protestor John
Saari.

Yesterday, after an hour of
picketing and pamphleteering,
several pickets marched to En
cina Hall where Dow recruiters
were interviewing Stanford stu
dents.
Tom Bell, Assistant Chief of
the Stanford Police, was at En
cina, "to keep an eye on things."
Nothing materialized, how
ever. A locked door confronted
the picketers. They were refused
entrance to the building by stu
dent police. They departed in
about twenty minutes, after hav
ing taped a pamphlet to the
door.
