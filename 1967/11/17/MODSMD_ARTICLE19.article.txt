# Draft Cards Burned At Resistance Rally
## 
### BILL RORABAUGH 
A Stanford student, Richard
Baxstisser, and a former Stan
ford student, Michael Clausing,
were among four men who burn
ed their draft cards on the steps
of the San Francisco Federal
Building yesterday morning.
About 100 demonstrators and
a similar number of federal em
ployees watched the incident,
sponsored by the Resistance as
a measure of support for draft
resisters who have been arrest
ed across the country.
Dennis Sweeney, former Stan
ford student, led the rally on the
steps. Prof. Michael Novak also
spoke, reiterating the reasons
for his opposition to the war
and urging adults to support
draft resisters.
Baxstisser said it was the
fourth time he had burned his
draft card. He said the draft
board sent him a new one pach
time. A fifth man, Warren Fet
ters, from Oakland, burned what
he said was an army discharge.
One of the men who burned
his draft card, Dickie Harris,
said "We tried to turn our draft
cards in to the U.S. attorney, but
he was out of town."
Fights In Boston
In Boston, Assistant U.S. At
torney William Koen refused to
accept some 50 draft cards pre
sented to him by four represen
tatives of draft resisters. Two
fights broke out between the
draft protesters and government
supporters outside the building.

After a half-mile march from
a Boston church to the Federal
Building, the 200 demonstrators
were surrounded by a group of
1000 government supporters.
Snowballs were thrown and
hecklers shouted pro-government
slogans.
Mark Silverman, spokesman
for the Palo Alto Resistance,
called the rally "a show of soli
darity for those being arrested."
No one from Palo Alto has been
arrested.
Recently, three men were ar
rested in Denver for resisting
the draft. A high school student
in Cincinnati was turned in to
authorities by his principal for
refusing to register with the
draft, and 15 men in New York
were arrested for incidents last
spring
1500 Cards
Silverman said 1500 men had
turned in their draft cards na
tionwide under Resistance aus
pices. This total includes 17 pres
ent Stanford students, four
former Stanford students in
other areas, and 12 other mem
bers of the Palo Alto Resistance.
Although no arrests have been
made in Palo Alto, Silverman
cited Selective Service Director
General Hershey's recent letter
to draft boards as a sign of in
creased government pressure.
Doug Sorenson, a first-year law
student, and Jerry Silbergeld, a
graduate history student, have
both received delinquency no
tices from their draft boards.
