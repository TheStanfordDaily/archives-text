# LASSU Ratifies 5 Nominees For Committee Of Fifteen
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER MICHAEL MORTON 
Four of ASSU President Peter
Lyman's five nominations for
the Committee of 15 were rati
fied by the student legislature
last night.
The other position on the key
University committee will be
filled by Joseph Goone, a mem
ber of the Black Student Union
(BSU).
A late motion to reconsider
the appointments sparked a
walk-out that terminated LASSU
business for the evening for lack
of a quorum.
Speaker Mike Weinstein has
called a special session of the
legislature for next Tuesday at
7:30 p.m. in Room 320 to con
sider the remaining items on last
nights agenda.
Much of the prolonged and
spirited debate over the nomina
tions centered on whether the

student members of the Com
mittee of 15 should act as direct
negotiators on behalf of the leg
islature or as representatives of
individual constituencies.
Tom Forstenzer, one of Ly
man's nominees who was elected
to the committee, articulated the
former viewpoint. "You are
choosing negotiators", he said.
They should not be policy mak
ers."
Represent A Fifth
Fritz Schafer, a committee
nominee from the floor of the
legislature, disputed Forstenzer's
position. Referring to last
spring's presidential elections,
Schaefer claimed that he could
represent "at least one-fifth of
the student body" on the com
mittee.
Pointing out that all of Ly
man's nominees were from the
humanities or social sciences,
Schaefer stated his position in
the natural sciences qualified
him to represent otherwise
disenfranchised point of view.
In addition to Schaefer, three
other LASSU nominees, soph
omore Bob Spanner, grad stu
dent John Munger and Goone
also admitted that specific con
stituencies would influence their
actions on the committee.
Representative Tim Haight,
speaking in open debate on the
nominations, summarized the
two hour discussion and con
curred with Forstenzer's argu
ment, citing the history of the
committee as a negotiating body.
He stated that it would be
"absurd" to change the nature
of the body to a directly repre
sentative "debating society."
Late Entrant
Goone was a late entrant to
the race. His name was placed
in nomination by LASSU repre
sentative Arthur Wilson, a mem
ber of the BSU.
Wilson cited a need to repre
sent "the uninformed," the black
minority in the University. The
decision to enter Goone into the
race was reached after consulta
tion with the other BSU dele
gates, only hours before the leg
islative session.
After his election Goone told
The Daily that, although the
BSU would not dictate his ac

tions on the committee, that is
who he would represent.
Goone's nomination was sup
ported by Haight. He explained
that the singular position of the
Negro vis-a-vis the American
political system tended to give
him a negotiating ability un
matched by his white counter
parts.
Besides Forstenzer, three oth
er Lyman nominees led the leg
islature voting. They are Maur
een Kulbaitis, Dell Martin, and
John Raskin.
Nominees Defended
In his report to the legislature
Lyman defended his nominees,
saying that he chose "five differ
ent kinds of people from differ
ent parts of the University." He
sees the committee as "the only
legitimate ruling body in the
University."
The Committee of 15 is com
posed of five members from
each of the three constituencies
in the University: faculty, ad
ministration, and students.
Faculty members, appointed
by the Academic Council, are:
J.M. Carlsmith, S.M. Dornbusch,
M.A. Franklin, R.A. Helliwell,
and H.R. Marshall. Presidential
appointees are: E.H. Brooks,
R.R. Sears, R.A. Walker, and
V. K. Whitaker, and J. P. Smith.
Lyman also emphasized in
his report that he hopes the
Committee of 15 will increase
the membership of the now all
faculty Interim Judicial Board

(IJB) to include an equal num
ber of students. He proposed
that the committee eventually
replace the IJB with a perma
nent student-faculty board.
With regard to University
demonstrations policy, Lyman
said, "Freedom to speak is not
freedom to talk, but freedom to
exchange ideas. When somebody
comes here to tell us what the
truth is, that's not exchange of
ideas, that's propaganda. The
policy as now stated is just
going to cause trouble."
Present University policy
states that demonstrations are
illegal if they interfere with pe
destrian or vehicular traffic, or
disrupt any University func
tions.
Lyman added that student
membership on Presidential
Committees is increasing. Re
placing the old policy of two stu
dent nominations for every
Presidential Committee opening

7:30 p.m. in Room 320 to con
sider the remaining items on last
nights agenda.
Much of the prolonged and
spirited debate over the nomina
tions centered on whether the

student members of the Com
mittee of 15 should act as direct
negotiators on behalf of the leg
islature or as representatives of
individual constituencies.
Tom Forstenzer, one of Ly
man's nominees who was elected
to the committee, articulated the
former viewpoint. "You are
choosing negotiators", he said.
They should not be policy mak
ers."
Represent A Fifth
Fritz Schafer, a committee
nominee from the floor of the
legislature, disputed Forstenzer's
position. Referring to last
spring's presidential elections,
Schaefer claimed that he could
represent "at least one-fifth of
the student body" on the com
mittee.
Pointing out that all of Ly
man's nominees were from the
humanities or social sciences,
Schaefer stated his position in
the natural sciences qualified
him to represent otherwise
disenfranchised point of view.
In addition to Schaefer, three
other LASSU nominees, soph
omore Bob Spanner, grad stu
dent John Munger and Goone
also admitted that specific con
stituencies would influence their
actions on the committee.
Representative Tim Haight,
speaking in open debate on the
nominations, summarized the
two hour discussion and con
curred with Forstenzer's argu
ment, citing the history of the
committee as a negotiating body.
He stated that it would be
"absurd" to change the nature
of the body to a directly repre
sentative "debating society."
Late Entrant
Goone was a late entrant to
the race. His name was placed
in nomination by LASSU repre
sentative Arthur Wilson, a mem
ber of the BSU.
Wilson cited a need to repre
sent "the uninformed," the black
minority in the University. The
decision to enter Goone into the
race was reached after consulta
tion with the other BSU dele
gates, only hours before the leg
islative session.
After his election Goone told
The Daily that, although the
BSU would not dictate his ac

tions on the committee, that is
who he would represent.
Goone's nomination was sup
ported by Haight. He explained
that the singular position of the
Negro vis-a-vis the American
political system tended to give
him a negotiating ability un
matched by his white counter
parts.
Besides Forstenzer, three oth
er Lyman nominees led the leg
islature voting. They are Maur
een Kulbaitis, Dell Martin, and
John Raskin.
Nominees Defended
In his report to the legislature
Lyman defended his nominees,
saying that he chose "five differ
ent kinds of people from differ
ent parts of the University." He
sees the committee as "the only
legitimate ruling body in the
University."
The Committee of 15 is com
posed of five members from
each of the three constituencies
in the University: faculty, ad
ministration, and students.
Faculty members, appointed
by the Academic Council, are:
J.M. Carlsmith, S.M. Dornbusch,
M.A. Franklin, R.A. Helliwell,
and H.R. Marshall. Presidential
appointees are: E.H. Brooks,
R.R. Sears, R.A. Walker, and
V. K. Whitaker, and J. P. Smith.
Lyman also emphasized in
his report that he hopes the
Committee of 15 will increase
the membership of the now all
faculty Interim Judicial Board

(IJB) to include an equal num
ber of students. He proposed
that the committee eventually
replace the IJB with a perma
nent student-faculty board.
With regard to University
demonstrations policy, Lyman
said, "Freedom to speak is not
freedom to talk, but freedom to
exchange ideas. When somebody
comes here to tell us what the
truth is, that's not exchange of
ideas, that's propaganda. The
policy as now stated is just
going to cause trouble."
Present University policy
states that demonstrations are
illegal if they interfere with pe
destrian or vehicular traffic, or
disrupt any University func
tions.

membership on Presidential
Committees is increasing. Re

nominee from the floor of the
legislature, disputed Forstenzer's
position. Referring to last
spring's presidential elections,
Schaefer claimed that he could
represent "at least one-fifth of
the student body" on the com
mittee.
Pointing out that all of Ly
man's nominees were from the
humanities or social sciences,
Schaefer stated his position in
the natural sciences qualified
him to represent otherwise
disenfranchised point of view.
In addition to Schaefer, three
other LASSU nominees, soph
omore Bob Spanner, grad stu
dent John Munger and Goone
also admitted that specific con
stituencies would influence their
actions on the committee.
Representative Tim Haight,
speaking in open debate on the
nominations, summarized the
two hour discussion and con
curred with Forstenzer's argu
ment, citing the history of the
committee as a negotiating body.
He stated that it would be
"absurd" to change the nature
of the body to a directly repre
sentative "debating society."
Late Entrant
Goone was a late entrant to
the race. His name was placed
in nomination by LASSU repre
sentative Arthur Wilson, a mem
ber of the BSU.
Wilson cited a need to repre
sent "the uninformed," the black
minority in the University. The
decision to enter Goone into the
race was reached after consulta
tion with the other BSU dele
gates, only hours before the leg
islative session.
After his election Goone told
The Daily that, although the
BSU would not dictate his ac

tions on the committee, that is
who he would represent.
Goone's nomination was sup
ported by Haight. He explained
that the singular position of the
Negro vis-a-vis the American
political system tended to give
him a negotiating ability un
matched by his white counter
parts.
Besides Forstenzer, three oth
er Lyman nominees led the leg
islature voting. They are Maur
een Kulbaitis, Dell Martin, and
John Raskin.
Nominees Defended
In his report to the legislature
Lyman defended his nominees,
saying that he chose "five differ
ent kinds of people from differ
ent parts of the University." He
sees the committee as "the only
legitimate ruling body in the
University."
The Committee of 15 is com
posed of five members from
each of the three constituencies
in the University: faculty, ad
ministration, and students.
Faculty members, appointed
by the Academic Council, are:
J.M. Carlsmith, S.M. Dornbusch,
M.A. Franklin, R.A. Helliwell,
and H.R. Marshall. Presidential
appointees are: E.H. Brooks,
R.R. Sears, R.A. Walker, and
V. K. Whitaker, and J. P. Smith.
Lyman also emphasized in
his report that he hopes the
Committee of 15 will increase
the membership of the now all
faculty Interim Judicial Board

(IJB) to include an equal num
ber of students. He proposed
that the committee eventually
replace the IJB with a perma
nent student-faculty board.
With regard to University
demonstrations policy, Lyman
said, "Freedom to speak is not
freedom to talk, but freedom to
exchange ideas. When somebody
comes here to tell us what the
truth is, that's not exchange of
ideas, that's propaganda. The
policy as now stated is just
going to cause trouble."
Present University policy
states that demonstrations are
illegal if they interfere with pe
destrian or vehicular traffic, or
disrupt any University func
tions.
Lyman added that student
membership on Presidential
Committees is increasing. Re
placing the old policy of two stu
dent nominations for every
Presidential Committee opening

DISTURBING THE PEACE — Generally disrupting the normal educational process, an organized
Band, led by women scantily clad in red, invaded campus buildings last night. They are shown here
disrupting the legislative process at last night's LASSU meeting.
Four of ASSU President Peter
Lyman's five nominations for
the Committee of 15 were rati
fied by the student legislature
last night.
The other position on the key
University committee will be
filled by Joseph Goone, a mem
ber of the Black Student Union
(BSU).
A late motion to reconsider
the appointments sparked a
walk-out that terminated LASSU
business for the evening for lack
of a quorum.
Speaker Mike Weinstein has
called a special session of the
legislature for next Tuesday at
7:30 p.m. in Room 320 to con
sider the remaining items on last
nights agenda.
Much of the prolonged and
spirited debate over the nomina
tions centered on whether the

student members of the Com
mittee of 15 should act as direct
negotiators on behalf of the leg
islature or as representatives of
individual constituencies.
Tom Forstenzer, one of Ly
man's nominees who was elected
to the committee, articulated the
former viewpoint. "You are
choosing negotiators", he said.
They should not be policy mak
ers."
