# Narrow Escape From Blaze
## Perilous Candle Cult In Wilbur 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Freshman Laird Caruthers
decided not to guard the bon
fire last night. That's why he
got burned.
While Caruthers stayed in his
room and studied German into
the early hours of the morning,
almost everyone else in Rincon
ada house of Wilbur trooped off
to a 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. shift
guarding the telephone poles
erected as a framework for to
day's bonfire.
Rinconada's second floor was
practically empty when Caruth
ers dozed off to sleep with a
candle burning brightly next to
his bed, dripping wax artfully
down the side of the Michelob
beer bottle that served as its
holder.
A few hours later fire had left
his room a scorched shambles
and Caruthers, having barely
escaped asphyxiation, slept un
der sedation at Cowell Health
Center with burns on his hands
and right foot.
It was to say the least, an un
conventional fire. Even for Wil

bur, which makes a cull of the
unusual.
Caruthers sustained some of
his burns when he leaped up
barefoot and tried to stomp out
the fire on his rug. He wanted
to rescue his piccolo.
The fire started because, in
directly, Wilbur is so jammed
with freshmen that two stu
dents were assigned to Caruth
ers' room, which was designed
as a single.
The blaze was extinguished
by a taciturn sponsor with a
Southern drawl who got chewed
out by a fire marshal for not
calling the fire department.
And the aftermath promises
to be a vigilant campaign to
sweep Wilbur clean of candle
burning.
Caruthers himself takes the
episode in stride. His burns are
minor and he will be released
from Cowell in a few days.
Rinconada HKing'?
A 17-year-old from Loomis,
Calif., with curly black hair and
sideburns, Caruthers has had
the nickname "King" since his
election campaign for house
president in October. "My plat
form was that I'd be king, not
president." he explained.
He steadfastly refuses to re
gret his decision not to join
his roommate and others last
night in the traditional guard
ing of the telephone poles in
Lake Lagunita. "I just didn't
have time to go to the bonfire
and study German," he said.
Having skipped Wednesday's
class, he was apprehensive
about Thursday's 8 a.m. session.
Caruthers and his roommate
Larry Connors burned candles
frequently; "three or four a
day." Both the candles and the
Michelog bottles come from the
Wilbur dinner tables, Caruthers
says. In fact, King Caruthers
helped spread the fad of candle
burning in Rinconada.
One Candle Freak-Out
When the room is darkened
and the glow of the candle flame
reflects in the smoked glass of
the bottle, "it looks re?lly pret
ty," Caruthers confided.
Usually he puts out the can
dles before going to sleep, but

this time he let the flame burn
while sleep interrupted his
study. He stretched out, fully
clothed but barefoot, on the
lower bunk of the tiny room's
bunkbeds. The candle on its
bottle rose about 18 inches high
right beside him.
Sometime after 5 a.m., as
weary Rinconada men straggled
back from the telephone poles,
the candle lost its perpendicu
larity. "I assume I just rolled
over and kicked it," Caruthers
pondered.
Tries To Save Pic^colo
His first reaction was fear. "If
you wake up and see your room
burning down, you're scared,"
he explained cogently. "All my
clothes were in there, and my
flute. It's a sterling silver pic
colo, handmade in Elkhart, In
diana. I play it in the band."
So Caruthers' next impulse
was to somehow put out the
fire, which had reached bed
spreads hung decoratively from
the ceiling, and was moving
rapidly over the rug toward an
old upholstered chair. Caruthers
leaped off the burning mattress
and started to stomp out the
fire with his bare feet.
After a few frantic moments
he grabbed a woolen blanket
and tried to smother some
smoldering towels, and he
burned his hands in the process.
As the room filled with smoke,
Caruthers, at bay, pulled down
one of the blazing bedspreads
from the ceiling and ran out
the door.
Helmke Suspects
When sponsor Jim Helmke,
returning from the water foun
tain, saw Caruthers run out
of his room in what he called
"a kind of controlled panic,"
clutching a burning bedspread,
dropping fiery embers and let
ting clouds of gray smoke into
the hall, he thought something
was amiss.
Caruthers grabbed a soda
acid fire extinguisher off the
wall and ran back to the room,
Helmke close behind. Still un
aware of his burns, Caruthers
tried to put out the fire.
"I couldn't breathe in all that
smoke," he recalled later. "I

ran out and Jim grabbed the ex
tinguisher and ran in."
In a few moments Helmke
had put out the fire, perhaps
15 minutes after the candle had
lost its perpendicularity.
When asked later how he en
dured the smoke which over
came Caruthers. Helmke replied
thoughtfully, "Well, it sure
didn't smell very good. There
were foam rubber pillows and
things burning."
Helmke called the fire depart
ment after the flames were ex
tinguished. During the frantic
fire it hadn't oceured to Helmke
or Caruthers to pull a fire
alarm, and the fire marshal ex
pressed his displeasure at their
omission.
Meanwhile Caruthers went
back into the room and put on
his sneakers and socks, still not
realizing the extent of his
burns. But before the fire mar
shal arrived he went up to
Helmke and confided, "I burned
the dickens out of my foot."
(Caruthers did not say 'dick
ens.' )
Soak It Where?
Helmke says he advised Car
uthers to go soak it in a toilet
bowl, this being the closest de
pository of cool water. Just then
the fire marshal arrived, or
dered Caruthers to remove his
shoe, and looked at the foot. He
decided Caruthers should re
ceive treatment, so Caruthers
put the shoe back on and limped
off to Cowell.
After he "almost passed out"
from a sudden onrush of pain,
Caruthers had his hands and
right foot immersed in ice
water by health center nurses
before the burns were dressed
yesterday morning.
Caruthers hadn't spent more
than an hour of his convales
cence at Cowell before his first
visitor arrived. The visitor was
n't a girl friend or Wilbur
friend, however; he was Santa
Clara Deputy Fire Marshall
Raymond G. Gamma, who ar
rived with the cheerful com
ment, "Little boys who play
with matches get burned." To
this, Caruthers only smiled.
A ten minute interview en

sued, during which Caruthers
confessed to Gamma "I'm
through with candles."
It's a shame Caruther's mat
tress lay directly on the floor,
because if it had been elevated
the usual few inches off the
ground he might not have
started the fire by knocking
over the candle with some move
ment of his body while asleep.
But two weeks ago Caruthers
and Collins had removed the
mattress from the frame and
set it down on the floor , be
cause Caruthers, who is 5' 10,"
kept bumping his head on the
springs of the matress above.
And the two freshmen had to
have a bunkbed arrangement,
because the 8' by 16' room
couldn't hold two separate beds.
Caruthers was roused grog
gilv from sleep by the heat of
his* mattress and rug. A lire cap
tain later commented that Car
uthers probably awoke just in
time to avoid asphyxiation in
the smoky room.

this, Caruthers only smiled.
A ten minute interview en

sued, during which Caruthers
confessed to Gamma "I'm
through with candles."
It's a shame Caruther's mat
tress lay directly on the floor,
because if it had been elevated
the usual few inches off the
ground he might not have
started the fire by knocking
over the candle with some move
ment of his body while asleep.
But two weeks ago Caruthers
and Collins had removed the
mattress from the frame and
set it down on the floor , be
cause Caruthers, who is 5' 10,"
kept bumping his head on the
springs of the matress above.
And the two freshmen had to
have a bunkbed arrangement,
because the 8' by 16' room
couldn't hold two separate beds.
Caruthers was roused grog
gilv from sleep by the heat of
his* mattress and rug. A lire cap
tain later commented that Car
uthers probably awoke just in
time to avoid asphyxiation in
the smoky room.
Freshman Laird Caruthers
decided not to guard the bon
fire last night. That's why he
got burned.
While Caruthers stayed in his
room and studied German into
the early hours of the morning,
almost everyone else in Rincon
ada house of Wilbur trooped off
to a 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. shift
guarding the telephone poles
erected as a framework for to
day's bonfire.
Rinconada's second floor was
practically empty when Caruth
ers dozed off to sleep with a
candle burning brightly next to
his bed, dripping wax artfully
down the side of the Michelob
beer bottle that served as its
holder.
A few hours later fire had left
his room a scorched shambles
and Caruthers, having barely
escaped asphyxiation, slept un
der sedation at Cowell Health
Center with burns on his hands
and right foot.
It was to say the least, an un
conventional fire. Even for Wil

bur, which makes a cull of the
unusual.
Caruthers sustained some of
his burns when he leaped up
barefoot and tried to stomp out
the fire on his rug. He wanted
to rescue his piccolo.
The fire started because, in
directly, Wilbur is so jammed
with freshmen that two stu
dents were assigned to Caruth
ers' room, which was designed
as a single.
The blaze was extinguished
by a taciturn sponsor with a
Southern drawl who got chewed
out by a fire marshal for not
calling the fire department.
And the aftermath promises
to be a vigilant campaign to
sweep Wilbur clean of candle
burning.
Caruthers himself takes the
episode in stride. His burns are
minor and he will be released
from Cowell in a few days.
Rinconada HKing'?
A 17-year-old from Loomis,
Calif., with curly black hair and
sideburns, Caruthers has had
the nickname "King" since his
election campaign for house
president in October. "My plat
form was that I'd be king, not
president." he explained.
He steadfastly refuses to re
gret his decision not to join
his roommate and others last
night in the traditional guard
ing of the telephone poles in
Lake Lagunita. "I just didn't
have time to go to the bonfire
and study German," he said.
Having skipped Wednesday's
class, he was apprehensive
about Thursday's 8 a.m. session.
Caruthers and his roommate
Larry Connors burned candles
frequently; "three or four a
day." Both the candles and the
Michelog bottles come from the
Wilbur dinner tables, Caruthers
says. In fact, King Caruthers
helped spread the fad of candle
burning in Rinconada.
One Candle Freak-Out
When the room is darkened
and the glow of the candle flame
reflects in the smoked glass of
the bottle, "it looks re?lly pret
ty," Caruthers confided.
Usually he puts out the can
dles before going to sleep, but

this time he let the flame burn
while sleep interrupted his
study. He stretched out, fully
clothed but barefoot, on the
lower bunk of the tiny room's
bunkbeds. The candle on its
bottle rose about 18 inches high
right beside him.
Sometime after 5 a.m., as
weary Rinconada men straggled
back from the telephone poles,
the candle lost its perpendicu
larity. "I assume I just rolled
over and kicked it," Caruthers
pondered.
Tries To Save Pic^colo
His first reaction was fear. "If
you wake up and see your room
burning down, you're scared,"
he explained cogently. "All my
clothes were in there, and my
flute. It's a sterling silver pic
colo, handmade in Elkhart, In
diana. I play it in the band."
So Caruthers' next impulse
was to somehow put out the
fire, which had reached bed
spreads hung decoratively from
the ceiling, and was moving
rapidly over the rug toward an
old upholstered chair. Caruthers
leaped off the burning mattress
and started to stomp out the
fire with his bare feet.
After a few frantic moments
he grabbed a woolen blanket
and tried to smother some
smoldering towels, and he
burned his hands in the process.
As the room filled with smoke,
Caruthers, at bay, pulled down
one of the blazing bedspreads
from the ceiling and ran out
the door.
Helmke Suspects
When sponsor Jim Helmke,
returning from the water foun
tain, saw Caruthers run out
of his room in what he called
"a kind of controlled panic,"
clutching a burning bedspread,
dropping fiery embers and let
ting clouds of gray smoke into
the hall, he thought something
was amiss.
Caruthers grabbed a soda
acid fire extinguisher off the
wall and ran back to the room,
Helmke close behind. Still un
aware of his burns, Caruthers
tried to put out the fire.
"I couldn't breathe in all that
smoke," he recalled later. "I

ran out and Jim grabbed the ex
tinguisher and ran in."
In a few moments Helmke
had put out the fire, perhaps
15 minutes after the candle had
lost its perpendicularity.
When asked later how he en
dured the smoke which over
came Caruthers. Helmke replied
thoughtfully, "Well, it sure
didn't smell very good. There
were foam rubber pillows and
things burning."
Helmke called the fire depart
ment after the flames were ex
tinguished. During the frantic
fire it hadn't oceured to Helmke
or Caruthers to pull a fire
alarm, and the fire marshal ex
pressed his displeasure at their
omission.
Meanwhile Caruthers went
back into the room and put on
his sneakers and socks, still not
realizing the extent of his
burns. But before the fire mar
shal arrived he went up to
Helmke and confided, "I burned
the dickens out of my foot."
(Caruthers did not say 'dick
ens.' )
Soak It Where?
Helmke says he advised Car
uthers to go soak it in a toilet
bowl, this being the closest de
pository of cool water. Just then
the fire marshal arrived, or
dered Caruthers to remove his
shoe, and looked at the foot. He
decided Caruthers should re
ceive treatment, so Caruthers
put the shoe back on and limped
off to Cowell.
After he "almost passed out"
from a sudden onrush of pain,
Caruthers had his hands and
right foot immersed in ice
water by health center nurses
before the burns were dressed
yesterday morning.
Caruthers hadn't spent more
than an hour of his convales
cence at Cowell before his first
visitor arrived. The visitor was
n't a girl friend or Wilbur
friend, however; he was Santa
Clara Deputy Fire Marshall
Raymond G. Gamma, who ar
rived with the cheerful com
ment, "Little boys who play
with matches get burned." To
this, Caruthers only smiled.

the dickens out of my foot."
(Caruthers did not say 'dick

Soak It Where?
Helmke says he advised Car
uthers to go soak it in a toilet
bowl, this being the closest de
pository of cool water. Just then
the fire marshal arrived, or
dered Caruthers to remove his
shoe, and looked at the foot. He
decided Caruthers should re
ceive treatment, so Caruthers
put the shoe back on and limped
off to Cowell.
After he "almost passed out"
from a sudden onrush of pain,
Caruthers had his hands and
right foot immersed in ice
water by health center nurses
before the burns were dressed
yesterday morning.
Caruthers hadn't spent more
than an hour of his convales
cence at Cowell before his first
visitor arrived. The visitor was
n't a girl friend or Wilbur
friend, however; he was Santa
Clara Deputy Fire Marshall
Raymond G. Gamma, who ar
rived with the cheerful com
ment, "Little boys who play
with matches get burned." To
this, Caruthers only smiled.
A ten minute interview en

sued, during which Caruthers
confessed to Gamma "I'm
through with candles."
It's a shame Caruther's mat
tress lay directly on the floor,
because if it had been elevated
the usual few inches off the
ground he might not have
started the fire by knocking
over the candle with some move
ment of his body while asleep.
But two weeks ago Caruthers
and Collins had removed the
mattress from the frame and
set it down on the floor , be
cause Caruthers, who is 5' 10,"
kept bumping his head on the
springs of the matress above.
And the two freshmen had to
have a bunkbed arrangement,
because the 8' by 16' room
couldn't hold two separate beds.
Caruthers was roused grog
gilv from sleep by the heat of
his* mattress and rug. A lire cap
tain later commented that Car
uthers probably awoke just in
time to avoid asphyxiation in
the smoky room.
Freshman Laird Caruthers
decided not to guard the bon
fire last night. That's why he
got burned.
While Caruthers stayed in his
room and studied German into
the early hours of the morning,
almost everyone else in Rincon
ada house of Wilbur trooped off
to a 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. shift
guarding the telephone poles
erected as a framework for to
day's bonfire.
Rinconada's second floor was
practically empty when Caruth
ers dozed off to sleep with a
candle burning brightly next to
his bed, dripping wax artfully
down the side of the Michelob
beer bottle that served as its
holder.
A few hours later fire had left
his room a scorched shambles
and Caruthers, having barely
escaped asphyxiation, slept un
der sedation at Cowell Health
Center with burns on his hands
and right foot.
It was to say the least, an un
conventional fire. Even for Wil

bur, which makes a cull of the
unusual.
Caruthers sustained some of
his burns when he leaped up
barefoot and tried to stomp out
the fire on his rug. He wanted
to rescue his piccolo.
The fire started because, in
directly, Wilbur is so jammed
with freshmen that two stu
dents were assigned to Caruth
ers' room, which was designed
as a single.
The blaze was extinguished
by a taciturn sponsor with a
Southern drawl who got chewed
out by a fire marshal for not
calling the fire department.
And the aftermath promises
to be a vigilant campaign to
sweep Wilbur clean of candle
burning.
Caruthers himself takes the
episode in stride. His burns are
minor and he will be released
from Cowell in a few days.
Rinconada HKing'?
A 17-year-old from Loomis,
Calif., with curly black hair and
sideburns, Caruthers has had
the nickname "King" since his
election campaign for house
president in October. "My plat
form was that I'd be king, not
president." he explained.
He steadfastly refuses to re
gret his decision not to join
his roommate and others last
night in the traditional guard
ing of the telephone poles in
Lake Lagunita. "I just didn't
have time to go to the bonfire
and study German," he said.
Having skipped Wednesday's
class, he was apprehensive
about Thursday's 8 a.m. session.
Caruthers and his roommate
Larry Connors burned candles
frequently; "three or four a
day." Both the candles and the
Michelog bottles come from the
Wilbur dinner tables, Caruthers
says. In fact, King Caruthers
helped spread the fad of candle
burning in Rinconada.
One Candle Freak-Out
When the room is darkened
and the glow of the candle flame
reflects in the smoked glass of
the bottle, "it looks re?lly pret
ty," Caruthers confided.
Usually he puts out the can
dles before going to sleep, but

this time he let the flame burn
while sleep interrupted his
study. He stretched out, fully
clothed but barefoot, on the
lower bunk of the tiny room's
bunkbeds. The candle on its
bottle rose about 18 inches high
right beside him.
Sometime after 5 a.m., as
weary Rinconada men straggled
back from the telephone poles,
the candle lost its perpendicu
larity. "I assume I just rolled
over and kicked it," Caruthers
pondered.
Tries To Save Pic^colo
His first reaction was fear. "If
you wake up and see your room
burning down, you're scared,"
he explained cogently. "All my
clothes were in there, and my
flute. It's a sterling silver pic
colo, handmade in Elkhart, In
diana. I play it in the band."
So Caruthers' next impulse
was to somehow put out the
fire, which had reached bed
spreads hung decoratively from
the ceiling, and was moving
rapidly over the rug toward an
old upholstered chair. Caruthers
leaped off the burning mattress
and started to stomp out the
fire with his bare feet.
After a few frantic moments
he grabbed a woolen blanket
and tried to smother some
smoldering towels, and he
burned his hands in the process.
As the room filled with smoke,
Caruthers, at bay, pulled down
one of the blazing bedspreads
from the ceiling and ran out
the door.
Helmke Suspects
When sponsor Jim Helmke,
returning from the water foun
tain, saw Caruthers run out
of his room in what he called
"a kind of controlled panic,"
clutching a burning bedspread,
dropping fiery embers and let
ting clouds of gray smoke into
the hall, he thought something
was amiss.
Caruthers grabbed a soda
acid fire extinguisher off the
wall and ran back to the room,
Helmke close behind. Still un
aware of his burns, Caruthers
tried to put out the fire.
"I couldn't breathe in all that
smoke," he recalled later. "I

ran out and Jim grabbed the ex
tinguisher and ran in."
In a few moments Helmke
had put out the fire, perhaps
15 minutes after the candle had
lost its perpendicularity.
When asked later how he en
dured the smoke which over
came Caruthers. Helmke replied
thoughtfully, "Well, it sure
didn't smell very good. There
were foam rubber pillows and
things burning."
Helmke called the fire depart
ment after the flames were ex
tinguished. During the frantic
fire it hadn't oceured to Helmke
or Caruthers to pull a fire
alarm, and the fire marshal ex
pressed his displeasure at their
omission.
Meanwhile Caruthers went
back into the room and put on
his sneakers and socks, still not
realizing the extent of his
burns. But before the fire mar
shal arrived he went up to
Helmke and confided, "I burned
the dickens out of my foot."
(Caruthers did not say 'dick

aware of his burns, Caruthers
tried to put out the fire.
"I couldn't breathe in all that
smoke," he recalled later. "I

ran out and Jim grabbed the ex
tinguisher and ran in."
In a few moments Helmke
had put out the fire, perhaps
15 minutes after the candle had
lost its perpendicularity.
When asked later how he en
dured the smoke which over
came Caruthers. Helmke replied
thoughtfully, "Well, it sure
didn't smell very good. There
were foam rubber pillows and
things burning."
Helmke called the fire depart
ment after the flames were ex
tinguished. During the frantic
fire it hadn't oceured to Helmke
or Caruthers to pull a fire
alarm, and the fire marshal ex
pressed his displeasure at their
omission.
Meanwhile Caruthers went
back into the room and put on
his sneakers and socks, still not
realizing the extent of his
burns. But before the fire mar
shal arrived he went up to
Helmke and confided, "I burned
the dickens out of my foot."
(Caruthers did not say 'dick
ens.' )
Soak It Where?
Helmke says he advised Car
uthers to go soak it in a toilet
bowl, this being the closest de
pository of cool water. Just then
the fire marshal arrived, or
dered Caruthers to remove his
shoe, and looked at the foot. He
decided Caruthers should re
ceive treatment, so Caruthers
put the shoe back on and limped
off to Cowell.
After he "almost passed out"
from a sudden onrush of pain,
Caruthers had his hands and
right foot immersed in ice
water by health center nurses
before the burns were dressed
yesterday morning.
Caruthers hadn't spent more
than an hour of his convales
cence at Cowell before his first
visitor arrived. The visitor was
n't a girl friend or Wilbur
friend, however; he was Santa
Clara Deputy Fire Marshall
Raymond G. Gamma, who ar
rived with the cheerful com
ment, "Little boys who play
with matches get burned." To
this, Caruthers only smiled.
A ten minute interview en

sued, during which Caruthers
confessed to Gamma "I'm
through with candles."
It's a shame Caruther's mat
tress lay directly on the floor,
because if it had been elevated
the usual few inches off the
ground he might not have
started the fire by knocking
over the candle with some move
ment of his body while asleep.
But two weeks ago Caruthers
and Collins had removed the
mattress from the frame and
set it down on the floor , be
cause Caruthers, who is 5' 10,"
kept bumping his head on the
springs of the matress above.
And the two freshmen had to
have a bunkbed arrangement,
because the 8' by 16' room
couldn't hold two separate beds.
Caruthers was roused grog
gilv from sleep by the heat of
his* mattress and rug. A lire cap
tain later commented that Car
uthers probably awoke just in
time to avoid asphyxiation in
the smoky room.
Freshman Laird Caruthers
decided not to guard the bon
fire last night. That's why he
got burned.
While Caruthers stayed in his
room and studied German into
the early hours of the morning,
almost everyone else in Rincon
ada house of Wilbur trooped off
to a 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. shift
guarding the telephone poles
erected as a framework for to
day's bonfire.
Rinconada's second floor was
practically empty when Caruth
ers dozed off to sleep with a
candle burning brightly next to
his bed, dripping wax artfully
down the side of the Michelob
beer bottle that served as its
holder.
A few hours later fire had left
his room a scorched shambles
and Caruthers, having barely
escaped asphyxiation, slept un
der sedation at Cowell Health
Center with burns on his hands
and right foot.
It was to say the least, an un
conventional fire. Even for Wil

bur, which makes a cull of the
unusual.
Caruthers sustained some of
his burns when he leaped up
barefoot and tried to stomp out
the fire on his rug. He wanted
to rescue his piccolo.
The fire started because, in
directly, Wilbur is so jammed
with freshmen that two stu
dents were assigned to Caruth
ers' room, which was designed
as a single.
The blaze was extinguished
by a taciturn sponsor with a
Southern drawl who got chewed
out by a fire marshal for not
calling the fire department.
And the aftermath promises
to be a vigilant campaign to
sweep Wilbur clean of candle
burning.
Caruthers himself takes the
episode in stride. His burns are
minor and he will be released
from Cowell in a few days.
Rinconada HKing'?
A 17-year-old from Loomis,
Calif., with curly black hair and
sideburns, Caruthers has had
the nickname "King" since his
election campaign for house
president in October. "My plat
form was that I'd be king, not
president." he explained.
He steadfastly refuses to re
gret his decision not to join
his roommate and others last
night in the traditional guard
ing of the telephone poles in
Lake Lagunita. "I just didn't
have time to go to the bonfire
and study German," he said.
Having skipped Wednesday's
class, he was apprehensive
about Thursday's 8 a.m. session.
Caruthers and his roommate
Larry Connors burned candles
frequently; "three or four a
day." Both the candles and the
Michelog bottles come from the
Wilbur dinner tables, Caruthers
says. In fact, King Caruthers
helped spread the fad of candle
burning in Rinconada.
One Candle Freak-Out
When the room is darkened
and the glow of the candle flame
reflects in the smoked glass of
the bottle, "it looks re?lly pret
ty," Caruthers confided.
Usually he puts out the can
dles before going to sleep, but

this time he let the flame burn
while sleep interrupted his
study. He stretched out, fully
clothed but barefoot, on the
lower bunk of the tiny room's
bunkbeds. The candle on its
bottle rose about 18 inches high
right beside him.
Sometime after 5 a.m., as
weary Rinconada men straggled
back from the telephone poles,
the candle lost its perpendicu
larity. "I assume I just rolled
over and kicked it," Caruthers
pondered.
Tries To Save Pic^colo
His first reaction was fear. "If
you wake up and see your room
burning down, you're scared,"
he explained cogently. "All my
clothes were in there, and my
flute. It's a sterling silver pic
colo, handmade in Elkhart, In
diana. I play it in the band."
So Caruthers' next impulse
was to somehow put out the
fire, which had reached bed
spreads hung decoratively from
the ceiling, and was moving
rapidly over the rug toward an
old upholstered chair. Caruthers
leaped off the burning mattress
and started to stomp out the
fire with his bare feet.
After a few frantic moments
he grabbed a woolen blanket
and tried to smother some
smoldering towels, and he
burned his hands in the process.
As the room filled with smoke,
Caruthers, at bay, pulled down
one of the blazing bedspreads
from the ceiling and ran out
the door.
Helmke Suspects
When sponsor Jim Helmke,
returning from the water foun
tain, saw Caruthers run out
of his room in what he called
"a kind of controlled panic,"
clutching a burning bedspread,
dropping fiery embers and let
ting clouds of gray smoke into
the hall, he thought something
was amiss.
Caruthers grabbed a soda
acid fire extinguisher off the
wall and ran back to the room,
Helmke close behind. Still un
aware of his burns, Caruthers
tried to put out the fire.
"I couldn't breathe in all that
smoke," he recalled later. "I

ran out and Jim grabbed the ex

was to somehow put out the
fire, which had reached bed
spreads hung decoratively from
the ceiling, and was moving
rapidly over the rug toward an
old upholstered chair. Caruthers
leaped off the burning mattress
and started to stomp out the
fire with his bare feet.
After a few frantic moments
he grabbed a woolen blanket
and tried to smother some
smoldering towels, and he
burned his hands in the process.
As the room filled with smoke,
Caruthers, at bay, pulled down
one of the blazing bedspreads
from the ceiling and ran out
the door.
Helmke Suspects
When sponsor Jim Helmke,
returning from the water foun
tain, saw Caruthers run out
of his room in what he called
"a kind of controlled panic,"
clutching a burning bedspread,
dropping fiery embers and let
ting clouds of gray smoke into
the hall, he thought something
was amiss.
Caruthers grabbed a soda
acid fire extinguisher off the
wall and ran back to the room,
Helmke close behind. Still un
aware of his burns, Caruthers
tried to put out the fire.
"I couldn't breathe in all that
smoke," he recalled later. "I

ran out and Jim grabbed the ex
tinguisher and ran in."
In a few moments Helmke
had put out the fire, perhaps
15 minutes after the candle had
lost its perpendicularity.
When asked later how he en
dured the smoke which over
came Caruthers. Helmke replied
thoughtfully, "Well, it sure
didn't smell very good. There
were foam rubber pillows and
things burning."
Helmke called the fire depart
ment after the flames were ex
tinguished. During the frantic
fire it hadn't oceured to Helmke
or Caruthers to pull a fire
alarm, and the fire marshal ex
pressed his displeasure at their
omission.
Meanwhile Caruthers went
back into the room and put on
his sneakers and socks, still not
realizing the extent of his
burns. But before the fire mar
shal arrived he went up to
Helmke and confided, "I burned
the dickens out of my foot."
(Caruthers did not say 'dick
ens.' )
Soak It Where?
Helmke says he advised Car
uthers to go soak it in a toilet
bowl, this being the closest de
pository of cool water. Just then
the fire marshal arrived, or
dered Caruthers to remove his
shoe, and looked at the foot. He
decided Caruthers should re
ceive treatment, so Caruthers
put the shoe back on and limped
off to Cowell.
After he "almost passed out"
from a sudden onrush of pain,
Caruthers had his hands and
right foot immersed in ice
water by health center nurses
before the burns were dressed
yesterday morning.
Caruthers hadn't spent more
than an hour of his convales
cence at Cowell before his first
visitor arrived. The visitor was
n't a girl friend or Wilbur
friend, however; he was Santa
Clara Deputy Fire Marshall
Raymond G. Gamma, who ar
rived with the cheerful com
ment, "Little boys who play
with matches get burned." To
this, Caruthers only smiled.
A ten minute interview en

sued, during which Caruthers
confessed to Gamma "I'm
through with candles."
It's a shame Caruther's mat
tress lay directly on the floor,
because if it had been elevated
the usual few inches off the
ground he might not have
started the fire by knocking
over the candle with some move
ment of his body while asleep.
But two weeks ago Caruthers
and Collins had removed the
mattress from the frame and
set it down on the floor , be
cause Caruthers, who is 5' 10,"
kept bumping his head on the
springs of the matress above.
And the two freshmen had to
have a bunkbed arrangement,
because the 8' by 16' room
couldn't hold two separate beds.
Caruthers was roused grog
gilv from sleep by the heat of
his* mattress and rug. A lire cap
tain later commented that Car
uthers probably awoke just in
time to avoid asphyxiation in
the smoky room.
