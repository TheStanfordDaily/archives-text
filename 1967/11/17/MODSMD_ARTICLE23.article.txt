# 'The Leland Stanford Jr. University Marching Band'
## 
### PETER BALDO 
The sign on the door says it's
the East Douglas Summer Home
tract. One girl thinks its more
fun to watch than a football
game. It's called Music 161 c, but
no music major will get near it.
But to its members it's the In
comparable L e 1 a n d Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band, one of the dwindling re
positories of anti-intellectualism
on the Stanford campus.
This year's band has been
more enthusiastically received
than those of past years. Fans
like its contemporary music, its

informal uniforms, and its hang
loose style.
"It's got more class than any
band I've ever seen," says one
student. Another adds, "It's the
only band I know that doesn't
march like an army."
Girls In The Band
While the band is officially an
all-male organization, it claims
Stanford's five pom-pon girls as
de facto members. The girls re
hearse with the band, and per
form in its pre-game and half
time shows.
Both groups seem to like each
other. "They're really good,"
says one band member, "they

add a hell of a lot." The girls,
too, bubble with compliments: "I
think the band's pretty careful
about not grossing us out," says
Sue Phillips, "We love it."
According to Doug Rosene,
the band's student manager, the
band concentrates its greatest
effort on "putting out a good
sound," rather than on precision
marching.
All of the band's music is ar
ranged by director Arthur
Barnes and his assistant, Fred
Barry. Halftime shows, rallies,
and special events are planned
and executed by the student
staff.

Barnes calls this year's group
"the best band I've ever had."
When he came to Stanford from
Fresno State College in 1963, the
band had only 90 members; now
it has 120.
Best Rah-Rah Around
Although the band is officially
a part of the music department,
it buys its uniforms and pays
its travel expenses with money
from the department of athlet
ics. Each year the band travels
to Los Angeles for either the
UCLA or the USC football game.
More extensive travel is ruled
out by a lack of funds.
The band rehearses Monday
afternoon in its ancient green
snack and Wednesday night,
Friday afternoon, and Saturday
morning on the football practice
fields. Members can choose be
tween one unit of academic or
activity credit for the course.
If there is a single unifying
force in the band, it seems to be
the desire to have fun. "It's the
only rah-rah group that's worth
rah-rahing with," says a senior
history major. Drum Major
Chris Canny enjoys "just going
to a game and blowing your
mind." "Academics is just out
there," he says. "We have noth
ing to do with it."
The Inflammable Shack
The shack, according to its oc
cupants, celebrated its 69th
birthday this year. Built in 1898.
it stood at the present site of
Hoover Tower, where it was
called the Stanford Inn. Around
1916 it was moved to its present
location beside the men's gym,
and taken over by the band.
According to Barnes, the band
is hoping to have a new shack
built near its rehearsal fields. It
has been looking for a new head
quarters since the early Twen
ties, when the building was first
condemned as a fire trap.
The condemnation has never

been lifted, and some fear that
Cal might burn the structure
during Big Game Week when
students are sleeping inside as
guards. Says one member,
"This'll burn down in two min
utes, I'm sure."
As a spirit-oriented subculture
in a "community of scholars,"
the band beels itself increasing
ly isolated. Says Carry, "Nobody
else cares about spirit."
More Spirit Than Axe Comm
Feeling is especially bitter
towards Axe Comm, which has
recently denounced .R.F.'s, and
which had made little effort to

organize rallies, or retrieve the
stolen axe.
"They're supposed to be a
spirit organization," says one
band member, "but the only
thing they care about is their
own parties."
Axe Comm head Dick Roth
admits that his organization
isn't as spirited as the band, but
adds, "You can't beat the band
for spirit."
The band is also plagued by a
lack of contact with the football
team. Many members feel that,
while they play ultimately for
the team, they do not know what

the players like or dislike. "I
don't know if they even hear the
yells or the music," comments
sophomore Carl Muller.
The football players are gen
erally uncritical, though, with
feelings ranging from apathy to
mild appreciation. Says halfback
Howard Williams, "It's a real
fine band. It really makes us feel
good."
Jack Root, however, barely no
tices it: "You're busy thinking
about your personal problems,"
he says, "Whether the band's
playing or not is fairly irrele
vant."

STANFORD-AT-BERKKLKY — Apparently unsatisfied with the rallies in White; Plaza, Stanford's

The Inflammable Shack
The shack, according to its oc
cupants, celebrated its 69th
birthday this year. Built in 1898.
it stood at the present site of
Hoover Tower, where it was
called the Stanford Inn. Around
1916 it was moved to its present
location beside the men's gym,
and taken over by the band.
According to Barnes, the band
is hoping to have a new shack
built near its rehearsal fields. It
has been looking for a new head
quarters since the early Twen
ties, when the building was first
condemned as a fire trap.
The condemnation has never

been lifted, and some fear that
Cal might burn the structure
during Big Game Week when
students are sleeping inside as
guards. Says one member,
"This'll burn down in two min
utes, I'm sure."
As a spirit-oriented subculture
in a "community of scholars,"
the band beels itself increasing
ly isolated. Says Carry, "Nobody
else cares about spirit."
More Spirit Than Axe Comm
Feeling is especially bitter
towards Axe Comm, which has
recently denounced .R.F.'s, and
which had made little effort to

organize rallies, or retrieve the
stolen axe.
"They're supposed to be a
spirit organization," says one
band member, "but the only
thing they care about is their
own parties."
Axe Comm head Dick Roth
admits that his organization
isn't as spirited as the band, but
adds, "You can't beat the band
for spirit."
The band is also plagued by a
lack of contact with the football
team. Many members feel that,
while they play ultimately for
the team, they do not know what

the players like or dislike. "I
don't know if they even hear the
yells or the music," comments
sophomore Carl Muller.
The football players are gen
erally uncritical, though, with
feelings ranging from apathy to
mild appreciation. Says halfback
Howard Williams, "It's a real
fine band. It really makes us feel
good."
Jack Root, however, barely no
tices it: "You're busy thinking
about your personal problems,"
he says, "Whether the band's
playing or not is fairly irrele

Game performance to the strains of the Incomparable Leland Stanford Junior

STANFORD-AT-BERKKLKY — Apparently unsatisfied with the rallies in White; Plaza, Stanford's
marching band put in a little overtime yesterday when it serenaded Berkeley students on the steps
of Sproul Hall. Indian cheerleaders and dollies were on hand too, and the performance in enemy ter
ritory drew quite a crowd.

The sign on the door says it's
the East Douglas Summer Home
tract. One girl thinks its more
fun to watch than a football
game. It's called Music 161 c, but
no music major will get near it.
But to its members it's the In
comparable L e 1 a n d Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band, one of the dwindling re
positories of anti-intellectualism
on the Stanford campus.
This year's band has been
more enthusiastically received
than those of past years. Fans
like its contemporary music, its

informal uniforms, and its hang
loose style.
"It's got more class than any
band I've ever seen," says one
student. Another adds, "It's the
only band I know that doesn't
march like an army."
Girls In The Band
While the band is officially an
all-male organization, it claims
Stanford's five pom-pon girls as
de facto members. The girls re
hearse with the band, and per
form in its pre-game and half
time shows.
Both groups seem to like each
other. "They're really good,"
says one band member, "they

add a hell of a lot." The girls,
too, bubble with compliments: "I
think the band's pretty careful
about not grossing us out," says
Sue Phillips, "We love it."
According to Doug Rosene,
the band's student manager, the
band concentrates its greatest
effort on "putting out a good
sound," rather than on precision
marching.
All of the band's music is ar
ranged by director Arthur
Barnes and his assistant, Fred
Barry. Halftime shows, rallies,
and special events are planned
and executed by the student
staff.

Barnes calls this year's group
"the best band I've ever had."
When he came to Stanford from
Fresno State College in 1963, the
band had only 90 members; now
it has 120.
Best Rah-Rah Around
Although the band is officially
a part of the music department,
it buys its uniforms and pays
its travel expenses with money
from the department of athlet
ics. Each year the band travels
to Los Angeles for either the
UCLA or the USC football game.
More extensive travel is ruled
out by a lack of funds.
The band rehearses Monday
afternoon in its ancient green
snack and Wednesday night,
Friday afternoon, and Saturday
morning on the football practice
fields. Members can choose be
tween one unit of academic or
activity credit for the course.
If there is a single unifying
force in the band, it seems to be
the desire to have fun. "It's the
only rah-rah group that's worth
rah-rahing with," says a senior
history major. Drum Major
Chris Canny enjoys "just going

ritory drew quite a crowd.

The sign on the door says it's
the East Douglas Summer Home
tract. One girl thinks its more
fun to watch than a football
game. It's called Music 161 c, but
no music major will get near it.
But to its members it's the In
comparable L e 1 a n d Stanford
Junior University Marching
Band, one of the dwindling re
positories of anti-intellectualism
on the Stanford campus.
This year's band has been
more enthusiastically received
than those of past years. Fans
like its contemporary music, its

informal uniforms, and its hang
loose style.
"It's got more class than any
band I've ever seen," says one
student. Another adds, "It's the
only band I know that doesn't
march like an army."
Girls In The Band
While the band is officially an
all-male organization, it claims
Stanford's five pom-pon girls as
de facto members. The girls re
hearse with the band, and per
form in its pre-game and half
time shows.
Both groups seem to like each
other. "They're really good,"
says one band member, "they

add a hell of a lot." The girls,
too, bubble with compliments: "I
think the band's pretty careful
about not grossing us out," says
Sue Phillips, "We love it."
According to Doug Rosene,
the band's student manager, the
band concentrates its greatest
effort on "putting out a good
sound," rather than on precision
marching.
All of the band's music is ar
ranged by director Arthur
Barnes and his assistant, Fred
Barry. Halftime shows, rallies,
and special events are planned
and executed by the student
staff.

Barnes calls this year's group
"the best band I've ever had."
When he came to Stanford from
Fresno State College in 1963, the
band had only 90 members; now
it has 120.
Best Rah-Rah Around
Although the band is officially
a part of the music department,
it buys its uniforms and pays
its travel expenses with money
from the department of athlet
ics. Each year the band travels
to Los Angeles for either the
UCLA or the USC football game.
More extensive travel is ruled
out by a lack of funds.
The band rehearses Monday
afternoon in its ancient green
snack and Wednesday night,
Friday afternoon, and Saturday
morning on the football practice
fields. Members can choose be
tween one unit of academic or
activity credit for the course.
If there is a single unifying
force in the band, it seems to be
the desire to have fun. "It's the
only rah-rah group that's worth
rah-rahing with," says a senior
history major. Drum Major
Chris Canny enjoys "just going
to a game and blowing your
mind." "Academics is just out
there," he says. "We have noth
ing to do with it."
The Inflammable Shack
The shack, according to its oc
cupants, celebrated its 69th
birthday this year. Built in 1898.
it stood at the present site of
Hoover Tower, where it was
called the Stanford Inn. Around
1916 it was moved to its present
location beside the men's gym,
and taken over by the band.
According to Barnes, the band
is hoping to have a new shack
built near its rehearsal fields. It
has been looking for a new head
quarters since the early Twen
ties, when the building was first
condemned as a fire trap.
The condemnation has never

been lifted, and some fear that
Cal might burn the structure
during Big Game Week when
students are sleeping inside as
guards. Says one member,
"This'll burn down in two min
utes, I'm sure."
As a spirit-oriented subculture
in a "community of scholars,"
the band beels itself increasing
ly isolated. Says Carry, "Nobody
else cares about spirit."
More Spirit Than Axe Comm
Feeling is especially bitter
towards Axe Comm, which has
recently denounced .R.F.'s, and
which had made little effort to

organize rallies, or retrieve the
stolen axe.
"They're supposed to be a
spirit organization," says one
band member, "but the only
thing they care about is their
own parties."
Axe Comm head Dick Roth
admits that his organization
isn't as spirited as the band, but
adds, "You can't beat the band
for spirit."
The band is also plagued by a
lack of contact with the football
team. Many members feel that,
while they play ultimately for
the team, they do not know what

the players like or dislike. "I
don't know if they even hear the
yells or the music," comments
sophomore Carl Muller.
The football players are gen
erally uncritical, though, with
feelings ranging from apathy to
mild appreciation. Says halfback
Howard Williams, "It's a real
fine band. It really makes us feel
good."
Jack Root, however, barely no
tices it: "You're busy thinking
about your personal problems,"
he says, "Whether the band's
playing or not is fairly irrele
vant."
