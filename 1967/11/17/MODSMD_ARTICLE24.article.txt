Aspirin Please, Anybody. Mr.
Eliot? William James?
The contemporary American
theater suffers from failure, in
ability or unwillingness to dis
tinguish between the stage and
the pulpit. Peter Ustinov's anti
war harangue in The Unknown
Soldier and Ifis Wife has one
quality: it can make a war-mon
ger out of a pacifist. In like man
ner, William James' production
of Murder in the Cathedral only
served to strongly re-affirm my
reasons for skipping Sunday ser
vices. This might not have been
a criticism were it not that both
seemed to have set out to
achieve the opposite effect.
Perhaps the simplest indict
ment of James' production lies
in a quote from his "Director's
Note" on the back of the play
bill: "We hope you share our
enthusiasm for his (Eliot's)
work. We hope you benefit — if
it applies — from his castiga
tion." And so one sits it out, for
two hours at the Lifeboat Thea
tre of the University of Santa
Clara being castigated for no
apparent reason except that
Thomas Beckett, Archbishop of
Canterbury, was murdered by
four knights long, long ago—in
December 1170 — and far, far
away in good old England.
Wrong Setting
The attractive atmosphere of
the Lifeboat Theatre (it might
have been converted from an old
warehouse), though ideal for a
Shakespeare or a contemporary
avant-garde, was not the right
setting for Murder in the Cathe
dral. Written in 1935, on order
for the Canterbury Festival, this
historical play, which re-enacts
the famous story of the murder
of the Archbishop, is an exer
cise in verse aimed at evoking
the knd of grandeur appropriate
for the occasion and relevant

only within the limitations of
conventional religion. This would
suggest a chapel or church set
ting for both stage and audito
rium, since the play needs every
element of Christian ritual to
help carry it through. The skele
tal settings that may very well
have been a carry-over from the
California Shakespeare Festival
worked against the overly con
scious attempt by every member
of the cast, except the chorus, to
be grand. Joseph Glasner, as
Thomas Becket, was so success
ful in his pomp factually so con
scious of the beauty of his
stance and pose) that he failed
to come off, and left the con
trary impression of being a fake
archbishop courting martyrdom.
This made particularly farcical
his denouncement of martyr
dom:
"A martyr, a saint, is always
made by the design of God. A
martyr is never the design of
man; for the true martyr is he
who has become the instrument
of God. The martyr no longer
desires anything for himself, not
even the glory of martyrdom."
This could have been funny
except that here and throughout
the entire performance, the cast
seemed determined not to allow
the literally captive audience a
laugh. It demanded a sobriety
and patient devotion which can
only be expected of God's se
lected few.
Too Much Meaning-
Friday night's performance
suffered from another plague
that seems to have crippled
American drama and intellec
tualism in general. Since Freud,
there has developed a cancer of
reading meaning into even the
most trivial, accidental behavior
or remark. This has reached the
tragic state of blinding us to the
beauty and profundity often in- 1

herent in simplicity. Consequent
ly the arts are splattered all
over with the ugliest lumps of
Freudian innuendoes.
In the theater the result has
been an overwhelming search
for profundity between any pair
of even the commonest casual
remarks. This is anathema to
the aesthetics of the art itself.
Thus the cast concentrates on
acting the interpretation of the
play rather than the play itself,
which is precisely what the gen
tlemen of the University of San
ta Clara did on Friday. Faithful
to the commitment to castigate
the audience, carefully implied
in the playbill, actor after actor
took the stage to shout out his
harangue at the poor audience.
Results? The stage was—
All hands and no hands
All screams and no screams
All acting and no life
All interpretation and no
meaning
All efficiency and no drama
Being and only partly being.
Headache and Boredom
The declamations of the
Knights (as Tempters) and the
retorts of the Archbishop were
delivered in one continuous
stream of shouts — loud, monot
onous, ceaseless, and, of course,
inartistic. This and the director's
harsh design not even to allow

an intermission to catch one's
breath, had its total effect — a
simple, solid, nagging headache.
The use of chorus constituted
a major structural flaw in the
script, and the production only
provided it the coup de grace.
The effective use of a chorus
whether by the Greeks or by its
revivors in later centuries de
pends mainly on its quality of
making the play progress. Any
element in a play which does not
help the action move forward,
nor embellish the mood, atmos
phere or evocative effect of the
piece is a liability to the play.
T. S. Eliot's chorus was redun
dant. For a simple play with a
simple plot and a simple mean
ing, the chorus, except for the
opening minutes, had the sole
effect of boring one with an in
terpretation or a journalistic re
portage of the obvious effects
that had only just been staged
a few seconds before.
On the director's part, the dis
tribution of the choral lines be
tween charming ladies with neu
tral vf ices only made the lines
difficult to follow and reminded
one strongly (and underisably
so) of poetry recitation in gram
mar school where everyone took
a line in turn. In fact, the dic
tion throughout the play was
tedious and monotonous, per
haps it was too studied. The
same is true of all the acting.
Too Strained
Perhaps what Mr. James needs
to make his production come off
is an American colloquialism,
"Take it easy." The cast will
benefit from being more re
laxed; the play stands to gain

from the .seme, and the audience
should be grateful for being
spared the headache, literally.
Murder In the Cathedral is a
sweet charming little piece of
religious pagaentry in verse,
and it should be performed as
such, even if it was written by
T. S. Eliot. As poetry, it might
be otherwise, but that is an
other matter. The play itself is
not particularly profound (not
when for the present day it says,
"Destiny waits in the hands of
God, not in the hands of states
men"). And this need not neces
sarily be a criticism of the play,
were it not the overwhelming
determination of the production
to state otherwise.
With such a compulsive em
phasis on profundity the produc
tion of Peter Weiss' Marat/Sade
by the same group, slated for
May next year, could be disas
trous.
Murder in the Cathedral con
tinues at the Lifeboat Theater
Nov. 17, 18, 19; 8:15 p.m., and
should be seen if only as a case
study of the fact that efficiency
and sheer scholarship are not
sufficient to make good drama.
Nor sermons either. Though one
must admit the validity of the
corollary that much drama is in
fact acted every Sunday in the
pulpit throughout the Christian
world.
