## 
### 
While Undersecretary of State
Nicholas Katzenbach is bringing
the Stanford community a mes
sage of concern in his address
this afternoon, those in the Tres
idder Large Lounge will be hear
ing a different, perhaps more
significant message. John Fahey
will be performing.
John Fahey is an unknown
genius. He plays the guitar as
few others play it; his composi
tions have a distinctive style
which makes them instantly
recognizable.
His message is personal. No
two listeners will have the same
reaction to a Fahey composition,
but all listeners will be aware
that they have been confronted
with an honest, weirdly beauti
ful expression of human emo
tion.
Fahey is a unique individual.
The themes of his music vary
from southern blues to mysti
cism. Her personality is reflect
ed in his subdued stage presence
and in the intensity with which
he concentrates on his playing.
There is an inscrutable qual
ity in John Fahey and his mu
sic — something beyond his ap
pearance and his talent. It is
something which almost invar
iably leaves the listener with the
idea that he has experienced
something very relevant — more
relevant, perhaps, than the tem
poral message of an Undersec
retary of State.
