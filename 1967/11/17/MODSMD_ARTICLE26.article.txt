A new theater has opened in San Francisco, the Gateway
Cinema (Jackson and Battery), and is presenting the Japanese
film version of Chushingura. Chushingura dramatizes an histor
ical event familiar to all Japanese, the Incident of the 47 Rohin.
In Tokugawa, Japan a small daimyc was forced to commit sui
cide because he drew his sword and wounded a shogunal offi
cial Forty-seven of his rohin vowed to avenge his death They
scattered; many abandoned their old lives; and, finally, after
two years regrouped and killed the official. Although the public
generally supported them, they too were forced to eventually
commit suicide.
Chushingura has been a popular subject of artists for over
300 years, but some say the film version is the finest represen
tation yet. Made to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the
giant Toho film production company, Chushingura is a giant
3y 2 hour, color extravaganza. Directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, the
film stars Toshiro Mifune, Koshivo Matsumoto, Yuzo Tsukasa,
Chusha Ickikawa, and a cast of thousands, as they say.

GUITAR RECITAL — FAHEY IN HIS OWN WRITE
from Notes to "The Transfiguration of Blind Joe Death."
"JOHN FAHEY, I presume?"
Blankly. "All is ichthyological in design, if not in intent."
The young man was speechless with horror, for FAHEY was
completely and utterly mad!
★ ★ ★
Slowly FAHEY turned and got his guitar and gently caressed
the dagger to the strings. As the dagger slid up and down the
fretboard the room was suddenly filled with a warmth, a radi
ance which permeated to the very depths of the young man's
being. It spoke of suffering and of love, and of the humility and
strength of the downtrodden Volk of Takoma Park. It bore wit
ness to 300 years of tragedy and torment, and yet above all it
was a hymn of affirmation, a paean of praise stemming from
that which is most human in all of us. And when, towards the
end, he quickened the tempo, the room came alive to the driving,
surging, forceful, and pounding rhythm, and to the acidulous,
corrosive, smoldering and rough-hewn tonal quality of the music.
★ ★ ★
As the weeks rolled on and on the youth had plenty of time
to ponder his predicament, for he too had been engaged. He had
found JOHN FAHEY, and, perhaps of more significance, he had
come upon a conspiracy to subjugate the inhabiated universe.

GUITAR RECITAL — FAHEY IN HIS OWN WRITE
from Notes to "The Transfiguration of Blind Joe Death."
"JOHN FAHEY, I presume?"
Blankly. "All is ichthyological in design, if not in intent."
The young man was speechless with horror, for FAHEY was
completely and utterly mad!
★ ★ ★
Slowly FAHEY turned and got his guitar and gently caressed
the dagger to the strings. As the dagger slid up and down the
fretboard the room was suddenly filled with a warmth, a radi
ance which permeated to the very depths of the young man's
being. It spoke of suffering and of love, and of the humility and
strength of the downtrodden Volk of Takoma Park. It bore wit
ness to 300 years of tragedy and torment, and yet above all it
was a hymn of affirmation, a paean of praise stemming from
that which is most human in all of us. And when, towards the
end, he quickened the tempo, the room came alive to the driving,
surging, forceful, and pounding rhythm, and to the acidulous,
corrosive, smoldering and rough-hewn tonal quality of the music.
★ ★ ★
As the weeks rolled on and on the youth had plenty of time
to ponder his predicament, for he too had been engaged. He had
found JOHN FAHEY, and, perhaps of more significance, he had
come upon a conspiracy to subjugate the inhabiated universe.
A new theater has opened in San Francisco, the Gateway
Cinema (Jackson and Battery), and is presenting the Japanese
film version of Chushingura. Chushingura dramatizes an histor
ical event familiar to all Japanese, the Incident of the 47 Rohin.
In Tokugawa, Japan a small daimyc was forced to commit sui
cide because he drew his sword and wounded a shogunal offi
cial Forty-seven of his rohin vowed to avenge his death They
scattered; many abandoned their old lives; and, finally, after
two years regrouped and killed the official. Although the public
generally supported them, they too were forced to eventually
commit suicide.
Chushingura has been a popular subject of artists for over
300 years, but some say the film version is the finest represen
tation yet. Made to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the
giant Toho film production company, Chushingura is a giant
3y 2 hour, color extravaganza. Directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, the
film stars Toshiro Mifune, Koshivo Matsumoto, Yuzo Tsukasa,
Chusha Ickikawa, and a cast of thousands, as they say.

surging, forceful, and pounding rhythm, and to the acidulous,
corrosive, smoldering and rough-hewn tonal quality of the music.

As the weeks rolled on and on the youth had plenty of time
to ponder his predicament, for he too had been engaged. He had
found JOHN FAHEY, and, perhaps of more significance, he had
come upon a conspiracy to subjugate the inhabiated universe.
A new theater has opened in San Francisco, the Gateway
Cinema (Jackson and Battery), and is presenting the Japanese
film version of Chushingura. Chushingura dramatizes an histor
ical event familiar to all Japanese, the Incident of the 47 Rohin.
In Tokugawa, Japan a small daimyc was forced to commit sui
cide because he drew his sword and wounded a shogunal offi
cial Forty-seven of his rohin vowed to avenge his death They
scattered; many abandoned their old lives; and, finally, after
two years regrouped and killed the official. Although the public
generally supported them, they too were forced to eventually
commit suicide.
Chushingura has been a popular subject of artists for over
300 years, but some say the film version is the finest represen
tation yet. Made to celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of the
giant Toho film production company, Chushingura is a giant
3y 2 hour, color extravaganza. Directed by Hiroshi Inagaki, the
film stars Toshiro Mifune, Koshivo Matsumoto, Yuzo Tsukasa,
Chusha Ickikawa, and a cast of thousands, as they say.

GUITAR RECITAL — FAHEY IN HIS OWN WRITE
from Notes to "The Transfiguration of Blind Joe Death."
"JOHN FAHEY, I presume?"
Blankly. "All is ichthyological in design, if not in intent."
The young man was speechless with horror, for FAHEY was
completely and utterly mad!
★ ★ ★
Slowly FAHEY turned and got his guitar and gently caressed
the dagger to the strings. As the dagger slid up and down the
fretboard the room was suddenly filled with a warmth, a radi
ance which permeated to the very depths of the young man's
being. It spoke of suffering and of love, and of the humility and
strength of the downtrodden Volk of Takoma Park. It bore wit
ness to 300 years of tragedy and torment, and yet above all it
was a hymn of affirmation, a paean of praise stemming from
that which is most human in all of us. And when, towards the
end, he quickened the tempo, the room came alive to the driving,
surging, forceful, and pounding rhythm, and to the acidulous,
corrosive, smoldering and rough-hewn tonal quality of the music.
