ting to play may matter
as ■, has wanting to win. Stan
ford has three injuries that

could seriously impair its his
tory-making efforts. The major
question left to the training
quarters is whether quarterback
Chuck Williams can play.
Ralston has kept his state
ments guarded about Williams'
availability to participate in the
carnage. He has maintained all
week that Mark Marquess will
start, but Williams will see ac
tion.
Williams, a transfer student
who missed his first Big Game
last year because of a dislocated
elbow, wants to play in the worst
way. The senior ouarterback has
been the catalyst to the Tribe
offense this season.
Flanker Gene Washington has
been hampered in practice this

week because of a muscle knot
in his thigh. The conference re
ceiving title is at stake in this
game as Washington trails Cal's
Wayne Stewart by only one
catch.
He is hungry for scoring
sprints after being held to only
one catch by Oregon's Jim Smith
last week, and there is no doubt
that he will ignore the charley
horse to compete.
In the backfield, Nate Kirtman
has been replaced by sophomore
Howie Williams, the Back of the
Game last week. Kirtman has
been limited by a nagging back
injury, but the powerful half
back also missed last year's
game and wants to compete very
badly.
