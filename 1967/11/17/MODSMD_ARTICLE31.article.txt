# WARS ARE MADE BY MEN
## 
### 
In a series of lectures delivered at Yale University in 1937, reknowned psy
chologist C. G. Jung took note ot the spiritual nature of man and the vital
importance of understanding the source of human conflicts by examining the
nature of man himself. He observed that wars would not exist if it were not
for the people who invent them:
k ■ all the incredible savagery going on in our so-called civilized
which is derived from human beings and their mental condition!
i ik 't the devilish means of destruction! They are invented by perfectly harm
less gentlemen, reasonable, respectable citizens, being all we hope to be. And
when the whole thing blows up and causes an indescribable inferno of devas
tation, nobody seems to be responsible. It simply occurs, yet it is all man made.
But since every person is blindly convinced that he is nothing but his very
modest and unimportant consciousness, which neatly fulfills duties and earns
a moderate living, nobody is aware that this whole rationally organized crowd,
calie." 1 a stote or a nation, is run by a seemingly impersonal, imperceptible but
ter 10 ver, checked by nobody and by nothing. This ghastly power is mostly
, v j, 8C ' ar of the neighboring nation, which is supposed to be possessed
by ~i malevolent devil. As nobody is capable of recognizing where and how
much ne himself is possessed and unconscious, one simply projects one s own
condition upon the neighbor, and thus it becomes a sacred duty to have the
gu.-u and the most poisonous gas."
The ancient Jewish prophet Jeremiah said much the same thing when he
said, .'The heart of man is deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt,
who • nble to understand it" (Jeremiah 17:9). The Bible says that war is a
rr>ji ot man's rejection of the God of Israel, our living Creator and the source
?f n true peace. Jeremiah's prayer is what our world needs to pray in this
da«k hour, O Lord, the hope of Israel, all who forsake thee shall be put to
shame, those who turn away from thee shall be written in the earth, for they
'orjaken the Lord, the fountain of living water. Heal me, O Lord, and I
3 healed; save me and I shall be saved, for thou art my praise .
The God of Israel is neither remote nor impersonal no indifferent to the
heart sickness of men His name is Jesus Christ. He is able to do something
obo t the war and hatred in your heart and mine.

rr>ji ot man's rejection of the God of Israel, our living Creator and the source
?f n true peace. Jeremiah's prayer is what our world needs to pray in this
da«k hour, O Lord, the hope of Israel, all who forsake thee shall be put to
shame, those who turn away from thee shall be written in the earth, for they
'orjaken the Lord, the fountain of living water. Heal me, O Lord, and I
3 healed; save me and I shall be saved, for thou art my praise .
The God of Israel is neither remote nor impersonal no indifferent to the
heart sickness of men His name is Jesus Christ. He is able to do something

In a series of lectures delivered at Yale University in 1937, reknowned psy
chologist C. G. Jung took note ot the spiritual nature of man and the vital
importance of understanding the source of human conflicts by examining the
nature of man himself. He observed that wars would not exist if it were not
for the people who invent them:
k ■ all the incredible savagery going on in our so-called civilized
which is derived from human beings and their mental condition!
i ik 't the devilish means of destruction! They are invented by perfectly harm
less gentlemen, reasonable, respectable citizens, being all we hope to be. And
when the whole thing blows up and causes an indescribable inferno of devas
tation, nobody seems to be responsible. It simply occurs, yet it is all man made.
But since every person is blindly convinced that he is nothing but his very
modest and unimportant consciousness, which neatly fulfills duties and earns
a moderate living, nobody is aware that this whole rationally organized crowd,
calie." 1 a stote or a nation, is run by a seemingly impersonal, imperceptible but

by ~i malevolent devil. As nobody is capable of recognizing where and how
much ne himself is possessed and unconscious, one simply projects one s own
condition upon the neighbor, and thus it becomes a sacred duty to have the
gu.-u and the most poisonous gas."
The ancient Jewish prophet Jeremiah said much the same thing when he
said, .'The heart of man is deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt,
who • nble to understand it" (Jeremiah 17:9). The Bible says that war is a
