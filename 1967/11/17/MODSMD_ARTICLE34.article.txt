# Poloists Try Harder--Now They're No. 2
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford water poloists beat
San Jose State, 8-7, Wednesday
to nail down the nation's second
ranking. Captain Gary Sheerer
hit three goals and threw three
assists to avenge an 8-4 loss to
the Spartans in San Jose's pool
early this season.
San Jose had a chance for the
number two spot with a victory
over Stanford, but the Spartans
wound up fourth behind Cal,

Stanford and undefeated UCLA.
Cal beat San Jose twice, and
Stanford knocked off Cal twice.
Kink Kong:
Stanford broke into the lead
early in the game as John Park
er fired in an 8 yard shot. Pete
Siebert took a pass from Sheerer
E.nd put Stanford's second goal
on the board. After San Jose
converted on a penalty shot, Sie
bert broke free and plugged in
his second goal of the quarter.

San Jose goalie Bob Likins
put down what appeared to be
the makings of a Stanford rout
as he blocked two successive In
dian penalty shots.
Parker rifled a half court blast
into the San Jose cage to start
the second quarter. Stanford's
4-1 lead gurgled down the drain
as San Jose's offensive power
shooters rocked in three goals.
Pan Am team member Greg
Hind hit the tying goal.

Sheerer socked a backhand
shot over Likins' head, and
Mark Parmely hit on a penalty
throw for a 6-4 Stanford half
time lead.
The third quarter saw many
fouls and two San Jose scores.
Dennis Belli scored and Hind hit
a penalty throw. Aggressive de
fense in the thi r d period
spawned the fouls that would
eventually cost four Spartans
and three Indians a trip to the
bench.
Sheerer hit a penalty shot to
break the fourth quarter tie.
With two minutes left, Sheerer
broke off his guard and drove
home the winning goal on a lob
shot. San Jose scored once more

before the final gun, but Stan
ford held the one goal margin.
Goalie's Day
Both Likins and Stanford
goalie Bob Momsen made 10
saves in the hard shooting con
test.
Stanford did not use the fast
breaking offense in their first
encounter with San Jose this
season. The Spartans used a
sloughing defense perfectly in
the cramped quarters of San
Jose's shallow end pool to stifle
any Indian movement.
Since then, Stanford coach
Jim Gaughran abandoned the

hole post offense and switched
to a full bore fast break. With
nearly twice as much room to
work with, Stanford speed may
have proved the difference.
Gaughan had special praise
for John Parker, "who just kept
driving and kept up offensive
pressure despite an unbelievable
number of fouls committed
against him."
Frosh Rally
The Stanford freshmen downed
San Jose's frosh for the second
time this season, breaking from
a 3-3 halftime deadlock to a 13-8
victory. Ray Collins, heads-up
on both offense and defense, hit

five scores for the Papooses.
Mitch Ivey also hammered in
five goals.
San Jose's goalie stopped 18
Papoose attempts, but probabili
ty caught up with the Sparta
babes in the last two periods.
Both Stanford varsity (12-3)
and frosh (13-2) enter the Nor
Cal Tournament at De Anza JC
over the Thanksgiving holiday.
