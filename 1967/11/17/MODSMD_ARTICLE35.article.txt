# Runners Annihilate Bears
## DAILY Sports 
### BOB RUND 
Senior captain Jim Letterer,
rising to the occasion and turn
ing in his best performance of
the season, paced the Stanford
cross country team to a 26-34
annihilation of California on the
Stanford golf course yesterday.
Letterer finished in second
place, nine-tenth of a second be
hind Cal's Bob Walden, who cov
ered the 4.2 mile distance in
20:24.1. Letterer moved up to
sixth place on the all-time list.
Stanford took the next four
places after Letterer, with Greg

Brock who had led the team
all year, swiping third in 20:42.
Redwine Important
Allen Sanford took fourth for
the Tribe in 20:45, and Brook
Thomas finished fifth 14 seconds
later. Coach Jerry Barland iden
tified Dave Redwine's seventh
place finish in 21:29 as a key
factor in the Cardinal victory.
Steve Byers was the second
Bear finisher, crossing the line
seven seconds ahead of Redwine.
Cal took eighth, ninth, and tenth
places, with Chuck Menz and
Steve Jones rounding out the
field for the Indian varsity.

The combined team total for
the varsity was the best finish
of the season, breaking the old
total by a minute and 47 sec
onds. The Stanford team won
last year 26-29.
Card Frosh Rout Cubs
The Card frosh set out to
break the school record for com
bined team total, and did so with
a flourish, totaling 1:47:13.1 to
crack the old record by 27.7 sec
onds. They defeated the Cal
frosh 18-40.
Don Kardong finished first in
the frosh race in 20:45.9, moving
up to third on the all-time frosh
list. Duncan Mac Donald finished
close on his heels, 3.3 seconds be
hind Kardong to move up to
fourth place on the all-time frosh
list.
Cal averted a shutout only
through the efforts of Tom
Plunk, who finished third in 21:-
26. Stanford took the next three
places as Jay Rice, Mark Jones,

and Brian Cox packed in before
the next Bear runner.
The Indians started Big Game
sports complex in great fashion,
and the possibility now looms
for the Bears that they will be
completely shut put. The water
polo team topped the Bears
twice, and only the football team
and Theta Delts must win to
seal the sweep.
