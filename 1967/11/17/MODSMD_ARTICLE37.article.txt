# Mural Champ's Showdown
## Theta Delts Challenge Cal SAE's 
### JOHN WRIGHT 
Gamblers the world round
have picked Stanford's varsity
as a 6Vfe point favorite over Cal
tomorrow, but they missed an
even surer bet.
The Theta Delts, recently
crowned champions of Stan
ford's intramural touch football
teams, should be heavy favor
ites to maul Cal's SAE squad
tomorrow morning at 11 in the
Stadium.
The intramural champion at
UC will not be officially determ
ined until after Thanksgiving,
so one ox the Cal IM directors
(who just happened to be an
SAE himself) decided that his
fraternity's team would have
the honor of representing Cal
on Big Game day.
The SAE's did beat the Delts
in a quasi-elimination, but there
is perhaps another reason for
the selection. The 15 player
team averages 190 pounds, and
features two 6'4" giants and a
6'5", 245 lb. behemoth.
Moseley Shines
Too bad he'd never heard of
Fred Moseley.
The Theta Delts, led by Mose
ley's inspired play at quarter
back and defensive safety,
fought off the Zetes, 25-13, in
Wednesday's championship
game.
Moseley's intelligent play
calling has sparked the Theta
Delts all season, as they crushed

six opponents and won hard
fought contests from Sigma Chi
Omega, SAE, and the Zetes.
But Wednesday was the first
day Mosely had played an en
tire game at safety. He did a
more than adequate job cover
ing Brad Alden and Mar Agnew,
the Zetes' two superb receivers,
and on the final play of the
game intercepted a pass on the
Theta Delt goal line and ran
out the clock.
The Theta Delts' injury situ
ation could hinder them,
though, in tomorrow's battle
against the Berkeley chapter of
SAE.
Walking Wounded
Moseley, whose puffed eyes
resemble those of a battered
prize fighter after the rough
treatment he received from the
Zetes Wednesday, is just one
of the walking wounded.
John Scales, the talented re
ceiver who caught two of Mose
ley's TD passes in the cham
pionship game, has a tender
hamstring muscle.
Wilson Riles, a stalwart at
blocking back, suffered a con
cussion in Monday's semifinal
game, but may be ready tomor
row.
John Tracey definitely won't
play because of some torn liga
ments.
Tracey, along with Bud Peter
son, did a great job at blocking
back against the Zetes.

Fred Moseley.
The Theta Delts, led by Mose
ley's inspired play at quarter
back and defensive safety,
fought off the Zetes, 25-13, in
Wednesday's championship
game.
Moseley's intelligent play
calling has sparked the Theta
Delts all season, as they crushed

six opponents and won hard
fought contests from Sigma Chi
Omega, SAE, and the Zetes.
But Wednesday was the first
day Mosely had played an en
tire game at safety. He did a
more than adequate job cover
ing Brad Alden and Mar Agnew,
the Zetes' two superb receivers,
and on the final play of the
game intercepted a pass on the
Theta Delt goal line and ran
out the clock.
The Theta Delts' injury situ
ation could hinder them,
though, in tomorrow's battle
against the Berkeley chapter of
SAE.
Walking Wounded
Moseley, whose puffed eyes
resemble those of a battered
prize fighter after the rough
treatment he received from the
Zetes Wednesday, is just one
of the walking wounded.
John Scales, the talented re
ceiver who caught two of Mose
ley's TD passes in the cham
pionship game, has a tender
hamstring muscle.
Wilson Riles, a stalwart at
blocking back, suffered a con
cussion in Monday's semifinal
game, but may be ready tomor
row.
John Tracey definitely won't
play because of some torn liga
ments.
Tracey, along with Bud Peter
son, did a great job at blocking
back against the Zetes.

THETA DELT CHALLENGERS: Here are Stanford's Intramural football champions, the men of
Theta Delta Chi. They will face a monstrous SAE squad from Cal in the stadium at 11:00 Saturday
faorning. Front row, 1 to r: Fred Moseley, Steve Brown, Jim Butler, Phil Enz, Bob Johnson, Van Fish
back. Back row, l to r: John Tracey, Wilson Riles, Bud Peterson, John Scales, Don Gilbert, Steve
Ammons.
Gamblers the world round
have picked Stanford's varsity
as a 6Vfe point favorite over Cal
tomorrow, but they missed an
even surer bet.
The Theta Delts, recently
crowned champions of Stan
ford's intramural touch football
teams, should be heavy favor
ites to maul Cal's SAE squad
tomorrow morning at 11 in the
Stadium.
The intramural champion at
UC will not be officially determ
ined until after Thanksgiving,
so one ox the Cal IM directors
(who just happened to be an
SAE himself) decided that his
fraternity's team would have
the honor of representing Cal
on Big Game day.
The SAE's did beat the Delts
in a quasi-elimination, but there
is perhaps another reason for
the selection. The 15 player
team averages 190 pounds, and
features two 6'4" giants and a
6'5", 245 lb. behemoth.
