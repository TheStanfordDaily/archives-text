# Ink Bowl Spectacle: Fantastic Orgy With Writhing Writers
## 
### STAN DALEY 
I The Ink Bowl Classic, com
plete with post game libations
to the glories of the press,
plucks its way into the world
of Big Game athletic happenings
tomorrow as the stalwart Stan
ford Daily staff squares off
again the Cal Daily Sports re
porters.
- Stanford has not won an Ink
Bowl in the last six years. Last
year, the Cal Daily turned yel
low at the last moment, fearing
both the ominous Daily squad
and the rain in Berkeley.
■ The Daily staff was disap
pointed it did not get to lose its
sixth straight as the Stanford
Varsity won its sixth straight
Big Game.
No Turkey Food
Wells Shoemaker commented
at the time, "The Daily Cal has
advocated a thoroughly craven
principle in denying us the
chance to lose. They should be
tortured by refusing them their
daily menu of marinated turkey
food, crushed pansy blossoms,
and dehydrated chicken livers."
But this year the Farm's rep
resentatives of modern journal
ism are thirsty for Bear blood.
The Daily immediately accepted
the Daily Cal challenge to re
new the Ink Bowl series.
The game will be played on
the Women's Athletic Field at
10:00 tomorrow morning.

Editor Kirk Hanson is the
commander in chief for the
Daily squad, which comprises a
fantastic array of talents and
close to 30 bodies. Hanson has
made no specific plans to assure
victory, but he expects that the
Daily Cal hasn't either.
In an exclusive interview with
Daily Sports Editor Nick Selby
yesterday, the Daily learned vic
tory will be its. "Victory will be
ours," Selby said.
Roadblock Protection
The Daily squad features the
roadblock pass protection of
Marshall Schwartz and Pat Mc-
Mahon for the deadly rifle arm
of quarterback Dean Shapiro.
Shapiro will throw to a covey
of quick receivers: Dick Stout,
Dan Clement, and Bob Stone,
fast moving ad salesmen from
the Business side of the Daily.
Photographers Rocky "the
Rock" Whitson and Charles
"Lens" Kite also handle receiv
ing chores.
Former Gods To Help
Assorted former staffers will
join the Daily effort to lend sup
port to the annihilation efforts.
Peter Eakland, a Phi Kap mu
rals hero on the defensive line,
provides a deadly rush, and
Bruce Howard, the Quad's strat
egist supreme, bats down enemy
aerials with equal agility.
Wells Shoemaker, former
Daily Sports Editor, is eager for

the carnage denied him last year
when he commanded the Daily
team. Shoemaker only hopes he
"can get out of Health Ed 400
in time for the clash.
Gals Counter Cal
The Daily Cal said yesterday
that it was bringing only ten
men, who were coming "to
play." The ominous tone of "to
play" sent shivers through the
Daily office, but several Daily
female staffers vowed to handle
Cal's squad.
Those staffers have volun
teered in droves to serve as
cheer leaders and nurses for all
hurters. Penny Hill, Marian
Johnston, Marta Mahoney, and
Barb Levin will try to stimulate
the Daily squad to greater
things.
Margie Wolf, a recalcitrant
cheerleader, has no ambitions to
wave pom-pons. "I will only
throw touchdown passes," said
Miss Wolf as she applied the
Atomic Balm to her arm.
Numerous other studs are ex
pected to participate in the fray,
and surveying the squad, Sports
Editor Selby had only one com
ment: "Tell Me, How Can We
Lose?!!"
Commander Hanson, who has
seen all too many smart letters
come to his editor's desk, had a
warning for Daily readers, "No
answers are needed, thank you."

Gals Counter Cal
The Daily Cal said yesterday
that it was bringing only ten
men, who were coming "to
play." The ominous tone of "to
play" sent shivers through the
Daily office, but several Daily
female staffers vowed to handle
Cal's squad.
Those staffers have volun
teered in droves to serve as
cheer leaders and nurses for all
hurters. Penny Hill, Marian
Johnston, Marta Mahoney, and
Barb Levin will try to stimulate
the Daily squad to greater
things.
Margie Wolf, a recalcitrant
cheerleader, has no ambitions to
wave pom-pons. "I will only
throw touchdown passes," said
Miss Wolf as she applied the
Atomic Balm to her arm.
Numerous other studs are ex
pected to participate in the fray,
and surveying the squad, Sports
Editor Selby had only one com
ment: "Tell Me, How Can We
Lose?!!"
Commander Hanson, who has
seen all too many smart letters
come to his editor's desk, had a
warning for Daily readers, "No
answers are needed, thank you."
I The Ink Bowl Classic, com
plete with post game libations
to the glories of the press,
plucks its way into the world

porters.
- Stanford has not won an Ink
Bowl in the last six years. Last
year, the Cal Daily turned yel
low at the last moment, fearing
both the ominous Daily squad
and the rain in Berkeley.
■ The Daily staff was disap
pointed it did not get to lose its
sixth straight as the Stanford
Varsity won its sixth straight
Big Game.
No Turkey Food
Wells Shoemaker commented
at the time, "The Daily Cal has
advocated a thoroughly craven
principle in denying us the
chance to lose. They should be
tortured by refusing them their
daily menu of marinated turkey
food, crushed pansy blossoms,
and dehydrated chicken livers."
But this year the Farm's rep
resentatives of modern journal
ism are thirsty for Bear blood.
The Daily immediately accepted
the Daily Cal challenge to re
new the Ink Bowl series.
The game will be played on
the Women's Athletic Field at
10:00 tomorrow morning.

Editor Kirk Hanson is the
commander in chief for the
Daily squad, which comprises a
fantastic array of talents and
close to 30 bodies. Hanson has
made no specific plans to assure
victory, but he expects that the
Daily Cal hasn't either.
In an exclusive interview with
Daily Sports Editor Nick Selby
yesterday, the Daily learned vic
tory will be its. "Victory will be
ours," Selby said.
Roadblock Protection
The Daily squad features the
roadblock pass protection of
Marshall Schwartz and Pat Mc-

of quick receivers: Dick Stout,

fast moving ad salesmen from
