neither binding on the President,

able list.
Lyman attended a luncheon
with Trustees today and was
"very encouraged." The trustees
said that they will come to cam
pus to talk to students, both for
formal and informal meetings.
Meeting Halted
The legislature meeting came
to an abrupt halt when a mo
tion was introduced late in the
evening to reconsider the com
mittee of 15 appointments. The
motion interrupted an explana
tion by LASSU Secretary Gail
Anderson concerning a proposed
clarification of ASSU By-Laws.
A subsequent quorum call in
dicated that four more than a
majority were present. Suppor
ters of Lyman's slate promptly
walked out, thus eliminating the

quorum. Speaker Weinstein was
compelled to adjourn the meet
ing.
Scheduled for consideration at
next Tuesday's session are bills
concerning Fundamental Stan
dard clarification, student dem
onstrations, and a $5,000 appro
priation bill for the Institute
for International Relations.
The evening's proceedings
were interrupted by a "half
time show" from the Stanford
band. The band decked in their
"Instant Rallye" costumes, and
accompanied by the yell leaders
and pom pon dollies, marched
into the session to the tune of
"Come Join the Band." Reaction
to the intrusion was mixed as
some representatives cheered
while others looked sullenly on.
At the cheers' conclusion,
ASSU Vice President Cesare
Massarenti stood up and pro
claimed, "I have never gone to
a Stanford football game, but
now I'm going to root for Cal."
