## The 						Committee Of Fifteen 
### JAMES BRISCOE 
The Committee of 15 (Cl 5)
has been a focus of controversy
at Stanford ever since its stormy
conception in the year 1 A.B.
(after Berkeley).
A tripartite body, composed
of five students, five faculty
members and five University of
ficers, the Cl 5 is charged with
"discussing University problems
and policies with a view to ex
changing ideas and agreeing in
principle on recommendations."
Into this rather nebulous man
date many interpretations have
been read.
In more optimistic days, many
students viewed the committee
as a negotiating board, where
students could sit down on an
equal basis with faculty mem
bers and administrators to re
solve controversial issues. Some
even saw in it the precursor of a
community government in which
all three constituencies—faculty,
administration and students —
would have equal voices.
Cold Members
At the same time, others re
garded the committee as a cool
ing-off place where fiery student
demands could be tempered
through contact with the cold
reason of older and wiser mem
bers of the community.
Although possessing consider
able influence — in a political
system where influence is power
—the Cl 5, except in its initial
stages, has been relatively un
successful in mediating disputes
between students and adminis
trators and many students ex
press disillusion with it. Never
theless ASSU President Peter
Lyman refers to it as the only
"legitimate" University commit
tee because students sit on it as
a matter of right, and not on
the sufference of the 6ther mem
bers.
The origins of the Cl 5 go back
to the early spring of 1965. Dis
turbed by the wide-spread stu
dent unrest at Stanford, two top

policy-making groups, the Advi
sory Board of the Academic
Council and the Committee on
University Policy (COUP),
called for "faculty and Univers
ity office member sof the COUP
to meet with appropriately con
stituted representatives of the
student government" to discuss
the red-hot issue of judicial re
form in the University.
Assertive Legislature
The Legislature of the Asso
ciated Students had asserted
that "the ASSU shall have sole
jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct," and adopted a by
laws amendment providing that
the ASSU judicial councils
should enforce only those Uni
versity policies approved by a
two-thirds vote of Legislature.
The committee formed to me
diate this issue consisted of five
students, five faculty members,
and five administrative officers,
and was promptly dubbed the
"committee of 15." It was com
pared by some to a labor nego
tiating board, although both the
Legislature and the COUP
agreed that it had no powers to
make decisions binding on any
of the three constituencies.
Student leaders at the time
clearly envisioned that numer
ous committees of 15 would be
set up to mediate disputes in
the University community, and
hoped in this way many more
students and faculty members
could be involved in the deci
sion-making process.
Judicial Compromise
After the original committee
arrived at a compromise solu
tion to the judicial dispute (pro
viding that ASSU judicial coun
cils should enforce University
policies except when they con
flicted with ASSU policies), the
Legislature, the COUP and the
executive committee of the Aca
demic Council adopted a joint
resolution stating, "all Univer
sity constituencies are entitled
to express their views prior to

the formulation of University
policies respecting matters in
which they have a legitimate in
terest."
In order to implement this
principle, the resolution recom
mended :
"A mechanism should bo es
tablished through which duly
appointed representatives of
the President of the Univer
sity, the Academic Council
and the Legislature meet to
discuss University problems
and policies with a view to
exchanging ideas and, if pos
sible, agreeing in principle
upon recommendations to be
made to their several appoint
ing powers. The group meet
ing for this purpose, which
may include up to five repre
sentatives of each appointing
power, should not have power
to make decisions or to bind
their several appointing
powers to make decisions."
Contrary to the hopes of many
of its founders, that mechanism
became a single committee, the
Cl 5, rather than separate groups
set up to mediate each issue.
At the root of the present Cl 5
dispute is the notion that each
member of the committee repre
sents a constituency. Although
causing little difficulty among
the faculty and administration,
this notion has been the source
of continuing controversy in the
Legislature.
Further complicating the prob
lem, the Cl 5 from the beginning
decided to hold all its meetings
in secret, reporting only the fi
nal vote, but never how individ
ual members voted on questions.
The Legislature on one occa
sion recalled several members
who, it felt, were not represent
ing the views of the Legislature
in discussions; and each year,
the selection of student members
has occasioned acrimonious de
bate.
This year, it seems, is no ex
ception.

able influence — in a political
system where influence is power
—the Cl 5, except in its initial
stages, has been relatively un
successful in mediating disputes
between students and adminis
trators and many students ex
press disillusion with it. Never
theless ASSU President Peter
Lyman refers to it as the only
"legitimate" University commit
tee because students sit on it as
a matter of right, and not on
the sufference of the 6ther mem
bers.
The origins of the Cl 5 go back
to the early spring of 1965. Dis
turbed by the wide-spread stu
dent unrest at Stanford, two top

policy-making groups, the Advi
sory Board of the Academic
Council and the Committee on
University Policy (COUP),
called for "faculty and Univers
ity office member sof the COUP
to meet with appropriately con
stituted representatives of the
student government" to discuss
the red-hot issue of judicial re
form in the University.
Assertive Legislature
The Legislature of the Asso
ciated Students had asserted
that "the ASSU shall have sole
jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct," and adopted a by
laws amendment providing that
the ASSU judicial councils
should enforce only those Uni
versity policies approved by a
two-thirds vote of Legislature.
The committee formed to me
diate this issue consisted of five
students, five faculty members,
and five administrative officers,
and was promptly dubbed the
"committee of 15." It was com
pared by some to a labor nego
tiating board, although both the
Legislature and the COUP
agreed that it had no powers to
make decisions binding on any
of the three constituencies.
Student leaders at the time
clearly envisioned that numer
ous committees of 15 would be
set up to mediate disputes in
the University community, and
hoped in this way many more
students and faculty members
could be involved in the deci
sion-making process.
Judicial Compromise
After the original committee
arrived at a compromise solu
tion to the judicial dispute (pro
viding that ASSU judicial coun
cils should enforce University
policies except when they con
flicted with ASSU policies), the
Legislature, the COUP and the
executive committee of the Aca
demic Council adopted a joint
resolution stating, "all Univer
sity constituencies are entitled
to express their views prior to

the formulation of University
policies respecting matters in
which they have a legitimate in
terest."
In order to implement this
principle, the resolution recom
mended :
"A mechanism should bo es
tablished through which duly
appointed representatives of
the President of the Univer
sity, the Academic Council
and the Legislature meet to
discuss University problems
and policies with a view to
exchanging ideas and, if pos
sible, agreeing in principle
upon recommendations to be
made to their several appoint
ing powers. The group meet
ing for this purpose, which
may include up to five repre
sentatives of each appointing
power, should not have power
to make decisions or to bind
their several appointing
powers to make decisions."
Contrary to the hopes of many
of its founders, that mechanism
became a single committee, the
Cl 5, rather than separate groups
set up to mediate each issue.
At the root of the present Cl 5
dispute is the notion that each
member of the committee repre
sents a constituency. Although
causing little difficulty among
the faculty and administration,
this notion has been the source
of continuing controversy in the
Legislature.
Further complicating the prob
lem, the Cl 5 from the beginning
decided to hold all its meetings
in secret, reporting only the fi
nal vote, but never how individ
ual members voted on questions.
The Legislature on one occa
sion recalled several members
who, it felt, were not represent
ing the views of the Legislature
in discussions; and each year,
the selection of student members
has occasioned acrimonious de
bate.
This year, it seems, is no ex
ception.
The Committee of 15 (Cl 5)
has been a focus of controversy
at Stanford ever since its stormy
conception in the year 1 A.B.
(after Berkeley).
A tripartite body, composed
of five students, five faculty
members and five University of
ficers, the Cl 5 is charged with
"discussing University problems
and policies with a view to ex
changing ideas and agreeing in
principle on recommendations."
Into this rather nebulous man
date many interpretations have
been read.
In more optimistic days, many
students viewed the committee
as a negotiating board, where
students could sit down on an
equal basis with faculty mem
bers and administrators to re
solve controversial issues. Some
even saw in it the precursor of a
community government in which
all three constituencies—faculty,
administration and students —
would have equal voices.
Cold Members
At the same time, others re
garded the committee as a cool
ing-off place where fiery student
demands could be tempered
through contact with the cold
reason of older and wiser mem
bers of the community.

laws amendment providing that
the ASSU judicial councils
should enforce only those Uni
versity policies approved by a
two-thirds vote of Legislature.
The committee formed to me
diate this issue consisted of five
students, five faculty members,
and five administrative officers,
and was promptly dubbed the
"committee of 15." It was com
pared by some to a labor nego
tiating board, although both the
Legislature and the COUP
agreed that it had no powers to
make decisions binding on any
of the three constituencies.
Student leaders at the time
clearly envisioned that numer
ous committees of 15 would be
set up to mediate disputes in
the University community, and
hoped in this way many more
students and faculty members
could be involved in the deci
sion-making process.
Judicial Compromise
After the original committee
arrived at a compromise solu
tion to the judicial dispute (pro
viding that ASSU judicial coun
cils should enforce University
policies except when they con
flicted with ASSU policies), the
Legislature, the COUP and the
executive committee of the Aca
demic Council adopted a joint
resolution stating, "all Univer
sity constituencies are entitled
to express their views prior to

the formulation of University
policies respecting matters in
which they have a legitimate in
terest."
In order to implement this
principle, the resolution recom
mended :
"A mechanism should bo es
tablished through which duly
appointed representatives of
the President of the Univer
sity, the Academic Council
and the Legislature meet to
discuss University problems
and policies with a view to
exchanging ideas and, if pos
sible, agreeing in principle
upon recommendations to be
made to their several appoint
ing powers. The group meet
ing for this purpose, which
may include up to five repre
sentatives of each appointing
power, should not have power
to make decisions or to bind
their several appointing
powers to make decisions."
Contrary to the hopes of many
of its founders, that mechanism
became a single committee, the
Cl 5, rather than separate groups
set up to mediate each issue.
At the root of the present Cl 5
dispute is the notion that each
member of the committee repre
sents a constituency. Although
causing little difficulty among
the faculty and administration,
this notion has been the source
of continuing controversy in the
Legislature.
Further complicating the prob
lem, the Cl 5 from the beginning
decided to hold all its meetings
in secret, reporting only the fi
nal vote, but never how individ
ual members voted on questions.
The Legislature on one occa
sion recalled several members
who, it felt, were not represent
ing the views of the Legislature
in discussions; and each year,
the selection of student members
has occasioned acrimonious de
bate.
This year, it seems, is no ex
ception.
The Committee of 15 (Cl 5)
has been a focus of controversy
at Stanford ever since its stormy
conception in the year 1 A.B.
(after Berkeley).
A tripartite body, composed
of five students, five faculty
members and five University of
ficers, the Cl 5 is charged with
"discussing University problems
and policies with a view to ex
changing ideas and agreeing in
principle on recommendations."
Into this rather nebulous man
date many interpretations have
been read.
In more optimistic days, many
students viewed the committee
as a negotiating board, where
students could sit down on an
equal basis with faculty mem
bers and administrators to re
solve controversial issues. Some
even saw in it the precursor of a
community government in which
all three constituencies—faculty,
administration and students —
would have equal voices.
Cold Members
At the same time, others re
garded the committee as a cool
ing-off place where fiery student
demands could be tempered
through contact with the cold
reason of older and wiser mem
bers of the community.
Although possessing consider
able influence — in a political
system where influence is power
—the Cl 5, except in its initial
stages, has been relatively un
successful in mediating disputes
between students and adminis
trators and many students ex
press disillusion with it. Never
theless ASSU President Peter
Lyman refers to it as the only
"legitimate" University commit
tee because students sit on it as
a matter of right, and not on
the sufference of the 6ther mem
bers.
The origins of the Cl 5 go back
to the early spring of 1965. Dis
turbed by the wide-spread stu
dent unrest at Stanford, two top

policy-making groups, the Advi
sory Board of the Academic
Council and the Committee on
University Policy (COUP),
called for "faculty and Univers
ity office member sof the COUP
to meet with appropriately con
stituted representatives of the
student government" to discuss
the red-hot issue of judicial re
form in the University.
Assertive Legislature
The Legislature of the Asso
ciated Students had asserted
that "the ASSU shall have sole
jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct," and adopted a by
laws amendment providing that
the ASSU judicial councils
should enforce only those Uni
