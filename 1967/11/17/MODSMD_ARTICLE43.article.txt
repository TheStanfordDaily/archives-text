## 
### 
BOSTON (CPS)â€”The Nation
al Organization of Democratic
College Students, barred by its
constitution from endorsing any
candidate prior to the party's
convention, has unofficially en
dorsed Sen. Eugene McCarthy
for President in 1968.
The young Democrats passed
a resolution here recently
which urged the Democratic
Party "to seek a candidate . . .
who will seek an honorable
peace in Vietnam, and restore
the party to its traditional ad
herence to libera] and progres
sive ideals."
After passage of the resolu
tion, the college Democrats
broke out into an enthusiastic
MeCarthy-for-President demon
stration. McCarthy, a Minnesota
Democrat, is expected to an
nounce soon that he will enter
several presidential primaries
against President Johnson next
year.
