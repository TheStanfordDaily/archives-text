Some of the same equipment
in America's Mercury, Gemini,
and Apollo spacecraft is now be
ing used by the Stanford Physi
cal Education Department.
Beckman Instrument's dyno
meter, which measures heart
beat and respiration rates, is be
ing employed in experiments in
volving many Stanford athletes
in a wide range of sports, from
karate to basketball. Tuesday
night Mr. Edmund K. Parker,
President of the International
Kenpo Karate Association, and
one of the foremost blackbelts in
the country, gave a special dem
onstration for the Stanford Ka
rate Club.
During his workout Parker's
heartbeat and respiration rates
were measured with the tele
metric equipment. Transmitters
were taped to the subject's chest
and back, and because there are
no wires connecting these trans
mitters to the equipment his
movements were not restrained
by the device.
According to Karate club pres
ident and instructor George Peg

elow the experiment will be
used to determine physiological
relationships between the heart
beat rate and some of the arm
and feet movements. The dem
onstration was also videotaped
in order to co-ordinate the ex
perimental results with the
movements.
The dynometer has also been
used to measure the heartbeat
and respiration rates of sprint
ers, cross country runners, bas
ketball players, trackmen and
swimmers. According to Dr. Wes
Ruff, Head of the Physical Edu
cation Department, there is a
definite relationship between ef
fort extended during a training
period and heartbeat rate. "We
are trying to determine the level
of exertion which causes th e
body to adapt," Dr. Ruff said.
He added that when the body
begins to adapt, training be
comes beneficial. Overtraining
an underdeveloped athlete can
do him no good, in fact it can
cause him definite harm Ruff
commented.
By studying the relationships

between heartbeat and individual
training, the experimenters can
plan maximum training pro
grams and secure better results.
The basic question involved is
"How hard do athletes train in
different sports? How do their
heartbeats compare?" said Dr.
Ruff. Thus the study applies to
all sports. In recent experiments
the heartbeat rate of a sprinter
was measured at up to 160 beats
per minute while the rates of
some swimmers exceed 200. The
normal rate is considered to be
approximately 70.
Another purpose in the study
is helping to checkout the ap
paratus and enable improvement
for Beckman. "There are a lot
of problems involved with this
equipment," Dr. Ruff said. Move
ment and vibration which are
not present in spaceflight are
two of the problems with pres
ent experimental procedures.

Another purpose in the study
is helping to checkout the ap
paratus and enable improvement
for Beckman. "There are a lot
of problems involved with this
equipment," Dr. Ruff said. Move
ment and vibration which are
not present in spaceflight are
two of the problems with pres
ent experimental procedures.
Some of the same equipment
in America's Mercury, Gemini,
and Apollo spacecraft is now be
ing used by the Stanford Physi
cal Education Department.
Beckman Instrument's dyno
meter, which measures heart
beat and respiration rates, is be
ing employed in experiments in
volving many Stanford athletes
in a wide range of sports, from
karate to basketball. Tuesday
night Mr. Edmund K. Parker,
President of the International
Kenpo Karate Association, and
one of the foremost blackbelts in
the country, gave a special dem
onstration for the Stanford Ka
rate Club.
During his workout Parker's
heartbeat and respiration rates
were measured with the tele
metric equipment. Transmitters
were taped to the subject's chest
and back, and because there are
no wires connecting these trans
mitters to the equipment his
movements were not restrained
by the device.
According to Karate club pres
ident and instructor George Peg

elow the experiment will be
used to determine physiological
relationships between the heart
beat rate and some of the arm
and feet movements. The dem
onstration was also videotaped
in order to co-ordinate the ex
perimental results with the
movements.
The dynometer has also been
used to measure the heartbeat
and respiration rates of sprint
ers, cross country runners, bas
ketball players, trackmen and
swimmers. According to Dr. Wes
Ruff, Head of the Physical Edu
cation Department, there is a
definite relationship between ef
fort extended during a training
period and heartbeat rate. "We
are trying to determine the level
of exertion which causes th e
body to adapt," Dr. Ruff said.
He added that when the body
begins to adapt, training be
comes beneficial. Overtraining
an underdeveloped athlete can
do him no good, in fact it can
cause him definite harm Ruff
commented.
By studying the relationships

between heartbeat and individual
training, the experimenters can
plan maximum training pro
grams and secure better results.
The basic question involved is
"How hard do athletes train in
different sports? How do their
heartbeats compare?" said Dr.
Ruff. Thus the study applies to
all sports. In recent experiments
the heartbeat rate of a sprinter
was measured at up to 160 beats
per minute while the rates of
some swimmers exceed 200. The
normal rate is considered to be
approximately 70.
