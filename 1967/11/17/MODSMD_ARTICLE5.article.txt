## 
### CHUCK KITSMAN 
Nicholas deß. Katzenbach, un
dersecretary of state, will speak
this afternoon at 4:30 to a pub
lic meeting in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium amid possible protests.
His topic is "U.S. Arms for the
Developing World: Dilemmas of
Foreign Policy.
A mimeographed bulletin urg
ing all "opposed to present (Ad
ministration) policy ... to wear
a white shirt or blouse and at
appropriate times to signify
their disapproval with a loud

'NO'," was posted around the
campus.
This sheet was drawn up as
a rough draft of possible action
by an impromptu student-facul
ty committee which several
members disregarded, according
to Lucio P. .Ruotolo, associate
professor of English, because it
was not felt to be a "good means
of protest."
Ruotolo denied that the sig
natories of the proposal advo
cated such action.
Effective Political Movement
"The intention of the Commit
tee is to organize more moderate
anti-Vietnam war feeling that
we believe exists presently on
the Stanford campus," he stated.
"Our intention is to channel
this opposition into a more ef
fective political movement. Al
though we want to strongly
voice our dissent, we feel the
necessity for respecting the
right of advocacy definitive of a
true university."
Paul Seaver, assistant profes
sor of history, also disclaimed
any involvement in such a plan.
"It was a preliminary plan,
drawn up before we had any in
dication of support for it."
Seaver stated that as far as
he knew any opposition to U.S.
policy would be expressed in a
question and answer session af
ter the speech, provided Katzen
bach is willing to speak on Viet
nam.

The program will begin with
Mark Mancall's introduction of
Katzenbach who will speak for
approximately a half hour. Katz
enbach will then field questions
from the audience.
Amy Newel, a junior major
ing in anthropology, and mem
ber of the original committee,
proposed another plan.
Mimeographed Question
Ten questions would be drawn
up, mimeographed, and handed
to people entering the audito
rium, with the hope that these
questions would be brought up
during the open period.
A spokesman for the Institute
of International Relations com
mented that he sees no danger
of violent reaction or protest
during Katzenbach's speech. He
predicted a "sincere dialogue,
with no one trying to shut him
down."
He felt the undersecrtary
would participate in the debate
with the same spirit.
Professor Mancall foresees no
demonstrations, yet he assumes
there will be some "sharp ques
tioning" and he felt that the
ten-questions idea would be an
"effective form of protest."

Paul Seaver, assistant profes
sor of history, also disclaimed
any involvement in such a plan.
"It was a preliminary plan,
drawn up before we had any in
dication of support for it."
Seaver stated that as far as
he knew any opposition to U.S.
policy would be expressed in a
question and answer session af
ter the speech, provided Katzen
bach is willing to speak on Viet
nam.

The program will begin with
Mark Mancall's introduction of
Katzenbach who will speak for
approximately a half hour. Katz
enbach will then field questions
from the audience.
Amy Newel, a junior major
ing in anthropology, and mem
ber of the original committee,
proposed another plan.
Mimeographed Question
Ten questions would be drawn
up, mimeographed, and handed
to people entering the audito
rium, with the hope that these
questions would be brought up
during the open period.
A spokesman for the Institute
of International Relations com
mented that he sees no danger
of violent reaction or protest
during Katzenbach's speech. He
predicted a "sincere dialogue,
with no one trying to shut him
down."
He felt the undersecrtary
would participate in the debate
with the same spirit.
Professor Mancall foresees no
demonstrations, yet he assumes
there will be some "sharp ques
tioning" and he felt that the
ten-questions idea would be an
"effective form of protest."
Nicholas deß. Katzenbach, un
dersecretary of state, will speak
this afternoon at 4:30 to a pub
lic meeting in Dinkelspiel Audi
torium amid possible protests.
His topic is "U.S. Arms for the
Developing World: Dilemmas of
Foreign Policy.
A mimeographed bulletin urg
ing all "opposed to present (Ad
ministration) policy ... to wear
a white shirt or blouse and at
appropriate times to signify
their disapproval with a loud

'NO'," was posted around the
campus.
This sheet was drawn up as
a rough draft of possible action
by an impromptu student-facul
ty committee which several
members disregarded, according
to Lucio P. .Ruotolo, associate
professor of English, because it
was not felt to be a "good means
of protest."
Ruotolo denied that the sig
natories of the proposal advo
cated such action.
Effective Political Movement
"The intention of the Commit
tee is to organize more moderate
anti-Vietnam war feeling that
we believe exists presently on
the Stanford campus," he stated.
"Our intention is to channel
this opposition into a more ef
fective political movement. Al
though we want to strongly
voice our dissent, we feel the
necessity for respecting the
right of advocacy definitive of a
true university."
