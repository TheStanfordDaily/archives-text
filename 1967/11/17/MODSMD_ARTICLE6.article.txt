### RENTON ROLPH 
Nicholas deßelleville Katzen

bach is, in the words of one of
his friends, "an unusual combi
nation of the professor and the
practical politician."
A law professor at Yale Law
School and the University of
Chicago during the fifties, in
1960 Katzenbach was in Switzer
land on a Ford Foundation fel
lowship when he heard that
friends at home were landing
jobs in the Kennedy Administra
tion.
A letter exchange ensued and
before long Nicholas Katzenbach
became the United States's Dep
uty Attorney General under
Robert Kennedy.
Katzenbach, with the help of
Everett Dirksen, authored the
Civil Rights Act of 1964. And a
little earlier, in a role never be
fore assumed by a Deputy At
torney General, he acted as a
judicial troubleshooter impli
menting federal policies in the
South.
Katzenbach Vs. Wallace
In 1963, according to News
week, "Katzenbach faced Ala
bama Governor George Wallace
at the State University when
National Guard troops were
used to force enrollment of two
Negro students over the Gover
nor's objection."
In 1967 Andrew Kopkind
wrote in The New Republic, "At
torney General Katzenbach,
more than any Negro activist, is
this year's civil rights man-of
the-year." The liberal intelligent
sia was generally pleased with
Katzenbach during the civil
rights campaign.
And the feeling was mutual.
In January, 1966, speaking in
Mobile, Katzenbach paid tribute
to SNCC workers who came to
Selma in 1963 "and stayed to
develop a momentum that has
borne fruit.
"A century ago it was Lin
coln who emancipated the Ne
gro. A generation hence we may
very well recognize that it was
the Negro who helped to eman
cipate the nation."
For during his last months as
head of the Justice Department
(he became Undersecretary of
State in October, 1966), Katzen
bach's pronouncements shifted
from the problems of the po
litically unregistered minorities
in this country to the problem

created by the highly involved
and vocal anti-war minority.
In late 1965, the New York
Times reported that "Mr. Katz
enbach was questioned (at a
news conference) about the SDS
. . . he said that it was but one
of many such organizations the
Justice Department was investi
gating."
Also in 1965, Katzenbach
warned that the "beat-the-draft

movement, insofar as it does
exist, could be in violation of
federal statutes. Where people
tear up draft cards they stand a
very good chance of being prose
cuted, if we can prove that is
what they did."
Counseling a man on ways to
become a CO "could be a viola
tion of federal law," he contin
ued. "We may very well have
some prosecutions in this area."

litically unregistered minorities
in this country to the problem

created by the highly involved
and vocal anti-war minority.
In late 1965, the New York
Times reported that "Mr. Katz
enbach was questioned (at a
news conference) about the SDS
. . . he said that it was but one
of many such organizations the
Justice Department was investi
gating."
Also in 1965, Katzenbach
warned that the "beat-the-draft

movement, insofar as it does
exist, could be in violation of
federal statutes. Where people
tear up draft cards they stand a
very good chance of being prose
cuted, if we can prove that is
what they did."
Counseling a man on ways to
become a CO "could be a viola
tion of federal law," he contin
ued. "We may very well have
some prosecutions in this area."
Nicholas deßelleville Katzen

bach is, in the words of one of
his friends, "an unusual combi
nation of the professor and the
practical politician."
A law professor at Yale Law
School and the University of
Chicago during the fifties, in
1960 Katzenbach was in Switzer
land on a Ford Foundation fel
lowship when he heard that
friends at home were landing
jobs in the Kennedy Administra
tion.
A letter exchange ensued and
before long Nicholas Katzenbach
became the United States's Dep
uty Attorney General under
Robert Kennedy.
Katzenbach, with the help of
Everett Dirksen, authored the
Civil Rights Act of 1964. And a
little earlier, in a role never be
fore assumed by a Deputy At
torney General, he acted as a
judicial troubleshooter impli
menting federal policies in the
South.
Katzenbach Vs. Wallace
In 1963, according to News
week, "Katzenbach faced Ala
bama Governor George Wallace
at the State University when
National Guard troops were
used to force enrollment of two
Negro students over the Gover
nor's objection."
In 1967 Andrew Kopkind
wrote in The New Republic, "At
torney General Katzenbach,
more than any Negro activist, is
this year's civil rights man-of
the-year." The liberal intelligent
sia was generally pleased with
Katzenbach during the civil
rights campaign.
And the feeling was mutual.
In January, 1966, speaking in
Mobile, Katzenbach paid tribute
to SNCC workers who came to
Selma in 1963 "and stayed to
develop a momentum that has
borne fruit.
"A century ago it was Lin
coln who emancipated the Ne
gro. A generation hence we may
very well recognize that it was
the Negro who helped to eman
cipate the nation."
For during his last months as
head of the Justice Department
