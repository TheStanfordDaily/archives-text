## SES Faces Opposition 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
During the past month, the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) has begun to couple pri
vate deliberation with public ex
posure of proposals. The re
sponse has been a mixture of
apathy and limited, though ada

mant, opposition in the faculty
and student body.
As the Study works toward
its recommendation deadline of
late next fall, it will increasingly
make public tentative proposals
touching on many areas of the
University, and will face grow
ing opposition from affected in
terest groups in the community.
A Student Review Board is
being established by ASSU Pres
ident Peter Lyman to examine
SES proposals and offer recom
mendations of its own. As the
Study proposals become mor?
specific, the students and the
faculty will probably both find
them hitting closer and closer
to home and the quantity and in
tensity of criticism will grow in
proportion.
Form More Proposals
Publication and distribution of
the steering committee's paper
"Toward a More Flexible Under
graduate Program" was the
Study's first major public expo
sure of ideas. Now, almost three
weeks after the paper's release,
the steering committee is begin
ning to reflect on comments re
ceived and is working on a sec
ond set of more specific propo
sals.
These second proposals will
fall within eight categories:
grading and academic recogni
tion; academic scheduling and
calendar; course loads; directed
reading as a replacement for
small courses; qualifying exam
inations, advanced placement,
and remedial courses: work

study; special problems in sci
ence and engineering education;
and details of distributional re
quirements under a modified
General Studies program.
Once these proposals are
formed they too will be publish
ed, and after the resulting com
ment, the steering committee
will try to develop final recom
mendations.
Oppose Position Paper
Opposition to the Study's un
dergraduate position paper has
been strongest In the language
and mathematics departments,
and in the General Studies office.
The steering committee suggest
ed abandoning language and
math requirements at Stanford
in its paper and the departments
voiced loud opposition directly
to the committee plus comment
ing in articles and letters in The
Dally.
The General Studies office,
realizing drastic changes are in
the offing, has also indicated con
cern over moving too far from
a prescribed undergraduate pro
gram.
The committee's proposals
seem to have met with general
approval in the student body.
The Study has offered several
forums through which students
could question and criticize the
proposals, but hardly any stu
dents have attended.
Some of those who have
spoken out feel the proposals,
while better than the existing
structures, still do not offer stu
