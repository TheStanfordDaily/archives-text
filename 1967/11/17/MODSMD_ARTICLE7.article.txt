## SES Faces Opposition 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
During the past month, the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) has begun to couple pri
vate deliberation with public ex
posure of proposals. The re
sponse has been a mixture of
apathy and limited, though ada

mant, opposition in the faculty
and student body.
As the Study works toward
its recommendation deadline of
late next fall, it will increasingly
make public tentative proposals
touching on many areas of the
University, and will face grow
ing opposition from affected in
terest groups in the community.
A Student Review Board is
being established by ASSU Pres
ident Peter Lyman to examine
SES proposals and offer recom
mendations of its own. As the
Study proposals become mor?
specific, the students and the
faculty will probably both find
them hitting closer and closer
to home and the quantity and in
tensity of criticism will grow in
proportion.
Form More Proposals
Publication and distribution of
the steering committee's paper
"Toward a More Flexible Under
graduate Program" was the
Study's first major public expo
sure of ideas. Now, almost three
weeks after the paper's release,
the steering committee is begin
ning to reflect on comments re
ceived and is working on a sec
ond set of more specific propo
sals.
These second proposals will
fall within eight categories:
grading and academic recogni
tion; academic scheduling and
calendar; course loads; directed
reading as a replacement for
small courses; qualifying exam
inations, advanced placement,
and remedial courses: work

study; special problems in sci
ence and engineering education;
and details of distributional re
quirements under a modified
General Studies program.
Once these proposals are
formed they too will be publish
ed, and after the resulting com
ment, the steering committee
will try to develop final recom
mendations.
Oppose Position Paper
Opposition to the Study's un
dergraduate position paper has
been strongest In the language
and mathematics departments,
and in the General Studies office.
The steering committee suggest
ed abandoning language and
math requirements at Stanford
in its paper and the departments
voiced loud opposition directly
to the committee plus comment
ing in articles and letters in The
Dally.
The General Studies office,
realizing drastic changes are in
the offing, has also indicated con
cern over moving too far from
a prescribed undergraduate pro
gram.
The committee's proposals
seem to have met with general
approval in the student body.
The Study has offered several
forums through which students
could question and criticize the
proposals, but hardly any stu
dents have attended.
Some of those who have
spoken out feel the proposals,
while better than the existing
structures, still do not offer stu
dents enough freedom and op
portunity for independent work.
While the stpering committee
continues work on undergradu
ate education, it has started an
examination of graduate educa
tion. One member of the com
mittee is writing a position paper
on this subject which will prob
ably provide the foundation for
a final committee position paper.
When completed, the final com
mittee paper will be published,
comments will be sought, and
second and third proposals will
be developed.
At'er working on graduate ed
ucation, which will carry into the
winter, the steering committee
plans to move to the area of
teaching.
Some of the questions to be
discussed are: Are teaching loads
equally distributed? Is sufficient
attention being payed to the
quality of teaching? How can
the T.A. program be improved?
What improvements can be
made in the selection and re
cruitment of faculty?
As the steering committee
works in these areas, the nine
topic committees it established
to study other specific Univer
sity areas will begin filtering
recommendations up to the
steering committee.
The nine topic committees are:

Admissions and Financial Aids,
Advising and Counseling, Cam
pus Environment, Computers,
the Extracurriculum, Govern
ment of the University, Interna
tional Education, Research, and
Residences.
Residences, Admissions and
Financial Aids, Advising and
Counseling, and International
Education are furthest along in
their work, having completed
much of their initial data gather
ing.
Last spring, the residence com
mittee made several immediate
recommendations for this year's
demonstration housing and was
thus delayed in beginning dis
cussion of the broad issues in
volved in running a resident uni
versity.
The admissions committee has
already made several recommen
dations to the steering commit
tee, one suggesting an end to
the high ratio of men to women
at Stanford. The steering com
mittee has yet to adopt it as an
SES proposal.
As established by President
Sterling, the Study has no deci
sion making power, but only the
power to recommend. Any rec
ommendations must be adopted
by the Academic Council, the
'President, and the Board of
Trustees before it can become
University policy.

The committee's proposals
seem to have met with general
approval in the student body.
The Study has offered several
forums through which students
could question and criticize the
proposals, but hardly any stu

Some of those who have
spoken out feel the proposals,
while better than the existing
structures, still do not offer stu

While the stpering committee
continues work on undergradu

examination of graduate educa

on this subject which will prob
ably provide the foundation for

When completed, the final com

be developed.
At'er working on graduate ed
ucation, which will carry into the
winter, the steering committee
plans to move to the area of
teaching.
Some of the questions to be
discussed are: Are teaching loads
equally distributed? Is sufficient
attention being payed to the
quality of teaching? How can
the T.A. program be improved?
What improvements can be
made in the selection and re
cruitment of faculty?
As the steering committee
works in these areas, the nine
topic committees it established
to study other specific Univer
sity areas will begin filtering
recommendations up to the
steering committee.
The nine topic committees are:

Admissions and Financial Aids,
Advising and Counseling, Cam
pus Environment, Computers,
the Extracurriculum, Govern
ment of the University, Interna
tional Education, Research, and
Residences.
Residences, Admissions and
Financial Aids, Advising and
Counseling, and International
Education are furthest along in
their work, having completed
much of their initial data gather
ing.
Last spring, the residence com
mittee made several immediate
recommendations for this year's
demonstration housing and was
thus delayed in beginning dis
cussion of the broad issues in
volved in running a resident uni
versity.
The admissions committee has
already made several recommen
dations to the steering commit
tee, one suggesting an end to
the high ratio of men to women
at Stanford. The steering com
mittee has yet to adopt it as an
SES proposal.
As established by President
Sterling, the Study has no deci
sion making power, but only the
power to recommend. Any rec
ommendations must be adopted
by the Academic Council, the
'President, and the Board of
Trustees before it can become
University policy.
During the past month, the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) has begun to couple pri
vate deliberation with public ex
posure of proposals. The re
sponse has been a mixture of
apathy and limited, though ada

mant, opposition in the faculty
and student body.
As the Study works toward
its recommendation deadline of
late next fall, it will increasingly
make public tentative proposals
touching on many areas of the
University, and will face grow
ing opposition from affected in
terest groups in the community.
A Student Review Board is
being established by ASSU Pres
ident Peter Lyman to examine
SES proposals and offer recom
mendations of its own. As the
Study proposals become mor?
specific, the students and the
faculty will probably both find
them hitting closer and closer
to home and the quantity and in
tensity of criticism will grow in
proportion.

Publication and distribution of
the steering committee's paper
"Toward a More Flexible Under
graduate Program" was the

sure of ideas. Now, almost three
weeks after the paper's release,
the steering committee is begin

These second proposals will
fall within eight categories:
grading and academic recogni
tion; academic scheduling and
calendar; course loads; directed
reading as a replacement for
small courses; qualifying exam
inations, advanced placement,
and remedial courses: work

study; special problems in sci
ence and engineering education;
and details of distributional re

at Stanford. The steering com
mittee has yet to adopt it as an
SES proposal.
As established by President
Sterling, the Study has no deci
sion making power, but only the
power to recommend. Any rec
ommendations must be adopted
by the Academic Council, the
'President, and the Board of
Trustees before it can become
University policy.
During the past month, the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) has begun to couple pri
vate deliberation with public ex
posure of proposals. The re
sponse has been a mixture of
apathy and limited, though ada

mant, opposition in the faculty
and student body.
As the Study works toward
its recommendation deadline of
late next fall, it will increasingly
make public tentative proposals
touching on many areas of the
University, and will face grow
ing opposition from affected in
terest groups in the community.
A Student Review Board is
being established by ASSU Pres
ident Peter Lyman to examine
SES proposals and offer recom
mendations of its own. As the
Study proposals become mor?
specific, the students and the
faculty will probably both find
them hitting closer and closer
to home and the quantity and in
tensity of criticism will grow in
proportion.
Form More Proposals
Publication and distribution of
the steering committee's paper
"Toward a More Flexible Under
graduate Program" was the
Study's first major public expo
sure of ideas. Now, almost three
weeks after the paper's release,
the steering committee is begin
ning to reflect on comments re
ceived and is working on a sec
ond set of more specific propo
sals.
These second proposals will
fall within eight categories:
grading and academic recogni
tion; academic scheduling and
calendar; course loads; directed
reading as a replacement for
small courses; qualifying exam
inations, advanced placement,
and remedial courses: work

study; special problems in sci
ence and engineering education;
and details of distributional re
quirements under a modified
General Studies program.
Once these proposals are
formed they too will be publish
ed, and after the resulting com
ment, the steering committee
will try to develop final recom
mendations.
Oppose Position Paper
Opposition to the Study's un
dergraduate position paper has
been strongest In the language
and mathematics departments,
and in the General Studies office.
The steering committee suggest
ed abandoning language and
math requirements at Stanford
in its paper and the departments
voiced loud opposition directly
to the committee plus comment
ing in articles and letters in The
Dally.
The General Studies office,
realizing drastic changes are in
the offing, has also indicated con
cern over moving too far from
a prescribed undergraduate pro
gram.
The committee's proposals
seem to have met with general
approval in the student body.
The Study has offered several
forums through which students
could question and criticize the
proposals, but hardly any stu
dents have attended.
Some of those who have
spoken out feel the proposals,
while better than the existing
structures, still do not offer stu
dents enough freedom and op
portunity for independent work.
While the stpering committee
continues work on undergradu
ate education, it has started an
examination of graduate educa
tion. One member of the com
mittee is writing a position paper
on this subject which will prob
ably provide the foundation for
a final committee position paper.
When completed, the final com
mittee paper will be published,
comments will be sought, and
second and third proposals will
be developed.
At'er working on graduate ed
ucation, which will carry into the
winter, the steering committee
plans to move to the area of
teaching.
Some of the questions to be
discussed are: Are teaching loads
equally distributed? Is sufficient
attention being payed to the
quality of teaching? How can
the T.A. program be improved?
What improvements can be
made in the selection and re
cruitment of faculty?
As the steering committee
works in these areas, the nine
topic committees it established
to study other specific Univer
sity areas will begin filtering
recommendations up to the
steering committee.
The nine topic committees are:

Admissions and Financial Aids,
Advising and Counseling, Cam
pus Environment, Computers,
the Extracurriculum, Govern
ment of the University, Interna
tional Education, Research, and
Residences.
Residences, Admissions and
Financial Aids, Advising and
Counseling, and International
Education are furthest along in
their work, having completed
much of their initial data gather
ing.
Last spring, the residence com
mittee made several immediate
recommendations for this year's
demonstration housing and was
thus delayed in beginning dis
cussion of the broad issues in
volved in running a resident uni
versity.
The admissions committee has
already made several recommen
dations to the steering commit
tee, one suggesting an end to
the high ratio of men to women
at Stanford. The steering com
mittee has yet to adopt it as an
