### 
The Carpenter - Farwell tick
et will face Spiderman on Mon
day and Tuesday in a run-off
election for head yell leader.
More than twice as many stu
dents than on Wednesday voted
yesterday to give Ted Carpenter
and Grosvenor Farwell the lead
with 257 votes, followed by Spid
derman Bill Eakland with 227.
Bruce Malfait was runner-up
with 163 votes, followed by Scott
Keeney with 107, Doug Pirnie
with 79, and Tim Llewellyn with
72. The Stanford Band drew four
write-in votes, and Hoover Tow
er was second in the write-in
category with two votes. Liz Ad
ler, John Avery, and President
Johnson all attracted one vote.
Graduate students in the
school of humanities and sci
ences chose three LASSU
representatives out of four run
ners-up. Delores Mack topped
the field with 14 votes, Guillermo
Delbue received nine, and Char

les Brody, eight. Chick Fitts was
not elected.
David Mannheimer became the
twentieth off-campus represen
tative to LASSU by defeating
Katherine McMillan, with 21
votes to her 14.
The new legislature held its
first meeting last night in Room
320, Geology Corner.
The cheerleader election has
been plagued by irregularities
since the candidates led a dem
onstration yell at the UCLA
game on October 21.
Four of the eight candidates
variously charged electioneering
(within 25 feet of the polls), pre
mature campaigning, and cam
paign spending beyond the $25
limit.
On Monday of this week the
Judicial Council invalidated the
first primary in response to these
charges and also because it felt
that the candidates had not been
informed of election rules until
well after the campaigning had
begun.
