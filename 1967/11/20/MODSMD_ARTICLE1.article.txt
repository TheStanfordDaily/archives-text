# Stanford Forfeits Axe In Big Game Debacle
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
Stanford football fans had pos
session of the axe for three
hours Saturday before surrend
ering the prized weapon to the
California football team and
thousands of Cal rooters after
the Golden Bears' 26-3 victory
over the Indians in this year's
Big Game.
Cal officials had returned the
axe to Stanford shortly before
the game; but at the final gun
Bear fans poured over the field,
destroying the goal posts and
shouting, "We've got the Axe,"
before massing in front of the
Card rooting section for the
presentation.
The pre-game activities were
highlighted by the appearance
of a half dozen parachutists who
landed in Stanford Stadium. All
but one of the jumpers landed
on target in the football field.
The other one managed to soften
his bad landing by hitting the
Cal band.
A riot nearly broke out be
tween the two bands over an in
cident involving some missing
Stanford band hats. The situa
tion was quickly brought under
control by men placed along the
sidelines to prevent any direct

confrontations of rival musi
cians.
The Stanford loss brought to
a close an unprecedented six
year winning streak and cast a
definite gloom over post-game
festivities on the Farm.
Despite the fact-that the In
dians went into the game six
point favorites, Coach John Ral-
Fton had repeatedly pointed out
that the two teams were evenly
matched. Ralston proved to be
more than right as "Seven in
'67" turned out to be the Indians'
unlucky number.
California's sophomore quar
terback Randy Humphries threw
two final quarter touchdown
passes within 22 seconds and ran
for another one to lead the
Bears to their first Big Game vic
tory since 1960. Back-of-the-Game
Humphries completed 14 passes
for 170 yards during the after
noon.
Fourth Quarter Score
Stanford went into the locker
room at half time with a 3-2
lead and was only trailing by a
score of 5-3 as the third period
came to a close, but the Bears
were already knocking on the
door to the Indian goal. A Card
punt was taken with a minute

left in the third quarter and run
back to the Indian 45.
As the quarter ended Hum
phries hit end Wayne Stewart
with a pass nine yards from the
Stanford goal. On the first play
of the final quarter Stewart re
ceived another Humphries pass,
this one good for the score. The
extra point made it 12-3.
Cal Goes In Again
Jon Huss took the kickoff in
the endzone and ran it back to
the Indian 21. On the first play
from scrimmage Nate Kirtman
fumbled the ball into the air;
it was recovered by Cal defen
sive end Mike McCaffrey.
Humphries threw a pass for
Stewart which fell incomplete
before he connected to his other
end, Jim Calkins. Calkins caught
the ball on the three and stumb
led into the endzone. The extra
point kick gave the Bears their
fourteenth point in 22 seconds.
Williams And The Shotgun
Trailing by 16 points Coach
John Ralston tried to rally the
Indians by returning quarter
back Chuck Williams to the line
up. Williams, who was injured
against Washington, was still
unable to run with the ball. He
quarterbacked the Cards from
a shotgun position.

The Indians made only short
advances with this limited of
fense. Jon Huss exploded for
one long run of 33 yards off
the shotgun, but this drive and
the next Indian series of downs
failed. I passes and
Williams' inability to run when
the opportunity presented itself
killed the drive.
Cal got the ball for the last
time with 4:51 left in the game.
Starting from their own 46 yard
line they drove 54 yards to score
a final touchdown. The running
of halfback John Fowler and
fullback John McGaffle allowed
the Golden Bears to penetrate
deep into Stanford territory.
Humphries hit Stewart on the
Card 20 for a gain of 11 and then
threw to McGaffle three plays
later to take the ball down to
the 5. Humphries ran keepers on
the next two plays, breaking
into the goal with only 6 sec
onds left in the game. Ron Miller
converted for the third consecu
tive time making the score 26-3.
Indians Score First
The second Stanford series of
the game started on the Card 23-
yard line. Marquess hit Gene
Washington for a 30 yard gain
and then threw to him again for
12. The drive stalled on the Cal

35, and Bill Shoemaker came in
to try a field goal. The attempt
was wide and to the right.
The Indians quickly got the
ball back and starting from the
44 marched to the Cal 16. The big
break in this series was a 15-yard
clipping penalty called against
Cal as Stanford was punting. The
penalty allowed the Cards to
retain possession.
The drive stalled at the 16,
but Shoemaker put the Indians
on the scoreboard by booting a
33 yard field goal with Mar
quess holding.

The Card kickoff was taken
by George Gearhart and run
back to the Cal 26. Humphries,
Fowler, and McGaffle took the
ball down to the Stanford 13 as
the quarter ended. On the first
play of the second quarter
Fowler went into the middle for
a two yard gain, but offensive
holding was called against the
Bears. The ball was moved back
to the Stanford 26.
Two plays later Humphries
threw to Fowler who made a
diving catch on the Indian 6. On
the next play defensive tackle

Blaine Nye trapped Fowler in
the Bear backfield for a loss of
three.
Humphries then gave the ball
to Fowler who tried to throw a
pass. The ball was intercepted by
Indian defensive back Dick Oli

ver just in front of the goalline.
Oliver downed the ball in the
endzone for a seeming touch
back. But the referees called
Oliver for stepping into the end
zone and ruled it a safety, giv
ing Cal 2 points.

After the safety Shoemaker's
free kick was returned to the
Indian 49 by Lloyd Reist. The
Bears drove down to the Stan
ford 20 where Miller missed a
field goal attempt.
Miller got another chance for

a 3-pointer late in the third quar
ter. Linemart-of-the-Game Jim
Fetherston picked up a Jon Huss
fumble on the Indian 41. Cal pro

ceeded to drive downfield to the
Stanford 7 where Miller gave the
Bears the lead for the first time,
5-3.

came to a close, but the Bears
were already knocking on the
door to the Indian goal. A Card
punt was taken with a minute

left in the third quarter and run
back to the Indian 45.
As the quarter ended Hum
phries hit end Wayne Stewart
with a pass nine yards from the
Stanford goal. On the first play
of the final quarter Stewart re
ceived another Humphries pass,
this one good for the score. The
extra point made it 12-3.
Cal Goes In Again
Jon Huss took the kickoff in
the endzone and ran it back to
the Indian 21. On the first play
from scrimmage Nate Kirtman
fumbled the ball into the air;
it was recovered by Cal defen
sive end Mike McCaffrey.
Humphries threw a pass for
Stewart which fell incomplete
before he connected to his other
end, Jim Calkins. Calkins caught
the ball on the three and stumb
led into the endzone. The extra
point kick gave the Bears their
fourteenth point in 22 seconds.
Williams And The Shotgun
Trailing by 16 points Coach
John Ralston tried to rally the
Indians by returning quarter
back Chuck Williams to the line
up. Williams, who was injured
against Washington, was still
unable to run with the ball. He
quarterbacked the Cards from
a shotgun position.

The Indians made only short
advances with this limited of
fense. Jon Huss exploded for
one long run of 33 yards off
the shotgun, but this drive and
the next Indian series of downs
failed. I passes and
Williams' inability to run when
the opportunity presented itself
killed the drive.
Cal got the ball for the last
time with 4:51 left in the game.
Starting from their own 46 yard
line they drove 54 yards to score
a final touchdown. The running
of halfback John Fowler and
fullback John McGaffle allowed
the Golden Bears to penetrate
deep into Stanford territory.
Humphries hit Stewart on the
Card 20 for a gain of 11 and then
threw to McGaffle three plays
later to take the ball down to
the 5. Humphries ran keepers on
the next two plays, breaking
into the goal with only 6 sec
onds left in the game. Ron Miller
converted for the third consecu
tive time making the score 26-3.

to try a field goal. The attempt
was wide and to the right.
The Indians quickly got the
ball back and starting from the
44 marched to the Cal 16. The big
break in this series was a 15-yard
clipping penalty called against
Cal as Stanford was punting. The
penalty allowed the Cards to
retain possession.
The drive stalled at the 16,
but Shoemaker put the Indians
on the scoreboard by booting a
33 yard field goal with Mar
quess holding.

The Card kickoff was taken
by George Gearhart and run
back to the Cal 26. Humphries,
Fowler, and McGaffle took the
ball down to the Stanford 13 as
the quarter ended. On the first
play of the second quarter
Fowler went into the middle for
a two yard gain, but offensive
holding was called against the
Bears. The ball was moved back
to the Stanford 26.
Two plays later Humphries
threw to Fowler who made a
diving catch on the Indian 6. On
the next play defensive tackle

Blaine Nye trapped Fowler in
the Bear backfield for a loss of
three.
Humphries then gave the ball
to Fowler who tried to throw a
pass. The ball was intercepted by
Indian defensive back Dick Oli

ver just in front of the goalline.
Oliver downed the ball in the
endzone for a seeming touch
back. But the referees called
Oliver for stepping into the end
zone and ruled it a safety, giv
ing Cal 2 points.

After the safety Shoemaker's
free kick was returned to the
Indian 49 by Lloyd Reist. The
Bears drove down to the Stan
ford 20 where Miller missed a
field goal attempt.
Miller got another chance for

a 3-pointer late in the third quar
ter. Linemart-of-the-Game Jim
Fetherston picked up a Jon Huss
fumble on the Indian 41. Cal pro

Stanford 7 where Miller gave the
Bears the lead for the first time,
5-3.

California football team and
thousands of Cal rooters after
the Golden Bears' 26-3 victory
over the Indians in this year's
Big Game.

Bear fans poured over the field,

35, and Bill Shoemaker came in
to try a field goal. The attempt
was wide and to the right.
The Indians quickly got the
ball back and starting from the
44 marched to the Cal 16. The big
break in this series was a 15-yard
clipping penalty called against
Cal as Stanford was punting. The
penalty allowed the Cards to
retain possession.
The drive stalled at the 16,
but Shoemaker put the Indians
on the scoreboard by booting a
33 yard field goal with Mar
quess holding.

The Card kickoff was taken
by George Gearhart and run
back to the Cal 26. Humphries,
Fowler, and McGaffle took the
ball down to the Stanford 13 as
the quarter ended. On the first
play of the second quarter
Fowler went into the middle for
a two yard gain, but offensive
holding was called against the
Bears. The ball was moved back
to the Stanford 26.
Two plays later Humphries
threw to Fowler who made a
diving catch on the Indian 6. On
the next play defensive tackle

Blaine Nye trapped Fowler in
the Bear backfield for a loss of
three.
Humphries then gave the ball
to Fowler who tried to throw a
pass. The ball was intercepted by
Indian defensive back Dick Oli

ver just in front of the goalline.
Oliver downed the ball in the
endzone for a seeming touch
back. But the referees called
Oliver for stepping into the end
zone and ruled it a safety, giv
ing Cal 2 points.

After the safety Shoemaker's
free kick was returned to the
Indian 49 by Lloyd Reist. The
Bears drove down to the Stan
ford 20 where Miller missed a
field goal attempt.
Miller got another chance for

a 3-pointer late in the third quar
ter. Linemart-of-the-Game Jim
Fetherston picked up a Jon Huss
fumble on the Indian 41. Cal pro

ceeded to drive downfield to the
Stanford 7 where Miller gave the
Bears the lead for the first time,
5-3.

Stanford football fans had pos
session of the axe for three
hours Saturday before surrend
ering the prized weapon to the
California football team and
thousands of Cal rooters after
the Golden Bears' 26-3 victory
over the Indians in this year's
Big Game.
Cal officials had returned the
axe to Stanford shortly before
the game; but at the final gun
Bear fans poured over the field,
destroying the goal posts and
shouting, "We've got the Axe,"
before massing in front of the
Card rooting section for the
presentation.
The pre-game activities were
highlighted by the appearance
of a half dozen parachutists who
landed in Stanford Stadium. All
but one of the jumpers landed
on target in the football field.
The other one managed to soften
his bad landing by hitting the
Cal band.
A riot nearly broke out be
tween the two bands over an in
cident involving some missing
Stanford band hats. The situa
tion was quickly brought under
control by men placed along the
sidelines to prevent any direct

confrontations of rival musi
cians.
The Stanford loss brought to
a close an unprecedented six
year winning streak and cast a
definite gloom over post-game
festivities on the Farm.
Despite the fact-that the In
dians went into the game six
point favorites, Coach John Ral-
Fton had repeatedly pointed out
that the two teams were evenly
matched. Ralston proved to be
more than right as "Seven in
'67" turned out to be the Indians'
unlucky number.
California's sophomore quar
terback Randy Humphries threw
two final quarter touchdown
passes within 22 seconds and ran
for another one to lead the
Bears to their first Big Game vic
tory since 1960. Back-of-the-Game
Humphries completed 14 passes
for 170 yards during the after
noon.
Fourth Quarter Score
Stanford went into the locker
room at half time with a 3-2
lead and was only trailing by a
score of 5-3 as the third period
came to a close, but the Bears
were already knocking on the
door to the Indian goal. A Card
punt was taken with a minute

left in the third quarter and run
back to the Indian 45.
As the quarter ended Hum
phries hit end Wayne Stewart
with a pass nine yards from the
Stanford goal. On the first play
of the final quarter Stewart re
ceived another Humphries pass,
this one good for the score. The
extra point made it 12-3.
Cal Goes In Again
Jon Huss took the kickoff in
the endzone and ran it back to
the Indian 21. On the first play
from scrimmage Nate Kirtman
fumbled the ball into the air;
it was recovered by Cal defen
sive end Mike McCaffrey.
Humphries threw a pass for
Stewart which fell incomplete
before he connected to his other
end, Jim Calkins. Calkins caught
the ball on the three and stumb
led into the endzone. The extra
point kick gave the Bears their
fourteenth point in 22 seconds.
Williams And The Shotgun
Trailing by 16 points Coach
John Ralston tried to rally the
Indians by returning quarter
back Chuck Williams to the line
up. Williams, who was injured
against Washington, was still
unable to run with the ball. He
quarterbacked the Cards from
a shotgun position.

The Indians made only short
advances with this limited of
fense. Jon Huss exploded for
one long run of 33 yards off
the shotgun, but this drive and
the next Indian series of downs
failed. I passes and
Williams' inability to run when
the opportunity presented itself
killed the drive.
Cal got the ball for the last
time with 4:51 left in the game.
Starting from their own 46 yard
line they drove 54 yards to score
a final touchdown. The running
of halfback John Fowler and
fullback John McGaffle allowed
the Golden Bears to penetrate
deep into Stanford territory.
Humphries hit Stewart on the
Card 20 for a gain of 11 and then

Stanford football fans had pos
session of the axe for three
hours Saturday before surrend
ering the prized weapon to the
California football team and
thousands of Cal rooters after
the Golden Bears' 26-3 victory
over the Indians in this year's
Big Game.
Cal officials had returned the
axe to Stanford shortly before
the game; but at the final gun
Bear fans poured over the field,
destroying the goal posts and
shouting, "We've got the Axe,"
before massing in front of the
Card rooting section for the
presentation.
The pre-game activities were
highlighted by the appearance
of a half dozen parachutists who
landed in Stanford Stadium. All
but one of the jumpers landed
on target in the football field.
The other one managed to soften
his bad landing by hitting the
Cal band.
A riot nearly broke out be
tween the two bands over an in
cident involving some missing
Stanford band hats. The situa
tion was quickly brought under
control by men placed along the
sidelines to prevent any direct

confrontations of rival musi
cians.
The Stanford loss brought to
a close an unprecedented six
year winning streak and cast a
definite gloom over post-game
festivities on the Farm.
Despite the fact-that the In
dians went into the game six
point favorites, Coach John Ral-
Fton had repeatedly pointed out
that the two teams were evenly
matched. Ralston proved to be
more than right as "Seven in
'67" turned out to be the Indians'
unlucky number.
California's sophomore quar
terback Randy Humphries threw
two final quarter touchdown
passes within 22 seconds and ran
for another one to lead the
Bears to their first Big Game vic
tory since 1960. Back-of-the-Game
Humphries completed 14 passes
for 170 yards during the after
noon.
Fourth Quarter Score
Stanford went into the locker
room at half time with a 3-2
lead and was only trailing by a
score of 5-3 as the third period
came to a close, but the Bears
were already knocking on the
door to the Indian goal. A Card
punt was taken with a minute

left in the third quarter and run
back to the Indian 45.
As the quarter ended Hum
phries hit end Wayne Stewart
with a pass nine yards from the
Stanford goal. On the first play
of the final quarter Stewart re
ceived another Humphries pass,
this one good for the score. The
extra point made it 12-3.
Cal Goes In Again
Jon Huss took the kickoff in
the endzone and ran it back to
the Indian 21. On the first play
from scrimmage Nate Kirtman
fumbled the ball into the air;
it was recovered by Cal defen
sive end Mike McCaffrey.
Humphries threw a pass for
Stewart which fell incomplete
before he connected to his other
end, Jim Calkins. Calkins caught
the ball on the three and stumb
led into the endzone. The extra
point kick gave the Bears their
fourteenth point in 22 seconds.
Williams And The Shotgun
Trailing by 16 points Coach
John Ralston tried to rally the
Indians by returning quarter
back Chuck Williams to the line
up. Williams, who was injured
against Washington, was still
unable to run with the ball. He
quarterbacked the Cards from
a shotgun position.

The Indians made only short
advances with this limited of
fense. Jon Huss exploded for
one long run of 33 yards off
the shotgun, but this drive and
the next Indian series of downs
failed. I passes and
Williams' inability to run when
the opportunity presented itself
killed the drive.
Cal got the ball for the last
time with 4:51 left in the game.
Starting from their own 46 yard
line they drove 54 yards to score
a final touchdown. The running
of halfback John Fowler and
fullback John McGaffle allowed
the Golden Bears to penetrate
deep into Stanford territory.
Humphries hit Stewart on the
Card 20 for a gain of 11 and then
threw to McGaffle three plays
later to take the ball down to
the 5. Humphries ran keepers on
the next two plays, breaking
into the goal with only 6 sec
onds left in the game. Ron Miller
converted for the third consecu
tive time making the score 26-3.
Indians Score First

the game started on the Card 23-

Washington for a 30 yard gain
and then threw to him again for

35, and Bill Shoemaker came in
to try a field goal. The attempt
was wide and to the right.
The Indians quickly got the
ball back and starting from the
44 marched to the Cal 16. The big
break in this series was a 15-yard
clipping penalty called against
Cal as Stanford was punting. The
penalty allowed the Cards to
retain possession.
The drive stalled at the 16,
but Shoemaker put the Indians
on the scoreboard by booting a
33 yard field goal with Mar
quess holding.

The Card kickoff was taken
by George Gearhart and run
back to the Cal 26. Humphries,
Fowler, and McGaffle took the
ball down to the Stanford 13 as
the quarter ended. On the first
play of the second quarter
Fowler went into the middle for
a two yard gain, but offensive
holding was called against the
Bears. The ball was moved back
to the Stanford 26.

threw to Fowler who made a
