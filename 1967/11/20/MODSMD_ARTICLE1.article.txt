# Stanford Forfeits Axe In Big Game Debacle
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
Stanford football fans had pos
session of the axe for three
hours Saturday before surrend
ering the prized weapon to the
California football team and
thousands of Cal rooters after
the Golden Bears' 26-3 victory
over the Indians in this year's
Big Game.
Cal officials had returned the
axe to Stanford shortly before
the game; but at the final gun
Bear fans poured over the field,
destroying the goal posts and
shouting, "We've got the Axe,"
before massing in front of the
Card rooting section for the
presentation.
The pre-game activities were
highlighted by the appearance
of a half dozen parachutists who
landed in Stanford Stadium. All
but one of the jumpers landed
on target in the football field.
The other one managed to soften
his bad landing by hitting the
Cal band.
A riot nearly broke out be
tween the two bands over an in
cident involving some missing
Stanford band hats. The situa
tion was quickly brought under
control by men placed along the
sidelines to prevent any direct

confrontations of rival musi
cians.
The Stanford loss brought to
a close an unprecedented six
year winning streak and cast a
definite gloom over post-game
festivities on the Farm.
Despite the fact-that the In
dians went into the game six
point favorites, Coach John Ral-
Fton had repeatedly pointed out
that the two teams were evenly
matched. Ralston proved to be
more than right as "Seven in
'67" turned out to be the Indians'
unlucky number.
California's sophomore quar
terback Randy Humphries threw
two final quarter touchdown
passes within 22 seconds and ran
for another one to lead the
Bears to their first Big Game vic
tory since 1960. Back-of-the-Game
Humphries completed 14 passes
for 170 yards during the after
noon.
Fourth Quarter Score
Stanford went into the locker
room at half time with a 3-2
lead and was only trailing by a
score of 5-3 as the third period
came to a close, but the Bears
were already knocking on the
door to the Indian goal. A Card
punt was taken with a minute

left in the third quarter and run
back to the Indian 45.
As the quarter ended Hum
phries hit end Wayne Stewart
with a pass nine yards from the
Stanford goal. On the first play
of the final quarter Stewart re
ceived another Humphries pass,
this one good for the score. The
extra point made it 12-3.
Cal Goes In Again
Jon Huss took the kickoff in
the endzone and ran it back to
the Indian 21. On the first play
from scrimmage Nate Kirtman
fumbled the ball into the air;
it was recovered by Cal defen
sive end Mike McCaffrey.
Humphries threw a pass for
Stewart which fell incomplete
before he connected to his other
end, Jim Calkins. Calkins caught
the ball on the three and stumb
led into the endzone. The extra
point kick gave the Bears their
fourteenth point in 22 seconds.
Williams And The Shotgun
Trailing by 16 points Coach
John Ralston tried to rally the
Indians by returning quarter
back Chuck Williams to the line
up. Williams, who was injured
against Washington, was still
unable to run with the ball. He
quarterbacked the Cards from
a shotgun position.

The Indians made only short
advances with this limited of
fense. Jon Huss exploded for
one long run of 33 yards off
the shotgun, but this drive and
the next Indian series of downs
failed. I passes and
Williams' inability to run when
the opportunity presented itself
killed the drive.
Cal got the ball for the last
time with 4:51 left in the game.
Starting from their own 46 yard
line they drove 54 yards to score
a final touchdown. The running
of halfback John Fowler and
fullback John McGaffle allowed
the Golden Bears to penetrate
deep into Stanford territory.
Humphries hit Stewart on the
Card 20 for a gain of 11 and then
threw to McGaffle three plays
later to take the ball down to
the 5. Humphries ran keepers on
the next two plays, breaking
into the goal with only 6 sec
onds left in the game. Ron Miller
converted for the third consecu
tive time making the score 26-3.
Indians Score First
The second Stanford series of
the game started on the Card 23-
yard line. Marquess hit Gene
Washington for a 30 yard gain
and then threw to him again for
12. The drive stalled on the Cal
