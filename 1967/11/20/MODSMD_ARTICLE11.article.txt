## How Many Of Us? 
### 
At about 11 this morning the population of
the United States will pass the 200 million
mark.
In past years, this might have been the occa
sion for intense celebration over the health and
prosperity of the nation. However, in light of an
ever-increasing world population, it is a time
for thoughtful action.
But action must be firmly based in a concern
for the welfare of all peoples. Somehow we
must strive to understand who man is, how he
may find a more meaningful life, and why an
ever-increasing population is a threat to man.
With this understanding, we can define how
and why the population is to be controlled.
This understanding will affect all our deci
sions. The decision of a couple to limit the size
of their family will be directed toward raising

their children as full and complete human be
ings. To limit one's family in order to preserve
one's own personal wealth may well he more
destructive to the children if they take this as
the parents' prime motivation.
The responsibility and understanding neces
sary for effective population control is now des
perately needed in America.
The story has been told of a noted demo
grapher who addressed an audience of civic
leaders on the problem of overpopulation.
"Somewhere in this world," he said, "a woman
gives birth every three seconds."
At this, one of his listeners stood up and re
marked, "Well, I think we should find that
woman and put an end to this outrage."
At least, we must admit, the man was think
ing of concrete solutions.
