# Elections Lesson

### 
In case you didn't notice it amid the tumult
of Big Game Week, Stanford's student govern
ment went through another one of its periodic
elections foul-ups.
The problem came in the head yell leader
primaries Nov. 8 and 9, which were invalidated
by the Judicial Council. As a result, the over
worked elections commission was forced to hold
a new primary for the eight candidates Nov. 15
and 16. The run-off election for the two finalists
is today and to morrow.
No matter how important or unimportant one
regards the position of head yell leader, the ir
responsible conduct of the election and its ques

tionable invalidation by the Judicial Council
should arouse concern. When the student gov
ernment has taken on the responsibility of or
ganizing an election, the least it can do is con
duct it in an orderly and sane fashion.
The lessons of the fiasco are these: The ASSU
by-laws governing elections are unrealistic, the
elections commissioner must adhere strictly to
proper procedure (and not count ballots in his
fraternity house); and the Judicial Council
should not let its collective contempt for the
value of the yell leader office influence it to in
validate an election against the best interests of
those students, the electorate, who really care
who the next head yell leader may be.
