# Another Attempt
## The 						Golden Coolie Boot Quest 
### Herbie Hinckes 
The Golden Coolie Boot. Men
lust lor its power and the
chance to try it on just once.
For the man who can make it lit
his foot will be the next presi
dent of Stanford University, ac
cording to a decree laid down by
Jane Stanford, shortly after
President Wallace Tarnished an
nounced he would retire.
Mrs. Stanford's dictum named
two of the University's most
prominent men, President Tar
nished and Provost Richard
Truthman, to a committee to
find Stanford's next president.
Still carrying the Golden Coolie
Hoot, the Troubled Twosome
continue their quest.

Stumbling along in the dark
near Stanford Stadium, Truth
man begged Tarnished, "Let's
sit down for a minute, it's been
a hard night."
"I imagine we can pause for
a moment on our Quest," Tar
nished agreed. The two sat down
in a pile of football tickets, left
by the hoard of Large Game

fans a few hours before. "We
must have rung 200 doorbells
tonight."
"But nobody's foot fit the
Golden Coolie Boot," Truthman
moaned.
They saw a dark figure walk
ing toward them.
"Watch out, President Tar
nished, it might be a student."
"It's covered with tar and
feathers," Tarnished exclaimed
as the figure drew closer.
"You two guys know how to
play football?" the mysterious
figure asked.
"It's Coach Dog Ciao," Truth
man said.
"Oh. President Tarnished and
Provost Truthman, I'm sorry I
didn't recognize you in the dark
ness. I'm sorry," Coach Ciao
said. He started to walk off.
"Wait a minute, Coach. Why
did you ask us if we could play
football? And why are you wear
ing all that tar and feathers?"
"I'm looking lor a football
team," Coach Ciao said. "Isn't
there anybody on this campus

who can play football?" He
brushed a few feathers off his
dark blue suit. "These came
from a group of alumni who
cornered me after the Large
Game today."
"You know how those old
grads can be, Coach," Tarnished
chucklcd. "You're just lucky
none of them knew how to make
a noose."
"I'm afraid I'm going to lose
my job," Coach Ciao groaned.
"That's why I'm looking for a
team." He looked down near
where Tarnished was sitting.
"Say, what's this?" he queried,
picking up the Golden Coolie
Boot.
"Try it on if you want," Tar
nished remarked. "It won't fit
you."
Ciao sat down and slipped the
Golden Coolie Boot on his boot,
stood up and kicked a nearby
football with it. "That's one heil
of a Golden Coolie Boot. Wish it
had some spikes, though."
"What do you mean "a" Gold
en Coolie Boot. That's the Gold
en Coolie Boot, the only Golden
Coolie Boot, and not a mere de
vice. And besides, you aren't go
ing to put any spikes on it,"
Tarnished said.
Truthman was becoming hys

terical. "It fits, it fits. He put it
on and it fits."
"So it does," Tarnished noted.
"Well, Coach, how would you
like to be the next president
of . .
"Hold it, President Tarnished,
let me talk to you for a minute
before you do anything hasty."
Truthman led Tarnished be
hind a nearby soft drink stand.
"We can't have a football coach
as president of the university.
It would hurt our reputation,"
he whispered.
"I used to be a football coach,"
Tarnished said.
"I know, but Coach Ciao
doesn't have any academic ex
perience."
"Well, I was working in a li
brary when Stanford picked
me," Tarnished reminded him.
"He's just not the kind of man
we want, President Tarnished.
He wouldn't fit in as president."
"Are you kidding? His foot
sure seems to fit into that Gold
en Coolie Boot."
"It's not who the shoe fits that
counts, it's who fits the shoe.
Please don't ask him to be presi
dent."
"If it will make you happy.
But if we never find a president,
it's going to be all your fault."

"It's not who the shoe fits that
counts, it's who fits the shoe.
Please don't ask him to be presi
dent."
"If it will make you happy.
But if we never find a president,
it's going to be all your fault."
The Golden Coolie Boot. Men
lust lor its power and the
chance to try it on just once.
For the man who can make it lit
his foot will be the next presi
dent of Stanford University, ac
cording to a decree laid down by
Jane Stanford, shortly after
President Wallace Tarnished an
nounced he would retire.
Mrs. Stanford's dictum named
two of the University's most
prominent men, President Tar
nished and Provost Richard
Truthman, to a committee to
find Stanford's next president.
Still carrying the Golden Coolie
Hoot, the Troubled Twosome
continue their quest.

Stumbling along in the dark
near Stanford Stadium, Truth
man begged Tarnished, "Let's
sit down for a minute, it's been
a hard night."
"I imagine we can pause for
a moment on our Quest," Tar
nished agreed. The two sat down
in a pile of football tickets, left
by the hoard of Large Game

fans a few hours before. "We
must have rung 200 doorbells
tonight."
"But nobody's foot fit the
Golden Coolie Boot," Truthman
moaned.
They saw a dark figure walk
ing toward them.
"Watch out, President Tar
nished, it might be a student."
"It's covered with tar and
feathers," Tarnished exclaimed
as the figure drew closer.
"You two guys know how to
play football?" the mysterious
figure asked.
"It's Coach Dog Ciao," Truth
man said.
"Oh. President Tarnished and
Provost Truthman, I'm sorry I
didn't recognize you in the dark
ness. I'm sorry," Coach Ciao
said. He started to walk off.
"Wait a minute, Coach. Why
did you ask us if we could play
football? And why are you wear
ing all that tar and feathers?"
"I'm looking lor a football
team," Coach Ciao said. "Isn't
there anybody on this campus

who can play football?" He
brushed a few feathers off his
dark blue suit. "These came
from a group of alumni who
cornered me after the Large
Game today."
"You know how those old
grads can be, Coach," Tarnished
chucklcd. "You're just lucky
none of them knew how to make
a noose."
"I'm afraid I'm going to lose
my job," Coach Ciao groaned.
"That's why I'm looking for a
team." He looked down near
where Tarnished was sitting.
"Say, what's this?" he queried,
picking up the Golden Coolie
Boot.
"Try it on if you want," Tar
nished remarked. "It won't fit
you."
Ciao sat down and slipped the
Golden Coolie Boot on his boot,
stood up and kicked a nearby
football with it. "That's one heil
of a Golden Coolie Boot. Wish it
had some spikes, though."
"What do you mean "a" Gold
en Coolie Boot. That's the Gold
en Coolie Boot, the only Golden
Coolie Boot, and not a mere de
vice. And besides, you aren't go
ing to put any spikes on it,"
Tarnished said.
Truthman was becoming hys

terical. "It fits, it fits. He put it
on and it fits."
"So it does," Tarnished noted.
"Well, Coach, how would you
like to be the next president
of . .
"Hold it, President Tarnished,
let me talk to you for a minute
before you do anything hasty."
Truthman led Tarnished be
hind a nearby soft drink stand.
"We can't have a football coach
as president of the university.
It would hurt our reputation,"
he whispered.
"I used to be a football coach,"
Tarnished said.
"I know, but Coach Ciao
doesn't have any academic ex
perience."
"Well, I was working in a li
brary when Stanford picked
me," Tarnished reminded him.
"He's just not the kind of man
we want, President Tarnished.
He wouldn't fit in as president."
"Are you kidding? His foot
sure seems to fit into that Gold
en Coolie Boot."
"It's not who the shoe fits that
counts, it's who fits the shoe.
Please don't ask him to be presi

"He's just not the kind of man
we want, President Tarnished.
He wouldn't fit in as president."
"Are you kidding? His foot
sure seems to fit into that Gold
en Coolie Boot."
"It's not who the shoe fits that
counts, it's who fits the shoe.
Please don't ask him to be presi
dent."
"If it will make you happy.
But if we never find a president,
it's going to be all your fault."
The Golden Coolie Boot. Men
lust lor its power and the
chance to try it on just once.
For the man who can make it lit
his foot will be the next presi
dent of Stanford University, ac
cording to a decree laid down by
Jane Stanford, shortly after
President Wallace Tarnished an
nounced he would retire.
Mrs. Stanford's dictum named
two of the University's most
prominent men, President Tar
nished and Provost Richard
Truthman, to a committee to
find Stanford's next president.
Still carrying the Golden Coolie
Hoot, the Troubled Twosome
continue their quest.

Stumbling along in the dark
near Stanford Stadium, Truth
man begged Tarnished, "Let's
sit down for a minute, it's been
a hard night."
"I imagine we can pause for
a moment on our Quest," Tar
nished agreed. The two sat down
in a pile of football tickets, left
by the hoard of Large Game

fans a few hours before. "We
must have rung 200 doorbells
tonight."
"But nobody's foot fit the
Golden Coolie Boot," Truthman
moaned.
They saw a dark figure walk
ing toward them.
"Watch out, President Tar
nished, it might be a student."
"It's covered with tar and
feathers," Tarnished exclaimed
as the figure drew closer.
"You two guys know how to
play football?" the mysterious
figure asked.
"It's Coach Dog Ciao," Truth
man said.
"Oh. President Tarnished and
Provost Truthman, I'm sorry I
didn't recognize you in the dark
ness. I'm sorry," Coach Ciao
said. He started to walk off.
"Wait a minute, Coach. Why
did you ask us if we could play
football? And why are you wear
ing all that tar and feathers?"
"I'm looking lor a football
team," Coach Ciao said. "Isn't
there anybody on this campus

who can play football?" He
brushed a few feathers off his
dark blue suit. "These came
from a group of alumni who
cornered me after the Large
Game today."
"You know how those old
grads can be, Coach," Tarnished
chucklcd. "You're just lucky
none of them knew how to make
a noose."
"I'm afraid I'm going to lose
my job," Coach Ciao groaned.
"That's why I'm looking for a
team." He looked down near
where Tarnished was sitting.
"Say, what's this?" he queried,
picking up the Golden Coolie
Boot.
"Try it on if you want," Tar
nished remarked. "It won't fit
you."
Ciao sat down and slipped the
Golden Coolie Boot on his boot,
stood up and kicked a nearby
football with it. "That's one heil
of a Golden Coolie Boot. Wish it
had some spikes, though."
"What do you mean "a" Gold
en Coolie Boot. That's the Gold
en Coolie Boot, the only Golden
Coolie Boot, and not a mere de
vice. And besides, you aren't go
ing to put any spikes on it,"
Tarnished said.
Truthman was becoming hys

terical. "It fits, it fits. He put it
on and it fits."
"So it does," Tarnished noted.
"Well, Coach, how would you
like to be the next president
of . .
"Hold it, President Tarnished,
let me talk to you for a minute
before you do anything hasty."
Truthman led Tarnished be
hind a nearby soft drink stand.
"We can't have a football coach
as president of the university.
It would hurt our reputation,"
he whispered.
"I used to be a football coach,"
Tarnished said.
"I know, but Coach Ciao
doesn't have any academic ex
perience."
"Well, I was working in a li
brary when Stanford picked
me," Tarnished reminded him.
"He's just not the kind of man
we want, President Tarnished.
He wouldn't fit in as president."
"Are you kidding? His foot
sure seems to fit into that Gold
