# The 						James B. Briscoe Memorial Edition
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning James B. Briscoe, 22, hops into his hat
tered 1960 Pontiae and starts his drive home to Hollis, Okla
homa. After a few days with his family he will report for
active duty as a second lieutenant in the Army, with Vietnam
a possible destination.
Briscoe came to Stanford from Oklahoma as a freshman in
September, 1963. Before long he was working- on The Stanford
Daily, beginning an extraordinary career during which he
worked on nine consecutive volumes. Although never elected
editor, Briscoe served as managing editor, associate editor,
feature editor, editorial associate, personnel director and
founded the Stanford Daily Magazine.
Briscoe received his degree in mathematics last June but
stayed on at The Daily to conduct a training program for new
staff members. It took a call-up order from the U.S. Army to
separate Briscoe from The Daily.
Volume 152, number 42, of this newspaper is The James B.
Briscoe Memorial Edition.
Memorial of what? His popularity among the staff? No.
Briscoe was a hard-driving staffer who didn't hesitate to criti
cize. Great, memorable popularity he neither sought nor
achieved.
Briscoe did give The Stanford Daily more than four years
of hard work and enthusiasm. As an expert in technical as
pects of newspaper production, he made lasting improvements
in the format of The Daily. He trained separate "generations"
of staffers, including the present editor and news editor. But
this issue is dedicated to something else.
Briscoe believed in the fundamental commitment of a news
paper — even a college newspaper — to objective news re
porting. No matter how venomously The Daily conducted its
editorial campaigns — and Briscoe managed some quite veno
mous ones — he believed that to remain valid as a newspaper
The Daily had to be honest and fair in its news reporting.
Such is the creed of a professional journalist, like Jim Briscoe.
The Daily will miss his hard work and his professionalism.
To one of our all-time great newspaper jocks, we give our
thanks.
