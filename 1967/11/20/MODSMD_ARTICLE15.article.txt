# C15 Nominee States Views On Issues
## 
### DELL MARTIN 
(Editor's Note —Before the legislature elected senior
Dell Martin a student representative on the Committee
of 15, it requested he and other nominees answer
questions on campus issues. Several of Martin's replies
are printed below. We consider his answers to be
thoughtful presentations of one side on each of these
issues.)

Q. Should Stanford be engaged in "Big Time" sports?
... I think that Stanford should participate in PAC-8
football, baseball, track and basketball so long as it
can do so successfully and so long as it remains an
economically rewarding activity for the University, but
treme favoritism in admissions nor preferential treat
ment as students. I think, of course, such flagrant
under the condition that athletes be shown neither ex
abuses of the academic community as Health Educa
tion 400 should be abolished for the few athletes who do
participate in them; I think recruiting should be abol
ished in favor of considering athletics as just another
high school extra-curricular activity: I think special
privileges for athletes, such as tutors exclusively for
athletic scholarships should be abolished. All of these
and training tables should be abolished; and I think
athleitc scholarships should be abolished. All of these
things create an athletic sub-community in the Uni
versity which defines its primary purpose in the Uni
versity as playing games in athletics.
I have no quarrel with people who choose to so live
their lives in the University. I do object to University
policies which introduce people into the University as
athletes rather than as free individuals and students
and to policies which give a special, privileged place to
any one group of students at the expense of the rest.
ROTC
Q. Do you think ROTC courses should be taught for
credit, or dropped completely?
ROTC should remain on campus only as another
club-like interest organization. I do not think it should
be given recognition as an academic department. I feel
ROTC, organized in classes with academic credit vio
lates at least two basic prerequisites of an educational
experience. First, there seems to be no basis for ap

pointment of faculty—do instructors in military science
have to meet any standards of educational achieve
ment? Does the department have control over its
faculty, or is the control more remote in the military
chain-of-command? And the teaching of military science
by officers of the United States military violates, in my
mind, the fundamental basis for education—the free
give and take of ideas, and mutual respect between
teacher and those taught for their ideas and point of
view. By retaining ROTC as a non-credit activity, no
student wishing to earn a military commission would
be deprived of that privilege; however, the more odious
factor of the University endorsing the military by ele
vating it to the stature of an academic department and
the coercive power of academic grading would be
avoided.
Fraternities
Q. Is a fraternity a valid living group in an "aca
demic" community?
My view of fraternity life has always been that it is a
repressive form of University living (in most cases,
although not all). I base this conclusion on time-honored
theories of education and for a source would refer to
Sanford's book The American College. Fraternities seem
to me to have no purpose, no common goals for the
members to pursue together, particularly no common
academic or educational goals. This means that the goal
of fraternity living centers on existing "happily," on
existing without conflicts and quarels, the stuff of edu
cation. The result is places where people go with the
idea of changing themselves into stereotypes, or when
not behaving as a stereotype they will avoid contact
with the house.
Now let me qualify my remarks. There are a great
many houses on campus which do not fit the above
description. But I suggest that they do so in spite of,
rather than because of, the form of fraternity life (par
ticularly the form of selective rush). And let me quali
fy my remarks further by saying that I never have
nor ever shal 1 advocate the abolition, by the Uni
versity, of fraternities. I do not believe in such institu
tional coercion. Those who want frats should be able
to have them (in the same way that if women wish to

live off-campus they should be able to). But it seems
to me there is a more subtle form of institutional
coercion going on in the area of residences. For the
University does not provide alternatives to the frats
which in any way answer the needs of the total under
graduate and graduate students body. The "demonstra
tion" houses speak to this need to some extent. How
ever, the only viable answer to housing, in my opinion,
is the building of high-rise, co-educational co-ops for
the use of undergraduates, graduates, and faculty on
campus. I believe that if alternatives to fraternities
exist, fraternities will perish (again, in many but cer
tainly not all instances).
Academic Community
Q. If possible could you provide us with some com
ments on your notion of what constitutes an "academic
community?"
To try to encapsule my notion of an academic com
munity in this short space and time would be impos
sible. In as many ways as possible I have tried to live
out my ideals of an academic community in my work
in Wilbur as a sponsor. The community must be the
coming together in both formal and informal situations
of teachers who are dedicated to the enrichment of the
human spirit and students who are interested in hav
ing their powers of thinking and experiencing expanded.
The community must be based on a common respect
for the ideas and abilities of the people involved, on a
willingness to be honest, open, and frank, and on a re
jection of dogmatism, a willingness to listen and to
learn. The academic community must be composed of
teachers who live out the values of honesty and integ
rity with which they approach their various disciplines
and of students who desire to achieve a critical, crea
tive, and consistent approach to human ideas and the
world around them. The community is a place in which
the student can feel his potentiality to become some
thing more than he is. It is a place both removed from
society, in which teachers and students can think and
talk in security and with honesty; and it is a place
which must be at the radical forefront of society, apply
ing the stringent criteria of integrity and clarity to the
practical affairs of men, institutions, and governments.

club-like interest organization. I do not think it should
be given recognition as an academic department. I feel
ROTC, organized in classes with academic credit vio
lates at least two basic prerequisites of an educational
experience. First, there seems to be no basis for ap

pointment of faculty—do instructors in military science
have to meet any standards of educational achieve
ment? Does the department have control over its
faculty, or is the control more remote in the military
chain-of-command? And the teaching of military science
by officers of the United States military violates, in my
mind, the fundamental basis for education—the free
give and take of ideas, and mutual respect between
teacher and those taught for their ideas and point of
view. By retaining ROTC as a non-credit activity, no
student wishing to earn a military commission would
be deprived of that privilege; however, the more odious
factor of the University endorsing the military by ele
vating it to the stature of an academic department and
the coercive power of academic grading would be
avoided.
Fraternities
Q. Is a fraternity a valid living group in an "aca
demic" community?
My view of fraternity life has always been that it is a
repressive form of University living (in most cases,
although not all). I base this conclusion on time-honored
theories of education and for a source would refer to
Sanford's book The American College. Fraternities seem
to me to have no purpose, no common goals for the
members to pursue together, particularly no common
academic or educational goals. This means that the goal
of fraternity living centers on existing "happily," on
existing without conflicts and quarels, the stuff of edu
cation. The result is places where people go with the
idea of changing themselves into stereotypes, or when
not behaving as a stereotype they will avoid contact
with the house.
Now let me qualify my remarks. There are a great
many houses on campus which do not fit the above
description. But I suggest that they do so in spite of,
rather than because of, the form of fraternity life (par
ticularly the form of selective rush). And let me quali
fy my remarks further by saying that I never have
nor ever shal 1 advocate the abolition, by the Uni
versity, of fraternities. I do not believe in such institu
tional coercion. Those who want frats should be able
to have them (in the same way that if women wish to

live off-campus they should be able to). But it seems
to me there is a more subtle form of institutional
coercion going on in the area of residences. For the
University does not provide alternatives to the frats
which in any way answer the needs of the total under
graduate and graduate students body. The "demonstra
tion" houses speak to this need to some extent. How
ever, the only viable answer to housing, in my opinion,
is the building of high-rise, co-educational co-ops for
the use of undergraduates, graduates, and faculty on
campus. I believe that if alternatives to fraternities
exist, fraternities will perish (again, in many but cer
tainly not all instances).
Academic Community
Q. If possible could you provide us with some com
ments on your notion of what constitutes an "academic
community?"
To try to encapsule my notion of an academic com
munity in this short space and time would be impos
sible. In as many ways as possible I have tried to live
out my ideals of an academic community in my work
in Wilbur as a sponsor. The community must be the
coming together in both formal and informal situations
of teachers who are dedicated to the enrichment of the
human spirit and students who are interested in hav
ing their powers of thinking and experiencing expanded.
The community must be based on a common respect
for the ideas and abilities of the people involved, on a
willingness to be honest, open, and frank, and on a re
jection of dogmatism, a willingness to listen and to
learn. The academic community must be composed of
teachers who live out the values of honesty and integ
rity with which they approach their various disciplines
and of students who desire to achieve a critical, crea
tive, and consistent approach to human ideas and the
world around them. The community is a place in which
the student can feel his potentiality to become some
thing more than he is. It is a place both removed from
society, in which teachers and students can think and
talk in security and with honesty; and it is a place
which must be at the radical forefront of society, apply
ing the stringent criteria of integrity and clarity to the
practical affairs of men, institutions, and governments.

Dell Martin a student representative on the Committee
of 15, it requested he and other nominees answer
questions on campus issues. Several of Martin's replies
are printed below. We consider his answers to be
thoughtful presentations of one side on each of these
issues.)

Q. Should Stanford be engaged in "Big Time" sports?
... I think that Stanford should participate in PAC-8
football, baseball, track and basketball so long as it
can do so successfully and so long as it remains an
economically rewarding activity for the University, but
treme favoritism in admissions nor preferential treat
ment as students. I think, of course, such flagrant
under the condition that athletes be shown neither ex
abuses of the academic community as Health Educa
tion 400 should be abolished for the few athletes who do
participate in them; I think recruiting should be abol
ished in favor of considering athletics as just another
high school extra-curricular activity: I think special
privileges for athletes, such as tutors exclusively for
athletic scholarships should be abolished. All of these
and training tables should be abolished; and I think
athleitc scholarships should be abolished. All of these
things create an athletic sub-community in the Uni
versity which defines its primary purpose in the Uni
versity as playing games in athletics.
I have no quarrel with people who choose to so live
their lives in the University. I do object to University
policies which introduce people into the University as
athletes rather than as free individuals and students
and to policies which give a special, privileged place to
any one group of students at the expense of the rest.

not behaving as a stereotype they will avoid contact
with the house.
Now let me qualify my remarks. There are a great
many houses on campus which do not fit the above
description. But I suggest that they do so in spite of,
rather than because of, the form of fraternity life (par
ticularly the form of selective rush). And let me quali
fy my remarks further by saying that I never have
nor ever shal 1 advocate the abolition, by the Uni
versity, of fraternities. I do not believe in such institu
tional coercion. Those who want frats should be able
to have them (in the same way that if women wish to

live off-campus they should be able to). But it seems
to me there is a more subtle form of institutional
coercion going on in the area of residences. For the
University does not provide alternatives to the frats
which in any way answer the needs of the total under
graduate and graduate students body. The "demonstra
tion" houses speak to this need to some extent. How
ever, the only viable answer to housing, in my opinion,
is the building of high-rise, co-educational co-ops for
the use of undergraduates, graduates, and faculty on
campus. I believe that if alternatives to fraternities
exist, fraternities will perish (again, in many but cer
tainly not all instances).
Academic Community
Q. If possible could you provide us with some com
ments on your notion of what constitutes an "academic
community?"
To try to encapsule my notion of an academic com
munity in this short space and time would be impos
sible. In as many ways as possible I have tried to live
out my ideals of an academic community in my work
in Wilbur as a sponsor. The community must be the
coming together in both formal and informal situations
of teachers who are dedicated to the enrichment of the
human spirit and students who are interested in hav
ing their powers of thinking and experiencing expanded.
The community must be based on a common respect
for the ideas and abilities of the people involved, on a
willingness to be honest, open, and frank, and on a re
jection of dogmatism, a willingness to listen and to
learn. The academic community must be composed of
teachers who live out the values of honesty and integ
rity with which they approach their various disciplines
and of students who desire to achieve a critical, crea
tive, and consistent approach to human ideas and the
world around them. The community is a place in which
the student can feel his potentiality to become some
thing more than he is. It is a place both removed from
society, in which teachers and students can think and
talk in security and with honesty; and it is a place
which must be at the radical forefront of society, apply
ing the stringent criteria of integrity and clarity to the
practical affairs of men, institutions, and governments.
(Editor's Note —Before the legislature elected senior
Dell Martin a student representative on the Committee
of 15, it requested he and other nominees answer
questions on campus issues. Several of Martin's replies
are printed below. We consider his answers to be
thoughtful presentations of one side on each of these
issues.)

Q. Should Stanford be engaged in "Big Time" sports?
... I think that Stanford should participate in PAC-8
football, baseball, track and basketball so long as it
can do so successfully and so long as it remains an
economically rewarding activity for the University, but
treme favoritism in admissions nor preferential treat
ment as students. I think, of course, such flagrant
under the condition that athletes be shown neither ex
abuses of the academic community as Health Educa
tion 400 should be abolished for the few athletes who do
participate in them; I think recruiting should be abol
ished in favor of considering athletics as just another
high school extra-curricular activity: I think special
privileges for athletes, such as tutors exclusively for
athletic scholarships should be abolished. All of these
and training tables should be abolished; and I think
athleitc scholarships should be abolished. All of these
things create an athletic sub-community in the Uni
versity which defines its primary purpose in the Uni
versity as playing games in athletics.
I have no quarrel with people who choose to so live
their lives in the University. I do object to University
policies which introduce people into the University as
athletes rather than as free individuals and students
and to policies which give a special, privileged place to
any one group of students at the expense of the rest.
ROTC
Q. Do you think ROTC courses should be taught for
credit, or dropped completely?
ROTC should remain on campus only as another
club-like interest organization. I do not think it should
be given recognition as an academic department. I feel
ROTC, organized in classes with academic credit vio
lates at least two basic prerequisites of an educational
experience. First, there seems to be no basis for ap

pointment of faculty—do instructors in military science
have to meet any standards of educational achieve
ment? Does the department have control over its
faculty, or is the control more remote in the military
chain-of-command? And the teaching of military science
by officers of the United States military violates, in my
mind, the fundamental basis for education—the free
give and take of ideas, and mutual respect between
teacher and those taught for their ideas and point of
view. By retaining ROTC as a non-credit activity, no
student wishing to earn a military commission would
be deprived of that privilege; however, the more odious
factor of the University endorsing the military by ele
vating it to the stature of an academic department and
the coercive power of academic grading would be
avoided.
Fraternities
Q. Is a fraternity a valid living group in an "aca
demic" community?
My view of fraternity life has always been that it is a
repressive form of University living (in most cases,
although not all). I base this conclusion on time-honored
theories of education and for a source would refer to
Sanford's book The American College. Fraternities seem
to me to have no purpose, no common goals for the
members to pursue together, particularly no common
academic or educational goals. This means that the goal
of fraternity living centers on existing "happily," on
existing without conflicts and quarels, the stuff of edu
cation. The result is places where people go with the
idea of changing themselves into stereotypes, or when
not behaving as a stereotype they will avoid contact
with the house.
Now let me qualify my remarks. There are a great
many houses on campus which do not fit the above

coming together in both formal and informal situations
of teachers who are dedicated to the enrichment of the
human spirit and students who are interested in hav
ing their powers of thinking and experiencing expanded.
The community must be based on a common respect
for the ideas and abilities of the people involved, on a
willingness to be honest, open, and frank, and on a re
jection of dogmatism, a willingness to listen and to
learn. The academic community must be composed of
teachers who live out the values of honesty and integ
rity with which they approach their various disciplines
and of students who desire to achieve a critical, crea
tive, and consistent approach to human ideas and the
world around them. The community is a place in which
the student can feel his potentiality to become some
thing more than he is. It is a place both removed from
society, in which teachers and students can think and
talk in security and with honesty; and it is a place
which must be at the radical forefront of society, apply
ing the stringent criteria of integrity and clarity to the
practical affairs of men, institutions, and governments.
