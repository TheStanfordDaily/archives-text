# Letters To The Editor
## Where's Your School Spirit, Cesare? 
### 
editor, The Dally:
I have never (before last
Thursday) attended a LASSU
meeting, but if I ever attend
another I will certainly root for
the administration. By the way,
Mr. Massarenti, how many times
have you seen 120 people attend
LASSU?

• Aren't You Sorry?
Editor, The Dally:
Several of us attending Thurs
day night's session of LASSU
feel that student body vice-pres
ident Cesare Massarenti owes
the band and the pom-pon girls
an apology for his Intemperate
behavior toward them at the
LASSU meeting.
While the band was obviously
not invited to a meeting of such
great importance as Thursday's
LASSU meeting, its presence
provided a welcome relief from
the raving of the many pious
self-righteous members of the
"new left" in attendance for the
sole purpose of packing the
Committee of Fifteen with Peter
Lyman's one sided slate of ap
pointments.
Mr. Massarentl's suggestion,
made after the band and pom
pon girls entered the LASSU
chambers, that he'd be for Cal
should he ever lower himself to
go to a football game, along
with other extremely deroga
tory remarks which he made to
the band, lead us to believe that
he should be forced to apologize
or resign.
Such rudeness to an important
Stanford Institution as the band
should not be tolerated on the
part of one who purports to
speak for the student body.

Editor, The Dally:
Thursday night the marching
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders participated in a ral
ly which took us to nearly every
part of the campus.
When we played and marched
through the residence halls,
huge crowds of students, mo
mentarily distracted from their
more serious pursuits, gathered,
applauding and shouting, "More,
more."
Our stalwart group then ven
tured Into the Undergraduate Li
brary, apparently against the
wishes of the library administra
tion. When our efforts again suc
ceeded in drawing hundreds of
students away from their stud
ies and causing them to laugh,
scream, and applaud, my faith
in Stanford students was some
what shaken. I thought that our
rather frivolous undertaking
had succeeded in creating a bit
of sincere, lighthearted spirit.
This spirit seemed to engulf
us everywhere we went until we
very rudely interrupted a meet
ing of the LASSU. LASSU, it
seemed, was the last stronghold
of sanity on the Stanford cam
pus. Even there, when the pom
pon girls started dancing, and
the band broke into the fight
song, several of the LASSU
members broke into applause.
When the song was over, how
ever, a tall fellow in a gray suit
expressed his displeasure at our
Interruption of the meeting. His

comment bothered me and start
ed me thinking seriously about
our action.
We of the band probably had
no more right to interrupt the
LASSU meeting than several of
our fellow students (and some
of us) had to interfere with the
operation of the Oakland Induc
tion Center or to interrupt Hu
bert Humphrey's speech last
spring. These last two actions
sprang from the serious dictates
of students' consciences, while,
admittedly, the actions of the
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders sprang from noth
ing more serious than a wish to
entertain people.
The students involved in the
above mentioned acts made it
clear that they are fully willing
to accept responsibility for their
actions. If while attempting to
create a high degree of spirit on
this campus, we have caused
any major inconveniences to
anyone, I, for one, am also will
ing to accept responsibility for
it.

• On Representation
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to remark upon the re
cent Cl 5 nominations.
1. When I was approached and
asked to run as a Cl 5 nominee,
I was told that Peter Lyman's
nominees were of one political
viewpoint, that they were in
flexible and intolerant, that they
were not "representative." What
I read in the Dally only re-en
forced those opinions.
So I acceded to run.
I listened critically as four of
the five Lyman nominees spoke.
I was impressed. They were ar
ticulate, intelligent, experienced,
and quietly (not dogmatically)
sure of themselves. I am often
not in agreement with Peter Ly
man. But I found his Cl 5 nomi
nations utterly beyond reproach.
I think he selected five outstand
ing individuals. If my comments
before LASSU were singularly
uninspiring, it was because I
was singularly uninspired. I
should have withdrawn myself
from nomination, but the idea
did not occur to me at the time.
2. I had to smile when I read
that I". . . admitted that spe
cific constituencies would influ
ence (my) actions on the com
mittee." If the Right Honorable
Daily Reporter will recall, what
I did state was "I represent that
portion of the student body that
agrees with me. I do not directly
represent any particular seg
ment." Get it right next time.
3. I am angered that LASSU
has succumbed to rank racism.
Tim Haight's suggestion that a
Negro on Cl 5 would give stu
dents greater negotiating power
is ridiculous. (May I point out
that, by extension, five Negroes
would make us virtually unstop
pable!) I wish to be represented
on the basis of articulation and
intelligence, not color. A
thoughtfully constructed propo
sal is infinitely more effective
(whether submitted by a white,
a black, or a sunburned refugee
from San Gregorio) than one
whose sole recommendation con
sisted of the fact that a Negro
proposed it.
All of which is not to say that
Joseph Goone cannot think and
act intelligently. But he was not
elected for that particular vir
tue. I think LASSU is asking for
trouble.
1967 will go down in Stanford

annals as the year Clf> consisted
of representatives from four
separate constituencies: the ad
ministration, the faculty, the stu
dents, and the Black Student
Union. Perhaps next year S.D.S.
may succeed in getting its rep
resentative on Cl 5. And the year
after that, RQTC may demand
equal representation. I just hope
to God this doesn't set a piece
dent. Because if it does, student
representation on Cl 5 will in the
future be factional and dis
united, and CIS will fall apart.

Editor, The Daily:
The results of the election to
the Committee of Fifteen show
regrettable shallowness and in
consistency of thought by
LASSU. The issue considered in
the election was whether Cl 5
students members should repre
sent all segments of the student
constituency, or rather should be
"activist" advocates of the ma
jority viewpoint. The latter opin
ion prevailed. Accordingly, four
of Peter Lyman's five nominees
were chosen, and nominees from
fraternity, science department,
and politically conservative "mi
norities" were passed over.
At the same time, one mem
ber was elected to Cl 5 whose
only stated qualification was his
minority status. Mr. Goone, of
the Black Student Union, was
selected purely because of the
color of his skin. He did not
have time to prepare to speak to
LASSU; hence, no one heard
about his qualifications or atti
tudes. He asserted that he did
not want to commit, himself "or
other BSU members," as he put
it, to any particular statements.
Several LASSU members spoke
ir. his place, saying primarily
that Cl 5 needs Negro member
ship.
Thus the Legislature decided
that science and the fraternities
need no proportional represen
tation, but that the relatively
small BSU does need it.
We feel that Mr. Goone can
possibly be an effective member
of LASSU. He no doubt has the
intelligence and dedication need
ed for the job. We hope that he
will follow the mandate given
the other Cl 5 student members:
to represent all of the students.
If, by chance, he misuses his
position to be the special agent
of a particular minority, a great
injustice will have been done.

Editor, The Daily:
We welcome the action taken
at last Wednesday night's "com
munity meeting of the left"; the
formation of a united front ac
tion organization will perhaps
end the petty intellectual and
moral debates within the anti
war movement that have seri
ously paralyzed its potential po
litical effectiveness.
The new organization is a
broad-based group drawn from
the ranks of those who share a
common concern over our coun
try's Vietnam policy and the in
adequacies of our society.
The group, however, is not
designed to advocate a specific
set of political beliefs; instead,
it is intended to be an action or
ganization that can mobilize and
co-ordinate the resources of its
members in projects of their
own choice. At the present time,
the scope and range of these
projects have not been deter
mined, but potentially they can
expand to match the imagina
tion and energy of every mem
ber.
The new organization (sis yet
unnamed) will have its first for
mal meeting in Cubberley Audi
torium, Monday evening, No
vember 20, at 8:00 p.m. We urge
every member of the Stanford

community who shares our con
cerns t<> join us in formulating
an organization and program
that will translate these con
cerns into meaningful political
action. This new organization af
fords us all the opportunity to
transcend the potty bickerings
and ideologies of the past and to
unite in concerted action in sup
port of our principles.

Editor, The Daily:
At last Saturday's football
game (November 11) my hus
band was struck in the eye by a
card thrown in the air after the
card stunts were ended. His con
tact lens was knocked out and
could not be located, and his eye
was injured seriously enough to
require medical attention. For

tunately, the only permanent
loss will be monetary, but the
next person to be struck may
not be so lucky. I strongly urge
all students to refrain from such
dangerous stunts and avoid the
risk of permanently blinding
somebody.

At last Saturday's football

band was struck in the eye by a
card thrown in the air after the
card stunts were ended. His con
tact lens was knocked out and
could not be located, and his eye
was injured seriously enough to
require medical attention. For

tunately, the only permanent
loss will be monetary, but the
next person to be struck may
not be so lucky. I strongly urge

• Aren't You Sorry?
Editor, The Dally:
Several of us attending Thurs
day night's session of LASSU
feel that student body vice-pres
ident Cesare Massarenti owes
the band and the pom-pon girls
an apology for his Intemperate
behavior toward them at the
LASSU meeting.
While the band was obviously
not invited to a meeting of such
great importance as Thursday's
LASSU meeting, its presence
provided a welcome relief from
the raving of the many pious
self-righteous members of the
"new left" in attendance for the
sole purpose of packing the
Committee of Fifteen with Peter
Lyman's one sided slate of ap
pointments.
Mr. Massarentl's suggestion,
made after the band and pom
pon girls entered the LASSU
chambers, that he'd be for Cal
should he ever lower himself to
go to a football game, along
with other extremely deroga
tory remarks which he made to
the band, lead us to believe that
he should be forced to apologize
or resign.
Such rudeness to an important
Stanford Institution as the band
should not be tolerated on the
part of one who purports to
speak for the student body.

Thursday night the marching
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders participated in a ral
ly which took us to nearly every
part of the campus.
When we played and marched
through the residence halls,
huge crowds of students, mo
mentarily distracted from their
more serious pursuits, gathered,
applauding and shouting, "More,
more."
Our stalwart group then ven
tured Into the Undergraduate Li
brary, apparently against the
wishes of the library administra
tion. When our efforts again suc
ceeded in drawing hundreds of
students away from their stud
ies and causing them to laugh,
scream, and applaud, my faith
in Stanford students was some
what shaken. I thought that our
rather frivolous undertaking
had succeeded in creating a bit
of sincere, lighthearted spirit.
This spirit seemed to engulf
us everywhere we went until we
very rudely interrupted a meet
ing of the LASSU. LASSU, it
seemed, was the last stronghold
of sanity on the Stanford cam
pus. Even there, when the pom
pon girls started dancing, and
the band broke into the fight
song, several of the LASSU
members broke into applause.
When the song was over, how
ever, a tall fellow in a gray suit
expressed his displeasure at our
Interruption of the meeting. His

comment bothered me and start
ed me thinking seriously about
our action.
We of the band probably had
no more right to interrupt the
LASSU meeting than several of
our fellow students (and some
of us) had to interfere with the
operation of the Oakland Induc
tion Center or to interrupt Hu
bert Humphrey's speech last
spring. These last two actions
sprang from the serious dictates
of students' consciences, while,
admittedly, the actions of the
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders sprang from noth
ing more serious than a wish to
entertain people.
The students involved in the
above mentioned acts made it
clear that they are fully willing
to accept responsibility for their
actions. If while attempting to
create a high degree of spirit on
this campus, we have caused
any major inconveniences to
anyone, I, for one, am also will

• On Representation
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to remark upon the re
cent Cl 5 nominations.
1. When I was approached and
asked to run as a Cl 5 nominee,
I was told that Peter Lyman's
nominees were of one political
viewpoint, that they were in
flexible and intolerant, that they
were not "representative." What
I read in the Dally only re-en
forced those opinions.
So I acceded to run.
I listened critically as four of
the five Lyman nominees spoke.
I was impressed. They were ar
ticulate, intelligent, experienced,
and quietly (not dogmatically)
sure of themselves. I am often
not in agreement with Peter Ly
man. But I found his Cl 5 nomi
nations utterly beyond reproach.
I think he selected five outstand
ing individuals. If my comments
before LASSU were singularly
uninspiring, it was because I
was singularly uninspired. I
should have withdrawn myself
from nomination, but the idea
did not occur to me at the time.
2. I had to smile when I read
that I". . . admitted that spe
cific constituencies would influ
ence (my) actions on the com
mittee." If the Right Honorable
Daily Reporter will recall, what
I did state was "I represent that
portion of the student body that
agrees with me. I do not directly
represent any particular seg
ment." Get it right next time.
3. I am angered that LASSU
has succumbed to rank racism.
Tim Haight's suggestion that a
Negro on Cl 5 would give stu
dents greater negotiating power
is ridiculous. (May I point out
that, by extension, five Negroes
would make us virtually unstop
pable!) I wish to be represented
on the basis of articulation and
intelligence, not color. A
thoughtfully constructed propo
sal is infinitely more effective
(whether submitted by a white,
a black, or a sunburned refugee
from San Gregorio) than one
whose sole recommendation con
sisted of the fact that a Negro
proposed it.
All of which is not to say that
Joseph Goone cannot think and
act intelligently. But he was not
elected for that particular vir
tue. I think LASSU is asking for
trouble.
1967 will go down in Stanford

annals as the year Clf> consisted
of representatives from four
separate constituencies: the ad
ministration, the faculty, the stu
dents, and the Black Student
Union. Perhaps next year S.D.S.
may succeed in getting its rep
resentative on Cl 5. And the year
after that, RQTC may demand
equal representation. I just hope
to God this doesn't set a piece
dent. Because if it does, student
representation on Cl 5 will in the
future be factional and dis
united, and CIS will fall apart.

Editor, The Daily:
The results of the election to
the Committee of Fifteen show
regrettable shallowness and in
consistency of thought by
LASSU. The issue considered in
the election was whether Cl 5
students members should repre
sent all segments of the student
constituency, or rather should be
"activist" advocates of the ma
jority viewpoint. The latter opin
ion prevailed. Accordingly, four
of Peter Lyman's five nominees
were chosen, and nominees from
fraternity, science department,
and politically conservative "mi
norities" were passed over.
At the same time, one mem
ber was elected to Cl 5 whose
only stated qualification was his
minority status. Mr. Goone, of
the Black Student Union, was
selected purely because of the
color of his skin. He did not
have time to prepare to speak to
LASSU; hence, no one heard
about his qualifications or atti
tudes. He asserted that he did
not want to commit, himself "or
other BSU members," as he put
it, to any particular statements.
Several LASSU members spoke
ir. his place, saying primarily
that Cl 5 needs Negro member
ship.
Thus the Legislature decided
that science and the fraternities
need no proportional represen
tation, but that the relatively
small BSU does need it.
We feel that Mr. Goone can
possibly be an effective member
of LASSU. He no doubt has the
intelligence and dedication need
ed for the job. We hope that he
will follow the mandate given
the other Cl 5 student members:
to represent all of the students.
If, by chance, he misuses his
position to be the special agent
of a particular minority, a great
injustice will have been done.

We welcome the action taken
at last Wednesday night's "com
munity meeting of the left"; the
formation of a united front ac
tion organization will perhaps
end the petty intellectual and
moral debates within the anti
war movement that have seri
ously paralyzed its potential po
litical effectiveness.
The new organization is a
broad-based group drawn from
the ranks of those who share a
common concern over our coun
try's Vietnam policy and the in
adequacies of our society.
The group, however, is not
designed to advocate a specific
set of political beliefs; instead,
it is intended to be an action or
ganization that can mobilize and
co-ordinate the resources of its
members in projects of their
own choice. At the present time,
the scope and range of these

will follow the mandate given

to represent all of the students.

We welcome the action taken
at last Wednesday night's "com
munity meeting of the left"; the
formation of a united front ac
tion organization will perhaps
end the petty intellectual and
moral debates within the anti
war movement that have seri
ously paralyzed its potential po
litical effectiveness.
The new organization is a
broad-based group drawn from
the ranks of those who share a
common concern over our coun
try's Vietnam policy and the in
adequacies of our society.
The group, however, is not
designed to advocate a specific
set of political beliefs; instead,
it is intended to be an action or
ganization that can mobilize and
co-ordinate the resources of its
members in projects of their
own choice. At the present time,
the scope and range of these
projects have not been deter
mined, but potentially they can
expand to match the imagina
tion and energy of every mem
ber.
The new organization (sis yet
unnamed) will have its first for
mal meeting in Cubberley Audi
torium, Monday evening, No
vember 20, at 8:00 p.m. We urge
every member of the Stanford

community who shares our con
cerns t<> join us in formulating
an organization and program
that will translate these con
cerns into meaningful political
action. This new organization af
fords us all the opportunity to
transcend the potty bickerings
and ideologies of the past and to
unite in concerted action in sup
port of our principles.

At last Saturday's football

card thrown in the air after the
card stunts were ended. His con
tact lens was knocked out and
could not be located, and his eye
was injured seriously enough to
require medical attention. For

tunately, the only permanent

not be so lucky. I strongly urge

• Aren't You Sorry?
Editor, The Dally:
Several of us attending Thurs
day night's session of LASSU
feel that student body vice-pres
ident Cesare Massarenti owes
the band and the pom-pon girls
an apology for his Intemperate
behavior toward them at the
LASSU meeting.
While the band was obviously
not invited to a meeting of such
great importance as Thursday's
LASSU meeting, its presence
provided a welcome relief from
the raving of the many pious
self-righteous members of the
"new left" in attendance for the
sole purpose of packing the
Committee of Fifteen with Peter
Lyman's one sided slate of ap
pointments.
Mr. Massarentl's suggestion,
made after the band and pom
pon girls entered the LASSU
chambers, that he'd be for Cal
should he ever lower himself to
go to a football game, along
with other extremely deroga
tory remarks which he made to
the band, lead us to believe that
he should be forced to apologize
or resign.
Such rudeness to an important
Stanford Institution as the band
should not be tolerated on the
part of one who purports to
speak for the student body.

Editor, The Dally:
Thursday night the marching
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders participated in a ral
ly which took us to nearly every
part of the campus.
When we played and marched
through the residence halls,
huge crowds of students, mo
mentarily distracted from their
more serious pursuits, gathered,
applauding and shouting, "More,
more."
Our stalwart group then ven
tured Into the Undergraduate Li
brary, apparently against the
wishes of the library administra
tion. When our efforts again suc
ceeded in drawing hundreds of
students away from their stud
ies and causing them to laugh,
scream, and applaud, my faith
in Stanford students was some
what shaken. I thought that our
rather frivolous undertaking
had succeeded in creating a bit
of sincere, lighthearted spirit.
This spirit seemed to engulf
us everywhere we went until we
very rudely interrupted a meet
ing of the LASSU. LASSU, it
seemed, was the last stronghold
of sanity on the Stanford cam
pus. Even there, when the pom
pon girls started dancing, and
the band broke into the fight
song, several of the LASSU
members broke into applause.
When the song was over, how
ever, a tall fellow in a gray suit
expressed his displeasure at our
Interruption of the meeting. His

comment bothered me and start
ed me thinking seriously about
our action.
We of the band probably had
no more right to interrupt the
LASSU meeting than several of
our fellow students (and some
of us) had to interfere with the
operation of the Oakland Induc
tion Center or to interrupt Hu
bert Humphrey's speech last
spring. These last two actions
sprang from the serious dictates
of students' consciences, while,
admittedly, the actions of the
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders sprang from noth
ing more serious than a wish to
entertain people.
The students involved in the
above mentioned acts made it
clear that they are fully willing
to accept responsibility for their
actions. If while attempting to
create a high degree of spirit on
this campus, we have caused
any major inconveniences to
anyone, I, for one, am also will

• On Representation
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to remark upon the re
cent Cl 5 nominations.
1. When I was approached and
asked to run as a Cl 5 nominee,
I was told that Peter Lyman's
nominees were of one political
viewpoint, that they were in
flexible and intolerant, that they
were not "representative." What
I read in the Dally only re-en
forced those opinions.
So I acceded to run.
I listened critically as four of
the five Lyman nominees spoke.
I was impressed. They were ar
ticulate, intelligent, experienced,
and quietly (not dogmatically)
sure of themselves. I am often
not in agreement with Peter Ly
man. But I found his Cl 5 nomi
nations utterly beyond reproach.
I think he selected five outstand
ing individuals. If my comments
before LASSU were singularly
uninspiring, it was because I
was singularly uninspired. I
should have withdrawn myself
from nomination, but the idea
did not occur to me at the time.
2. I had to smile when I read
that I". . . admitted that spe
cific constituencies would influ
ence (my) actions on the com
mittee." If the Right Honorable
Daily Reporter will recall, what
I did state was "I represent that
portion of the student body that
agrees with me. I do not directly
represent any particular seg
ment." Get it right next time.
3. I am angered that LASSU
has succumbed to rank racism.
Tim Haight's suggestion that a
Negro on Cl 5 would give stu
dents greater negotiating power
is ridiculous. (May I point out
that, by extension, five Negroes
would make us virtually unstop
pable!) I wish to be represented
on the basis of articulation and
intelligence, not color. A
thoughtfully constructed propo
sal is infinitely more effective
(whether submitted by a white,
a black, or a sunburned refugee
from San Gregorio) than one
whose sole recommendation con
sisted of the fact that a Negro
proposed it.
All of which is not to say that
Joseph Goone cannot think and
act intelligently. But he was not
elected for that particular vir
tue. I think LASSU is asking for
trouble.
1967 will go down in Stanford

annals as the year Clf> consisted
of representatives from four
separate constituencies: the ad
ministration, the faculty, the stu
dents, and the Black Student
Union. Perhaps next year S.D.S.
may succeed in getting its rep
resentative on Cl 5. And the year
after that, RQTC may demand
equal representation. I just hope
to God this doesn't set a piece
dent. Because if it does, student
representation on Cl 5 will in the
future be factional and dis
united, and CIS will fall apart.

• Minority Matter
Editor, The Daily:
The results of the election to
the Committee of Fifteen show
regrettable shallowness and in
consistency of thought by
LASSU. The issue considered in
the election was whether Cl 5
students members should repre
sent all segments of the student
constituency, or rather should be
"activist" advocates of the ma
jority viewpoint. The latter opin
ion prevailed. Accordingly, four
of Peter Lyman's five nominees
were chosen, and nominees from
fraternity, science department,
and politically conservative "mi
norities" were passed over.
At the same time, one mem
ber was elected to Cl 5 whose
only stated qualification was his
minority status. Mr. Goone, of
the Black Student Union, was
selected purely because of the
color of his skin. He did not
have time to prepare to speak to
LASSU; hence, no one heard
about his qualifications or atti
tudes. He asserted that he did
not want to commit, himself "or
other BSU members," as he put
it, to any particular statements.
Several LASSU members spoke
ir. his place, saying primarily
that Cl 5 needs Negro member
ship.
Thus the Legislature decided
that science and the fraternities
need no proportional represen
tation, but that the relatively
small BSU does need it.
We feel that Mr. Goone can
possibly be an effective member
of LASSU. He no doubt has the
intelligence and dedication need
ed for the job. We hope that he
will follow the mandate given
the other Cl 5 student members:

Editor, The Daily:
The results of the election to
the Committee of Fifteen show
regrettable shallowness and in
consistency of thought by
LASSU. The issue considered in
the election was whether Cl 5
students members should repre
sent all segments of the student
constituency, or rather should be
"activist" advocates of the ma
jority viewpoint. The latter opin
ion prevailed. Accordingly, four
of Peter Lyman's five nominees
were chosen, and nominees from
fraternity, science department,
and politically conservative "mi
norities" were passed over.
At the same time, one mem
ber was elected to Cl 5 whose
only stated qualification was his
minority status. Mr. Goone, of
the Black Student Union, was
selected purely because of the
color of his skin. He did not
have time to prepare to speak to
LASSU; hence, no one heard
about his qualifications or atti
tudes. He asserted that he did
not want to commit, himself "or
other BSU members," as he put
it, to any particular statements.
Several LASSU members spoke
ir. his place, saying primarily
that Cl 5 needs Negro member
ship.
Thus the Legislature decided
that science and the fraternities
need no proportional represen
tation, but that the relatively
small BSU does need it.
We feel that Mr. Goone can
possibly be an effective member
of LASSU. He no doubt has the
intelligence and dedication need
ed for the job. We hope that he
will follow the mandate given
the other Cl 5 student members:
to represent all of the students.
If, by chance, he misuses his
position to be the special agent
of a particular minority, a great
injustice will have been done.

We welcome the action taken
at last Wednesday night's "com
munity meeting of the left"; the
formation of a united front ac
tion organization will perhaps
end the petty intellectual and
moral debates within the anti
war movement that have seri
ously paralyzed its potential po
litical effectiveness.
The new organization is a
broad-based group drawn from
the ranks of those who share a
common concern over our coun
try's Vietnam policy and the in
adequacies of our society.
The group, however, is not
designed to advocate a specific
set of political beliefs; instead,
it is intended to be an action or
ganization that can mobilize and
co-ordinate the resources of its
members in projects of their
own choice. At the present time,
the scope and range of these
projects have not been deter
mined, but potentially they can
expand to match the imagina
tion and energy of every mem
ber.
The new organization (sis yet
unnamed) will have its first for
mal meeting in Cubberley Audi
torium, Monday evening, No
vember 20, at 8:00 p.m. We urge
every member of the Stanford

community who shares our con
cerns t<> join us in formulating
an organization and program
that will translate these con
cerns into meaningful political
action. This new organization af
fords us all the opportunity to
transcend the potty bickerings
and ideologies of the past and to
unite in concerted action in sup
port of our principles.

At last Saturday's football

card thrown in the air after the
card stunts were ended. His con
tact lens was knocked out and
could not be located, and his eye
was injured seriously enough to
require medical attention. For

• Aren't You Sorry?
Editor, The Dally:
Several of us attending Thurs
day night's session of LASSU
feel that student body vice-pres
ident Cesare Massarenti owes
the band and the pom-pon girls
an apology for his Intemperate
behavior toward them at the
LASSU meeting.
While the band was obviously
not invited to a meeting of such
great importance as Thursday's
LASSU meeting, its presence
provided a welcome relief from
the raving of the many pious
self-righteous members of the
"new left" in attendance for the
sole purpose of packing the
Committee of Fifteen with Peter
Lyman's one sided slate of ap
pointments.
Mr. Massarentl's suggestion,
made after the band and pom
pon girls entered the LASSU
chambers, that he'd be for Cal
should he ever lower himself to
go to a football game, along
with other extremely deroga
tory remarks which he made to
the band, lead us to believe that
he should be forced to apologize
or resign.
Such rudeness to an important
Stanford Institution as the band
should not be tolerated on the
part of one who purports to
speak for the student body.

Thursday night the marching
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders participated in a ral
ly which took us to nearly every
part of the campus.
When we played and marched
through the residence halls,
huge crowds of students, mo
mentarily distracted from their
more serious pursuits, gathered,
applauding and shouting, "More,
more."
Our stalwart group then ven
tured Into the Undergraduate Li
brary, apparently against the
wishes of the library administra
tion. When our efforts again suc
ceeded in drawing hundreds of
students away from their stud
ies and causing them to laugh,
scream, and applaud, my faith
in Stanford students was some
what shaken. I thought that our
rather frivolous undertaking
had succeeded in creating a bit
of sincere, lighthearted spirit.
This spirit seemed to engulf
us everywhere we went until we
very rudely interrupted a meet
ing of the LASSU. LASSU, it
seemed, was the last stronghold
of sanity on the Stanford cam
pus. Even there, when the pom
pon girls started dancing, and
the band broke into the fight
song, several of the LASSU
members broke into applause.
When the song was over, how
ever, a tall fellow in a gray suit
expressed his displeasure at our
Interruption of the meeting. His

comment bothered me and start
ed me thinking seriously about
our action.
We of the band probably had
no more right to interrupt the
LASSU meeting than several of
our fellow students (and some
of us) had to interfere with the
operation of the Oakland Induc
tion Center or to interrupt Hu
bert Humphrey's speech last
spring. These last two actions
sprang from the serious dictates
of students' consciences, while,
admittedly, the actions of the
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders sprang from noth
ing more serious than a wish to
entertain people.
The students involved in the
above mentioned acts made it
clear that they are fully willing
to accept responsibility for their
actions. If while attempting to
create a high degree of spirit on
this campus, we have caused
any major inconveniences to
anyone, I, for one, am also will

• On Representation
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to remark upon the re
cent Cl 5 nominations.
1. When I was approached and
asked to run as a Cl 5 nominee,
I was told that Peter Lyman's
nominees were of one political
viewpoint, that they were in
flexible and intolerant, that they
were not "representative." What
I read in the Dally only re-en
forced those opinions.
So I acceded to run.
I listened critically as four of
the five Lyman nominees spoke.
I was impressed. They were ar
ticulate, intelligent, experienced,
and quietly (not dogmatically)
sure of themselves. I am often
not in agreement with Peter Ly
man. But I found his Cl 5 nomi
nations utterly beyond reproach.
I think he selected five outstand
ing individuals. If my comments
before LASSU were singularly
uninspiring, it was because I
was singularly uninspired. I
should have withdrawn myself
from nomination, but the idea
did not occur to me at the time.
2. I had to smile when I read
that I". . . admitted that spe
cific constituencies would influ
ence (my) actions on the com
mittee." If the Right Honorable
Daily Reporter will recall, what
I did state was "I represent that
portion of the student body that
agrees with me. I do not directly
represent any particular seg
ment." Get it right next time.
3. I am angered that LASSU
has succumbed to rank racism.
Tim Haight's suggestion that a
Negro on Cl 5 would give stu
dents greater negotiating power
is ridiculous. (May I point out
that, by extension, five Negroes
would make us virtually unstop
pable!) I wish to be represented
on the basis of articulation and
intelligence, not color. A
thoughtfully constructed propo
sal is infinitely more effective
(whether submitted by a white,
a black, or a sunburned refugee
from San Gregorio) than one
whose sole recommendation con
sisted of the fact that a Negro
proposed it.
All of which is not to say that
Joseph Goone cannot think and
act intelligently. But he was not
elected for that particular vir
tue. I think LASSU is asking for
trouble.
1967 will go down in Stanford

annals as the year Clf> consisted
of representatives from four
separate constituencies: the ad
ministration, the faculty, the stu
dents, and the Black Student
Union. Perhaps next year S.D.S.
may succeed in getting its rep
resentative on Cl 5. And the year
after that, RQTC may demand
equal representation. I just hope
to God this doesn't set a piece
dent. Because if it does, student
representation on Cl 5 will in the
future be factional and dis
united, and CIS will fall apart.

thoughtfully constructed propo
sal is infinitely more effective
(whether submitted by a white,
a black, or a sunburned refugee
from San Gregorio) than one

proposed it.
All of which is not to say that

1967 will go down in Stanford

after that, RQTC may demand
equal representation. I just hope

Editor, The Daily:
The results of the election to
the Committee of Fifteen show
regrettable shallowness and in
consistency of thought by
LASSU. The issue considered in
the election was whether Cl 5
students members should repre
sent all segments of the student
constituency, or rather should be
"activist" advocates of the ma
jority viewpoint. The latter opin
ion prevailed. Accordingly, four
of Peter Lyman's five nominees
were chosen, and nominees from
fraternity, science department,
and politically conservative "mi
norities" were passed over.
At the same time, one mem
ber was elected to Cl 5 whose
only stated qualification was his
minority status. Mr. Goone, of
the Black Student Union, was
selected purely because of the
color of his skin. He did not
have time to prepare to speak to
LASSU; hence, no one heard
about his qualifications or atti
tudes. He asserted that he did
not want to commit, himself "or
other BSU members," as he put
it, to any particular statements.
Several LASSU members spoke
ir. his place, saying primarily
that Cl 5 needs Negro member
ship.
Thus the Legislature decided
that science and the fraternities
need no proportional represen
tation, but that the relatively
small BSU does need it.
We feel that Mr. Goone can
possibly be an effective member
of LASSU. He no doubt has the
intelligence and dedication need
ed for the job. We hope that he
will follow the mandate given
the other Cl 5 student members:
to represent all of the students.
If, by chance, he misuses his
position to be the special agent
of a particular minority, a great
injustice will have been done.

We welcome the action taken
at last Wednesday night's "com
munity meeting of the left"; the
formation of a united front ac
tion organization will perhaps
end the petty intellectual and
moral debates within the anti
war movement that have seri
ously paralyzed its potential po
litical effectiveness.
The new organization is a
broad-based group drawn from
the ranks of those who share a
common concern over our coun
try's Vietnam policy and the in
adequacies of our society.
The group, however, is not
designed to advocate a specific
set of political beliefs; instead,
it is intended to be an action or
ganization that can mobilize and
co-ordinate the resources of its
members in projects of their
own choice. At the present time,
the scope and range of these
projects have not been deter
mined, but potentially they can
expand to match the imagina
tion and energy of every mem
ber.
The new organization (sis yet
unnamed) will have its first for
mal meeting in Cubberley Audi
torium, Monday evening, No
vember 20, at 8:00 p.m. We urge
every member of the Stanford

community who shares our con
cerns t<> join us in formulating
an organization and program
that will translate these con
cerns into meaningful political
action. This new organization af
fords us all the opportunity to
transcend the potty bickerings

Editor, The Dally:
Several of us attending Thurs
day night's session of LASSU
feel that student body vice-pres
ident Cesare Massarenti owes
the band and the pom-pon girls
an apology for his Intemperate
behavior toward them at the
LASSU meeting.
While the band was obviously
not invited to a meeting of such
great importance as Thursday's
LASSU meeting, its presence
provided a welcome relief from
the raving of the many pious
self-righteous members of the
"new left" in attendance for the
sole purpose of packing the
Committee of Fifteen with Peter
Lyman's one sided slate of ap
pointments.
Mr. Massarentl's suggestion,
made after the band and pom

chambers, that he'd be for Cal
should he ever lower himself to
go to a football game, along
with other extremely deroga
tory remarks which he made to
the band, lead us to believe that
he should be forced to apologize
or resign.
Such rudeness to an important
Stanford Institution as the band
should not be tolerated on the
part of one who purports to

Thursday night the marching
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders participated in a ral
ly which took us to nearly every
part of the campus.
When we played and marched
through the residence halls,
huge crowds of students, mo
mentarily distracted from their
more serious pursuits, gathered,
applauding and shouting, "More,
more."
Our stalwart group then ven
tured Into the Undergraduate Li
brary, apparently against the
wishes of the library administra
tion. When our efforts again suc
ceeded in drawing hundreds of
students away from their stud
ies and causing them to laugh,
scream, and applaud, my faith
in Stanford students was some
what shaken. I thought that our
rather frivolous undertaking
had succeeded in creating a bit
of sincere, lighthearted spirit.
This spirit seemed to engulf
us everywhere we went until we
very rudely interrupted a meet
ing of the LASSU. LASSU, it
seemed, was the last stronghold
of sanity on the Stanford cam
pus. Even there, when the pom
pon girls started dancing, and
the band broke into the fight
song, several of the LASSU
members broke into applause.
When the song was over, how
ever, a tall fellow in a gray suit
expressed his displeasure at our
Interruption of the meeting. His

comment bothered me and start
ed me thinking seriously about
our action.
We of the band probably had
no more right to interrupt the
LASSU meeting than several of
our fellow students (and some
of us) had to interfere with the
operation of the Oakland Induc
tion Center or to interrupt Hu
bert Humphrey's speech last
spring. These last two actions
sprang from the serious dictates
of students' consciences, while,
admittedly, the actions of the
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders sprang from noth
ing more serious than a wish to
entertain people.
The students involved in the
above mentioned acts made it
clear that they are fully willing
to accept responsibility for their
actions. If while attempting to
create a high degree of spirit on
this campus, we have caused
any major inconveniences to
anyone, I, for one, am also will

• On Representation
Editor, The Dally:
I wish to remark upon the re
cent Cl 5 nominations.
1. When I was approached and
asked to run as a Cl 5 nominee,
I was told that Peter Lyman's
nominees were of one political
viewpoint, that they were in
flexible and intolerant, that they
were not "representative." What
I read in the Dally only re-en
forced those opinions.
So I acceded to run.
I listened critically as four of
the five Lyman nominees spoke.
I was impressed. They were ar
ticulate, intelligent, experienced,
and quietly (not dogmatically)
sure of themselves. I am often
not in agreement with Peter Ly
man. But I found his Cl 5 nomi
nations utterly beyond reproach.
I think he selected five outstand
ing individuals. If my comments
before LASSU were singularly
uninspiring, it was because I
was singularly uninspired. I
should have withdrawn myself
from nomination, but the idea
did not occur to me at the time.
2. I had to smile when I read
that I". . . admitted that spe
cific constituencies would influ
ence (my) actions on the com
mittee." If the Right Honorable
Daily Reporter will recall, what
I did state was "I represent that
portion of the student body that
agrees with me. I do not directly
represent any particular seg
ment." Get it right next time.
3. I am angered that LASSU
has succumbed to rank racism.
Tim Haight's suggestion that a
Negro on Cl 5 would give stu
dents greater negotiating power
is ridiculous. (May I point out

nominees were of one political
viewpoint, that they were in
flexible and intolerant, that they
were not "representative." What
I read in the Dally only re-en
forced those opinions.
So I acceded to run.
I listened critically as four of
the five Lyman nominees spoke.
I was impressed. They were ar
ticulate, intelligent, experienced,
and quietly (not dogmatically)
sure of themselves. I am often
not in agreement with Peter Ly
man. But I found his Cl 5 nomi
nations utterly beyond reproach.
I think he selected five outstand
ing individuals. If my comments
before LASSU were singularly
uninspiring, it was because I
was singularly uninspired. I
should have withdrawn myself
from nomination, but the idea
did not occur to me at the time.
2. I had to smile when I read
that I". . . admitted that spe
cific constituencies would influ
ence (my) actions on the com
mittee." If the Right Honorable
Daily Reporter will recall, what
I did state was "I represent that
portion of the student body that
agrees with me. I do not directly
represent any particular seg
ment." Get it right next time.
3. I am angered that LASSU
has succumbed to rank racism.
Tim Haight's suggestion that a
Negro on Cl 5 would give stu
dents greater negotiating power
is ridiculous. (May I point out
that, by extension, five Negroes
would make us virtually unstop
pable!) I wish to be represented
on the basis of articulation and
intelligence, not color. A
thoughtfully constructed propo
sal is infinitely more effective
(whether submitted by a white,
a black, or a sunburned refugee
from San Gregorio) than one
whose sole recommendation con
sisted of the fact that a Negro
proposed it.
All of which is not to say that
Joseph Goone cannot think and
act intelligently. But he was not
elected for that particular vir
tue. I think LASSU is asking for
trouble.
1967 will go down in Stanford

annals as the year Clf> consisted
of representatives from four
separate constituencies: the ad
ministration, the faculty, the stu
dents, and the Black Student
Union. Perhaps next year S.D.S.
may succeed in getting its rep
resentative on Cl 5. And the year
after that, RQTC may demand
equal representation. I just hope
to God this doesn't set a piece
dent. Because if it does, student
representation on Cl 5 will in the
future be factional and dis
united, and CIS will fall apart.

• Minority Matter
Editor, The Daily:
The results of the election to
the Committee of Fifteen show
regrettable shallowness and in
consistency of thought by
LASSU. The issue considered in
the election was whether Cl 5
students members should repre
sent all segments of the student
constituency, or rather should be
"activist" advocates of the ma
jority viewpoint. The latter opin
ion prevailed. Accordingly, four
of Peter Lyman's five nominees
were chosen, and nominees from
fraternity, science department,
and politically conservative "mi
norities" were passed over.
At the same time, one mem
ber was elected to Cl 5 whose
only stated qualification was his
minority status. Mr. Goone, of
the Black Student Union, was
selected purely because of the
color of his skin. He did not
have time to prepare to speak to
LASSU; hence, no one heard
about his qualifications or atti
tudes. He asserted that he did
not want to commit, himself "or
other BSU members," as he put
it, to any particular statements.
Several LASSU members spoke
ir. his place, saying primarily
that Cl 5 needs Negro member
ship.
Thus the Legislature decided
that science and the fraternities
need no proportional represen
tation, but that the relatively
small BSU does need it.
We feel that Mr. Goone can
possibly be an effective member
of LASSU. He no doubt has the
intelligence and dedication need
ed for the job. We hope that he
will follow the mandate given
the other Cl 5 student members:
to represent all of the students.
If, by chance, he misuses his
position to be the special agent
of a particular minority, a great
injustice will have been done.

Editor, The Daily:
We welcome the action taken
at last Wednesday night's "com
munity meeting of the left"; the
formation of a united front ac
tion organization will perhaps
end the petty intellectual and
moral debates within the anti
war movement that have seri
ously paralyzed its potential po
litical effectiveness.
The new organization is a
broad-based group drawn from
the ranks of those who share a
common concern over our coun
try's Vietnam policy and the in
adequacies of our society.
The group, however, is not
designed to advocate a specific
set of political beliefs; instead,
it is intended to be an action or
ganization that can mobilize and
co-ordinate the resources of its
members in projects of their
own choice. At the present time,
the scope and range of these
projects have not been deter
mined, but potentially they can
expand to match the imagina
tion and energy of every mem
ber.
The new organization (sis yet
unnamed) will have its first for
mal meeting in Cubberley Audi
torium, Monday evening, No
vember 20, at 8:00 p.m. We urge
every member of the Stanford

community who shares our con
cerns t<> join us in formulating
an organization and program
that will translate these con
cerns into meaningful political
action. This new organization af
fords us all the opportunity to
transcend the potty bickerings
and ideologies of the past and to
unite in concerted action in sup
port of our principles.

At last Saturday's football

band was struck in the eye by a
card thrown in the air after the
card stunts were ended. His con
tact lens was knocked out and
could not be located, and his eye
was injured seriously enough to
require medical attention. For

tunately, the only permanent
loss will be monetary, but the
next person to be struck may
not be so lucky. I strongly urge
all students to refrain from such
dangerous stunts and avoid the

I have never (before last
Thursday) attended a LASSU
meeting, but if I ever attend
another I will certainly root for
the administration. By the way,
Mr. Massarenti, how many times
have you seen 120 people attend
LASSU?

• Aren't You Sorry?
Editor, The Dally:
Several of us attending Thurs
day night's session of LASSU
feel that student body vice-pres
ident Cesare Massarenti owes
the band and the pom-pon girls
an apology for his Intemperate
behavior toward them at the
LASSU meeting.
While the band was obviously
not invited to a meeting of such
great importance as Thursday's
LASSU meeting, its presence
provided a welcome relief from
the raving of the many pious
self-righteous members of the
"new left" in attendance for the
sole purpose of packing the
Committee of Fifteen with Peter
Lyman's one sided slate of ap
pointments.
Mr. Massarentl's suggestion,
made after the band and pom
pon girls entered the LASSU
chambers, that he'd be for Cal
should he ever lower himself to
go to a football game, along
with other extremely deroga
tory remarks which he made to
the band, lead us to believe that
he should be forced to apologize
or resign.
Such rudeness to an important
Stanford Institution as the band
should not be tolerated on the
part of one who purports to
speak for the student body.

Editor, The Dally:
Thursday night the marching
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders participated in a ral
ly which took us to nearly every
part of the campus.
When we played and marched
through the residence halls,
huge crowds of students, mo
mentarily distracted from their
more serious pursuits, gathered,
applauding and shouting, "More,
more."
Our stalwart group then ven
tured Into the Undergraduate Li
brary, apparently against the
wishes of the library administra
tion. When our efforts again suc
ceeded in drawing hundreds of
students away from their stud
ies and causing them to laugh,
scream, and applaud, my faith
in Stanford students was some
what shaken. I thought that our
rather frivolous undertaking
had succeeded in creating a bit
of sincere, lighthearted spirit.
This spirit seemed to engulf
us everywhere we went until we
very rudely interrupted a meet
ing of the LASSU. LASSU, it
seemed, was the last stronghold
of sanity on the Stanford cam
pus. Even there, when the pom
pon girls started dancing, and
the band broke into the fight
song, several of the LASSU
members broke into applause.
When the song was over, how
ever, a tall fellow in a gray suit
expressed his displeasure at our
Interruption of the meeting. His

comment bothered me and start
ed me thinking seriously about
our action.
We of the band probably had
no more right to interrupt the
LASSU meeting than several of
our fellow students (and some
of us) had to interfere with the
operation of the Oakland Induc
tion Center or to interrupt Hu
bert Humphrey's speech last
spring. These last two actions
sprang from the serious dictates
of students' consciences, while,
admittedly, the actions of the
band, the pom-pon girls, and the
yell leaders sprang from noth
ing more serious than a wish to
entertain people.
The students involved in the
above mentioned acts made it
clear that they are fully willing
to accept responsibility for their
actions. If while attempting to
create a high degree of spirit on
this campus, we have caused
any major inconveniences to
anyone, I, for one, am also will
ing to accept responsibility for
it.
