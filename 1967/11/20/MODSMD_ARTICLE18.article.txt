## Hypnotists Experiment With Pain 
### CONNIE COLLIER 
A student sits in a dimly
lighted room, his right hand im
mersed in a refrigerator appara
tus which is circulating water
at 0 degrees Centigrade.
After one minute, his hand is
taken from the water and his
blood pressure measured. It is
normal; the subject has felt no
pain. He is under hypnosis.
The scene is Hawthorne
House; the experiment is de
signed to determine the nature
of pain and the practical uses
of hypnosis in reducing it.
This particular test is only
one of a variety which are being
conducted there by Stanford's
Department of Psychology. Pro
fessor Ernest Hilgard and his
wife, Dr. Josephine Hilgard, are
directing the studies with the
help of Dr. Lewis Sachs.
Truth From Falsehood
Since the project opened in
1964, more than 1000 students
have participated in its experi
ments. One of the primary pur
poses of these experiments is
"to separate by the use of
more sophisticated controls
what is true from what is false
in the folklore that has grown
up around hypnotic phenom
ena," Professor Hilgard says.
A scientific approach should
contribute to invention and dis
covery, Hilgard states. An ex
perimental psychologist, he
holds that "it would be a poor
day for psychological science if
all the truths of hypnosis had
' been discovered by the early
amateurs, with the later work
ers only sorting out the more
believable from the less be
, lievable."
In the past ten years investi
gators have been using the ex
perimental method to clarify
the nature of hypnosis. The
rporkers at Hawthorne House
'are working to establish exper
imental methods involving con
trol of the conditions and objec
tivity in recording data. This,
they hope, will enable others to
repeat the investigations them
selves.
The machines the workers
use are employed specifically in
measuring physiological changes
that accompany pain.
"When pain is of long dura
tion, and reaches levels that can
be described as intolerable suf
fering, physiological changes are
consistent, particularly rise in
blood pressure," Hilgard says.
This fact was determined
through tests in which subjects
immersed their hands in ice wa
ter. Tourniquet pain is another

type of laboratory pain which
was employed. This technique
consists of "milking" the arm of
blood by wrapping it with an
elastic surgical bandage. The
circulation is then cut off above
the elbow, and the subject
squeezes 20 times an apparatus
which measures force; then he
relaxes. The pain mounts grad
ually, over minutes rather than
seconds as in the ice water.
After ten to thirty minutes
the pain becomes intolerable,
and the pressure is relieved.
During this time, blood pres
sure mounts rapidly in corres
pondence to the pain level. The
actual physiological basis of the
pain or its relief remains ob
scure.
Report No Pains
However, when highly suscep
tible subjects were hypnotized
and subjected to the experiment,
they reported no pain. Further
more, their blood pressure did
not rise.
"Thus the method demon
strates the reality of hypnotic
analgesia," (insensibility to pain
without losing consciousness)
concluded Professor Hilgard.
"I need not cite the history of
the use of hypnosis in major
surgery, in childbirth, in dentist
ry, and in the relief of the pain
of burns," he added.
Yet, "much confusion exists
in the lab study of pain relief
through hypnosis." This general
situation provided the impetus
for the experiments in hypnosis
with which he is now involved.
The experimenters at Haw
thorne House use standard tech
niques to produce a state of
hypnosis. However, Hilgard
says, it has always been recog
nized that some subjects are

more readily hypnotized than
others, regardless of the tech
nique.
The laboratory has made care
ful studies of individual differ
ences in susceptibility. General
ly, it has been found that people
who can become very absorbed
in a pursuit such as reading or
listening to music are most
prone to be hypnotized.
"Experiences in which a per
son becomes involved in an ac
tivity to the point that he isn't
disturbed by distractions such
as the telephone are very much
like hypnosis," Hilgard says.

In addition, people with good
imaginations are highly hypno
tizable; so are the easy-going
personality types. And, contrary
to what he had expected, Hil
gard said he found no difference
in susceptibility between the
sexes.
Only about one-third of the
subjects were able to be hypno
tized.
Hypnosis has a practical value
in analyzing the psychology of
motivation; a person's defenses
and repressions can often be
brought to the surface through
hypnosis.
The method is termed "meta
contrast" and consists of two
pictures projected in front of the
subject by the tachistoscope. The
first image is flashed for only a
fraction of a second, the second
follows immediately and re
mains in view for several sec
onds. Under these conditions,
the subject forgets that he has
seen the first image, but the
first image usually influences
his perception of the second.
He is then hypnotized and an
attempt is made to discover
where the first image has

"gone." This could yield valu
able insights into the mind's de
fense mechanisms, Hilgard said.
Pupilometer Measures
The pupilometer, a device
which measures a subject's in
terest by the dilation of his pu
pils, is also employed at the
laboratory. Images are again
flashed into the subject's view
and his pupil size is measured.
This experiment might have
some correlation to hypnosis,
says Hilgard. In hypnosis, a per
son's attention is diverted, and
this is possibly one reason why
he often feels no pain when he
normally would. Since the pupil
ometer indicates the level of at
tention, Hilgard said it could be
useful in increasing the suscep
tibility of subjects that are un
able to be hypnotized.
The aim of these experiments,
says Hilgard, is to maximize the
usefulness of hypnosis. He
states, "If we continue to build
strongly along these lines we
may succeed in maintaining and
extending the present attention
to hypnosis as one of the im
portant areas for a scientific
psychology to encompass."

a device that measures physiological reactions to pain. The machine is one of several used by the ex
perimenters of Hawthorne House.
