# Population Explosion To Produce Starvation
## 
### 
A Stanford population biolo
gist told a scientific symposium
at the University of Texas No
vember 16 that a world famine
is unavoidable because of the
population explosion.
Professor Paul R. Ehrlich
suggested a four step plan to
limit U.S. population, but with
"full knowledge that (the steps)
are socially unpalatable and
politically unrealistic."
First he would establish a
"Federal Population Commis

sion" to promote "reproductive
responsibility" in connection
with the standard of living.
Next, tax laws would be made
to discourage people to have
children. Step three would legal
ize abortion and make birth
control education mandatory.
Step four would transfer gov
ernment research from "short
sighted programs on death con
trol" to "broad areas" like pop
ulation control.
Two sociologists, Dr. Charles
Westoff of Princeton and Dr.
Norman Ryder of the Univers
ity of Wisconsin, are also in
volved in studying birth control.
According to a national survey
which they analyzed, eighty
four per cent of married Ameri
can women have used contra
ceptives. Another 6 per cent say
they intend to use them.
Today at approximately 11
a.m., the 200 millionth Ameri
can will be registered on the
census clock in the lobby of the
Commerce Department Building
in Washington, D.C. This statis
tical estimate is believed to be
six million short of the actual
population figure.
The Council on Population
and Environment (COPE) has
placed ads today in campus
papers at Stanford, Berkeley,
and San Francisco State that
sarcastically congratulate Am
erica for passing the 200 mil
lion population mark. COPE is
a group of concerned Stanford
faculty members and students.
