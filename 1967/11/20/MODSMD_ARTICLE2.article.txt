# Stanford Left Calls Meeting
## 
### 
The new and as yet unnamed
coordinating committee of the
Stanford left will hold its sec
ond meeting tonight at 8:00 in
Cubberley Auditorium.
Plans for the meeting include
discussion of the aims of the
organization, dissemination of
information about various on
and off-campus anti-war activi
ties, and an open discussion pe
riod.
According to an organization
al proposal approved at the first
committee meeting last Wednes
day night, the group has nothing
to do with tactics or ideology.
Its aim is to allow the several
left-wing campus groups to get
together and discuss their prob
lems.
The committee includes repre
sentatives from several groups
concerned with anti-war activi
ties, including the Resistance,
Students for a Democratic So
ciety, Anti-Draft Union, and Uni
versity Christian Movement.
There are also unaffiliated
members, including the chair
man of tonight's meeting, Jeff
Browning.
The organizational proposal
mentioned two major problems
encountered by Stanford left
wing organizations.
One is that "existing radical
organizations are not coordi

nating their activism," resulting
in "wasteful duplication of ef
fort and sometimes out and out
conflict both in scheduling of
events and in methods of proce
dure on particular issues."
The other difficulty mentioned
is that "the various existing radi
cal organizations are largely iso
lated from the overall campus
community."
As a result of these problems,
the proposal continues, "there is
no general decision-making
structure."
The proposal was written by
Bruce Franklin, associate pro
fessor of English.
A large number of the people
on the committee are not affili
ated with any of the various
anti-war organizations, and these
are the ones who are doing most
of the organizing.
Representatives of several liv
ing groups will also be present
at tonight's meeting. The com
mittee eventually hopes to have
representatives in all dormi
tories.
