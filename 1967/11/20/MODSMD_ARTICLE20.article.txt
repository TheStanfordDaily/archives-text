# New Pub Opens In Crothers
## 
### VICKI GRAHAM 
Stanford's first pub opened
this weekend in the basement of
Crothers Hall, home of 150 law
students.
"This is a Barristers Pub—not
the 'Goose' or the 'O,' " empha
sized the Pub's newly-appointed
manager, Jim Gansinger.
The Pub is a $20,000 combined
study and social facility for fac
ulty-student mixers and informal
get-togethers.
The Pub was dedicated Friday
afternoon. Dean Bayless Man
ning, Dean of the Law School,
turned the facility over to Cro
thers Hall and presented dorm
President Bill Hodge with a beer
mug. President Wallace Sterling
was on hand.
Parties Held In Pub
Crothers hosted law school
faculty members Friday night
and held an alumni luncheon be
fore the game on Saturday. Resi
dents held a Big Game party
that night in the Pub.
The Pub is run entirely by
Crothers residents and is inde
pendent of the law school. How
ever, it will be used for some
law school functions. It is open
only to members of Crothers
Hall and their guests.

No liquor will be sold on the
premises, in accordance with
campus liquor regulations. The
Pub will operate in much the
same way as the Faculty Club.
Co>op for Liquor
Crothers will supply all liquor
through a cooperative fund as
part of its social program. No
one will be served without his
membership card. Inventory
cards will be punched at the bar
to keep account of how much
liquor is served.
The Pub has been in the plan
ning stage for several years. It
is unique In that it required no
fund-raising.
It was financed almost entire
ly by $15,000 left over from con
struction of the Hall in 1952 and
set aside for improvements by
the late Judge Crothers. Addi
tional funds were arranged
through the Business Office.
One Man's Project?
Dave Leleware, Assistant to
the Dean of the Law School, and
Bill Friedricks of the Business
Office are largely responsible for
the design and finance of the
finished product. "In a sense, the
Pub is Dave Leleware's project,"
said Gansinger.

Crothers residents worked
closely with designers and con
tractors in building the Pub no
tably Rod Rickett, Teaching As
sistant, Bernie Bays, Resident
Associate, Bill Hodge, Dorm
President, Carl Mundt, head of
Social Committee, and Jim Gan
singer, manager.
At least two bartenders will
be on duty whenever the Pub is
open. One bartender may stand
by the door and check member
ship cards. The staff Includes
Bob Hoffman, David Worrell,
Jim Flynn, Pete Pierce, John
Sheppard, John Finney, and
Rick Mallory, Bartender-at large.
Pub Facilities
Actual construction time for
the Pub was about a month. The
room is panelled and partitioned
off into a lounge and study area
to be furnished with overstuffed
chairs and sofas.
The Pub is marked by con
siderable attention to detail, in
cluding amber-bottle glass win
dows, indirect and individually
controlled lighting, and a six
speaker stereo system.

cards will be punched at the bar
to keep account of how much
liquor is served.
The Pub has been in the plan
ning stage for several years. It
is unique In that it required no
fund-raising.
It was financed almost entire
ly by $15,000 left over from con
struction of the Hall in 1952 and
set aside for improvements by
the late Judge Crothers. Addi
tional funds were arranged
through the Business Office.
One Man's Project?
Dave Leleware, Assistant to
the Dean of the Law School, and
Bill Friedricks of the Business
Office are largely responsible for
the design and finance of the
finished product. "In a sense, the
Pub is Dave Leleware's project,"
said Gansinger.

Crothers residents worked
closely with designers and con
tractors in building the Pub no
tably Rod Rickett, Teaching As
sistant, Bernie Bays, Resident
Associate, Bill Hodge, Dorm
President, Carl Mundt, head of
Social Committee, and Jim Gan
singer, manager.
At least two bartenders will
be on duty whenever the Pub is
open. One bartender may stand
by the door and check member
ship cards. The staff Includes
Bob Hoffman, David Worrell,
Jim Flynn, Pete Pierce, John
Sheppard, John Finney, and
Rick Mallory, Bartender-at large.
Pub Facilities
Actual construction time for
the Pub was about a month. The
room is panelled and partitioned
off into a lounge and study area
to be furnished with overstuffed
chairs and sofas.
The Pub is marked by con
siderable attention to detail, in
cluding amber-bottle glass win
dows, indirect and individually
controlled lighting, and a six
speaker stereo system.
