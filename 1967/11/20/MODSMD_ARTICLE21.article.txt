# Deferment Policy
## Peace Corps Aids Volunteers 
### 
The Peace Corps announced
today it will intervene on be
half of Volunteers seeking draft
deferments for two years of
overseas service.
Director Jack Vaughn, re
portedly concerned by mount
ing induction calls to Peace
Corps volunteers serving over
seas, said he will take an "ac
tive role" in seeking future de
ferment cases before the Presi
dential Appeal Board —the court
of last resort for draft reclassi
fications.
In the past the agency per
formed a largely informational
function — advising volunteers
and trainees of Selective Serv
ice laws and procedures, and
confirming to local boards the
fact of the volunteer's service.
In future appeals, Vaughn will
write letters to the board de
scribing the circumstances in
each case and urging board
members to grant a deferment

until completion of the volun
teer's overseas tour.
"We have a serious situation,"
he said. "The problem of induc
tion notices to overseas volun
teers is becoming a major con
cern for us. Pulling a volunteer
off a productive job at mid-tour
is unfair to the nation, the host
country, the Peace Corps and
the individual."
Lost 60 Appeals
Vaughn said Peace Corps vol
unteers have lost about 60 de
ferment appeals before the
three-man Presidential board in
the last six and one-half years.
While adverse rulings by the na
tional board have involved less
than one-half of one per cent
of the estimated 15,000 draft
eligible men to have served in
the Peace Corps, "virtually all
of these have occurred in the
past year," he said.
The vast majority of Peace
Corps volunteers are granted

deferments because their service
is deemed by their local boards
to be "in the national interest,"
as recommended by Lt. Gen.
Lewis B. Hershey, the draft di
rector.
But some local Selective Serv
ice boards refuse deferments
even though Peace Corps serv
ice does not relieve volunteers
of their draft obligations. If
the local board is upheld by the
State Appeal Board, the case
may reach the Presidential Ap
peal Board which makes the
final decision.
The appeal process often
takes months to be resolved and
the Peace Corps frequently
sends volunteers to their over
seas sites while their appeals
for deferment are pending.
Vaughn said the Peace Corps,
having provided upwards of 400
hours of intensive language
training during the 12 to 14
weeks of preparation, often
sends volunteers overseas to be
gin service "rather than risk
the loss of their newly-earned
fluency during the long waits
for final approval of disapproval
of deferment requests.
Process To Be Reconsidered
"So long as the chances for
deferment are good this system
makes sense, but as more and
more volunteers lose their ap
peals we may have to recon
sider the process and keep them,
a wasting asset, in the United
States until their cases are re
solved."
Induction of volunteers over
seas "disrupts the continuity of
carefully planned projects by
host country governments who
also have invested a large
amount of time and money in
the program," he said.
Vaughn also noted that in a
number of cases, host country
governments have been unable
to replace drafted volunteer
teachers.
