# Season Of Comebacks Labels Cards As Men

### NICK SELBY 
A capsule summary of the
physical and spiritual fortunes
of the Stanford football team
this year: Despite mistakes that
erased Tribe victory hopes, the
team never stopped coming
back to fight again.
Against California Saturday,
little Chuck Williams bravely
faced the onslaught of Cal rush
ers, unable to avoid them if
they got past the Stanford
blockers, as he tried to bring
the Tribe back from a 19-3
deficit.
Despite his game efforts and
the sprints of Jon Huss, Stan
ford was unable to come back
and suffered a crushing 26-3 de
feat.
Facts Ahead Of Heartbreak
Several times this season,
however, Stanford has come
back and the dissipated, hum
bled Stanford players and
coaches tried to keep this fact
in mind as they reflected on the
season.
The team's ability to fight
from behind has lead coach
John Ralston to remark several
times that this has been his
most rewarding season of coach
ing. He repeated that statement
Saturday afternoon after the
loss.
Ralston would have finished a
season with a career winning
record at Stanford for the first
time if the Cards had won. His
Stanford record is now 24-25-1.
Rationalizing Defeat?
Ralston tried to rationalize
the defeat. "Momentum is so
important in a game like this.
When you have good momen
tum, mistakes won't hurt you.
But if it lags, watch out. Cal
took the momentum away in
the second half and won."
Ralston had said last week
that the odds against seven
straight wins in such a close
rivalry were beginning to build
up. But he maintained at the
end of the game that he didn't
believe in the law of averages.
"We just got licked," he said.

"We were beaten in every way.
We should have scored more
points in the first half; but
we've been a second half team
all year, so I thought we'd be
all right."
Seniors Hurt
A large part of the hurt of
losing Big Game had to be ab
sorbed by the seniors who won't
have another chance to play.
Tom Hazelrigg, senior de
fensive end, said, "I don't know
how I'd feel right now If we
hadn't beaten Washington this
year. That win alone made my
career at Stanford worthwhile."
Hazelrigg is from Olympia,
Washington.
"I sure would love to be here
next year, especially after to
day's loss," he concluded.
Jack Root, senior fullback
and tri-captain, also tried to re
flect on the season from his
demoralized viewpoint. "Cer
tainly I wanted to end my car
eer on a higher note, but I can't
ignore the breakthroughs we
made.
"We beat Washington and
Washington State for the first
time in many years. We just
made too many mistakes, gave
up the ball too many times to
win today."
Counted As Men
Gene Washington, junior
flanker who made ten recep
tions to take away the receiving
lead from Cal's Wayne Stewart,
looked on the season with
pride.
"Five and five doesn't seem
like a great record, but I'm still
proud. We almost came back to
beat UCLA; we came back to
go ahead of Army, but lost
there too. They weren't push
over teams in my book."
To paraphrase some lines
which appeared this season af
ter Stanford lost 30-0 to USC
leaving the season's prospects
indeed bleak, "But the players
and coaches, who found it most
hard, had to perk up and come
back again. They did the job
and can be counted as men."

all year, so I thought we'd be
all right."
Seniors Hurt
A large part of the hurt of
losing Big Game had to be ab
sorbed by the seniors who won't
have another chance to play.
Tom Hazelrigg, senior de
fensive end, said, "I don't know
how I'd feel right now If we
hadn't beaten Washington this
year. That win alone made my
career at Stanford worthwhile."
Hazelrigg is from Olympia,
Washington.
"I sure would love to be here
next year, especially after to
day's loss," he concluded.
Jack Root, senior fullback
and tri-captain, also tried to re
flect on the season from his
demoralized viewpoint. "Cer
tainly I wanted to end my car
eer on a higher note, but I can't
ignore the breakthroughs we
made.
"We beat Washington and
Washington State for the first
time in many years. We just
made too many mistakes, gave
up the ball too many times to
win today."
Counted As Men
Gene Washington, junior
flanker who made ten recep
tions to take away the receiving
lead from Cal's Wayne Stewart,
looked on the season with
pride.
"Five and five doesn't seem
like a great record, but I'm still
proud. We almost came back to
beat UCLA; we came back to
go ahead of Army, but lost
there too. They weren't push
over teams in my book."
To paraphrase some lines
which appeared this season af
ter Stanford lost 30-0 to USC
leaving the season's prospects
indeed bleak, "But the players
and coaches, who found it most
hard, had to perk up and come
back again. They did the job
and can be counted as men."
A capsule summary of the
physical and spiritual fortunes
of the Stanford football team
this year: Despite mistakes that
erased Tribe victory hopes, the
team never stopped coming
back to fight again.
Against California Saturday,
little Chuck Williams bravely
faced the onslaught of Cal rush
ers, unable to avoid them if
they got past the Stanford
blockers, as he tried to bring
the Tribe back from a 19-3
deficit.
Despite his game efforts and
the sprints of Jon Huss, Stan
ford was unable to come back
and suffered a crushing 26-3 de
feat.
Facts Ahead Of Heartbreak
Several times this season,
however, Stanford has come
back and the dissipated, hum
bled Stanford players and
coaches tried to keep this fact
in mind as they reflected on the
season.
The team's ability to fight
from behind has lead coach
John Ralston to remark several
times that this has been his
most rewarding season of coach
ing. He repeated that statement
Saturday afternoon after the
loss.
Ralston would have finished a
season with a career winning
record at Stanford for the first
time if the Cards had won. His
Stanford record is now 24-25-1.
Rationalizing Defeat?
Ralston tried to rationalize
the defeat. "Momentum is so
important in a game like this.
When you have good momen
tum, mistakes won't hurt you.
But if it lags, watch out. Cal
took the momentum away in
the second half and won."
Ralston had said last week
that the odds against seven
straight wins in such a close
rivalry were beginning to build
up. But he maintained at the
end of the game that he didn't
believe in the law of averages.
"We just got licked," he said.

"We were beaten in every way.
We should have scored more
points in the first half; but
we've been a second half team
all year, so I thought we'd be
all right."
