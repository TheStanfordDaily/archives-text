# Indian Theta Dells Wallop Cal SAE's
## 
### JOHN WRIGHT 
The Theta Delts put the finish
ing touch on a perfect intramu
ral touch football season when
they thumped SAE of Cal, 25-6,
Saturday in the Stadium.
They even did it without the
services of Fred Moseley, whose
superlative quarterbacking had
been the key to their success all
season long.
Moseley suffered a hairline
fracture of the cheekbone in

Wednesday's championship
game and did not suit up Satur
day.
Also missing from the Theta
Delt lineup was John Tracey,
the blocking back who tore some
shoulder ligaments Wednesday
protecting Moseley from the
ferocious Zete rush.
Subs Shine
Wilson Riles, who missed the
finals because of a concussion,
joined Bud Peterson at the

blocking hark positions Satur
day against SAE.
Boh Parker, a member of the
Theta Delts "B" team, was call
ed upon at the last moment to
fill in for Moseley at quarter
back, and responded on the first
play of the game with a 65-yard
touchdown pass to Phil Ensz.
The Theta Delts strategy of
a bomb to Ensz on the first play
of a game worked four times
earlier this season.

Flankerback John Scales call
ed all the Theta Dolt plays, and
Parker proved an exceptional
substitute for Moseley.
Parker threw three other TD
passes Saturday, hitting Scales
for 23 yards and a 13-6 halftime
lead. He then connected with Jim
Butler and Steve Ammons for
scores in the second half.
The one extra point came on
a Parker-Scales pass after the
game-opening touchdown.
Three All The Way
Three Theta Delts played both
ways Saturday. Parker had to
fill in at defensive corner as
well as quarterback when Ensz
suffered a badly sprained ankle
midway in the first half. Scales
and Van Fishback also played
the full twenty minutes.
Cal's SAE team did not turn
out to be exceptionally talented,
despite its mammoth propor
tions. The SAE's have a game
this afternoon with Sigma Chi
at Berkeley in the playoffs of
Cal's IM football season.
Cal's university champion will
not be officially determined un
til after Thanksgiving.
Rule Difference
The only major difference be
tween the touch football rules
at Stanford and Cal corncerns
the quarterback option play.
About the most difficult play
to defense in touch football, the

option is allowed under Stan
ford rules but has been elimi
nated at Berkeley.
Under Cad's rules, on a play
when the quarterback runs with
the ball, the snap from center

must have originally been made
to a blocking back.
SAE had no trouble playing
under Stanford rules because
the Theta Delts went exclusively
with their passing game.

fill in at defensive corner as
well as quarterback when Ensz
suffered a badly sprained ankle
midway in the first half. Scales
and Van Fishback also played
the full twenty minutes.
Cal's SAE team did not turn
out to be exceptionally talented,
despite its mammoth propor
tions. The SAE's have a game
this afternoon with Sigma Chi
at Berkeley in the playoffs of
Cal's IM football season.
Cal's university champion will

Rule Difference
The only major difference be
tween the touch football rules
at Stanford and Cal corncerns
the quarterback option play.
About the most difficult play
to defense in touch football, the

option is allowed under Stan
ford rules but has been elimi
nated at Berkeley.
Under Cad's rules, on a play
when the quarterback runs with
the ball, the snap from center

must have originally been made
to a blocking back.
SAE had no trouble playing
under Stanford rules because
the Theta Delts went exclusively
with their passing game.
The Theta Delts put the finish
ing touch on a perfect intramu
ral touch football season when
they thumped SAE of Cal, 25-6,
Saturday in the Stadium.
They even did it without the
services of Fred Moseley, whose
superlative quarterbacking had
been the key to their success all
season long.
Moseley suffered a hairline
fracture of the cheekbone in

Wednesday's championship
game and did not suit up Satur
day.
Also missing from the Theta
Delt lineup was John Tracey,
the blocking back who tore some
shoulder ligaments Wednesday
protecting Moseley from the
ferocious Zete rush.
Subs Shine
Wilson Riles, who missed the
finals because of a concussion,
joined Bud Peterson at the

blocking hark positions Satur
day against SAE.
Boh Parker, a member of the
Theta Delts "B" team, was call
ed upon at the last moment to
fill in for Moseley at quarter
back, and responded on the first
play of the game with a 65-yard
touchdown pass to Phil Ensz.
The Theta Delts strategy of
a bomb to Ensz on the first play
of a game worked four times
earlier this season.

Flankerback John Scales call
ed all the Theta Dolt plays, and
Parker proved an exceptional
substitute for Moseley.
Parker threw three other TD
passes Saturday, hitting Scales
for 23 yards and a 13-6 halftime
lead. He then connected with Jim
Butler and Steve Ammons for
scores in the second half.
The one extra point came on
a Parker-Scales pass after the
game-opening touchdown.
Three All The Way
Three Theta Delts played both
ways Saturday. Parker had to
fill in at defensive corner as
well as quarterback when Ensz
suffered a badly sprained ankle
midway in the first half. Scales
and Van Fishback also played
the full twenty minutes.
