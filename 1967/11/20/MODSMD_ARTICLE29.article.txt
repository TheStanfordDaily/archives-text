## Bears Submerge Tribe In Water Balloon Battle 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Nick Selby, Editor

The famed Stanford water bal
loon cannon was soundly defeat
ed by a primitive Cal weapon
in a wet and wild showdown bat
tle on White Plaza Saturday.
Cal successfully used Viet
Cong-style guerrilla tactics to
nullify the Stanford cannon's
overwhelming technological su
periority.
The cannon, a seven-foot steel
tube which fires water balloons
with blasts of compressed air,
was developed by Bob Parsons
as a project for an engineering
course.
Under the right conditions, it
is an awesomely effective wea
pon, easily capable of launching
water balloons the length of
White Plaza with deadly accu
racy. But the conditions were
ji st not suited for the cannon's
r- al capabilities.
Cal's Clever Tactics
The Cal water squad's device
was laughably simple, but no one
laughed when it moved into ac
tion. The weapon was actually a
giant slingshot, consisting of a
bright blue doggie dish firmly
attached to two monstrous rub
ber bands.
When held by two men and
stretched out to an incredible
20 feet by a third, it could hurl
its fragile projectile 50 yards —
about half the range of the rival
cannon.
Cal immediately recognized
the futility of digging in and
slugging it out at long range,
and fiendishly decided on a very
clever tactic — they simply
moved up closer.
The cannon was suddenly out
of its element. The Stanford
camp, now on the defensive,
tried lowering their air pressure

to decrease the range, but could
not find a consistent trajectory.
They frantically jacked up the
air pressure again, and trying
the "high lob" method, raised
the cannon from its maximum
range angle of 45 degrees to 75.
This also proved ineffective,
and the few balloons on target
were easy to dodge because of
their high, floating trajectories.
Cal's missiles, on the other
hand, came in low and fast from
directly out of the sun. (Stanford
had earlier made the gross tac
tical blunder of choosing to de
fend the east end of the plaza.)
The Stanford crew, dodging
the constant stream of on-target
Cal balloons and tomatoes, then
tried a low-trajectory angle of
15 degrees. They managed a few
near misses but were unable to
score a direct hit on any Cal
men.
The Bears pulled off another
strategic ambush by cleverly
concealing a second launcher un
der the arches of Engineering
Corner and peppering away from
the rear.
The two units, constantly in
communication over a walkie
talkie system, kept the Stanford
team and its supporters ducking
and dodging without respite.
The main factor in Stanford's
downfall was the cannon's lack
of versatility. It was designed
to blast stationary targets at dis
tances of around a hundred
yards (the Cal rooting section,
say), and this it does beautifully.
But in a mobile, tactical, gue
rilla conflict, it simply cannot
cope with a constantly shifting
enemy at close range.
It was unfortunate that the
battle was ideally suited to Cal's
tactics and equipment. It was
a war that required more than
just technological superiority.

The famed Stanford water bal
loon cannon was soundly defeat
ed by a primitive Cal weapon
in a wet and wild showdown bat
tle on White Plaza Saturday.
Cal successfully used Viet
Cong-style guerrilla tactics to
nullify the Stanford cannon's
overwhelming technological su
periority.
The cannon, a seven-foot steel
tube which fires water balloons
with blasts of compressed air,
was developed by Bob Parsons
as a project for an engineering
course.
Under the right conditions, it
is an awesomely effective wea
pon, easily capable of launching
water balloons the length of
White Plaza with deadly accu
racy. But the conditions were
ji st not suited for the cannon's
r- al capabilities.
Cal's Clever Tactics
The Cal water squad's device
was laughably simple, but no one
laughed when it moved into ac
tion. The weapon was actually a
giant slingshot, consisting of a
bright blue doggie dish firmly
attached to two monstrous rub
ber bands.
When held by two men and
stretched out to an incredible
20 feet by a third, it could hurl
its fragile projectile 50 yards —
about half the range of the rival
cannon.
Cal immediately recognized
the futility of digging in and
slugging it out at long range,
and fiendishly decided on a very
clever tactic — they simply
moved up closer.
The cannon was suddenly out
of its element. The Stanford
camp, now on the defensive,
tried lowering their air pressure

to decrease the range, but could
not find a consistent trajectory.
They frantically jacked up the
air pressure again, and trying
the "high lob" method, raised
the cannon from its maximum
range angle of 45 degrees to 75.
This also proved ineffective,
and the few balloons on target
were easy to dodge because of
their high, floating trajectories.
Cal's missiles, on the other
hand, came in low and fast from
directly out of the sun. (Stanford
had earlier made the gross tac
tical blunder of choosing to de
fend the east end of the plaza.)
The Stanford crew, dodging
the constant stream of on-target
Cal balloons and tomatoes, then
tried a low-trajectory angle of
15 degrees. They managed a few
near misses but were unable to
score a direct hit on any Cal
men.
The Bears pulled off another
strategic ambush by cleverly
concealing a second launcher un
der the arches of Engineering
Corner and peppering away from
the rear.
The two units, constantly in
communication over a walkie
talkie system, kept the Stanford
team and its supporters ducking
and dodging without respite.
The main factor in Stanford's
downfall was the cannon's lack
of versatility. It was designed
to blast stationary targets at dis
tances of around a hundred
yards (the Cal rooting section,
say), and this it does beautifully.
But in a mobile, tactical, gue
rilla conflict, it simply cannot
cope with a constantly shifting
enemy at close range.
It was unfortunate that the
battle was ideally suited to Cal's
tactics and equipment. It was
a war that required more than
just technological superiority.
