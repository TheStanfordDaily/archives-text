# Math Undergrads To Rate Courses
## 
### 
Students from the Mathema
tics Department will give advice
to lower classmen, especially
freshmen, and transfers when
they form a panel tomorrow at
4:15 in Room 380 C to discuss
complaints about the Math De
partment. They will discuss
good and bad professors, boring
and interesting courses, and the
order in which courses should
be taken.
Although the panel is inde
pendent of the department,
Professor Karel deLeeuw orig
inally got the students together
to talk. He did it first for the
graduate students so they would
have an opportunity to "gripe
about the department."
Undergraduate Discussion
DeLeeuw later decided that it
would benefit the undergradu
ates to have a coffee hour dis
cussion among themselves. He
sent letters to many math stu
dents and invited them to come.
There have been two Monday
meetings which interested stu
dents have attended.
He thinks it is important for
students in every department,
not only mathematics, to com
municate. It is the juniors and

seniors who "know everything
the department."
Denny McGuire, a senior who
helped organize the panel, said
that at one Monday meeting th<Â»
students decided that having a
panel would he very helpful
for any student contemplating
taking a math course. In seek
ing advice, McGuire feels that
"someone who's taken a course
is the best person to talk to."
Students Told To Question
McGuire recommends that
students ask questions, not be
lieve what the University says,
and turn to the department sec
retaries for help.
He has learned from exper
ience that the recommended or
der of courses often puts stu
dents in boring and unchalleng
ing courses when, with rear
rangement, thev could be taking
the more interesting honors
courses. Freshmen who are
given advanced placement often
are misdirected by the Univers
ity in choosing courses. Mc-
Guire commented that the pre
requisite courses sometimes
have no bearing on the courses
they are needed for.
