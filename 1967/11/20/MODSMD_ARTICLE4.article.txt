# Kennedy Favors Bid By McCarthy
## 
### 
Senator Robert F. Kennedy de
clared yesterday that it would
be "a healthy influence on the
Democratic Party" if Senator
Eugene McCarthy were to enter
the race for the Democratic
Presidential nomination.
Speaking at Marymount Col
lege in Tarrytown, N.Y., Ken
nedy said that McCarthy's can
didacy would "add a great deal
of excitement and interest to
the Democratic party. It would
allow Americans to take out a
great deal of their frustration
(over the war) in talk instead
of violence. It would be a major,
important service to our socie
ty."
Kennedy thus modified his
previous statement that he
would support President John
son's bid for a second full term.
In answering a question about
whether he still supported John
son's candidacy, Kennedy said
that he would support whoever
was nominated by the Demo
cratic Party.

Senator McCarthy has active
ly been considering challenging
President Johnson in the 1968
Presidential primaries.
On Wednesday the Minnesota
Senator said that any bid he
would make for the Democratic
nomination would be aimed at
giving voters a chance to exert
the kind of pressure which he
feels might force the President
to change his course in Vietnam.
"It has got to be presented
with personal identification,"
said the Senator of a move to
force the President to change
his policies. "It can't be dealt
with as an abstract issue. If it is
identified with a personality in
the primaries the people can
make their judgment."
Friends of Senator Kennedy
have declared he has no inten
tion of actively supporting ei
ther President Johnson or Sen
ator McCarthy in any primaries.
They reasserted however that
Kennedy feels no obligation to
support Johnson until he is
nominated.
