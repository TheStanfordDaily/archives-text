# For Berkeley 'Disruption'
## Students Nix Protest Plans 
### 
In a mass meeting last night
Berkeley students decided not to
carry out the proposed "mill-in"
today to protest the possible
suspension of 11 students for
participation in illegal rallies
during last month's "Stop The
Draft Week."
* Instead there will be a rally
today on the campus and per
haps a march to the Chancel
lor's office.
Demonstrators today intend to
protest non-violently. But some
said they would resist any at
tempt to arrest them.
Professor of Mathematics

Moe Hirsch chaired the three
and-a-half-hour meeting which
about 1,000 students attended. It
was understood that those at
tending favored some sort of
disruption of the university if
Chancellor Robert Heyns does
not soon announce his decision
on whether to suspend the 11.
The meeting in Wheeler Audi
torium, described by one ob
server as "chaotic", rejected
proposals to set a deadline for
Heyns to announce his decision.
After the deadline the students
would have begun disruptive
tactics.
The Movement Against Politi

cal Suspension (MAPS), which
sponsored the meeting, earlier
had said students might "mill
in" in Sproul Hall, clogging cor
ridors and forming lines at win
dows.
The 11 whose suspension is
being considered have refused
to bring the case before a stu
dent-faculty committee to which
they might appeal. The commit
tee reportedly would reject sus
pension of the students. But the
accused want to have the de
cision come directly from the
chancellor.
Chancellor Heyns has been in
the east and is returning today.

He will begin perusal of recom
mendations by the dean of stu
dents that the 11 be suspended
and seven others be placed on
disciplinary probation.
Acting under a Superior
Court restraining order last
month, University of California
officials refused to give students
permission to use campus facili
ties to plan anti-draft demon
strations in neighboring Oak
land.
Four illegal rallies were none
theless held during the week of
October 16. No attempt was
made by campus police to stop
the rallies.

and seven others be placed on
disciplinary probation.
Acting under a Superior
Court restraining order last
month, University of California
officials refused to give students
permission to use campus facili
ties to plan anti-draft demon
strations in neighboring Oak
land.
Four illegal rallies were none

October 16. No attempt was
made by campus police to stop
the rallies.
In a mass meeting last night
Berkeley students decided not to
carry out the proposed "mill-in"
today to protest the possible
suspension of 11 students for
participation in illegal rallies
during last month's "Stop The
Draft Week."
* Instead there will be a rally
today on the campus and per
haps a march to the Chancel
lor's office.
Demonstrators today intend to
protest non-violently. But some
said they would resist any at
tempt to arrest them.
Professor of Mathematics

Moe Hirsch chaired the three
and-a-half-hour meeting which
about 1,000 students attended. It
was understood that those at
tending favored some sort of
disruption of the university if
Chancellor Robert Heyns does
not soon announce his decision
on whether to suspend the 11.
The meeting in Wheeler Audi
torium, described by one ob
server as "chaotic", rejected
proposals to set a deadline for
Heyns to announce his decision.
After the deadline the students
would have begun disruptive
tactics.
The Movement Against Politi

cal Suspension (MAPS), which
sponsored the meeting, earlier
had said students might "mill
in" in Sproul Hall, clogging cor
ridors and forming lines at win
dows.
The 11 whose suspension is
being considered have refused
to bring the case before a stu
dent-faculty committee to which
they might appeal. The commit
tee reportedly would reject sus
pension of the students. But the
accused want to have the de
cision come directly from the
chancellor.
Chancellor Heyns has been in
the east and is returning today.

He will begin perusal of recom
mendations by the dean of stu
dents that the 11 be suspended
and seven others be placed on
disciplinary probation.
