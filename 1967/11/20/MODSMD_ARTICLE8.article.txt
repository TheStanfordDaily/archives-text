# Roble Dollies May Adopt Key System
## 
### 
Roble Hall, the last campus
residence where women can be
locked out if they don't meet a
curfew, may soon adopt the key
system prevalent elsewhere.
Tonight Judith Anderson,
Roble director, will explain to
the 270 Roble freshmen how
each would be given a key that
would fit the front door of the
dormitory, under a plan now
being considered.
Under present rules, the
doors to the old stone residence
on Santa Teresa street are
locked nightly at 2:30 a.m.
Freshmen girls are not per
mitted out later than that time
unless they have taken an
"overnight."
The key plan would have out
side doors locked at 10:30 p.m.
The key plan is not being
studied only as a reform in
social regulations. It is envis
ioned as a solution to Roble's

security problems, especially
keeping out undesirable loiter
ers late at night.
At the meeting tonight the
details of the key plan will be
presented to the freshmen girls.
Sally Mahoney, associate dean
of students for residences, will
discuss the plan with a group
of Roble residents Nov. 27. The
final decision on the key plan
will be made by Miss Mahoney.
Questions To Be Answered
Questions of plausibility and
practicality must be answered
before the plan is adopted, ac
cording to Miss Anderson. If
accepted, the key system could
go into effect as early as winter
quarter or as late as next Sep
tember.
Miss Anderson is concerned
over the ease with which resi
dents could return after the 2:30
late night regulation deadline
for freshmen, but noted if a girl
wants to stay out later now
there are ways she can arrange
to slip back into the dorm.
Presently, residents may gain
entrance to the building after
the door has been locked by call
ing an emergency number. "We
hesitate to call except in a real
emergency," said one girl, "and
feel like we must choose be
tween 2:30 and all night. It's
really hard to get back from
the City in time."
Miss Mahoney said the key
proposal is an "administrative"
question concerning the "secur
ity of the building." She notes,
"The principle of a key system
is established, but there are
problems in a larger house like
Roble that there aren't in
smaller houses." Miss Mahoney
said the plan could be imple
mented at Roble through action
by her office and the business
office.
Women at all other campus
residences can gain entrance to
their dormitories at any hour.

Freshman girls living in coedu
cational Branner hall have keys,
and the doors in coed demon
stration houses are never
locked.
Four Objectives
The proposal to change over
to the key system at Roble is
outlined in a three-page memor
andum. It cites four objectives
of the plan:
"1. To promote student re
sponsibility in maintaining the
security of Roble Hall.
"2. To promote the physical
safety of individuals within
Roble Hall.
"3. To contribute to the eli
mination of damage and theft
that may be attributed to un
desirable visitors.
"4. To enhance the safety of
the night assistant, or other staff
members on duty."
Genesis Of Proposal
Miss Anderson relates that the
proposal grew from a "combina
tion of concern on the part of
students and staff" with these
problems. The proposal has been
discussed and edited by all cor
ridor presidents, Roble Club
house officers, tutors and spon
sors. Work on it began about
three weeks ago.
"The key system places the
responsibility for the living
group where it belongs — with
the students," said Miss Ander
son. She expressed the hope that
the girls would consider the
dorm on the same level as a
private home and use as much
discretion in letting people in
with their keys as they would
letting a guest into their homes.
Miss Mahoney stated she and
Miss Anderson had raised sev
eral questions concerning wheth
er the key system was the best
solution to the security problem,
what its purpose would be in
the eyes of the students, and
whether it should be implement
ed now or next year.

the door has been locked by call
ing an emergency number. "We
hesitate to call except in a real
emergency," said one girl, "and
feel like we must choose be
tween 2:30 and all night. It's
really hard to get back from
the City in time."
Miss Mahoney said the key
proposal is an "administrative"
question concerning the "secur
ity of the building." She notes,
"The principle of a key system
is established, but there are
problems in a larger house like
Roble that there aren't in
smaller houses." Miss Mahoney
said the plan could be imple
mented at Roble through action
by her office and the business
office.
Women at all other campus
residences can gain entrance to
their dormitories at any hour.

Freshman girls living in coedu
cational Branner hall have keys,
and the doors in coed demon
stration houses are never
locked.
Four Objectives
The proposal to change over
to the key system at Roble is
outlined in a three-page memor
andum. It cites four objectives
of the plan:
"1. To promote student re
sponsibility in maintaining the
security of Roble Hall.
"2. To promote the physical
safety of individuals within
Roble Hall.
"3. To contribute to the eli
mination of damage and theft
that may be attributed to un
desirable visitors.
"4. To enhance the safety of
the night assistant, or other staff
members on duty."
Genesis Of Proposal
Miss Anderson relates that the
proposal grew from a "combina
tion of concern on the part of
students and staff" with these
problems. The proposal has been
discussed and edited by all cor
ridor presidents, Roble Club
house officers, tutors and spon
sors. Work on it began about
three weeks ago.
"The key system places the
responsibility for the living
group where it belongs — with
the students," said Miss Ander
son. She expressed the hope that
the girls would consider the
dorm on the same level as a
private home and use as much
discretion in letting people in
with their keys as they would
letting a guest into their homes.
Miss Mahoney stated she and
Miss Anderson had raised sev
eral questions concerning wheth
er the key system was the best
solution to the security problem,
what its purpose would be in
the eyes of the students, and
whether it should be implement
ed now or next year.
Roble Hall, the last campus
residence where women can be
locked out if they don't meet a
curfew, may soon adopt the key
system prevalent elsewhere.
Tonight Judith Anderson,
Roble director, will explain to
the 270 Roble freshmen how
each would be given a key that
would fit the front door of the
dormitory, under a plan now
being considered.
Under present rules, the
doors to the old stone residence
on Santa Teresa street are
locked nightly at 2:30 a.m.
Freshmen girls are not per
mitted out later than that time
unless they have taken an
"overnight."
The key plan would have out
side doors locked at 10:30 p.m.
The key plan is not being
studied only as a reform in
social regulations. It is envis
ioned as a solution to Roble's

security problems, especially
keeping out undesirable loiter
ers late at night.
At the meeting tonight the
details of the key plan will be
presented to the freshmen girls.
Sally Mahoney, associate dean
of students for residences, will
discuss the plan with a group
of Roble residents Nov. 27. The
final decision on the key plan
will be made by Miss Mahoney.
Questions To Be Answered
Questions of plausibility and
practicality must be answered
before the plan is adopted, ac
cording to Miss Anderson. If
accepted, the key system could
go into effect as early as winter
quarter or as late as next Sep
tember.
Miss Anderson is concerned
over the ease with which resi
dents could return after the 2:30
late night regulation deadline
for freshmen, but noted if a girl
wants to stay out later now
there are ways she can arrange
to slip back into the dorm.
Presently, residents may gain
entrance to the building after
the door has been locked by call
ing an emergency number. "We

"The key system places the
responsibility for the living
group where it belongs — with
the students," said Miss Ander
son. She expressed the hope that
the girls would consider the
dorm on the same level as a
private home and use as much
discretion in letting people in
with their keys as they would
letting a guest into their homes.
Miss Mahoney stated she and
Miss Anderson had raised sev
eral questions concerning wheth
er the key system was the best
solution to the security problem,
what its purpose would be in
the eyes of the students, and
whether it should be implement
ed now or next year.
Roble Hall, the last campus
residence where women can be
locked out if they don't meet a
curfew, may soon adopt the key
system prevalent elsewhere.
Tonight Judith Anderson,
Roble director, will explain to
the 270 Roble freshmen how
each would be given a key that
would fit the front door of the
dormitory, under a plan now
being considered.
Under present rules, the
doors to the old stone residence
on Santa Teresa street are
locked nightly at 2:30 a.m.
Freshmen girls are not per
mitted out later than that time
unless they have taken an
"overnight."
The key plan would have out
side doors locked at 10:30 p.m.
The key plan is not being
studied only as a reform in
social regulations. It is envis
ioned as a solution to Roble's

security problems, especially
keeping out undesirable loiter
ers late at night.
At the meeting tonight the
details of the key plan will be
presented to the freshmen girls.
Sally Mahoney, associate dean
of students for residences, will
discuss the plan with a group
of Roble residents Nov. 27. The
final decision on the key plan
will be made by Miss Mahoney.
Questions To Be Answered
Questions of plausibility and
practicality must be answered
before the plan is adopted, ac
cording to Miss Anderson. If
accepted, the key system could
go into effect as early as winter
quarter or as late as next Sep
tember.
Miss Anderson is concerned
over the ease with which resi
dents could return after the 2:30
late night regulation deadline
for freshmen, but noted if a girl
wants to stay out later now
there are ways she can arrange
to slip back into the dorm.
Presently, residents may gain
entrance to the building after
the door has been locked by call
ing an emergency number. "We
hesitate to call except in a real
emergency," said one girl, "and
feel like we must choose be
tween 2:30 and all night. It's
really hard to get back from
the City in time."
Miss Mahoney said the key
proposal is an "administrative"
question concerning the "secur
ity of the building." She notes,
"The principle of a key system
is established, but there are
problems in a larger house like
Roble that there aren't in
smaller houses." Miss Mahoney
said the plan could be imple
mented at Roble through action
by her office and the business
office.
Women at all other campus
residences can gain entrance to
their dormitories at any hour.

Freshman girls living in coedu
cational Branner hall have keys,
and the doors in coed demon
stration houses are never
locked.
Four Objectives
The proposal to change over
to the key system at Roble is
outlined in a three-page memor
andum. It cites four objectives
of the plan:
"1. To promote student re
sponsibility in maintaining the
security of Roble Hall.
"2. To promote the physical
safety of individuals within
Roble Hall.
"3. To contribute to the eli
mination of damage and theft
that may be attributed to un
desirable visitors.
"4. To enhance the safety of
the night assistant, or other staff
members on duty."
Genesis Of Proposal
Miss Anderson relates that the
proposal grew from a "combina
tion of concern on the part of
students and staff" with these
problems. The proposal has been
discussed and edited by all cor
ridor presidents, Roble Club
house officers, tutors and spon
sors. Work on it began about
three weeks ago.
"The key system places the
responsibility for the living
group where it belongs — with
