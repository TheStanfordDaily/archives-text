# Heart Transplant Awaits Test Case
## 
### 
Stanford Medical School sur
geons are ready to conduct the
first human heart transplant in
history, but are still looking for
the perfect situation for the
transfer.
In an interview which will be
released today with the Journal
of the American Medical Asso
ciation, Dr. Norman E. Shumway
claimed:
"We have achieved a degree
of experience with heart trans
plantation in the laboratory and
we feel confident we can take
appropriate care of the patient
with a cardiac transplant.
But before the doctors can go
ahead, they need volunteers for
their experiment.
One volunteer must be dying
—but with a sound heart — and
the other must be suffering from
a heart problem.
The most likely candidate to
receive the heart would be a
patient whose normal heart beat
could not be restored after open

heart surgery, Dr. Shumway ex
plained.
The ideal donor would be a
younger person who is dying of
causes unrelated to heart
trouble, he said.
The breakthrough in heart
transplants came after years of
research by the Stanford doctors.
Dr. Shumway, who heads *he
division of cardiovascular sur
gery at the Medical School, said
the experiments showed a heart
can be removed from dogs as
much as 30 minutes after death
without causing injury to the
organ.
Storing the heart in a cold
saline solution will lengthen its
"life" about seven hours, he said,
but other methods may also be
used.
He explained the heart trans
plant techniques will have to
bo reserved for emergencies. And
the chances of actually per
forming the transfer are limit
ed by the availability of suit
able donors.
