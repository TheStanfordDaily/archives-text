# Students Refuse To Hear Encina CIA Protest Case
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
In a letter delivered yesterday
to Dean of Students Joel Smith,
Student Judicial Council Chair
man John Raskin refused to
prosecute ten students Smith
charged with violating Univer
sity demonstrations policy in an
anti-Central Intelligence Agency
(CIA) protest Nov. 1.
This statement serves as a re
jection by student government
of a role as enforcer of Univer
sity regulations for student con
duct.
In addition the student legisla
ture is expected to vote tonight
on a by-laws amendment that
would interpret student viola
tions of University policy as not
necessarily being violations of
the Fundamental Standard, the
student code of conduct which
the Judicial Council enforces.
Speaker Michael Weinstein
called the special session of
LASSU for 7:30 tonight in Room
370.
The proposed by-laws amend
ment states explicitly, ''Viola
tions of University policies and
regulations are not per se vio
lations of the Fundamental Stan
dard."
Smith Acts
After receiving Raskin's let
ter, Smith said that he will "im
mediately submit the case to
the Interim Judicial Board
(IJB.)" The IJB is an all-faculty
appellate board over the Judicial
Council.
Smith also stated that he could
not see how the proposed by
laws amendment by LASSU
could be considered effective
Nov. 1, the day of the door
blocking protest by the accused
demonstrators of the CIA re
cruiters on campus.
"LASSU doesn't have juris

diction at this point ... it can
not affect this particular case,"
he said.
Raskin, in his letter to Smith,
states that the precedent of con
sidering all University policy
violations as ASSU Funda
mental Standard violations is
"unacceptable to the Council.
"It forces the Council into the
indefensible position of punish
ing fellow students for actions
which the Council may interpret
not to be in violation of the Fun
damental Standard."
IJB Decision
This precedent came last
spring as the IJB decided in the
Marc Sapir sit-in case of 1966
that "the violation of University
law, policy and regulations is
also a violation of the Funda
mental Standard."
The case came before the IJB
when Dean Smith appealed a
Judicial Council decision that
medical student Marc Sapir's
participation in the sit-in at
President Sterling's office in
May of 1966 did not violate the
Fundamental Standard.
The ASSU constitution and by
laws include no prohibition on
demonstrations. The only rele
vant section — known as the
Fundamental Standard — states
that students must show "re
spect for order, morality, per
sonal honor, and the rights of
others."
The IJB, in its decision, de
clared Sapir in violation of the
Fundamental Standard and ord
ered his case back to the Judicial
Council for sentencing, a direct
over-ruling of the Council's earl
ier decision.
First Rejection
Raskin's letter is the first of
ficial student rejection of the
IJB's assertion that violation of

University policy is a per se a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard. Raskin denounced the
"usurpation of the Council's
power and function. ... In cases
involving the Sapir precedent,
the right of a Stanford student
to be heard by his peers is a
fiction.
'The Sapir decision is the
clearest expression of the fact
that in the existing judicial
structure the ASSU Judicial
Council has real power only at
the discretion of the administra
tion."
The Council therefore refused
to hear the CIA demonstrators'
case, stating that "as long as
the judicial process includes the
Sapir precedent, its operation as
applied to these defendants
would peopardize their right to
be judged by their peers ....
[the Council] cannot allow its
decision as to the guilt or inno
cence of the defendants with re
gard to the Fundamental Stan
dard to be rendered merely sym
bolic by precedent, or by the in
equities of the existing judicial
process."
Raskin Sees Solution
Raskin sees the solution to
this dilemma in LASSU legisla
tion that would "clarify the
Council's interpretation of its
function, and nullify the effect
of the Sapir decision."
Until clarifying legislation is
enacted, the Council "will con
tinue to take the position that
violations of university policy
are not per se violations of the
Fundamental Standard. The
Council shall not impose penal
ties on students whom it does
not consider to have violated the
Fundamental Standard."
The proposed ASSU by-laws
change would clarify the Coun
cil's position. If the legislation
is enacted, the Council could
then take up the demonstrators'
case and judge it by interpret
ing the Fundamental Standard
as it appears in ASSU by-laws,
not necessaritly as a violation
of University policy.
An addition and amendment to
this bill would nullify the ap
pellate jurisdiction of the IJB.
The amendment states that the
ASSU would not recognize any
appellate board over the Coun
cil that does not include both
students and faculty.
Smith feels that LASSU's pro
posed move is "an attempt to

foreclose debate." He concedes
that the legislature has the au
thority to make such a change
in the ASSU by-laws, but he
questions if such a "clarifica
tion" would be retroactive to the
events of November 1.
The prospects of getting a
student-faculty judicial appeals
board are now "zero," accord
ing to Smith. A similar proposal
was made once before, but
failed. "We couldn't get agree
ment in the Committee of
Fifteen on how the student
members were to be appointed."
LASSU is also expected to re
view several resolutions tonight
that were not considered at last
Thursday's stormy session over
Committee of Fifteen nomina
tions.
On the agenda is a "sense of
the legislature" bill for $5,000
by the Institute for Interna
tion Relations, a by-laws amend
ment on Medical School election
procedures, and resolutions on a
students demonstrations com
mittee, the job placement cen
ter, National Student Associa
tion appropriations, and support
for Berkeley students facing
suspension for participation in
illegal anti-draft rallies.
