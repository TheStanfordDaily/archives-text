# The 						Black Maze-Saddha
## And What Is Left After All The Smoke Is Cleared Away? 
### Theodore F. Spearman, Jr 
Archbishops, sailors and sad
virgins may still find that glory
and proud purity go hand in
hand with the essence of forged
sensitivity. The plague of inno
cence leeches upon the would be
gift of radical, lunatic, vapid ang
er. And this constant puck . . .
sucks at the fire until its heat
and desire becomes ash which
floats to rest upon paper and
takes the form of column scum.
BLACK POWER:
A red eyed dog of mad temp
erment screaming as he runs
his linger nails through the flesh
of his face, or as the governor
of California says . . . "MAD
DOGS" ... a savage. And he
spits upon you and your fake
world of physical science. "...

Did you think that when those
heads that (your) fathers had
forcibly boWed down to the
ground were reused again, you
would find adoration in their
eyes?" You're better off today
than you've ever been! Keep
cool, you're almost equal to
me!
But in what world will the
victim sink to crawl beside the
snake that has bitten him? And
then rise to say, "shaa enough."
A very crude analogy? ... in
deed. For it is a very crude sys
tem. Crude? It will take three
years of hard work to make
Stanford's administration adopt
a strong "minority student re
cruiting program" . . . or . . .
one year, if they suddenly find

out that Harvard already has
one . . . or . . . one day if all
hell breaks loose on this cam
pus.
Mr. college president, you put
Stanford students in Europe . . .
would it be so difficult for you to
put sensitive Americans in Stan
ford? Would it be so difficult to
look at your slurring critics and
say, "It is right and it is need
ed."
The sickening thought being:
a "minority student recruiting
program" wouldn't be worth
hell.
BLACK POWER:
Fire, smoke and maybe a vote!
The fiercest fire burns only in
the black heart. It's kindled by
watching a sixty-nine year old
man get his head shot off in
East Palo Alto by a cop's shot
gun, by seeing an old wineman
get kicked in the back on a
Greyhound bus because he sang
a song â€” "That China man com
ing soon . . . but he don't want
to get me . . . you don't like my
sweat? . . . then get off of here
and let ME breathe!"; and it is
thinking, "what is there of me
that stands apart from your
sins?"
The thickest smoke looms only
at your discussion table and in
my private discussions. You try
to discuss my alienation as a TV
commercial does yours. And you
have succeeded. (For now.)
The vote? A sad, pathetic sub
stance which shows a beginning.
And any beginning has a way
of clearing away the smoke.
And where there is no smoke
there is either a burning flame
or a dead man.
