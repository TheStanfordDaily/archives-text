## War Of Intellectual Liberation 
### Harvey Hukari 
Once again the Hydra-headed
monster of doctrinaire radical
ism has emerged from its insu
lated cavern of bias and preju
dice to display a form of in
tolerance Which, unfortunately,
is no longer alien to the Stan
ford community.
The frenzy of attacks on the
CIA, the Hoover Institution,
Dow Chemical and the Oakland
police are this autumn's ex
amples of what a supposedly
liberal brand of education has
inspired, namely a pervasive at
titude of attempting to malic
iously destroy any individual or
group which does not conform
to those strictures of Liberal or
Radical doctrine delineated by
SDS, the Resistance or The
Dally editorial page.
At the core of this mentality
of intolerance is the employ
ment of a double standard of
analysis which deplores the lack
of Liberal researchers in
Hoover Tower but never pon
ders over the conspicuous ab
sence of Conservative scholars
in the Stanford Political Science
Department, never wonders why
so little attention is given to
Objectivism by the Philosophy
Department and never questions
the bias of an Economics De
partment which virtually ex

cludes the works of such Liber
tarians as Milton Friedman and
Ludwig von Mises.
Strangely enough, the same
charges of political prejudice
which are leveled at the profes
sors and administrators at
Hoover are rarely directed to
wards the teaching assistants In
the departments of Freshman
English or Western Civilization.
It is that same type of out
look that has fostered attacks
on members of the Hoover for
their participation in political
activities but has had only
praise for the likes of such men
as Prof. George Leppert of the
Engineering School, who cam
paigned for Congress as a super
dove, and Prof. John Gurley of
the Economics Department, who
was jailed for his activities dur
ing the recent debacle in Oak
land.
The essence of a free society
is that individuals be permitted,
even encouraged, to express
their views and to have the
legitimacy of those views tested
in open debate.
It is saddening that in a uni
versity which prides itself on an
an atmosphere of free thought
and expression, one finds a re
luctance on the part of pseudo-
Liberals to accept an opposing

position or to essay the validity
of a certain opinion by subject
ing it to truly open criticism.
Witness the self-righteous
proclamation of an anti-war
speaker at a White Plaza rally
last Spring who stated that,
"We don't want to debate, we
just want to stop the war," or
the remarkable Row-sponsored
forum on Vietnam which did
not include one supporter of the
current Administration's policy.
We are told as freshmen to
think critically about our values
and traditions but never about
those who teach us and tell us
to think critically.
Pulpit Into Soapbox
One rarely hears criticism of
such an eminent personage as
Dean Napier who, by transform
ing the pulpit into a soapbox
for the expression of his own
views and those of others who
agree with, him, has achieved a
synthesis of political and social
thought with religious doctrine
to produce Liberal opinions on
current issues which carry the
weight of sanctified orthodoxy.
On the other hand, one could
hardly escape hearing the bar
rage of protest which engulfed
Nobel Prize winner Prof. Wil
liam Shockley after an expres

sion of his dissenting views on
heredity last year.
What Is needed at Stanford
is a war of intellectual libera
tion which will create a climate
where people of diverse views
can freely exchange ideas and
opinions and anticipate that
they will not be shouted down,
heckled or forcibly prevented
from dotng so.
We will have attained such a
state when McGeorge Bundy
and Hubert Humphrey can be
extended the same basic cour
tesy as Martin Luther King and
Edward Keating.
The absence of such an atmo
sphere can be directly attributed
to an unconscious or, perhaps,
tacit alliance of Liberal profes
sors and teaching assistants
with the stormtroopers of the
New Left to promote restricted
channels of thought and study
which do not tolerate any ser
ious Consideration of Conserva
tive ideas.
In the song "My Back Pages,"
Bob Dylan makes reference to
". . . the mongrel dogs that
teach. ..." That same breed of
dog is barking here at Stanford
and its shrill cries may soon
drown out those voices calling
for a liberated mind and true
academic freedom.
Once again the Hydra-headed
monster of doctrinaire radical
ism has emerged from its insu
lated cavern of bias and preju
dice to display a form of in
tolerance Which, unfortunately,

Ludwig von Mises.
Strangely enough, the same
charges of political prejudice
which are leveled at the profes
sors and administrators at
Hoover are rarely directed to
wards the teaching assistants In
the departments of Freshman
English or Western Civilization.
It is that same type of out
look that has fostered attacks
on members of the Hoover for
their participation in political
activities but has had only
praise for the likes of such men
as Prof. George Leppert of the
Engineering School, who cam
paigned for Congress as a super
dove, and Prof. John Gurley of
the Economics Department, who
was jailed for his activities dur
ing the recent debacle in Oak
land.
The essence of a free society
is that individuals be permitted,
even encouraged, to express
their views and to have the
legitimacy of those views tested
in open debate.
It is saddening that in a uni
versity which prides itself on an
an atmosphere of free thought
and expression, one finds a re
luctance on the part of pseudo-
Liberals to accept an opposing

position or to essay the validity
of a certain opinion by subject
ing it to truly open criticism.
Witness the self-righteous
proclamation of an anti-war
speaker at a White Plaza rally
last Spring who stated that,
"We don't want to debate, we
just want to stop the war," or
the remarkable Row-sponsored
forum on Vietnam which did
not include one supporter of the
current Administration's policy.
We are told as freshmen to
think critically about our values
and traditions but never about
those who teach us and tell us
to think critically.
Pulpit Into Soapbox
One rarely hears criticism of
such an eminent personage as
Dean Napier who, by transform
ing the pulpit into a soapbox
for the expression of his own
views and those of others who
agree with, him, has achieved a
synthesis of political and social
thought with religious doctrine
to produce Liberal opinions on
current issues which carry the
weight of sanctified orthodoxy.
On the other hand, one could
hardly escape hearing the bar
rage of protest which engulfed
Nobel Prize winner Prof. Wil
liam Shockley after an expres

sion of his dissenting views on
heredity last year.
What Is needed at Stanford
is a war of intellectual libera
tion which will create a climate
where people of diverse views
can freely exchange ideas and
opinions and anticipate that
they will not be shouted down,
heckled or forcibly prevented
from dotng so.
We will have attained such a
state when McGeorge Bundy
and Hubert Humphrey can be
extended the same basic cour
tesy as Martin Luther King and
Edward Keating.
The absence of such an atmo
sphere can be directly attributed
to an unconscious or, perhaps,
tacit alliance of Liberal profes
sors and teaching assistants
with the stormtroopers of the
New Left to promote restricted
channels of thought and study
which do not tolerate any ser
ious Consideration of Conserva
tive ideas.
In the song "My Back Pages,"
Bob Dylan makes reference to
". . . the mongrel dogs that
teach. ..." That same breed of
dog is barking here at Stanford
and its shrill cries may soon
drown out those voices calling
for a liberated mind and true
academic freedom.
Once again the Hydra-headed
monster of doctrinaire radical
ism has emerged from its insu
lated cavern of bias and preju
dice to display a form of in
tolerance Which, unfortunately,
is no longer alien to the Stan
ford community.
The frenzy of attacks on the
CIA, the Hoover Institution,
Dow Chemical and the Oakland
police are this autumn's ex
amples of what a supposedly
liberal brand of education has
inspired, namely a pervasive at
titude of attempting to malic
iously destroy any individual or
group which does not conform
to those strictures of Liberal or
Radical doctrine delineated by
SDS, the Resistance or The
Dally editorial page.
At the core of this mentality
of intolerance is the employ
ment of a double standard of
analysis which deplores the lack
of Liberal researchers in
Hoover Tower but never pon
ders over the conspicuous ab
sence of Conservative scholars
in the Stanford Political Science
Department, never wonders why
so little attention is given to
Objectivism by the Philosophy
Department and never questions
the bias of an Economics De
partment which virtually ex

cludes the works of such Liber

Ludwig von Mises.

proclamation of an anti-war
speaker at a White Plaza rally
last Spring who stated that,
"We don't want to debate, we
just want to stop the war," or
the remarkable Row-sponsored
forum on Vietnam which did
not include one supporter of the
current Administration's policy.
We are told as freshmen to
think critically about our values

to think critically.
Pulpit Into Soapbox
One rarely hears criticism of
such an eminent personage as
Dean Napier who, by transform
ing the pulpit into a soapbox
for the expression of his own
views and those of others who
agree with, him, has achieved a
synthesis of political and social
thought with religious doctrine
to produce Liberal opinions on
current issues which carry the
weight of sanctified orthodoxy.
On the other hand, one could
hardly escape hearing the bar
rage of protest which engulfed
Nobel Prize winner Prof. Wil
liam Shockley after an expres

sion of his dissenting views on
heredity last year.
What Is needed at Stanford
is a war of intellectual libera
tion which will create a climate
where people of diverse views
can freely exchange ideas and
opinions and anticipate that
they will not be shouted down,
heckled or forcibly prevented
from dotng so.
We will have attained such a
state when McGeorge Bundy
and Hubert Humphrey can be
extended the same basic cour
tesy as Martin Luther King and
Edward Keating.
The absence of such an atmo
sphere can be directly attributed
to an unconscious or, perhaps,
tacit alliance of Liberal profes
sors and teaching assistants
with the stormtroopers of the
New Left to promote restricted
channels of thought and study
which do not tolerate any ser
ious Consideration of Conserva
tive ideas.
In the song "My Back Pages,"
Bob Dylan makes reference to
". . . the mongrel dogs that
teach. ..." That same breed of
dog is barking here at Stanford
and its shrill cries may soon
drown out those voices calling
for a liberated mind and true
academic freedom.
Once again the Hydra-headed
monster of doctrinaire radical
ism has emerged from its insu
lated cavern of bias and preju
dice to display a form of in
tolerance Which, unfortunately,
is no longer alien to the Stan
ford community.
The frenzy of attacks on the
CIA, the Hoover Institution,
Dow Chemical and the Oakland
police are this autumn's ex
amples of what a supposedly
liberal brand of education has
inspired, namely a pervasive at
titude of attempting to malic
iously destroy any individual or
group which does not conform
to those strictures of Liberal or
Radical doctrine delineated by
SDS, the Resistance or The
Dally editorial page.
At the core of this mentality
of intolerance is the employ
ment of a double standard of
analysis which deplores the lack
of Liberal researchers in
Hoover Tower but never pon
ders over the conspicuous ab
sence of Conservative scholars
in the Stanford Political Science
Department, never wonders why
so little attention is given to
Objectivism by the Philosophy
Department and never questions
the bias of an Economics De
partment which virtually ex

cludes the works of such Liber
tarians as Milton Friedman and
Ludwig von Mises.
Strangely enough, the same
charges of political prejudice
which are leveled at the profes
sors and administrators at
Hoover are rarely directed to
wards the teaching assistants In
the departments of Freshman
English or Western Civilization.
It is that same type of out
look that has fostered attacks
on members of the Hoover for
their participation in political
activities but has had only
praise for the likes of such men
as Prof. George Leppert of the
Engineering School, who cam
paigned for Congress as a super
dove, and Prof. John Gurley of
the Economics Department, who
was jailed for his activities dur
ing the recent debacle in Oak
land.
The essence of a free society
is that individuals be permitted,
even encouraged, to express
their views and to have the
legitimacy of those views tested
in open debate.
It is saddening that in a uni
versity which prides itself on an
an atmosphere of free thought
and expression, one finds a re
luctance on the part of pseudo-
Liberals to accept an opposing

position or to essay the validity
of a certain opinion by subject
ing it to truly open criticism.
Witness the self-righteous
proclamation of an anti-war
speaker at a White Plaza rally
last Spring who stated that,
"We don't want to debate, we
just want to stop the war," or
the remarkable Row-sponsored
forum on Vietnam which did
not include one supporter of the
current Administration's policy.
