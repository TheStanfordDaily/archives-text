## A
						Black Student On C15: Why Not? 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
As the person who placed
Joseph Goone in nomination for
the position of student repre
sentative on the Committee of
15, I feel there are certain
points I brought up in the
LASSU meeting which need be
repeated here.
Not the least among these
points, and in direct answer to
Robert Spanner's letter On Rep
resentation that LASSU "has
succumbed to rank racism," was
my emphasis upon equal rep
resentation. I was angered my
self that, of all the minorities
upon the Stanford campus, and
this includes the African stu
dents as well as those from oth
er continents, there was, from
the American black man's side,
not even one nominee for the
post.
That LASSU had not even
conceived of the notion was evi
dent from the surprise effect
imprinted on everyone's face in
that meeting as I pointed out
that there was not even one
"Uncle Tom" on the slate of
representatives. I pointed out
that radical, activist politics
were narrow and without any
real substance if they touched
not the racial imbalance and
estrangement on Stanford's cam
pus.
Not Bank Racism
What this rank racism might
have been is beyond me. The
BSU itself, at that meeting,
could place only three votes
towards Mr. Goone's election.
A quorum, it was stated, is 59
votes. Mr. Goone tallied the
highest number of votes, 54 in
all. Need I impress the point
further—that 51 members (not
counting us) out of a quorum
of 59 voted for Mr. Goone's nom
ination!
Moreover, to pick up the ar
gument that has developed over
Tim Haight's noting that "Ne
groes vis-a-vis the American
system tend to have greater
negotiating ability than their
white counterparts," I would
like to state that Mr. Haight
was not saying that we, as in
dividuals, are greater bargain
ers than the white man.
He was saying, however, that
in the long history of racial in
justices, a sort of hide, devel
oped by the American black
man to render some of the
blows this system is so capable
of administering without feel
ing as to possible future con
sequences and in direct disre
gard for humanity (or human
ity's rights)—l simply made
note of the fact that there can
be no drive towards correcting
the atmosphere of alienation in
this country that does not have,
as one of the engineers, a Negro
at the controls.
Let Us Speak
The Republican Party shows
as much political acumen by be
ing represented by Senator Ed
ward Brooke. The Democratic
Party can point to its own black
standard-bearers. So, too, can

the American Communist Party,
the activists of the New Left
and others.
But it seems to me as though
a greater tragedy has devel
oped, or been brought out in
the open, here at The Farm
While heads hang low, Stan
ford losing The Big Game, there
are other heads that pick up
quite readily to protest the se
lection of a Negro to Cl 5. These
are the same heads that scream
for a representative from the
fraternities, from the eating
clubs, from any group, in fact,
including the heated controver
sy surrounding ASSU Prexy
Lyman's slate which would
sooner or later be selected (four
out of five).
It seems to me that, when
ever the aegis of an organized
black group which actively
works within the system for
equal representation—the same
sort of representation workers
down South have died for—and
that when such a group, its
back against the wall everyone
in fear of a political coup d'etat
by Us, goes out in the public
eye to not merely point out such
imbalances in the system as
might be but also demand that
these situations be rectified,
and moreover, present their
own candidates, stating that
these, people too, will work dil
igently for the greater good of
The University—then it is we
who are called racists, it is we
who suffer the slurs, it is we
who reel from the abuse.

• Out Of Context
Editor, The Daily:
I was shocked and somewhat
angered to find my responses to
the Committee of Fifteen ques
tionnaire staring me in the face
from the pages of Monday's
Dally. Not to mention one of the
worst type-setting errors that
I have seen in four years of
Dally publication, I was shock
ed because I had never been con
tacted about the printing of the
responses, nor if I had been
contacted, would I have given
permission for the printing.
First, the answers were part
of ten pages of similar respon
ses which I had prepared for
LASSU in the space of one day.
I received the eighteen ques
tions on Wednesday morning and
submitted them to Jeff Kane via
the LASSU office early Thurs
day. I composed the answers at

the typewriter and made no at
tempt to rewrite or to clarify
clumsy syntax or confused ideas.
The responses were written to
be read aloud.
They were written as part of
a massive statement. And they
were certainly not written in
a form which I would have liked
to see preserved in print.
I was most upset by this situ
ation, since I have written for
the Daily before, and all my
articles have appeared as care
fully articulated statements over
which I labored at considerable
length.
My primary objection to the
Daily presentation is that the
responses were taken out of the
context of the general, bracket
ing, defining comments with
which I introduced and conclud
ed my statement to LASSU. I
consider the omission of the
closing statement especially to
have created a gross misrepre
sentation of my ideas.
I made a particular point that
the responses were in no way
definitive statements of my po
sitions on vital University mat
ters; and further that I retain,
and demand the right to retain,
an open mind, free to change,
on these issues. The Dally pres
entation gave the impression
that I was a creature of mono
lithic, simplistic, and dogmatic
ideas — both conditions which
are repugnant to me.

(Editor's Note: The answers
which Mr. Martin gave to the
Legislature were a matter of
public record. We gave no indi
cation that these answers were
definitive, or that Mr. Martin
could not change his mind on
any of the Issues. He will write
opinions for DAILY forums
later in this volume.)
• On Black On Black
Editor, the Daily:
Because there are still some
Stanford students who haven't
purchased their copies of Black
on Black we feel it is necessary
to correct certain erroneous and
misleading ideas contained in
the "review" entitled "Choices
For Black and White," (Daily,
November 16, 1967), an inter
esting title for a potential ar
ticle but hardly valid In this
case.
Mr. Barnett's arrogance was
only superseded by his ignor
ance. As a prime example, his
attempt to state in one phrase
what a 52-magazine that con
tains photographs, illustrations,
poetry, short stories, and essays
is "about" is simplistic, but un
fortunately, inaccurate. Stereo

types, capsule judgments, and
opinions based an personal be
liefs have no place in a literary
review. Articles on estrange
ment, hatred, the hopes for a
peaceful coexistence among
Blacks and whites, etc., are all
very Interesting, but using a nv
view of a campus publication
as an excuse to foist one off
on the Stanford campus is un
fair to the contributors, staff,
and readers of the magazine!
However, one of the main
faults in this review is the at
tempt to judge literary merit as
inversely proportional to the
amount of hatred "gushed" in
a piece of writing. Even in these
opinions, Mr. Barnett is unclear
—he seems to indicate that the
writings he characterized as
"contrived" or "purely narcis
sistic jumble" have "dynamic
power" but other pieces that of
fered different solutions (to
what problem, we wonder?)
more closely alligned with his
own ideas, had this same power,
but were better articles. Mr.
Barnett doesn't "mean to di
chotomize hate and constructive
belief," but it's a little late once
you've done and in print, at that.
Furthermore, approval of an
essay written by a black stu
dent based on the fact that he
echoes already-written white
ideas is insulting and, shall we
say, quaint.
In short, paternally condon
ing the politics in the preface,
one essay, and poems written by
already-publicized writers does
n't constitute a review. A care
ful reading of the magazine will
show it contains more articles
even if they're longer, and there
fore, harder to read and review
than a few poems. It is unfor
tunate, but perhaps only na
tural, that the reviewer could
only approach this article from
an I • am - a • white - person -
and • this - is - what - this •
black • magazine - means - to •
me - therefore angle. An objec
tive, or at least, unbiased review
of the whole magazine, or even
some pithy comments on a ran
dom sampling of the contents
would have been more in keep
ing with the standards of a
good newspaper at a great uni
versity.
