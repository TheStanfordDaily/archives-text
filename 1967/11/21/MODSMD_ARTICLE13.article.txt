# 'New Learning' Uses Programmed Texts

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Re
searchers have come up with a
new concept of learning which
federal officials are convinced
has the potential for revolution
izing the nation's educational
system in the years ahead.
It's called Individually Pres
cribed Instruction IPI, and it
means that each student works
mostly on his own with ma
terials specially suited for him.
Dr. Richard L. Bright, director
of research for the U.S. Office
of Education, calls it the great
est educational breakthrough of
recent times. The claims he
makes for IPI explain why fed
eral officials are so sold on it.
Here are some:
• Youngsters of all ability
levels would learn more. And
they would enjoy school far
more, thus reducing discipline
problems.
• There would be no need for
compensatory education for de
prived children, on which the
federal government now Is
spending $1 billion of its $4 bil
lion annual education budget.
• The dropout problem would
largely be licked.
• Teachers would cease being
mere dispensers of information
and would be free to tutor stu
dents individually and encour

age youngsters to think and to
express themselves.
• Parents could take children
out of school for vacations any
time during the year without
disrupting their learning process.
Although it sounds like some
thing for the distant future,
Bright predicts that IPI will be
ready for partial use through
out the country in two or three
years.
Within 25 years, says Secre
tary John W. Gardner of the
Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare, "virtually all
instruction in the shcools will be
individualized instruction."
The U.S. commissioner of ed
ucation, Harold Howe 11, says
research on IPI holds "the prom
ise that a truly individualized ed
ucation will soon be possible for
each child."
So far, the system has under
gone thorough trials in only one
school: Oakleaf Elementary in
the Baldwin-Whitehall suburb of
Pittsburgh, where is has been in
use three years. Five more
schools adopted the system last
year and 21 took it on this fall.
Now, about 1,000 systems around
the country are asking that the
system be set up in their schools.
"Our problem right now is to
turn people off on the idea,"

says Dr. James W. Becker, di
rector of the U.S. Office of Edu
cation's regional education lab
oratory in Philadelphia, which
helps the schools adopting IPI.
Becker explains that the sys
tem, developed mainly by Uni
versity of Pittsburgh research
ers with federal help, needs more
refinement before it is ready for
general use. But he said in a
telephone interview that labora
tory officials may help another
100 schools enter the program
next year.
The main limitation now is
the instructional materials, said
Becker, which are mainly in
booklet form.
IPI requires vast quantities of
materials for teachers to draw
upon to fulfill the various learn
ing needs of individual students.
Teachers find out what the stu
dents need through constant test
ing: placement tests, pre-tests,
tests imbedded in the materials,
and post-tests.
The materials, costly and dif
ficult to develop, use a techni
que called programming. This
involves presentation of a small
amount of information to the
student and then requiring him
to make a response. It's devised
so the students almost always
gives the right response — and
is told so immediately.


"STUDY BREAK!" — And an hour later slumbering sweetly. Nothing like the purported quiet and solitude of the UGLY for a good
nap. But then, it's been a hard week — (weekend?)!

the Baldwin-Whitehall suburb of
Pittsburgh, where is has been in
use three years. Five more
schools adopted the system last
year and 21 took it on this fall.
Now, about 1,000 systems around
the country are asking that the
system be set up in their schools.
"Our problem right now is to
turn people off on the idea,"

says Dr. James W. Becker, di
rector of the U.S. Office of Edu
cation's regional education lab
oratory in Philadelphia, which
helps the schools adopting IPI.
Becker explains that the sys
tem, developed mainly by Uni
versity of Pittsburgh research
ers with federal help, needs more
refinement before it is ready for
general use. But he said in a
telephone interview that labora
tory officials may help another
100 schools enter the program
next year.
The main limitation now is
the instructional materials, said
Becker, which are mainly in
booklet form.
IPI requires vast quantities of
materials for teachers to draw
upon to fulfill the various learn
ing needs of individual students.
Teachers find out what the stu
dents need through constant test
ing: placement tests, pre-tests,
tests imbedded in the materials,
and post-tests.
The materials, costly and dif
ficult to develop, use a techni
que called programming. This
involves presentation of a small
amount of information to the
student and then requiring him
to make a response. It's devised
so the students almost always
gives the right response — and
is told so immediately.


"STUDY BREAK!" — And an hour later slumbering sweetly. Nothing like the purported quiet and solitude of the UGLY for a good
nap. But then, it's been a hard week — (weekend?)!
WASHINGTON (AP) — Re
searchers have come up with a
new concept of learning which
federal officials are convinced
has the potential for revolution
izing the nation's educational
system in the years ahead.
It's called Individually Pres
cribed Instruction IPI, and it
means that each student works
mostly on his own with ma
terials specially suited for him.
Dr. Richard L. Bright, director
of research for the U.S. Office
of Education, calls it the great
est educational breakthrough of
recent times. The claims he
makes for IPI explain why fed
eral officials are so sold on it.
Here are some:
• Youngsters of all ability
levels would learn more. And
they would enjoy school far
more, thus reducing discipline
problems.
• There would be no need for
compensatory education for de
prived children, on which the
federal government now Is
spending $1 billion of its $4 bil
lion annual education budget.
• The dropout problem would
largely be licked.
• Teachers would cease being
mere dispensers of information
and would be free to tutor stu
dents individually and encour

age youngsters to think and to
express themselves.
• Parents could take children
out of school for vacations any
time during the year without
disrupting their learning process.
Although it sounds like some
thing for the distant future,
Bright predicts that IPI will be
ready for partial use through
out the country in two or three
years.
Within 25 years, says Secre
tary John W. Gardner of the
Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare, "virtually all
instruction in the shcools will be
individualized instruction."
The U.S. commissioner of ed
ucation, Harold Howe 11, says
research on IPI holds "the prom
ise that a truly individualized ed
ucation will soon be possible for
each child."
So far, the system has under
gone thorough trials in only one
school: Oakleaf Elementary in
the Baldwin-Whitehall suburb of
Pittsburgh, where is has been in
use three years. Five more
schools adopted the system last
year and 21 took it on this fall.
