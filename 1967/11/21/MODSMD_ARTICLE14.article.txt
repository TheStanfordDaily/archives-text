# Exchange
## Beirut—In English 
### JOHN ALCORN 
"A rare opportunity for Am
erican students to have a first
hand experience in the Middle
East" is how the Stanford-
American University of Beirut
exchange program is described
by its chairman, Michel Nabti
of the Hoover Institute.
The program, now in its fifth
year, annually awards a scholar
ship to a Stanford student
chosen to attend the American
University of Beirut (AUB) in
Lebanon. The scholarship cov
ers total cost of tuition, room,
board, and a monthly stipend.
Applications for the 1968-1969
school year are now available in

the International Center. They
should be completed and re
turned no late than next Mon
day, November 27.
The program also enable a
student from the American Uni
versity of Beirut to attend
Stanford free of charge for one
year. George Saliba, the AUB
student presently at Stanford,
had a great deal to say about
the American University of
Beirut.
Private Beach
"The location of the £UB
campus is situated very
uniquely in Beirut. The city also
has four other universities with
different orientations and rich
libraries," remarked Saliba. He
also mentioned that AUB has its
own private beach on the Medi
teranean coast, and that the
campus is located across the
street from the sea shore.
All AUB classes are taught
in English, which should be an
added incentive to any Stanford
student considering the pro
gram. Also, all credit earned
at AUB is transferable to Stan
ford.
Saliba explained the organiza
tion of AUB as a "semester sys
tem leaving students with a re
laxed feeling to pursue extra
curricular activities both on
campus and throughout Leban
on. He added that many AUB
students ski in the Lebanese
mountains, only a short drive
from Beirut.
About 3500 students attend
the university, representing 65
nations and a wide range of
religious and racial back

grounds. Saliba pointed out that
the size of the AUB student
body "allows close contact be
tween students and faculty" and
said that it is not at all unusual
to see students sitting with pro
fessors in the open-air Leban
ese cafes.
The Stanford-American Uni
versity of Beirut exchange pro
gram is part of several ex
change programs sponsored by
the Institute of International
Relations. It is the only direct
contact between Stanford and
the Middle East.
The American University of
Beirut is a private institution
chartered by the State of New
York.
