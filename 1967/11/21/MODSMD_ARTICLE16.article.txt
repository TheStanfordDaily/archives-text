BERKELEY (AP) â€” Twenty
two professors at the University
of California admitted taking
part in unauthorized campus
rallies at Berkeley and asked
that they not be exempt from
punishment.
They opposed recommenda
tions by the dean of students
that 11 students be suspended
for their participation in unau
thorized antidraft rallies last
month.
Officials in Chancellor Roger
W. Heyn's office declined com
ment on the statement.
The professors said: "We

share the widely held view that
these severe punishments rec
ommended by the dean are un
justified.
"We further maintain that if
punishments are to be carried
out, we, as well as the cited
students, must stand in jeopar
dy. Our action and theirs can
not in any just sense be separ
ated in principle."
The dean's office also has rec
ommended that Heyns put sev
en students on disciplinary pro
bation. Three other students
were censored, 35 warned and
the cases of 15 were dismissed.
