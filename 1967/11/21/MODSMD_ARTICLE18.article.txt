# Russia Outplays Stanford In Computer Chess Match
## 
### 
Stanford computer experts
have lost a chess match, played
entirely by computer, to a team
of Russians at the Institute of
Physics in Moscow.
The Russians took two of the
four games played in the series,
which began in November 1966.
The other two games ended in
draws, after 37 and 39 moves.
Stanford played its end of the
contests on an IBM 7090 com
puter, while the Muscovites used
their M2O, a machine compar
able in speed and power to the
IBM 704, a much earlier IBM
model.
Prof. John McCarthy, head of
the computer science depart
ment, explained the reasons for
Stanford's defeat.
"The Russians have two var
iants of their program," he

stated, one of which is more
powerful. This was the one used
in the two Russian victories.
This second program is better,
he noted, because it investigates
more possible moves. McCarthy
also said that the Russians have
a "more sophisticated method of
choosing moves."
Their system consists of look
ing for aggressive moves. Stan
ford's program, on the other
hand, sets up a scoring system
for moves, looks at all those
possible, and then investigates
further only those with the top
four scores.
McCarthy, along with Alan
Kotok, Charles Niessen, and
Michael Lieberman, wrote the
program used by Stanford in
1962, at MIT.
At present, there are other
programs in the U.S. which take
the same approach to selecting
moves as the Russians' does.
McCarthy considers this method
superior.
