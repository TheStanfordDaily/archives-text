# Teaching Evaluation Weighed By Engineers
## 
### ROBERT BRODY 
Criteria for faculty evaluation
and the role of the engineer in
today's society dominated the
discussion at last night's meet
ing of engineering students and
members of the Steering Com
mittee of the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES).
The audience of over 100,
mostly students, addressed their
remarks to a panel consisting of
Herbert Packer, chairman of
the Steering Committee, Elec
trical Engineering Professor
James Gibbons, Associate Dean
of Undergraduate Education and
SES Staff Director Robert Hind,
and undergraduate Norton
Batkin.
The audience compared favor
ably to a recent community
wide SES "town meeting" in
both student attendance and
participation.
Teaching Critique Forthcoming
An electrical engineering stu
dent noted that no evaluation
of teaching had been made in
the paper. Packer replied,
"You're quite right. This posi
tion paper was designed primar
ily to deal with the problem of
curricular structure.
"A study of this will not get
you far without constant atten
tion being paid to what goes on
in the classroom." He noted that
the study of instructional prac
tices was on the SES agenda
for this winter and promised
that a position paper on this
subject would be published.
The student continued that
many are not satisfied with the
kind of education they are get
ting in engineering. "We lack
the motivation necessary for
such a rigorous program," he
said, "There is the problem of
finding a good teacher as well
as a good scholar."
Gibbons responded, "I think
you're absolutely right in ques
tioning if teachers are motivat
ing."
Classroom Performance Counts
Another student commented,
"I've heard from a professor
that the number of papers
you've written are counted, and
then if you're not incompetent
in class, you're promoted."
Dr. Arthur Bienenstock, who
formerly taught at Harvard re

plied, "It was made clear to me
at Stanford that the quality of
my teaching would be studied
as well as the quality of my re
search. This was not emphasized
at Harvard."
Ethical Considerations
Another student then pro
posed, "Why don't we have pro
fessors teaching about their
own research, thus bringing
their special interests and tal
ents into the classroom?"

Packer remarked, "While
there is the problem of the stu
dent-teacher ratio, I'm complete
ly with you in concept."
In discussing the purpose of
an education, Batkin pointed
out that all engineers will have
to face certain questions of pub
lic policy and social values.
Several students replied that
there was currently no such op
portunity for evaluation in their
courses.
