# Censorship Ban Lifted; SF State Paper Booms
## 
### 
The ban has been lifted on
San Francisco State's news
paper The Open Process and the
result has been a tremendous
increase in circulation.
Kevin Greenwood, Process ad
vertising manager, said, "We put
6000 issues out every Friday at
eight and within three hours
they are all gone."
The Process plans to increase
their circulation by an addi
tional thousand issues soon.
Superintendent of Schools Max
Rafferty, acting through SF
State President John Summer
skill, suspended publication of
the weekly newspaper last May
for "indiscriminate" printing of
a nude figure and "unnecessary"
four-letter words.
No censorship has been offi
cially imposed by the college's
Board of Publications. However,
the policy, according to Green
wood, is: "If we want to talk
about sex, we can, as long as it's
put in its proper perspective and
isn't an arbitrary thing."

The format of The Open Proc
ess has changed slightly. Ac
cording to one spokesman for
the paper, "It speaks with a
purpose; it isn't just a series of
radical flashes." Reviews of
plays and movies, as well as
contemporary political issues
have also been included.
The Board of Publications at
the college has also had a hand
in selecting the paper's editor,
Blair Partridge. He was chosen
from a group of three student
staffers and one journalism ma
jor. "But the Board knew that if
they didn't select one of our
staffers, the rest of us would
quit," Greenwood said.
Although the ban was offi
cially lifted on or about October
13, the first edition was not re
leased until October 27. This was
due primarily to the fact that
the Boar had not made available
The Process's $12,425 budget,
which had been approved earlier
in the month.
