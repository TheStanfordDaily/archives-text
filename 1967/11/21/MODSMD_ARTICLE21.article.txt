# Proposal Forwarded To LBJ Asks Draft Reclassifications
## 
### 
Selective Service Director Lew
is B. Hershey is recommending
that President Johnson issue an
executive order making it stan
dard procedure for disruptive an
tiwar protestors to lose their
draft deferments.
Although the proposed execu
tive order has not been made
public, its intent reportedly is
to "tighten up" sections of the
draft law which outline when
a Selective Service registrant
should be declared "delinquent."
Delinquents are reclassified and
placed first in the order of call.
The proposal follows a letter
which Hershey sent to local draft
boards in late October recom
mending that those who block en
trances to army induction cen
ters or obstruct military recruit
ment on campuses be drafted
first. If the executive order is
signed by the President, this
plan, which now is only a sug
gestion by Hershey to local
boards, will be clearly spelled
out as standard procedure.
An official at Selective Service
headquarters said the Hershey
proposal has been turned over
to the Bureau of the Budget —
where all proposed executive
orders are initially sent — and
is now in the processing stages.
The proposal is now being re
viewed by the Department of
Justice prior to being sent to the
White House, he said.
End Consideration
The Justice Department could
quickly end consideration of the
proposal by declaring it uncon
stitutional. Since Hershey's let
ter to draft boards has been
made public, there have been
numerous charges that reclassi
fying protestors is a violation
of the First Amendment to the
Constitution.
A Selective Service spokesman
said, "This office has received
no formal notice from the At
torney General that this docu
ment (the letter) is unconstitu
tional. Unless we receive such
a notice from the Justice De
partment, we will have no furth
er comment."
Hershey said his letter to lo
cal boards contains no new poli
cies, but is rather a recommen

dation that the present draft
law be strictly enforced. The
relevant section of the Selective
Service Act says those who
"knowingly hinder or interfere
or attempt to do so in any way
by force or violence or other
wise" with the Selective Service
System should be declared delin
quents and face penalties or re
classification. The proposed ex
ecutive order presumably would
explain this section of the law in
more specific terms and order
local draft boards to declare
registrants delinquent accord
ingly.
Act In National Interest
Hershey emphasizes that the
existing draft law says defer
ments should be given only to
individuals who are acting in
the national interest. He says
those who interfere with mili
tary recruitement are not act
ing in the national interest.
The Selective Service direc
tors' views have been sharply
criticized by scores of college
newspapers, clergymen, several
Congressmen, and numerous or
ganizations, including the Amer
ican Association of University
Professors and the American
Civil Liberties Union. The Wash
ington Post suggested in a re
cent editorial that Hershey
should retire.
The fate of Hershey's pro
posed executive order may well
be determined by what the Jus
tice Department decides. The
Department ruled on a similar
question in January, 1966.
Vinson Speaks
At that time, Assistant Attor
ney General Fred M. Vinson,
Jr. said that "as a matter of
both law and policy, sanctions
of the Universal Military Train
ing and Service Act cannot be
used in any way to stifle con
stitutionally protected expres
sion of views." He said reclassi

fication by the Selective Service
System could not be used against
demonstrators "where the con
duct involved is the expression
of an opinion, even if the meth
od of expression transgresses
the law. If there is no transgres
sion, then no sanction can be in
voked. If there is a transgres
sion, then the sanctions which
attach to it are all that should
be applied."
Vinson's opinion was handed
down after several draft boards
attempted to reclassify Univer
sity of Michigan students who
staged a sit-in at the Ann Arbor
draft office. The action by the
draft boards was also ruled ille
gal by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit. The judg
es held in a unanimous opinion
that "it is not the function of
local boards in the Selective Ser
vice System to punish regi
strants by reclassifying them
1-A because they protested as
they did over the Government's
involvement in Vietnam."
The Court also held that "it
is the free expression of views
on issues of critical current na
tional importance that is jeop
ardized. On such topics perhaps
more than any other, it is im
perative that the public debate
be full and that each segment
of our society be permitted free
ly to express its views. Thus the
allegations of the complaint in
this case that the draft boards
have unlawfully suppressed cri
ticism must take precedence
over a policy of nonintervention
in the affairs of the Selective
Service."

Since Hershey's letter to draft
boards was sent out, at least
two students have said they
were reclassified 1-A as a result
of their involvement in protests

The proposal follows a letter
which Hershey sent to local draft
boards in late October recom
mending that those who block en
trances to army induction cen
ters or obstruct military recruit
ment on campuses be drafted
first. If the executive order is
signed by the President, this
plan, which now is only a sug
gestion by Hershey to local
boards, will be clearly spelled
out as standard procedure.
An official at Selective Service
headquarters said the Hershey
proposal has been turned over
to the Bureau of the Budget —
where all proposed executive
orders are initially sent — and
is now in the processing stages.
The proposal is now being re
viewed by the Department of
Justice prior to being sent to the
White House, he said.
End Consideration
The Justice Department could
quickly end consideration of the
proposal by declaring it uncon
stitutional. Since Hershey's let
ter to draft boards has been
made public, there have been
numerous charges that reclassi
fying protestors is a violation
of the First Amendment to the
Constitution.
A Selective Service spokesman
said, "This office has received
no formal notice from the At
torney General that this docu
ment (the letter) is unconstitu
tional. Unless we receive such
a notice from the Justice De
partment, we will have no furth
er comment."
Hershey said his letter to lo
cal boards contains no new poli
cies, but is rather a recommen

dation that the present draft
law be strictly enforced. The
relevant section of the Selective
Service Act says those who
"knowingly hinder or interfere
or attempt to do so in any way
by force or violence or other
wise" with the Selective Service
System should be declared delin
quents and face penalties or re
classification. The proposed ex
ecutive order presumably would
explain this section of the law in
more specific terms and order
local draft boards to declare
registrants delinquent accord
ingly.
Act In National Interest
Hershey emphasizes that the
existing draft law says defer
ments should be given only to
individuals who are acting in
the national interest. He says
those who interfere with mili
tary recruitement are not act
ing in the national interest.
The Selective Service direc
tors' views have been sharply
criticized by scores of college
newspapers, clergymen, several
Congressmen, and numerous or
ganizations, including the Amer
ican Association of University
Professors and the American
Civil Liberties Union. The Wash
ington Post suggested in a re
cent editorial that Hershey
should retire.
The fate of Hershey's pro
posed executive order may well
be determined by what the Jus
tice Department decides. The
Department ruled on a similar
question in January, 1966.
Vinson Speaks
At that time, Assistant Attor
ney General Fred M. Vinson,
Jr. said that "as a matter of
both law and policy, sanctions
of the Universal Military Train
ing and Service Act cannot be
used in any way to stifle con
stitutionally protected expres
sion of views." He said reclassi

fication by the Selective Service
System could not be used against
demonstrators "where the con
duct involved is the expression
of an opinion, even if the meth
od of expression transgresses
the law. If there is no transgres
sion, then no sanction can be in
voked. If there is a transgres
sion, then the sanctions which
attach to it are all that should
be applied."
Vinson's opinion was handed
down after several draft boards
attempted to reclassify Univer
sity of Michigan students who
staged a sit-in at the Ann Arbor
draft office. The action by the
draft boards was also ruled ille
gal by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit. The judg
es held in a unanimous opinion
that "it is not the function of
local boards in the Selective Ser
vice System to punish regi
strants by reclassifying them
1-A because they protested as
they did over the Government's
involvement in Vietnam."
The Court also held that "it
is the free expression of views
on issues of critical current na
tional importance that is jeop
ardized. On such topics perhaps
more than any other, it is im
perative that the public debate
be full and that each segment
of our society be permitted free
ly to express its views. Thus the
allegations of the complaint in
this case that the draft boards
have unlawfully suppressed cri
ticism must take precedence
over a policy of nonintervention
in the affairs of the Selective
Service."
Letter Sent
Since Hershey's letter to draft
boards was sent out, at least
two students have said they
were reclassified 1-A as a result
of their involvement in protests
against the war and the draft.
Selective Service Director Lew
is B. Hershey is recommending
that President Johnson issue an
executive order making it stan
dard procedure for disruptive an
tiwar protestors to lose their
draft deferments.
Although the proposed execu
tive order has not been made
public, its intent reportedly is
to "tighten up" sections of the
draft law which outline when
a Selective Service registrant
should be declared "delinquent."

where all proposed executive
orders are initially sent — and
is now in the processing stages.
The proposal is now being re
viewed by the Department of
Justice prior to being sent to the
White House, he said.
End Consideration
The Justice Department could
quickly end consideration of the
proposal by declaring it uncon
stitutional. Since Hershey's let
ter to draft boards has been
made public, there have been
numerous charges that reclassi
fying protestors is a violation
of the First Amendment to the
Constitution.
A Selective Service spokesman
said, "This office has received
no formal notice from the At
torney General that this docu
ment (the letter) is unconstitu
tional. Unless we receive such
a notice from the Justice De
partment, we will have no furth
er comment."
Hershey said his letter to lo
cal boards contains no new poli
cies, but is rather a recommen

dation that the present draft
law be strictly enforced. The
relevant section of the Selective
Service Act says those who
"knowingly hinder or interfere
or attempt to do so in any way
by force or violence or other
wise" with the Selective Service
System should be declared delin
quents and face penalties or re
classification. The proposed ex
ecutive order presumably would
explain this section of the law in
more specific terms and order
local draft boards to declare
registrants delinquent accord
ingly.
Act In National Interest
Hershey emphasizes that the
existing draft law says defer
ments should be given only to
individuals who are acting in
the national interest. He says
those who interfere with mili
tary recruitement are not act
ing in the national interest.
The Selective Service direc
tors' views have been sharply
criticized by scores of college
newspapers, clergymen, several
Congressmen, and numerous or
ganizations, including the Amer
ican Association of University
Professors and the American
Civil Liberties Union. The Wash
ington Post suggested in a re
cent editorial that Hershey
should retire.
The fate of Hershey's pro
posed executive order may well
be determined by what the Jus
tice Department decides. The
Department ruled on a similar
question in January, 1966.
Vinson Speaks
At that time, Assistant Attor
ney General Fred M. Vinson,
Jr. said that "as a matter of
both law and policy, sanctions
of the Universal Military Train
ing and Service Act cannot be
used in any way to stifle con
stitutionally protected expres
sion of views." He said reclassi

fication by the Selective Service
System could not be used against
demonstrators "where the con
duct involved is the expression
of an opinion, even if the meth
od of expression transgresses
the law. If there is no transgres
sion, then no sanction can be in
voked. If there is a transgres
sion, then the sanctions which
attach to it are all that should
be applied."
Vinson's opinion was handed
down after several draft boards
attempted to reclassify Univer
sity of Michigan students who
staged a sit-in at the Ann Arbor
draft office. The action by the
draft boards was also ruled ille
gal by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit. The judg
es held in a unanimous opinion
that "it is not the function of
local boards in the Selective Ser
vice System to punish regi
strants by reclassifying them
1-A because they protested as
they did over the Government's
involvement in Vietnam."
The Court also held that "it
is the free expression of views
on issues of critical current na
tional importance that is jeop
ardized. On such topics perhaps
more than any other, it is im
perative that the public debate
be full and that each segment
of our society be permitted free
ly to express its views. Thus the
allegations of the complaint in
this case that the draft boards
have unlawfully suppressed cri
ticism must take precedence
over a policy of nonintervention
in the affairs of the Selective
Service."
Letter Sent
Since Hershey's letter to draft
boards was sent out, at least
two students have said they
were reclassified 1-A as a result
of their involvement in protests
against the war and the draft.
Selective Service Director Lew
is B. Hershey is recommending
that President Johnson issue an
executive order making it stan
dard procedure for disruptive an
tiwar protestors to lose their
draft deferments.
Although the proposed execu
tive order has not been made
public, its intent reportedly is
to "tighten up" sections of the
draft law which outline when
a Selective Service registrant
should be declared "delinquent."
Delinquents are reclassified and
placed first in the order of call.
The proposal follows a letter
which Hershey sent to local draft
boards in late October recom
mending that those who block en
trances to army induction cen
ters or obstruct military recruit
ment on campuses be drafted
first. If the executive order is
signed by the President, this
plan, which now is only a sug
gestion by Hershey to local
boards, will be clearly spelled
out as standard procedure.
