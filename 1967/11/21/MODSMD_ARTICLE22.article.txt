# Stanford Archaeologists Rescue Roman Relics
## 
### 
A Stanford-Yugoslav archaeo
logical team helped save price
less relics dating back to the
early Roman occupation of
Yugoslavia this past summer.
The Stanford contingent, head
ed by Prof. Wayne Vucinich of
the History Department, con
ducted a series of "digs" in the
Trebisnjica valley 35 miles north
of and inland from the coastal
port of Dubrovnik.
The valley will soon be inun
dated with water from a new
dam, part of the Yugoslavian
government's hydro-electric proj
ect.
The Yugoslav-Stanford team
excavated six Illyrian burial
mounds, relics of a people which
were indigenous and pre-dated
the Romans.
All but one were single graves
which contained well-preserved
skeletons resting on their right
sides with hands and feet drawn
up. Other than broken ceramics,
no artifacts were found.
Vucinich with a Yugoslavian
colleague directed the work of
collecting, recording, photo
graphing and sketching ethno
graphic materials.

Prof. Mario Del Chiarro of the
University of California at San
ta Barbara led a team which ex
cavated a Roman villa dating
back to the Fourth Century A.D.
Excavators found intact the an
cient heating system similar to
the radiant heating used today,
along with frescoes and mosaics.
Another group led by Prof.
Marian Wengel of UC-Santa
Barbara studied Bogumil tomb
stones, some weighing as much
as nine tons, hoping to shed
some light on the ethnic history
of this strange tribe. The Yugo
slavian government has donated
one of the tombstones to the
University and one to the Smith
sonian Institution.
Artifacts found in the graves
included coins, gold and silver
thread from the clothes in which
the dead were buried, and a deli
cately shaped glass bottle.
Most of this and other mate
rial was removed to Yugoslavian
museums for further study.
More than 100 persons partici
pated in the two-month "dig"
which took place in August and
September.

graphing and sketching ethno
graphic materials.

Prof. Mario Del Chiarro of the
University of California at San
ta Barbara led a team which ex
cavated a Roman villa dating
back to the Fourth Century A.D.
Excavators found intact the an
cient heating system similar to
the radiant heating used today,
along with frescoes and mosaics.
Another group led by Prof.
Marian Wengel of UC-Santa
Barbara studied Bogumil tomb
stones, some weighing as much
as nine tons, hoping to shed
some light on the ethnic history
of this strange tribe. The Yugo
slavian government has donated
one of the tombstones to the
University and one to the Smith
sonian Institution.
Artifacts found in the graves
included coins, gold and silver
thread from the clothes in which
the dead were buried, and a deli
cately shaped glass bottle.
Most of this and other mate
rial was removed to Yugoslavian
museums for further study.
More than 100 persons partici
pated in the two-month "dig"
which took place in August and
September.
