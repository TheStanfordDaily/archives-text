# Media--A Cause Of Racial Turmoil?
## 
### 
Investigators have "tiptoed
around" the role of the media
in race riots rather than investi
gate it thoroughly, writes Wil
liam L. Rivers, associate profes
sor of communication, in the
fall issue of Stanford Today,
the University's quarterly mag
azine.
In an article titled "Jim Crow
Journalism," Prof. Rivers says:
"If investigators of our race
riots had chosen to analyze the
role of the media rather than
tiptoe around it, they would
have traced one of the deepest
roots of racial turmoil.
"And they could have done it
just as easily in Los Angeles
and Detroit as in New Orleans
and Jackson, Mississippi," he
writes.
As a case in point, he notes
that the massive 101-page Mc-
Cone Report on the Watts riots
suggests in "three short, care
fully worded paragraphs" that
journalists might meet and es
tablish voluntary guidelines for
riot coverage.
Prof. Rivers, a Southerner by
birth and education, charges
that though "civil rights" has
long been front-page news,

"Negroes themselves have not
arrived."
"Only the superstars in ath
letics, entertainment and civil
rights—like Willie Mays, Sam
my Davis, and Martin Luther
King Jr.—really matter. The
everyday world of the Negro
and the continuing substance of
Negro life in the U.S. seem to
matter not at all."
Prof. Rivers emphasized: "We
might not now be experiencing
such a cataclysmic period had
the news media alerted us to
the pitiful conditions of Negro
life decades ago.
"At the very least journalistic
explorations of ghetto existence
would have enable us to under
stand the violence that accomp
anies the modern demand for
civil rights. Such reportage
might have helped make the
Negro American an integral
part of his society rather than
an unhappy graft upon it."
But, he writes, it is mislead
ing to assume that the news
media are not deeply concerned
about their treatment of racial
minorities. There have been
significant changes.

'Today, few Southern broad
casters and publishers are
guilty of more than an uncon
scious bias that will not allow
them to see that they view facts
from a distorted perspective—a
malady not limited by geo
graphy," he writes.
"Most Southern broadcasters
and publishers must stand up
to pressures from local com
munities whose perspectives are
far more distorted. Southern
media disseminate impartial
news of the civil rights move
ment from United Press Inter
national, the Associated Press,
and the national networks on a
scale that many Southerners
consider scandalous.
"There has been progress in
reporting civil disorder. Shaken
by charges that their reporting
of riots often has had the effect
of pouring gasoline on a fire,
journalists have been apprais
ing their own practices.
"New guidelines were devel
oped in Chicago in the 1950's
and spead swiftly to other cities.
After the Watts riots, two fac
ulty members of the University

of Southern California con
ferred with reporters, then drew
up more extensive guidelines in
tended to curb sensationalism,
limit interference with the work
of authorities, and avoid undue
notice to obvious inciters."
He made another recom
mendation: violence must be re
ported in its full context.
The voices of riot as well as
pacification must be reported,
Prof, Rivers said; the media
must make clear that episodes
of violence differ fom total vio
lence—"they must focus on why

there is unrest, and well before
rioflng breaks out."
Prof. Rivers cited an instance
of the wrong approach—sup
pression of civil rights news as
practiced by the Dallas Times-
Herald and the Dallas Morning
News in 1960 which began dur
ing a visit by Roy Wilkins of
the NAACP.
By joint aggreement of a citi
zens committee which included
executives of both papers, news
of civil disorders was sup
pressed.
Of this and other bi-racial

committee Joining to suppress
news of civil disorders, Prof.
Rivers says:"It is dismaying
to contemplate jounalists, who
should be attempting to break
through the walls of secrecy,
helping to build them — especi
ally in the company of civil
leaders who are eager to pro
mote business relationships that
lead to country-club journalism.
"Journalists who march be
side the First People of a com
munity can neither see nor re
port the broad sweep of com
munity life."
