# Group Set For Concord
## 
### 
A team of Stanford students
preparing a new plan for Con
cord will meet with city officials,
Chamber of Commece members,
and interested resident Tuesday
at 8 p.m. Nov. 21, in the Concord
City Council chambers.
It will be the first formal pre
sentation by the students par
ticipating in the current "Con
cord 70" project. Another pre
sentation will be made in March
and a final pesentation in June.
The Stanford team is made up
of 20 students in architecture,
law, engineering, business, com
munications, geology and his
tory. The plan will emphasize
the downtown area and will pay
particular attention to the po
tential of BART, the lakes, the
plaza area, the civic center and
the Sun Valley and Park and
Shop centers.
The students in charge of
Tuesday's presentation are Rob
ert Basile, Sam Sperry, Robert
Cox, Ted Vian, and Joe Ritchey.
Tuesday's meeting will be a
program presentation, stressing
what students intend to do more
than what they have done, and
procedures more than propos
als. Members of the audience
will be asked to respond to a
questionnaire probing their atti
tudes toward planning in Con
cord.
During October, the students
spent a weekend in Concord
staying at the Concord Inn and
collecting information and im
pressions of Concord. They were
guests of Bart Lytton, board
chairman of Lytton Savings and
Loan Association and a guest
professor for the course. They
also met with members of a
Chamber of Commerce commit
tee serving as liason between
the students and Concord.
Between presentations, the
students will post progress re
ports of the project on a con
temporary kiosk which they
have erected in the plaza near
Willow Pass Rd.
