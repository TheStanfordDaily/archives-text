# Soto Loft
## Fate Still Undecided 
### HANK LIESE 
Despite an hour-long meeting
last night between Soto House
residents and William Friedrich,
Business Manager of University
residences, the fate of Soto's
loft is still up in the air.
The loft, erected last month
by Soto's decoration committee,
consists of a large wooden plat
form supported by several beams
braced against a wall in the Soto
lounge.
It stands seven feet off the
floor, and a hand-welded stair
case leads up to the platform,
which holds a couch and a lamp.
Questions Legality
When Friedrich saw the loit,
he immediately questioned its
legality. An investigation show
ed that the platform violates
county fire and building laws in
two ways.
There is not enough clear
ance or headroom above the
loft. And it is not a three-hour
construction (it would not burn
for three hours), as the fire
code requires.
"The wood is highly combus
tible," Friedrich told his au
dience last night in the Soto
lounge. "This is dangerous in
a lounge which is ennsidered
as a meeting room."
But We Love It
A "We Love Our Loft" poster
placed on the platform's stair
case greeted Friedrich as he
gave Soto residents two alterna
tives.
They can either present modi
fication proposals for the loft
to the University's building com
mission, a course which Fried
rich feels will not be too success
ful. Or they can be reimbursed
by the University for the money
which has gone into the struc
ture.
The alternatives were imme

diately attacked. "They seem,"
remarked one resident, "to be
choices to lose the loft one way,
o** lose it the other way."
Want To Save Loft
Friedrich's reply, "It appears
you don't want to lose the loft,"
brought a big hand from Soto
residents.
"We are willing to make the
loft as safe as possible," stated
another resident. "The trouble
with the fire laws is that they
are too strict. To most of us, this
doesn't seem like a violation.
We're not going to die in our
beds because of this thing."
Work Of Art
A number of Soto residents
want to redefine the loft as a
work of art and thus somehow
work around the fire restrictions.
"We put up the loft," said one
resident seriously, "as an aesthe
tic improvement. We feel we
have been given a mandate by
the University, since the theme
of our house is creativity, to
form a creative environment."
In an effort to help classify
the loft as a work of art, Wilbur

Director Joe Higgins suggested
the house, in consultation with
the art department, submit defi
nitions of the loft to the build
ing commission.
Amidst all the bickering, one
Soto member, living up to his
house's theme, put forth several
practical suggestions.
"We could coat the loft with
a chemical paint which would
resist fire for 40 minutes," he
said.
He also suggested equipping
the lounge with several fire ex
tinguishers or even placing an
asbestos framework in the Im
mediate area of the loft.
Friedrich, after seeing the res
ident's great devotion to their
loft, pledged his support in ob
taining its approval. He feels
the best course would be to sub
mit such proposals to the build
ing commission, while defining
the loft as a work of art at the
same time.
But whatever happens and
however long it will take, the
House of Creativity continues
to enjoy its controversial roost.
