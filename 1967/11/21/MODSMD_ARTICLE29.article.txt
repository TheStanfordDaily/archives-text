# Music Program Offered Today
## 
### 
The second in the Music De
partment's new "Music Then
and Now" series will be pre
sented tonight at 8 p.m. in Dink
elspiel Auditorium.
The program will feature mod
ern works by Stravinsky, Var
ese, and Allan Johnson. In con
trast a group of singers, dancers,
and instrumentalists will re
create an early 17th century En
glish masque complete with cos
tumes and staging.
The work by Allan Johnson in
volves three conductors, their
beat regulated to a clock mech
anism in the middle of the stage.

Johnson is a doctoral candidate
at Stanford in music composi
tion.
"Septet," for clarinet, horn,
bassoon, violin, viola, cello and
piano, represents an important
turning point in Stravinsky's mu
sic. For the first time, Stravin
sky began working with the
idea of music being organized in
terms of the tone row method
usually associated with Schon
berg.
The Varese work will be per
formed by nine winds and six
teen percussionists, and will also
utilize such unconventional mu-

sic "instruments" as rattles,
blocks and an authentic fire
siren, borrowed for the occasion
from the Stanford Fire Depart
ment.
The masque will be performed
by the 33 students in Prof. Geo
rge Houle's performance prac
tice class in early music and is
based on extensive research into
dances, music and costumes of
the era. Costumed dancers and
singers will be accompanied by
an ensemble of authentic early
instruments — viols, recorders,
lutes, sackbuts, shawns, as well
as violins, harpsichord, organ
and percussion.


REHEARSAL — Performers In "Music Then And Now" prepare for tonight's performance at 8
p.m. in Dinkelsplel Auditorium.
