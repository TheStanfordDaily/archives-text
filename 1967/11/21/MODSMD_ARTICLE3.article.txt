# Still Nameless, Leaderless:
## Activists Adopt Franklin Plan 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The newly-formed coordinat
ing committee for Stanford
leftists met for the second time
last night, and left still name
less and leaderless.
The main result that the meet
ing, held in Cubberley Auditor
ium, produced was an organiza
tional structure for the group.
After heated debate on wheth
er control of the organization
should be in the hands of exist
ing radical groups or unaffiliated
leftists, a proposal submitted by
Bruce Franklin, associate profes
sor of English, was approved by
the 200 people present.
In Franklin's plan, the steer
ing committee consists of one
representative from each cam
pus residence, as well as one for
each existing radical group at
Stanford.
Executive Committee
This group will choose a five
member executive committee,
which will act only on urgent
matters, and will be empowered
to act only on noncontroversial
issues.
Franklin's plan was approved
over another, according to which
the executive group would con
sist only of representatives from
activist organizations.
The group decided, however,
that, as John Shippee stated, "In
order for it [the organization]
to be an effective means of com-

munication it must include all
those involved in peace and free
dom," and not let militants gain
complete control.
Franklin himself predicted,
"If the steering committee is
heavily weighted towards the
campus constituency, it can be a
good decision-making body."
But, he continued, if militants
were in charge, there would be
"endless divisive debate," and
the group would "become merely
a mailing list or a telephone
tree."
Selection Of Chairman
Another plan approved last
night was for the selection of a
chairman at the next general
meeting, yet to be scheduled. It
was also decided that general
meetings could be called by
either the chairman or one third
of the steering committee.
Both of these ideas were also
put forth by Franklin.
Other proposals passed includ
ed having the steering commit
tee choose a name for the organ
ization at its first meeting, and
allowing any member of the
group to attend a steering com
mittee meeting, while leaving
voting powers with committee
members alone.
Much of the debate on the
various issues was devoted to
proclaiming and allaying fear
of what would become of the
group if either militants or un
affiliated leftists took charge.

Jeff Browning, chairman of the
meeting, tried to hold a middle
ground, stating, "This could be
the beginning of student power,
because without people commu
nicating you can't have any
thing."

Since the exact membership of
the steering committee has not
yet been determined, dissemina
tion of information to people
who are not affiliated with any
organized activist group will be
handled by David Mastfanwrea.
