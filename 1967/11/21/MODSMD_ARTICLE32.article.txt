# 'Per/Se' Gains Recognition
## 
### VICTOR OWEN 
Per/Se, an international liter
ary magazine published at Stan
ford has come to national atten
tion through the per/Se Award
Contest for one-act plays. The
competition is designed to pro
mote recognition of dramatic
scripts of outstanding merit.
The winning plays appear in
the recently released Winter Is
sue.
The publication began two
years ago as a general literary
magazine with the purpose of
publishing any work which has
literary merit and which pre
sents an honest point of view,
according to managing editor
Bob Freelen.
Editor and Publisher of the
magazine is Robin White of
Woodside, a Wallace Stegner
Creative Writing Fellow at Stan
ford in 1956-57.

White's reasoning is that all
large national magazines have
substantial editorial biases. How
ever, he believes that anyone
with something honest to say
should have a forum for expres
sion and exposure to an audience
without fear of editorial censor
ship, the biases of advertising,
and anxiety over giving offense
to some potion of the reader
ship.
Avoiding any particular editor
ial stance, the magazine seeks
to provide a place for expression
of ideas. As implied by the name,
the publication considers con
tributions as separate entities,
of and by themselves.
All staff work and contribu
tions are voluntary; the maga
zine is supported by newstand
sales, subscriptions, and invest
ment. Its present circulation is
about 2,500 issues an edition.
Intense competition is general
ly prohibitive to the survival of
new, small magazines, and the
editors are presently trying to
expand publication. They are at
tempting to have it reviewed,
and the Per/Se Award Contest
has helped considerably.
Mrs. White, who is her hus
band's chief assistant, comment
ed that advertising would be
welcome, but also pointed out
the danger of its becoming dicta
torial, which event would be con
trary to the purpose of the pub
lication.
White, who is also the chief
financial backer of the maga
zine, was born the son of mis
sionary parents and grew up in
the hills of south India. He
moved to New Haven, Connecti

cut, where he attended several
years of high school before ma
triculating at Yale.
After graduation from college
(Yale '50), he and his wife, Mar
ny, moved to Seabrook where
he began his writing career. Im
mediately prior to coming to
Stanford, Mr. White received a
full fellowship to the Bredloe
Writing Seminar in Vermont.
Among his books are four
works about India: House of
Many Rooms; Elephant Hill, for
which he won the Harper's Prize
of $10,000; Men and Angels; and
Foreign Hills. He is a regular
contributor to the leading Amer
ican literary magazines.
Among his other works are
All in Favor Say No and his
latest, His Own Kind, published
in England. He is presently oc

cupied with a speaking tour of
the Northeast and South to pub
licize his new book.
Mrs. White commented that
she and her husband were both
pleased and surprised at the
response to the Per/Se Award
contest. There were 1,500 en
tries.
A nation-wide panel of judges,
all of whom are experienced
actors, directors, producers, or
teachers in the theater unani
mously chose "The Great
Saltee", a very adult, modern,
comic ghost story. The author
is Richard Snyder, literature
and writing teacher at Ashland
College of Ohio.
Honorable mention went to
"The Death of Everymom" by
Arnold Powell of Birmingham-
Southern College of Alabama.

After graduation from college
(Yale '50), he and his wife, Mar
ny, moved to Seabrook where
he began his writing career. Im
mediately prior to coming to
Stanford, Mr. White received a
full fellowship to the Bredloe
Writing Seminar in Vermont.
Among his books are four
works about India: House of
Many Rooms; Elephant Hill, for
which he won the Harper's Prize
of $10,000; Men and Angels; and
Foreign Hills. He is a regular
contributor to the leading Amer
ican literary magazines.
Among his other works are
All in Favor Say No and his
latest, His Own Kind, published
in England. He is presently oc

cupied with a speaking tour of
the Northeast and South to pub
licize his new book.
Mrs. White commented that
she and her husband were both
pleased and surprised at the
response to the Per/Se Award
contest. There were 1,500 en
tries.
A nation-wide panel of judges,
all of whom are experienced
actors, directors, producers, or
teachers in the theater unani
mously chose "The Great
Saltee", a very adult, modern,
comic ghost story. The author
is Richard Snyder, literature
and writing teacher at Ashland
College of Ohio.
Honorable mention went to
"The Death of Everymom" by
Arnold Powell of Birmingham-
Southern College of Alabama.
Per/Se, an international liter
ary magazine published at Stan
ford has come to national atten
tion through the per/Se Award
Contest for one-act plays. The
competition is designed to pro
mote recognition of dramatic
scripts of outstanding merit.
The winning plays appear in
the recently released Winter Is
sue.
The publication began two
years ago as a general literary
magazine with the purpose of
publishing any work which has
literary merit and which pre
sents an honest point of view,
according to managing editor
Bob Freelen.
Editor and Publisher of the
magazine is Robin White of
Woodside, a Wallace Stegner
Creative Writing Fellow at Stan
ford in 1956-57.

White's reasoning is that all
large national magazines have
substantial editorial biases. How
ever, he believes that anyone
with something honest to say
should have a forum for expres
sion and exposure to an audience
without fear of editorial censor
ship, the biases of advertising,
and anxiety over giving offense
to some potion of the reader
ship.
Avoiding any particular editor
ial stance, the magazine seeks
to provide a place for expression
of ideas. As implied by the name,
the publication considers con
tributions as separate entities,
of and by themselves.
All staff work and contribu
tions are voluntary; the maga
zine is supported by newstand
sales, subscriptions, and invest
ment. Its present circulation is
about 2,500 issues an edition.
Intense competition is general
ly prohibitive to the survival of
new, small magazines, and the
editors are presently trying to
expand publication. They are at
tempting to have it reviewed,
and the Per/Se Award Contest
has helped considerably.
Mrs. White, who is her hus
band's chief assistant, comment
ed that advertising would be
welcome, but also pointed out
the danger of its becoming dicta
torial, which event would be con
trary to the purpose of the pub
lication.
White, who is also the chief
financial backer of the maga
zine, was born the son of mis
sionary parents and grew up in
the hills of south India. He
moved to New Haven, Connecti

cut, where he attended several
years of high school before ma
triculating at Yale.
