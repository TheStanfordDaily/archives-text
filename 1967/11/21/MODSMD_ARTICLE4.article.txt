# Foreign Students
## Are They Isolated? 
### SUE NEIL 
Are Stanford's international
students isolated in a group of
their own, cut off from the cur
rents of campus activities?
The search for an answer
leads to the door of a vener
able old residence opening to the
sound of a collage of bouncing
ping-pong balls, shouted encour
agement from spectators, clink
ing dishes in the kitchen, and
several animated conversations
from the lounge.
The atmosphere is perhaps
the most relaxed and home-like
on campus. This is the Bechtel
International Center, known as
common parlance as the I-Cen
ter, the home-away-from-home
for foreign students here.
There are approximately 1100
international students enrolled in
Stanford. The largest group is
fj .71 Europe, followed by Asia,
. n South and Central Amer

ica. Africa and the Middle East
are represented by smaller num
bers. The single country with
the most students here is Can
ada. England, France and China
are grouped close behind.
The I-Center's purpose is to
provide a "place to come" and
relax that will promote "inter
action between American stu
dents and foreign students," Mrs.
Gwyn Dukes, i-Center program
counselor, told The Daily.
How well does the I-Center ful
fill this purpose?
Douglas Kennedy, a graduate
from Ireland in his first year
here, said that "they keep you
working" so that "I haven't had
time to feel isolated." However,
he also admitted that the I-Cen
ter "is not the best way to meet
people," as "'you generally meet
only other foreign students."
A second-year Pakistani grad
uate agreed with this, saying

that the I-Center is the only
place one can come to meet other
students, but often "people of
one country form their own
groups and talk about their coun
try."
He found it hard to meet
Americans because "we don't
live in dorms."
Another problem seen by sev
eral is that "if you're married,
your wife can't come here."
But the I-Center does offer
many activities for foreign stu
dents. Besides ping-pong and
chess, you can find a game of
darts, croquet, or volleyball,
ter A color TV set, short-wave
radio, a library of newspapers
and magazines from all over the
world, and two kitchens are also
popular features of the I-Cen
tfr.
Weekly programs for both
American and international stu
dents are also offered. One of
these is the student sponsored
Saturday evening abroad. The
students from the country fea
tured show films, demonstrate
songs and dances, and serve re
freshments typical of their coun
try.
Another regular event is the
luncheon discussion group, in
which about 15 students, half
American and half from abroad,
meet for a home-cooked lunch at
the I-Center to consider a topic
of current interest
Other popular programs are
the International film forum, the
theater series, and the Tuesday
afternoon current events coffee
hours.
The facilities of the I-Center
are open for all students from
8 a.m. to 12 midnight every day
except Sunday, when the center
is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
However, according to the for
eign students, not very many
Americans ever come there, al
though some are fairly regular
visitors. "At least the host and
hostess" are there, said one grad
uate.
To introduce Stanford for

eign students to America and to
acquaint them with family life
here, the Community Commit
tee for International Students, a
group of over 500 families in the
area, plans ten-day homestays
and tours for new students.
Reaction to this program
varies. Gerd Prolss, a student
from Germany, thought it was
a "very good program" that he
enjoyed.
On the other hand, a Pakistani
student said, 'The I-Center peo
ple should find out more about
the kind of family and the kind
of student they'd like." He felt
his family would have liked a
European better.
For most International stu
dents, America is completely dif
ferent from what they had ex
pected or known at home.
One student was pleasantly
surprised to find that Americans
really are hard working. "They
earn their weekends," he ob
served.
Prolss said that here a univer
sity is just " a place to prepare
for a career." He thought that
it should emphasize "human val
ues" and shouldn't have required

courses. Students "shouldn't
have to study so hard."
Another student found it
"amusing" that Americans were
much the way he expected
them to be. He had formed his
impressions from watching
American TV programs and
movies and characterized Ameri
cans as "caricatures."
One mentioned that living
with a roommate was a new ex
perience to get accustomed to.
His American roommate had dif
ferent study habits and gener
ally stayed up later than this
student Was used to.
Social life was an interesting
subject. One comment was that
over here, "Dating is an expen
sive affair."
A German student thought
that the girls here are too se
rious about dating. "They think
it's always a romantic affair,"
he said. He felt that girls should
accept a date even when asked
at the last minute on Friday or
Saturday night, instead of say
ing they have too much study
ing.
However, he also found the
girls "pretty and easy to talk to."

ONE OF STANFORD'S MANY foreign students plays ping-pong 1 in
tbe Bechtei International Center. Some of the students complain ef
Isolation at the University.
Are Stanford's international
students isolated in a group of
their own, cut off from the cur
rents of campus activities?
The search for an answer
leads to the door of a vener
able old residence opening to the
sound of a collage of bouncing
ping-pong balls, shouted encour
agement from spectators, clink
ing dishes in the kitchen, and
several animated conversations
from the lounge.
The atmosphere is perhaps
the most relaxed and home-like
on campus. This is the Bechtel
International Center, known as
common parlance as the I-Cen
ter, the home-away-from-home
for foreign students here.
There are approximately 1100
international students enrolled in
Stanford. The largest group is
fj .71 Europe, followed by Asia,
. n South and Central Amer

ica. Africa and the Middle East
are represented by smaller num
bers. The single country with
the most students here is Can
ada. England, France and China
are grouped close behind.
The I-Center's purpose is to
provide a "place to come" and
relax that will promote "inter
action between American stu
dents and foreign students," Mrs.
Gwyn Dukes, i-Center program
counselor, told The Daily.
How well does the I-Center ful
fill this purpose?
Douglas Kennedy, a graduate
from Ireland in his first year
here, said that "they keep you
working" so that "I haven't had
time to feel isolated." However,
he also admitted that the I-Cen
ter "is not the best way to meet
people," as "'you generally meet
only other foreign students."
A second-year Pakistani grad
uate agreed with this, saying

that the I-Center is the only
place one can come to meet other
students, but often "people of
one country form their own
groups and talk about their coun
try."
He found it hard to meet
Americans because "we don't
live in dorms."
Another problem seen by sev
eral is that "if you're married,
your wife can't come here."

ONE OF STANFORD'S MANY foreign students plays ping-pong 1 in
tbe Bechtei International Center. Some of the students complain ef
Isolation at the University.
Are Stanford's international
students isolated in a group of
their own, cut off from the cur
rents of campus activities?
The search for an answer
leads to the door of a vener
able old residence opening to the
sound of a collage of bouncing
ping-pong balls, shouted encour
agement from spectators, clink
ing dishes in the kitchen, and
several animated conversations
from the lounge.
The atmosphere is perhaps
the most relaxed and home-like
on campus. This is the Bechtel
International Center, known as
common parlance as the I-Cen
ter, the home-away-from-home
for foreign students here.
There are approximately 1100
international students enrolled in
Stanford. The largest group is
fj .71 Europe, followed by Asia,
. n South and Central Amer

ica. Africa and the Middle East
are represented by smaller num
bers. The single country with
the most students here is Can
ada. England, France and China
are grouped close behind.
The I-Center's purpose is to
provide a "place to come" and
relax that will promote "inter
action between American stu
dents and foreign students," Mrs.
Gwyn Dukes, i-Center program
counselor, told The Daily.
How well does the I-Center ful
fill this purpose?
Douglas Kennedy, a graduate
from Ireland in his first year
here, said that "they keep you
working" so that "I haven't had
time to feel isolated." However,
he also admitted that the I-Cen
ter "is not the best way to meet
people," as "'you generally meet
only other foreign students."
A second-year Pakistani grad
uate agreed with this, saying

that the I-Center is the only
place one can come to meet other
students, but often "people of
one country form their own
groups and talk about their coun
try."
He found it hard to meet
Americans because "we don't
live in dorms."
Another problem seen by sev
eral is that "if you're married,
your wife can't come here."
But the I-Center does offer
many activities for foreign stu
dents. Besides ping-pong and
chess, you can find a game of
darts, croquet, or volleyball,
ter A color TV set, short-wave
radio, a library of newspapers
and magazines from all over the
world, and two kitchens are also
popular features of the I-Cen
tfr.
Weekly programs for both
American and international stu
dents are also offered. One of
these is the student sponsored
Saturday evening abroad. The
students from the country fea
tured show films, demonstrate
songs and dances, and serve re
freshments typical of their coun
try.
Another regular event is the
luncheon discussion group, in
which about 15 students, half
American and half from abroad,
meet for a home-cooked lunch at
the I-Center to consider a topic
of current interest
Other popular programs are
the International film forum, the
theater series, and the Tuesday
afternoon current events coffee
hours.
The facilities of the I-Center
are open for all students from
8 a.m. to 12 midnight every day
except Sunday, when the center
is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
However, according to the for
eign students, not very many
Americans ever come there, al
though some are fairly regular
visitors. "At least the host and
hostess" are there, said one grad
uate.
To introduce Stanford for

eign students to America and to
acquaint them with family life
here, the Community Commit
tee for International Students, a
group of over 500 families in the
area, plans ten-day homestays
and tours for new students.
Reaction to this program
varies. Gerd Prolss, a student
from Germany, thought it was
a "very good program" that he
enjoyed.
On the other hand, a Pakistani
student said, 'The I-Center peo
ple should find out more about
the kind of family and the kind
