# Foreign Students
## Are They Isolated? 
### SUE NEIL 
Are Stanford's international
students isolated in a group of
their own, cut off from the cur
rents of campus activities?
The search for an answer
leads to the door of a vener
able old residence opening to the
sound of a collage of bouncing
ping-pong balls, shouted encour
agement from spectators, clink
ing dishes in the kitchen, and
several animated conversations
from the lounge.
The atmosphere is perhaps
the most relaxed and home-like
on campus. This is the Bechtel
International Center, known as
common parlance as the I-Cen
ter, the home-away-from-home
for foreign students here.
There are approximately 1100
international students enrolled in
Stanford. The largest group is
fj .71 Europe, followed by Asia,
. n South and Central Amer

ica. Africa and the Middle East
are represented by smaller num
bers. The single country with
the most students here is Can
ada. England, France and China
are grouped close behind.
The I-Center's purpose is to
provide a "place to come" and
relax that will promote "inter
action between American stu
dents and foreign students," Mrs.
Gwyn Dukes, i-Center program
counselor, told The Daily.
How well does the I-Center ful
fill this purpose?
Douglas Kennedy, a graduate
from Ireland in his first year
here, said that "they keep you
working" so that "I haven't had
time to feel isolated." However,
he also admitted that the I-Cen
ter "is not the best way to meet
people," as "'you generally meet
only other foreign students."
A second-year Pakistani grad
uate agreed with this, saying

that the I-Center is the only
place one can come to meet other
students, but often "people of
one country form their own
groups and talk about their coun
try."
He found it hard to meet
Americans because "we don't
live in dorms."
Another problem seen by sev
eral is that "if you're married,
your wife can't come here."
But the I-Center does offer
many activities for foreign stu
dents. Besides ping-pong and
chess, you can find a game of
darts, croquet, or volleyball,
ter A color TV set, short-wave
radio, a library of newspapers
and magazines from all over the
world, and two kitchens are also
popular features of the I-Cen
tfr.
Weekly programs for both
American and international stu
dents are also offered. One of
