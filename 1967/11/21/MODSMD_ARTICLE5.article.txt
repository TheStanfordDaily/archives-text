# Violence Mars Demonstration Opposed To Dow At San Jose
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Police used tear gas and a
flying wedge to break up a dem
onstration against Dow Chemi
cal recruiters at the San Jose
State campus yesterday after
noon.
Fourteen people were arrested,
and at least one person was in
jured seriously enough to war
rant hospitalization.
Helmeted San Jose Police,
sheriff's police and members of
the California State Highway
Patrol used billy clubs and at
least five tear gas cannisters to
break up the crowd of 3000 stu

dents and faculty members.
The Students for a Demo
cratic Society (SDS) and the Pro
fessors Against War (PAW)
sponsored the demonstration in
protest against Dow's manufac
ture of napalm for use in Viet
nam.
Enter Building
The trouble started when the
police used a wedge formation
to enter the building. As the last
of the police went in, demon
strators threw rocks and other
objects at the door breaking a
glass pane.
The crowd was then ordered

to disperse by Police Captain
Howard McDonald. "You are in
unlawful assembly on state prop
erty," he announced through a
bullhorn situated on the second
floor of the administration build
ing.
When the students refused to
disperse, the police charged out
of the building in a wedge for
mation in an attempt to force
the crowd to move on.
The law officers then returned
to the building to regroup. Once
inside they donned gas masks.
They then fired tear gas into
the crowd for the first time.
The crowd retaliated by throw
ing more objects at the building.
The police emerged from the
building and again lobbed tear
gas grenades into the crowd.
Seventeen more police cars
came and the demonstration was
finally broken up.
Reagan Comments
Governor Reagan said that
teachers who encouraged or took
part in the San Jose demonstra
tion "have forfeited their right
to teach."
He added that students "in
volved in these criminal viola
tions . . . should be severly disci
plined and subject to expulsion."
"Once it has been established
who is to blame, those persons
must be punished. To advocate
firm action is not political inter
ference in our higher education
al system. Such action is neces
sary to preserve the system," he
continued.
"It is high time that those the
people have elected, and those
they have selected to run their
public institutions put to an end
such iriesponsible action. If we
don't, the people will find some
one who will," said the Gover
nor.
The San Jose chapter of the
SDS called a meeting last night
to decide whether the demon
strations should continue today,
and if they are continued, how
they should be conducted.

A similar protest to that at
San Jose occurred last week at
UCLA, also in protest against
recruiters from Dow Chemical
Company.
Then, antiwar pickets and
police scuffled during interviews
between Dow and job-seeking
students. Uniformed officers
broke through a picket-line and
seized an unauthorized public ad
dress system. The interviews
however continued uninterrupt
ed.
That afternoon the pickets
moved to the Chancellor's office
to protest the presence of city
policemen on the campus.

Planned demonstrations
against recruiters from the US
Army did not take place at the
University of Wisconsin yester
day. Over three hundred helmet
ed riot police stood guard out
side the building where the in
terviews were to take place.
Only one demonstrator showed
up and he made no attempt to
block the entrance.
When the interviews were fin
ished at noon, about 300 demon
strators showed up. They walked
to the local Selective Service
Board, entered, and demonstrat
ed for a while. They then return
ed to the campus on foot, follow
ed by a yellow school bus with
20 riot policemen inside.

Wisconsin was the sight of
violent demonstrations about two
weeks ago against Dow recruit
ers.
Incidents Avoided
Incidents were avoided at San
Francisco State yesterday when
the administration at that school
asked Marine recruiters not to
come because of the school's
inability to provide adequate pro
tection for the recruiters.
The action was taken because
the campus police at San Fran
cisco State are tied up guarding
the administration building, to
protect it against demonstrations
against the board trying the al

Students Union for attacking
members of the staff of the col
lege's newspaper, The Gator.

Planned demonstrations

side the building where the in

Only one demonstrator showed

When the interviews were fin

strators showed up. They walked
to the local Selective Service
Board, entered, and demonstrat
ed for a while. They then return
ed to the campus on foot, follow
ed by a yellow school bus with
20 riot policemen inside.

Wisconsin was the sight of
violent demonstrations about two
weeks ago against Dow recruit
ers.
Incidents Avoided
Incidents were avoided at San
Francisco State yesterday when
the administration at that school
asked Marine recruiters not to
come because of the school's
inability to provide adequate pro
tection for the recruiters.
The action was taken because
the campus police at San Fran
cisco State are tied up guarding
the administration building, to
protect it against demonstrations
against the board trying the al
leged members of the Black
Students Union for attacking
members of the staff of the col
lege's newspaper, The Gator.
Police used tear gas and a
flying wedge to break up a dem
onstration against Dow Chemi
cal recruiters at the San Jose
State campus yesterday after
noon.
Fourteen people were arrested,
and at least one person was in
jured seriously enough to war
rant hospitalization.
Helmeted San Jose Police,
sheriff's police and members of
the California State Highway
Patrol used billy clubs and at
least five tear gas cannisters to
break up the crowd of 3000 stu

dents and faculty members.
The Students for a Demo
cratic Society (SDS) and the Pro
fessors Against War (PAW)
sponsored the demonstration in
protest against Dow's manufac
ture of napalm for use in Viet
nam.
Enter Building
The trouble started when the
police used a wedge formation
to enter the building. As the last
of the police went in, demon
strators threw rocks and other
objects at the door breaking a
glass pane.
The crowd was then ordered

to disperse by Police Captain
Howard McDonald. "You are in
unlawful assembly on state prop
erty," he announced through a
bullhorn situated on the second
floor of the administration build
ing.
When the students refused to
disperse, the police charged out
of the building in a wedge for
mation in an attempt to force
the crowd to move on.
The law officers then returned
to the building to regroup. Once
inside they donned gas masks.
They then fired tear gas into
the crowd for the first time.
The crowd retaliated by throw
ing more objects at the building.
The police emerged from the
building and again lobbed tear
gas grenades into the crowd.
Seventeen more police cars
came and the demonstration was
finally broken up.
Reagan Comments
Governor Reagan said that
teachers who encouraged or took
part in the San Jose demonstra
tion "have forfeited their right
to teach."
He added that students "in
volved in these criminal viola
tions . . . should be severly disci
plined and subject to expulsion."
"Once it has been established
who is to blame, those persons
must be punished. To advocate
firm action is not political inter
ference in our higher education
al system. Such action is neces
sary to preserve the system," he
continued.
"It is high time that those the
people have elected, and those
they have selected to run their
public institutions put to an end
such iriesponsible action. If we
don't, the people will find some
one who will," said the Gover
nor.
The San Jose chapter of the
SDS called a meeting last night
to decide whether the demon
strations should continue today,
and if they are continued, how
they should be conducted.

Reagan Comments
Governor Reagan said that
teachers who encouraged or took
part in the San Jose demonstra
tion "have forfeited their right
to teach."
He added that students "in
volved in these criminal viola
tions . . . should be severly disci
plined and subject to expulsion."
"Once it has been established
who is to blame, those persons
must be punished. To advocate
firm action is not political inter
ference in our higher education
al system. Such action is neces
sary to preserve the system," he
continued.
"It is high time that those the
people have elected, and those
they have selected to run their
public institutions put to an end
such iriesponsible action. If we
don't, the people will find some
one who will," said the Gover
nor.
The San Jose chapter of the

A similar protest to that at
San Jose occurred last week at
UCLA, also in protest against
recruiters from Dow Chemical
Company.
Then, antiwar pickets and
police scuffled during interviews
between Dow and job-seeking
students. Uniformed officers
broke through a picket-line and
seized an unauthorized public ad
dress system. The interviews
however continued uninterrupt
ed.
That afternoon the pickets
moved to the Chancellor's office
to protest the presence of city
policemen on the campus.

Planned demonstrations
against recruiters from the US
Army did not take place at the
University of Wisconsin yester
day. Over three hundred helmet
ed riot police stood guard out
side the building where the in
terviews were to take place.
Only one demonstrator showed
up and he made no attempt to
block the entrance.
When the interviews were fin
ished at noon, about 300 demon
strators showed up. They walked
to the local Selective Service
Board, entered, and demonstrat
ed for a while. They then return
ed to the campus on foot, follow
ed by a yellow school bus with
20 riot policemen inside.

Wisconsin was the sight of
violent demonstrations about two
weeks ago against Dow recruit
ers.
Incidents Avoided
Incidents were avoided at San
Francisco State yesterday when
the administration at that school
asked Marine recruiters not to
come because of the school's
inability to provide adequate pro
tection for the recruiters.
The action was taken because
the campus police at San Fran
cisco State are tied up guarding
the administration building, to
protect it against demonstrations
against the board trying the al
leged members of the Black
Students Union for attacking
members of the staff of the col
lege's newspaper, The Gator.
Police used tear gas and a
flying wedge to break up a dem
onstration against Dow Chemi
cal recruiters at the San Jose
State campus yesterday after
noon.
Fourteen people were arrested,
and at least one person was in
jured seriously enough to war
rant hospitalization.
Helmeted San Jose Police,
sheriff's police and members of
the California State Highway
Patrol used billy clubs and at
least five tear gas cannisters to
break up the crowd of 3000 stu

dents and faculty members.
The Students for a Demo
cratic Society (SDS) and the Pro
fessors Against War (PAW)
sponsored the demonstration in
protest against Dow's manufac
ture of napalm for use in Viet
nam.
Enter Building
The trouble started when the
police used a wedge formation
to enter the building. As the last
of the police went in, demon
strators threw rocks and other
objects at the door breaking a
glass pane.
The crowd was then ordered

to disperse by Police Captain
Howard McDonald. "You are in
unlawful assembly on state prop
erty," he announced through a
bullhorn situated on the second
floor of the administration build
ing.
