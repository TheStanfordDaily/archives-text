# Violence Mars Demonstration Opposed To Dow At San Jose
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Police used tear gas and a
flying wedge to break up a dem
onstration against Dow Chemi
cal recruiters at the San Jose
State campus yesterday after
noon.
Fourteen people were arrested,
and at least one person was in
jured seriously enough to war
rant hospitalization.
Helmeted San Jose Police,
sheriff's police and members of
the California State Highway
Patrol used billy clubs and at
least five tear gas cannisters to
break up the crowd of 3000 stu

dents and faculty members.
The Students for a Demo
cratic Society (SDS) and the Pro
fessors Against War (PAW)
sponsored the demonstration in
protest against Dow's manufac
ture of napalm for use in Viet
nam.
Enter Building
The trouble started when the
police used a wedge formation
to enter the building. As the last
of the police went in, demon
strators threw rocks and other
objects at the door breaking a
glass pane.
The crowd was then ordered

to disperse by Police Captain
Howard McDonald. "You are in
unlawful assembly on state prop
erty," he announced through a
bullhorn situated on the second
floor of the administration build
ing.
When the students refused to
disperse, the police charged out
of the building in a wedge for
mation in an attempt to force
the crowd to move on.
The law officers then returned
to the building to regroup. Once
inside they donned gas masks.
They then fired tear gas into
the crowd for the first time.
The crowd retaliated by throw
ing more objects at the building.
The police emerged from the
building and again lobbed tear
gas grenades into the crowd.
Seventeen more police cars
came and the demonstration was
finally broken up.
Reagan Comments
Governor Reagan said that
teachers who encouraged or took
part in the San Jose demonstra
tion "have forfeited their right
to teach."
He added that students "in
volved in these criminal viola
tions . . . should be severly disci
plined and subject to expulsion."
"Once it has been established
who is to blame, those persons
must be punished. To advocate
firm action is not political inter
ference in our higher education
al system. Such action is neces
sary to preserve the system," he
continued.
"It is high time that those the
people have elected, and those
they have selected to run their
public institutions put to an end
such iriesponsible action. If we
don't, the people will find some
one who will," said the Gover
nor.
The San Jose chapter of the
SDS called a meeting last night
to decide whether the demon
strations should continue today,
and if they are continued, how
they should be conducted.
