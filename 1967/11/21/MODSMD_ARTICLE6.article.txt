### DAN SNELL 
What was going to be a mass
display of student power at
Berkeley developed instead yes
terday into a simple flag-raising
campaign.
Five hundred students met at
noon in the lower plaza across
from Sproul Hall to protest the
proposed suspension of 11 stu
dents from the University for
participating in illegal rallies
held jn the campus during last
month's "Stop The Draft
Week."
But no one can be sure what
will happen if Chancellor Roger
Heyns decides to suspend the
11. Leaders of the Movement
Against Political Suspension
(MAPS) have been talking
about staging a "mill-in" clog
ging corridors with huge gorups
of slowly moving demonstrat
ors.
Leaders Explain
MAPS leaders explained at
the rally that a meeting the
night before had decided against
setting a deadline by which
Heyns had to decide whether to
suspend the students. Students
had planned to hold "disruptive
obstructionist demonstrations"
if Heyns failed to meet their
deadline.
MAPS members raised a flag
on the nearby Student Union
that read, "No More Political
Suspensions." They then pro
ceded to try to raise a skull and
crossbones flag from a flagpole
in front of Sproul Hall.
The flag's legend was "Jolly
Roger," referring to Chancellor
Roger Heyns.
Six University police wielding
billy clubs stopped demonstra
tors from raising the flag. But
no one was arrested because
the crowd succeeded in getting
students out of the hands of
the police.
Students March
The assembled students then
marched to the Chancellor's
office to demand a flagpole of
their own. An aid to the Chan
cellor said he would take the
matter under consideration.
Marching now to Dwinelle
Hall demonstrators finally found
a pole nobody wanted to defend.
They raised their "Jolly Roger"
flag there.
