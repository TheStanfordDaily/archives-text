# Judicial Council
## 
### 
The Fundamental Standard is: Students are
expected to show, both within and without the
University, such respect for order, morality, per
sonal honor, and the rights of others as is de
manded of good citizens.
— ASSU By-Laws
LASSU will consider a bill tonight to make a
in the ASSU by-laws. If the bill passes, a
Sentence will be inserted into the by-laws stating
that to violate a University policy is not ipso
facto to violate the Fundamental Standard.
i*
r The importance of this clause is not that it
will provide a legal loophole before Judicial
Council, for students who violate University
policies; because it will not.
What the clause does say is that the interpre
tation of the Fundamental Standard is the re
sponsibility of Judicial Council, not the all-facul
ty Interim Judicial Board or any other non-stu
dent body.
The issue has a long, involved history, begin
ning with a sit-in in President Sterling's office in
1966 to protest against draft deferment tests.
One of those who sat in and was tried by Judi
cial Council, a non-student named Marc Sapir,
was acquitted on the grounds that he had not
violated the Fundamental Standard. On appeal
to the IJB, the Council's decision was reversed
and Sapir was convicted.
In its lengthy decision, the IJB explained that
it considered anv violation of a University policy
to be per se a violation of the Fundamental
Standard, unless that University policy explicitly
conflicted with the ASSU Constitution or By-
Laws.

(This interpretation of ASSU by-laws, the
IJB said, was not the grounds on which it con
victed Sapir, however.)
This decision in effect denied Judicial Council
the right to render final interpretation of the
Fundamental Standard. The Council, it was ar
gued, might find some instance when an appar
ent violation of a University policy was not a
violation of the Fundamental Standard.
The Sapir trial was such a case. And the anti-
CIA demonstrators' trial looked like it might be
another. This is why Judicial Council refused to
try them.
Unfortunately, the council's attitude has no
basis in law as found in the ASSU Constitution.
What would happen, for example, if a student
broke a University regulation which was not a
Fundamental Standard violation? Who would
try him?
The ASSU Constitution gives Judicial Council
"exclusive original jurisdiction" in all cases re
garding student affairs and conduct.
Moreover, the Constitution provides no other
judicial body to try offenses against University
policy which are not offenses against the Funda
mental Standard.
Thus, the IJB reasoned it was the intention of
the Constitution's drafters that Judicial Council
was supposed to try such cases.
Obviously some kind of reform is needed in
the student judiciary, and LASSU must provide
it —beginning tonight. A good beginning would
be to separate University policy from the Funda
mental Standard.
