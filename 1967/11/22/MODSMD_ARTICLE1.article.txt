Stanford yesterday elected a new head yell leader â€”almost. As Elec
tions Commissioner Craig Brown (seated among election workers
at the ASSU office) counted ballots for the campus-wide election, he
discovered that Bill Eakland had 370 votes, and the team of Nick
Farwell and Tim Carpenter had 35-1 votes. As many as 200 votes are
expected from overseas campuses, but they may not be telegraphed
here for days. The yell leader selection has already been delayed
once by the invalidation of a primary by Judicial Council. The yell
leader, incidentally, leads cheers at athletic events.
