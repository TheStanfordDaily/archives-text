# San Jose Crisis
## 
### 
The demonstrations at San Jose State against
the Dow recruiters are a tragedy for the anti
war movement and for the college.
The demonstrators are first to blame, for they
have employed physical obstruction and force.
Failing to see their protest as only one small part
of the entire anti-war movement, they place im
mense importance on stopping one particular set
of interviews.
We share the concern and rebellion of the
demonstrators over the production and use of
napalm and over some of the actions of the CIA.
However, we cannot condone their action to
physically stop recruiting on campus.
The demonstrators are ignoring the issue of
freedom of expression on campus. The anti-Dow
groups have the right to express their views, as
do the pro-war students and the Dow recruiters.
To deny this is to restrict academic freedom.
Furthermore, the demonstrators are sacrificing
the peace and order of their campuses. Their
totalitarian actions created the conditions for
violence.

When it came, though, the violence was the
fault of an administration that overreacted.
When the demonstrators first blocked the doors
on Monday, the administration could have al
lowed the demonstration to go on without call
ing in police.
However, heads were not that cool and, to
show the kids who was boss, the police moved in
to physically break up the demonstration. Vio
lence ensued and continued yesterday. By con
trast, Stanford's administration allowed the CIA
demonstration to continue and they are relying
on subsequent disciplinary action to make the
point that such demonstrations are improper and
cannot be permitted. Of course, the Stanford
demonstrations involved only about 30 people.
Larger crowds are harder to handle.
The intense hatred and injury to the operation
of the university cannot be justified by the in
terests of the anti-war movement. The demon
strators and the San Jose State administration
have done themselves much harm by the actions
of the past two days.
