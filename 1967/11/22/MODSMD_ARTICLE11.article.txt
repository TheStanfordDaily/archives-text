## Ralston Comes Under Fire 
### 
Editor, the Dally:
For four years as an under
graduate and another year as a
grad student, I have had the op
portunity to watch Coach John's
Boys in action. Ralston has been
at Stanford for five seasons.
Five disappointing seasons. Five
seasons of play which was gen
erally dull and unexciting, and
execution which was frequently
sloppy.
And yet, the material has al
most invariably been good. John
McKay, coach at USC has stated
that Stanford has some of the
best talent on the coast. At least,
then, Stanford has had fine po
tential.
The obvious question presents
itself, why hasn't this potential
been developed?
Let's bring this problem into
the open. Let's admit what
everyone knows. Coach John is
a lousy coach. And let's do some
thing about it. Let's reject Ral
ston.
DUMP JOHN IN '68.

Law
• Judicial Council
Editor, the Daily:
In the article (Dally, Novem
ber 21) on the refusal of the
Judicial Council to hear the
cases arising from the demon
stration on November 1, the
Daily says that I "concede that
the legislature has the authority
to make such a change in the
ASSU by-laws..." It is impor
tant to understand what change
I was discussing with the Daily
reporter.
LASSU has the authority to
create a so-called conflict-of-law
with the University Policy on
Campus Demonstrations, so
that, according to ASSU by-laws,
cases involving alleged viola
tions of that policy would be
heard by the IJB rather than the
Judicial Council.
Alternatively, LASSU could
amend its by-laws in order to
provide that University regula
tions and policies are separate
from the Fundamental Standard.
The Judicial Council would con
tinue to have jurisdiction of both
kinds of cases, unless there was
•a conflict-of-law; but, given
such a change, the question of

whether a University policy had
been violated could be decided
without reference to the Funda
mental Standard. This is the
change which was extensively
discussed last Spring following
the IJB decision in the SapLr
case, and it is the change I had
in mind during my discussion
with the Daily reporter.
However, if the proposed
change is intended not only to
distinguish University regula
tions from the Fundamental
Standard but also to provide
that the Judicial Council may
hear only Fundamental Stan
dard cases, then it would go
well beyond what I had in mind.
A change of that kind would be
very serious.

• Help, My Identity
Editor, the Daily:
HELP. I AM LOSING MY
IDENTITY.
With your Article on "Beirut
in English" I started feeling that
the whole world is becoming
more of a dream than it actually
is. The two major shocks I had,
not to say anything about the
others, were in getting to know
Beirut through the different an
gle; i.e. in English. The second
shock was my identity; I saw
my horrible picture alright, but
800 my name has changed in
one night to denote something
completely different from what
my father intended it to be.
I don't really mind being called
"the friend of God," which is
the meaning of "michae-El," but
to have my family name
changed to Nabti is unforgiv
able, especially that my family
takes pride of being the first
family that ever listened to
Christ and took its name after
their conversion to Christianity,
Saliba originally meant the car
rier of the cross.

• CI 5 And Racism
Editor, The Daily:
I had at first missed Johnie

Scott's letter in Tuesday's Daily,
so when someone told me of
his reply to my letter of Mon
day, I looked forward with an
ticipation to reading it. I knew
of his reputation: intelligent, ar
ticulate, angry, a spokesman for
the Negro on campus.
His letter was angry, all right.
But I did not find the cold, quiet,
incisive rage I expected. In
stead, there was only the furi
ous and incoherent pomposity
that is typical of Southern Sen
ators in the movies.
I would like to take this op
portunity to point out that not
only was the Negro minority
not represented in Mr. Lyman's
nominations, but neither was
any other minority. Cl 5 is not
made up of Negroes and whites,
Protestants and Jews, Chinese
and Mexicans. It is made up of
students, faculty, and admini
stration.
Mr. Scott demonstrated con
siderable confusion over the
term racism. It is not just pre
judice against minorities. Rath
er, racism is ascribing to any
individual certain characteris
tics which his race is supposed
to possess, and which he, in
fact, does not possess. Thus, it
is as indefensible to say a Negro
would make a better Cl 5 Rep
resentative as it is to say a
white would.
And in answer to the last
paragraph of Mr. Scott's letter,
the story of how the good
Black Knights venture out into
the cruel world to right wrong,
the AMERICAN WAY, and are
rewarded only with the slings
and arrows of outrageous for
tune, I can only say:
Are you kidding?
Did you think it was going
to be easy? Did you believe
the world was just waiting for
gems of truth to roll from your
lips? If you are suffering from
slurs and reeling from abuse
now, I'm afraid when the chips
are down, you will be, too.

• I'll Be Damned!
Editor, The Daily:
Wasn't anyone else sickened
by the Stanford half-wits trying
to beat hell out of eleven Cal
half-wits, with thousands of
their tribe screaming from the
sidelines.
Is this a university? Is this
why we are here?
Repent or be damned
