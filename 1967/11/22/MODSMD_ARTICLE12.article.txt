## Coach Purina's Bear Chow 
### Robert E. Stone 
Although they have been try
ing to hide it all season, Coach
Purina and his eleven checker
board squares indicated this
past Saturday that they are
really little more than bear
food.
For a while it appeared that
the checkerboard squares might
in fact be USDA prime meat.
Sparkling performances against
UCLA and Uncle Sam's tin
soldiers helped to carry this illu
sion. Saturday, however, was
the Big Show, and the checker
board squares failed to win the
blue ribbon. As a matter of fact,
they got eaten alive.
In the final analysis, con
ducted by an independent re
search organization, a great
part of the squares' failure on
Saturday must be attibuted to
their leader, Coach Purina.
Other areas which might have
affected the outcome of the Big
Show were dismissed by the
testing organization. These in
cluded school spirit, team per
fomance, and team spirit. Ac
cording to the testing organiza
tion's report, "Other areas
which might have affected the
outcome of the Big Show were
found to be statistically corre
lated to the performance of
Coach Purina."
Very Interesting
The testing organization's re
port continues, "An interesting
correlation which appeared while
computing data on the Big
Show indicates Coach Purina's
unfailing ability to take really
good round football playes and
make squares out of them. The
result of this squaring function
is eleven mediocre squares.
(Mediocre squares often re
semble three-dimensional rec
tangles,)"
The testing organization's re
port concludes, "According to
the results of our study, we feel
that the best way to insure vic
tory of the Big Show in future
years, and in addition, victory
in all the little shows leading
up to the Big Show, is to re
place Coach Purina."
Now that may sound a little
strong to some people, espe
cially to Coach Purina, but
them's the berries. At the Farm,
it's performance that counts,
and Coach Purina has just had
too many losing efforts. The
eleven checkerboard squares
have made valiant efforts to

ward off his axing, but now the
time has come, and the axe
must descend.
Every indication shows that
Purina must go. His ratings are
lower than ever, and his shows
just aren't selling the product.
Everyone knows what the re
sult of failing to sell the pro
duct is. That's right—the pink
slip.
It may sound cruel, but I
have to agree with the testing
organization's report. Every
body was up for the Big Show.
Spirit was at an all-time high.
The Axe was back where it be
longed, although whether or not
Dick Roth should have been
holding it is another question.
The whistle blew, the judges

judged, the squares and the
bears performed, and the
squares lost.
Now the home company is
put in a vey delicate position.
They don't like to fire people,
even people who don't perform
too well.
Well, Obviously ...
They know however, that Pur
ina should go. They know that
if they ever want to see the
Really Big Show again, they
can't stay with mediocrity. Yet
they can't bring themselves to
dump someone out in the cold.
The solution is obvious.
Coach Purina should resign.
The home company would be so
thankful that they would prob
ably announce that he did in

fact fit the Golden Coolie Boot
and make him President. Then
he could hire the new coach.
With the approval of the Trusty
bordal, of course.
Everyone would be happy—
The Home Company, the alumni
of the Home Company, and
Coach Purina himself.

Now that may sound a little
strong to some people, espe
cially to Coach Purina, but
them's the berries. At the Farm,
it's performance that counts,
and Coach Purina has just had
too many losing efforts. The
eleven checkerboard squares
have made valiant efforts to

ward off his axing, but now the
time has come, and the axe
must descend.
Every indication shows that
Purina must go. His ratings are
lower than ever, and his shows
just aren't selling the product.
Everyone knows what the re
sult of failing to sell the pro
duct is. That's right—the pink
slip.
It may sound cruel, but I
have to agree with the testing
organization's report. Every
body was up for the Big Show.
Spirit was at an all-time high.
The Axe was back where it be
longed, although whether or not
Dick Roth should have been
holding it is another question.
The whistle blew, the judges

judged, the squares and the
bears performed, and the
squares lost.
Now the home company is
put in a vey delicate position.
They don't like to fire people,
even people who don't perform
too well.
Well, Obviously ...
They know however, that Pur
ina should go. They know that
if they ever want to see the
Really Big Show again, they
can't stay with mediocrity. Yet
they can't bring themselves to
dump someone out in the cold.
The solution is obvious.
Coach Purina should resign.
The home company would be so
thankful that they would prob
ably announce that he did in

fact fit the Golden Coolie Boot
and make him President. Then
he could hire the new coach.
With the approval of the Trusty
bordal, of course.
Everyone would be happy—
The Home Company, the alumni
of the Home Company, and
Coach Purina himself.
Although they have been try
ing to hide it all season, Coach
Purina and his eleven checker
board squares indicated this
past Saturday that they are
really little more than bear
food.
For a while it appeared that
the checkerboard squares might
in fact be USDA prime meat.
Sparkling performances against
UCLA and Uncle Sam's tin
soldiers helped to carry this illu
sion. Saturday, however, was
the Big Show, and the checker
board squares failed to win the
blue ribbon. As a matter of fact,
they got eaten alive.
In the final analysis, con
ducted by an independent re
search organization, a great
part of the squares' failure on
Saturday must be attibuted to
their leader, Coach Purina.
Other areas which might have
affected the outcome of the Big
Show were dismissed by the
testing organization. These in
cluded school spirit, team per
fomance, and team spirit. Ac
cording to the testing organiza
tion's report, "Other areas
which might have affected the
outcome of the Big Show were
found to be statistically corre
lated to the performance of
Coach Purina."
Very Interesting
The testing organization's re
port continues, "An interesting
correlation which appeared while
computing data on the Big
Show indicates Coach Purina's
unfailing ability to take really
good round football playes and
make squares out of them. The

is eleven mediocre squares.
