## White Justice For Ronnie Hall 
### Louis Knowles 
The colonial status of the
black community fosters racial
oppression not only by police on
the streets but also in the courts
of law. Traditional ideas of
equal treatment and a fair hear
ing fall apart in the face of the
racial barrier which is never
more obvious than when a black
defendant stands in a court with
a white judge, jury, and law
yers.
Residents of East Palo Alto
that are accused of crimes must
face trial in the county courts in
Redwood City. That is where
Ronnie Hall found himself last
week. He was charged with as
saulting a white officer with a
deadly weapon during the dis
turbances in East Palo Alto on
the night of July 30.
The prosecution had one im
portant witness: Deputy Holt
who was struck in the face with
a brick while sitting in his pa
trol car at Jack Farrell Park
that evening. Holt testified that
he shot twice out of his car
window after being struck, once
at his once into
the park which was full of peo
ple.
Later that evening Ronnie
Hall was arrested when he was

found lying on a sidewalk near
the scene of the incident with a
bullet wound in his leg.
Deputy Holt cannot identify
his assailant. He only knows he
was wearing a light-colored,
long-sleeved shirt. The case
against Ronnie Hall hangs chief
ly on Holt's conviction that his
second shot was fired into an
area of the park that was un
occupied at the moment. This
would mean that anyone found
wounded would have had to have
been struck by the first bullet
which Holt fired at his assailant.
And Ronnie Hall was the only
person found shot that evening.
Defense attorney Keogh es
tablished that Ronnie Hall was
wearing a dark-colored, short
sleeved shirt that night. He dem
onstrated that the area into
which Holt fired his second shot
lacks any significant illumina
tion, so that it is highly doubt
ful if Holt could really tell if
anyone was there.
Keogh produced several eye
witnesses who testified that Ron
nie Hall did not throw the brick.
Finally the defense established
that another young man was hit
by one of Holt's bullets, thus de
stroying the chief piece of cir
cumstantial logic.

It would seem on the face of
it that Ronnie Hall's defense
was impervious. One wonders
why the D.A. went to the trou
ble of prosecuting on such flim
sy evidence. Could it be that the
sheriff demands retribution at
the expense of justice?
But the defense case had a
flaw: all its key witnesses were
black. The prosecutor in his
cross-examination repeated
ly emphasized the hostility of
the crowd in the park toward
Holt although it had no direct
relevance to the case.
The judge at one point threat
ened to remove two of the black
witnesses who were sitting in
the court room for shaking- their
heads during some of Holt's tes
timony.
The story of one white police
man was set against the testi
mony of several black young
people for the consideration of a
jury of eleven whites and one
black person. Eight jury mem
bers believed the defense, but
the other four would not acquit
and a mistrial was declared.
Ronnie Hall will face trial again
in February. The sworn testi
mony of black people is not
enough.

which Holt fired his second shot
lacks any significant illumina
tion, so that it is highly doubt
ful if Holt could really tell if
anyone was there.
Keogh produced several eye
witnesses who testified that Ron
nie Hall did not throw the brick.
Finally the defense established
that another young man was hit
by one of Holt's bullets, thus de
stroying the chief piece of cir
cumstantial logic.

It would seem on the face of
it that Ronnie Hall's defense
was impervious. One wonders
why the D.A. went to the trou
ble of prosecuting on such flim
sy evidence. Could it be that the
sheriff demands retribution at
the expense of justice?
But the defense case had a
flaw: all its key witnesses were
black. The prosecutor in his
cross-examination repeated
ly emphasized the hostility of
the crowd in the park toward
Holt although it had no direct
relevance to the case.
The judge at one point threat
ened to remove two of the black
witnesses who were sitting in
the court room for shaking- their
heads during some of Holt's tes
timony.
The story of one white police
man was set against the testi
mony of several black young
people for the consideration of a
jury of eleven whites and one
black person. Eight jury mem
bers believed the defense, but
the other four would not acquit
and a mistrial was declared.
Ronnie Hall will face trial again
in February. The sworn testi
mony of black people is not
enough.
The colonial status of the
black community fosters racial
oppression not only by police on
the streets but also in the courts
of law. Traditional ideas of
equal treatment and a fair hear
ing fall apart in the face of the
racial barrier which is never
more obvious than when a black
defendant stands in a court with
a white judge, jury, and law
yers.
Residents of East Palo Alto
that are accused of crimes must
face trial in the county courts in
Redwood City. That is where
Ronnie Hall found himself last
week. He was charged with as
saulting a white officer with a
deadly weapon during the dis
turbances in East Palo Alto on
the night of July 30.
The prosecution had one im
portant witness: Deputy Holt
who was struck in the face with
a brick while sitting in his pa
trol car at Jack Farrell Park
that evening. Holt testified that
he shot twice out of his car
window after being struck, once
at his once into
the park which was full of peo
ple.
Later that evening Ronnie
Hall was arrested when he was

found lying on a sidewalk near
the scene of the incident with a
bullet wound in his leg.
Deputy Holt cannot identify
his assailant. He only knows he
was wearing a light-colored,
long-sleeved shirt. The case
against Ronnie Hall hangs chief
ly on Holt's conviction that his
second shot was fired into an
area of the park that was un
occupied at the moment. This
would mean that anyone found
wounded would have had to have
been struck by the first bullet
which Holt fired at his assailant.
And Ronnie Hall was the only
person found shot that evening.
Defense attorney Keogh es
tablished that Ronnie Hall was
wearing a dark-colored, short
sleeved shirt that night. He dem

ful if Holt could really tell if
