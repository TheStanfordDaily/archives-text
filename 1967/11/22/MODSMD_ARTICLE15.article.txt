# SES Paper Ignores Humanity
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
The failure of the SES paper on under
graduate education lies not in what the
committee proposes, for almost all of its
suggestions are major advances, but rather
in the committee's inability to respond fully
to the contemporary situation.
What profiteth a university a more liber
al General Studies and an Experimental
College if the fundamental problem of our
time remains ignored?
The problem, said Dean Davie Napier in
his Pre-Reg talk last September, "is a prob
lem of humanity, the recovery of the real
image of man from all the culturesponsored
distoritions of the image of man. The prob
lem is to be a person."
This problem "is single and immense; and
so pointed and critical and now so pervasive
that nobody can afford to put it aside, to
'leave it there' in suspension, to put it on
'hold' for a few years or even a few days.
Rework Paper
The SES paper gives no evidence that this
problem has yet been recognized, let alone
put in suspension. The significance of this
ignorance is that when additional aspects
of the same situation (here education) are
considered, not only is the perspective
broadened, but also the old aspects are put
in a new context. That is to say, were the
Study to seriously consider the problem of
being human, the whole position paper
would have to be reworked.
The authors of the paper may disagree
and claim that they do speak of being hu
man; after all, the third aim of undergrad
uate education listed in the paper is: "to
enhance the capacity to relate knowledge
to personal awareness and public values."
But where in the paper is this aim de
veloped? I would suggest that far from
being developed, it is ignored and that the
proposed educational structure which re
sults actually works counter to making stu
dents human.
Student-Subject Emphasis
For example, the section "the character
istics of students" suggests that the re
sources of the university will be employed
to aid a student's self-development. But the
characteristics of development that the pa

per lists are fostered by contact between
people, and the rest of the paper focuses not
on student contact with people but on stu
dent contact with subject.
More importantly, however, the descrip
tion of development is hardly exhaustive.
One might say even that it focuses on less
than- central aspects of development. The
paper mentions "the determination of goals
and values, and discovery of likes and abili
ties, (and) the establishment of habits of
thinking which will endure a lifetime."
What about self-awareness, openness,
trust, sensitivity, creativity? These are
characteristics that serve primarily to aid
human intercourse; the qualities mentioned
In the paper bear no necessary connection
to a person's relating to others.
Knowledge For Knowledge
In the section on "a revised structure for
undergraduate education," the paper men
tions the demands ofthe coming decades
on the intellectual, scientific, and technologi
cal communities for solutions to problems
generated by massive change. The paper's
response is to suggest that education be
structured in ways to equip "the individual
to continue the pursuit of knowledge."
But the greatest challenge facing us lies
in just the opposite direction. We have fo
cused too long on knowledge, and on tech
nique; the time has come to recognize the
effects that focus has on us and to shift our
attention to more human ends.
The basic question that underlies the pre
vailing mode of society and that of the SES
paper is How To. In the words of Michael
Novak speaking at Class Day last June,
"the assumption behind the phrase 'How
To' is that knowledge is power, and that
man is an instrument of that most impor
tant of our products, progress." Thus the
outlook which produces How To as its most
important question is an instrumental out
look. It conceives of man as a machine, a
tool, but it ignores any qualities in him
which are distinctly human.
Being Human
But we need today to give our primary
attention not to the instruments of change,
including well-trained minds, but rather to

the qualities of being human. We need to
ask, in Novak's words, the question Who?
Man's self-understanding determines his
mode of acting. Seeing himself as a ma
chine, he attempts to change things through
external means, through manipulation. This
is inadequately human and, in the end, des
tructive of human life.
Change, as Charles Malik wrote in the
Saturday Review (August 6, 1966), "only
touches the less important, the form and
the circumstances, the setting and surround
ing, the instruments and conditionsâ€”never
the heart and essence, never the grounds
of sorrow and joy, of ecstacy and fullfill
ment."
Modes Of Relating
The real problems today are not material
and economic, but social, intellectual, and
spiritual. And therefore we cannot be satis
fied with relating ourselves to people only
externally and mechanically. We must seek
human, personal modes of relating. We
need contact,... a passion for the intimate,
... gentleness,... 10ve,... the joy of being."
These are gifts of the spirit
They are attitudes of the soul "which
even the cleanest neighborhood, the most
wholesome school surroundings, . . . the
most prosperous economy,... even the
greatest of Great Societies, cannot by them
selves ensure. The gifts of the spirit have
an independent origin. They pass from per
son to person and where there is no person
who has them, then they simply cannot be
had."
The SES paper looks toward a university
which produces man capable of bringing
about change, external and instrumental.
But when that change is brought about, who
will be there to celebrate it?
In the end, the judgment that Robert
McAfee Brown made of the Second Vatican
Council may have to be applied to the
Study. "If we measure the Council's
achievements against where the church
was five years ago," he wrote in his recent
book The Ecumenical Revolution, "the ad
vance is phenomenal. But if we measure
them against where the church must be
five years henc,e the surface has only been
scratched."
