# Are Athletics Out Of Place At Stanford?
## 
### NICK SELBY 
A student-athlete at Harvard
recently was confronted by an
other student who criticized him
severely for his interest in foot
ball.
"You have a right to your
opinion," answered the athlete,
"but I'd like to break you in
half."
The story was told Monday
night when six athletes and for
mer athletes at Stanford gath
ered in Junipero lounge to talk
about their experiences as ath
letes on the Farm.
What was scheduled to be a
discussion about the problems
of athletes turned into a discus
sion about the more fundamen
tal problems of athletics in the
university.
The questions raised were ex
actly the same considerations
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) subcommittee on
athletics will study when it be
gins formal discussions with
members of the Stanford ath
letic community next quarter.
Two Members Present
In fact, two members of that
SES subcommittee, Joseph Hig
gins and Dr. Lucio Ruotolo,
were present and took active
parts in the discussion.
Higgins is the director of Wil
bur Hall and Dr. Ruotolo, an as
sociate professor of English,
serves on two University com
mittees on athletics.
The major concern of the
discussion, the gulf between
athletes and non-athletes, was
brought up by Dell Martin, a
senior Wilbur sponsor who ran
track for Stanford until his ju
nior year, when he decided to
run for the Santa Clara Youth
Village team because of personal
disputes with head coach Pay
ton Jordan.
Martin suggested that the ma
jor concern of athletic coaches
at Stanford was only whether
or not a student remained eligi
ble for competition. This empha
sis on eligibility instead of on
what the student-athlete was
actually learning, he charged,
led to a "massive anti-intellec
tualism" and fear of academic
matters among people in the
Athletic Department.
Martin was supported in his
claim by Gary Petersmeyer, who
is one of the basketball co-cap
tains for this season. Peters
meyer said that not only was
there an anti-intellectualism in
the athletic department, but
there was an anti-athletics feel
ing among a large part of the
student body.

Joe Neil, a former sponsor and
football player at Stanford, and
presently an assistant football
coach while in medical school
at Stanford, complained that he
was "typed as a jock," by a
large number of students who
had never actually talked with
him.
Petersmeyer added, "People
have a basic tendency to categor
ize, but I do feel the athletic de
partment did help to set up the
gulf. I can't absolve it for that,
but I also can't absolve others
who persist in their categoriza
tions.
Heavy Time Demands
A major factor in setting up
the gulf is the amount of time
required to compete successfully
at Stanford. Petersmeyer said
that he spent six months playing
basketball, with at least three
hours a day of practice. The
time required necessarily means

that athletes will see other ath
letes much more often than
other studen t.s.
Dr. Ruotolo said there was a
feeling on the SES subcommit
tee that the time required cre
ated an erriphasis on athletics
that interfered with the academ
ic interests of the student.
But Peterijmeyer and Dave
Nelson, a V/ilbur sponsor who
played varsi t;y football for three
years, claimuxl that many stu
dents are able to both compete
and study a s well. At this point,
someone in the audience ques
tioned whet her standards of the
University sshould be set for the
exceptional student, who, like
Nelson, can do both.
The probl c»m of setting a stan
dard which compromises athlet
ics and academics, will be one
of the challo.nges to SES.
This problem, Nelson main
tained, is al roady solved because
a "real choicre exists" for every

individual. He added that Stan
ford is perhaps the one major
university in the country that
does offer excellent academics
and athletics. He feels it is a
major factor in high school stu
dents' decisions to come to Stan
ford.
The amount of time required
for Stanford students to compete
successfully is largely controlled
by the teams they compete
against. Pacific-8 squads are na
tionally ranked in all sports. Is
Stanford controlled by its com
petition? Should Stanford begin
to talk about lower levels of
competition? These also will be
major questions for the SES
subcommittee.
Pressure to Win
The high level of competition
brought up the question of pres
sure on coaches to win. This
pressure, Martin maintained,
forced coaches to consider the
well-being of their athletes be
hind considerations of winning.
But the athletes maintained
that there was no coercion on
the part of coaches. The prob
lem, as Joe Neil explained, was
a conflict between the personal
interests of the athlete and the
greater interests of the team.
Personal interests of the ath
lete form a large part of the
athletes' responses to the ques
tion, "What is the value of inter
collegiate athletics in higher
education?" Dick Ragsdale, cap
tain of the Stanford football
team several years ago, stated
that personal friendships he de
veloped made the experience ex
tremely valuable.
Martin questioned whether the
friendships developed because of
the present set-up of athletics
at Stanford or in spite of it.
"Is it friendship or conformity?"
he asked.
Malcolm Snyder, a Wilbur
sponsor and tackle on this year's
football team, answered that
there was no coercion to be ex
tremely good friends with team
mates. But the specific question
of "because of or in spite of"
was not answered.
Perhaps the major achieve
ment of the discussion was that
it brought up the questions SES
will consider in the informal
context of a Wilbur discussion.
Everyone at the meeting warned
that no group could study athle -
tics unless it avoided the irra
tionalism which has surrounded
former attacks and defenses of
athletics.
