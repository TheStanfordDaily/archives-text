# Tired Of Talk
## Miles Students Want Power 
### 
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (CPS)
â€”Students at Miles College
have been talking with admin
istrators for three years about
obtaining more power and re
sponsibility in the decisions
which affect their education,
and they are tired of waiting.
The Student Government As
sociation has decided that stu
dents* at this predominately
Negro institution should quit
talking and turn to "more milit
ant action" if the administra
tion does not act soon to give
students a significant amount of
influence in running the school.
Just to show that they mean
business this time, about 600
students attempted to literally
close down the school recently.
Students staged sit-ins in front
of the major buildings on cam
pus and blocked trucks and cars
from entering the campus.
Although the demonstration
lasted only one day, student
leaders think it was "totally
successful." Ronald Jackson,
student government vice presi
dent, said there is "a new feel
ing of communication on cam
pus" and there are new indi
cations that some of the student
demands may be accepted by
the administration.
Backfire Possible
Nevertheless, the demonstra
tion may still backfire for the

students. About 40 leaders of
the protest, including Jackson
and Student Government presi
dent Clarence Wrencher, have
received summons to appear be
fore the Disciplinary Commit
tee. They fear that they may
face expulsion, disciplinary pro
bation, or suspension.
In addition, several athletes
who participated in the demon
stration were told that they
may lose their scholarships.
If any of the protesters are
punished, the student reaction
is expected to be severe, espe
cially in light of the behavior
of some faculty members dur
ing the demonstration. Jackson
said the students were "com
pletely non-violent," but that
"two or three faculty members
went home and got guns and
came back to intimidate the
demonstrators." The weapons
were not fired.
Student Power Wanted
Jackson said, "All we want is
student power, a voice in aca
demic and administrative poli
cies which affect students."
Specifically, the students are de
manding the abolishment of the
Disciplinary Committee to be re
placed by an all-student court;
a teacher evaluation program;
representation on major admin
istrative committees; and cur
riculum changes in the social

science department, including
more Negro history courses and
a course in African culture.
Students also are upset by
other things. "They charge us
$2.50 for a medical fee, and you
can't even get an aspirin on
campus," one student said. An
other student leader said the
official campus newspaper has
not published an edition in two
years because the administra
tion has not provided the
money. Another campus news
paper has published only two
editions in the last two years.
Before the demonstration, the
administration had made no
concessions to the students,
Jackson said. "There's a credi
bility gap on our campus. It
comes down to the difference be
tween talk and action. We were
demanding the same things
three years ago, and no action
has been taken."
The student leaders are not
sure what they will do next if
their demands continue to be
ignored. They are waiting to see
if the Disciplinary Committee
takes any action against them.
But one thing is sure, Jackson
said. "If the administration
doesn't come around, we will
think of some new methods to
ameliorate the conditions of stu
dents on our campus."
