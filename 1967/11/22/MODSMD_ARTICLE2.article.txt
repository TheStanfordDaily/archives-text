# Legislature Ends Tie To Interim Judiciary
## 
### 
The student legislature last
night withdrew recognition of
the all-faculty Interim Judicial
Board (IJB) an appellate body
over the student Judicial Coun
cil.
Simultaneously, the legisla
ture declared "Violations of Uni
versity policies and regulations
are not per se violations of the
Fundamental Standard."
The actions were contained in
a single amendment to the

ASSU by-laws and followed
Judicial Council's refusal to try
10 students charged with violat
ing University regulations on
campus demonstration.
Supporters of the section with
drawing the recognition of the
IJB argued that the IJB's exis
tence was not in accord with
ASSU by-laws and denied stu
dents the right to be heard by a
student-faculty appellate body.
The IJB was set up under the

Judicial Competence Bill of
1965, which stated that appellate
jurisdiction would be vested in
a permanent board comprised of
both faculty and students.
The IJB was to act as a tem
porary body until the Commit
tee of Fifteen could define the
student-faculty appeals board.
This student-faculty board was
never established because dis
agreements about how the stu
dent members were to be chosen.
Unresolved, however, was the
question of whether Judicial
Council must hear cases of Uni
versity policy violations which
are not Fundamental Standard
violations.
LIB Contradicted
Council Chairman John Ras
kin, in a letter Monday to Dean
of Students Joel Smith, said it
will not, thus contradicting an
IJB ruling of last spring.
In other action, the legisla
ture approved a $550 additional
grant for three foreign ex
change students presently at
Stanford. The legislature also
approved a resolution stating
the intention to approve $4653
for lIR exchange programs next
year.
Just before the meeting ad
journed, Black Student Union
member Johnie Scott addressed
the body on the controversy con
cerning the appointment of
black student Joseph Goone to
the Committee of 15.
Scott claimed the critics of
the appointment, not those who
favored it, were the ones talk
ing about selection solely on the
basis of skin color. He further
stated "Joseph Goone was our
particular nominee because in
many respects he exemplifies
not just the so-called bright
black child."
"He is also articulate and
angry ... at the system which
can make the following state
ment true for a great many of
us among the relatively few on
campus: 'It's hard to be a stu
dent when you can't function
as one.' "
