# Stanford Work Described
## Making Computers Think 
### 
Computer experts hate to
hear their machines called "elec
tronic brains" because they say,
a computer can't think. It can
only do what its human "pro
grammer" tells it to.
But they may have to get
used to it if computer scientists
at Stanford and a few other re
search centers succeed in mak
ing the complex machines "do
intellectual work" as described
by Prof. John McCarthy in the
University's 1967-68 Annual Fi
nancial Report.
As principal investigator for
the Computer Science Depart
ment's Artificial Intelligence
Project, Prof. McCarthy points
out that computers now are of
limited usefulness. "Present
computer programs are not

really intelligent and have very
limited ability to recognize pat
terns," he said.
"For example, no one has yet
written a computer program
capable of identifying people in
a picture—something a child
can do readily. Although hu
mans are able to perform such
tasks without effort, we don't
fully know how to specify such
tasks as a precise sequence of
steps to be carried out by a
computer."
His description of a "hand
eye" research project is a good
illustration of the enormous
complications presented in at
tempting to computerize a sim
ple task. The hand-eye research
involves a mechanical arm and
hand linked by computer to a
TV camera. The first objective
to to get them to work together
to stack blocks, as a two-year
old might. Later, more difficult
tasks can be undertaken.
"One of the first programs
to be written using the camera,"
said Prof. McCarthy, "locates
cube-shaped blocks by starting
at the bottom of the (TV) pic
ture and examining each hori
zontal line to a point at a time
until it finds a light spot. If the
computer reads the full field of
view, it will receive 333 times
250, or 83,250 numbers, each of
which gives the light intensity
in one direction from the cam
era. The problem is to reduce
this huge mass of information
into a few essential statements.
Such a description of the scene
can be used by (another) pro
gram that finds blocks and
stacks them with the aid of

(the) artificial arm and hand.
"All this is just a first step
toward a long range goal of be
ing able to make computers do
useful work," said the Stanford
scientist. "Through this process
we envisage computers perform
ing such tasks as driving cars
and automatically constructing
houses. The results . . . could
be useful in probing space, in
cluding the exploration of
Mars."
Other thinking tasks the
Stanford researchers are prod
ding computers to do include
chess-playing, speech recogni
tion, and a "Heuristic Dendral
program" aimed at better un
derstanding of the hypothesis
forming process of human
thought.
"We write chess programs,"
said Prof. McCarthy, "not be
cause it is important that com
puters play good chess, but be
cause chess provides a good
means for comparing our ideas

about the processes of intelli
gence with human performance.
"While the machine can look
at several thousand positions in
choosing its move—many times
as many as a human examines
—it wastes most of this effort
in examining positions which a
human does not bother with for
various reasons. Our new pro
gram will contain several
strategies intended to reduce
the amount of waste motion."
There is no way to speak
or write to a computer, he said,
except by punched cards or tele
typed symbols. In this research
the computer's "ear" is a micro
phone. It picks up air pressure
changes that the computer re
cords at the rate of 20,000 per
second.
"Although our work in the
artificial intelligence laboratory
thus far has been exceedingly
complex," Prof. McCarthy con
cluded, "we still are on the
outermost frontier. We have a
long way to go."
