# Doctors Must Use 'Scientific Method'
## 
### 
The physician who substitutes
friendliness for knowledge in
treating patients is in reality
denying the critical assistance
patients need, a Stanford physi
cian and medical educator said
recently.
"The average physician of the
future must clearly embody both
characteristics because his
heightened powers will deepen
and make even more important
the relationship between him
and the patient," said Dr. Hal
sted R. Holman.
Dr. Holman, Guggenheim pro
fessor of medicine and head of
the Department of Medicine at
the Medical School, presented
his views in the October issue
of STANFORD M.D., the quar
terly magazine of the Stanford
Medical Alumni Association.
As the complexity of medicine
increases and the intrusion of
technology becomes greater, Dr.
Holman writes, it is common
place for some people to see a
contradiction between science
and medicine and to yearn for
the return to a simpler situation
of nonscientiflc medicine. In par
ticular, science is viewed as be
ing cold and impersonal and the
same characteristics are attrib
uted to scientific medicine.
Because of the rapid evolution
of knowledge, the physician of
the future, according to Dr. Hol
man "must be able to compre
hend and interpret scientific ad
vance as it occurs, reorganize
his concepts of medicine, and
institute new practices in caring
for the patient virtually contin
uously." Dr. Holman cites these
examples:
—There are now drugs which
affect the function of the brain,
though physicians barely under
stand their mechanism of ac
tion. Physicians are able, how
ever, to study brain function at

the cellular level. It is possible
that in a short time physicians
will possess substantial capacity
to alter brain function directly.
—Transplantation of organs
has long been technically feasi
ble. It is probable that physi
cians will soon be able to inhibit
the immune response of a po
tential recipient solely to the
transplantation antigens of the
potential donor and consequent
ly be able to graft organs which
are not rejected.
—Physicians, through use of
miniaturized sensing devices and
computation techniques, can
now make exquisite physiologi
cal measurements on man. They
are no longer, therefore, at the
mercy of nature in dealing with
the individual in shock or in
whom a major organ such as
the heart or lung has been tem
porarily incapacitated. It is pos
sible now to monitor such pa
tients precisely, determine in
stantly the effects of drugs, and
permit recovery in a way hither
to impossible. But very sophisti
cated knowledge is required of
the physician who wishes to ac
complish this end.
—It is now clear that certain
hormones act by influencing the
expression of genes within the
cell. It will not be long presum
ably until physicians can mimic
nature and perhaps suppress or
activate certain types of genes
at will, resulting in substantial
changes in the body of the pa
tient.
—In the future, the treatment
of malignancies may not be re
stricted to radiotherapy or ex
tirpation but may involve the
use of chemicals which will al
ter the growth patterns of cells
and hence, properly used, cor
rect the uncontrolled growth of
the malignant tissue.
