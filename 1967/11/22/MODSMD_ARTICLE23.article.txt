# Soccer At Stanford-Stabbed In The Back?
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Four years ago, Stanford's
soccer team was good enough to
go to the NCAA semifinals. This
year the team finished with a
jsmal 3-5-2, its first losing sea
son in 16 years that Fred Prid
dle has coached the team.
Most fans of a sport would be
more than satisfied to see a
team go 16 years without a los
ing season and would forgive
the coach for an off year.
But that is not the case at
Stanford, where criticism from
outsiders and team members
alike against Priddle and the
Athletic Department has now
reached a crescendo.
The amazing thing about the
criticism was its sourceâ€”most
y it came from Sam Stevens, a
former star Indian soccer player
who now works at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC).

Stevens came to this reporter
at the end of spring quarter in
the last academic year and
asked me to do a series of ar
ticles exposing the "who-cares
about-soccer" attitude of the
Athletic Department.
Stevens claimed then that the
Athletic Department refused to
support Stanford soccer with
adequate practice fields, ade
quate equipment, and sufficient
funds for the coaches.
When time problems prevent
ed such a series, Stevens asked
a friend to write a letter to The
Daily mentioning these griev
ances. (The letter, which ap
peared May 24, 1967, was signed
by Mark D. Lester.)
When fall quarter began, Ste
vens again contacted this re
porter about doing a series. He
said that to help me gather ma
terial, he would collect several
soccer players to speak about

their grievances.
Attack Switches
In two meetings this fall, the
attack against the Athletic De
partment switched over to an at
tack against Priddle. At first,
players complained that the
freshman football team was in
truding onto its field.
Director of Athletics Chuck
Taylor and Priddle both ex
plained that a shortage of fields
existed due to construction of
the new pavillion. Priddle said
that the two teams managed to
share it with no bad effects.
Next the players complained
that the Athletic Department
didn't care about what happened
to the soccer team. They pointed
to the fact that Priddle, who is
the head University gardener,
receives little compensation for
his services as coach.
Can't Buy Success
Taylor explained first that not
every sport could be related to
football, which receives the
largest allotment for salaries
and equipment. And he said,
"You can't buy success by pay
ing coaches large amounts of

money." Taylor felt that Priddle
was doing a satisfactory job as
coach in view of his long rec
ord.
Many people, both on and off
the soccer team, have said that
Priddle's efforts have been the
only force allowing soccer to
survive at Stanford. But Taylor
explained that if Priddle had
quit, he would have "found
someone" to do the job and that
soccer would have survived.
Freshmen Complain
Stevens then brought mem
bers of the freshman soccer
team, which this year went 5-1,
to complain about Priddle's
coaching techniques.
They mentioned that Priddle
had instilled no discipline on the
varsity and that he was unable
to conduct practices successfully
without scrimmaging daily,
thereby neglecting the impor
tant wind sprints and skill
drills.
"He simply isn't the ball of
fire he should be," said one for
mer player, and that sentiment
was seconded with a "in fact,
he's much less than that." That

sentiment against Priddle exists
among both players and active
players became an established
fact.
Split Develops
Yet another important fact
was established at the same time
by Taylor, who talked to John
Taylor (no relation), the soccer
representative on the Council of
Athletes, about having the cap
tains submit ideas for improv
ing the soccer program. Taylor
never received any letters, how
ever.
John Taylor told the Athletics
Director that a large number of
players actively competing this
season were satisfied with Prid
dle's efforts. A split in the team
seemed to be present.
Priddle Would Quit
As all coaches and fans will
agree, a split in the ranks is
sure to destroy any team. Prid
dle said yesterday that if the
players and the Athletic Depart
ment wanted him to retire, he
would.
He and his assistant, Bill
White, said, "Our sole interest
in 16 years here has been the
students and soccer, making
sure they get a chance to play
and enjoy it."
Priddle also said that he
would stop coaching unasked if
he felt that the freshmen and a
majority of the varsity players

didn't have confidence in his
ability.
The sad part about the criti
cisms is they have come solely
at the urging of Stevens, who
began active criticism last
spring. Both Priddle and White
say they have very good reason
to distrust Stevens' sincerity be
cause of severe personal quar
rels b-'tween them at that time.
(Editor's Note: It should be
made clear at this point that
The Daily is making no com
ment on Stevens' sincerity, but

that Priddle and White are.)
The quarrels, which need not
be examined in detail here, led
to a severe crack in long rela
tions among the three.
That Stevens' actions follow
ing the quarrel led to a spilt In
the team and a drop in the play
ers' confidence in Prlddle is
clear. Was the soccer team
stabbed in the back? The soccer
team's health is badly impaired
and whether a new doctor is
needed is a question the Athletic
Department must answer.
