# Five Murals Sports Keep Spirits High
## 
### JOHN WRIGHT 
The rush and tumult of intra
mural touch football screeched
to a halt last week with the
crowning of Theta Delta Chi as
university champions.
But five other autumn sports,
including golf, tennis doubles,
two-man volleyball, bowling and
billiards, will keep IM enthus
iasm at a peak after Thanks
giving.
The Delts collide with DU
next week in the finals of the
two-man volleyball tournament.
Three teams remain in the
tennis doubles tourney. The
winner of next Monday's
Lambda Nu-Theta Chi match
will flail away against the Neu
trinos for the championship
later in the week.
Jungle Survival Course
Four two-man teams have
survived the jungles and
marshes of the Stanford golf
course to make the semifinals
of the IM golf tournament.
Alpha Biz confronts Beta Biz,
and Whiteacre battles Law I. in
eighteen hole best-ball matches.
The two winners will meet in
the finals sometime before dead
week.

Bowling and billiards will
close out their autumn quarter
schedules next week in the Tre
sidder Games Area.
Nine out of 40 IM bowling
teams are averaging better than
500.
Doug Pirnie of Theta Chi
holds the high three-game series
of 663, while John Steele's 255
is the high game.
Kappa Sig Leading
Kappa Sig leads both the Mon
day and Friday bowling leagues,
with SAE, Alpha Biz, and El
Cap heading the three other
leagues.
Current leaders in the bil
liards leagues include Serra,
Los Arcos, Theta Chi, Lambda
u, Fiji, Dekes, Alpha Biz, ATO,
Neutrinos, and SAE 'B'.
Manager's Meeting
The next IM managers meet
ing will be held Dec. 5 at 4:15
in room 350 of Encina Gym.
A five-member student advis
ory committee will be elected
at that time to assist Intra
mural Director Dutch Fehring.
Fehring also plans to an
nounce the team point totals
for autumn quarter sports at
the meeting.
