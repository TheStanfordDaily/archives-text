LOOKING FOR A SHOT: Senior water polo ace Pete Siebert looks
for a shot against Long Beach State several weeks ago in the Stan
ford pool. Siebert will close out his Card career during the vacation
when Stanford competes in the Nor Cal Open tournament at De
Anz.ii Junior College in Cupertino Friday and Saturday. Competing
in the tournament will be the second, third and fourth ranked teams
in the country — Stanford, Cal. and San Jose in that order. The
giant 20 by 30 yard De Anza pool should be ideal for the Tribe's fast
break.
