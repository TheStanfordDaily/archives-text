# SRT's Season Premiere
## Anouilh's 'The Cavern' Opens Next Week 
### 
A play that the author, in his
own words, "never succeeded in
writing" will open Stanford Rep
ertory Theater's third season
when Jean Anouilh's "The Cav
ern" makes its West Coast pre
miere in the Little Theater next
Wednesday.
Sirin Devrim, SRT's visiting
director from Istanbul, Turkey,
will direct the production and
also take the role of Marie
Jeanne, the Cook.
The author of 28 full-length
plays, Anouilh is best known in
this country for his "Antigone,"
"Ring Around the Moon," "The
Thieves' Carnival," "Time Re
membered," and "Beckett." Writ
ten in 1961, "The Cavern" was
first produced that year at the
Theatre Montparnasse in Paris,
with the playwright as co-direc
tor. The play has only recently
been translated into English and
will be new to most theater
goers.
'Split-Level' Set
Anouilh's two-level construc
tion is graphically demonstrated
in the "split-level" set designed
by Warren Travis, depicting the
mansion of a French count at

the turn of the century. The
genteel aristocracy inhabits the
upper story in an elegant atmos
phere, while the servants dwell
below in the dank kitchen which
is, in fact, the "cavern."
The struggle between masters
and slaves begins as a detective
story. But the problem of solv
ing a murder is interrupted as
the Author — portrayed by Ger
ald Hiken — appears on stage in
an attempt to control his char
acters. But the author's explana
tion of his frustrations in writ
ing takes second place as the
characters of his own creation
come to dominate the scene and
create for him the play he says
he cannot write.
Class Conflicts
Class conflicts flare as the re
luctant Seminarist, the illegiti
mate son of the Cook and the
Count, is torn between alle
giance to his lowly origins and
his mother's efforts to push him
into the aristocracy via the
priesthood. Juxtaposed to the
Cook is the Countess, who pre
tentiously crosses class lines by
befriending a servant girl. In so
doing, she drives the girl to

prostitution over a life of scrub
bing floors in the "cavern."
Anne Gerety, visiting actress
from Portland, Oregon, will por
tray the Countess. The cast also
includes SRT actors Glenn Can
non as Marcel, the valet; Ste
phen D. Newman as the Semi
narist; Paul E. Richards as the
Superintendent; and William
Sharp as the Count. Costumes
are by Douglas A. Russell.

A MOTHER REBUKES HER SON as Marie Jeanne (Slrin Devrim)
and the Seminarist (Stephen D. Newman) clash in the Stanford
Repertory Theater production of "The Cavern." The newly-trans
lated Anouilh play opens at the Little Theater November 29, Stu
dent tickets are available at Tresidder Union Box Office.
A play that the author, in his
own words, "never succeeded in
writing" will open Stanford Rep
ertory Theater's third season
when Jean Anouilh's "The Cav
ern" makes its West Coast pre
miere in the Little Theater next
Wednesday.
Sirin Devrim, SRT's visiting
director from Istanbul, Turkey,
will direct the production and
also take the role of Marie
Jeanne, the Cook.
The author of 28 full-length
plays, Anouilh is best known in
this country for his "Antigone,"
"Ring Around the Moon," "The
Thieves' Carnival," "Time Re
membered," and "Beckett." Writ
ten in 1961, "The Cavern" was
first produced that year at the
Theatre Montparnasse in Paris,
with the playwright as co-direc
tor. The play has only recently
been translated into English and
will be new to most theater
goers.
'Split-Level' Set
Anouilh's two-level construc
tion is graphically demonstrated
in the "split-level" set designed
by Warren Travis, depicting the
mansion of a French count at

the turn of the century. The
genteel aristocracy inhabits the
upper story in an elegant atmos
phere, while the servants dwell
below in the dank kitchen which
is, in fact, the "cavern."
The struggle between masters
and slaves begins as a detective
story. But the problem of solv
ing a murder is interrupted as
the Author — portrayed by Ger
ald Hiken — appears on stage in
an attempt to control his char
acters. But the author's explana
tion of his frustrations in writ
ing takes second place as the
characters of his own creation
come to dominate the scene and
create for him the play he says
he cannot write.
Class Conflicts
Class conflicts flare as the re
luctant Seminarist, the illegiti
mate son of the Cook and the
Count, is torn between alle
giance to his lowly origins and
his mother's efforts to push him
into the aristocracy via the
priesthood. Juxtaposed to the
Cook is the Countess, who pre
tentiously crosses class lines by
befriending a servant girl. In so
doing, she drives the girl to

prostitution over a life of scrub
bing floors in the "cavern."
Anne Gerety, visiting actress
from Portland, Oregon, will por
tray the Countess. The cast also
includes SRT actors Glenn Can
non as Marcel, the valet; Ste
phen D. Newman as the Semi
narist; Paul E. Richards as the
Superintendent; and William
Sharp as the Count. Costumes
are by Douglas A. Russell.
