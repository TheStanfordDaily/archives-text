# LBJ Finishes 4 Years
## 
### 
Four years ago today, Lyndon
B. Johnson became President of
the United States.
Daily snooper Herbie Hinckes
was asked to make an infallible
prediction as to how many more
years Johnson will hold office.
After a few moments' thought,
he smiled weakly and burst into
tears.
The Associated Press reports
that Johnson is hopeful that his
fortunes finally are on the up
beat after weeks of faltering.
During the past week, John
son has had several psychologi
cal boosts — including a gen
erally favorable reception of his
television-radio news confer

ference Friday—that he natural
ly hopes will augur well.
Now 59, Johson has aged vis
ibly in his four years as Presi
dent. His hair has turned grayer
and the weathered lines in his
face have deepened.
But his personal physician,
Vice Adm. George G. Burkley,
says that since the chief execu
tive's most recent surgery 13
months ago, "the President's
health has been excellent."
Johnson's political health has
not been nearly so robust, how
ever. Just last week the Harris
Public Opinion Poll reported
that public confidence in John
son personally has sagged to a
new low of 23 per cent.
