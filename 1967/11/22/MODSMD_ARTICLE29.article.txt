# Mexican Financial Progress Steady, Says Latin Economist

### JACK KAPLAN 
Mexican economists tend to be
more liberal and less objective
than their American counter
parts.
So said Leopoldo Solis, Direc
tor of Economic Studies at the
Banco de Mexico and Professor
of Economics at Colegio de Mex
ico, in a recent interview. The

Banco de Mexico, "a less inde
pendent version of the U.S. Fed
eral Reserve Bank," works with
the Treasury to determine mone
tary policy.
Solis, a Yale graduate, is cur
rently spending two weeks at
Stanford. He will speak on a
subject about which he has co
authored a book, "Mexican Fi
nancial Development," today at
4 p.m., in Tresidder. An informal
discussion will follow the talk.
Last week he delivered public
lectures on "A Long Run View
of the Economic Development of
Mexico" and "Mexican Land Re
form: Factor Mobility and In
come Distribution."
Solis explained that Mexican
economists have reached virtual
agreement on the desireability
of land reform, social security
and other liberal programs.
He pointed out that the Mexi
can constitution, adopted in 1915,
limits the size of a farm. The
maximum area depends on what
produce is being grown or
raised, but is about 200 acres
for most plots.
Parity Programs
Parity payments for wheat
and other surplus crops form an
other aspect of the Mexican gov
ernment's farm program.
Describing his country's mone
tary policy decisions, Solis
stated, "The Mexican economy
is continually expanding and
never suffers a recession. While
Americans must balance the
problems of unemployment with
the problems of inflation, we
are concerned only with prevent
ing inflation."
"We have kept inflation low
since 1957," he added. "Prices to
day are rising at about two per
cent a year, near the rate in
America. Most people, myself
included, are very satisfied with
our economy's progress.
Inflation Necessary
"Our goal is not to eliminate
inflation entirely. Without some

price rise, economic growth is
impossible."
Commenting on the education
al background of Mexican econ
omists, Solis said that most at
tend graduate school in the U.S.
after receiving undergraduate
training in their own country.
The most widely used introduc
tory textbook is Paul Samuel
son's Economics.
Solis also compared other as
pects of the two societies. He
finds academic freedom quite
liberal in both countries, al
though certain taboos do exist.
Mexican monopolies are pro
portionately more widespread
than American monopolies, he
b linves. However, government
enforced competitive pricing con
trols their influence.
Mexicans are unconcerned
about the PRI party's complete
domination of the country's poli
tics, according to Solis. "There
is considerable democracy with
in the party," he explained.
"Candidates are chosen by rep
resentatives of the three sec
tors: Farmers, Labor and Popu
lar."
Labor Migration
Solis commented on the Labor
Department's excluding most
Mexican farm laborers from
working in California. "More
crops are now being grown in
Mexico as a result of this policy.
The flow of labor to the U.S.
has been replaced by a flow of
capital in the opposite direc
tion."
Solis was more concerned
over the possible repercussions
of proposed tariff hikes. "If
enacted, higher tariffs will sub
stantially reduce exports to the
U. 5.," he stated.
On last week's Congressional
primary in San Mateo County,
Solis expressed satisfaction that
the more liberal Republican can
didate won. He was unsure,
however, about whether actors
and actresses should run for
public office.

The most widely used introduc
tory textbook is Paul Samuel
son's Economics.
Solis also compared other as
pects of the two societies. He
finds academic freedom quite
liberal in both countries, al
though certain taboos do exist.
Mexican monopolies are pro
portionately more widespread
than American monopolies, he
b linves. However, government
enforced competitive pricing con
trols their influence.
Mexicans are unconcerned
about the PRI party's complete
domination of the country's poli
tics, according to Solis. "There
is considerable democracy with
in the party," he explained.
"Candidates are chosen by rep
resentatives of the three sec
tors: Farmers, Labor and Popu
lar."
Labor Migration
Solis commented on the Labor
Department's excluding most
Mexican farm laborers from
working in California. "More
crops are now being grown in
Mexico as a result of this policy.
The flow of labor to the U.S.
has been replaced by a flow of
capital in the opposite direc
tion."
Solis was more concerned
over the possible repercussions
of proposed tariff hikes. "If
enacted, higher tariffs will sub
stantially reduce exports to the
U. 5.," he stated.
On last week's Congressional
primary in San Mateo County,
Solis expressed satisfaction that
the more liberal Republican can
didate won. He was unsure,
however, about whether actors
and actresses should run for
public office.
Mexican economists tend to be
more liberal and less objective
than their American counter
parts.
So said Leopoldo Solis, Direc
tor of Economic Studies at the
Banco de Mexico and Professor
of Economics at Colegio de Mex
ico, in a recent interview. The

Banco de Mexico, "a less inde
pendent version of the U.S. Fed
eral Reserve Bank," works with
the Treasury to determine mone
tary policy.
Solis, a Yale graduate, is cur
rently spending two weeks at
Stanford. He will speak on a
subject about which he has co
authored a book, "Mexican Fi
nancial Development," today at
4 p.m., in Tresidder. An informal
discussion will follow the talk.
Last week he delivered public
lectures on "A Long Run View
of the Economic Development of
Mexico" and "Mexican Land Re
form: Factor Mobility and In
come Distribution."
Solis explained that Mexican
economists have reached virtual
agreement on the desireability
of land reform, social security
and other liberal programs.
He pointed out that the Mexi
can constitution, adopted in 1915,
limits the size of a farm. The
maximum area depends on what
produce is being grown or
raised, but is about 200 acres
for most plots.
Parity Programs
Parity payments for wheat
and other surplus crops form an
other aspect of the Mexican gov
ernment's farm program.
Describing his country's mone
tary policy decisions, Solis
stated, "The Mexican economy
is continually expanding and
never suffers a recession. While
Americans must balance the
problems of unemployment with
the problems of inflation, we
are concerned only with prevent
ing inflation."
"We have kept inflation low
since 1957," he added. "Prices to
day are rising at about two per
cent a year, near the rate in
America. Most people, myself
included, are very satisfied with
our economy's progress.
Inflation Necessary
"Our goal is not to eliminate
inflation entirely. Without some

price rise, economic growth is
impossible."
Commenting on the education
al background of Mexican econ
omists, Solis said that most at
tend graduate school in the U.S.
after receiving undergraduate
training in their own country.
