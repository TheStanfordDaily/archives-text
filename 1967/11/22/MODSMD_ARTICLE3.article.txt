# San Jose Protests Enter Second Day
## 
### 
A crowd of 3,000 protesting
use of napalm in the Viet
nam*. war, demonstrated yester
day for the second straight day
at San Jose State College,
watched closely by police on
guard against any renewal of
violence.
There was a brief melee when
10 members of the Hells Angels
motorcycle club of Daly City
showed up. Police had to sub
due one of them after he be
came belligerent.
A column of demonstrators
marched in an oval near the en
trance of the administration
buildingâ€”the same spot where
blockage of the entrance and the
burning of an effigy of President
Johnson caused police to move
in Monday with tear gas.
Among signs carried were
ones demanding removal from
the campus of a job recruiter
for Dow Chemical Corp., which
manufactures the jellied gaso
line used for burning out the
Viet Cong in jungled sectors of
Vietnam.
Talks Fail
Yesterday's demonstration was
staged despite efforts to avert it
by a forum held in a campus
auditorium the same morning to
air the views of all sides.
The forum ended soon after
it began when five hundred of
the people present walked out
of the auditorium.
During the meeting, Dow
Chemical representative Jack
Jones was handed a two-ques
tion paper by Eric von Muller,
student spokesman for the Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
(SDS), the force behind the anti-
Dow demonstrations.
SDS asked whether Dow
Chemical would cease making
napalm and, if not, would the
job recruiter get off campus.
The walkout began after the
moderator, San Jose Vice Presi

dent William J. Dusel refused,
because of procedural reasons,
to allow the Dow Chemical rep
resentative to answer the ques
tions immediately.
Jones told the audience that
his company refused to be in
timidated in meeting the war
needs and that the job recruiter
was on campus with the permis
sion of the university adminis
tration.
President Walks 9ut
Associated Student Body Pres
ident Vik Lee requested, on be
half of the student body, that
Dow not recruit that day be
cause of the possibility of more
violence.
When Lee was told the re
cruiters would leave only when
requested by the administration,
he also walked out of the forum
saying that he was going to the
administration building to see if
he could prevent a repetition of
Monday's violence.
Despite his efforts, Dow began
recruiting on the San Jose cam
pus at 11 a.m. yesterday, and
the massive demonstration fol
lowed.
Non-violence Urged
At a meeting Monday night,
members of the SDS and an anti
war group of teachers, Profes
sors Against the War, agreed
upon a hard line against Dow
Chemical and an avoidance of
violence.
Others at the meeting charged
the administration with calling
in the police, whose arrival had
sparked the violence. The ad
ministration, however, claims
that the police themselves de
cided to move onto the campus.
Police Chief Ray Blackmore
said he doesn't know who made
the decision.
At the SDS meeting, the stu
dents demanded an investiga
tion to determine who did call in
the police.
