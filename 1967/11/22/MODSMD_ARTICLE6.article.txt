# Phi Psi Actives, Alumni Compromise On Rush
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Phi Kappa Psi, suspended Nov.
9 by the national fraternity,
reached an agreement Monday
night with the national and the
chapter's alumni on a rush pol
icy for this year.
The guideline is a loose one,
however, and "within it, a draw
system is possible," according to
John Noonan, chapter vice presi
dent.
Phi Psi will decide on their
exact selection method next
Tuesday, but fraternity mem
bers have threatened to leave
the house en ntasse both if a
draw system is adopted or if it is
rejected.
Important parts of the pledge
selection agreement are that any
prospective pledge who does not
receive "unanimous approval" of
the brothers will be requested to
withdraw his application, al
though he may request recon
sideration, and that "the active
members of the chapter shall
determine the method of selec
tion," within the fraternity.
The plan was approved at a
meeting of the chapter's alumni
advisory committee Monday
night. Phi Psi Executive Secre
tary, Ralph Daniels, approved
the proposal.
The chapter held a meeting
the same night, and when in
formed of the decision by the
alumni and Daniels, also ap
proved the guidelines.
Smith Wants Consensus
Dean of Students Joel Smith
sent a letter to Phi Psi last
week, stating that he wanted
any decisions as to the future of
the house to be made by a "con
sensus" of the members, includ
ing a consensus of the actives.
He explained "consensus" as
not meaning a majority. Smith
stated that he merely wanted to
assure that there was no "seri
ous opposition from the actives"
to any plan put forth by the
pledges.
Meanwhile, the chapter mem
bers have recovered from the
suspension.
"There were a lot of hard
feelings, but I don't really think
they were warranted," Noonan
said. "The national was only
trying to protect its interests.
We should be off suspension
soon."
"Protecting its interests," Noo
nan explained, was worrying
about the attitude of the pledge
class, which was de-pledged on

orders from the national office.
The national had heard rumors
that the pledge class had been
openly advocating adoption of a
draw system and going local.
Feeling on these issues is
quite varied. Many of the
pledges have said they would
leave the house if a draw is not
approved by the actives. Eight
of the 32 pledges have already
left.
The chapter president, Bill
Holt, feels just the opposite,
however.
Opposed To Draw
"I'm completely opposed to
the draw system," he said. "If
the house goes on a draw sys
tem, I will disaffiliate, not be
cause I dislike the members, but
because I dislike the political
system they choose to live un
der."
He explained his position,
stating, "A form of selective sys
tem should remain within the
house, because from the form of
draw system that this campus
has seen I can only conclude
that a draw is an irresponsible
means of choosing members for
a house."
As for the new rules, Holt
feels they are "fair, because
they allow for variation in the
procedure from year to year."
"But I am against the implica
tion of th& new rules," he con
tinued, "basically because
they're just a groundwork to im
plement a draw system."
Pledges Opposed
Opposed to him are many
pledges, while most of the other
actives are taking a middle
ground.
Tom Lambert is one of the
sophomores strongly in favor of
a draw.
"I'd move out if they kept the
bong," he said. "It's senseless.
The presence of a bong affects
the rushee, changes his behav
ior. He knows if he offends
someone ,he won't get in. It sets
the whole tone of the rush."
Another pledge, Rick Berendt,
had similar opinions, and at
tacked what he feels a selective
rush causes.
"The actions of the national
(in suspending the chapter)
showed its willingness to hide
from any sort of innovation," he
said. "People had better think
seriously about this kind of or
ganization and the society it fos
ters."
"It's a social dinosaur," he

added. "It doesn't deserve to live
any more, because it keeps peo
ple from being people."
Far From Perfect
Holt agrees that fraternities
are far from perfect, but still is
opposed to the draw. "I feel that
the fraternity is based on anti
quated ideals," he said, "but I
would rather see an attempt by
the members of this house and
by the pledge class to reestab
lish a fraternity on the ideals of
the 1960's rather than to go lo
cal, if this is the ultimate end."
Some would prefer a modified
draw. Jim Osborne, house man
ager, is one of these.
"I think all of us are pretty
tired of the whole damn thing,"
he said. "We'll probably adopt
some sort of draw system, hope
fully with enough restrictions to
keep from encouraging a dorm
like atmosphere around here."

But the national decided a
draw system "wasn't within the
spirit of the fraternity," accord
ing to vice-president Noonan.
This may create further con
flict between the chapter and the
national. Another pledge, Jim
Viney, suggested "We shouldn't
be in the national fraternity. It's
purposeless. We get nothing
from it. I feel that in the future
we will be bothered by them, and
it's not worth it."
Bill Evers, also a pledge, felt
that intervention by the nation
al into the problems of the chap
ter cause still greater difficul
ties.
"Until the national inter
vened, we were pretty well go
ing to work it out between the
pledges, the actives and the
alumni. We had been having
meetings between all the
groups," he said.

Meanwhile, the chapter mem
bers have recovered from the
suspension.
"There were a lot of hard
feelings, but I don't really think
they were warranted," Noonan
said. "The national was only
trying to protect its interests.
We should be off suspension
soon."
"Protecting its interests," Noo
nan explained, was worrying
about the attitude of the pledge
class, which was de-pledged on

orders from the national office.
The national had heard rumors
that the pledge class had been
openly advocating adoption of a
draw system and going local.
Feeling on these issues is
quite varied. Many of the
pledges have said they would
leave the house if a draw is not
approved by the actives. Eight
of the 32 pledges have already
left.
The chapter president, Bill
Holt, feels just the opposite,
however.
Opposed To Draw
"I'm completely opposed to
the draw system," he said. "If
the house goes on a draw sys
tem, I will disaffiliate, not be
cause I dislike the members, but
because I dislike the political
system they choose to live un
der."
He explained his position,
stating, "A form of selective sys
tem should remain within the
house, because from the form of
draw system that this campus
has seen I can only conclude
that a draw is an irresponsible
means of choosing members for
a house."
As for the new rules, Holt
feels they are "fair, because
they allow for variation in the
procedure from year to year."
"But I am against the implica
tion of th& new rules," he con
tinued, "basically because
they're just a groundwork to im
plement a draw system."
Pledges Opposed
Opposed to him are many
pledges, while most of the other
actives are taking a middle
ground.
Tom Lambert is one of the
sophomores strongly in favor of
a draw.
"I'd move out if they kept the
bong," he said. "It's senseless.
The presence of a bong affects
the rushee, changes his behav
ior. He knows if he offends
someone ,he won't get in. It sets
the whole tone of the rush."
Another pledge, Rick Berendt,
had similar opinions, and at
tacked what he feels a selective
rush causes.
"The actions of the national
(in suspending the chapter)
showed its willingness to hide
from any sort of innovation," he
said. "People had better think
seriously about this kind of or
ganization and the society it fos
ters."
"It's a social dinosaur," he

added. "It doesn't deserve to live
any more, because it keeps peo
ple from being people."
Far From Perfect
Holt agrees that fraternities
are far from perfect, but still is
opposed to the draw. "I feel that
the fraternity is based on anti
quated ideals," he said, "but I
would rather see an attempt by
the members of this house and
by the pledge class to reestab
lish a fraternity on the ideals of
the 1960's rather than to go lo
cal, if this is the ultimate end."
Some would prefer a modified
draw. Jim Osborne, house man
ager, is one of these.
"I think all of us are pretty
tired of the whole damn thing,"
he said. "We'll probably adopt
some sort of draw system, hope
fully with enough restrictions to
keep from encouraging a dorm
like atmosphere around here."

But the national decided a
draw system "wasn't within the
spirit of the fraternity," accord
ing to vice-president Noonan.
This may create further con
flict between the chapter and the
national. Another pledge, Jim
Viney, suggested "We shouldn't
be in the national fraternity. It's
purposeless. We get nothing
from it. I feel that in the future
we will be bothered by them, and
it's not worth it."
Bill Evers, also a pledge, felt
that intervention by the nation
al into the problems of the chap
ter cause still greater difficul
ties.
"Until the national inter
vened, we were pretty well go
ing to work it out between the
pledges, the actives and the
alumni. We had been having
meetings between all the
groups," he said.
Phi Kappa Psi, suspended Nov.
9 by the national fraternity,
reached an agreement Monday
night with the national and the
chapter's alumni on a rush pol
icy for this year.
The guideline is a loose one,
however, and "within it, a draw
system is possible," according to
John Noonan, chapter vice presi
dent.
Phi Psi will decide on their
exact selection method next
Tuesday, but fraternity mem
bers have threatened to leave
the house en ntasse both if a
draw system is adopted or if it is
rejected.
Important parts of the pledge
selection agreement are that any
prospective pledge who does not
receive "unanimous approval" of
the brothers will be requested to
withdraw his application, al
though he may request recon
sideration, and that "the active
members of the chapter shall
determine the method of selec
tion," within the fraternity.
The plan was approved at a
meeting of the chapter's alumni
advisory committee Monday
night. Phi Psi Executive Secre
tary, Ralph Daniels, approved
the proposal.
The chapter held a meeting
the same night, and when in
formed of the decision by the
alumni and Daniels, also ap
proved the guidelines.

Dean of Students Joel Smith
sent a letter to Phi Psi last
week, stating that he wanted

the house to be made by a "con

Pledges Opposed
Opposed to him are many
pledges, while most of the other
actives are taking a middle
ground.
Tom Lambert is one of the
sophomores strongly in favor of
a draw.
"I'd move out if they kept the
bong," he said. "It's senseless.
The presence of a bong affects
the rushee, changes his behav
ior. He knows if he offends
someone ,he won't get in. It sets
the whole tone of the rush."
Another pledge, Rick Berendt,
had similar opinions, and at
tacked what he feels a selective
rush causes.
"The actions of the national
(in suspending the chapter)
showed its willingness to hide
from any sort of innovation," he
said. "People had better think
seriously about this kind of or
ganization and the society it fos
ters."
"It's a social dinosaur," he

added. "It doesn't deserve to live
any more, because it keeps peo
ple from being people."
Far From Perfect
Holt agrees that fraternities
are far from perfect, but still is
opposed to the draw. "I feel that
the fraternity is based on anti
quated ideals," he said, "but I
would rather see an attempt by
the members of this house and
by the pledge class to reestab
lish a fraternity on the ideals of
the 1960's rather than to go lo
cal, if this is the ultimate end."
Some would prefer a modified
draw. Jim Osborne, house man
ager, is one of these.
"I think all of us are pretty
tired of the whole damn thing,"
he said. "We'll probably adopt
some sort of draw system, hope
fully with enough restrictions to
keep from encouraging a dorm
like atmosphere around here."

But the national decided a
draw system "wasn't within the
spirit of the fraternity," accord
ing to vice-president Noonan.
This may create further con
flict between the chapter and the
national. Another pledge, Jim
Viney, suggested "We shouldn't
be in the national fraternity. It's
purposeless. We get nothing
from it. I feel that in the future
we will be bothered by them, and
it's not worth it."
Bill Evers, also a pledge, felt
that intervention by the nation
al into the problems of the chap
ter cause still greater difficul
ties.
"Until the national inter
vened, we were pretty well go
ing to work it out between the
pledges, the actives and the
alumni. We had been having
meetings between all the
groups," he said.
Phi Kappa Psi, suspended Nov.
9 by the national fraternity,
reached an agreement Monday
night with the national and the
chapter's alumni on a rush pol
icy for this year.
The guideline is a loose one,
however, and "within it, a draw
system is possible," according to
John Noonan, chapter vice presi
dent.
Phi Psi will decide on their
exact selection method next
Tuesday, but fraternity mem
bers have threatened to leave
the house en ntasse both if a
draw system is adopted or if it is
rejected.
Important parts of the pledge
selection agreement are that any
prospective pledge who does not
receive "unanimous approval" of
the brothers will be requested to
withdraw his application, al
though he may request recon
sideration, and that "the active
members of the chapter shall
determine the method of selec
tion," within the fraternity.
The plan was approved at a
meeting of the chapter's alumni
advisory committee Monday
night. Phi Psi Executive Secre
tary, Ralph Daniels, approved
the proposal.
The chapter held a meeting
the same night, and when in
formed of the decision by the
alumni and Daniels, also ap
proved the guidelines.
Smith Wants Consensus
Dean of Students Joel Smith
sent a letter to Phi Psi last
week, stating that he wanted
any decisions as to the future of
the house to be made by a "con
sensus" of the members, includ
ing a consensus of the actives.
He explained "consensus" as
not meaning a majority. Smith
stated that he merely wanted to
assure that there was no "seri
ous opposition from the actives"
to any plan put forth by the
pledges.
Meanwhile, the chapter mem
bers have recovered from the
suspension.
"There were a lot of hard
feelings, but I don't really think
they were warranted," Noonan
said. "The national was only
trying to protect its interests.
We should be off suspension
soon."
"Protecting its interests," Noo
nan explained, was worrying
about the attitude of the pledge
class, which was de-pledged on

orders from the national office.
The national had heard rumors
that the pledge class had been
openly advocating adoption of a
draw system and going local.
Feeling on these issues is
quite varied. Many of the
pledges have said they would
leave the house if a draw is not
approved by the actives. Eight
of the 32 pledges have already
left.
The chapter president, Bill
Holt, feels just the opposite,
however.
Opposed To Draw
"I'm completely opposed to
the draw system," he said. "If
the house goes on a draw sys

cause I dislike the members, but
because I dislike the political

der."
He explained his position,
stating, "A form of selective sys
tem should remain within the
house, because from the form of
draw system that this campus
has seen I can only conclude
that a draw is an irresponsible
means of choosing members for
a house."
As for the new rules, Holt
feels they are "fair, because
they allow for variation in the
procedure from year to year."
"But I am against the implica
tion of th& new rules," he con
tinued, "basically because
they're just a groundwork to im

some sort of draw system, hope
fully with enough restrictions to
keep from encouraging a dorm
like atmosphere around here."

But the national decided a
draw system "wasn't within the
spirit of the fraternity," accord
ing to vice-president Noonan.
This may create further con
flict between the chapter and the
national. Another pledge, Jim
Viney, suggested "We shouldn't
be in the national fraternity. It's
purposeless. We get nothing
from it. I feel that in the future
we will be bothered by them, and
it's not worth it."
Bill Evers, also a pledge, felt
that intervention by the nation
al into the problems of the chap
ter cause still greater difficul
ties.
"Until the national inter
vened, we were pretty well go
ing to work it out between the
pledges, the actives and the
alumni. We had been having
meetings between all the
groups," he said.
