## University-IDA Link Noted 
### MICHAEL MORTON 
It is frequently argued that
universities and the military
don't mix. Despite this, Stan
ford has been affiliated with the
Institute for Defense Analyses
(IDA), a Defense Department
"think-tank," since 1965.
The exact nature of this some
what nebulous relationship, was
described recently by Prof.
Frederick Terman, provost
emeritus and former dean of
the engineering school.
Terman, who has been the
University's representative on
the IDA Board of Trustees since

its inception, explained that no
monoy has ever entered into
Stanford's dealings with the In
stitute, nor have any professors
ever been involved in contract
ual research projects.
Slight Faculty Involvement
One faculty member is cur
rently a member of Jason, one
of IDA'S five divisions; one
other professor was at one time
involved with Jason but is now
a member of the President's
science advisory committee.
Terman emphasized that both
these commitments were purely
personal arrangements on the

part of the individuals con
cerned, and that all work, pri
marily in consulting capacities,
was and is done on the faculty
member's own time.
He added that University pol
icy raises no objection to such
commitments so long as the
work load stays within certain
"ground rules," largely with re
spect to time considerations, de
signed to keep professors from
neglecting their academic func
tions.
Avoids Ivory Tower
Prof. Terman explained con
tinued University affiliation with
IDA primarily in terms of "con
tacts with the outside world"
so as to "know what's going on
on the outside.' He affirmed that
it is "better to be in that situa
tion (membership) than in one
He offered the same explana-
He offered the same evplana
tion as Princeton President Rob
ert F. Goheen with regard to
his university's affiliation with
IDA as a rationale for this in
volvement.
Goheen's statement, on Oct.
31, was in reply to critics of
Princeton's association with the
Institute.
At Princeton there is an IDA
Communications Research Di
vision computer in the univers-*
ity's von Neuman Hall. Nine
physics professors serve as re
searchers on such projects as
"Tactical Nuclear Weapons â€”
Their Battlefield Utility," "In
terdiction of Trucks From the
Air by Night," and "Small Arms
for Counter-Guerilla Opera
tions."
Preserve The Society
His explanation was primar
ily in terms of fulfilling "funda
mental obligations of the uni
versity" which include "not only
the protection and exercise of
academic freedom, but also con
cern for the welfare and secur
ity of the society which permits
academic freedom to flourish
and to flower."
Terman stated that this line
of reasoning was essentially ap

plicable to Stanford's affiliation
with IDA.
He explained that the Insti
tute developed out of a deterior
ating civil service research
group working for the Depart
ment of Defense. In response to
an appeal for help from the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Insti
tute for Defense Analyses was
established. It was designed to
function as a research agency
for the Defense Department,
much as Rand Corp. originally
worked for the Air Force.
Search For Truth
Its primary purpose, accord
ing to Terman, is to "get at the
truth of things." The involve
ment of universities is an "as
surance of intellectual integ
rity," a guarantee that an "in
tellectually honest" operation is
run. He stated that the univers
ity stamp lends an air of hon
esty to the proceedings that can
not be matched by industrial
concerns or government-con
trolled agencies.
A 1965 IDA booklet summar
izes the origin, structure, and
purposes of the Institute. It
was founded in 1956, "to pro
vide the Department of Defense
with scientific studies in na
tional security." The original
member universities were Mass
achusetts Institute of Technol
ogy, California Institute of
Technology, Case Institute of
Technology, Stanford, and Tu
lane.
Since that time additional
sponsors have been admitted:
University of California, Uni
versity of Chicago, Columbia
University, University of Illi
nois, University of Michigan,
Penn State, and Princeton.
The total research budget for
1965 was over $12 million, em
ployed by the Institute's five di
visions: Weapons Systems Eval
uation, Research and Engineer
ing Support, Eeconomic and
Political Studies, Jason (a
group of 44, p'rimarily theoret
ical physicists engaged in a
part-time' consulting capacity),
and Communications Research.
