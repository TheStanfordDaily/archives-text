# Peter Lyman Resigns
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
George Peter Lyman resigned yes
terday as president of the Associated
Students of Stanford University
(ASSU) after three months in office.
In a statement announcing his resig
nation, the 27-year-old graduate stu
dent blasted the ASSU as "a hollow
bureaucratic process" that is "incap
able of representing or contributing to
an intellectual community."
He called for students to "start
thinking about radical change" in stu
dent government, which he found to
be "paper structures" which could not
further his plans for fundamental re
form of education at Stanford.
Lyman's successor as student body
president is Cesare Massarenti, Ly
man's funning mate as ASSU vice
president in the election last May.
Massarenti, a 26-year-old doctoral can
didate in sociology, is an Italian citi
zen and former president of the stu
dent union at the University of Milan.
He is married and has a son. He is
believed to be the first foreign student
ever to be president of Stanford's stu
dent government.
Massarenti, when he learned of the
resignation late last night, said, "The
people have changed, not the ideas.
We ran together." He confirmed that
he would accept the presidency and
Would comment further at a later
time.
Succeeding Massarenti as vice presi
dent is Michael Weinstein, speaker of
the legislature. Weinstein will remain
speaker.
Lyman is the second ASSU presi
dent in a row to suddenly quit his job.
Last March David Harris resigned as
president, stating "I have done all I
am capable of doing for the realiza
tion of education at Stanford." Harris
later dropped out of school. He is now
an organizer of the anti-draft Resist
ance movement.
Lyman's reasons for resigning were
partly personal. He admitted that "I
probably had the wrong temperament
for the job in the first place," and

cited the heavy demands the position
made on his time and energy.
Lyman, a soft-spoken teaching as
sistant, agreed to run for ASSU presi
dent only reluctantly last May. Since
formally taking office in September,
he has frequently expressed his disil
lusionment with the position.
Lyman said he had been thinking of
resigning for several weeks. Resigna
tion was a possibility from the time
he was elected, Lyman said, recalling
the advice of Harris that "when it gets
too deep you can always quit."
Lyman also said he has come to
realize "conflict is the only way stu
dents are going to get anything done"
under the present structure, and that
he is unwilling to promote the conflict
himself.
"Direct conflict is the only way to
impress the people who make deci
sions around here. I campaigned on a
quite different ground. It seemed to
me that in order to get anything done
at this point I'd have to contradict
what I'd run on. I did not run on a
platform of conflict," Lyman said.
In a prepared statement, Lyman

criticized both the ASSU and the
Study of Education at Stanford (SES)
as "incapable of attaining the goals
they proclaim." He expressed disap
pointment at the failure of SES to
favor his "community government"
ideas, which were the core of cam
paign proposals to unite students and
faculty in reform of education.
Another disappointment Lyman
cited was lack of support from stu
dents. 'There's been very little sup
port, very little work," he said yes
terday.
In his statement, he blamed this
"demoralization of large segments of
the student community" on the war in
Vietnam, the draft, and"the inertia of
the government of the University."
In his campaign platform last May
Lyman claimed that ASSU "as it now
exists performs functions largely ir
relevant to student concerns." Yester
day he repeated this theme.
The everyday functions of the
ASSU, such as allocating money, Ly
man said, "could be more properly
done elsewhere." He listed communi
cation with the faculty and adminis

tration and generating new Ideas as
the important functions of a student
organization.
A viable student government at
Stanford, Lyman feels, would have to
have legal and financial independence
from the University. In his statement
yesterday, he pointed out that ASSU
performs functions "granted it by the
Dean of Students."
But Lyman, frustrated in his hopes
for a community senate which would
mix faculty and students, finally de
cided he couldn't achieve his goals as
ASSU president.
"What's important is how you
change things," he said yesterday.
"Somehow I think making new rules
and getting new constitutions and so
on isn't really very important in terms
of changing things.
"I was more interested in the
change that's taking place in people—
in the formation of community—than
in working in student politics. And
when that kind of change is gone, for
one reason or another, there's just no
reason to continue, because I'm not

particularly interested in stu
dent politics."
Lyman proposed no laws to
the student legislature while
president. He did become in
volved in several controversies
with University officials, includ
ing a dispute with Provost Rich
ard Lyman over the mailing of
a letter to freshmen, and dis
agreement with Vice Provost
Herbert Packer over the student
role in SES.
Lyman admitted some frus
tration in his dealings with ad
ministrators, although he found
them "more liberal and pro
gressive than I think ever in the
past — that's because they're
new. They're certainly headed in
the right direction. It's their ac
tions that bother me — I go in
and talk with them and get
agreement, but then I find out
that their decisions are made on
the basis of other priorities —
financial ones, that tend to run
exactly counter to the intellect
ual priorities."
Lyman, a terminal graduate
student in political science from

Lake Oswego, Oregon, hopes
now to find time to complete his
PhD thesis on "The Concept of
Ideology." Explaining that "I
really like teaching," Lyman ex
plained he is looking forward to
spending more time with his
seminar at Grove House, where
he is a tutor.
University administrators ex
pressed puzzlement and disap
pointment at Lyman's resigna
tion.
Provost Richard Lyman, who
is not related to Peter Lyman,
said he was "surprised" that the
resignation would come in the
middle of the process of choos
ing student representatives for
University committees which
formerly had no student mem
bers. Peter Lyman, as ASSU
president, nominated students
for University President Wallace
Sterling to appoint.
"I think that it is important
that there be students on thes3
advisory committees," the pro
vost said. "To the extent that
the resignation delays these ap
pointments, I regret it."
The provost mentioning David

Harris' resignation also, said,
"The lack of continuity in stu
dent government makes it diffi
cult to work with it for any pur
pose."
Joel Smith, dean of students,
had no comment on the resigna
tion.
Legislature speaker Michael
Weinstein, the new acting vice
president, said an election would
be held in winter quarter for the
VP, as provided by the ASSU
constitution.
"While it is regrettable that
Peter Lyman has resigned,"
Weinstein said, "I agree with
him that his action can have con
structive results. His criticisms
of student government are valid.
His inability to carry out his
campaign platform is in a large
part due to the fundamental lack
of power of the ASSU.
"The legisuature's primary
function this year will be to
come up with a suggestion for
community government. If it is
refused, we will have to take
steps to unilaterally secure stu
dent power, possibly by creat

lug a student union that's inde
pendently financed," Weinstein
said.

NEW PRESIDENT — Cesare
Massarenti, the Italian graduate
student who succeeds Lyman.
George Peter Lyman resigned yes
terday as president of the Associated
Students of Stanford University
(ASSU) after three months in office.
In a statement announcing his resig
nation, the 27-year-old graduate stu
dent blasted the ASSU as "a hollow
bureaucratic process" that is "incap
able of representing or contributing to
an intellectual community."
He called for students to "start
thinking about radical change" in stu
dent government, which he found to
be "paper structures" which could not
further his plans for fundamental re
form of education at Stanford.
Lyman's successor as student body
president is Cesare Massarenti, Ly
man's funning mate as ASSU vice
president in the election last May.
Massarenti, a 26-year-old doctoral can
didate in sociology, is an Italian citi
zen and former president of the stu
dent union at the University of Milan.
He is married and has a son. He is
believed to be the first foreign student
ever to be president of Stanford's stu
dent government.
Massarenti, when he learned of the
resignation late last night, said, "The
people have changed, not the ideas.
We ran together." He confirmed that
he would accept the presidency and
Would comment further at a later
time.
Succeeding Massarenti as vice presi
dent is Michael Weinstein, speaker of
the legislature. Weinstein will remain
speaker.
Lyman is the second ASSU presi
dent in a row to suddenly quit his job.
Last March David Harris resigned as
president, stating "I have done all I
am capable of doing for the realiza
tion of education at Stanford." Harris
later dropped out of school. He is now
an organizer of the anti-draft Resist
ance movement.
Lyman's reasons for resigning were
partly personal. He admitted that "I
probably had the wrong temperament
for the job in the first place," and

cited the heavy demands the position
made on his time and energy.
Lyman, a soft-spoken teaching as
sistant, agreed to run for ASSU presi
dent only reluctantly last May. Since
formally taking office in September,
he has frequently expressed his disil
lusionment with the position.
Lyman said he had been thinking of
resigning for several weeks. Resigna
tion was a possibility from the time
he was elected, Lyman said, recalling
the advice of Harris that "when it gets
too deep you can always quit."
Lyman also said he has come to
realize "conflict is the only way stu
dents are going to get anything done"
under the present structure, and that
he is unwilling to promote the conflict
himself.
"Direct conflict is the only way to
impress the people who make deci
sions around here. I campaigned on a
quite different ground. It seemed to
me that in order to get anything done
at this point I'd have to contradict
what I'd run on. I did not run on a
platform of conflict," Lyman said.
In a prepared statement, Lyman

criticized both the ASSU and the
Study of Education at Stanford (SES)
as "incapable of attaining the goals
they proclaim." He expressed disap
pointment at the failure of SES to
favor his "community government"
ideas, which were the core of cam
paign proposals to unite students and
faculty in reform of education.
Another disappointment Lyman
cited was lack of support from stu
dents. 'There's been very little sup
port, very little work," he said yes
terday.
In his statement, he blamed this
"demoralization of large segments of
the student community" on the war in
Vietnam, the draft, and"the inertia of
the government of the University."
In his campaign platform last May
Lyman claimed that ASSU "as it now
exists performs functions largely ir
relevant to student concerns." Yester
day he repeated this theme.
The everyday functions of the
ASSU, such as allocating money, Ly
man said, "could be more properly
done elsewhere." He listed communi
cation with the faculty and adminis

tration and generating new Ideas as
the important functions of a student
organization.
A viable student government at
Stanford, Lyman feels, would have to
have legal and financial independence
from the University. In his statement
yesterday, he pointed out that ASSU
performs functions "granted it by the
Dean of Students."
But Lyman, frustrated in his hopes
for a community senate which would
mix faculty and students, finally de
cided he couldn't achieve his goals as
ASSU president.
"What's important is how you
change things," he said yesterday.
"Somehow I think making new rules
and getting new constitutions and so
on isn't really very important in terms
of changing things.
"I was more interested in the
change that's taking place in people—
in the formation of community—than
in working in student politics. And
when that kind of change is gone, for
one reason or another, there's just no
reason to continue, because I'm not

particularly interested in stu
dent politics."
Lyman proposed no laws to
the student legislature while
president. He did become in
volved in several controversies
with University officials, includ
ing a dispute with Provost Rich
ard Lyman over the mailing of
a letter to freshmen, and dis
agreement with Vice Provost
Herbert Packer over the student
role in SES.
Lyman admitted some frus
tration in his dealings with ad
ministrators, although he found
them "more liberal and pro
gressive than I think ever in the
past — that's because they're
new. They're certainly headed in
the right direction. It's their ac
tions that bother me — I go in
and talk with them and get
agreement, but then I find out
that their decisions are made on
the basis of other priorities —
financial ones, that tend to run
exactly counter to the intellect
ual priorities."
Lyman, a terminal graduate
student in political science from

Lake Oswego, Oregon, hopes
now to find time to complete his
PhD thesis on "The Concept of
Ideology." Explaining that "I
really like teaching," Lyman ex
plained he is looking forward to
spending more time with his
seminar at Grove House, where
he is a tutor.
University administrators ex
pressed puzzlement and disap
pointment at Lyman's resigna
tion.
Provost Richard Lyman, who
is not related to Peter Lyman,
said he was "surprised" that the
resignation would come in the
middle of the process of choos
ing student representatives for
University committees which
formerly had no student mem
bers. Peter Lyman, as ASSU
president, nominated students
for University President Wallace
Sterling to appoint.
"I think that it is important
that there be students on thes3
advisory committees," the pro
vost said. "To the extent that
the resignation delays these ap
pointments, I regret it."
The provost mentioning David

Harris' resignation also, said,
"The lack of continuity in stu
dent government makes it diffi
cult to work with it for any pur
pose."
Joel Smith, dean of students,
had no comment on the resigna
tion.
Legislature speaker Michael
Weinstein, the new acting vice
president, said an election would
be held in winter quarter for the
VP, as provided by the ASSU
constitution.
"While it is regrettable that
Peter Lyman has resigned,"
Weinstein said, "I agree with

NEW PRESIDENT — Cesare
Massarenti, the Italian graduate
student who succeeds Lyman.
George Peter Lyman resigned yes
terday as president of the Associated
Students of Stanford University
(ASSU) after three months in office.
In a statement announcing his resig
nation, the 27-year-old graduate stu
dent blasted the ASSU as "a hollow
bureaucratic process" that is "incap
able of representing or contributing to
an intellectual community."
He called for students to "start
thinking about radical change" in stu
dent government, which he found to
be "paper structures" which could not
further his plans for fundamental re
form of education at Stanford.
Lyman's successor as student body
president is Cesare Massarenti, Ly
man's funning mate as ASSU vice
president in the election last May.
Massarenti, a 26-year-old doctoral can
didate in sociology, is an Italian citi
zen and former president of the stu
dent union at the University of Milan.
He is married and has a son. He is
believed to be the first foreign student
ever to be president of Stanford's stu
dent government.
Massarenti, when he learned of the
resignation late last night, said, "The
people have changed, not the ideas.
We ran together." He confirmed that
he would accept the presidency and
Would comment further at a later
time.
Succeeding Massarenti as vice presi
dent is Michael Weinstein, speaker of
the legislature. Weinstein will remain
speaker.
Lyman is the second ASSU presi
dent in a row to suddenly quit his job.
Last March David Harris resigned as
president, stating "I have done all I
am capable of doing for the realiza
tion of education at Stanford." Harris
later dropped out of school. He is now
an organizer of the anti-draft Resist
ance movement.
Lyman's reasons for resigning were
partly personal. He admitted that "I
probably had the wrong temperament
for the job in the first place," and

cited the heavy demands the position
made on his time and energy.
Lyman, a soft-spoken teaching as
sistant, agreed to run for ASSU presi
dent only reluctantly last May. Since
formally taking office in September,
he has frequently expressed his disil
lusionment with the position.
Lyman said he had been thinking of
resigning for several weeks. Resigna
tion was a possibility from the time
he was elected, Lyman said, recalling
the advice of Harris that "when it gets
too deep you can always quit."
Lyman also said he has come to
realize "conflict is the only way stu
dents are going to get anything done"
under the present structure, and that
he is unwilling to promote the conflict
himself.
"Direct conflict is the only way to
impress the people who make deci
sions around here. I campaigned on a
quite different ground. It seemed to
me that in order to get anything done
at this point I'd have to contradict
what I'd run on. I did not run on a
platform of conflict," Lyman said.
In a prepared statement, Lyman

criticized both the ASSU and the
Study of Education at Stanford (SES)
as "incapable of attaining the goals
they proclaim." He expressed disap
pointment at the failure of SES to
favor his "community government"
ideas, which were the core of cam
paign proposals to unite students and
faculty in reform of education.
Another disappointment Lyman
cited was lack of support from stu
dents. 'There's been very little sup
port, very little work," he said yes
terday.
In his statement, he blamed this
"demoralization of large segments of
the student community" on the war in
Vietnam, the draft, and"the inertia of
the government of the University."
In his campaign platform last May
Lyman claimed that ASSU "as it now
exists performs functions largely ir
relevant to student concerns." Yester
day he repeated this theme.
The everyday functions of the
ASSU, such as allocating money, Ly
man said, "could be more properly
done elsewhere." He listed communi
cation with the faculty and adminis

tration and generating new Ideas as
the important functions of a student
organization.
A viable student government at
Stanford, Lyman feels, would have to
have legal and financial independence
from the University. In his statement
yesterday, he pointed out that ASSU
performs functions "granted it by the
Dean of Students."
But Lyman, frustrated in his hopes
for a community senate which would
mix faculty and students, finally de
cided he couldn't achieve his goals as
ASSU president.
"What's important is how you
change things," he said yesterday.
"Somehow I think making new rules
and getting new constitutions and so
on isn't really very important in terms
of changing things.
"I was more interested in the
change that's taking place in people—
in the formation of community—than
in working in student politics. And
when that kind of change is gone, for
one reason or another, there's just no
reason to continue, because I'm not

particularly interested in stu
dent politics."
Lyman proposed no laws to
the student legislature while
president. He did become in
volved in several controversies
with University officials, includ
ing a dispute with Provost Rich
ard Lyman over the mailing of
a letter to freshmen, and dis
agreement with Vice Provost
Herbert Packer over the student
role in SES.
Lyman admitted some frus
tration in his dealings with ad
ministrators, although he found
them "more liberal and pro
gressive than I think ever in the
past — that's because they're
new. They're certainly headed in
the right direction. It's their ac
tions that bother me — I go in
and talk with them and get
agreement, but then I find out
that their decisions are made on
the basis of other priorities —
financial ones, that tend to run
exactly counter to the intellect
ual priorities."
Lyman, a terminal graduate
student in political science from

Lake Oswego, Oregon, hopes
now to find time to complete his
PhD thesis on "The Concept of
Ideology." Explaining that "I
really like teaching," Lyman ex
plained he is looking forward to
spending more time with his
seminar at Grove House, where
he is a tutor.
University administrators ex
pressed puzzlement and disap
pointment at Lyman's resigna
tion.
Provost Richard Lyman, who
is not related to Peter Lyman,
said he was "surprised" that the
resignation would come in the
middle of the process of choos
ing student representatives for
University committees which
formerly had no student mem
bers. Peter Lyman, as ASSU
president, nominated students
for University President Wallace
Sterling to appoint.
"I think that it is important
that there be students on thes3
advisory committees," the pro
vost said. "To the extent that
the resignation delays these ap
pointments, I regret it."

NEW PRESIDENT — Cesare
Massarenti, the Italian graduate
student who succeeds Lyman.
George Peter Lyman resigned yes
terday as president of the Associated
Students of Stanford University
(ASSU) after three months in office.
In a statement announcing his resig
nation, the 27-year-old graduate stu
dent blasted the ASSU as "a hollow
bureaucratic process" that is "incap
able of representing or contributing to
an intellectual community."
He called for students to "start
thinking about radical change" in stu
dent government, which he found to
be "paper structures" which could not
further his plans for fundamental re
form of education at Stanford.
Lyman's successor as student body
president is Cesare Massarenti, Ly
man's funning mate as ASSU vice
president in the election last May.
Massarenti, a 26-year-old doctoral can
didate in sociology, is an Italian citi
zen and former president of the stu
dent union at the University of Milan.
He is married and has a son. He is
believed to be the first foreign student
ever to be president of Stanford's stu
dent government.
Massarenti, when he learned of the
resignation late last night, said, "The
people have changed, not the ideas.
We ran together." He confirmed that
he would accept the presidency and
Would comment further at a later
time.
Succeeding Massarenti as vice presi
dent is Michael Weinstein, speaker of
the legislature. Weinstein will remain
speaker.
Lyman is the second ASSU presi
dent in a row to suddenly quit his job.
Last March David Harris resigned as
president, stating "I have done all I
am capable of doing for the realiza
tion of education at Stanford." Harris
later dropped out of school. He is now
an organizer of the anti-draft Resist
ance movement.
Lyman's reasons for resigning were
partly personal. He admitted that "I
probably had the wrong temperament
for the job in the first place," and

cited the heavy demands the position
made on his time and energy.
Lyman, a soft-spoken teaching as
sistant, agreed to run for ASSU presi
dent only reluctantly last May. Since
formally taking office in September,
he has frequently expressed his disil
lusionment with the position.
Lyman said he had been thinking of
resigning for several weeks. Resigna
tion was a possibility from the time
he was elected, Lyman said, recalling
the advice of Harris that "when it gets
too deep you can always quit."
Lyman also said he has come to
realize "conflict is the only way stu
dents are going to get anything done"
under the present structure, and that
he is unwilling to promote the conflict
himself.
"Direct conflict is the only way to
impress the people who make deci
sions around here. I campaigned on a
quite different ground. It seemed to
me that in order to get anything done
at this point I'd have to contradict
what I'd run on. I did not run on a
platform of conflict," Lyman said.
In a prepared statement, Lyman

criticized both the ASSU and the
Study of Education at Stanford (SES)
as "incapable of attaining the goals
they proclaim." He expressed disap
pointment at the failure of SES to
favor his "community government"
ideas, which were the core of cam
paign proposals to unite students and
faculty in reform of education.
Another disappointment Lyman
cited was lack of support from stu
dents. 'There's been very little sup
port, very little work," he said yes
terday.
In his statement, he blamed this
"demoralization of large segments of
the student community" on the war in
Vietnam, the draft, and"the inertia of
the government of the University."
In his campaign platform last May
Lyman claimed that ASSU "as it now
exists performs functions largely ir
relevant to student concerns." Yester
day he repeated this theme.
The everyday functions of the
ASSU, such as allocating money, Ly
man said, "could be more properly
done elsewhere." He listed communi
cation with the faculty and adminis

tration and generating new Ideas as
the important functions of a student
organization.
A viable student government at
Stanford, Lyman feels, would have to
have legal and financial independence
from the University. In his statement
yesterday, he pointed out that ASSU
performs functions "granted it by the
Dean of Students."
But Lyman, frustrated in his hopes
for a community senate which would
mix faculty and students, finally de
cided he couldn't achieve his goals as
ASSU president.
"What's important is how you
change things," he said yesterday.
"Somehow I think making new rules
and getting new constitutions and so
on isn't really very important in terms
of changing things.
"I was more interested in the
change that's taking place in people—
in the formation of community—than
in working in student politics. And
when that kind of change is gone, for
one reason or another, there's just no
reason to continue, because I'm not

particularly interested in stu
dent politics."
Lyman proposed no laws to
the student legislature while
president. He did become in
volved in several controversies
with University officials, includ
ing a dispute with Provost Rich
ard Lyman over the mailing of
a letter to freshmen, and dis
agreement with Vice Provost
Herbert Packer over the student
role in SES.
Lyman admitted some frus
tration in his dealings with ad
ministrators, although he found
them "more liberal and pro
gressive than I think ever in the
past — that's because they're
new. They're certainly headed in
the right direction. It's their ac
tions that bother me — I go in
and talk with them and get
agreement, but then I find out
that their decisions are made on
the basis of other priorities —
financial ones, that tend to run
exactly counter to the intellect
ual priorities."
Lyman, a terminal graduate
student in political science from

Lake Oswego, Oregon, hopes
now to find time to complete his
PhD thesis on "The Concept of
Ideology." Explaining that "I
really like teaching," Lyman ex
plained he is looking forward to
spending more time with his
seminar at Grove House, where
he is a tutor.
University administrators ex
pressed puzzlement and disap

exactly counter to the intellect
ual priorities."
Lyman, a terminal graduate
student in political science from

Lake Oswego, Oregon, hopes
now to find time to complete his
PhD thesis on "The Concept of
Ideology." Explaining that "I
really like teaching," Lyman ex
plained he is looking forward to
spending more time with his
seminar at Grove House, where
he is a tutor.
University administrators ex
pressed puzzlement and disap
pointment at Lyman's resigna
tion.
Provost Richard Lyman, who
is not related to Peter Lyman,
said he was "surprised" that the
resignation would come in the
middle of the process of choos
ing student representatives for
University committees which
formerly had no student mem
bers. Peter Lyman, as ASSU
president, nominated students
for University President Wallace
Sterling to appoint.
"I think that it is important
that there be students on thes3
advisory committees," the pro
vost said. "To the extent that
the resignation delays these ap
pointments, I regret it."
The provost mentioning David

Harris' resignation also, said,
"The lack of continuity in stu
dent government makes it diffi
cult to work with it for any pur
pose."
Joel Smith, dean of students,
had no comment on the resigna
tion.
Legislature speaker Michael
Weinstein, the new acting vice
president, said an election would
be held in winter quarter for the
VP, as provided by the ASSU
constitution.
"While it is regrettable that
Peter Lyman has resigned,"
Weinstein said, "I agree with
him that his action can have con
structive results. His criticisms
of student government are valid.
His inability to carry out his
campaign platform is in a large
part due to the fundamental lack
of power of the ASSU.
"The legisuature's primary
function this year will be to
come up with a suggestion for
community government. If it is
refused, we will have to take
steps to unilaterally secure stu
dent power, possibly by creat

lug a student union that's inde
pendently financed," Weinstein
said.


NEW PRESIDENT — Cesare
Massarenti, the Italian graduate
student who succeeds Lyman.
