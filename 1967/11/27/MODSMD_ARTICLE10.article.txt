# Lyman Resignation
## 
### 
ASSU President Peter Lyman has resigned.
For a second consecutive year, the elected stu
dent president has failed to serve out his ap
pointed term.
His resignation is really an anti-climax be
cause student government has done nothing for
weeks.
In some ways the fault lies with the despera
tion felt by so many students over the war and
the draft. And it is also the oppressive and com
petitive environment which makes students re
treat into themselves, into their books, and away
from campus affairs.
The greatest cause of the inactivity this fall,
however, must be the administration of Peter
Lyman. Last spring students were encouraged
by the support he received in winning an abso
lute majority in the primary. His reasoned ap
proach and calm analysis of issues gave hope
for a fall during which students would be deeply
moved to define their own education and their
student lives.
However, Lyman even then warned students:
"The election of one person does not mean any
thing; it is the election of a set of ideas."
Lyman has been eloquent in defining those
ideas and his concern for Stanford and its edu
cational programs is intense. However, in prac
tice Peter Lyman has done little to make this
year what we have hoped it to be.
He delayed the appointments to the presi
dential advisory committees until it is now too
late i"or the committees to meet before the end
of the quarter. He was so slow to appoint mem
bers to the Committee of 15 that it is certain
this important committee will not undertake
any serious business until wiM:er quarter.
There is so much day to day work, so much
planning and so much turmoil a president must

deal with. The business of coordinating student
efforts, within or without a student government
as now exists, is a taxing job.
It was apparent last spring he did not want
to run for ASSU President. He was drafted by
the activist and moderate elements to lead their
philosophy to victory. His work this fall as a
teaching assistant and a graduate student writ
ing his thesis has not allowed him to be an ef
fective president.
In resigning yesterday, Lyman focused on the
powerlessness of student government and the
immovable bureaucracy of the University. In
so doing, he has again highlighted, as he did in
his campaign, the need for reform in University
government.
As he pointed out, the functions of student
government are mostly trivial and students have
little direct influence over the nature of their ed
ucation. However, it is unclear what Lyman ex
pects to accomplish by resigning on this issue.
In his first campaign statement last spring he
said exactly the same thing.
Lyman knew what the situation was when he
ran for office. He had two choices. The first was
to declare himself the last ASSU President and
seek to abolish the student government as it
existed.
The second was to involve students informal
ly and formally in as many functions of the Uni
versity as possible. Such a situation could lead
to the de facto community government Lyman
hoped for. Certainly the second was the more
difficult path.
Peter Lyman has failed to do either, but now
he resigns that a student government might be
created to play a responsible role. In an almost
unconscious way, he has stated the opportunity
is still there, but that he is not the one to pursue
it.

is still there, but that he is not the one to pursue
it.
ASSU President Peter Lyman has resigned.
For a second consecutive year, the elected stu
dent president has failed to serve out his ap
pointed term.
His resignation is really an anti-climax be
cause student government has done nothing for
weeks.
In some ways the fault lies with the despera
tion felt by so many students over the war and
the draft. And it is also the oppressive and com
petitive environment which makes students re
treat into themselves, into their books, and away
from campus affairs.
The greatest cause of the inactivity this fall,
however, must be the administration of Peter
Lyman. Last spring students were encouraged
by the support he received in winning an abso
lute majority in the primary. His reasoned ap
proach and calm analysis of issues gave hope
for a fall during which students would be deeply
moved to define their own education and their
student lives.
However, Lyman even then warned students:
"The election of one person does not mean any
thing; it is the election of a set of ideas."
Lyman has been eloquent in defining those
ideas and his concern for Stanford and its edu
cational programs is intense. However, in prac
tice Peter Lyman has done little to make this
year what we have hoped it to be.
He delayed the appointments to the presi
dential advisory committees until it is now too
late i"or the committees to meet before the end
of the quarter. He was so slow to appoint mem
bers to the Committee of 15 that it is certain
this important committee will not undertake
any serious business until wiM:er quarter.
There is so much day to day work, so much
planning and so much turmoil a president must

deal with. The business of coordinating student
efforts, within or without a student government
as now exists, is a taxing job.
It was apparent last spring he did not want
to run for ASSU President. He was drafted by
the activist and moderate elements to lead their
philosophy to victory. His work this fall as a
teaching assistant and a graduate student writ
ing his thesis has not allowed him to be an ef
fective president.
In resigning yesterday, Lyman focused on the
powerlessness of student government and the
immovable bureaucracy of the University. In
so doing, he has again highlighted, as he did in
his campaign, the need for reform in University
government.
As he pointed out, the functions of student
government are mostly trivial and students have
little direct influence over the nature of their ed
ucation. However, it is unclear what Lyman ex
pects to accomplish by resigning on this issue.
In his first campaign statement last spring he
said exactly the same thing.
Lyman knew what the situation was when he
ran for office. He had two choices. The first was
to declare himself the last ASSU President and
seek to abolish the student government as it
existed.
The second was to involve students informal
ly and formally in as many functions of the Uni
versity as possible. Such a situation could lead
to the de facto community government Lyman
hoped for. Certainly the second was the more
difficult path.
Peter Lyman has failed to do either, but now
he resigns that a student government might be
created to play a responsible role. In an almost
unconscious way, he has stated the opportunity
is still there, but that he is not the one to pursue
it.
