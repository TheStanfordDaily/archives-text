## Join The Dow Team 
### Bob Fishman 
"Well, my boy, why do you
want to join us on the Dow
Chemical management team?"
The young man smiled ex
pectantly and his bright blue
eyes sparkled in the fluorescent
light."
"You see, Sir," he began, "all
my life—ever since I can re
member, —I've wanted to make
napalm. Other kids on my block
played fireman or doctor or big
league pitcher. I incinerated the
family cat.
"I still remember the day I
got my first chemistry set. How
could I forget? It was the same
day the old-folks home burned
down.
No Prizes
"Of course, the most impor
tant single event in my life was
when I was chosen to represent
my school at the national sci
ence fair. While the other kids
in my Chemistry class were
busy making icecubes, I was
hard at work on my research.
I called it 'An Investigation of
the Adhesive Properties of Burn
ing Jellied Gasoline, with spe
cial reference to Guinea Pig
Fur.'
"I didn't win first prize,
though. Some of the judges
were offended by the smell of
burning flesh. Very unscientific
of them, don't you think?
"But at least my project
helped me to get into engineer
ing school. And, I must say, I've

felt very much at home here."
"That's what we like to see,"
said the interviewer. "Individ
ual initiative. But what about
your extracurricular interests?"
Managements Leads
The young man brushed back
his close-cropped blond hair and
straightened his navy-blue suit.
"I was founder of the ballistic
missile club, and president of
the rifle club. Prizefighting is
my favorite spectator sport, al
though I do like a bloody cock
fight once in a while. Otherwise,
I like to relax with a good mur
der novel or war movie."
"Young man, I realize that
you've got brains and talent,
but that doesn't mean much If
you can't get along with people.
How are you at human rela
tions?"
"Human relations, Sir? What
do you mean?"
"I mean getting the most out
of your subordinates."
"Oh. I can say with all mod
esty, Sir, that I am the best liked
man I know. I've never heard a
bad word about me."
The Napalm Family
"No need to go into details,"
the interviewer interrupted. This
is just what we want to hear.
But I want to know one more
thing. We in the Dow family re
gard making napalm as more
than just another job. It's a way
of life. It's the Thursday night
bowling game—the Napalm Divi-

sion vs. the Defoliant Sector. It's
the office party when we fin
ished our first million pounds.
It's the fellowship of dedicated
men and women. Son, do you
think you could Join the Napalm
Family?"
"Sir, I would be proud to
spend the rest of my life in the
napalm business. I think there's
a great future here for me—and
for any other young man with
guts, common sense, initiative
and perseverance!"
The interviewer was beaming.
"Do you have any questions?"
he asked.
"Just one," replied the young
man. "Does Dow have a Pension
Plan?"
