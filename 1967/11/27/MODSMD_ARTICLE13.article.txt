## Red-Tile Roofs Are A Distinctive Motif 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
I feel the Daily is rather short
sighted and unfair in its remark
(picture of new fraternity clus
ter and caption, Nov. 22) that
Stanford's red tile roofs make
the campus "a hotbed of archi
tectural traditionalism," and in
its similar statements of the past
on the subject.
The uniform use of red tile
roofs at Stanford, as well as the
similar predominant use of the
light pink-brown building color,
represents, as I see it, not so
much "architectural traditional
ism (although I cannot see any
thing intrinsically wrong with
this) as it does an attempt, well
conceived and fairly-well exe
cuted, to create an aesthetic
architectural unity on the Stan
ford campus.
With the use of the distinctive
motirs of red tile roofs and a
more or less standard exterior
color Stanford has created a
pleasant integration of building
styles in which the beauty of
neither its oldest nor its newest
buildings has been sacrificed or
made to look out of place.

• Soccer To Me
Editor, The Daily:
I was dismayed by the mis
leading slant taken by Nick Sel
by's article on soccer November
22, 1967. Nick and I agreed it
would be a good idea to help
the sport. To this end he assert

ed that the only purpose of his
article would be to suggest two
points: (a) what steps should be
taken to improve the soccer pro
gram at Stanford, and (b) what
changes should be desirable in
the Athletic Department policies
towards minor sports such as
soccer, crew, lacrosse, etc.
In any case, no attack on any
individual was ever intended.
Unfortunately, Nick, following
the example of some Hearst re
porters, seems to be more inter
ested in telling about some al
leged quarrel between me and
Mr. Priddle, the Stanford Soccer
Coach.
To this extent, Nick has let me
down; performed a disservice to
the soccer program, and shovyn
a clear lack of understanding of
the issues and problems of mi
nor sports.
Nick's story makes me look as
if I were plotting against a poor,
defenseless coach. However, the
facts are that when I suggested
to write an article on soccer, he
had no information on the sport
and said he was too busy to get
it. For this reason, I put him in
touch with present varsity and
freshman players and with the
present volunteer Freshman
coach.
They, but not I, told Nick
what they thought of the soccer
program at Stanford today; he
received information from them.
I discussed with him only issues
relating to why soccer should be

promoted at Stanford, but noth
ing more.
It is unnecessary to comment
on the help soccer receives from
the Athletic Department. There
is not one good playing field and
not even one paid half-time
coach.
Nick mentions a quarrel be
tween me and Mr. Priddle. Such
quarrel is nonexistent. Mr. Prid
dle puts his own time and money
into the sport and has done more
for Stanford Soccer than anyone
else. This is real generosity on
his part, especially in view of
the fact that he already has a
fulltime job with the University
Grounds Department. In addi
tion, he has helped me personal
ly countless times. For all this
I am grateful to him.
SAMUEL STEVENS
(Editor's Note: Mr. Stevens'
letter contains several Inaccura
cies. Stevens did in fact say
what he thought of the soccer
program and Coach Priddle.
Stevens argued In the Dally of
fice with a member of the team
that a change In coaches was
needed.
The spMt between Stevens,
Priddle, and White is not merely
"some alleged quarrel," at least
not In the minds of Priddle and
White. Priddle repeated yester
day that there was a major
quarrel last spring. "Why else
would he criticize us?" Priddle
asked.
The Stanford Athletic Depart
ment also has copies of state

ments Stevens planned to enter
In court charging White with as
sault, after an incident concern
ing Interference with practice.
The charges were later dropped.
Finally, articles are not writ
ten to perform services for cer
tain people, but because of the
significance of the subject. —

• Much Dissatisfaction
Editor, the Daily:
Nick Selby has stabbed soccer
in the back. I had hoped he
would write a responsible criti
cism of the soccer program. In
stead, he wrote what amounts
to be an attack at Sam Stevens.
I want to say right away that
Sam Stevens is a very sincere
person who cares very much
about soccer here at Stanford.
He wants to improve the sys
tem, not tear it down.
Nick Selby stated that the
criticisms of soccer "have come
solely at the urging of Stevens."
This is just not true. Freshman
year two years ago—before I
knew Sam Stevens —many- of
my friends on the freshman
team and I were very dissatis
fied with the way soccer was
run. There was little spirit and
much dissention on the varsity,
and the freshman team rarely
got a chance to play due to a
lack of field space.
Yes, the soccer team is not
well, but not because of Sam
Stevens' criticism. The team
was sick before Sam said any

thing. His criticism is a product
of present troubles, not the
cause of them.
I think Mr. Priddle should be
commended for his sincere In
terest in soccer and his keeping
soccer going over the years, but
the fact still remains that the
program has been lifeless the
past few years. A new young
coach is needed to instill some
fire and life into soccer at Stan
ford.

thing. His criticism is a product
of present troubles, not the
cause of them.
I think Mr. Priddle should be
commended for his sincere In
terest in soccer and his keeping
soccer going over the years, but
the fact still remains that the
program has been lifeless the
past few years. A new young
coach is needed to instill some
fire and life into soccer at Stan
ford.

A "Negro" on campus
Editor, The Dally:
I feel the Daily is rather short
sighted and unfair in its remark
(picture of new fraternity clus
ter and caption, Nov. 22) that
Stanford's red tile roofs make
the campus "a hotbed of archi
tectural traditionalism," and in
its similar statements of the past
on the subject.
The uniform use of red tile
roofs at Stanford, as well as the
similar predominant use of the
light pink-brown building color,
represents, as I see it, not so
much "architectural traditional
ism (although I cannot see any
thing intrinsically wrong with
this) as it does an attempt, well
conceived and fairly-well exe
cuted, to create an aesthetic
architectural unity on the Stan
ford campus.
With the use of the distinctive
motirs of red tile roofs and a
more or less standard exterior
color Stanford has created a
pleasant integration of building
styles in which the beauty of
neither its oldest nor its newest
buildings has been sacrificed or
made to look out of place.

• Soccer To Me
Editor, The Daily:
I was dismayed by the mis
leading slant taken by Nick Sel
by's article on soccer November
22, 1967. Nick and I agreed it
would be a good idea to help
the sport. To this end he assert

ed that the only purpose of his
article would be to suggest two
points: (a) what steps should be
taken to improve the soccer pro
gram at Stanford, and (b) what
changes should be desirable in
the Athletic Department policies
towards minor sports such as
soccer, crew, lacrosse, etc.
In any case, no attack on any
individual was ever intended.
Unfortunately, Nick, following
the example of some Hearst re
porters, seems to be more inter
ested in telling about some al
leged quarrel between me and
Mr. Priddle, the Stanford Soccer
Coach.
To this extent, Nick has let me
down; performed a disservice to
the soccer program, and shovyn
a clear lack of understanding of
the issues and problems of mi
nor sports.
Nick's story makes me look as
if I were plotting against a poor,
defenseless coach. However, the
facts are that when I suggested
to write an article on soccer, he
had no information on the sport
and said he was too busy to get
it. For this reason, I put him in
touch with present varsity and
freshman players and with the
present volunteer Freshman
coach.
They, but not I, told Nick
what they thought of the soccer
program at Stanford today; he
received information from them.
I discussed with him only issues
relating to why soccer should be

promoted at Stanford, but noth
ing more.
It is unnecessary to comment
on the help soccer receives from
the Athletic Department. There
is not one good playing field and
not even one paid half-time
coach.
Nick mentions a quarrel be
tween me and Mr. Priddle. Such
quarrel is nonexistent. Mr. Prid
dle puts his own time and money
into the sport and has done more
for Stanford Soccer than anyone
else. This is real generosity on
his part, especially in view of
the fact that he already has a
fulltime job with the University
Grounds Department. In addi
tion, he has helped me personal
ly countless times. For all this
I am grateful to him.

letter contains several Inaccura

The spMt between Stevens,

• Much Dissatisfaction
Editor, the Daily:
Nick Selby has stabbed soccer
in the back. I had hoped he
would write a responsible criti
cism of the soccer program. In
stead, he wrote what amounts
to be an attack at Sam Stevens.
I want to say right away that
Sam Stevens is a very sincere
person who cares very much
about soccer here at Stanford.
He wants to improve the sys
tem, not tear it down.
Nick Selby stated that the
criticisms of soccer "have come
solely at the urging of Stevens."
This is just not true. Freshman
year two years ago—before I
knew Sam Stevens —many- of
my friends on the freshman
team and I were very dissatis
fied with the way soccer was
run. There was little spirit and
much dissention on the varsity,
and the freshman team rarely
got a chance to play due to a
lack of field space.
Yes, the soccer team is not
well, but not because of Sam
Stevens' criticism. The team

• Much Dissatisfaction
Editor, the Daily:
Nick Selby has stabbed soccer
in the back. I had hoped he
would write a responsible criti
cism of the soccer program. In
stead, he wrote what amounts
to be an attack at Sam Stevens.
I want to say right away that
Sam Stevens is a very sincere
person who cares very much
about soccer here at Stanford.
He wants to improve the sys
tem, not tear it down.
Nick Selby stated that the
criticisms of soccer "have come
solely at the urging of Stevens."
This is just not true. Freshman
year two years ago—before I
knew Sam Stevens —many- of
my friends on the freshman
team and I were very dissatis
fied with the way soccer was
run. There was little spirit and
much dissention on the varsity,
and the freshman team rarely
got a chance to play due to a
lack of field space.
Yes, the soccer team is not
well, but not because of Sam
Stevens' criticism. The team
was sick before Sam said any

thing. His criticism is a product
of present troubles, not the
cause of them.
I think Mr. Priddle should be
commended for his sincere In
terest in soccer and his keeping
soccer going over the years, but
the fact still remains that the
program has been lifeless the
past few years. A new young
coach is needed to instill some
fire and life into soccer at Stan
ford.

A "Negro" on campus
Editor, The Dally:
I feel the Daily is rather short
sighted and unfair in its remark
(picture of new fraternity clus
ter and caption, Nov. 22) that
Stanford's red tile roofs make
the campus "a hotbed of archi
tectural traditionalism," and in
its similar statements of the past
on the subject.
The uniform use of red tile
roofs at Stanford, as well as the
similar predominant use of the
light pink-brown building color,
represents, as I see it, not so
much "architectural traditional
ism (although I cannot see any
thing intrinsically wrong with
this) as it does an attempt, well
conceived and fairly-well exe
cuted, to create an aesthetic
architectural unity on the Stan
ford campus.
With the use of the distinctive
motirs of red tile roofs and a
more or less standard exterior
color Stanford has created a
pleasant integration of building
styles in which the beauty of
neither its oldest nor its newest
buildings has been sacrificed or
made to look out of place.

• Soccer To Me
Editor, The Daily:
I was dismayed by the mis
leading slant taken by Nick Sel
by's article on soccer November
22, 1967. Nick and I agreed it
would be a good idea to help
the sport. To this end he assert

ed that the only purpose of his
article would be to suggest two
points: (a) what steps should be
taken to improve the soccer pro
gram at Stanford, and (b) what
changes should be desirable in
the Athletic Department policies
towards minor sports such as
soccer, crew, lacrosse, etc.
In any case, no attack on any
individual was ever intended.
Unfortunately, Nick, following
the example of some Hearst re
porters, seems to be more inter
ested in telling about some al
leged quarrel between me and
Mr. Priddle, the Stanford Soccer
Coach.
To this extent, Nick has let me
down; performed a disservice to
the soccer program, and shovyn
a clear lack of understanding of
the issues and problems of mi
nor sports.
Nick's story makes me look as
if I were plotting against a poor,
defenseless coach. However, the
facts are that when I suggested
to write an article on soccer, he
had no information on the sport
and said he was too busy to get
it. For this reason, I put him in
touch with present varsity and
freshman players and with the
present volunteer Freshman
coach.
They, but not I, told Nick
what they thought of the soccer
program at Stanford today; he
received information from them.
I discussed with him only issues
relating to why soccer should be

promoted at Stanford, but noth
ing more.
It is unnecessary to comment
on the help soccer receives from
the Athletic Department. There
is not one good playing field and
not even one paid half-time
coach.
Nick mentions a quarrel be
tween me and Mr. Priddle. Such
quarrel is nonexistent. Mr. Prid
dle puts his own time and money
into the sport and has done more
for Stanford Soccer than anyone
else. This is real generosity on
his part, especially in view of
the fact that he already has a
fulltime job with the University
Grounds Department. In addi
tion, he has helped me personal
ly countless times. For all this
I am grateful to him.

letter contains several Inaccura

The spMt between Stevens,

asked.

• Much Dissatisfaction
Editor, the Daily:
Nick Selby has stabbed soccer
in the back. I had hoped he
would write a responsible criti
cism of the soccer program. In
stead, he wrote what amounts
to be an attack at Sam Stevens.
I want to say right away that
Sam Stevens is a very sincere
person who cares very much
about soccer here at Stanford.
He wants to improve the sys
tem, not tear it down.
Nick Selby stated that the
criticisms of soccer "have come
solely at the urging of Stevens."
This is just not true. Freshman
year two years ago—before I
knew Sam Stevens —many- of
my friends on the freshman
team and I were very dissatis
fied with the way soccer was
run. There was little spirit and
much dissention on the varsity,
and the freshman team rarely
got a chance to play due to a
lack of field space.
Yes, the soccer team is not
well, but not because of Sam
Stevens' criticism. The team
was sick before Sam said any

thing. His criticism is a product
of present troubles, not the
cause of them.
I think Mr. Priddle should be
commended for his sincere In
terest in soccer and his keeping
soccer going over the years, but
the fact still remains that the
program has been lifeless the
past few years. A new young
coach is needed to instill some
fire and life into soccer at Stan
ford.

After being a freshman spon
sor for two years I have come
to the following conclusion: The
average Stanford student is
more reactionary than the Tur
kish peasant, the religious fana
tic in Jerusalem . . . and a bit
less reactionary than the flesh
eating, blood drinking tribes of
Indonesia.
Oh, by the way... I would
like to make an announcement
. . . there is a war going on in
Vietnam . . .

A "Negro" on campus
Editor, The Dally:
I feel the Daily is rather short
sighted and unfair in its remark
(picture of new fraternity clus
ter and caption, Nov. 22) that
Stanford's red tile roofs make
the campus "a hotbed of archi
tectural traditionalism," and in
its similar statements of the past
on the subject.
The uniform use of red tile
roofs at Stanford, as well as the
similar predominant use of the
light pink-brown building color,
represents, as I see it, not so
much "architectural traditional
ism (although I cannot see any
thing intrinsically wrong with
this) as it does an attempt, well
conceived and fairly-well exe
cuted, to create an aesthetic
architectural unity on the Stan
ford campus.
With the use of the distinctive
motirs of red tile roofs and a
more or less standard exterior
color Stanford has created a
pleasant integration of building
styles in which the beauty of
neither its oldest nor its newest
buildings has been sacrificed or
made to look out of place.

• Soccer To Me
Editor, The Daily:
I was dismayed by the mis
leading slant taken by Nick Sel
by's article on soccer November
22, 1967. Nick and I agreed it
would be a good idea to help
the sport. To this end he assert

ed that the only purpose of his
article would be to suggest two
points: (a) what steps should be
taken to improve the soccer pro
gram at Stanford, and (b) what
changes should be desirable in
the Athletic Department policies
towards minor sports such as
soccer, crew, lacrosse, etc.
In any case, no attack on any
individual was ever intended.
Unfortunately, Nick, following
the example of some Hearst re
porters, seems to be more inter
ested in telling about some al
leged quarrel between me and
Mr. Priddle, the Stanford Soccer
Coach.
To this extent, Nick has let me
down; performed a disservice to
the soccer program, and shovyn
a clear lack of understanding of
the issues and problems of mi
nor sports.
Nick's story makes me look as
if I were plotting against a poor,
defenseless coach. However, the
facts are that when I suggested
to write an article on soccer, he
had no information on the sport
and said he was too busy to get
it. For this reason, I put him in
touch with present varsity and
freshman players and with the
present volunteer Freshman
coach.
They, but not I, told Nick
what they thought of the soccer
program at Stanford today; he
received information from them.
I discussed with him only issues
relating to why soccer should be

promoted at Stanford, but noth
ing more.
It is unnecessary to comment
on the help soccer receives from
the Athletic Department. There
is not one good playing field and
not even one paid half-time
coach.
Nick mentions a quarrel be
tween me and Mr. Priddle. Such
quarrel is nonexistent. Mr. Prid
dle puts his own time and money
into the sport and has done more
for Stanford Soccer than anyone
else. This is real generosity on
his part, especially in view of
the fact that he already has a
fulltime job with the University
Grounds Department. In addi
tion, he has helped me personal
ly countless times. For all this
