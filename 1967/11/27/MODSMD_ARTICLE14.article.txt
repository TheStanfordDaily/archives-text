# Will LASSU Get Moving?
## New Committees Planned 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
But what does LASSU actual
ly do?
The answer to this perennial,
persistent question about
LASSU (Legislature of the As
sociated Students of Stanford
University) is—
It depends.
But whether or not LASSU ac
tually does anything, it always
appoints committees designed to
do something.
Speaker Michael Weinstein,
armed with a new by-law giving
him laissez-faire authority to
form committees, has outlined
plans for eight topic groups to
study and report to the legisla
ture next quarter.
A dozen hard-working students
on each committee, Weinstein
believes, would insure that
LASSU has sound facts and pro
posals to convert into legisla
tion.
Under a by-law enacted Nov.
2, Weinstein can appoint both
LASSU members and non-mem
bers to an unlimited number of
"autonomous" committees,
whose functions he can define.
He hopes to appoint interested
LASSU members at the meeting
Thursday, and is accepting non
member applications at his of
fice in Tresidder.
The eight committees are:
• Grades. The LASSU commit

tee would "examine the concept
of grading, its relevance to edu
cation, and its effect on stu
dents."
Stanford has been drifting in
the nationwide current toward
less grading, but it is uncertain
where the University will end
up. Limited pass-fail grading
was adopted in September, 1966,
and renewed with some changes
this year as part of a three-year
experiment. Some have praised
pass-fail and called for its exten
sion to all courses. But a similar
experiment, deferring grades for
freshmen until the end of the
year, was dropped in September
after a "disastrous" one-year
trial.
The Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) was silent on
grading in its recent position
paper on undergraduate educa
tion. But SES will eventually
make recommendations on this
issue, one which never fails to
excite student interest.
The LASSU committee could
get the jump on SES by making
its own recommendations and
submitting them to the high
level Committee of Fifteen next
quarter.
• Course Evaluation Booklet.
This committee would have two
jobs: (1) Drawing up a list of
the "inadequate" course descrip
tions in the University's Courses

and Degrees bulletin, so the Leg
islature can ask Registrar Har
vey Hall to obtain more com
plete descriptions from the de
partments involved.
(2) Organizing a staff to pub
lish a Course Evaluation Book
let in spring as the students' an
swer to Courses and DegTees.
This annual student publication
is traditionally known as the
"Scratch Sheet," but Weinstein
hopes for a much more impres
sive publication this year and
thus has given it a more impres
sive title.
• ASSU Professorship Com
mission. Peter Lyman talked of
a visiting professor hired and
paid by students in his campaign
for ASSU president last spring,
but the expense turned out to be
prohibitive. Instead Weinstein
envisions a program which
would bring educators here for
a week to lecture and conduct
seminars.
• ASSU Housing Conimision.
Hopefully this committee would
be a revival of the talented group
which drew up a comprehensive
report on student residences in
January. Many of the thought
ful conclusions of that commis
sion were enacted, such as in
creased integration of freshmen
with upper classmen and the
right of some women to live
off-campus.
Actually a by-law specifies
that the ASSU Housing Com
mission should be appointed by
the ASSU president, speaker,
and outgoing commission chair
man, but since no one has both
ered to do this, Weinstein is
going ahead and forming a
LASSU committee to do the com
mission's job, and hasn't hesi
tated to expropriate the com
mission's name.
• ASSU Constitution and By-
Laws. "An intensive examina
tion, perhaps rewriting," of these
documents will be the job of
this committee. Weinstein and
other student government offi
cers have criticized the by-laws
as a confusing and contradictory
morass of laws, many of them
inoperative. Beyond simple re
writing, Weinstein, Lyman and
ASSU Vice President Cesare
Massarenti all have doubts about
the usefulness of student gov
ernment itself. The LASSU com
mittee could make recommenda
tions on a reform of the funda
mental structure of student gov
ernment at Stanford.
• Elections. Weinstein is con
cerned with the "antiquated"
election rules. The last ASSU
presidential election, in May, was

plagued by mudslinging and a
recent head yell leader election
was invalidated because of elec
tioneering violations. Currently
the ASSU by-laws impose strict
rules on candidates, such as a
$25 limit on campaign expendi
tures.
• Publications. A key project
of this committee, Weinstein
hopes, would be a "broadly based
newsletter" to be mailed to Stan
ford alumni. It would be "a sort
of students' version of Stanford
Today."
• University Telephone Sys
tem. Stanford is considering
switching to the "Centrex" tele
phone system, providing individ
ual phones to students. A LASSU
committee would try to make a
student voice heard in the deci
sion.
These eight committees may
be just a start. Weinstein has the
power to appoint an unlimited
number of these "autonomous"
groups, drawing members from
within and without LASSU.
The legislature also has five
standing committees — judicial,
by-laws, rules, finance and stu
dent affairs. Early in the year
members were appointed to each,
but with LASSU's recently ex
panded membership, Weinstein
plans to choose more. He has
stated a goal of involving every
LASSU member in some com
mittee work, since he regards
committees as the place where
LASSU can accomplish some
thing.
With LASSU swelled to 125
representatives after the recent
elections, he should have no
shortage of committee members.
