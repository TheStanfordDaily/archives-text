# Another Attempt
## Why Not Vietnam As A 51st State? 
### Herbie Hinckes 
An aide ushered Defense Secretary Robert S. McEdsel into
the spacious office at the White House.
"Well," President Lyndon B. Consensus grinned at him, "how's
the war?"
"You can't win 'em all," McEdsel answered.
"Hold down the funny stuff, Bob," Consensus scowled. "It
might hurt me in the popularity polls," he said, pointing to a
framed newspaper clipping hanging above the American flag in
a corner of the office.
McEdsel walked over and inspected the clipping. "I see what you
mean, Mr. President, But that's why I came today. I have an
other ..."
Electric Fence
"Plan?" Consensus interjected. "Let me guess â€” you're going
to build an electric fence around South Vietnam?"
"No," McEdsel guffawed, "that was last week's plan."
"Are you going to make Soupy Sales the next president of South
Vietnam?"
"I thought about it, but the Joint Chiefs of Staff wouldn't buy
it after his TV show folded. Keep guessing."
"You aren't planning to release a dozen killer squids in Haiphong
Harbor, are you?"
"I wish you wouldn't make fun of my plans, Mr. President, be
cause I have a hum-dinger this time," McEdsel said.
"All right, then, Bob," Consensus remarked as he opened a bottle
of tranquilizers, "tell me about it."
51st State
Bouncing up and down in his chair with glee, McEdsel started his
recitation of The Plan.
"First, Mr. President, you want to end the war, right?"
"I'd like to be re-elected, let's put it that way."
"And you would like to keep the Communists out of Vietnam
forever?"
"Sounds good."
"And have complete control of Vietnam?"
"Yes."
"Here's my plan," McEdsel said as he unfolded a map of South
Vietnam with a large "51" penciled in the middle of the country.
"We'll make South Vietnam the 51st state!!"
Consensus suddenly swiveled around in his chair. "Are you
out of your mind? We already have enough trouble with 50 states,
why would we want another?"
"It can't be all that bad, Mr. President," McEdsel said. "I have
a good reason for wanting South Vietnam in the United States."
Commies Must Register
"What could that possibly be?"
"As soon as South Vietnam is officially in the U.S., then the
Smith Act will be in effect."
"The Smith Act?"
"Sure, that's the law that requires all Communists to register
with the Attorney General."
"Oh!! That's brilliant, Bob, simply brilliant!"
"Of course, Mr. President, once we make South Vietnam the
51st state, we can simply arrest every Viet Cong in sight. There'll
be no more war, no more Communists, and we'll have complete
control of Vietnam."
"Brilliantly simple, Bob," Consensus exclaimed again. He paused.
"But there's just one problem. Once they become citizens, do you
think they'll vote for me?"
McEdsel suppressed a chortle with some difficulty. "Well," h 1
said, "They voted for Thieu and Ky didn't they?"
