# Magazine Suspended At San Francisco State
## 
### 
For the second time in less
than a year publication of San
Francisco State's weekly Open
Process, has been halted. College
president John H. Summerskill
ordered the halt saying that the
limits of good taste had again
been exceeded.
The publication, which is fi
nanced by $14,000 of student
funds, has been attacked as a
lewd, obnoxious paper, but has
also been described as "serious
and strongly intellectual."
The present dispute, as last
spring when the college sus
pended the paper's publication,
involves the esoteric literary
efforts of the Sexual Freedom
League's Jefferson Poland.
Subsequent to that issue,
Summerskill said that he had

to spend 80 per cent of his
time for five weeks answer
ing protest letters from legis
lators and other citizens —
which gives some idea of how
widely the paper is circulated.
After publication of the cur
rent issue of Open Process.
Summerskill called an emer
gency session of the college's
Board of Publications and re
quested that permission to pub
lish be suspended.
Wednesday, Summerskill told
the board, composed of students
and faculty, that Open Process
contained offensive material and
negated assurances given him
when publication was resumed
last September that the paper's
"tone and content wouldbe ap
propriate for an academic in
stitution."
