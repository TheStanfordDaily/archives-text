# Columbia U.: No On-Campus Recruit Drive
## 
### 
Columbia University has ended
all on-campus military recruit
ing pending assurance from the
government that students inter
fering with recruitment will not
lose their draft deferments.
About 150 members of the
Columbia College faculty had
recommended the action last
week in response to a directive
to 4,100 local draft boards from
Lieut. Gen. Louis B. Hershey,
director of the Selective Service
System, asking that students
who obstruct military recruit
ment lose their student defer
ments.
Dr. Grayson Kirk, president
of Columbia, announced the ban
on Tuesday and said, "Distinc
tion should be drawn between
recruitment on the campus
which Columbia regards as a
university function subject to
university discipline, and re
cruitment off the campus, which
is purely a Government matter."
He noted, however, that "the
university does not condone
and will not tolerate the use
of force in any form to obstruct
its function, and it does not
condone illegal activity by any
of its members on or off the
campus."
On Nov. 8, a five-man college
faculty committee on recruiting
reported to Dr. Kirk that it had
found no compelling reasons to
change the university policy of
open recruitment by outside
agencies.
