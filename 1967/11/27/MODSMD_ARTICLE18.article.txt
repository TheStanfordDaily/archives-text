# Ohio's Central State College Head Resigns
## 
### 
Dr. Harry E. Groves, presi
dent of Ohio's Central State
University, announced his res
ignation Saturday at a news
conference.
Groves, 46, had been the
center of a controversy since
Nov. 13 when violence broke out
among Black Power advocates
at the predominantly Negro
school. Groves is Negro.
The Ohio Highway Patrol and
Ohio National Guard were
railed to quell the violence and
the next day the board of
trustees ordered the school
closed and students sent home.
Classes were to resume next

Monday.
"I have been subjected to con
stant petty attacks," Groves
said in a resignation statement.
"These were understandable
and curable in the normal
course of events, but in this
hour of genuine institutional
crisis, brought about by ele
ments determined to destroy
the university, I find that many
students, parents, alumni and
faculty members were not
discussing improvement of the
university or the really basic
issues threatening the life of
the institution."
