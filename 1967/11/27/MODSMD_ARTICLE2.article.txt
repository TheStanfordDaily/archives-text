## Nonpolitical President 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Peter Lyman entered politics last
Spring without being a politician. He
left politics yesterday still not a poli
tician, thoroughly depressed and de
feated by the ends and means of poli
tics.
He returns to the theory of political
science today having learned the pro
ficient practice of that theory would
have called for him to be someone
other than Peter Lyman. His brief ad
ministration was marked by a contin
uing contradiction between the broad
goals he sought and the means he had
to use in seeking them.

As this quarter proceeded, he found
the contradiction becoming more and
more acute, culminating in a malaise
that brought his resignation from
ASSU President. But that malaise had
its roots last Spring in the days even
before he became a candidate for the
post.
Lyman did not walk or rush into the
election. He was talked into it. Memo
ries are still vivid among members of
this community who spent evenings
and nights telling Lyman he had to
run for the good of the University, for
the good of the liberal students, facul
ty, and administration.

His home was the Grove House and
his advice came from those living
around him. Once he had declared his
candidacy, his main support and plan
ning came from those same friends.
As the campaign proceeded, Lyman's
own desire and interest grew, sparked
by his campaign managers and paper
writers clustered in the T.V. room of
Grove.
But even as his desire grew, it was
apparent to those who knew him, that
Lyman was not quite sure he was en
tering the right field. He had im
pressed many observers with his soft
spoken manner and seeming depth of
sensitivity, yet it was these very
characteristics that seemed un
suited lor an election or an ad
ministration.
The intensity of the campaign,
however, soon dominated as can
didates spoke in White Plaza,
talked at residences, prepared
position papers and made
charges and counter-charges.
The Lyman camp inspired
charges of "In-Crowd Conspir
acy" among the opposition
which caused, at the least, acute
consternation in his own back
ers, The Daily, Beta Chi, and
Grove it was declared, were re
sponsible for pushing Lyman
into the race as "Their" man.
This issue saw its death
when the year ended, but it left
the winning candidate with some
very strong supporters and
many very luke warm admirers.
The "In-Crowd" incident
seemed to make Lyman feel un
easy, not because he feared it
was true, but rather because it
was messy and controversial. It
was politics, and he didn't like
it.
Prepares Position Papers
Much of Lyman's campaign
energy and time went into the
preparation of extensive position
papers stating his philosophy of
education. This was much more
his medium than the speech plat
form and he spent much more
time quietly writing in room
than noisly debating his oppo
nents in public. In fact, he gave
only four public speeches in the
campaign.
If there was anything Lyman
seemed to derive most pleasure
from last spring, it was working
on these papers. And as he
worked, he was continually told
by supporters how crucial they
were to the future of Stanford.
Few people, however, told him
how difficult they would be to
implement, how political his
methods would have to be.
He was elected in the primary
and soon after began to plan his
administration strategy. He
talked with his most ardent sup
porters and began to meet with
administration personnel discus
sing plans for the next year.
These were good times for Ly
man. He found the administra
tion interested and in agreement
with many oi his ideas and his
supporters were still very much
with him. He was president, but
he wasn't in office.

The summer passed as he
worked on his Ph.D. thesis and
kept in touch with developments
on campus and in the ASSU of
fice. These months, however
pointed out some of his distinc
tive work traits that seemed to
forebode trouble for the year
ahead.
He loved to sit and chat, think,
plan, discuss, but not organize
or face the realities and prob
lems he would have to face. It
became increasingly clear to
those working with him that Ly
man was not an administrator
in any sense of the word.
Freshman Letter
One of his tasks during the
summer was to write a letter to
incoming freshmen. This letter
turned into Lyman's first politi
cal shock. The University admin
istration refused to mail it in the
official pre-reg packet sent to
freshmen. In fact, the adminis
tration at first refused to allow
any mailing at all.
Lyman found himself involved
in heated arguments with ad
ministrators and he left the
whole episode totally alienated
from the administration and the
hard-nose politics he had en
tered. The letter was finally sent
in an ASSU mailing, but Lyman
had discovered the gap between
conceptualization and implemen
tation.
School began in September
and not long after Lyman dis
covered that most of his sup
porters from the previous spring
had deserted the cause. He tried
to start work on creating some
of the institutions he had sug
gested in position papers and
campaign speeches. But one
friend after another begged off
murmuring about too much
work and too little spirit.
Left Alone
This left Lyman alone with
his vice-president and adminis
trative assistant. Already de
pressed by the lack of support,
he became further desolute hav
ing to build a program and face
opposition alone.
He faced the contradiction of
goals and methods again when
the proposal for an academic
senate was publicized. Lyman
felt this modification in faculty
government was purposeless if
it did not include an attempt to
rework the whole structure of
community government at Stan
ford. Back in the Spring he had

built his campaign on the prem
ise of creating a "community of
scholars" at Stanford and he
saw the faculty proposal as a
small, isolated change that
would only delay the structure
he sought.
His criticisms were received
with explanations of how the
faculty idea was not working
against his plans, but at the
same time couldn't wait for his
plans. It was another frustration
in which the administration and
faculty seemed to understand,
but didn't do anything about it.
Lyman had raised the issue but
failed to see that without proper
lobbying and intense work, noth
ing could happen. It left him
with a feeling of impotence
about any changes he might pro
pose.
Probably the most central
cause of frustration for Lyman
were his contacts with the Study
of Education. Here, he felt, was
a means for improving Stanford
and he campaigned strongly on
the idea that students must get
involved with SES to insure it
incorporated student ideas.
Felt Getting Nowhere
But the longer he met with
Study officials the more Lyman
felt he was getting nowhere.
Even today he feels Study Chair
man Herbert L. Packer listens
to him but doesn't act on what
he says. Packer agreed to a Ly
man proposal for establishing a
student advisory committee to
review SES proposals and offer
comments and criticism.
But Lyman was so alienated
from SES that he barely had the
desire to set up such a commit
tee. It was only last week, long
after the agreement was reached
with Packer, that Lyman began
to accept applications for the re
view board.
This was his last gasp and it
was carried through more by
outside persuasion than Lyman's
own initiative. His long-r a n g e
goals were again postponed by
the immediate necessities of
dealing with administrative
channels.
These channels seemed to be
an unending maze to Lyman and
he resigned partly from fear of
trying to change them, but his
real goals were not to undo a
bureaucracy. They were to con
struct a new system, a task as
political as theoretical.
Lyman was neither a task
master nor a politician.

Spring without being a politician. He
left politics yesterday still not a poli
tician, thoroughly depressed and de
feated by the ends and means of poli
tics.
He returns to the theory of political
science today having learned the pro
ficient practice of that theory would
have called for him to be someone
other than Peter Lyman. His brief ad
ministration was marked by a contin
uing contradiction between the broad
goals he sought and the means he had
to use in seeking them.

As this quarter proceeded, he found
the contradiction becoming more and
more acute, culminating in a malaise
that brought his resignation from
ASSU President. But that malaise had
its roots last Spring in the days even
before he became a candidate for the
post.
Lyman did not walk or rush into the
election. He was talked into it. Memo
ries are still vivid among members of
this community who spent evenings
and nights telling Lyman he had to
run for the good of the University, for
the good of the liberal students, facul
ty, and administration.

His home was the Grove House and
his advice came from those living
around him. Once he had declared his
candidacy, his main support and plan
ning came from those same friends.
As the campaign proceeded, Lyman's
own desire and interest grew, sparked
by his campaign managers and paper
writers clustered in the T.V. room of
Grove.
But even as his desire grew, it was
apparent to those who knew him, that
Lyman was not quite sure he was en
tering the right field. He had im
pressed many observers with his soft
spoken manner and seeming depth of
sensitivity, yet it was these very
characteristics that seemed un
suited lor an election or an ad
ministration.
The intensity of the campaign,
however, soon dominated as can
didates spoke in White Plaza,
talked at residences, prepared
position papers and made
charges and counter-charges.
The Lyman camp inspired
charges of "In-Crowd Conspir
acy" among the opposition
which caused, at the least, acute
consternation in his own back
ers, The Daily, Beta Chi, and
Grove it was declared, were re
sponsible for pushing Lyman
into the race as "Their" man.
This issue saw its death
when the year ended, but it left
the winning candidate with some
very strong supporters and
many very luke warm admirers.
The "In-Crowd" incident
seemed to make Lyman feel un
easy, not because he feared it
was true, but rather because it
was messy and controversial. It
was politics, and he didn't like
it.
Prepares Position Papers
Much of Lyman's campaign
energy and time went into the
preparation of extensive position
papers stating his philosophy of
education. This was much more
his medium than the speech plat
form and he spent much more
time quietly writing in room
than noisly debating his oppo
nents in public. In fact, he gave
only four public speeches in the
campaign.
If there was anything Lyman
seemed to derive most pleasure
from last spring, it was working
on these papers. And as he
worked, he was continually told
by supporters how crucial they
were to the future of Stanford.
Few people, however, told him
how difficult they would be to
implement, how political his
methods would have to be.
He was elected in the primary
and soon after began to plan his
administration strategy. He
talked with his most ardent sup
porters and began to meet with
administration personnel discus
sing plans for the next year.
These were good times for Ly
man. He found the administra
tion interested and in agreement
with many oi his ideas and his
supporters were still very much
with him. He was president, but
he wasn't in office.

The summer passed as he
worked on his Ph.D. thesis and
kept in touch with developments
on campus and in the ASSU of
fice. These months, however
pointed out some of his distinc
tive work traits that seemed to
forebode trouble for the year
ahead.
He loved to sit and chat, think,
plan, discuss, but not organize
or face the realities and prob
lems he would have to face. It
became increasingly clear to
those working with him that Ly
man was not an administrator
in any sense of the word.
Freshman Letter
One of his tasks during the
summer was to write a letter to
incoming freshmen. This letter
turned into Lyman's first politi
cal shock. The University admin
istration refused to mail it in the
official pre-reg packet sent to
freshmen. In fact, the adminis
tration at first refused to allow
any mailing at all.
Lyman found himself involved
in heated arguments with ad
ministrators and he left the
whole episode totally alienated
from the administration and the
hard-nose politics he had en
tered. The letter was finally sent
in an ASSU mailing, but Lyman
had discovered the gap between
conceptualization and implemen
tation.
School began in September
and not long after Lyman dis
covered that most of his sup
porters from the previous spring
had deserted the cause. He tried
to start work on creating some
of the institutions he had sug
gested in position papers and
campaign speeches. But one
friend after another begged off
murmuring about too much
work and too little spirit.
Left Alone
This left Lyman alone with
his vice-president and adminis
trative assistant. Already de
pressed by the lack of support,
he became further desolute hav
ing to build a program and face
opposition alone.
He faced the contradiction of
goals and methods again when
the proposal for an academic
senate was publicized. Lyman
felt this modification in faculty
government was purposeless if
it did not include an attempt to
rework the whole structure of
community government at Stan
ford. Back in the Spring he had

built his campaign on the prem
ise of creating a "community of
scholars" at Stanford and he
saw the faculty proposal as a
small, isolated change that
would only delay the structure
he sought.
His criticisms were received
with explanations of how the
faculty idea was not working
against his plans, but at the
same time couldn't wait for his
plans. It was another frustration
in which the administration and
faculty seemed to understand,
but didn't do anything about it.
Lyman had raised the issue but
failed to see that without proper
lobbying and intense work, noth
ing could happen. It left him
with a feeling of impotence
about any changes he might pro
pose.
Probably the most central
cause of frustration for Lyman
were his contacts with the Study
of Education. Here, he felt, was
a means for improving Stanford
and he campaigned strongly on
the idea that students must get
involved with SES to insure it
incorporated student ideas.
Felt Getting Nowhere
But the longer he met with
Study officials the more Lyman
felt he was getting nowhere.
Even today he feels Study Chair
man Herbert L. Packer listens
to him but doesn't act on what
he says. Packer agreed to a Ly
man proposal for establishing a
student advisory committee to
review SES proposals and offer
comments and criticism.
But Lyman was so alienated
from SES that he barely had the
desire to set up such a commit
tee. It was only last week, long
after the agreement was reached
with Packer, that Lyman began
to accept applications for the re
view board.
This was his last gasp and it
was carried through more by
outside persuasion than Lyman's
own initiative. His long-r a n g e
goals were again postponed by
the immediate necessities of
dealing with administrative
channels.
These channels seemed to be
an unending maze to Lyman and
he resigned partly from fear of
trying to change them, but his
real goals were not to undo a
bureaucracy. They were to con
struct a new system, a task as
political as theoretical.
Lyman was neither a task
master nor a politician.

left politics yesterday still not a poli
tician, thoroughly depressed and de
feated by the ends and means of poli
tics.
He returns to the theory of political
science today having learned the pro
ficient practice of that theory would
have called for him to be someone
other than Peter Lyman. His brief ad
ministration was marked by a contin
uing contradiction between the broad
goals he sought and the means he had
to use in seeking them.

As this quarter proceeded, he found
the contradiction becoming more and
more acute, culminating in a malaise
that brought his resignation from
ASSU President. But that malaise had
its roots last Spring in the days even
before he became a candidate for the
post.
Lyman did not walk or rush into the
election. He was talked into it. Memo
ries are still vivid among members of
this community who spent evenings
and nights telling Lyman he had to
run for the good of the University, for
the good of the liberal students, facul
ty, and administration.

His home was the Grove House and
his advice came from those living
around him. Once he had declared his
candidacy, his main support and plan
ning came from those same friends.
As the campaign proceeded, Lyman's
own desire and interest grew, sparked
by his campaign managers and paper
writers clustered in the T.V. room of
Grove.
But even as his desire grew, it was
apparent to those who knew him, that
Lyman was not quite sure he was en
tering the right field. He had im
pressed many observers with his soft
spoken manner and seeming depth of
sensitivity, yet it was these very
characteristics that seemed un
suited lor an election or an ad
ministration.
The intensity of the campaign,
however, soon dominated as can
didates spoke in White Plaza,
talked at residences, prepared
position papers and made
charges and counter-charges.
The Lyman camp inspired
charges of "In-Crowd Conspir
acy" among the opposition
which caused, at the least, acute
consternation in his own back
ers, The Daily, Beta Chi, and
Grove it was declared, were re
sponsible for pushing Lyman
into the race as "Their" man.
This issue saw its death
when the year ended, but it left
the winning candidate with some
very strong supporters and
many very luke warm admirers.
The "In-Crowd" incident
seemed to make Lyman feel un
easy, not because he feared it
was true, but rather because it
was messy and controversial. It
was politics, and he didn't like
it.
Prepares Position Papers
Much of Lyman's campaign
energy and time went into the
preparation of extensive position
papers stating his philosophy of
education. This was much more
his medium than the speech plat
form and he spent much more
time quietly writing in room
than noisly debating his oppo
nents in public. In fact, he gave
only four public speeches in the
campaign.
If there was anything Lyman
seemed to derive most pleasure
from last spring, it was working
on these papers. And as he
worked, he was continually told
by supporters how crucial they
were to the future of Stanford.
Few people, however, told him
how difficult they would be to
implement, how political his
methods would have to be.
He was elected in the primary
and soon after began to plan his
administration strategy. He
talked with his most ardent sup
porters and began to meet with
administration personnel discus
sing plans for the next year.
These were good times for Ly
man. He found the administra
tion interested and in agreement
with many oi his ideas and his
supporters were still very much
with him. He was president, but
he wasn't in office.

The summer passed as he
worked on his Ph.D. thesis and
kept in touch with developments
on campus and in the ASSU of
fice. These months, however
pointed out some of his distinc
tive work traits that seemed to
forebode trouble for the year
ahead.
He loved to sit and chat, think,
plan, discuss, but not organize
or face the realities and prob
lems he would have to face. It
became increasingly clear to
those working with him that Ly
man was not an administrator
in any sense of the word.
Freshman Letter
One of his tasks during the
summer was to write a letter to
incoming freshmen. This letter
turned into Lyman's first politi
cal shock. The University admin
istration refused to mail it in the
official pre-reg packet sent to
freshmen. In fact, the adminis
tration at first refused to allow
any mailing at all.
Lyman found himself involved
in heated arguments with ad
ministrators and he left the
whole episode totally alienated
from the administration and the
hard-nose politics he had en
tered. The letter was finally sent
in an ASSU mailing, but Lyman
had discovered the gap between
conceptualization and implemen
tation.
School began in September
and not long after Lyman dis
covered that most of his sup
porters from the previous spring
had deserted the cause. He tried
to start work on creating some
of the institutions he had sug
gested in position papers and
campaign speeches. But one
friend after another begged off
murmuring about too much
work and too little spirit.
Left Alone
This left Lyman alone with
his vice-president and adminis
trative assistant. Already de
pressed by the lack of support,
he became further desolute hav
ing to build a program and face
opposition alone.
He faced the contradiction of
goals and methods again when
the proposal for an academic
senate was publicized. Lyman
felt this modification in faculty
government was purposeless if
it did not include an attempt to
rework the whole structure of
community government at Stan
ford. Back in the Spring he had

built his campaign on the prem
ise of creating a "community of
scholars" at Stanford and he
saw the faculty proposal as a
small, isolated change that
would only delay the structure
he sought.
His criticisms were received
with explanations of how the
faculty idea was not working
against his plans, but at the
same time couldn't wait for his
plans. It was another frustration
in which the administration and
faculty seemed to understand,
but didn't do anything about it.
Lyman had raised the issue but
failed to see that without proper
lobbying and intense work, noth
ing could happen. It left him
with a feeling of impotence
about any changes he might pro
pose.
Probably the most central
cause of frustration for Lyman
were his contacts with the Study
of Education. Here, he felt, was
a means for improving Stanford
and he campaigned strongly on
the idea that students must get
involved with SES to insure it
incorporated student ideas.
Felt Getting Nowhere
But the longer he met with
Study officials the more Lyman
felt he was getting nowhere.
Even today he feels Study Chair
man Herbert L. Packer listens
to him but doesn't act on what
he says. Packer agreed to a Ly
man proposal for establishing a
student advisory committee to
review SES proposals and offer
comments and criticism.
But Lyman was so alienated
from SES that he barely had the
desire to set up such a commit
tee. It was only last week, long
after the agreement was reached
with Packer, that Lyman began
to accept applications for the re
view board.
This was his last gasp and it
was carried through more by
outside persuasion than Lyman's
own initiative. His long-r a n g e
goals were again postponed by
the immediate necessities of
dealing with administrative
channels.
These channels seemed to be
an unending maze to Lyman and
he resigned partly from fear of
trying to change them, but his
real goals were not to undo a
bureaucracy. They were to con
struct a new system, a task as
political as theoretical.
Lyman was neither a task
master nor a politician.

tician, thoroughly depressed and de
feated by the ends and means of poli
tics.
He returns to the theory of political
science today having learned the pro
ficient practice of that theory would
have called for him to be someone
other than Peter Lyman. His brief ad
ministration was marked by a contin
uing contradiction between the broad
goals he sought and the means he had
to use in seeking them.

As this quarter proceeded, he found
the contradiction becoming more and
more acute, culminating in a malaise
that brought his resignation from
ASSU President. But that malaise had
its roots last Spring in the days even
before he became a candidate for the
post.
Lyman did not walk or rush into the
election. He was talked into it. Memo
ries are still vivid among members of
this community who spent evenings
and nights telling Lyman he had to
run for the good of the University, for
the good of the liberal students, facul
ty, and administration.

His home was the Grove House and
his advice came from those living
around him. Once he had declared his
candidacy, his main support and plan
ning came from those same friends.
As the campaign proceeded, Lyman's
own desire and interest grew, sparked
by his campaign managers and paper
writers clustered in the T.V. room of
Grove.
But even as his desire grew, it was
apparent to those who knew him, that
Lyman was not quite sure he was en
tering the right field. He had im
pressed many observers with his soft
spoken manner and seeming depth of
sensitivity, yet it was these very
characteristics that seemed un
suited lor an election or an ad
ministration.
The intensity of the campaign,
however, soon dominated as can
didates spoke in White Plaza,
talked at residences, prepared
position papers and made
charges and counter-charges.
The Lyman camp inspired
charges of "In-Crowd Conspir
acy" among the opposition
which caused, at the least, acute
consternation in his own back
ers, The Daily, Beta Chi, and
Grove it was declared, were re
sponsible for pushing Lyman
into the race as "Their" man.
This issue saw its death
when the year ended, but it left
the winning candidate with some
very strong supporters and
many very luke warm admirers.
The "In-Crowd" incident
seemed to make Lyman feel un
easy, not because he feared it
was true, but rather because it
was messy and controversial. It
was politics, and he didn't like
it.
Prepares Position Papers
Much of Lyman's campaign
energy and time went into the
preparation of extensive position
papers stating his philosophy of
education. This was much more
his medium than the speech plat
form and he spent much more
time quietly writing in room
than noisly debating his oppo
nents in public. In fact, he gave
only four public speeches in the
campaign.
If there was anything Lyman
seemed to derive most pleasure
from last spring, it was working
on these papers. And as he
worked, he was continually told
by supporters how crucial they
were to the future of Stanford.
Few people, however, told him
how difficult they would be to
implement, how political his
methods would have to be.
He was elected in the primary
and soon after began to plan his
administration strategy. He
talked with his most ardent sup
porters and began to meet with
administration personnel discus
sing plans for the next year.
These were good times for Ly
man. He found the administra
tion interested and in agreement
with many oi his ideas and his
supporters were still very much
with him. He was president, but
he wasn't in office.

The summer passed as he
worked on his Ph.D. thesis and
kept in touch with developments
on campus and in the ASSU of
fice. These months, however
pointed out some of his distinc
tive work traits that seemed to
forebode trouble for the year
ahead.
He loved to sit and chat, think,
plan, discuss, but not organize
or face the realities and prob
lems he would have to face. It
became increasingly clear to
those working with him that Ly
man was not an administrator
in any sense of the word.
Freshman Letter
One of his tasks during the
summer was to write a letter to
incoming freshmen. This letter
turned into Lyman's first politi
cal shock. The University admin
istration refused to mail it in the
official pre-reg packet sent to
freshmen. In fact, the adminis
tration at first refused to allow
any mailing at all.
Lyman found himself involved
in heated arguments with ad
ministrators and he left the
whole episode totally alienated
from the administration and the
hard-nose politics he had en
tered. The letter was finally sent
in an ASSU mailing, but Lyman
had discovered the gap between
conceptualization and implemen
tation.
School began in September
and not long after Lyman dis
covered that most of his sup
porters from the previous spring
had deserted the cause. He tried
to start work on creating some
of the institutions he had sug
gested in position papers and
campaign speeches. But one
friend after another begged off
murmuring about too much
work and too little spirit.
Left Alone
This left Lyman alone with
his vice-president and adminis
trative assistant. Already de
pressed by the lack of support,
he became further desolute hav
ing to build a program and face
opposition alone.
He faced the contradiction of
goals and methods again when
the proposal for an academic
senate was publicized. Lyman
felt this modification in faculty
government was purposeless if
it did not include an attempt to
rework the whole structure of
community government at Stan
ford. Back in the Spring he had

built his campaign on the prem
ise of creating a "community of
scholars" at Stanford and he
saw the faculty proposal as a
small, isolated change that
would only delay the structure
he sought.
His criticisms were received
with explanations of how the
faculty idea was not working
against his plans, but at the
same time couldn't wait for his
plans. It was another frustration
in which the administration and
faculty seemed to understand,
but didn't do anything about it.
Lyman had raised the issue but
failed to see that without proper
lobbying and intense work, noth
ing could happen. It left him
with a feeling of impotence
about any changes he might pro
pose.
Probably the most central
cause of frustration for Lyman
were his contacts with the Study
of Education. Here, he felt, was
a means for improving Stanford
and he campaigned strongly on
the idea that students must get
involved with SES to insure it
incorporated student ideas.
Felt Getting Nowhere
But the longer he met with
Study officials the more Lyman
felt he was getting nowhere.
Even today he feels Study Chair
man Herbert L. Packer listens
to him but doesn't act on what
he says. Packer agreed to a Ly
man proposal for establishing a
student advisory committee to
review SES proposals and offer
comments and criticism.
But Lyman was so alienated
from SES that he barely had the
desire to set up such a commit
tee. It was only last week, long
after the agreement was reached
with Packer, that Lyman began
to accept applications for the re
view board.
This was his last gasp and it
was carried through more by
outside persuasion than Lyman's
own initiative. His long-r a n g e
goals were again postponed by
the immediate necessities of
dealing with administrative
channels.
These channels seemed to be
an unending maze to Lyman and
he resigned partly from fear of
trying to change them, but his
real goals were not to undo a
bureaucracy. They were to con
struct a new system, a task as
political as theoretical.
Lyman was neither a task
master nor a politician.
