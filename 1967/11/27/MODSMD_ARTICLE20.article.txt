# Trend For Presidents?
## Harris Quit Same Position 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Peter Lyman has set no prece
dent by leaving the office of
ASSU president. Nine months
ago, another president of the
student body resigned.
"I feel my contribution in the
context of the presidency has
been made," said David Harris
on the day of his resignation.
Harris had been elected in the
spring of 1966 in a contest which
drew more Stanford students to
the polls than any ASSU elec
tion in Stanford's history.
Between the time he was elect
ed and the time he resigned,
many changes began to take
place at Stanford.
The ASSU Housing Commis
sion, appointed by Harris in the
spring, went to work on a report
which, after its release last Feb
ruary, led to plans for the
demonstration houses of Wilbur
and Stern halls and the male-fe
male integration of Branner
Hall.
Worked With OFF
Harris also worked closely
with the OFF movement to al
low women the option of living
off campus. This year, nearly

sixty senior women are enjoying
that option for the first time.
Campus debate on the draft
was enlivened from time to time
by news of Harris' increasing
difficulties with Selective Ser
vice.
He had sent his 11-S student
classification back to his draft
board in the summer of 1966,
and that December was reclassi
fied 1-A. He then filed for con
scientious objector status, but
said he was not sure of getting
it.
Anti-Draft
After resigning, Harris began
to devote himself full-time to the
anti-draft movement. Today he
heads The Resistance.
Harris's notoriety and person
al brand of radicalism aroused
the anged of many who opposed
his views. He was critcized loud
ly and openly on many occa
sions. Once, in fact, he was at
tacked personally and had his
head shaved by a group of mask
ed fraternity men.
But such diversions did not
appear to slow Harris's pace at
generating controversy.
In November, two weeks af-
the head-shaving incident,

Harris demanded the right to
appoint the student representa
tives on President Wallace Ster
ling's advisory committees, a
privilege traditionally reserved
for Sterling.
Call For Solidarity
Harris asked Sterling's ap
pointees to resign in the name
of student solidarity, claiming
they did not really represent the
student body.
In January, the Study of Ed
ucation at Stanford announced
it was seeking members for its
steering committee including
three students. Harris condemn
ed the proposed appointments on
the same grounds as he had con
demned the student appoint
ments to the Presidential Com
mittees.
"We have to fight for repre
sentation," Harris said. "This is
not a small power problem of
politics. It concerns the whole
problem of the way people look
at the University."
Loßt Battle
The battle to let students
name the student members of
the SES steering committee was
lost a week later.
When the student members of
the SES steering committee were

finally named, Harris called it
a "sophisticated whitewash," and
exhorted the student body to ex
ercise its collective power.
When Harris resigned Feb.
22, reaction ranged from adula
tion to condemnation.


DAVID HARRIS — He quit the
job last March.
