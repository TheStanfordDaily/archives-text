# National Ranking Unaltered
## Cal Tops Tribe In Nor-Cal 
### 
The Stanford water polo team
finished its season with a second
place finish in the Northern Cal
ifornia Invitation Tournament
Friday and Saturday in Cuper
tino at De Anza J.C.
California won the tourna
ment by defeating Stanford 8-6
in the Tribe's second game. The
Cards defeated Foothill College
13-6, and after the loss edged
San Jose 7-6 and smashed the
San Francisco Olympic Club 10-3
to gain second place.

The loss to Cal does not alter
Stanford's number two spot in
the national rankings, because
Stanford defeated the Golden
Bears twice earlier In the sea
son. The Cards finished the sea
son 15-4.
Gary Sheerer and John Patker
were named to the all-tourna
ment team. Sheerer fired in 20
goals in the four games for tour
nament scoring honors.
Frosh Win
The Stanford frosh won the

Santa Clara Invitation last week
With a courageous comeback
over the Cal frosh. The Papoose
poloists lost the first game of
the double-loss elimination tour
ney, falling to Cal 10-3.
But, led by high scorer Mitch
Ivey, who lodged 16 goals in five
games, the frosh roared back.

They defeated the San Jose
frosh 10-6, and edged West Val
ley J.C. 8-7. The Cards met Cal
for the second time and won
11-9.
The Tribe frosh then defeated
Cal's frosh in the playoff 8-6 for
the tournament win. They ended
their season with an 18-3 log.
