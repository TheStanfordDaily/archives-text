# Time For A Good Word About John
## 
### NICK SELBY 
The time has come for Stan
ford to make a decision. Some
one at the top levels of the Uni
versity Administration must de
cide what is going to be done
with Stanford's football team,
specifically with the coach.
Last Wednesday's Daily car
ried a letter asking that Ralston
be dismissed because he couldn't
win. "Let's admit what every
body knows. Coach John is a
lousy coach. . . . Let's reject Ral
ston. DUMP JOHN IN '68," call
ed Gil Berkeley.
Yet other people in this uni
versity have said that the Ath
letic Department and Ralston
do too much to win. Dell Martin
stated last spring in a Daily
Forum that there were too many
"think ball" pressures on foot
ball players.
Still another group doesn't
care either way. This group may
be coming into the ascendency
on the Stanford campus.
Good Word For John
Sorry fans, but I think its
time for a good word about John
Ralston. Ralston is not a ma
chine football coach. Let's thank
God for that.
Stanford probably could buy
all the Bear Bryants, Tommy
Prothros, and John McKays it
wanted. The Tribe would hit the
national rankings, and empha
size football to the utmost.
Wouldn't that be fun?
My experience with Ralston
has been perhaps more exten
sive than that of the fan in the
Stadium on Saturday afternoons.
I've talked with him and seen
him at his happiest and most
despondent times.
Never Faults Players
At his happiest times, Ralston
is quick to extend praise to
everyone on the team, never
taking credit for the win. USC
coach McKay was quoted in
Sports Illustrated after his
team's 21-20 win over UCLA,
"I'd call that pretty smart coach
ing."
He was referring to his deci
sion to use giant 6'B" Bill Hay

hoe to block Zenon Andru
syshyn's PAT attempt. If ever
the coaches deserve any credit,
Ralston extends it to his assist
ants.
At his lowest moments, Ral
ston is extremely careful not to
criticize either his players or
the referees. His players have
made many mistakes, none of
which he was the cause of, that
have cost Stanford several
games this year. But he did not
criticize them.
After UCLA barely edged
Stanford 21-16 this year, UCLA
coach Prothro criticized the ref
eree for his handling of th •
final minutes. Ralston, who per
haps felt Bill Shoemaker was
interfered with on the final play,
said nothing.
My Experience
Two incidents should illus
trate Ralston's relations with
this reporter. Last year, it ap
peared Ralston criticized Marty
Brill for his play in the UCLA
game. I reported the criticism.
But I misunderstood what Ral
ston said. The report was wrong.
For Ralston, who never cri
ticizes his players, the mistake
might have been justifiable ba
sis for terminating the relation
ship. Yet he forgot about it
quickly and continued to help
me, both with stories and under
standing football.
I had to speak with Ralston
after practice every day this
quarter, and I rode my bike
down to the field to see him.
Once, as we moved back through
the dark toward Encina Gym,
Ralston rode my bike as I walk
ed alongside.
He enjoyed the experience
greatly, much as a kid on his
first ride. It appears to me that
Ralston is emminently human,
and worth keeping at Stanford.

My Experience
Two incidents should illus
trate Ralston's relations with
this reporter. Last year, it ap
peared Ralston criticized Marty
Brill for his play in the UCLA
game. I reported the criticism.
But I misunderstood what Ral
ston said. The report was wrong.
For Ralston, who never cri
ticizes his players, the mistake
might have been justifiable ba
sis for terminating the relation
ship. Yet he forgot about it
quickly and continued to help
me, both with stories and under
standing football.
I had to speak with Ralston
after practice every day this
quarter, and I rode my bike
down to the field to see him.
Once, as we moved back through
the dark toward Encina Gym,
Ralston rode my bike as I walk
ed alongside.
He enjoyed the experience
greatly, much as a kid on his
first ride. It appears to me that
Ralston is emminently human,
and worth keeping at Stanford.
The time has come for Stan
ford to make a decision. Some
one at the top levels of the Uni
versity Administration must de
cide what is going to be done
with Stanford's football team,
specifically with the coach.
Last Wednesday's Daily car
ried a letter asking that Ralston
be dismissed because he couldn't
win. "Let's admit what every
body knows. Coach John is a
lousy coach. . . . Let's reject Ral
ston. DUMP JOHN IN '68," call
ed Gil Berkeley.
Yet other people in this uni
versity have said that the Ath
letic Department and Ralston
do too much to win. Dell Martin
stated last spring in a Daily
Forum that there were too many
"think ball" pressures on foot
ball players.
Still another group doesn't
care either way. This group may
be coming into the ascendency
on the Stanford campus.
Good Word For John
Sorry fans, but I think its
time for a good word about John
Ralston. Ralston is not a ma
chine football coach. Let's thank
God for that.
Stanford probably could buy
all the Bear Bryants, Tommy
Prothros, and John McKays it
wanted. The Tribe would hit the
national rankings, and empha
size football to the utmost.
Wouldn't that be fun?
My experience with Ralston
has been perhaps more exten
sive than that of the fan in the
Stadium on Saturday afternoons.
I've talked with him and seen
him at his happiest and most
despondent times.
Never Faults Players
At his happiest times, Ralston
is quick to extend praise to
everyone on the team, never
taking credit for the win. USC
coach McKay was quoted in
Sports Illustrated after his
team's 21-20 win over UCLA,
"I'd call that pretty smart coach
ing."
He was referring to his deci
sion to use giant 6'B" Bill Hay

hoe to block Zenon Andru
syshyn's PAT attempt. If ever
the coaches deserve any credit,
Ralston extends it to his assist
ants.
At his lowest moments, Ral
ston is extremely careful not to
criticize either his players or
the referees. His players have
made many mistakes, none of
which he was the cause of, that
have cost Stanford several
games this year. But he did not
criticize them.
After UCLA barely edged
Stanford 21-16 this year, UCLA
coach Prothro criticized the ref
eree for his handling of th •
final minutes. Ralston, who per
haps felt Bill Shoemaker was
interfered with on the final play,
said nothing.
