# Students, "Tartuffe' Cast Plan Discussion In San Francisco
## 
### 
Discussions led by speech and
drama graduate student Tony
Graham-White with the cast of
"Tartuffe", an American Con
servatory Theatre (A.C.T.) pro
duction, will highlight this Fri
day evening's trip to San Fran
cisco, sponsored by the Interna
tional Center.
The Old Spaghetti Factory
will feed the American and for
eign students participating in
this session of the weekly series.
Any Stanford student interest
ed in Friday's program should
sign up upstairs in the I-Center.
The cost for everything, includ
ing transportation, amounts to
$6.
Every other Friday, the I-Cen
ter sponsors a San Francisco
theatre party of American and
foreign students. They dine at
an international restaurant, view
a theatrical or night club show,
and talk with the cast following
the show.

The program was organized
four years ago by Tom Clagett,
then on the staff of the I-Center,
but no longer here.
Last year about 30 people at
tended these Friday evening pro
grams. This year the number
fluctuates. Sometimes a bus is
chartered, sometimes the party
travels in private cars. "A small
group can be just as enjoyable
as a large one," asserts Lois
Hermann, who, with Judy Sol
ter, heads this activity.
"Without a doubt" Friday's
program will be a success, Lois

predicted. Because of the excel
lence of the restaurant and
show, she expects about 30 stu
dents.
The next trips also feature
A.C.T. productions. On January
5, "Twelfth Night" is the play,
while "Long Day's Journey Into
Night" highlights the January
19 trip. The restaurants for
these evenings have not yet been
determined.
Last week, the theater party
dined in an Indonesian restau
rant and saw The Committee's
"America Hurrah."
