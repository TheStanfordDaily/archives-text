# Operation Crossroads Plans African Service

### 
Operation Crossroads Africa
(OCA) will hold an introductory
dinner at 6:30 Wednesday night

at the Bechtel International
Center.
All students interested in ap
plying for the 1968 program are
urged to call Mrs. Wiant in the
Dean of the Chapel's office to
make reservations.
OCA is a non-profit corpora
tion which takes groups of stu
dents to Africa during the sum
mer for shortterm service. It is
dedicated to the "idea that per
sonal contact and effort is the
most effective form of diplom
acy."
Students are sent in groups of
10-12 under the direction of an
experienced leader. They meet
with a counter-part group of Af
rican students and spend the
summer in a work project re
quested by the local government.
The dinner Wednesday night
will feature a talk by Dr. Wil
liam E. Rhodes, a former group
leader in Sierra Leone. Dr.
Rhodes will show films of his
experiences in Africa and there
will also be an introductory film
from the OCA regional office.
The program is financed by
fees, contributions and founda
tion grants. Crossroads Africa
was founded in 1957 and now
includes students from the
United States, Canada, and Latin
America.
Dr. James H. Robinson, found
er of the program, has called it
"neither a tourist joy-ride nor a
safari. It is a project for far
sighted young men and women
. . . who are not afraid of taking
risks and are willing to live and
work with people at the village
level under severely limited en
vironmental conditions."
