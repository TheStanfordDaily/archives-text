### 
Stanford University has estab
lished a cooperative study cen
ter with the University of Ma
drid, Prof. Bernard Vicovate,
head of the division of Spanish
and Portuguese in the depart
ment of modern european lan
guages, announced yesterday.
The program, which begins
in September 1968, is similar to
the University's cooperative ar
rangement with the University
of Nantes for French majors.
The University of Madrid pro
gram will be open to Spanish
majors and allied disciplines,
mainly in history, Prof. Gicovate
said. Deadline for applications
to the department office is Jan.
31.
The initial program will be
opened to 15 students, drawn
from juniors, seniors, and some
graduate students. They will
spend six months in Madrid next
fall and winter quarters, housed
in dormitories on the university
campus.
The program will be admin
istered jointly by the director of
overseas campuses and the divi
sion of Spanish and Portuguese.
Prof. Gicovate, director of the
division, will serve as faculty
member in charge of the initial
group. He will teach a daily
course in Spanish conversation
and composition and receive re
ports from the Stanford students
on their assignments in the reg
ular curriculum of the Univer
sity of Madrid.
Stanford has previously estab
lished programs for language
majors at the Universities of
Hamburg and Nantes. More than
hall Stanford's undergraduates
attend extension campuses near
Stuttgart, Germany; in Tours,
France; Florence, Italy, Vien
na, Austria; and Harlaxton, Eng
land, for six months prior to re

ceiving their bachelor degrees.
In addition, the University also
has a cooperative agreement
with the Center for the Study
of Classics in. Rome and others
for the study of Asian languages
in Tokyo and Taipei.
According to Professor Gico
vati the 40,000 - student Uni
versity, located in its own
"neighborhood" in the city, is
"one of the best in the Spanish
World, along with the Univer
sity of Mexico."
And, "though it belongs to the
state," he continued, political and
cultural opportunities abound:
"There is everything you can
think of â€” anything and every
thing."
The curriculum for Stanford
students will include three
courses of their own choosing
plus one from the Stanford pro
fessor in residence.
