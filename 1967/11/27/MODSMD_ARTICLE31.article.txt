# Christmas Sale Slated By Volunteers In Asia
## 
### 
Handicrafts from a variety of
cooperatives and community de
velopment organizations will be
offered for sale by Volunteers
in Asia today, tomorrow and
Wednesday on White Plaza.
The sale, timed to coincide
with students' needs for unusual
Christmas gifts, includes hand
made goods from Vietnam, the
Philippines, Hong Kong, Macao
and Appalachia.
VIA has worked with a num
ber of organizations in Asia
which have developed handi
crafts as the best means of help
ing people move beyond a sub
sistence economy while preserv
ing traditional skills.

One of the products comes
from a refugee camp in central
Vietnam where Tom Fox, a re
cent Stanford graduate and now
an IVS volunteer, organized
workers to make the traditional
Vietnamese conical hats. The 25
to 50 cents a worker earns each
day more than doubles the
family's income. The refugee
camp, made up entirely of farm
ing families, was built on sand
dunes which support only cac
tus.
Another IVS volunteer has
â€¢worked with the Chams, an
ethnic group on the central
coast, in developing markets for
their handwoven blankets.
