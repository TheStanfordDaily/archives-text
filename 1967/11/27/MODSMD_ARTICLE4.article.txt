# Mitterand Coming Wed.
## 
### 
Francois Mitterand, the leader
of the Federation of the Left in
France and the candidate who
forced General de Gaulle into a
run-off campaign in 1965, will
speak in Memorial Auditorium
at 4:30 Wednesday.
French polls this fall have
shown that Mitterand could beat
Premier Georges Pompidou as
well as Finance Minister Valery
Giscard for the Presidency of
France if the election were held
at the time of the polls, last
September.
Mitterand, who has the sup
port of the curiously bourgeois
French Communist Party, has
also been gaining on President
de Gaulle, against whom Mitter

and drew 11 million votes in
1965 to de Gaulle's 13 million.
Mitterand's policy is essential
ly anti-Gaullist and he has fre
quently accused de Gaulle of
backward-looking policies that
keep France away from a world
role in the 20th Century.
Mitterand will speak on 'The
Role of France in the Future,'
he hopes in English, although
there will be an interpreter pres
ent to help him since he is not
entirely confident in English.
Mitterand has called President
de Gaulle "brusque, cold and au
thoritarian."
France-Solr has called Mitter
and "independent, impassioned,
mysterious, irritating and at
tractive."
