## Cases Referred To IJB 
### 
Ten students charged with vio
lations of University demonstra
tions policy will be tried by th â€¢
Interim Judicial Board (IJB).
Dean of Students Joel Smith
asked, in a letter to IJB Chair
man Prof. Howard Williams
dated Nov. 22, "that the IJB take
jurisdiction of the cases I ini
tiated" against the anti-Central
Intelligence Agency demonstra
tors of Nov. 1.
Smith turned the case over to
the all-faculty IJB after the stu
dent Judicial Council last week
refused to hear the case. In a
letter to Smith, the council

claimed that precedents involv
ing the IJB and Judicial Council
rendered the council's decision
virtually meaningless.
Council Chairman John Ras
kin said, "If in fact the council
were to reach a decision unac
ceptable to the Dean's office, the
decision would almost certainly
be overruled [by the IJB]."
In addition, the student legi
slature last week withdrew rec
ognition of the IJB, thus further
clouding the question of campus
judicial review. No other ap
peals board exists beside the
IJB.
Attempts in the past by the
Committee of Fifteen have fail
ed to produce the faculty-student
appeals board envisioned in the
1965 Judicial Competence Bill.
The IJB was to function only
until such a board was set up.
Smith said he would issue a
statement today explaining his
views of recent developments.
"I want to see the president
[Sterling]," he said. "We should
be in high gear by this after
noon."
One of the students charged
in the Nov. 1 demonstration,
medical student Marc Sapir, told
the IJB in a letter that to take
the cas? at Smith's request
would be to act "in direct de
fiance of student law and stu
dent autonomy."
According to Sapir, the ASSU
by-laws amendment passed by
the legislature last week says, in
effect, that "the student body
does not acknowledge the IJB
interpretation that University
regulations are automatically
part of the student law, student
honor code, and student Funda
mental Standard."
This action by LASSU there
fore implies that "the Admini
stration must carry out its own
disciplinary procedures and

swing its own axe," Sapir said.
Sapir suggested that the IJB
send the problem of the judicial
review board back to the Execu
tive Committee of the Academic
Council "so that an equitable
review system can be s n t up in
cooperation with the Legislature
of the ASSU."
The elimination of the IJB
as a legitimate appeals board,
Sapir stated, is a recognition on
the part of students that the
IJB "inherently represents the
interests of the Administration
and can not possibly do justice
to any grievance that comes in
the realm of student-Administra
tion dispute."
Sapir told the IJB faculty
members, "in your present capa
city you are acting as appointed
administrators and not as fac
ulty members.
"It would be more appropriate
for you to assert your rightful
place as members of the aca
demic community. Why attack
student government?" Sapir ask
ed.
