# Macao Missionary Plans Stay On Row
## 
### 
Father Patrick R. Shaules S.J.,
founder of the Enterprise, a
self-help project in Asia, and
the Row's first guest-in-resi
dence, will speak at Durand
House on refugees, relief, and
the American role in underde
veloped countries at 6:30 tonight.
This afternoon he will talk at
the business school about the
role of U.S. business and gov
ernment in the development of
Asia. Tomorrow night he will
speak at Hurlburt House on the
political situation in China, Ma
cao, and Hong Kong.
Returning to the United States
after 17 years in the Far East,
he will contact local industrial
ists, clergy, and businessmen to
enlist their aid on behalf of free
enterprise.
The Enterprise is a non-profit
clearing house for self-help and
development projects, whose

main function consists of find
ing buyers for handicraft train
ing work centers and coopera
tives in Macao, Hong Kong, the
Philippines, Formosa, and other
nations in Asia.
The Enterprise arose as a re
sponse to the difficulty he found
in obtaining market outlets for
the eight centers of the Ma
cao Welfare Enterprise, which
he started in 1962 to solve the
rcitical unemployment problem
of young refugees from the
Chinese mainland.
He plans to form a school
for some of the refugees and
villagers if he can find volunteer
instructors.
Shaules will stay at Durand
House Monday and Tuesday.
Rose Tak, a student at San Fran
cisco College for Women from
Macau and a close associate of
Shaules, will be at Hurlburt
House at the same time.
