# Track Coach Blames 'Coercion' For Boycott
## 
### RENTON ROLPH 
Payton Jordan, head coach of
the U.S. Olympic Men's Track
and Field Squad as well as of
the Stanford track team, sug
gested last weekend that coer
cion must have been used in the
Olympic boycott movement.
"There must be some coercion
to have an individual who has
worked so long and hard (to
qualify for the Olympics) to
change his mind in the middle
of the stream, but I don't know
all the reasons."
Jordan also expressed regret
"that the liberal loudmouth gets
all the attention, and the person
who speaks rationally is not
heard. ... So few seem to be
ruining it for so many."
Stanford's Jordan will head
the Olympic team of which Har
ry Edwards, an assistant profes
sor of sociology at San Jose
State, has initiated a boycott by
Afro-American athletes.
Boycott Details Announced
Details of the threatened 1968
Olympic boycott were revealed
Friday by Edwards, a 24 year
old Black Power activist and
former track and basketball star
at San Jose State College.
The Negro college teacher,
who compared the United States
to a luxury liner headed for the
rocks of racial discrimination,
described three resolutions
passed at a black youth confer
ence Thanksgiving Day in Los
Angeles.
The principal resolution pro
posed a boycott of the Mexico
City Olympics to be held this
summer. Two other resolutions
were passed urging Negro ath
letes to refuse to participate in
competition with South Africa or
Rhodesia and also in events held
by the New York Athletic Club
The supporters of the boycott
resolutions included UCLA bas
ketball star Lew Alcindor and

San Jose State sprinters Tom
mie Smith and Lee Evans.
Evans, who was a member ol
the team which broke the world
record in the 800-meter relay last
year, said he would not partici
pate in the Games "if it meant
slamming the potential door to
freedom in the face of black
people."
Applause But No Commitment
Edwards made his comments
in a speech to the almost solidly
white Conference of Associated
Student Governments at the St.
Francis Hotel in San Francisco
Friday. His 300 listeners ap
plauded, but quickly issued an
official statement disclaiming ei
ther endorsement or criticism of
Edward's remarks, both during
his speech and also at his
conference afterwards. During
the press conference Edwards
reviewed the black youth con
ference which he had attended
the day before in Los Angeles,
where the Olympic boycott was
approved.
Edwards, the coordinator of
Black Students for Action at
San Jose State, warned the stu
dent leaders from 150 colleges
that it is up to them to do the
job of providing the racial equal
ity that the government and
civil-rights leaders have failed
to produce. "The militancy, the
urgency, the impatience of the
new black students is something
that must be met," Edwards de
clared. "It makes no difference
whether it is UCLA, Harvard,
Princeton, or San Jose State."
Himself a former track and
basketball star at San Jose State,
Edwards commented on the
hoped for effect of the boycott,
unanimously endorsed by the 50
to 60 sports figures who attend
ed the Los Angeles meeting.
"This is a significant stand be
cause I know of no other group
of people who can make our

feelings known This is our
last chance to avert a racial ca
tastrophe in this country," he
declared.
World-Wide Publicity
Edwards, who summoned the
athletes, said he hoped the boy
cott would have the effect of
presenting the issue of racism in
America either before the United
Nations or the World Court.
"We hope to bring to the
attention of the entire world that
America is as guilty of racism
as South Africa," he said.
Certainly there are those in
the Negro community who dis
agree with Harry Edwards. Over
the weekend a number of famous
Negro athletes voiced strong op
position to the planned boycott.
Jesse Owens, winner of four
gold medals at Berlin in 1936,
commented, "I deplore the use
of the Olympic games by certain
people for political aggrandize
ment. There is no place in the
athletic world for politics."
Doubts Popularity
Ralph Boston, the broad-jump
world record holder, said, "I
don't think this would be the
thing that very many people
would go along with. I'm sure
there are some people that feel
this way, but I'm not one of
them."
Charlie Green, six-time NCAA
sprint champion, commented, "It
comtj down to a matter if you're
an American or not. I'm an
American and I'm going to run."
Muhammad Ali, who won an
Olympic gold medal in 1960, ex
pressed strong support for the
threatened boycott. "Giving up
a chance at the Olympics and
a gold medal is a big sacrifice.
But everything that's designed
to get freedom and equality for
their people, I'm with 1000 per
cent."

were passed urging Negro ath
letes to refuse to participate in
competition with South Africa or
Rhodesia and also in events held
by the New York Athletic Club
The supporters of the boycott
resolutions included UCLA bas
ketball star Lew Alcindor and

San Jose State sprinters Tom
mie Smith and Lee Evans.
Evans, who was a member ol
the team which broke the world
record in the 800-meter relay last
year, said he would not partici
pate in the Games "if it meant
slamming the potential door to
freedom in the face of black
people."
Applause But No Commitment
Edwards made his comments
in a speech to the almost solidly
white Conference of Associated
Student Governments at the St.
Francis Hotel in San Francisco
Friday. His 300 listeners ap
plauded, but quickly issued an
official statement disclaiming ei
ther endorsement or criticism of
Edward's remarks, both during
his speech and also at his
conference afterwards. During
the press conference Edwards
reviewed the black youth con
ference which he had attended
the day before in Los Angeles,
where the Olympic boycott was
approved.
Edwards, the coordinator of
Black Students for Action at
San Jose State, warned the stu
dent leaders from 150 colleges
that it is up to them to do the
job of providing the racial equal
ity that the government and
civil-rights leaders have failed
to produce. "The militancy, the
urgency, the impatience of the
new black students is something
that must be met," Edwards de
clared. "It makes no difference
whether it is UCLA, Harvard,
Princeton, or San Jose State."
Himself a former track and
basketball star at San Jose State,
Edwards commented on the
hoped for effect of the boycott,
unanimously endorsed by the 50
to 60 sports figures who attend
ed the Los Angeles meeting.
"This is a significant stand be
cause I know of no other group
of people who can make our

feelings known This is our
last chance to avert a racial ca
tastrophe in this country," he
declared.
World-Wide Publicity
Edwards, who summoned the
athletes, said he hoped the boy
cott would have the effect of
presenting the issue of racism in
America either before the United
Nations or the World Court.
"We hope to bring to the
attention of the entire world that
America is as guilty of racism
as South Africa," he said.
Certainly there are those in
the Negro community who dis
agree with Harry Edwards. Over
the weekend a number of famous
Negro athletes voiced strong op
position to the planned boycott.
Jesse Owens, winner of four
gold medals at Berlin in 1936,
commented, "I deplore the use
of the Olympic games by certain
people for political aggrandize
ment. There is no place in the
athletic world for politics."
Doubts Popularity
Ralph Boston, the broad-jump
world record holder, said, "I
don't think this would be the
thing that very many people
would go along with. I'm sure
there are some people that feel
this way, but I'm not one of
them."
Charlie Green, six-time NCAA
sprint champion, commented, "It
comtj down to a matter if you're
an American or not. I'm an
American and I'm going to run."
Muhammad Ali, who won an
Olympic gold medal in 1960, ex
pressed strong support for the
threatened boycott. "Giving up
a chance at the Olympics and
a gold medal is a big sacrifice.
But everything that's designed
to get freedom and equality for
their people, I'm with 1000 per
cent."
Payton Jordan, head coach of
the U.S. Olympic Men's Track
and Field Squad as well as of
the Stanford track team, sug
gested last weekend that coer
cion must have been used in the
Olympic boycott movement.
"There must be some coercion
to have an individual who has
worked so long and hard (to
qualify for the Olympics) to
change his mind in the middle
of the stream, but I don't know
all the reasons."
Jordan also expressed regret
"that the liberal loudmouth gets
all the attention, and the person
who speaks rationally is not
heard. ... So few seem to be
ruining it for so many."
Stanford's Jordan will head
the Olympic team of which Har
ry Edwards, an assistant profes
sor of sociology at San Jose
State, has initiated a boycott by
Afro-American athletes.
Boycott Details Announced
Details of the threatened 1968
Olympic boycott were revealed
Friday by Edwards, a 24 year
old Black Power activist and
former track and basketball star
at San Jose State College.
The Negro college teacher,
who compared the United States
to a luxury liner headed for the
rocks of racial discrimination,
described three resolutions
passed at a black youth confer
ence Thanksgiving Day in Los
Angeles.
The principal resolution pro
posed a boycott of the Mexico
City Olympics to be held this
summer. Two other resolutions

urgency, the impatience of the
new black students is something
that must be met," Edwards de
clared. "It makes no difference
whether it is UCLA, Harvard,
Princeton, or San Jose State."
Himself a former track and
basketball star at San Jose State,
Edwards commented on the
hoped for effect of the boycott,
unanimously endorsed by the 50
to 60 sports figures who attend
ed the Los Angeles meeting.
"This is a significant stand be
cause I know of no other group
of people who can make our

feelings known This is our
last chance to avert a racial ca
tastrophe in this country," he
declared.
World-Wide Publicity
Edwards, who summoned the
athletes, said he hoped the boy
cott would have the effect of
presenting the issue of racism in
America either before the United
Nations or the World Court.
"We hope to bring to the
attention of the entire world that
America is as guilty of racism
as South Africa," he said.
Certainly there are those in
the Negro community who dis
agree with Harry Edwards. Over
the weekend a number of famous
Negro athletes voiced strong op
position to the planned boycott.
Jesse Owens, winner of four
gold medals at Berlin in 1936,
commented, "I deplore the use
of the Olympic games by certain
people for political aggrandize
ment. There is no place in the
athletic world for politics."
Doubts Popularity
Ralph Boston, the broad-jump
world record holder, said, "I
don't think this would be the
thing that very many people
would go along with. I'm sure
there are some people that feel
this way, but I'm not one of
them."
Charlie Green, six-time NCAA
sprint champion, commented, "It
comtj down to a matter if you're
an American or not. I'm an
American and I'm going to run."
Muhammad Ali, who won an
Olympic gold medal in 1960, ex
pressed strong support for the
threatened boycott. "Giving up
a chance at the Olympics and
a gold medal is a big sacrifice.
But everything that's designed
to get freedom and equality for
their people, I'm with 1000 per
cent."
Payton Jordan, head coach of
the U.S. Olympic Men's Track
and Field Squad as well as of
the Stanford track team, sug
gested last weekend that coer
cion must have been used in the
Olympic boycott movement.
"There must be some coercion
to have an individual who has
worked so long and hard (to
qualify for the Olympics) to
change his mind in the middle
of the stream, but I don't know
all the reasons."
Jordan also expressed regret
"that the liberal loudmouth gets
all the attention, and the person
who speaks rationally is not
heard. ... So few seem to be
ruining it for so many."
Stanford's Jordan will head
the Olympic team of which Har
ry Edwards, an assistant profes
sor of sociology at San Jose
State, has initiated a boycott by
Afro-American athletes.
Boycott Details Announced
Details of the threatened 1968
Olympic boycott were revealed
Friday by Edwards, a 24 year
old Black Power activist and
former track and basketball star
at San Jose State College.
The Negro college teacher,
who compared the United States
to a luxury liner headed for the
rocks of racial discrimination,
described three resolutions
passed at a black youth confer
ence Thanksgiving Day in Los
Angeles.
The principal resolution pro
posed a boycott of the Mexico
City Olympics to be held this
summer. Two other resolutions
were passed urging Negro ath
letes to refuse to participate in
competition with South Africa or
Rhodesia and also in events held
by the New York Athletic Club
The supporters of the boycott
resolutions included UCLA bas
ketball star Lew Alcindor and

San Jose State sprinters Tom
mie Smith and Lee Evans.
Evans, who was a member ol
the team which broke the world
record in the 800-meter relay last
year, said he would not partici
pate in the Games "if it meant
slamming the potential door to
freedom in the face of black
people."
Applause But No Commitment
Edwards made his comments
in a speech to the almost solidly
white Conference of Associated
Student Governments at the St.
Francis Hotel in San Francisco
Friday. His 300 listeners ap
plauded, but quickly issued an
official statement disclaiming ei
ther endorsement or criticism of
Edward's remarks, both during
his speech and also at his
conference afterwards. During
the press conference Edwards
reviewed the black youth con
ference which he had attended
the day before in Los Angeles,
where the Olympic boycott was
approved.
Edwards, the coordinator of
Black Students for Action at
San Jose State, warned the stu
dent leaders from 150 colleges
that it is up to them to do the
job of providing the racial equal
ity that the government and
civil-rights leaders have failed
to produce. "The militancy, the
urgency, the impatience of the
new black students is something
that must be met," Edwards de
clared. "It makes no difference
