A statement attacking resis
tance movement groups has been
signed by 3251 students and fac
ulty of San Francisco State Col
lege and sent to the president
of the college. The statement hits
groups attempting to prevent on
campus recruiting by defense
industries and the Armed Forces.
Cal'ing themselves the "silent
center," the Students to Keep
Campus Open say they are pro
testing "the intimidation, eoer

cion and violence that has been
occurring on our campus."
The statement asks the college
administration to "protect the
rights of individual students to
participate in on-campus func
tions without the physical inter
ference of students or non-stu
dents." Such "functions" inrlude
recruiting by the Armed Forces,
the CIA, Dow Chemical and
Boeing Aircraft.

The 3251 statements were col
lected in four days early in No
vember. In their statement the
students state that they "respect
the right of dissent on the cam
pus, but regard force and vio
lent methods to be incompatible
with the freedom of the college
and the rights of the students."
The students also said, "Three
thousand of us request a more
positive attitude on the part of

you [the president of the col
lege], the faculty and the ad
ministration toward equal rights
for all members of the student
body. We demand a more posi
tive attitude in this respect from
our fellow students."
"There are thousands of us
here who feel the some aggres
sive student and faculty groups
have gone too far in their dis
regard of our rights in order to
further their own causes."
