To Seek A Newer World, by
the failure of enshrined policy when necessary, dare
to try bold new approaches that keep pace with "the
whirlwind of change and hope and progress."
The question is simple, but our problems are awe
some and complex. As Senator Kennedy states a few
of them:
"We are the most powerful nation on earth;
yet our young men struggle and many die in a
war in a small, far-off country where our power
often seems impotent.
"We have passed civil rights legislation of a
reach and detail unknown since the Civil War;
yet never has there been a greater sense of alien
ation and more open hostility between the races.
"We have found material wealth far beyond
our dreams of a feiv years ago; yet perhaps we
count the wrong things, for the forms of new
wealth seem to destroy as many pleasures as they
give."
These, and other problems among peoples, countries,
and generations, cannot be dealt with in generalities.
To Seek A Newer World is filled with Senator Ken
nedy's specific recommendations for legislative and
executive action . . . and for your individual action.
Significantly, the book begins with an appeal to, and
on behalf of, youth.
"The gap between generations will never be
completely closed. Rut it must be spanned: for
the bridge across the generations is essential to
the nation in the present; and more, it is the
bridge to our own future —.and thus in a central
sense, to the very meaning 'of our own lives . . .
"Today's young people ... demand a limitation
upon excessive power. They demand a political
system that preserves the sense of community
among men. They demand a government that
speaks directly and honestly to its citizens."
It is Senator Kennedy's clear-cut demonstration that
these goals are possible — through joint and personal
effort — that makes To Seek A Newer World one of
this decade's most important and wide-ranging state
ments of national strategy and purpose.
