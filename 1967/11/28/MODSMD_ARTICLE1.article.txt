Wilbur guest-in-residence and
Philippine Senator Raul S.
Manglapus will speak this after
noon at 4:15 in Tresidder large
lounge.
Manglapus was elected to the
Philippine Senate in 1961 with
the largest percentage of votes
ever given to a senatorial can
didate there, but this July an
nounced his retirement from
Philippine politics.
The Manila Chronicle claimed
his retirement was the result of
"galling frustrations with the
way we practice our politics and
of deep disenchantment with the
conduct of our leading politi
cians."
Manglapus arrived in San
Francisco Sunday after remain
ing in the Philippines for the
elections which elected his suc
cessor. The election was one of
"mud-slinging, slanders, and
falsehood" according to the Ma

nila Bulletin.
As a guest-in-residence Mangla
pus will live at Wilbur Hall
through Friday and will eat
meeds in the Wilbur Houses and
in the Stern demonstration
houses.
On Thursday he will lead a
discussion at the I-Center at 4
p.m. During the week he will
also be the guest of the Profes
sional Journalism Fellows and
the Philippine students for meals
and discussions. He will be avail
able all week for informal dis
cussions with students.
Before announcing his retire
ment, Manglapus was offered a
choice of three positions by
Philippine President F. Marcos:
ambassador to the United Na
tions, ambassador to the United
States, and secretary of foreign
affairs. He turned them down be
cause of basic differences he has
with the Philippine administra
tion, notably on the issues of
Vietnam and decentralization.
Throughout his political ca
reer, he has emphasized that his
political philosophy could not
find a vehicle for his dissatis
faction with the party structure
of Philippine politics. He has felt
his political philosophy could
not find a vehicle when both
established parties are landlord
dominated and share the same
ideology.
In 1965 he led the formation
of a new political party primari
ly among the university students

and the urban middle class. The
party, called the Party for Philip
pine Progress, declared a pro
gram of social justice and aim
ed at the spread of wealth and
political party.
He was the party's unanimous
choice for presidential candidate
in the 1965 elections, but as ex
pected, the new party lost to the
two established political ma
chines.
In the senate, Manglapus has
been responsible for legislation
enlarging the freedom, power,
the authority and responsibility
of local governments. His great
est achievement was his fight for
the approval of a land reform
bill in 1963. He is credited with
saving the bill from emascula
tion by the powerful representa
tives of the landlord class in the
Philippine Congress.
President Marcos, in a state
ment about Manglapus' resigna
tion, stated "his disengagement
from public life will deprive the
government service of a man of
great usefulness in view of his
high qualification for any elec
tive or executive position."
Manglapus, 49, first served in
the Philippine government when
the last President Ramon Mag
saysay appointed him Undersec
retary of Foreign Affairs in 1953.
He served as Secretary General
of the Manila Conference of 1954
which established SEATO.

When Magsaysay died in 1957,
Manglapus became acting Sec
retary of Foreign Affairs, the
youngest ever to occupy that
position.
