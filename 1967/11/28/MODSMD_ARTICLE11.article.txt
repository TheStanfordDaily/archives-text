## Cesare As President 
### 
Cesare Massarenti became ASSU president
Sunday. He was not surprised by Peter Lyman's
resignation, but had talked to Lyman several
times about the decision.
When Lyman finally decided over the weekÂ«
end to resign, Massarenti stood ready and was
quickly at work yesterday to formulate plans and
gather supporters for his programs.
Massarenti was ready to step into the office of
ASSU president. But in doing so, he faced sev
eral initial and serious problems.
His first task must be to gain the confidence of
the student body, for on several instances he has
outraged many students. In the November 16
LASSU meeting he shocked many by criticizing
the band and pompon girls for disrupting the
meeting to lead cheers and songs.
It was not that Massarenti's remark was that
radical or upsetting, for it was no doubt felt by
many, but he said what he felt, and enraged
many. Massarenti has to build trust and support
among students, faculty and administrators.
This will be his first and hardest task. If he can
not do that, he will be as ineffective as was his
predecessor, for though he may not agree with
those he must deal with, he does have to work
through and with them for the vital reforms he
and Lyman outlined last spring.
Massarenti's style is flamboyant and abrupt.
His approaches are not always well-reasoned
and his solutions often involve drastic and far
reaching changes.
But this last characteristic may well prove his

greatest asset. The chaotic state of the Associated
Students would need massive reorganization
even if the body had all the powers it needed
and wanted. The present uncertainty about the
status of the Judicial Council is but one evidence
of the need for restructuring.
Much more important is the need for a re
definition and expansion of the power students
hold. Massarenti must strive to involve students
formally and informally in as many areas and
functions of the University as possible.
There are many opportunities now in the bal
ance. The establishment of the SES student ad
visory committee is an important first step for
Massarenti. He also must carry through the ne
gotiations with the administration to secure stu
dent representation on university advisory com
mittees that have never had student representa
tion before.
But just as the main focus of student activism
has passed from representation on committees
to securing effective decision-making power, so
the efforts this year must secure more power for
students, within or without the structure of the
Associated Students.
We feel the structure of the ASSU is anti
quated and powerless, and as such, will continue
to find it hard to hold a president. However, if
the president can, through a concerted effort to
alter that structure, endow students with sig
nificant power, he will have succeeded as a stu
dent president. By this shall we judge Cesare
Massarenti.
