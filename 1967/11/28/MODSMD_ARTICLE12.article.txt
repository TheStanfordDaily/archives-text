## Lyman's Resignation 'Demoralizing' 
### 
Editor, the Dally:
Peter Lyman's confession of
inability to implement his phil
osophy of "community govern
ment" has demoralizing impli
cations for those students who
seek to make government and
academic education at Stanford
relevant.
The "call to arms," in the
days of Harris and Lyman
should have been, as it must
be now, the right of students
to have influence comparable to
their interest on important mat
ters.
But, most Stanford students
will not be activists, while they
are preoccupied with academic
survival in a harshly competitive
environment.
Peter Lyman was respectable
to the Administration. So were
his ideas .until they eventually
shed themselves of their nebu
lous nature and the threat of
their substance was evident:
that the student voice be heard
in various areas of University
policy, totally beyond the con
fines of present student govern
ment, that shared decision-mak
ing replace paternalism at the
University level.

That Mr. Lyman was unpre
pared to carry the burden of
this demand to a clear-cut con
frontation with the Adminis
tration casts a pessimistic spell
on current Legislature efforts
to define various student roles
and to gain acceptance for
their definitions.
It is unlikely that the student
body shall take up his task or
that the few remaining individ
uals shall have the endurance
to sustain the contest against
bureaucratic power.

Editor, the Daily:
And where are we now? The
University lives on, the adminis
tration of the students minus
one more leader. Is it wisdom
which drives a soft-spoken ideal
ist and visionary from the seem
ingly impossible realm of poli
tics? Or is it lack of strength?
The defection of a man who
feels there is no meeting ground
between his ideas and his posi
tion would seem to have little
effect on his society; especially
if he is correct in thinking he
can do nothing more. Perhaps
he cannot do much in terms of
obvious, tangible action; does
this mean that he has no pur
pose?
I feel robbed of a leader, but
more significantly, robbed of
the very important element of
faith. No one man can be called
to answer for the impossibilities
inherent in politics. But for a
final loss of hope on the part
of some students, Peter Lyman
is responsible.

Editor, The Daily:
This is an earnest appeal for
moral and material support
of the student protest movement
here in Heidelberg.
America has noted with grow
ing concern the expansion of
the right-wing NPD throughout
Germany. But few know that
the most significant counter
force to this neo-Nazi sentiment
is the liberal movement among
German University students.
Students here in Heidelberg
are notoriously poor; their poli
tical organizations are badly
equipped. They have only them
selves to depend on. thev
speak out against war or politi
cal decadence, they are perse
cuted by municipal authorities.
They do have good ideas, and
strong feelings about war, and
the willingness to sacrifice their
studies, and they are courageous.
But courage and conviction must
be communicated effectively.
The students here need a
means of printing their own
notices and circulars; they need
walkie-talkies to keep their dem
onstrations and marches togeth
er; they need amplifiers and
loudspeakers (or at least elec
trical megaphones).
You can help by writing let
ters of protest to the Mayor of
Heidelberg (Oberburgermeister
Zundel, 69 Heidelberg, West Ger
many) and to the Jtektor of the
University (Professor Doktor
Margot Becke, Ruprecht • Karl -
Universitat, 69 Heidelberg, West
Germany).
If you wish to contribute
either money or equipment to
the student organizations, you
may send it directly to me or
you may let me know of your

intentions and I will provide the
name and address of some par
ticular group.

Editor, The Daily:
Bob Fishman's column of No
vember 27, "Join the Dow
Team," sacrifices perspective and
truth to bias and emotionalism
to such an extent that it fails
even to qualify as acceptable
satire.
Dow's sales of napalm account
for less than 1% of its revenues.
Granted, that's a lot of napalm,
but children's aspirin, Lirugen
(common measles vaccine) and
caustic soda are each more im
portant to Dow, and interest in
these products would have been
more impressive to the inter
viewer. To assert that "in the
Dow family . . . making napalm
. . . (is) a way of life" is not
only inaccurate and incriminat
ing, but in such bad taste as to
loose all resemblance to the
Buchwald style that the writer
was apeing.
I submit that if Mr. Fishman's
article was intended as news ana
lysis, it missed the point, and no
one who gets its point will think
the intent was simply to be hu
morous or entertaining. As a
bittersweet comment on the type
of people who would consider
working for Dow it most closely
approximates fantasy, and as
such the judgment as to wheth
er or not it belongs in the Daily
depends on one's opinion of tho
paper.

Bob Fishman's column of No
vember 27, "Join the Dow
Team," sacrifices perspective and
truth to bias and emotionalism
to such an extent that it fails
even to qualify as acceptable
satire.
Dow's sales of napalm account
for less than 1% of its revenues.
Granted, that's a lot of napalm,
but children's aspirin, Lirugen
(common measles vaccine) and
caustic soda are each more im
portant to Dow, and interest in
these products would have been
more impressive to the inter
viewer. To assert that "in the
Dow family . . . making napalm
. . . (is) a way of life" is not
only inaccurate and incriminat
ing, but in such bad taste as to
loose all resemblance to the
Buchwald style that the writer
was apeing.
I submit that if Mr. Fishman's

Peter Lyman's confession of
inability to implement his phil
osophy of "community govern
ment" has demoralizing impli
cations for those students who
seek to make government and
academic education at Stanford
relevant.
The "call to arms," in the
days of Harris and Lyman
should have been, as it must
be now, the right of students
to have influence comparable to
their interest on important mat
ters.
But, most Stanford students
will not be activists, while they
are preoccupied with academic
survival in a harshly competitive
environment.
Peter Lyman was respectable
to the Administration. So were
his ideas .until they eventually
shed themselves of their nebu
lous nature and the threat of
their substance was evident:
that the student voice be heard
in various areas of University
policy, totally beyond the con
fines of present student govern
ment, that shared decision-mak
ing replace paternalism at the
University level.

That Mr. Lyman was unpre
pared to carry the burden of
this demand to a clear-cut con
frontation with the Adminis
tration casts a pessimistic spell
on current Legislature efforts
to define various student roles
and to gain acceptance for
their definitions.
It is unlikely that the student
body shall take up his task or
that the few remaining individ
uals shall have the endurance
to sustain the contest against
bureaucratic power.

And where are we now? The
University lives on, the adminis
tration of the students minus
one more leader. Is it wisdom
which drives a soft-spoken ideal
ist and visionary from the seem
ingly impossible realm of poli
tics? Or is it lack of strength?
The defection of a man who
feels there is no meeting ground
between his ideas and his posi
tion would seem to have little
effect on his society; especially
if he is correct in thinking he
can do nothing more. Perhaps
he cannot do much in terms of
obvious, tangible action; does
this mean that he has no pur
pose?
I feel robbed of a leader, but
more significantly, robbed of
the very important element of
faith. No one man can be called

inherent in politics. But for a
final loss of hope on the part
of some students, Peter Lyman

This is an earnest appeal for
moral and material support
of the student protest movement
here in Heidelberg.
America has noted with grow
ing concern the expansion of
the right-wing NPD throughout
Germany. But few know that
the most significant counter
force to this neo-Nazi sentiment
is the liberal movement among
German University students.
Students here in Heidelberg
are notoriously poor; their poli
tical organizations are badly
equipped. They have only them
selves to depend on. thev
speak out against war or politi
cal decadence, they are perse
cuted by municipal authorities.
They do have good ideas, and
strong feelings about war, and
the willingness to sacrifice their
studies, and they are courageous.
But courage and conviction must
be communicated effectively.
The students here need a
means of printing their own
notices and circulars; they need
walkie-talkies to keep their dem
onstrations and marches togeth
er; they need amplifiers and
loudspeakers (or at least elec
trical megaphones).
You can help by writing let
ters of protest to the Mayor of
Heidelberg (Oberburgermeister
Zundel, 69 Heidelberg, West Ger
many) and to the Jtektor of the
University (Professor Doktor

This is an earnest appeal for
moral and material support
of the student protest movement
here in Heidelberg.
America has noted with grow
ing concern the expansion of
the right-wing NPD throughout
Germany. But few know that
the most significant counter
force to this neo-Nazi sentiment
is the liberal movement among
German University students.
Students here in Heidelberg
are notoriously poor; their poli
tical organizations are badly
equipped. They have only them
selves to depend on. thev
speak out against war or politi
cal decadence, they are perse
cuted by municipal authorities.
They do have good ideas, and
strong feelings about war, and
the willingness to sacrifice their
studies, and they are courageous.
But courage and conviction must
be communicated effectively.
The students here need a
means of printing their own
notices and circulars; they need
walkie-talkies to keep their dem
onstrations and marches togeth
er; they need amplifiers and
loudspeakers (or at least elec
trical megaphones).
You can help by writing let
ters of protest to the Mayor of
Heidelberg (Oberburgermeister
Zundel, 69 Heidelberg, West Ger
many) and to the Jtektor of the
University (Professor Doktor
Margot Becke, Ruprecht • Karl -
Universitat, 69 Heidelberg, West
Germany).
If you wish to contribute
either money or equipment to
the student organizations, you
may send it directly to me or
you may let me know of your

intentions and I will provide the
name and address of some par
ticular group.

Bob Fishman's column of No
vember 27, "Join the Dow
Team," sacrifices perspective and
truth to bias and emotionalism
to such an extent that it fails
even to qualify as acceptable
satire.
Dow's sales of napalm account
for less than 1% of its revenues.
Granted, that's a lot of napalm,
but children's aspirin, Lirugen
(common measles vaccine) and
caustic soda are each more im
portant to Dow, and interest in
these products would have been
more impressive to the inter
viewer. To assert that "in the
Dow family . . . making napalm
. . . (is) a way of life" is not
only inaccurate and incriminat
ing, but in such bad taste as to
loose all resemblance to the
Buchwald style that the writer
was apeing.
I submit that if Mr. Fishman's
article was intended as news ana
lysis, it missed the point, and no
one who gets its point will think
the intent was simply to be hu
morous or entertaining. As a
bittersweet comment on the type
of people who would consider
working for Dow it most closely
approximates fantasy, and as

Peter Lyman's confession of
inability to implement his phil
osophy of "community govern
ment" has demoralizing impli
cations for those students who
seek to make government and
academic education at Stanford
relevant.
The "call to arms," in the
days of Harris and Lyman
should have been, as it must
be now, the right of students
to have influence comparable to
their interest on important mat
ters.
But, most Stanford students
will not be activists, while they
are preoccupied with academic
survival in a harshly competitive
environment.
Peter Lyman was respectable
to the Administration. So were
his ideas .until they eventually
shed themselves of their nebu
lous nature and the threat of
their substance was evident:
that the student voice be heard
in various areas of University
policy, totally beyond the con
fines of present student govern
ment, that shared decision-mak
ing replace paternalism at the
University level.

That Mr. Lyman was unpre
pared to carry the burden of
this demand to a clear-cut con
frontation with the Adminis
tration casts a pessimistic spell
on current Legislature efforts
to define various student roles
and to gain acceptance for
their definitions.
It is unlikely that the student
body shall take up his task or
that the few remaining individ
uals shall have the endurance
to sustain the contest against
bureaucratic power.

And where are we now? The
University lives on, the adminis
tration of the students minus
one more leader. Is it wisdom
which drives a soft-spoken ideal
ist and visionary from the seem
ingly impossible realm of poli
tics? Or is it lack of strength?
The defection of a man who
feels there is no meeting ground
between his ideas and his posi
tion would seem to have little
effect on his society; especially
if he is correct in thinking he
can do nothing more. Perhaps
he cannot do much in terms of
obvious, tangible action; does
this mean that he has no pur
pose?
I feel robbed of a leader, but
more significantly, robbed of
the very important element of
faith. No one man can be called
to answer for the impossibilities
inherent in politics. But for a
final loss of hope on the part
