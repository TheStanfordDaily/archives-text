# In Glass Houses
## Goodnight Peterâ€”Goodnight! Cesare? 
### Robert E. Stone 
Peter Lyman has resigned. In
a moment of sparkling lucidity
he realized he was a babe in the
woods, a pawn in the hands of
the administration, an idealist
in a real world. The realization
must have been awful, but no
problem is so complicated that
it can't be run away from. Peter
ran away.
In his resignation statement,
Lyman said, "A hollow, bureau
cratic process, the student gov
ernment as presently constituted
is incapable of representing or
contributing to an intellectual
community." I won't argue with
that statement; I can't.
Lyman continues, however, "I
am resigning not only because
the bureaucratic structure of
student government contradicts
the goals I campaigned for, but
because I hope to open to de
bate the question of the function
and purpose of student govern
ment in the University, and to
raise the possibility of organiz
ing a student government which
would play a truly responsible
role within the academic com
munity." All very commendable,
but . . .
In A Better Position
But I would think that a far
better position to be in to raise
these questions would be student
body president, not John Q. Stu
dent.
In any event,"the ship of
state" must go one. New hands
have assumed the helm and a
new eye is fixed on Lyman's dis
tant goal. According to Cesare
Massarenti, Lyman's constitu
tional successor, "the people
have changed, not the ideas."
This, too, is idealism, or if you
prefer, complete absence of re
alism. For while Lyman's and
Massarenti's goals may be the
same, their ideas on how to
achieve those goals are widely
divergent.
In resigning, Lyman said,
"Conflict is the only way stu
dents are going to get anything
done." His resignation indicates
that he was not willing to resort
to conflict to achieve his aims.
Massarenti obviously is.
Prepared To Do Battle
Massarenti is willing to battle
directly with the Dean of Stu
dents office in order to attain
his goal. He shares with Lyman
the belief that a truly effective
student can only exist outside
the administrative structure of
the university.
At times his frustration at the

hands of University officialdom
has resulted in paranoiac tirades
about persecution. But even
paranoids have real enemies, and
if Massarenti wants to make a
list of his, he should put him
self right up on top.
As cliche-y as it may sound,
Massarenti is his own worst
enemy. I cannot begin to criti
cize his ultimate goal. It is the
same one that I have called for
time and time again in this
column. I can and do, however,
criticize the means for attaining
that goal, especially the unreal
ity of those means.

The administration of this Uni
versity is a firmly entrenched,
necessary evil. They are not,
however, machines. They do, in
the long run, have the best in
terests of the entire community
at heart.
It's Unreal
Admittedly some administra
tors are more interested in stu
dent problems than others, but
any degree of concern they wish
to express is one that students
should be thankful for.
The way to effect change is
not by frontal assault. The ad
ministrators do have a vested

interest, and while it is true that
there would be no University
without students, it is also true
that there would be no students
without the University.
Attrition, then, is the pass
word to success. Changes will
not come easily or quickly. It
will be a slow, hard process of
chipping away tradition. To suc
ceed requires a coordinated ef
fort on the parts of all involved,
but more important is the need
for a man of courage and stam
ina to lead the fight.
Lyman wasn't the man to do
the job. Neither is Massarenti.

problem is so complicated that
it can't be run away from. Peter
ran away.
In his resignation statement,
Lyman said, "A hollow, bureau
cratic process, the student gov
ernment as presently constituted
is incapable of representing or
contributing to an intellectual
community." I won't argue with
that statement; I can't.
Lyman continues, however, "I
am resigning not only because
the bureaucratic structure of
student government contradicts
the goals I campaigned for, but
because I hope to open to de
bate the question of the function
and purpose of student govern
ment in the University, and to
raise the possibility of organiz
ing a student government which
would play a truly responsible
role within the academic com
munity." All very commendable,
but . . .
In A Better Position
But I would think that a far
better position to be in to raise
these questions would be student
body president, not John Q. Stu
dent.
In any event,"the ship of
state" must go one. New hands
have assumed the helm and a
new eye is fixed on Lyman's dis
tant goal. According to Cesare
Massarenti, Lyman's constitu
tional successor, "the people
have changed, not the ideas."
This, too, is idealism, or if you
prefer, complete absence of re
alism. For while Lyman's and
Massarenti's goals may be the
same, their ideas on how to
achieve those goals are widely
divergent.
In resigning, Lyman said,
"Conflict is the only way stu
dents are going to get anything
done." His resignation indicates
that he was not willing to resort
to conflict to achieve his aims.
Massarenti obviously is.
Prepared To Do Battle
Massarenti is willing to battle
directly with the Dean of Stu
dents office in order to attain
his goal. He shares with Lyman
the belief that a truly effective
student can only exist outside
the administrative structure of
the university.
At times his frustration at the

hands of University officialdom
has resulted in paranoiac tirades
about persecution. But even
paranoids have real enemies, and
if Massarenti wants to make a
list of his, he should put him
self right up on top.
As cliche-y as it may sound,
Massarenti is his own worst
enemy. I cannot begin to criti
cize his ultimate goal. It is the
same one that I have called for
time and time again in this
column. I can and do, however,
criticize the means for attaining
that goal, especially the unreal
ity of those means.

The administration of this Uni
versity is a firmly entrenched,
necessary evil. They are not,
however, machines. They do, in
the long run, have the best in
terests of the entire community
at heart.
It's Unreal
Admittedly some administra
tors are more interested in stu
dent problems than others, but
any degree of concern they wish
to express is one that students
should be thankful for.
The way to effect change is
not by frontal assault. The ad
ministrators do have a vested

interest, and while it is true that
there would be no University
without students, it is also true
that there would be no students
without the University.
Attrition, then, is the pass
word to success. Changes will
not come easily or quickly. It
will be a slow, hard process of
chipping away tradition. To suc
ceed requires a coordinated ef
fort on the parts of all involved,
but more important is the need
for a man of courage and stam
ina to lead the fight.
Lyman wasn't the man to do
the job. Neither is Massarenti.
Peter Lyman has resigned. In
a moment of sparkling lucidity
he realized he was a babe in the
woods, a pawn in the hands of
the administration, an idealist
in a real world. The realization
must have been awful, but no
problem is so complicated that
it can't be run away from. Peter
ran away.
