# Football On The Old Farm
## 
### TIM ABENA ANDY CARRIGAN 
Several member of the Stan
ford football team were quite
surprised and upset Wednesday
morning, November 22, after
reading the inane babblings of
one Robert Stone and of Stan
ford's favorite "Monday morn
ing quarterback," Gil Berkeley
Jr., in that date's edition of the
Daily. Both articles were unwar
ranted slashes at Coach John
Ralston and his football pro
gram here on the Farm.
Normally we would hesitate
to comment on these ill-founded
articles as they do not merit
such attention. However, it is
quite possible that there exists
in this troubled, intellectual en
vironment people who know
considerably less about football,
first downs and coaching than
even Berkeley or Stone. If this
is true, then it is quite con
ceivable that these same people
might place credulence in the
words of these two "football
experts."
Our advice to you Mr. Stone,
is simply this: It is great to
be witty, sardonic and so on.
It is even lots of fun. But it
would be much more meaning
ful to everyone, including your
self, if your witticism was cen
tered around a topic that you
knew something about. Not
only are you totally ignorant
of your subject, but you also
lack originality in your presen
tation. We suggest that you di
rect your efforts to some other
area, perhaps marbles, nuclear
physics, or semething.
Write To John McKay
As for you, Gil Berkeley, Jr.;
we advise you to write a letter
to John McKay at USC and find
out just what he actually does
know about the Stanford foot
ball program.
Then write a letter to your
self asking what you really
know about Stanford football;
about practices, game strategy
and the endless hours of plan
ning that take place in the
coaches office during the course
of a year. You will find that you
know very little about the situ
ation and that you are in no
position to call Coach John Ral
ston a "lousy coach" as you
did in your recent letter to the
Daily.
In defense of Coach Ralston '
we would like to point out sev
eral facts concerning his per
formance as presented in an edi
torial appearing in the Palo
Alto Times on November 15 of
this year.
Respected Position
"At the time John Ralston
assumed the position of head
football coach at Stanford, the
game here was at a very low
level. The five seasons preceding
1963 had produced only 14 vic
tories and not a single .500 sea
son.
"Ralston thus far has had
only one campaign below the 1
.500 mark and that was in his
beginning year." Through his
efforts, the Indians have posted
a 16-13-1 record over the past
three seasons, defeated Cal in
four of five Big Games and have
risen to a place of respect
among the nation's football
powers.
This has been accomplished
in spite of several obstacles.
Rigorous Standards
To begin with, only a small
percentage of athletes qualify
for admission to Stanford,
whose academic requirements
are the highest of any school in
the West. Certainly the other
notable football powers on the
Pacific Coast have no such
handicap in recruiting athletes.
Ralston has also had to strug-

gle constantly to overcome cer
tain financial restrictions result
ing from a limited budget.
Finally, diversified interests
on the part of many Stanford
football players have caused a
problem in generating intense
team desire, spirit and pride:
ingredients absolutely essential
to building a great team.
Drink, Team Drink!
Football coaches can only do
so much. They cannot play on
Saturday. The old saying, "you
can lead a horse to water, but
you cannot make him drink,"
applies here. John Ralston and
his staff have led their horses
to water, but not enough of
them have taken a drink. Each
individual player must decide
on his own that he will give his
maximum effort in every situ
ation throughout the season.
This has not been done in the
past and is the greatest cause of
Stanford's football mediocrity.
In the future this individual
attitude must be present so that
the Indians can become the
great team that they are cap
able of becoming. Only then will
Coach Ralston and his fine staff
be recognized by everyone for
the outstanding ability that they
possess as coaches and the un
ending efforts that they have
expended.

Referring again to the article
in the Palo Alto Times, "one
only need to look at Ara Par
seghian, an excellent and out
standing coach, who while at
Northwestern, a private institu
tion with similar handicaps
could never win the Big Ten,
produce an undefeated team, or
have a record that was even
much better than five hundred."
Excellent Accomplishments
People close to the Stanford
football program who know the
entire situation, unlike Berkeley
and Stone, already recognize
the excellent accomplishments
of Coach Ralston and his staff.
In conclusion, we as players
do not complain about the re
cruiting difficulties created by
our University's high academic
standards. We do not complain
about our department's limited
financial support, nor the few
other inherent weaknesses in
the football program.
These are not the factors
keeping our team from great
ness. Rather the problem lies
within ourselves. We, the play
ers, must accept the necessary
responsibility and assume the
necessary leadership in 1968;
things that we have failed to
do for the past five years.
We owe this much to our
coaches.

you cannot make him drink,"
applies here. John Ralston and
his staff have led their horses
to water, but not enough of
them have taken a drink. Each
individual player must decide
on his own that he will give his
maximum effort in every situ
ation throughout the season.
This has not been done in the
past and is the greatest cause of
Stanford's football mediocrity.
In the future this individual
attitude must be present so that
the Indians can become the
great team that they are cap
able of becoming. Only then will
Coach Ralston and his fine staff
be recognized by everyone for
the outstanding ability that they
possess as coaches and the un
ending efforts that they have
expended.

Referring again to the article
in the Palo Alto Times, "one
only need to look at Ara Par
seghian, an excellent and out
standing coach, who while at
Northwestern, a private institu
tion with similar handicaps
could never win the Big Ten,
produce an undefeated team, or
have a record that was even
much better than five hundred."
Excellent Accomplishments
People close to the Stanford
football program who know the
entire situation, unlike Berkeley
and Stone, already recognize
the excellent accomplishments
of Coach Ralston and his staff.
In conclusion, we as players
do not complain about the re
cruiting difficulties created by
our University's high academic
standards. We do not complain
about our department's limited
financial support, nor the few
other inherent weaknesses in
the football program.
These are not the factors
keeping our team from great
ness. Rather the problem lies
within ourselves. We, the play
ers, must accept the necessary
responsibility and assume the
necessary leadership in 1968;
things that we have failed to
do for the past five years.
We owe this much to our
coaches.
Several member of the Stan
ford football team were quite
surprised and upset Wednesday
morning, November 22, after
reading the inane babblings of
one Robert Stone and of Stan
ford's favorite "Monday morn
ing quarterback," Gil Berkeley
Jr., in that date's edition of the
Daily. Both articles were unwar
ranted slashes at Coach John
Ralston and his football pro
gram here on the Farm.
Normally we would hesitate
to comment on these ill-founded
articles as they do not merit
such attention. However, it is
quite possible that there exists
in this troubled, intellectual en
vironment people who know
considerably less about football,
first downs and coaching than
even Berkeley or Stone. If this
is true, then it is quite con
ceivable that these same people
might place credulence in the
words of these two "football
experts."
Our advice to you Mr. Stone,
is simply this: It is great to
be witty, sardonic and so on.
It is even lots of fun. But it
would be much more meaning
ful to everyone, including your
self, if your witticism was cen
tered around a topic that you
knew something about. Not
only are you totally ignorant
of your subject, but you also
lack originality in your presen
tation. We suggest that you di
rect your efforts to some other
area, perhaps marbles, nuclear
physics, or semething.
Write To John McKay
As for you, Gil Berkeley, Jr.;
we advise you to write a letter
to John McKay at USC and find
out just what he actually does
know about the Stanford foot
ball program.
Then write a letter to your
self asking what you really
know about Stanford football;
about practices, game strategy
and the endless hours of plan
ning that take place in the
coaches office during the course
of a year. You will find that you
know very little about the situ
ation and that you are in no
position to call Coach John Ral
ston a "lousy coach" as you
did in your recent letter to the
Daily.
In defense of Coach Ralston '
we would like to point out sev
eral facts concerning his per
formance as presented in an edi
torial appearing in the Palo
Alto Times on November 15 of
this year.
Respected Position
"At the time John Ralston
assumed the position of head
football coach at Stanford, the
game here was at a very low
level. The five seasons preceding
1963 had produced only 14 vic
tories and not a single .500 sea
son.
"Ralston thus far has had
only one campaign below the 1
.500 mark and that was in his
beginning year." Through his
efforts, the Indians have posted
a 16-13-1 record over the past
three seasons, defeated Cal in
four of five Big Games and have
risen to a place of respect
among the nation's football
powers.
This has been accomplished
in spite of several obstacles.
Rigorous Standards
To begin with, only a small
percentage of athletes qualify
for admission to Stanford,
whose academic requirements
are the highest of any school in
the West. Certainly the other
notable football powers on the
Pacific Coast have no such
handicap in recruiting athletes.
Ralston has also had to strug-

gle constantly to overcome cer
tain financial restrictions result
ing from a limited budget.
Finally, diversified interests
on the part of many Stanford
football players have caused a
problem in generating intense
team desire, spirit and pride:
ingredients absolutely essential
to building a great team.
Drink, Team Drink!
Football coaches can only do
so much. They cannot play on
Saturday. The old saying, "you

position to call Coach John Ral
ston a "lousy coach" as you
did in your recent letter to the
Daily.
In defense of Coach Ralston '
we would like to point out sev
eral facts concerning his per
formance as presented in an edi
torial appearing in the Palo
Alto Times on November 15 of
this year.
Respected Position
"At the time John Ralston
assumed the position of head
football coach at Stanford, the
game here was at a very low
level. The five seasons preceding
1963 had produced only 14 vic
tories and not a single .500 sea
son.
"Ralston thus far has had
only one campaign below the 1
.500 mark and that was in his
beginning year." Through his
efforts, the Indians have posted
a 16-13-1 record over the past
three seasons, defeated Cal in
four of five Big Games and have
risen to a place of respect
among the nation's football
powers.
This has been accomplished
in spite of several obstacles.
Rigorous Standards
To begin with, only a small
percentage of athletes qualify
for admission to Stanford,
whose academic requirements
are the highest of any school in
the West. Certainly the other
notable football powers on the
Pacific Coast have no such
handicap in recruiting athletes.
Ralston has also had to strug-

gle constantly to overcome cer
tain financial restrictions result
ing from a limited budget.
Finally, diversified interests
on the part of many Stanford
football players have caused a
problem in generating intense
team desire, spirit and pride:
ingredients absolutely essential
to building a great team.
Drink, Team Drink!
Football coaches can only do
so much. They cannot play on
Saturday. The old saying, "you
can lead a horse to water, but
you cannot make him drink,"
applies here. John Ralston and
his staff have led their horses
to water, but not enough of
them have taken a drink. Each
individual player must decide
on his own that he will give his
maximum effort in every situ
ation throughout the season.
This has not been done in the
past and is the greatest cause of
Stanford's football mediocrity.
In the future this individual
attitude must be present so that
the Indians can become the
great team that they are cap
able of becoming. Only then will
Coach Ralston and his fine staff
be recognized by everyone for
the outstanding ability that they
possess as coaches and the un
ending efforts that they have
expended.

Referring again to the article
in the Palo Alto Times, "one
only need to look at Ara Par
seghian, an excellent and out
standing coach, who while at
Northwestern, a private institu
tion with similar handicaps
could never win the Big Ten,
produce an undefeated team, or
have a record that was even
much better than five hundred."
Excellent Accomplishments
People close to the Stanford
football program who know the
entire situation, unlike Berkeley
and Stone, already recognize
the excellent accomplishments
of Coach Ralston and his staff.
In conclusion, we as players
do not complain about the re
cruiting difficulties created by
our University's high academic
standards. We do not complain
about our department's limited
financial support, nor the few
other inherent weaknesses in
the football program.
These are not the factors
keeping our team from great
ness. Rather the problem lies
within ourselves. We, the play
ers, must accept the necessary
responsibility and assume the
necessary leadership in 1968;
things that we have failed to
do for the past five years.
We owe this much to our
coaches.
Several member of the Stan
ford football team were quite
surprised and upset Wednesday
morning, November 22, after
reading the inane babblings of
one Robert Stone and of Stan
ford's favorite "Monday morn
ing quarterback," Gil Berkeley
Jr., in that date's edition of the
Daily. Both articles were unwar
ranted slashes at Coach John
Ralston and his football pro
gram here on the Farm.
Normally we would hesitate
to comment on these ill-founded
articles as they do not merit
such attention. However, it is
quite possible that there exists
in this troubled, intellectual en
vironment people who know
considerably less about football,
first downs and coaching than
even Berkeley or Stone. If this
is true, then it is quite con
ceivable that these same people
might place credulence in the
words of these two "football
experts."
Our advice to you Mr. Stone,
is simply this: It is great to
be witty, sardonic and so on.
It is even lots of fun. But it
would be much more meaning
ful to everyone, including your
self, if your witticism was cen
tered around a topic that you
knew something about. Not
only are you totally ignorant
of your subject, but you also
lack originality in your presen
tation. We suggest that you di
rect your efforts to some other
area, perhaps marbles, nuclear
physics, or semething.
Write To John McKay
As for you, Gil Berkeley, Jr.;
we advise you to write a letter
to John McKay at USC and find
out just what he actually does
know about the Stanford foot
ball program.
Then write a letter to your
self asking what you really
know about Stanford football;
about practices, game strategy
and the endless hours of plan
ning that take place in the
coaches office during the course
of a year. You will find that you
know very little about the situ
ation and that you are in no
position to call Coach John Ral
ston a "lousy coach" as you
did in your recent letter to the
Daily.
