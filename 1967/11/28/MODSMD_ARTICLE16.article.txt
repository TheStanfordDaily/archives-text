# Law School Takes A New Look At Its Role
## 
### DAN SNELL (First of a Series) 
The Stanford School of Law
is now in the throes of a long
process of learning to utilize the
social sciences in the teaching of
law.
"Lawyers really are In the
business of ordering society,"
Dean Bayless Manning, who
heads the school explained.
"Maybe law schools should now
be called "Law Schools of Ap
plied Social Engineering."
Law now Is correctly regard
ed, according to Manning, as
having little to do with citation

of precedents. Law is concrete,
Manning said. "You make the
law and go out and do some
thing with it."
Justice William Douglas and
others working during the New
Deal era were instrumental in
getting the radical view accept
ed.
How To Teach?
The problem of what one does
to prepare lawyers to work us
ing this new view of the law
is the one that good law schools
are concerned with now.
Manning sees at least three
general steps that are being
taken in this area:

• Law schools are getting
lawyers and others from outside
the schools to teach classes.
• They are using experts at
their universities in joint teach
ing of courses in order to give
students the benefit of the best
minds in areas like economics.
• They are focusing attention
in advanced courses away from
verbal abstract problems in law
to empiric enquiry "out there"
in the world away from the
school.
Degree Reshuffling
Manning foresees at least one
change in the good law schools
like Yale, Harvard, and Stanford
within the next few years. Stu
dents interested in pursuing the
sociological study of the law
may well need more time to
study.
For them the law school at
tendance period of three years
may be lengthened, and degrees
something like a doctorate of
philosophy in law may be of
fered.
For those interested in the
small-scale practice of law the
length of law school may be
shortened to one and a half or
two years since they will not
need the detailed case parsing
and all the studies the doctoral
candidates will want.
Uesult-Oriented'
But Manning says that both
the macro- and micro-oriented
curricula will continue to be "re
sult-oriented" in the tradition of
the American law school.
Manning does not believe the
law schools will soon become so
clinically oriented as medical
schools are. "That would entail

making law schools into ex
tremely large law offices," he
said.
But he said the schools would
continue to search for "new en
gines for clinical experience with
the law" like Stanford's Legal
Aid Society, which helps law
yers working for indigent cli
ents.
"This is not a process that is
unique to Stanford's law
school," Manning said. But the
"good law schools", Stanford
among them, will go on search
ing for ways to make the study
of law more and more into the
study of "social engineering,"
according to the dean.
Dean Manning noted that
American legal education has
always been practice-oriented.
American law schools began, he
said, when lawyers pooled their
apprentices for after-hours prac
tical instruction sessions.
This is in marked contrast to
European law studies, which
have always been regarded as
"a back door to the classics,"
according to the dean. Since the
Renaissance a European stu
dent has been able to take law
as a sort of undergraduate ma
jor and to study it in the ab
stract much as political science
is studied in the United States.
Practicing lawyers in Europe
are trained as apprentices in
law offices.
Part-Time Profs
This apprentice system was
brought over to America, but
slowly law schools evolved in
which lawyers would spend part
of their time teaching anyone
who would pay them for the
privilege. To this day many law
professors also have private
practices.
Harvard was the first univer
sity to take the lawyer-teacher
out of his living room and put
him with his students into a
lecture hall. But the subject
matter continued to be con
cerned with practical problems

about "how to get back the
neighbor's cow," Manning con
tinued.
By about 1900 the American
law schools had evolved into
graduate schools that offered
degrees and tended to have full
time professors. But the schools
were still basically "trade
schools."
Begin Law School
Stanford's School of Law was
formed in 1893, two years after
the University as a whole. Man
ning stressed that the Stanfords
conceived of the school as an
integral part of the University
and had planned it from the
inception of the idea for the
University.
At the time the School began
to function, however, a slow
change came over the law cur
riculum in America. Since law
was now taught almost exclu
sively in a University environ
ment, the students tended to be
seekers after what Manning
called "incremental intellectual
ization" rather than apprentices

interested in getting back the
neighbor's cow.
But there was no analogue In
the world for the American law
school, a graduate school for
generally practical law. Nowa
days, Manning said, there are
similar law schools in some
parts of the world like Africa
which have been under Ameri
can influence.
'Case System'
In about the year 1905 law
professors decided the curricu
lum was too unorganized and
really had little to do with the
law. A movement developed
which resulted in the "case sys
tem" of study.
Students would study only
the written decisions of judges
in courts of appeals. The meth
od involved parsing out almost
word by word the logic of the
decisions.
Manning views the case meth
od as a great advancement over
the less organized previous
teaching methods. It evolved
somewhat as a part of the trend
toward quantification of the so
cial sciences arising out of the
mood of the Darwinian period.
Socr&tic Teaching
The case system led to a So
cratic method of teaching. The
student was to figure it all out
for himself, and the professor

was to be quiet, according tf>
Manning.
But in the late 1920's some
radical professors shook up the
law schools. The professors
charged that the case system ig
nored the real roots of judicial
decisions, the problems of social
frictions and allocation of re
sources In the best interest of
society.
And they also charged, much
to the dismay of their elders,
that the judges knew all the
time that they were in effect ly
ing when they wrote the appeals
decisions. The judges, according
to the radicals, decided on the
basis of frictions and resources
but rationalized their decisions
with citations of precedents.
Radicals Discuss
And since the case system em
phasized precedents, it really
had little to do with the law as
practiced according to the radi
cals.
There was much discussion
about this revolution in thinking
in law schools. But now the radi
cal point of view is no longer
disputed, Manning said.
What is disputed is how to
study law from a realistic stand
point, how to study the problems
of social frictions.

Aid Society, which helps law
yers working for indigent cli
ents.
"This is not a process that is
unique to Stanford's law
school," Manning said. But the
"good law schools", Stanford
among them, will go on search
ing for ways to make the study
of law more and more into the
study of "social engineering,"
according to the dean.
Dean Manning noted that
American legal education has
always been practice-oriented.
American law schools began, he
said, when lawyers pooled their
apprentices for after-hours prac
tical instruction sessions.
This is in marked contrast to
European law studies, which
have always been regarded as
"a back door to the classics,"
according to the dean. Since the
Renaissance a European stu
dent has been able to take law
as a sort of undergraduate ma
jor and to study it in the ab
stract much as political science
is studied in the United States.
Practicing lawyers in Europe
are trained as apprentices in
law offices.
Part-Time Profs
This apprentice system was
brought over to America, but
slowly law schools evolved in
which lawyers would spend part
of their time teaching anyone
who would pay them for the
privilege. To this day many law
professors also have private
practices.
Harvard was the first univer
sity to take the lawyer-teacher
out of his living room and put
him with his students into a
lecture hall. But the subject
matter continued to be con
cerned with practical problems

about "how to get back the
neighbor's cow," Manning con
tinued.
By about 1900 the American
law schools had evolved into
graduate schools that offered
degrees and tended to have full
time professors. But the schools
were still basically "trade
schools."
Begin Law School
Stanford's School of Law was
formed in 1893, two years after
the University as a whole. Man
ning stressed that the Stanfords
conceived of the school as an
integral part of the University
and had planned it from the
inception of the idea for the
University.
At the time the School began
to function, however, a slow
change came over the law cur
riculum in America. Since law
was now taught almost exclu
sively in a University environ
ment, the students tended to be
seekers after what Manning
called "incremental intellectual
ization" rather than apprentices

interested in getting back the
neighbor's cow.
But there was no analogue In
the world for the American law
school, a graduate school for
generally practical law. Nowa
days, Manning said, there are
similar law schools in some
parts of the world like Africa
which have been under Ameri
can influence.
'Case System'
In about the year 1905 law
professors decided the curricu
lum was too unorganized and
really had little to do with the
law. A movement developed
which resulted in the "case sys
tem" of study.
Students would study only
the written decisions of judges
in courts of appeals. The meth
od involved parsing out almost
word by word the logic of the
decisions.
Manning views the case meth
od as a great advancement over
the less organized previous
teaching methods. It evolved
somewhat as a part of the trend
toward quantification of the so
cial sciences arising out of the
mood of the Darwinian period.
Socr&tic Teaching
The case system led to a So
cratic method of teaching. The
student was to figure it all out
for himself, and the professor

was to be quiet, according tf>
Manning.
But in the late 1920's some
radical professors shook up the
law schools. The professors
charged that the case system ig
nored the real roots of judicial
decisions, the problems of social
frictions and allocation of re
sources In the best interest of
society.
And they also charged, much
to the dismay of their elders,
that the judges knew all the
time that they were in effect ly
ing when they wrote the appeals
decisions. The judges, according
to the radicals, decided on the
basis of frictions and resources
but rationalized their decisions
with citations of precedents.
Radicals Discuss
And since the case system em
phasized precedents, it really
had little to do with the law as
practiced according to the radi
cals.
There was much discussion
about this revolution in thinking
in law schools. But now the radi
cal point of view is no longer
disputed, Manning said.
What is disputed is how to
study law from a realistic stand
point, how to study the problems
of social frictions.

BAYLESS MANNING
Dean of the Law School
The Stanford School of Law
is now in the throes of a long
process of learning to utilize the
social sciences in the teaching of
law.
"Lawyers really are In the
business of ordering society,"
Dean Bayless Manning, who
heads the school explained.
"Maybe law schools should now
be called "Law Schools of Ap
plied Social Engineering."
Law now Is correctly regard
ed, according to Manning, as
having little to do with citation

of precedents. Law is concrete,
Manning said. "You make the
law and go out and do some
thing with it."
Justice William Douglas and
others working during the New
Deal era were instrumental in
getting the radical view accept
ed.
How To Teach?
The problem of what one does
to prepare lawyers to work us
ing this new view of the law
is the one that good law schools
are concerned with now.
Manning sees at least three
general steps that are being
taken in this area:

• Law schools are getting
lawyers and others from outside
the schools to teach classes.
• They are using experts at
their universities in joint teach
ing of courses in order to give
students the benefit of the best
minds in areas like economics.
• They are focusing attention
in advanced courses away from
verbal abstract problems in law
to empiric enquiry "out there"
in the world away from the
school.
Degree Reshuffling
Manning foresees at least one
change in the good law schools
like Yale, Harvard, and Stanford
within the next few years. Stu
dents interested in pursuing the
sociological study of the law
may well need more time to
study.
For them the law school at
tendance period of three years
may be lengthened, and degrees
something like a doctorate of
philosophy in law may be of
fered.
For those interested in the
small-scale practice of law the
length of law school may be
shortened to one and a half or
two years since they will not
need the detailed case parsing
and all the studies the doctoral
candidates will want.
Uesult-Oriented'
But Manning says that both
the macro- and micro-oriented
curricula will continue to be "re
sult-oriented" in the tradition of
the American law school.
Manning does not believe the
law schools will soon become so
clinically oriented as medical
schools are. "That would entail

making law schools into ex
tremely large law offices," he
said.
But he said the schools would
continue to search for "new en
gines for clinical experience with
the law" like Stanford's Legal
Aid Society, which helps law

similar law schools in some
parts of the world like Africa
which have been under Ameri
can influence.
'Case System'
In about the year 1905 law
professors decided the curricu
lum was too unorganized and
really had little to do with the
law. A movement developed
which resulted in the "case sys
tem" of study.
Students would study only
the written decisions of judges
in courts of appeals. The meth
od involved parsing out almost
word by word the logic of the
decisions.
Manning views the case meth
od as a great advancement over
the less organized previous
teaching methods. It evolved
somewhat as a part of the trend
toward quantification of the so
cial sciences arising out of the
mood of the Darwinian period.
Socr&tic Teaching
The case system led to a So
cratic method of teaching. The
student was to figure it all out
for himself, and the professor

was to be quiet, according tf>
Manning.
But in the late 1920's some
radical professors shook up the
law schools. The professors
charged that the case system ig
nored the real roots of judicial
decisions, the problems of social
frictions and allocation of re
sources In the best interest of
society.
And they also charged, much
to the dismay of their elders,
that the judges knew all the
time that they were in effect ly
ing when they wrote the appeals
decisions. The judges, according
to the radicals, decided on the
basis of frictions and resources
but rationalized their decisions
with citations of precedents.
Radicals Discuss
And since the case system em
phasized precedents, it really
had little to do with the law as
practiced according to the radi
cals.
There was much discussion
about this revolution in thinking
in law schools. But now the radi
cal point of view is no longer
disputed, Manning said.
What is disputed is how to
study law from a realistic stand
point, how to study the problems
of social frictions.

BAYLESS MANNING
Dean of the Law School
The Stanford School of Law
is now in the throes of a long
process of learning to utilize the
social sciences in the teaching of
law.
"Lawyers really are In the
business of ordering society,"
Dean Bayless Manning, who
heads the school explained.
"Maybe law schools should now
be called "Law Schools of Ap
plied Social Engineering."
Law now Is correctly regard
ed, according to Manning, as
having little to do with citation

of precedents. Law is concrete,
Manning said. "You make the
law and go out and do some
thing with it."
Justice William Douglas and
others working during the New
Deal era were instrumental in
getting the radical view accept
ed.
How To Teach?
The problem of what one does
to prepare lawyers to work us
ing this new view of the law
is the one that good law schools
are concerned with now.
Manning sees at least three
general steps that are being
taken in this area:

• Law schools are getting
lawyers and others from outside
the schools to teach classes.
• They are using experts at
their universities in joint teach
ing of courses in order to give
students the benefit of the best
minds in areas like economics.
• They are focusing attention
in advanced courses away from
verbal abstract problems in law
to empiric enquiry "out there"
in the world away from the
school.
Degree Reshuffling
Manning foresees at least one
change in the good law schools
like Yale, Harvard, and Stanford
within the next few years. Stu
dents interested in pursuing the
sociological study of the law
may well need more time to
study.
For them the law school at
tendance period of three years
may be lengthened, and degrees
something like a doctorate of
philosophy in law may be of
fered.
For those interested in the
small-scale practice of law the
length of law school may be
shortened to one and a half or
two years since they will not
need the detailed case parsing
and all the studies the doctoral
candidates will want.
Uesult-Oriented'
But Manning says that both
the macro- and micro-oriented
curricula will continue to be "re
sult-oriented" in the tradition of
the American law school.
Manning does not believe the
law schools will soon become so
clinically oriented as medical
schools are. "That would entail

making law schools into ex
tremely large law offices," he
said.
But he said the schools would
continue to search for "new en
gines for clinical experience with
the law" like Stanford's Legal
Aid Society, which helps law
yers working for indigent cli
ents.
"This is not a process that is
unique to Stanford's law
school," Manning said. But the
"good law schools", Stanford
among them, will go on search
ing for ways to make the study
of law more and more into the
study of "social engineering,"
according to the dean.
Dean Manning noted that
American legal education has
always been practice-oriented.
American law schools began, he
said, when lawyers pooled their
apprentices for after-hours prac
tical instruction sessions.
This is in marked contrast to
European law studies, which
have always been regarded as
"a back door to the classics,"
according to the dean. Since the
Renaissance a European stu
dent has been able to take law
as a sort of undergraduate ma
jor and to study it in the ab
stract much as political science
is studied in the United States.
Practicing lawyers in Europe
are trained as apprentices in
law offices.
Part-Time Profs
This apprentice system was
brought over to America, but
slowly law schools evolved in
which lawyers would spend part
of their time teaching anyone
who would pay them for the
privilege. To this day many law
professors also have private
practices.
Harvard was the first univer
sity to take the lawyer-teacher
out of his living room and put
him with his students into a
lecture hall. But the subject
matter continued to be con
cerned with practical problems

about "how to get back the
neighbor's cow," Manning con
tinued.
By about 1900 the American
law schools had evolved into
graduate schools that offered
degrees and tended to have full
time professors. But the schools
were still basically "trade
schools."
Begin Law School
Stanford's School of Law was
formed in 1893, two years after
the University as a whole. Man
ning stressed that the Stanfords
conceived of the school as an
integral part of the University
and had planned it from the
inception of the idea for the
University.
At the time the School began
to function, however, a slow
change came over the law cur
riculum in America. Since law
was now taught almost exclu
sively in a University environ
ment, the students tended to be
seekers after what Manning
called "incremental intellectual
ization" rather than apprentices

interested in getting back the
neighbor's cow.
But there was no analogue In
the world for the American law
school, a graduate school for
generally practical law. Nowa
days, Manning said, there are
similar law schools in some

which have been under Ameri

Manning said. "You make the
law and go out and do some
thing with it."
Justice William Douglas and
others working during the New
Deal era were instrumental in
getting the radical view accept
ed.
How To Teach?
The problem of what one does
to prepare lawyers to work us
ing this new view of the law
is the one that good law schools
are concerned with now.
Manning sees at least three
general steps that are being
taken in this area:

• Law schools are getting
lawyers and others from outside
the schools to teach classes.
• They are using experts at
their universities in joint teach
ing of courses in order to give
students the benefit of the best
minds in areas like economics.
• They are focusing attention
in advanced courses away from
verbal abstract problems in law
to empiric enquiry "out there"
in the world away from the
school.
Degree Reshuffling
Manning foresees at least one
change in the good law schools
like Yale, Harvard, and Stanford
within the next few years. Stu
dents interested in pursuing the
sociological study of the law
may well need more time to
study.
For them the law school at
tendance period of three years
may be lengthened, and degrees
something like a doctorate of
philosophy in law may be of
fered.
For those interested in the
small-scale practice of law the
length of law school may be
shortened to one and a half or
two years since they will not
need the detailed case parsing
and all the studies the doctoral
candidates will want.
Uesult-Oriented'
But Manning says that both
the macro- and micro-oriented
curricula will continue to be "re
sult-oriented" in the tradition of
the American law school.
Manning does not believe the
law schools will soon become so
clinically oriented as medical
schools are. "That would entail

making law schools into ex
tremely large law offices," he
said.
But he said the schools would
continue to search for "new en
gines for clinical experience with
the law" like Stanford's Legal
Aid Society, which helps law
yers working for indigent cli
ents.
"This is not a process that is
unique to Stanford's law
school," Manning said. But the
"good law schools", Stanford
among them, will go on search
ing for ways to make the study
of law more and more into the
study of "social engineering,"
according to the dean.
Dean Manning noted that
American legal education has
always been practice-oriented.
American law schools began, he
said, when lawyers pooled their
apprentices for after-hours prac
tical instruction sessions.
This is in marked contrast to
European law studies, which
have always been regarded as
"a back door to the classics,"
according to the dean. Since the
Renaissance a European stu
dent has been able to take law
as a sort of undergraduate ma
jor and to study it in the ab
stract much as political science
is studied in the United States.
Practicing lawyers in Europe
are trained as apprentices in
law offices.
Part-Time Profs
This apprentice system was
brought over to America, but
slowly law schools evolved in
which lawyers would spend part
of their time teaching anyone
who would pay them for the
privilege. To this day many law
professors also have private
practices.
Harvard was the first univer
sity to take the lawyer-teacher
out of his living room and put
him with his students into a
lecture hall. But the subject
matter continued to be con
cerned with practical problems

about "how to get back the
neighbor's cow," Manning con
tinued.
By about 1900 the American
law schools had evolved into
graduate schools that offered
degrees and tended to have full
time professors. But the schools
were still basically "trade
schools."
Begin Law School
Stanford's School of Law was
formed in 1893, two years after
the University as a whole. Man
ning stressed that the Stanfords
conceived of the school as an
integral part of the University
and had planned it from the
inception of the idea for the
University.
At the time the School began
to function, however, a slow
change came over the law cur
riculum in America. Since law
was now taught almost exclu
sively in a University environ
ment, the students tended to be
seekers after what Manning
called "incremental intellectual
ization" rather than apprentices

interested in getting back the
neighbor's cow.
But there was no analogue In
the world for the American law
school, a graduate school for
generally practical law. Nowa
days, Manning said, there are
similar law schools in some
parts of the world like Africa
which have been under Ameri
can influence.
'Case System'
In about the year 1905 law
professors decided the curricu
lum was too unorganized and
really had little to do with the
law. A movement developed
which resulted in the "case sys
tem" of study.
Students would study only
the written decisions of judges
in courts of appeals. The meth
od involved parsing out almost
word by word the logic of the
decisions.
Manning views the case meth
od as a great advancement over
the less organized previous
teaching methods. It evolved
somewhat as a part of the trend
toward quantification of the so
cial sciences arising out of the
mood of the Darwinian period.
Socr&tic Teaching
The case system led to a So
cratic method of teaching. The
student was to figure it all out
for himself, and the professor

was to be quiet, according tf>
Manning.
But in the late 1920's some
radical professors shook up the
law schools. The professors
charged that the case system ig
nored the real roots of judicial
decisions, the problems of social
frictions and allocation of re
sources In the best interest of
society.
And they also charged, much
to the dismay of their elders,
that the judges knew all the
time that they were in effect ly
ing when they wrote the appeals
decisions. The judges, according
to the radicals, decided on the
basis of frictions and resources
but rationalized their decisions
with citations of precedents.
Radicals Discuss
And since the case system em
phasized precedents, it really
had little to do with the law as
practiced according to the radi
cals.
There was much discussion
about this revolution in thinking
in law schools. But now the radi
cal point of view is no longer
disputed, Manning said.
What is disputed is how to
study law from a realistic stand
point, how to study the problems
of social frictions.
