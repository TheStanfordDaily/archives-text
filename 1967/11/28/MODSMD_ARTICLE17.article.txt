# Canada Has System To Rate Immigrants
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, (CPS) — The
factors used by Canadian offi
cials in judging young Ameri
cans migrating to Canada have
now been revised and codified
in a point system.
This system replaces old regu
lations under which some would
be migrants could be turned
down by an immigration officer
because of a single deficiency.
Any immigrant scoring 50 out
of a possible 100 "assessment
units" will now be admitted to
Canada.
According to Canadian Citizen
ship and Immigration Minister
Jean Marchand, "The new im
migration regulations spell out
for the first time the principles
involved in the selection of im
migrants. Whereas in the past
an individual would have been
rejected on account of a single
factor, the new regulations use
a combination of factors in such
a way that some of them may
compensate for relatively low
qualifications in other factors."
The scoring under the new
system is as follows:
• Education and training, 20
units. One unit for each year of
schooling or training.
• Personal assessment, 15
units. Adaptability, motivation,
initiative, and other such qual
ities as judged by an immigra

tion officer during an interview.
• Occupational demand, 15
units. Based on demand for va
rious skills in Canada, units are
assessed according to the de
mand for the occupation the ap
plicant will follow in Canada.
• Age, 10 units. 10 units if
the applicant is between 18 and
35 — i.e., of draft age — but one
unit deducted for each year over
35.
• Arranged employment, 10
units: 10 units if the applicant
has arranged employment in
Canada or has received offers on
a previous visit.
• Knowledge of French and
English, 10 units: Five points for
each language spoken fluently,
with extra points for some
knowledge of either.
• Relative, 5 units: granted
when the applicant has a rela
tive in Canada willing to spon
sor him.
• Employment opportunities
in the area of destination, 5
units: a maximum of five units
if the applicant intends to go to
an area in Canada where there
is a strong demand for labor.
Under the new regulations
there is also a new application
form. The main change from
the old one is the deletion of the
question "Why do you wish to
migrate?"
