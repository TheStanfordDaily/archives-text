# Cuthbertson Sees 'Educational Deficit'
## 
### 
Stanford, though operating in
the black financially, faces a
growing "education deficit," ac
cording to Kenneth M. Cuthbert
son, vice-president for finance.
In a letter distributed with
copies of the University's finan
cial report to 5,000 alumni and
friends, Cuthbertson notes that
"Stanford has fiad to budget
each year to live within its in
come" because it lacks reserves
which could sustain a policy of
deficit financing.
For this reason, Stanford has
had to "cut or defer critically
important improvements in aca
demic programs and services,"
thus creating an educational de
ficit.
"The highest quality of learn
ing and education will without
doubt continue to increase in
cost—and at a rapid rate," Cuth
bertson notes. "To the extent

that Stanford and like institu
tions fail to meet those costs,
they contribute to a national
educational deficit where it
will hurt the most—at the cut
ting edge of knowledge."
Gifts received by the Univer
sity in 1966-67 totalled $21.6 mil
lion. Of this total, $9 million was
for endowment; $9 million was
for student aid, faculty, and
other specified current expenses;
$2.7 million was for buildings;
and $900,000 was for general
University purposes.
In an interview, Cuthbertson
pointed out that Stanford is
much more dependent on cur
rent gifts to meet its education
al expenses than other leading
private universities.
Many private institutions
which compete with Stanford
have from two to four times as
much endowment per student.
