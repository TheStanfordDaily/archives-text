# IJB Sets Date Of Policy Trial
## 
### 
The Interim Judicial Body yes
terday set a hearing date of De
cember 5 for ten students charg
ed with violating University pol
icy on campus demonstrations.
The IJB took the case on re
ferral from Dean of Students
Joel Smith, after the student
Judicial Council refused to hear
the case.
The ten students allegedly vio
lated University policy by dem
onstrating against Central In
telligence Agency recruiting here
November 1.
The action follows last week's
decision of the ASSU legislature
to withdraw ASSU recognition
from any appeals board which
does not have student members.
The IJB is composed of five Fac
ulty members.
Smith said he did not think
LASSU's action was relevant to
the cases of the accused students.
"Whatever effect LASSU's ac
tion was intended to have, I
doubt that anyone would claim
that its effect should be retro
active," he said.

Council as an independent or
ganization . . . [and] thinks of
the council as part of her ad
ministration."
In The Beginning . ..
It was critical of Winbigler
for his handling of the Frank
Morse case of 1964, in which a
student was suspended from the
University by unilateral action
of the dean's office.
The report said Winbigler
was inconsistent in his decisions
and had attempted to pressure
the judicial body involved.
When the Crow-Halverson re
port was made public in early
February 1965, the student
legislature reacted by passing
a strongly worded resolution
"that the ASSU shall have sole
jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct."
LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw in
terpreted the resolution as
meaning partly that Judicial
Council would enforce Univers
ity policy except when it con
flicts with ASSU policy.
At the time, the only such
conflict was on liquor policy
(though this particular conflict
no longer exists).
Later in the month, LASSU
passed an even stronger act, the
Judicial Competance Bill, stat
ing that Judicial Council would
not consider a violation of Uni
versity policy to be a violation
of the Fundamental Standard
unless that policy had been ap
proved by two-thirds vote of
LASSU.
Cl 5 To Settle Dispute
The Committee of 15 was set
up in March to negotiate a new
judicial system. The committee
had five representatives each
from the student body, the fac
ulty and the administration.
Late in September 1965, final
agreement was reached and a
week later, LASSU and Presi
dent Wallace Sterling both ap
proved the compromise.
The student Judicial Council
was to have exclusive original
jurisdiction in all cases regard
ing student affairs and conduct,
unless a specific conflict existed
between ASSU and University
policies.
Students brought before Ju
dicial Council were guaranteed
certain rights, including the
right to have the case heard by
the dean of students.
The compromise included an
appeals system. A joint stu
dent-faculty appeals board was
to be set up at a later date, and
meanwhile appeals would be

heard by an all-faculty Interim
Judicial Body.
(Today, more than two years
later, this student-faculty ap
peals board has still not been
established. No method was
ever agreed upon for appoint
ing the student members.)
When the compromise was
reached, LASSU amended its
Judicial Competance Bill to con
form to it, and that is how
things stood until the following
spring.
In May 1966, a number of stu
dents sat-in in Sterling's office

to protest the draft deferment
test, scheduled to be given on
campus. The demonstrators
were later charged with violat
ing University policy and the
Fundamental Standard.
Judicial Council found all the
students guilty of both, but in
the case of one defendant, a
medical student named Marc
Sapir who was not registered
that quarter, complications
arose.
In Sapir's case, Judicial Coun
cil decided he had not violated
the Fundamental Standard and
no action should be taken
against him, even though it
found he violated a University
policy.
The council contended a vio
lation of University policy was
not per se a violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The new
dean of students, Joel Smith,
appealed the decision to the In
terim Judicial Body.
The IJB decided, first of all,
that Sapir's non-student status
made no difference. He could
still be tried by the IJB.
IJB Interprets By-Laws
The IJB then took great pains
to come to the conclusion that
University policy violations
were indeed Fundamental Stan
dard violations, unless they con
flicted with ASSU Constitution
or By-Laws.
No ASSU law existed on the
subject of campus demonstra
tions (and there is still none).
Thus the IJB concluded that no
conflict of law existed which
would have allowed Judicial
Council to avoid punishing a
violation of University policy.
Furthermore, the body point
ed out, the ASSU Constitution
and By-Laws make no provision
for a separate tribunal to hear
cases where University policy
has been violated but not the
Fundamental Standard.

But this whole question aside,
the IJB said, Sapir's conduct
was a violation of the Funda
mental Standard. Sapir's defense
of "moral acts," grounded in the
philosophy of civil disobedience,
did not outweigh the fact that
he had placed his own convic
tions above "order" and"the
rights of others" protected by
the Fundamental Standard.
"We would take this view,"
the IJB said, "even if we had
concluded that violations of cer
tain University laws, policies
and regulations are not per se
violations of the Fundamental
Standard."
Back To Judicial Council
Having reached this conclu
sion, the IJB sent the case back
to Judicial Council with orders
to fix a penalty. The council,
however, did nothing.
These events, then, form the
background against which the
current controversy must be
seen.
Last week Judicial Council uni
laterally decided it could not try
the ten accused anti-CIA demon
strators because of the prece
dent the IJB set in the Sapir
case.
Council Chairman John Ras
kin, in a letter to Dean Smith,
said the Council felt if it decided
in the defendants' favor, their
decision would almost certainly
be overruled by the IJB.
Therefore, he said, its effec
tive alternatives were limited.
Raskin also reiterated that the
Council would not try cases not
involving the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Last week, the Council's repu
diation of the IJB was backed up
by the action of LASSU. The
legislature withdrew recognition
of the IJB, and thus significant
ly altered the substance of the
judicial compromise worked out
a year ago.

It also added a sentence to the
by-laws stating that University
policy violations were not per st'
Fundamental Standard viola
tions, thus reversing the IJB's
finding in the Sapir case.
To cap off the session, LASSU
passed a resolution calling these
changes in the by-laws a "clari
fication." In other words, LASSU
intended to make its acts retro
active.
This resolution was apparent
ly an attempt to nullify not only
the present-day effect of the
IJB's Sapir decision but to say
it had never had any effect at
all.
This interpretation would seem
to protect the anti-CIA demon
strators, whose actions took
place at a time when a violation
of the University's policy on cam
pus demonstrations was auto
matically a violation of the Fun
damental Standard, too, and thus
within the jurisdiction of Judi
cial Council.

Now, however, Judicial Coun
cil could judge the demonstra
tors by the Fundamental Stan
dard without regard to Univer
sity policy.
Question Unanswered
A question still exists, how
ever, of who will try cases of
University policy violations
which may not be Fundamental
Standard violations.
Raskin's public statements in
dicate Judicial Council will not
touch them. Yet the ASSU by
laws give Judicial Council "ex
clusive original jurisdiction" in
all cases touching on student
affairs and conduct.
If Judicial Council refuses to
take up such cases, presumably
they will be tried by the IJB
without regard to whether the
IJB is recognized by ASSU.
This is just what is happen
ing with the ten anti-CIA dem
onstrators. The dean has carried
their cases to the IJB, which yes
terday set a hearing for Dec. 5.
The Interim Judicial Body yes

and regulations are not per se
violations of the Fundamental
Standard."
Back To Judicial Council
Having reached this conclu
sion, the IJB sent the case back
to Judicial Council with orders
to fix a penalty. The council,
however, did nothing.
These events, then, form the
background against which the
current controversy must be
seen.
Last week Judicial Council uni
laterally decided it could not try
the ten accused anti-CIA demon
strators because of the prece
dent the IJB set in the Sapir
case.
Council Chairman John Ras
kin, in a letter to Dean Smith,
said the Council felt if it decided
in the defendants' favor, their
decision would almost certainly
be overruled by the IJB.
Therefore, he said, its effec
tive alternatives were limited.
Raskin also reiterated that the
Council would not try cases not
involving the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Last week, the Council's repu
diation of the IJB was backed up
by the action of LASSU. The
legislature withdrew recognition
of the IJB, and thus significant
ly altered the substance of the
judicial compromise worked out
a year ago.

It also added a sentence to the
by-laws stating that University
policy violations were not per st'
Fundamental Standard viola
tions, thus reversing the IJB's
finding in the Sapir case.
To cap off the session, LASSU
passed a resolution calling these
changes in the by-laws a "clari
fication." In other words, LASSU
intended to make its acts retro
active.
This resolution was apparent
ly an attempt to nullify not only
the present-day effect of the
IJB's Sapir decision but to say
it had never had any effect at
all.
This interpretation would seem
to protect the anti-CIA demon
strators, whose actions took
place at a time when a violation
of the University's policy on cam
pus demonstrations was auto
matically a violation of the Fun
damental Standard, too, and thus
within the jurisdiction of Judi
cial Council.

Now, however, Judicial Coun
cil could judge the demonstra
tors by the Fundamental Stan
dard without regard to Univer
sity policy.
Question Unanswered
A question still exists, how
ever, of who will try cases of
University policy violations
which may not be Fundamental
Standard violations.
Raskin's public statements in
dicate Judicial Council will not
touch them. Yet the ASSU by
laws give Judicial Council "ex
clusive original jurisdiction" in
all cases touching on student
affairs and conduct.
If Judicial Council refuses to
take up such cases, presumably
they will be tried by the IJB
without regard to whether the
IJB is recognized by ASSU.
This is just what is happen
ing with the ten anti-CIA dem
onstrators. The dean has carried
their cases to the IJB, which yes
terday set a hearing for Dec. 5.
The Interim Judicial Body yes
terday set a hearing date of De
cember 5 for ten students charg
ed with violating University pol
icy on campus demonstrations.
The IJB took the case on re
ferral from Dean of Students
Joel Smith, after the student
Judicial Council refused to hear
the case.
The ten students allegedly vio
lated University policy by dem
onstrating against Central In
telligence Agency recruiting here
November 1.
The action follows last week's
decision of the ASSU legislature
to withdraw ASSU recognition
from any appeals board which
does not have student members.
The IJB is composed of five Fac
ulty members.
Smith said he did not think
LASSU's action was relevant to
the cases of the accused students.
"Whatever effect LASSU's ac
tion was intended to have, I
doubt that anyone would claim
that its effect should be retro
active," he said.

It was critical of Winbigler

The report said Winbigler

and had attempted to pressure

When the Crow-Halverson re
port was made public in early
February 1965, the student
legislature reacted by passing
a strongly worded resolution
"that the ASSU shall have sole

LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw in
terpreted the resolution as
meaning partly that Judicial

At the time, the only such
conflict was on liquor policy
(though this particular conflict
no longer exists).
Later in the month, LASSU
passed an even stronger act, the
Judicial Competance Bill, stat
ing that Judicial Council would
not consider a violation of Uni

Cl 5 To Settle Dispute
The Committee of 15 was set

judicial system. The committee
had five representatives each
from the student body, the fac
ulty and the administration.
Late in September 1965, final
agreement was reached and a
week later, LASSU and Presi
dent Wallace Sterling both ap
proved the compromise.
The student Judicial Council
was to have exclusive original
jurisdiction in all cases regard
ing student affairs and conduct,
unless a specific conflict existed
between ASSU and University
policies.
Students brought before Ju
dicial Council were guaranteed
certain rights, including the
right to have the case heard by
the dean of students.
The compromise included an
appeals system. A joint stu
dent-faculty appeals board was
to be set up at a later date, and
meanwhile appeals would be

heard by an all-faculty Interim
Judicial Body.
(Today, more than two years
later, this student-faculty ap
peals board has still not been
established. No method was
ever agreed upon for appoint
ing the student members.)
When the compromise was
reached, LASSU amended its
Judicial Competance Bill to con
form to it, and that is how
things stood until the following
spring.
In May 1966, a number of stu
dents sat-in in Sterling's office

to protest the draft deferment
test, scheduled to be given on
campus. The demonstrators
were later charged with violat
ing University policy and the
Fundamental Standard.
Judicial Council found all the
students guilty of both, but in
the case of one defendant, a
medical student named Marc
Sapir who was not registered
that quarter, complications
arose.
In Sapir's case, Judicial Coun
cil decided he had not violated
the Fundamental Standard and
no action should be taken
against him, even though it
found he violated a University
policy.
The council contended a vio
lation of University policy was
not per se a violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The new
dean of students, Joel Smith,
appealed the decision to the In
terim Judicial Body.
The IJB decided, first of all,
that Sapir's non-student status
made no difference. He could
still be tried by the IJB.
IJB Interprets By-Laws
The IJB then took great pains
to come to the conclusion that
University policy violations
were indeed Fundamental Stan
dard violations, unless they con
flicted with ASSU Constitution
or By-Laws.
No ASSU law existed on the
subject of campus demonstra
tions (and there is still none).
Thus the IJB concluded that no
conflict of law existed which
would have allowed Judicial
Council to avoid punishing a
violation of University policy.
Furthermore, the body point
ed out, the ASSU Constitution
and By-Laws make no provision
for a separate tribunal to hear
cases where University policy
has been violated but not the
Fundamental Standard.

But this whole question aside,
the IJB said, Sapir's conduct
was a violation of the Funda
mental Standard. Sapir's defense
of "moral acts," grounded in the
philosophy of civil disobedience,
did not outweigh the fact that
he had placed his own convic
tions above "order" and"the
rights of others" protected by
the Fundamental Standard.
"We would take this view,"
the IJB said, "even if we had
concluded that violations of cer
tain University laws, policies
and regulations are not per se
violations of the Fundamental
Standard."

policies.
Students brought before Ju
dicial Council were guaranteed
certain rights, including the
right to have the case heard by
the dean of students.
The compromise included an
appeals system. A joint stu
dent-faculty appeals board was
to be set up at a later date, and
meanwhile appeals would be

heard by an all-faculty Interim
Judicial Body.
(Today, more than two years
later, this student-faculty ap
peals board has still not been
established. No method was
ever agreed upon for appoint
ing the student members.)
When the compromise was
reached, LASSU amended its
Judicial Competance Bill to con
form to it, and that is how
things stood until the following
spring.
In May 1966, a number of stu
dents sat-in in Sterling's office

to protest the draft deferment
test, scheduled to be given on
campus. The demonstrators
were later charged with violat
ing University policy and the
Fundamental Standard.
Judicial Council found all the
students guilty of both, but in
the case of one defendant, a
medical student named Marc
Sapir who was not registered
that quarter, complications
arose.
In Sapir's case, Judicial Coun
cil decided he had not violated
the Fundamental Standard and
no action should be taken
against him, even though it
found he violated a University
policy.
The council contended a vio
lation of University policy was
not per se a violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The new
dean of students, Joel Smith,
appealed the decision to the In
terim Judicial Body.
The IJB decided, first of all,
that Sapir's non-student status
made no difference. He could
still be tried by the IJB.
IJB Interprets By-Laws
The IJB then took great pains
to come to the conclusion that
University policy violations
were indeed Fundamental Stan
dard violations, unless they con
flicted with ASSU Constitution
or By-Laws.
No ASSU law existed on the
subject of campus demonstra
tions (and there is still none).
Thus the IJB concluded that no
conflict of law existed which
would have allowed Judicial
Council to avoid punishing a
violation of University policy.
Furthermore, the body point
ed out, the ASSU Constitution
and By-Laws make no provision
for a separate tribunal to hear
cases where University policy
has been violated but not the
Fundamental Standard.

But this whole question aside,
the IJB said, Sapir's conduct
was a violation of the Funda
mental Standard. Sapir's defense
of "moral acts," grounded in the
philosophy of civil disobedience,
did not outweigh the fact that
he had placed his own convic
tions above "order" and"the
rights of others" protected by
the Fundamental Standard.
"We would take this view,"
the IJB said, "even if we had
concluded that violations of cer
tain University laws, policies
and regulations are not per se
violations of the Fundamental
Standard."
Back To Judicial Council
Having reached this conclu
sion, the IJB sent the case back
to Judicial Council with orders
to fix a penalty. The council,
however, did nothing.
These events, then, form the
background against which the
current controversy must be
seen.
Last week Judicial Council uni
laterally decided it could not try
the ten accused anti-CIA demon
strators because of the prece
dent the IJB set in the Sapir
case.
Council Chairman John Ras
kin, in a letter to Dean Smith,
said the Council felt if it decided
in the defendants' favor, their
decision would almost certainly
be overruled by the IJB.
Therefore, he said, its effec
tive alternatives were limited.
Raskin also reiterated that the
Council would not try cases not
involving the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Last week, the Council's repu
diation of the IJB was backed up
by the action of LASSU. The
legislature withdrew recognition
of the IJB, and thus significant
ly altered the substance of the
judicial compromise worked out
a year ago.

It also added a sentence to the
by-laws stating that University
policy violations were not per st'
Fundamental Standard viola
tions, thus reversing the IJB's
finding in the Sapir case.
To cap off the session, LASSU
passed a resolution calling these
changes in the by-laws a "clari
fication." In other words, LASSU
intended to make its acts retro
active.
This resolution was apparent
ly an attempt to nullify not only
the present-day effect of the
IJB's Sapir decision but to say
it had never had any effect at
all.
This interpretation would seem
to protect the anti-CIA demon
strators, whose actions took
place at a time when a violation
of the University's policy on cam
pus demonstrations was auto
matically a violation of the Fun
damental Standard, too, and thus
within the jurisdiction of Judi
cial Council.

Now, however, Judicial Coun
cil could judge the demonstra
tors by the Fundamental Stan
dard without regard to Univer
sity policy.
Question Unanswered
A question still exists, how
ever, of who will try cases of
University policy violations
which may not be Fundamental
Standard violations.
Raskin's public statements in
dicate Judicial Council will not
touch them. Yet the ASSU by
laws give Judicial Council "ex
clusive original jurisdiction" in
all cases touching on student
affairs and conduct.
If Judicial Council refuses to
take up such cases, presumably
they will be tried by the IJB
without regard to whether the
IJB is recognized by ASSU.
This is just what is happen
ing with the ten anti-CIA dem
onstrators. The dean has carried
their cases to the IJB, which yes
terday set a hearing for Dec. 5.
The Interim Judicial Body yes
terday set a hearing date of De
cember 5 for ten students charg
ed with violating University pol
icy on campus demonstrations.
The IJB took the case on re
ferral from Dean of Students
Joel Smith, after the student
Judicial Council refused to hear
the case.
The ten students allegedly vio
lated University policy by dem
onstrating against Central In
telligence Agency recruiting here
November 1.
The action follows last week's
decision of the ASSU legislature
to withdraw ASSU recognition
from any appeals board which
does not have student members.
The IJB is composed of five Fac
ulty members.
Smith said he did not think
LASSU's action was relevant to
the cases of the accused students.
"Whatever effect LASSU's ac
tion was intended to have, I
doubt that anyone would claim
that its effect should be retro
active," he said.

ganization . . . [and] thinks of

In The Beginning . ..
It was critical of Winbigler
for his handling of the Frank
Morse case of 1964, in which a
student was suspended from the
University by unilateral action
of the dean's office.
The report said Winbigler
was inconsistent in his decisions
and had attempted to pressure
the judicial body involved.
When the Crow-Halverson re
port was made public in early
February 1965, the student
legislature reacted by passing
a strongly worded resolution
"that the ASSU shall have sole
jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct."
LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw in
terpreted the resolution as
meaning partly that Judicial
Council would enforce Univers
ity policy except when it con
flicts with ASSU policy.
At the time, the only such
conflict was on liquor policy
(though this particular conflict
no longer exists).
Later in the month, LASSU
passed an even stronger act, the
Judicial Competance Bill, stat
ing that Judicial Council would
not consider a violation of Uni
versity policy to be a violation
of the Fundamental Standard
unless that policy had been ap
proved by two-thirds vote of
LASSU.
Cl 5 To Settle Dispute
The Committee of 15 was set
up in March to negotiate a new
judicial system. The committee
had five representatives each
from the student body, the fac
ulty and the administration.
Late in September 1965, final
agreement was reached and a
week later, LASSU and Presi
dent Wallace Sterling both ap
proved the compromise.
The student Judicial Council
was to have exclusive original
jurisdiction in all cases regard

unless a specific conflict existed

onstrators. The dean has carried
their cases to the IJB, which yes
terday set a hearing for Dec. 5.
The Interim Judicial Body yes
terday set a hearing date of De
cember 5 for ten students charg
ed with violating University pol
icy on campus demonstrations.
The IJB took the case on re
ferral from Dean of Students
Joel Smith, after the student
Judicial Council refused to hear
the case.
The ten students allegedly vio
lated University policy by dem
onstrating against Central In

November 1.
The action follows last week's
decision of the ASSU legislature
to withdraw ASSU recognition
from any appeals board which
does not have student members.
The IJB is composed of five Fac

Smith said he did not think
LASSU's action was relevant to
the cases of the accused students.
"Whatever effect LASSU's ac

doubt that anyone would claim
that its effect should be retro

In The Beginning . ..
It was critical of Winbigler
for his handling of the Frank
Morse case of 1964, in which a
student was suspended from the
University by unilateral action
of the dean's office.
The report said Winbigler
was inconsistent in his decisions
and had attempted to pressure
the judicial body involved.
When the Crow-Halverson re
port was made public in early
February 1965, the student
legislature reacted by passing
a strongly worded resolution
"that the ASSU shall have sole
jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct."
LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw in
terpreted the resolution as
meaning partly that Judicial
Council would enforce Univers
ity policy except when it con
flicts with ASSU policy.
At the time, the only such
conflict was on liquor policy
(though this particular conflict
no longer exists).
Later in the month, LASSU
passed an even stronger act, the
Judicial Competance Bill, stat
ing that Judicial Council would
not consider a violation of Uni
versity policy to be a violation
of the Fundamental Standard
unless that policy had been ap
proved by two-thirds vote of
LASSU.
Cl 5 To Settle Dispute
The Committee of 15 was set
up in March to negotiate a new
judicial system. The committee
had five representatives each
from the student body, the fac
ulty and the administration.
Late in September 1965, final
agreement was reached and a
week later, LASSU and Presi
dent Wallace Sterling both ap
proved the compromise.
The student Judicial Council
was to have exclusive original
jurisdiction in all cases regard
ing student affairs and conduct,
unless a specific conflict existed
between ASSU and University
policies.
Students brought before Ju
dicial Council were guaranteed
certain rights, including the
right to have the case heard by
the dean of students.
The compromise included an
appeals system. A joint stu
dent-faculty appeals board was
to be set up at a later date, and
meanwhile appeals would be

heard by an all-faculty Interim
Judicial Body.
(Today, more than two years
later, this student-faculty ap
peals board has still not been
established. No method was
ever agreed upon for appoint
ing the student members.)
When the compromise was
reached, LASSU amended its
Judicial Competance Bill to con
form to it, and that is how
things stood until the following
spring.
In May 1966, a number of stu
dents sat-in in Sterling's office

to protest the draft deferment
test, scheduled to be given on
campus. The demonstrators
were later charged with violat
ing University policy and the
Fundamental Standard.
Judicial Council found all the
students guilty of both, but in
the case of one defendant, a
medical student named Marc
Sapir who was not registered
that quarter, complications
arose.
In Sapir's case, Judicial Coun
cil decided he had not violated
the Fundamental Standard and
no action should be taken
against him, even though it
found he violated a University
policy.
The council contended a vio
lation of University policy was
not per se a violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The new
dean of students, Joel Smith,
appealed the decision to the In
terim Judicial Body.
The IJB decided, first of all,
that Sapir's non-student status
made no difference. He could
still be tried by the IJB.
IJB Interprets By-Laws
The IJB then took great pains
to come to the conclusion that
University policy violations
were indeed Fundamental Stan
dard violations, unless they con
flicted with ASSU Constitution
or By-Laws.
No ASSU law existed on the
subject of campus demonstra
tions (and there is still none).
Thus the IJB concluded that no
conflict of law existed which
would have allowed Judicial
Council to avoid punishing a
violation of University policy.
Furthermore, the body point
ed out, the ASSU Constitution
and By-Laws make no provision
for a separate tribunal to hear
cases where University policy
has been violated but not the
Fundamental Standard.

But this whole question aside,
the IJB said, Sapir's conduct
was a violation of the Funda
mental Standard. Sapir's defense
of "moral acts," grounded in the
philosophy of civil disobedience,
did not outweigh the fact that
he had placed his own convic
tions above "order" and"the
rights of others" protected by
the Fundamental Standard.
"We would take this view,"
the IJB said, "even if we had
concluded that violations of cer
tain University laws, policies
and regulations are not per se
violations of the Fundamental
Standard."
Back To Judicial Council
Having reached this conclu
sion, the IJB sent the case back
to Judicial Council with orders
to fix a penalty. The council,
however, did nothing.
These events, then, form the
background against which the
current controversy must be
seen.
Last week Judicial Council uni
laterally decided it could not try
the ten accused anti-CIA demon
strators because of the prece
dent the IJB set in the Sapir
case.
Council Chairman John Ras
kin, in a letter to Dean Smith,
said the Council felt if it decided
in the defendants' favor, their
decision would almost certainly
be overruled by the IJB.
Therefore, he said, its effec
tive alternatives were limited.
Raskin also reiterated that the
Council would not try cases not
involving the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Last week, the Council's repu
diation of the IJB was backed up
by the action of LASSU. The
legislature withdrew recognition
of the IJB, and thus significant
ly altered the substance of the
judicial compromise worked out
a year ago.

It also added a sentence to the
by-laws stating that University
policy violations were not per st'
Fundamental Standard viola
tions, thus reversing the IJB's
finding in the Sapir case.
To cap off the session, LASSU
passed a resolution calling these
changes in the by-laws a "clari
fication." In other words, LASSU
intended to make its acts retro
active.
This resolution was apparent
ly an attempt to nullify not only
the present-day effect of the
IJB's Sapir decision but to say
it had never had any effect at
all.
This interpretation would seem
to protect the anti-CIA demon
strators, whose actions took
place at a time when a violation
of the University's policy on cam
pus demonstrations was auto
matically a violation of the Fun
damental Standard, too, and thus
within the jurisdiction of Judi
cial Council.

Now, however, Judicial Coun
cil could judge the demonstra
tors by the Fundamental Stan
dard without regard to Univer
sity policy.
Question Unanswered
A question still exists, how
ever, of who will try cases of
University policy violations
which may not be Fundamental
Standard violations.
Raskin's public statements in
dicate Judicial Council will not
touch them. Yet the ASSU by
laws give Judicial Council "ex
clusive original jurisdiction" in
all cases touching on student
affairs and conduct.
If Judicial Council refuses to
take up such cases, presumably
they will be tried by the IJB
without regard to whether the
IJB is recognized by ASSU.
This is just what is happen

"We would take this view,"
the IJB said, "even if we had
concluded that violations of cer
tain University laws, policies
and regulations are not per se
violations of the Fundamental
Standard."
Back To Judicial Council
Having reached this conclu
sion, the IJB sent the case back
to Judicial Council with orders
to fix a penalty. The council,
however, did nothing.
These events, then, form the
background against which the
current controversy must be
seen.
Last week Judicial Council uni
laterally decided it could not try
the ten accused anti-CIA demon
strators because of the prece
dent the IJB set in the Sapir
case.
Council Chairman John Ras
kin, in a letter to Dean Smith,
said the Council felt if it decided
in the defendants' favor, their
decision would almost certainly
be overruled by the IJB.
Therefore, he said, its effec
tive alternatives were limited.
Raskin also reiterated that the
Council would not try cases not
involving the Fundamental Stan
dard.
Last week, the Council's repu
diation of the IJB was backed up
by the action of LASSU. The
legislature withdrew recognition
of the IJB, and thus significant
ly altered the substance of the
judicial compromise worked out
a year ago.

It also added a sentence to the
by-laws stating that University
policy violations were not per st'
Fundamental Standard viola
tions, thus reversing the IJB's
finding in the Sapir case.
To cap off the session, LASSU
passed a resolution calling these
changes in the by-laws a "clari
fication." In other words, LASSU
intended to make its acts retro
active.
This resolution was apparent
ly an attempt to nullify not only
the present-day effect of the
IJB's Sapir decision but to say
it had never had any effect at
all.
This interpretation would seem
to protect the anti-CIA demon
strators, whose actions took
place at a time when a violation
of the University's policy on cam
pus demonstrations was auto
matically a violation of the Fun
damental Standard, too, and thus
within the jurisdiction of Judi
cial Council.

Now, however, Judicial Coun
cil could judge the demonstra
tors by the Fundamental Stan
dard without regard to Univer
sity policy.
Question Unanswered
A question still exists, how
ever, of who will try cases of
University policy violations
which may not be Fundamental
Standard violations.
Raskin's public statements in
dicate Judicial Council will not
touch them. Yet the ASSU by
laws give Judicial Council "ex
clusive original jurisdiction" in
all cases touching on student
affairs and conduct.
If Judicial Council refuses to
take up such cases, presumably
they will be tried by the IJB
without regard to whether the
IJB is recognized by ASSU.
This is just what is happen
ing with the ten anti-CIA dem
onstrators. The dean has carried
their cases to the IJB, which yes
terday set a hearing for Dec. 5.
The Interim Judicial Body yes
terday set a hearing date of De
cember 5 for ten students charg
ed with violating University pol
icy on campus demonstrations.
The IJB took the case on re
ferral from Dean of Students
Joel Smith, after the student
Judicial Council refused to hear
the case.
The ten students allegedly vio
lated University policy by dem
onstrating against Central In
telligence Agency recruiting here
November 1.
The action follows last week's
decision of the ASSU legislature
to withdraw ASSU recognition
from any appeals board which
does not have student members.
The IJB is composed of five Fac
ulty members.
Smith said he did not think
LASSU's action was relevant to
the cases of the accused students.
"Whatever effect LASSU's ac
tion was intended to have, I
doubt that anyone would claim
that its effect should be retro
active," he said.

Council as an independent or
ganization . . . [and] thinks of
the council as part of her ad
ministration."
In The Beginning . ..
It was critical of Winbigler
for his handling of the Frank
Morse case of 1964, in which a
student was suspended from the
University by unilateral action
of the dean's office.
The report said Winbigler
was inconsistent in his decisions
and had attempted to pressure
the judicial body involved.
When the Crow-Halverson re
port was made public in early
February 1965, the student
legislature reacted by passing
a strongly worded resolution
"that the ASSU shall have sole
jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct."
LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw in
terpreted the resolution as
meaning partly that Judicial
Council would enforce Univers
ity policy except when it con
flicts with ASSU policy.
At the time, the only such
conflict was on liquor policy
(though this particular conflict
no longer exists).
Later in the month, LASSU
passed an even stronger act, the
Judicial Competance Bill, stat
ing that Judicial Council would
not consider a violation of Uni
versity policy to be a violation
of the Fundamental Standard
unless that policy had been ap
proved by two-thirds vote of
LASSU.
Cl 5 To Settle Dispute
The Committee of 15 was set
up in March to negotiate a new
judicial system. The committee
had five representatives each
from the student body, the fac
ulty and the administration.
Late in September 1965, final
agreement was reached and a
week later, LASSU and Presi
dent Wallace Sterling both ap
proved the compromise.
The student Judicial Council
was to have exclusive original
jurisdiction in all cases regard
ing student affairs and conduct,
unless a specific conflict existed
between ASSU and University
policies.
Students brought before Ju
dicial Council were guaranteed
certain rights, including the
right to have the case heard by
the dean of students.
The compromise included an
appeals system. A joint stu
dent-faculty appeals board was
to be set up at a later date, and
meanwhile appeals would be

heard by an all-faculty Interim
Judicial Body.
(Today, more than two years
later, this student-faculty ap
peals board has still not been
established. No method was
ever agreed upon for appoint
ing the student members.)
When the compromise was
reached, LASSU amended its
Judicial Competance Bill to con
form to it, and that is how
things stood until the following
spring.
In May 1966, a number of stu
dents sat-in in Sterling's office

to protest the draft deferment
test, scheduled to be given on
campus. The demonstrators
were later charged with violat
ing University policy and the
Fundamental Standard.
Judicial Council found all the
students guilty of both, but in
the case of one defendant, a
medical student named Marc
Sapir who was not registered
that quarter, complications
arose.
In Sapir's case, Judicial Coun
cil decided he had not violated
the Fundamental Standard and
no action should be taken
against him, even though it
found he violated a University
policy.
The council contended a vio
lation of University policy was
not per se a violation of the
Fundamental Standard. The new
dean of students, Joel Smith,
appealed the decision to the In
terim Judicial Body.
The IJB decided, first of all,
that Sapir's non-student status
made no difference. He could
still be tried by the IJB.
IJB Interprets By-Laws
The IJB then took great pains
to come to the conclusion that
University policy violations
were indeed Fundamental Stan
dard violations, unless they con
flicted with ASSU Constitution
or By-Laws.
No ASSU law existed on the
subject of campus demonstra
tions (and there is still none).
Thus the IJB concluded that no
conflict of law existed which
would have allowed Judicial
Council to avoid punishing a
violation of University policy.
Furthermore, the body point
ed out, the ASSU Constitution
and By-Laws make no provision
for a separate tribunal to hear
cases where University policy
has been violated but not the
Fundamental Standard.

But this whole question aside,
the IJB said, Sapir's conduct
was a violation of the Funda
mental Standard. Sapir's defense
of "moral acts," grounded in the
philosophy of civil disobedience,
did not outweigh the fact that
he had placed his own convic
tions above "order" and"the
rights of others" protected by
the Fundamental Standard.
"We would take this view,"
the IJB said, "even if we had
concluded that violations of cer
tain University laws, policies
and regulations are not per se
violations of the Fundamental
Standard."

Having reached this conclu
sion, the IJB sent the case back
