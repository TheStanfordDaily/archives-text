# IJB Sets Date Of Policy Trial
## 
### 
The Interim Judicial Body yes
terday set a hearing date of De
cember 5 for ten students charg
ed with violating University pol
icy on campus demonstrations.
The IJB took the case on re
ferral from Dean of Students
Joel Smith, after the student
Judicial Council refused to hear
the case.
The ten students allegedly vio
lated University policy by dem
onstrating against Central In
telligence Agency recruiting here
November 1.
The action follows last week's
decision of the ASSU legislature
to withdraw ASSU recognition
from any appeals board which
does not have student members.
The IJB is composed of five Fac
ulty members.
Smith said he did not think
LASSU's action was relevant to
the cases of the accused students.
"Whatever effect LASSU's ac
tion was intended to have, I
doubt that anyone would claim
that its effect should be retro
active," he said.

In The Beginning . ..
It was critical of Winbigler
for his handling of the Frank
Morse case of 1964, in which a
student was suspended from the
University by unilateral action
of the dean's office.
The report said Winbigler
was inconsistent in his decisions
and had attempted to pressure
the judicial body involved.
When the Crow-Halverson re
port was made public in early
February 1965, the student
legislature reacted by passing
a strongly worded resolution
"that the ASSU shall have sole
jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct."
LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw in
terpreted the resolution as
meaning partly that Judicial
Council would enforce Univers
ity policy except when it con
flicts with ASSU policy.
At the time, the only such
conflict was on liquor policy
(though this particular conflict
no longer exists).
Later in the month, LASSU
passed an even stronger act, the
Judicial Competance Bill, stat
ing that Judicial Council would
not consider a violation of Uni
versity policy to be a violation
of the Fundamental Standard
unless that policy had been ap
proved by two-thirds vote of
LASSU.
Cl 5 To Settle Dispute
The Committee of 15 was set
up in March to negotiate a new
judicial system. The committee
had five representatives each
from the student body, the fac
ulty and the administration.
Late in September 1965, final
agreement was reached and a
week later, LASSU and Presi
dent Wallace Sterling both ap
proved the compromise.
The student Judicial Council
was to have exclusive original
