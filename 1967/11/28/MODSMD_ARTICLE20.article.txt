# Student Applications Due For Sierra Summer Camp
## 
### VALERIE WESTEN 
Stanford students have until
Friday to apply for staff posi
tions at the Sierra camp, the
University's idylic mountain re
sort for alumni, faculty, staff,
and their children.
About twenty students will be
hired for the 1968 season, run
ning from June 23 to Sept. 8,
according to assistant camp di
rector Susy Allen, who is ac
cepting applications at the Bow
man Alumni House on Santa
Teresa street.
Reservations are now being

taken at Bowman for vacations
at the camp, which started in
1953. The director is Frank Hil
dreth.
A trial program of faculty
residents, introduced last sum
mer, will be continued in 1968.
This well-conceived
brought at least one faculty
member to the camp each week.
During the week, short lec
tures were given by the resident
faculty and informal discussions
followed the lectures, which in
cluded such topics as "The Psy
chedelic Age" by James Paul

sen, health center psychiatrist,
and"The Place of Religion in
a University Today" by Edwin
Good, associate professor of Re
ligion.
Nestled in the shadow of the
Sierra Nevada along the south
shore of Fallen Leaf Lake, the
camp has a sense of isolation,
yet it is only a 20-minute drive
from the bustling night life of
Tahoe. As a family camp, Sierra
provides togetherness in dwell
ings but then reaches out to
each age group in the various
scheduled activities.
One may choose to simply re
lax for the duration of his stay
or participate in the diverse pro
grams.
For children, the Papoose
Playground has supervised play
areas, handicraft instruction, and
special campfires. Horseback rid
ing and babysitting may be ar
ranged for a small charge.
There is a complete outdoor
and social program for teenagers
and adults, including sailing,
water-skiing, hiking, and card
tournaments.
The evenings can be busy as
the individual wants to make
them. In addition to the faculty
speakers, there are feature
movies for children and adults,
slide shows and sundry other
types of entertainment.
For sports-minded campers,
there is a volleyball court, ten
nis court, and a nearby golf
course. On the lake, swimming,
water-skiing and sailing are fa
vorite afternoon occupations.
Clinics in most sports are held
for everyone over seven.
Student-Faculty Contact
According to Miss Allen one
of the great benefits for student
staffers at Sierra is "the unique
opportunity to really know pro
fessor after professor."
Marsha Cook, a former staffer,
summed up the student exper
ience thus: "Suddenly formerly
distant names like Spitfi, Smith,
and Kennedy are old friends.
Better still, their wives invite
you over for meals."
The pay scale for the next
year has not yet been determin
ed.
The student staff has at least
one day a week free to use the
facilities of the camp, and they
may also take in the entertain
ment at nearby South Tahoe.
