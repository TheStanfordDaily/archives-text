# Biologist To Speak On Fate
## 
### 
Century 21 concludes tomor
row night with an address by
Garrett Hardin on "Nature and
Man's Fate: A Biological Per
spective." The talk will be given
at 7:30 in Dinkelspiel Auditor
ium.
A biology professor at the Uni
versity of California, Santa Bar
bara, Hardin received his doctor
ate in biology from Stanford.

In his books he has given spe
cial attention to the humanistic
implications of biology, focus
ing on the application of biolog
ical theory to social dilemmas.
His book, Nature and Man's
Fat<% has been called one of the
most probing introductions to
the problems of evolution.
Hardin feels that the techno
logical progress which has been

spectacular in the last two cen
turies is approaching its "asymp
totic limit. The most significant
changes that take place in the
future will probably be in the
field of ideas, rather than of tech
nology," he says.
Hardin has stressed that one
of the major intellectual dis
coveries of the last two cen
turies is the realization that we
can build a perfect machine or
system out of very imperfect
components.
"The secret lies in the inclu
sion of suitable corrective feed
back mechanisms," he explains.
The same philosophy should
govern the design of modern
society, he contends, pointing to
a number of social controversies
that are apparently irresolvable

because we cannot agree on any
one absolutely right answer.
Abortion, infanticide of defec
tive children, euthanasia of the
senile and terminal, and treat
ment of the hopelessly insane
are some of these problems.
Hardin avers that solutions
are only possible if we will aban
don the search for single ans
wers and instead try to design
a system in which the care of de
fective or unwanted members of
society is determined by a "re
sponsible ballot rather than a
secret ballot."
The term "responsible ballot"
is used because such a vote
would constitute a public an
nouncement of the responsibility
the voter assumes in a exchange
for the privilege of citizenship.

bara, Hardin received his doctor
ate in biology from Stanford.

In his books he has given spe
cial attention to the humanistic
implications of biology, focus
ing on the application of biolog
ical theory to social dilemmas.
His book, Nature and Man's
Fat<% has been called one of the
most probing introductions to
the problems of evolution.
Hardin feels that the techno
logical progress which has been

spectacular in the last two cen
turies is approaching its "asymp
totic limit. The most significant
changes that take place in the
future will probably be in the
field of ideas, rather than of tech
nology," he says.
Hardin has stressed that one
of the major intellectual dis
coveries of the last two cen
turies is the realization that we
can build a perfect machine or
system out of very imperfect
components.
"The secret lies in the inclu
sion of suitable corrective feed
back mechanisms," he explains.
The same philosophy should
govern the design of modern
society, he contends, pointing to
a number of social controversies
that are apparently irresolvable

because we cannot agree on any
one absolutely right answer.
Abortion, infanticide of defec
tive children, euthanasia of the
senile and terminal, and treat
ment of the hopelessly insane
are some of these problems.
Hardin avers that solutions
are only possible if we will aban
don the search for single ans
wers and instead try to design
a system in which the care of de
fective or unwanted members of
society is determined by a "re
sponsible ballot rather than a
secret ballot."
The term "responsible ballot"
is used because such a vote
would constitute a public an
nouncement of the responsibility
the voter assumes in a exchange
for the privilege of citizenship.
