# Cal To Introduce Religion Courses
## 
### 
The University of California
at Berkeley has announced it is
now completing plans for a pro
gram of religious studies, to be
gin next fall.
Such a program departs from
the long-practiced application of
the doctrine of separation of
church and state which has pre
vented religious instruction in
state schools.
Professor William J. Bouws
ma, Berkeley's vice chancellor
for academic affairs, recently
dismissed any suggestion that a
church-state controversy might
arise over the introduction of re
ligious studies. "The courses are
not out to indoctrinate anyone,"
he said, "and although the issue
is raised from time to time,
there is really no concern on this
score."
Stanford has had programs of
religious instruction since 1951.
Presently the religious studies
program is set up under the Spe
cial Programs in Humanities.
Professor William Clebsch now
heads the department.
The Berkeley program will be
gin with courses on the history
of religion, but according to Pro
fessor Bouwsma, but will add
courses in many other areas.
Bouwsma, currently vice chan
cellor for academic affairs, has
been instrumental in getting the
proposal under way. He was last
year chairman of the Berkeley
history department
Bouwsma, is joined in his en
thusiasm for the proposal by
Chancellor Roger Heyns, who
has strongly applauded the idea
as, for one thing, a meaningful

counterstep to the modern ten
dency of humanities disciplines
to overspecialize.
In highlighting the need for
the program, Bouwsma stated:
"We have a generation of stu
dents who essentially are seek
ers of values, and their outlook
if for the universal, rather than
the parochial."
