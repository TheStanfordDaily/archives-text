### 
Health Education 400 is no
more.
The directed reading course,
which was listed as a gradu
ate course but taken by many
undergraduates, particularly
athletes, has been re-designat
ed as part of the 100-series In
Health Education. This means
it is an undergraduate course
also open to graduates.
Formerly Health Ed 400
could be taken for up to 16
units for work primarily In
volving the preparation of ab
stracts from articles in medical
journals.
Education School Dean H.
Thomas James announced that
the course will now be given
for no more than five units for
undergraduates. Graduate stu
dents will be able to take the
course for more units.
Students will also be care
fully interviewed before en
rolling.
