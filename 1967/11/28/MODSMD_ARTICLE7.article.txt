# Report: McNamara Will Resign Soon

### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—Defense
Secretary Robert S. McNamara
has been nominated by President
Johnson to become the next
President of the World Bank
the Washington Post said Mon
day night.
McNamara will resign when
he has been officially selected
as the bank's president, prob
ably Wednesday.
The nomination was submit
ted to the bank's 20 directors at
an informal meeting last week,
the paper added.
Neither the White House nor
the Pentagon would confirm
that McNamara is on his way
out.
That McNamara has now fi
nally decided to move on was
confirmed by sources within the
international financial commu
nity, the Post reported, adding
that one of the World Bank's di
rectors said the nomination was
submitted last week by Livings
ton Merchant, United States
representative on the bank
board.
Merchant earlier had told the
Associated Press that "it is not

a matter I can discuss."
"It was submitted," the Post
source said, "as the final choice
of the United States. Other
names had been considered ear
lier but McNamara was the one
decided upon."
There have been repeated in
dications that McNamara dif
fered with President Johnson
and other influential Pentagon
military advisers on Vietnam
war strategy.
He has held the job longer
than anyone in history and has
seemed less bouyant lately than
when he entered the Pentagon
in January 1961 as a 41-year-old
financial "Whiz Kid" from the
Ford Motor Co.
The Post also said that Mc-
Namara is reported to have
been having doubts as to the
propriety of the escalations in
the Vietnam war that have oc
curred in his seven years in
office.
The New York Times said the
directors of the World Bank
would vote on the nomination
Wednesday.

There was some speculation,
the Times said, that Johnson
would name another Republican
to the defense post.
The formal term of the bank's
current president, George D.
Woods, expires at the end of
this year. But he has an interim
appointment to serve an addi
tional year unless a successor
is named earlier.
The job of the World Bank—
formerly called the Internation
al Bank for Reconstruction and
Development—is to supply to
underdeveloped countries capi
tal that is not available through
normal commercial channels.
In the past, rumors of Mc-
Namara's leaving have been
firmly denied. But Monday there
was "no comment" from the
White House press secretary
George Christian and from the
Defense Department public af
fairs spokesman. Said Chris
tian: "I have no information on
that report." He promised to
raise the matter with President
Johnson but indicated no quick
response was likely.
