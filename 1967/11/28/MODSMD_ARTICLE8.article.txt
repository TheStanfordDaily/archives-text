# Revenge In Germany
## Indians Crush Bears 
### CICELY BATES BILL HUDSON 
A week ago Sunday Stan
ford in Germany XIX revenged
a Big Game defeat by smashing
the Cal Junior Year Abroad stu
dents from Gottingen by a one
sided score of 52-12.
The Bears came up with a
victory the night before, how
ever, in the German beer drink
ing contest. One Stanford stu
dent bemoaned this defeat when
he said, "We had been practicing
football for only a week, but we
have been drinking beer since
June."
The idea for the week-end fes
tivities at the German campus
were originated jointly by Ath
letic Chairman Bill Shibley and
Social Chairman Randy Clarke.
But once Cal accepted the chal
lenge, all seventy students at the
Burg pitched in and made ready
for Cal.
The 39 visitors from Cal ar
rived two hours late on Satur
day to be greeted by chants of
"Oski bites" and a chorus of
"The Dirty Golden Bear" from
the Indians.
Welcome
Emerging from the bus, the
Bear females were received en
thusiastically by the Stanford
males. After presentation of bou
quets of weeds, everyone ad
journed to the serious business
of coping with the four 50-liter
kegs of beer which Clarke had
ordered for the evening.
After dinner, at which time the
Cal students were treated to a
flat performance of the Burg jug
band, Clarke invited the visitors
to go for a walk in the woods
surrounding the Beutelsbach
vineyards.
The stroll led to a hilltop,

where the Indians had the dirty
golden bear burning in effigy.
Five dollies in red mini skirts
led the spirited Tribe in yells.
The visitors could only muster
a feeble reply.
But the thirsty Cal squad
came up winners as one-and-a
halfliter glasses were passed
around for the drinking contest.
They received further moral bol
stering when the local U.S. Army

radio station announced the final
Big Game score.
Next morning the weary
Bears, who had been left with
the task of finding a place to
sleep the night before, assembled
at the nearby Endersbach Sport
splatz.
From the start the contest was
one-sided. Under Jim Macy's
leadership, Stanford's defense


STANFORD WINS BIG GAME — Stanfordin-Germany, that is,
as halfback Jim Macy makes a long gain. Germany XIX defeated
the Cal team 52-12.
