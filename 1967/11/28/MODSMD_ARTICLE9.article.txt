## Massarenti Assumes Office, Attacks IJB Ruling 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A versatile political activist
from Italy assumed office yester
day as president of Stanford's
student organization.
Cesare Massarenti — social
scientist, musician, linguist, ac
countant and politician — wast
ed no time in issuing a state
ment supporting the legisla
ture's attack on the Interim
Judicial Bodv 'IJB), an all-fac

ulty court of appeals to the stu
dent judicial council.
Massarenti announced he
would ask the legislature Thurs
day to direct its five representa
tives on the University's Com
mittee of 15 to propose a sub
stitute for the IJB which would
include student members.
Massarenti also listed his
goals as ASSU president, includ
ing making ASSU legally and
financially independent of the
University.
The 26-year-old graduate stu
dent became president when
Peter Lyman resigned the post
Sunday after two months in of
fice. Massarenti will serve the
remainder of the term, which
ends in June.
"I am not going to work
alone," Massarenti said yester
day. "There will be collective
leadership of interested stu
dents." He immediately organiz
ed an executive advisory commit
tee, which he will introduce to
the legislature Thursday.
Massarenti announced he
would carry through Lyman's
plans to form an advisory com
mittee to the Study of Education
at Stanford. He will not neglect
his long-standing plans for new
cultural programs at Stanford,
since "To me, culture is politics

and politics is culture."
In his statement on the IJB,
addressed "To the community,"
Massarenti said "there is no
reason for the students cited by
Dean Joel Smith to place them
selves under the authority of
this illegitimate body." He point
ed out the legislature "does not
recognize an appellate board
which is not composed of stu
dents and faculty," and his "con
stitutional duty" as president re
quires him to seek a substitute
wih student membership.
(The IJB announced hearings
Dec. 5 for 10 students charged
with violating University demon
strations policy in an anti-CIA
protest.)
Massarenti reiterated his sup
port for Lyman's campaign pro
posals for a community govern
ment. Among the other goals he
listed were:
• Restructuring of education,
including consideration of the
freshman year, grading, admis
sions, and overseas campuses.
• Gaining the right of all
women students to live off-cam
pus.
• Integration of foreign stu
dents with the rest of the stu
dent body.
• Ending In loco parentis, the
University's assumption of legal

responsibility for its students.
• Inquiry into the "urban
istic" physical setting of the
University, which discourages
informal gatherings of the com
munity.
• Ending the parking fee for
students.
Massarenti is not a new-comer
to student politics.
Born In Milan
Massarenti was born April 26,
1941, in Milan, Italy, and made
his home there until coming to
this country in 1965. He attend
ed a state secondary school
where he served on the student
council and organized jazz con
certs.
At the same time, he studied
at the Civic School of Music
in Milan, receiving a degree in
composition at age 19. He plays
the trombone, cornet and trum
pet. At the Civic School he first
became interested in electronic
music. He performed his own
composition at concerts in Milan.
Massarenti entered Bocconi
University in Milan in 1959. A
year later he was elected presi
dent of the student union as an
"independent leftist." He was
later chosen president of an or
ganization representing all uni
versity students in Milan.
Reelected student union presi

dent three more times, Massa
renti served until 1964. The two
principal achievements of his
term, he feels, were winning sal
aries for poor university stu
dents and replacing bureaucratic
student governments with as
semblies where all students
could vote.
Massarenti participated in an
ti-government riots in Genoa in
1963. He has never belonged to
a political party.
Massarenti received his laurea,
the equivalent of a masters de
gree, from Bocconi in 1964. Al
though he concentrated in eco
nomics, he wrote his thesis on
statistical methodology.
SpeakH Four Languages
He then traveled throughout
western and eastern Europe.
Massarenti speaks four langu
ages fluently — English, French,
German and Italian — and reads
several others.
Special examinations after
graduation qualified Massarenti
as a practicing accountant and
commercial lawyer. In 1965 he
worked briefly in the credit de
partments of a chemical com
pany and the Italian branch of
First National City Bank.
"I learned from them and
they learned from me," he
recollects.

In 1965 he won a fellowship
to study sociology at Stanford
from the Institute of Internation
al Education. Before leaving
Italy he married the former
Chiara Boeri. Their son Sante
was born last year.
Son Starts In Footsteps
Sante, although only a year
and a half old, has started bring
ing friends home to visit and
speaks a mixture of Italian and
English, according to his proud
father.
Massarenti and his family live
in Escondido Village on campus.
While studying for his doctor
ate in sociology, Massarenti has
been a teaching assistant and
grader. He plans a career in uni
versity teaching.
Massarenti teaches a weekly
seminar in cinema criticism, an
other of his many cultural inter
ests. He is a member of the In
ternational Center policy board.
After finishing his graduate
studies in 1968-69, Massarenti
would like to travel extensively.
Wanted To Be President
His interest in Stanford's stu
dent politics began a year ago
through discussions with stu
dents in sociology 100, when Mas
sarenti was a teaching assistant
for that course.
"I thought I could seriously

contribute to Stanford with my
experience in student politics,"
he said.
Massarenti initially planned to
run for ASSU president in May,
1967. He was persuaded to run
for vice president on a ticket
with Peter Lyman.
Run-Off Not Needed
Their idealistic, theoretical
campaign platform promised ed
ucational reform through "com
munity" action, involving stu
dents and faculty on equal terms.
The Lyman • Massarenti tick
et won 50.1 per cent of the vote
in the primary election, making
a run-off unnecessary. During
the campaign opponents spoke
of Massarenti as a "radical," but
later retracted their statements.
After the election a "division
of labor" was made between Ly
man and Massarenti, with the
vice president concentrating on
cultural programs.
As vice president he set out to
bring jazz performers to campus
to live with students. He also en
visioned a "cultural cooperative"
among Bay Area colleges. He
bought Buddy Guy's band here
in September to start the ASSU
series. The cultural cooperative
has not been formed. An ASSU
committee is continuing to work
on these proposals.

Born In Milan
Massarenti was born April 26,
1941, in Milan, Italy, and made
his home there until coming to
this country in 1965. He attend
ed a state secondary school
where he served on the student
council and organized jazz con
certs.
At the same time, he studied
at the Civic School of Music
in Milan, receiving a degree in
composition at age 19. He plays
the trombone, cornet and trum
pet. At the Civic School he first
became interested in electronic
music. He performed his own
composition at concerts in Milan.
Massarenti entered Bocconi
University in Milan in 1959. A
year later he was elected presi
dent of the student union as an
"independent leftist." He was
later chosen president of an or
ganization representing all uni
versity students in Milan.
Reelected student union presi

dent three more times, Massa
renti served until 1964. The two
principal achievements of his
term, he feels, were winning sal
aries for poor university stu
dents and replacing bureaucratic
student governments with as
semblies where all students
could vote.
Massarenti participated in an
ti-government riots in Genoa in
1963. He has never belonged to
a political party.
Massarenti received his laurea,
the equivalent of a masters de
gree, from Bocconi in 1964. Al
though he concentrated in eco
nomics, he wrote his thesis on
statistical methodology.
SpeakH Four Languages
He then traveled throughout
western and eastern Europe.
Massarenti speaks four langu
ages fluently — English, French,
German and Italian — and reads
several others.
Special examinations after
graduation qualified Massarenti
as a practicing accountant and
commercial lawyer. In 1965 he
worked briefly in the credit de
partments of a chemical com
pany and the Italian branch of
First National City Bank.
"I learned from them and
they learned from me," he
recollects.

In 1965 he won a fellowship
to study sociology at Stanford
from the Institute of Internation
al Education. Before leaving
Italy he married the former
Chiara Boeri. Their son Sante
was born last year.
Son Starts In Footsteps
Sante, although only a year
and a half old, has started bring
ing friends home to visit and
speaks a mixture of Italian and
English, according to his proud
father.
Massarenti and his family live
in Escondido Village on campus.
While studying for his doctor
ate in sociology, Massarenti has
been a teaching assistant and
grader. He plans a career in uni
versity teaching.
Massarenti teaches a weekly
seminar in cinema criticism, an
other of his many cultural inter
ests. He is a member of the In
ternational Center policy board.
After finishing his graduate
studies in 1968-69, Massarenti
would like to travel extensively.
Wanted To Be President
His interest in Stanford's stu
dent politics began a year ago
through discussions with stu
dents in sociology 100, when Mas
sarenti was a teaching assistant
for that course.
"I thought I could seriously

contribute to Stanford with my
experience in student politics,"
he said.
Massarenti initially planned to
run for ASSU president in May,
1967. He was persuaded to run
for vice president on a ticket
with Peter Lyman.
Run-Off Not Needed
Their idealistic, theoretical
campaign platform promised ed
ucational reform through "com
munity" action, involving stu
dents and faculty on equal terms.
The Lyman • Massarenti tick
et won 50.1 per cent of the vote
in the primary election, making
a run-off unnecessary. During
the campaign opponents spoke
of Massarenti as a "radical," but
later retracted their statements.
After the election a "division
of labor" was made between Ly
man and Massarenti, with the
vice president concentrating on
cultural programs.
As vice president he set out to
bring jazz performers to campus
to live with students. He also en
visioned a "cultural cooperative"
among Bay Area colleges. He
bought Buddy Guy's band here
in September to start the ASSU
series. The cultural cooperative
has not been formed. An ASSU
committee is continuing to work
on these proposals.

Massarenti announced he
would ask the legislature Thurs

Massarenti also listed his
goals as ASSU president, includ

reason for the students cited by
Dean Joel Smith to place them
selves under the authority of
this illegitimate body." He point

statistical methodology.
SpeakH Four Languages
He then traveled throughout
western and eastern Europe.
Massarenti speaks four langu
ages fluently — English, French,
German and Italian — and reads
several others.
Special examinations after
graduation qualified Massarenti
as a practicing accountant and
commercial lawyer. In 1965 he
worked briefly in the credit de
partments of a chemical com
pany and the Italian branch of
First National City Bank.
"I learned from them and
they learned from me," he
recollects.

In 1965 he won a fellowship
to study sociology at Stanford
from the Institute of Internation
al Education. Before leaving
Italy he married the former
Chiara Boeri. Their son Sante
was born last year.
Son Starts In Footsteps
Sante, although only a year
and a half old, has started bring

speaks a mixture of Italian and
English, according to his proud
father.
Massarenti and his family live
in Escondido Village on campus.
While studying for his doctor
ate in sociology, Massarenti has
been a teaching assistant and
grader. He plans a career in uni

Massarenti teaches a weekly
seminar in cinema criticism, an
other of his many cultural inter
ests. He is a member of the In

After finishing his graduate
studies in 1968-69, Massarenti
would like to travel extensively.
Wanted To Be President
His interest in Stanford's stu
dent politics began a year ago
through discussions with stu
dents in sociology 100, when Mas
sarenti was a teaching assistant
for that course.
"I thought I could seriously

contribute to Stanford with my
experience in student politics,"
he said.
Massarenti initially planned to
run for ASSU president in May,
1967. He was persuaded to run
for vice president on a ticket
with Peter Lyman.
Run-Off Not Needed
Their idealistic, theoretical
campaign platform promised ed
ucational reform through "com
munity" action, involving stu
dents and faculty on equal terms.
The Lyman • Massarenti tick
et won 50.1 per cent of the vote
in the primary election, making
a run-off unnecessary. During
the campaign opponents spoke
of Massarenti as a "radical," but
later retracted their statements.
After the election a "division
of labor" was made between Ly
man and Massarenti, with the
vice president concentrating on
cultural programs.
As vice president he set out to
bring jazz performers to campus
to live with students. He also en
visioned a "cultural cooperative"
among Bay Area colleges. He
bought Buddy Guy's band here
in September to start the ASSU
series. The cultural cooperative
has not been formed. An ASSU
committee is continuing to work
on these proposals.


CESARE MASSARENTI
A versatile political activist
from Italy assumed office yester
day as president of Stanford's
student organization.
Cesare Massarenti — social
scientist, musician, linguist, ac
countant and politician — wast
ed no time in issuing a state
ment supporting the legisla
ture's attack on the Interim
Judicial Bodv 'IJB), an all-fac

ulty court of appeals to the stu
dent judicial council.
Massarenti announced he
would ask the legislature Thurs
day to direct its five representa
tives on the University's Com
mittee of 15 to propose a sub
stitute for the IJB which would
include student members.
Massarenti also listed his
goals as ASSU president, includ
ing making ASSU legally and
financially independent of the
University.
The 26-year-old graduate stu
dent became president when
Peter Lyman resigned the post
Sunday after two months in of
fice. Massarenti will serve the
remainder of the term, which
ends in June.
"I am not going to work
alone," Massarenti said yester
day. "There will be collective
leadership of interested stu
dents." He immediately organiz
ed an executive advisory commit
tee, which he will introduce to
the legislature Thursday.
Massarenti announced he
would carry through Lyman's
plans to form an advisory com
mittee to the Study of Education
at Stanford. He will not neglect
his long-standing plans for new
cultural programs at Stanford,
since "To me, culture is politics

and politics is culture."
In his statement on the IJB,
addressed "To the community,"
Massarenti said "there is no
reason for the students cited by
Dean Joel Smith to place them
selves under the authority of
this illegitimate body." He point
ed out the legislature "does not
recognize an appellate board
which is not composed of stu
dents and faculty," and his "con
stitutional duty" as president re
quires him to seek a substitute
wih student membership.
(The IJB announced hearings
Dec. 5 for 10 students charged
with violating University demon
strations policy in an anti-CIA
protest.)
Massarenti reiterated his sup
port for Lyman's campaign pro
posals for a community govern
ment. Among the other goals he
listed were:
• Restructuring of education,
including consideration of the
freshman year, grading, admis
sions, and overseas campuses.
• Gaining the right of all
women students to live off-cam
pus.
• Integration of foreign stu
dents with the rest of the stu
dent body.
• Ending In loco parentis, the
University's assumption of legal

responsibility for its students.
• Inquiry into the "urban
istic" physical setting of the
University, which discourages
informal gatherings of the com
munity.
• Ending the parking fee for
students.
Massarenti is not a new-comer
to student politics.

CESARE MASSARENTI
A versatile political activist
from Italy assumed office yester
day as president of Stanford's
student organization.
Cesare Massarenti — social
scientist, musician, linguist, ac
countant and politician — wast
ed no time in issuing a state
ment supporting the legisla
ture's attack on the Interim
Judicial Bodv 'IJB), an all-fac

ulty court of appeals to the stu
dent judicial council.
Massarenti announced he
would ask the legislature Thurs
day to direct its five representa
tives on the University's Com
mittee of 15 to propose a sub
stitute for the IJB which would
include student members.
Massarenti also listed his
goals as ASSU president, includ
ing making ASSU legally and
financially independent of the
University.
The 26-year-old graduate stu
dent became president when
Peter Lyman resigned the post
Sunday after two months in of
fice. Massarenti will serve the
remainder of the term, which
ends in June.
"I am not going to work
alone," Massarenti said yester
day. "There will be collective
leadership of interested stu
dents." He immediately organiz
ed an executive advisory commit
tee, which he will introduce to
the legislature Thursday.
Massarenti announced he
would carry through Lyman's
plans to form an advisory com
mittee to the Study of Education
at Stanford. He will not neglect
his long-standing plans for new
cultural programs at Stanford,
since "To me, culture is politics

and politics is culture."
In his statement on the IJB,
addressed "To the community,"
Massarenti said "there is no
reason for the students cited by
Dean Joel Smith to place them
selves under the authority of
this illegitimate body." He point
ed out the legislature "does not
recognize an appellate board
which is not composed of stu
dents and faculty," and his "con
stitutional duty" as president re
quires him to seek a substitute
wih student membership.
(The IJB announced hearings
Dec. 5 for 10 students charged
with violating University demon
strations policy in an anti-CIA
protest.)
Massarenti reiterated his sup
port for Lyman's campaign pro
posals for a community govern
ment. Among the other goals he
listed were:
• Restructuring of education,
including consideration of the
freshman year, grading, admis
sions, and overseas campuses.
• Gaining the right of all
women students to live off-cam
pus.
• Integration of foreign stu
dents with the rest of the stu
dent body.
• Ending In loco parentis, the
University's assumption of legal

responsibility for its students.
• Inquiry into the "urban
istic" physical setting of the
University, which discourages
informal gatherings of the com
munity.
• Ending the parking fee for
students.
Massarenti is not a new-comer
to student politics.
Born In Milan
Massarenti was born April 26,
1941, in Milan, Italy, and made
his home there until coming to
this country in 1965. He attend
ed a state secondary school
where he served on the student
council and organized jazz con
certs.
At the same time, he studied
at the Civic School of Music
in Milan, receiving a degree in
composition at age 19. He plays
the trombone, cornet and trum
pet. At the Civic School he first
became interested in electronic
music. He performed his own
composition at concerts in Milan.
Massarenti entered Bocconi
University in Milan in 1959. A
year later he was elected presi
dent of the student union as an
"independent leftist." He was
later chosen president of an or
ganization representing all uni
versity students in Milan.
Reelected student union presi

dent three more times, Massa
renti served until 1964. The two
principal achievements of his
term, he feels, were winning sal
aries for poor university stu
dents and replacing bureaucratic
student governments with as
semblies where all students
could vote.
Massarenti participated in an
ti-government riots in Genoa in
1963. He has never belonged to
a political party.
Massarenti received his laurea,
the equivalent of a masters de
gree, from Bocconi in 1964. Al
though he concentrated in eco
nomics, he wrote his thesis on
statistical methodology.
SpeakH Four Languages
He then traveled throughout
western and eastern Europe.
Massarenti speaks four langu
ages fluently — English, French,
German and Italian — and reads
several others.
Special examinations after
graduation qualified Massarenti
as a practicing accountant and
commercial lawyer. In 1965 he
worked briefly in the credit de
partments of a chemical com
pany and the Italian branch of
First National City Bank.
"I learned from them and
they learned from me," he
recollects.

In 1965 he won a fellowship
to study sociology at Stanford
from the Institute of Internation
al Education. Before leaving
Italy he married the former
Chiara Boeri. Their son Sante
was born last year.
Son Starts In Footsteps
Sante, although only a year
and a half old, has started bring
ing friends home to visit and
speaks a mixture of Italian and
English, according to his proud
father.
Massarenti and his family live
in Escondido Village on campus.
While studying for his doctor
ate in sociology, Massarenti has
been a teaching assistant and
grader. He plans a career in uni
versity teaching.
Massarenti teaches a weekly
seminar in cinema criticism, an
other of his many cultural inter
ests. He is a member of the In
ternational Center policy board.
After finishing his graduate
studies in 1968-69, Massarenti
would like to travel extensively.
Wanted To Be President
His interest in Stanford's stu
dent politics began a year ago
through discussions with stu
dents in sociology 100, when Mas
sarenti was a teaching assistant
for that course.
"I thought I could seriously

contribute to Stanford with my
experience in student politics,"
he said.
Massarenti initially planned to
run for ASSU president in May,
1967. He was persuaded to run
for vice president on a ticket
with Peter Lyman.
Run-Off Not Needed
Their idealistic, theoretical
campaign platform promised ed
ucational reform through "com
munity" action, involving stu
dents and faculty on equal terms.
