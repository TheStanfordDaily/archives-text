# UC Suspends Anti-Drafters
## 
### BENTON ROLPH 
The University of California
yesterday suspended Reese Er
lich and Peter Camejo, two of
the 11 students and TA's who
were cited during the October
Stop the Draft Week as violat
ors of university rules concern
ing student political activity.
And last night the steering
committee of the campus-wide
Movement Against Political
Suspensions (MAPS) met in
secret session to finalize prev
iously made plans to stage mass
demonstrations on the Berkeley
campus if Chancellor Roger
Heyns actually suspended any
one. At a general MAPS meet
ing Nov. 19, 500 persons voted
"to disrupt" if suspensions were
handed down.
The demonstration, described
previously as "a disruptive mill
in," will take place today fol
lowing a rally on the Sproul
Hall steps at noon. Students will
mill-in at three locations simul
taneously: the Chancellor's of
fice, Sproul Hall, and Moses
Hall.
Five others of the original 11
violators were given "suspended
suspensions" by the Chancellor
(they will not have to leave the
university) and the last four
were placed on disciplinary pro
bation. Erlich's and Camejo's
suspensions extend until Fall
Quarter 1968.
Erlich was dismayed by the
suspension. "Chancellor Heyns
has clearly shown that he is
suspending students for politi

cal activity. These particular
suspensions smash any image
of the legitimacy of the Chan
cellor's rules. Neither Pete
Camejo nor I have ever been
cited by the University before."
Chancellor Heyns announced
the suspensions in a six-page
paper yesterday saying, in part,
that in reaching his decision he
"tried to take account of the
relevant and reliable circum
stances bearing on the quality
of each individual's violations,
his past disciplinary record, the
likelihood of future violations
and contribution and commit
ment to the University as a self
governing academic institution."
A reporter for the Daily Call
fornian, the Berkeley student
newspaper, explained yesterday
afternoon that the singling-out
of Erlich and Camejo for sus
pension indicates a certain strat
egy of restraint on the part of
the Chancellor.
Although Camejo did run for
mayor of Berkeley last April,
his following as a student leader
is not extensive. Erlich's sup
porters are likewise not as fer
vent nor as numerous as those
of other cited students and
teaching assistants, according to
the Dally Cal reporter.
That none of the four teach
ing assistants involved were dis
missed is also significant, since
the American Federation of
Teachers, Local 1570, which is
the Berkeley TA's labor union,
threatened a strike if the sus
pensions affected any of their
members.

of the legitimacy of the Chan
cellor's rules. Neither Pete
Camejo nor I have ever been
cited by the University before."
Chancellor Heyns announced
the suspensions in a six-page
paper yesterday saying, in part,
that in reaching his decision he
"tried to take account of the
relevant and reliable circum
stances bearing on the quality
of each individual's violations,
his past disciplinary record, the
likelihood of future violations
and contribution and commit
ment to the University as a self
governing academic institution."
A reporter for the Daily Call
fornian, the Berkeley student
newspaper, explained yesterday
afternoon that the singling-out
of Erlich and Camejo for sus
pension indicates a certain strat
egy of restraint on the part of
the Chancellor.
Although Camejo did run for
mayor of Berkeley last April,
his following as a student leader
is not extensive. Erlich's sup
porters are likewise not as fer
vent nor as numerous as those
of other cited students and
teaching assistants, according to
the Dally Cal reporter.
That none of the four teach
ing assistants involved were dis
missed is also significant, since
the American Federation of
Teachers, Local 1570, which is
the Berkeley TA's labor union,
threatened a strike if the sus
pensions affected any of their
members.
The University of California
yesterday suspended Reese Er
lich and Peter Camejo, two of
the 11 students and TA's who
were cited during the October
Stop the Draft Week as violat
ors of university rules concern
ing student political activity.
And last night the steering
committee of the campus-wide
Movement Against Political
Suspensions (MAPS) met in
secret session to finalize prev
iously made plans to stage mass
demonstrations on the Berkeley
campus if Chancellor Roger
Heyns actually suspended any
one. At a general MAPS meet
ing Nov. 19, 500 persons voted
"to disrupt" if suspensions were
handed down.
The demonstration, described
previously as "a disruptive mill
in," will take place today fol
lowing a rally on the Sproul
Hall steps at noon. Students will
mill-in at three locations simul
taneously: the Chancellor's of
fice, Sproul Hall, and Moses
Hall.
Five others of the original 11
violators were given "suspended
suspensions" by the Chancellor
(they will not have to leave the
university) and the last four
were placed on disciplinary pro
bation. Erlich's and Camejo's
suspensions extend until Fall
Quarter 1968.
Erlich was dismayed by the
suspension. "Chancellor Heyns
has clearly shown that he is
suspending students for politi

cal activity. These particular
suspensions smash any image
of the legitimacy of the Chan
cellor's rules. Neither Pete
Camejo nor I have ever been
cited by the University before."
