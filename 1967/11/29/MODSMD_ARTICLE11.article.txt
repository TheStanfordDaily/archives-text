## Learning About 'Life' 
### 
Editor, the Dally:
It appears that David Harris
and now Peter Lyman have dis
covered something about "life."
First, in a democratic environ
ment, decisions most often are
made by compromise—the art
of politics, if you will. By con
sidering themselves not politi
cians and hence unsuited for the
office of ASSU President, per
haps they have indicated that
they are unable or unwilling to
compromise.
Secondly, Harris and Lyman
have discovered that it takes con
siderable time and effort to run
a university. In the community
of scholars which they desire,
all the scholars must find time
to sit in committees and argue,
discuss, decide, and even com
promise in order to achieve pro
gress. Such progress is often
plow, and is time-consuming. In
the evolution of the modern uni
versity, "professional" adminis
trators were chosen to do much
of this time-consuming work.
Still many teacher - scholars
spend many hours assisting in
the decision-making and admin
istrative work of the university.
Harris and Lyman have discov
ered that being a scholar and at
the same time contributing to
the operation of the university
is a demanding task—too de
manding a task for them it
seems.
They would be the "thinkers"
rather than the "do'ers"—but I
perceive that the "do'ers" are
running things. Perhaps this is
the lesson on "life" which our
ex-ASSU Presidents must learn.

Editor, the Daily:
The bathctic musings of Peter
Lyman and his commiserators
are just too much! I find it
rather discouraging to envision
even the hyper-sentimental, ro
mantically alienated, chronically
world-sick Stanford idealists
swallowing Lyman's diagnosis of
the ills bearing on student politi

cal efficiency in the University
community.
Students shouldn't try to
blame everything on the sys
tem, or on their helpless de
moralization, or on the need for
some unglimpsed "reform," or
on the cruel absence of some in
alienable "power;" often they
should just take a look at them
selves, and see if they're the
kind of considerate, responsible,
rational thinkers that might be
able to sustain a truly intellec
tual community.

Editor, the Daily:
At last, out of the chaos of
the last few months, the first

glimmerings of order are ap
parent in the new Lomita Mall
on the north side of Quad. By
all appearances, we will soon
have an area rivaling the pres
ent White Memorial Plaza in
its relaxing attractiveness. But,
what do these improvements be
speak of the colorful and illus
trious history of Stanford?
As a case in point, I ask
whether another White Plaza
Memorial fountain ("Mem
Claw") should be erected on our
new Mall. Granted, the White
Plaza Memorial fountain is at
tractive; but mere attractive
ness is not a sufficient criterion
for the design or choice of a
fountain.
I would urge very strongly
that the merits of the following
proposal be considered:
Since its organization in 1891,
the University has been pos
sessed of some remarkable stat
uary. I speak, particularly, of
that monument to the bronze
caster's art, that statue of the
founding family which formerly
graced the Memorial Court in
Quad. For some inexplicable
reason, this statue, often jocu
larly (although somewhat ir
reverently) y-clept "The Holy
Family", has never regained its
place of prominence in the eyes
(and hearts) of the Stanford
population.
At the cost of transportation
and only a few hours of a
trained plumber's time, we
could combine the bronzed em
bodiment of the Stanford tradi
tion and the modern propensity
for large, colorful fountains.
How glorious, how fitting it
would be!

(Editor's Note: The Planning
Office stated that there are, at
the present, no plans for a foun
tain in Lomita Mall. If such
plans are made in the future,
however, they assured us that
the fountain will not be another
Mem Claw.)

The bathctic musings of Peter
Lyman and his commiserators
are just too much! I find it
rather discouraging to envision
even the hyper-sentimental, ro
mantically alienated, chronically
world-sick Stanford idealists
swallowing Lyman's diagnosis of
the ills bearing on student politi

cal efficiency in the University
community.
Students shouldn't try to
blame everything on the sys
tem, or on their helpless de
moralization, or on the need for
some unglimpsed "reform," or
on the cruel absence of some in
alienable "power;" often they
should just take a look at them
selves, and see if they're the
kind of considerate, responsible,
rational thinkers that might be
able to sustain a truly intellec
tual community.

Editor, the Daily:
At last, out of the chaos of
the last few months, the first

glimmerings of order are ap
parent in the new Lomita Mall
on the north side of Quad. By
all appearances, we will soon
have an area rivaling the pres
ent White Memorial Plaza in
its relaxing attractiveness. But,
what do these improvements be
speak of the colorful and illus
trious history of Stanford?
As a case in point, I ask
whether another White Plaza
Memorial fountain ("Mem
Claw") should be erected on our
new Mall. Granted, the White
Plaza Memorial fountain is at
tractive; but mere attractive
ness is not a sufficient criterion
for the design or choice of a
fountain.
I would urge very strongly
that the merits of the following
proposal be considered:
Since its organization in 1891,
the University has been pos
sessed of some remarkable stat
uary. I speak, particularly, of
that monument to the bronze
caster's art, that statue of the
founding family which formerly
graced the Memorial Court in
Quad. For some inexplicable
reason, this statue, often jocu
larly (although somewhat ir
reverently) y-clept "The Holy
Family", has never regained its
place of prominence in the eyes
(and hearts) of the Stanford
population.
At the cost of transportation
and only a few hours of a
trained plumber's time, we
could combine the bronzed em
bodiment of the Stanford tradi
tion and the modern propensity
for large, colorful fountains.
How glorious, how fitting it
would be!

THE HOLY FAMILY
Editor, the Dally:
It appears that David Harris
and now Peter Lyman have dis
covered something about "life."
First, in a democratic environ
ment, decisions most often are
made by compromise—the art
of politics, if you will. By con
sidering themselves not politi
cians and hence unsuited for the
office of ASSU President, per
haps they have indicated that
they are unable or unwilling to
compromise.
Secondly, Harris and Lyman
have discovered that it takes con
siderable time and effort to run
a university. In the community
of scholars which they desire,
all the scholars must find time
to sit in committees and argue,
discuss, decide, and even com
promise in order to achieve pro
gress. Such progress is often
plow, and is time-consuming. In
the evolution of the modern uni
versity, "professional" adminis
trators were chosen to do much
of this time-consuming work.
Still many teacher - scholars
spend many hours assisting in
the decision-making and admin
istrative work of the university.
Harris and Lyman have discov

the operation of the university
is a demanding task—too de

At last, out of the chaos of
the last few months, the first

glimmerings of order are ap
parent in the new Lomita Mall
on the north side of Quad. By
all appearances, we will soon
have an area rivaling the pres
ent White Memorial Plaza in
its relaxing attractiveness. But,
what do these improvements be
speak of the colorful and illus
trious history of Stanford?
As a case in point, I ask
whether another White Plaza
Memorial fountain ("Mem
Claw") should be erected on our
new Mall. Granted, the White
Plaza Memorial fountain is at
tractive; but mere attractive
ness is not a sufficient criterion
for the design or choice of a
fountain.
I would urge very strongly
that the merits of the following
proposal be considered:
Since its organization in 1891,
the University has been pos
sessed of some remarkable stat
uary. I speak, particularly, of
that monument to the bronze
caster's art, that statue of the
founding family which formerly
graced the Memorial Court in
Quad. For some inexplicable
reason, this statue, often jocu
larly (although somewhat ir
reverently) y-clept "The Holy
Family", has never regained its
place of prominence in the eyes
(and hearts) of the Stanford
population.
At the cost of transportation
and only a few hours of a
trained plumber's time, we
could combine the bronzed em
bodiment of the Stanford tradi
tion and the modern propensity
for large, colorful fountains.
How glorious, how fitting it
would be!

THE HOLY FAMILY
Editor, the Dally:
It appears that David Harris
and now Peter Lyman have dis
covered something about "life."
First, in a democratic environ
ment, decisions most often are
made by compromise—the art
of politics, if you will. By con
sidering themselves not politi
cians and hence unsuited for the
office of ASSU President, per
haps they have indicated that
they are unable or unwilling to
compromise.
Secondly, Harris and Lyman
have discovered that it takes con
siderable time and effort to run
a university. In the community
of scholars which they desire,
all the scholars must find time
to sit in committees and argue,
discuss, decide, and even com
promise in order to achieve pro
gress. Such progress is often
plow, and is time-consuming. In
the evolution of the modern uni
versity, "professional" adminis
trators were chosen to do much
of this time-consuming work.
Still many teacher - scholars
spend many hours assisting in
the decision-making and admin
istrative work of the university.
Harris and Lyman have discov
ered that being a scholar and at
the same time contributing to
the operation of the university
is a demanding task—too de
manding a task for them it
seems.
They would be the "thinkers"
rather than the "do'ers"—but I
perceive that the "do'ers" are
running things. Perhaps this is
the lesson on "life" which our
ex-ASSU Presidents must learn.

Editor, the Daily:
The bathctic musings of Peter
Lyman and his commiserators
are just too much! I find it
rather discouraging to envision
even the hyper-sentimental, ro
mantically alienated, chronically
world-sick Stanford idealists
swallowing Lyman's diagnosis of
the ills bearing on student politi

cal efficiency in the University
community.
Students shouldn't try to
blame everything on the sys
tem, or on their helpless de
moralization, or on the need for
some unglimpsed "reform," or
on the cruel absence of some in
alienable "power;" often they
should just take a look at them
selves, and see if they're the
kind of considerate, responsible,
rational thinkers that might be
able to sustain a truly intellec
tual community.
