To the community:
On November 21, the Legislature passed the following measure:
"Be it enacted by the Legislature of the Associated Students here
assembled that Article I, Section I-B-3 be amended to read as follows:
3. To be cognizant of and uphold ASSU and University policies
and regulations. VIOLATIONS OF UNIVERSITY POLICIES AND
REGULATIONS ARE NOT PER SE VIOLATIONS OF THE FUN
DAMENTAL STANDARD. In the event that University policy and
the ASSU Constitution and By-Laws conflict, the latter shall be con
trolling in ASSU judicial proceedings. Potential judicial liability
must be considered with reference to Section D, 2.
B. In Article I, Section I-D-3, delete the words 'Until such student
faculty Appeals Board is established, the student may appeal the de
cision to an appellate board of three persons appointed by the Presi
dent of the University from a panel of not more than six nominated
by the Executive Committee of the Academic Council. The functions
of such an appellate board, the rights of the parties to the proceed
ings, and the procedure to be followed by such board shall be a
proper subject of discussions by the Committee of Fifteen,' and
substitute the following: 'The ASSU does not currently recognize
any appellate board that is not a joint student-faculty body."
As president of the ASSU, I have the constitutional duty to see
that LASSU decisions are put into effect. The Legislature does not
recognize an appellate board which is not composed of students and
faculty. The Interim Judicial Board presently lacks the required
student members. Consequently, there is no reason for the students
cited by Dean J. Smith to place themselves under the authority
of this illegitimate body.
.. On Thursday, Nov. 30,1 will ask the Legislature to refer this
matter to the Committee of Fifteen with priority.
Sincerely,
Cesare Massarenti
