## Right To Your Leftâ€” The Fascist Liberal 
### Harvey Hukari 
Over the past two years, it
has become increasingly fash
ionable among New Left circles
to employ such picturesque
terms as fascist or Nazi when
referring to the various individ
uals or institutions which stand
in the way of the Radicals'
blitzkrieg for peace and econom
ic redistribution.
Scarcely anyone in a position
of prominence, from General
Westmoreland to Ronald Rea
gan, who articulates a "Hawk
ish" viewpoint on the Vietnam
War has escaped these emotion
laden designations.
Now the police forces of Oak
land and San Jose have also
achieved the same status in the
eyes of student extremists be
cause of their forceful actions in
curtailing recent demonstra
tions.
Yet the real fascists in our
society are not the police but
the fanatics of the Left who are
tearing at the very fabric and
structure of our nation through
violent protests which have
brought some college campuses
to the brink of anarchy.
Sound Familiar?
In terms of methods and ends,
there are striking similarities
between the ideology of the
New Left and Hitler's Germany.
The demonstrators at Berke
ley, Oakland and San Jose State
compare favorably with the
Brownshirts of the 1930's for
neither lacked the will to utilize
violent, destructive means in or
der to fulfill their self-righteous
vision of how society schould be
ordered. The "Peace or else"
stormtroopers are gripped by an
obsession for peace which ra
tionalizes any illegal or pernic
ious act necessary to accomplish
that end.
One finds many of the same
socialist goals of the New Left
manifested in Nazi Germany.
Becoming Average
Facism there provided for the
nationalization of such indus
tries as shipping, mining and
banking and exhibited a concern
for the working man that would
warm the heart of Walter
Reuther. The expansion of gov-

ernment control over industry
and nearly all forms of human
endeavor that took place in
Germany is an achievement not
that far removed from the aspir
ations of contemporary Ameri
can Radicals who seem intent
on subjecting the populus to a
mass average.
The paranoia which motivates
the radical Left is rooted in a
distrust of debate, dialogue and
democracy which is also found
in fascism. It is a distorted be
lief that sees change as impos
sible through the existing sys
tem and thus detaches itself
from American political tradi
tion.
At Stanford, this brand of in
digenous fascism appears to be
enjoying an accelerated period
of development fertilized by the
predominant Liberal mentality
which accepts the mistreatment
of a Vice President, or the de
struction of property in the
name of peace, as justifiable.

The recent S.D.S. protest
against the C.I.A. was nothing
more than a political panty raid,
an act of adolescent exhibition
ism, but it may well be a pre
lude to more militant and vio
lent acts if these fascists are
afforded the continued indulg
ence of such members of the
Stanford community as Profes
sors Charles Drekmeier and
Mark Mancall and the inimical
Doan Napier.
The threat to freedom, sta
bility and orderly change on this
campus comes not from a
bumbling archaic administra
tion but from S.D.S., the Resist
ance and the Anti-Draft Union,
all of which have inherited an
essentially totalitarian percep
tion of where this country
should be and how it should get
there.
Given these considerations,
when the time comes again for
the local Leftists to embark
upon a campaign to find more
fascists to label, it might be far
more rewarding if, instead of
searching in the Pentagon, En
cina Hall or under their beds,
they looked in a mirror.

The recent S.D.S. protest
against the C.I.A. was nothing
more than a political panty raid,
an act of adolescent exhibition
ism, but it may well be a pre
lude to more militant and vio
lent acts if these fascists are
afforded the continued indulg
ence of such members of the
Stanford community as Profes
sors Charles Drekmeier and
Mark Mancall and the inimical
Doan Napier.
The threat to freedom, sta
bility and orderly change on this
campus comes not from a
bumbling archaic administra
tion but from S.D.S., the Resist
ance and the Anti-Draft Union,
all of which have inherited an
essentially totalitarian percep
tion of where this country
should be and how it should get
there.
Given these considerations,
when the time comes again for
the local Leftists to embark
upon a campaign to find more
fascists to label, it might be far
more rewarding if, instead of
searching in the Pentagon, En
cina Hall or under their beds,
they looked in a mirror.
Over the past two years, it
has become increasingly fash
ionable among New Left circles
to employ such picturesque
terms as fascist or Nazi when
referring to the various individ
uals or institutions which stand
in the way of the Radicals'
blitzkrieg for peace and econom
ic redistribution.
Scarcely anyone in a position
of prominence, from General
Westmoreland to Ronald Rea
gan, who articulates a "Hawk
ish" viewpoint on the Vietnam
War has escaped these emotion
laden designations.
Now the police forces of Oak
land and San Jose have also
achieved the same status in the
eyes of student extremists be
cause of their forceful actions in
curtailing recent demonstra
tions.
Yet the real fascists in our
society are not the police but
the fanatics of the Left who are
tearing at the very fabric and
structure of our nation through
violent protests which have
brought some college campuses
to the brink of anarchy.

The demonstrators at Berke
