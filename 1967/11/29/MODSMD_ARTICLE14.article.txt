### DAN SNELL 
Leafing through 112 the Time
Schedule recently in my unend
ing search for relevant and
meaningful courses, I hit upon
an idea. The famed Study of
Education at Stanford in work
ing "toward a more flexible u
dergraduate program" should
recommend that students be able
to forge their own major pro
grams in fields that match their
interests.
The possibilities are truly
without limit. Students who
must now fit their interests to
the rigid demands of one of the
University's departments could
then create their own course of
study.
For example, the student who
elected a major in copulation
would of course want to take
Biology 4 and 5. He could then
go on to Biology 153, "Physio
logical Basis of Behavior";
Chemistry 122, "Organic Prepa
rations"; Communication 100,
"Visual and Aural Communica
tion Techniques". Finally he
would want to take Health Edu
cation 121, "Marriage and Fam
ily"; and Latin 28, "Ovid."
But if the student wanted to

go a bit more off the beaten
track, so to speak, he could do
that too. The necrophilia (inordi
nate interest in death) major
could take Anatomy 121, "Dis
section of the Human Body";
Biology 260, "Seminar in Popu
lation Biology"; and Greek 102,
"Tragedy".
And to wind up his study of
death, he'd enroll in Chemistry
263, "Thermodynamics of Irre
versible Processes"; Naval Sci
ence 312, "Evolution of the Art
of War"; and perhaps English
145, "John Donne" for a literary
perspective on his subject.
For a catastrophes major So
ciology 105, "Organizational Be
havior" would be a start. Po
litical Science 248, "Seminar on
Theories of Conflict"; Psychol
ogy 131, "Abnormal Psycholo
gy"; and History lOli, "Revolu
tion" would help. For a view of
natural catastrophes the student
could take Geology 204, "Physics
of Underground Fluids."
No Such Luck
But I fear the Study of Edu
cation has no such flexibility in
mind. That is to be expected,
however, since there are prac
tical considerations involved.
For instance, what sort of a
job could a necrophilia major
get that would make him a cred
it to Stanford's name? He could
become an undertaker, of course,
but how many rich (and gen
erous) undertakers has one
heard of?
And in the case of the copu
lation major? He would find
himself an outcast from society
unable to make a living, except
of course by using what he
learned at Stanford. And his fate
would be blamed, like so much
else, on the Study of Education.

job could a necrophilia major
get that would make him a cred
it to Stanford's name? He could
become an undertaker, of course,
but how many rich (and gen
erous) undertakers has one
heard of?
And in the case of the copu
lation major? He would find
himself an outcast from society
unable to make a living, except
of course by using what he
learned at Stanford. And his fate
would be blamed, like so much
else, on the Study of Education.
Leafing through 112 the Time
Schedule recently in my unend
ing search for relevant and
meaningful courses, I hit upon
an idea. The famed Study of
Education at Stanford in work
ing "toward a more flexible u
dergraduate program" should
recommend that students be able
to forge their own major pro
grams in fields that match their
interests.
The possibilities are truly
without limit. Students who
must now fit their interests to
the rigid demands of one of the
University's departments could
then create their own course of
study.
For example, the student who
elected a major in copulation
would of course want to take
Biology 4 and 5. He could then
go on to Biology 153, "Physio
logical Basis of Behavior";
Chemistry 122, "Organic Prepa
rations"; Communication 100,
"Visual and Aural Communica
tion Techniques". Finally he
would want to take Health Edu
cation 121, "Marriage and Fam
ily"; and Latin 28, "Ovid."
But if the student wanted to

go a bit more off the beaten
track, so to speak, he could do
that too. The necrophilia (inordi
nate interest in death) major
could take Anatomy 121, "Dis
section of the Human Body";
Biology 260, "Seminar in Popu
lation Biology"; and Greek 102,
"Tragedy".
And to wind up his study of
death, he'd enroll in Chemistry
263, "Thermodynamics of Irre
versible Processes"; Naval Sci
ence 312, "Evolution of the Art
of War"; and perhaps English
145, "John Donne" for a literary
perspective on his subject.
For a catastrophes major So
ciology 105, "Organizational Be
havior" would be a start. Po
litical Science 248, "Seminar on
Theories of Conflict"; Psychol
ogy 131, "Abnormal Psycholo
gy"; and History lOli, "Revolu
tion" would help. For a view of
natural catastrophes the student
could take Geology 204, "Physics
of Underground Fluids."
No Such Luck
But I fear the Study of Edu
cation has no such flexibility in
mind. That is to be expected,
however, since there are prac
tical considerations involved.
For instance, what sort of a
job could a necrophilia major
get that would make him a cred
it to Stanford's name? He could
become an undertaker, of course,
