# Suspend 4 At SF State
## 
### 
Four San Franicsco State Col
lege students were suspended
yesterday for beating the editor
and staff members of the cam
pus newspaper.
Two were suspended for a
year and the others for a semes
ter for their part in an attack
on editor Jim Vaszko and his
staff. Five others were either put
on probation or sent letters of
warning.
Vaszko criticized the punish
ment as "pretty light, especially
the letters of warning."
The nine students, members
of the Black Student Union,
pleaded not guilty Monday in
Municipal Court to criminal
charges stemming from the
Nov. 6 incident. A preliminary
hearing was scheduled Jan 29.
President John Summerskill
announced the punishments,
recommended by a faculty
board of appeal. He refused to
say which students received the
various penalties because of the
pending criminal action.
