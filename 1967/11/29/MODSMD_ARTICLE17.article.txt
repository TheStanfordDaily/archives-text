# 'Threepenny Opera' To Be Performed
## 
### CONNIE COLLIER 
With a piano, a spotlight, and
the imagination of his audience,
Gerhard Lenssen alone puts on
a play. A few chords from the
piano form the orchestra, his
voice plays all the roles, and his
gestures create the scene for
the production of The Three
penny Opera by Bertoldt Brecht
and Kurt Weill.
It will be presented by the
Goethe Institute Thursday at
8 p.m. in Tresidder large lounge.
This is Lenssen's first tour in
the U.S. He is a citizen of the
Federal Republic of Germany
and has performed in cities
there, as well as in Europe, the
Near East, and South America.
He founded his theater consist
ing of only himself nine years

ago. Various reviews have
termed his performance a "small
triumph of mind over matter,"
and a "middle-sized earthquake."
One critic in Frankfurt has ex
pressed the view of many others
that "Lenssen's performance ap
pears to be without equal. From
scene to scene the amazement of
the audience grew, the captivat
ing tension increased. It seemed
almost inconceivable that a sin
gle person could summon al
most simultaneously to the
situations, happenings, voices,
and reflections in both .modest
and flexible harmony with the
musical aspects of the piece.
