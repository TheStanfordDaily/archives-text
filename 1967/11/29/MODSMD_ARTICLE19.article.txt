# Panel Tells Frosh About Frat Life
## 
### 
To rush a fraternity or not
to rush.
Members of six un-named fra
ternities helped approximately
40 freshmen answer that ques
tion last night in a panel discus
sion at Madera House, Wilbur.
Moderator Dan Williams, asst.
dean of studies, stated that the
panel might have been only the
first in a series.
The dicussion centered around
questions involving rush proce
dures, how to choose a frater
nity, the social aspects, and the
theory that as a way of living
the fraternity is dying out.
Many attending were concern
ed with the single "bong" or
"bing" system of selective rush.
Some representatives felt that
there is a trend at Stanford to
abandon that system. However it
was pointed out that the major
ity of fraternities still use the
single "bong" system and one
speaker expressed the opinion
that "never will all the frater
nities go to some kind of draw
system, random or otherwise."
Williams pointed out that the
single "bong" is written into the
national constitutions and that in
reality very few Stanford fra
ternities practice the system
strictly. One member said that
due to factors like group pres
sure if you are wanted in a fra
ternity one person will not be
able to keep you out.
Another member encouraged
listeners, "Everybody here who
wants to join a fraternity can
get into one he likes."
This year, in trying to allow
the freshmen to get to know the
various fraternities, an attempt
is being made to eliminate the
"limited contact" rush policy.
Hopefully, rushees will be in
vited to meals, discussions, open
houses and parties. "This policy
will place a lot of the initia
tive on the freshman in learning
about the different houses," a
panel member said.
The fraternity as a way of
living was described as an in
dividual effort. "It's your house;
it's what you make it," said one

speaker. "If you have an idea,
instead of bringing it up at a
meeting, go ahead and do it."
Even with this emphasis on
the individual, the fraternity was
cited as the best alternative for
one who enjoys group living
and brotherhood. Commenting
on the theory that the fraternity
is dying, one mpnihnr
"What a fraternity involves for
me is trust and frk-nttsiup,
which can never become ar
chaic."
