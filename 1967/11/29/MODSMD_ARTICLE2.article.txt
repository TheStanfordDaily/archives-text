# Nobel Researcher Returns To Dedicate Bio Building
## 
### 
A biologist whose Stanford
research in the early 1940's won
a Nobel Prize will return to the
University this week to dedicate
the new $5 million home of his
former department.
Dr. George W. Beadle, now
president of the University of
Chicago, will be the principal
speaker tomorrow afternoon at
dedication ceremonies for the
recently completed William F.
Herrin Hall and Laboratories.
The impressive new buildings,
just across Serra Street and
northwest of Quad, were occu
pied this fall by the Biological
Sciences Department.
Stanford President Wallace
Sterling and W. Parmer Fuller
111, president of the Board of
Trustees, also will speak at the
dedication ceremonies to be held
in the nearby Physics Lecture
Hall at 3:30 p.m. Professor Don

aid Kennedy, head of the Bio
logical Sciences Department,
will introduce the speakers.
Preceding the dedication, Her
rin Hall and Laboratories will
hold open house beginning at
2 p.m. A reception for invited
guests will be held later at 4:30
p.m. in the Falconer Biology
Library on the third floor of
Herrin Hall.
In the basement "catacombs"
of the department's old home,
Jordan Hall, Dr. Beadle teamed
with Dr. Edward L. Tatum in
research on bread molds. To
gether they discovered how to
produce mutations almost at
will, and their work opened up
a new field of biology-biochemi
cal genetics.

The two men shared the 1958
Nobel Prize for Medicine and
Physiology with Dr. Joshua
Lederberg, who now heads the
Genetics Department at Stan
ford's School of Medicine.
More than $3 million of the
buildings' cost came from the
William F. Herrin Foundation,
established at Stanford with
funds received from the late
San Francisco attorney and his
daughter, Alice Van Clief Her
rin, who died in 1963. The re
mainder was contributed by the
National Science Foundation.
Herrin, longtime vice presi
dent and chief counsel for the
Southern Pacific Railroad, was
a friend of Senator Leland
Stanford and thus an early sup
porter of the University. He
also admired naturalist John
Muir, and was much interested
in what were then called "the
natural sciences."
The buildings named for him
contain 141,700 square feet of

space, largely devoted to labora
tories and offices. The entire
third floor of Herrin Hall, the
"teaching wing," is occupied by
the library, while there are six
gi*eenhouses on its rooftop.
Faculty and graduate research
is carried on in the adjacent
Herrin Laboratories building,
the "research wing."
Memorial facilities in the
buildings are the Frederick M.
Falconer Biology Library, the
David Starr Jordan Conference
Room, the Victor C. Twitty Con
ference Room, and the John
Raymond Barth Graduate Stu
dent Lounge.
Designed by San Francisco
architect Milton Pflueger, the
new buildings are constructed
on a "modular" principle which
allows for flexibility in the ar
rangement of partitions. M&K
Corporation of San Francisco
was the contractor. Landscap
ing is under the direction of
Thomas D. Church.

Faculty and graduate research
is carried on in the adjacent
Herrin Laboratories building,
the "research wing."
Memorial facilities in the
buildings are the Frederick M.
Falconer Biology Library, the
David Starr Jordan Conference
Room, the Victor C. Twitty Con
ference Room, and the John
Raymond Barth Graduate Stu
dent Lounge.
Designed by San Francisco
architect Milton Pflueger, the
new buildings are constructed
on a "modular" principle which
allows for flexibility in the ar
rangement of partitions. M&K
Corporation of San Francisco
was the contractor. Landscap
ing is under the direction of
Thomas D. Church.
A biologist whose Stanford
research in the early 1940's won
a Nobel Prize will return to the
University this week to dedicate
the new $5 million home of his
former department.
Dr. George W. Beadle, now
president of the University of
Chicago, will be the principal
speaker tomorrow afternoon at
dedication ceremonies for the
recently completed William F.
Herrin Hall and Laboratories.
The impressive new buildings,
just across Serra Street and
northwest of Quad, were occu
pied this fall by the Biological
Sciences Department.
Stanford President Wallace
Sterling and W. Parmer Fuller
111, president of the Board of
Trustees, also will speak at the
dedication ceremonies to be held
in the nearby Physics Lecture
Hall at 3:30 p.m. Professor Don

aid Kennedy, head of the Bio
logical Sciences Department,
will introduce the speakers.
Preceding the dedication, Her
rin Hall and Laboratories will
hold open house beginning at
2 p.m. A reception for invited
guests will be held later at 4:30
p.m. in the Falconer Biology
Library on the third floor of
Herrin Hall.
In the basement "catacombs"
of the department's old home,
Jordan Hall, Dr. Beadle teamed
with Dr. Edward L. Tatum in
research on bread molds. To
gether they discovered how to
produce mutations almost at
will, and their work opened up
a new field of biology-biochemi
cal genetics.

The two men shared the 1958
Nobel Prize for Medicine and
Physiology with Dr. Joshua
Lederberg, who now heads the
Genetics Department at Stan
ford's School of Medicine.
More than $3 million of the
buildings' cost came from the
William F. Herrin Foundation,
established at Stanford with
funds received from the late
San Francisco attorney and his
daughter, Alice Van Clief Her
rin, who died in 1963. The re
mainder was contributed by the
National Science Foundation.
Herrin, longtime vice presi
dent and chief counsel for the
Southern Pacific Railroad, was
a friend of Senator Leland
Stanford and thus an early sup
porter of the University. He
also admired naturalist John
Muir, and was much interested
in what were then called "the
natural sciences."
The buildings named for him
contain 141,700 square feet of

space, largely devoted to labora
tories and offices. The entire
third floor of Herrin Hall, the
"teaching wing," is occupied by
the library, while there are six
gi*eenhouses on its rooftop.
