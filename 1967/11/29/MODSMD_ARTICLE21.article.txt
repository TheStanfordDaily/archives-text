# Chain Letter Worth $320 In Circulation
## 
### 
A chain letter promising to
net the person who buys it $320
has been circulating the campus
recently.
The letter has been passed
around to avoid the Federal
postal regulations forbidding
chain letters. The letter is
"bought" from the previous
"link" in the chain for ten dol
lars made out to the person
whose name is at the top of the
list of recipients, which is at the
bottom of the letter.
The buyer then mails the five
dollar check to the person at the
top of the list. He then removes
the top name from the list,
placing his own name at the
bottom of the list. The buyer
then makes out two checks of
his own for five dollars to the
new name at the top of the list.
The checks are attached to
two new copies of the letter
which are then sold for ten dol
lars each. The chain then con
tinues. The original buyer, if
he sells both his copies of the
letter, has broken even and
stands to make money if the
chain continues to the point
where his name is at the top
of the list. At that point his
name will appear on 64 letters,
and he will receive 64 five-dol
lar checks.
