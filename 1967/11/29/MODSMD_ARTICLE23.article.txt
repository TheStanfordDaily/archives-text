# Social Division Poll
## Students Favor Folk Rock 
### STEVE TOLLEFSON 
Folk-rock is the Stanford stu
dent's number one music prefer
ence. The Jefferson Airplane is
their favorite group with Peter,
Paul, and Mary following close
behind. Bill Cosby heads the list
of comedians and Jonathan Win
ters ranks second.
These are a few of the results
of a poll recently taken by the
Tresidder Social Division to dis
cover the cultural preferences
of Stanford students.
It is the job of the Social Divi
sion to bring "Big Name" enter
tainment to the campus. In the
past, they have sponsored such
people as Doc Watson, Big Ma
ma Thornton, and John Fahey,
and such groups as The Lovin'
Spoonful and The Jefferson Air
plane.
Try To Meet Trends
The purpose of the poll was
to learn of new trends in cultural
preferences and then to arrange
entertainment to meet these
trends.

The poll was distributed to
dorms with emphasis on the
men's dorms because "they buy
the tickets." Over 400 poll sheets
were returned and the Division
has based their choices on these.
The poll contained such ques
tions as "What is your music
preference- (pop, rock, classical,
jazz, etc.) Who is your favorite
group or band? Who is your
favorite comedian? Would you
rather hear a poetry or prose
reading?"
The Social Division provides a
form of subsidized entertain
ment. It operates on a budget
of $2,500 from Tresidder Union.
This money must be used to
cover all the expenses of bring
ing entertainment to campus —
from publicity to setting up faci
lities. They often fail to stay
within their budget. "We are not
trying to make a big profit. On
some things even if we'd sold
out, we'd have lost money." Tick
ets aren't priced to cover costs,
but to make them available to
the greatest number of students.
Problem Is Money
Money is only one of the Divi
sion's problems. It also lacks
proper facilities. The only place
large enough to make bringing
such groups as The Association
or The Beatles to campus is
Frost Amphitheatre—and weath
er prohibits its use for much of
the year. "Stanford lacks a good
pavilion similar to those of many
colleges. Our pavilion is far too
small and the acoustics are ter
rible," said John Kaufman, head
of the Social Division.
The only other places avail
able are Memorial Auditorium,
Dinkelspiel, and the Tresidder
large lounge. Mem Aud is too ex
pensive to operate and still not
big enough, so most of the en
tertainment ends up in Dink or
the Large Lounge. For this rea
son, the entertainment sponsored

this quarter (Big Mama Thorn
ton, Doc Watson) has been of
a variety that lends itself to a
casual atmosphere, especially
that of the large lounge.
What are the prospects for
next quarter? The Mother Earth
will be here on January 12th. It

will be a dance, but a place to
hold it hasn't been found yet.
Also coming will be Denny Zeit
lin, a jazz pianist from the Bay
Area. Social Chairman Kaufman
says that there are some exciting
things "in the works" but doesn't
want to say just what they are.
