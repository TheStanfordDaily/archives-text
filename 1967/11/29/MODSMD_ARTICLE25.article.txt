DYING BREED? â€” New models of Alfa Romeos and other foreign makes will be banned from Cali
fornia roads after Dec. 1 because they failed to meet smog control regulations. Phil Fitzpatrick (fore
ground), a business graduate student, tinkers with his 1966 Alfa Romeo GTC with the help of busi
ness student Ray Smith. Fitzpatrick's car won't be banned, but 1968 models of Aston Martins, Fer
raris, Fiats, (except model 850), Glas, L&mborhinis, Lancias, Maseratis, NSUs, Shelbys, Sunbeams,
and Alfa Romeos will be.
