# California Democrat Endorses McCarthy For U.S. President
## 
### 
Representative Don Edwards
(D-Cal.) has endorsed Senator
Eugene J. McCarthy of Minne
sota for the Democratic Presi
dential nomination.
Edwards, a former national

chairman of the Americans for
Democratic Action, feels "Sena
tor McCarthy will reorder our
country's priorities."
In a statement Monday Ed
wards said President Johnson is
"no longer the one to bring about
an early and honorable peace."
In endorsing McCarthy Edwards
said the senior senator from Min
nesota "can provide the fresh
leadership that is needed in the
battle against the multiple prob
lems we face at home and
abroad."
The San Jose Congressman
called his endorsement "difficult
to make because of President
Johnson's contributions to the
most important domestic legisla
tion since the New Deal."
He added, "The legislation that
he (Johnson) has championed
and the visions of the Great So
ciety he has inspired gave us all
great hope that the most intract
able of all our domestic ills could
be dealt with. But that great
hope is dying in the muddy fields
of Vietnam."

Edwards asserted that "the
primary elections of 1968 present
a unique opportunity for the
people of our nation, and par
ticularly California, to vote on
the Vietnam war and the foreign
policy that is responsible for it."
"Our founders were particu
larly concerned about the peril
of a President making war with
out authorization by the people.
The Congress was given the sole
power to declare war. In the
Vietnam war, the executive has
ignored this constitutional pro
vision.
"I do not doubt the sincerity
of the President's desire for
peace. I believe that he hates
war as much as I do. But I feel
that through miscalculation and
bad advice he has escalated the
conflict to the point where he
can no longer be the one to bring
about an early and honor
able peace. Certainly, American
bombs are not the answer to the
poverty, the ignorance and the
despair of the Vietnamese peo
ple."
