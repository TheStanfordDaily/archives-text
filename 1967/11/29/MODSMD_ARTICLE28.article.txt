# Student Hams Get New Spot
## 
### HANK LIESE 
A lone trailer in a vacant field
near the electronics laboratories
spans six continents and has
communicated with 150 or more
foreign countries.
The trailer is the new station
for Stanford's Amateur Radio
Club, W6YX, an organization
which has been in existence for
almost 35 years.
Due to University expansion
for private and faculty housing,
W6YX recently abandoned its
former station, now the nuclear
engineering laboratory.
In addition to the new station
facilities, the Radio Club has a
room in the Burbank basement
of Stern Hall which houses a
workbench, test equipment, and
a library of American Radio Re
lay League publications.
The room also holds a receiver
for short wave listening and
Morse code practice.

Internationally
Student hams have been using
the trailer's equipment for con
versations with friends and rela

tives throughout the United
States and hams in foreign coun
tries.
Through what is known as
phone-patch work, W6YX can
establish direct telephone com
munication between a person at
Stanford and a friend virtually
anywhere in the world.
Most of the station's equip
ment has been donated by the
radio science laboratory for an
indefinite period of time. The
trailer holds a complete Collins
S-line, which is composed of a
transmitter, receiver, and a two
kilowatt linear amplifier with di
pole antennae on wave lengths
of 80 and 40 meters.
A 3-element beam antenna
which handles wavelengths of 20,
15, and 10 meters is located atop
the trailor.
Club president Jim Barnum, a
third year graduate student and
doctoral candidate in electrical
engineering, hopes the trailor
will be W6YX's permanent loca
tion for several years.
Oscar G. Villard, professor in
electrical engineering and head
of the radio science lab, is a
trustee or faculty advisor to the
Radio Club. Prof. Villard has
been connected with W6YZ since
arriving at Stanford in 1938.

Most of the station's equip
ment has been donated by the
radio science laboratory for an
indefinite period of time. The
trailer holds a complete Collins
S-line, which is composed of a
transmitter, receiver, and a two
kilowatt linear amplifier with di
pole antennae on wave lengths
of 80 and 40 meters.
A 3-element beam antenna
which handles wavelengths of 20,
15, and 10 meters is located atop
the trailor.
Club president Jim Barnum, a
third year graduate student and
doctoral candidate in electrical
engineering, hopes the trailor
will be W6YX's permanent loca
tion for several years.
Oscar G. Villard, professor in
electrical engineering and head
of the radio science lab, is a
trustee or faculty advisor to the
Radio Club. Prof. Villard has
been connected with W6YZ since
arriving at Stanford in 1938.
