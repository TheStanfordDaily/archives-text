# 'Cavern' Opens
## 
### 
The Stanford Repertory The
ater's production of Jean Anou
ilh's "The Cavern" opens to
night in the Little Theater.
An opening night bash will fol
low the performance, as the eat
ing clubs play host to both per
formers and theater goers. A
post-performance reception will
be held in the Toyon lounge im
mediately following the show.
The play, a tale of class and
emotional conflict in the turn-of
the-century French society, has
been called "his most audacious
experiment" by Sirim Devrim,
SRT artist-in-residence and di
rector of the Stanford produc
tion.
The detective drama centering
around an unsolved murder be

gins with the author's apology
that the play is incomplete. The
characters quickly dominate the
scene and "finish" the play for
him.
The principles in the cast in
clude visiting actress Anne Ger
ety as the Countess, and SRT
artists William Sharp, Glenn
Cannon, Paul E. Richards, and
Stephen D. Newman.
Miss Gerety has worked with
the Seattle Reperatory Theater

Cavern" run, she will join her
husband in Portland as his newly
formed American Theater Com
pany begins preparing for its
