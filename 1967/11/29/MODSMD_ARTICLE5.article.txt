# Fraternity Council Considers Resolution On Local Autonomy
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Stanford fraternities may
soon come into direct conflict
with their nationals because of
a resolution being considered
by the Inter-fraternity Council
(IFC), proposing local auto
nomy for chapters in the selec
tion of their members.
Phi Kappa Psi has already en
countered problems with its na
tional office on the issues of
local autonomy and member
ship selection.
The resolution, which is the
same as one passed in Septem
ber by the IFC at Cal, was pre
sented to the fraternities at an
IFC meeting last week.
But, according to IFC Presi
dent Mike Quinn, the group felt
the proposal was so important
that it should be referred back
to the individual houses for con
sideration.
It will be voted on at the next
IFC meeting, in January. In the
meantime, the resolution is be

ing reviewed by each fraternity.
The proposal states, "We sup
port the autonomy of the local
body in selection of member
ship."
The statement also declares,
"We are opposed to discrimina
tion on the basis of race, reli
gion, or socio-economic status in
consideration of an individual
for membership."
Another section states the or
ganization is "opposed to alumni
recommendations or acceptance
as a requisite for membership."
According to the resolution,
these three policies, lack of
autonomy, discrimination, and
alumni interference, prevent fra
ternities from fulfilling the "con
cept of fraternalism."
Concept Of Fraternity
This concept is stated as "A
fraternity is founded upon the
ideal of brotherhood governed
according to the structure of the
society of which it is an integ
ral part, and exists to provide

a democratic communal living
experience for its members."
Quinn said the resolutions
will be introduced at the Na
tional Interfraternity Confer
ence (NIC) by Dan Rosenthal
of the Dean of Students office
at Berkeley. The conference will
be held Thursday through Sat
urday in New York. Assistant
Dean of Students Dan Williams
and Quinn will be on the delega
tion representing Stanford.
Rosenthal asked Quinn to
support the proposal when it is
brought up at the New York
meeting. To do this before the
IFC has approved the measure,
Quinn has been discussing the

idea with the presidents of most
of the fraternities this week to
see if opinion at Stanford is for
the resolution.
Quinn feels the proposal "will
be criticized pretty strongly at
the NIC."
Discriminatory Clauses
Since several fraternities have
c'auses in their charters which
are discriminatory and prevent
local autonomy, Quinn feels
such a resolution could cause
repercussions if passed by the
IFC.
Not all fraternities would
have this problem however, he
said, citing his group, Delta
Upsilon, as one which had a

liberal national office.
The resolution at Berkeley
was originally passed by both
the IFC and the Pan-Hellenic
Council (representing the sor
orities). The sorority group
later withdrew its support after
many of its member organiza
tions were pressured to do so
by their alumnae, according to
Quinn.
The stated theme of the NIC
is "How to make the most of
the opportunities facing fratern
ities on the modern college cam
pus today." The keynote speak
er at the meeting will be Sena
tor Howard H. Baker, Jr. (D.-
Tenn.).
