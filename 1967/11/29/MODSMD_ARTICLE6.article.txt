## Dean Lauds Students 
### DAN SNELL (Second of a Series) 
Bayless Manning, Dean of the
School of Law, lauds the stu
dents in his school, calling them
"a superlative student body and
getting better all the time."
Thomas Robinson, law school
assistant dean, echoes Mann
ing's praise for the students.
Robinson, in charge of admis
sion's for the school, says that
there has been a continuous in
crease in the quantity and qual
ity of the students who apply
for admission.
In the past three years there
has been an increase of three
hundred students applying for
the 155 places in the school's
first-year class. This last year
there were approximately 1530
students from throughout the
nation who applied to Stanford's
school, according to Robinson. >
Applicants must take the Law
School Admissions Test (LSAT)
to qualify for consideration.
Robinson said that LSAT scores
of applicants have been grad
ually improving over the years.
Those admitted to the school
this year scored in the ninty
seventh percentile on the LSAT,
according to the assistant dean.
GPA Improvement
"There has also been a less
dramatic improvement in the
undergraduate grade-point av
erage of applicants," he said.

Robinson stressed that the
only criterion for selection was
potential performance in the
law school as judged in aca
demics.
"We try to judge applicants
on faculty recommendations
from their undergraduate
schools, the courses they took,
and the grades they got on
them, along with the LSAT,"
Robinson said.
Outweighs Exam
"But we give more consider
ation to the undergraduate aca
demic record than to the exam
ination," he said. "After all, the
record they made in college
measures four years of achieve
ment, and the LSAT just mea
sures what they can do in four
hours."
The Admissions Committee of
the school pays little attention
to extracurricular activities un
less the applicant has done
something particularly outstand
ing, according to Robinson.
"We don't have any geograph
ical rating system," Robinson
said, "nor do we give any ad
vantages to sons of alumni or to
men over women."
"We want people who will do
well in the courses in law

school," Robinson said. "We've
got no objective way to judge
anything like possible future
statesmanship."
Stanford, unlike some of the
other major law schools in the
nation, does not count personal
interviews with the applicants
in making admissions decisions.
Robinson said evaluation of
an interviewee is "too subjec
tive." It depends too much, he
said, "on what kind of a lunch
I just had."
Range Of Colleges
The law school has students
from 108 different undergrad
uate schools. One hundred
twenty-one of the 444 students
went to Stanford as undergrad
uates.
But Robinson reiterated that
there is no discrimination for or
against undergraduates from
Stanford in the admissions pro
cess.
In the past, in fact, a slightly
lower percentage of those ap
plying from Stanford have been
accepted into the school than of
those from other undergraduate
institutions, according to Rob
inson.

CHRISTIAN HUMANIST — Because "the two artificially protected
parties have no real ideology," Philippine ex-Senator Raul S. Mangla
pus last year formed the Party for Philippine Progress. This year
he and his colleagues have gone further, hoping to draw many
Filipinos into a movement based on a "plan of Christian Humanism/'
asking "Can the spirit of Love guide men and nations?"
Manglapus spoke in the Tresidder Large Lounge yesterday after
noon. A Wilbur guest in residence, he is eating meals in Wilbur and
Stern demonstration houses. He will lead a discussion at the I-Cen
ter at 4 p.m. Thursday afternoon.
According to Manglapus, the people of underdeveloped countries
of Asia are in search of a relevant ideology, and "all the United
States has to offer them is pragmatism." He maintained that the
"monotonous spontaneity" which has dominated American history
is not applicable to Asian lands which have no frontiers, no tradi
tion of dissent, and in most places poor land.
