# San Jose Faculty, Students To Vote On Recruiting Policy
## 
### 
San Jose State students and
faculty will vote on whether the
college should permit business
firms and the military to re
cruit on campus.
The academic council passed
a resolution Monday night, say
ing that it "wholeheartedly"
supports President Robert D.
Clark's "policy of maintaining
an open campus available to the
nonviolent expression and dis
cussion of all id and all
shades of opinion on any issue."
Last week's demonstration
against Dow Chemical Co. re
cruiters prompted the meeting
of the council to recommend a
recruiting policy. Nineteen per
sons have been arrested to date.
Demonstrators have demanded
that the military and military

oriented business firms be pro
hibited from recruiting on cam
pus.
While the academic council
was meeting, the Army an
nounced that it will not recruit
on the campus Wednesday and
Thursday, as planned.
E. W. Clements, director of
placements, said today the
Army changed its plans because
there was no need for them to
recruit, not because of the dem
onstrations.
"They (Army recruiters) had
received word from higher au
thorities that their needs in
their officer candidate program
are so limited that they would
n't justify recruiting," Clements
said.
In conflict with the academic
council, the campus chapter of

the American Federation of
Teachers (AFT) Local 1362
urged prohibition of campus
military recruiting.
The AFT is spokesman for
about 200 faculty members. The
resolution adopted by the aca
demic council was submitted
jointly by the School of Natural
Sciences and Mathematics and
the School of Humanities. The
two departments consist of 651
faculty members â€”about half of
the school's 1,300 instructors.
The vote will be held after
both the academic council and
the student council approve a
policy to be submitted to the
whole campus.
Clark has appointed a faculty
student committee to draw up
a recommended policy to be sub
mitted to the two councils.
