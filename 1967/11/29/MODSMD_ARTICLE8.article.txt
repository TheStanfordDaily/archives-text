# Mitterand To Explore French World Role
## 
### RENTON ROLPH 
"A country cannot permit it
self the luxury of a President
who considers himself above the
law." But according to Francois
Maurice Mitterand, the leader
of the Federation of the Left in
France and the author of the

foregoing sentence, France is
today enjoying that question
able luxury in the person of
President Charles de Gaulle.
Francois Mitterand has deter
mined to depose De Gaulle and to
destroy le pouvoir personnel by
which the General has governed

* ranee since 1958. And political
forces within France have of
late been regrouping with more
effective alliances on the left so
that Francois Mitterand has
very possibly become General
de Gaulle's chief political head
ache.
A few days less than two
years ago on Dec. 5, 1965, Mit
terand made clear and good his
threat to De Gaulle, by forcing
the President into a run-off elec
tion. In the run-off campaign
De Gaulle for the first time had
to shed his aloofness and come
directly to the people for their
electoral support. Though De
Gaulle won the election with 13
million votes, an 11 million tally
for Mitterand points to an ac
tive opposition, fast growing in
the Fifth Republic.
In the wake of, for him, ever
more disturbing statements, pol
icies and actions by the Presi
dent, Mitterand has grown po
litically stronger as well as
more strongly confirmed in his

hope for a "united left," devel
oping out of his Federation. A
poll taken by the French Insti
tute of Public Opinion demon
strated that if Mitterand were
running against Prime Minister
George Pompidou, he would get
41 per cent of the votes against
34 per cent for Pompidou. Fig-

ures were almost identical for
the Mitterand • G is c a r d race.
(Valery Giscard heads the Inde
pendent Republican Party which
is, according to the Washington
Post, "sort of an internal oppo
sition within the government
majority." Others have called it
a conservative ally of the Gaul
lists.)
One Of Eight Sons
Early in his life which began
in 1916 Francois Mitterand, one

of eight sons of a railroad work
er, decided that he wanted to
make it "to the top" and that
the best route was politics. His
ambition has never left him
since that time when he was 19.
Starting as a hospital orderly
tending to the physical of
the aged, Mitterand failed to
learn humility. But. he was still
restless with himself. And to
good end. He became a journal
ist and later a lawyer.
In North Africa in 1944 he
met Charles de Gaulle whom he
found "brusque, cold and au
thoritarian." De Gaulle, though,
appointed Mitterand to be Sec
retary of Prisoners of War
later that year. Mitterand served
as cabinet minister in a variety
of departments for the next 20
years, but never landed the
hoped-for Premiership.
In 1965 as one candidate in a
field of five challenging De
Gaulle for the Presidency, Mit
terand became the runner-up.
This showing, surprising for

candidates as well as political
watchers in France, presented
Mitterand as the obvious leader
of the French left.
Movement Bas<»d on Thought
More surprising is that the
liberal movement behind Mit
terand is based on thought
rather than political mania.
Mitterand's best campaigner is
his mind. But he has too much
of Coriolanus in his personality
to be a truly successful cam
paigner in the terms that Amer
icans visualize the effective can
didate: the backslapper, the
babykisser, and the joker.
Mitterand is none of these,
and he is seldom theatrical. He
is a hard-hitting and sincere
candidate who, says Le Monde,
"knows how to bite and insult."
His audiences are never carried
away with love, but most often
with admiration and respect.
Mitterand desperately tries to
avoid hand-to-hand politicking in
crowds. At one labor meeting in
Lyons, "when the crowd tried to

carry him off in triumph, he
could barely respond with a
smile. It was as though Mitter
and were disgusted by physical
contact with the masses. He
fled into his black Citroen with
barely a valedictory wave." Mit
terand does not show his "scars
to the multitude."
Out For Victory
In many ways like Shake
speare's Roman general, Mitter
and's political mission is to de
feat France's most famous liv
ing general, even before the
years do it for him. So often do
Mitterand's speeches devolve
into open diatribes against the
person De Gaulle, that one won
ders whether Mitterand is con
fusing personality and politics.
But Mitterand realizes this ten
dency.
Perhaps his personal philip
pics are justified by the extreme
frustration he feels battling a
seemingly omnipotent govern
ment hnth nrnnnllr»ri and svm-
bolized by a single man's per
sonality. This degree of frustra
tion may, at this time, be diffi
cult for Americans to under
stand.
Mitterand is out to do nothing
less than save France from her
self. He says, "France today is
no longer a democracy in the
sense that the term is under
stood in the U.S. and Britain.
The Gaullist regime is run by a
single man who has made it his
own private property . . . and
allows the opposition virtually
no opportunity to voice its opin
ion . . . Radio and TV are the
sole means of reaching millions
of citizens and they are entirely

under government control."
This statement appeared in an
article in the New York Times
which Mitterand himself wrote
in 1966 charging the govern
ment and De Gaulle with
thwarting his presidential cam
paign by cancelling some of his
broadcasts. Mitterand also cited
many cases of delays and can
cellations of his plane flights
that hindered his vote-getting ef
fort. The airlines in France are
owned and operated by the gov
ernment.
Mitterand declared last sum
mer that the construction of a
strong Europe was France's
only valid prospect for effective
and honest independence. "It is
paradoxical that General de
Gaulle is opposed to British en
try into the Common Market on
the pretext that the market
must be strong and cohesive,
while he is at work to deprive
the community of that same un
ity and authority."
Mitterand's growing political
strength, to be sure, stems
largely from the 1965 decision
of the French Communist Party
to support him. There has been
a corresponding reaction on the
other wing of Mitterand's
forces.
The Communists today com

prise France's second largest
party after the Gaullists. The
modern French Communist
bears little resemblance to the
revolutionary and doctrinaire
Russian prototype of earlier in
this century. The members of
the French CP are too settled
and too prosperous to worry
about revolution which would
lose them their cars, their
houses, and their jobs. The
French Communist is a new
breed, fixed and yet independent,
as far from Lenin, ironically, as
Mitterand is from De Gaulle.
Keith Bosford pointed out in
the New York Times Magazine
that "French Communists
should not be confused with
some of the international public
relations men of Communism
like Jean-Paul Sartre."
Wherever on the cursus hon
omm he is bound, Mitterand
should be listened to as the
prophet of the united left in
France who scorns la petite
gauche—the little left—or the
"knick-knacks" who are con
cerned more with being heard
than with winning. Mitterand's
political vision, perhaps vital to
the survival of French democ
racy, is no less irrelevant to po
litical forces in the United
States.

that "French Communists
should not be confused with
some of the international public
relations men of Communism
like Jean-Paul Sartre."
Wherever on the cursus hon
omm he is bound, Mitterand
should be listened to as the
prophet of the united left in
France who scorns la petite
gauche—the little left—or the
"knick-knacks" who are con

than with winning. Mitterand's
political vision, perhaps vital to
the survival of French democ

"A country cannot permit it
self the luxury of a President
who considers himself above the
law." But according to Francois
Maurice Mitterand, the leader
of the Federation of the Left in
France and the author of the

foregoing sentence, France is
today enjoying that question
able luxury in the person of
President Charles de Gaulle.
Francois Mitterand has deter
mined to depose De Gaulle and to
destroy le pouvoir personnel by
which the General has governed

* ranee since 1958. And political
forces within France have of
late been regrouping with more
effective alliances on the left so
that Francois Mitterand has
very possibly become General
de Gaulle's chief political head
ache.
A few days less than two
years ago on Dec. 5, 1965, Mit
terand made clear and good his
threat to De Gaulle, by forcing
the President into a run-off elec
tion. In the run-off campaign
De Gaulle for the first time had
to shed his aloofness and come
directly to the people for their
electoral support. Though De
Gaulle won the election with 13
million votes, an 11 million tally
for Mitterand points to an ac
tive opposition, fast growing in
the Fifth Republic.
In the wake of, for him, ever
more disturbing statements, pol
icies and actions by the Presi
dent, Mitterand has grown po
litically stronger as well as
more strongly confirmed in his

hope for a "united left," devel
oping out of his Federation. A
poll taken by the French Insti
tute of Public Opinion demon
strated that if Mitterand were
running against Prime Minister
George Pompidou, he would get
41 per cent of the votes against
34 per cent for Pompidou. Fig-

One Of Eight Sons
Early in his life which began
in 1916 Francois Mitterand, one

of eight sons of a railroad work
er, decided that he wanted to
make it "to the top" and that
the best route was politics. His
ambition has never left him
since that time when he was 19.
Starting as a hospital orderly
tending to the physical of
the aged, Mitterand failed to
learn humility. But. he was still
restless with himself. And to
good end. He became a journal
ist and later a lawyer.
In North Africa in 1944 he
met Charles de Gaulle whom he
found "brusque, cold and au
thoritarian." De Gaulle, though,
appointed Mitterand to be Sec
retary of Prisoners of War
later that year. Mitterand served
as cabinet minister in a variety
of departments for the next 20
years, but never landed the
hoped-for Premiership.
In 1965 as one candidate in a
field of five challenging De
Gaulle for the Presidency, Mit
terand became the runner-up.
This showing, surprising for

candidates as well as political
watchers in France, presented
Mitterand as the obvious leader
of the French left.
Movement Bas<»d on Thought
More surprising is that the
liberal movement behind Mit
terand is based on thought
rather than political mania.
Mitterand's best campaigner is
his mind. But he has too much
of Coriolanus in his personality
to be a truly successful cam
paigner in the terms that Amer
icans visualize the effective can
didate: the backslapper, the
babykisser, and the joker.
Mitterand is none of these,
and he is seldom theatrical. He
is a hard-hitting and sincere
candidate who, says Le Monde,
"knows how to bite and insult."
His audiences are never carried
away with love, but most often
with admiration and respect.
Mitterand desperately tries to
avoid hand-to-hand politicking in
crowds. At one labor meeting in
Lyons, "when the crowd tried to

carry him off in triumph, he
could barely respond with a
smile. It was as though Mitter
and were disgusted by physical
contact with the masses. He
fled into his black Citroen with
barely a valedictory wave." Mit
terand does not show his "scars
to the multitude."
Out For Victory
In many ways like Shake
speare's Roman general, Mitter
and's political mission is to de
feat France's most famous liv
ing general, even before the
years do it for him. So often do
Mitterand's speeches devolve
into open diatribes against the
person De Gaulle, that one won
ders whether Mitterand is con
fusing personality and politics.
But Mitterand realizes this ten
dency.
Perhaps his personal philip
pics are justified by the extreme
frustration he feels battling a
seemingly omnipotent govern
ment hnth nrnnnllr»ri and svm-
bolized by a single man's per
sonality. This degree of frustra
tion may, at this time, be diffi
cult for Americans to under
stand.
Mitterand is out to do nothing
less than save France from her
self. He says, "France today is
no longer a democracy in the
sense that the term is under
stood in the U.S. and Britain.
The Gaullist regime is run by a
single man who has made it his
own private property . . . and
allows the opposition virtually
no opportunity to voice its opin
ion . . . Radio and TV are the
sole means of reaching millions
of citizens and they are entirely

under government control."
This statement appeared in an
article in the New York Times
which Mitterand himself wrote
in 1966 charging the govern
ment and De Gaulle with
thwarting his presidential cam
paign by cancelling some of his
broadcasts. Mitterand also cited
many cases of delays and can
cellations of his plane flights
that hindered his vote-getting ef
fort. The airlines in France are
owned and operated by the gov
ernment.
Mitterand declared last sum
mer that the construction of a
strong Europe was France's
only valid prospect for effective
and honest independence. "It is
paradoxical that General de
Gaulle is opposed to British en
try into the Common Market on
the pretext that the market
must be strong and cohesive,
while he is at work to deprive
the community of that same un
ity and authority."
Mitterand's growing political
strength, to be sure, stems
largely from the 1965 decision
of the French Communist Party
to support him. There has been
a corresponding reaction on the
other wing of Mitterand's
forces.
The Communists today com

prise France's second largest
party after the Gaullists. The
modern French Communist
bears little resemblance to the
revolutionary and doctrinaire
Russian prototype of earlier in
this century. The members of
the French CP are too settled
and too prosperous to worry
about revolution which would
lose them their cars, their
houses, and their jobs. The
French Communist is a new
breed, fixed and yet independent,
as far from Lenin, ironically, as
Mitterand is from De Gaulle.
Keith Bosford pointed out in
the New York Times Magazine
that "French Communists
should not be confused with
some of the international public

President Charles de Gaulle.
Francois Mitterand has deter

* ranee since 1958. And political
forces within France have of

effective alliances on the left so
that Francois Mitterand has
very possibly become General
de Gaulle's chief political head
ache.
A few days less than two
years ago on Dec. 5, 1965, Mit
terand made clear and good his
threat to De Gaulle, by forcing
the President into a run-off elec
tion. In the run-off campaign
De Gaulle for the first time had
to shed his aloofness and come
directly to the people for their
electoral support. Though De
Gaulle won the election with 13
million votes, an 11 million tally
for Mitterand points to an ac

the Fifth Republic.
In the wake of, for him, ever
more disturbing statements, pol

litically stronger as well as
more strongly confirmed in his

hope for a "united left," devel

One Of Eight Sons
Early in his life which began
in 1916 Francois Mitterand, one

of eight sons of a railroad work
er, decided that he wanted to
make it "to the top" and that
the best route was politics. His
ambition has never left him
since that time when he was 19.
Starting as a hospital orderly
tending to the physical of
the aged, Mitterand failed to
learn humility. But. he was still
restless with himself. And to
good end. He became a journal
ist and later a lawyer.
In North Africa in 1944 he
met Charles de Gaulle whom he
found "brusque, cold and au
thoritarian." De Gaulle, though,
appointed Mitterand to be Sec
retary of Prisoners of War
later that year. Mitterand served
as cabinet minister in a variety
of departments for the next 20
years, but never landed the
hoped-for Premiership.
In 1965 as one candidate in a
field of five challenging De
Gaulle for the Presidency, Mit
terand became the runner-up.
This showing, surprising for

candidates as well as political
watchers in France, presented
Mitterand as the obvious leader
of the French left.
Movement Bas<»d on Thought
More surprising is that the
liberal movement behind Mit
terand is based on thought
rather than political mania.
Mitterand's best campaigner is
his mind. But he has too much
of Coriolanus in his personality
to be a truly successful cam
paigner in the terms that Amer
icans visualize the effective can
didate: the backslapper, the
babykisser, and the joker.
Mitterand is none of these,
and he is seldom theatrical. He
is a hard-hitting and sincere
candidate who, says Le Monde,
"knows how to bite and insult."
His audiences are never carried
away with love, but most often
with admiration and respect.
Mitterand desperately tries to
avoid hand-to-hand politicking in
crowds. At one labor meeting in
Lyons, "when the crowd tried to

carry him off in triumph, he
could barely respond with a
smile. It was as though Mitter
and were disgusted by physical
contact with the masses. He
fled into his black Citroen with
barely a valedictory wave." Mit
terand does not show his "scars
to the multitude."
Out For Victory
In many ways like Shake
speare's Roman general, Mitter
and's political mission is to de
feat France's most famous liv
ing general, even before the
years do it for him. So often do
Mitterand's speeches devolve
into open diatribes against the
person De Gaulle, that one won
ders whether Mitterand is con
fusing personality and politics.
But Mitterand realizes this ten
dency.
Perhaps his personal philip
pics are justified by the extreme
frustration he feels battling a
seemingly omnipotent govern
ment hnth nrnnnllr»ri and svm-
bolized by a single man's per
sonality. This degree of frustra
tion may, at this time, be diffi
cult for Americans to under
stand.
Mitterand is out to do nothing
less than save France from her
self. He says, "France today is
no longer a democracy in the
sense that the term is under
stood in the U.S. and Britain.
The Gaullist regime is run by a
single man who has made it his
own private property . . . and
allows the opposition virtually
no opportunity to voice its opin
ion . . . Radio and TV are the
sole means of reaching millions
of citizens and they are entirely

under government control."
This statement appeared in an
article in the New York Times
which Mitterand himself wrote
in 1966 charging the govern
ment and De Gaulle with
thwarting his presidential cam
paign by cancelling some of his
broadcasts. Mitterand also cited
many cases of delays and can
cellations of his plane flights
that hindered his vote-getting ef
fort. The airlines in France are
owned and operated by the gov
ernment.
Mitterand declared last sum
mer that the construction of a
strong Europe was France's
only valid prospect for effective
and honest independence. "It is
paradoxical that General de
Gaulle is opposed to British en
try into the Common Market on
the pretext that the market
must be strong and cohesive,
while he is at work to deprive
the community of that same un
ity and authority."
Mitterand's growing political
strength, to be sure, stems
largely from the 1965 decision
of the French Communist Party
to support him. There has been
a corresponding reaction on the
other wing of Mitterand's
forces.

mer that the construction of a
strong Europe was France's
only valid prospect for effective
and honest independence. "It is
paradoxical that General de
Gaulle is opposed to British en
try into the Common Market on
the pretext that the market
must be strong and cohesive,
while he is at work to deprive
the community of that same un
ity and authority."
Mitterand's growing political
strength, to be sure, stems
largely from the 1965 decision
of the French Communist Party
to support him. There has been
a corresponding reaction on the
other wing of Mitterand's
forces.
The Communists today com

prise France's second largest
party after the Gaullists. The
modern French Communist
bears little resemblance to the
revolutionary and doctrinaire
Russian prototype of earlier in
this century. The members of
the French CP are too settled
and too prosperous to worry
about revolution which would
lose them their cars, their
houses, and their jobs. The
French Communist is a new
breed, fixed and yet independent,
as far from Lenin, ironically, as
Mitterand is from De Gaulle.
Keith Bosford pointed out in
the New York Times Magazine
that "French Communists
should not be confused with
some of the international public
relations men of Communism
like Jean-Paul Sartre."
Wherever on the cursus hon
omm he is bound, Mitterand
should be listened to as the
prophet of the united left in
France who scorns la petite
gauche—the little left—or the
"knick-knacks" who are con
cerned more with being heard
than with winning. Mitterand's
political vision, perhaps vital to
the survival of French democ
racy, is no less irrelevant to po
litical forces in the United
States.
"A country cannot permit it
self the luxury of a President
who considers himself above the
law." But according to Francois
Maurice Mitterand, the leader
of the Federation of the Left in
France and the author of the

foregoing sentence, France is
today enjoying that question
able luxury in the person of
President Charles de Gaulle.
Francois Mitterand has deter
mined to depose De Gaulle and to
destroy le pouvoir personnel by
which the General has governed

* ranee since 1958. And political
forces within France have of
late been regrouping with more
effective alliances on the left so
that Francois Mitterand has
very possibly become General
de Gaulle's chief political head
ache.
A few days less than two
years ago on Dec. 5, 1965, Mit
terand made clear and good his
threat to De Gaulle, by forcing
the President into a run-off elec
tion. In the run-off campaign
De Gaulle for the first time had
to shed his aloofness and come
directly to the people for their
electoral support. Though De
Gaulle won the election with 13
million votes, an 11 million tally
for Mitterand points to an ac
tive opposition, fast growing in
the Fifth Republic.
In the wake of, for him, ever
more disturbing statements, pol
icies and actions by the Presi
dent, Mitterand has grown po
litically stronger as well as
more strongly confirmed in his

hope for a "united left," devel
oping out of his Federation. A
poll taken by the French Insti

running against Prime Minister
George Pompidou, he would get

One Of Eight Sons
Early in his life which began
in 1916 Francois Mitterand, one

of eight sons of a railroad work
er, decided that he wanted to
make it "to the top" and that
the best route was politics. His
ambition has never left him
since that time when he was 19.
Starting as a hospital orderly
tending to the physical of
the aged, Mitterand failed to
learn humility. But. he was still
restless with himself. And to
good end. He became a journal
ist and later a lawyer.
In North Africa in 1944 he
met Charles de Gaulle whom he
found "brusque, cold and au
thoritarian." De Gaulle, though,
appointed Mitterand to be Sec
retary of Prisoners of War
later that year. Mitterand served
as cabinet minister in a variety
of departments for the next 20
years, but never landed the
hoped-for Premiership.
In 1965 as one candidate in a
field of five challenging De
Gaulle for the Presidency, Mit
terand became the runner-up.
This showing, surprising for

candidates as well as political
watchers in France, presented
Mitterand as the obvious leader
of the French left.
Movement Bas<»d on Thought
More surprising is that the
liberal movement behind Mit
terand is based on thought
rather than political mania.
Mitterand's best campaigner is
his mind. But he has too much
of Coriolanus in his personality
to be a truly successful cam
paigner in the terms that Amer
icans visualize the effective can
didate: the backslapper, the
babykisser, and the joker.
Mitterand is none of these,
and he is seldom theatrical. He
is a hard-hitting and sincere
candidate who, says Le Monde,
"knows how to bite and insult."
His audiences are never carried
away with love, but most often
with admiration and respect.
Mitterand desperately tries to
avoid hand-to-hand politicking in
crowds. At one labor meeting in
Lyons, "when the crowd tried to

carry him off in triumph, he
could barely respond with a
smile. It was as though Mitter
and were disgusted by physical
contact with the masses. He
fled into his black Citroen with
barely a valedictory wave." Mit
terand does not show his "scars
to the multitude."
Out For Victory
In many ways like Shake
speare's Roman general, Mitter
and's political mission is to de
feat France's most famous liv
ing general, even before the
years do it for him. So often do
Mitterand's speeches devolve
into open diatribes against the
person De Gaulle, that one won
ders whether Mitterand is con
fusing personality and politics.
But Mitterand realizes this ten
dency.
Perhaps his personal philip
pics are justified by the extreme
frustration he feels battling a
seemingly omnipotent govern
ment hnth nrnnnllr»ri and svm-
bolized by a single man's per
sonality. This degree of frustra
tion may, at this time, be diffi
cult for Americans to under
stand.
Mitterand is out to do nothing
less than save France from her
self. He says, "France today is
no longer a democracy in the
sense that the term is under
stood in the U.S. and Britain.
The Gaullist regime is run by a
single man who has made it his
own private property . . . and
allows the opposition virtually
no opportunity to voice its opin
ion . . . Radio and TV are the
sole means of reaching millions
of citizens and they are entirely

under government control."
This statement appeared in an
article in the New York Times
which Mitterand himself wrote
in 1966 charging the govern
ment and De Gaulle with
thwarting his presidential cam
paign by cancelling some of his
broadcasts. Mitterand also cited
many cases of delays and can
cellations of his plane flights
that hindered his vote-getting ef
fort. The airlines in France are
owned and operated by the gov
ernment.

ion . . . Radio and TV are the
sole means of reaching millions
of citizens and they are entirely

under government control."
This statement appeared in an
article in the New York Times
which Mitterand himself wrote
in 1966 charging the govern
ment and De Gaulle with
thwarting his presidential cam
paign by cancelling some of his
broadcasts. Mitterand also cited
many cases of delays and can
cellations of his plane flights
that hindered his vote-getting ef
fort. The airlines in France are
owned and operated by the gov
ernment.
Mitterand declared last sum
mer that the construction of a
strong Europe was France's
only valid prospect for effective
and honest independence. "It is
paradoxical that General de
Gaulle is opposed to British en
try into the Common Market on
the pretext that the market
must be strong and cohesive,
while he is at work to deprive
the community of that same un
ity and authority."
Mitterand's growing political
strength, to be sure, stems
largely from the 1965 decision
of the French Communist Party
to support him. There has been
a corresponding reaction on the
other wing of Mitterand's
forces.
The Communists today com

prise France's second largest
party after the Gaullists. The
modern French Communist
bears little resemblance to the
revolutionary and doctrinaire
Russian prototype of earlier in
this century. The members of
the French CP are too settled
and too prosperous to worry
about revolution which would
lose them their cars, their
houses, and their jobs. The
French Communist is a new
breed, fixed and yet independent,
as far from Lenin, ironically, as
Mitterand is from De Gaulle.
Keith Bosford pointed out in
the New York Times Magazine
that "French Communists
should not be confused with
some of the international public
relations men of Communism
like Jean-Paul Sartre."
Wherever on the cursus hon
omm he is bound, Mitterand
should be listened to as the
prophet of the united left in
France who scorns la petite
gauche—the little left—or the
"knick-knacks" who are con
cerned more with being heard
than with winning. Mitterand's
political vision, perhaps vital to
the survival of French democ
racy, is no less irrelevant to po
litical forces in the United
States.
