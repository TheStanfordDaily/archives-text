# Activity Credits Dropped Jan. 5 If Council Agrees
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The Academic Council will be
asked to abolish activity credit
requirements for undergraduates
at its meeting January 5.
Undergraduates, including the
class of 1968, will no longer have
to take six non-credit activity
units to earn a bachelor's degree
if the faculty body approves
recommendations from both the
influential Committee on Gen
eral Studies and the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.
The proposal would end the
requirement of two classes in
physical education during the
freshman or sophomore years.
No Longer Useful
"The Activity Requirement in
the General Studies Program has
outlived its usefulness," accord

ing to a report from the Gen
eral Studies committee, chaired
by Robert A. Walker. The com
mittee voted unanimously Oct.
11 to recommend abolition. •
The activity requirement was
adopted by the Academic Coun
cil in 1956.
A majority vote at the Aca
demic Council's Jan. 5 meeting
will be required to end the ac
tivity credit system. The 900-
member body, which includes all
faculty with a rank of at least
assistant professor, meets once
each quarter.
Approval Expected
Explicit recommendations such
as this from the Executive Com
mittee, chaired by Economics
Prof. Kenneth J. Arrow, are
usually approved by the Coun
cil. The activity credit recom

mendation is strengthened furth
er by the support of the General
Studies committee, which has de
bated the future of activity cre
dits for more than a year and
a half.
Past attempts to abolish ac
tivity requirements have been
opposed by the music and wom
en's physical education depart
ments, which feared a shortage
of students if participation in
group activities was not re
quired.
The Academic Council, besides
voting outright approval or re
jection of the Executive Commit
tee's recommendation, could send
the motion back for further
study. It could also request that
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) consider activity re
quirements first.
Vigorous Opposition
Herbert L. Packer, vice pro
vost and chairman of the SES
steering committee, said he
would "oppose vigorously" a de
lay just to allow SES to study
the requirement.
Packer is also a member of
the General Studies committee.
When the committee made its
recommendation to abolish the
requirement, "objections were
considered and found wanting,"
he explained.
Luell W. Guthrie, executive
head of the women's physical
education department, said yes
terday she expected some de
cline in freshmen's enrollment
in physical education courses if
the activity requirement lapses.
She was confident, however, that
all women would learn "by word
of mouth" that such courses
were worth taking before they
left Stanford.

"lt may eliminate a few peo
ple who would not sample what
the University has to offer," she
said. "I don't anticipate a great
change."
In its present form the activity
requirement states that all un
dergraduates under 24 except
veterans and married students
must "participate in organized
activities to a total value of six
non-credit units."
No more than two units can
be earned in one quarter.
Besides physical education
courses, activities such as band,
orchestra, student government,
publications, sailing club, tutor
ing, axe commission and ROTC
give students one activity credit
per quarter.
More than 50 campus organi

zations, in fact, have been ap
proved by the General Studies
committee as acceptable for ac
tivity credit.
In a memorandum the com
mittee gave these reasons for the
decision:
• Qualifications of entering
students have improved so that
"now, virtually all entering
freshmen have distinguished
themselves in both academic and
extra-curricular pursuits in their
respective high schools."
• The requirement "often be
comes an obstacle to many of
our more talented students, who
are very busy with more im
portant concerns."
Bed-Tape Cutter
• "An enormovs amount of
record-keeping" will be eliminat-
Ed along with the requirement.
"The Committee doubts that the
number of man-hours involved
is justified by the actual value
of the requirement to the stu
dents."
• Fulfillment of the activity
requirement can't be closely sup
ervised, thus making it "practi
cally impossible to insure an
equitable distribution of activity
credits . . . doubtless many per
sons are granted activity credit
for doing very little." Since some
activity credits are hard to
earn, "there is danger of injus
tices occurring."
A formal motion to do away
with the activity requirement
was first introduced to the Gen
eral Studies committee on Feb
ruary 16, 1966 by Robert J. Wert,
then Stanford's dean of under
graduate education and now
president of Mills College.
Gradual Phase-Out
A month later the committee
adopted a resolution asking for
gradual dismantling of the acti
vity requirement, eliminating
two units per year, starting with
the class entering in fall of 1966.
Opposition came immediately
from the music department and
women's physical education de
partments, and the Executive
Committee tabled the proposal.
Debate within the General Stu
dies committee continued into
1967. In February the committee
withdrew its original recommen
dation for a phased end to the
requirement. This hesitation re
sulted from two considerations:
(1) continued protests from cer
tain departments, and (2) the
suggestion that the newly or
ganized Study of Education at
Stanford should deal with the
matter.

Besides, the Executive Com
mittee had never acted on the
original motion to abolish the
activity requirement.
However, by this fall members
of the General Studies committee
felt action on the activity re
quirement should be delayed no
longer. Members of the General
Studies office, in fact, told fresh
man sponsors in pre-registration
briefings that the requirement
would almost certainly lapse be
fore the entering class gradu
ated.
On Oct. 11 the committee ap
proved a memorandum from
Peter Dahl, assistant to Walker,
which asked immediate aboli
tion of the requirement, includ
ing the two units of physical ed
ucation. The action would be
"retroactive to all undergradu
ates now in the University."
A month later, the Executive
Committee gave the recommen
dation its unqualified approval.
The General Studies Commit
tee has eleven members, seven
of them appointed by the Execu
tive Committee. Robert A. Walk
er, director of general studies
and the overseas campus pro
gram, is chairman. Other ap
pointed members are Richard H.
Eastman, professor of chemis
try; Lorenz Eitner, professor of
art history; H. Bruce Franklin,
associate professor of English;
Edwin M. Good, associate profes
sor of religion; David C. Reg
ney, professor of biology; and
Lorie Tarshis, professor of eco
nomics.
Administration Members
Four ex-offiico members vote
on the committee because of
their administrative positions.
They are Richard W. Lyman,
vice president and provost; Her
bert L. Packer, vice provost for

academic planning; Robert R.
Sears, dean of humanities and
sciences; and Joseph M. Pettit,
dean of the engineering school.
The Executive Committee,
which is referring the activity
credit proposal to the Academic
Council, is an elected body of
nine faculty members who con
duct the Council's business be
tween its quarterly meetings.
Kenneth J. Arrow, professor
of economics, is chairman. Other
members are Ernest R. Hilgard,
professor of psychology; Robert
W. Ackerman, professor of En
glish; Robert A. Chase, profes
sor of surgery; Charles A. Drek
meier, professor of political sci
ence; Marc A. Franklin, profes
sor of law; William M. Kays, pro
fessor of mechanical engineer
ing; Konrad B. Krauskopf, pro
fessor of geochemistry; and John
L. Mothershead, professor of
philosophy.

nine faculty members who con
duct the Council's business be
tween its quarterly meetings.
Kenneth J. Arrow, professor
of economics, is chairman. Other
members are Ernest R. Hilgard,
professor of psychology; Robert
W. Ackerman, professor of En
glish; Robert A. Chase, profes
sor of surgery; Charles A. Drek
meier, professor of political sci
ence; Marc A. Franklin, profes
sor of law; William M. Kays, pro
fessor of mechanical engineer
ing; Konrad B. Krauskopf, pro
fessor of geochemistry; and John
L. Mothershead, professor of
philosophy.
The Academic Council will be
asked to abolish activity credit
requirements for undergraduates
at its meeting January 5.
Undergraduates, including the
class of 1968, will no longer have
to take six non-credit activity
units to earn a bachelor's degree
if the faculty body approves
recommendations from both the
influential Committee on Gen
eral Studies and the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.
The proposal would end the
requirement of two classes in
physical education during the
freshman or sophomore years.
No Longer Useful
"The Activity Requirement in
the General Studies Program has
outlived its usefulness," accord

ing to a report from the Gen
eral Studies committee, chaired
by Robert A. Walker. The com
mittee voted unanimously Oct.
11 to recommend abolition. •
The activity requirement was
adopted by the Academic Coun
cil in 1956.
A majority vote at the Aca
demic Council's Jan. 5 meeting
will be required to end the ac
tivity credit system. The 900-
member body, which includes all
faculty with a rank of at least
assistant professor, meets once
each quarter.
Approval Expected
Explicit recommendations such
as this from the Executive Com
mittee, chaired by Economics
Prof. Kenneth J. Arrow, are
usually approved by the Coun
cil. The activity credit recom

mendation is strengthened furth
er by the support of the General
Studies committee, which has de
bated the future of activity cre
dits for more than a year and
a half.
Past attempts to abolish ac
tivity requirements have been
opposed by the music and wom
en's physical education depart
ments, which feared a shortage
of students if participation in
group activities was not re
quired.
The Academic Council, besides
voting outright approval or re
jection of the Executive Commit
tee's recommendation, could send
the motion back for further
study. It could also request that
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) consider activity re
quirements first.
Vigorous Opposition
Herbert L. Packer, vice pro
vost and chairman of the SES
steering committee, said he
would "oppose vigorously" a de
lay just to allow SES to study
the requirement.
Packer is also a member of
the General Studies committee.
When the committee made its
recommendation to abolish the
requirement, "objections were
considered and found wanting,"
he explained.
Luell W. Guthrie, executive
head of the women's physical
education department, said yes
terday she expected some de
cline in freshmen's enrollment
in physical education courses if
the activity requirement lapses.
She was confident, however, that
all women would learn "by word
of mouth" that such courses
were worth taking before they
left Stanford.

"lt may eliminate a few peo
ple who would not sample what
the University has to offer," she
said. "I don't anticipate a great
change."
In its present form the activity
requirement states that all un
dergraduates under 24 except
veterans and married students
must "participate in organized
activities to a total value of six
non-credit units."
No more than two units can
be earned in one quarter.
Besides physical education
courses, activities such as band,
orchestra, student government,
publications, sailing club, tutor
ing, axe commission and ROTC
give students one activity credit
per quarter.
More than 50 campus organi

zations, in fact, have been ap
proved by the General Studies
committee as acceptable for ac
tivity credit.
In a memorandum the com
mittee gave these reasons for the
decision:
• Qualifications of entering
students have improved so that
"now, virtually all entering
freshmen have distinguished
themselves in both academic and
extra-curricular pursuits in their
respective high schools."
• The requirement "often be
comes an obstacle to many of
our more talented students, who
are very busy with more im
portant concerns."
Bed-Tape Cutter
• "An enormovs amount of
record-keeping" will be eliminat-
Ed along with the requirement.
"The Committee doubts that the
number of man-hours involved
is justified by the actual value
of the requirement to the stu
dents."
• Fulfillment of the activity
requirement can't be closely sup
ervised, thus making it "practi
cally impossible to insure an
equitable distribution of activity
credits . . . doubtless many per
sons are granted activity credit
for doing very little." Since some
activity credits are hard to
earn, "there is danger of injus
tices occurring."
A formal motion to do away
with the activity requirement
was first introduced to the Gen
eral Studies committee on Feb
ruary 16, 1966 by Robert J. Wert,
then Stanford's dean of under
graduate education and now
president of Mills College.
Gradual Phase-Out
A month later the committee
adopted a resolution asking for
gradual dismantling of the acti
vity requirement, eliminating
two units per year, starting with
the class entering in fall of 1966.
Opposition came immediately
from the music department and
women's physical education de
partments, and the Executive
Committee tabled the proposal.
Debate within the General Stu
dies committee continued into
1967. In February the committee
withdrew its original recommen
dation for a phased end to the
requirement. This hesitation re
sulted from two considerations:
(1) continued protests from cer
tain departments, and (2) the
suggestion that the newly or
ganized Study of Education at
Stanford should deal with the
matter.

Besides, the Executive Com
mittee had never acted on the
original motion to abolish the
activity requirement.
However, by this fall members
of the General Studies committee
felt action on the activity re
quirement should be delayed no
longer. Members of the General
Studies office, in fact, told fresh
man sponsors in pre-registration
briefings that the requirement
would almost certainly lapse be
fore the entering class gradu
ated.
On Oct. 11 the committee ap
proved a memorandum from
Peter Dahl, assistant to Walker,
which asked immediate aboli
tion of the requirement, includ
ing the two units of physical ed
ucation. The action would be
"retroactive to all undergradu
ates now in the University."
A month later, the Executive
Committee gave the recommen
dation its unqualified approval.
The General Studies Commit
tee has eleven members, seven
of them appointed by the Execu
tive Committee. Robert A. Walk
er, director of general studies
and the overseas campus pro
gram, is chairman. Other ap
pointed members are Richard H.
Eastman, professor of chemis
try; Lorenz Eitner, professor of
art history; H. Bruce Franklin,
associate professor of English;
Edwin M. Good, associate profes
sor of religion; David C. Reg

Lorie Tarshis, professor of eco

Administration Members
Four ex-offiico members vote
on the committee because of
their administrative positions.
They are Richard W. Lyman,
vice president and provost; Her

academic planning; Robert R.

dean of the engineering school.
The Executive Committee,
which is referring the activity

Council, is an elected body of
nine faculty members who con
duct the Council's business be

Kenneth J. Arrow, professor
of economics, is chairman. Other
members are Ernest R. Hilgard,
professor of psychology; Robert
W. Ackerman, professor of En

The Academic Council will be
asked to abolish activity credit
requirements for undergraduates
at its meeting January 5.
Undergraduates, including the

to take six non-credit activity
units to earn a bachelor's degree
if the faculty body approves
recommendations from both the
influential Committee on Gen

However, by this fall members
of the General Studies committee

On Oct. 11 the committee ap

Peter Dahl, assistant to Walker,
which asked immediate aboli

"retroactive to all undergradu

A month later, the Executive

A month later, the Executive

The General Studies Commit
tee has eleven members, seven
of them appointed by the Execu

and the overseas campus pro

pointed members are Richard H.
Eastman, professor of chemis
try; Lorenz Eitner, professor of
art history; H. Bruce Franklin,
associate professor of English;
Edwin M. Good, associate profes
sor of religion; David C. Reg

Administration Members
Four ex-offiico members vote
on the committee because of
their administrative positions.
They are Richard W. Lyman,
vice president and provost; Her
bert L. Packer, vice provost for

academic planning; Robert R.
Sears, dean of humanities and
sciences; and Joseph M. Pettit,
dean of the engineering school.
The Executive Committee,
which is referring the activity
credit proposal to the Academic
Council, is an elected body of
nine faculty members who con
duct the Council's business be
tween its quarterly meetings.
Kenneth J. Arrow, professor
of economics, is chairman. Other
members are Ernest R. Hilgard,
professor of psychology; Robert
W. Ackerman, professor of En
glish; Robert A. Chase, profes
sor of surgery; Charles A. Drek
meier, professor of political sci
ence; Marc A. Franklin, profes

fessor of mechanical engineer
ing; Konrad B. Krauskopf, pro
fessor of geochemistry; and John
L. Mothershead, professor of
philosophy.
The Academic Council will be
asked to abolish activity credit
requirements for undergraduates
at its meeting January 5.
Undergraduates, including the
class of 1968, will no longer have
to take six non-credit activity
units to earn a bachelor's degree
if the faculty body approves
recommendations from both the
influential Committee on Gen
eral Studies and the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.
The proposal would end the
requirement of two classes in
physical education during the
freshman or sophomore years.
No Longer Useful
"The Activity Requirement in
the General Studies Program has
outlived its usefulness," accord

ing to a report from the Gen
eral Studies committee, chaired
by Robert A. Walker. The com
mittee voted unanimously Oct.
11 to recommend abolition. •
The activity requirement was
adopted by the Academic Coun
cil in 1956.
A majority vote at the Aca
demic Council's Jan. 5 meeting
will be required to end the ac
tivity credit system. The 900-
member body, which includes all
faculty with a rank of at least
assistant professor, meets once
each quarter.
Approval Expected
Explicit recommendations such
as this from the Executive Com
mittee, chaired by Economics
Prof. Kenneth J. Arrow, are
usually approved by the Coun
cil. The activity credit recom

mendation is strengthened furth
er by the support of the General
Studies committee, which has de
bated the future of activity cre
dits for more than a year and
a half.
Past attempts to abolish ac
tivity requirements have been
opposed by the music and wom
en's physical education depart
ments, which feared a shortage
of students if participation in
group activities was not re
quired.
The Academic Council, besides
voting outright approval or re
jection of the Executive Commit
tee's recommendation, could send
the motion back for further
study. It could also request that
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) consider activity re
quirements first.
Vigorous Opposition
Herbert L. Packer, vice pro
vost and chairman of the SES
steering committee, said he
would "oppose vigorously" a de
lay just to allow SES to study
the requirement.
Packer is also a member of
the General Studies committee.
When the committee made its
recommendation to abolish the
requirement, "objections were
considered and found wanting,"
he explained.
Luell W. Guthrie, executive
head of the women's physical
education department, said yes
terday she expected some de
cline in freshmen's enrollment
in physical education courses if
the activity requirement lapses.
She was confident, however, that
all women would learn "by word
of mouth" that such courses
were worth taking before they
left Stanford.

"lt may eliminate a few peo
ple who would not sample what
the University has to offer," she
said. "I don't anticipate a great
change."
In its present form the activity
requirement states that all un
dergraduates under 24 except
veterans and married students
must "participate in organized
activities to a total value of six
non-credit units."
No more than two units can
be earned in one quarter.
Besides physical education
courses, activities such as band,
orchestra, student government,
publications, sailing club, tutor
ing, axe commission and ROTC
give students one activity credit
per quarter.
More than 50 campus organi

zations, in fact, have been ap
proved by the General Studies
committee as acceptable for ac
tivity credit.
In a memorandum the com
mittee gave these reasons for the
decision:
• Qualifications of entering
students have improved so that
"now, virtually all entering
freshmen have distinguished
themselves in both academic and
extra-curricular pursuits in their
respective high schools."
• The requirement "often be
comes an obstacle to many of
our more talented students, who
are very busy with more im
portant concerns."
Bed-Tape Cutter
• "An enormovs amount of
record-keeping" will be eliminat-
Ed along with the requirement.
"The Committee doubts that the
number of man-hours involved
is justified by the actual value
of the requirement to the stu
dents."
• Fulfillment of the activity
requirement can't be closely sup
ervised, thus making it "practi
cally impossible to insure an
equitable distribution of activity
credits . . . doubtless many per
sons are granted activity credit
for doing very little." Since some
activity credits are hard to
earn, "there is danger of injus
tices occurring."
A formal motion to do away
with the activity requirement
was first introduced to the Gen
eral Studies committee on Feb
ruary 16, 1966 by Robert J. Wert,
then Stanford's dean of under
graduate education and now
president of Mills College.
Gradual Phase-Out
A month later the committee
adopted a resolution asking for
gradual dismantling of the acti
vity requirement, eliminating
two units per year, starting with
the class entering in fall of 1966.
Opposition came immediately
from the music department and
women's physical education de
partments, and the Executive
Committee tabled the proposal.
Debate within the General Stu
dies committee continued into
1967. In February the committee
withdrew its original recommen
dation for a phased end to the
requirement. This hesitation re
sulted from two considerations:
(1) continued protests from cer
tain departments, and (2) the
suggestion that the newly or
ganized Study of Education at
Stanford should deal with the
matter.

Besides, the Executive Com
mittee had never acted on the
original motion to abolish the
activity requirement.
However, by this fall members
of the General Studies committee
felt action on the activity re
quirement should be delayed no
longer. Members of the General
Studies office, in fact, told fresh
man sponsors in pre-registration
briefings that the requirement
would almost certainly lapse be
fore the entering class gradu
ated.
On Oct. 11 the committee ap
proved a memorandum from
Peter Dahl, assistant to Walker,
which asked immediate aboli
tion of the requirement, includ
ing the two units of physical ed

"retroactive to all undergradu

original motion to abolish the
activity requirement.
However, by this fall members
of the General Studies committee
felt action on the activity re
quirement should be delayed no
longer. Members of the General
Studies office, in fact, told fresh
man sponsors in pre-registration
briefings that the requirement
would almost certainly lapse be
fore the entering class gradu
ated.
On Oct. 11 the committee ap
proved a memorandum from
Peter Dahl, assistant to Walker,
which asked immediate aboli
tion of the requirement, includ
ing the two units of physical ed
ucation. The action would be
"retroactive to all undergradu
ates now in the University."
A month later, the Executive
Committee gave the recommen
dation its unqualified approval.
The General Studies Commit
tee has eleven members, seven
of them appointed by the Execu
tive Committee. Robert A. Walk
er, director of general studies
and the overseas campus pro
gram, is chairman. Other ap
pointed members are Richard H.
Eastman, professor of chemis
try; Lorenz Eitner, professor of
art history; H. Bruce Franklin,
associate professor of English;
Edwin M. Good, associate profes

ney, professor of biology; and
Lorie Tarshis, professor of eco
nomics.
