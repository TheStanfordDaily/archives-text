# Activity Credits Dropped Jan. 5 If Council Agrees
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The Academic Council will be
asked to abolish activity credit
requirements for undergraduates
at its meeting January 5.
Undergraduates, including the
class of 1968, will no longer have
to take six non-credit activity
units to earn a bachelor's degree
if the faculty body approves
recommendations from both the
influential Committee on Gen
eral Studies and the Executive
Committee of the Academic
Council.
The proposal would end the
requirement of two classes in
physical education during the
freshman or sophomore years.
No Longer Useful
"The Activity Requirement in
the General Studies Program has
outlived its usefulness," accord

ing to a report from the Gen
eral Studies committee, chaired
by Robert A. Walker. The com
mittee voted unanimously Oct.
11 to recommend abolition. •
The activity requirement was
adopted by the Academic Coun
cil in 1956.
A majority vote at the Aca
demic Council's Jan. 5 meeting
will be required to end the ac
tivity credit system. The 900-
member body, which includes all
faculty with a rank of at least
assistant professor, meets once
each quarter.
Approval Expected
Explicit recommendations such
as this from the Executive Com
mittee, chaired by Economics
Prof. Kenneth J. Arrow, are
usually approved by the Coun
cil. The activity credit recom

mendation is strengthened furth
er by the support of the General
Studies committee, which has de
bated the future of activity cre
dits for more than a year and
a half.
Past attempts to abolish ac
tivity requirements have been
opposed by the music and wom
en's physical education depart
ments, which feared a shortage
of students if participation in
group activities was not re
quired.
The Academic Council, besides
voting outright approval or re
jection of the Executive Commit
tee's recommendation, could send
the motion back for further
study. It could also request that
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) consider activity re
quirements first.
Vigorous Opposition
Herbert L. Packer, vice pro
vost and chairman of the SES
steering committee, said he
would "oppose vigorously" a de
lay just to allow SES to study
the requirement.
Packer is also a member of
the General Studies committee.
When the committee made its
recommendation to abolish the
requirement, "objections were
considered and found wanting,"
he explained.
Luell W. Guthrie, executive
head of the women's physical
education department, said yes
terday she expected some de
cline in freshmen's enrollment
in physical education courses if
the activity requirement lapses.
She was confident, however, that
all women would learn "by word
of mouth" that such courses
were worth taking before they
left Stanford.

"lt may eliminate a few peo
ple who would not sample what
the University has to offer," she
said. "I don't anticipate a great
change."
In its present form the activity
requirement states that all un
dergraduates under 24 except
veterans and married students
must "participate in organized
activities to a total value of six
non-credit units."
No more than two units can
be earned in one quarter.
Besides physical education
courses, activities such as band,
orchestra, student government,
publications, sailing club, tutor
ing, axe commission and ROTC
give students one activity credit
per quarter.
More than 50 campus organi

zations, in fact, have been ap
proved by the General Studies
committee as acceptable for ac
tivity credit.
In a memorandum the com
mittee gave these reasons for the
decision:
• Qualifications of entering
students have improved so that
"now, virtually all entering
freshmen have distinguished
themselves in both academic and
extra-curricular pursuits in their
respective high schools."
• The requirement "often be
comes an obstacle to many of
our more talented students, who
are very busy with more im
portant concerns."
