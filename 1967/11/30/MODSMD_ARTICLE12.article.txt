One of the more irritating vestiges of Stan
ford's paternalism toward its students is on the
<way out.
The activity requirement for undergraduates
will end Jan. 5, if the Academic Council follows
the unanimous recommendations of its Executive
Committee and Committee on General Studies.
A Stanford bachelor's degree has been denied
any undergraduate who failed to take two physi
cal education courses and four other quarters of
extracurricular activity. Any extracurricular ac
tivity would do, from cricket to girl scout leader
ship.
On a practical level, the abolition of activity
credits relieves students of a troublesome inter
ference with their studies. Participation in a
bureaucratically certified group activity just
wasn't the way many students wanted to spend
their time away from studies.
But the philosophical implications of the ac
! tion are much more significant. Requiring a stu
dent to join some organization or play at some
sport three times a week indicates a fundamental
mistrust of the student's maturity.
Why admit a 17-year-old man or woman to
Stanford if he or she can't even be trusted to
spend some time in worthwhile extracurricular
activities?
Can not a student intelligent enough to study
Plato decide for himself whether or not a physi
cal education course is important for his educa
[ tion?
The underlying issue is the same for many
regulations imposed on undergraduates. Despite
' some encouraging reforms in the past three
years, these relics of in loco parentis remain as
- social regulations:
» Women must live in dormitories, except for
; 100 senior coeds permitted to reside off-campus;
' women must (1) return to their dormitories by

a ccrtain hour, or (2) leave a written message
telling where they can be reached; and men and
women can have members of the opposite sex,
as the saying goes, in their rooms only during
certain hours on certain days.
Where freedom is denied, so is responsibility.
When most youths break the law, they are prose
cuted according to the laws of their city or state.
When Stanford students break (many) laws,
they are protected by the Dean of Students of
fice and given some private reprimand.
None of these University policies make sense
for adults. All of them make sense for children.
What are Stanford students, adults or children?
