Recent criticisms of Dean of the Chapel B.
Davie Napier and professors of religion are dis
tressing, but certainly not unexpected.
When men such as these begin to talk about
religion as a part of life, of the necessity for reli
gion to commit itself to values and action, they
are bound to encounter some reactions. For too
long, religion has been conceived as something
devoid of values and devoid of concrete action.
Just as religious missionary work in underde
veloped countries has been altered to focus on
the social and economic problems of the people,
the religious efforts in the intellectual environ
ment of the University must now be focused on
the most basic social values and institutions of
our society.
Some of the petty fault-finding common re
cently does nothing but attempt to slander these
men. While these professors are not to be seen
as minor campus gods, they are courageously
charting a new.relevance for religion.
