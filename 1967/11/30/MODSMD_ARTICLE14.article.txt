## How To Defeat Hanoi 
### Art Buchwald 
My good friend, Kronig, was
a picture of despair.
"What's the matter, Kronig?"
I wanted to know.
"I can't help it,"he said.
"Every time I open my mouth
I give aid and comfort to the
enemy."
"But how?" I demanded.
"I don't agree with President
Johnson's policies in Vietnam.
And he said that every time we
say we don't agree with him,
Hanoi is encouraged and wants
to continue the war."
From The Horses Mouth?
"That's true, Kronig," I said.
"The President knows from
whence he speaks. North Viet
nam would probably be at the
negotiating table right now if
people like you didn't oppose
President Johnson's policies."
"But that's just the point,"
Kronig cried. "I haven't opened
my trap for six months and
we're not anywhere nearer re
solving the problem than we
were before."
"You mean you haven't been
loudly and openly opposing
President Johnson on Vietnam
for six months?"
'So Help Me LBJ'
"That's right," Kronig said.
"Six months ago I made a deci
sion. I decided that according to
Dean Rusk and Hubert Hum
phrey and President Johnson
the only reason Hanoi would
not cave in was because Ho Chi
Minh thought the country was
divided on our role in Vietnam.
I took an oath not to say a word
against President Johnson.
"I advocated stronger bomb
ing, closing the port of Hai
phong, defoliation of the DMZ,
building a wall between the bor

ders â€” everything that Johnson
wanted. I signed an advertise
ment supporting the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. 1 marched in
the American Legion parade.
And after doing all that, Hanoi
still wouldn't come to the nego
tiating table."
"It's true, Kronig, that you
have a right to be discouraged.
But these things take time. You
can't just stop criticizing Presi
dent Johnson for six months
and think the picture in Viet
nam is going to change. This
thing may take years."
The Watchword Is Caution
"You mean I can't criticize
President Johnson for years?"
"Not unless you want to give
aid and comfort to the enemy,"
I said.
"But what about the elections
in 1968?" Kronig said.
"You have to be especially
careful during the elections of
1968. You see, Kronig, Hanoi is
going to be watching us very
carefully in '68. If there is any
indication that voters don't
agree with President Johnson
on Vietnam, then Hanoi will
fight harder. The only way to
deliver a defeat to the North
Vietnamese is to elect President
Johnson in a landslide."
Unanimous For Johnson
"But what about the Republi
cans?" Kronig asked. "If they
put up a candidate in 1968, won't
they be giving aid and comfort
to the enemy, too?"
"Yes, they will, Kronig, and
this is what President Johnson
is trying to tell them. If the Re
publicans would refrain from
running anyone in 1968, Hanoi
might cave in overnight."
"Why don't we pass up the

elections in '68 altogether?"
Kronig said.
"If this would shorten the war,
President Johnson would prob
ably be for it."
