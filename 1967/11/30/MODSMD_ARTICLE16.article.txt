# Letters To The Editor
## Fort Worth Mother Strikes Again? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Hurray for Fritz Schaefer and
his article in the November 10th
Daily. I agree with every word
he wrote!
It Is plain to see why you put
it on a back page as a "Letter to
the Editor" instead of running it
under the author's byline of
"Scene and Herd". Only Dave
Harris, Oakland Marchers or
Young Democrats for a Commu
nist Society (let's see, that is
the correct title for that group
isn't it?) are entitled to front
page billing in your paper.
I believe The Stanford Daily
long ago quit belonging to the
average Stanford student or rep
resenting more than a handful
of radical activists. The ones
who came for an education just
don't read the slander sheet any
more.
You can sign me "Just An
other Fritz Schaefer".
(Editor's note: This letter was
postmarked Fort Worth, Texas.
The Daily was, unfortunately,
unable to ascertain whether or
not it was submitted by the in
famous "Fort Worth Mother.")
• The Big Top
Editor, the Daily:
This letter might appropriate
ly be published under the head
line "The LASSU Circus." This
situation would be readily appar
ent to anyone who would care
to drop in at any meeting.
To remedy LASSU's present
condition, I would propose the
two following reforms, which I
will introduce in LASSU.
(1) Debate on any bill should
be limited to one hour and the
reports of the ASSU officers
should be limited to ten min
utes each. LASSU members
might then have enough emo
tional energy to consider more
than one important item per
meeting.
(2) A quorum should auto
matically exist for four hours
after the meeting is called to
order, or until all of the items
on the agenda have been con
sidered. Thus consideration of
important legislation could not
be blocked by the departure of
outvoted or uninterested mem
bers.
If these reforms are instituted,
perhaps LASSU can become
less of an entertaining show
and more of a serious legislative
body.

• Falling Chips
Editor, The Daily:
The full purpose and struc
ture of C-15 is somewhat ob
scure to us, but we must com
ment on a letter in the Novem
ber 22 Daily from Robert Span
ner.
Mr. Spanner exhibits lethal ig
norance, and does so in an in
sulting way. He is simply wrong
to say that the manifest racist
attributes of American society
are irrelevant to campus events.
What happens on campus af
fects the surrounding society.
Far more important, Black peo
ple are abused and exploited
everywhere else in America, and
it is absurd to imply that Stan
ford is somehow immune to the

diseases of the society that feeds
it.
Black people are going to
carve for themselves a decent
life only by exerting various
kinds of force. This is so in
every aspect of the American
social structure, including pol
icy committees at Stanford.
White people who want to see
human rights for all, must sup
port Black representation on
these committees to assure that
the full reality of American life
is not distorted.
Most White people (particu
larly those at Stanford) have led
lives protected from the physical
and emotional violence Black
people are subjected to. As a
rule, we cannot realize what
this violence is, because it is so
foreign to our experience.
We must recognize our inade
quacies in feeling what it is to
be Black, and our consequent
inability to represent Black peo
ple's perspective. And this per
spective must be represented in
sofar as Stanford has responsi
bilities to itself and responsibili
ties to American society (and
to the world).
This is the very least that
must be done. This is a course
aimed at reform. Many people
have had it with reform: they
advocate and prepare for revo
lution.
Mr. Spanner can lecture Black
people on the nature of racism
and on the virtues of cold ra
tionality if he chooses to make
this his contribution; for our
part we think it is time White
people listened to instead of
talked at Black people. If we
were Black, we think we would
want to answer Mr. Spanner's
"dialogue" with guns, "when the
chips are down." And in our
view, the chips are already fall
ing.

• Who Killed Soccer?
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford varsity soccer
team staggered through its worst
season in 16 years (3-7-2, not 3-5-
2 as reported), made only more
dismal by the Daily article of
Nov. 22. However, to imply that
the blame for the season rests
solely on Coach Priddle . . . that
does unalterable harm to this
man.
It is somehow ironic that a
sports enthusiast such as Mr.
Selby would overlook the fact
that it was the same Fred
Priddle who coached the NCAA
semifinalist four years ago! In
all honesty, this year's team just
didn't have the basic soccer tal
ent of past years.
Of the two legitimate com
plaints which were raised in the
article — inadequate practice
space, and the coach's token com
pensation — only the former suf
ficiently provoked the team into
approaching Chuck Taylor
There is one point on which I
agree with Mr. Selby: "The sad
part about the criticisms is they
have come solely at the urging
of Stevens, who began active
criticism last spring" (prior, it
is emphasized, to this past sea
son's showing!). Sammy's entire
campaign has been rather under
handed: approaching the Daily
while avoiding the Athletic De
partment , soliciting the support
of freshmen whom Priddle does
not even coach, and demeaning
Mr. Priddle's other University at
tachments. Those who know
Priddle and White cannot doubt
their sincerity; that the editor
absolved the Daily of any at
tack on Sammy's sincerity im
plies something quite the con
trary. Mr. Selby's last para
graphs further intimate this pos
sibility.
In response to his query, I
say Yes! the soccer team was
stabbed in the back! And Mr. Sel
by has guided the dagger!

• Surveying Support
Editor, The Daily:
Being on the scene of the wa
we must interpret the amount of
home support for the war from
the newspapers and magazines
that we receive. From these
sources it is still extremely diffi
cult to measure the pulse of pub
lic opinion. We, the officers and
men of U.S. Naval Mobile Con
struction Battalion SIX, wonder
if students across the nation arc
genuinely against our presence
in Vietnam.
The voice of dissent has al
ways been louder than that of
affirmation and therefore is
quite discouraging to us in this

situation.
We hope that by surveying
some of the more prominent uni
versities and colleges across the
nation we may hear from some
of the hitherto silent supporters
of the war. Unlike most surveys,
this one is designed to give our
men moral support in the form
of letters from individuals ex
pressing his or her views on
what newspapers seen to pro
claim as America's most unpopu
lar war in view of popular sup
port. These replies would be a
tremendous morale boost to the
99% of the men serving here
that feel our presence is needed
and that we are winning the war.
Of course we would also be in
terested to hear from the dis
senters although we do see them
everyday on the front pages of
the newspapers of the world.
Replies should be addressed to

• Who Killed Soccer?
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford varsity soccer
team staggered through its worst
season in 16 years (3-7-2, not 3-5-
2 as reported), made only more
dismal by the Daily article of
Nov. 22. However, to imply that
the blame for the season rests
solely on Coach Priddle . . . that
does unalterable harm to this
man.
It is somehow ironic that a
sports enthusiast such as Mr.
Selby would overlook the fact
that it was the same Fred
Priddle who coached the NCAA
semifinalist four years ago! In
all honesty, this year's team just
didn't have the basic soccer tal
ent of past years.
Of the two legitimate com
plaints which were raised in the
article — inadequate practice
space, and the coach's token com
pensation — only the former suf
ficiently provoked the team into
approaching Chuck Taylor
There is one point on which I
agree with Mr. Selby: "The sad
part about the criticisms is they
have come solely at the urging
of Stevens, who began active
criticism last spring" (prior, it
is emphasized, to this past sea
son's showing!). Sammy's entire
campaign has been rather under
handed: approaching the Daily
while avoiding the Athletic De
partment , soliciting the support
of freshmen whom Priddle does
not even coach, and demeaning
Mr. Priddle's other University at
tachments. Those who know
Priddle and White cannot doubt
their sincerity; that the editor
absolved the Daily of any at
tack on Sammy's sincerity im
plies something quite the con
trary. Mr. Selby's last para
graphs further intimate this pos
sibility.
In response to his query, I
say Yes! the soccer team was
stabbed in the back! And Mr. Sel
by has guided the dagger!

It Is plain to see why you put

To remedy LASSU's present
condition, I would propose the
two following reforms, which I
will introduce in LASSU.
(1) Debate on any bill should
be limited to one hour and the
reports of the ASSU officers
should be limited to ten min
utes each. LASSU members
might then have enough emo
tional energy to consider more
than one important item per
meeting.
(2) A quorum should auto

after the meeting is called to
order, or until all of the items
on the agenda have been con
sidered. Thus consideration of
important legislation could not
be blocked by the departure of
outvoted or uninterested mem

If these reforms are instituted,

Editor, The Daily:
The full purpose and struc
ture of C-15 is somewhat ob
scure to us, but we must com
ment on a letter in the Novem
ber 22 Daily from Robert Span
ner.
Mr. Spanner exhibits lethal ig
norance, and does so in an in
sulting way. He is simply wrong
to say that the manifest racist
attributes of American society
are irrelevant to campus events.
What happens on campus af
fects the surrounding society.
Far more important, Black peo
ple are abused and exploited
everywhere else in America, and
it is absurd to imply that Stan
ford is somehow immune to the

diseases of the society that feeds
it.
Black people are going to
carve for themselves a decent
life only by exerting various
kinds of force. This is so in
every aspect of the American
social structure, including pol
icy committees at Stanford.
White people who want to see
human rights for all, must sup
port Black representation on
these committees to assure that
the full reality of American life
is not distorted.
Most White people (particu
larly those at Stanford) have led
lives protected from the physical
and emotional violence Black
people are subjected to. As a
rule, we cannot realize what
this violence is, because it is so
foreign to our experience.
We must recognize our inade
quacies in feeling what it is to
be Black, and our consequent
inability to represent Black peo
ple's perspective. And this per
spective must be represented in
sofar as Stanford has responsi
bilities to itself and responsibili
ties to American society (and
to the world).
This is the very least that
must be done. This is a course
aimed at reform. Many people
have had it with reform: they
advocate and prepare for revo
lution.
Mr. Spanner can lecture Black

It Is plain to see why you put

To remedy LASSU's present

will introduce in LASSU.
(1) Debate on any bill should
be limited to one hour and the

should be limited to ten min

might then have enough emo

(2) A quorum should auto

• Falling Chips
Editor, The Daily:
The full purpose and struc
ture of C-15 is somewhat ob
scure to us, but we must com
ment on a letter in the Novem
ber 22 Daily from Robert Span
ner.
Mr. Spanner exhibits lethal ig
norance, and does so in an in
sulting way. He is simply wrong
to say that the manifest racist
attributes of American society
are irrelevant to campus events.
What happens on campus af
fects the surrounding society.
Far more important, Black peo
ple are abused and exploited
everywhere else in America, and
it is absurd to imply that Stan
ford is somehow immune to the

diseases of the society that feeds
it.
Black people are going to
carve for themselves a decent
life only by exerting various
kinds of force. This is so in
every aspect of the American
social structure, including pol
icy committees at Stanford.
White people who want to see
human rights for all, must sup
port Black representation on
these committees to assure that
the full reality of American life
is not distorted.
Most White people (particu
larly those at Stanford) have led
lives protected from the physical
and emotional violence Black
people are subjected to. As a
rule, we cannot realize what
this violence is, because it is so
foreign to our experience.
We must recognize our inade
quacies in feeling what it is to
be Black, and our consequent
inability to represent Black peo
ple's perspective. And this per
spective must be represented in
sofar as Stanford has responsi
bilities to itself and responsibili
ties to American society (and
to the world).
This is the very least that
must be done. This is a course
aimed at reform. Many people
have had it with reform: they
advocate and prepare for revo
lution.
Mr. Spanner can lecture Black
people on the nature of racism
and on the virtues of cold ra
tionality if he chooses to make
this his contribution; for our
part we think it is time White
people listened to instead of
talked at Black people. If we
were Black, we think we would
want to answer Mr. Spanner's
"dialogue" with guns, "when the
chips are down." And in our
view, the chips are already fall

• Who Killed Soccer?
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford varsity soccer
team staggered through its worst
season in 16 years (3-7-2, not 3-5-
2 as reported), made only more
dismal by the Daily article of
Nov. 22. However, to imply that
the blame for the season rests
solely on Coach Priddle . . . that
does unalterable harm to this
man.
It is somehow ironic that a
sports enthusiast such as Mr.
Selby would overlook the fact
that it was the same Fred
Priddle who coached the NCAA
semifinalist four years ago! In
all honesty, this year's team just
didn't have the basic soccer tal
ent of past years.
Of the two legitimate com
plaints which were raised in the
article — inadequate practice
space, and the coach's token com
pensation — only the former suf
ficiently provoked the team into
approaching Chuck Taylor
There is one point on which I
agree with Mr. Selby: "The sad
part about the criticisms is they
have come solely at the urging
of Stevens, who began active
criticism last spring" (prior, it
is emphasized, to this past sea
son's showing!). Sammy's entire
campaign has been rather under
handed: approaching the Daily
while avoiding the Athletic De
partment , soliciting the support
of freshmen whom Priddle does
not even coach, and demeaning
Mr. Priddle's other University at
tachments. Those who know
Priddle and White cannot doubt
their sincerity; that the editor
absolved the Daily of any at
tack on Sammy's sincerity im
plies something quite the con
trary. Mr. Selby's last para
graphs further intimate this pos
sibility.
In response to his query, I
say Yes! the soccer team was
stabbed in the back! And Mr. Sel
by has guided the dagger!

• Surveying Support
Editor, The Daily:
Being on the scene of the wa
we must interpret the amount of
home support for the war from
the newspapers and magazines
that we receive. From these
sources it is still extremely diffi
cult to measure the pulse of pub
lic opinion. We, the officers and
men of U.S. Naval Mobile Con
struction Battalion SIX, wonder
if students across the nation arc
genuinely against our presence
in Vietnam.
The voice of dissent has al
ways been louder than that of
affirmation and therefore is
quite discouraging to us in this

situation.
We hope that by surveying
some of the more prominent uni
versities and colleges across the
nation we may hear from some
of the hitherto silent supporters
of the war. Unlike most surveys,
this one is designed to give our
men moral support in the form
of letters from individuals ex
pressing his or her views on
what newspapers seen to pro
claim as America's most unpopu
lar war in view of popular sup
port. These replies would be a
tremendous morale boost to the
99% of the men serving here
that feel our presence is needed
and that we are winning the war.
Of course we would also be in

Mr. Spanner can lecture Black

• Who Killed Soccer?
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford varsity soccer
team staggered through its worst
season in 16 years (3-7-2, not 3-5-
2 as reported), made only more
dismal by the Daily article of
Nov. 22. However, to imply that
the blame for the season rests
solely on Coach Priddle . . . that
does unalterable harm to this
man.
It is somehow ironic that a
sports enthusiast such as Mr.
Selby would overlook the fact
that it was the same Fred
Priddle who coached the NCAA
semifinalist four years ago! In
all honesty, this year's team just
didn't have the basic soccer tal
ent of past years.
Of the two legitimate com
plaints which were raised in the
article — inadequate practice
space, and the coach's token com
pensation — only the former suf
ficiently provoked the team into
approaching Chuck Taylor
There is one point on which I
agree with Mr. Selby: "The sad
part about the criticisms is they
have come solely at the urging
of Stevens, who began active
criticism last spring" (prior, it
is emphasized, to this past sea
son's showing!). Sammy's entire
campaign has been rather under
handed: approaching the Daily
while avoiding the Athletic De
partment , soliciting the support
of freshmen whom Priddle does
not even coach, and demeaning
Mr. Priddle's other University at
tachments. Those who know
Priddle and White cannot doubt
their sincerity; that the editor
absolved the Daily of any at
tack on Sammy's sincerity im
plies something quite the con
trary. Mr. Selby's last para
graphs further intimate this pos
sibility.
In response to his query, I
say Yes! the soccer team was
stabbed in the back! And Mr. Sel
by has guided the dagger!

• Surveying Support
Editor, The Daily:

we must interpret the amount of
home support for the war from
the newspapers and magazines
that we receive. From these
sources it is still extremely diffi
cult to measure the pulse of pub
lic opinion. We, the officers and

if students across the nation arc
genuinely against our presence

The voice of dissent has al

quite discouraging to us in this

situation.
We hope that by surveying
some of the more prominent uni
versities and colleges across the
nation we may hear from some
of the hitherto silent supporters
of the war. Unlike most surveys,
this one is designed to give our
men moral support in the form
of letters from individuals ex
pressing his or her views on
what newspapers seen to pro
claim as America's most unpopu

tremendous morale boost to the
99% of the men serving here
that feel our presence is needed
and that we are winning the war.
Of course we would also be in

It Is plain to see why you put

To remedy LASSU's present

two following reforms, which I
will introduce in LASSU.
(1) Debate on any bill should
be limited to one hour and the
reports of the ASSU officers
should be limited to ten min

might then have enough emo

than one important item per
meeting.
(2) A quorum should auto

after the meeting is called to
order, or until all of the items
on the agenda have been con
sidered. Thus consideration of
important legislation could not
be blocked by the departure of
outvoted or uninterested mem

If these reforms are instituted,

We hope that by surveying
some of the more prominent uni
versities and colleges across the
nation we may hear from some
of the hitherto silent supporters
of the war. Unlike most surveys,
this one is designed to give our
men moral support in the form
of letters from individuals ex
pressing his or her views on
what newspapers seen to pro
claim as America's most unpopu
lar war in view of popular sup
port. These replies would be a
tremendous morale boost to the
99% of the men serving here
that feel our presence is needed
and that we are winning the war.
Of course we would also be in

senters although we do see them
everyday on the front pages of
the newspapers of the world.

Ever since my boy, Warren,

went to Stanford I have read and

when my boy Warren was a stu

Editor, The Daily:
Hurray for Fritz Schaefer and
his article in the November 10th
Daily. I agree with every word
he wrote!
It Is plain to see why you put
it on a back page as a "Letter to
the Editor" instead of running it
under the author's byline of
"Scene and Herd". Only Dave
Harris, Oakland Marchers or
Young Democrats for a Commu
nist Society (let's see, that is
the correct title for that group
isn't it?) are entitled to front
page billing in your paper.
I believe The Stanford Daily
long ago quit belonging to the
average Stanford student or rep
resenting more than a handful
of radical activists. The ones
who came for an education just
don't read the slander sheet any
more.
You can sign me "Just An
other Fritz Schaefer".

postmarked Fort Worth, Texas.
The Daily was, unfortunately,
unable to ascertain whether or
not it was submitted by the in

• The Big Top
Editor, the Daily:
This letter might appropriate
ly be published under the head
line "The LASSU Circus." This
situation would be readily appar
ent to anyone who would care
to drop in at any meeting.
To remedy LASSU's present
condition, I would propose the
two following reforms, which I
will introduce in LASSU.
(1) Debate on any bill should
be limited to one hour and the
reports of the ASSU officers
should be limited to ten min
utes each. LASSU members
might then have enough emo
tional energy to consider more
than one important item per
meeting.
(2) A quorum should auto
matically exist for four hours
after the meeting is called to
order, or until all of the items
on the agenda have been con
sidered. Thus consideration of
important legislation could not
be blocked by the departure of
outvoted or uninterested mem
bers.
If these reforms are instituted,
perhaps LASSU can become
less of an entertaining show
and more of a serious legislative
body.

• Falling Chips
Editor, The Daily:
The full purpose and struc
ture of C-15 is somewhat ob
scure to us, but we must com
ment on a letter in the Novem
ber 22 Daily from Robert Span
ner.
Mr. Spanner exhibits lethal ig
norance, and does so in an in
sulting way. He is simply wrong
to say that the manifest racist
attributes of American society
are irrelevant to campus events.
What happens on campus af
fects the surrounding society.
Far more important, Black peo
ple are abused and exploited
everywhere else in America, and
it is absurd to imply that Stan
ford is somehow immune to the

diseases of the society that feeds
it.
Black people are going to
carve for themselves a decent
life only by exerting various
kinds of force. This is so in
every aspect of the American
social structure, including pol
icy committees at Stanford.
White people who want to see
human rights for all, must sup
port Black representation on
these committees to assure that
the full reality of American life
is not distorted.
Most White people (particu
larly those at Stanford) have led
lives protected from the physical
and emotional violence Black
people are subjected to. As a
rule, we cannot realize what
this violence is, because it is so
foreign to our experience.
We must recognize our inade
quacies in feeling what it is to
be Black, and our consequent
inability to represent Black peo
ple's perspective. And this per
spective must be represented in
sofar as Stanford has responsi
bilities to itself and responsibili
ties to American society (and
to the world).
This is the very least that
must be done. This is a course
aimed at reform. Many people
have had it with reform: they
advocate and prepare for revo
lution.
Mr. Spanner can lecture Black
people on the nature of racism
and on the virtues of cold ra
tionality if he chooses to make
this his contribution; for our
part we think it is time White
people listened to instead of
talked at Black people. If we
were Black, we think we would
want to answer Mr. Spanner's
"dialogue" with guns, "when the
chips are down." And in our
view, the chips are already fall
ing.

• Who Killed Soccer?
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford varsity soccer
team staggered through its worst
season in 16 years (3-7-2, not 3-5-
2 as reported), made only more
dismal by the Daily article of
Nov. 22. However, to imply that
the blame for the season rests
solely on Coach Priddle . . . that
does unalterable harm to this
man.
It is somehow ironic that a
sports enthusiast such as Mr.
Selby would overlook the fact
that it was the same Fred
Priddle who coached the NCAA
semifinalist four years ago! In
all honesty, this year's team just
didn't have the basic soccer tal
ent of past years.
Of the two legitimate com
plaints which were raised in the
article — inadequate practice
space, and the coach's token com
pensation — only the former suf
ficiently provoked the team into
approaching Chuck Taylor
There is one point on which I
agree with Mr. Selby: "The sad
part about the criticisms is they
have come solely at the urging
of Stevens, who began active
criticism last spring" (prior, it
is emphasized, to this past sea
son's showing!). Sammy's entire
campaign has been rather under
handed: approaching the Daily
while avoiding the Athletic De
partment , soliciting the support
of freshmen whom Priddle does
not even coach, and demeaning
Mr. Priddle's other University at
tachments. Those who know
Priddle and White cannot doubt
their sincerity; that the editor
absolved the Daily of any at
tack on Sammy's sincerity im
plies something quite the con
trary. Mr. Selby's last para
graphs further intimate this pos
sibility.
In response to his query, I
say Yes! the soccer team was
stabbed in the back! And Mr. Sel
by has guided the dagger!
