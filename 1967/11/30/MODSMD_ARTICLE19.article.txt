# EPA Municipal Council
## 
### LOUIS KNOWLES 
On November 14th as all of
San Mateo County was choosing
a congressman, East Palo Alto
was electing five members to a
new body know as the Municipal
Council.
The Council is the brain child
of white politicians in San Ma
teo County. It grew out of a
special report finished last year
by the Local Agency Formation
Commission. The Council is
thought of by county officials as
a first step toward dealing with
the problem of unincorporated
East Palo Alto. The plan was de
cided upon with the direct con
sent of the community.
The Municipal Council is to
be an advisory body for the
County Board of Supervisors. Its
chief administrative assistant
will be a county employee. It is
hoped that it will prepare the
way for a city council in East
Palo Alto.
The Municipal Council will no
doubt do some good in creating

greater visibility for the prob
lems of the black community,
but there is no guarantee its
suggestions will be acted upon
by the all-white Board of Super
visors, for the Council has no
delegated powers.
Moderates and Activists
The campaign pitted a ticket
from the Committee for Equal
Representation against a group
known as Community's Choice.
The former organization has a
history of taking the moderate
course in trying to work with
the white power structure. Henry
Anthony, one of its leading
spokesmen, proposed group dis
cussions for citizens and sher
iff's deputies as a remedy for
the present hostility.
Community's Choice was com
posed of candidates associated
with activist programs such as
the Day School, Mothers for
Equal Education, and last sum
mer's Teen Program.
Four Out Of Five
The election results proved
very interesting. The Committee
for Equal Representation won
four out of five seats on the
Council. But in three cases the
contest was decided by a hair
line margin of a very few votes.
In these three close races that
CER won, the decisive votes
were cast by the white portion
of East Palo Alto that lies west
of the Bayshore Freeway. Paula
Preuss, the lone Community's
Choice victor, is white and will
represent the west of Bayshore
district.
Without the white support for
the moderate ticket, Commu

nity's Choice would have won a
majority of Council seats. On
the other hand militant majori
ties east of Bayshore were very
slim. A little more organizational
effort might have turned out im
portant votes among the 44 c /c of
registered voters that stayed at
home.
Will It Do Any Good?
But if there appears to be a
lack of enthusiasm among black
militants over the Municipal
Council it may be traced to their
cynicism over yet another white
program which bears no guaran
tee beyond the good will of the
Supervisors.
In a sense the CER will do a
very fine job on the Municipal
Council. They will work well
with the white politicians and
they may succeed in glossing
over the discontent of the com
munity for a time. But the CER
is the voice of the bourgeois Ne
groes, not of the black commu
nity.
Thecmilitant leaders who have
most heavily influenced the
young people will remain out
side the Council. They are the
people who fought for and won a
black majority on the local
school board. It is this leader
ship that inspired the formation

of the Black Student Union at
Menlo-Atherton High.
Separatism Inevitable
The activists will continue to
lay the groundwork lor parallel
institutions such as the propos
ed Marcus Garvey Freedom
School which was discussed as
an aternative during the crisis
at Menlo-Atherton.
As long as white structures do
not give black leaders the means
to real political power within
existing forms of local govern
ment the formation of parallel
structures will continue and
seperatism will grow apace.
The almost 50-50 split of the
vote shows that the attitude in
the black community is not as
activist-oriented as Black Power
leaders would like it to be, but a
lot more militant than white peo
ple have thought. Another year
or two of work should give the
activists a sound majority to
support their demands for self
government.
