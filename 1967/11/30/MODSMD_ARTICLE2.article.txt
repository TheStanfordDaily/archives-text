# UC Protests Block Sprout
## 
### 
An orderly crowd of 1500 to
2000 students held a rally in
Sproul Plaza yesterday to pro
test the punishment of 11 stu
dents for participating in anti
draft demonstrations in viola
tion of University of California
rules.
After the rally, 700 took part
in a mill-in in Sproul Hall, the
campus administrative center.
The demonstrators were re
acting to the suspension of
Peter Camejo, 27, and Reese
Erlich, 20, by Chancellor Roger
W. Heyns. The other nine stu
dents singled out for disciplin
ary action received less severe
punishments, despite recom
mendations from the dean's of
fice for suspension.
In all, 71 students were cited
for participating in the campus
anti-draft action of last month.
The university has not identi
fied them, although Erlich and
Camejo voluntarily disclosed
their sentences.
The mill-in began after the
mid-day rally in the Plaza. Dem
onstrators surged past a barrier
of two campus policemen and
two deans and into the dean of
students' office on the second
floor of the building.
Rally leaders shouted instruc
tions over bullhorns, demand
ing, "We want to see the dean."
The second and third floors of
the four-story hall were jammed
with demonstrators pushing
their way up from the ground
level; some managed to advance
to the top floor.

Throughout, monitors urged
the demonstrators to act in an
orderly, non-violent manner.
The demonstration was car
ried out minus two of its leaders
â€”Came jo and Mike Smith. They
were taken into custody earlier
in the day on orders of Munici
pal Court Judge George Brunn
of Berkeley. Bail on an old
charge of resisting arrest was
raised from $250 to $5000.
