# 'Improve Rooms'
## Stern Surveys Residents 
### JOHN ALCORN 
Stern Hall, built over fifteen
years ago, is in need of repairs
and improvements. Last week
the Stern Office circulated ques
tionnaires to ascertain what stu
dents residing in Stern believed
to be the most urgently needed
improvements.
"The questionnaires were in
formative and helpful in that
they did point out some things
that can bo done quickly and at
small expense," commented Wil
liam L. Leland, Director of the
Stern Houses. He stated that
some strong conclusions about
what is needed in Stern can be
derived from the survey:
• There was an overwhelm
ing emphasis on room improve
ments in the questionnaires.
• Stern's back four houses in
dicated that their greatest need
is carpeting (the front houses al
ready have it.)
• Stern residents strongly urg
ed that telephones be installed in
all rooms.
• Many also pointed out the
need for improved lighting.
Other Recommendations
Other items mentioned, of rela
tively minor importance when
compared to how strongly the
above - mentioned improvements
were mentioned, were more
single rooms, table cloths and
larger closets for the front
houses. Closets in the back
houses are almost fifty percent
larger than those in front.
Leland emphasized, "It should
n't seem that we're obsessed with
physical aspects. More important
is how individuals relate to each

other." Sometimes, however, how
individuals relate to each other
depends upon their physical en
vironment. Stern residents made
clear through the questionnaire
that their physical environment
needs improvement.
New Phone System
For some time the University
has been discussing the possi
bility of installing the Centrex
telephone system, making a
phone available to the residents
of each room. It was discovered,
however, that this plan has been
under consideration for about
three years.
Even if the University were
to decide today in favor of the
system, it would take between
two and three years to install
the phones.
Leland referred to the fact
that the University Business Of
fice has an anuual amount desig
nated for dormitory renovation
of about $250,000. This sum is
divided among the various Uni
versity residences. The Business
Office establishes the priorities
as to how this money will be al
lotted.
Improvements In Summer
Most of this money is allocated
for major items which are im
proved during the summer, in
order not to disrupt dorm life.
Leland designated a major item
as something costing over $1,000.
Carpeting, if installed in
Stern's back houses, would defi
nitely have to wait until next
summer. "Curtains would pos
sibly be an exception (as a major
item)," said Leland, and could
possibly be installed during this
school year.

Sometimes Stern repairs must
be paid for by the individual
houses. Leland said that the
Stern Office provides for "nor
mal wear and tear," but must
assess the houses when damage
is done due to negligence or
pranks. The cost of any improve
ments due to the questionnaire
results would be taken care of,
then, by the Stern Office and not
by the individual houses.

Stern Houses. He stated that
some strong conclusions about
what is needed in Stern can be
derived from the survey:
• There was an overwhelm
ing emphasis on room improve
ments in the questionnaires.
• Stern's back four houses in
dicated that their greatest need
is carpeting (the front houses al
ready have it.)
• Stern residents strongly urg
ed that telephones be installed in
all rooms.
• Many also pointed out the
need for improved lighting.
Other Recommendations
Other items mentioned, of rela
tively minor importance when
compared to how strongly the
above - mentioned improvements
were mentioned, were more
single rooms, table cloths and
larger closets for the front
houses. Closets in the back
houses are almost fifty percent
larger than those in front.
Leland emphasized, "It should
n't seem that we're obsessed with
physical aspects. More important
is how individuals relate to each

other." Sometimes, however, how
individuals relate to each other
depends upon their physical en
vironment. Stern residents made
clear through the questionnaire
that their physical environment
needs improvement.
New Phone System
For some time the University
has been discussing the possi
bility of installing the Centrex
telephone system, making a
phone available to the residents
of each room. It was discovered,
however, that this plan has been
under consideration for about
three years.
Even if the University were
to decide today in favor of the
system, it would take between
two and three years to install
the phones.
Leland referred to the fact
that the University Business Of
fice has an anuual amount desig
nated for dormitory renovation
of about $250,000. This sum is
divided among the various Uni
versity residences. The Business
Office establishes the priorities
as to how this money will be al
lotted.
Improvements In Summer
Most of this money is allocated
for major items which are im
proved during the summer, in
order not to disrupt dorm life.
Leland designated a major item
as something costing over $1,000.
Carpeting, if installed in
Stern's back houses, would defi
nitely have to wait until next
summer. "Curtains would pos
sibly be an exception (as a major
item)," said Leland, and could
possibly be installed during this
school year.

Sometimes Stern repairs must
be paid for by the individual
houses. Leland said that the
Stern Office provides for "nor
mal wear and tear," but must
assess the houses when damage
is done due to negligence or
pranks. The cost of any improve
ments due to the questionnaire
results would be taken care of,
then, by the Stern Office and not
by the individual houses.
Stern Hall, built over fifteen
years ago, is in need of repairs
and improvements. Last week
the Stern Office circulated ques
tionnaires to ascertain what stu
dents residing in Stern believed
to be the most urgently needed
improvements.
"The questionnaires were in
formative and helpful in that
they did point out some things
that can bo done quickly and at
small expense," commented Wil

Stern Houses. He stated that
