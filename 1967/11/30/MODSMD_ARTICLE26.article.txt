# Administration Shuts Down 'Obscene' S.F. State Weekly
## 
### 
San Francisco State President
John Summerskill shut down the
controversial student weekly
Open Process for publishing of
fensive material yesterday. He
also suspended editor Blair Palt
ridge and contributor Jefferson
Poland, founder of the Sexual
Freedom League.
The faculty-student Board of
Publications had on Tuesday re
fused SummerskiU's request that
it suspend the paper until the
board held a formal dismissal
hearing for Paltridge.
Summerskill's move came as
a result of a poem in the Novem
ber 22 issue by Poland dedicated
to the school's athletic director.
The president said he took ac
tion because of "material . . .
which referred to a member of
the faculty in a context which
was offensive to members of the
academic community."
Open Process was suspend
ed last spring after publish
ing material that the administra

tion objected to. It was reinstated
after Paltridge pledged the pub
lication would have a tone and
context appropriate to an aca
demic institution. At that time
Poland also agreed to stop writ
ing about sex.
Summerskill had been under
heavy criticism since the Board
had delayed its dismissal hear
ing until next week. Assembly
man Leo J. Ryan told Summer
skill in a letter that the weekly
was "disgusting trash."
