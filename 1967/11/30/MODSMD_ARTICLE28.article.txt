# Archibald Urges Viet Dividing Line
## 
### 
Roy Archibald, Democratic
candidate for Congress in San
Mateo County, yesterday called
for a line of demarcation in
Vietnam and said "it is con
ceivable that we can pull out in
six months, if we really try."
Archibald addressed a group
of 10 students huddled in Cub
berley Auditorium. He was spon
sored by the Stanford Political
Union.
He called for a Korea-type set
tlement of the war and urged
that the United States establish

a stable military front which
can be defended by forces now
in the field. He said he favors
neither immediate withdrawal
nor further escalation of the
war.
Archibald advocated negotia
tion through other countries and
the United Nations. He said the
U.S. should make absolutely
clear its intention to withdraw
as soon as possible and should
turn over more and more politi
cal, military, and economic re
sponsibility to the Vietnamese
government.
Within the demarcation zone,
he said, it would be up to the
South Vietnamese government
to make their own settlement
with the Viet Cong and the Na
tional Liberation Front.
A student commented that
the Stanford student body is
"disillusioned with Johnson's re
jection of all rational argument"
and little disposed to believe in
one Congressman's ability to
reach him.
Archibald said that if elected
he would belong to the 100-
Democratic Northwest Study
Group, which has already ex
pressed considerable disagree
ment with Johnson's policies. If
the group could come to a gen
eral agreement, he said its votes
could block and influence the na
tional policy.
Archibald was the leading
Democrat in San Mateo's pri
mary election to fill the Con
gressional seat vacated by the
death of J. Arthur Younger. He
will oppose Paul N. McCloskey,
the leading Republican.
