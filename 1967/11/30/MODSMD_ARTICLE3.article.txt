# Russ vs. Hungary-Question Of Politics
## 
### NICK SELBY 
The Soviet intervention in
Hungary in 1956, was not a
question of international law,
but rather a matter of Russian
national interest in an eastern
European revolt which showed
every sign of succeeding, con
cluded three scholars in last
night's panel discussion on "For
eign Intervention in Civil Strife."
The discussion, held in the
Forum Room of the Undergradu
ate Library, was the first in a
year-long series on this topic,
sponsored by the Law School's
International Society.
Dr. Ivo Lederer and Dr. Mark
Mancall of Stanford, and Dr. An
drew Janos of Berkeley analyzed
the intervention in terms of
pressures both in Eastern Eur
ope and throughout the world.
Lederer maintained that Krus
chev's denunciation of Stalin in
1956 resulted in deep unrest in
eastern Europe in the summer
of 1956.
Riots in Poland might have
led to Russian intervention, but,
said Lederer, "Russians were
lenient, hoping permissiveness
would stabilize the unrest."
When Hungary revolted, the
only alternative for the Soviets
was to react severly and crush
the revolt. This action was per
haps an "over-action", said Led
erer, but it effectively halted re
volts in Eastern Europe.
Lederer also stressed that the
Domino theory was given great
weight in shaping Soviet policy
making. Fear of revolts in Ru
mania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia,
and Yugoslavia forced the Rus
sians to "take surgical methods

to cure the epidemic of revolt,"
said Lederer.
Janos explored the attitude of
western nations to the interven
tion. "Criticism is due for Presi
dent Eisenhower and Secretary
of State Dulles on account of
their eagerness to show the So
viets that the United States
planned no intervention. Their
actions made it easier for the
Russians to intervene."
Mancall stressed that the re
volt moved from a Communist
oriented uprising against the
Hungarian Communist police
state (which insurrection would
have resulted in the reasertion
of state dominance) to a move
ment publically directed against
the Soviets and Communism.
Mancall said this modification
of goals forced the Russians to
crush the revolt with more bru
tality than they might otherwise
have used.
Sad Function Of Law
Did international law play a
part in the Russians decision to
intervene? Janos repeatedly said
that no one could really be sure
of Russian deliberations with
regard to the crisis, but he did
mention that the Russians cre
ated a puppet government in
Hungary which ostensibly
asked for intervention.
This puppet government was
established after the Hungar
ians repudiated the Warsaw
pact, which had been previously
used as the basis of interven
tion.
"Sadly," Janos concluded, "it
is a function of international
law to make intervention legiti
mate."
