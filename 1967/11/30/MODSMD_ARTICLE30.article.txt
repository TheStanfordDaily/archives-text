# Law School Faces Social Needs
## 
### DAN SNELL (Third of a Series) 
Assistant Dean Thomas Head
rick told The Dally that a law
yer "is viewed as a pragmatic
problem solver; our traditions
have cast him in that role."
The Stanford law school, Head
rick said, is engaged in "finding
new ways of dealing with the
problems the society has."
' "The lawyer and law student
are led to try to conceive new
forms of institutions," he said.
"In addition, the students are
simply trying to find out more
about the world."
Headrick said that research in
the school is "gradually broad
ening" and multi-disciplinary stu
dies of various kinds are coming
into being, utilizing the research
es of both the social and the
natural sciences.
Med School Retreat
He mentioned as an example
a retreat held last weekend in
which four law professors, five
doctors from the Stanford Medi
cal Center, and three theologians
from Religious Studies met to
consider the possible legal and
moral implications of last week's
announcement by the Medical
School that doctors there were
ready to try a heart transplant.
"No one is quite sure what
this development may mean,"
Headrick said. Doctors who take
a heart from a patient who is
dying are killing him, even
though death is imminent.
Other problems the School is
considering include the legal
problems raised by computers
in society. The School is now
formulating a law and computer
fellowship program in which
young potential law professors
could study the impact of the
computer on society.
Headrick pointed to the Law
School's Chilean summer pro
gram as an example of "the in
creasing ferment in the Law
School and its increasing in
volvement with the world."

Last summer for the first time
about eight young law professors
from Chile came to Stanford to
study the law curriculum and
the teaching methods used in
the United States. At the end of
the summer the professors go
to other U.S. law schools to con
sult with other teachers and de
velop their materials.
The program is funded by a
foundation for two more sum
mers.
New Building
Headricks thinks the new
building for the Law School, to
be occupied in the fall of 1971,
will be an excellent place to car
ry on the broadening of the
study of law.
The present Law School build
ing at the front of the Quad is
fast becoming overcrowded. "We
add two or three faculty mem
bers a year," Headrick said, "and
they all need offices." Already
some Law School classes are be
ing taught in the new Graduate
School of Business building.
Inj thcj new building to be built
on Alvarado Street due south
of the Meyer Undergraduate Li
brary each law student will have
a carrel in the Law Library or
an office elsewhere in the build
ing.
Faculty offices in the new
building will be large enough to
carry on small seminars in them.
The Law Library, now scatter
ed around the corridors of the
building, will be brought togeth
er in a central library complex.
The library now has about 150,-
000 volumes but will be expand
ed to 500,000 volumes after the
new building is built.
The library will be a better
place for research than it is now,
according to Headrick. And it
will also have facilities for audio
visual equipment including video
tape.
Headrick said that the whole
building is designed so that the
students and the faculty can
spend more time together.

"We've given a lot of thought to
the placement of the lounges
and canteens in the building so
that student-faculty contact will
come a lot more easily," Head
rick said.
At present many of the faculty
offices are located on the fourth
floor of the law building and are
rather out of the way, according
to the assistant dean.
The architects are now finish
ing up the schematic drawings
for the building after having con
sulted at length with the faculty
about what features the building
should have. The drawings will
probably be submitted for ap
proval to the Board of Trustees
of the University at their De
cember meeting.
Anniversary Year
Although next year is the Law
School's seventy-fifth anniver
sary, Headrick said no "big pack
age" of events was being plan
ned.
"We considered really making
something of it," Headrick said,
"but it was decided that a lot of
time and energy would have been
expended that could have been
better spent in other programs."
J. Keith Mann, associate dean
of the school, described to The
Daily a joint degree program
carried out by the Law School
and the Graduate School of Busi
ness. A student takes the first
year program in the Law School.
He spends his second year
taking the first year of business
school and spends two more
years in a legal-business study.
The student earns his law de
gree and his masters in business
administration in four years.
This is just one example of
the growing flexibility of the
Law School's curriculum, accord
ing to Mann. Law students may
also take up to nine quarter
units in courses outside the
school in the University even
though the Law School now
operates on a semester schedule.
The flexibility of program is

not unique to Stanford, Mann
pointed out. Harvard Law School
has just abolished all require
ments after the first year in
the school, as Stanford had pre
viously done.
Variety Of Interest
Mann traces the flexibility to
a larger variety of interests
among the professors and the
students. "Such interests are re
flected in the curriculum," he
said.
The associate dean said that
the constant stream of visitors
to the school is merely a sign
of the educational activities go
ing on there. Mann said, "The
whole life of the school is in
volved in the legal education
process."
Mann believes that one cannot
repudiate the "service-station ap
proach" to the role of the law
school. Many see the school as
merely a supplier of the legal
talent which society needs.
"But the Law School is first
and foremost an educational in
stitution," Mann said. "It is a
place where one can think with
depth about questions of import
ance."
Problems considered in the
school are not "viewed solely in
terms of advocacy, though of
course the adversary process is
basic to how issues get decided
in this country," Mann said.

Mann, who served this past
summer as chairman of a Presi
dential arbitration committee for
a labor dispute, said he conduct
ed a seminar this fall in which
he took up the dispute he had
worked on.
Discuss Case
Mann invited the actual parti
cipants in the dispute to the sem
inar to discuss the case to let his
students evaluate what happen
ed for themselves. The associate
dean stressed that such practical
studies are not necessarily car
ried out to inculcate skill in the
future lawyers to deal with the
same situation.
"But in the Law School we
do use the 'real world' to a very
considerable extent," Mann said.
Research-Oriented
Mann also predicts that higher
study of the law will become
more research-oriented as is
graduate study in other disci
plines.
He pointed out that there are
several law professors who hold
joint appointments from the
Stanford Law School and other
departments within the Univer
sity.
"We're not a tight little island
over here in the Law School,"
Mann said. "Both faculty and
students feel they are part of
the University."
