# New Lab Studies Immunology

### 
Study of the body's immune
system, quietly but steadily
growing in the past decade, has
suddenly burst forth as a scien
tific field with important clinical
application in the treatment of
patients.
Immunology is one bridge be
tween the basic and clinical sci
ences that promises an ever-in
creasing impact on both treat
ment and research in areas such
as cancer and the rheumatic di
seases.
In accord with these develop
ments, the School of Medicine,
in conjunction with the Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital, has es
tablished its first Clinical Im
munology Laboratory under the
supervision of Dr. Gordon
Sharp, assistant professor of
medicine.
One of two tests which relates
most specifically to the rheumat
ic diseases, has proved very use
ful in diagnosing systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE), a serious
inflammatory disorder affecting
many organ systems of the
body, commonly known as "lu
pus."
"It has been known for some
time that patients with lupus
have a factor in their serum
which, in a test situation, re
sults in a peculiar reaction
where degenerating cell nuclei

are ingested by white blood
cells. This is known as the LE
cell phenomenon."
"The test we are using," de
clares Dr. Sharp, "will reveal
cases of lupus that might have
been missed by the standard
LE cell test being done in many
other laboratories. Not only will
it detect almost all of the anti
nuclear factors, but it is highly
specific, having very infrequent

positive findings in normal in
dividuals or patients with unre
lated diseases."
"Use of this test has been
found by the hospital and the
medical community to be so suc
cessful in the diagnosis of lupus
that increased demand and use
were partially responsible for
the establishment of the new
laboratory," according to Dr.
Sharp.


NEW IMMUNOLOGY LABORATORY â€” Dr. Gordon Sharp, assist
ant professor of medicine, examines blood serum samples of "lupus"
patients. This test for abnormal antibodies is one of several used to
diagnose disorders of the body's Immune system in the new Clinical
Immunology Laboratory.
