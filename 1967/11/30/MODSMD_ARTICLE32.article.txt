# Lecture vs. Seminar: Opinions Differ
## 
### CLAUDIA WILKEN 
Stanford is "setting forth a
feast of knowledge and learn
ing," says Professor Kenneth J.
Arrow, "but we may not be
serving it in the most appetiz
ing way."
Lectures and seminars are the
two methods in which this ban
quet is being presented. The
question is, which is better?
"The lecture method is one by
which a reasonably large
amount of information can be
conveyed relatively expedi
tiously',' Arrow said. A lecturer
can also "create a synthesis" of
information from various
sources that would be hard for
a student to do on his own.
Some of the good sources of in
formation are often too ad
vanced for the student, Arrow
added, and the lecturer can
bridge the gap.
"You first have to get the
necessary background, more or
less accumulate a certain
amount of knowledge, before
you can fruitfully question it,"
said Professor Walter E. Meyer
hof of the Physics department.
Seminar Less Efficient
Although the seminar is a
slower and generally less effici
ent method of imparting infor
mation, its advantages result
from its demand that the stu
dent be actively involved in the
subject, rather than just pas
sively listening to the instructor
"Lectures encourage passiv
ity. The seminar has the enor
mous advantage of engaging
the student," says Arrow.
Mathematics professor Karel
DeLeeuw adds, "Learning takes
place when the student is doing
something active."
"The lecture is a shortcut,
a compromise," says history
professor Paul S. Seaver. "It
enables you to get over a body
of material more efficiently, but
you sacrifice active involvement
in the process."
The seminar develops in the
student different methods of
thought and different abilities
than does the lecture. The lec
ture is a presentation of infor
mation, while the seminar cen
ters on an attack of problems.
Chicago Study
As a result, according to a
University of Chicago study, a
lecture evokes "primarily those
thoughts which are appropriate
to the following and compre
hending of information, while
discussion is more successful in
evoking complex, problem solv
ing types of thought."
Similarly, electrical engineer
ing professor Ralph Smith said,
"The advantage of a seminar
is that students must learn to
formulate thoughts and express
their ideas in writing or speak
ing."
Professor Robert C. North of
the political science department
says, "In a seminar there is
more possibility for stimulat
ing independent thought."
The Study of Education, in
its undergraduate paper, seems
to imply a greater value placed
on the active learning in sem
inars than the passive compre
hension of information in a lec
ture.
Increasing Ability
The paper states, "Greatly
increasing the students' ability
and inclination to continue
learning, which we believe must

be the central goal of the under
graduate program, does not
come about through passive in
gestion of scattered superficiali
ties.
"Means must surely exist to
increase educational effective
nessâ€”perhaps through greater
emphasis of learning instead of
teaching, on reading instead of
listening, on self-directed work
instead of formal courses."
The advantages and disadvan
tages of seminars and lectures
are only abstractions until they
are related to the needs of speci
fic subject areas.
According to professors in
several University departments,
the value of the seminar meth
od ranges from "ideal" to "not
valuable' depending on the sub
ject being taught.
Discussion Classes
Small discussion classes are
ideal for any history course, ac
cording to Prof. Seaver, of the
history department. "Essen
tially, historical reflection con
sists of asking questions, going
back and looking at the evi
dence, and coming back and
asking more questions."
Lectures, and even lectures
supplemented by discussion ses
sions with teaching assistants,
are "shortcuts, compromises
forced by finances and person
nel," Seaver said.
"The seminar size is ideal in
political science. I can't think
of anything I'm involved in that
I wouldn't welcome teaching
as a seminar," said Prof. North.
But he would not rule out lec
tures, particularly in introduc
tory courses.
He would like to see only the
"really important lectures" in
cluded, so that lectures would
not be a routine thing, but
would be attended "with the
same spark of intellectual cur

iousity with which one might
attend a really stimulating pub
lic lecture."
Combination Of Both
A combination of both sem
inars and lectures would be the
ideal method of education in the
English department, according
to department chairman Pro
fessor Thomas C. Moser.
"It's extremely important for
undergraduates to have had the
experience of being in a semin
ar," he s&id, but both methods
have value, and "you can learn
a great deal from a good lecture
course."
Jerome Charyn, assistant pro
fesor of English, prefers semin
ars for English study because
he feels that "it is impossible
to literally know a work of art.
At best you can talk about it."
The majority of physics
courses, however, are taught as
lectures, with opportunity for
asking questions, and the fac
ulty thinks this is the most ef
ficient way in that discipline,
according to Professor Walter
E. Meyerhof.
Arguable Questions
"In the humanities one deals
much more with questions that
are arguable than in a science
like physics, except at an ad
vanced level. This means that a
discussion at a less advanced
level is to my mind not as valu
able as training," Meyerhof
said.
Professor Leonard I. Schiff,

also of the physics department,
believes that "a seminar can be
useful, even on an early level,
provided it is a small class of
strongly montivated students."
But, if they are not already
strongly motivated, a lecture is
better, he said.
The dominant mode of educa
tion in electrical engineering,
according to Prof. Smith, is a
combination of lecture-discus
sion (a lecture class of about
30 in which questions from the
students are encouraged) and
problem-solving.
Ideally, he said, engineering
students should have some lec
ture-discussion classes and some
seminars. However, seminars
would be valuable only when
the students are "mature and
possess initiative," when "stu
dent formulation of ideas is im
portant," and when it is a sub
ject "in which there is no auth
ority, so that the ideas of the
student are as valuable as those
of the instructor."
But, he says, "there aren't
many situations like that in the
undergraduate program in en
gineering."
Economics Intermediate
Economics is "sort of inter
mediate" in the question of lec
tures versus seminars, said
Prof. Arrow of the economics
department. "It is more sys
tematic than Engilsh, but less
than physics. I'm rather skep
tical about seminars as an ini

tial phase of learning in eco
nomics. Ideally, the lecture
would be used initially and the
seminar later on, in more ad
vanced courses."
Most people in the math de
partment feel that the lecture
is ideal, according to Prof. De-
Leeuw. "They think the import
ant thing is to impart the facts
to the students and that's that."
DeLeeuw, however, feels that
a mixture of both seminars and
lectures is important in math.
This mixture should occur all
through th e undergraduate
years, he said, rather than us
ing lectures for background
material and saving seminars
for advanced work.
"Even though math is a fixed
body of knowledge," he says,
"there are things you can dis
cuss in a seminar, such as why
one is interested in a problem,
the various ways of attacking a
problem, discovering the rela
tionships between things, and
the whole business of making
a new math."
If the objective of education
in a field is the development of
knowledge about the field, the
lecture is a more efficient meth
od of communicating such
knowledge.
However, if the objective is
the development of abilities in
complex, problem-solving
thought and expression, the
seminar seems to be the su
perior method.
