# Telephone Switch Proposed
## 
### 
Stanford may adopt a new
telephone system that will elimi
nate switchboards and give fast
er, more direct service to the
University community. Installa
tion, though, is at least three
years in the future.
The new system, named Cen
trex, would in effect give stu
dents the same service now en
joyed by most private homes.
The proposed plan calls for
Pacific Telephone to install in
dividual phones in all Stanford
dormitory rooms and offices not
now so equipped. Under this ar

rangemont the campus would
have its own three-number dial
ing prefix, and calls could be
made directly to the outside or
to other rooms.
Asked about chances for the
system's approval by the Board
of Trustees, Vice-President of
Business Affairs Alf Brandin said
only "I haven't the sightest idea
of the chances."
"We've gotten together with
the phone company to analyze
the problem," Brandin continued,
"and we expect to get a report
from the phone company. If

there is economic justification,
then maybe l we can do it."
He added, however, that
"We're enthusiastic about what
it does. We're just waiting to see
if it can be done."
Mr. J. R. Payne, Accountant
Manager for Pacific, was more
optimistic: "A decision is very
imminent," he said, "and T think
the chances are very good it will
be adopted."
Payne also said he thought it
would take about three years for
Centrex to be installed "once the
order is given." It has a very
high priority," he observed.
Concerning prices, Payne esti

mated that they "would be on
a scale with current public rates
â€” possibly lower."
Should the Centrex system be
implemented, it will require a
new housing building as well as
new wiring. Superintendent of
Utilities Homer Davis set the
cost at "in the order of three
quarters of a million dollars."
Actual operating costs, however,
would remain approximately the
same.
Oregon State, Berkeley, and
Davis, among other universities,
have either already installed Cen
trex or are in the process of
adopting it.
