# To Replace IJB
## Appeals Board Considered 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The ASSU legislature will
consider a resolution tonight to
establish a student-faculty ap
peals board with competence
beyond both the dean of stu
dents and the ASSU Judicial
Council.
No such board now exists.
According to LASSU Speaker
Michael Weinstein, the Interim
Judicial Body, wich will hear
the cases of 10 anti-CIA dem
onstrators next week, was
formed by unilateral action of
the University administration
and not by any agreements
with the ASSU.
The student-faculty appeals

board to be proposed to LASSU
would consist of four students
and three faculty members. One
of the students would be chair
man and would vote only in
case of a tie.
The board would have juris
diction over all appeals from
both the Judicial Council and
the dean of students office (if
the student concerned had asked
the dean rather than the coun
cil to hear the case.)
Nominating Committee
The four student members
would be nominated by a com
mittee consisting of the ASSU
president and vice president, the
speaker of LASSU, the legislat
ive liaison officer, the Judicial
Council chairman and the
LASSU Judicial Committee
chairman. The nominations
would be subject to LASSU ap
proval.
The three faculty members
would be chosen by the presi
dent of the University from a
list of six nominations from the
Academic Council.
ASSU does not recognize any
appeals board not consisting of
students and faculty. Such a
board was to be set up follow
ing the judicial compromise of
September 1965, but the pro
posal bogged down when negoti
ators could not agree on how
to choose the student members.
The Interim Judicial Body,
(IJB) five faculty members
chosen by President Wallace
Sterling, was to act temporarily
until a student-faculty board
could be formed to handle ap

peals from the Judicial Council.
Another interim body, to han
dle appeals from the dean's
office, was never set up. The
provision for this separate
board was stricken from the
ASSU by-laws last week by
LASSU.
LASSU Flicks
LASSU will also view a mo
tion picture on the Grove Pro
ject, which it commissioned last
year.
David Brown will deliver a
report from the Community
Government Committee. This
preliminary report will discuss
the committee's fundamental
premises and will deal with the
questions, "In what context will
we operate the Community

Government Committee?" and
"Where are we headed now?"
Other Business
Other bills pending before
LASSU concern payment of
dues to the National Student
Association, a modified salary
structure for The Daily, and an
appropriation for an Interna
tional Law Symposium on Civil
Strife and Intervention.
The results of this year's
head yell leader election will be
presented to LASSU for ap
proval. It is expected the tally
may be contested, since Elec
tions Commissioner Craig
Brown did not receive voting
results from overseas campuses
before a three-day deadline he
set.
