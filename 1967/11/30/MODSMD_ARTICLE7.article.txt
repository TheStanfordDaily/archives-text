# Knocks Gaullist 'Monarchy'
## Mitterand Hits French Policies 
### 
Francois Mitterand yesterday
criticized President Charles de
Gaulle's foreign policy before a
capacity audience in Memorial
Auditorium.
Mitterand, leader of the Fed
eration of the Left, the leading
opposition group in France, dis
agreed with de Gaulle most
strongly on the subjects of the
Common Market, control of
nuclear weapons, and revision
of the international monetary
system.
The bulk of his speech was

devoted to a discussion of how
he would orient French foreign
policy if he were elected Presi
dent of France. Mitterand cap
tured 44 per cent of the vote in
the 1965 runoff election in
which de Gaulle retained the
presidency.
He stated that Great Britain
should be admitted to the Com
mon Market, because she is a
member of the European com
munity and would contribute
valuable technical skills to it.
He would also like to see the

Common Market expanded to
the east. "Czechoslovakia is very
much tied to what is happening
in Europe," he said.
France should exert its influ
ence among the developing na
tions of the world to halt the
dissemination of nuclear weap
ons and to eliminate the possi
bility of a nuclear confrontation
between the U.S. and USSR, ac
cording to Mitterand.
Fiscal Policy Conflict
He also disagrees with de
Gaulle on the revision of inter
national fiscal policy. Mitterand
would like to see an internation
al conference called to adopt a
new international currency. He
sees no future in either the dol
lar as a reserve currency or the
gold standard.
After his speech Mitterand
spoke to a group of reporters.
He said that the United States
should stop the bombing in
Vietnam and negotiate. He also

said he understands America's
desire to maintain its political
equilibrium, and that this desire
explains U.S. involvement In
Southeast Asia.
Growth Of Left
Mitterand outlined the growth
of his leftist grouping from the
Front Populaire which origi
nated in 1936. He stated that
the difference between his So
cialist party and the Communist
party is that the Communists
follow the Russian Revolution
in foreign policy and the So
cialists merely want to apply it
to domestic policy.
He said the Fourth Republic's
successes lay in stabilizing
France's economy after the war,
and its faults lay in its tendency
toward anarchy. Mitterand said
that the achievement of de
Gaulle's Fifth Republic is the
stabilization of the political sit
uation, but its fault is its lean
ing towards monarchy.

Fiscal Policy Conflict
He also disagrees with de
Gaulle on the revision of inter
national fiscal policy. Mitterand
would like to see an internation
al conference called to adopt a
new international currency. He
sees no future in either the dol
lar as a reserve currency or the
gold standard.
After his speech Mitterand
spoke to a group of reporters.
He said that the United States
should stop the bombing in
Vietnam and negotiate. He also

said he understands America's
desire to maintain its political
equilibrium, and that this desire
explains U.S. involvement In
Southeast Asia.
Growth Of Left
Mitterand outlined the growth
of his leftist grouping from the
Front Populaire which origi
nated in 1936. He stated that
the difference between his So
cialist party and the Communist
party is that the Communists
follow the Russian Revolution
in foreign policy and the So
cialists merely want to apply it
to domestic policy.
He said the Fourth Republic's
successes lay in stabilizing
France's economy after the war,
and its faults lay in its tendency
toward anarchy. Mitterand said
that the achievement of de
Gaulle's Fifth Republic is the
stabilization of the political sit
uation, but its fault is its lean
ing towards monarchy.
Francois Mitterand yesterday
criticized President Charles de
Gaulle's foreign policy before a
capacity audience in Memorial
Auditorium.
Mitterand, leader of the Fed
eration of the Left, the leading
opposition group in France, dis
agreed with de Gaulle most
strongly on the subjects of the
Common Market, control of
nuclear weapons, and revision
of the international monetary
system.
The bulk of his speech was

devoted to a discussion of how
he would orient French foreign
policy if he were elected Presi
dent of France. Mitterand cap
tured 44 per cent of the vote in
the 1965 runoff election in
which de Gaulle retained the
presidency.
He stated that Great Britain
should be admitted to the Com
mon Market, because she is a
member of the European com
munity and would contribute
valuable technical skills to it.
He would also like to see the

Common Market expanded to
the east. "Czechoslovakia is very
much tied to what is happening
in Europe," he said.
France should exert its influ
ence among the developing na
tions of the world to halt the
dissemination of nuclear weap
ons and to eliminate the possi
bility of a nuclear confrontation
between the U.S. and USSR, ac
cording to Mitterand.
