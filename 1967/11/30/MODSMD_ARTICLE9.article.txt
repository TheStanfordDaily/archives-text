# Responsibility Gap Decried
## 
### 
The final lecturer in the "Cen
tury 21" series this quarter told
the audience in Dinkelspiel last
night, "We must structure our
social arrangements so as to cre
ate responsibility where there is
power."
Professor Barrett Hardin,
University of California at San
ta Barbara biology instructor,
said this unfilled responsibility
gap is "perhaps the greatest
need of our time."
In opposition to the "secret
ballot", Professor Hardin pro
posed a "responsible ballot" to
eliminate the current attitude of,
"I'm in favor of this or that but
let George do it." Instead, the
voter would be forced to assume
rocrknncihilifv for the POTlSe

quences of his decision. The pur
pose of the responsible ballot is,
then, "to produce a consensus
based on real knowledge rather
than on theoretical moral prin
ciples."
Structure Of Responsibility
Professor Hardin told his
audience that "what we need is
a structure of responsibility that
will enable us to live content in
the cornucopia which we, in
fact, inhabit," not "faster cars,
faster airplanes, and bigger T.V.
sets." He emphasized the fallacy
inherent in the opinion that
"whatever we invent we can
use" and whatever we can use
we need. The importance lies in
distinguishing what is and is not
necessarv.

Instead, Hardin claims, the
world must "say no" to many
new scientific inventions unless
the new development is vital to
the well-being of the world. He
cited as an example the super
sonic transport which has vir
tually made negligible the
amount of time saved when it is
seen in the light of "the atten
dant sonic booms, the longer
runways, and the greater dis
tance to the airport from the
urban centers."
"I think it is not unlikely that
the 21st century may be the
century in which we will delib
erately limit our usage of the
technology we have developed
. . . It may come to be called
'the Century of the Great No'."
