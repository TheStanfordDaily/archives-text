('subject to approval of the powers that be)
Present members of The Daily staff will naturally seek to fill these positions. But preferment is based
on competence and desire, with seniority only a secondary consideration.
For that reason The Daily invites students not presently on the staff to apply for positions. Anyone
whose previous journalistic experience might eventually qualify him for an editorship is urged to begin
working on the newspaper immediately after if resumes publication January 3. That way we'll have time
to size each other up.
The Daily, an independent newspaper operated entirely by students, is open to everyone at Stanford
from freshman to terminal graduate student. It is an equal opportunity organization, discriminating
only against WASPs from Pasadena.
The Daily office is in the Storke Publications Building on Lomita Drive.
