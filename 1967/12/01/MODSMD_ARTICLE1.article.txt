810 BUILDING DEDICATION â€” William F. Herrin Hall and Laboratories were dedicated yester
day by, from left to right, Dr. Wallace Sterling, Dr. George W. Beadle, and Dr. Donald Kennedy.
Beadle, president of the University of Chicago and principal speaker at the dedication, spoke on his
years as biology professor here, where his research on neurospora eventually won him the Nobel
prize. Working on this form of bread mold with Dr. Edward L. Tatum, he was able to show that en
zyme production is controlled by genes. He recounted that the head of biology at Harvard, upon
hearing of Beadle's plans to leave for Stanford in 1937, warned him, "Stanford never was any good,
it isn't any good, and it never will be any good."
