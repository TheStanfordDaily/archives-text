# The 						Judicial Crisis
## 
### 
The state of the student judicial system is a
mess.
The Judicial Council is saying it will not try
violations of University policy except as viola
tions of the Fundamental Standard. And the
interpretation of the Fundamental Standard
seems to change from case to case.
The ASSU legislature refuses to recognize
any appals board over the Judicial Council that
docs not have students on it. And the administra
tion will never give up the privilege of final
say in student disciplinary matters.
The dean of students, always a man to enforce
University policy conscientiously, will take his
cases to the all-faculty Interim Judicial Body
if not to the all-student Judicial Council.
The root of the problem is mistrust on both
sides Students want the right to be heard by
their peers. The administration, on the other
hand, wants to make sure infractions of their
rules are punished and are not sure students can
be trusted to do it.
What the administration really wants is to
be reasonably sure the students on a student
faculty board would not be responsive to stu
dent's political interests.
Regardless of intention, this attitude is an
insult to the integrity of the student leadership.
Moreover, it makes the administration's attitude
inconsistent.
The administration does not seem to have
questioned whether it is wise, not to say demo
cratic, to have a prosecuter (the dean of stu
dents) and a judge (the Interim Judicial Body)
appointed by the same person (the president
of the University), who is not answerable in
anyway to the constituency (the students).
The administration has no right to expect
students to trust it if it does not trust the students
itself.
Several things are uregntly needed. First, if
LASSU is determined not to recognize the IJB
bcause it has no students on it, then LASSU
must try to replace it with another appeals
board.

It must remember, in doing this, that any
new appeals board will need the Administra
tion's recognition to function at all in cases in
volving the dean of students. This is one of the
facts of ASSU life here.
Second, LASSU must clear up ambiguities in
the by-laws about whether Judicial Council
should try cases of University policy violations
which are not Fundamental Standard violations.
It is not enough for Judicial Council to say
it will simply not try these cases but will leave
them completely to the dean of students. Such
a decision is an interpretation of the by-laws,
and is the prerogative of the legislature.
Third, it should be made clear to Judicial
Council that refusing to try the demonstrators'
cases was a dangerous precedent. It denied the
authority of the IJB before LASSU had a chance
to write the IJB out of the by-laws.
By doing so, the Council assumed much more
authority than the ASSU Constitution and By-
Laws allow it. If the members of the council
in the future feel they cannot reconcile their
prson&l morals with this system of laws, then
they ought to resign.
Fourth, the ASSU should be reluctant to give
up jurisdiction over cases of University policy
violations which may not be Fundamental Stan
dard violations.
The right of exclusive original jurisdiction was
gained only after long, difficult negotiations two
years ago. It gives students the right always to
be tried by students. This right should not be
forfeited willingly.
Finally, we must again demand that the ad
ministration stop treating students like children.
If they think students behave like children,
they should remember that people who are re
garded as children sometimes tend to act that
way. And this applies as much to people over
30 as to students.
The time to start building mutual respect and
good faith between students and administrators
is now. —C.H.

The right of exclusive original jurisdiction was
gained only after long, difficult negotiations two
years ago. It gives students the right always to
be tried by students. This right should not be
forfeited willingly.
Finally, we must again demand that the ad
ministration stop treating students like children.
If they think students behave like children,
they should remember that people who are re
garded as children sometimes tend to act that
way. And this applies as much to people over
30 as to students.

The state of the student judicial system is a
mess.
The Judicial Council is saying it will not try
violations of University policy except as viola
tions of the Fundamental Standard. And the
interpretation of the Fundamental Standard
seems to change from case to case.
The ASSU legislature refuses to recognize
any appals board over the Judicial Council that
docs not have students on it. And the administra
tion will never give up the privilege of final
say in student disciplinary matters.
The dean of students, always a man to enforce
University policy conscientiously, will take his
cases to the all-faculty Interim Judicial Body
if not to the all-student Judicial Council.
The root of the problem is mistrust on both
sides Students want the right to be heard by
their peers. The administration, on the other
hand, wants to make sure infractions of their
rules are punished and are not sure students can
be trusted to do it.
What the administration really wants is to
be reasonably sure the students on a student
faculty board would not be responsive to stu
dent's political interests.
Regardless of intention, this attitude is an
insult to the integrity of the student leadership.
Moreover, it makes the administration's attitude
inconsistent.
The administration does not seem to have
questioned whether it is wise, not to say demo
cratic, to have a prosecuter (the dean of stu
dents) and a judge (the Interim Judicial Body)
appointed by the same person (the president
of the University), who is not answerable in
anyway to the constituency (the students).
The administration has no right to expect
students to trust it if it does not trust the students
itself.
Several things are uregntly needed. First, if
LASSU is determined not to recognize the IJB
bcause it has no students on it, then LASSU
must try to replace it with another appeals
board.

It must remember, in doing this, that any
new appeals board will need the Administra
tion's recognition to function at all in cases in
volving the dean of students. This is one of the
facts of ASSU life here.
Second, LASSU must clear up ambiguities in
the by-laws about whether Judicial Council
should try cases of University policy violations
which are not Fundamental Standard violations.
It is not enough for Judicial Council to say
it will simply not try these cases but will leave
them completely to the dean of students. Such
a decision is an interpretation of the by-laws,
and is the prerogative of the legislature.
Third, it should be made clear to Judicial
Council that refusing to try the demonstrators'
cases was a dangerous precedent. It denied the
authority of the IJB before LASSU had a chance
to write the IJB out of the by-laws.
By doing so, the Council assumed much more
authority than the ASSU Constitution and By-
Laws allow it. If the members of the council
in the future feel they cannot reconcile their
prson&l morals with this system of laws, then
they ought to resign.
Fourth, the ASSU should be reluctant to give
up jurisdiction over cases of University policy
violations which may not be Fundamental Stan
dard violations.
