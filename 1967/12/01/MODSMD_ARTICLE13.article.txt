# Making Dissent Work
## 
### 
Many groups at Stanford have organized to
oppose the Vietnam War and during this fall,
more and more have become disillusioned. Im
potency is the source of the frustration.
But among the groups are some now very
optimistic. Those who have the best chance to
do something about the war are those concen
trating on the political realities of the American
scene.
Among the groups is the Conference of Con
cerned Democrats which was cheered last night
by Senator McCarthy's announcement that he
will enter several Democratic primaries
The group is the heir to the "Dump Johnson"
activity during the past year. It is a grass roots
movement and recognizes the only way to alter
American foreign policy toward Vietnam.
Some other groups are making their dissent
work on campus through political involvement.
One supports the candidacy of Paul McCloskey,
a dove, for California's 11th Congressional Seat.
McCloskey's victory in the primary has shown
the political strength of the anti-war position.

The San Mateo election itself is a tribute
to anti-war political action, for McCloskey's op
ponent, Ray Archibald, is certainly not hawkish.
Archibald spoke on campus Wednesday night
and McCloskey speaks here this afternoon.
Johnson's stake in the Vietnam war is so great
that there is really no hope that he will make
a reasonable compromise. Recognizing this and
that his greatest weakness is political, those who
really want to make dissent work are concen
trating their efforts on the elections next fall,
and showing that a dove can win.
If Johnson's control over the party can be
successfully contested in several primaries, it
is possible he can be defeated at the convention
or would decide to withdraw in favor of some
one, maybe Eugene McCarthy, who could bring
an end to the war.
Those who support the Dump Johnson move
ment, the candidacy of Eugene McCarthy, the
candidacy of Paul McCloskey, and the registra
tion of the Peace and Freedom Party, are making
their dissent work.
