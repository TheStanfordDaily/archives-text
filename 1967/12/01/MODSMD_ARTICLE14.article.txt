# Dead Or Alive?
## 
### 
Dead week is alive and hiding in the recesses
of the quadrangle. Campus and course activity
does not slow during this final week of the quar
ter, but quickens as professors try to cram
neglected material into the final class meetings.
The week should be free from quizes and
exams, which it too often is not, but it must be
freer still. This week required lectures and dis
cussions will continue and many labs will hold
their final sessions. Extracurricular campus ac
tivities will slow only slightly.

What this University needs is a real dead
week, a reading week without classes, labs,
physical education drills, or required discus
sions.
This would provide time for students to syn
thesize the material of the quarter and complete
and supplement their course material. It would
eliminate the extreme pressure that weighs upon
students until the start of the first examination.
To do its part, the Daily hereby suspends
publication until next quarter.
