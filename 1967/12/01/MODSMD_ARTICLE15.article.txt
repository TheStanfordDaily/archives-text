## America's Biggest Bellyache

Something about the bloated
satiation of a Thanksgiving din
ner's aftermath recalled the first
real "generational conflict" I ex
perienced.
I was very small. One evening,
I didn't finish my dinner. My
parents exhorted me to continue
gorging with the classic remark,
"Think of all the children in
China who have no food."
Apparently this thought was
supposed to trigger in me the
reaction a dog exhibits when an
other dog approaches his dinner
dish. Having human conscious
ness I was supposed to feel for
tunate, perhaps." But primarily
I was expected to gobble.
I didn't. I said, "If they need
the food, send it to them." The
food was not sent, of course. It
was thrown out. My parents
switched to other approaches to
encourage my eating which any
one viewing my corpulent form
can see were eventually success
ful.
A Touch Of Hypocrisy
Strangely, the "think of all
the kids in China . . . Send it to
them" interchange has turned
out to be the personal property
of dozens of people to whom I
have spoken. Perhaps it was in
some movie and parents across
the land tried it on their young.
Or perhaps the similarity is
simply a reflection of a dominant
trend in our society. In reality
Americans are rather like dogs
in the manger. We jealously
guard our material wealth, even
wealth we don't need. News
about people in need does not
spur us to help, much as we
would like to think it does.
Look at the box score. Ac
cording to Newsweek magazine,
"America spends $75 billion for
defense but only $7 billion on
welfare for the poor, $17.4 billion
for tobacco and liquor for cos
metics and toiletries but only
$400 million a year for the train
ing of adult unemployed."
The Ads Add Up
We spend another $16 billion
or so each year on advertising.
Much of this advertising has
only one purpose — to artificial
ly stimulate demand.
One advertising man has called
his trade the "merchandising of
discontent." We are urged to
buy things we don't need and
then to replace them with use
less successors. Things are not
made to last, or they are made
unfashionable, or they are simp
ly called "new" and "improved."
justified, along
with planned obsolescence, on
the grounds that this inflated
demand is necessary to keep in

dustry booming and people em
ployed. Yet our air becomes more
polluted, our cities rot at the
core, and millions of our citizens
live in poverty. Surely people
could be employed to tackle
those problems, and industries
could take on more activities in
the public sector.
We Need Our Luxuries!
But it would mean higher tax
es. And that would mean the citi
zen would have less money to
spend on color TV, gigantic 400-
horsepower cars, speeding tick
ets, after shave lotion, high-fash
ion clothes, cigarettes or alcohol.
And the fact is that the peo
ple are unwilling to give up these
props of modern life. Faced with
a warfare-oriented foreign pol
icy abroad and violence in our
cities at home, the average citi
zen may occassionally feel un
easy, but his elected representa
tives overwhelmingly support
the war, consider riot control im
perative, but laugh at rat con
trol. i
Conservatives, in fact, are fair
ly open on this dimension. What
they want is more for the haves
and to hell with the have-nots.
If the have-nots get out of line,
we strengthen the police. If the
University gets out of line, we
threaten the budget. If some
Vietnamese have a non-capitalist
revolution, we crush it. The key
is to keep what's ours—to gob
ble at the dinner dish.
And that is where we pamper
ed children of our conservative
parents differ. While we do not
take vows of poverty, or starve
ourselves to give to others, we do
realize that our needs are not
endless. If we are full, we are
full. Our psychology is different.
This is where the real conflict,
both between the generations
and along liberal-conservative
lines, lies. Are we willing to
give? Are we willing to wrench
our heads out of our dinner dish
es and look around us at a
world, and a non-white America,
in need? Happy holidays. Don't
eat too much for Christmas din
ner.
