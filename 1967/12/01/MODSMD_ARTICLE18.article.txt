# Law School: Teach Theory Or Practice?
## 
### 
The Stanford School of Law
is trying to orient the study of
flaw more toward the "real"
world outside the University.
But a sampling of law stu
dents questioned by The Daily
criticized the School for its em
phasis on law theory and its
dearth of courses on the practi
cal workings of the law.
Richard Zimmerman, a sec
ond-year student, said the social
science approach to the law that
Bayless Manning, dean of the
School, emphasizes, really has
not spread too widely in law
classes. "Most are still taught
along the older legalistic ap
proach," he said.
Zimmerman dislikes the pros
pect of cutting the law school
attendance period to two years.
He believes the shorter time
would not provide the student
with enough training to make
him a good lawyer.
Rational Thinking
"I like the approach to ra
tional thinking in the school,"
Zimmerman told The Dally. "It
develops to a great extent the
analytical powers."
Third-year student Alan Men
del deplored the School's "de
emphasis of the workings of the
law."
"You don't get near a court
room," he said. "I'd like to see
a few more courses in actual
trial practice."

Mendel said he did feel that
"the type of logical analysis
you're forced to use in the law
will be most helpful no matter
what you go into. You've got to
learn to cut through all the
wordage given you and get to
the meaning."
Assistant to the Dean David
Lelewer graduated from the
School last spring. He told The
Daily that the move toward
using more social science tech
niques in the study of law was
due to the faculty.
"The vigorous, active faculty
has brought about the changes,"
he said. Lelewer said the School
has "an exciting environment"
and is not "cruelly competitive."
Demands Preparation
The work in the School de
mands a lot of preparation on
the part of the student, accord
ing to Lelewer. "But you do it
because you want to," he said.
Lelewer said he believed that
the Stanford legal education was
relevant to what goes on out
side the University. "You learn
things from your teachers that
are not written in the casebooks,
and this makes legal education
immediately relevant," the as
sistant to the dean said.
"Things become immediate,
not strictly academic," he said.
Lelewer, in charge of student
activities, pointed out that "vir

tually every student" is involved
in one of the student organiza
tions which deal with practical
legal problems. The school, Le
lewer said, spends "tens of thou
sands of dollars" for student
facilities and activities.
Lelewer credits the highly ac
cessible faculty as a prime ele
ment in the "excitment" of the
School. "The faculty tends to
communicate to the students the
spirit of a shared joint venture
in the study of law," he said.
The assistant to the dean does
not believe that activism among
the students has forced the
changes that are taking place
in the school.
But there does seem to be a
different feeling among today's
students than past ones. "The
students want to get involved
in the activities right away," Le
lewer observed.
Leave Their Hearts
According to him, the law
students are very concerned
about the society around them.
"When they go out with their
degrees, they may not all be
come lawyers for the indigent,
but they're not going to leave
their hearts behind them," Le
lewer said.
He told The Dally that to a
large extent the law student's
entire life is oriented around
the school. Student organizations

stage social events, and faculty
members frequently attend.
Law students, according to
Lelewer, tend to date Stanford
undergraduate women. More
than twenty students serve as
resident assistants in Stanford
student residences.
"One problem in attracting
qualified Negro students to the
school," Lelewer pointed out,
"is that Stanford has the repu
tation of being lilly-white, and
the minority group men don't
think there'll be undergrad wom
en to take out."
First-year student Terrance
Adlock said he disliked the
large classes that one encoun
ters in the first year. He blames
the large classes of between 70
and 80 students on the smallness
of the faculty.
Dislikes Casework
"We don't get near these
guys," Adlock complained, "but
the professors are astoundingly
good." He said he does not like
the casebook method of instruc
tion which still prevails but con
ceded that with so small a fac
ulty it was necessary.
According to Adlock, however,
each first-year student does have
a small section of about 20 stu
dents in one of the four required
courses. "You get to know the
small section professor fairly
well, and he knows who you
are," he said.

Unlike most undergraduate
courses, law school courses have
no midterm exams, Adlock said.
Everything depends on the final
and on a few writing assign
ments given in the small section.
Karen Tustin, a third-year stu
dent who was a Stanford under
graduate, felt there really has
been no advantage or disadvan
tage resulting from her doing

her law work at the same uni
versity as her undergraduate
work.
Mrs. Tustin said she "rather
enjoyed" being one of the 24
women in the School of Law.
There are 406 men in the school
this semester.
Dan Kiely, a second-year stu
dent, said that there was still
"a trial by fear in the class

room," testing who was well
prepared on the material and
who had thought out the cases
to be studied.

immediately relevant," the as
sistant to the dean said.
"Things become immediate,
not strictly academic," he said.
Lelewer, in charge of student
activities, pointed out that "vir

tually every student" is involved
in one of the student organiza
tions which deal with practical
legal problems. The school, Le
lewer said, spends "tens of thou
sands of dollars" for student
facilities and activities.
Lelewer credits the highly ac
cessible faculty as a prime ele
ment in the "excitment" of the
School. "The faculty tends to
communicate to the students the
spirit of a shared joint venture
in the study of law," he said.
The assistant to the dean does
not believe that activism among
the students has forced the
changes that are taking place
in the school.
But there does seem to be a
different feeling among today's
students than past ones. "The
students want to get involved
in the activities right away," Le
lewer observed.
Leave Their Hearts
According to him, the law
students are very concerned
about the society around them.
"When they go out with their
degrees, they may not all be
come lawyers for the indigent,
but they're not going to leave
their hearts behind them," Le
lewer said.
He told The Dally that to a
large extent the law student's
entire life is oriented around
the school. Student organizations

stage social events, and faculty
members frequently attend.
Law students, according to
Lelewer, tend to date Stanford
undergraduate women. More
than twenty students serve as
resident assistants in Stanford
student residences.
"One problem in attracting
qualified Negro students to the
school," Lelewer pointed out,
"is that Stanford has the repu
tation of being lilly-white, and
the minority group men don't
think there'll be undergrad wom
en to take out."
First-year student Terrance
Adlock said he disliked the
large classes that one encoun
ters in the first year. He blames
the large classes of between 70
and 80 students on the smallness
of the faculty.
Dislikes Casework
"We don't get near these
guys," Adlock complained, "but
the professors are astoundingly
good." He said he does not like
the casebook method of instruc
tion which still prevails but con
ceded that with so small a fac
ulty it was necessary.
According to Adlock, however,
each first-year student does have
a small section of about 20 stu
dents in one of the four required
courses. "You get to know the
small section professor fairly
well, and he knows who you
are," he said.

Unlike most undergraduate
courses, law school courses have
no midterm exams, Adlock said.
Everything depends on the final
and on a few writing assign
ments given in the small section.
Karen Tustin, a third-year stu
dent who was a Stanford under
graduate, felt there really has
been no advantage or disadvan
tage resulting from her doing

her law work at the same uni
versity as her undergraduate
work.
Mrs. Tustin said she "rather
enjoyed" being one of the 24
women in the School of Law.
There are 406 men in the school
this semester.
Dan Kiely, a second-year stu
dent, said that there was still
"a trial by fear in the class

room," testing who was well
prepared on the material and
who had thought out the cases
to be studied.
The Stanford School of Law
is trying to orient the study of
flaw more toward the "real"
world outside the University.
But a sampling of law stu
dents questioned by The Daily
criticized the School for its em
phasis on law theory and its
dearth of courses on the practi
cal workings of the law.
Richard Zimmerman, a sec
ond-year student, said the social
science approach to the law that
Bayless Manning, dean of the
School, emphasizes, really has
not spread too widely in law
classes. "Most are still taught
along the older legalistic ap
proach," he said.
Zimmerman dislikes the pros
pect of cutting the law school
attendance period to two years.
He believes the shorter time
would not provide the student
with enough training to make
him a good lawyer.
Rational Thinking
"I like the approach to ra
tional thinking in the school,"
Zimmerman told The Dally. "It
develops to a great extent the
analytical powers."
Third-year student Alan Men
del deplored the School's "de
emphasis of the workings of the
law."
"You don't get near a court
room," he said. "I'd like to see
a few more courses in actual
trial practice."

Mendel said he did feel that
"the type of logical analysis
you're forced to use in the law
will be most helpful no matter
what you go into. You've got to
learn to cut through all the
wordage given you and get to
the meaning."
Assistant to the Dean David
Lelewer graduated from the
School last spring. He told The
Daily that the move toward

"The vigorous, active faculty

he said. Lelewer said the School
has "an exciting environment"
and is not "cruelly competitive."

the casebook method of instruc
tion which still prevails but con
ceded that with so small a fac
ulty it was necessary.
According to Adlock, however,
each first-year student does have
a small section of about 20 stu
dents in one of the four required
courses. "You get to know the
small section professor fairly
well, and he knows who you
are," he said.

Unlike most undergraduate
courses, law school courses have
no midterm exams, Adlock said.
Everything depends on the final
and on a few writing assign

Karen Tustin, a third-year stu
dent who was a Stanford under
graduate, felt there really has
been no advantage or disadvan
tage resulting from her doing

her law work at the same uni
versity as her undergraduate
work.
Mrs. Tustin said she "rather
enjoyed" being one of the 24
women in the School of Law.
There are 406 men in the school
this semester.
Dan Kiely, a second-year stu
dent, said that there was still
"a trial by fear in the class

room," testing who was well
prepared on the material and
who had thought out the cases
to be studied.
The Stanford School of Law
is trying to orient the study of
flaw more toward the "real"
world outside the University.
But a sampling of law stu
dents questioned by The Daily
criticized the School for its em
phasis on law theory and its
dearth of courses on the practi
cal workings of the law.
Richard Zimmerman, a sec
ond-year student, said the social
science approach to the law that
Bayless Manning, dean of the
School, emphasizes, really has
not spread too widely in law
classes. "Most are still taught
along the older legalistic ap
proach," he said.
Zimmerman dislikes the pros
pect of cutting the law school
attendance period to two years.
He believes the shorter time
would not provide the student
with enough training to make
him a good lawyer.
Rational Thinking
"I like the approach to ra
tional thinking in the school,"
Zimmerman told The Dally. "It
develops to a great extent the
analytical powers."
Third-year student Alan Men
del deplored the School's "de
emphasis of the workings of the
law."
"You don't get near a court
room," he said. "I'd like to see
a few more courses in actual
trial practice."

Mendel said he did feel that
"the type of logical analysis
you're forced to use in the law
will be most helpful no matter
what you go into. You've got to
learn to cut through all the
wordage given you and get to
the meaning."
Assistant to the Dean David
Lelewer graduated from the
School last spring. He told The
Daily that the move toward
using more social science tech
niques in the study of law was
due to the faculty.
"The vigorous, active faculty
has brought about the changes,"
he said. Lelewer said the School
has "an exciting environment"
and is not "cruelly competitive."
Demands Preparation
The work in the School de
mands a lot of preparation on
the part of the student, accord
ing to Lelewer. "But you do it
because you want to," he said.
Lelewer said he believed that
the Stanford legal education was
relevant to what goes on out
side the University. "You learn
things from your teachers that
are not written in the casebooks,
and this makes legal education
immediately relevant," the as
sistant to the dean said.
"Things become immediate,
not strictly academic," he said.
Lelewer, in charge of student
activities, pointed out that "vir

tually every student" is involved
in one of the student organiza
tions which deal with practical
legal problems. The school, Le
lewer said, spends "tens of thou
sands of dollars" for student
facilities and activities.
Lelewer credits the highly ac
cessible faculty as a prime ele
ment in the "excitment" of the
School. "The faculty tends to
communicate to the students the
spirit of a shared joint venture
in the study of law," he said.
The assistant to the dean does
not believe that activism among
the students has forced the
changes that are taking place
in the school.
But there does seem to be a
different feeling among today's
students than past ones. "The
students want to get involved
in the activities right away," Le
lewer observed.
Leave Their Hearts
According to him, the law
students are very concerned
about the society around them.
"When they go out with their
degrees, they may not all be
come lawyers for the indigent,
but they're not going to leave
their hearts behind them," Le
lewer said.
He told The Dally that to a
large extent the law student's
entire life is oriented around
the school. Student organizations

stage social events, and faculty
members frequently attend.
Law students, according to
Lelewer, tend to date Stanford
undergraduate women. More
than twenty students serve as
resident assistants in Stanford
student residences.
"One problem in attracting
qualified Negro students to the
school," Lelewer pointed out,
"is that Stanford has the repu
tation of being lilly-white, and
the minority group men don't
think there'll be undergrad wom
en to take out."
First-year student Terrance
Adlock said he disliked the
large classes that one encoun
ters in the first year. He blames
the large classes of between 70
and 80 students on the smallness
of the faculty.
Dislikes Casework
"We don't get near these
guys," Adlock complained, "but
the professors are astoundingly
good." He said he does not like
