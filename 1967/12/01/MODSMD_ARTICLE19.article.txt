# Letters To The Editor
## Violent For Frustration's Sake 
### 
Editor, the Dally:
Harvey Hukari, you make a
great mistake when you allow
the violence of certain demon
strators and that of Hitler's
brownshirts to merge in your
mind. Today's violent protests
are born of intense frustration
with the existing political mech
anisms for change; not because
change is impossible but because
it is so criminally slow.
We look about us at the hor
ror of Vietnam, at Negro chil
dren being brought up with rats
in our cities' ghettos, at General
Hershey sending our brothers
into involuntary servitude; and
we say to ourselves,
"In fifty years, under the 'dem
ocratic' system, maybe things
will be different." But fifty years
or a "maybe" are not good
enough.
Before the recent San Mateo
elections, I said to Edward Keat
ing, "I'm not old enough to vote
now, but wait a few years, and,
then, I'll vote for you." He re
plied, "I can't wait." Our time
Is running out. What we don't
deal with today will be even
more formidable tomorrow.
Violence for the sake of vio
lence is a travesty not only of
the law, but of the morality we
are trying to implement. But
this is not non-violent, civil dis
obedience. There is nothing "self
righteous" about those who sat
in and were arrested in Oakland
on October 16th.
They were religiously follow
ing the dictates of their con
sciences. Furthermore, to com
pare all this with the brutal anti
morality of Nazi Germany, with
the burning of books, the slaugh
tering of Jews is incredible.
You say that "Fascism . . . ex
hibited a concern for the work
ing man that would warm the
heart of Walter Reuther; and,
yet, you neglect to mention the
ruthless suppression of work
ers' demonstrations before the
war, the lack of any collective
bargaining.
You slender American radi
cals who, you say, are "intent on
subjecting the populus to a mass
average," but offer no evidence
to support this accusation. Radi
cals are in the finest American
tradition in their attempts to
restore liberal and humanitarian
traditions. You might even call
them conservative.
Finally, Harvey, the C.I.A. pro
test was not a "political panty
raid," but a display of moral
courage at that organization's
insidious interference in student
affairs (and world affairs).
I hope I've cleared things up
for you.

Editor, the Dally:
Stanford Uuiversity has a very
sad image in the surrounding
Black Communities. We, the con

cerned Black students of Stan
ford, are readily pointing out
the areas where real, positive
change must come about. We
are aware of the problem areas;
committed to a philosophy which
we feel will solve these prob
lems; and are now connected
in the implementation of differ
ent solutions. Though sometimes
hard to find, we do seek and de
sire sincere cooperation.
In one of our programs this
fall the cooperation received
from Mr. Chuck Taylor, Mr.
Bob Young and Mr. Pete Keme
tovich was that "realistic type"
action which we feel may per
haps offer a saving grace for the
Black and White communities.
There is no doubt in my mind
and those of the many Black
kids that participated in our
programs that the Stanford Ath
letic Department has taken a
leading role in bringing the
'realities of American society
more in line with the ideals of a
democratic form of government.

• Soccer's Problems
Editor, the Daily:
.... My opinion is that soc
cer at Stanford should receive
adequate help from the Athlet
ic Department simply because
there are a great number of
students interested in it. This
interest has been shown repea
tedly by the fact that during
some quarters there have been
between eighty and ninety peo
ple signed up. They come from
the most representative and
most often forgotten group of
Stanford's student body. They
want to play because soccer is
an excellent team sport and be
cause it is fun.
Among the participants, let us
not forget the many Stanford
foreign students for whom soc
cer is the sport they know and
enjoy best. Consequently, it is
very difficult to see why there
are no adequate fields, and why
the present coach has not been
given, over the years, sufficient
help to run a program which

welcomes everyone wishing to
play soccer. This is my opinion
and this is all Nick need have
said if his purpose had been to
help the sport.
.... Soccer is a budding sport
in the U.S. It needs all the en
couragement it can get; it needs
old coaches, new coaches, the
Athletic Department, and any
one willing to help put it in a
better position.
Nick mentions the many win
ning seasons as suggesting the
soundness of the soccer program
at Stanford. This may be so; ex
perienced foreign student play
ers may be. Furthermore, while
winning alone may be impor
tant to other sports, it is not so
immensely important to the
Stanford student who wants to
play soccer. He wants the oppor
tunity to participate in a team
sport just for fun. If facilities
and opportunity are available to
him, the soccer program will
be a success.
During the last year, Ray
Hess, Peter Thace and I re
quested in writing coaching help
and better fields to the Athletic
Department. These requests
were never answered. Had they
been, perhaps the useless char
ges by recent emotional letter
writers who speak without even
a feint attempt to find out the
facts could have been avoided.
Clearly, negative publicity is not
desirable for soccer or the Ath
letic Department.

• Soccer's Problems
Editor, the Daily:
.... My opinion is that soc
cer at Stanford should receive
adequate help from the Athlet
ic Department simply because
there are a great number of
students interested in it. This
interest has been shown repea
tedly by the fact that during
some quarters there have been
between eighty and ninety peo
ple signed up. They come from
the most representative and
most often forgotten group of
Stanford's student body. They
want to play because soccer is
an excellent team sport and be
cause it is fun.
Among the participants, let us
not forget the many Stanford
foreign students for whom soc
cer is the sport they know and
enjoy best. Consequently, it is
very difficult to see why there
are no adequate fields, and why
the present coach has not been
given, over the years, sufficient
help to run a program which

welcomes everyone wishing to
play soccer. This is my opinion
and this is all Nick need have
said if his purpose had been to
help the sport.
.... Soccer is a budding sport
in the U.S. It needs all the en
couragement it can get; it needs
old coaches, new coaches, the
Athletic Department, and any
one willing to help put it in a
better position.
Nick mentions the many win
ning seasons as suggesting the
soundness of the soccer program
at Stanford. This may be so; ex
perienced foreign student play
ers may be. Furthermore, while
winning alone may be impor
tant to other sports, it is not so
immensely important to the
Stanford student who wants to
play soccer. He wants the oppor
tunity to participate in a team
sport just for fun. If facilities
and opportunity are available to
him, the soccer program will
be a success.
During the last year, Ray
Hess, Peter Thace and I re
quested in writing coaching help
and better fields to the Athletic
Department. These requests
were never answered. Had they
been, perhaps the useless char
ges by recent emotional letter
writers who speak without even
a feint attempt to find out the
facts could have been avoided.
Clearly, negative publicity is not
desirable for soccer or the Ath
letic Department.

Editor, the Dally:
Harvey Hukari, you make a
great mistake when you allow
the violence of certain demon
strators and that of Hitler's
brownshirts to merge in your
mind. Today's violent protests
are born of intense frustration
with the existing political mech
anisms for change; not because
change is impossible but because
it is so criminally slow.
We look about us at the hor
ror of Vietnam, at Negro chil
dren being brought up with rats
in our cities' ghettos, at General
Hershey sending our brothers
into involuntary servitude; and
we say to ourselves,
"In fifty years, under the 'dem
ocratic' system, maybe things
will be different." But fifty years
or a "maybe" are not good
enough.
Before the recent San Mateo
elections, I said to Edward Keat
ing, "I'm not old enough to vote
now, but wait a few years, and,
then, I'll vote for you." He re
plied, "I can't wait." Our time
Is running out. What we don't
deal with today will be even
more formidable tomorrow.
Violence for the sake of vio
lence is a travesty not only of
the law, but of the morality we
are trying to implement. But
this is not non-violent, civil dis
obedience. There is nothing "self
righteous" about those who sat
in and were arrested in Oakland
on October 16th.
They were religiously follow
ing the dictates of their con
sciences. Furthermore, to com
pare all this with the brutal anti
morality of Nazi Germany, with
the burning of books, the slaugh
tering of Jews is incredible.
You say that "Fascism . . . ex
hibited a concern for the work
ing man that would warm the
heart of Walter Reuther; and,
yet, you neglect to mention the
ruthless suppression of work
ers' demonstrations before the
war, the lack of any collective
bargaining.
You slender American radi
cals who, you say, are "intent on
subjecting the populus to a mass
average," but offer no evidence
to support this accusation. Radi
cals are in the finest American
tradition in their attempts to
restore liberal and humanitarian
traditions. You might even call
them conservative.
Finally, Harvey, the C.I.A. pro
test was not a "political panty
raid," but a display of moral
courage at that organization's
insidious interference in student
affairs (and world affairs).
I hope I've cleared things up
for you.

Stanford Uuiversity has a very
sad image in the surrounding
Black Communities. We, the con

cerned Black students of Stan
ford, are readily pointing out
the areas where real, positive
change must come about. We
are aware of the problem areas;
committed to a philosophy which
we feel will solve these prob
lems; and are now connected
in the implementation of differ
ent solutions. Though sometimes
hard to find, we do seek and de
sire sincere cooperation.
In one of our programs this
fall the cooperation received
from Mr. Chuck Taylor, Mr.
Bob Young and Mr. Pete Keme
tovich was that "realistic type"
action which we feel may per
haps offer a saving grace for the
Black and White communities.
There is no doubt in my mind

programs that the Stanford Ath

Stanford Uuiversity has a very
sad image in the surrounding
Black Communities. We, the con

cerned Black students of Stan
ford, are readily pointing out
the areas where real, positive
change must come about. We
are aware of the problem areas;
committed to a philosophy which
we feel will solve these prob
lems; and are now connected
in the implementation of differ
ent solutions. Though sometimes
hard to find, we do seek and de
sire sincere cooperation.
In one of our programs this
fall the cooperation received
from Mr. Chuck Taylor, Mr.
Bob Young and Mr. Pete Keme
tovich was that "realistic type"
action which we feel may per
haps offer a saving grace for the
Black and White communities.
There is no doubt in my mind
and those of the many Black
kids that participated in our
programs that the Stanford Ath
letic Department has taken a
leading role in bringing the
'realities of American society
more in line with the ideals of a
democratic form of government.

• Soccer's Problems
Editor, the Daily:
.... My opinion is that soc
cer at Stanford should receive
adequate help from the Athlet
ic Department simply because
there are a great number of
students interested in it. This
interest has been shown repea
tedly by the fact that during
some quarters there have been
between eighty and ninety peo
ple signed up. They come from
the most representative and
most often forgotten group of
Stanford's student body. They
want to play because soccer is
an excellent team sport and be
cause it is fun.
Among the participants, let us
not forget the many Stanford
foreign students for whom soc
cer is the sport they know and
enjoy best. Consequently, it is
very difficult to see why there
are no adequate fields, and why
the present coach has not been
given, over the years, sufficient
help to run a program which

welcomes everyone wishing to
play soccer. This is my opinion
and this is all Nick need have
said if his purpose had been to
help the sport.
.... Soccer is a budding sport
in the U.S. It needs all the en
couragement it can get; it needs
old coaches, new coaches, the
Athletic Department, and any
one willing to help put it in a
better position.
Nick mentions the many win
ning seasons as suggesting the
soundness of the soccer program
at Stanford. This may be so; ex
perienced foreign student play
ers may be. Furthermore, while
winning alone may be impor
tant to other sports, it is not so
immensely important to the
Stanford student who wants to
play soccer. He wants the oppor
tunity to participate in a team
sport just for fun. If facilities
and opportunity are available to
him, the soccer program will
be a success.
During the last year, Ray
Hess, Peter Thace and I re
quested in writing coaching help
and better fields to the Athletic
Department. These requests
were never answered. Had they
been, perhaps the useless char
ges by recent emotional letter
writers who speak without even
a feint attempt to find out the
facts could have been avoided.
Clearly, negative publicity is not
desirable for soccer or the Ath
letic Department.

want to play because soccer is
an excellent team sport and be
cause it is fun.
Among the participants, let us
not forget the many Stanford
foreign students for whom soc
cer is the sport they know and
enjoy best. Consequently, it is
very difficult to see why there
are no adequate fields, and why
the present coach has not been
given, over the years, sufficient
help to run a program which

welcomes everyone wishing to
play soccer. This is my opinion
and this is all Nick need have
said if his purpose had been to
help the sport.
.... Soccer is a budding sport
in the U.S. It needs all the en
couragement it can get; it needs
old coaches, new coaches, the
Athletic Department, and any
one willing to help put it in a
better position.
Nick mentions the many win
ning seasons as suggesting the
soundness of the soccer program
at Stanford. This may be so; ex
perienced foreign student play
ers may be. Furthermore, while
winning alone may be impor
tant to other sports, it is not so
immensely important to the
Stanford student who wants to
play soccer. He wants the oppor
tunity to participate in a team
sport just for fun. If facilities
and opportunity are available to
him, the soccer program will
be a success.
During the last year, Ray
Hess, Peter Thace and I re
quested in writing coaching help
and better fields to the Athletic
Department. These requests
were never answered. Had they
been, perhaps the useless char
ges by recent emotional letter
writers who speak without even
a feint attempt to find out the
facts could have been avoided.
Clearly, negative publicity is not
desirable for soccer or the Ath
letic Department.

Editor, the Dally:
Harvey Hukari, you make a
great mistake when you allow
the violence of certain demon
strators and that of Hitler's
brownshirts to merge in your
mind. Today's violent protests
are born of intense frustration
with the existing political mech
anisms for change; not because
change is impossible but because
it is so criminally slow.
We look about us at the hor
ror of Vietnam, at Negro chil
dren being brought up with rats
in our cities' ghettos, at General
Hershey sending our brothers
into involuntary servitude; and
we say to ourselves,
"In fifty years, under the 'dem
ocratic' system, maybe things
will be different." But fifty years
or a "maybe" are not good
enough.
Before the recent San Mateo
elections, I said to Edward Keat
ing, "I'm not old enough to vote
now, but wait a few years, and,
then, I'll vote for you." He re
plied, "I can't wait." Our time
Is running out. What we don't
deal with today will be even
more formidable tomorrow.
Violence for the sake of vio
lence is a travesty not only of
the law, but of the morality we
are trying to implement. But
this is not non-violent, civil dis
obedience. There is nothing "self
righteous" about those who sat
in and were arrested in Oakland
on October 16th.
They were religiously follow
ing the dictates of their con
sciences. Furthermore, to com
pare all this with the brutal anti
morality of Nazi Germany, with
the burning of books, the slaugh
tering of Jews is incredible.
You say that "Fascism . . . ex
hibited a concern for the work
ing man that would warm the
heart of Walter Reuther; and,
yet, you neglect to mention the
ruthless suppression of work
ers' demonstrations before the
war, the lack of any collective
bargaining.
You slender American radi
cals who, you say, are "intent on
subjecting the populus to a mass
average," but offer no evidence
to support this accusation. Radi
cals are in the finest American
tradition in their attempts to
restore liberal and humanitarian
traditions. You might even call
them conservative.
Finally, Harvey, the C.I.A. pro
test was not a "political panty
raid," but a display of moral
courage at that organization's
insidious interference in student
affairs (and world affairs).
I hope I've cleared things up
for you.

Editor, the Dally:
Stanford Uuiversity has a very
sad image in the surrounding
Black Communities. We, the con

cerned Black students of Stan
ford, are readily pointing out
the areas where real, positive
change must come about. We
are aware of the problem areas;
committed to a philosophy which
we feel will solve these prob
lems; and are now connected
in the implementation of differ
ent solutions. Though sometimes
hard to find, we do seek and de
sire sincere cooperation.
In one of our programs this
fall the cooperation received
from Mr. Chuck Taylor, Mr.
Bob Young and Mr. Pete Keme
tovich was that "realistic type"
action which we feel may per
haps offer a saving grace for the
Black and White communities.
There is no doubt in my mind
and those of the many Black
kids that participated in our
programs that the Stanford Ath
letic Department has taken a
leading role in bringing the
'realities of American society
more in line with the ideals of a
democratic form of government.

.... My opinion is that soc
