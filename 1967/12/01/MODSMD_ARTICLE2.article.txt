# Campus Military Recruiting Blasted By Stanford AA UP
## 
### 
A faculty organization yester
day asked President Wallace
Sterling to ban all military re
cruiting from campus.
The Stanford chapter of the
American Association of Uni
versity Professors (AAUP)
voted "overwhelmingly" to x-e
-quest the prohibition at a meet
ing Wednesday, according to
chapter president William A.
Clebsch, professor of religion.
Columbia University denied
its facilities to military recruit
ers Nov. 21 in response to a
letter to draft boards from
Lieut. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey,
Selective Service director, who
recommended students who in
terfere with military recruiting
be denied their draft defer
ments.
The resolution passed by the
Stanford AAUP "takes issue"
with the Hershey directive be
cause it suggests "service in the
armed forces of the United
States should be used as a pun
ishment for law violation."
Recruiting at Stanford should

be banned, the resolution asks
Sterling, "so long as the Her
shey directive remains in ef
fect."
Clebsch said the resolution
showed "We are for academic
freedom for students as well as
faculty."
In a related action, the Exec
utive Committee of the faculty's
Academic Council sent a recom
mendation Tuesday to the Uni
versity on military recruiting.
Prof. Kenneth J. Arrow, chair
man of the Executive Commit
tee, declined to reveal the con
tent of .the recommendation. It
was sent to the University Com
mittee on Selective Service,
chaired by Dean of Students
Joel Smith.
The AAUP chapter, open to
all teaching faculty, has 400
Stanford members. About 50
attended the meeting Wednes
day.
Service Not Punishment
The chapter passed this reso
lution:
"The Stanford chapter of the
AAUP does not agree with the

view that service in the armed
should be used as a punish
ment for law violation. It there
fore takes issue with the letter
of Oct. 26, 1967, sent to all mem
bers of the Selective Service
system by Lt. Gen. Lewis B.
Hershey, Director of Selective
Service, recommending that vio
lators of the Selective Service
law be punished by reclassifica
tion and induction. It therefore
urges that Stanford University
cease to provide facilities on the
Stanford campus for recruiting
officers of the armed forces so

forces of the United States
long as the Hershey directive
remains in effect."
Philosophy Prof. John L.
Mothershead introduced the res
olution.
The chapter voted on the mil
itary recruiting measure after
a panel discussion with Dean of
Students Smith and Religion
Prof. Robert McAfee Brown.
Smith described possible actions
to change the current draft law,
which has been repeatedly criti
cized by University officials for
its impact on graduate students.
