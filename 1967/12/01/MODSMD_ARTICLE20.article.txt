# Peace And Freedom Seeks Voters
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
The Peace and Freedom Party
has obtained one-third of the
registrations required to place
it on the 1968 Presidential bal
lot.
A new party in California
must obtain the registrations of
1 per cent of the voters in the
last election (67,000) in order to
run a candidate in 1968.
The mid-peninsula branch of
the party has registered 2000
new members for the party out
of a quota of 8000. The Stanford
chapter has registered 650 out
of the 2000.
The party will conclude its
drive to get the required num
ber of registered voters with a
month-long push in December.
The campaign in December
will be oriented around getting

voters who are interested in the
party but are not bothering to
register because of lack of mo
tivation.
Plans for the December drive
were discussed at the Stanford
chapter's weekly meeting in
Tresidder, Tuesday night. The
group, headed by Carl Simpson,
a graduate student in Sociology,
plans to push for registrations
in the faculty residential area of
Pine Hill.
The meeting decided that the
faculty would be fertile ground
for a mass push to obtain regis
trations.
Registration Problems
The problem for the party's
registrars in San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties has been
not the lack of potential regis
trants but rather the traditional

fragmentation of local peace
groups and their wariness of
prostituting themselves by enter
ing into unpure politics.
The drive has also been com
plicated by the San Mateo con
gressional election. Many of the
people who could have been
working for the Peace and Free
dom Party have been devoting
themselves to getting one or an
other of the candidates elected.
The party's San Mateo branch
meeting was held last night to
decide if the party should enter
into the congressional race by
supporting one of the party's
members, Will Rodgers Slocum,
who is running as a write-in can
didate for Congress.
Richard White, a pediatrician
at the Stanford Medical Center
and head of the mid-peninsula

branch of the party, said that
one of the possible reasons for
supporting Slocum would be to
show people in the county that
write-in campaigns are not feas
ible and that candidates must
be supported by a valid party.
The decision to support Slo
cum as with all others made by
the party will be made by the
members of the party meeting
together, a form of participatory
democracy. If the party is suc
cessfully registered as a Califor
nia party a primary and a con
vention of the members will be
held to decide who the party
should support in 1968.
If the party does not obtain
the required 67,000 registrants,
there is some question as to
what will happen. The question
for the party in that case would
be whether to continue as an
active body for four years but
not as a legal party, or to dis
band and try again in two or
four years to become a party.
Party's Founding
The party was founded last
July at a convention in Los An
geles with two major goals: the
founding of a third party which
"would be a vehicle for the po
litical expression of the aspira
tions and goals of the new and
growing movements for basic
political, economic, and social
change in this country. This will
permit not only a meaningful
choice in the coming elections
but will strengthen and unify
the new movement."
The party's second goal is to
present to the people of Califor
nia the issue of third parties
and the relevance of the choices
offered by the two major par
ties.
That original convention de
cided to try each of the two
methods for getting a new par
ty on the ballot. The two meth
ods are obtaining a petition
signed by ten per cent of the
state's voters saying they would
like to see the party on the bal
lot, or registering one per cent
of the voters in the state as
members of the party.
After a trial period of two
months it was decided by a sec
ond statewide meeting of the
party that the registration meth
od would be more effective. The

meeting voted unanimously to
stop all attempts to obtain sig
natures for the petition and to
concentrate all efforts on the
registration drive.
Another statewide meeting is
being held this Sunday at the
Hilton Inn at the San Francisco
Airport. According to Peter Do
linger, the Stanford group's
communication director and a
graduate student in biology, the
meeting is being held "to fur
ther the campaign in previously
untouched areas â€” like Los An
geles."
The party is emphasizing in
its literature that any person
eligible to vote in California can
register in the party until De
cember 31 then switch his regis
tration back to the Democratic
or Republican parties in order
to vote for peace candidates in
primaries. The party need
have 67,000 registrations as of
December 31, but may have as
few as 5000 after the twentieth
of the year.
The party urges all people in
terested in furthering this third
party to at least register as a
member until January 20 in or
der to insure that the party is
on the ballot in November of
1968.
Registrars for San Mateo and
Santa Clara counties and repre
sentatives of the party will be
present at a table at White Me
morial Plaza tomorrow and next
Monday, Wednesday and Friday
from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. for
people interested in information
or registration in any party.
