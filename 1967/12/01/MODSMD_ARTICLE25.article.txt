# Half-Fare Travel Raises Problems
## 
### PETER BALDO 
They spend nights in airport
waiting rooms, they get strand
ed in cities like Chattanooga
and Cleveland, and they occa
sionally don't reach home until
Christmas day. Nevertheless
five per cent of the nation's air
passengers continue to travel on
cut-rate youth fare.
Under youth fare, persons
under 22 can travel for half
price on domestic flights when
coach-class seats are empty at
the time of a plane's departure.
Card Costs $3
Youth fare passengers must
present an identification card,
which is available for $3.00 at
any airline ticket office. The
card is honored throughout the
industry.
The half • fare youth standby
plan was first proposed by

American Airlines and inaugu
rated in January, 1966, to help
fill empty airplane seats and
get young people in the flying
habit. In the plan's first few
months of operation, American
Airlines reported $25 million in
additional revenue from half
fare customers.
Vacation Inconvenience
While the youth fare offers a
substantial saving to its passen
gers, students complain that it
is inconvenient at the times
they most often travel. They
have difficulty getting flights
around Thanksgiving, Christ
mas, and Easter when planes
are crowded with full-fare cus
tomers.
Military standby passengers,
who also pay half - fare, are
boarded first when seats are
empty.

One student, who paid full
fare on a flight to Phoenix last
week, explained, "I didn't want
to spend Thanksgiving in an air
port."
In addition, youth fare cus
tomers are barred from flying
entirely during certain peak
travel days, which vary from
airline to airline. According to
the industry, half-fare passen
gers are barred because there
is no way to accommodate
them.
But one stewardess admits,
"Students will travel during
these periods, whether they pay
full fare or not. It's good to get
the full fare out of them."
No airline will board youth
fare passengers this year on
Dec. 15, 16, 21, 22, and Jan. 2
and 3.
Youth fare is also not ac
cepted on commuter flights

from here to Southern Califor
nia.
Another inconvenience to
youth • fare passengers is the
risk of being "bumped," or re
placed by a passenger at an in
termediate stop. One sopho
more economics major spent
eight hours in Cleveland, after
he was bumped from a flight
between New York and San
Francisco.
An American Airlines ticket
agent claims that half-fare pas
sengers are only infrequently
bumped, but adds, "It's all a
matter of chance. If you don't
want to take the chance, you
should pay full fare." Adds
William Hassell, an employee
in the TWA reservations office,
"We encourage people to take
non-stop flights."
Delta's Plan
Delta Air Lines has responded
to criticism of half fare by of
fering a confirmed tourist-class
seat at two-thirds fare to hold
ers of youth-fare cards. The
airline, which participated in
the half-fare standby plan until
mid -1966, received complaints
from parents whose children
had been delayed or stranded.
Delta also complained that
half-fare passengers phoned in
fictitious reservations in order
that there would be an empty
seat on their flight. Conversely,
customers with reservations
would cancel them if they found

there was standby room on
their flight.
Delta's plan is effective
throughout the year, except be
tween noon and midnight n
Fridays and from noon Sundays
until noon Mondays. Passengers
must make and confirm reser
vations, as do regular-fare cus
tomers.
The remaining airlines, how
ever, have shown little interest
in the Delta plan. According to
industry sources, the abuses of
which Delta complained are in
frequent. Furthermore, they
claim, Delta is not placing half
fare passengers in seats that
would otherwise be empty; it is
merely reducing the profitabil
ity of its flights.
Complaints from regular pas
sengers about the conduct of
half-fare riders has decreased,
since last year when half-fire
passengers were barred from
first class sections. Only mili
tary standbys are presently al
lowed to sit in first class.
M. E. Leaver, United Airlines
Director of Public Relations,
says, "We have had some com
plaints of hippies and barefoot
ers, and I think rightly so. But
in terms of the number of
young people we carry, there
have been few complaints." Ac
cording to Leaver, the airlines
won't board anyone who is
"barefooted, or otherwise offen
sive to regular customers."
