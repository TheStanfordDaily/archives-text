## BSU Attacks LA Paper 
### 
Large blank spaces appeared
on the two editorial pages of
the student newspaper at Los
Angeles City College last week
in a continuing racial contro
versy on the campus.
The semi-weekly newspaper,
the Collegian, has been the tar
get of the Black Students Un
ion, which demanded the paper
refer to all Negroes as "blacks."
College president Glenn Good
er ordered that two pages in the
paper be set aside for letters to
the editor. He also forbade the
printing of any editorials. The
Collegian did not receive
enough letters to fill the two
pages and the extra spaces
were left blank "to emphasize
how little interest there is . . .
YALE UNIVERSITY is seek
ing $388 million in the next ten
years, the largest fund-raising
goal ever set by a university.
Kingman Brewster, Yale's
president, said the university
would seek money from indi
vidual donors, "the several hun
dred of each generation whose
assets would allow them to be
philanthropists of capital sig
nificance."
Until the Yale announcement,
the highest total sought by a
university was Columbia's drive

begun last year for $200 million
in three years.
Of the $388 million sought,
$146.5 million would go for new
or expanded capital facilities
and $241.5 million would be
added tq the Yale endowment,
now worth $503.5 million.
"Yale," Mr. Brewster said,
will strive to keep life and learn
ing hand - tailored rather than
pre-cut, more a product of in
terest than of conformity to ad
ministered routine."

More than four - fifths of
PRINCETON UNIVERSITY'S
UNDERGRADUATES are dis
satisfied with their college so
cial life and would like to see
Princeton educating undergrad
uate women, according to a re
cent poll.
Eight - two per cent of the
2100 students who answered a
questionnaire circulated by a
student advisory committee fa
vored some form of coeduca
tion. More than 65 per cent in
dicated a preference for a co
ordinate women's college.
Only 18 per cent of those an
swering called the Princeton so
cial scene "satisfactory." Two
thirds of the university's 3200
undergraduates answered the
poll.

A four-year ADVISER PLAN
program is being offered to a
limited number of entering
freshmen this fall by Colorado
College.
Up to 50 entering freshmen
will spend four years without
necessarily meeting all standard
course requirements except the
128 academic-hour requirement
for graduation. In place of stan
dard requirements, students
will have to satisfy advisers as
to their programs.
College president Lloyd E.
Worner said the Adviser Plan
can benefit the student who is
prepared for greater specializa
tion than the regular student,
and also could serve the student
who wants a broad education
without the standard format of
required courses.
