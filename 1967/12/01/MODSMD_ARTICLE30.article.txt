# Computer Outlets Save Time, Work
## 
### 
If no one will say "Good
Morning" to you, at least WYL
BUR will. WYLBUR is the IBM
360 computer in the Computa
tion Center whose terminals are
being extended across the cam
pus. When the power in a ter
minal is turned on, it automat
ically types out a greeting.
WYLBUR was first rented
from IBM last Easter. It has
several terminals connected to
it in the Computation Center.
On November 10, seven new
terminals were installed in
buildings separate from the
Computation Center.
This was the first step in
spreading computer terminals
throughout many departments
in the university. Recently six
more outlets were installed.
The first seven are located in
the Plasma Lab, the Geology
Building, Cedar Hall, Varian
Building, Powers Building, Mc-
Cullough Building, and a room
used by the Mathematics De
partment.
The rent for a terminal is
$125.47 a month, although lower
rates of about $113 are coming
into effect soon. It costs $4 an
hour to use.
Dr. Tim Hayes, a regular

computer user in the Center for
Materials Research, explained
the new way of programming
which can be done with WYL
BUR since it is a text, editor.
The old method involved typing
on cards with a key-punch. If
one made a hole in the wrong
place, it could not be corrected
and the card would have to be
completely redone.
A text editor makes correct
ing mistakes less difficult The
terminal resembles a typewrit
er. One types out the informa
tion on paper, not a card. No
holes are punched. Words can
be inserted without redoing the
whole line.
Dr. Hayes thinks that one im
portant advantage of having the
terminals extended across the
campus is the time it saves.
Before a terminal was installed
in McCullough, he used to walk
to the Computation Center
about four times a day.
He sees WYLBUR as "a
glimpse into what science fic
tion is talking about." Teachers
could use it for grading home
work. If terminals were readily
available, students could pro
gram their answers and WYL
BUR would correct them.

used by the Mathematics De
partment.
The rent for a terminal is
$125.47 a month, although lower
rates of about $113 are coming
into effect soon. It costs $4 an
hour to use.
Dr. Tim Hayes, a regular

computer user in the Center for
Materials Research, explained
the new way of programming
which can be done with WYL
BUR since it is a text, editor.
The old method involved typing
on cards with a key-punch. If
one made a hole in the wrong
place, it could not be corrected
and the card would have to be
completely redone.
A text editor makes correct
ing mistakes less difficult The
terminal resembles a typewrit
er. One types out the informa
tion on paper, not a card. No
holes are punched. Words can
be inserted without redoing the
whole line.
Dr. Hayes thinks that one im
portant advantage of having the
terminals extended across the
campus is the time it saves.
Before a terminal was installed
in McCullough, he used to walk
to the Computation Center
about four times a day.
He sees WYLBUR as "a
glimpse into what science fic
tion is talking about." Teachers
could use it for grading home
work. If terminals were readily
available, students could pro
gram their answers and WYL
BUR would correct them.
If no one will say "Good
Morning" to you, at least WYL
BUR will. WYLBUR is the IBM
360 computer in the Computa
tion Center whose terminals are
being extended across the cam
pus. When the power in a ter
minal is turned on, it automat
ically types out a greeting.
WYLBUR was first rented
from IBM last Easter. It has
several terminals connected to
it in the Computation Center.
On November 10, seven new
terminals were installed in
buildings separate from the
Computation Center.
This was the first step in
spreading computer terminals
throughout many departments
in the university. Recently six
more outlets were installed.
The first seven are located in
the Plasma Lab, the Geology
Building, Cedar Hall, Varian
Building, Powers Building, Mc-
Cullough Building, and a room
used by the Mathematics De
partment.
