# Campaign Opener Tonight
## Basketball—How Tall Is Tall Enough? 
### NICK SELBY 
For perhaps the only time
this season, Stanford's varsity
basketball team will go into a
contest without a definite height
disadvantage.
Because of this fact, the In
dians' season opener against
Portland University tonight at
8:00 in the Stanford Pavilion
will not be a good indication of
Tribe basketball fortunes this
year.
But Coach Howie Dallmar
feels that the varsity contest
against the University of San
Francisco Monday night at 8:00
in the Pavilion will be a better
test for the Indians.
Central Question
Stanford's team closely re
sembles last year's line-up, but
there is one major exception.
A sizable hole was left by the
graduation of senior * captain
Rich Baker, whose experience
more than made up for his 6-ft.
7-in. frame.
Baker often faced taller men
on the boards, but worked for
position and held his own in per
haps every game but the UCLA
contests, when Lew Alcindor
cast his giant shadow over ev
erything.
This year, the responsibilities
of the center spot fall on 6-ft.
6-in. sophomore Steve Kuchen
becker, who Dallmar admits has
a height problem for the spot
but has demonstrated surpris
ing quickness and agility.
Bill Palmer (6-ft. 7-in.) will
back up Kuchenbecker in the
center spot.
Can't Guard These Cards
Bringing the ball up court are
two of the main strengths of
the team, junior Don Griffln,
who led the Cards in scoring
last year with 405 points, and
senior co-captain Gary Peters
meyer.
Griffln started the season
slowly last year, but after
Christmas his outside jump
shots began to swish consistent
ly and he became the big threat
for the Cards. He was only the
12th Indian to score more than
400 points in a season.
Petersmeyer set up the plays
and ripped off numerous fast
breaks last year to average 9.8
ppg. Petersmeyer's speed will
spearhead the Indian attack,

which Dallmar says will center
on fast break strategy.
Co • captain Art Harris and
junior Mai McElwaih provide
most of the Indian attack from
the forward spots. Harris was
the Tribe's second leading scor
er last year with 386 points for
a 14.9 ppg. average.
McElwain saw a fair amount
of action last year behind senior
Howard Hassen. He utilized his
specialties, a left-handed hook
and a jump shot from the cor
ner, to total 226 points for an
8.7 ppg. average.
Both Harris and MclEwain
are 6 ft. 4 In.
Turner's Debut
The Portland contest tonight
has added significance because
it marks Portland Coach Bill
Turner's debut as a head coach
in the college ranks. Turner
was the freshman coach at
Stanford last year.
The big guns for Portland are
senior captain Bill Gloden and
guard Hobart Herber. Gloden
fired in 18 ppg. last year from
his guard spot. Both Gloden
and Herber are 6 ft. tall.
Jesse Perry (6 ft. 7 in.) is the
center, and 'Bob Scotlan (6 ft.
6 in.) and Don Lawson (6 ft. 4
in.) are the forwards.
Card Coach Dallmar plans to
test his entire squad in the
game. Others likely to see ac
tion for the Tribe are guard Bill
Halligan and forwards Ed Mar
tin and Bill Closs.
Frosh Action
In a preliminary game to
night at 6, the Stanford frosh
take on Merritt College. Guard
Dennis O'Neill, 6 ft. 2 in., and
6 ft. 6 in. forward Mike Michel
have shown the most promise
In workouts so far. Center Greg
Bruce, forward Fred Green, and
guard Alan Chrlstensen round
out the starting five.
The frosh also take on the
USF frosh in a preliminary at
6 Monday night. The Stanford
J.V.'s battle Hamilton Air Force
Base's team Friday at 4 In the
Pavilion, and meet CCSF Mon
day at 4.


BOO! Art Harris (23) harasses Denver's All-American guard Harry
Hoi lines (33) as Mai McElwain craftily sneaks in from the rear to
complete the steal in this scene from last year's action. The Tribe
won that game 66-58 and went on to finish 15-11 for the season. Both
Harris and McElwain will be back this season. Other returning
starters are senior guard Gary Petersmeyer and his forecourt run
ning mate Don Grlffiln, who was last year's top scorer. They may
not be tall, but they've sure got the experlenoe! For once, the
Tribe's lack of height won't be too critical as they take on Portland
tonight In the Pavilion.

breaks last year to average 9.8
ppg. Petersmeyer's speed will
spearhead the Indian attack,

which Dallmar says will center
on fast break strategy.
Co • captain Art Harris and
junior Mai McElwaih provide
most of the Indian attack from
the forward spots. Harris was
the Tribe's second leading scor
er last year with 386 points for
a 14.9 ppg. average.
McElwain saw a fair amount
of action last year behind senior
Howard Hassen. He utilized his
specialties, a left-handed hook
and a jump shot from the cor
ner, to total 226 points for an
8.7 ppg. average.
Both Harris and MclEwain
are 6 ft. 4 In.
Turner's Debut
The Portland contest tonight
has added significance because
it marks Portland Coach Bill
Turner's debut as a head coach
in the college ranks. Turner
was the freshman coach at
Stanford last year.
The big guns for Portland are
senior captain Bill Gloden and
guard Hobart Herber. Gloden
fired in 18 ppg. last year from
his guard spot. Both Gloden
and Herber are 6 ft. tall.
Jesse Perry (6 ft. 7 in.) is the
center, and 'Bob Scotlan (6 ft.
6 in.) and Don Lawson (6 ft. 4
in.) are the forwards.
Card Coach Dallmar plans to
test his entire squad in the
game. Others likely to see ac
tion for the Tribe are guard Bill
Halligan and forwards Ed Mar
tin and Bill Closs.
Frosh Action
In a preliminary game to
night at 6, the Stanford frosh
take on Merritt College. Guard
Dennis O'Neill, 6 ft. 2 in., and
6 ft. 6 in. forward Mike Michel
have shown the most promise
In workouts so far. Center Greg
Bruce, forward Fred Green, and
guard Alan Chrlstensen round
out the starting five.
The frosh also take on the
USF frosh in a preliminary at
6 Monday night. The Stanford
J.V.'s battle Hamilton Air Force
Base's team Friday at 4 In the
Pavilion, and meet CCSF Mon
day at 4.


BOO! Art Harris (23) harasses Denver's All-American guard Harry
Hoi lines (33) as Mai McElwain craftily sneaks in from the rear to
complete the steal in this scene from last year's action. The Tribe
won that game 66-58 and went on to finish 15-11 for the season. Both
Harris and McElwain will be back this season. Other returning
starters are senior guard Gary Petersmeyer and his forecourt run
ning mate Don Grlffiln, who was last year's top scorer. They may
not be tall, but they've sure got the experlenoe! For once, the
Tribe's lack of height won't be too critical as they take on Portland
tonight In the Pavilion.
For perhaps the only time
this season, Stanford's varsity
basketball team will go into a
contest without a definite height
disadvantage.
Because of this fact, the In
dians' season opener against
Portland University tonight at
8:00 in the Stanford Pavilion
will not be a good indication of
Tribe basketball fortunes this
year.
But Coach Howie Dallmar
feels that the varsity contest
against the University of San
Francisco Monday night at 8:00
in the Pavilion will be a better
test for the Indians.
Central Question
Stanford's team closely re
sembles last year's line-up, but
there is one major exception.
A sizable hole was left by the
graduation of senior * captain
Rich Baker, whose experience
more than made up for his 6-ft.
7-in. frame.
Baker often faced taller men
on the boards, but worked for
position and held his own in per
haps every game but the UCLA
contests, when Lew Alcindor
cast his giant shadow over ev
erything.
This year, the responsibilities
of the center spot fall on 6-ft.
6-in. sophomore Steve Kuchen
becker, who Dallmar admits has
a height problem for the spot
but has demonstrated surpris
ing quickness and agility.
Bill Palmer (6-ft. 7-in.) will
back up Kuchenbecker in the
center spot.
Can't Guard These Cards
Bringing the ball up court are
two of the main strengths of
the team, junior Don Griffln,
who led the Cards in scoring
last year with 405 points, and
senior co-captain Gary Peters
meyer.
Griffln started the season
slowly last year, but after
Christmas his outside jump
shots began to swish consistent
ly and he became the big threat
for the Cards. He was only the
12th Indian to score more than
400 points in a season.

USF frosh in a preliminary at
6 Monday night. The Stanford
J.V.'s battle Hamilton Air Force
Base's team Friday at 4 In the
Pavilion, and meet CCSF Mon
day at 4.


BOO! Art Harris (23) harasses Denver's All-American guard Harry
Hoi lines (33) as Mai McElwain craftily sneaks in from the rear to
complete the steal in this scene from last year's action. The Tribe
won that game 66-58 and went on to finish 15-11 for the season. Both
Harris and McElwain will be back this season. Other returning
starters are senior guard Gary Petersmeyer and his forecourt run
ning mate Don Grlffiln, who was last year's top scorer. They may
not be tall, but they've sure got the experlenoe! For once, the
Tribe's lack of height won't be too critical as they take on Portland
tonight In the Pavilion.
For perhaps the only time
this season, Stanford's varsity
basketball team will go into a
contest without a definite height
disadvantage.
Because of this fact, the In
dians' season opener against
Portland University tonight at
8:00 in the Stanford Pavilion
will not be a good indication of
Tribe basketball fortunes this
year.
But Coach Howie Dallmar
feels that the varsity contest
against the University of San
Francisco Monday night at 8:00
in the Pavilion will be a better
test for the Indians.
Central Question
Stanford's team closely re
sembles last year's line-up, but
there is one major exception.
A sizable hole was left by the
graduation of senior * captain
Rich Baker, whose experience
more than made up for his 6-ft.
7-in. frame.
Baker often faced taller men
on the boards, but worked for
position and held his own in per
haps every game but the UCLA
contests, when Lew Alcindor
cast his giant shadow over ev
erything.
This year, the responsibilities
of the center spot fall on 6-ft.
6-in. sophomore Steve Kuchen
becker, who Dallmar admits has
a height problem for the spot
but has demonstrated surpris
ing quickness and agility.
Bill Palmer (6-ft. 7-in.) will
back up Kuchenbecker in the
center spot.
Can't Guard These Cards
Bringing the ball up court are
two of the main strengths of
the team, junior Don Griffln,
who led the Cards in scoring
last year with 405 points, and
senior co-captain Gary Peters
meyer.
Griffln started the season
slowly last year, but after
Christmas his outside jump
shots began to swish consistent
ly and he became the big threat
for the Cards. He was only the
12th Indian to score more than
400 points in a season.
Petersmeyer set up the plays
and ripped off numerous fast
breaks last year to average 9.8
ppg. Petersmeyer's speed will
spearhead the Indian attack,

which Dallmar says will center
on fast break strategy.
Co • captain Art Harris and
junior Mai McElwaih provide
most of the Indian attack from
the forward spots. Harris was
the Tribe's second leading scor
er last year with 386 points for
a 14.9 ppg. average.
McElwain saw a fair amount
of action last year behind senior
Howard Hassen. He utilized his
specialties, a left-handed hook
and a jump shot from the cor
ner, to total 226 points for an
8.7 ppg. average.
Both Harris and MclEwain
are 6 ft. 4 In.
Turner's Debut
The Portland contest tonight
has added significance because
it marks Portland Coach Bill
Turner's debut as a head coach
in the college ranks. Turner
was the freshman coach at
Stanford last year.
The big guns for Portland are
senior captain Bill Gloden and
guard Hobart Herber. Gloden
fired in 18 ppg. last year from
his guard spot. Both Gloden
and Herber are 6 ft. tall.
Jesse Perry (6 ft. 7 in.) is the
center, and 'Bob Scotlan (6 ft.
6 in.) and Don Lawson (6 ft. 4
in.) are the forwards.
Card Coach Dallmar plans to
test his entire squad in the
game. Others likely to see ac
tion for the Tribe are guard Bill
Halligan and forwards Ed Mar
tin and Bill Closs.
Frosh Action
In a preliminary game to
night at 6, the Stanford frosh
take on Merritt College. Guard
Dennis O'Neill, 6 ft. 2 in., and
6 ft. 6 in. forward Mike Michel
have shown the most promise
In workouts so far. Center Greg
Bruce, forward Fred Green, and
guard Alan Chrlstensen round
out the starting five.
The frosh also take on the
USF frosh in a preliminary at
6 Monday night. The Stanford
J.V.'s battle Hamilton Air Force
Base's team Friday at 4 In the
