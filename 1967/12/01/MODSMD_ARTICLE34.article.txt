# Wrestlers To Debut In Nor-Cal
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford's wrestling team,
16th in the country last year in
the NCAA finals in March, be
gins its winter grind tomorrow
in the Northern California Invi
tation tournament at San Jose
State College.
The grappling commences at
11 a.m.
Carrying the main hopes of
the Tribe matmen are co-cap
tains Len Borchers and Terry
Crenshaw. Both took fourth
places for the Tribe in the na
tionals last year, and rookie
coach Dave Reed is very high
on their chances for titles this
year.
Borchers, 160 pounds, has al
ready seen action this fall. He
took first place in an AAU tour
nament in San Mateo, defeat
ing three-time member of the
U.S. Olympic team Ben North
rup handily in the finals.

Crenshaw was out for foot
ball most of the fall, but has
been polishing up his fantastic
leg wrestling tactics and ap
pears ready for combat.
Health Problems
The rest of the team is not
in the health that Reed would
like to see them. The Cards will
enter no one at 115, and veteran
Rocky Carroll has an injured
knee at 123 pounds and will not
wrestle.
Van Bennett, a sopohomore, is
quickly improving at 130
pounds, and sophomore Cliff
Davidson, another sophomore,
appears to have conquered his
knee troubles from last year.
At 145 pounds, John Koutre
kan has been sick for much of
the quarter and will not wrestle
tomorrow. Brian Smith and
Gerry Beaudoin will wrestle off
for the spot. Beaudoin was the
varsity representative at 137

pounds last year.
Bill Vogelpohl has dropped a
weight this year to 152 pounds
and appears in good shape after
a knee injury destroyed his sea
son last year. Veteran Burt
Ambler goes at 167 pounds, and
senior Bud Hollingberry goes at
177 pounds.
Ben Shaver destroyed most of
his opponents as a freshman
heavyweight last year and will
wrestle at that slot this year.
One of the Tribe's best wres
tlers won't see action at San
Jose. John Suttle, 152 pounds,
has been having problems with
his shoulder again and won't
begin working out until after
Christmas.
The big opponents for Stan
ford at the tournament will be
Fresno State and University of
Cal at Berkeley, both of which
defeated the Cards in dual
meets last year.
