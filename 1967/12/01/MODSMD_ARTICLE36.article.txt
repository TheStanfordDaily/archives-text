# Defendants' Statement
## 
### 
(The following statement was released yesterday by the ten
students cited by the Dean of Students for violation of the Uni
versity demonstrations regulation at a protest against CIA re
cruiting Nov. 1).
We have decided as a group not to appear before the Interim
Judicial Body (IJB).
First of all, we do not consider the IJB to be a legitimate judic
ial body, especially considering the recent decision of the student
legislature.
Quite clearly, it is a kangaroo courtâ€”the prosecutors are the
administration and the jury consists of its appointees.
But perhaps more importantly, we are not sure we can in any
case recognize the authority of Stanford, an institution which is
vital to war-making research in such areas as electronics, chemical
warfare, the abortive strategic hamlet program in Vietnam, and
whose board of directors is heavily involved in the defense in
dustries.
In other words, we do not recognize the authority of one agent
of American war-making imperialism to judge our actions against
another agent, the CIA, of that same system.
Since we are acting in concert with the decisions of the student
judicial council, the legislature and the president, we ask the
Stanford community's students and faculty to support us against
intimidation and discipline by the administration.
