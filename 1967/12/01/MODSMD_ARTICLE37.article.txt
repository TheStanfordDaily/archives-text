# McCarthy Announces Candidacy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Min
nesota Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy
posted his Vietnam war chal
lenge to President Johnson
Thursday, announcing he will
enter at least tour presidential
primaries in 196&—and hinting
that Sen. Robert F. Kennedy
could become the political bene
ficiary.
McCarthy said he will enter
the primaries in Wisconsin, Ne
braska, Oregon and California.
He said there is so much dis
satisfaction in America over the
Vietnam war, its conduct and its
effects at home, that "there is a
good possibility" Johnson will
be denied renomination.
"I believe there's a good
chance that we can win two or
three primaries," the tall gray
haired senator said.
The White House was silent
on McCarthy's announcement.
So was Kennedy, for the mo
ment.
McCarthy said his determina
tion to run was stiffened by "an
nouncements from the acfcninis
tration of plans for continued
escalation and intensification of
the war in Vietnam.
He said he hopes his candi
dacy will lead Johnson to alter
that policy.
"If not," he said, "I think the
challenge would have to go all
the way to a challenge for the
nomination for the presidency.
"If not me, someone else."
"I think that there might be
a fight on the floor of the con
vention in any case," he said.
McCarthy described his Viet
nam prescription as a phased,
scheduled withdrawal of U.S.
forces, with periodic efforts at
settlement.
"As I'm sure I shall be
charged, I am not for peace at
any price but for an honorable,
rational and political solution to
this war," he said.
"I am hopeful," he said, "that
this challenge, which I hope will
be supported by other members
of the Senate and other politi
cians, may alleviate the sense of
political helplessness and re
store to many people a belief in
the process of American poli
tics and of American govern
ment."
"I do not see in my move any
threat to the unity and the
strength of the Democratic
->arty, whatever the unity today
may be and whatever strength
't may be," McCarthy said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Min
nesota Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy
posted his Vietnam war chal
lenge to President Johnson
Thursday, announcing he will
enter at least tour presidential
primaries in 196&—and hinting
that Sen. Robert F. Kennedy
could become the political bene
ficiary.
McCarthy said he will enter
the primaries in Wisconsin, Ne
braska, Oregon and California.
He said there is so much dis
satisfaction in America over the
Vietnam war, its conduct and its
effects at home, that "there is a
good possibility" Johnson will
be denied renomination.
"I believe there's a good
chance that we can win two or
three primaries," the tall gray
haired senator said.
The White House was silent
on McCarthy's announcement.
So was Kennedy, for the mo
ment.
McCarthy said his determina
tion to run was stiffened by "an
nouncements from the acfcninis
tration of plans for continued
escalation and intensification of
the war in Vietnam.
He said he hopes his candi
dacy will lead Johnson to alter
that policy.
"If not," he said, "I think the
challenge would have to go all
the way to a challenge for the
nomination for the presidency.
"If not me, someone else."
"I think that there might be
a fight on the floor of the con
vention in any case," he said.
McCarthy described his Viet
nam prescription as a phased,
scheduled withdrawal of U.S.
forces, with periodic efforts at
settlement.
"As I'm sure I shall be
charged, I am not for peace at
any price but for an honorable,
rational and political solution to
this war," he said.
"I am hopeful," he said, "that
this challenge, which I hope will
be supported by other members
of the Senate and other politi
cians, may alleviate the sense of
political helplessness and re
store to many people a belief in
the process of American poli
tics and of American govern
ment."
"I do not see in my move any
threat to the unity and the
strength of the Democratic
->arty, whatever the unity today
may be and whatever strength
't may be," McCarthy said.
