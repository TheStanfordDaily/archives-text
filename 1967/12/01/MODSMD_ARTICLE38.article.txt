## Anouilh: Or Is It Ennui? 
### THOMAS STOCKFISCH 
Jean Anouilh's The Cavern is
a play about playmaking. It
presents an author and a group
of characters from a play he
has been unable to put together.
At the outset of the play, the
author acknowledges Pirandel
lo's precedent, but goes on to
say that "this isn't quite the
same thing." And he's right; it
certainly isn't. Six Characters
in Search of an Author is a met
aphysical inquiry, a challenge to
the ease with which we sepa
rate imaginative from actual ex
perience. The Cavern is a melo
dramatic diversion, which ulti
mately assures us, by implica
tion, that life is as simple as
the story books have always
told us it was.
The characters in the author's
play are the inhabitants of a
fashionable Paris mansion at
the turn of the century, and di
vide neatly into two classesâ€”
aristocrats and their servants.
The two levels Anouilh pre
scribes to be used in the stag
ing of the play emphasize this
distinction, and he also treats us
to some trite speeches on the
subject.
Lacks Chronology
With no heed paid to chrono
logical order, and to the au
thor's increasing chagrin, the
characters set about their af
fairs (and I mean affairs), en
acting a series of possible
scenes. These scenes eventually
tell us that the mansion's cook
was murdered by her lover, the
coachman, in a scuffle that en
sued upon her discovery that he
had impregnated the kitchen
maid. Prior to this the cook
had been pouring a potion down
the maid's throat in an attempt
to induce an abortion, much to
the dismay of her son (illegiti
mate, by the Count upstairs),
who would prefer to marry the
girl and provide for the child.
Pretty standard fare.
The fact that the play is de
riyative and quite insubstantial
have not, however, prevented
Stanford Repertory Theater
from presenting it as the first
major production of its third
season.
As usual, SRTs technical ef
fects are impressive. The set,
designed by M.F.A. student
Warren Travis, skillfully con
cretizes and juxtaposes the two
worlds of the play in an earthy,
rock-like kitchen and a well-ap
pointed upstairs room which
flows off into darkness. Travis
has accommodated well the lim
itations of the Little Theater.
Derek Hunt's lighting enhances
the virtues of the set.

At the play's opening, the
curtain and then the characters
and set are bathed in an ethe
real glow reminiscent of a simi
lar effect in William Ball's pro
duction of Six Characters.
Douglas A. Russel's costumes
underscore the levels of life in
the play. But you can't make a
silk purse out of Jean Anouilh,
and the acting does have its
faults.
Unless an actor is a technical
virtuoso, and can thoroughly
fake the appearances of a given
part (there are no such virtuosi
in the Stanford company), it is
necessary that he be imbued
with, convinced of, the truth of
a character. Lack of conviction
on an actor's part results from
one or more of the following:
immaturity of spiritual and psy
chological resources; a failure
to discover and deepen a char
acter through rehearsal; being
forced to play a character who
is poorly written. Actors who
are not convinced give us char
acters who are not convincing.
A good number of moments
in this production betray a lack
of conviction. I am especially
not persuaded that Glenn Can
non as Marcel, the valet, really
stands in awe of the Baron's life
of ease, or that he is in fact a
procurer, or that Anne Gerety's
Countess really disapproves of
her husband's behavior. William
Sharp's Count is similarly un
convincing, except in the speech
where he recalls his frustrated
affair with the cook.
Gerald Hiken, apparently
made up to resemble Anouilh
himself, plays the author as a
bumbling eccentric, who does
not seem capable of a construc
tive concern with the fate of his
play. The Superintendent, a
character who comments on and
complicates the author's dilem
ma, is played by Paul E. Rich
ards, who throws away much
expository material in his agi
tated, antic interrogation of the
Count.
Some Transcend Anouilh
Both Hiken and Richards rely
too much on eyebrow raising
and double takes to achieve
their effects. Their moments on
stage together begin to look like
scenes from a Marx brothers
movie. Sirin Devrim (who also
directed this production) has a
commanding physical presence
as the Cook, but is often diffi
cult to understand because of
her accent and the speed of her
speaking.
Many of these weaknesses
may be rooted in the script, but
a few people do well with what
Anouilh gives them. Ellen Per

ry is, for instance, charming as
the chambermaid. She is espe
cially pleasing and accomplished
vocally, quite in contrast to
some of those around her.
Stephen D. Newman turns in
a very, very good performance
as the naive, idealistic seminar
ist. He exhibits a warmth and
restraint, especially in his first
groping conversation with
Adele, the kitchen maid, that I
have not previously seen in his
work.
The other highlight of the
evening is Mary Staton's ren
dering of Adele. She convoys a
lovely, giving sort of girlishness
in her conversation with the
seminarist, and is genuinely af
fecting in the later scene where
she spews out her long - sup
pressed hatred for the people
who have victimized her. The
Countess' stunned, incredulous
reaction to this outburst also
deserves notice.
As director, Miss Devrim has
coordinated the manifold details
woll. One touch I could do with
out. however, (shades of Tiny
Alice!), is the clocklike ticking
which accompanies the cook's
dying.
At the final curtain, the au
thor asks the audience to ex
cuse his shortcomings. I, for
one, cannot.


PANIC-STRICKEN, Adele, the kitchen maid (Mary Staton) tries
to break away from Leon, the coachman (Alan Howard) in this
tense moment from Stanford Repertory Theater's production of
Jean Anouiih's "The Cavern."
