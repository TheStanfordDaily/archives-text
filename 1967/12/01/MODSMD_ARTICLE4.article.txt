# Issue Statement On IJB
## Protesters Wonâ€™t Go 
### 
Ten students say they will re
fuse to appear Dec. 5 before the
Interim Judicial Body (IJB) to
answer charges that they vio
lated University rules in an at
tempt to block CIA recruiting.
In a 180-word statement, they
claim the IJB is a "kangaroo"
court which is "not legitimate"
because the student judicial
council, legislature and presi
dent do not recognize its appeal
jurisdiction.
The IJB consists of five fac
ulty members appointed by
President Wallace Sterling to
hoar appeals from the Judicial
Council. Law Prof. Howard R.
Williams is chairman.
Yesterday Williams responded
to the demonstrator's professed
definance with this statement
only:
"The hearing has been sched
uled for 7:30 p.m. on December
5 in room 163e of the law build
ing. A hearing will be held."
This means the Dean of Stu
dents' office will present its evi

dence that the ten students vio
lated the University regulations
in the Nov. 1 protest against
CIA job recruiting in Encina
hall. Punishment, including pro
bation or suspension, could be
given the students whether or
not they attend the hearing.
The students are accused of
violating a regulation forbidding
demonstrations which interfere
with "vehicular or pedestrian
traffic." The regulation also
stipulates that demonstrations
must be "conducted in an or
derly manner."
In the CIA protest a crowd
of students, mostly members of
the Resistance or Students for
a Democratic Society (SDS),
blocked a doorway to Encina
hall and later broke into the
building, where a lone CIA re
cruiter was conducting job in
terviews.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
warned repeatedly during the
demonstration that the students
were breaking University rules.
Ten students who participated

in the protest were identified
from photographs. The Judicial
Council was asked to hear their
cases.
Council Refuses Case
In a letter Nov. 20, Judicial
Council Chairman John Raskin
refused to consider the case. The
next day the ASSU legislature
withdrew recognition of the IJB
and called for the formation of
a student-faculty court to re
place it. ASSU President Cesare
Massarenti, in his first official
action this week, issued a state
ment supporting the legislature
and calling for immediate nego
tiations to create a new appeals
board.
Smith referred the protestors'
case to the IJB.
About 50 other students signed
a "complicity statement" de-
V Vlill UIUUU Itvui ~ */
manding they be subject to the
same discipline given the ten
students cited by Smith. Merle
Rabine, an English graduate
student, circulated the state
ment.
Smith replied by sending a let
ter to each of the 50 asking for
further information about their
participation in the protest. Per
sons not present at the demon
stration will not be prosecuted.
The statement issued by the
ten defendants goes beyond
merely criticizing the jurisdic
tion of the IJB. It equates Stan
ford University with the CIA as
an "agent of American war-mak
ing imperialism." In a "kanga
roo court" where the "prose
cutors are the administration
and the jury consists of its ap
pointees," the defendants allege
one agent of this imperialism is
trying to judge "our actions
against another agent, the CIA."
The statement asks for sup
port from students and faculty
against "intimidation and disci
pline by the administration."
The text of the statement is
printed on page 8 of today's
Daily.

The ten students are Jeff
Browning, Yale Braunstein,
Jack Gerson, Judy Goldman,
Barry Greenberg, Andy Parnes,
Marc Sapir, Leonard Siegel,
Mark Silverman, and Guy
Smythe.
Jack Gerson, an SDS orga
nizer, believes refusal to appear
before the IJB will bring a stiff
er sentence. But he does not ex
pect to be suspended.
"Personally I think they'll
make it tougher on us," he said.
"It will seem to them that we're
flaunting their authority so
they'll have to crack down and
make us an object lesson."
Gerson claimed that appear
ing before the IJB would be
tantamount to "admitting its
right to prosecute us."
Another defendant, Marc Sa
pir, said "It would be totally in
consistent for us to do anything
else" but refuse to appear at
the hearing.
Sapir was convicted last year
for violating the demonstration
regulation. Some of the defen
dants fear Sapir, a medical stu
dent, will receive a more severe
sentence because of his past rec
ord.

against another agent, the CIA."
The statement asks for sup
port from students and faculty
against "intimidation and disci
pline by the administration."
The text of the statement is
printed on page 8 of today's
Daily.

The ten students are Jeff
Browning, Yale Braunstein,
Jack Gerson, Judy Goldman,
Barry Greenberg, Andy Parnes,
Marc Sapir, Leonard Siegel,
Mark Silverman, and Guy
Smythe.
Jack Gerson, an SDS orga
nizer, believes refusal to appear
before the IJB will bring a stiff
er sentence. But he does not ex
pect to be suspended.
"Personally I think they'll
make it tougher on us," he said.
"It will seem to them that we're
flaunting their authority so
they'll have to crack down and
make us an object lesson."
Gerson claimed that appear
ing before the IJB would be
tantamount to "admitting its
right to prosecute us."
Another defendant, Marc Sa
pir, said "It would be totally in
consistent for us to do anything
else" but refuse to appear at
the hearing.
Sapir was convicted last year
for violating the demonstration
regulation. Some of the defen
dants fear Sapir, a medical stu
dent, will receive a more severe
sentence because of his past rec
ord.
Ten students say they will re
fuse to appear Dec. 5 before the
Interim Judicial Body (IJB) to
answer charges that they vio
lated University rules in an at
tempt to block CIA recruiting.
In a 180-word statement, they
claim the IJB is a "kangaroo"
court which is "not legitimate"
because the student judicial
council, legislature and presi
dent do not recognize its appeal
jurisdiction.
The IJB consists of five fac
ulty members appointed by
President Wallace Sterling to
hoar appeals from the Judicial
Council. Law Prof. Howard R.
Williams is chairman.
Yesterday Williams responded
to the demonstrator's professed
definance with this statement
only:
"The hearing has been sched
uled for 7:30 p.m. on December
5 in room 163e of the law build
ing. A hearing will be held."
This means the Dean of Stu
dents' office will present its evi

dence that the ten students vio
lated the University regulations
in the Nov. 1 protest against
CIA job recruiting in Encina
hall. Punishment, including pro
bation or suspension, could be
given the students whether or
not they attend the hearing.
The students are accused of
violating a regulation forbidding
demonstrations which interfere
with "vehicular or pedestrian
traffic." The regulation also
stipulates that demonstrations
must be "conducted in an or
derly manner."
In the CIA protest a crowd
of students, mostly members of
the Resistance or Students for
a Democratic Society (SDS),
blocked a doorway to Encina
hall and later broke into the
building, where a lone CIA re
cruiter was conducting job in
terviews.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
warned repeatedly during the
demonstration that the students
were breaking University rules.
Ten students who participated

in the protest were identified
from photographs. The Judicial
Council was asked to hear their
cases.
Council Refuses Case
In a letter Nov. 20, Judicial
Council Chairman John Raskin
refused to consider the case. The
next day the ASSU legislature
withdrew recognition of the IJB
and called for the formation of
a student-faculty court to re
place it. ASSU President Cesare
Massarenti, in his first official
action this week, issued a state
ment supporting the legislature
and calling for immediate nego
tiations to create a new appeals
board.
Smith referred the protestors'
case to the IJB.
About 50 other students signed
a "complicity statement" de-
V Vlill UIUUU Itvui ~ */
manding they be subject to the
same discipline given the ten
students cited by Smith. Merle
Rabine, an English graduate
student, circulated the state
ment.
Smith replied by sending a let
ter to each of the 50 asking for
further information about their
participation in the protest. Per
sons not present at the demon
stration will not be prosecuted.
The statement issued by the
ten defendants goes beyond
merely criticizing the jurisdic
tion of the IJB. It equates Stan
ford University with the CIA as
an "agent of American war-mak
ing imperialism." In a "kanga
roo court" where the "prose
cutors are the administration
and the jury consists of its ap
pointees," the defendants allege
one agent of this imperialism is
trying to judge "our actions
against another agent, the CIA."

refused to consider the case. The
next day the ASSU legislature
withdrew recognition of the IJB
and called for the formation of
a student-faculty court to re
place it. ASSU President Cesare
Massarenti, in his first official
action this week, issued a state
ment supporting the legislature
and calling for immediate nego
tiations to create a new appeals
board.
Smith referred the protestors'
case to the IJB.
About 50 other students signed
a "complicity statement" de-
V Vlill UIUUU Itvui ~ */
manding they be subject to the
same discipline given the ten
students cited by Smith. Merle
Rabine, an English graduate
student, circulated the state
ment.
Smith replied by sending a let
ter to each of the 50 asking for
further information about their
participation in the protest. Per
sons not present at the demon
stration will not be prosecuted.
The statement issued by the
ten defendants goes beyond
merely criticizing the jurisdic
tion of the IJB. It equates Stan
ford University with the CIA as
an "agent of American war-mak
ing imperialism." In a "kanga
roo court" where the "prose
cutors are the administration
and the jury consists of its ap
pointees," the defendants allege
one agent of this imperialism is
trying to judge "our actions
against another agent, the CIA."
The statement asks for sup
port from students and faculty
against "intimidation and disci
pline by the administration."
The text of the statement is
printed on page 8 of today's
Daily.

The ten students are Jeff
Browning, Yale Braunstein,
Jack Gerson, Judy Goldman,
Barry Greenberg, Andy Parnes,
Marc Sapir, Leonard Siegel,
Mark Silverman, and Guy
Smythe.
Jack Gerson, an SDS orga
nizer, believes refusal to appear
before the IJB will bring a stiff
er sentence. But he does not ex
pect to be suspended.
"Personally I think they'll
make it tougher on us," he said.
"It will seem to them that we're
flaunting their authority so
they'll have to crack down and
make us an object lesson."
Gerson claimed that appear
ing before the IJB would be
tantamount to "admitting its
right to prosecute us."
Another defendant, Marc Sa
pir, said "It would be totally in
consistent for us to do anything
else" but refuse to appear at
the hearing.
Sapir was convicted last year
for violating the demonstration
regulation. Some of the defen
dants fear Sapir, a medical stu
dent, will receive a more severe
sentence because of his past rec
ord.
Ten students say they will re
fuse to appear Dec. 5 before the
Interim Judicial Body (IJB) to
answer charges that they vio
lated University rules in an at
tempt to block CIA recruiting.
In a 180-word statement, they
claim the IJB is a "kangaroo"
court which is "not legitimate"
because the student judicial
council, legislature and presi
dent do not recognize its appeal
jurisdiction.
The IJB consists of five fac
ulty members appointed by
President Wallace Sterling to
hoar appeals from the Judicial
Council. Law Prof. Howard R.
Williams is chairman.
Yesterday Williams responded
to the demonstrator's professed
definance with this statement
only:
"The hearing has been sched
uled for 7:30 p.m. on December
5 in room 163e of the law build
ing. A hearing will be held."
This means the Dean of Stu
dents' office will present its evi

dence that the ten students vio
lated the University regulations
in the Nov. 1 protest against
CIA job recruiting in Encina
hall. Punishment, including pro
bation or suspension, could be
given the students whether or
not they attend the hearing.
The students are accused of
violating a regulation forbidding
demonstrations which interfere
with "vehicular or pedestrian
traffic." The regulation also
stipulates that demonstrations
must be "conducted in an or
derly manner."
In the CIA protest a crowd
of students, mostly members of
the Resistance or Students for
a Democratic Society (SDS),
blocked a doorway to Encina
hall and later broke into the
building, where a lone CIA re
cruiter was conducting job in
terviews.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
warned repeatedly during the
demonstration that the students
were breaking University rules.
Ten students who participated

in the protest were identified
from photographs. The Judicial
Council was asked to hear their
cases.
