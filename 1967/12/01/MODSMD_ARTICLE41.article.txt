## The 						Chapparal— In A New Guise 
### PAT McMAHON 
The arrival of dead week also
means the arrival of little yel
low boxes of goodies. These
"Care packages" are full of
brownies and cookies and apples
and oranges, and are gobbled up
before dead week is half over.
However, a new "Care pack
age" that may indeed rescue you
from Dead Week doldrums will
find its way to the Post Office
and Engineering Corner next
Wednesday — The Stanford
Chapparral.
And if you think apples,
oranges, and raisins, and cook
ies are a real bargain for $4.00,
try Bruce Franklin on Maoism,
poetry, cartoons, "The Monetary
Theme in Shakespeare's Ham
let," an impressionistic piece on
Oakland, and much more for 60
cents.
The Chappie, yes, you remem
ber, may make your dead week
perhaps a little more livable.
If you want light reading or
browsing, try the cartoons or
p rhaps Robert Barrett's "Two
Shears For Democracy" remi
niscing haircuts from his first
crying day to the present.
Or if your dead week reading
must be relevant and you are
studying Mao, or Civ, or Poll
Sci or Vietnam, the interview
with Bruce Franklin should fit
the bill.
Harvey Mudd
Still not happy, try page 18—
"Now that the rains have come,
Stanford will be known as the
Harvey Mudd of the North."
And don't miss The Viet Nam
War Prirper, that smacks of
Mad Magazine, with lessons on
peacemongers, (See the traitor.
See his beard . . .) and Mr. Dow,
(See the patriot. He backs our
boys at war. His company backs
up our boys. His name is Mr.
Dow. You got a light, Mr.
Dow?)
Doesn't sound like the Chap
pie, Stanford's onetime humor
magazine, you used to know?
That's right.
The humor that wasn't funny,
the smut that wasn't humor,
and even Powerpie and her ex
citing adventures that never
were very exciting, are conspic
uously absent in the new Chap
pie.
The Chapparal 1967-8 is out
standing. When a magazine
first starts out, no one expects
it to be immediately successful.
It will crawl, and maybe finally
begin to walk.

But not the Chappie. It is com
ing out walking, and maybe
running. It leaps and dances
with fine writing, interesting in
novation, and (good god, yes,)
humor.
What happened? Why the
change?
Perhaps it is the three thou
sand copies of last year's Chap
pies piled in the Chapparal of
fice that were never sold. (Now
a collector's item. Buy one
soon.)
Or as editor Mike Rugg says
in an opening statement, "the
Chapparal is definitely abandon
ing the somewhat adolescent,
brash, shallow style it has main
tained for over a quarter of a
century, and which to a great
extent was an integral part of
those times, this change is not
a repudiation of all the maga
zine's tradition . . we hope it
will fulfill the design of ... 'a
journal of free discussion.' M
Literary Merit
But The Chapparal reflects
and is part of a major shift in
student publications here.
Sequoia, the "Stanford Liter
ary Magazine," is no more. The
Chappie, Workshop, and the
Stanford daily magazine are
moving in on this new frontier.
Student publications are re
flecting the concerns of the stu
dent body: less emphasis on
both humor ha-ha and rah-rah
grossness and literary merit for
literary merit's sake. The an
swer is somewhere in the mid
dle. The answer is this new
Chapparal and the Stanford
daily magazine and Workshop
and even the QUAD. These an
swers aren't perfect scores, but
are beginning to reach their in
dividual potentials.
Improved Content
The Chappie's greatest accom
plishment is its content, or its
welcome change in content, yet
it is in its content where im
provement must come.
The blend or mix of articles—
short stories, humor (notably
that by Hugh West and Jurgen
Wolff), essays, poetry, and art
work seems an ideal combina
tion. What remains then is to
got Ih top-notch, brilliant essay,
! he quailty short story, and the
best art.
If will 'Courage you to know
that according to unimpeach
able sources in six-point type at
the bottom of the Chappie staff
box: "Bigfoot is alive and well
in Canada."
