# UCM Conference Set For Cleveland
## 
### 
During Christmas vacation, a
number of Stanford students
will be participating in the Uni
versity Christian Movement's
first major conference, the Cleve
land Week of Process '67.
The 20th in a series of interna
tional quadrennial conferences
of university Christian groups,
the Cleveland Week (Dec. 26-Jan.
17) brings together over 3000 peo
ple concerned with social change
and its relationship to the uni
versity. Participants will include
students, professors and admin
istrators from a wide range of
colleges and universities, repre
sentatives from other sectors of
life such as urban ghettoes, and
students and resource people
from other countries.
Jay Jones, president of the
Stanford UCM and Western Re
gion Vice-President of the na
tional UCM, noted that "this
will not be merely another na
tional meeting for a confedera
tion of church groups. The week
in Cleveland is to be the national
focal point in an attempt to
build a movement for social
change. We think that the prob
lems of a fragmented society

cannot be successfully dealt
with in a fragmented way."
The main emphasis of the
conference will be on "Depth
Education Groups," (DEG's),
seminars similar to many pres
ently in progress on the Stan
ford campus. These groups will
deal with issues and solutions
in a particular problem area as
well as various courses of action.
Stanford has one official DEG,
a UCM discussion group on
"Theology and Social Change."
This particular group was
formed upon a request from
the national UCM, but groups
at other universities formed out
side of the official UCM struc
ture and then were made official
by request.
Many other groups fitting the
definition are operating at Stan
ford outside the official struc
ture, but students participating
in these can still contribute to
the conference.
Students and others interested
in the conference may contact
the UCM offices for further in
formation.
