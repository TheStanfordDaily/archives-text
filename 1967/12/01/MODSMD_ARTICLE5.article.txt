# Interdepartment Majors Proposed By H-S Deans
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Twenty Stanford undergradu
ates may soon be designing their
own academic programs, free of
the requirement to earn a "ma
jor" in some department.
An experimental plan has
been proposed to allow a limited
number of students to work out
bachelor's degree programs con
centrating on several disciplines,
instead of the single discipline
usually required.
Dean Robert R. Sears of the
school of humanities and sci
ences and his associates sub
mitted the proposal to the Aca
demic Council's Committee on
Undergraduate Education, which
gave it unqualified approval.
The nine-member Executive
Committee of the Council will

consider the proposal next week.
If approved, the Academic Coun
cil will vote on the plan Jan. 5.
The deans hope the experi
ment will allow "highly moti
vated students to design inte
grated majors suited to their
own particular needs and qualifi
cations."
In a memorandum outlining
the plan, the d?ans said "certain
undergraduates are developing
intellectual interests that can
only be satisfied by programs
that cut across the usual depart
mental lines and form coherent
patterns other than those mark
ed out by the traditional disci
plines."
Two examples of interdepart
mental majors actually proposed
by students were given. One
would lead to bachelor's degree
in computer science, not pres
ently offered by the University.
Sophomore Ying Y. Lr>w sub
mitted a program involving
courses in mathematics, electri
cal engineering, philosophy, phy
sics, and computer science.
The memorandum calls this
"a good example of the sort of
thing we have in mind," because
it would be "magnificent prep
aration for Mr. Lew to develop
into a scientist and a scholar."
Other Requests
The other request came from
sophomore Marilyn Hezmall for
a degree in linguistic sciences,
involving "an integrated pro
gram of courses in French lang
uage, speech science and speech
pathology, anthropology, linguis
tics" and related fields.
"These are the first two peti
tions that have come to us," the
deans write, "but they give a
fair sampling of the kind of
imaginative program that high

ly motivated students can devel
op as they see possibilities for
designing their own educational
programs at Stanford."
Students could draw up inter
departmental degree programs
like these in consultation with
at least three professors in the
departments involved. These pro
fessors would serve as "a super
visory committee directing the
student's work" if his program
were approved by the dean of
humanities and sciences.
If the Academic Council ap
proves the proposal Jan. 5, the
dean of humanities and sciences
will start accepting petitions
from students. Up to 20 petitions
could be approved.
A title would be chosen for
each degree and the dean would
certify to the registrar that each
student in the experimental pro
gram had fulfilled his require
ments.
In addition to the requirements
for his major, each student
would have to meet general stu
dies and residence requirements.
Only students in good aca
demic standing would be per
mitted to submit interdepart
mental degree plans.
Not every "specially tailored

undergraduate major" would re
quire approval by the dean of
humanities and sciences. If a
single department agrees to
grant a degree for the program
a student wants to take, then
"the student would proceed to
deal with the department rather
than submit his proposal as a
cross-disciplinary one."
Contribution to SES
The deans describe the experi
ment as a contribution to the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES), which outlined a similar
proposal in its position paper
on undergraduate education Oct.
30.
SES said: "A limited number
of students, initially selected at
various stages of their under
graduate education on the basis
of exceptional promise, should be
given the option of designing
their entire undergraduate pro
gram free of all formal require
ments."
In their memorandum, the
deans argue "while the Study
is in progress it would be well
to have a modest experiment go
ing on to see how certain inter
disciplinary proposals might
work out for selected undergrad
uates."
