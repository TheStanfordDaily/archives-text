# UC Administration Stops Student Cash
## 
### RENTON ROLPH 
"We've been raped," was the
comment yesterday of UC Berk
eley student senator Norman
Pedersen over Chancellor Rog
er Heyns' decision to strip
the Associated Students (ASUC)
of their power to allocate $750,-
000 collected in student fees.
The administration of the fees
will be transferred, from the
Associated Students to the Union
Board, composed largely of uni
versity administration ap
pointees.
The student senate previously
wielded two essential powers: 1)
control over the $750,000 in fees
for operation of student govern
ment and also for student acti
vities, 2) authority over the man
agement of the Student Union.
Now without both these pow
ers, Senator Pedersen charged,
the ASUC Senate will retain
only an advisorial significance.
Chancellor Heyns indicated that
"in the future the Senate may
influence the Union Board."
Favorable Reaction
Several members of the stu
dent senate reacted favorably to
the Chancellor's move to trans
fer spending power, however.
Dick Bearhs, student body presi
dent, commented that the ruling
has given the ASUC government
the shakeup it has needed for a
long time.

His vice president, Ken Stahl,
indicated he was not especially
happy about the move, but he
claimed that the new spending
arrangement would free the Sen
ate to devote full-time to pro
grams of education reform and
community involvement.
This is the same involvement,
however, that many student lead
ers including Senator Pedersen
feel will be blocked under the
new arrangement to go into ef
fect next Fall quarter. There
were obviously two definitions
of "involvement."
Under the revised system the
student funds will be adminis
tered by the 16 members of the
Union Board which consists of
six members of the student gov
ernment, two faculty members,
representatives of alumni, the
Chancellor, the dean of students,
the graduate dean and one rep
resentative of non-academic em
ployees.
Concern Voiced
Concern was voiced at Berke
ley yesterday that the new sys
tem bring control of student
publications, supported by stu
dent fees, under the authority of
the administration. However,
the Chancellor has been careful
to avoid any censorship since
the 1964 uprising. A brief con
troversy did, in fact, develop
last year over the suspension of
one student writer.
