# NSA Dues Cut
## LASSU OK’s Judicial Plan 
### 
The student legislature, dis
satisfied with the present stu
dent Judicial system at Stan
ford, last night proposed a
brand new one.
LASSU also voted Stanford
out of the National Student As
sociation by rejecting an appro
priation for NSA dues.
In a resolution passed with
little opposition, the legislature
asked for a student-faculty ap
peals board consisting of
"three students, three faculty
members, and a member of the
law school" as chairman.
The board would replace the
University's Interim Judicial
Body (IJB), an all-faculty court,
which was formally denied rec

ognition by the legislature Nov.
21.
Before any student-faculty ap
peals board is formed, President
Wallace Sterling must agree to
abolish the IJB and appoint the
three faculty members to a new
board from a list of six nomi
nated by the Academic Council,
according to the LASSU reso
lution.
Differences of opinion on the
judicial system could be nego
tiated in the Committee of 15,
which has five student, five fac
ulty, and five administration
representatives. ASSU presi
dent Cesare Massarenti pro
posed such negotiations this
week, and the LASSU resolu
tion is tantamount to an au
thorization for the student rep
resentatives to bring up the ju
dicial issue at the Committee's
first meeting.
To Hear Appeals
Whatever appeals board finally
emerges, it will exist to hear
appeals from the student judi
cial council. Meanwhile, the IJB
will try students on appeals
filed by either the Dean of Stu
dents, who prosecutes students
in disciplinary cases, or the stu
dents themselves.
(The IJB is currently consid
ering the cases of ten students
charged with violating the Uni

versity demonstrations regula
tion in a CIA protest. See story
this page.)
In his report to LASSU, Mas
sarenti predicted difficulty in
dealing with the University ad
ministration in the upcoming
months because of expected ap
pointment of a new University
president.
He appointed an executive
committee of nine students to
advise and assist him. "We're
going to be equals," Massarenti
said of the committee.
The long-delayed student ad
visory committee to the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
was also appointed. Massarenti
will ask the nine members to
serve also on the newly acti
vated ASSU Education Commis
sion.
Massarenti Restrained
Massarenti, restrained in his
first appearance before LASSU
since succeeding Peter Lyman
as ASSU president Sunday,
pointed out his "numerous mis
takes in the past," and said, "I
am glad I have made them.
They've taught me a lesson."
The legislature voted down an
appropriation for $87.20 in Na
tional Student ABsoriation
(NSA) dues. An earlier dues ap
propriation had been approved
but turned out not to be enough.

According to Speaker Michael
Weinstein, the move effectively
ends Stanford's membership in
NSA. There was little debate on
the question.
LASSU decided to put a refer
endum on the next ASSU ballot,
stating, "All on-campus recruit
ing by military organizations
shall be suspended pending as
surances from the government
that students who interfere with
recruiting will not lose their
draft deferments."
The referendum does not men
tion other forms of punishment
of anti-recruiting demonstrators.
Both students and faculty will
vote on the question.
The referendum is expected
to be on the same ballot in Jan
uary as candidates for ASSU vice
president to replace Cesare Mas
sarenti. Massarenti assumed the
ASSU presidency Monday fol
lowing Peter Lyman's resigna
tion.
LASSU passed a resolution
that recruiters on campus be re
quired to take part in a public
discussion on their companies if
100 members of the Stanford
community petition it.
The resolution does not have
the effect of law, and presum
ably the policy would have to
be approved by the administra
tion to take effect.
Appropriation Approved
An appropriation for $1800
was approved to finance the In
ternational Society's symposium
on Foreign Intervention in Civil
Strife.
Two hundred dollars were
voted to support two jazz con
certs, one of which has already
taken place in Lagunita. The
concerts are informal affairs
taking place in the residences
lounges.
The legislature voted to allow
Speaker Weinstein to set up a
Student Demonstration By-Laws
Committee. The committee is in

tended to draw up a policy on
student demonstrations, since
none now exists in the ASSU
by-laws.
Also approved was a by-laws
change to allow the editor of
The Daily to set higher salaries
for staff members.
Details of the proposal were
contained in a lengthy report
from the Daily editorial board.
The changes were approved
unanimously by both the Publi
cations Board and the LASSU
By-Laws Committee. The report
had been distributed to LASSU
members two weeks ago.
Executive Committee
Massarenti announced forma
tion of an "executive commit
tee" to advise him. It will meet
weekly "on a regular basis."
The committee's members are
David Brown, graduate student
in business; John Ehrenberg,
legislature representative and
graduate in political science;
Chris Harte, junior in history;
Steve McMillan, legislature liai
son officer and junior in phi
losophy; David Miller, sopho
more; Amy Newell, junior in
anthropology; Michael Quinn,

Inter - Fraternity Council presi
dent and senior in physics; Mi
cha e 1 Weinstein, sophomore
speaker of the legislature; and
Art Wilson, sophomore.
Nine students were named to
the advisory committee to the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES). More may be added
later. The committee, whose ex
act role Massarenti did not spec
ity, will elect a chairman.
Its members are: Peter Ly
man, David Miller, Barry Je
rome, Andy Parnes, John Chat
terton, David Alkire, Gloria
Strauss, Bernard Wasow, and
Hugh MacMillan.
One bill and two resolutions
were referred to committee.
One resolution would have
asked the Judicial Council to
consider the case against the
ten anti-CIA demonstrators.
The ten students had been
charged with interfering with
on • campus recruiting by the
Central Intelligence Agency.
The case had been refused ear
lier by the Judicial Council and
was referred up to the all-fac
ulty Interim Judicial Body by
Dean of Students Joel Smith.

The resolution's constitution
ality was questioned and it was
referred to the Judicial Commit
tee of LASSU.

The second resolution re

judicial matters. It stated the
sense of the legislature was that

violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
The resolution also asked that
the Judicial Council decide in
every case involving University
policy if that policy conflicts
with ASSU policies.
This resolution also was re
ferred to the LASSU Judicial
Committee. It was questioned,
in debate, whether or not the
bill conflicted with existing in
terpretations of the by-laws.
The bill referred to the By-
Laws Committee dealt with a
procedural matter. It would re
quire anyone substituting at a
LASSU meeting for a member
to bring written permission oi
that member to the meeting
with him.

To Hear Appeals
Whatever appeals board finally
emerges, it will exist to hear
appeals from the student judi
cial council. Meanwhile, the IJB
will try students on appeals
filed by either the Dean of Stu
dents, who prosecutes students
in disciplinary cases, or the stu
dents themselves.
(The IJB is currently consid
ering the cases of ten students
charged with violating the Uni

versity demonstrations regula
tion in a CIA protest. See story

In his report to LASSU, Mas
sarenti predicted difficulty in
dealing with the University ad
ministration in the upcoming
months because of expected ap
pointment of a new University
president.
He appointed an executive
committee of nine students to
advise and assist him. "We're
going to be equals," Massarenti
said of the committee.
The long-delayed student ad
visory committee to the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
was also appointed. Massarenti
will ask the nine members to
serve also on the newly acti
vated ASSU Education Commis
sion.
Massarenti Restrained
Massarenti, restrained in his
first appearance before LASSU
since succeeding Peter Lyman
as ASSU president Sunday,
pointed out his "numerous mis
takes in the past," and said, "I
am glad I have made them.
They've taught me a lesson."
The legislature voted down an
appropriation for $87.20 in Na
tional Student ABsoriation
(NSA) dues. An earlier dues ap
propriation had been approved
but turned out not to be enough.

According to Speaker Michael
Weinstein, the move effectively
ends Stanford's membership in
NSA. There was little debate on
the question.
LASSU decided to put a refer
endum on the next ASSU ballot,
stating, "All on-campus recruit
ing by military organizations
shall be suspended pending as
surances from the government
that students who interfere with
recruiting will not lose their
draft deferments."
The referendum does not men
tion other forms of punishment
of anti-recruiting demonstrators.
Both students and faculty will
vote on the question.
The referendum is expected
to be on the same ballot in Jan
uary as candidates for ASSU vice
president to replace Cesare Mas
sarenti. Massarenti assumed the
ASSU presidency Monday fol
lowing Peter Lyman's resigna
tion.
LASSU passed a resolution
that recruiters on campus be re
quired to take part in a public
discussion on their companies if
100 members of the Stanford
community petition it.
The resolution does not have
the effect of law, and presum
ably the policy would have to
be approved by the administra
tion to take effect.
Appropriation Approved
An appropriation for $1800
was approved to finance the In
ternational Society's symposium
on Foreign Intervention in Civil
Strife.
Two hundred dollars were
voted to support two jazz con
certs, one of which has already
taken place in Lagunita. The
concerts are informal affairs
taking place in the residences
lounges.
The legislature voted to allow
Speaker Weinstein to set up a
Student Demonstration By-Laws
Committee. The committee is in

tended to draw up a policy on
student demonstrations, since
none now exists in the ASSU
by-laws.
Also approved was a by-laws
change to allow the editor of
The Daily to set higher salaries
for staff members.
Details of the proposal were
contained in a lengthy report
from the Daily editorial board.
The changes were approved
unanimously by both the Publi
cations Board and the LASSU
By-Laws Committee. The report
had been distributed to LASSU
members two weeks ago.
Executive Committee
Massarenti announced forma
tion of an "executive commit
tee" to advise him. It will meet
weekly "on a regular basis."
The committee's members are
David Brown, graduate student
in business; John Ehrenberg,
legislature representative and
graduate in political science;
Chris Harte, junior in history;
Steve McMillan, legislature liai
son officer and junior in phi
losophy; David Miller, sopho
more; Amy Newell, junior in
anthropology; Michael Quinn,

Inter - Fraternity Council presi
dent and senior in physics; Mi
cha e 1 Weinstein, sophomore
speaker of the legislature; and
Art Wilson, sophomore.
Nine students were named to
the advisory committee to the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES). More may be added
later. The committee, whose ex
act role Massarenti did not spec
ity, will elect a chairman.
Its members are: Peter Ly
man, David Miller, Barry Je
rome, Andy Parnes, John Chat
terton, David Alkire, Gloria
Strauss, Bernard Wasow, and
Hugh MacMillan.
One bill and two resolutions
were referred to committee.
One resolution would have
asked the Judicial Council to
consider the case against the
ten anti-CIA demonstrators.
The ten students had been
charged with interfering with
on • campus recruiting by the
Central Intelligence Agency.
The case had been refused ear
lier by the Judicial Council and
was referred up to the all-fac
ulty Interim Judicial Body by
Dean of Students Joel Smith.

The resolution's constitution
ality was questioned and it was
referred to the Judicial Commit
tee of LASSU.
Judicial Matters
The second resolution re
ferred also dealt with student
judicial matters. It stated the
sense of the legislature was that
the Judicial Council should con
sider all cases referred to it,
then decide if a case involves a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
The resolution also asked that
the Judicial Council decide in
every case involving University
policy if that policy conflicts
with ASSU policies.
This resolution also was re
ferred to the LASSU Judicial
Committee. It was questioned,
in debate, whether or not the
bill conflicted with existing in
terpretations of the by-laws.
The bill referred to the By-
Laws Committee dealt with a
procedural matter. It would re
quire anyone substituting at a
LASSU meeting for a member
to bring written permission oi
that member to the meeting
with him.
The student legislature, dis
satisfied with the present stu
dent Judicial system at Stan
ford, last night proposed a
brand new one.
LASSU also voted Stanford
out of the National Student As
sociation by rejecting an appro
priation for NSA dues.
In a resolution passed with
little opposition, the legislature
asked for a student-faculty ap
peals board consisting of
"three students, three faculty
members, and a member of the
law school" as chairman.
The board would replace the
University's Interim Judicial
Body (IJB), an all-faculty court,
which was formally denied rec

ognition by the legislature Nov.
21.
Before any student-faculty ap
peals board is formed, President
Wallace Sterling must agree to
abolish the IJB and appoint the
three faculty members to a new
board from a list of six nomi
nated by the Academic Council,
according to the LASSU reso
lution.
Differences of opinion on the
judicial system could be nego
tiated in the Committee of 15,
which has five student, five fac
ulty, and five administration
representatives. ASSU presi
dent Cesare Massarenti pro
posed such negotiations this
week, and the LASSU resolu
tion is tantamount to an au
thorization for the student rep
resentatives to bring up the ju
dicial issue at the Committee's
first meeting.

appropriation for $87.20 in Na
tional Student ABsoriation
(NSA) dues. An earlier dues ap
propriation had been approved
but turned out not to be enough.

According to Speaker Michael
Weinstein, the move effectively
ends Stanford's membership in
NSA. There was little debate on
the question.
LASSU decided to put a refer
endum on the next ASSU ballot,
stating, "All on-campus recruit
ing by military organizations
shall be suspended pending as
surances from the government
that students who interfere with
recruiting will not lose their
draft deferments."
The referendum does not men
tion other forms of punishment
of anti-recruiting demonstrators.
Both students and faculty will
vote on the question.
The referendum is expected
to be on the same ballot in Jan
uary as candidates for ASSU vice
president to replace Cesare Mas
sarenti. Massarenti assumed the
ASSU presidency Monday fol
lowing Peter Lyman's resigna
tion.
LASSU passed a resolution
that recruiters on campus be re
quired to take part in a public
discussion on their companies if
100 members of the Stanford
community petition it.
The resolution does not have
the effect of law, and presum
ably the policy would have to
be approved by the administra
tion to take effect.
Appropriation Approved
An appropriation for $1800
was approved to finance the In
ternational Society's symposium
on Foreign Intervention in Civil
Strife.
Two hundred dollars were
voted to support two jazz con
certs, one of which has already
taken place in Lagunita. The
concerts are informal affairs
taking place in the residences
lounges.
The legislature voted to allow
Speaker Weinstein to set up a
Student Demonstration By-Laws
Committee. The committee is in

tended to draw up a policy on
student demonstrations, since
none now exists in the ASSU
by-laws.
Also approved was a by-laws
change to allow the editor of
The Daily to set higher salaries
for staff members.
Details of the proposal were
contained in a lengthy report
from the Daily editorial board.
The changes were approved
unanimously by both the Publi
cations Board and the LASSU
By-Laws Committee. The report
had been distributed to LASSU
members two weeks ago.
Executive Committee
Massarenti announced forma
tion of an "executive commit
tee" to advise him. It will meet
weekly "on a regular basis."
The committee's members are
David Brown, graduate student
in business; John Ehrenberg,
legislature representative and
graduate in political science;
Chris Harte, junior in history;
Steve McMillan, legislature liai
son officer and junior in phi
losophy; David Miller, sopho
more; Amy Newell, junior in
anthropology; Michael Quinn,

Inter - Fraternity Council presi
dent and senior in physics; Mi
cha e 1 Weinstein, sophomore
speaker of the legislature; and
Art Wilson, sophomore.
Nine students were named to
the advisory committee to the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES). More may be added
later. The committee, whose ex
act role Massarenti did not spec
ity, will elect a chairman.
Its members are: Peter Ly
man, David Miller, Barry Je
rome, Andy Parnes, John Chat
terton, David Alkire, Gloria
Strauss, Bernard Wasow, and
Hugh MacMillan.
One bill and two resolutions
were referred to committee.
One resolution would have
asked the Judicial Council to
consider the case against the
ten anti-CIA demonstrators.
The ten students had been
charged with interfering with
on • campus recruiting by the
Central Intelligence Agency.
The case had been refused ear
lier by the Judicial Council and
was referred up to the all-fac
ulty Interim Judicial Body by
Dean of Students Joel Smith.

The resolution's constitution
ality was questioned and it was
referred to the Judicial Commit
tee of LASSU.
Judicial Matters
The second resolution re
ferred also dealt with student
judicial matters. It stated the
sense of the legislature was that
the Judicial Council should con
sider all cases referred to it,
then decide if a case involves a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
The resolution also asked that
the Judicial Council decide in
every case involving University
policy if that policy conflicts
with ASSU policies.
This resolution also was re
ferred to the LASSU Judicial
Committee. It was questioned,
in debate, whether or not the
bill conflicted with existing in
terpretations of the by-laws.
The bill referred to the By-
Laws Committee dealt with a
procedural matter. It would re
quire anyone substituting at a
LASSU meeting for a member
to bring written permission oi
that member to the meeting
with him.
The student legislature, dis
satisfied with the present stu
dent Judicial system at Stan
ford, last night proposed a
brand new one.
LASSU also voted Stanford
out of the National Student As
sociation by rejecting an appro
priation for NSA dues.
In a resolution passed with
little opposition, the legislature
asked for a student-faculty ap
peals board consisting of
"three students, three faculty
members, and a member of the
law school" as chairman.
The board would replace the
University's Interim Judicial
Body (IJB), an all-faculty court,
which was formally denied rec

ognition by the legislature Nov.
21.
Before any student-faculty ap
peals board is formed, President
Wallace Sterling must agree to
abolish the IJB and appoint the
three faculty members to a new
board from a list of six nomi
nated by the Academic Council,
according to the LASSU reso
lution.
Differences of opinion on the
judicial system could be nego
tiated in the Committee of 15,
which has five student, five fac
ulty, and five administration
representatives. ASSU presi
dent Cesare Massarenti pro
posed such negotiations this
week, and the LASSU resolu
tion is tantamount to an au
thorization for the student rep
resentatives to bring up the ju
dicial issue at the Committee's
first meeting.
To Hear Appeals
Whatever appeals board finally
emerges, it will exist to hear
appeals from the student judi
cial council. Meanwhile, the IJB
will try students on appeals
filed by either the Dean of Stu
dents, who prosecutes students
in disciplinary cases, or the stu
dents themselves.
(The IJB is currently consid
ering the cases of ten students
charged with violating the Uni

versity demonstrations regula
tion in a CIA protest. See story
this page.)
In his report to LASSU, Mas
sarenti predicted difficulty in
dealing with the University ad
ministration in the upcoming
months because of expected ap
pointment of a new University
president.
He appointed an executive
committee of nine students to
advise and assist him. "We're
going to be equals," Massarenti
said of the committee.
The long-delayed student ad
visory committee to the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
was also appointed. Massarenti
will ask the nine members to
serve also on the newly acti
vated ASSU Education Commis
sion.
Massarenti Restrained
Massarenti, restrained in his
first appearance before LASSU
since succeeding Peter Lyman
as ASSU president Sunday,
pointed out his "numerous mis
takes in the past," and said, "I
am glad I have made them.
They've taught me a lesson."

was approved to finance the In
ternational Society's symposium
on Foreign Intervention in Civil
Strife.
Two hundred dollars were
voted to support two jazz con
certs, one of which has already
taken place in Lagunita. The
concerts are informal affairs
taking place in the residences
lounges.
The legislature voted to allow
Speaker Weinstein to set up a
Student Demonstration By-Laws
Committee. The committee is in

tended to draw up a policy on
student demonstrations, since
none now exists in the ASSU
by-laws.
Also approved was a by-laws
change to allow the editor of
The Daily to set higher salaries
for staff members.
Details of the proposal were
contained in a lengthy report
from the Daily editorial board.
The changes were approved
unanimously by both the Publi
cations Board and the LASSU
By-Laws Committee. The report
had been distributed to LASSU
members two weeks ago.
Executive Committee
Massarenti announced forma
tion of an "executive commit
tee" to advise him. It will meet
weekly "on a regular basis."
The committee's members are
David Brown, graduate student
in business; John Ehrenberg,
legislature representative and
graduate in political science;
Chris Harte, junior in history;
Steve McMillan, legislature liai
son officer and junior in phi
losophy; David Miller, sopho
more; Amy Newell, junior in
anthropology; Michael Quinn,

Inter - Fraternity Council presi
dent and senior in physics; Mi
cha e 1 Weinstein, sophomore
speaker of the legislature; and
Art Wilson, sophomore.
Nine students were named to
the advisory committee to the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES). More may be added
later. The committee, whose ex
act role Massarenti did not spec
ity, will elect a chairman.
Its members are: Peter Ly
man, David Miller, Barry Je
rome, Andy Parnes, John Chat
terton, David Alkire, Gloria
Strauss, Bernard Wasow, and
Hugh MacMillan.
One bill and two resolutions
were referred to committee.
One resolution would have
asked the Judicial Council to
consider the case against the
ten anti-CIA demonstrators.
The ten students had been
charged with interfering with
on • campus recruiting by the
Central Intelligence Agency.
The case had been refused ear
lier by the Judicial Council and
was referred up to the all-fac
ulty Interim Judicial Body by
Dean of Students Joel Smith.

The resolution's constitution
ality was questioned and it was
referred to the Judicial Commit
tee of LASSU.
Judicial Matters
The second resolution re
ferred also dealt with student
judicial matters. It stated the
sense of the legislature was that
the Judicial Council should con
sider all cases referred to it,
then decide if a case involves a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard.
The resolution also asked that
the Judicial Council decide in
every case involving University
policy if that policy conflicts
with ASSU policies.
This resolution also was re
ferred to the LASSU Judicial
Committee. It was questioned,
in debate, whether or not the
bill conflicted with existing in
terpretations of the by-laws.
The bill referred to the By-
Laws Committee dealt with a
procedural matter. It would re
quire anyone substituting at a
LASSU meeting for a member
to bring written permission oi
that member to the meeting
with him.
The student legislature, dis
satisfied with the present stu
dent Judicial system at Stan
ford, last night proposed a
brand new one.
LASSU also voted Stanford
out of the National Student As
sociation by rejecting an appro
priation for NSA dues.
In a resolution passed with
little opposition, the legislature
asked for a student-faculty ap
peals board consisting of
"three students, three faculty
members, and a member of the
law school" as chairman.
The board would replace the
University's Interim Judicial
Body (IJB), an all-faculty court,
which was formally denied rec

ognition by the legislature Nov.
21.
Before any student-faculty ap
peals board is formed, President
Wallace Sterling must agree to
abolish the IJB and appoint the
three faculty members to a new
board from a list of six nomi
nated by the Academic Council,
according to the LASSU reso
lution.
Differences of opinion on the
judicial system could be nego
tiated in the Committee of 15,
which has five student, five fac
ulty, and five administration
representatives. ASSU presi
dent Cesare Massarenti pro
posed such negotiations this
week, and the LASSU resolu
tion is tantamount to an au
thorization for the student rep
resentatives to bring up the ju
dicial issue at the Committee's
first meeting.
To Hear Appeals
Whatever appeals board finally
emerges, it will exist to hear
appeals from the student judi
cial council. Meanwhile, the IJB
will try students on appeals
filed by either the Dean of Stu
dents, who prosecutes students
in disciplinary cases, or the stu
dents themselves.
(The IJB is currently consid
ering the cases of ten students
charged with violating the Uni

versity demonstrations regula
tion in a CIA protest. See story
this page.)
In his report to LASSU, Mas
sarenti predicted difficulty in
dealing with the University ad
ministration in the upcoming
months because of expected ap
pointment of a new University
president.
He appointed an executive
committee of nine students to
advise and assist him. "We're
going to be equals," Massarenti
said of the committee.
The long-delayed student ad
visory committee to the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
was also appointed. Massarenti
will ask the nine members to
serve also on the newly acti
vated ASSU Education Commis
sion.
Massarenti Restrained
Massarenti, restrained in his
first appearance before LASSU
since succeeding Peter Lyman
as ASSU president Sunday,
pointed out his "numerous mis
takes in the past," and said, "I
am glad I have made them.
They've taught me a lesson."
The legislature voted down an
appropriation for $87.20 in Na
tional Student ABsoriation
(NSA) dues. An earlier dues ap
propriation had been approved
but turned out not to be enough.

According to Speaker Michael
Weinstein, the move effectively
ends Stanford's membership in
NSA. There was little debate on
the question.
LASSU decided to put a refer
endum on the next ASSU ballot,
stating, "All on-campus recruit
ing by military organizations
shall be suspended pending as
surances from the government
that students who interfere with
recruiting will not lose their
draft deferments."
The referendum does not men
tion other forms of punishment
of anti-recruiting demonstrators.
Both students and faculty will
vote on the question.
The referendum is expected
to be on the same ballot in Jan
uary as candidates for ASSU vice
president to replace Cesare Mas
sarenti. Massarenti assumed the
ASSU presidency Monday fol
lowing Peter Lyman's resigna
tion.
LASSU passed a resolution
that recruiters on campus be re
quired to take part in a public
discussion on their companies if
100 members of the Stanford
community petition it.
The resolution does not have
the effect of law, and presum
ably the policy would have to
be approved by the administra
tion to take effect.
