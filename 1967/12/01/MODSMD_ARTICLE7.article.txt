# NSA Dues Cut
## LASSU OK’s Judicial Plan 
### 
The student legislature, dis
satisfied with the present stu
dent Judicial system at Stan
ford, last night proposed a
brand new one.
LASSU also voted Stanford
out of the National Student As
sociation by rejecting an appro
priation for NSA dues.
In a resolution passed with
little opposition, the legislature
asked for a student-faculty ap
peals board consisting of
"three students, three faculty
members, and a member of the
law school" as chairman.
The board would replace the
University's Interim Judicial
Body (IJB), an all-faculty court,
which was formally denied rec

ognition by the legislature Nov.
21.
Before any student-faculty ap
peals board is formed, President
Wallace Sterling must agree to
abolish the IJB and appoint the
three faculty members to a new
board from a list of six nomi
nated by the Academic Council,
according to the LASSU reso
lution.
Differences of opinion on the
judicial system could be nego
tiated in the Committee of 15,
which has five student, five fac
ulty, and five administration
representatives. ASSU presi
dent Cesare Massarenti pro
posed such negotiations this
week, and the LASSU resolu
tion is tantamount to an au
thorization for the student rep
resentatives to bring up the ju
dicial issue at the Committee's
first meeting.
To Hear Appeals
Whatever appeals board finally
emerges, it will exist to hear
appeals from the student judi
cial council. Meanwhile, the IJB
will try students on appeals
filed by either the Dean of Stu
dents, who prosecutes students
in disciplinary cases, or the stu
dents themselves.
(The IJB is currently consid
ering the cases of ten students
charged with violating the Uni

versity demonstrations regula
tion in a CIA protest. See story
this page.)
In his report to LASSU, Mas
sarenti predicted difficulty in
dealing with the University ad
ministration in the upcoming
months because of expected ap
pointment of a new University
president.
He appointed an executive
committee of nine students to
advise and assist him. "We're
going to be equals," Massarenti
said of the committee.
The long-delayed student ad
visory committee to the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
was also appointed. Massarenti
will ask the nine members to
serve also on the newly acti
vated ASSU Education Commis
sion.
Massarenti Restrained
Massarenti, restrained in his
first appearance before LASSU
since succeeding Peter Lyman
as ASSU president Sunday,
pointed out his "numerous mis
takes in the past," and said, "I
am glad I have made them.
They've taught me a lesson."
The legislature voted down an
appropriation for $87.20 in Na
tional Student ABsoriation
(NSA) dues. An earlier dues ap
propriation had been approved
but turned out not to be enough.

According to Speaker Michael
Weinstein, the move effectively
ends Stanford's membership in
NSA. There was little debate on
the question.
LASSU decided to put a refer
endum on the next ASSU ballot,
stating, "All on-campus recruit
ing by military organizations
shall be suspended pending as
surances from the government
that students who interfere with
recruiting will not lose their
draft deferments."
The referendum does not men
tion other forms of punishment
of anti-recruiting demonstrators.
Both students and faculty will
vote on the question.
The referendum is expected
to be on the same ballot in Jan
uary as candidates for ASSU vice
president to replace Cesare Mas
