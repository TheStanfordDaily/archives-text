# Johnson's Silence Means 1-A For Grads
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Happy new year, able-bodied
senior men and graduate stu
dents! You will all be classified
I A next June.
President Johnson has made
it clear through informal chan
nels he'll go ahead with plans
to eliminate draft deferments
for all graduate students, ex
cept medical students. Aft?r
months of uncertainty, he has
evidently decided against con
tinuing the 11-S deferment for
only science and engineering
students.
The 1967 draft law allowed
the President to add other grad
uate specialties besides medicine
to the deferment list if they
were "necessary to the mainten
ance of the national health,
safety or interest." But by his
silence, Johnson has indicated
he will add no further special
ties.
One question remains: What
percentage of eligible men will
be drafted out of graduate
schools? The Defense Depart
ment is expected to adopt a new
"order of call" which will make
19-year-old vulnerability equal
to that of older college gradu
ates.
The exact formula chosen will
determine whether as many as

60 per cent or as few as 20 per
cent of the older men will be
inducted.
New Formula
Virgil K. Whitaker, dean of
the graduate division, said he
expects announcement of a new
draft formula within the next
few months. Whitaker is "mod
erately hopeful" the Defense De
partment will direct local draft
boards to induct many more 19-
year-olds than college gradu
ates.
One group of graduate stu
dents will be allowed to keep
their 11-S d ferments. These are
students who began their sec
ond year of graduate study be
fore Oct. 1, 1967. The draft law
gives them a total of two years
to earn a masters or five years
for a doctorate.
But all other graduate stu
dents, and new college gradu
ates, will be reclassified I-A
when their present 11-S defer
ments expire. For one year the
student will be vulnerable to in
duction in the first order of call.
After that, his chances of being
drafted will be "considerably
less," according to Whitaker, be
cause a new class of college
graduates will be eligible before
him.
Undergraduates are guaran

teed 11-S deferments by the 1967
law as long as they maintain
"satisfactory" progress. This
blanket exemption leaves two
groups vulnerable—l9-year-olds
who don't enter college, and rec
ent college graduates.
Presently the law directs
draft boards to take the oldest
men first. This policy is likely
to be abandoned, because the re
sult would be drafting "every
able-bodied man" out of grad
uate school, Whitaker said.
Johnson, through the Def nse
Department, is expected to
designate a "prime age group"
—19-year-olds—as the first to be
called. But the 1967 law requires
that students whose 11-S defer
ments lapse be "considered as
being within the age group
called regardless of their actual
age."
Older students will be called
"constructive 19-year-olds" and
