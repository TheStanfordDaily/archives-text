# CIA Pickets Sent To Judicial Council
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Judicial Council "exelusiv ori
ginal jurisdiction" in all cases
involving student conduct, ex
cept where a conflict exists be
tween ASSU and University po
licies or where the student in
volved wishes his case decided
by the dean of students.
The Judicial Council decided
nevertheless not to hear the
case of the anti-CIA demonstra
tors because, it said, a finding
of innocence would most likely
be overturned by the IJB.
The council said it felt the
IJB had previously misinter
preted ASSU By-Laws, and
therefore the council would re
fuse to act until the ASSU legi
slature clarified the by laws in
tent.
The IJB had decided in an
earlier case that any violation of
a University policy was per se
a violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the general code of
student behavior which the Judi
cial Council is supposed to en
force.
This interpretation was reject
ed by the student legislature af
ter the council's decision not to
hear the anti-CIA demonstra
tor's case.
The IJB, in its Dec. 5 decision,
said this action by the legisla
ture was irrelevant to the case
already pending.

The disciplinary case of ten
students who demonstrated
against the Central Intelligence
Agency Nov. 1 has been returned
by the all-faculty Interim Judi
cial Body (IJB) to the all-stu
dent ASSU Judicial Council.
In a 3-2 decision Dec. 5, the
IJB ordered the Judicial Coun
cil to make a judgment by Feb.
1.
Previously the Judicial Coun
cil had refused to hear the case.
Dean of Students Joel Smith,
acting as prosecutor, then took
it to the IJB.
The students, nine of whom
refused to appear at the Dec. 5
IJB meeting, are charged with
illegally demonstrating against
CIA job recruiting at Encina
Hall.
On? student is also charged
with "recklessly" shoving a sign
through the front door of Encina,
"narrowly missing the head of
an individual who was on the
other side of the door."
In deciding to hand the case
back to the Judicial Council, the
IJB said, "The sole basis for
this order is the desirability of
utilization of student participa
tion in disciplinary matters."
Council Takes Case
The Judicial Council decided
Dec. 4 to take the case up again
and informed Dean Smith of its
opinion the next day. The council
has had no formal relations with
the IJB since the ASSU Legis
lature withdrew recognition of
any all-faculty appeals board
last November.
Dean Smith objected to the
council's change of mind to hear
the d case. He told
the IJB "the self-styled terms
under which the council would
hear the case" were "a misun
derstanding of the council's re
sponibility."
The ASSU By-Laws give the
