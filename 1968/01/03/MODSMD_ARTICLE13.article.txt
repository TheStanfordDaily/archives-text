# Rusk Isn't Coming
## 
### 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk has cancelled
his speech here next week, reportedly fearing
violent demonstrations. It is a sensible way to
start the new year, for in 1967 Stanford was
firmly established as a no man's land for Admini
stration speakers.
After Vice President Hubert Humphrey visit
ed Stanford last February, he told U.S. News
(fyid World Report he was confronted by "hooli
gans — just a group of ruffians who decided to
exercise their protest in a violent and unsavory
rt a n n e r." Undersecretary of State Katzen-
Hach spoke here last quarter in what was con
fidentially referred to as a "dry run" for the Rusk
\ssit.
« Evidently students did not behave well
enough, for Rusk has cancelled his speech after
consulting with President Sterling. He apparent
ly fears violence and hooliganism.
1 The idea that visitors are not safe when they
come to the Stanford campus is repulsive. How
ever, an investigation after the Humphrey inci
dent showed the hooliganism that was head
lined nationally was reported by one wire service
correspondent who did not see the incident and
not reported by another who did see what hap
pened.
But the truth is that violent demonstrations
might well have greeted Secretary Rusk on this

visit. President Sterling apparently gave him
correct advice that speaking at Stanford would
be unwise.
Why should there be a danger in coming to
Stanford? We certainly affirm that anyone should
be able to speak on campus without fear of in
terruption or harm. To deny this is to insult aca
demic freedom and the critical intelligence of
all who make up the Stanford community.
But the person who comes to the University
must assume a responsibility also. He must be
willing to enter into a dialogue openly and hon
estly.
We do not feel Dean Rusk would have done
this and therefore his visit itself would have been
an insult to the critical intelligence of the Stan
ford community. In recent months he has re
fused to discuss the issue of Vietnam candidly,
and has reverted to uttering platitudes that have
obscured rather than clarified the issue of Viet
nam.
One might well argue that the community does
not owe him any more respect and courtesy than
he has recently shown other audiences. We do
not condone violent demonstrations but believe
the threat of them must be understood as a
response to the way Dean Rusk and the Admini
stration have treated the American people. In
any case, it is better that Rusk stay home.

rt a n n e r." Undersecretary of State Katzen-
Hach spoke here last quarter in what was con
fidentially referred to as a "dry run" for the Rusk
\ssit.
« Evidently students did not behave well
enough, for Rusk has cancelled his speech after
consulting with President Sterling. He apparent
ly fears violence and hooliganism.
1 The idea that visitors are not safe when they
come to the Stanford campus is repulsive. How
ever, an investigation after the Humphrey inci
dent showed the hooliganism that was head
lined nationally was reported by one wire service
correspondent who did not see the incident and
not reported by another who did see what hap
pened.
But the truth is that violent demonstrations
might well have greeted Secretary Rusk on this

visit. President Sterling apparently gave him
correct advice that speaking at Stanford would
be unwise.
Why should there be a danger in coming to
Stanford? We certainly affirm that anyone should
be able to speak on campus without fear of in
terruption or harm. To deny this is to insult aca
demic freedom and the critical intelligence of
all who make up the Stanford community.
But the person who comes to the University
must assume a responsibility also. He must be
willing to enter into a dialogue openly and hon
estly.
We do not feel Dean Rusk would have done
this and therefore his visit itself would have been
an insult to the critical intelligence of the Stan
ford community. In recent months he has re
fused to discuss the issue of Vietnam candidly,
and has reverted to uttering platitudes that have
obscured rather than clarified the issue of Viet
nam.
One might well argue that the community does
not owe him any more respect and courtesy than
he has recently shown other audiences. We do
not condone violent demonstrations but believe
the threat of them must be understood as a
response to the way Dean Rusk and the Admini
stration have treated the American people. In
any case, it is better that Rusk stay home.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk has cancelled
his speech here next week, reportedly fearing
violent demonstrations. It is a sensible way to
start the new year, for in 1967 Stanford was
firmly established as a no man's land for Admini
stration speakers.
After Vice President Hubert Humphrey visit
ed Stanford last February, he told U.S. News
(fyid World Report he was confronted by "hooli
gans — just a group of ruffians who decided to
exercise their protest in a violent and unsavory
rt a n n e r." Undersecretary of State Katzen-
