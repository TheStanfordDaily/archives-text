# Kennedy Plots Abound
## 
### Max Lerner 
After the fourth anniversary
of President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, the river of books
on it keep rolling along. One
man who doubtlessly has been
reading all the new ones is Dist.
Atty. Jim Garrison of New Or
leans, who has entered on a
monumental and endless hegira
in quest of a New Orleans plot
to kill the President. Certainly
he has read Harold Weisberg's
new paperback, "Oswald in New
Orleans: Case of Conspiracy
With (he CIA," which T infer
from the fact he wrote a fore
word for it and also from his
heavy reliance on Weisberg's
two earlier hooks ("Whitewash
I" and "Whitewash II".)
If he has also read Sylvia
Meagher's "Accessories After
the Fact," he will find a good
deal of common ground in her
long, knowledgeable and highly
detailed indictment of the War
ren Commission, although he
will be depressed at the author's
blast in her closing pages
against Garrison's own methods
and against the Warren critics
who support him, "condoning
tactics which they might not
condone on the part of others."
Finally, he must have read
Josiah Thompson's "Six Seconds
in Dallas," which I discussed
in my last piece and which re
constructs a deathtrap by three
gunmen rather similar to the
plan for a "triangulated" firing
which Garrison has attributed
to Dave Ferrie, presumably the
"mastermind" of the New Or
leans plot. Ferrie either died
naturally or killed himself be
fore Garrison could arrest him,
and Garrison has been trying
ever since to nail down the plot
without the master-plotter.
For most of the anti-Warren
authors, as for Garrison him
self, there are two plots that
seem to worry them: one is
whatever version of an anti-
Kennedy plot they plump for;

the other is a presumed govern
ment plot (through the commis
sion itself, the FBI, the Justice
Department and the CIA to keep
the truth about the assassination
plot hidden from the people).
Some form of an anti-Kennedy
plot now seems possible to me,
but I confess that I cannot see
a government plot to
cover up the crime and protect
the criminals.
What I see instead is a bias
toward a single-assassin theory
on the part of the commission
and its staff, because they were
in a hurry and because it fitted
more facts than any other
theory. Once they had adopted
this position, they were not over
anxious to follow up leads that
might unsettle it.
In addition, the underground
agencies—Fßl and ClA—may
well have had additional reasons
for not wanting some of their
past activities exposed to public
view, for the same reason that
every secret agency in the world
finds ways of shielding itself
from exposure and humiliation.

of the major nations today, see
the shrewdly informative new
hook by David Wise and Thomas
B. Ross, "The Espionage Estab
lishment.")

Garrison's foreward to the
Weisberg book, in which he
says nothing about the book
itself, is a brilliantly sulhpurous
attack on the American govern
ment agencies in Orwellian
terms, as "Big Brother" and the
"Ministry of Truth," involved
in "a thought-control project in
the best traditions of '1984' " and
intent on rewriting the history of
the past (the assassination) in
order to control the future.
The excessiveness of his lan
guage may be an index also of
the excessiveness of his methods
in trying to crack the New Or
leans "plot" of which he has.

convinced himself beyond doubt
and redress. He has gone too
far to retreat: "they must con
quer or die who have no re
treat." The array of opponents
he has taken on marks him as
reckless or quixotic. I read Weis
berg's new book eagerly and
was not even too badly hobbled
by his chaotic sequence and his
endless diversions because I
wanted to discover what his
friend Garrison had developed
in terms of broad strategy or
hard evidence since I talked
with him in New Orleans.
What I found to my delight
were two long documentary por
traits of Dean Andrews, the
"jive-talking lawyer" who had
done some legal work for Lee
Harvey Oswald in New Orleans.
This is the Andrews who told of
knowing a "Clay Bertrand"
whom Garrison is intent on
proving to have been Clay Shaw,
now awaiting trial. His inter
view with Wesley Liebeler, the
Warren Commission staff mem
ber, and even more his telephone
interview with Bob Scott, of
radio station WNAC in Boston,
are the stuff of great documen
tary literature, with a racy An
drews style of talking that puts
all the hep-cat novelists to
shame.
★ ★ ★
But this gaiety is less than
proof, nor do the attacks on the
single-assassin version add up to
an alternative scenario of who
the actual plotters were and why
they killed Mr. Kennedy. That
remains for the years ahead, if
ever. The Warren Commission,
whatever its detailed mistakes,
made one massive blunder—that
of closing its inquiry. It should
have rendered an interim "not
proven" report that kept the in
quiry open-ended until the pieces
fitted into a better pattern than
they did then or now.

After the fourth anniversary
of President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, the river of books
on it keep rolling along. One
man who doubtlessly has been
reading all the new ones is Dist.
Atty. Jim Garrison of New Or
leans, who has entered on a
monumental and endless hegira
in quest of a New Orleans plot
to kill the President. Certainly
he has read Harold Weisberg's
new paperback, "Oswald in New
Orleans: Case of Conspiracy
With (he CIA," which T infer
from the fact he wrote a fore
word for it and also from his
heavy reliance on Weisberg's
two earlier hooks ("Whitewash
I" and "Whitewash II".)
If he has also read Sylvia
Meagher's "Accessories After
the Fact," he will find a good
deal of common ground in her
long, knowledgeable and highly
detailed indictment of the War
ren Commission, although he
will be depressed at the author's
blast in her closing pages
against Garrison's own methods
and against the Warren critics
who support him, "condoning
tactics which they might not
condone on the part of others."
Finally, he must have read
Josiah Thompson's "Six Seconds
in Dallas," which I discussed
in my last piece and which re
constructs a deathtrap by three
gunmen rather similar to the
plan for a "triangulated" firing
which Garrison has attributed
to Dave Ferrie, presumably the
"mastermind" of the New Or
leans plot. Ferrie either died
naturally or killed himself be
fore Garrison could arrest him,
and Garrison has been trying
ever since to nail down the plot
without the master-plotter.
For most of the anti-Warren
authors, as for Garrison him
self, there are two plots that
seem to worry them: one is
whatever version of an anti-
Kennedy plot they plump for;

the other is a presumed govern
ment plot (through the commis
sion itself, the FBI, the Justice
Department and the CIA to keep
the truth about the assassination
plot hidden from the people).
Some form of an anti-Kennedy
plot now seems possible to me,
but I confess that I cannot see
a government plot to
cover up the crime and protect
the criminals.
What I see instead is a bias
toward a single-assassin theory
on the part of the commission
and its staff, because they were
in a hurry and because it fitted
more facts than any other
theory. Once they had adopted
this position, they were not over
anxious to follow up leads that
might unsettle it.
In addition, the underground
agencies—Fßl and ClA—may
well have had additional reasons
for not wanting some of their
past activities exposed to public
view, for the same reason that
every secret agency in the world
finds ways of shielding itself
from exposure and humiliation.

of the major nations today, see

all the hep-cat novelists to

But this gaiety is less than

single-assassin version add up to
an alternative scenario of who
the actual plotters were and why
they killed Mr. Kennedy. That

whatever its detailed mistakes,

After the fourth anniversary
of President John F. Kennedy's
assassination, the river of books
on it keep rolling along. One
man who doubtlessly has been
reading all the new ones is Dist.
Atty. Jim Garrison of New Or
leans, who has entered on a
monumental and endless hegira
in quest of a New Orleans plot
to kill the President. Certainly
he has read Harold Weisberg's
new paperback, "Oswald in New
Orleans: Case of Conspiracy
With (he CIA," which T infer
from the fact he wrote a fore
word for it and also from his
heavy reliance on Weisberg's
two earlier hooks ("Whitewash
I" and "Whitewash II".)
If he has also read Sylvia
Meagher's "Accessories After
the Fact," he will find a good
deal of common ground in her
long, knowledgeable and highly
detailed indictment of the War
ren Commission, although he
will be depressed at the author's
blast in her closing pages
against Garrison's own methods
and against the Warren critics
who support him, "condoning
tactics which they might not
condone on the part of others."
Finally, he must have read
Josiah Thompson's "Six Seconds
in Dallas," which I discussed
in my last piece and which re
constructs a deathtrap by three
gunmen rather similar to the
plan for a "triangulated" firing
which Garrison has attributed
to Dave Ferrie, presumably the
"mastermind" of the New Or
leans plot. Ferrie either died
naturally or killed himself be
fore Garrison could arrest him,
and Garrison has been trying
ever since to nail down the plot
without the master-plotter.
For most of the anti-Warren
authors, as for Garrison him
self, there are two plots that
seem to worry them: one is
whatever version of an anti-
Kennedy plot they plump for;

the other is a presumed govern
ment plot (through the commis
sion itself, the FBI, the Justice
Department and the CIA to keep
the truth about the assassination
plot hidden from the people).
Some form of an anti-Kennedy
plot now seems possible to me,
but I confess that I cannot see
a government plot to
cover up the crime and protect
the criminals.
What I see instead is a bias
toward a single-assassin theory
on the part of the commission
and its staff, because they were
in a hurry and because it fitted
more facts than any other
theory. Once they had adopted
this position, they were not over
anxious to follow up leads that
might unsettle it.
In addition, the underground
agencies—Fßl and ClA—may
well have had additional reasons
for not wanting some of their
past activities exposed to public
view, for the same reason that
every secret agency in the world
finds ways of shielding itself
from exposure and humiliation.
(For instances from the record
of the major nations today, see
the shrewdly informative new
hook by David Wise and Thomas
B. Ross, "The Espionage Estab
lishment.")
