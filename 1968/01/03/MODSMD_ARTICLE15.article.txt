## The 						Difficult Art Of Change 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
There is nothing wrong with
being a Dave Harris or a Peter
Lyman. Indeed there is so much
right about it that many of us
(both under thirty, and over
thirty) are saddened by the de
feat, discouragement, and disil
lusionment that both Dave and
Peter experienced.
And there is nothing wrong
about resigning a responsibility
when one feels that he has reach
ed the limit of his usefulness in
terms of his particular talents
for implementing that useful
ness.
But there is something to be
learned from the experience of
these two men, both of them
pushed reluctantly into the foray
of political action, both of them
as articulate, bright, courageous,
sincere as any student leader
Stanford has produced in many
a year.
The talents of a prophet are
not usually the same as those
of an administrator. The vision
of the possible is not the same
as the art of the possible — and
change requires both the vision
and the art. I think it time to
focus on the latter.
It is time to focus on process
—tireless, patient, negotiation
with a tolerance for machinery;
insistent one-to-one communica
tion; grass-roots stuff; vision
anchored to a broad base of arti
culate community concern. This
is a different kind of work from
"position papers" and lofty cere
bration.
It is time, too, to play down
this contrived dichotomy of ac
tivists versus "Establishment."
Establishment has become a
dirty word, but the members of
it are not all dirty people — nor
people trapped by their own
"bureaucratic" devices. There
are sensitive idealists and frus
trated activists even among the
Establishment. And a sensible,
objective reading of the recent
SES report suggests that among
its authors there must have been
some sheer revolutionaries!
There is an art to accomplish
ing change — it does not include
stigmatizing the Establishment
and forcing it into the role of
adversary. Fear does not breed
change; trust may.
For every Peter Lyman, this
campus needs at least 500 equal
ly informed and concerned stu
dents at the grassroots level to
accomplish the footwork of
change. This has to be footwork
in which students communicate
with and trust the so-called
Establishment, recognizing that
it, too, is concerned ,sincere,
idealistic, and frustrated.
I think Peter Lyman is won
dering "Where are these 500?"
And so is SES.

• Fellow Americans
Editor, The Daily:
Like most of you, I am just
an ordinary citizen, who has
watched the activities of the
Peaceniks with growing alarm.
I have tried to be patient; I
have tried to be tolerant; but
their impudence is more than
I can bear. I will no longer stand
by and watch these deviants de
file the glory of our fighting
men in Vietnam. The time has
come to act!
One is tempted to call for their
arrest as traitors, but this would
only make them martyrs. More
over, such action overlooks the
fundamental cause of the prob

lem — namely, Christianity. Yes,
Christianity. Consider for a mo
ment how our young people are
encouraged to worship an un
kempt, deluded vagabond as a
hero! Their minds are filled with
tales of his witchcraft, wine
drinking, and hallucinatory
fasts. They're told not to kill or
covet, and are frankly urged to
love their enemies.
Furthermore, our youth are
taught to idealize communalism
and humility, poverty and paci
fism — all of which are clearly
un-American. Thus, it is Christ
ianity which is the underlying
threat to the war effort, and a

grave menace to the American
way of life.

• Wives Welcome
Editor, The Daily:
Thank you for you informed
and sensitive article on programs
and activities at the Bechtel In
ternational Center which appear
ed in the November 21 issue of
The Dally.
There is just one item I would
like to clarify. A student was
quoted as saying, "If you're
married, your wife can't come
here." Not true — either in a

general or a specific sense. All
Stanford students and their
wives and families are most wel
come at the International Center.
In fact, special programs and
coffee hours for the wives of
foreign and American students
are planned by the International
Dames and held weekly at the
I Center. In addition, many
wives participate in programs
such as English in Action (Eng
lish conversational practice)
and contribute greatly to the
success of the Saturday Evening
Abroad presentations.
