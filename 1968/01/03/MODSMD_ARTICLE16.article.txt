# New Columns
## 
### 
Two new national columnists
will start this week In the
DAILY.
Henry J. Taylor's and Max
Lerner's syndicated columns
will appear several times a wek.
Both writers deal with national
political and economic issues.
The weekly Feiffer cartoon
will also begin soon.
All DAILY columns express
the opinion of the writer only,
and in no way represent the
views of the DAILY editorial
board.
