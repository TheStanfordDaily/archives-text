# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Last Year's Words Of Wisdom 
### Art Buchwald 
Many things were said in 1967,
and some of them got a lot of
people in trouble. But the only
thing the people who uttered
them can do at this late stage is
to bite their tongues.
For example, suppose you
were the person who said to Gov.
George Romney: "I've got an
idea, Governor, Why don't you
tell the American people you
were brainwashed in Vietnam?"
Or the one who said to Mayor
John Lindsay: "Mayor, have you
ever thought of having the city's
reservoirs cleaned?"
Or the man who said to Sec
retary of Defense Robert Mc-
Namara: "Why don't you, as a
gag, tell the President you'd like
to head up the World Bank?"
Or the Soviet official who said
to President Nasser: "Mr. Presi
dent, my suggestion is to close
the Gulf of Aqaba to the Israelis.
How the hell could they possibly
retaliate?"
Little Shirley
Or the politician who said to
Shirley Temple Black: "Of
course you can win if you run

for Congress. Do you think peo
ple are going to vote against
little Shirley Temple?"
Or the fellow who suggested
to Canada's Prime Minister Les
ter Pearson: "Why don't you in
vite Gen. De Gaulle to visit Que
bec during Expo '67? It's bound
to improve Franco-Canadian re
lations."
Or the economist who assured
Secretary of Treasury Fowler:
"I'd stake my life on it. The Bri
tish would never devalue the
pound."
And lest we forget, the Red
Chinese Communist theoretician
who said to Mao Tsetung: "I
think what this country needs is
a cultural revolution."
Or the police official who said
to Detroit Mayor Jerome Cava
nagh, "Mayor, there's a little
riot downtown, but we've got it
under control."
Not to mention the general
who said to King Constantine of
Greece: "Today's the day to
throw over the junta."
Yes, Yes, Yes
Or the British diplomat who

told Prime Minister Marold Wil
son: "Now is the time to ask
De Gaulle if you can get into the
Common Market. He'll have to
say yes."
And what about the frierd of
Frank Sinatra's who said to him
in the Las Vegas casino: "Are
you going to let Howard Hughes
cut off your credit without put
ting up a fight?"
Or the lawyer who defended
Ralph Ginzburg in his porno
graphy trial and said: "Even if
the lower court decides against
you, Ralph, the Supreme Court
has got to overthrow the deci
sion."
Or the man who advised Sec
retary of State Rusk: "The more
you speak on college campuses,
the better chance you'll have of
convincing the kids of your
policy in Vietnam."
And finally, how would you
like to have been the White
House aide who said to Presi
dent Johnson: "I want you to
hear a sermon by a new minister
in Williamsburg, Va. They say
he's terrific."

to head up the World Bank?"
Or the Soviet official who said
to President Nasser: "Mr. Presi
dent, my suggestion is to close

And lest we forget, the Red
Chinese Communist theoretician
who said to Mao Tsetung: "I

a cultural revolution."
Or the police official who said
to Detroit Mayor Jerome Cava
nagh, "Mayor, there's a little
riot downtown, but we've got it
under control."
Not to mention the general
who said to King Constantine of
Greece: "Today's the day to

Many things were said in 1967,
and some of them got a lot of
people in trouble. But the only
