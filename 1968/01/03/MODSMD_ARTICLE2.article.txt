## 
### 
Pat McMahon, DAILY maga
zine editor, obtained an exclu
sive interview Dee, 29 with Lt.
Gen. Iyewis B. Hershey, director
of Selective Service. Other de
tails of the interview will ap
pear in the magazine Jan. 12.
McMahon's report:
Gen. Hershey expressed doubt
that the National Security Coun
cil would accept the recommen
dation of the Interagency com
mittee that only graduate stu
dents in the sciences, mathe
matics, and engineering be de
ferred.
"It doesn't take long to ap
prove something and they've had
the report nearly six weeks, so
they may be up to something."
Hershey added, however, that

"it is a new format, so there is
no use trying to us"> history for
guessing what will happen. The
National Security Council never
had this responsibility
an I no one knows what they
might do."
"We've been on the pan for
quite a little while," he pointed
out. "We have them graduating
in December, at the end of the
semester, and at the of the
trimester, which could b"> just
about anytime."
Hershey spoke about a recent
trip to Ohio where he spoke to
presidents of colleges and uni
versities in that state. "What
th°y mentioned, which was a sur
prise to me and I'm sure to
many people on the Hill, was

that there will also be a shortage
of teachers since many graduate
students teach also."
"There is anxiety on two
parts," the General said. "They
need graduate students to teach
and they need graduate students
to do research on the grants
they get from the government
and from other places."

testors be denied their defer
ments.
The council's executive com
mittee unanimously passed the
resolution Dec. 7. The committee
said:
"Our action is not intended in
any sense as a reflection upon
the recruiting practices of the
armed services, but is an expres
sion of the University's objection
to the use of the draft to supress
dissent."
Hershey recommended induc
tion as punishment for "illegal
activity which interferes with re
cruiting." The White House later
denied that the draft would be
used in place of courts, but
Hershey refused to retract his
letter.

The council's executive com
mittee unanimously passed the
resolution Dec. 7. The committee
said:
"Our action is not intended in
any sense as a reflection upon
the recruiting practices of the
armed services, but is an expres
sion of the University's objection
to the use of the draft to supress
dissent."
Hershey recommended induc
tion as punishment for "illegal
activity which interferes with re
cruiting." The White House later
denied that the draft would be
used in place of courts, but
Hershey refused to retract his
letter.
Pat McMahon, DAILY maga
zine editor, obtained an exclu
sive interview Dee, 29 with Lt.
Gen. Iyewis B. Hershey, director
of Selective Service. Other de
tails of the interview will ap
pear in the magazine Jan. 12.
McMahon's report:
Gen. Hershey expressed doubt
that the National Security Coun
cil would accept the recommen
dation of the Interagency com
mittee that only graduate stu
dents in the sciences, mathe
matics, and engineering be de
ferred.
"It doesn't take long to ap
prove something and they've had
the report nearly six weeks, so
they may be up to something."
Hershey added, however, that

"it is a new format, so there is
no use trying to us"> history for
guessing what will happen. The
National Security Council never
had this responsibility
an I no one knows what they
might do."
"We've been on the pan for
quite a little while," he pointed
out. "We have them graduating
in December, at the end of the
semester, and at the of the
trimester, which could b"> just
about anytime."
Hershey spoke about a recent
trip to Ohio where he spoke to
presidents of colleges and uni
versities in that state. "What
th°y mentioned, which was a sur
prise to me and I'm sure to
many people on the Hill, was

that there will also be a shortage
of teachers since many graduate
students teach also."
"There is anxiety on two
parts," the General said. "They
need graduate students to teach
and they need graduate students
to do research on the grants
they get from the government
and from other places."
