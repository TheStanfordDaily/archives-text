### 
Chester A. Berry, director of
Tresidder Memorial Union since
its drawing-board days in 1959,
has requested a two-year leave
of absence effective March 1.
He has accepted a position
as executive secretary of the As

ternational (ACUI), which has
900 institutional members in the
United Stats and Canada and 50
others overseas.
Berry, president of the asso
ciation in 1960, was a key mem

committee which helped design
the $2.6 million building. The
union officially opened for cam
pus activities Sept. 17, 1962.
He expects to divide his time
equally between Tresidder Un
ion and the ACUI for the spring
and summer, going to full-time

of his time will be spent in on
the-job travel.
Berry, who has also served
as manager of the Stanford Fac
ulty Club, came to Stanford from
the University of Rhode Island,
his alma mater. He was director
of their union and had previous
ly served as director of student
activities.
