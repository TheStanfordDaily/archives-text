# New Sit-ins Block Induction Center
## 
### MICHAEL MORTON (First of Two Parts 
More than 20 Stanford fac
ulty, staff, and students were
among 285 persons arrested In
he sit-ins of December 18 and
19 at the Oakland Induction
Center.
A crowd estimated at between
1500 and 2000 demonstrators re
turned to the 15th and Clay Sts.
building, processing center for
all northern California induc
tees, two months and two days
after "Stop the Draft Week" to
protest the Vietnam war and
the Selective Service System.
The generally peaceful Christ
mas spirit which prevailed
among both demonstrators and
policemen apparently did not
-•xtend to Judge Delmar Brobst.
The judge allowed no state
ments by defendants, other than
the consistent plea of nolo con
tendere (no contest), and slap
ped an extra 30-day sentence on
one protestor who taiked back.
The judge imposed a standard
. 0-day sentence on first time
offenders, as opposed to the 10-
day sentences given out in Oc
tober, and hit those previously
arrested in draft protests with
a 90-day sentence, 45 days of
which were suspended, and a
year of probation.
Disturbing The Peace
Charges of failure to disperse,
interfering and obstructing a
public thoroughfare, and tres
passing were dismissed, as they
had been in October, leaving
only the charge of disturbing
the peace to be logged against
the defendants.
Only a handful of the arrested
persons posted bail during the
one or two days they awaited
trial. The judge took into con
sideration the day that the dem
onstrators had already spent in
ia.il and reduced sentences one
day.
The tone of tho two-day sit-in,
organized by the War Resisters
League (WRL) and the Civil
Action Day Committee (CADC)
was summarized by two cum
laude graduates of Harvard Uni
versity, Randy Kehler and Jim
riacco.
"We're not trying to close
down the center. We know we
can't do that," they said. But,
they added, by blocking the en
trances and interdicting the
buses carrying inductees and
employees, they could create the
pause needed for a search of
conscience.
Abnormal Monday
By 6:30 a.m., the atmosphere
at 15th and Clay in Oakland was
noticeably different from that of
a normal Monday morning. And
he difference was not only in
the pouring rain and bone-chill
ing wind.
Lines of support pickets, car
rying flowers instead of the
placards in evidence in October
and chanting Christmas carols
rather than "Hell No, We Won't
Go", were forming on the side
walks facing the induction cen

ter. A few policemen were mill
ing about, with night sticks and
tear gas of two months ago con
spicuous by their absence.
At 6:30, four busloads of dem
onstrators arrived, among them
the "Stanford Faculty and Staff
for Peace in Vietnam," a group
according to Political Science
Professor Charles Drekmeier,
formed two years ago at a
teach-in to protest the Vietnam
war. Among those with Drek
meier were Professors Julian
Davidson and Gerald Hiken, and
Rachelle Marshall, wife of Poli.
Sci. Prof. Hubert Marshall.
The first response from the
police came shortly after 7:00,
when a dozen protestors block
ing the 15th St. door were ar
rested and escorted to a waiting
van. The move apparently took
the sitters-in by surprise, but
they offered no resistance, and
the police responded with a re
straint and good humor that
generally characterized the en
tire proceedings.
SUenoe
After the St. door had
been cleared and immediately
re-blocked by a new group of
demonstrators, the atmosphere
briefly settled to one of resigned
sitting on the rain-soaked pave
ment and steady marching
through the wind and intermit
tent showers. Arrests at this
point included only those actu
ally sitting in, with the excep
tion of one bystander taken in
unwillingly as a "principle." The
police offered no further com
ment.
Between 7:45 and 8:00 six
buses, four filled with inductees
and two with employees, were
seen approaching the center,
and the protest went into full
non-violent swing.
Not content with merely ob
structing the entranceways, a
dozen demonstrators sat down
in the cold and damp, blocking
the buses at 14th and Clay. And
it was here also that the Oak
land police began to reverse
their reputation, gained during

"Stop the Draft Week," as pur
veyors of insensate violence.
Capt. Charles Hanson good
naturedly informed the protest
ors they were in violation of the
law and ordered them to dis
perse. When the order was ig
nored, he asked each individual
if he had heard the announce
ment and the order. Upon ob
taining an affirmative answer,
he requested each sitter-in to
accompany his fellow officers to
the van in order to avoid an ad
ditional charge of resisting ar
rest. All but two of those ar
rested complied.
Street Lines
The crowd of supporters,
which had previously broken
the general silence only for
Christmas carols and folk
songs, now applauded approval
of the action of their fellows.
Even before the first line had
been cleared, another had
formed half-way down the block.
And so it went. Eight times the
protestors sat almost under tho
wheels of the ever-advancing
buses, and eight times the police
arrested them, one by one, until
finally the vehicles drew abreast
of the Clay St. doors.
By this time the strain was
beginning to show on the police
men, and those blocking the
doors were arrested somewhat
more brusquely than their com
patriots in the street. However,
the entire proceedings were still
so mild in comparison with
those of October that one teen
aged girl observer was prompted
to describe the police as "so
gentle."
After clearing the doorways,
the police cordoned off an area
through which the inductees and
employees might pass, this tim- 1
eschewing the billy clubs of Oc
tober, much to the relief of any
one, demonstrator or not, within
potential swinging distance.
Badge Number?
During the clearing process,
one reporter was handled rough
ly enough to move a bystander
to request the badge number of
the offending officer. The officer
refused, and further questioning
revealed that the police were
under orders not to discuss
their actions or any of the day's
proceedings with anyone.
By 10:00 a.m., all the buses
had been successfully unloaded
and all those willing were on
their way to jail. The rain had
stopped and the skies were be
ginning to clear.
The generally peaceful pro
test was interrupted by several
unusual incidents; among them:
the arrest of one picket in a
wheelchair, the presence of an
Army deserter who threw his
military identification papers at
the nearest policeman with a
cry of, "Here, take the goddam
thing. I quit!", and the arrests
of five individuals, two of them
Stanford studenfs—John Ship
pee and Hallan C. Hamilton, for
non-possession of draft cards.

These latter arrests were un
dertaken on the initiative of act
ing United States Marshal, Trev
elyn G. Blazzard, without the
authorization of area United
States attorney Cecil Poole.
James McShane, Chief U.S.
Marshall in Washington, D.C.,
subsequently ordered a cessa
tion of such arrests.

The arrests, the first since
1947 for this offense, were, in
Poole's words, "most unusual"
and appeared to be in defiance
of Department of Justice policy.
Poole stated he has asked the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
to look into the case and said,
"I cannot say now whether I'll
prosecute."
No explanation was forth
coming for the failure to arrest
former Stanford Student Body
President David Harris who was
not only clearly without his own
card, but was able to collect six
other draft cards and four mili
tary identification cards for re
turn to Selective Service. In ad
dition, six draft cards were
burned in front of the induction
center.
December's demonstrations
were long in planning; two ral
lies, one a be-in at Golden Gate
Park, the other at San Fran
cisco State College, attempted to
set the tone of the sit-in. Among
the speakers at S.F. State, all
veterans of "Stop the Draft
Week," was Dave Harris.
"There is a decision you must
make about your liv s," Harris
said, "The choice is whether you
are going to use your life to
help build up the war in Viet
nam or as an instrument to
bring down the American State.

"Going over to Oakland, de
ciding to spend Christmas vaca
tion in the Santa Rita Prison
Farm," he continued, "is a small
act, but the world is made up
of small things.
"And in the end we will win,
we will win through hope."

trial. The judge took into con
sideration the day that the dem
onstrators had already spent in
ia.il and reduced sentences one
day.
The tone of tho two-day sit-in,
organized by the War Resisters
League (WRL) and the Civil
Action Day Committee (CADC)
was summarized by two cum
laude graduates of Harvard Uni
versity, Randy Kehler and Jim
riacco.
"We're not trying to close
down the center. We know we
can't do that," they said. But,
they added, by blocking the en
trances and interdicting the
buses carrying inductees and
employees, they could create the
pause needed for a search of
conscience.
Abnormal Monday
By 6:30 a.m., the atmosphere
at 15th and Clay in Oakland was
noticeably different from that of
a normal Monday morning. And
he difference was not only in
the pouring rain and bone-chill
ing wind.
Lines of support pickets, car
rying flowers instead of the
placards in evidence in October
and chanting Christmas carols
rather than "Hell No, We Won't
Go", were forming on the side
walks facing the induction cen

ter. A few policemen were mill
ing about, with night sticks and
tear gas of two months ago con
spicuous by their absence.
At 6:30, four busloads of dem
onstrators arrived, among them
the "Stanford Faculty and Staff
for Peace in Vietnam," a group
according to Political Science
Professor Charles Drekmeier,
formed two years ago at a
teach-in to protest the Vietnam
war. Among those with Drek
meier were Professors Julian
Davidson and Gerald Hiken, and
Rachelle Marshall, wife of Poli.
Sci. Prof. Hubert Marshall.
The first response from the
police came shortly after 7:00,
when a dozen protestors block
ing the 15th St. door were ar
rested and escorted to a waiting
van. The move apparently took
the sitters-in by surprise, but
they offered no resistance, and
the police responded with a re
straint and good humor that
generally characterized the en
tire proceedings.
SUenoe
After the St. door had
been cleared and immediately
re-blocked by a new group of
demonstrators, the atmosphere
briefly settled to one of resigned
sitting on the rain-soaked pave
ment and steady marching
through the wind and intermit
tent showers. Arrests at this
point included only those actu
ally sitting in, with the excep
tion of one bystander taken in
unwillingly as a "principle." The
police offered no further com
ment.
Between 7:45 and 8:00 six
buses, four filled with inductees
and two with employees, were
seen approaching the center,
and the protest went into full
non-violent swing.
Not content with merely ob
structing the entranceways, a
dozen demonstrators sat down
in the cold and damp, blocking
the buses at 14th and Clay. And
it was here also that the Oak
land police began to reverse
their reputation, gained during

"Stop the Draft Week," as pur
veyors of insensate violence.
Capt. Charles Hanson good
naturedly informed the protest
ors they were in violation of the
law and ordered them to dis
perse. When the order was ig
nored, he asked each individual
if he had heard the announce
ment and the order. Upon ob
taining an affirmative answer,
he requested each sitter-in to
accompany his fellow officers to
the van in order to avoid an ad
ditional charge of resisting ar
rest. All but two of those ar
rested complied.
Street Lines
The crowd of supporters,
which had previously broken
the general silence only for
Christmas carols and folk
songs, now applauded approval
of the action of their fellows.
Even before the first line had
been cleared, another had
formed half-way down the block.
And so it went. Eight times the
protestors sat almost under tho
wheels of the ever-advancing
buses, and eight times the police
arrested them, one by one, until
finally the vehicles drew abreast
of the Clay St. doors.
By this time the strain was
beginning to show on the police
men, and those blocking the
doors were arrested somewhat
more brusquely than their com
patriots in the street. However,
the entire proceedings were still
so mild in comparison with
those of October that one teen
aged girl observer was prompted
to describe the police as "so
gentle."
After clearing the doorways,
the police cordoned off an area
through which the inductees and
employees might pass, this tim- 1
eschewing the billy clubs of Oc
tober, much to the relief of any
one, demonstrator or not, within
potential swinging distance.
Badge Number?
During the clearing process,
one reporter was handled rough
ly enough to move a bystander
to request the badge number of
the offending officer. The officer
refused, and further questioning
revealed that the police were
under orders not to discuss
their actions or any of the day's
proceedings with anyone.
By 10:00 a.m., all the buses
had been successfully unloaded
and all those willing were on
their way to jail. The rain had
stopped and the skies were be
ginning to clear.
The generally peaceful pro
test was interrupted by several
unusual incidents; among them:
the arrest of one picket in a
wheelchair, the presence of an
Army deserter who threw his
military identification papers at
the nearest policeman with a
cry of, "Here, take the goddam
thing. I quit!", and the arrests
of five individuals, two of them
Stanford studenfs—John Ship
pee and Hallan C. Hamilton, for
non-possession of draft cards.

These latter arrests were un
dertaken on the initiative of act
ing United States Marshal, Trev
elyn G. Blazzard, without the
authorization of area United
States attorney Cecil Poole.
James McShane, Chief U.S.
Marshall in Washington, D.C.,
subsequently ordered a cessa
tion of such arrests.

The arrests, the first since
1947 for this offense, were, in
Poole's words, "most unusual"
and appeared to be in defiance
of Department of Justice policy.
Poole stated he has asked the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
to look into the case and said,
"I cannot say now whether I'll
prosecute."
No explanation was forth
coming for the failure to arrest
former Stanford Student Body
President David Harris who was
not only clearly without his own
card, but was able to collect six
other draft cards and four mili
tary identification cards for re
turn to Selective Service. In ad
dition, six draft cards were
burned in front of the induction
center.
December's demonstrations
were long in planning; two ral
lies, one a be-in at Golden Gate
Park, the other at San Fran
cisco State College, attempted to
set the tone of the sit-in. Among
the speakers at S.F. State, all
veterans of "Stop the Draft
Week," was Dave Harris.
"There is a decision you must
make about your liv s," Harris
said, "The choice is whether you
are going to use your life to
help build up the war in Viet
nam or as an instrument to
bring down the American State.

"Going over to Oakland, de
ciding to spend Christmas vaca
tion in the Santa Rita Prison
Farm," he continued, "is a small
act, but the world is made up
of small things.
"And in the end we will win,
we will win through hope."

CHRISTMAS IN JAIL — Departing from the cattle-herding tactics
employed during October's "Stop the Draft Week", the Oakland
jK)lice gave complete legal announcements before making their ar
rests and then led the protestors away individually.
More than 20 Stanford fac
ulty, staff, and students were
among 285 persons arrested In
he sit-ins of December 18 and
19 at the Oakland Induction
Center.
A crowd estimated at between
1500 and 2000 demonstrators re
turned to the 15th and Clay Sts.
building, processing center for
all northern California induc
tees, two months and two days
after "Stop the Draft Week" to
protest the Vietnam war and
the Selective Service System.
The generally peaceful Christ
mas spirit which prevailed
among both demonstrators and
policemen apparently did not
-•xtend to Judge Delmar Brobst.
The judge allowed no state
ments by defendants, other than
the consistent plea of nolo con
tendere (no contest), and slap
ped an extra 30-day sentence on
one protestor who taiked back.
The judge imposed a standard
. 0-day sentence on first time
offenders, as opposed to the 10-
day sentences given out in Oc
tober, and hit those previously
arrested in draft protests with
a 90-day sentence, 45 days of
which were suspended, and a
year of probation.
Disturbing The Peace
Charges of failure to disperse,
interfering and obstructing a
public thoroughfare, and tres
passing were dismissed, as they
had been in October, leaving
only the charge of disturbing
the peace to be logged against
the defendants.
Only a handful of the arrested
persons posted bail during the
one or two days they awaited
trial. The judge took into con
sideration the day that the dem
onstrators had already spent in

day.

teach-in to protest the Vietnam
war. Among those with Drek
meier were Professors Julian
Davidson and Gerald Hiken, and
Rachelle Marshall, wife of Poli.
Sci. Prof. Hubert Marshall.
The first response from the
police came shortly after 7:00,
when a dozen protestors block
ing the 15th St. door were ar
rested and escorted to a waiting
van. The move apparently took
the sitters-in by surprise, but
they offered no resistance, and
the police responded with a re
straint and good humor that
generally characterized the en
tire proceedings.
SUenoe
After the St. door had
been cleared and immediately
re-blocked by a new group of
demonstrators, the atmosphere
briefly settled to one of resigned
sitting on the rain-soaked pave
ment and steady marching
through the wind and intermit
tent showers. Arrests at this
point included only those actu
ally sitting in, with the excep
tion of one bystander taken in
unwillingly as a "principle." The
police offered no further com
ment.
Between 7:45 and 8:00 six
buses, four filled with inductees
and two with employees, were
seen approaching the center,
and the protest went into full
non-violent swing.
Not content with merely ob
structing the entranceways, a
dozen demonstrators sat down
in the cold and damp, blocking
the buses at 14th and Clay. And
it was here also that the Oak
land police began to reverse
their reputation, gained during

"Stop the Draft Week," as pur
veyors of insensate violence.
Capt. Charles Hanson good
naturedly informed the protest
ors they were in violation of the
law and ordered them to dis
perse. When the order was ig
nored, he asked each individual
if he had heard the announce
ment and the order. Upon ob
taining an affirmative answer,
he requested each sitter-in to
accompany his fellow officers to
the van in order to avoid an ad
ditional charge of resisting ar
rest. All but two of those ar
rested complied.
Street Lines
The crowd of supporters,
which had previously broken
the general silence only for
Christmas carols and folk
songs, now applauded approval
of the action of their fellows.
Even before the first line had
been cleared, another had
formed half-way down the block.
And so it went. Eight times the
protestors sat almost under tho
wheels of the ever-advancing
buses, and eight times the police
arrested them, one by one, until
finally the vehicles drew abreast
of the Clay St. doors.
By this time the strain was
beginning to show on the police
men, and those blocking the
doors were arrested somewhat
more brusquely than their com
patriots in the street. However,
the entire proceedings were still
so mild in comparison with
those of October that one teen
aged girl observer was prompted
to describe the police as "so
gentle."
After clearing the doorways,
the police cordoned off an area
through which the inductees and
employees might pass, this tim- 1
eschewing the billy clubs of Oc
tober, much to the relief of any
one, demonstrator or not, within
potential swinging distance.
Badge Number?
During the clearing process,
one reporter was handled rough
ly enough to move a bystander
to request the badge number of
the offending officer. The officer
refused, and further questioning
revealed that the police were
under orders not to discuss
their actions or any of the day's
proceedings with anyone.
By 10:00 a.m., all the buses
had been successfully unloaded
and all those willing were on
their way to jail. The rain had
stopped and the skies were be
ginning to clear.
The generally peaceful pro
test was interrupted by several
unusual incidents; among them:
the arrest of one picket in a
wheelchair, the presence of an
Army deserter who threw his
military identification papers at
the nearest policeman with a
cry of, "Here, take the goddam
thing. I quit!", and the arrests
of five individuals, two of them
Stanford studenfs—John Ship
pee and Hallan C. Hamilton, for
non-possession of draft cards.

These latter arrests were un
dertaken on the initiative of act
ing United States Marshal, Trev
elyn G. Blazzard, without the
authorization of area United
States attorney Cecil Poole.
James McShane, Chief U.S.
Marshall in Washington, D.C.,
subsequently ordered a cessa
tion of such arrests.

The arrests, the first since
1947 for this offense, were, in
Poole's words, "most unusual"
and appeared to be in defiance
of Department of Justice policy.
Poole stated he has asked the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
to look into the case and said,
"I cannot say now whether I'll
prosecute."
No explanation was forth
coming for the failure to arrest
former Stanford Student Body
President David Harris who was
not only clearly without his own
card, but was able to collect six
other draft cards and four mili
tary identification cards for re
turn to Selective Service. In ad
dition, six draft cards were
burned in front of the induction
center.
December's demonstrations
were long in planning; two ral
lies, one a be-in at Golden Gate
Park, the other at San Fran
cisco State College, attempted to
set the tone of the sit-in. Among
the speakers at S.F. State, all
veterans of "Stop the Draft
Week," was Dave Harris.
"There is a decision you must
make about your liv s," Harris
said, "The choice is whether you
are going to use your life to
help build up the war in Viet
nam or as an instrument to
bring down the American State.

"Going over to Oakland, de
ciding to spend Christmas vaca
tion in the Santa Rita Prison
Farm," he continued, "is a small
act, but the world is made up
of small things.
"And in the end we will win,
we will win through hope."

SOLIDARITY FOREVER — In addition to blocking all doorways to the Oakland Induction Center
demonstrators set out to temporarily halt not only busloads of inductees, but also employee buses
and the very police vans which had come to take them away. Police by and large acted in accord

CHRISTMAS IN JAIL — Departing from the cattle-herding tactics
employed during October's "Stop the Draft Week", the Oakland
jK)lice gave complete legal announcements before making their ar
rests and then led the protestors away individually.
More than 20 Stanford fac
ulty, staff, and students were
among 285 persons arrested In
he sit-ins of December 18 and
19 at the Oakland Induction
Center.
A crowd estimated at between
1500 and 2000 demonstrators re
turned to the 15th and Clay Sts.
building, processing center for
all northern California induc
tees, two months and two days
after "Stop the Draft Week" to
protest the Vietnam war and
the Selective Service System.
The generally peaceful Christ
mas spirit which prevailed
among both demonstrators and
policemen apparently did not
-•xtend to Judge Delmar Brobst.
The judge allowed no state
ments by defendants, other than
the consistent plea of nolo con
tendere (no contest), and slap
ped an extra 30-day sentence on
one protestor who taiked back.
The judge imposed a standard
. 0-day sentence on first time
offenders, as opposed to the 10-
day sentences given out in Oc
tober, and hit those previously
arrested in draft protests with
a 90-day sentence, 45 days of
which were suspended, and a
year of probation.
Disturbing The Peace
Charges of failure to disperse,
interfering and obstructing a
public thoroughfare, and tres
passing were dismissed, as they
had been in October, leaving
only the charge of disturbing
the peace to be logged against
the defendants.
Only a handful of the arrested
persons posted bail during the
one or two days they awaited
trial. The judge took into con
sideration the day that the dem
onstrators had already spent in
ia.il and reduced sentences one
day.
The tone of tho two-day sit-in,
organized by the War Resisters
League (WRL) and the Civil
Action Day Committee (CADC)
was summarized by two cum
laude graduates of Harvard Uni
versity, Randy Kehler and Jim
riacco.
"We're not trying to close
down the center. We know we
can't do that," they said. But,
they added, by blocking the en
trances and interdicting the
buses carrying inductees and
employees, they could create the
pause needed for a search of
conscience.
Abnormal Monday
By 6:30 a.m., the atmosphere
at 15th and Clay in Oakland was
noticeably different from that of
a normal Monday morning. And
he difference was not only in
the pouring rain and bone-chill
ing wind.
Lines of support pickets, car
rying flowers instead of the
placards in evidence in October
and chanting Christmas carols
rather than "Hell No, We Won't
Go", were forming on the side
walks facing the induction cen

ter. A few policemen were mill
ing about, with night sticks and
tear gas of two months ago con
spicuous by their absence.
At 6:30, four busloads of dem
onstrators arrived, among them
the "Stanford Faculty and Staff
for Peace in Vietnam," a group
according to Political Science
Professor Charles Drekmeier,
formed two years ago at a
teach-in to protest the Vietnam
war. Among those with Drek

Capt. Charles Hanson good
naturedly informed the protest
ors they were in violation of the
law and ordered them to dis
perse. When the order was ig
nored, he asked each individual
if he had heard the announce
ment and the order. Upon ob
taining an affirmative answer,
he requested each sitter-in to
accompany his fellow officers to
the van in order to avoid an ad
ditional charge of resisting ar
rest. All but two of those ar
rested complied.
Street Lines
The crowd of supporters,
which had previously broken
the general silence only for
Christmas carols and folk
songs, now applauded approval
of the action of their fellows.
Even before the first line had
been cleared, another had
formed half-way down the block.
And so it went. Eight times the
protestors sat almost under tho
wheels of the ever-advancing
buses, and eight times the police
arrested them, one by one, until
finally the vehicles drew abreast
of the Clay St. doors.
By this time the strain was
beginning to show on the police
men, and those blocking the
doors were arrested somewhat
more brusquely than their com
patriots in the street. However,
the entire proceedings were still
so mild in comparison with
those of October that one teen
aged girl observer was prompted
to describe the police as "so
gentle."
After clearing the doorways,
the police cordoned off an area
through which the inductees and
employees might pass, this tim- 1
eschewing the billy clubs of Oc
tober, much to the relief of any
one, demonstrator or not, within
potential swinging distance.
Badge Number?
During the clearing process,
one reporter was handled rough
ly enough to move a bystander
to request the badge number of
the offending officer. The officer
refused, and further questioning
revealed that the police were
under orders not to discuss
their actions or any of the day's
proceedings with anyone.
By 10:00 a.m., all the buses
had been successfully unloaded
and all those willing were on
their way to jail. The rain had
stopped and the skies were be
ginning to clear.
The generally peaceful pro
test was interrupted by several
unusual incidents; among them:
the arrest of one picket in a
wheelchair, the presence of an
Army deserter who threw his
military identification papers at
the nearest policeman with a
cry of, "Here, take the goddam
thing. I quit!", and the arrests
of five individuals, two of them
Stanford studenfs—John Ship
pee and Hallan C. Hamilton, for
non-possession of draft cards.

These latter arrests were un
dertaken on the initiative of act
ing United States Marshal, Trev
elyn G. Blazzard, without the
authorization of area United
States attorney Cecil Poole.
James McShane, Chief U.S.
Marshall in Washington, D.C.,
subsequently ordered a cessa
tion of such arrests.

The arrests, the first since
1947 for this offense, were, in
Poole's words, "most unusual"
and appeared to be in defiance
of Department of Justice policy.
Poole stated he has asked the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
to look into the case and said,
"I cannot say now whether I'll
prosecute."
No explanation was forth
coming for the failure to arrest
former Stanford Student Body
President David Harris who was
not only clearly without his own
card, but was able to collect six
other draft cards and four mili
tary identification cards for re
turn to Selective Service. In ad
dition, six draft cards were
burned in front of the induction
center.
December's demonstrations
were long in planning; two ral
lies, one a be-in at Golden Gate
Park, the other at San Fran
cisco State College, attempted to
set the tone of the sit-in. Among
the speakers at S.F. State, all
veterans of "Stop the Draft
Week," was Dave Harris.
"There is a decision you must
make about your liv s," Harris
said, "The choice is whether you
are going to use your life to
help build up the war in Viet
nam or as an instrument to
bring down the American State.

"Going over to Oakland, de
ciding to spend Christmas vaca
tion in the Santa Rita Prison
Farm," he continued, "is a small
act, but the world is made up
of small things.
"And in the end we will win,
we will win through hope."

SOLIDARITY FOREVER — In addition to blocking all doorways to the Oakland Induction Center
demonstrators set out to temporarily halt not only busloads of inductees, but also employee buses
and the very police vans which had come to take them away. Police by and large acted in accord
with tiie non-violent spirit of the day.

CHRISTMAS IN JAIL — Departing from the cattle-herding tactics
employed during October's "Stop the Draft Week", the Oakland
jK)lice gave complete legal announcements before making their ar
rests and then led the protestors away individually.
More than 20 Stanford fac
ulty, staff, and students were
among 285 persons arrested In
he sit-ins of December 18 and
19 at the Oakland Induction
Center.
A crowd estimated at between
1500 and 2000 demonstrators re
turned to the 15th and Clay Sts.
building, processing center for
all northern California induc
tees, two months and two days
after "Stop the Draft Week" to
protest the Vietnam war and
the Selective Service System.
The generally peaceful Christ
mas spirit which prevailed
among both demonstrators and
policemen apparently did not
-•xtend to Judge Delmar Brobst.
The judge allowed no state
ments by defendants, other than
the consistent plea of nolo con
tendere (no contest), and slap
ped an extra 30-day sentence on
one protestor who taiked back.
The judge imposed a standard
. 0-day sentence on first time
offenders, as opposed to the 10-
day sentences given out in Oc
tober, and hit those previously
arrested in draft protests with
a 90-day sentence, 45 days of
which were suspended, and a
year of probation.
Disturbing The Peace
Charges of failure to disperse,
interfering and obstructing a
public thoroughfare, and tres
passing were dismissed, as they
had been in October, leaving
only the charge of disturbing
the peace to be logged against
the defendants.
Only a handful of the arrested
persons posted bail during the
one or two days they awaited
trial. The judge took into con
sideration the day that the dem
onstrators had already spent in
ia.il and reduced sentences one
day.
The tone of tho two-day sit-in,
organized by the War Resisters
League (WRL) and the Civil
Action Day Committee (CADC)
was summarized by two cum
laude graduates of Harvard Uni
versity, Randy Kehler and Jim
riacco.
"We're not trying to close
down the center. We know we
can't do that," they said. But,
they added, by blocking the en
trances and interdicting the
buses carrying inductees and
employees, they could create the
pause needed for a search of
conscience.
Abnormal Monday
By 6:30 a.m., the atmosphere
at 15th and Clay in Oakland was
noticeably different from that of
a normal Monday morning. And
he difference was not only in
the pouring rain and bone-chill
ing wind.
Lines of support pickets, car
rying flowers instead of the
placards in evidence in October
and chanting Christmas carols
rather than "Hell No, We Won't
Go", were forming on the side
walks facing the induction cen

ter. A few policemen were mill
ing about, with night sticks and
tear gas of two months ago con
spicuous by their absence.
At 6:30, four busloads of dem
onstrators arrived, among them
the "Stanford Faculty and Staff
for Peace in Vietnam," a group
according to Political Science
Professor Charles Drekmeier,
formed two years ago at a
teach-in to protest the Vietnam
war. Among those with Drek
meier were Professors Julian
Davidson and Gerald Hiken, and
Rachelle Marshall, wife of Poli.
Sci. Prof. Hubert Marshall.
The first response from the
police came shortly after 7:00,
when a dozen protestors block
ing the 15th St. door were ar
rested and escorted to a waiting
van. The move apparently took
the sitters-in by surprise, but
they offered no resistance, and
the police responded with a re
straint and good humor that
generally characterized the en
tire proceedings.
SUenoe
After the St. door had
been cleared and immediately
re-blocked by a new group of
demonstrators, the atmosphere
briefly settled to one of resigned
sitting on the rain-soaked pave
ment and steady marching
through the wind and intermit
tent showers. Arrests at this
point included only those actu
ally sitting in, with the excep
tion of one bystander taken in
unwillingly as a "principle." The
police offered no further com
ment.
Between 7:45 and 8:00 six
buses, four filled with inductees
and two with employees, were
seen approaching the center,
and the protest went into full
non-violent swing.
Not content with merely ob
structing the entranceways, a
dozen demonstrators sat down
in the cold and damp, blocking
the buses at 14th and Clay. And
it was here also that the Oak
land police began to reverse
their reputation, gained during

"Stop the Draft Week," as pur
veyors of insensate violence.
Capt. Charles Hanson good
naturedly informed the protest
ors they were in violation of the
law and ordered them to dis

potential swinging distance.
Badge Number?
During the clearing process,
one reporter was handled rough
ly enough to move a bystander
to request the badge number of
the offending officer. The officer
refused, and further questioning
revealed that the police were
under orders not to discuss
their actions or any of the day's
proceedings with anyone.
By 10:00 a.m., all the buses
had been successfully unloaded
and all those willing were on
their way to jail. The rain had
stopped and the skies were be
ginning to clear.
The generally peaceful pro
test was interrupted by several
unusual incidents; among them:
the arrest of one picket in a
wheelchair, the presence of an
Army deserter who threw his
military identification papers at
the nearest policeman with a
cry of, "Here, take the goddam
thing. I quit!", and the arrests
of five individuals, two of them
Stanford studenfs—John Ship
pee and Hallan C. Hamilton, for
non-possession of draft cards.

These latter arrests were un
dertaken on the initiative of act
ing United States Marshal, Trev
elyn G. Blazzard, without the
authorization of area United
States attorney Cecil Poole.
James McShane, Chief U.S.
Marshall in Washington, D.C.,
subsequently ordered a cessa
tion of such arrests.

The arrests, the first since
1947 for this offense, were, in
Poole's words, "most unusual"
and appeared to be in defiance
of Department of Justice policy.
Poole stated he has asked the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
to look into the case and said,
"I cannot say now whether I'll
prosecute."
No explanation was forth
coming for the failure to arrest
former Stanford Student Body
President David Harris who was
not only clearly without his own
card, but was able to collect six
other draft cards and four mili
tary identification cards for re
turn to Selective Service. In ad
dition, six draft cards were
burned in front of the induction
center.
December's demonstrations
were long in planning; two ral
lies, one a be-in at Golden Gate
Park, the other at San Fran
cisco State College, attempted to
set the tone of the sit-in. Among
the speakers at S.F. State, all
veterans of "Stop the Draft
Week," was Dave Harris.
"There is a decision you must
make about your liv s," Harris
said, "The choice is whether you
are going to use your life to
help build up the war in Viet
nam or as an instrument to
bring down the American State.

"Going over to Oakland, de
ciding to spend Christmas vaca
tion in the Santa Rita Prison
Farm," he continued, "is a small
act, but the world is made up
of small things.
"And in the end we will win,
we will win through hope."

SOLIDARITY FOREVER — In addition to blocking all doorways to the Oakland Induction Center
demonstrators set out to temporarily halt not only busloads of inductees, but also employee buses
and the very police vans which had come to take them away. Police by and large acted in accord
with tiie non-violent spirit of the day.

CHRISTMAS IN JAIL — Departing from the cattle-herding tactics
employed during October's "Stop the Draft Week", the Oakland
jK)lice gave complete legal announcements before making their ar
rests and then led the protestors away individually.
More than 20 Stanford fac
ulty, staff, and students were
among 285 persons arrested In
he sit-ins of December 18 and
19 at the Oakland Induction
Center.
A crowd estimated at between
1500 and 2000 demonstrators re
turned to the 15th and Clay Sts.
building, processing center for
all northern California induc
tees, two months and two days
after "Stop the Draft Week" to
protest the Vietnam war and
the Selective Service System.
The generally peaceful Christ
mas spirit which prevailed
among both demonstrators and
policemen apparently did not
-•xtend to Judge Delmar Brobst.
The judge allowed no state
ments by defendants, other than
the consistent plea of nolo con
tendere (no contest), and slap
ped an extra 30-day sentence on
one protestor who taiked back.
The judge imposed a standard
. 0-day sentence on first time
offenders, as opposed to the 10-
day sentences given out in Oc
tober, and hit those previously
arrested in draft protests with
a 90-day sentence, 45 days of
which were suspended, and a
year of probation.
Disturbing The Peace
Charges of failure to disperse,
interfering and obstructing a
public thoroughfare, and tres
passing were dismissed, as they
had been in October, leaving
only the charge of disturbing
the peace to be logged against
the defendants.
Only a handful of the arrested
persons posted bail during the
one or two days they awaited
trial. The judge took into con
sideration the day that the dem
onstrators had already spent in
ia.il and reduced sentences one
day.
The tone of tho two-day sit-in,
organized by the War Resisters
League (WRL) and the Civil
Action Day Committee (CADC)
was summarized by two cum
laude graduates of Harvard Uni
versity, Randy Kehler and Jim
riacco.
"We're not trying to close
down the center. We know we
can't do that," they said. But,
they added, by blocking the en
trances and interdicting the
buses carrying inductees and
employees, they could create the
pause needed for a search of
conscience.
Abnormal Monday
By 6:30 a.m., the atmosphere
at 15th and Clay in Oakland was
noticeably different from that of
a normal Monday morning. And
he difference was not only in
the pouring rain and bone-chill
ing wind.
Lines of support pickets, car
rying flowers instead of the
placards in evidence in October
and chanting Christmas carols
rather than "Hell No, We Won't
Go", were forming on the side
walks facing the induction cen

ter. A few policemen were mill
ing about, with night sticks and
tear gas of two months ago con
spicuous by their absence.
At 6:30, four busloads of dem
onstrators arrived, among them
the "Stanford Faculty and Staff
for Peace in Vietnam," a group
according to Political Science
Professor Charles Drekmeier,
formed two years ago at a
teach-in to protest the Vietnam
war. Among those with Drek
meier were Professors Julian
Davidson and Gerald Hiken, and
Rachelle Marshall, wife of Poli.
Sci. Prof. Hubert Marshall.
The first response from the
police came shortly after 7:00,
when a dozen protestors block
ing the 15th St. door were ar
rested and escorted to a waiting
van. The move apparently took
the sitters-in by surprise, but
they offered no resistance, and
the police responded with a re
straint and good humor that
generally characterized the en
tire proceedings.
SUenoe
After the St. door had
been cleared and immediately
re-blocked by a new group of
demonstrators, the atmosphere
briefly settled to one of resigned
sitting on the rain-soaked pave
ment and steady marching
through the wind and intermit
tent showers. Arrests at this
point included only those actu
ally sitting in, with the excep
tion of one bystander taken in
unwillingly as a "principle." The
police offered no further com
ment.
Between 7:45 and 8:00 six
buses, four filled with inductees
and two with employees, were
seen approaching the center,
and the protest went into full
non-violent swing.
Not content with merely ob
structing the entranceways, a
dozen demonstrators sat down
in the cold and damp, blocking
the buses at 14th and Clay. And
it was here also that the Oak
land police began to reverse
their reputation, gained during

"Stop the Draft Week," as pur
veyors of insensate violence.
Capt. Charles Hanson good
naturedly informed the protest
ors they were in violation of the
law and ordered them to dis
perse. When the order was ig
nored, he asked each individual
if he had heard the announce
ment and the order. Upon ob
taining an affirmative answer,
he requested each sitter-in to
accompany his fellow officers to
the van in order to avoid an ad
ditional charge of resisting ar
rest. All but two of those ar
rested complied.
Street Lines
The crowd of supporters,
which had previously broken
the general silence only for
Christmas carols and folk
songs, now applauded approval
of the action of their fellows.
Even before the first line had
been cleared, another had
formed half-way down the block.
And so it went. Eight times the
protestors sat almost under tho
wheels of the ever-advancing
buses, and eight times the police
arrested them, one by one, until
finally the vehicles drew abreast
of the Clay St. doors.
By this time the strain was
beginning to show on the police
men, and those blocking the
doors were arrested somewhat
more brusquely than their com
patriots in the street. However,
the entire proceedings were still
so mild in comparison with
those of October that one teen
aged girl observer was prompted
to describe the police as "so
gentle."
After clearing the doorways,
the police cordoned off an area
through which the inductees and
employees might pass, this tim- 1
eschewing the billy clubs of Oc
tober, much to the relief of any
one, demonstrator or not, within
potential swinging distance.

ly enough to move a bystander
to request the badge number of
