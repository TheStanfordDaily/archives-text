# Engineering Department Plans Modifications In Requirements
## 
### 
In a move to liberalize the oft
criticized undergraduate engi
neering curriculum, the civil,
mechanical, and electrical engi
neering departments have elim
inated certain technical elective
requirements.
Prior to this, undergrad en
gineering students were unable
to take many elective courses
Vyond those required by Gen
eral Studies and their particular

department. The engineering
elective requirement of 15-25
units was filled from a course
list compiled by each depart
ment, with the exact number of
units varying with each depart
ment.
Under the new plan engineer
ing students will be allowed to
fill the requirement with courses
of their choice. While courses
chosen need not be in fields
related to engineering, some
students contemplating extens
ive graduate work would be
urged to include some engineer
ing courses.
In a related move the engi
neering school has launched a
study of its "core" curriculum
to be conducted by a committee
under the chairmanship of Prof.
Ralph Smith.
The School of Engineering; is
sponsoring several undergrad
uate seminars this quarter on
various aspects of engineering
education. All interested are
urged to sign up in the Dean's
office of the School of Engineer
ing, January 3 or 4. There will
also bo a meeting of Interested

students Thursday night at 7:30
in Room 268, Engineering Cor
ner.
Tau Beta Pi, the engineering
honors society, recently drew
up a report criticizing the re
strictive nature of the curricu
lum. Eckhard Schulz, president
of Tau Beta Pi, says his group
will sponsor a student-faculty
discussion this quarter on the
curriculum.
