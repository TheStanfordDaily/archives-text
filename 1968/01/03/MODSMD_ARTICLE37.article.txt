# Prof To Be Tried On LSD Charges
## 
### H. RENTON ROLPH 
Jerome Feldman, 29-year-old
assistant professor of computer
sciences at Stanford, was
granted a jury trial Friday on
the charge of possession of
LSD.
Feldman pleaded not guilty to
the charge in Redwood City's
Municipal Court and Judge
Frank Comaich set 9 a.m. on
January 29 for the trial.
Feldman was arrested by San
Mateo County deputy sheriffs
who reported his two sons,
Benjamin, 2 and Michael, 5,
were treated at the Palo Alto-
Stanford Hospital Center after
accidentally having taken LSD
tablets instead of prescription
fluoride tablets.
The arrest of Feldman was
made on the basis of evidence
given by staff members at Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital, accord
ing to San Mateo County Sher
iff's Capt. Eugene Stewart.
Doctor-Patient Privilege
Feldman himself was dis
tressed that hospital officials
would report a case such as his
children's to police authorities.
"The tragedy," according to
Feldman, "is that the hospital
would report such a thing. Peo
ple are going to hesitate to go
to the hospital."
Feldman visited the hospital
with Benjamin and Michael De
cember 8. Doctors told police
that Benjamin "showed every
sign of having taken LSD at the
time. The boy seemed to be
hallucinating."
His brother Michael said he
was "seeing colored pictures"
and could not go to sleep.
The two boys are reported to
be apparently not adversely
affected by their alleged experi
ence with the hallucinogen.
The>*e were indications, accord
ing to the police report, that the
children had each been given
only 200 micrograms of LSD.
This is considered to be a mild
dosage.
The fact that Feldman en
tered a plea of not guilty to the
charge of possession of LSD

seemingly indicates that Feld
man did not have any of the
hallucinogen in his house. Th<?
San Francisco Chronicle, how
ever, quoted the professor as
saying, "I have LSD. I've taken
it in connection with my work.
I've done a number of papers on
memory models."
The Chronicle added that
Feldman said he had only taken
it because of the "exceptional
situation. I have a friend, who
is a trained psychologist—as far
as I was concerned there was
no risk."
Feldman has admitted a cer
tain "stupidity" on his part in
allowing the fluoride-LSD mix
up to occur, although the error
was apparently made by a clean
ing lady.
"The fluoride pills were on
top of the refrigerator, police
quoted Feldman as saying. "The
LSD was supposed to be inside
—next to the milk. Somehow
they got mixed up."
"It wouldn't have been so
bad," said Feldman "but they
are the same shape and size.
And to make it worse we kept
the LSD in a pill-box."
Within an hour after the boys
had accidentally been given the
LSD by their mother, Feldman,
who holds degrees from Pitts
burgh's Carnegie Tech and the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology, brought them to the
hospital.
