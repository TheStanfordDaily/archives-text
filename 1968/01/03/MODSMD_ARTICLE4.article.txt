# Synthesis Of DNA 'No Breakthrough'
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
The widely-hailfd scientific
breakthrough led by Stanford
biochemist Arthur Kornberg
has evoked a world wide re
sponse that has been "over
played in terms of what is going
on in science today," according
to Kornberg.
Kornberg's team of scientists
has succeeded in the artificial
production of DNA, the genetic
materials of a living virus.
"Our recent finding is not a
major breakthrough or achieve
ment to those in the field,"
Nobel laureat > Kornberg stated
In a Dally interview. "It solidi
fies our knowledge of DNA stru
ture."
Kornberg disclosed that pub
licity was originally generated
primarily to "let the public
know what's going on" in the
scientific community and to at
tract public attention to recent
cutbacks in federal support for
research.
Caught Imaginations
The laboratory synthesis of
DNA, the active virus core ma
terial, "caught peoples' imagin
ations because of the sensa
tional impact of 'life in a test
tube,' " he said.
Although news reports were
"on the whole restrained and
well-written," Kornberg said
that the Dec. 14 Stanford press
conference sparked messages
and interview requests from all
over the world.
Kornberg also stated that
President Johnson's "expansive
statements" added fuel to the
furor. Johnson lauded Korn
berg's achievement as a "spec
tacular breakthrough in human
knowledge," and stated that,
"These men have unlocked a
fundamental secret of life."

Kornberg emphasized that the
present accomplishment, done in
collaboration with former Stan
ford post doctoral f> llow Meh
ran Goulian and California In
stitute of Technology professor
Robert Sinsheimer, is only one
of many advancements that
have marked the recent tre
mendous growth of molecular
biology and biochemistry.
"Thore are key and germinal
discoveries made every year that
are as significant as this one,"
Kornberg explained.
The team's accomplishment,
however, certainly isn't run of
the mill. Their work represents
the first synthesis of one of the
most elementary substances
that can truly be considered
alive.
DNA Is The Base
DNA molecules are consid
ered alive because genes, which
provide the chemical blueprint
that determines the form and
function of every living thing,
are composed of DNA.
Beginning with readily avail
able supplies of the 4 bases of
DNA, the research team added
a sample of natural DNA Phi
X-174, in this case a simple
virus to act as a template—a
blue print.
By the use of an enzyme,
DNA polymerase, the four syn
thetic building blocks were then
linked together to form the
DNA chain described by the na
tural DNA template.
Then, a newly-discovered en
zyme was added to close the syn
thetic chain into a ring, the
form of the natural Phi X-174.
