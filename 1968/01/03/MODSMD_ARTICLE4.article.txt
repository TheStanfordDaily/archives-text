# Synthesis Of DNA 'No Breakthrough'
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
The widely-hailfd scientific
breakthrough led by Stanford
biochemist Arthur Kornberg
has evoked a world wide re
sponse that has been "over
played in terms of what is going
on in science today," according
to Kornberg.
Kornberg's team of scientists
has succeeded in the artificial
production of DNA, the genetic
materials of a living virus.
"Our recent finding is not a
major breakthrough or achieve
ment to those in the field,"
Nobel laureat > Kornberg stated
In a Dally interview. "It solidi
fies our knowledge of DNA stru
ture."
Kornberg disclosed that pub
licity was originally generated
primarily to "let the public
know what's going on" in the
scientific community and to at
tract public attention to recent
cutbacks in federal support for
research.
Caught Imaginations
The laboratory synthesis of
DNA, the active virus core ma
terial, "caught peoples' imagin
ations because of the sensa
tional impact of 'life in a test
tube,' " he said.
Although news reports were
"on the whole restrained and
well-written," Kornberg said
that the Dec. 14 Stanford press
conference sparked messages
and interview requests from all
over the world.
Kornberg also stated that
President Johnson's "expansive
statements" added fuel to the
furor. Johnson lauded Korn
berg's achievement as a "spec
tacular breakthrough in human
knowledge," and stated that,
"These men have unlocked a
fundamental secret of life."

Kornberg emphasized that the
present accomplishment, done in
collaboration with former Stan
ford post doctoral f> llow Meh
ran Goulian and California In
stitute of Technology professor
Robert Sinsheimer, is only one
of many advancements that
have marked the recent tre
mendous growth of molecular
biology and biochemistry.
"Thore are key and germinal
discoveries made every year that
are as significant as this one,"
Kornberg explained.
The team's accomplishment,
however, certainly isn't run of
the mill. Their work represents
the first synthesis of one of the
most elementary substances
that can truly be considered
alive.
DNA Is The Base
DNA molecules are consid
ered alive because genes, which
provide the chemical blueprint
that determines the form and
function of every living thing,
are composed of DNA.
Beginning with readily avail
able supplies of the 4 bases of
DNA, the research team added
a sample of natural DNA Phi
X-174, in this case a simple
virus to act as a template—a
blue print.
By the use of an enzyme,
DNA polymerase, the four syn
thetic building blocks were then
linked together to form the
DNA chain described by the na
tural DNA template.
Then, a newly-discovered en
zyme was added to close the syn
thetic chain into a ring, the
form of the natural Phi X-174.

were then tested by Sinsheimer
and found to be biologically ac
tive. The artificial DNA is fully
capable of infecting cells and
yielding identical generations of
viral descendants.
Kornberg believes that this
method can be expanded from
the simple Phi X-174 to synthe
size more complex viruses, and
to produce and modify the her
editary material of some living
cells.
He also believes that the
method can be used for the
study and possibly the eventual
control of some forms of can
cer.
Romberg's work, which won
him a Nobel prize in 1959 for
the synthesis of biologically in
active DNA, spanned 12 years
of research with the aid of over
20 graduate students and post
doctoral fellows.
Research Supported
During this time, Kornberg
has won federal grants of well

over a million dollars. The Na
tional Institutes of Health alone
has supported his research with
annual grants of nearly $200,000.
Although support has been
generous, Kornberg considers it
inadequate for future work.
"The facilities we have at pres
ent are no longer sufficient to
train our students and to house
some of the apparatus we must
use," he said.
Added to this are the recent
announcements of cutbacks in
federal research grants and a
tightening of funds for the
training of research fellows.
Kornberg terms this a "tragic
commentary on public support
of science."
He cites the recent "near
elimination" of Woodrow Wil
son fellowships as a "tragic fail
ure to support students and
their training."
Public Support Needed
This diminishing public sup
port of research is the main
reason Kornberg decided to gen

erally publicize his work. "The
publicity was intended to let
lawmakers and the public know
what's going on in the area of
scientific research."
Kornberg traces the cut in re
search funds to the increasing
military expenditures in Viet
nam. "Vietnam costs are depriv
ing us of funds for fundamental
research," he stated. "We can't
have guns and buter, too."
Kornberg advocates a "quick
and graceful withdrawal from
Vietnam.

Public Support Needed
This diminishing public sup
port of research is the main
reason Kornberg decided to gen

erally publicize his work. "The
publicity was intended to let
lawmakers and the public know
what's going on in the area of
scientific research."
Kornberg traces the cut in re
search funds to the increasing
military expenditures in Viet
nam. "Vietnam costs are depriv
ing us of funds for fundamental
research," he stated. "We can't
have guns and buter, too."
Kornberg advocates a "quick
and graceful withdrawal from
Vietnam.
The widely-hailfd scientific
breakthrough led by Stanford
biochemist Arthur Kornberg
has evoked a world wide re
sponse that has been "over
played in terms of what is going
on in science today," according
to Kornberg.
Kornberg's team of scientists
has succeeded in the artificial
production of DNA, the genetic
materials of a living virus.
"Our recent finding is not a
major breakthrough or achieve
ment to those in the field,"
Nobel laureat > Kornberg stated
In a Dally interview. "It solidi
fies our knowledge of DNA stru
ture."
Kornberg disclosed that pub
licity was originally generated
primarily to "let the public
know what's going on" in the
scientific community and to at
tract public attention to recent
cutbacks in federal support for
research.
Caught Imaginations
The laboratory synthesis of
DNA, the active virus core ma
terial, "caught peoples' imagin
ations because of the sensa
tional impact of 'life in a test
tube,' " he said.
Although news reports were
"on the whole restrained and
well-written," Kornberg said
that the Dec. 14 Stanford press
conference sparked messages
and interview requests from all
over the world.
Kornberg also stated that
President Johnson's "expansive
statements" added fuel to the
furor. Johnson lauded Korn
berg's achievement as a "spec
tacular breakthrough in human
knowledge," and stated that,
"These men have unlocked a
fundamental secret of life."

Kornberg emphasized that the
present accomplishment, done in
collaboration with former Stan
ford post doctoral f> llow Meh
ran Goulian and California In
stitute of Technology professor
Robert Sinsheimer, is only one
of many advancements that
have marked the recent tre
mendous growth of molecular
biology and biochemistry.
"Thore are key and germinal
discoveries made every year that
are as significant as this one,"
Kornberg explained.
The team's accomplishment,
however, certainly isn't run of
the mill. Their work represents
the first synthesis of one of the
most elementary substances
that can truly be considered
alive.
DNA Is The Base
DNA molecules are consid
ered alive because genes, which
provide the chemical blueprint
that determines the form and
function of every living thing,
are composed of DNA.
Beginning with readily avail
able supplies of the 4 bases of
DNA, the research team added
a sample of natural DNA Phi
X-174, in this case a simple
virus to act as a template—a
blue print.
By the use of an enzyme,
DNA polymerase, the four syn
thetic building blocks were then
linked together to form the
DNA chain described by the na
tural DNA template.
Then, a newly-discovered en
zyme was added to close the syn
thetic chain into a ring, the
form of the natural Phi X-174.

capable of infecting cells and
yielding identical generations of
viral descendants.
Kornberg believes that this
method can be expanded from
the simple Phi X-174 to synthe
size more complex viruses, and
to produce and modify the her
editary material of some living
cells.
He also believes that the
method can be used for the
study and possibly the eventual
control of some forms of can

Romberg's work, which won
him a Nobel prize in 1959 for
the synthesis of biologically in
active DNA, spanned 12 years
of research with the aid of over
20 graduate students and post
doctoral fellows.
Research Supported
During this time, Kornberg
has won federal grants of well

over a million dollars. The Na
tional Institutes of Health alone
has supported his research with
annual grants of nearly $200,000.
Although support has been
generous, Kornberg considers it
inadequate for future work.
"The facilities we have at pres
ent are no longer sufficient to
train our students and to house
some of the apparatus we must
use," he said.
Added to this are the recent
announcements of cutbacks in
federal research grants and a

over a million dollars. The Na
tional Institutes of Health alone
has supported his research with
annual grants of nearly $200,000.
Although support has been
generous, Kornberg considers it
inadequate for future work.
"The facilities we have at pres
ent are no longer sufficient to
train our students and to house
some of the apparatus we must
use," he said.
Added to this are the recent
announcements of cutbacks in
federal research grants and a
tightening of funds for the
training of research fellows.
Kornberg terms this a "tragic
commentary on public support
of science."
He cites the recent "near
elimination" of Woodrow Wil
son fellowships as a "tragic fail
ure to support students and
their training."
Public Support Needed
This diminishing public sup
port of research is the main
reason Kornberg decided to gen

erally publicize his work. "The
publicity was intended to let
lawmakers and the public know
what's going on in the area of
scientific research."
Kornberg traces the cut in re
search funds to the increasing
military expenditures in Viet
nam. "Vietnam costs are depriv
ing us of funds for fundamental
research," he stated. "We can't
have guns and buter, too."
Kornberg advocates a "quick
and graceful withdrawal from
Vietnam.
The widely-hailfd scientific
breakthrough led by Stanford
biochemist Arthur Kornberg
has evoked a world wide re
sponse that has been "over
played in terms of what is going
on in science today," according
to Kornberg.
Kornberg's team of scientists
has succeeded in the artificial
production of DNA, the genetic
materials of a living virus.
"Our recent finding is not a
major breakthrough or achieve
ment to those in the field,"
Nobel laureat > Kornberg stated
In a Dally interview. "It solidi
fies our knowledge of DNA stru
ture."
Kornberg disclosed that pub
licity was originally generated
primarily to "let the public
know what's going on" in the
scientific community and to at
tract public attention to recent
cutbacks in federal support for
research.
Caught Imaginations
The laboratory synthesis of
DNA, the active virus core ma
terial, "caught peoples' imagin
ations because of the sensa
tional impact of 'life in a test
tube,' " he said.
Although news reports were
"on the whole restrained and
well-written," Kornberg said
that the Dec. 14 Stanford press
conference sparked messages
and interview requests from all
over the world.
Kornberg also stated that
President Johnson's "expansive
statements" added fuel to the
furor. Johnson lauded Korn
berg's achievement as a "spec
tacular breakthrough in human
knowledge," and stated that,
"These men have unlocked a
fundamental secret of life."

Kornberg emphasized that the
present accomplishment, done in
collaboration with former Stan
ford post doctoral f> llow Meh
ran Goulian and California In
stitute of Technology professor
Robert Sinsheimer, is only one
of many advancements that
have marked the recent tre
mendous growth of molecular
biology and biochemistry.
"Thore are key and germinal
discoveries made every year that
are as significant as this one,"
Kornberg explained.
The team's accomplishment,
however, certainly isn't run of
the mill. Their work represents
the first synthesis of one of the
most elementary substances
that can truly be considered
alive.
DNA Is The Base
DNA molecules are consid
ered alive because genes, which
provide the chemical blueprint
that determines the form and
function of every living thing,
are composed of DNA.
Beginning with readily avail
able supplies of the 4 bases of
DNA, the research team added
a sample of natural DNA Phi
X-174, in this case a simple
virus to act as a template—a
blue print.
By the use of an enzyme,
DNA polymerase, the four syn
thetic building blocks were then
linked together to form the
DNA chain described by the na
tural DNA template.
Then, a newly-discovered en
zyme was added to close the syn
thetic chain into a ring, the
form of the natural Phi X-174.

were then tested by Sinsheimer
and found to be biologically ac
tive. The artificial DNA is fully
capable of infecting cells and
yielding identical generations of
viral descendants.
Kornberg believes that this
method can be expanded from
the simple Phi X-174 to synthe
size more complex viruses, and
to produce and modify the her
editary material of some living
cells.
He also believes that the
method can be used for the
study and possibly the eventual
control of some forms of can
cer.
Romberg's work, which won
him a Nobel prize in 1959 for
the synthesis of biologically in
active DNA, spanned 12 years
of research with the aid of over
20 graduate students and post
doctoral fellows.
