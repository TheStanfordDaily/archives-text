### 
The President of Stanford's Board of Tnistees faces a long con
valescence from severe injuries in a head-on auto collision in South
ern California Dec 13.
W. Parmer Fuller 111 was rushed to Whittier Presbyterian Hos-

pital with a broken hip and
fractured ribs from the two-ear
crash.
He was later cited by the Cal
ifornia Highway Patrol for driv
ing on the left side of the road.
A hearing is set for Jan. 12 in
Whittier Municipal Court.
Fuller is "recovering rapidly,"
according to doctors in Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital, where he
was flown after the accident for
an operation. Fuller will be re
leased later this week.
"Although his recovery was
"quicker than anticipated, he
will be on crutches for quite a
while," said Fred Glover, assis
tant to President Sterling. His
attendence at the Jan. 1718
Trustees meeting is uncertain.
Fuller was alone in his car at
the time of the crash. The driver
of the other car, Harold Francis
Jones, 40. of Whittier, also alone
was treated for minor injuries
and released.
According to the Highway
Patrol accident report, Fuller's
1967 Ford collided with Jones'

1967 Plymouth at 11:20 p.m. just
outside Whittier city limits. Both
vehicles suffered "major dam
age."
Fuller, who resides in Hills
borough, is vice-president of
Pittsburgh Plate Glass. He was
elected president of the Stanford
Board of Trustees last May.
