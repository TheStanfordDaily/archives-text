# Rusk Refuses IIR In Fear Of Protest
## 
### 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
scheduled to speak here in mid-
January, has cancelled the ap
pearance apparently for fear of
demonstrations.
Rusk, who had been invited
here by the Institute of Inter
national Relations (IIR), is
scheduled to address San Fran
cisco's Commonwealth Club one
week from tomorrow.
A spokesman for the lIR said

Rusk was supposed to speak
here either this Friday or Fri
day of next week.
Rusk had called President
Wallace Sterling last month to
ask about the possibility of dfm
onstrations.
Sterling's administrative as
sistant, Frederick O. Glover,
said yesterday Sterling advised
Rusk there was a "very good
possibility" of demonstrations.
Glover said Sterling added he
hoped the Secretary would ad
dress the students, and the Uni
versity would "do its best to
handle any disorders that d â€¢
veloped."
Washington Post columnist
Joseph Alsop reported in late
December, "For various prac
tical reasons . . . , Rusk has just
cancelled a planned appearance
at Leland Stanford University,
whore the more extreme local
'peace' groups were busily pre
paring for an outburst to end
all outbursts."
A spokesman for Students for
a Democratic Society (SDS)
said they had planned no such
major outburst. "We felt we

would let people do what they
wanted to do, and have no mon
itors for a march or something,"
he said.
SDS had planned to distribute
leaflets about Rusk's views and
to ask for a floor microphone in
the auditorium in to en
gage the Secreary in a debate
after his speech.
The last high-ranking federal
official to speak at Stanford was
Undersecretary of State Nicho
las Katzenbach Nov. 17. Fears
of a major protest then agains
American actions in Vietnam
proved to be ungrounded.
Protestors quietly distributed
leaflets in front of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, where Katzenbach
was speaking. The question-and
answer period after his formal
remarks was orderly.
Vice President Hubert Hum
phrey got a far different recep
tion when he visited Stanford
last Feb. 21. His exit from the
campus was hurried by a major
disturbance in which hundreds
of persons raced toward him,
some yelling "murderer" or
"shame, shame."
