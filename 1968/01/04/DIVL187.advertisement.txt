Dear Mr. Kimball:
I have been asked the question, what do businessmen know about college students?
A greater insight into campus life-styles and attitudes will certainly help businessmen
obtain a better understanding of students—many of whom will be entering business.
We in business probably have some erroneous notions, just as correspondence I
have received has shown me that campus attitudes toward business are not always
based on correct information.
For example, I would like a better perspective on the use of drugs on campus. Are the
reports true that more and more students are relying on drugs to stimulate creative
thought and as a means of escape?
Just how widespread is drug usage in colleges today? One day we read that the reports
are over-exaggerated, another day that the problems have been understated. I find
myself wondering to what extent—to what degree of frequency—are drugs used by their
campus advocates, and to what actual meaningful end. Is their use purposeful,
or merely a crutch and an "experience"?
The question of drug usage on campus is more than a casual subject to businessmen.
Business requires a steady influx of men with vision, imagination, fresh ideas, new
approaches, and we are turning to the brighter graduates going into industry and
business to satisfy these needs.
When the young man enters the business world (or any other vocation), will he give up
using drugs and other psychedelic stimulations? Or has their use become an intrinsic part
of his life-style?
On the other hand, supposing the student, when he embarks on a career, forsakes
the drug habit which he presumes stimulated his creativity on campus. Will he still be
able to generate imaginative approaches to business problems?
Another point I would like clarified is that of compatibility with those with whom he must
come in contact in a business career. Will he have become so accustomed to
companions whose mental processes are stimulated artificially that he will be unable to
communicate with, and feel empathetic toward, his business contemporaries?
I would like your thoughts on this drug questibn.
Sincerely,
Robert W. Galvin
