# Residence Questionnaire To Student Body
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Decisions this quarter will deter
mine whether Stanford's revolution in
student housing will falter or surge
ahead in 1968.
Coed dormitories, off-campus living
for women, and mixing freshmen with
upperclassmen are all being studied
by the Dean of Students and the Resi
dences Committee of the Study of Ed
ucation at Stanford (SES). These pro
grams could expand or wither.
Long-range plans and an "ideal"
philosophy of residences will also
emerge from the sweeping study, ac
cording to Professor Lewis Spitz, com
mittee chairman. Some of the basic
questions the SES committee will ans
wer are:
• Should Stanford keep trying to
be a "residential University," with all
its undergraduates living on-eampus?
• Is one kind of housing best, or
should the University continue to pro
vide a great variety of dormitories and
fraternities?
• Is selective membership — as in
fraternities — compatible with the
University's ideals?
• Is coeducation desirable?

• Should women live off campus?
Before any decisions are made, a
mass of data will be collected on stu
dent preferences and the costs of
changing housing arrangements. A
questionnaire will be distributed Jan.
8 to undergraduates by resident assis
tants. The questionnaire will also be
mailed to a 25 per cent sample of un
dergraduates who live off-campus.
Computer Will Analyse
When the replies are analyzed by a
computer later this month, the Dean's
office will have a detailed profile of
where students want to live, and what
things they want in their residence.
A fact-finding committee of students
and University staff designed the sep
arate questionnaires for men and
women. William Leland, director of
Stern Hall, is chairman.
In the questionnaires students will
rank all possible "residence alterna
tives" — coed dormitories, single-sex
dormitories, fraternities, row houses
and off-campus.
Another section asks students to
rate 40 features of a residence on a
scale from "extremely important" to
"of no importance." The features

range from seminar rooms and lounges
to social programs and selective mem
bership.
How Many Beds?
The fact finding committee will also
survey campus residences to help the
Dean's office estimate the cost of any
housing changes, and get an exact
count of available beds.
When Branner Hall was made coedu
cational last September, larger beds
and new lavatory plumbing had to be
installed. When the "demonstration"
houses were set up in Stern, base
ment rooms were renovated to serve
as seminar classrooms.
The problems of remodeling other
residences will be investigated by a
questionnaire given to all residence
directors, followed by visits by the
Dean's staff and members of the fact
finding committee. They will find out
how the directors think their houses
can be used best.
What, and How Much?
When all this fact-finding is finished,
the Dean will know two things:
(1) what the students want, and
(2) what the University can now
provide, and how much it will cost.

The next step will be hammering
out a housing plan for the 19G3 69
school year. The Dean's ofice will
work with the SES committre on this
plan, which will be by
March, according to Professor
Spitz, committee chairman.
Last spring the same comm'tte'i
helped s t up four coed demonstration
houses, convert Branner into a
fr?shman dormitory, and bring fresh
man women into Florence Moor 1 hall.
Now the committee must decide
whether to extend these two basic
reforms — coeducation and "integra
tion" of freshmen with upperclassmen.
The future of the giant Stern and
Wilbur dormitory complexes depends
on these decisions.
Seminars On Trial
Another issue will be the value of
r -quired seminars in the demonstra
tion houses. These expensive academic
programs have been criticized by mem-
b i rs of Grove, the prototype coed
hous organized in December, 1966.
Any housing plan will be limited
by the simple arithmetic of match
ing numbers of beds with numbers of
students. Stanford is under financial

prssure to keep ev-ry dormitory
spaoc fille 1. A l * a result, the commit
i e can" make any plans until it de
cides whether more women should
allowed to mov off campus. The
spao th w vacate must be fil'ed by
mrn or women transfer students
Th" 1 stud >nt questionnaire will show
how m~ny women would like to move
out of dormitories.
Trustees Must Approve
But the Board of Trustees must ap
prove any change in women's housing
policy. Last April, for the first time
in Stanford's 75-year history, the trus
tees permitted up to 100 senior wom
en to move off campus. Fifty-nine took
up the offer.
The only other undergraduate wom
en living off-campus legally are those
with "compelling personal reasons"
who receive special permission from
Sally Mahoney, assistant dean of stu
dents. About 15 have this permission.
The sentiment cf the SES commit
tee, according to Spitz, favors a big
expansion of the coed program. But
the Dean's survey may show remodel
ing residences for both sexes would
cost too much.
"We'll probably lose all our prin

ciples when the returns come in,"
Spitz laughed.
But the committee will stick to its
principles when it writes its "philo
sophy" of student housing at Stanford.
This "ideal s?t-up" will be published
"toward the end of the quarter," Spitz
said.
The committee won't be limited by
existing dormitory facilities in its
long range proposals. One idea before
the committee suggests apartment
buildings open to undergraduates and
graduates alike. Another plan would
mix graduates and undergraduates
throughout the dormitories.
Whatever comes out in the commit
tee's final report, its 12 members hope
to provide a coherent goal to guide
future housing plans.
In the past, Spitz suggests, the
Un'versity's planning has been poor.
One example is the scheme for Moore
and Jacks halls, which provided sep
arate wings for men and women with
shared lounges and dining halls. Both
projects have been indefinitely post
poned with several million dollars in
gifts left unused.
"Would these halls have been obso
lete when built?" Spitz asked.

mine whether Stanford's revolution in
student housing will falter or surge
ahead in 1968.

poned with several million dollars in
gifts left unused.
"Would these halls have been obso
lete when built?" Spitz asked.
Decisions this quarter will deter
mine whether Stanford's revolution in
student housing will falter or surge
ahead in 1968.
Coed dormitories, off-campus living
for women, and mixing freshmen with
upperclassmen are all being studied
by the Dean of Students and the Resi
dences Committee of the Study of Ed
ucation at Stanford (SES). These pro
grams could expand or wither.
Long-range plans and an "ideal"
philosophy of residences will also
emerge from the sweeping study, ac
cording to Professor Lewis Spitz, com
mittee chairman. Some of the basic
questions the SES committee will ans
wer are:
• Should Stanford keep trying to
be a "residential University," with all
its undergraduates living on-eampus?
• Is one kind of housing best, or
should the University continue to pro
vide a great variety of dormitories and
fraternities?
• Is selective membership — as in
fraternities — compatible with the
University's ideals?
• Is coeducation desirable?

• Should women live off campus?
Before any decisions are made, a
mass of data will be collected on stu
dent preferences and the costs of
changing housing arrangements. A
questionnaire will be distributed Jan.
8 to undergraduates by resident assis
tants. The questionnaire will also be
mailed to a 25 per cent sample of un
dergraduates who live off-campus.
Computer Will Analyse
When the replies are analyzed by a
computer later this month, the Dean's
office will have a detailed profile of
where students want to live, and what
things they want in their residence.
A fact-finding committee of students
and University staff designed the sep
arate questionnaires for men and
women. William Leland, director of
Stern Hall, is chairman.
In the questionnaires students will
rank all possible "residence alterna
tives" — coed dormitories, single-sex
dormitories, fraternities, row houses
and off-campus.
Another section asks students to
rate 40 features of a residence on a
scale from "extremely important" to
"of no importance." The features

range from seminar rooms and lounges
to social programs and selective mem
bership.
How Many Beds?
The fact finding committee will also
survey campus residences to help the
Dean's office estimate the cost of any
housing changes, and get an exact
count of available beds.
When Branner Hall was made coedu
cational last September, larger beds
and new lavatory plumbing had to be
installed. When the "demonstration"
houses were set up in Stern, base
ment rooms were renovated to serve
as seminar classrooms.
The problems of remodeling other
residences will be investigated by a
questionnaire given to all residence
directors, followed by visits by the
Dean's staff and members of the fact
finding committee. They will find out
how the directors think their houses
can be used best.
What, and How Much?
When all this fact-finding is finished,
the Dean will know two things:
(1) what the students want, and
(2) what the University can now
provide, and how much it will cost.

The next step will be hammering
out a housing plan for the 19G3 69
school year. The Dean's ofice will
work with the SES committre on this
plan, which will be by
March, according to Professor
Spitz, committee chairman.
Last spring the same comm'tte'i
helped s t up four coed demonstration
houses, convert Branner into a
fr?shman dormitory, and bring fresh
man women into Florence Moor 1 hall.
Now the committee must decide
whether to extend these two basic
reforms — coeducation and "integra
tion" of freshmen with upperclassmen.
The future of the giant Stern and
Wilbur dormitory complexes depends
on these decisions.
Seminars On Trial
Another issue will be the value of
r -quired seminars in the demonstra
tion houses. These expensive academic
programs have been criticized by mem-
b i rs of Grove, the prototype coed
hous organized in December, 1966.
Any housing plan will be limited
by the simple arithmetic of match
ing numbers of beds with numbers of
students. Stanford is under financial

prssure to keep ev-ry dormitory
spaoc fille 1. A l * a result, the commit
i e can" make any plans until it de
cides whether more women should
allowed to mov off campus. The
spao th w vacate must be fil'ed by
mrn or women transfer students
Th" 1 stud >nt questionnaire will show
how m~ny women would like to move
out of dormitories.
Trustees Must Approve
But the Board of Trustees must ap
prove any change in women's housing
policy. Last April, for the first time
in Stanford's 75-year history, the trus
tees permitted up to 100 senior wom
en to move off campus. Fifty-nine took
up the offer.
The only other undergraduate wom
en living off-campus legally are those
with "compelling personal reasons"
who receive special permission from
Sally Mahoney, assistant dean of stu
dents. About 15 have this permission.
The sentiment cf the SES commit
tee, according to Spitz, favors a big
expansion of the coed program. But
the Dean's survey may show remodel
ing residences for both sexes would
cost too much.
"We'll probably lose all our prin

ciples when the returns come in,"
Spitz laughed.
But the committee will stick to its
principles when it writes its "philo
sophy" of student housing at Stanford.
This "ideal s?t-up" will be published
"toward the end of the quarter," Spitz
said.
The committee won't be limited by
existing dormitory facilities in its
long range proposals. One idea before
the committee suggests apartment
buildings open to undergraduates and
graduates alike. Another plan would
mix graduates and undergraduates
throughout the dormitories.
Whatever comes out in the commit
tee's final report, its 12 members hope
to provide a coherent goal to guide
future housing plans.
In the past, Spitz suggests, the
Un'versity's planning has been poor.
One example is the scheme for Moore
and Jacks halls, which provided sep
arate wings for men and women with
shared lounges and dining halls. Both
projects have been indefinitely post
poned with several million dollars in
gifts left unused.
"Would these halls have been obso

arate wings for men and women with
shared lounges and dining halls. Both
projects have been indefinitely post
poned with several million dollars in
gifts left unused.
"Would these halls have been obso
lete when built?" Spitz asked.
Decisions this quarter will deter
mine whether Stanford's revolution in
student housing will falter or surge
ahead in 1968.
Coed dormitories, off-campus living
for women, and mixing freshmen with
upperclassmen are all being studied
by the Dean of Students and the Resi
dences Committee of the Study of Ed
ucation at Stanford (SES). These pro
grams could expand or wither.
Long-range plans and an "ideal"
philosophy of residences will also
emerge from the sweeping study, ac
cording to Professor Lewis Spitz, com
mittee chairman. Some of the basic
questions the SES committee will ans
wer are:
• Should Stanford keep trying to
be a "residential University," with all
its undergraduates living on-eampus?
• Is one kind of housing best, or
should the University continue to pro
vide a great variety of dormitories and
fraternities?
• Is selective membership — as in
fraternities — compatible with the
University's ideals?
• Is coeducation desirable?

• Should women live off campus?
Before any decisions are made, a
mass of data will be collected on stu
dent preferences and the costs of
changing housing arrangements. A
questionnaire will be distributed Jan.
8 to undergraduates by resident assis
tants. The questionnaire will also be
mailed to a 25 per cent sample of un
dergraduates who live off-campus.
Computer Will Analyse
When the replies are analyzed by a
computer later this month, the Dean's
office will have a detailed profile of
where students want to live, and what
things they want in their residence.
A fact-finding committee of students
and University staff designed the sep
arate questionnaires for men and
women. William Leland, director of
Stern Hall, is chairman.
In the questionnaires students will
rank all possible "residence alterna
tives" — coed dormitories, single-sex
dormitories, fraternities, row houses
and off-campus.
Another section asks students to
rate 40 features of a residence on a
scale from "extremely important" to
"of no importance." The features

range from seminar rooms and lounges
to social programs and selective mem
bership.
How Many Beds?
The fact finding committee will also
survey campus residences to help the
Dean's office estimate the cost of any
housing changes, and get an exact
count of available beds.
When Branner Hall was made coedu
cational last September, larger beds
and new lavatory plumbing had to be
installed. When the "demonstration"
houses were set up in Stern, base
ment rooms were renovated to serve
as seminar classrooms.
The problems of remodeling other
residences will be investigated by a
questionnaire given to all residence
directors, followed by visits by the
Dean's staff and members of the fact
finding committee. They will find out
how the directors think their houses
can be used best.
What, and How Much?
When all this fact-finding is finished,
the Dean will know two things:
(1) what the students want, and
(2) what the University can now
provide, and how much it will cost.

The next step will be hammering
out a housing plan for the 19G3 69
school year. The Dean's ofice will
work with the SES committre on this
plan, which will be by
March, according to Professor
Spitz, committee chairman.
Last spring the same comm'tte'i
helped s t up four coed demonstration
houses, convert Branner into a
fr?shman dormitory, and bring fresh
man women into Florence Moor 1 hall.
Now the committee must decide
whether to extend these two basic
reforms — coeducation and "integra
tion" of freshmen with upperclassmen.
The future of the giant Stern and
Wilbur dormitory complexes depends
on these decisions.
Seminars On Trial
Another issue will be the value of
r -quired seminars in the demonstra
tion houses. These expensive academic
programs have been criticized by mem-
b i rs of Grove, the prototype coed
hous organized in December, 1966.
Any housing plan will be limited
by the simple arithmetic of match
ing numbers of beds with numbers of
students. Stanford is under financial

prssure to keep ev-ry dormitory
spaoc fille 1. A l * a result, the commit
i e can" make any plans until it de
cides whether more women should
allowed to mov off campus. The
spao th w vacate must be fil'ed by
mrn or women transfer students
Th" 1 stud >nt questionnaire will show
how m~ny women would like to move
out of dormitories.
Trustees Must Approve
But the Board of Trustees must ap
prove any change in women's housing
policy. Last April, for the first time
in Stanford's 75-year history, the trus
tees permitted up to 100 senior wom
en to move off campus. Fifty-nine took
up the offer.
The only other undergraduate wom
en living off-campus legally are those
with "compelling personal reasons"
who receive special permission from
Sally Mahoney, assistant dean of stu
dents. About 15 have this permission.
The sentiment cf the SES commit
tee, according to Spitz, favors a big
expansion of the coed program. But
the Dean's survey may show remodel
ing residences for both sexes would
cost too much.
"We'll probably lose all our prin

ciples when the returns come in,"
Spitz laughed.
But the committee will stick to its
principles when it writes its "philo
sophy" of student housing at Stanford.
This "ideal s?t-up" will be published
"toward the end of the quarter," Spitz
said.
The committee won't be limited by
existing dormitory facilities in its
long range proposals. One idea before
the committee suggests apartment
buildings open to undergraduates and
graduates alike. Another plan would
mix graduates and undergraduates
throughout the dormitories.
Whatever comes out in the commit
tee's final report, its 12 members hope
to provide a coherent goal to guide
future housing plans.
In the past, Spitz suggests, the
Un'versity's planning has been poor.
One example is the scheme for Moore
and Jacks halls, which provided sep
arate wings for men and women with
shared lounges and dining halls. Both
projects have been indefinitely post
poned with several million dollars in
