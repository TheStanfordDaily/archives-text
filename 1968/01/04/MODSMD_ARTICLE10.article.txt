# Wintertime
## 
### 
Winter quarter is a more serious time. Frost
and ice chill our brisk early morning walks
to Quad and our late night strolls to escape
from UGLY or our dorm rooms. The rains come
and one morning soon Lagunita will appear full
to brimming.
Wedged between the luxury and club atmos
phere of the fall and the sun and warmth cul
ture of the spring is the short winter quarter,
known for heavy academic loads and scholarly
concentration.
The frantic and intense seriousness of the
December examinations gave way to the relief
of the Christmas holidays. But now the exuber
ance of the fall remains but another memory,
recalled more easily in the pages of a year
book than in one's own imagination.
While the world celebrates the New Year
and fools itself into hailing another brave new
world, the winter quarter brings Stanford
closer to reality. Maybe the chill makes us more
sensitive to the warmth of another's kind gesture
or his concerned tone. Maybe we are for a while
a little closer to reality, for a while a little more
concerned what it is all about.
The winter quarter will bring the ski week
end where a couple thousand energetic students
try to cram three weeks of fun into less than

three clays, and call it a "blast." Maybe we aren't
that much closer to reality after all. The Stan
ford fraternity will celebrate its liturgy of rush
to a smaller, less impressed, and probably more
critical group of prospective pledges than ever.
A valentine, a Washington's Birthday escape
from studying, and suddenly dead week is upon
us again.
But this particular winter quarter may well
bring more. Stanford will most probably hail
its new President before the quarter is through,
perhaps even in the next couple of weeks. Cen
tury 21 and Esalen and Free University semi
nars will play to a growing core of individuals
captured by the wonder to be found in reality.
The Study of Education will try to isolate
formulae which need only implementation and
involvement to make Stanford great. Many pro
posals will appear during the quarter. Courses
and special projects by the hundreds will use
the seriousness induced by the war and civil
turmoil to lead students to consider the nature
of their contemporary life and their own human
existence.
But sadly, the vast majority of Stanford stu
dents, who might inherit it all, will daydream
and await the warmth and passiveness of the
spring.

spring.
Winter quarter is a more serious time. Frost
and ice chill our brisk early morning walks
to Quad and our late night strolls to escape
from UGLY or our dorm rooms. The rains come
and one morning soon Lagunita will appear full
to brimming.
Wedged between the luxury and club atmos
phere of the fall and the sun and warmth cul
ture of the spring is the short winter quarter,
known for heavy academic loads and scholarly
concentration.
The frantic and intense seriousness of the
December examinations gave way to the relief
of the Christmas holidays. But now the exuber
ance of the fall remains but another memory,
recalled more easily in the pages of a year
book than in one's own imagination.
While the world celebrates the New Year
and fools itself into hailing another brave new
world, the winter quarter brings Stanford
closer to reality. Maybe the chill makes us more
sensitive to the warmth of another's kind gesture
or his concerned tone. Maybe we are for a while
a little closer to reality, for a while a little more
concerned what it is all about.
The winter quarter will bring the ski week
end where a couple thousand energetic students
try to cram three weeks of fun into less than

three clays, and call it a "blast." Maybe we aren't
that much closer to reality after all. The Stan
ford fraternity will celebrate its liturgy of rush
to a smaller, less impressed, and probably more
critical group of prospective pledges than ever.
A valentine, a Washington's Birthday escape
from studying, and suddenly dead week is upon
us again.
But this particular winter quarter may well
bring more. Stanford will most probably hail
its new President before the quarter is through,
perhaps even in the next couple of weeks. Cen
tury 21 and Esalen and Free University semi
nars will play to a growing core of individuals
captured by the wonder to be found in reality.
The Study of Education will try to isolate
formulae which need only implementation and
involvement to make Stanford great. Many pro
posals will appear during the quarter. Courses
and special projects by the hundreds will use
the seriousness induced by the war and civil
turmoil to lead students to consider the nature
of their contemporary life and their own human
existence.
But sadly, the vast majority of Stanford stu
dents, who might inherit it all, will daydream
and await the warmth and passiveness of the
spring.
