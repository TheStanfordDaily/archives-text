## 'Cavern' Critic Criticized 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Your drama critic, Tom Stock
fish, appears to be operating un
der the mistaken notion that to
review one must criticize nega
tively and that competence and
praise in a review are somehow
mutually exclusive.
Stanford Repertory Theater's
The Cavern was extolled by
every major Bay Area critic as
an outstanding show. During
its three-week run, the play was
sold out for all but two nights
and patrons were repeatedly
turned away at the door. Indeed,
Anouilh's The Cavern may very
well be the best production we
have ever seen from SRT.
Get with it, Stockfish.

â€¢ Boor Or Bored
Editor, The Daily:
I am tired of being sophisti
cated When I go to a bas
ketball game, I want to be loud,
raucous, unsophisticated and
rowdy. I want to vent my emo
tions and release my inner ten
sions. What do I do? I sit and
smile and clap with our "clap"
leaders, and leave the game as
I came in, sophisticated and
bored.
The band is great, the dollies
are beautiful, the cheerleaders
try hard, and the student body
is a drag. . . . Stop playing the
role, student body, and show
some fire!
Oh, by the way, somebody
will write in to tell us all that
I am an unsophisticated boor.
Don't bother; I already know it.
