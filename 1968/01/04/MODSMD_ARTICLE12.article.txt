# Johnson In Moneyland
## 
### Henry Taylor 
In President Johnson's poll
sour situation as Congress ad
journed there's more than meets
the eye.
The drop in Mr. Johnson's
popularity seems primarily due
to two things: the failure of
his domestic programs to insure
tranquility and the failure of his
foreign policy to bring peace.
People every place I go do not
seem to understand why we
should be unable to force Ho Chi
Minh to sue for peace just as we
did the Germans and Japanese
in World War 11.
Why is it, many ask, that it
is only in the two wars in which
our opponents have been Com
munist states that we have re
fused to make victory our objec
tive — Korea and Vietnam?
Taxes Before Vietnam
Most pollsters, in turn, find
that crime in the streets and the
rising cost of living and of gov
ernment (taxes) are the major
concerns of the voting public,
even ahead of Vietnam.
Yet many of the lumps that
President Johnson took from the
adjourned Congress look uglier
than they really are. The Demo
cratic Congress often appeared
to oppose LBJ in the headlines
but he won in the realities.
If Mr. Johnson's pie-in-the-sky
approach, along with that of
the overspenders in Congress,
looks modified it is largely be
cause their backlog of causes
is currently depleted by their
elephant-sized legislative output
of the past two years.
Substantial Increase
The last Congress before the
Kennedy - Johnson Administra
tions took over appropriated
$83.8 billion. LBJ's first Congress
voted to spend $119.3 billion of
our money. The Johnson Con
gress that adjourned December
15 appropriated $141.8 billion,
an incredible difference of $58
billion in only the year 1967.

Nor does this include about $15.3
billion for such costs as the $14.1
billion to pay the mounting in
terest now due annually on ihe
Federal debt that do not require
enactment.
Yet it takes all the Federal
taxes paid by everybody earning
$6,000 a year or less just to pay
this debt-interest item alone.
Accordingly , the adjourned
Congress's true appropriation
figure exceeds $157 billion.
Non-defense Spending 1 Up
No wonder that in the world's
cold appraisal of what's happen
ing to us here the U.S. dollar is
threatened and our gold reserve
has sunk to the lowest in more
than 30 years.
The adjourned Congress pass
ed 17 separate money bills, in
cluding the $69.9 billion defense
bill, which is the largest single
appropriation ever made in the
history of the United States. Yet
Vietnam war or no war, the
Administration increased its
1967 non-defense spending a full
9Vz pecrent. Moreover, it has
done this each year since fiscal
1963.
That's where the contrast be
tween the economy headlines
and the realities comes in, and
Mr. Johnson turns out to have
had his money-money-money
(our money) way with his own
Congress.
That's Our Money
In spite of all the ballyhoo the
House cut only $6.2 billion from
the amounts President Johnson
asked and the Senate only $2.3
billion. In compromises the
final reductions became $5.9 bil
lion — a mere % of one percent
less than President Johnson ask

ed. And — Hey! We pay every
penny.
The session's smallest direct
appropriation was to extend the
Secret Service coverage of Mrs.
John F. Kennedy and her chil
dren at a cost of $211,000 a year.
Mrs. Kennedy was, at the mo
ment, in Cambodia visiting
Prince Sihanouk. And as for the
Congressmen themselves they
voted $277.6 million to run Con
gress and for related Capitol
Hill operations.
There are 533 Congressmen
and Senators. This means their
shop now costs us taxpaying
peasants $520,000 per man per
year (likewise incredible), so ab
surd have government costs be
come. Meanwhile, happy as
Greek sailors in a tattoo parlor,
the House increased its own ex

pense accounts by voice vote
and authorized another leap in
its own payroll, which has al
ready gone up 84 percent since
the New Frontier-Great Society
took over.
No wonder every place I go I
find a feeling that no matter
what we do, no matter what our
sacrifices, we are somehow be
ing thrown away — a tax-weary,
war - weary, inflation - weary,
crime-weary, riot-weary country.
Throughout the session, his
stalwarts in this Congress and
President Johnson alike have be
haved as if there were "just
us checkens," as political old
sters used to say, and that can
be very, very expensive to them
in November, 1968.

the overspenders in Congress,
looks modified it is largely be
cause their backlog of causes
is currently depleted by their
elephant-sized legislative output
of the past two years.
Substantial Increase
The last Congress before the
Kennedy - Johnson Administra
tions took over appropriated
$83.8 billion. LBJ's first Congress
voted to spend $119.3 billion of
our money. The Johnson Con
gress that adjourned December
15 appropriated $141.8 billion,
an incredible difference of $58
billion in only the year 1967.

Nor does this include about $15.3
billion for such costs as the $14.1
billion to pay the mounting in
terest now due annually on ihe
Federal debt that do not require
enactment.
Yet it takes all the Federal
taxes paid by everybody earning
$6,000 a year or less just to pay
this debt-interest item alone.
Accordingly , the adjourned
Congress's true appropriation
figure exceeds $157 billion.
Non-defense Spending 1 Up
No wonder that in the world's
cold appraisal of what's happen
ing to us here the U.S. dollar is
threatened and our gold reserve
has sunk to the lowest in more
than 30 years.
The adjourned Congress pass
ed 17 separate money bills, in
cluding the $69.9 billion defense
bill, which is the largest single
appropriation ever made in the
history of the United States. Yet
Vietnam war or no war, the
Administration increased its
1967 non-defense spending a full
9Vz pecrent. Moreover, it has
done this each year since fiscal
1963.
That's where the contrast be
tween the economy headlines
and the realities comes in, and
Mr. Johnson turns out to have
had his money-money-money
(our money) way with his own
Congress.
That's Our Money
In spite of all the ballyhoo the
House cut only $6.2 billion from
the amounts President Johnson
asked and the Senate only $2.3
billion. In compromises the
final reductions became $5.9 bil
lion — a mere % of one percent
less than President Johnson ask

ed. And — Hey! We pay every
penny.
The session's smallest direct
appropriation was to extend the
Secret Service coverage of Mrs.
John F. Kennedy and her chil
dren at a cost of $211,000 a year.
Mrs. Kennedy was, at the mo
ment, in Cambodia visiting
Prince Sihanouk. And as for the
Congressmen themselves they
voted $277.6 million to run Con
gress and for related Capitol
Hill operations.
There are 533 Congressmen
and Senators. This means their
shop now costs us taxpaying
peasants $520,000 per man per
year (likewise incredible), so ab
surd have government costs be
come. Meanwhile, happy as
Greek sailors in a tattoo parlor,
the House increased its own ex

pense accounts by voice vote
and authorized another leap in
its own payroll, which has al
ready gone up 84 percent since
the New Frontier-Great Society
took over.
No wonder every place I go I
find a feeling that no matter
what we do, no matter what our
sacrifices, we are somehow be
ing thrown away — a tax-weary,
war - weary, inflation - weary,
crime-weary, riot-weary country.
Throughout the session, his
stalwarts in this Congress and
President Johnson alike have be
haved as if there were "just
us checkens," as political old
sters used to say, and that can
be very, very expensive to them
in November, 1968.

In President Johnson's poll
sour situation as Congress ad
journed there's more than meets
the eye.
The drop in Mr. Johnson's
popularity seems primarily due
to two things: the failure of
his domestic programs to insure
tranquility and the failure of his
foreign policy to bring peace.
People every place I go do not
seem to understand why we
should be unable to force Ho Chi
Minh to sue for peace just as we
did the Germans and Japanese
in World War 11.
Why is it, many ask, that it
is only in the two wars in which
our opponents have been Com
munist states that we have re
fused to make victory our objec
tive — Korea and Vietnam?
Taxes Before Vietnam
Most pollsters, in turn, find
that crime in the streets and the
rising cost of living and of gov
ernment (taxes) are the major
concerns of the voting public,
even ahead of Vietnam.
Yet many of the lumps that
President Johnson took from the
adjourned Congress look uglier
than they really are. The Demo
cratic Congress often appeared
to oppose LBJ in the headlines
but he won in the realities.

has sunk to the lowest in more
than 30 years.
The adjourned Congress pass
ed 17 separate money bills, in
cluding the $69.9 billion defense
bill, which is the largest single
appropriation ever made in the
history of the United States. Yet
Vietnam war or no war, the
Administration increased its
1967 non-defense spending a full
9Vz pecrent. Moreover, it has
done this each year since fiscal
1963.
That's where the contrast be

and the realities comes in, and
Mr. Johnson turns out to have
had his money-money-money
(our money) way with his own
Congress.
That's Our Money
In spite of all the ballyhoo the
House cut only $6.2 billion from
the amounts President Johnson
asked and the Senate only $2.3
billion. In compromises the
final reductions became $5.9 bil
lion — a mere % of one percent
less than President Johnson ask

ed. And — Hey! We pay every
penny.
The session's smallest direct
appropriation was to extend the
Secret Service coverage of Mrs.
John F. Kennedy and her chil
dren at a cost of $211,000 a year.
Mrs. Kennedy was, at the mo

Prince Sihanouk. And as for the
Congressmen themselves they
voted $277.6 million to run Con
gress and for related Capitol
Hill operations.
There are 533 Congressmen
and Senators. This means their
shop now costs us taxpaying
peasants $520,000 per man per
year (likewise incredible), so ab
surd have government costs be
come. Meanwhile, happy as
Greek sailors in a tattoo parlor,
the House increased its own ex

pense accounts by voice vote
and authorized another leap in
its own payroll, which has al
ready gone up 84 percent since
the New Frontier-Great Society
took over.
No wonder every place I go I
find a feeling that no matter
what we do, no matter what our
sacrifices, we are somehow be
ing thrown away — a tax-weary,
war - weary, inflation - weary,
crime-weary, riot-weary country.
Throughout the session, his
stalwarts in this Congress and
President Johnson alike have be

us checkens," as political old
sters used to say, and that can
be very, very expensive to them
in November, 1968.

In President Johnson's poll
sour situation as Congress ad
journed there's more than meets
the eye.
The drop in Mr. Johnson's
popularity seems primarily due
to two things: the failure of
his domestic programs to insure
tranquility and the failure of his
foreign policy to bring peace.
People every place I go do not
seem to understand why we
should be unable to force Ho Chi
Minh to sue for peace just as we
did the Germans and Japanese
in World War 11.
Why is it, many ask, that it
is only in the two wars in which
our opponents have been Com
munist states that we have re
fused to make victory our objec
tive — Korea and Vietnam?
Taxes Before Vietnam
Most pollsters, in turn, find
that crime in the streets and the
rising cost of living and of gov
ernment (taxes) are the major
concerns of the voting public,
even ahead of Vietnam.
Yet many of the lumps that
President Johnson took from the
adjourned Congress look uglier
than they really are. The Demo
cratic Congress often appeared
to oppose LBJ in the headlines
but he won in the realities.
If Mr. Johnson's pie-in-the-sky
approach, along with that of
the overspenders in Congress,
looks modified it is largely be
cause their backlog of causes
is currently depleted by their
elephant-sized legislative output
of the past two years.
Substantial Increase
The last Congress before the
Kennedy - Johnson Administra
tions took over appropriated
$83.8 billion. LBJ's first Congress
voted to spend $119.3 billion of
our money. The Johnson Con
gress that adjourned December
15 appropriated $141.8 billion,
an incredible difference of $58
billion in only the year 1967.

Nor does this include about $15.3
billion for such costs as the $14.1
billion to pay the mounting in
terest now due annually on ihe
Federal debt that do not require
enactment.
Yet it takes all the Federal
taxes paid by everybody earning
$6,000 a year or less just to pay
this debt-interest item alone.
Accordingly , the adjourned
Congress's true appropriation
figure exceeds $157 billion.
Non-defense Spending 1 Up
No wonder that in the world's
cold appraisal of what's happen
ing to us here the U.S. dollar is
threatened and our gold reserve
has sunk to the lowest in more
than 30 years.
