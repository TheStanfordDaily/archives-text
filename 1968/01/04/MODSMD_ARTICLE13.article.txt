# Palmer Injured, Out For Season
## Tribe Wins 3 Of 7 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Stanford basketball coach
Howie Dallmar's Christmas holi
days were not exactly filled with
comfort and joy.
The Tribe dropped four of sev
en games and lost the services
of Bill Palmer, the 6-7 sopho
more whose impressive play had
earned him the starting center
position.
Palmer suffered a torn liga
ment against North Carolina
and will be out for the rest of
the season.
Howie Still Smiling
Despite these setbacks, Dall
mar is optimistic about the rest
of the season. The losses all
came at the hands of highly
rated teams, and the Indians
were not really outclassed by
any of them.

And Steve Kuchenbecher, al
though not as strong a rebound
er as Palmer, is expected to take
up a good bit of the slack at the
center position.
With a Grain of . . .
After finals week, the Tribe
made the pilgrimage to Salt
Lake City and lost to the Uni
versity of Utah 101-92. (Could
there be something to clean liv
ing after all?)
Stanford trailed the Utes by
only five at halftime, but Art
Harris and Mai McElwain both
fouled out early in the second
half, and Utah pulled away in the
end.
Top Ten
Two days later in Lawrence,
Kansas, the U. K. Jayhawks, like
Utah a pre-season top ten choice,
rolled over the Tribe, 72-54.
Faced with the perennial lack of
height up front and All-Ameri
can Jo-Jo White outside, the
Tribe simply ran out of gas.
Big Ten
Stanford returned home on
Dec. 22 and won two consecutive
thrillers from invading Big Ten
teams, Illinois and lowa.
The Tribe piled up a 13 point
lead against the Illini and held
off a late rally for a 74-72 win.
Art Harris dropped in 25 points,
the team's season high so far.
Against lowa the next night,
the Cards shot 55% from the
field and came on strong at the
end to win a see-saw battle 87-
86.
Far West Classic
After a four day layoff for
Christmas, Dallmar's troops
marched northward for the Far
West Classic at Portland. There
they were greeted by still an
other Top Ten opponent, this
time North Carolina, the even
tual tournament winner.
Palmer, playing in front of the

same fans who watched him at
Portland's Lincoln High, jumped
off to a fast start by hitting his
first shot and grabbing two
quick rebounds.
But with less than five min
utes gone, in a wild scramble for
a loose ball, North Carolina's
Larry Miller fell on Palmer's
leg from the blind side. The re
sultant sound of ripping liga
ments was matched only by the
anguished gnashing of Dallmar's
teeth. And that was that.
What A Relief!
Despite the loss of Palmer, the
Tribe put on a very respectable
show before losing, 87-78. Harris
and McElwain led the scoring
with 21 and 18 points respective
ly, and Kuchenbecher chipped in
12 in a relief role.
In the second round of the
tournament, Stanford got an aus
picious preview of Pacific Eight
action by dumping Oregon 68-64
in overtime.
After trailing by as many
as twelve in the second half, the
Tribe roared back to tie and then
held the Ducks to three points in
the overtime period. 53% sec
ond-half shooting and a well-bal
anced attack almost made Dall
mar forget about Palmer. Al
most.
Ivy Tigers
In the battle for the tourna
ment's fourth spot, the Prince
ton Tigers demonstrated that
they are definitely not of the
paper variety. The nationally
ranked (what else?) Ivy League
champs relegated Stanford to
sixth place out of the eight com
peting teams, 77-66.
Art Harris had a great night,
hitting 23 points and hauling
down 15 rebounds. But he got
little support, and the Tribe saw
its season mark dip below the
.500 mark to 4-5.
