The off-campus movement for
Stanford coeds now has political
power.
For the first time in the Uni
versity's history, a female stu
dent sits in the student legisla
ture as a representative for off
campus undergraduates.
She is Mary Sharp, one of the
59 seniors who moved off-cam
pus this quarter under a conces
sion last June by the Board of
Trustees. That ruling allowed up
to 100 senior women to move
off-acmpus. Previously, all un
dergraduate women under 23
were required to live in dormi
tories.
She said one of LASSU's goals
this year should be persuading
the University that the off-cam
pus privilege should be extended
to all senior, junior and sopho
more women.
