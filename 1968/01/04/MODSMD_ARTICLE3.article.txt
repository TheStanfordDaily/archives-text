# SCORE Scores With Euphorium
## 
### 
Sensory awareness exercises,
poetry, and experimental films
were dominant attractions at an
all-day Euphorium in Tresidder
Union yesterday.
The Free Euphorium was
sponsored by SCORE (Stanford
Committee on Radical Educa
tion), a campus front for the
Midpeninsula Free University,
which is barred from Stanford
facilities.
The Euphorium was to serve
as an introduction to Free Uni
versity courses, many of which
deal with psychological, sexual,
and sensory experimentation.
Discovering- the Brain
Operating all day was the
Brain Machine, a device to show
what is going on inside the brain
by detecting alpha waves.
A volunteer would sit in front
of a small black box topped wtth
a dozen flashing lights. Around
his head he wore a two-electrode
headband connected to the box.

Alpha waves, which can indi
cate levels of brain activity,
were then detected by a steady,
brighter flashing of the lights.
In the bioenergetic workshop,
a 25-year-old woman with a de
gree in psychology, who has
spent the past few months in the
Haight-Ashbury district, explain
ed "Back to the Womb," an ex
periment in "becoming."
In the experiment, one per
son, representing the mother
father image, holds in his lap
another, who represents the
child-image. The mother-father
image then places his thumb in
the "child's" mouth. After 40
minutes of such antics, one is
supposed to discover something
about himself through his part
ner.
Other attractions at the Eupho
rium were a discussion on diet
and health of Zen macrobiotics,
a question-and-answer period on
sexual morality today, and an
hour-long Indian music concert.
