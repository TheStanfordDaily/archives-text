### H. RENTON ROLPH 
A panel of three political ex
perts will discuss the campaign
of Sen. Eugene McCarthy for
President tonight at 8 in Cub
bereley Auditorium.
Robert McAfee Brown, pro
fessor of religion, George Lep
pert, professor of engineering,
and Gerald Hill, chairman of the
California Democratic Council,
will consider McCarthy's attempt
to unseat President Johnson by
attacking his Vietnam war pol
icy.
Brown, who has publicly sup
ported draft card burners, will
talk on "McCarthy the Man," an
analysis of the Minnesota sena
tor's background record and per
sonality. Rrown wrote speeches
and handled press work for Mc-
Carthy during the senator's 1952
congressional campaign. One of
the delegates to the National
Conference of Concerned Demo
crats in Chicago where Mc-
Carthy announced his candidacy
for the Presidency, Brown will

assume an active leadership role
in the current campaign both at
Stanford and throughout Califor
nia.
Hill, a McCarthy campaign or
ganizer, will discuss the sena
tor's plans for the California
Presidential primary in June.
President of the California Dem
ocratic Council and chairman of
the state CDC campaign on be
half of McCarthy, Hill is one
of the leaders of the nationwide
McCarthy effort. He is a Stan
ford graduate who practices law
in San Francisco.
Leppert, an unsuccessful Dem
ocratic candidate for Congress in
1966, will join Brown and Hill
in answering questions about
the local McCarthy drive.
The panel is sponsored by the
Stanford chapter of McCarthy
for President.
McCarthy himself has been in
vited by the Political Union to
visit Stanford, although there
has been no reply as yet.
Campaigning in the East yes
terday, the Minnesota senator
announced that he will enter the
March 12 New Hampshire pri
mary although he has no clear
indication of what kind of show
ing he can make against Presi
dent Johnson on the Vietnam is
sue.
McCarthy said his decision
commits him to opposing John
son in six primaries before next
summer's nominating conven
tion in Chicago. The six include
Oregon's on May 28 and Cali
fornia's on June 4. His decision
to campaign actively in New
Hampshire will force him to give
up plans for a foreign trip, in
cluding a proposed visit to Viet
nam, McCarthy said in an inter
view.
In lieu of a personal visit to
Vietnam ,the senator said he in
tends to question other senators
visiting Asia about their find
ings as well as newsmen who
have been close to the military
action.
He also commented that Vice-
President Humphrey, who op
poses his challenge to Johnson,

has been telling him (McCarthy)
to go to Vietnam to see the war
lor himself.
Planning to campaign in New
Hampshire for three weeks, Mc-
Carthy said that he will do some
traditional handshaking, "al
though I don't think the Viet
nam issue particularly lends it
self to that type of campaign
ing."
