# US University Poll
## Stanford More Leftist 
### 
When it comes to how to run
a university, Stanford students
have considerably different —
and more liberal — opinions than
their fellow students at other
U.S. colleges, according to a
recently-released survey.
Only a tiny minority of Stan
ford studnts (18 per cent) be
lieved student publications
should be cleared first with the
administration, for example,
while 44 per cent of the students
at other universities agreed with
the policy.
Does a college have the right
to ban speakers? No, according
to 82 per cent of the Stanford
ites, but across the nation, only
56 per cent of college freshmen
disagreed.
These findings and others are
the result of a nationwide poll
of college freshmen taken re
cently by the American Council
on Education. More than 900
Stanford freshmen were inter
viewed for the survey, which in
cluded 51 universities.
Survey quetsions ranged from
the students' backgrounds to
their future plans. "On the ques
tions pertaining to education
and how universities should be
run, the Stanford students came
much closer to the New Left
positions than did other students.
For example, only 22 per cent
of the Stanford frosh agreed
with the statement: "Colleges
are too lax on student protests."
Some 42 per cent of other stu
dents said they agreed.
More than half (51 per cent)
of the students responding to
the survey believed money is
the major benefit of a college
education, contrasted to the 25

per cent of Stanford students
with a similar belief.
Married women belong in the
home, according to 51 per cent
of U.S. students, but only 29
per cent at Stanford want to
keep them there.
An astounding 90 per cent of
the Stanford frosh plan to go
on to graduate school, and they
are far less likely to say they
want only an undergraduate de
gree. About 12 per cent at Stan
ford said they would be satis
fied with a bachelor's degree, but
nationwide, almost 37 per cent
said four years in college would
be enough.
About 36 per cent of the stu
dents at Stanford plan to obtain
master's degrees, 30 per cent
want doctorates, 11 per cent will
study for M.D. degrees, and sev
en per cent will go to law school.
But at the other universities
survyed, the picture is much dif
ferent, particularly at the higher
educational levels. Nationwide,
34 per cent will settle for a mast
er's, only 14 per cent intend to
win a doctorate, eight per cent
intend to go to medical school,
and a minute 2.7 per cent plan
to obtain law degrees.
The Stanford group told the
interviewers they were not par
ticularly interested in:
• Being well-off financially.
• Succeeding in their own bus
iness.
• Not being obligated to peo
ple.
• Obtaining recognition from
their fellow students.
On the other hand. Stanford
students were better at sailing
a boat, the study showed.
The Stanford students also ex
celled in describing the Bill of

Rights, using a slide rule, swim
ming a mile without stopping,
using Roberts Rules of Order,
and skiing.
A profile of the Stanford stu
dents' backgrounds revealed 24
per cent came from families
with incomes exceeding $25,000
per year and only 14 per cent
listed family incomes of less
than $10,000 a year.
The fathers of 37 per cent of
the Stanford frosh have post
graduate degrees along with
about 13 per cent of their moth
ers.
A cross-section of the univer
sity's racial make-up appears to
have shattered two basic Stan
ford myths.
First, Stanford is less lily
white than most U.S. univer
sities. About 2.5 per cent of the
Stanford freshmen are Ne
groes, but nationally, only 1.9
per cent are of Afro-Ameri
can descent.
Second, Stanford has about the
same percentage (9.5 per cent)
of students with Jewish back
grounds as other universities.
Stanford students appear to
be more interested in becoming
doctors, lawyers, research scien
tists, and professors, but more
of their colleagues in other
schools wants to become engi
neers, teachers, businessmen
and artists.
About 23 per cent of the Stan
ford freshmen said they had par
ticipated in a political demon
stration in the last year. Four
teen per cent thought the
chances were "very good" that
they would do so in college, but
on a nationwide average only
five per cent said they planned
to demonstrate.

The Stanford group told the
interviewers they were not par
ticularly interested in:
• Being well-off financially.
• Succeeding in their own bus
iness.
• Not being obligated to peo
ple.
• Obtaining recognition from
their fellow students.
On the other hand. Stanford
students were better at sailing
a boat, the study showed.
The Stanford students also ex
celled in describing the Bill of

Rights, using a slide rule, swim
ming a mile without stopping,
using Roberts Rules of Order,
and skiing.
A profile of the Stanford stu
dents' backgrounds revealed 24
per cent came from families
with incomes exceeding $25,000
per year and only 14 per cent
listed family incomes of less
than $10,000 a year.
The fathers of 37 per cent of
the Stanford frosh have post
graduate degrees along with
about 13 per cent of their moth
ers.
A cross-section of the univer
sity's racial make-up appears to
have shattered two basic Stan
ford myths.
First, Stanford is less lily
white than most U.S. univer
sities. About 2.5 per cent of the
Stanford freshmen are Ne
groes, but nationally, only 1.9
per cent are of Afro-Ameri
can descent.
Second, Stanford has about the
same percentage (9.5 per cent)
of students with Jewish back
grounds as other universities.
Stanford students appear to
be more interested in becoming
doctors, lawyers, research scien
tists, and professors, but more
of their colleagues in other
schools wants to become engi
neers, teachers, businessmen
and artists.
About 23 per cent of the Stan
ford freshmen said they had par
ticipated in a political demon
stration in the last year. Four
teen per cent thought the
chances were "very good" that
they would do so in college, but
on a nationwide average only
five per cent said they planned
to demonstrate.
When it comes to how to run
a university, Stanford students
have considerably different —
and more liberal — opinions than
their fellow students at other
U.S. colleges, according to a
recently-released survey.
Only a tiny minority of Stan
ford studnts (18 per cent) be
lieved student publications
should be cleared first with the
administration, for example,
while 44 per cent of the students
at other universities agreed with
the policy.
Does a college have the right
to ban speakers? No, according
to 82 per cent of the Stanford
ites, but across the nation, only
56 per cent of college freshmen
disagreed.
These findings and others are
the result of a nationwide poll
of college freshmen taken re
cently by the American Council
on Education. More than 900
Stanford freshmen were inter
viewed for the survey, which in
cluded 51 universities.
Survey quetsions ranged from
the students' backgrounds to
their future plans. "On the ques
tions pertaining to education
and how universities should be
run, the Stanford students came
much closer to the New Left
positions than did other students.
For example, only 22 per cent
of the Stanford frosh agreed
with the statement: "Colleges
are too lax on student protests."
Some 42 per cent of other stu
dents said they agreed.
More than half (51 per cent)
of the students responding to
the survey believed money is
the major benefit of a college
education, contrasted to the 25

per cent of Stanford students
with a similar belief.
Married women belong in the
home, according to 51 per cent
of U.S. students, but only 29
per cent at Stanford want to
keep them there.
An astounding 90 per cent of
the Stanford frosh plan to go
on to graduate school, and they
are far less likely to say they
want only an undergraduate de
gree. About 12 per cent at Stan
ford said they would be satis
fied with a bachelor's degree, but
nationwide, almost 37 per cent
said four years in college would
be enough.
About 36 per cent of the stu
dents at Stanford plan to obtain
master's degrees, 30 per cent
want doctorates, 11 per cent will
study for M.D. degrees, and sev
en per cent will go to law school.
But at the other universities
survyed, the picture is much dif
ferent, particularly at the higher
educational levels. Nationwide,
34 per cent will settle for a mast
er's, only 14 per cent intend to
win a doctorate, eight per cent
intend to go to medical school,
and a minute 2.7 per cent plan
to obtain law degrees.

cently by the American Council
on Education. More than 900
Stanford freshmen were inter
viewed for the survey, which in
cluded 51 universities.
Survey quetsions ranged from
the students' backgrounds to
their future plans. "On the ques
tions pertaining to education
and how universities should be
run, the Stanford students came
much closer to the New Left
positions than did other students.
For example, only 22 per cent
of the Stanford frosh agreed
with the statement: "Colleges
are too lax on student protests."
Some 42 per cent of other stu
dents said they agreed.
More than half (51 per cent)
of the students responding to
the survey believed money is
the major benefit of a college
education, contrasted to the 25

per cent of Stanford students
with a similar belief.
Married women belong in the
home, according to 51 per cent
of U.S. students, but only 29
per cent at Stanford want to
keep them there.
An astounding 90 per cent of
the Stanford frosh plan to go
on to graduate school, and they
are far less likely to say they
want only an undergraduate de
gree. About 12 per cent at Stan
ford said they would be satis
fied with a bachelor's degree, but
nationwide, almost 37 per cent
said four years in college would
be enough.
About 36 per cent of the stu
dents at Stanford plan to obtain
master's degrees, 30 per cent
want doctorates, 11 per cent will
study for M.D. degrees, and sev
en per cent will go to law school.
But at the other universities
survyed, the picture is much dif
ferent, particularly at the higher
educational levels. Nationwide,
34 per cent will settle for a mast
er's, only 14 per cent intend to
win a doctorate, eight per cent
intend to go to medical school,
and a minute 2.7 per cent plan
to obtain law degrees.
The Stanford group told the
interviewers they were not par
ticularly interested in:
• Being well-off financially.
• Succeeding in their own bus
iness.
• Not being obligated to peo
ple.
• Obtaining recognition from
their fellow students.
On the other hand. Stanford
students were better at sailing
a boat, the study showed.
The Stanford students also ex
celled in describing the Bill of

Rights, using a slide rule, swim
ming a mile without stopping,
using Roberts Rules of Order,
and skiing.
A profile of the Stanford stu
dents' backgrounds revealed 24
per cent came from families
with incomes exceeding $25,000
per year and only 14 per cent
listed family incomes of less
than $10,000 a year.
The fathers of 37 per cent of
the Stanford frosh have post
graduate degrees along with
about 13 per cent of their moth
ers.
A cross-section of the univer
sity's racial make-up appears to
have shattered two basic Stan
ford myths.
First, Stanford is less lily
white than most U.S. univer
sities. About 2.5 per cent of the
Stanford freshmen are Ne
groes, but nationally, only 1.9
per cent are of Afro-Ameri
can descent.
Second, Stanford has about the
same percentage (9.5 per cent)
of students with Jewish back
grounds as other universities.
Stanford students appear to
be more interested in becoming
doctors, lawyers, research scien
tists, and professors, but more
of their colleagues in other
schools wants to become engi
neers, teachers, businessmen
and artists.
About 23 per cent of the Stan
ford freshmen said they had par
ticipated in a political demon
stration in the last year. Four
teen per cent thought the
chances were "very good" that
they would do so in college, but
on a nationwide average only
five per cent said they planned
to demonstrate.
When it comes to how to run
a university, Stanford students
have considerably different —
and more liberal — opinions than
their fellow students at other
U.S. colleges, according to a
recently-released survey.
Only a tiny minority of Stan
ford studnts (18 per cent) be
lieved student publications
should be cleared first with the
administration, for example,
while 44 per cent of the students
at other universities agreed with
the policy.
Does a college have the right
to ban speakers? No, according
to 82 per cent of the Stanford
ites, but across the nation, only
56 per cent of college freshmen
disagreed.
