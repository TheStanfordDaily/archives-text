## 
### 
A new four-page newspaper,
"The Arena," is scheduled to be
distributed at Stanford today.
"We hope this publication will
become an outlet for students
unhappy with the prevailing dog
ma," editor Brien Benson writes
in an introductory editroial. Ben

son is a graduate business stu
dent.
The Arena contains articles on
the Young Republicans' recent
mock presidential election and
tutorial project in Mountain
View. Other articles criticize
former ASSU President Peter
Lyman, Dean of the Chapel B.

Davie Napier, and The Stanford
Daily.
Thomas Baker, Arena busi
ness manager and a member of
the Young Republicans, said last
night, "we have the feeling sorm
minority elements have be n
overemphasized" in The Dally.
