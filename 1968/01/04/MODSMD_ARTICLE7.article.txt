# Two New Parties On Primary Ballot
## 
### 
The California presidential bal
lot will more than likely include
two new parties in 1968, accord
ing to estimated party registra
tion returns. The newly formed
parties are the Peace and Free
dom Party, supporting both an
end to the war in Vietnam and
an end to racial injustice at
home, and the American Inde
pendent Party created for the ex
press purpose of running former
Alabama governor George C.
Wallace.
In the Stanford area the voter
breakdown for the Peace and
Freedom Party was: Palo Alto
1300, Stanford 300 (one out of

every five voters), East Palo
Alto 200, and Menlo Park 250.
In California, the Peace and
Freedom Party registered the
most of its voters in the Bay
Area Berkeley and San Fran
cisco in particular. Los Angeles
County ran a close second with
17,225 voters.
The American Independent
Party exceeded by 34,000 the 66,-
000 certified signatures required
by Tuesday to qualify on the
California ballot. The figures for
the Peace and Freedom Party
are reported to be 88,000 party
registrations. The exact figures
are unavailable until the still ar
riving votes are counted, and the
voters signatures are certified as
being valid.
On the national scene, the
American Independent Party
plans to run in 50 states although

Wallace exclud d Ohio because
of "a law written, in my opinion,
to keep a movement of this sort
off the ballot."
Dr. Richard White, midpenin
sula chapter chairman for the
Peace and Freedom Party, com
mented on the interaction of the
two extremely opposed parties
saying, "People began searching
us out when they found Wallace
was making it."
Although it is not clear wheth
er or not the American Inde
pendent Party plans to hold a
convention, Wallace commented
that it would most likely be held
in the same city as the two ma
jor party conventions "to sim
plify television coverage."
A convention for the Stanford-
Palo Alto area chapter of the
Peace and Freedom Party will be
held on Saturday, January 29,
at Tresidder Memorial Union.
