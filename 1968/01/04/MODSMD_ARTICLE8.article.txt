# Survey Reveals Greater Sex Life
## 
### 
College coeds are more likely
to enjoy their first experience
with sexual intercourse than did
the college girls of 20 years ago,
a nationwide study has shown.
The same seems to be true
for college males, although the
change has not been so great
as for females.
Dr. Paul H. Gebhard, who de
scribed the study's findings yes
terday, attributed the increased
enjoyment to a reduction of
guilt feelings associated with
premarital sex and to a growing
trend toward sexual equality.
"It is becoming respectable to
be an admittedly sexually re
sponsive female," he said. "The
female today is regarded less as
a sexual object to be exploited
and more as a human being with
rights to sexual expression."
Summer Study Held
Dr. Gebhard, a professor of
anthropology, is director of the
Institute for Sex Research at
Indiana University. The insti
tute, where the late Dr. Alfred
C. Kinsey did his pioneering re
search on sox behavior, conduc
ted the study last summer
among a national sample of
1200 college students. The cur
rent findings are being compared
with those of a similar study
of students in college during the
1940's and early 1950'5.
The data on first premarital
coitus were the first of the new
study's findings to be processed
by computer. Later analyses will
deal with such matters as atti
tudes toward sexual behavior,
extent of premarital sex, mas
turbation, petting and homosex
uality.
Speaking at the annual meet
ing of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science
at the Americana Hotel, Dr. Geb
hard described the first premari
tal coitus as "a crossing of a
Rubicon in life history."
Seld >m Only Once
"Once persons begin premar
ital coitus they seldom recant
remain abstinent until mar
riage," ho observed.
He added that the psychologi
cal and social importance of this
exp Tienco made it "an excellent
medium for elucidating changes

in sexual behavior and attitudes
which have occured over the
last few decades."
One thing that has not
changed much, Dr. Gebhard
said, is "the enormous differ
ence between how males and
females view their initial part
ner." "Females surrender their
virginity to males they love
whereas males are much less
emotionally involved," he added.
Fifty to 60 per cent of current
college females said their first
coitus was with someone they
lovd and planned to marry,
and 20 to 25 per cent said they
loved the male although mar
riage was not anticipated.
Few Feel Attached
But only 11 to 14 per cent of
the males said they loved and
planned to marry their first sex
ual partner, and 25 to 30 per
cent said they felt some emo
tional attachment to the girl but
did not love her.
Dr. Gebhard noted that there
was a small but definite trend
toward emotional attachment on
the part of the male, but that
still tended to be "oppor
tunistic" about sex. He added
that more females today tended
to have sexual intercourse with
men they loved but did not nec
essarily plan to marry.
As for female enjoyment of
the first coitus, 73 per cent of
freshmen, 60 per cent of sopho
mores, 63 per cent of juniors
and 65 per cent of seniors said
their experience was pleasur
able. This compares with 46,
48, 35 and 46 per cent, respec
tively, among college women
two decades ago.
For junior males, the percen
tages enjoying their first coitus
rose from 74 to 86 and for sen
ior males, rose from 65 to 89.
Dr. Gebhard commented that
the "first coitus is traditionally
marred by pain, embarrassment,
awkwardness and guilt."
"This is less true of the cur
rent college students than of
those in the past," he said.
The anthropologist reported
further that males were less
likely than ever to experience
coitus first with a prostitute.

college females said their first
coitus was with someone they
lovd and planned to marry,
and 20 to 25 per cent said they
loved the male although mar
riage was not anticipated.
Few Feel Attached
But only 11 to 14 per cent of
the males said they loved and
planned to marry their first sex
ual partner, and 25 to 30 per
cent said they felt some emo
tional attachment to the girl but
did not love her.
Dr. Gebhard noted that there
was a small but definite trend
toward emotional attachment on
the part of the male, but that
still tended to be "oppor
tunistic" about sex. He added
that more females today tended
to have sexual intercourse with
men they loved but did not nec
essarily plan to marry.
As for female enjoyment of
the first coitus, 73 per cent of
freshmen, 60 per cent of sopho
mores, 63 per cent of juniors
and 65 per cent of seniors said
their experience was pleasur
able. This compares with 46,
48, 35 and 46 per cent, respec
tively, among college women
two decades ago.
For junior males, the percen
tages enjoying their first coitus
rose from 74 to 86 and for sen
ior males, rose from 65 to 89.
Dr. Gebhard commented that
the "first coitus is traditionally
marred by pain, embarrassment,
awkwardness and guilt."
"This is less true of the cur
rent college students than of
those in the past," he said.
The anthropologist reported
further that males were less
likely than ever to experience
coitus first with a prostitute.
College coeds are more likely
to enjoy their first experience
with sexual intercourse than did
the college girls of 20 years ago,
a nationwide study has shown.
The same seems to be true
for college males, although the
change has not been so great
as for females.
Dr. Paul H. Gebhard, who de
scribed the study's findings yes
terday, attributed the increased
enjoyment to a reduction of
guilt feelings associated with
premarital sex and to a growing
trend toward sexual equality.
"It is becoming respectable to
be an admittedly sexually re
sponsive female," he said. "The
female today is regarded less as
a sexual object to be exploited
and more as a human being with
rights to sexual expression."
Summer Study Held
Dr. Gebhard, a professor of
anthropology, is director of the
Institute for Sex Research at
Indiana University. The insti
tute, where the late Dr. Alfred
C. Kinsey did his pioneering re
search on sox behavior, conduc
ted the study last summer
among a national sample of
1200 college students. The cur
rent findings are being compared
with those of a similar study
of students in college during the
1940's and early 1950'5.
The data on first premarital
coitus were the first of the new
study's findings to be processed
by computer. Later analyses will
deal with such matters as atti
tudes toward sexual behavior,
extent of premarital sex, mas
turbation, petting and homosex
uality.
Speaking at the annual meet
ing of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science
at the Americana Hotel, Dr. Geb
hard described the first premari
tal coitus as "a crossing of a
Rubicon in life history."
Seld >m Only Once
"Once persons begin premar
ital coitus they seldom recant
remain abstinent until mar
riage," ho observed.
He added that the psychologi
cal and social importance of this
exp Tienco made it "an excellent
medium for elucidating changes

in sexual behavior and attitudes
which have occured over the
last few decades."
One thing that has not
changed much, Dr. Gebhard
said, is "the enormous differ
ence between how males and
females view their initial part
ner." "Females surrender their
virginity to males they love
whereas males are much less
emotionally involved," he added.
Fifty to 60 per cent of current
college females said their first
coitus was with someone they
lovd and planned to marry,
and 20 to 25 per cent said they
loved the male although mar
riage was not anticipated.

But only 11 to 14 per cent of
