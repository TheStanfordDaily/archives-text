# Academic Council To Meet Today
## 
### 
The Academic Council will
consider proposals to abolish the
activity requirements and al
low experimental cross-depart
mental majors at its winter quar
ter meeting today at 4:15 p.m.
in the Physics lecture hall.
Both proposals will be effec
tive immediately if approved by
the Council, which consists of
all 940 permanent Stanford fac
ulty.
The Council will also vote on
a recommendation to ban all
military recruiting from cam
pus until Selective Service Di
rector Gen. Lewis B. Hershey
withdraws his Oct. 26 letter sug
gesting induction as punishment
for student protestors.
The recommendation, which
has been unanimously approved
by the Council's Executive Com
mittee, will be submitted to
President Wallace Sterling if
passed. The Executive Commit
tee will also meet today at 3:00
p.m.
Exemptions Asked
Columbia University barred
military recruiting Nov. 21 in
response to Hershey' letter.
The resolution uofore the
Council reads:
"Resolved: that Star," rd Uni
versity bar military recruiting
from the campus until the posi
tion taken in General Hershey's
letter is modified so that con
scription will not b r > taken as
a punitive step against protest.
Our action is not intended in any
sense as a reflection upon the

recruiting practices of the arm d
services, but is an expression of
the University's objection to the
use of the draft to suppress dis
sent."
The Council will also be asked
to permit its G>n >ral Studies
Committee to grant individual
exemptions from the Univer
sity's general studies require
ments. Students would receivc
exemptions only for "compel
ling reasons," and not to relieve
them of requirements they
simply neglected to fulfill.
Special Degrees
If the Council abolishes th?
activity requirement, undergrad
uates will no longer have to take
six non-credit units in extracur
ricular activities, including two
units in physical education. Af
ter two years of debate, Gen
eral Studies Committee finally
decided Oct. 11 to recommend
abandoning the activity require
ment because it "has outlived its
usefulness."
The other major proposal be
fore the Council would set up
an experimental program of in
terdepartmental majors for 20
students. Each student would
submit a custom-designed list
of courses drawn from several
departments, and receive a spe
cial degree.
In other business, Executive
Committee Chairman Kenneth
J. Arrow will submit a progress
report on the plan to replace the
Council with an "Academic Sen
ate," a smaller, representative
body.

The Council will also be asked
to permit its G>n >ral Studies
Committee to grant individual
exemptions from the Univer

exemptions only for "compel

them of requirements they

Special Degrees
If the Council abolishes th?
activity requirement, undergrad
uates will no longer have to take
six non-credit units in extracur
ricular activities, including two
units in physical education. Af
ter two years of debate, Gen
eral Studies Committee finally
decided Oct. 11 to recommend
abandoning the activity require
ment because it "has outlived its
usefulness."
The other major proposal be
fore the Council would set up
an experimental program of in

students. Each student would
submit a custom-designed list
of courses drawn from several
departments, and receive a spe
cial degree.
In other business, Executive
Committee Chairman Kenneth
J. Arrow will submit a progress
report on the plan to replace the
Council with an "Academic Sen
ate," a smaller, representative
body.

DOORS AND WALLS — A workman installs a solid wood door
across a stairway in Storey house over the Christmas vacation. All
eight girls' row houses had doors installed to seal off upper floors,
reducing fire hazards. Open stairways were also enclosed by walls,
and front doors were re-hinged to swing open in an outward direc
tion. The University paid $23,000 for the alterations, which were
requested by Stanta Clara county fire marshal Is.
The Academic Council will
consider proposals to abolish the
activity requirements and al
low experimental cross-depart
mental majors at its winter quar
ter meeting today at 4:15 p.m.
in the Physics lecture hall.
Both proposals will be effec
tive immediately if approved by
the Council, which consists of
all 940 permanent Stanford fac
ulty.
The Council will also vote on
a recommendation to ban all
military recruiting from cam
pus until Selective Service Di
rector Gen. Lewis B. Hershey
withdraws his Oct. 26 letter sug
gesting induction as punishment
for student protestors.
The recommendation, which
has been unanimously approved
by the Council's Executive Com
mittee, will be submitted to
President Wallace Sterling if
passed. The Executive Commit
tee will also meet today at 3:00
p.m.
Exemptions Asked
Columbia University barred
military recruiting Nov. 21 in
response to Hershey' letter.
The resolution uofore the
Council reads:
"Resolved: that Star," rd Uni

from the campus until the posi
tion taken in General Hershey's
letter is modified so that con
scription will not b r > taken as
