# Two Minutes of Haight
## In Defense Of Dean Napier Who Doesn't Really Need It 
### Tim Haight 
"OK, If war and riots are aw
oourant, reasons the Dean, let's
talk about them . . . And so he
does in sermon after sermon
after sermon. Don't worry if
man's personal relation with
Christ isn't often mentioned . . .
Only a few students are more
Interested in Christianity than
U.S. poliey in Vietnam and
Watts, and they don't eount for
much." — The Arena, Stanford's
new Journal of "critieal intel
lect."
After the sledgehammer dull
ness of my most ironic Christ
mas, where hymns of peace
mingled with truce violations
and new trial balloons for a
wider war, Stanford — and the
clean slate of a new quarter —
looked good. It coudn't last. It
didn't.
The sour taste in the mouth,
above and beyond Tresidder cof
fee, is left courtesy of The Are
na, a magazine dedicated to '.'the
free exchange of ideas, . . . a
rousing political awareness, . . .
debunking phonies," etc. In fact,
The Arena's first issue presents
some saddening don't-rock-the
boat doublethink.
This is not to condemn the
magazine which is a noble effort
to start a dialogue where one
is desperately needed. It de
serves our support and contri
butions. But until it does better,
The Arena will simply be where
they throw the bull.
'Cub* Napier
A specific example of this
thinking comes in the back-page
article on Dean Napier, some of
which is cited above.
The general argument is that,
to become controversial and
talked-about, Dean Napier has
catered to the interests of a
plurality of students on the cam
pus and talked about war and
riots rather than about God,
which should be his subject mat
ter. The Dean is likened to the
cub reporter, who knows how to
attract a readership.
Has it ever occurred to those
who call for more Christ in Me
morial Church that the war and
our sad plight at home might
be the religious person's greatest
dilemma? Some people think so,
such as Rabbi Abraham Heschel.
Personal Religious Problems
He writes, "At this hour Viet
nam is our most urgent, our
most disturbing religious prob
lem, a challenge to the whole
nation as well as a challenge to
every one of us as an individual.
"When a person is sick, in
danger or in misery, all reli
gious duties recede, all rituals
are suspended, except one: to
have life and relieve pain.
"Vietnam is a personal prob
lem. To speak about God and
remain silent on Vietnam is
blasphemous. ... In the sight of
so many thousands of civilians
and soldiers slain, injured, crip
pled, of bodies emaciated, of
forests destroyed by fire, God
confronts us with this question:
"Where art thou?"
Where Is Peace?
Where are we? Are we com
fortable behind our twentieth
century American religion that
we are the "soldiers of Christ"
battling the forces of athiestic
darkness? Are we in church on
Christmas eve singing, "Peace i

on the earth, good will to men,
From heav'n's all gracious
King," while we consider the
absenee of peace an inappropri
ate topic for the church?
Dean Napier's answer is that
if God is anything, he is love.
And love cannot stop at the
border of the white section of
town or on our side (if only
there were one!) of the battle
line in Vietnam.
We cannot talk of our rela
tionship to Christ without talk
ing about our relationship to
pride, personal, and national,
war, racism, or alienation.
'I Can't Help It'
In his speech to the freshmen
in Pre-Reg week of 1966, Dean
Napier quoted a Black Nation
alist arrested during the Watts
riots. The Black Nationalist
said, "The police beat me on the
head after they handcuffed me.
I know hate isn't going to do
any good. But I'm not going to
love a white.
"Nobody can define love to
me. I might want to make love
to a white, but I can't love a
white. And I'm tired of hearing
that old thing about the good
old Jesus Christ, how he walks
on water with his blue eyes and
blond hair. The cross is a sign
of death, and that's all there is
to it."
Dean Napier then said, "This
is the cost of too many of us
living for too long in a yellow
submarine, submerged in our
own sea of green, blind and in
sensitive to, insulated from the
lonely people, or the hopeless
people, or the hungry people, or
the broken people. This is the
cost, in short, of lovelessness.
Death Of Love
For the church, it means the
reduction of Christ to a hand
some blond magician: and the
conversion of a symbol of in
finite love and light and compas
sion, the cross, to one of hate
and darkness and death, and
the verdict, even of some theolo
gians, that God is dead. If God
is love, and love is lost, then to
be sure God is dead."
Unfortunately The Arena's ar
gument, that religion is not con
cerned with the horror and suf
fering of the world, at least not
where it might criticize our gov
ernment's policy, is quite com
mon. It grows out of a tradi
tion of a private person in a
private life.
The private person's morality
extends to his daily encounters,
his family, his church, the pay
ment of his taxes. It does not
extend to the acts of a govern
ment constituted in his name.
It does not analyse the conse
quences of his system of living
—economic and sociological as
well as political, or the fortui
tousness of his well-being.
Ostrich Philosophy
The private person thinks he
deserved to be born in the most
powerful, most prosperous coun
try, and that the less fortunate
deserved their lot, too. His key
phrase is "do it yourself."
This thinking is as repugnant
as the all too common cry of
the survivor of the airline crash
in which the other 80 passeng
ers were killed. The survivor
calls the fall of the cards a
miracle. The other 80 (and those

who fall in war, and the napalm
ed Vietnamese civilian) don't say
him nay.
It is this head-in-the-sand
morality, like the exhortation
to keep deep religious dilemmas
out of our relationship with
Christ, that must not prevail. If
this is the offering of The Arena,
then its editorial aims are paro
died, indeed.
