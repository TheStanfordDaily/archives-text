# Kennedy's Death
## 
### BRUCE MERRY 
The assassination of John F.
Kennedy is a topic which ought
to be an election issue in the
U.S.A. this year. Like the "war"
in Vietnam (or should one say
"the war in Indochina") the kill
ing of our last President will
almost certainly not be an elec
tion issue in 1968.
There are a few people in
North America who believe they
know why and how Kennedy
was shot. One of them wrote
Rush To Judgment, (Stanford
Daily, Thursday May 4, 1967;
Stanford Daily Magazine, Fri
day, May 26, 1967) and is called
Mark Lane.
Currently working on the
case (Ramparts, January 1968)
is James Garrison, probably the
most brilliant District Attorney
in Louisiana. So much so that
they have even mentioned his
name in connection with the
next Governorship of that state.
Both Garrison and Lane (Play
boy interviews in 1967 vols.; et
al.) have been accused of mad
ness, ambition or McCarthyism
as a result of their almost un
aided investigation of what they
consider, at worst wrongly, to
be the truth.
It is interesting that Mr. John
Kaplan, writing an apparently
definitive article on the assassin
ation in The American Scholar,
a year ago suggested that all
criticism of the sceptical variety
was otiose and bad if it doubted
Earl Warren's Commission find
ing that Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald
was the lone (and Leftist)
assassin of the President.
More recently the head of All
Souls at Oxford, Mr. John Spar-

row, wrote an article exorcising
Lane, Garrison, Epstein a* the
"Domonologists" and generally
concluding with confidence in
the Warren Commission's han
dling of the top-level enquiry
called by the President who suc
ceeded Kennedy.
Sparrow's opinion, like Kap
lan's, is exactly as good as that
of Arnold Toynbee or Bertrand
Russell, both of whom happen
to have (like myself) absolutely
opposing ones.
The ironic thing is that most
of us, you and me and the man
who fears the C.I.A. included,
feel a strange doubt hovering
between the temples that maybe
Oswald did not act alone, that
maybe the Commission should
at least be required to defend
Lyndon Johnson from the asser
tion implied by Garrison and
dramatised by Barbara Garson
that Lyndon Johnson still has
not made clear his relation to
the whole sordid issue.
If Johnson is now being stung
in public journals, and if over
sixty percent of the American
people, when polled, expresses
a disbelief in the Warren re
sults, could not the burden of
proof be said to lie on the Presi
dent's shoulder and on no
other's?
It was Lyndon Johnson who
elected Chief Justice Earl War
ren to head the Commission. In
our opinion Warren was elected
as a sop to liberals specifically
to perform the vastest and most
insidious cover-up job in the
history of justice. Why is the
assassination to be quietly
buried in the Government cen
sored archives until we are all
too old to read evidence that
should cause it to be, at the
very least, reconsidered?
What is now felt is that the
whole thing was done with
walkie-talkies to attain syncro
nised firing from the at least
three different rifles that were
used in the assassination. The
Tippit-Oswald fracas was sup
posed to result in a simulta
neous shooting in which they
would create a diversion permit
ting the real assassins (Ruby?
Ferrie? Bertrand?) to get away.
But Oswald was not hit by the
two snipers. Seeing Tippit fall,
he realized in a flash that the
u 11 r a-conservative conspiracy
had intended all along merely
to use him as the fall-guy ("I'm
just a Patsy"; Gov. Connally:
"My God, they are going to get
all of us") and therefore he
rushed home.
He got a pistol, acted like a
doomed man (which he was,
pace Ruby's cancer) and then
suffered that strange justice
which allowed Kennedy to die in
cross-fire but could not protect
his supposed assaillant from
common assault.
It is high time the whole
Assassination question was re
openedâ€”by Lyndon Johnson.
