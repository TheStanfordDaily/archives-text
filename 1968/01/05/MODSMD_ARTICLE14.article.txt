## 'Cat' Announces Retirement 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I am disgusted with the de
ductive ability of the Stanford
Police Department and with the
Daily's coverage of the case of
the missing organ pipes. It was
an unfortunate coincidence that
shortly after my visit to Me
morial Church an inventory of
the organ pipes was taken, the
result being that 19 pipes were
discovered missing and another
found damaged beyond repair—
a loss of one thousand dollars.
I was an obvious suspect as the
police had plenty of evidence
of my visit into the bowels of
the organ in late November.
However, upon further investi
gation the police would have
realized that I am not the one
who removed or damaged
pipes — there were far more
valuable (and more market
able!) items in the Bender Room,
the Museum, and Hoover Tower,
which were not missing after
my visits. In spite of all evi
dence to the contrary, the po
lice, and the Daily in its libelous
article, judged me guilty.
Neither the Stanford Police
nor the Daily had the insight to
consider the possibility of an
other party or two (or 19) who
had visited the room in which
the organ pipes wore kept but
who were not as open about
their visit as they had more rea

son to keep it secret. However,
the danger still exists that the
police will not understand or
will be too proud to admit their
mistake. Therefore, in order to
avoid being falsely accused of
further transgressions, I here
with announce my retirement
as Night Watchman of The
Farm.

• Silent Flicks
Editor, The Daily:
In response to numerous com
plaints from members of the
Stanford community, we would
like to make clear the policy
of the Associated Students re
garding the ASSU Sunday
Flicks. We perfectly understand
the traditional nature of the
Flicks, but the growing dissatis
faction with the behavior of stu
dents last quarter has called
for some action to be taken.
The policy for the future will
be this: Traditionally appropri
ate comments on the movies and
antics of the Coyote will not be
disturbed. However, any exces
sive noise (including cap pis
tols and other noise-makers), or
any unwarranted obscenities will
be sufficient cause for removal
from the auditorium. The Stu
dent Police will enforce this.
The relatively few people to

whom this refers will undoubt
edly be displeased, but from
the comments we have received
and the letters to the Editor it
seems that the rest of the com
munity will welcome the change.
