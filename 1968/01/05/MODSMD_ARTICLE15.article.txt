# No Set Policy For Jailed Protesters
## 
### MICHAEL MORTON (Second of Two Parts) 
The local leader of the Re
sistance has received an order
to report for induction within
the month, and has stated he
will refuse the order; soon per
haps, all war and draft resisters
will have to take this step or
abandon their quest.

No general policy is expected
concerning the unreleased stu
dents arrested during the most
recent demonstrations at the
Oakland Induction Center, Dean
of Students Joel Smith said yes
terday.
Smith stated he would prefer
to handle the cases on an "in
dividual basis" rather than
make a blanket statement, with
the primary consideration being
whether the particular student
would have enough time re
maining to profit from the quar
ter.
With regard to possible prob-

lems with registration, Associ
ate Registrar Robert Houghton
pointed out that the fee for late
registration never exceeds $10,
but that, as a general rule, reg
istration is not permitted after
the first three weeks of instruc
tion.
No Decision
The dilemma of faculty mem
bers still being detained in Oak
land —and what to do about
their classes—is "under consid
eration," according to Provost
Richard Lyman.
Lyman also stated that the
cases of late-returning students
would be considered under the
same rules applied to all mem-

bers of the University commun
ity.
Economics professor John
Gurley reported that those ar
rested as first offenders in the
Dec. 18 and 19 demonstrations
are scheduled for release from
Santa Rita tomorrow and Sun
day.
Gurley asked that Stanford
faculty and staff be present at
9 a.m. both days to greet those
released from prison.
Those arrested as second
offenders still face more than
25 days in jail. From this rises
the problem of registration and
teaching for Stanford faculty
and students arrested.

Christmas was somewhat less
than merry for the more than
200 demonstrators who chose to
spend their holidays as tenants
of the Oakland penal system.
The vacation got off to a poor
start as Judge Delmar Brobst
doubled, and in some cases more
than quadrupled the sentences
he had meted out for similar
offenses during "Stop the Draft
Week."
Then, on Christmas Day, over
150 pacifists turned out to seren
ade the inmates with holiday
carols. However, it is not likely
that the jailed protestors heard
the good cheer of their com
patriots from the opposite side
of the jail, in which they were
being held.
Bah, Humbug
.Requests from both the carol
ers and folk-singer Joan Baez,
also jailed after the demonstra
tions, to be allowed to sing for
the prisoners were refused by
the officers in charge.
In addition, the female in
mates, including once again
Miss Baez and her mother, held
a sit-in in the prison dining
room. All involved subsequently
went limp, forcing the police to
carry them back to their cells.
Retribution was immediately
forthcoming from prison of
ficials: three days of bread and
milk, and suspension of all mail,
commissary, and visiting priv
ileges. However, the women in
volved stated the privileges had
been revoked before the sit-in,
and that the protest was made
to demand an explanation.
Further, Security Sergeant
Roy Souza reports that all priv
ileges have been withdrawn
from male inmates "because
they're not obeying the prison
rules."
However, bookstore-owner
and War Resisters League mem
ber Roy Kepler states that the
men had asked to bathe and

shave in accord with the rules
but were denied permission by
prison guards. Kepler also said
that two protestors were sick on
arrival at the jail, but that the
police refused to treat them un
til other inmates initiated a
hunger strike.
