## Cal Dues Made Voluntary 
### 
The administration at BER
KELEY has made voluntary the
payment of all dues to the stu
dent government. The action was
taken following a decision that
the student government had
been conducting student elec
tions illegally by permitting
graduate students to vote in
elections.
The Associated Students by
laws have no provision for grad
uate students voting in elections.
Dues in the student group
were collected from all under
graduates but not from graduate
students.
The student association will be
permitted to collect mandatory
dues from undergraduates when
it promises to uphold its own
by-laws. Grad students will be
permitted to vote if they pay the
dues required of the undergrads.

The President of AMHERST
COLLEGE has refused to ex
tend open house hours saying
that the present hours are not
enforced, and that the hours
will not be extended until they
are.
The proposal for the extended
hours was made by the joint
student-faculty College Council.
It had asked that the hours be
extended to 11:30 p.m. on week
days and 12:30 p.m. on week
ends.
The president did however ac
cept the council's recommenda-

tion that norm punishings be
set up for infractions of the
present rules.

Curfews have been abolished
for all women except freshmen
at HARPUR COLLEGE, a state
school in New York. The college
hopes to install a key system
similar to that now in effect at
Stanford, whereby the room key
opens the front door of the
dorm.
The college will also put an
envelope in each room for the
telephone number where the stu
dent can be reached when on an
overnight.

TRINITY COLLEGE no long
er will require its entering fresh
man to make the traditional fifty
dollar deposit. Instead the stu
dents must sign a pledge signi
fying their intention to enroll
in the fall.
"The $50 deposit requirement
runs counter to the spirit of our
dealings with a candidate for ad
mission which are characterized
by frankness, honesty, and mu
tual respect. Why should we ac
cept at face value a candidate's
assertions about himself and
then place a dollar value on his
word that he intends to accept
our invitation?" said W. Howie

Muir, the school's director of
admissions.

just released by the National In
terfraternity Conference re
veals.

KEN YON COLLEGE will in
augurate a five-year program
which will lead to the simulta
neous awarding of both a bache
lor's and a master's degrees. The
unusual feature of the program
is that the foutrh year is spent
abroad.
The program was started be
cause the Kenyon administration
felt that a "junior year abroad"
was frequently detrimental to a
student's course of studies be
cause he lost an opportunity to
take many courses at his home
college. The extra year provides
an opportunity to take these
courses.
