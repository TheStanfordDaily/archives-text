# Draft Board Acts
## Protestor Indicted 
### 
California draft boards took
action against 112 state youths
last fall who were accused of
burning, mutilating or turning
in their draft cards.
One Contra Costa county
youth has already been indicted
for burning his draft classifica
tion card. It was the first such
indictment in the area and, ac
cording to U.S. Attorney Cecil
Poole, follows only 21 other such
indictments in the country.
John R. Peet, of Contra Costa
county, burned his card on the
steps of Walnut Creek's City
Hall August 18 as the climax
of a three-day anti-Vietnam war

vigil. If convicted he could get
five years in prison and a $10,000
fine.
Selective Service officials said
Wednesday that 21 California
men were declared delinquent
and became eligible for imme
diate induction. Another 17 were
classified 1-A making them li
able for normal induction.
Others were sent warning no
tices directing them to explain
or justify their actions to their
local draft boards.
Lt. Col. Thomas Jensen, Cali
fornia's deputy director of Se
lective Service, said the warning
notices allow protestors to re
store their good standing.
