# Law Students Back Anti-War Activities
## 
### 
More than three hundred law
students from 20 of the nation's
leading law schools including
Stanford sent a letter to Presi
dent Johnson last month refus
ing to participate in military
service in Vietnam.
Thirteen students at Stanford
signed the letter. The University
of California Law School had
95 students sign. New York Uni
versity had 37 signers; Harvard,
31; and Hastings, 29.
Assistant to the Dean David
LeLower said the decision by
the students to sign was "very
much in the sector of private
decision-making. There is noth
ing inconsistent in being in
volved in the study of law and
acting on political problems."
The students who signed the
letter call themselves "Law Stu
dents Against The War." The
organization claimed in a news
release, "Never before have rep
resentatives of the legal pro-

fession advocated disrespect for
the law."
The students said that they
felt there would be a large scale
breakdown in the legal frame
work and institutions of the na
tion unless the President ceases
to pursue his current Vietnam
policies.
The letter said, "We cannot
condone the clear disregard for
human lives, both American and
Vietnamese, nor can we sanction
the American commitment to a
course of military force and vio
lence in complete disregard of
the grave dangers that accomp
any such a policy, for, as stu
dents of law, we cannot support
the use of force or violence in
the solution of social or political
problems."
The organization's news re
lease said the students stated
that they have participated and
will continue to be active in all
facets of the anti-war movement
until the American role in Viet
nam is "altered significantly."
