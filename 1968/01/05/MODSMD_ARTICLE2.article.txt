## Harvard Adopts Pass-Fail 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
The faculty of Harvard Uni
versity has approved a pass-fail
marking system permitting stu
dents to take courses pass-fail
to meet major and General Stu
dies requirements.
The catch is that the students
must obtain the permission of
the instructor involved for Gen
eral Studies courses and th-> de
partment in which the student is
majoring to take major courses
pass-fail.
The students may take one

of their courses each semester
pass-fail. Each student at Har
vard takes four courses a semes
ter. There is no limit to the total
units which may be taken pass
fail.
Stanford students may take
no more than 27 units pass-fail
and those courses may not be
taken for General Studies or
major requirements.
Rapid Approval
The new system was approved
by the faculty after only one
hour of debate, surprising the

Harvard administration by the
rapidity with which the faculty
approved the change.
According to one professor
the change was approved so
quickly to show the faculty's
faith in the student advisory
group which made the proposal
originally.
The professor said that denial
of the proposal "would show
that w -1 don't have much faith
in the stui n nts â€” that we think
that th >y would use the added
freedom to loaf."
David Reisman, professor of
social science, stated another rea
son for the change. "We should
bencouraging stud nts to play
from weakness instead of
strength, but the system here
puts pressure on the student
not to extend himself in
where he's awkward b-'cuse he
fears not doing brilliantly."
One of the problems forseen
by the Harvard faculty was that
larg > lecture courses would be
jammel by students wanting to
take courses pass-fail. To forstall
this possibility the faculty de
cided that an instructor may
limit the number of students tak
ing the course pass-fail.
However, the sentiment ex
press d at the faculty meeting
was opposed to an instructor
completely forbi 'ding students

to tak" his course pass-fail, as
can happen here.
The faculty refused to consid r
alternate plans to reduce the
course-load to three courses a
semester or allow students to
take pass-fail courses as a fifth
course.
It is oxpected that all m jor
departments, including the sci
"nces, will allow their students
to take all but basic courses pass
fail.
