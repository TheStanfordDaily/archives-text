# 46 Stanford Women Back Draft Resisters
## 
### 
A group of 46 women last
month signed a statement sup
porting men who refuse to be
drafted.
Their complicity statements
"put them in equal jeopardy
with the draft card burners. Un
able themselves to refuse in
duction, the women signed the
statement to encourage draft
age men to refuse induction into
the military.
An associate dean of student's
wife joined signers of the peti
tion who claimed they will "en
courage, aid, and abet," those
who refuse to be drafted.
Jane Fowler Wyman, wife of
William Wyman, associate dean
of students, and Elisabeth
Chowning, wife of John Chown
ing, assistant professor of mu-

sic were among those included
in the anti-draft drive, organized
by Penny Hill and Amy Newell.
"We explicitly encourage, aid,
and abet this civil disobedience
and thus place ourselves in
equal jeopardy with draft re
fusers," according to the peti
tion. "We cannot leave them to
take the risks alone for what is
the basic act of conscience in our
time."
The petition notes the women
placed themselves in violation of
federal law by signing:
"Any person who ... knowing
ly counsels, aids, or abets an
other to refuse... registration
or service in the armed forces,"
if convicted, faces "imprison
ment for not more than five
years or a fine of not more than
$10,000 or both."
