# NCAA Winners' Debut
## Swimmers Host Canadian Champs 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's NCAA champion
swimmers open their "prove it"
season against the Canadian col
legiate champion, Simon Fraser
College of Vancouver, Saturday,
2 p.m., at Stanford's Encina
Pool.
Simon Fraser is taking an
ambitious 14-team tour of the
West Coast which includes Stan
ford, USC, and UCLA—first,
second, and fifth in the NCAA's
last year.
Last spring Indian swimmers
overturned defending champion
USC and a touted Indiana squad
amidst a flurry of NCAA rec
ords to bring home Stanford's
first NCAA title in 15 years.
Seven NCAA Records
Stanford now owns 7 of 17
collegiate records. The Cards
won both 400 and 800 freestyle
relays in American record time
—with 8 different swimmers in
the act.
All but two members of the
NCAA squad return, but it's a
big two. Gone are team captain
Jim Laney and Greg Bucking
ham.
Buckingham cracked his own
500 free mark by 4 seconds,
beat Don Schollander in the 200
free in American record time,
took second in the 1650, and an
chored the gold medal 800 free
relay in the NCAA's. Bucking
ham also set an NCAA record
in the 1000 freestyle.
Three Golds For Roth
Olympic individual medley
champion Dick Roth returns to
action with NCAA records in
both 200 and 400 IM's and a
share of the Indians' 800 free
relay record. Roth, a junior,
also took sixth in the 200 back
stroke last year, but may con
centrate on breaststroke this
season.
Newly-elected team captain
Bob Momsen surged to a silver
medal performance in the Pan
Am games last summer in
Winnipeg. Momsen has picked
up the silver at the NCAA's the
past two years.
Luis Nicolao, former world
record holder for 100 meters
butterfly, led off the Cards' 400
relay at the NCAA's, took sec
ond in the 100 fly, and sixth in
the 200 fly.
Mike Wall, a senior distance

freestyler and member of the
1964 Olympic team, has a repu
tation for clutch performances
that has baffled place-predictors
for years. Wall took third in the
1650 last year, placed in both
200 and 500 freestyles, and
swam the 800 free relay.
Pete Siebert's surprising per
formances netted him third
place in the 200 IM, fifth in the
400 IM, and a piece of the 800
free relay. Siebert may see a lot
of 200 butterfly races this sea
son.
Senior sprinter Bill Meyer
pegged in the fastest leg, 45.8,
in the 400 free relay at the
NCAA's. Meyer also anchored
Santa Clara Swim Club's gold
medal 400 medley relay at the
Indoor AAU's, teaming up with
Momsen and Nicolao.
Sheerer Returns
Gary Sheerer broke the NCAA
freshman record for 200 free
three years ago, but since then
concentrated on water polo.
Sheerer was voted Outstanding
Player of the Pan Am games
and is three times collegiate All-
American. Sheerer returned to
swimming with vigor in Decem
ber, and the results have been
startling.
Morgan Manning hit 46.1 for
his leg of Stanford's victorious
400 free relay last spring, and
returns with sprint power to
burn. Junior Jeff Hammett and
transfer Ken Hammer give the
Cards strong depth in the
sprints. Hammer was JC state
champion in the 100 free last
year in 47.7 and second in the
50.
Bill Kee, though faced with a
pressing lack of time last year,
carried off the conference 100
backstroke title and later led
off Stanford's fifth place 400
medley relay.
Bright Light Diver
Sophomore diver Bill Main
took sixth in low board and
seventh in high board competi
tion in the National AAU's last
summer.
Doug Miller in the 200 butter
fly and Bob Hart in backstroke
and individual medley could
pick up the points that make the
difference in the NCAA's this
year.
Sophomore butterflier J i m
Nickoloff and breaststroker
Nick Dondero will be vying for

NCAA places, as will sopho
more medleyman Richie Wil
liams.
Cards Picked Third
Swimming World magazine
picked Stanford third behind
USC and Indiana, figuring the
loss of Buckingham to be de
cisive. Swimming World pegged
the Cards second last year.
Stanford Coach Jim Gaugh
ran noted that the Cards will
have to pick up lots of little
points in the consolation finals,
and have some of Stanford's
now infamous "relative un
knowns" come through again.
"We're the underdogs again, and
that suits me fine. We won't
be as far away as they think."
The Tribe faces one of its
toughest tests of the year Jan.
13 when the varsity take on the
most powerful freshman team
in NCAA history. The Stanford
freshman roster reads like the
top ten high shool Ail-American
list.

Sheerer Returns
Gary Sheerer broke the NCAA

the Cards second last year.
Stanford Coach Jim Gaugh
ran noted that the Cards will
have to pick up lots of little

Stanford's NCAA champion
swimmers open their "prove it"
season against the Canadian col

WHERK IS EVERYBODY? Bob Momsen, this year's newly-elected team captain, opens up a wide
lead in the breast-stroke in this scene from last year's meet with UCLA. Momsen and a host of other
national standouts will lead Stanford's defending NCAA champs against Simon Fraser College to
morrow at 2 p.m.
Stanford's NCAA champion
swimmers open their "prove it"
season against the Canadian col
legiate champion, Simon Fraser
College of Vancouver, Saturday,
2 p.m., at Stanford's Encina
Pool.
Simon Fraser is taking an
ambitious 14-team tour of the
West Coast which includes Stan
ford, USC, and UCLA—first,
second, and fifth in the NCAA's
last year.
Last spring Indian swimmers
overturned defending champion
USC and a touted Indiana squad
amidst a flurry of NCAA rec
ords to bring home Stanford's
first NCAA title in 15 years.
Seven NCAA Records
Stanford now owns 7 of 17
collegiate records. The Cards
won both 400 and 800 freestyle
relays in American record time
—with 8 different swimmers in
the act.
All but two members of the
NCAA squad return, but it's a
big two. Gone are team captain
Jim Laney and Greg Bucking
ham.
Buckingham cracked his own
500 free mark by 4 seconds,
beat Don Schollander in the 200
free in American record time,
took second in the 1650, and an
chored the gold medal 800 free
relay in the NCAA's. Bucking
ham also set an NCAA record
in the 1000 freestyle.
Three Golds For Roth
Olympic individual medley
champion Dick Roth returns to
action with NCAA records in
both 200 and 400 IM's and a
share of the Indians' 800 free
relay record. Roth, a junior,
also took sixth in the 200 back
stroke last year, but may con
centrate on breaststroke this
season.
Newly-elected team captain
Bob Momsen surged to a silver
medal performance in the Pan
Am games last summer in
Winnipeg. Momsen has picked
up the silver at the NCAA's the
past two years.
Luis Nicolao, former world
record holder for 100 meters
butterfly, led off the Cards' 400
relay at the NCAA's, took sec
ond in the 100 fly, and sixth in
the 200 fly.
Mike Wall, a senior distance

freestyler and member of the
1964 Olympic team, has a repu
tation for clutch performances
that has baffled place-predictors
for years. Wall took third in the
1650 last year, placed in both
200 and 500 freestyles, and
swam the 800 free relay.
Pete Siebert's surprising per
formances netted him third
place in the 200 IM, fifth in the
400 IM, and a piece of the 800
free relay. Siebert may see a lot
of 200 butterfly races this sea
son.
Senior sprinter Bill Meyer
pegged in the fastest leg, 45.8,
in the 400 free relay at the
NCAA's. Meyer also anchored
Santa Clara Swim Club's gold
medal 400 medley relay at the
Indoor AAU's, teaming up with
Momsen and Nicolao.
Sheerer Returns
Gary Sheerer broke the NCAA
freshman record for 200 free
three years ago, but since then
concentrated on water polo.
Sheerer was voted Outstanding
Player of the Pan Am games
and is three times collegiate All-
American. Sheerer returned to
swimming with vigor in Decem
ber, and the results have been
startling.
Morgan Manning hit 46.1 for
his leg of Stanford's victorious
400 free relay last spring, and
returns with sprint power to
burn. Junior Jeff Hammett and
transfer Ken Hammer give the
Cards strong depth in the
sprints. Hammer was JC state
champion in the 100 free last
year in 47.7 and second in the
50.
Bill Kee, though faced with a
pressing lack of time last year,
carried off the conference 100
backstroke title and later led
off Stanford's fifth place 400
medley relay.
Bright Light Diver
Sophomore diver Bill Main
took sixth in low board and
seventh in high board competi
tion in the National AAU's last
summer.
Doug Miller in the 200 butter
fly and Bob Hart in backstroke
and individual medley could
pick up the points that make the
difference in the NCAA's this
year.
Sophomore butterflier J i m
Nickoloff and breaststroker
Nick Dondero will be vying for

NCAA places, as will sopho
more medleyman Richie Wil
liams.
Cards Picked Third
Swimming World magazine
picked Stanford third behind
USC and Indiana, figuring the
loss of Buckingham to be de
cisive. Swimming World pegged
the Cards second last year.
Stanford Coach Jim Gaugh
ran noted that the Cards will
have to pick up lots of little
points in the consolation finals,
and have some of Stanford's
now infamous "relative un
knowns" come through again.
"We're the underdogs again, and
that suits me fine. We won't
be as far away as they think."
The Tribe faces one of its
toughest tests of the year Jan.
13 when the varsity take on the
most powerful freshman team
in NCAA history. The Stanford
freshman roster reads like the
top ten high shool Ail-American
list.
