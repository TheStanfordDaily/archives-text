# UCLA Invades Tribe Mats
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Stanford's wrestling team
moves back into competition
after the holiday layoff this
weekend with three matches.
One of these, with UCLA Fri
day night at 8 in Encina Gym,
will give Tribe coach Dave Reed
a good indication of the Cards'
power in the AAWU this season.
The other two, a double dual
with San Diego State and Cal
Poly (Pomona) at Berkeley Sat
urday afternoon, should be re
peats of Card wins last year.
The Tribe grapplers achieved
a very respectable third place
In the Northern Cal Invitation
tournament at San Jose State
College last December. Stanford
finished four points behind Cal
Poly (San Luis Obispo) and 14
behind Fresno State which garn
ered its second straight tourney
victory.
Amazing- Third
The amazing fact about the
Tribe performance was that they
lacked men in three weight
classes, including the 191 pound
class, where Terry Crenshaw,
fourth place winner in the
NCAA's last year, was declared
ineligible for the meet.
Crenshaw, however, will bo
eligible for the meets this week
end. His toughest opponent will
be UCLA's Jack Whittington.
The other big gun in the Stan
ford lineup will be Len Borchers
at 160 pounds. Borchers took a
first place at San Jose, over
whelming San Francisco State's

Monty Muller 9-0 in the finals.
Borchers, who also took an
NCAA fourth last March, looked
quick and sharp in his take
downs and escapes.
The main strength of the Stan
ford lineup comes in the heavier
weight classes. John Hazleton, a
senior at 123, and Rocky Carroll,
a junior at 130, are both return
ing to the Tribe mat after year
absences and are just recover
ing their old moves.
Mike Pete, a promising sopho
more at 137, still lacks some
finesse, as does veteran Gerard
Beaudoin, a 145 pound junior.
All four of these men failed to
place at San Jose.
Big 1 Loss at 137
The team suffered a big loss
over the vacation when Cliff
Davidson, a strong sophomore at
137 pounds who took a second
at San Jose, was activated for

a Stanford overseas campus.
Davidson was unable to transfer
to another group and decided to
go overseas.
Bill Vogelpohl, a 152 pound
junior, impressed everyone at
San ose when he took a second
place, losing only 4-2 to San
Jose's best man, Loren Miller,
in the finals. John Suttle has
suffered recurrent injuries all
year long and Is still inactive at
152.
Following Borchers is season
ed Burt Ambler, a tough senior
at 167 pounds who took a fourth
place at San Jose. A battle be
tween Bud Hollingberry, who
took a second at San Jose, and
Bill Ross looms at the 177 pound
slot in the Tribe lineup.
Ben Shaver completes the In
dian wrestlers at the heavy
weight spot. Shaver took a third
place medal at San Jose.

Poly (Pomona) at Berkeley Sat
urday afternoon, should be re
peats of Card wins last year.
The Tribe grapplers achieved
a very respectable third place
In the Northern Cal Invitation
tournament at San Jose State
College last December. Stanford
finished four points behind Cal
Poly (San Luis Obispo) and 14
behind Fresno State which garn
ered its second straight tourney
victory.
Amazing- Third
The amazing fact about the
Tribe performance was that they
lacked men in three weight
classes, including the 191 pound
class, where Terry Crenshaw,
fourth place winner in the
NCAA's last year, was declared
ineligible for the meet.
Crenshaw, however, will bo
eligible for the meets this week
end. His toughest opponent will
be UCLA's Jack Whittington.
The other big gun in the Stan
ford lineup will be Len Borchers
at 160 pounds. Borchers took a
first place at San Jose, over
whelming San Francisco State's

Monty Muller 9-0 in the finals.
Borchers, who also took an
NCAA fourth last March, looked
quick and sharp in his take
downs and escapes.
The main strength of the Stan
ford lineup comes in the heavier
weight classes. John Hazleton, a
senior at 123, and Rocky Carroll,
a junior at 130, are both return
ing to the Tribe mat after year
absences and are just recover
ing their old moves.
Mike Pete, a promising sopho
more at 137, still lacks some
finesse, as does veteran Gerard
Beaudoin, a 145 pound junior.
All four of these men failed to
place at San Jose.
Big 1 Loss at 137
The team suffered a big loss
over the vacation when Cliff
Davidson, a strong sophomore at
137 pounds who took a second
at San Jose, was activated for

a Stanford overseas campus.
Davidson was unable to transfer
to another group and decided to
go overseas.
Bill Vogelpohl, a 152 pound
junior, impressed everyone at
San ose when he took a second
place, losing only 4-2 to San
Jose's best man, Loren Miller,
in the finals. John Suttle has
suffered recurrent injuries all
year long and Is still inactive at
152.
Following Borchers is season
ed Burt Ambler, a tough senior
at 167 pounds who took a fourth
place at San Jose. A battle be
tween Bud Hollingberry, who
took a second at San Jose, and
Bill Ross looms at the 177 pound
slot in the Tribe lineup.
Ben Shaver completes the In
dian wrestlers at the heavy
weight spot. Shaver took a third
place medal at San Jose.
Stanford's wrestling team
moves back into competition
after the holiday layoff this
weekend with three matches.
One of these, with UCLA Fri
day night at 8 in Encina Gym,
will give Tribe coach Dave Reed
a good indication of the Cards'
power in the AAWU this season.
The other two, a double dual
with San Diego State and Cal
Poly (Pomona) at Berkeley Sat
urday afternoon, should be re
peats of Card wins last year.
