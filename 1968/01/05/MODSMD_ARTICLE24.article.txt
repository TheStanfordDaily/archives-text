## Basketball Team Set For Opening Pacific-8 Battle 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Stanford's basketball squad
will travel north this weekend
for its opening round of Pacific
Eight competition. (Contrary to
rumor, UCLA has not already
been awarded the championship
by default.)
The Cards will meet Oregon m
Portland at 8:00 p.m. tonight,
and take on the tough Orogon
State Beavers tomorrow in Cor
vallis, also at 8:00 p.m.
One More Time
The Oregon clash will be a re
match of the second round game
of last week's Far West Classic.
Stanford came from behind to
beat the Duck's in that contest,
68-64 in overtime.
Oregon is not very tall (the
front line is 6-7, 6-7, 6-4) but they
are a muscular bunch and like to
play a tough, aggressive defen
sive game. Center John Pinkstaff
and hot soph Bill Gaskins are
the Ducks to watch.
Press
Coach Dallmar plans to rely
heavily on the full court press,
a tactic which worked beauti
fully in the earlier game be
tween the two clubs. The Tribe
turned on the pressure in the
last four minutes and came
from 12 points behind to tie.

Dave ISoland, Editor

It should be a bruising, close
fought contest.
Big- Beavers
Oregon State, to put it mildly,
will be tough. The Beavers took
No. 5 ranked North Carolina
down to the wire in the Far
West Classic before losing the
championship game.
Up front, OSU will start 7-0
Vic Bartolome and 6-9 Gary
Freeman. Dallmar reports that
Bartolome has good moves and
a soft touch around the basket.
However, both are sophomores,
and have shown tendencies to
get into foul trouble.
At the guard spot, Oregon
State has 6-4 Vince Fritz, a long
bomber who notched 23 against
North Carolina. Fritz was sec
ond string All-Pac 8 last year as
a sophomore and was named to
the All-Tournament, team in the
Far West Classic.
The Beavers play a slow, de
liberate, work-for-the-good-shot
game. The Tribe, of course, will
try to speed up the action a bit,
and this collision of strategies
should produce an unpredictable
contest.

Freeman. Dallmar reports that
Bartolome has good moves and
a soft touch around the basket.
However, both are sophomores,
and have shown tendencies to
get into foul trouble.
At the guard spot, Oregon
State has 6-4 Vince Fritz, a long
bomber who notched 23 against
North Carolina. Fritz was sec
ond string All-Pac 8 last year as
a sophomore and was named to
the All-Tournament, team in the
Far West Classic.
The Beavers play a slow, de
liberate, work-for-the-good-shot
game. The Tribe, of course, will
try to speed up the action a bit,
and this collision of strategies
should produce an unpredictable
contest.
Stanford's basketball squad
will travel north this weekend
for its opening round of Pacific
Eight competition. (Contrary to
rumor, UCLA has not already
been awarded the championship
by default.)
The Cards will meet Oregon m
Portland at 8:00 p.m. tonight,
and take on the tough Orogon
State Beavers tomorrow in Cor
vallis, also at 8:00 p.m.
One More Time
The Oregon clash will be a re
match of the second round game
of last week's Far West Classic.
Stanford came from behind to
beat the Duck's in that contest,
68-64 in overtime.
Oregon is not very tall (the
front line is 6-7, 6-7, 6-4) but they
are a muscular bunch and like to
play a tough, aggressive defen
sive game. Center John Pinkstaff
and hot soph Bill Gaskins are
the Ducks to watch.
Press
Coach Dallmar plans to rely
heavily on the full court press,
a tactic which worked beauti
fully in the earlier game be
tween the two clubs. The Tribe
turned on the pressure in the
last four minutes and came
from 12 points behind to tie.

It should be a bruising, close
fought contest.
Big- Beavers
Oregon State, to put it mildly,
will be tough. The Beavers took
No. 5 ranked North Carolina
down to the wire in the Far
West Classic before losing the
championship game.
Up front, OSU will start 7-0
Vic Bartolome and 6-9 Gary
Freeman. Dallmar reports that
Bartolome has good moves and
a soft touch around the basket.
However, both are sophomores,
and have shown tendencies to
