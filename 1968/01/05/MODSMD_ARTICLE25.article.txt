â€”The television news comes on
at 7:30 p.m. with a blare of
martial music. The television
set overlooks 14 beds in thus
post-operative ward at the U.S.
Army's 24th Evacuation Hospi
tal.
It does not overlook the 10
beds of the "shrouds, the ghosts
that call me at night," as one
male nurse describes them.
These are the most serious
cases.
They lie in their beds, some
with crushed faces and bodies.
They are swathed in heavy,
bloody bandages. Tubes dangle
from plasma bottles. Some are
uncovered to the waist. They
look pale from exhaustion.
There is heavy breathing. Some
times there are moans of pain,
when the moans increase, a
nurse steps quietly to the bed.
In the second bed on the left
side of this section there is a
strapping big man, a sergeant.

He is going to die in 20 minutes.
He is so tall that his feet hang
over the frame of his bed. He is
crew cut and heavily sun tanned.
He wears a mustache.
The sergeant arrived in the
ward on a stretcher three days
ago. He mumbled incoherently.
Sometimes he screamed.
The men in the ward, who
spend much of their time com
paring cases, know he is in very
bad condition.
Doctors Work Hours
The sergeant is heavily band
aged about the stomach and
face. The night he was brought
in, doctors worked over him for
several hours, often three at a
time trying to save his life.
Over the sergeant's bed there
is a sign displaying the big red
"1" of the Ist Infantry Division
and his name, rank, serial num
ber, unit and type of injury. It
says he suffered multiple frag
ment wounds.
In the bed to the left of the
sergeant there is a soldier with
an unrecognizable face. He bab
ies and moans beneath his thick
bandages.
In the bed to the right is a
boyish, red-haired, freckled ar

tilleryman. He was wounded in
the battle at Bu Dop Dec. 3. He
is very pale. Sweat rolls from
his face. The stump of his right
arm lies on his chest, held in
place by a rope fixed to the ceil
ing. Despite the loss, he seems
to be recovering. When the tall
sergeant cries out in pain, the
young artilleryman gives him a
smile.
Now it is 7:30 p.m. The young
artilleryman motions to a male
nurse and asks to be moved in
front of the TV set.
News By TV
The Vietnamese war news is
coming via television. The an
nouncer tells of more than 400
enemy killed in the Mekong Del
ta, new clashes aolng the demil
itarized zone, air raids over
North Vietnam. Some of the pa
tients stare at the ceiling as
they listen. The red-haired boy
with the stump for an arm looks
at the set, but his eyes seem to
be somewhere else.
Then the male nurse with the
cookies drops the box on a bed
and rushes across the room.
The head of the tall sergeant
has fallen back. His mouth and
eyes are open. Peters also rush
es to the bed. They take turns
massaging his broad chest.
Lt. Kathleen Costello, a pretty
21-year-old nurse from Danbury,
Conn., suddenly loses the cheer
ful manner that marks her daily
rounds among the wounded. She
leans over the tall sergeant and
for a moment tries mouth-to
mouth resuscitation. Then she
looks up, puts both hands to her
head and pushes up her hair.
She is near tears as a nervous
giggle escapes from her mouth.
Then she reaches for the tele
phone, dials and gets a busy sig
nal. The eyes of nearly all the
patients are on her. She bangs
down the phone, lights a ciga
rette, tries the phone again, still
busy.
"Please," she says, "some
body run to the emergency
room, hurry."
The two male nurses continue
to massage the giant chest.

Nurse Costello prepares a hy
podermic. Only three minutes
have passed.
Doctor Enters
The doctor, found in his quar
ters, walks into the ward wear
ing civilian clothing. He walks
fast, long brisk paces. All the
eyes follow him as he moves
down the aisle. He fingers his
stethoscope and leans over the
sergeant while the male nurses
continue their efforts to pump
life back into the big body.
Nurse Costello stands at his
side, ready with the shot. She is
very pale, her hair still In disor
der.
Now it Is 8:05 p.m. The doctor
reaches out and with a quick
movement, pulls the sheet over
the sergeant's face.
A screen Is placed around the
bed of the dead sergeant, se
cluding it from the rest of the
ward. The red-haired soldier
with the stump of an arm press
es his face into his pillow.
The doctor strides out, the
same quick pace. He looks bit
ter.
Two medics come Into the
ward through the rear door.
They wrap the body in blankets
and lift it to a roller stretcher.
The rubber tires of the wheels
make no noise as the stretcher
is pushed from the ward.
