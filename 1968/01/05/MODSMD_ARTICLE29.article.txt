# AMA Cites Danger Of Contraceptives
## 
### 
The American Medical Asso
ciation (AMA) recommended
Sunday that oral contraceptives
be taken only "when the pills
are deemed a necessity and pos
sible risk is accepted by the pa
tient."
An editorial in the Journal of
the AMA reported that many

women are taking the pill with
out adequate supervision from a
physician.
The report said that a woman
taking the pill should be in the
care of a doctor, watching close
ly for dangerous side-effects,
pointing out the increase of
strokes among women taking
the pill as an example.
The AMA's Council on Drugs
has not been able to discern
whether or not oral contracep
tives are safe. In a report last
March the council stated, "no
serious adverse effects attributed
solely to the prolonged use of
these preparations have thus far
been reported."
Currently, there is too little in
formation to make a decision on
whether the pill is safe or harm
ful. However, physicians are
finding it difficult to prescribe
the pill, because they are given
to healthy rather than ill per
sons.
