# Computer No Matchmaker

### 
Computer dating is no more
scientific than any other boy
meets-girl technique, according
to results of a computer-match
dating experiment carried out
by two Stanford psychology stu
dents.
"Apparently the blindness
stays in blind dating even when
you use a computer," said Ron
ald Starr of Portland, Ore., one
of two doctoral students who
conducted the experiment.
In the fall of 1966 the two ex
perimenters matched 350 men
and 210 women, all members of
the Stanford community, on the
basis of personalities, mutual
interests, and opinions. Those
matched paid $1 (women) and
$1.75 (men) for the privilege,
and were guaranteed four to 10
names of prospective dates.
One of these, however, was a
"mystery date." The mystery
date was matched only on the
basis of age, race, religion, and
height. Interests, personality,
and other factors were ignored.
"In a follow-up study of re
sults," said Starr, "we found
the mystery dates were just as
successful as the more carefully
matched ones.
