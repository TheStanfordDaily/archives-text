# Residents Evicted from Tamarack
## Old Japanese Clubhouse Will Finally Die 
### Michael Sweeney 
Tucked inconspicuously beneath a cuca
lvptus tree on Santa Ynez street is a
quietly decaying white house.
Stanford students have lived there since
1917. Mortally wounded in 1942, the house
has died a lingering death and will suf
fer the coup de grace next month from a
wrecker's ball.
In its elegant youth the house was called
the Japanese Clubhouse. Now the name
"Tamarack Lodge" is above the front door.
Tamarack Is haunted by uneasy mem
ories.
The condemned house is the last visible
reminder of the incredible fate of its
builders and owners, the Japanese students
of Stanford. In 1942, the U.S. Army sent
40 students and one professor of Japanese
ancestry to concentration camps, where
most lived behind barbed wire until 1945.
Japanese students never returned to
their clubhouse. Renamed Tamarack, it
was run as a student cooperative. Years
of neglect finally caught up with the old
house. In a general crackdown last year
on campus residences, Santa Clara County
health and fire officials cited Tamarack
for 23 violations.

The University has asked Tamarack's
13 residents to move out by January 30.
"We can't continue to allow students to
live there," explained Dan Williams, as
sistant dean of students.
The eviction comes as no surprise to
Tamarack's occupants. "We were aware
since last summer that Tamarack was up
for inspection," said Carl Treseder, a sen
ior in history and the cooperative's man
ager. "This building is not worth saving."
Treseder is sorry to leave. He paid only
$120 rent a quarter for his single room.
"Here I can have my room the way I want
it,"he commented wistfully, gazing at the
walls painted blue, orange, yellow, and
white.
Despite a high turnover of residents,
Tamarack was renowned as a congenial
mixture of graduates and undergraduates.
Americans and foreign students. "It was
a very nice number of people to have to
gether," Treseder said. "If you didn't
mind a dumpy place, it was a nice place
to live."
And Tamarack is a dump, like any haun
ted house. It shows its 50 years of age: the
pilings that serve as a foundation are set
tling, the floors sag. the walls are cracked,
the plaster peels, and naked light bulbs
