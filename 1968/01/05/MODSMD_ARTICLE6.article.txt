# Residents Evicted from Tamarack
## Old Japanese Clubhouse Will Finally Die 
### Michael Sweeney 
Tucked inconspicuously beneath a cuca
lvptus tree on Santa Ynez street is a
quietly decaying white house.
Stanford students have lived there since
1917. Mortally wounded in 1942, the house
has died a lingering death and will suf
fer the coup de grace next month from a
wrecker's ball.
In its elegant youth the house was called
the Japanese Clubhouse. Now the name
"Tamarack Lodge" is above the front door.
Tamarack Is haunted by uneasy mem
ories.
The condemned house is the last visible
reminder of the incredible fate of its
builders and owners, the Japanese students
of Stanford. In 1942, the U.S. Army sent
40 students and one professor of Japanese
ancestry to concentration camps, where
most lived behind barbed wire until 1945.
Japanese students never returned to
their clubhouse. Renamed Tamarack, it
was run as a student cooperative. Years
of neglect finally caught up with the old
house. In a general crackdown last year
on campus residences, Santa Clara County
health and fire officials cited Tamarack
for 23 violations.

The University has asked Tamarack's
13 residents to move out by January 30.
"We can't continue to allow students to
live there," explained Dan Williams, as
sistant dean of students.
The eviction comes as no surprise to
Tamarack's occupants. "We were aware
since last summer that Tamarack was up
for inspection," said Carl Treseder, a sen
ior in history and the cooperative's man
ager. "This building is not worth saving."
Treseder is sorry to leave. He paid only
$120 rent a quarter for his single room.
"Here I can have my room the way I want
it,"he commented wistfully, gazing at the
walls painted blue, orange, yellow, and
white.
Despite a high turnover of residents,
Tamarack was renowned as a congenial
mixture of graduates and undergraduates.
Americans and foreign students. "It was
a very nice number of people to have to
gether," Treseder said. "If you didn't
mind a dumpy place, it was a nice place
to live."
And Tamarack is a dump, like any haun
ted house. It shows its 50 years of age: the
pilings that serve as a foundation are set
tling, the floors sag. the walls are cracked,
the plaster peels, and naked light bulbs

hang from the ceiling.
The gas stove burns In the
kitchen to provide heat. Tam
arack's furnace exploded last
March.
The living room is a study
in faded gentility — discolored
wood paneling; soiled rug; an
ancient piano that doesn't play.
Tamarack's longevity is re
markable; the house seemingly
lost any reason for existence
when its Japanese owners and
members disappeared in 1942.
Decay was rapid—a 1946 report
called it "unsuitable" for stu
dent housing because of its
"run-down condition." A 1957
report said Tamarack needed
"major structural and mechan
ical work."
"Inside this thing is a tin
derbox," Treseder observed.
"There's only one electrical
outlet in each room. The place
wasn't even properly wired In
1917.
But at least the roof doesn't
leak any longer. In 1966 a
wizened old man who takes
care of bones for the anatomy
department paid for roof re
pairs. He is Yoshio Okumoto,
Tamarack's landlord.
As the sole remaining mem
ber since 1945 of the Japanese
Students' association, Okumoto
has collected part of the occu
pant's rent and paid property
taxes and $100 a year to Stan
ford for the ground lease. And
when he could save a little out
of the rent payments, Okumoto
made repairs.
Why has Okumoto bothered
to be landlord of a haunted
house for 22 years? Why has
he acted as the agent of an
association which was scattered
to the winds 26 years ago?
"I have no power to dissolve
the Japanese Students' Associa
tion," the 64-year-old anatomist
explained. "After the war I
was the only alumni member
left and I was just stuck with
it."
Okumoto recounted the half
forgotten story of the Japanese
Students' association, which
flourished at Stanford for 28
years.
The Japanese organized in

the first years of this century.
Most of the members were ac
tually Nisei, second generation
American citizens. In 1914 the
association was chartered by
California.
Evidently the Japanese want
ed their own house on campus,
because the fraternities were
largely closed to students with
oriental appearance. In 1916
they leased the lot on Santa
Ynez street from Stanford, and
built their white stucco club
house in the shade of a giant
eucalyptus tree.
Okumoto, born in Hawaii,
came to Stanford as an under
graduate in 1925.
Okumoto recalls that the so
cial activities of the Nisei stu
dents centered on their club
house, but they were hardly
isolated from the campus. The
Nisei held open house parties
and occasionally non-Japanese
students lived in the clubhouse.
Each spring- the entire as
sociation posed for a por
trait with University presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Today the portraits sit in a
dusty stack in the basement
of condemned Tamarack
Lodge.
"Before the war, we were
considered the cleanest house
on campus," Okumoto recollec
ted.
Okumoto graduated in 1928
and went to work in the ana
tomy department. He stayed
with the Japanese Students' As
sociation, not knowing that one
day he would be its last mem
ber.
As tensions between the U.S.
and Japan grew in 1941, Japan
ese aliens at Stanford returned
home. But life at The Farm
was unchanged for the Nisei in
the clubhouse on Santa Ynez.
TThen Pearl Harbor.
Peter Ida, now a Gunn high
teacher, recalled how the Nisei
clustered around the radio that
black Sunday. "We didn't know
what would become of us. We
were scared stiff." They de
cided to walk in pairs on cam
pus for protection.
Three days later, President

Wilbur asked the campus for
tolerance toward the Japanese
students in an emergency
speech on the war. "They are
just as good Stanford people
as we are," Wilbur said.
Fears of retaliation against
Nisei were unfounded. Instead,
"the feeling on campus was one
of friendship," Ida said. He re
members several football play
ers promising to "take care of"
anyone who gave the Nisei
trouble.
But the war hysteria sealed
the fate of Japanese-Ameri
cans at Stanford and through
out the West. President Roo
sevelt fearing fifth-column
subversion, ordered all aliens
and citizens of Japanese an
cestry "evacuated" to special
camps.
Japanese families near the
Presidio in San Francisco had
24 hours notice before "reloca
tion," Okumoto recalled.
A sudden curfew in March
forbid Japanese to travel. Most
of Stanford's Japanese students
were home on vacation. Unable
to return to Stanford's sanctu
ary, they were soon evacuated
with their families.
But a handful rushed back to
Stanford to beat the curfew.
This remnant included Okumo
to, Ida, History Prof. Yamato
Ichihashi, and several seniors
anxious to earn their diplomas
before imprisonment.
President Wilbur interceded
with the Army to delay the
evacuation of the Santa Clara
County district, which included
Stanford.
Months of bloody defeats
soured the mood of the Ameri
can people, and some of the un
controlled hatred seeped into
Stanford. On April 10, 1942, all
angry editorial in The Daily
said: "We have just lost 36,000
fathers and brothers and sweet
hearts to the invading Jap dogs
at Bataan."
The previous day, a fiery
Daily staff member advocated
shooting "all possible fifth-col
umnists," because "efficiency not
humaneness, wins the war."
Three days later Paul Yama
moto wrote in reply, "Since I
am one of those possible fifth
columnists ... I would like to

comment before the government
decides to shoot us." Yamamoto
pointed out that loyal citizens
were being lawlessly "evicted
from our homes."
Evacuation orders for the re
maining Nisei were expected any
day. Not knowing where he was
going, or for how long, Okumoto
sold the posessions he could not
carry and bought a sleeping bag.
The 1942 Quad ran pictures of
the last members of the Japan
ese Students' Association, with
the the inscription, "The boys
with perpetual 8 o'clock lock-ins
won't be with us much longer."
Under the March curfew law. all
Nisei had to be indoors at 8 p.m.
On May 26 Stanford's last Ni
sei boarded a guarded, darkened
train and sped off to concentra
tion camps. No Japanese would
return to the white stucco lodge
on Santa Ynez street.
"We were treated roughly,"
said Okumoto dispassionately.
"But this was war. We had to
take it"
Okumoto and others wound
up at the Heart Mountain camp
in the empty plains of Wyoming.
Ten thousand Japanese lived in
barracks there, surrounded by a
six-foot barbed wire fence with
armed guards in towers. Oku
moto tried to get a job at the
camp hospital, but the equip
ment for his specialty was un
available, so he "didn't have a
thing to do." Others at his camp
worked in the fields for meager
pay.
Ida was lucky. He was per
mitted to enroll at the Univer
sity of Nebraska after a few
months in camp.
Paul Yamamoto, along with
thousands of other interned Ni
sei, was drafted by the Army
during a 1943 manpower crisis.
He served as an interpreter in
the Philippines from 1944 to
1946.
Okumoto got out of Heart
Mountain when a Stanford ana
tomy professor secured permis
sion in 1945 for him to return
to his old job. Okumoto was one
of the first Nisei permitted back
in California.
During Okumoto's absence,

the University rented the Japan
ese clubhouse to the Walter
Thompson Cooperative Club, a
group of American students. Ap
parently they treated the lodge
poorly, because in 1946 Dean
of Students John Stalnaker gave
the house back to Okumoto be
cause it was too "run-down."
A group of American and for
eign students moved into the
lodge, paying rent to Okumoto
as the Japanese Students' Asso
ciation's only member.
As Nisei students gradually
drifted back to Stanford, Oku
moto tried to get the associa
tion started again. He failed.
"Before we were evacuated,"
he recalled bitterly, "President
Wilbur promised we could con

tinue as before if we ever came
back. But after the war the Uni
versity was not interested in let
ting us survive. They felt Japan
ese students just wanted to seg
regate themselves from the cam
pus."
And the Nisei showed no in
terest in reviving the club.
Okumoto, discouraged, stopped
caring about the lodge, which
its residents had renamed Tam
arack after the Sierra pine tree.
For two decades Tamarack
Lodge lived a life after death,
forgotten by the University,
scorned by Okumoto, and
housing students who enjoyed
living there but cared nothing
for Tamarack's past or future.

Each year Okumoto collected
the room rents, paid property
taxes and the ground lease, and
made a few repairs. Meanwhile
he redeposited the interest of
the swelling bank account of the
defunct Japanese Students' Asso
ciation. (The account now has
over $5,000, which Okumoto
may give to the University.)
Each year Tamarack's floor
sagged, the pilings settled, and
the roof let in more rainwater.
Now the last residents of
Tamarack have their eviction
orders. The old lodge won't be
haunted by its grotesque mem
ories much longer—if Stanford
doesn't raze Tamarack by March
4, $642 in property taxes will
fall due.

oriental appearance. In 1916
they leased the lot on Santa
Ynez street from Stanford, and
built their white stucco club
house in the shade of a giant
eucalyptus tree.
Okumoto, born in Hawaii,
came to Stanford as an under
graduate in 1925.
Okumoto recalls that the so
cial activities of the Nisei stu
dents centered on their club
house, but they were hardly
isolated from the campus. The
Nisei held open house parties
and occasionally non-Japanese
students lived in the clubhouse.
Each spring- the entire as
sociation posed for a por
trait with University presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Today the portraits sit in a
dusty stack in the basement
of condemned Tamarack
Lodge.
"Before the war, we were
considered the cleanest house
on campus," Okumoto recollec
ted.
Okumoto graduated in 1928
and went to work in the ana
tomy department. He stayed
with the Japanese Students' As
sociation, not knowing that one
day he would be its last mem
ber.
As tensions between the U.S.
and Japan grew in 1941, Japan
ese aliens at Stanford returned
home. But life at The Farm
was unchanged for the Nisei in
the clubhouse on Santa Ynez.
TThen Pearl Harbor.
Peter Ida, now a Gunn high
teacher, recalled how the Nisei
clustered around the radio that
black Sunday. "We didn't know
what would become of us. We
were scared stiff." They de
cided to walk in pairs on cam
pus for protection.
Three days later, President

Wilbur asked the campus for
tolerance toward the Japanese
students in an emergency
speech on the war. "They are
just as good Stanford people
as we are," Wilbur said.
Fears of retaliation against
Nisei were unfounded. Instead,
"the feeling on campus was one
of friendship," Ida said. He re
members several football play
ers promising to "take care of"
anyone who gave the Nisei
trouble.
But the war hysteria sealed
the fate of Japanese-Ameri
cans at Stanford and through
out the West. President Roo
sevelt fearing fifth-column
subversion, ordered all aliens
and citizens of Japanese an
cestry "evacuated" to special
camps.
Japanese families near the
Presidio in San Francisco had
24 hours notice before "reloca
tion," Okumoto recalled.
A sudden curfew in March
forbid Japanese to travel. Most
of Stanford's Japanese students
were home on vacation. Unable
to return to Stanford's sanctu
ary, they were soon evacuated
with their families.
But a handful rushed back to
Stanford to beat the curfew.
This remnant included Okumo
to, Ida, History Prof. Yamato
Ichihashi, and several seniors
anxious to earn their diplomas
before imprisonment.
President Wilbur interceded
with the Army to delay the
evacuation of the Santa Clara
County district, which included
Stanford.
Months of bloody defeats
soured the mood of the Ameri
can people, and some of the un
controlled hatred seeped into
Stanford. On April 10, 1942, all
angry editorial in The Daily
said: "We have just lost 36,000
fathers and brothers and sweet
hearts to the invading Jap dogs
at Bataan."
The previous day, a fiery
Daily staff member advocated
shooting "all possible fifth-col
umnists," because "efficiency not
humaneness, wins the war."
Three days later Paul Yama
moto wrote in reply, "Since I
am one of those possible fifth
columnists ... I would like to

comment before the government
decides to shoot us." Yamamoto
pointed out that loyal citizens
were being lawlessly "evicted
from our homes."
Evacuation orders for the re
maining Nisei were expected any
day. Not knowing where he was
going, or for how long, Okumoto
sold the posessions he could not
carry and bought a sleeping bag.
The 1942 Quad ran pictures of
the last members of the Japan
ese Students' Association, with
the the inscription, "The boys
with perpetual 8 o'clock lock-ins
won't be with us much longer."
Under the March curfew law. all
Nisei had to be indoors at 8 p.m.
On May 26 Stanford's last Ni
sei boarded a guarded, darkened
train and sped off to concentra
tion camps. No Japanese would
return to the white stucco lodge
on Santa Ynez street.
"We were treated roughly,"
said Okumoto dispassionately.
"But this was war. We had to
take it"
Okumoto and others wound
up at the Heart Mountain camp
in the empty plains of Wyoming.
Ten thousand Japanese lived in
barracks there, surrounded by a
six-foot barbed wire fence with
armed guards in towers. Oku
moto tried to get a job at the
camp hospital, but the equip
ment for his specialty was un
available, so he "didn't have a
thing to do." Others at his camp
worked in the fields for meager
pay.
Ida was lucky. He was per
mitted to enroll at the Univer
sity of Nebraska after a few
months in camp.
Paul Yamamoto, along with
thousands of other interned Ni
sei, was drafted by the Army
during a 1943 manpower crisis.
He served as an interpreter in
the Philippines from 1944 to
1946.
Okumoto got out of Heart
Mountain when a Stanford ana
tomy professor secured permis
sion in 1945 for him to return
to his old job. Okumoto was one
of the first Nisei permitted back
in California.
During Okumoto's absence,

the University rented the Japan
ese clubhouse to the Walter
Thompson Cooperative Club, a
group of American students. Ap
parently they treated the lodge
poorly, because in 1946 Dean
of Students John Stalnaker gave
the house back to Okumoto be
cause it was too "run-down."
A group of American and for
eign students moved into the
lodge, paying rent to Okumoto
as the Japanese Students' Asso
ciation's only member.
As Nisei students gradually
drifted back to Stanford, Oku
moto tried to get the associa
tion started again. He failed.
"Before we were evacuated,"
he recalled bitterly, "President
Wilbur promised we could con

tinue as before if we ever came
back. But after the war the Uni
versity was not interested in let
ting us survive. They felt Japan
ese students just wanted to seg
regate themselves from the cam
pus."
And the Nisei showed no in
terest in reviving the club.
Okumoto, discouraged, stopped
caring about the lodge, which
its residents had renamed Tam
arack after the Sierra pine tree.
For two decades Tamarack
Lodge lived a life after death,
forgotten by the University,
scorned by Okumoto, and
housing students who enjoyed
living there but cared nothing
for Tamarack's past or future.

Each year Okumoto collected
the room rents, paid property
taxes and the ground lease, and
made a few repairs. Meanwhile
he redeposited the interest of
the swelling bank account of the
defunct Japanese Students' Asso
ciation. (The account now has
over $5,000, which Okumoto
may give to the University.)
Each year Tamarack's floor
sagged, the pilings settled, and
the roof let in more rainwater.
Now the last residents of
Tamarack have their eviction
orders. The old lodge won't be
haunted by its grotesque mem
ories much longer—if Stanford
doesn't raze Tamarack by March
4, $642 in property taxes will
fall due.


ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER — The Japanese Students' Assoeiation posed for this picture in
May, 1940 with Stanford President Ray Lyman Wilbur (center). Two years later the last group of the
Japanese were "exacuated" to concentration camps.
Tucked inconspicuously beneath a cuca
lvptus tree on Santa Ynez street is a
quietly decaying white house.
Stanford students have lived there since
1917. Mortally wounded in 1942, the house
has died a lingering death and will suf
fer the coup de grace next month from a
wrecker's ball.
In its elegant youth the house was called
the Japanese Clubhouse. Now the name
"Tamarack Lodge" is above the front door.
Tamarack Is haunted by uneasy mem
ories.
The condemned house is the last visible
reminder of the incredible fate of its
builders and owners, the Japanese students
of Stanford. In 1942, the U.S. Army sent
40 students and one professor of Japanese
ancestry to concentration camps, where
most lived behind barbed wire until 1945.
Japanese students never returned to
their clubhouse. Renamed Tamarack, it
was run as a student cooperative. Years
of neglect finally caught up with the old
house. In a general crackdown last year
on campus residences, Santa Clara County
health and fire officials cited Tamarack
for 23 violations.

The University has asked Tamarack's
13 residents to move out by January 30.
"We can't continue to allow students to
live there," explained Dan Williams, as
sistant dean of students.
The eviction comes as no surprise to
Tamarack's occupants. "We were aware
since last summer that Tamarack was up
for inspection," said Carl Treseder, a sen
ior in history and the cooperative's man
ager. "This building is not worth saving."
Treseder is sorry to leave. He paid only
$120 rent a quarter for his single room.
"Here I can have my room the way I want
it,"he commented wistfully, gazing at the
walls painted blue, orange, yellow, and
white.
Despite a high turnover of residents,
Tamarack was renowned as a congenial
mixture of graduates and undergraduates.
Americans and foreign students. "It was
a very nice number of people to have to
gether," Treseder said. "If you didn't
mind a dumpy place, it was a nice place
to live."
And Tamarack is a dump, like any haun
ted house. It shows its 50 years of age: the
pilings that serve as a foundation are set
tling, the floors sag. the walls are cracked,
the plaster peels, and naked light bulbs

The gas stove burns In the
kitchen to provide heat. Tam
arack's furnace exploded last
March.
The living room is a study
in faded gentility — discolored
wood paneling; soiled rug; an
ancient piano that doesn't play.
Tamarack's longevity is re
markable; the house seemingly
lost any reason for existence
when its Japanese owners and
members disappeared in 1942.
Decay was rapid—a 1946 report
called it "unsuitable" for stu
dent housing because of its
"run-down condition." A 1957
report said Tamarack needed
"major structural and mechan
ical work."
"Inside this thing is a tin
derbox," Treseder observed.
"There's only one electrical
outlet in each room. The place
wasn't even properly wired In
1917.
But at least the roof doesn't
leak any longer. In 1966 a
wizened old man who takes
care of bones for the anatomy
department paid for roof re
pairs. He is Yoshio Okumoto,
Tamarack's landlord.
As the sole remaining mem
ber since 1945 of the Japanese
Students' association, Okumoto
has collected part of the occu
pant's rent and paid property
taxes and $100 a year to Stan
ford for the ground lease. And
when he could save a little out
of the rent payments, Okumoto
made repairs.
Why has Okumoto bothered
to be landlord of a haunted
house for 22 years? Why has
he acted as the agent of an
association which was scattered
to the winds 26 years ago?
"I have no power to dissolve
the Japanese Students' Associa
tion," the 64-year-old anatomist
explained. "After the war I
was the only alumni member
left and I was just stuck with
it."
Okumoto recounted the half
forgotten story of the Japanese
Students' association, which
flourished at Stanford for 28
years.
The Japanese organized in

the first years of this century.
Most of the members were ac
tually Nisei, second generation
American citizens. In 1914 the
association was chartered by
California.
Evidently the Japanese want
ed their own house on campus,
because the fraternities were
largely closed to students with
oriental appearance. In 1916
they leased the lot on Santa
Ynez street from Stanford, and
built their white stucco club
house in the shade of a giant
eucalyptus tree.

months in camp.
Paul Yamamoto, along with
thousands of other interned Ni
sei, was drafted by the Army
during a 1943 manpower crisis.
He served as an interpreter in
the Philippines from 1944 to
1946.
Okumoto got out of Heart
Mountain when a Stanford ana
tomy professor secured permis
sion in 1945 for him to return
to his old job. Okumoto was one
of the first Nisei permitted back
in California.
During Okumoto's absence,

the University rented the Japan
ese clubhouse to the Walter
Thompson Cooperative Club, a
group of American students. Ap
parently they treated the lodge
poorly, because in 1946 Dean
of Students John Stalnaker gave
the house back to Okumoto be
cause it was too "run-down."
A group of American and for
eign students moved into the
lodge, paying rent to Okumoto
as the Japanese Students' Asso
ciation's only member.
As Nisei students gradually
drifted back to Stanford, Oku
moto tried to get the associa
tion started again. He failed.
"Before we were evacuated,"
he recalled bitterly, "President
Wilbur promised we could con

tinue as before if we ever came
back. But after the war the Uni
versity was not interested in let
ting us survive. They felt Japan
ese students just wanted to seg
regate themselves from the cam
pus."
And the Nisei showed no in
terest in reviving the club.
Okumoto, discouraged, stopped
caring about the lodge, which
its residents had renamed Tam
arack after the Sierra pine tree.
For two decades Tamarack
Lodge lived a life after death,
forgotten by the University,
scorned by Okumoto, and
housing students who enjoyed
living there but cared nothing
for Tamarack's past or future.

Each year Okumoto collected
the room rents, paid property
taxes and the ground lease, and
made a few repairs. Meanwhile
he redeposited the interest of
the swelling bank account of the
defunct Japanese Students' Asso
ciation. (The account now has
over $5,000, which Okumoto
may give to the University.)
Each year Tamarack's floor
sagged, the pilings settled, and
the roof let in more rainwater.
Now the last residents of
Tamarack have their eviction
orders. The old lodge won't be
haunted by its grotesque mem
ories much longer—if Stanford
doesn't raze Tamarack by March
4, $642 in property taxes will
fall due.


ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER — The Japanese Students' Assoeiation posed for this picture in
May, 1940 with Stanford President Ray Lyman Wilbur (center). Two years later the last group of the
Japanese were "exacuated" to concentration camps.
Tucked inconspicuously beneath a cuca
lvptus tree on Santa Ynez street is a
quietly decaying white house.
Stanford students have lived there since
1917. Mortally wounded in 1942, the house
has died a lingering death and will suf
fer the coup de grace next month from a
wrecker's ball.
In its elegant youth the house was called
the Japanese Clubhouse. Now the name
"Tamarack Lodge" is above the front door.
Tamarack Is haunted by uneasy mem
ories.
The condemned house is the last visible
reminder of the incredible fate of its
builders and owners, the Japanese students
of Stanford. In 1942, the U.S. Army sent
40 students and one professor of Japanese
ancestry to concentration camps, where
most lived behind barbed wire until 1945.
Japanese students never returned to
their clubhouse. Renamed Tamarack, it
was run as a student cooperative. Years
of neglect finally caught up with the old
house. In a general crackdown last year
on campus residences, Santa Clara County
health and fire officials cited Tamarack
for 23 violations.

The University has asked Tamarack's
13 residents to move out by January 30.
"We can't continue to allow students to
live there," explained Dan Williams, as
sistant dean of students.
The eviction comes as no surprise to
Tamarack's occupants. "We were aware
since last summer that Tamarack was up
for inspection," said Carl Treseder, a sen
ior in history and the cooperative's man
ager. "This building is not worth saving."
Treseder is sorry to leave. He paid only
$120 rent a quarter for his single room.
"Here I can have my room the way I want
it,"he commented wistfully, gazing at the
walls painted blue, orange, yellow, and
white.
Despite a high turnover of residents,
Tamarack was renowned as a congenial
mixture of graduates and undergraduates.
Americans and foreign students. "It was
a very nice number of people to have to
gether," Treseder said. "If you didn't
mind a dumpy place, it was a nice place
to live."
And Tamarack is a dump, like any haun
ted house. It shows its 50 years of age: the
pilings that serve as a foundation are set
tling, the floors sag. the walls are cracked,
the plaster peels, and naked light bulbs

hang from the ceiling.
The gas stove burns In the
kitchen to provide heat. Tam
arack's furnace exploded last
March.
The living room is a study
in faded gentility — discolored
wood paneling; soiled rug; an
ancient piano that doesn't play.
Tamarack's longevity is re
markable; the house seemingly
lost any reason for existence
when its Japanese owners and
members disappeared in 1942.
Decay was rapid—a 1946 report
called it "unsuitable" for stu
dent housing because of its
"run-down condition." A 1957
report said Tamarack needed
"major structural and mechan
ical work."
"Inside this thing is a tin
derbox," Treseder observed.
"There's only one electrical
outlet in each room. The place
wasn't even properly wired In
1917.
But at least the roof doesn't
leak any longer. In 1966 a
wizened old man who takes
care of bones for the anatomy
department paid for roof re
pairs. He is Yoshio Okumoto,
Tamarack's landlord.
As the sole remaining mem
ber since 1945 of the Japanese
Students' association, Okumoto
has collected part of the occu
pant's rent and paid property
taxes and $100 a year to Stan
ford for the ground lease. And
when he could save a little out
of the rent payments, Okumoto
made repairs.
Why has Okumoto bothered
to be landlord of a haunted
house for 22 years? Why has
he acted as the agent of an
association which was scattered
to the winds 26 years ago?
"I have no power to dissolve
the Japanese Students' Associa
tion," the 64-year-old anatomist
explained. "After the war I
was the only alumni member
left and I was just stuck with
it."
Okumoto recounted the half
forgotten story of the Japanese
Students' association, which
flourished at Stanford for 28
years.
The Japanese organized in

the first years of this century.
Most of the members were ac
tually Nisei, second generation
American citizens. In 1914 the
association was chartered by
California.
Evidently the Japanese want
ed their own house on campus,
because the fraternities were
largely closed to students with
oriental appearance. In 1916
they leased the lot on Santa
Ynez street from Stanford, and
built their white stucco club
house in the shade of a giant
eucalyptus tree.
Okumoto, born in Hawaii,
came to Stanford as an under
graduate in 1925.
Okumoto recalls that the so
cial activities of the Nisei stu
dents centered on their club
house, but they were hardly
isolated from the campus. The
Nisei held open house parties
and occasionally non-Japanese
students lived in the clubhouse.
Each spring- the entire as
sociation posed for a por
trait with University presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Today the portraits sit in a
dusty stack in the basement
of condemned Tamarack
Lodge.
"Before the war, we were
considered the cleanest house
on campus," Okumoto recollec
ted.
Okumoto graduated in 1928
and went to work in the ana
tomy department. He stayed
with the Japanese Students' As
sociation, not knowing that one
day he would be its last mem
ber.
As tensions between the U.S.
and Japan grew in 1941, Japan
ese aliens at Stanford returned
home. But life at The Farm
was unchanged for the Nisei in
the clubhouse on Santa Ynez.
TThen Pearl Harbor.
Peter Ida, now a Gunn high
teacher, recalled how the Nisei
clustered around the radio that
black Sunday. "We didn't know
what would become of us. We
were scared stiff." They de
cided to walk in pairs on cam
pus for protection.
Three days later, President

Wilbur asked the campus for
tolerance toward the Japanese
students in an emergency
speech on the war. "They are
just as good Stanford people
as we are," Wilbur said.
Fears of retaliation against
Nisei were unfounded. Instead,
"the feeling on campus was one
of friendship," Ida said. He re
members several football play
ers promising to "take care of"
anyone who gave the Nisei
trouble.
But the war hysteria sealed
the fate of Japanese-Ameri
cans at Stanford and through
out the West. President Roo
sevelt fearing fifth-column
subversion, ordered all aliens
and citizens of Japanese an
cestry "evacuated" to special
camps.
Japanese families near the
Presidio in San Francisco had
24 hours notice before "reloca
tion," Okumoto recalled.
A sudden curfew in March
forbid Japanese to travel. Most
of Stanford's Japanese students
were home on vacation. Unable
to return to Stanford's sanctu
ary, they were soon evacuated
with their families.
But a handful rushed back to
Stanford to beat the curfew.
This remnant included Okumo
to, Ida, History Prof. Yamato
Ichihashi, and several seniors
anxious to earn their diplomas
before imprisonment.
President Wilbur interceded
with the Army to delay the
evacuation of the Santa Clara
County district, which included
Stanford.
Months of bloody defeats
soured the mood of the Ameri
can people, and some of the un
controlled hatred seeped into
Stanford. On April 10, 1942, all
angry editorial in The Daily
said: "We have just lost 36,000
fathers and brothers and sweet
hearts to the invading Jap dogs
at Bataan."
The previous day, a fiery
Daily staff member advocated
shooting "all possible fifth-col
umnists," because "efficiency not
humaneness, wins the war."
Three days later Paul Yama
moto wrote in reply, "Since I
am one of those possible fifth
columnists ... I would like to

comment before the government
decides to shoot us." Yamamoto
pointed out that loyal citizens
were being lawlessly "evicted
from our homes."
Evacuation orders for the re
maining Nisei were expected any
day. Not knowing where he was
going, or for how long, Okumoto
sold the posessions he could not
carry and bought a sleeping bag.
The 1942 Quad ran pictures of
the last members of the Japan
ese Students' Association, with
the the inscription, "The boys
with perpetual 8 o'clock lock-ins
won't be with us much longer."
Under the March curfew law. all
Nisei had to be indoors at 8 p.m.
On May 26 Stanford's last Ni
sei boarded a guarded, darkened
train and sped off to concentra
tion camps. No Japanese would
return to the white stucco lodge
on Santa Ynez street.
"We were treated roughly,"
said Okumoto dispassionately.
"But this was war. We had to
take it"
Okumoto and others wound
up at the Heart Mountain camp
in the empty plains of Wyoming.
Ten thousand Japanese lived in
barracks there, surrounded by a
six-foot barbed wire fence with
armed guards in towers. Oku
moto tried to get a job at the
camp hospital, but the equip
ment for his specialty was un
available, so he "didn't have a
thing to do." Others at his camp
worked in the fields for meager
pay.
Ida was lucky. He was per
mitted to enroll at the Univer
sity of Nebraska after a few
months in camp.
Paul Yamamoto, along with
thousands of other interned Ni
sei, was drafted by the Army
during a 1943 manpower crisis.
He served as an interpreter in
the Philippines from 1944 to
1946.
Okumoto got out of Heart

tomy professor secured permis
sion in 1945 for him to return
to his old job. Okumoto was one
of the first Nisei permitted back

The gas stove burns In the
kitchen to provide heat. Tam
arack's furnace exploded last
March.
The living room is a study
in faded gentility — discolored
wood paneling; soiled rug; an
ancient piano that doesn't play.
Tamarack's longevity is re
markable; the house seemingly
lost any reason for existence
when its Japanese owners and
members disappeared in 1942.
Decay was rapid—a 1946 report
called it "unsuitable" for stu
dent housing because of its
"run-down condition." A 1957
report said Tamarack needed
"major structural and mechan
ical work."
"Inside this thing is a tin
derbox," Treseder observed.
"There's only one electrical
outlet in each room. The place
wasn't even properly wired In
1917.
But at least the roof doesn't
leak any longer. In 1966 a
wizened old man who takes
care of bones for the anatomy
department paid for roof re
pairs. He is Yoshio Okumoto,
Tamarack's landlord.
As the sole remaining mem
ber since 1945 of the Japanese
Students' association, Okumoto
has collected part of the occu
pant's rent and paid property
taxes and $100 a year to Stan
ford for the ground lease. And
when he could save a little out
of the rent payments, Okumoto
made repairs.
Why has Okumoto bothered
to be landlord of a haunted
house for 22 years? Why has
he acted as the agent of an
association which was scattered
to the winds 26 years ago?
"I have no power to dissolve
the Japanese Students' Associa
tion," the 64-year-old anatomist
explained. "After the war I
was the only alumni member
left and I was just stuck with
it."
Okumoto recounted the half
forgotten story of the Japanese
Students' association, which
flourished at Stanford for 28
years.
The Japanese organized in

the first years of this century.
Most of the members were ac
tually Nisei, second generation
American citizens. In 1914 the
association was chartered by
California.
Evidently the Japanese want
ed their own house on campus,
because the fraternities were
largely closed to students with
oriental appearance. In 1916
they leased the lot on Santa
Ynez street from Stanford, and
built their white stucco club
house in the shade of a giant
eucalyptus tree.
Okumoto, born in Hawaii,
came to Stanford as an under
graduate in 1925.
Okumoto recalls that the so
cial activities of the Nisei stu
dents centered on their club
house, but they were hardly
isolated from the campus. The
Nisei held open house parties
and occasionally non-Japanese
students lived in the clubhouse.
Each spring- the entire as
sociation posed for a por
trait with University presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Today the portraits sit in a
dusty stack in the basement
of condemned Tamarack
Lodge.
"Before the war, we were
considered the cleanest house
on campus," Okumoto recollec
ted.
Okumoto graduated in 1928
and went to work in the ana
tomy department. He stayed
with the Japanese Students' As
sociation, not knowing that one
day he would be its last mem
ber.
As tensions between the U.S.
and Japan grew in 1941, Japan
ese aliens at Stanford returned
home. But life at The Farm
was unchanged for the Nisei in
the clubhouse on Santa Ynez.
TThen Pearl Harbor.
Peter Ida, now a Gunn high
teacher, recalled how the Nisei
clustered around the radio that
black Sunday. "We didn't know
what would become of us. We
were scared stiff." They de
cided to walk in pairs on cam
pus for protection.
Three days later, President

Wilbur asked the campus for
tolerance toward the Japanese
students in an emergency
speech on the war. "They are
just as good Stanford people
as we are," Wilbur said.
Fears of retaliation against
Nisei were unfounded. Instead,
"the feeling on campus was one
of friendship," Ida said. He re
members several football play
ers promising to "take care of"
anyone who gave the Nisei
trouble.
But the war hysteria sealed
the fate of Japanese-Ameri
cans at Stanford and through
out the West. President Roo
sevelt fearing fifth-column
subversion, ordered all aliens
and citizens of Japanese an
cestry "evacuated" to special
camps.
Japanese families near the
Presidio in San Francisco had
24 hours notice before "reloca
tion," Okumoto recalled.
A sudden curfew in March
forbid Japanese to travel. Most
of Stanford's Japanese students
were home on vacation. Unable
to return to Stanford's sanctu
ary, they were soon evacuated
with their families.
But a handful rushed back to
Stanford to beat the curfew.
This remnant included Okumo
to, Ida, History Prof. Yamato
Ichihashi, and several seniors
anxious to earn their diplomas
before imprisonment.
President Wilbur interceded
with the Army to delay the
evacuation of the Santa Clara
County district, which included
Stanford.
Months of bloody defeats
soured the mood of the Ameri
can people, and some of the un
controlled hatred seeped into
Stanford. On April 10, 1942, all
angry editorial in The Daily
said: "We have just lost 36,000
fathers and brothers and sweet
hearts to the invading Jap dogs
at Bataan."
The previous day, a fiery
Daily staff member advocated
shooting "all possible fifth-col
umnists," because "efficiency not
humaneness, wins the war."
Three days later Paul Yama
moto wrote in reply, "Since I
am one of those possible fifth
columnists ... I would like to

comment before the government
decides to shoot us." Yamamoto
pointed out that loyal citizens
were being lawlessly "evicted
from our homes."
Evacuation orders for the re
maining Nisei were expected any
day. Not knowing where he was
going, or for how long, Okumoto
sold the posessions he could not
carry and bought a sleeping bag.
The 1942 Quad ran pictures of
the last members of the Japan
ese Students' Association, with
the the inscription, "The boys
with perpetual 8 o'clock lock-ins
won't be with us much longer."
Under the March curfew law. all
Nisei had to be indoors at 8 p.m.
On May 26 Stanford's last Ni
sei boarded a guarded, darkened
train and sped off to concentra
tion camps. No Japanese would
return to the white stucco lodge
on Santa Ynez street.
"We were treated roughly,"
said Okumoto dispassionately.
"But this was war. We had to
take it"
Okumoto and others wound
up at the Heart Mountain camp
in the empty plains of Wyoming.
Ten thousand Japanese lived in
barracks there, surrounded by a
six-foot barbed wire fence with
armed guards in towers. Oku
moto tried to get a job at the
camp hospital, but the equip
ment for his specialty was un
available, so he "didn't have a
thing to do." Others at his camp
worked in the fields for meager
pay.
Ida was lucky. He was per
mitted to enroll at the Univer
sity of Nebraska after a few
months in camp.
Paul Yamamoto, along with
thousands of other interned Ni
sei, was drafted by the Army
during a 1943 manpower crisis.
He served as an interpreter in
the Philippines from 1944 to
1946.
Okumoto got out of Heart
Mountain when a Stanford ana
tomy professor secured permis
sion in 1945 for him to return
to his old job. Okumoto was one
of the first Nisei permitted back
in California.
During Okumoto's absence,

the University rented the Japan
ese clubhouse to the Walter
Thompson Cooperative Club, a
group of American students. Ap
parently they treated the lodge
poorly, because in 1946 Dean
of Students John Stalnaker gave
the house back to Okumoto be
cause it was too "run-down."
A group of American and for
eign students moved into the
lodge, paying rent to Okumoto
as the Japanese Students' Asso
ciation's only member.
As Nisei students gradually
drifted back to Stanford, Oku
moto tried to get the associa
tion started again. He failed.
"Before we were evacuated,"
he recalled bitterly, "President
Wilbur promised we could con

tinue as before if we ever came
back. But after the war the Uni
versity was not interested in let
ting us survive. They felt Japan
ese students just wanted to seg
regate themselves from the cam
pus."
And the Nisei showed no in
terest in reviving the club.
Okumoto, discouraged, stopped
caring about the lodge, which
its residents had renamed Tam
arack after the Sierra pine tree.
For two decades Tamarack
Lodge lived a life after death,
forgotten by the University,
scorned by Okumoto, and
housing students who enjoyed
living there but cared nothing
for Tamarack's past or future.

Each year Okumoto collected
the room rents, paid property
taxes and the ground lease, and
made a few repairs. Meanwhile
he redeposited the interest of
the swelling bank account of the
defunct Japanese Students' Asso
ciation. (The account now has
over $5,000, which Okumoto
may give to the University.)
Each year Tamarack's floor
sagged, the pilings settled, and
the roof let in more rainwater.
Now the last residents of
Tamarack have their eviction
orders. The old lodge won't be
haunted by its grotesque mem
ories much longer—if Stanford
doesn't raze Tamarack by March
4, $642 in property taxes will
fall due.


ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER — The Japanese Students' Assoeiation posed for this picture in
May, 1940 with Stanford President Ray Lyman Wilbur (center). Two years later the last group of the
Japanese were "exacuated" to concentration camps.
Tucked inconspicuously beneath a cuca
lvptus tree on Santa Ynez street is a
quietly decaying white house.
Stanford students have lived there since
1917. Mortally wounded in 1942, the house
has died a lingering death and will suf
fer the coup de grace next month from a
wrecker's ball.
In its elegant youth the house was called
the Japanese Clubhouse. Now the name
"Tamarack Lodge" is above the front door.
Tamarack Is haunted by uneasy mem
ories.
The condemned house is the last visible
reminder of the incredible fate of its
builders and owners, the Japanese students
of Stanford. In 1942, the U.S. Army sent
40 students and one professor of Japanese
ancestry to concentration camps, where
most lived behind barbed wire until 1945.
Japanese students never returned to
their clubhouse. Renamed Tamarack, it
was run as a student cooperative. Years
of neglect finally caught up with the old
house. In a general crackdown last year
on campus residences, Santa Clara County
health and fire officials cited Tamarack
for 23 violations.

The University has asked Tamarack's
13 residents to move out by January 30.
"We can't continue to allow students to
live there," explained Dan Williams, as
sistant dean of students.
The eviction comes as no surprise to
Tamarack's occupants. "We were aware
since last summer that Tamarack was up
for inspection," said Carl Treseder, a sen
ior in history and the cooperative's man
ager. "This building is not worth saving."
Treseder is sorry to leave. He paid only
$120 rent a quarter for his single room.
"Here I can have my room the way I want
it,"he commented wistfully, gazing at the
walls painted blue, orange, yellow, and
white.
Despite a high turnover of residents,
Tamarack was renowned as a congenial
mixture of graduates and undergraduates.
Americans and foreign students. "It was
a very nice number of people to have to
gether," Treseder said. "If you didn't
mind a dumpy place, it was a nice place
to live."
And Tamarack is a dump, like any haun
ted house. It shows its 50 years of age: the
pilings that serve as a foundation are set
tling, the floors sag. the walls are cracked,
the plaster peels, and naked light bulbs

24 hours notice before "reloca
tion," Okumoto recalled.
A sudden curfew in March
forbid Japanese to travel. Most
of Stanford's Japanese students
were home on vacation. Unable
to return to Stanford's sanctu
ary, they were soon evacuated
with their families.
But a handful rushed back to
Stanford to beat the curfew.
This remnant included Okumo
to, Ida, History Prof. Yamato
Ichihashi, and several seniors
anxious to earn their diplomas
before imprisonment.
President Wilbur interceded
with the Army to delay the
evacuation of the Santa Clara
County district, which included
Stanford.
Months of bloody defeats
soured the mood of the Ameri
can people, and some of the un
controlled hatred seeped into
Stanford. On April 10, 1942, all
angry editorial in The Daily
said: "We have just lost 36,000
fathers and brothers and sweet
hearts to the invading Jap dogs
at Bataan."
The previous day, a fiery
Daily staff member advocated
shooting "all possible fifth-col
umnists," because "efficiency not
humaneness, wins the war."
Three days later Paul Yama
moto wrote in reply, "Since I
am one of those possible fifth
columnists ... I would like to

comment before the government
decides to shoot us." Yamamoto
pointed out that loyal citizens
were being lawlessly "evicted
from our homes."
Evacuation orders for the re
maining Nisei were expected any
day. Not knowing where he was
going, or for how long, Okumoto
sold the posessions he could not
carry and bought a sleeping bag.
The 1942 Quad ran pictures of
the last members of the Japan
ese Students' Association, with
the the inscription, "The boys
with perpetual 8 o'clock lock-ins
won't be with us much longer."
Under the March curfew law. all
Nisei had to be indoors at 8 p.m.
On May 26 Stanford's last Ni
sei boarded a guarded, darkened
train and sped off to concentra
tion camps. No Japanese would
return to the white stucco lodge
on Santa Ynez street.
"We were treated roughly,"
said Okumoto dispassionately.
"But this was war. We had to
take it"
Okumoto and others wound
up at the Heart Mountain camp
in the empty plains of Wyoming.
Ten thousand Japanese lived in
barracks there, surrounded by a
six-foot barbed wire fence with
armed guards in towers. Oku
moto tried to get a job at the
camp hospital, but the equip
ment for his specialty was un
available, so he "didn't have a
thing to do." Others at his camp
worked in the fields for meager
pay.
Ida was lucky. He was per
mitted to enroll at the Univer
sity of Nebraska after a few
months in camp.
Paul Yamamoto, along with
thousands of other interned Ni
sei, was drafted by the Army
during a 1943 manpower crisis.
He served as an interpreter in
the Philippines from 1944 to
1946.
Okumoto got out of Heart
Mountain when a Stanford ana
tomy professor secured permis
sion in 1945 for him to return
to his old job. Okumoto was one
of the first Nisei permitted back
in California.
During Okumoto's absence,

the University rented the Japan
ese clubhouse to the Walter
Thompson Cooperative Club, a
group of American students. Ap
parently they treated the lodge
poorly, because in 1946 Dean
of Students John Stalnaker gave
the house back to Okumoto be
cause it was too "run-down."
A group of American and for
eign students moved into the
lodge, paying rent to Okumoto
as the Japanese Students' Asso
ciation's only member.
As Nisei students gradually
drifted back to Stanford, Oku
moto tried to get the associa
tion started again. He failed.
"Before we were evacuated,"
he recalled bitterly, "President
Wilbur promised we could con

tinue as before if we ever came
back. But after the war the Uni
versity was not interested in let
ting us survive. They felt Japan
ese students just wanted to seg
regate themselves from the cam
pus."
And the Nisei showed no in
terest in reviving the club.
Okumoto, discouraged, stopped
caring about the lodge, which
its residents had renamed Tam
arack after the Sierra pine tree.
For two decades Tamarack
Lodge lived a life after death,
forgotten by the University,
scorned by Okumoto, and
housing students who enjoyed
living there but cared nothing
for Tamarack's past or future.

Each year Okumoto collected
the room rents, paid property
taxes and the ground lease, and
made a few repairs. Meanwhile
he redeposited the interest of
the swelling bank account of the
defunct Japanese Students' Asso
ciation. (The account now has
over $5,000, which Okumoto
may give to the University.)
Each year Tamarack's floor
sagged, the pilings settled, and
the roof let in more rainwater.
Now the last residents of
Tamarack have their eviction
orders. The old lodge won't be
haunted by its grotesque mem
ories much longer—if Stanford
doesn't raze Tamarack by March
4, $642 in property taxes will
fall due.


ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER — The Japanese Students' Assoeiation posed for this picture in
May, 1940 with Stanford President Ray Lyman Wilbur (center). Two years later the last group of the
Japanese were "exacuated" to concentration camps.
Tucked inconspicuously beneath a cuca
lvptus tree on Santa Ynez street is a
quietly decaying white house.
Stanford students have lived there since
1917. Mortally wounded in 1942, the house
has died a lingering death and will suf
fer the coup de grace next month from a
wrecker's ball.
In its elegant youth the house was called
the Japanese Clubhouse. Now the name
"Tamarack Lodge" is above the front door.
Tamarack Is haunted by uneasy mem
ories.
The condemned house is the last visible
reminder of the incredible fate of its
builders and owners, the Japanese students
of Stanford. In 1942, the U.S. Army sent
40 students and one professor of Japanese
ancestry to concentration camps, where
most lived behind barbed wire until 1945.
Japanese students never returned to
their clubhouse. Renamed Tamarack, it
was run as a student cooperative. Years
of neglect finally caught up with the old
house. In a general crackdown last year
on campus residences, Santa Clara County
health and fire officials cited Tamarack
for 23 violations.

The University has asked Tamarack's
13 residents to move out by January 30.
"We can't continue to allow students to
live there," explained Dan Williams, as
sistant dean of students.
The eviction comes as no surprise to
Tamarack's occupants. "We were aware
since last summer that Tamarack was up
for inspection," said Carl Treseder, a sen
ior in history and the cooperative's man
ager. "This building is not worth saving."
Treseder is sorry to leave. He paid only
$120 rent a quarter for his single room.
"Here I can have my room the way I want
it,"he commented wistfully, gazing at the
walls painted blue, orange, yellow, and
white.
Despite a high turnover of residents,
Tamarack was renowned as a congenial
mixture of graduates and undergraduates.
Americans and foreign students. "It was
a very nice number of people to have to
gether," Treseder said. "If you didn't
mind a dumpy place, it was a nice place
to live."
And Tamarack is a dump, like any haun
ted house. It shows its 50 years of age: the
pilings that serve as a foundation are set
tling, the floors sag. the walls are cracked,
the plaster peels, and naked light bulbs

hang from the ceiling.
The gas stove burns In the
kitchen to provide heat. Tam
arack's furnace exploded last
March.
The living room is a study
in faded gentility — discolored
wood paneling; soiled rug; an
ancient piano that doesn't play.
Tamarack's longevity is re
markable; the house seemingly
lost any reason for existence
when its Japanese owners and
members disappeared in 1942.
Decay was rapid—a 1946 report
called it "unsuitable" for stu
dent housing because of its
"run-down condition." A 1957
report said Tamarack needed
"major structural and mechan
ical work."
"Inside this thing is a tin
derbox," Treseder observed.
"There's only one electrical
outlet in each room. The place
wasn't even properly wired In
1917.
But at least the roof doesn't
leak any longer. In 1966 a
wizened old man who takes
care of bones for the anatomy
department paid for roof re
pairs. He is Yoshio Okumoto,
Tamarack's landlord.
As the sole remaining mem
ber since 1945 of the Japanese
Students' association, Okumoto
has collected part of the occu
pant's rent and paid property
taxes and $100 a year to Stan
ford for the ground lease. And
when he could save a little out
of the rent payments, Okumoto
made repairs.
Why has Okumoto bothered
to be landlord of a haunted
house for 22 years? Why has
he acted as the agent of an
association which was scattered
to the winds 26 years ago?
"I have no power to dissolve
the Japanese Students' Associa
tion," the 64-year-old anatomist
explained. "After the war I
was the only alumni member
left and I was just stuck with
it."
Okumoto recounted the half
forgotten story of the Japanese
Students' association, which
flourished at Stanford for 28
years.
The Japanese organized in

the first years of this century.
Most of the members were ac
tually Nisei, second generation
American citizens. In 1914 the
association was chartered by
California.
Evidently the Japanese want
ed their own house on campus,
because the fraternities were
largely closed to students with
oriental appearance. In 1916
they leased the lot on Santa
Ynez street from Stanford, and
built their white stucco club
house in the shade of a giant
eucalyptus tree.
Okumoto, born in Hawaii,
came to Stanford as an under
graduate in 1925.
Okumoto recalls that the so
cial activities of the Nisei stu
dents centered on their club
house, but they were hardly
isolated from the campus. The
Nisei held open house parties
and occasionally non-Japanese
students lived in the clubhouse.
Each spring- the entire as
sociation posed for a por
trait with University presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Today the portraits sit in a
dusty stack in the basement
of condemned Tamarack
Lodge.
"Before the war, we were
considered the cleanest house
on campus," Okumoto recollec
ted.
Okumoto graduated in 1928
and went to work in the ana
tomy department. He stayed
with the Japanese Students' As
sociation, not knowing that one
day he would be its last mem
ber.
As tensions between the U.S.
and Japan grew in 1941, Japan
ese aliens at Stanford returned
home. But life at The Farm
was unchanged for the Nisei in
the clubhouse on Santa Ynez.
TThen Pearl Harbor.
Peter Ida, now a Gunn high
teacher, recalled how the Nisei
clustered around the radio that
black Sunday. "We didn't know
what would become of us. We
were scared stiff." They de
cided to walk in pairs on cam
pus for protection.
Three days later, President

Wilbur asked the campus for
tolerance toward the Japanese
students in an emergency
speech on the war. "They are
just as good Stanford people
as we are," Wilbur said.
Fears of retaliation against
Nisei were unfounded. Instead,
"the feeling on campus was one
of friendship," Ida said. He re
members several football play
ers promising to "take care of"
anyone who gave the Nisei
trouble.
But the war hysteria sealed
the fate of Japanese-Ameri
cans at Stanford and through
out the West. President Roo
sevelt fearing fifth-column
subversion, ordered all aliens
and citizens of Japanese an
cestry "evacuated" to special
camps.
Japanese families near the
Presidio in San Francisco had
24 hours notice before "reloca

Tamarack have their eviction
orders. The old lodge won't be
haunted by its grotesque mem

doesn't raze Tamarack by March

fall due.


ON THE BRINK OF DISASTER — The Japanese Students' Assoeiation posed for this picture in
May, 1940 with Stanford President Ray Lyman Wilbur (center). Two years later the last group of the
Japanese were "exacuated" to concentration camps.
Tucked inconspicuously beneath a cuca
lvptus tree on Santa Ynez street is a
quietly decaying white house.
Stanford students have lived there since
1917. Mortally wounded in 1942, the house
has died a lingering death and will suf
fer the coup de grace next month from a
wrecker's ball.
In its elegant youth the house was called
the Japanese Clubhouse. Now the name
"Tamarack Lodge" is above the front door.
Tamarack Is haunted by uneasy mem
ories.
The condemned house is the last visible
reminder of the incredible fate of its
builders and owners, the Japanese students
of Stanford. In 1942, the U.S. Army sent
40 students and one professor of Japanese
ancestry to concentration camps, where
most lived behind barbed wire until 1945.
Japanese students never returned to
their clubhouse. Renamed Tamarack, it
was run as a student cooperative. Years
of neglect finally caught up with the old
house. In a general crackdown last year
on campus residences, Santa Clara County
health and fire officials cited Tamarack
for 23 violations.

The University has asked Tamarack's
13 residents to move out by January 30.
"We can't continue to allow students to
live there," explained Dan Williams, as
sistant dean of students.
The eviction comes as no surprise to
Tamarack's occupants. "We were aware
since last summer that Tamarack was up
for inspection," said Carl Treseder, a sen
ior in history and the cooperative's man
ager. "This building is not worth saving."
Treseder is sorry to leave. He paid only
$120 rent a quarter for his single room.
"Here I can have my room the way I want
it,"he commented wistfully, gazing at the
walls painted blue, orange, yellow, and
white.
Despite a high turnover of residents,
Tamarack was renowned as a congenial
mixture of graduates and undergraduates.
Americans and foreign students. "It was
a very nice number of people to have to
gether," Treseder said. "If you didn't
mind a dumpy place, it was a nice place
to live."
And Tamarack is a dump, like any haun
ted house. It shows its 50 years of age: the
pilings that serve as a foundation are set
tling, the floors sag. the walls are cracked,
the plaster peels, and naked light bulbs

hang from the ceiling.
The gas stove burns In the
kitchen to provide heat. Tam
arack's furnace exploded last
March.
The living room is a study
in faded gentility — discolored
wood paneling; soiled rug; an
ancient piano that doesn't play.
Tamarack's longevity is re
markable; the house seemingly
lost any reason for existence
when its Japanese owners and
members disappeared in 1942.
Decay was rapid—a 1946 report
called it "unsuitable" for stu
dent housing because of its
"run-down condition." A 1957
report said Tamarack needed
"major structural and mechan
ical work."
"Inside this thing is a tin
derbox," Treseder observed.
"There's only one electrical
outlet in each room. The place
wasn't even properly wired In
1917.
But at least the roof doesn't
leak any longer. In 1966 a
wizened old man who takes
care of bones for the anatomy
department paid for roof re
pairs. He is Yoshio Okumoto,
Tamarack's landlord.
As the sole remaining mem
ber since 1945 of the Japanese
Students' association, Okumoto
has collected part of the occu
pant's rent and paid property
taxes and $100 a year to Stan
ford for the ground lease. And
when he could save a little out
of the rent payments, Okumoto
made repairs.
Why has Okumoto bothered
to be landlord of a haunted
house for 22 years? Why has
he acted as the agent of an
association which was scattered
to the winds 26 years ago?
"I have no power to dissolve
the Japanese Students' Associa
tion," the 64-year-old anatomist
explained. "After the war I
was the only alumni member
left and I was just stuck with
it."
Okumoto recounted the half
forgotten story of the Japanese
Students' association, which
flourished at Stanford for 28
years.
The Japanese organized in

the first years of this century.
Most of the members were ac
tually Nisei, second generation
American citizens. In 1914 the
association was chartered by
California.
Evidently the Japanese want
ed their own house on campus,
because the fraternities were
largely closed to students with
oriental appearance. In 1916
they leased the lot on Santa
Ynez street from Stanford, and
built their white stucco club
house in the shade of a giant
eucalyptus tree.
Okumoto, born in Hawaii,
came to Stanford as an under
graduate in 1925.
Okumoto recalls that the so
cial activities of the Nisei stu
dents centered on their club
house, but they were hardly
isolated from the campus. The
Nisei held open house parties
and occasionally non-Japanese
students lived in the clubhouse.
Each spring- the entire as
sociation posed for a por
trait with University presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Today the portraits sit in a
dusty stack in the basement
of condemned Tamarack
Lodge.
"Before the war, we were
considered the cleanest house
on campus," Okumoto recollec
ted.
Okumoto graduated in 1928
and went to work in the ana
tomy department. He stayed
with the Japanese Students' As
sociation, not knowing that one
day he would be its last mem
ber.
As tensions between the U.S.
and Japan grew in 1941, Japan
ese aliens at Stanford returned
home. But life at The Farm
was unchanged for the Nisei in
the clubhouse on Santa Ynez.
TThen Pearl Harbor.
Peter Ida, now a Gunn high
teacher, recalled how the Nisei
clustered around the radio that
black Sunday. "We didn't know
what would become of us. We
were scared stiff." They de
cided to walk in pairs on cam
pus for protection.
Three days later, President

Wilbur asked the campus for
tolerance toward the Japanese
students in an emergency
speech on the war. "They are
just as good Stanford people
as we are," Wilbur said.
Fears of retaliation against
Nisei were unfounded. Instead,
"the feeling on campus was one
of friendship," Ida said. He re
members several football play
ers promising to "take care of"
anyone who gave the Nisei
trouble.
But the war hysteria sealed
the fate of Japanese-Ameri
cans at Stanford and through
out the West. President Roo
sevelt fearing fifth-column
subversion, ordered all aliens
and citizens of Japanese an
cestry "evacuated" to special
camps.
Japanese families near the
Presidio in San Francisco had
24 hours notice before "reloca
tion," Okumoto recalled.
A sudden curfew in March
forbid Japanese to travel. Most
of Stanford's Japanese students
were home on vacation. Unable
to return to Stanford's sanctu
ary, they were soon evacuated
with their families.
But a handful rushed back to
Stanford to beat the curfew.
This remnant included Okumo
to, Ida, History Prof. Yamato
Ichihashi, and several seniors
anxious to earn their diplomas
before imprisonment.
President Wilbur interceded
with the Army to delay the
evacuation of the Santa Clara
County district, which included
Stanford.
Months of bloody defeats
soured the mood of the Ameri
can people, and some of the un
controlled hatred seeped into
Stanford. On April 10, 1942, all
angry editorial in The Daily
said: "We have just lost 36,000
fathers and brothers and sweet
hearts to the invading Jap dogs
at Bataan."
The previous day, a fiery
Daily staff member advocated
shooting "all possible fifth-col
umnists," because "efficiency not
humaneness, wins the war."
Three days later Paul Yama
moto wrote in reply, "Since I
am one of those possible fifth
columnists ... I would like to

comment before the government
decides to shoot us." Yamamoto
pointed out that loyal citizens
were being lawlessly "evicted
from our homes."
Evacuation orders for the re
maining Nisei were expected any
day. Not knowing where he was
going, or for how long, Okumoto
sold the posessions he could not
carry and bought a sleeping bag.
The 1942 Quad ran pictures of
the last members of the Japan
ese Students' Association, with
the the inscription, "The boys
with perpetual 8 o'clock lock-ins
won't be with us much longer."
Under the March curfew law. all
Nisei had to be indoors at 8 p.m.
On May 26 Stanford's last Ni
sei boarded a guarded, darkened
train and sped off to concentra
tion camps. No Japanese would
return to the white stucco lodge
on Santa Ynez street.
"We were treated roughly,"
said Okumoto dispassionately.
"But this was war. We had to
take it"
Okumoto and others wound
up at the Heart Mountain camp
in the empty plains of Wyoming.
Ten thousand Japanese lived in
barracks there, surrounded by a
six-foot barbed wire fence with
armed guards in towers. Oku
moto tried to get a job at the
camp hospital, but the equip
ment for his specialty was un
available, so he "didn't have a
thing to do." Others at his camp
worked in the fields for meager
pay.
Ida was lucky. He was per
mitted to enroll at the Univer
sity of Nebraska after a few
months in camp.
Paul Yamamoto, along with
thousands of other interned Ni
sei, was drafted by the Army
during a 1943 manpower crisis.
He served as an interpreter in
the Philippines from 1944 to
1946.
Okumoto got out of Heart
Mountain when a Stanford ana
tomy professor secured permis
sion in 1945 for him to return
to his old job. Okumoto was one
of the first Nisei permitted back
in California.
During Okumoto's absence,

the University rented the Japan
ese clubhouse to the Walter
Thompson Cooperative Club, a
group of American students. Ap
parently they treated the lodge
poorly, because in 1946 Dean
of Students John Stalnaker gave
the house back to Okumoto be
cause it was too "run-down."
A group of American and for
eign students moved into the
lodge, paying rent to Okumoto
as the Japanese Students' Asso
ciation's only member.
As Nisei students gradually
drifted back to Stanford, Oku
moto tried to get the associa
tion started again. He failed.
"Before we were evacuated,"
he recalled bitterly, "President
Wilbur promised we could con

tinue as before if we ever came
back. But after the war the Uni
versity was not interested in let
ting us survive. They felt Japan
ese students just wanted to seg
regate themselves from the cam
pus."
And the Nisei showed no in
terest in reviving the club.
Okumoto, discouraged, stopped
caring about the lodge, which
its residents had renamed Tam
arack after the Sierra pine tree.
For two decades Tamarack
Lodge lived a life after death,
forgotten by the University,
scorned by Okumoto, and
housing students who enjoyed
living there but cared nothing
for Tamarack's past or future.

Each year Okumoto collected
the room rents, paid property
taxes and the ground lease, and
made a few repairs. Meanwhile
he redeposited the interest of
the swelling bank account of the
defunct Japanese Students' Asso
ciation. (The account now has
over $5,000, which Okumoto
may give to the University.)
Each year Tamarack's floor
sagged, the pilings settled, and
the roof let in more rainwater.
Now the last residents of
Tamarack have their eviction
orders. The old lodge won't be
haunted by its grotesque mem
ories much longer—if Stanford
doesn't raze Tamarack by March
4, $642 in property taxes will
fall due.

forgotten story of the Japanese
Students' association, which
flourished at Stanford for 28
years.
The Japanese organized in

the first years of this century.
Most of the members were ac
tually Nisei, second generation
American citizens. In 1914 the
association was chartered by
California.
Evidently the Japanese want
ed their own house on campus,
because the fraternities were
largely closed to students with
oriental appearance. In 1916
they leased the lot on Santa
Ynez street from Stanford, and
built their white stucco club
house in the shade of a giant
eucalyptus tree.
Okumoto, born in Hawaii,
came to Stanford as an under
graduate in 1925.
Okumoto recalls that the so
cial activities of the Nisei stu
dents centered on their club
house, but they were hardly
isolated from the campus. The
Nisei held open house parties
and occasionally non-Japanese
students lived in the clubhouse.
Each spring- the entire as
sociation posed for a por
trait with University presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Today the portraits sit in a
dusty stack in the basement
of condemned Tamarack
Lodge.
"Before the war, we were
considered the cleanest house
on campus," Okumoto recollec
ted.
Okumoto graduated in 1928
and went to work in the ana
tomy department. He stayed
with the Japanese Students' As
sociation, not knowing that one
day he would be its last mem
ber.
As tensions between the U.S.
and Japan grew in 1941, Japan
ese aliens at Stanford returned
home. But life at The Farm
was unchanged for the Nisei in
the clubhouse on Santa Ynez.
TThen Pearl Harbor.
Peter Ida, now a Gunn high
teacher, recalled how the Nisei
clustered around the radio that
black Sunday. "We didn't know
what would become of us. We
were scared stiff." They de
cided to walk in pairs on cam
pus for protection.
Three days later, President

Wilbur asked the campus for
tolerance toward the Japanese
students in an emergency
speech on the war. "They are
just as good Stanford people
as we are," Wilbur said.
Fears of retaliation against
Nisei were unfounded. Instead,
"the feeling on campus was one
of friendship," Ida said. He re
members several football play
ers promising to "take care of"
anyone who gave the Nisei
trouble.
But the war hysteria sealed
the fate of Japanese-Ameri
cans at Stanford and through
out the West. President Roo
sevelt fearing fifth-column
subversion, ordered all aliens
and citizens of Japanese an
cestry "evacuated" to special
camps.
Japanese families near the
Presidio in San Francisco had
24 hours notice before "reloca
tion," Okumoto recalled.
A sudden curfew in March
forbid Japanese to travel. Most
of Stanford's Japanese students
were home on vacation. Unable
to return to Stanford's sanctu
ary, they were soon evacuated
with their families.
But a handful rushed back to
Stanford to beat the curfew.
This remnant included Okumo
to, Ida, History Prof. Yamato
Ichihashi, and several seniors
anxious to earn their diplomas
before imprisonment.
President Wilbur interceded
with the Army to delay the
evacuation of the Santa Clara
County district, which included
Stanford.
Months of bloody defeats
soured the mood of the Ameri
can people, and some of the un
controlled hatred seeped into
Stanford. On April 10, 1942, all
angry editorial in The Daily
said: "We have just lost 36,000
fathers and brothers and sweet
hearts to the invading Jap dogs
at Bataan."
The previous day, a fiery
Daily staff member advocated
shooting "all possible fifth-col
umnists," because "efficiency not
humaneness, wins the war."
Three days later Paul Yama
moto wrote in reply, "Since I
am one of those possible fifth
columnists ... I would like to

comment before the government
decides to shoot us." Yamamoto
pointed out that loyal citizens
were being lawlessly "evicted
from our homes."
Evacuation orders for the re
maining Nisei were expected any
day. Not knowing where he was
going, or for how long, Okumoto
sold the posessions he could not
carry and bought a sleeping bag.
The 1942 Quad ran pictures of
the last members of the Japan
ese Students' Association, with
the the inscription, "The boys
with perpetual 8 o'clock lock-ins
won't be with us much longer."
Under the March curfew law. all
Nisei had to be indoors at 8 p.m.
On May 26 Stanford's last Ni
sei boarded a guarded, darkened
train and sped off to concentra
tion camps. No Japanese would
return to the white stucco lodge
on Santa Ynez street.
"We were treated roughly,"
said Okumoto dispassionately.
"But this was war. We had to
take it"
Okumoto and others wound
up at the Heart Mountain camp
in the empty plains of Wyoming.
Ten thousand Japanese lived in
barracks there, surrounded by a
six-foot barbed wire fence with
armed guards in towers. Oku
moto tried to get a job at the
camp hospital, but the equip
ment for his specialty was un
available, so he "didn't have a
thing to do." Others at his camp
worked in the fields for meager
pay.
Ida was lucky. He was per
mitted to enroll at the Univer
sity of Nebraska after a few
months in camp.
Paul Yamamoto, along with
thousands of other interned Ni
sei, was drafted by the Army
during a 1943 manpower crisis.
He served as an interpreter in
the Philippines from 1944 to
1946.
Okumoto got out of Heart
Mountain when a Stanford ana
tomy professor secured permis
sion in 1945 for him to return
to his old job. Okumoto was one
of the first Nisei permitted back
in California.
During Okumoto's absence,

the University rented the Japan
ese clubhouse to the Walter
Thompson Cooperative Club, a
group of American students. Ap
parently they treated the lodge
poorly, because in 1946 Dean
of Students John Stalnaker gave
the house back to Okumoto be
cause it was too "run-down."
A group of American and for
eign students moved into the
lodge, paying rent to Okumoto
as the Japanese Students' Asso
ciation's only member.
As Nisei students gradually
drifted back to Stanford, Oku
moto tried to get the associa
tion started again. He failed.
"Before we were evacuated,"
he recalled bitterly, "President
Wilbur promised we could con

tinue as before if we ever came
back. But after the war the Uni
versity was not interested in let
ting us survive. They felt Japan
ese students just wanted to seg
regate themselves from the cam
pus."
And the Nisei showed no in
terest in reviving the club.
Okumoto, discouraged, stopped
caring about the lodge, which
its residents had renamed Tam
arack after the Sierra pine tree.
For two decades Tamarack
Lodge lived a life after death,
forgotten by the University,
scorned by Okumoto, and
housing students who enjoyed
living there but cared nothing
for Tamarack's past or future.

Each year Okumoto collected
the room rents, paid property
taxes and the ground lease, and
made a few repairs. Meanwhile
he redeposited the interest of
the swelling bank account of the
defunct Japanese Students' Asso
ciation. (The account now has
over $5,000, which Okumoto
may give to the University.)
Each year Tamarack's floor
sagged, the pilings settled, and
the roof let in more rainwater.
Now the last residents of
Tamarack have their eviction
orders. The old lodge won't be
haunted by its grotesque mem
ories much longer—if Stanford
doesn't raze Tamarack by March
4, $642 in property taxes will
fall due.
