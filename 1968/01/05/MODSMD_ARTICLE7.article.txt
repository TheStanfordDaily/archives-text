## 
### H. KENTON ROLPH 
Robert McAfee Brown k *y
noted a political forum in Cub
berl >y Auditorium last night for
mally launching th 1 McCarthy
for President campaign in th">
Palo Alto-Stanford area.
Brown also m-de the
epectcd announcement that Sen
ator McCarthy, who is challeng
ing Johnson for the Presidency
wi'hin the Democratic Party,
will speak at Stanford on Jan
uary 15 at 12 noon.
Leppert, professor of
engineering, also spoke at the
meeting concerning the role of
the California Democratic Coun
cil in the McCarthy drive and
urged an autonomous student
McCarthy effort at Stanford.
Brown's remarks focused on
the background and personality
of the Minnesota Senator since
Brown is personally acquainted
with McCarthy having served on
his congressional campaign st >ff
in 1952.
Political Frustration
Pointing to the "mood of po
litical frustration" that tolay
has isolated and divide'! many
political forces in the United
Brown posed Senator
McCarthy as a the long-sought
personality that could marshal
electoral strength nationwide
against the Johnson policies in
Vietnam.
Senator McCarthy is pacing
his whole future on the line,
Brown said, sine if "he doesn't
pull it off LBJ won't exactly ex
tend the olive branch after the
election . . . But McCarthy has
run seven times and he has won
sevn times. This is at l a"t one
thing he h~s in common with
his opponent."
Characterizing McCarthy as
one of the only two recent Presi
dential candidates who qualify
as "genuine intellectuals," the
other being Adlai Stevenson.
Brown termed th n senator a man
of "courage, political wisdom and
vision for whom principle and
integrity is not just a phony gar
ment but the real thing."
Brown discounted rumors that
McCarthy is running merely as
a for Robert Ken
nedy by caring to mind Mc-

Carthy's 1960 plea at the T os
Angeles Democratic Convent.on
for the nomination of Adlai Stev
enson. That speech Brown con
tinued. spark little 'ove be
tween McCarthy and the Ken
nedys.
Brown also recounted a re
cent humorous r ply by Mc-
Carthy when he was ask >d by a
reporter whether he is a stalk
ing horse for K nnedy: "No.
I'm only a stalking horse for
Sir Thomas More."
Outlining the thesis of Mc-
Carthy's latest book The Limits
of P<>w t. Brown c mm nt 'd
that the senator has advocated
main points in opposition
to present American foreign pol
icy: 1) more readiness on the
part of the U.S. to use interna
tional devices, 2) morn e X t >nsive
control over the distribution of
arms among underdeveloped na

tions and 3) a larger role in the
formation of foreign policy for
the Congress.
The professor of religion cited
a r nt McCarthy statement af
firming his conviction that a
shift is needed in the present
function of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee. "We have
in the Senate a definite respon
sibility to develop foreign pol
icy."
Genuinely optimistic about
McCarthy's chances, Brown con
cluded by pointing out CBS cor
respondent Mike Wallace's a
mazement with the McCarthy
bid since th'> senator's trying to
unseat Lyndon Johnson seamed
to him "like little David fighting
Goliath, impossible."
Brown posed the question,
seemingly overlooked by Wal
lace, "Who won that biblical con
test?"
