afternoon Eaminer and the in
dependent morning Chronicle.
It is likely the Examiner
will not publish today, but
Chronicle executives are ex
pected to print another 8 '/z by
13 inch tabloid run off on a

ed number of these papers are

cation In 100 years.
Doug Smith, president of
San Francisco-Oakland Mail
ers' union, Local 18, AFL-CIO,
said "Management hasn't call
ed for a meeting."
"When we broke off nego
lations on Friday," Smith said,

"we told management we
would return to the bargaining
table when they were ready
to make us a reasonable of
fer."
The mailers had been work'
ing since last March without
a contract.
The San Francisco - Oakland
Newspaper Guild, at a mem
bership meeting Sunday, pass
ed a resolution commending
all unions for supporting the
mailers in their strike and
pledged the Guild's own sup
port without reservation at
the picket line.
The Examiner has been out

pass through an "information
al" line set up by 14 pickets
from the struck Los Angeles
evening Herald ■ Examiner.
This Hearst newspaper has
continued to publish since it

was struck Dec. 15.
When the Los Angeles
unionists left, the mailers went
on strike and set up a picket
line.
Attorneys for the Examiner,
Chronicle and printing com
pany filed charges with the
National Labor Relations
Board in Los Angeles against
the San Francisco mailers and
six unions picketing the Los
Angeles Herald • Examiner, ac
cusing them of conspiracy.
R. Barry Churton, Chronicle

ers strike is all part and par
cel of a deal with the Los
Angeles unions to close down
the San Francisco news
papers."
The action was filed in Los
Angeles, Churton said "since
the whole problem originated
in the Los Angeles Herald-
Examiner strike."
