# Stanford Heart Transplanter Developed Basic Techniques
## 
### 
It was Dr. Norman Shumway's
discoveries which led to the rec
ent series of heart transplants,
and now Shumway has had the
chance to apply his techniques
himself.
The head of the Stanford
Medical Center's Division of
Cardiovascular Surgery devel
oped the surgical technique
which made heart transplants
feasible, but other problems re
main to be solved.
Major difficulties still present
in this operation are preserving
the donor's heart, matching re
cipient and donor, and preven
ting rejection of an implanted
heart without allowing massive
infection to set in.
Shumway's method of trans
plantation involves leaving part
of the recipient's damaged heart
in place, namely parts of the
walls of the two atria (the up
per chambers of the heart) and

the wall between them. The
atria receive all the veins lead
ing to the heart. This leaves
only heart tissue and areries
to be connected during surgery,
simplifying the operation.
Since the atria pump blood
only to the lower chambers of
the heart, the ventricles, they
do not have to be very strong.
This allows the surgeon to
leave some damaged tissue.
Rejection is a major problem.
The body has a built-in mechan
isms to detect foreign proteins.
When it finds them, it creates
antibodies to destroy them. This
"immunological reaction" helps
the body fight infection from
bacteria and viruses.
When an organ from another
person is grafted into the body,
the same reaction occurs, be
cause the protein in the new
tissue is considered to be for
eign matter. Thus, the body
tries to destroy a transplanted
heart.
To prevent this, doctors must
inject huge doses of certain
drugs which inhibit the immun
ological reaction. However, this
slows the body processes which
fight infection. The problem
then becomes one of finding the
dosages which will prevent re
jection of the heart while allow
ing the body to combat infec
tion.
Tissue Typing
One way of reducing the
needed dosage is by keeping the
protein of the transplanted tis
sue as similar as possible to
those of the recipient. This is
done by tissue typing, seeing
whether the two genetic struc
tures are alike enough so that
the prospective donor's heart
can be used.
Preservation Problems
But what if a donor is avail
able whose genetic structure
is too different from those of
prospective recipients? Or what
if there is no one needing the
heart at the time? For such
cases methods are needed to
preserve the organ until it can
be used.
Shumway has suggested that
a heart can be stored for several
days by attaching it to blood
vessels in the groin of an inter
mediary host. The heart would
be nourished with oxygen and
nutrients supplied by the tem
porary host's blood stream.
