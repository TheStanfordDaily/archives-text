# Postal Rates Rise— Now At 1792 Scale
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — With
the price of mailing a letter ris
ing from five to six cents Sun
day, it is turning back the clock
to the good old days — like 1792,
when it also cost six cents.
But today's postal patron will
get more for his cents than his
post-colonial forebearers did. Six
cents entitled the 1792 letter
writer to a maximum mailing
distance of a mere 30 miles.
Sunday's rate boost also af
fects classes of mail unheard of
in colonial days.
Airmail — which didn't start
until 1918 — goes from eight
cents to a dime. Post cards cost
five cents instead of four, and
airmail post cards go from six
to eight cents.
To ease the transition — the
third increase in 10 years — the
Post Office Department has
printed about four billion six
cent Franklin D. Roosevelt
stamps. Roosevelt replaces Geo
rge Washington as the most
familiar postage stamp on the
nation's letters.
Letters bearing a five-cent
stamp will be delivered but the
post office says the receiver of

the letter may have to pay a
penny postage.
Rates for third class mail,
which its critics label "junk
mail," go up about 34 per cent.
Second class mail rates — news
papers and magazines — will
rise 24 per cent over as much
as two years.
The new six-cent first-class let
ter rate supplants a five-cent rate
in effect since Jan. 7, 1963. The
four cent rate began in August,
1958. It had been three cents an
ounce since 1932.
Postage rates for letters were
more complicated in 1792. The
single-sheet letter within a 30-
mile radius was at the bottom
of a sliding scale which rose to
25 cents for single-sheet letters
destined for delivery more than
450 miles away.
The new higher rates are ex
pected to yield about $900 mil
lion a year when all rate changes
become effective in 1970. Postal
officials expect this to trim the
current $644 million annual post
al deficit to $479 million this
year. They predict this will drop
to $415 million in 1969 and rise
to $436 million in 1970.

get more for his cents than his
post-colonial forebearers did. Six
cents entitled the 1792 letter
writer to a maximum mailing
distance of a mere 30 miles.
Sunday's rate boost also af
fects classes of mail unheard of
in colonial days.
Airmail — which didn't start
until 1918 — goes from eight
cents to a dime. Post cards cost
five cents instead of four, and
airmail post cards go from six
to eight cents.
To ease the transition — the
third increase in 10 years — the
Post Office Department has
printed about four billion six
cent Franklin D. Roosevelt
stamps. Roosevelt replaces Geo
rge Washington as the most
familiar postage stamp on the
nation's letters.
Letters bearing a five-cent
stamp will be delivered but the
post office says the receiver of

the letter may have to pay a
penny postage.
Rates for third class mail,
which its critics label "junk
mail," go up about 34 per cent.
Second class mail rates — news
papers and magazines — will
rise 24 per cent over as much
as two years.
The new six-cent first-class let
ter rate supplants a five-cent rate
in effect since Jan. 7, 1963. The
four cent rate began in August,
1958. It had been three cents an
ounce since 1932.
Postage rates for letters were
more complicated in 1792. The
single-sheet letter within a 30-
mile radius was at the bottom
of a sliding scale which rose to
25 cents for single-sheet letters
destined for delivery more than
450 miles away.
The new higher rates are ex
pected to yield about $900 mil
lion a year when all rate changes
become effective in 1970. Postal
officials expect this to trim the
current $644 million annual post
al deficit to $479 million this
year. They predict this will drop
to $415 million in 1969 and rise
to $436 million in 1970.
WASHINGTON (AP) — With
the price of mailing a letter ris
ing from five to six cents Sun
day, it is turning back the clock
to the good old days — like 1792,
when it also cost six cents.

get more for his cents than his
post-colonial forebearers did. Six
