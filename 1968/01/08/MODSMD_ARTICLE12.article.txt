# Report Ho Dead
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — A South Vietnamese newspaper said Sun
day it had learned from "special sources" that North Vietna
mese President Ho Chi Minh, 77, died two weeks ago. The
report could not be confirmed. Radio Hanoi carried no men
tion of it
In London, British diplomats said they did not take the re
port seriously. The U.S. Embassy in Saigon and the State De
partment in Washington said they had no information on the
report.
The Vietnamese-language newspaper Cong Chung, a relative
newcomer among Saigon's 30 or so news publications, quoted
its sources as saying Ho died of a combination of a heart dis
ease and tuberculosis at 4 p.m., Dec. 26 in a village in Ha Tay
Province, south of Hanoi.
It added that an analysis of Ho's recent speeches and mes
sages as broadcast by Hanoi were not in his usual — some
times poetic — style, indicating they were composd by some
one else.
Monitors of North Vietnamese broadcasts in Tokyo reported
hearing nothing to indicate Ho had died.
