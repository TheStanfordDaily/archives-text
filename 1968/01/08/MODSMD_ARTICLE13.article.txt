### 
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) —
Kenyans gave Vice President
Hubert H. Humphrey a polite
but unenthusiastic welcome Sun
day after he cut short a 24-hour
visit to the neighboring Somali
Republic on the basis of ad
vance U.S. security reports of
trouble that never materialized.
As it turned out, he got the
friendliest reception there of his
nine-nation African tour.
When he arrived in Nairobi 18
hours ahead of schedule, police
already had arrested six Ken
yans who planned to demon
strate against him at the air
port. They carried anti-U.S. ban
ners.
The police were braced for
any further trouble in his 36-
hour stay in Kenya.
The reception here was dull
in contrast to the thousands of

Somalis who lined the streets
of Mogadishu, their capital, to
cheer Humphrey.
To the dismay of Somali lead
ers, Humphrey docided to cut
his visit there to eight hours on
the basis of reports from U.S.
Security advancemen that Cabi
net ministers in Mogadishu
were organizing an anti-Hum
phrey demonstration.
Somali leaders denied it.
But Humphrey's brief stay
in Mogadishu turned out to be
a pleasant surprise. Somali until
recently had been a collection
point for Sovit* and Red Chi
nese infiltration into Africa.
Somalis by the thousands
greeted him warmly at the air
port and lined both sides of the
central streets to cheer as his
motorcade swept into the capi
tal.
