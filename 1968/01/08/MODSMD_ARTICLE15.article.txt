CAPE TOWN, South Africa
(AP) â€” Cape Town held the
largest funeral in its history Sat
urday for a mulatto whose heart
was transplanted to Dr. Philip
Blaiberg, a white dentist, five
days ago.
Mrs. Blaiberg attended the fu
neral service along with Dr.
Christiaan N. Barnard, head of
the transplant team. There were
subdued cheers and some ap
plause for the heart surgeon as
he arrived with a member of his
team, Marthinus C. Botha, a
blood specialist.
Police had to call in dogs as
an excited crowd of 5,000 mu
lattos jammed the street outside
St. Luke's Anglican church in
suburban Salt River for the fu
neral of Clive Haupt, 24, who
died Tuesday of a stroke. The
crowd was orderly and the dogs
were there only as a precaution.
At the graveside in Wolte
made Cemetery, three miles
away in the suburb of Maitland,
another 2,000 South Africans
pressed forward trying to catch
a glimpse of the casket.

Groote Schuur Hospital issued
a bulletin saying that Blaiberg,
58, a dentist in whose body
Haupt's heart is now beating
steadily, is "progressing favor
ably."
Groups of people lined the
road all the way to the ceme
tery, which sprawls over many
acres. Mrs. Haupt, dressed in
black, was outwardly calm as
she arrived at the graveside but
broke down later.
There was an uneasy wait as
the pall bearers could not be
found. They may have been held
up by the crowd. Mayor Gerald
Ferry, an old friend of the fami
ly, stepped forward with several
near relatives to carry the cas
ket to the grave.
Ferry, in a short speech said:
"From this tragedy something
wonderful has occurred. All hu
manity is grateful to the family
for allowing the use of Clive's
heart."
Barnard and Botha stepped
forward and threw rose petals
on the casket.
Earlier at a news conference.
Barnard said he now wants to
do a heart transplant on an Af
rican.
Barnard explained that he
wanted to perform the operation
on a black suffering from car
diac myopathy, a progressive di
sease found mostly among Af
ricans. He said the disease
causes a high percentage of Af
rican heart failures.
With cardiac myopathy, he
continued, only the heart is af
fected and the rest of the body
is free of complications usually
found among white patients,
such as hardening of the arter
ies.
Barnard also said the medical
team had learned from a com
parison of the Blaiberg opera
tion and the heart transplant
for Louis Washkansky, who died
of pneumonia 18 days after he
was operated on Dec. 3.
The heart needs to be helped
from 12 to 24 hours and perhaps
up to 48 hours after the opera
tion, Barnard estimated.
"The heart is not functioning
as well as it should and in Blai
berg's case we used chemical
stimulations," he said. "With the
first patient, I think we were
confused a little bit and thought
this was evidence of rejection.
Rejection of the transplant
heart as a tissue alien to the
body has been of principal con
cern in the two operations in
Cape Town.
