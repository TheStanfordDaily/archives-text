### DAN SNELL 
The Academic Council abolish
ed the activity requirement Fri
day.
The Council also approved a
new policy of granting degrees
to students with interdepart
mental majors and voted to al
low the General Studies Com
mittee to waive general studies
requirements for individual stu
dents.
Undergraduates, including the
class of 1968, will no longer have

to complete six units of non
credit activity. Two of the six
units formerly had to be in phy
sical education courses.
The Executive Committee of
the Council had recommended at
the end of November that the
credits be abolished. The Aca
demic Council which met in the
Physics Tank with an above
average turnout of about 300, is
composed of all faculty members
with the rank of at least assis
tant professor.

The Council also voted to al
low the General Studies Com
mittee to grant exemptions from
specific studies requirements "in
order to permit some flexibility
in the advance planning of in
dividual courses of study."
But the Council resolution
stipulated, "It is understood that
this authority will not be used
ex post facto to grant relief from
academic deficiencies."
Integrated Majors Allowed
As many as 20 undergraduates
will be allowed by the Council
to follow interdisciplinary ma
jors.
The students would have to be
in good academic standing in
order to submit a possible pro
gram for an interdisciplinary
major. The office of the Dean of
Humanities and Sciences will ac
cept petitions for the new pro
gram.
Dean Robert Sears and his
associates proposed the program
to allow "highly motivated stu
dents to design integrated ma
jors suited to their own particu
lar needs and qualifications."
In addition to fulfilling the re
quirements for his self-designed
major, the student would have
to meet general studies and resi
dence requirements.
The interdepartmental majors
program was proposed by Law
rence Ryan, Associate Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, as a
pilot project whose results the
Study of Education at Stanford
could study.
Opposition Limited
Attempts in the past to abo
lish the activity requirements
have been opposed by the De
partments of Music and Wom
en's Physical Education because
they feared a shortage of par
ticipants in their programs if
the requirement were abolished.
This time their opposition was
not so vehement.
Luell W. Guthrie, executive
head of the Department of Wom
en's Physical Education, has said
that she contemplated some de
cline in the number of women
enrolled in courses in her de
partment.
"It may eliminate a few peo
ple who would not sample what
the University has to offer," she
said. "I don't anticipate a great
change."
Formerly the activity require
ment was that all undergradu
ates under 24 except veterans
and married students must "par
ticipate in organized activities
to a total value of six non-cre
dit units."
No more than two such units
could be earned in one quarter.
In all, more than 50 campus
organizations had been approved
by the General Studies Commit
tee as acceptable for activity
credit.
