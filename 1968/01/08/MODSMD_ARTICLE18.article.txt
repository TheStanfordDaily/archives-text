# No Ban On Recruiting
## 
### 
A letter from the White
House emphasizing that the
draft will not be used to punish
dissenters prompted the Execu
tive Committee of the Academic
Council Friday to withdraw a
resolution to ban military re
cruiting on campus.
The proposed resolution was
in reaction to a letter written
October 26 by General Lewis
Hershey, director of the Selec
tive Service System.
In that letter Hershey told
draft boards to reclassify men
who tried to interfere with the
recruitment and induction pro
cesses.
The Council decided that the
feelings of the University had
been well expressed on the mat
ter by a letter to President Lyn
don Johnson from University
President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling, made public for the first
time at the meeting Friday.
Sterling's move in speaking
out on an issue of public policy
was unprecedented.
Yale President Kingman
Brewster, Jr., sent a letter much

like Sterling's to Johnson. Pres
idential Assistant Joseph Cali
fano, Jr. replied to the letter,
assuring Brewster, "The Selec
tive Service System is not an
instrument to repress and pun
ish unpopular views."
This letter is being sent to
all local draft boards. The Aca
demic Council Executive Com
mittee withdrew the motion to
suspend military recruiting
when it became clear that Pres
ident Johnson was in effect re
pudiating Hershey's letter.
To clarify the October 26 let
ter Hershey made a joint state
ment with Attorney General
Ramsey Clark in which they as
serted the belief in due process.
But soon thereafter Hershey
was quoted as saying that his
letter still stood.
In his letter Sterling urged
that Hershey's letter be
"promptly disavowed."
Sterling concluded, "Alleged
violations of the Selective Ser
vice Act should be prosecuted
promptly through the courts â€”
and not by reclassification."
