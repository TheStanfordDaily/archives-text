### 
TOKYO (AP) — Red China
charged Sunday that U.S. planes
bombed a Chinese freighter in
the North Vietnamese port of
Cam Pha on Wednesday, wound
ing several crewmen and "ser
iously" damaging the ship It
said the Chinese "retaliated in
self-defense."
A Radio Peking broadcast,

monitored in Tokyo, said the
crew, armed with Chairman
Mao Tse-tung's thought, took
"self-defense" action but did not
specify what it was or whether
it had any effect.
Peking's official H si n h u a
news agency said the Chinese
Foreign Ministry strongly pro
tested, calling it "another grave
incident of provocation" against
China.
The statement, as quoted by
the Hsinhua dispatch monitored
here, alleged the Chinese
freighter Hong Qi No. 158 was
"frantically bombed" by U.S.
planes at Cam Pha Wednesday
morning.
"It is by no means acciden
tal," said the statement, "that
in less than two months U.S.
pirate aircraft should have twice
in succession brazenly carried
out bombing attacks on Chinese
freighters flying the national
flag of the People's Republic of
Communist China."
The statement charged the at

tacks on the Chinese freighters
were "a vain attempt to disrupt
Sino-ietnamese trade links and
prevent the Chinese people from
giving assistance to the Viet
namese people, thereby to
achieve its criminal design of
blockading and isolating Viet
nam.
The statement said the bomb
ing "will only arouse still
greater indignation among the
Chinese people who will even
more staunchly fight shoulder
to shoulder with the fraternal
Vietnamese people to deal heav
ier and heavier blows at U.S.
imperialism until final victorj
it won." The Chinese protest
came after the Soviet Union
filed a formal protest with the
United States against a similar
incident at North Vietnam's ma
jor port of Haiphong last Thurs
day.
In Washington, neither the
State Department nor the Pen
tagon had any immediate com
ment on the Chinese report.
