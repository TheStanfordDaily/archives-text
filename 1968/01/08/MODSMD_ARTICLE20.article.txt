# 80-Team Tourney
## Northwestern Wins Debate 
### 
Northwestern University cap
tured first place in Stanford's
annual Redwood Debate Tourna
ment last Saturday.
Garry Mathiason and David
Zarefsky of Northwestern ar
gued the affirmative side of the
proposition "Resolved: That the
federal government should guar
antee a minimum annual cash
income to all citizens," to win a
5-0 decision over David Siekel
and J. L. Ware of the second
place Houston "A" team.
Third place trophies went to
Whittier College and Wichita
State.
Affirmative teams generally
argued that poverty exists in the
United States, that cash is the
best means of combatting pover
ty, and that because of problems
of state and local options in
adopting federal programs and
the failure of such programs to
eliminate poverty, a federal
"negative income tax" would
present a comparative advan
tage over present systems.
Among other frequently of
fered proposals were suggesting
that the program be adminis
tered under either the Internal
Revenue Service or the Social
Security administration and that
present welfare programs be
eliminated.
Most negative teams presented
evidence that the war on poverty

is being won, or could be won,
under the status quo.
Observers felt that the deci
sion was influenced by North
western's carefully worded
cross-examination. Houston lost
ground in its constructive
speeches by emphasizing minor
points and spending time on ir
relevancies rather than attack
ing the main points of the af
firmative proposal.
Judges for the video-taped fi
nals included professors Arthur
Hastings and Fredel Wiant of
Stanford, Nancy McDermid of
San Francisco State, W. Scott
Nobles of Oregon, and Lucy
Melhuish of California State
College at Fullerton.
Films of the finals will be re
leased by KQED television and
will also be distributed for use
in high school speech classes
and debate workshops.
During the two-day tourna
ment sixty schools from thirty
states participated in more than
270 debates.
"It has grown in three years
into one of the most Important
collegiate debate tournaments in
the country," Prof. Kenneth E.
Mosier, forensics director,
claimed.
Stanford's three home teams
failed to qualify in a prelimi
nary round of the eighty-team
competition. Last year a Stan
ford team lasted into the semi
finals.
