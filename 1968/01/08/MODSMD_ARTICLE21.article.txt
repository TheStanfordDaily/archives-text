# Seeks 100 TA Members
## Union Cites Gains 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Stanford's 50-member gradu
ate student union is continuing
its drive for members and offi
cial university recognition.
Stanford Local 1816 of the
American Federation of Teach
ers has sent a letter to Univer
sity President Wallace Sterling
asking for recognition and coop
eration.
Sterling has thus far acknowl
edged only that the letter is
"under consideration."
The union was formed last
September because of "low pay
scales, lack of fringe benefits,
and lack of representation in
University affairs," according to
Andrew Moss, union president
and graduate student in statis
tics.
Two teaching assistant (TA)
salary increases since Septem

ber are being credited to the
union's presence on campus by
union leaders.
Moss claims that the fledg
ling union is indirectly respon
sible for a $200 general in
crease to $2300 for some TAs
and a doubling of salary for
Music 1 TAs from $700 to
$1400.
Moss, who has set a goal of
100 members for winter quarter,
has called a meeting for union
members and interested gradu
ate students Thursday at 7:30
p.m. in Tresidder Union.
Plans for the meeting include
a progress report, continued dis
cussion on a proposed policy
statement, and possible topics
of discussion for a meeting with
university officials.
In the letter to Sterlir\g, Moss
asked that "the university recog
nize us as an interest group. We
suggest that representatives of
the university meet with union
members to discuss our position
early in January."
There has been no official re
sponse from the president's of
fice. "We don't exist from the
university's point of view," Moss
said. "We do know, however,
that they don't like the idea of
a union on campus."
Full-time TAs earn $2300 per
year and 20 units of free tui
tion for 20 hours of work per
week. Specific work require
ments vary from department to
department, however.
Moss says that TAs and re
search assistants were in line
for a $400 raise last year, but
that it was one of the first bud
get items cut by the Board of
Trustees last spring.
The raise gained by the three
Music 1 TAs is similar, accord
ing to Moss. Earlier in the year,
the TAs were being paid one

third of the normal TA salary,
which amounted to $700 per year
with nine units of tuition paid
for about seven hours of week
ly work.
"The TAs went to the rest
of the departmental TAs for
support, since they felt they
were grossly underpaid for
the amount of work they were
required to do," Moss said.
Moss reported that the nine
TAs came to the union for sup
port. All nine joined the union.
"They would not have done it
without our support. We gave
them information, procedures,
views on negotiations, and back
up strength."
With the union's aid, the mu
sic TAs conducted a survey and
determined that they were re
quired to do 19% hours of work
weekly, while being paid for
only seven.
The department later modi
fied their estimate to 13% hours
of work, and increased their
wages to a two-thirds TA sal
ary, $1400.
Moss hopes that "other peo
ple will take similar action.
The union should serve as a
focus and clearing house for
organization and Information."
Policy discussions at a meet
ing last month centered around
whether the union should con
centrate only on affairs concern
ing TAs and RAs or become a
politically active voice.
Although no vote has been
taken, the members seem to lean
toward the latter. The union
adopted a resolution supporting
those facing disciplinary action
for anti-CIA demonstrations last
quarter. In addition, Moss said
union members are looking into
the possibility of joining the po
litically active Santa Clara La
bor Council.

Moss reported that the nine
TAs came to the union for sup
port. All nine joined the union.
"They would not have done it
without our support. We gave
them information, procedures,
views on negotiations, and back
up strength."
With the union's aid, the mu
sic TAs conducted a survey and
determined that they were re
quired to do 19% hours of work
weekly, while being paid for
only seven.
The department later modi
fied their estimate to 13% hours
of work, and increased their
wages to a two-thirds TA sal
ary, $1400.
Moss hopes that "other peo
ple will take similar action.
The union should serve as a
focus and clearing house for
organization and Information."
Policy discussions at a meet
ing last month centered around
whether the union should con
centrate only on affairs concern
ing TAs and RAs or become a
politically active voice.
Although no vote has been
taken, the members seem to lean
toward the latter. The union
adopted a resolution supporting
those facing disciplinary action
for anti-CIA demonstrations last
quarter. In addition, Moss said
union members are looking into
the possibility of joining the po

Stanford's 50-member gradu
ate student union is continuing
its drive for members and offi
cial university recognition.
Stanford Local 1816 of the
American Federation of Teach
ers has sent a letter to Univer
sity President Wallace Sterling
asking for recognition and coop
eration.
Sterling has thus far acknowl
edged only that the letter is
"under consideration."
The union was formed last
September because of "low pay
scales, lack of fringe benefits,
and lack of representation in
University affairs," according to
Andrew Moss, union president
and graduate student in statis
tics.
Two teaching assistant (TA)
salary increases since Septem

ber are being credited to the
union's presence on campus by
union leaders.
Moss claims that the fledg
ling union is indirectly respon
sible for a $200 general in
crease to $2300 for some TAs
and a doubling of salary for
Music 1 TAs from $700 to
$1400.
Moss, who has set a goal of
100 members for winter quarter,
has called a meeting for union
members and interested gradu
ate students Thursday at 7:30
p.m. in Tresidder Union.
Plans for the meeting include
a progress report, continued dis
cussion on a proposed policy
statement, and possible topics
of discussion for a meeting with
university officials.
In the letter to Sterlir\g, Moss
asked that "the university recog
nize us as an interest group. We
suggest that representatives of
the university meet with union
members to discuss our position
early in January."
There has been no official re
sponse from the president's of
fice. "We don't exist from the
university's point of view," Moss
said. "We do know, however,
that they don't like the idea of
a union on campus."
Full-time TAs earn $2300 per
year and 20 units of free tui
tion for 20 hours of work per
week. Specific work require
ments vary from department to
department, however.
Moss says that TAs and re
search assistants were in line
for a $400 raise last year, but
that it was one of the first bud
get items cut by the Board of
Trustees last spring.
The raise gained by the three
Music 1 TAs is similar, accord
ing to Moss. Earlier in the year,
the TAs were being paid one

third of the normal TA salary,
which amounted to $700 per year
with nine units of tuition paid
for about seven hours of week
ly work.
"The TAs went to the rest
of the departmental TAs for
support, since they felt they
were grossly underpaid for
