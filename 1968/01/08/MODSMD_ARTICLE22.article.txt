### 
William Bascom, the mining
engineer who directed the first
phase of the Mohole Project to
drill through the earth's crust,
will be the first speaker today
in the 1968 Earth Sciences Lec
ture series.
He will discuss "Undersea
Mining, 1968" in Room 320 of
the Geology corner. The lec
tures are open to the public free
of charge.
In 1961, Bascom and his asso
ciates, using revolutionary new
techniques, drilled test holes
more than 500 feet deep into the
ocean floor off Southern Cali
fornia from a floating platform
over two miles of water —10
times the depth over which any
offshore oil drilling had been
done successfully.
Author of numerous articles
on ocean drilling, waves, and
beaches, Bascom was a U.S.
delegate to the 1957-58 Interna
tional Geophysical Year (IGY)
conferences on oceanography
and atmospheric radioactivity.
