# Revamped Freshman English Considered By Department
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The English department is
considering an experimental,
two-quarter "thematic" course
which next year's freshmen
could take instead of the regu
lar three-quarter Freshman En
glish series.
Some sentiment in the depart
ment favors eventually ending
the requirement that all fresh
men take English 1, 2 and 3.
The proposed new courses
would each have a top professor
lecture about 75 students on a
particular theme, such as "Lit
erature and Technology." The
class would break up into
smaller sections or tutorials for
special instruction in writing.
Three such courses are en
visioned for next year. "We
want to see how it works," com
mented Prof. Robert M. Pol
hemus, director of Freshman
English.
If approved by the English
faculty and the General Studies
committee of the Academic
Council, the "pilot program"
will be offered next autumn.
Each of the three quarters of
Freshman English now carries
three units of credit. The pro
opsed courses would carry five
units each.
Freshman English should be
"radically restructured" in this
way, according to Polhemus, be
cause both faculty and students
want "fiirst-year thematic Eng
lish courses . . . with recogniz
able subject matter."
Presently, Freshman English
is taught in 53 sections, mostly
by teaching assistants. Some
books are read by all the sec
tions, but teachers are free to
decide the rest of the readings
for their section.

In a report to the English
faculty, Polhemus said the the
matic lecture courses would
probably be superior to the pres
ent set-up due to:
• "The near impossibility of
administering a 'single' college
course for 1,200 students and 40
or 50 teachers."
• "The inevitable unevenness
of the present program."
• "A conviction that break
ing the course up into several
courses will mean more mutu
ally beneficial contact and co
operation between regular fac
ulty members and teaching as
sistants than is now possible."
• Staff shortages.
• Greater contact between
freshmen and regular faculty.
Waits For SES Action
"We want to wait and see

what proposals the Study of
Education (SES) makes for
changing general studies re
quirements," Moser said. "It
would be very unwise to com
pletely change Freshman En
glish until we know what other
changes will be made in the
freshman year."
Moser expalined that Fresh
man English can not be made
optional, instead of required,
until other general studies re
quirements are lifted—Western
Civilization, mathematics or lan
guage, and the striA require
ments for engineering majors.
"If everything else was re
quired, but Freshman English
was just 'recommended,' stu
dents would have a tendency to
overlook it," Moser said. "But
if the whole freshman year was
wide open, then it's highly
likely Freshman English won't
be required."
Some English faculty oppose
eliminating the requirement of
Freshman English. "I was sur
prised to see how many of the
young professors are in favor of
an absolute requirement,"
Moser said.
Any major changes in the
Freshman English program
would require the approval of
the Academic Council's General
Studies committee.
Writing Still Stressed
The proposed changes—two
quarters of Freshman English
instead of three; large lectures
as well as small sections, single
subject themes, and an end to
the Freshman English require
ment—don't mean the depart
ment is unconcerned about the
often —criticized quality of stu
dent's writing.
