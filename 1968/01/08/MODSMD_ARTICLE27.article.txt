# 'Guess Who's Coming To Dinner'
## Film Both Success, Failure 
### DAVID LEVINTHAL 
Guess Who's Coming to Din
ner, directed by Stanley Kramer
and starring Spencer Tracy,
Katherine Hepburn, Sidney Poit
ler, and Katherine Houghton, is
an attempt to deal with interra
cial marriage. The film is both
a success and a failure, for
Kramer accomplished most of
what he attempted to do with
the film, and yet the movie is a
very poor and trite statement.
The movie tells of Miss Hough
ton and Mr. Poitier's problems
in trying to convince their par
ents to approve the couple's mar
riage. It premiered at Stanford
Thursday.
In a sense, however, the film
is not about interracial marriage
at all, for Poitier is cast as a
famous doctor with a completely
white set of values.
Kramer stated that he ideal
ized the situation in order to
show a happy ending was pos
sible, and that the film, while
not as bold as it could be, was
still a step forward, perhaps as
far a step as the public could
tolerate.
All Kramer has really done
is to put onto the screen a
scene that some people might
not wish to see (that of Poitier
and Houghton as lovers) and
says nothing but leaves every
one happy.
Meaning in this film is given
to the audience in the form of
several monologues by Tracy,
and a few lines by the maid. The

movie has been made to make
money, like any Hollywood pro
duction, therefore it cannot of
fend the white middle class that
is going to pay to see it.
The film tells how wonderful
it would be if there were more
Poitiers and Houghtons, and
Poitier even says at the conclu
sion of the film, that his father's
problem is that he sees himself
as a Negro and that Poitier sees
himself as a man.
The movie must be looked at
in two ways. First, as a social
statement, and secondly from a
technical point of view. As a
movie relating to our times,
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,
does have some redeeming qual
ities.
Kramer has made this film
available to the public and thus
this minor piece of racial hap
piness may go much farther
than a more realistic or proble
matic film.
Technically the film is a dis
aster. Kramer stated at a semi
nar the following day that the
film was made for the writers,
and that the actors were given
a chance for personal interpreta

tion while the director simply
let many things happen. This
might have succeeded had not
the script been so poor in qual
ity and style.
What one saw was a play on
film, with contrived entrances
and exits that failed to take ad
vantage of the mobility of a
canera. The stage-like effect car
ried over to the photography
which made the background look
like cardboard props.
Kramer has also allowed sev
eral inappropriate scenes to
further mar the film, including
two ridiculous attempts to in
clude teenagers in some movie
shots, and an unbearable se
quence in a local nightclub.
All in all, Guess Who's Com
ing to Dinner might raise a few
questions and maybe even an
eyebrow or two. But that is no
excuse for the debacle that oc
curs on the screen. One could al
most buy the over-sentimentaliz
ing, the shallow acting, the rath
er worn lines and other unex
cusable faults if one received
something more tangible than
the hope that this film has made
a step forward.
