# Fan Speed Is Important
## 
### 
Proper fan speed is an im
portant factor in helping to keep
the engine from overheating,
according to the California State
Automobile Association. One
way to increase fan speed on
mountaineous roads is to shift
to a lower gear ratio when the
automobile begins to overheat.
It Is also important that the fan
belt be checked for adjustment
so as to avoid slippage.
