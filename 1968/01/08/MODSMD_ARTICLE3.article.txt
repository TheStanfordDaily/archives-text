# Stanford Prof Backs Coffin
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Robert McAfee Brown, profes
sor of religion at Stanford, said
Saturday he should be indicted
on the same grounds as Dr. Ben
jamin Spock, Yale Chaplain Wil
liam Sloan Coffin, and three
others cited last Friday for en
couraging draft evasion.
"If he is guilty in the sight of
the law, I too am guilty, along
with many others," Brown said,
referring to Coffin, whose opin
ions on the draft are similar to
Brown's.
He voiced support for those
indicted and attacked the gov
ernment's action, saying, "If in
order to defend our foreign pol
icy we have to indict men of
this caliber, this is a rather
sorry commentary on the state
of this nation."
Also included in the group
cited are Marcus Raskin, co-di
rector of the Institute for Policy
Studies in Washington and
former White House aide; Mich
ell Goodman, an author and
teacher; and Michael Ferber, a
graduate student at Harvard.
Goodman taught English at
Stanford last year. He was one
of 50 persons who walked out of
the National Book Award cere
monies last March during a
speech by Vice President Hum
phrey, as a protest against the
Vietnam war.
Goodman noted that "one of
the specific instances that is
cited in connection with Coffin
was his participation in a ser
vice in a Boston church at which
draft cards were turned in, and
then forwarded to (Selective
Service System Director Gen.
Lewis B.) Hershey's office."
If this were a criterion for in
dictment, Brown said, then he
is liable.
Brown led a service on the
steps of the Federal Building in
San Francisco Dec. 4, similar to
the one in Boston, at which he
gave a sermon and invited thosr*
present to come forward and
place their draft cards in an
offering plate, for forwarding to
Gen. Hershey.
Spock, Coffin, and Goodman,
along with Brown, were signers
of a manifesto entitled "A Cadi
to Resist Illegitimate Authority,"
in which they pledged to raise
funds to aid youths who resist
the draft.

The statement, which apppear
ed last fall, was signed by 320
professional men and others.
Won't Hinder Movement
Brown feels that the move
will not hinder the anti-war
movement, even though this
may have been the government's
intent.
"We do not intend to repu
diate our commitment to men
of draft age, who in conscience
have no other choice than to
break the law, just because the
price may now be higher,"
Brown said.
"If the government felt it was
going to Intimidate people who
have these concerns it will have
made a grave miscalculation,"
he continued. "I think it will turn
out to have been a classic blund
er."
Brown also questioned the con
stitutionality of the law under
which the five were indicted,
which prohibits "counselling, aid
ing, ahd abetting" people to
evade the draft.
Infringes Free Speech
"There are many of us who
feel that the notion that one is
not entitled to counsel another
person is an infringement of the
rights of free speech," he said.
"It is part of that which a cler
gyman or a professor is called
upon to do all the time."
Calling the law "astonishing,"
Brown said that the one benefit
that would come out of the in
dictments would be testing the
law's constitutionality in court.
"It is our feeling that our ac
tions are perfectly legal and It is
the law itself which will be found
to be in violation of the consti
tution rather than our acts," he
asserted.
Brown feels that Coffin will
make the best spokesman for
the movement.
Articulate And Well-Informed
"There is no more articulate,
well-informed individual on the
American scene on these issues
than Bill Coffin," he stated. "He
will be an immensely effective
person to carry the brunt of this
whole kind of concern both in
the press and in the courts."
As for his own situation,
Brown is uncertain.
"The next move there is clear
ly the government's, and they
aren't talking yet," he said. "It
would seem to me that If they
are going to be consistent they
will have to engage in massive
indictments of other people
who've been engaged in the same
kind of activities," as those al
ready cited.
Brown wrote an article in
Look magazine last October
which said he would aid in any
way he could a young man who
had made up his mind to avoid
the draft.
Brown is now organizing a
statement in support of the five
indicted men, with the aid of
Stanford faculty Charles Drek
meier, Michael Novak, George
Leppert, Charles Stein, John
Gurley, Hadley Kirkman and
Robert Spitzer. Brown has ask
ed Stanford faculty interested
in signing such a statement to
contact one of the organizers.
Meanwhile, the government
move drew praise from some
sources. Gen. Hershey said, "I
think the Department of Justice
has done a fine job in getting
them indicted, and it's a job that
ought to be done."

NEXT FOR ARREST? Prof. Robert McAfee Brown of Stanford
said yesterday he has advocated opposition to the draft in the same
ways as the Ave men indicted last week.
Robert McAfee Brown, profes
sor of religion at Stanford, said
Saturday he should be indicted
on the same grounds as Dr. Ben
jamin Spock, Yale Chaplain Wil
liam Sloan Coffin, and three
others cited last Friday for en
couraging draft evasion.
"If he is guilty in the sight of
the law, I too am guilty, along
with many others," Brown said,
referring to Coffin, whose opin
ions on the draft are similar to
Brown's.
He voiced support for those
indicted and attacked the gov
ernment's action, saying, "If in
order to defend our foreign pol
icy we have to indict men of
this caliber, this is a rather
sorry commentary on the state
of this nation."
Also included in the group
cited are Marcus Raskin, co-di
rector of the Institute for Policy
Studies in Washington and
former White House aide; Mich
ell Goodman, an author and
teacher; and Michael Ferber, a
graduate student at Harvard.
Goodman taught English at
Stanford last year. He was one
of 50 persons who walked out of
the National Book Award cere
monies last March during a
speech by Vice President Hum
phrey, as a protest against the
Vietnam war.
Goodman noted that "one of
the specific instances that is
cited in connection with Coffin
was his participation in a ser
vice in a Boston church at which
draft cards were turned in, and
then forwarded to (Selective
Service System Director Gen.
Lewis B.) Hershey's office."
If this were a criterion for in
dictment, Brown said, then he
is liable.
Brown led a service on the
steps of the Federal Building in
San Francisco Dec. 4, similar to
the one in Boston, at which he
gave a sermon and invited thosr*
present to come forward and
place their draft cards in an
offering plate, for forwarding to
Gen. Hershey.
Spock, Coffin, and Goodman,
along with Brown, were signers
of a manifesto entitled "A Cadi
to Resist Illegitimate Authority,"
in which they pledged to raise
funds to aid youths who resist
the draft.

The statement, which apppear
ed last fall, was signed by 320
professional men and others.
Won't Hinder Movement
Brown feels that the move
will not hinder the anti-war
movement, even though this
may have been the government's
intent.
"We do not intend to repu
diate our commitment to men
of draft age, who in conscience
have no other choice than to
break the law, just because the
price may now be higher,"
Brown said.
"If the government felt it was
going to Intimidate people who
have these concerns it will have
made a grave miscalculation,"
he continued. "I think it will turn
out to have been a classic blund
er."
Brown also questioned the con
stitutionality of the law under
which the five were indicted,
which prohibits "counselling, aid
ing, ahd abetting" people to
evade the draft.
Infringes Free Speech
"There are many of us who
feel that the notion that one is
not entitled to counsel another
person is an infringement of the
rights of free speech," he said.
"It is part of that which a cler
gyman or a professor is called
upon to do all the time."
Calling the law "astonishing,"
Brown said that the one benefit
that would come out of the in
dictments would be testing the
law's constitutionality in court.
"It is our feeling that our ac
tions are perfectly legal and It is
the law itself which will be found
to be in violation of the consti
tution rather than our acts," he
asserted.
Brown feels that Coffin will
make the best spokesman for
the movement.
Articulate And Well-Informed
"There is no more articulate,
well-informed individual on the
American scene on these issues
than Bill Coffin," he stated. "He
will be an immensely effective
person to carry the brunt of this
whole kind of concern both in
the press and in the courts."
As for his own situation,
Brown is uncertain.
"The next move there is clear
ly the government's, and they
aren't talking yet," he said. "It
would seem to me that If they
are going to be consistent they
will have to engage in massive
indictments of other people
who've been engaged in the same
kind of activities," as those al
ready cited.
Brown wrote an article in
Look magazine last October
which said he would aid in any
way he could a young man who
had made up his mind to avoid
the draft.

than Bill Coffin," he stated. "He
will be an immensely effective
person to carry the brunt of this
whole kind of concern both in
the press and in the courts."
As for his own situation,
Brown is uncertain.
"The next move there is clear
ly the government's, and they
aren't talking yet," he said. "It
would seem to me that If they
are going to be consistent they
will have to engage in massive
indictments of other people
who've been engaged in the same
kind of activities," as those al
ready cited.
Brown wrote an article in
Look magazine last October
which said he would aid in any
way he could a young man who
had made up his mind to avoid
the draft.
Brown is now organizing a
statement in support of the five
indicted men, with the aid of
Stanford faculty Charles Drek
meier, Michael Novak, George
Leppert, Charles Stein, John
Gurley, Hadley Kirkman and
Robert Spitzer. Brown has ask
ed Stanford faculty interested
in signing such a statement to
contact one of the organizers.
Meanwhile, the government
move drew praise from some
sources. Gen. Hershey said, "I
think the Department of Justice
has done a fine job in getting
them indicted, and it's a job that
ought to be done."

NEXT FOR ARREST? Prof. Robert McAfee Brown of Stanford
said yesterday he has advocated opposition to the draft in the same
ways as the Ave men indicted last week.
Robert McAfee Brown, profes
sor of religion at Stanford, said
Saturday he should be indicted
on the same grounds as Dr. Ben
jamin Spock, Yale Chaplain Wil
liam Sloan Coffin, and three
others cited last Friday for en
couraging draft evasion.
"If he is guilty in the sight of
the law, I too am guilty, along
with many others," Brown said,
referring to Coffin, whose opin
ions on the draft are similar to
Brown's.
He voiced support for those
indicted and attacked the gov
ernment's action, saying, "If in
order to defend our foreign pol
icy we have to indict men of
this caliber, this is a rather
sorry commentary on the state
of this nation."
Also included in the group
cited are Marcus Raskin, co-di
rector of the Institute for Policy
Studies in Washington and
former White House aide; Mich
ell Goodman, an author and
teacher; and Michael Ferber, a
graduate student at Harvard.
Goodman taught English at
Stanford last year. He was one
of 50 persons who walked out of
the National Book Award cere
monies last March during a
speech by Vice President Hum
phrey, as a protest against the
Vietnam war.
Goodman noted that "one of
the specific instances that is
cited in connection with Coffin
was his participation in a ser
vice in a Boston church at which
draft cards were turned in, and
then forwarded to (Selective
Service System Director Gen.
Lewis B.) Hershey's office."
If this were a criterion for in
dictment, Brown said, then he
is liable.
Brown led a service on the
steps of the Federal Building in
San Francisco Dec. 4, similar to
the one in Boston, at which he
gave a sermon and invited thosr*
present to come forward and
place their draft cards in an
offering plate, for forwarding to
Gen. Hershey.
Spock, Coffin, and Goodman,
along with Brown, were signers
of a manifesto entitled "A Cadi
to Resist Illegitimate Authority,"
in which they pledged to raise
funds to aid youths who resist
the draft.

The statement, which apppear
ed last fall, was signed by 320
professional men and others.
Won't Hinder Movement
Brown feels that the move
will not hinder the anti-war
movement, even though this
may have been the government's
intent.
"We do not intend to repu
diate our commitment to men
of draft age, who in conscience
have no other choice than to
break the law, just because the
price may now be higher,"
Brown said.
"If the government felt it was
going to Intimidate people who
have these concerns it will have
made a grave miscalculation,"
he continued. "I think it will turn
out to have been a classic blund
er."
Brown also questioned the con
stitutionality of the law under
which the five were indicted,
which prohibits "counselling, aid
ing, ahd abetting" people to
evade the draft.
Infringes Free Speech
"There are many of us who
feel that the notion that one is
not entitled to counsel another
person is an infringement of the
rights of free speech," he said.
"It is part of that which a cler
gyman or a professor is called
upon to do all the time."
Calling the law "astonishing,"
Brown said that the one benefit
that would come out of the in
dictments would be testing the
law's constitutionality in court.
"It is our feeling that our ac
tions are perfectly legal and It is
the law itself which will be found
to be in violation of the consti
tution rather than our acts," he
asserted.
Brown feels that Coffin will
make the best spokesman for
the movement.
Articulate And Well-Informed
"There is no more articulate,
well-informed individual on the
American scene on these issues
than Bill Coffin," he stated. "He
will be an immensely effective
person to carry the brunt of this
whole kind of concern both in
the press and in the courts."
