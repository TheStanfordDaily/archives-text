### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The
man fired this year from the
University of California presi
dency by the UC Regents says
the university is no sufficiently
protected from "political inter
ference."
Clark Kerr said in a recent
interview that the state Consti
tution should be revised to re
move popularly elected office
holders from the Board of Re
gents.
Kerr, fired Jan. 20 after his
lauding of student unrest at
the Berkeley campus became a
major issue, proposed that the
governor, lieutenant governor,
speaker of the Assembly and the
superintendent of public instruc
tion be removed form the board.
"They can't possibly divorce
themselves as regents from their
political positions," said Kerr.
