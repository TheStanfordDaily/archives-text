## 
### 
Twenty-six professors nation
wide, including four Stanford
faculty members, have attacked
the recent pronouncement by 14
other scholars that a Commu
nist victory in Vietnam will lead
to further wars.
Gabriel Almond, professor of
political science, Mark Mancall,
assistant professor of history,
G. Williams Skinner, professor
of anthropology, and Sidney
Verba, professor of political sci
ence, signed the statement re
leased Saturday.
The statement discounted the
original pronuncement as "arti
ficially structuring" the debate
concerning the war by "indis
criminately attacking" all critics
of the conflict by accusing them
of being extremists.
"Nothing in their (the four
teen scholars') statement con
flicts with the basic tenets of the
Johnson Administration's poli
cies in Southeast Asia, and we
would not describe those poli
cies as moderate," stated the
signers.
The statement was released in
Ithaca, New York and also in
cluded signers from the Univer
sity of California, Harvard,
Yale, and Colombia.
