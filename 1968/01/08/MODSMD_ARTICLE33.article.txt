# Tax On Tourists Likely, Travel Ban Chances Dim
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—Amer
icans will still be free to travel
overseas under the administra
tion's new program to end the
dollar drain but it could' cost
them more money.
The administration is leaning
away from any outright bans or
legal restrictions on travel
abroad and will concentrate in
stead on discouraging travel out
side the hemisphere, most likely
through a tourist tax of some
sort, according to authorities
here.
This course seemed likely to
follow a New Year's day an
nouncement by President John
son of an austerity program to
end the dollar drain which one
official described as a "go for
broke" plan.
Secretary of the Treasury
Henry H. Fowler, in explaining
the factors which led to the cut
backs and proposed cutbacks in
spending abroad, listed British
devaluation as the immediate
but not the only cause.
Devaluation, he explained, was
much like a cyclone which
knocked down some buildings
and left those still standing a bit
shaky.
It only heightened the pres
sure to end the outflow of dol
lars which has plagued the na
tion since 1950, he said. Devalu
ation, he said, provided "a real
opportunity to go for broke" in
dealing with the problem.
He declined to spell out any of
the measures which might be
taken to discourage overseas
travel until he discusses the
question with Congress. He has
said the whole range of alterna
tives will be considered.

State Department officials Sun
day added some kindling to the
heated tourism controversy
when they revealed more Amer
icans than ever were issued pass
ports in 1967.
An estimated 1,690,000 pass
ports—an 11 per cent increase
over 1966—taken out in 1967,
raising the total number of valid
passports to 4,500,000.
The latest passport figures in

dicate also a much higher rate
of increase in passports issued
for travel by government offi
cials than for the public general
ly-
The number of official pass
ports—those used mainly by
executive branch employees and
congressmen on junkets — rose
to approximately 143,500 in 1967
—a 26.6 per cent increase during
the year.

WASHINGTON (AP)—Amer
icans will still be free to travel
overseas under the administra
tion's new program to end the
dollar drain but it could' cost
them more money.
The administration is leaning
away from any outright bans or
legal restrictions on travel
abroad and will concentrate in
stead on discouraging travel out
side the hemisphere, most likely
through a tourist tax of some
sort, according to authorities
here.
This course seemed likely to
follow a New Year's day an
nouncement by President John
son of an austerity program to
end the dollar drain which one
official described as a "go for
broke" plan.
Secretary of the Treasury
Henry H. Fowler, in explaining
the factors which led to the cut
backs and proposed cutbacks in
spending abroad, listed British
devaluation as the immediate
but not the only cause.
Devaluation, he explained, was
much like a cyclone which
knocked down some buildings
and left those still standing a bit
shaky.
It only heightened the pres
sure to end the outflow of dol
lars which has plagued the na
tion since 1950, he said. Devalu
ation, he said, provided "a real
opportunity to go for broke" in
dealing with the problem.
He declined to spell out any of
the measures which might be
taken to discourage overseas
travel until he discusses the
question with Congress. He has
said the whole range of alterna
tives will be considered.

State Department officials Sun
day added some kindling to the
heated tourism controversy
when they revealed more Amer
icans than ever were issued pass
ports in 1967.
