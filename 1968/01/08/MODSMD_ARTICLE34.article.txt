## 
### 
AP News Analysis
On the approach to his meet
ing this week with Ambassador
Chester Bowles in Phnom Penh,
Prince Norodom Sihanouk of
Cambodia has ruled himself out
as a go-between with Hanoi and
Peking but has left himself wide
maneuvering space on the Viet
nam problem.
And the 45-year-old chief of
state has some preliminary ad
vice for the United States: 1.
Stop bombing North Vietnam
and 2. Try dealing directly with
the Communist Viet Cong in
South Vietnam.
Under present circumstances,
1. The United States is likely to
consider a bombing cessation on
condition that it will lead to
even the slimmest preliminaries
for ending the Vietnam war and
2. The United States is most un
likely to buddy up to the Viet
Cong in any way—especially in
any way suggesting it repre

sented anything in South Viet
nam beyond a Communist guer
rilla force.
The Sihanouk-Bowles meeting
was set up specifically to discuss
rights of Americans to go into
Cambodia in hot pursuit of Viet
Cong taking refuge there from
battle, but the conference may
range well beyond that.
The meeting starts in the
Cambodian capital probably
Tuesday as a unique sort of
confrontation between represent
atives of two nations that have
no mutual diplomatic relations
but have remained on speaking
terms.
