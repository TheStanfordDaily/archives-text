1968: ITS CAUSE AND CURE
Are you still writing"l967"on your papers and letters?
I'll bet you are, you scamp! But I am not one to be harsh
with those who forgot we are in a new year, for I myself
have long been guilty of the same lapse. In fact, in my
senior year at college, I wrote 1873 on my papers until
nearly November of 1874! (It turned out, incidentally,
not to be such a serious error because, as we all know, 1874
was later repealed by President Chester A. Arthur in a fit
of pique over the Black Tom Explosion. And, as we all
know, Mr. Arthur later came to regret his hasty action.
Who does not recall that famous meeting between Mr.
Arthur and Louis Napoleon when Mr. Arthur said, "Lou,
I wish I hadn't of repealed 1874" Whereupon the French
emperor made his immortal rejoinder, "Tipi que nous et
tyler tu". Well sir, they had many a good laugh about that,
as you can imagine.)
But I digress. How can we remember to write 1968 on
our papers and letters? Well sir, the best way is to find
something memorable about 1968, something unique to fix
it firmly in your mind. Happily, this is very simple be
cause, as we all know, 1968 is the first year in history that
is divisible by 2, by 5, and by 7. Take a pencil and try it:
1968 divided by 2 is 984; 1968 divided by 5 is 393%; 1968
divided by 7 is 281V7. This mathematical curiosity will not
occuragain until the year 2079, but we will all be so busy
then celebrating the Chester A. Arthur bi-centenerary
that we will scarcely have time to be writing papers and
letters and like that.

Another clever little trick to fix the year 1968 in your
mind is to remember that 1968 spelled backwards is 8691.
"Year" spelled backwards is "raey!' "Personna" spelled
backwards is "Annosrep." I mention Personna because I
am paid to write this column by the makers of Personna
Super Stainless Steel Blades, and they are inclined to
withhold my check if I omit to mention their product.
Not, mind you, that it is any chore for me to sing the
praises of Personna, for it is a seemly blade that shaves
you cleanly, a gleaming blade that leaves you beaming, a
trouble-free blade that leaves you stubble-free, a match
less blade that leaves you scratchless. If you are tired of
facial slump, if you are fed up with jowl blight, try
Personna today... available both in double-edge style and
Injector style. And if I seem a bit excessive in my admira
tion for Personna, I ask you to remember that to me
Personna is more than a razor blade; it is also an employer.
But I digress. We were speaking of the memorable as
pects of 1968 and high among them, of course, is the fact
that in 1968 the entire House of Representatives stands
for election. There will, no doubt, be many lively and inter
esting contests, but none, I'll wager, quite so lively and
interesting as the one in my own district where the lead
ing candidate is none other than Chester A. Arthur!
Mr. Arthur, incidentally, is not the first ex-president to
come out of retirement and run for the House of Repre
sentatives. John Quincy Adams was the first. Mr. Adams
also holds another distinction: he was the first son of a
president ever to serve as president. It is true that Martin
Van Buren's son, Walter "Blinky" Van Buren, was at one
time offered the nomination for the presidency, but he,
alas, had already accepted a bid to become Mad Ludwig
of Bavaria. James K. Polk's son, on the other hand, be
came Salmon P. Chase. Millard Fillmore's son went into
aluminum siding. This later became known as the Mis
souri Compromise.

In Missouri, or anywhere else, there is no compromise
with quality in Personna or in Personna's partner in
shaving pleasure — Hurma-Shave. Burma-Shave comes
to you in regular or menthol. Try it. You'll find it soaks
rings around any other lather.
