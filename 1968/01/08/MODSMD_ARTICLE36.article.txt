# Block First-Ballot Blitz
## Favorite Sons In Control 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Po
tential favorite sons from 15
states may have nearly half the
delegates committed to them
and could prevent any candidate
from blitzing the Republican na
tional convention as Barry Gold
water did in 1964.
The 15 states where there have
been significant indications of
favorite-son movements will
have 642 votes at the Miami
Beach convention. With 667
needed to nominate, few politi
cians believe any candidate is

likely to come close enough to
start a first-ballot stampede.
Developments of the next sev
en months of campaignship pri
maries and state conventions
could change the convention's
complexion. But as matters
stand, there is a possibility the
convention will choose a nomi
nee who hasn't campaigned op
enly for the job.
If the favorite sons hold out
in the early balloting, it is con
ceivable that one of their num
ber — Gov. Nelson A. Rockefel

ler of New York and Gov. Ron
ald Reagan of California, as ex
amples — could wind up with
the nomination to oppose Presi
dent Johnson in the November
election.
However, if former Vice Pres
ident Richard M. Nixon should
sweep the primaries, as current
polls indicate he might, the fa
vorite sons would be under ex
treme bandwagon pressure to re
lease their delegates to him even
before the first ballot.
Gov. James A. Rhodes of Ohio,

latest to make it official that he
will be a fovrite son, did just
that in 1964. He turned his 418-
vote delegation loose and all but
one vote went to Goldwater on
the first ballot.
Son. John Tower, expected to
head the 58-vote Texas contin
gent to the convention, already
has said Nixon is his choice for
the nomination.
New York's Rockefeller and
Rhode Island's Gov. John H.
Chafee are avowed supporters
of Michigan Gov. George Rom
ney. But it seems obvious that
Romney will have to improve
his present low ranking in the
race by primary victories or oth
er developments if he expects to
hold New York's 92 votes and
Rhode Island's 14 even in the
early balloting.
As Illinois's favorite son, Sen.
Charles H. Percy may not have
the final decision on where the
bulk of the state's 58 votes will
go, or when, unless he manufac
tures an upward surge as a po
tential presidential nominee.
Senate Republican Leader Ev
erett M. Dirksen, who put Gold
water's name in nomination in
1964, will have a strong influ
ence with the delegation.
If Sen. Clifford P. Case is the
favorite son of the 40-vote New
Jersey group and Gov. Ray
mond P. Shaffer is the choice of
the 64-vote Pennsylvania dele
gation, they are expected to look
the field over closely before de
ciding on which way to jump.
