# Gallup Gives McCarthy 12%

NEW YORK (AP) â€” If Sen.
Eugene McCarthy, (D-Minn.)
ran as an independent peace
candidate in a four-way presi
dential race, he would get about
12 per cent of the vote, the Gal
lup Poll claimed Sunday.
The poll, in a national test
election, matched McCarthy
against President Johnson; for
mer Vice President Richard M.
Nixon, the Republican front
runner; and former Alabama
Gov. George C. Wallace, a prob
able states rights third-party
candidate.
A national sample of adults
in 310 locations around the
country gave Johnson 39 per
cent of the vote; Nixon 30
per cent; McCarthy 12 per
cent and Wallace 11 per cent.

McCarthy has said that he
does not intend to run as an in
dependent, only to attempt to
wrest the Democratic nomina
tion from the President.
Nevertheless, the poll says,
the results show that a peace
party could expect to attract
about nine million voters, based
on the turnout in the 1964 elec
tion.
The poll attempted to deter
mine the amount of sentiment
nationally for a peace party and
to ascertain how such a candi
date would affect the major par
ties.
The poll also found that Wal
lace's strength remained rela
tively constant, with or without
a peace candidate in the field.

But it found that inclusion
of Wallace in a race with
Johnson and Nixon hurts the
Republicans more than the
Democrats.
When Wallace and McCarthy
were eliminated from the race,
the poll found that Johnson had
a 46 to 41 per cent edge over
Nixon, with 13 per cent unde
cided.
In December, the President
had a 47 to 43 per cent lead
over Nixon, with 10 per cent
undecided.
McCarthy's support was
strongest in the East, where he
got 16 per cent of the vote. The
test election results also showed
that 14 per cent of the women
gave him their votes, compared
to 9 per cent of the men.
