SAIGON (AP) — Communist
forces launched seven heavy
rocket, mortar and ground at
tacks yesterday on U.S. and
South Vietnamese positions in
the critical northernmost prov
inces, including three assaults
on U.S. Marines protecting lib
erated villages.
The stepped-up Communist as
saults in the northern section
also included the shelling of the
Marine Corps supply headquar
ters at Camp Books, four miles
southwest of Da Nang.
The seven attacks left 16
Americans dead and 135 wound
ed. All the casualties were Ma
rines except one soldier who

was killed and another who was
wounded. South Vietnamese cas
ualties were reported as light.
In addition, one civilian was
killed and one was wounded.
The U.S. Command said 91
enemy were killed by allied
forces who repulsed the as
saults, and 16 weapons were cap
tured.
In all, more than 200 enemy
were killed in the northern prov
inces over the weekend, 128 of
them in fighting south of Da
Nang on Saturday.
Mixed Viet Cong-North Viet
namese forces have been con
centrating in the northern zone
since the New Year's cease-fire

ended. U.S. intelligence officers
say a major North Vietnamese
force is poised just above the
demilitarized zone dividing the
two Vietnams.
The Communists also kept
pressure on allied forces farther
south along the Cambodian bor
der, another area where a mas
sive enemy build-up is suspected.
Communist gunners slammed
25 rounds of 122 mm rockets into
Camp Books, destroying 24
small buildings and wounding 50
U.S. Marines. The camp is the
headquarters for all Marine sup
plies in the northern provinces
except ammunition, and is the
largest Marine supply point in
Vietnam.
