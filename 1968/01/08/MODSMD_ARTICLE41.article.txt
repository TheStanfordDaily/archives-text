# The 						Dollar Curbs
## 
### Max Lerner 
At some point the dollar curbs
were bound to come. But who
would have predicted that Presi
dent Johnson, ignoring his own
clear political interests, would
call for imposing them in an
election year? It took some guts
to do, and if it helps the nation
economically — which is the cru
cial question—it may even help
the President politically.
Of the two proposed sets of
curbs, on investments abroad
and on travel, those on travel
are less important in their im
pact on the gold drain, but the
travel curbs are more dramatic
and psychologically important
because they affect more Ameri
cans directly.
It is a sticky thing (as now
proposed in Congress) to tell
free-born Americans that they
can't go to Europe without pay
ing a penalty tax on their tickets
or even a per-diem tax for every
day they spend abroad. But the
free-born Englishman, no less
jealous of his freedom than the
American, has for years been

told how many pounds he is al
lowed to take with him on his
trip. And even the Kennedy Ad
ministration, Europe - oriented
and culture-oriented as it was,
told the traveler he couldn't
bring back more than $100
worth of stuff duty-free. The
real freedom of travel has to
do with liberty of movement,
not with freedom from econom
ic measures when you do move.

What will make many travel
ers feel worse is that in a high
income and high-consumption
economy they have the money,
and they feel sovereign about
deciding how to spend it. The
old Bob Hope line, "Have tux,
will travel," must now be
"Have bus, can't travel."
Doubtlessly it will be hard to
get people to like the travel
curbs, or to enforce them
against various ticket bootleg
ging ruses. But this is one case
where the best enforcement will
be self-enforcement and the best
self-enforcement will be self-re-

straint. If Americans feel it is
crucial to stanch the gold-flow,
especially in the face of De
Gaulle's savage recent campaign
against the American dollar,
then the enforcement problem
will be nothing like it was in the
Prohibition days.
