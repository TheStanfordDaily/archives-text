## How To Handle Gen. de Gaulle 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON —My friend
Zimmerman is a wise man, and
when he speaks I listen. The
other day Zimmerman said the
United States was approaching
the De Gaulle problem from the
wrong direction.
"What exactly do you mean
by that?" I asked him.
"Well, every time De Gaulle
makes a statement or holds a
press conference, we immedi
ately react in rage and disbe
lief."
"As well we might," I said.
"But this is exactly what De
Gaulle wants everybody to do.
He gets his kicks out of getting
everybody mad at him. The
madder we get, the better he
likes it. Don't you understand?
De Gaulle is devoting his last
years to bugging everyone, and
the more we show how upset
we are, the happier we make
him."
'That I can believe," I said.
"But what is the solution, Zim
merman?"
"We must not show that De
Gaulle is getting under our skin.
We must make believe that
everything he advocates makes
sense and is in cur interests as
well as his."
"But how?"
"Let us supose at his press
conference De Gaulle says that
Quebec should be free, and
no longer a part of Canada. The
United States should immedi
ately announce that this is not
only a brilliant idea, but our
military future depends on an
autonomous Quebec. As soon as
De Gaulle hears our reaction

he will drop his Free Quebec
campaign and announce that
Quebec must never be separated
from the Canadian Federation."
"I could see him doing it," I
said.
And The Common Market?
Zimmerman continued. "Now
let us take the Common Market
problem. We know De Gaulle is
against Great Britain becoming
a member because he thinks we
want the British in.
"The thing we must do is
send word to De Gaulle, through
a neutral power, that the great
est fear of the United States is
that France will permit the Brit
ish to become part of the Euro
pean community. We should
urge De Gaulle at all costs to
use his good offices to keep the
British out. We might even send
over Vice President Humphrey
to plead with him to make it
impossible for the British ever
to join."
"When De Gaulle hears this
he will immediately make the
British a partner behind our
backs," I said excitedly.
"You catch on fast," Zimmer
man said. "At the moment, De
Gaulle is making an attack on
the dollar, forcing us to use up
our gold reserves. Suppose we
passed the word to Swiss bank
ers that the United States is
short of dollars and we're pre
tending we have a gold short
age so France will sell us her
dollars."
"De Gaulle will be furious and
use his gold to start buying
back American dollars," I cried.
"Exactly. Now we come to
NATO. At the secretary of de
fense's next press conference,
he should say that the Joint
Chiefs of Staff have concluded
that France has no strategic
value in the defense of Europe,
and it is to our advantage, mili
tarily and economically, that she
no longer be part of NATO."
"I'd like to see De Gaulle's
face when he reads that."
"Our policy should be that no
matter what De Gaulle says,
we must never let on that we've
lost our cool. We should praise

him as a superb statesman, a
magnificent soldier and the
greatest leader of our times."
"In other words, kill him with
kindness," I said.
"Yes. I honestly believe that
if we kept up this approach for
a year, De Gaulle would lose
interest in his role in the world,
and fade away."
"It's a cruel thing we're plot

ting, Zimmerman, but I think
it's worth a try."
