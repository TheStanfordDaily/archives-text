# Cards Swim Past Canadian Champs
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's NCAA champion
swimmers highlighted an easy
going 82-31 victory over Cana
dian collegiate champion Simon
Fraser University with a num
ber of bright early season per
formances.
Pete Siebert stroked to a 2:00.6
in the 200 individual medley, 2
seconds ahead of last year's
progress. Siebert also edged se
nior Mike Wall in the 500 free
at 5:09.6.
Sophomore diver Bill Main ran
away with both diving events.
A new NCAA rule establishes
both 1-meter and 3-meter diving
as regular dual meet entries.
Main racked up 289 points in

the high board competition, one
of the highest totals ever for
a Stanford diver. Main capped
his exhibition with a triple
twisting one-and-a-half somer
sault, considered by some to be
the most difficult dive on the list.
Team captain Bob Momsen
aced his specialty, the 200 breast
stroke, after winning the 200
freestyle in 1:49.8.
Juniors Ken Hammer and JefT
Hammett both turned in sur
prising sprint races for early
January. Hammer hit 47.8 to
anchor the Indians' medley relay
and later won the 100 free in 49.3.
Hammett took the 50 in a snap
py 22.1 and threw in a 48.3
freestyle relay leg.

Sophomore butterflier Jim
Nickoloff carried the 200 fly in
a propitious 2:00.9. Bill Kee led
off the medley relay with a quick
56.1 backstroke leg.
Dick Roth, who earlier joined
Gary Sheerer and several other
Stanford swimmers in sick bay,
came back to carry the 200 back
stroke in 2:04.9.
The Indians swim San Jose
State Friday, 3 p.m., at Stanford
in a prelude to the top dual meet
of the season. At 10:00 a.m. on
Saturday Stanford's power-ta
burn freshmen assault the in
tegrity of an NCAA champion
varsity in what could be a NCAA
freshman and Stanford pool rec
ord derby.
