# NCAA May Quit Olympics
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) —The Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation hinted yesterday that it
may pull out of the U.S. Olym
pic Committee — after this
years Games — and throw its
vast resources into other inter
national competitions, such as
the World Student Games.
"We have bccome only an
appendage on the Olympic Com
mittee," said Bill Reed, com
missioner of the Big Ten Con
ference and chairman of the
NCAA's Olympic Committee.
"The committee is dominated
by a coalition of international
federations. We have virtually
no voice in the conduct of
Olympic affairs. We have inad
equate representation on the

various Games committees. If
we all dropped dead—that is, we
of the NCAA — the Olympic
movement would hardly notice
it."
Reed made his comments at a
press conference in which he
discussed a report made to the
nation's colleges, which open
their annual convention here
Monday.
In the report, Reed said the 17
independent international fed
erations on the Olympic Com
mittee had aligned with the
Amateur Athletic Union and
formed a coalition that has
turned the NCAA into little
more than a figurehead.
"Our strength on the commit
tee represents only about one
third," he said. "It is useless."

The Big Ten commissioner
was quick to explain that this
had no connection with the long
simmering AAU-NCAA feud
and that there was no threat
of a boycott.
"This doesn't mean that col
lege athletes would not continue

representing us in the Olym
pics," he said. "We never would
do anything to hurt the Olympic
movement. It's just a case of
assessing our value and finding
out where our resources—mon
ey, personnel, experience and
facilities—can best be utilized."
