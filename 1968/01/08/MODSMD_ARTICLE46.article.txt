NEW YORK (AP) — The Uni
versity of Southwestern Louisi
ana was placed on two years
probation Sunday by the Nation
al Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion for having permitted finan
cial aid to three prospective
basketball players.
Under the penalty imposed by
the infraction committee, the
basketball team was denied the
right to participate in any post
season activity during the peri
od.
The team currently is ranked
No. 8 in the small college rank
ings and has an 8-3 record for
the season.
Arthur Bergstrom, assistant
executive director of the NCAA,
said this was the only infrac
tions announcement that would
be made at the current conven
tion of the nation's some 600
colleges.
The NCAA said that at the
beginning of the 1966-67 college
year, Southwestern Louisana
permitted an outside organiza
tion to pay the educational ex
penses of three student athletes
to attend the school.
The athletes, only identified
as basketball players, were not
named.
The NCAA announcement add
ed:
"In as much as university
athletic personnel promised fi
nancial assistance to the three
young men and such aid ulti
mately was provided, it is held
that the student athletes in
volved were unaware that the
assistance came from an outside
source."
The NCAA said the recipients
were not provided with a proper
written statement dsecribing the
amount, duration, terms and
conditions of the award.
Further, the NCAA statement
said, the procedures followed in
making these awards placed the
university's department of ath

letics in administrative control
of the financial assistance.
The NCAA council took not<
that once the executive adminis
tration of the university becam
aware of the existence of th
arrangements whereby the ath
letes received financial aid from
outside sources, it ended the
arrangements.
This apparently resulted ii
softening the penalty.
