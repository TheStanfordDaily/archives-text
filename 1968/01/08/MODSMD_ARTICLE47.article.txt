## 
### BOB RUND 
Stanford, led by hot-shooting
Art Harris, started Pacific-8 com
petition Friday be defeating Ore
gon 79-73, but was soundly beat
en Saturday by tall Oregon
State 67-51.
The Indians, already handicap
pod by the loss of center Bill
Palmer, were plagued again with
injury when forward Mai Mc-
Elwain suffered a bad ankle
sprain in the first quarter
against Oregon. Harris, how
ever, more than made up for the
absences on Friday night.
Harris poured in 14 field goals
and made 9 of 11 free throws to
tally 37 points for the game.
This is only two points less than
the previous combined per game
scoring averages of Palmer, Mc-
Elwain, and Harris.
Harris's scoring spree gave

him a three year total of 1,004
points. He now ranks as the
sixth most prolific Indian scorer
of all time.
Chuck Moore, filling in for the
injured McElwain performed re
markably well. Moore, with 13
points, was the only other Tribe
player in double figures.
Bartolome Leads Beavers
The Indians were not as for
tunate against the Beavers of
Oregon State. After a slow start,
Oregon State, led by giant soph
omore Vic Bartolome, poured in
13 straight points and 15 of their
first 18 field goal attempts to
build up a 38-22 lead.
The Beavers averaged 6'-ll"
per man to the Tribe's 6'2" aver
age; but the big difference was
the half-foot center Steve Kuch
enbecher gave up to Bartolome,
and the extra 5 inches sopho

more Gary Freeman had on
Stanford's opposing forwards
which allowed the Beavers to
score almost at will.
Bartolome, a seven footer who
was scheduled to be red-shirted
because he was, "not yet ready,"
looked extremely ready as he
threw in seven of his first 9
shots. He scored 21 for the game,
Harris Held Down
Art Harris, who has been aver
aging more than 20 points per
game, was held to 15. He scored
only two points in the second
half.
Chuck Moore, subbing for McÂ»
Elwain, was in double figures for
the second straight night with
10 points.
Oregon State's Vince Fritz
was the game's second high
er with 17.
