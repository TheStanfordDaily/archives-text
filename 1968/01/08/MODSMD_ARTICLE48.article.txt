MIAMI, Fla. (AP) — Roman
Gabriel passed Los Angeles to a
17-point half time lead Sunday
and the Rams rolled on behind
their "Fearsome Foursome"
front-line defense to a 30-6 vic
tory over the Cleveland Browns
in the Pro Playoff football game.
The tall Ram quarterback
threw 21 yards to Bernie Casey
and two yards to Billy Truax for
touchdowns in the first and sec
ond periods. Bruce Gossett nail
ed field goals from 41 and 46
yards and booted two conver
sions to increase the margin to
20-0 in the third period.
Brown Bush Stalled
A Cleveland rushing attack
which led the NFL never got go
ing until the last quarter, when
the Browns moved 81 yards to
score on a two-yard run by
Leroy Kelly, NFL rushing cham
pion, who played out his option
with Cleveland during the past
season.
The big plays of the drive

were a 34-yard pass from Gary
Lane to Paul Warfield and two
good runs by Kelly.
After that one defensive lapse,
the Rams struck again. Willie
Ellison scored on a nine-yard
run after Gabriel hit Tommy
Mason with a 43-yard aerial.
Then Gossett added his third
field goal — a record for the
game — from 19 yards out, after
Dave Cahill had recovered a
fumble by Lane at the Cleveland
17.
Rams Dominate Early
The first half was all Los An
geles as Gabriel, named th?
game's most valuable player,
moved the Rams 61 and 66 yards
to touchdowns. In the first drive,
he hit Les Josephson with two
passes covering 24 yards, ran
10 yards himself to the 21, then
found Casey for the score.
A 21-yard run by Gabriel on a
fourth - and - inches gamble was
the crucial play of the second
drive.

The game between runners up
in the National Football League
conferences was played in bright
sunshine and 80 degree tempera
ture, 79 degrees warmer than
when the Rams played their last
game at Green Bay. But the at
tendance dropped off sharply to
37,102 from last year's 65,569.
Two factors probably account
ed for the decline in interest.
One was Sunday's big at
traction in the Orange Bowl —
the Super Bowl game between
Green Bay and Oakland. Tho
other was the fact that Cleve
land was slaughtered in its two
oarlier television appearances
this season.
It was the first trip for the
Rams to this game. Cleveland
lost to Detroit in 1961 and to
Green Bay in 1964.
Although the Rams were the

highest scoring team in the NFL,
and its toughest on defense, they
lost the crown to Green Bay 28-7
in the playoffs. Cleveland was
mauled by Dallas 52-14.
Winning shares for the Rams
were $1200 each, while the losing
Browns received $500 for a full
share. The balance of the profits
goes to the player pension fund.
