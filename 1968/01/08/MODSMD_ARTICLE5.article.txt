# Britain To Junk Concorde?

LONDON (AP) — Britain is
ready to scrap the British-French
Concorde supersonic airliner in
a move to cut government spend
ing, the Daily Express reported
Monday.
Defense writer Chapman
Pincher said the cancellation has
the support of Chancellor of the
Exchequer Roy Jenkins. He said
the French could be induced to
agree because they are in finan
cial troubles of their own.
Pincher wrote that Britain
still has $480 million to spend on
Concorde's development. He said

that amount would be diverted
to social services the govern
ment considers essential.
Development of the Concorde
has been estimated at nearly $1.5
billion, about twice the cost proj
ected when the program was
begun in 1962. Britain's share
would be half — $750 million
Model No. 001 of the Concorde
made its first public appearance
at Toulouse, France, a month
ago. Its maiden flight has been
set for Feb. 28.
Airlines have ordered 74 of
the planes, v. liich are planned to

carry up to 132 persons as fast
as 2.2 times the speed of sound,
or about 1,400 miles per hour.
Officials have estimated that
the Concorde would enter air
line service in 1971. The Soviet
Union has announced a similar
plane this year.
An American version, to be
built by the Boeing Co. is at a
less advanced stage of develop
ment.
