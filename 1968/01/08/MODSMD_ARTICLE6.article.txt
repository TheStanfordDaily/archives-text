# Heart Transplant Patient 'Doing Well' Says Doctor
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
The recipient of a transplanted heart—the second in this coun
try —was described yesterday as "doing quite well" by the Stan
ford doctor who led the surgical team.
Dr. Norman E. Shumway of the Stanford Medical school per
formed the operation Saturday on 54-year-old Mike Kasperak a
steelworker who had to retire 18 months ago because of his heart
condition.
The heart's donor, Mrs. Virginia Mae White, a 43-year-old
Santa Clara housewife, had succumbed to a stroke several hours
earlier Saturday.
Speaking at a news conference Sunday afternoon at the Medi
cal Center, Shumway said that Kasperak "is fully conscious and
responding in good style." He added that he has a tube in his
throat to facilitate breathing.
Dr. Donald C. Harrison, head of the division of cardiology at
Stanford and assistant to Shumway in the transplant, added, "He
recognizes commands and recognizes people, his family."
However, "there is no way to term the episode a success,"
Shumway pointed out. "The work is just now beginning. What
will be done in the next several days and weeks in the manage
ment of this patient will determine whether the result is truly
successful."
Kasperak, who moved to East Palo Alto after retiring from
Laughlin Steel Corp. in Cleveland, Ohio, was suffering severe
and irreversible viral myocraditis. This infection had turned his

heart muscle into fibrous tissue
and weakened its pumping ca
pacity.
The Kasperaks were told of
the danger of the operation, but
were also told that Kasperak
could not live much longer with
out such a transplant.
When he told his wife he had
decided to go ahead with the
transplant, she said, "Go ahead,
don't waste any time. I want
you alive and with me." Mrs.
Feme Kasperak described her
husband as a "quiet, easy going,
lovable man with a lot of con
fidence in himself."
The donor and her husband,
high school sweethearts from
Des Moines, lowa, had cele
brated their 22nd wedding anni
versary Thursday night. But on
