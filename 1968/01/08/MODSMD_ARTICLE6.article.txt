# Heart Transplant Patient 'Doing Well' Says Doctor
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
The recipient of a transplanted heart—the second in this coun
try —was described yesterday as "doing quite well" by the Stan
ford doctor who led the surgical team.
Dr. Norman E. Shumway of the Stanford Medical school per
formed the operation Saturday on 54-year-old Mike Kasperak a
steelworker who had to retire 18 months ago because of his heart
condition.
The heart's donor, Mrs. Virginia Mae White, a 43-year-old
Santa Clara housewife, had succumbed to a stroke several hours
earlier Saturday.
Speaking at a news conference Sunday afternoon at the Medi
cal Center, Shumway said that Kasperak "is fully conscious and
responding in good style." He added that he has a tube in his
throat to facilitate breathing.
Dr. Donald C. Harrison, head of the division of cardiology at
Stanford and assistant to Shumway in the transplant, added, "He
recognizes commands and recognizes people, his family."
However, "there is no way to term the episode a success,"
Shumway pointed out. "The work is just now beginning. What
will be done in the next several days and weeks in the manage
ment of this patient will determine whether the result is truly
successful."
Kasperak, who moved to East Palo Alto after retiring from
Laughlin Steel Corp. in Cleveland, Ohio, was suffering severe
and irreversible viral myocraditis. This infection had turned his

heart muscle into fibrous tissue
and weakened its pumping ca
pacity.
The Kasperaks were told of
the danger of the operation, but
were also told that Kasperak
could not live much longer with
out such a transplant.
When he told his wife he had
decided to go ahead with the
transplant, she said, "Go ahead,
don't waste any time. I want
you alive and with me." Mrs.
Feme Kasperak described her
husband as a "quiet, easy going,
lovable man with a lot of con
fidence in himself."
The donor and her husband,
high school sweethearts from
Des Moines, lowa, had cele
brated their 22nd wedding anni
versary Thursday night. But on


HEART OPERATION —The Stanford surgical team, led by Dr.
Norman Shumway, nears the end of their transplant operation at
the Stanford Medical Center Saturday night. The photo, taken by
a member of the surgical team, was released early Monday morn
ing and is the only photo of the operation that will be available.
Friday evening at about 6 p.m.,
Mrs. White, who had never been
seriously ill, suffered a massive
brain hemorrhage, and died
within 24 hours.
"How marvelous to be able to
give someone else a chance to
live," she had said to friends
only a week ago discussing
transplants.
"She was the type who would
want to do this," her husband
said. Mrs. White was the mother
of two children: Rickey, 12, and
Judy, 18. The Whites have lived
in Santa Clara County for the
last fifteen years.
"After my wife was hospital
ized," said White, an administra
tor for an electric firm, "our
family doctor and the neurosur
geon told us there was no hope.
I asked them if there was any
type of research going on re
lating to what had happened to
her, something where she could
help. They said they didn't
know."
"But a few hours later, Dr.
Shumway, whom I've never
met, phoned me and explained
the possibility of a heart trans
plant. I asked for time to talk
it over with the children and
my wife's mother. They all said
yes, and when I talked with Dr.
Shumway about thirty minutes
later, I said yes."
For the past six years, she
was employed full time by
Philco-Ford in Palo Alto, most
recently as a junior program
mer with their space re-entry
group.
Kidney Donated
Mrs. White also donated a
kidney to another patient at the
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital. At
last word, Hospital spokesmen
refused to reveal the name of
the kidney recipient or the suc
cess of the transplant.
Dr. Shumway said at the news
conference, that he was some
what worried about the size of
the transplanted heart. It was

about one-third the size of Kas
perak's diseased heart. He
weighs 144 pounds; Mrs. White
weighed 120 pounds.
Word came yesterday from
Dr. Christiaan Barnard who
used Shumway's technique that
was reported in the Journal of
the American Medical Associa
tion on November 20, of this
year, to perform the first and
third heart transplants in his
tory. He said he was sure the
Stanford team would succeed.
He said, "they are probably
one of the best equipped teams
in the world to perform such an
operation. ... I wish him all
the luck and I am sure they will
succeed."
Dr. Robert J. Glaser, dean of
the Medical School and vice
president of the University for
medical affairs, told The Daily
that this transplant "repre
sented the knowledge gleaned
in the research laboratory over
a long period of time." He called
Shumway, "the real pioneer in
the field." He also hoped that
the work of Dr. Shumway might
underscore "the importance of
support for basic science re
search." He emphasized that re
search over long periods of time
produced most scientific break
throughs, rather than acciden
tal happenings.
Shumway compared the work
of Dr. Barnard and his own
team and said that the "actual
technical details are extremely
similar." He made it clear that
the patient "would be consid
ered in critical condition for the
rest of his life."
The critical condition, he ex
plained, is due to the lack of
information on how the body
will react to the heart and
whether it will reject it as for
eign matter. The body may not
reject the heart for months,
Shumway said. The patient will
have to be under continual sur
veillance.

HEART OPERATION —The Stanford surgical team, led by Dr.
Norman Shumway, nears the end of their transplant operation at
the Stanford Medical Center Saturday night. The photo, taken by
a member of the surgical team, was released early Monday morn
ing and is the only photo of the operation that will be available.
Friday evening at about 6 p.m.,
Mrs. White, who had never been
seriously ill, suffered a massive
brain hemorrhage, and died
within 24 hours.
"How marvelous to be able to
give someone else a chance to
live," she had said to friends
only a week ago discussing
transplants.
"She was the type who would
want to do this," her husband
said. Mrs. White was the mother
of two children: Rickey, 12, and
Judy, 18. The Whites have lived
in Santa Clara County for the
last fifteen years.
"After my wife was hospital
ized," said White, an administra
tor for an electric firm, "our
family doctor and the neurosur
geon told us there was no hope.
I asked them if there was any
type of research going on re
lating to what had happened to
her, something where she could
help. They said they didn't
know."
"But a few hours later, Dr.
Shumway, whom I've never
met, phoned me and explained
the possibility of a heart trans
plant. I asked for time to talk
it over with the children and
my wife's mother. They all said
yes, and when I talked with Dr.
Shumway about thirty minutes
later, I said yes."
For the past six years, she
was employed full time by
Philco-Ford in Palo Alto, most
recently as a junior program
mer with their space re-entry
group.
Kidney Donated
Mrs. White also donated a
kidney to another patient at the
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital. At
last word, Hospital spokesmen
refused to reveal the name of
the kidney recipient or the suc
cess of the transplant.
Dr. Shumway said at the news
conference, that he was some
what worried about the size of
the transplanted heart. It was

about one-third the size of Kas
perak's diseased heart. He
weighs 144 pounds; Mrs. White
weighed 120 pounds.
Word came yesterday from
Dr. Christiaan Barnard who
used Shumway's technique that
was reported in the Journal of
the American Medical Associa
tion on November 20, of this
year, to perform the first and
third heart transplants in his
tory. He said he was sure the
Stanford team would succeed.
He said, "they are probably
one of the best equipped teams
in the world to perform such an
operation. ... I wish him all
the luck and I am sure they will
succeed."
Dr. Robert J. Glaser, dean of
the Medical School and vice
president of the University for
medical affairs, told The Daily
that this transplant "repre
sented the knowledge gleaned
in the research laboratory over
a long period of time." He called
Shumway, "the real pioneer in
the field." He also hoped that
the work of Dr. Shumway might
underscore "the importance of
support for basic science re
search." He emphasized that re
search over long periods of time
produced most scientific break
throughs, rather than acciden
tal happenings.
Shumway compared the work
of Dr. Barnard and his own
team and said that the "actual
technical details are extremely
similar." He made it clear that
the patient "would be consid
ered in critical condition for the
rest of his life."
The critical condition, he ex
plained, is due to the lack of
information on how the body
will react to the heart and
whether it will reject it as for
eign matter. The body may not
reject the heart for months,
Shumway said. The patient will
have to be under continual sur
veillance.
The recipient of a transplanted heart—the second in this coun
try —was described yesterday as "doing quite well" by the Stan
ford doctor who led the surgical team.
Dr. Norman E. Shumway of the Stanford Medical school per
formed the operation Saturday on 54-year-old Mike Kasperak a
steelworker who had to retire 18 months ago because of his heart
condition.
The heart's donor, Mrs. Virginia Mae White, a 43-year-old
Santa Clara housewife, had succumbed to a stroke several hours
earlier Saturday.
Speaking at a news conference Sunday afternoon at the Medi
cal Center, Shumway said that Kasperak "is fully conscious and
responding in good style." He added that he has a tube in his
throat to facilitate breathing.
Dr. Donald C. Harrison, head of the division of cardiology at
Stanford and assistant to Shumway in the transplant, added, "He
recognizes commands and recognizes people, his family."
However, "there is no way to term the episode a success,"
Shumway pointed out. "The work is just now beginning. What
will be done in the next several days and weeks in the manage
ment of this patient will determine whether the result is truly
successful."
Kasperak, who moved to East Palo Alto after retiring from
Laughlin Steel Corp. in Cleveland, Ohio, was suffering severe
and irreversible viral myocraditis. This infection had turned his

heart muscle into fibrous tissue
and weakened its pumping ca
pacity.
The Kasperaks were told of
the danger of the operation, but
were also told that Kasperak
could not live much longer with
out such a transplant.
When he told his wife he had
decided to go ahead with the
transplant, she said, "Go ahead,
don't waste any time. I want
you alive and with me." Mrs.
Feme Kasperak described her
husband as a "quiet, easy going,
lovable man with a lot of con
fidence in himself."

group.
Kidney Donated
Mrs. White also donated a
kidney to another patient at the
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital. At
last word, Hospital spokesmen
refused to reveal the name of
the kidney recipient or the suc
cess of the transplant.
Dr. Shumway said at the news
conference, that he was some
what worried about the size of
the transplanted heart. It was

about one-third the size of Kas
perak's diseased heart. He
weighs 144 pounds; Mrs. White
weighed 120 pounds.
Word came yesterday from
Dr. Christiaan Barnard who
used Shumway's technique that
was reported in the Journal of
the American Medical Associa
tion on November 20, of this
year, to perform the first and
third heart transplants in his
tory. He said he was sure the
Stanford team would succeed.
He said, "they are probably
one of the best equipped teams
in the world to perform such an
operation. ... I wish him all
the luck and I am sure they will
succeed."
Dr. Robert J. Glaser, dean of
the Medical School and vice
president of the University for
medical affairs, told The Daily
that this transplant "repre
sented the knowledge gleaned
in the research laboratory over
a long period of time." He called
Shumway, "the real pioneer in
the field." He also hoped that
the work of Dr. Shumway might
underscore "the importance of
support for basic science re
search." He emphasized that re
search over long periods of time
produced most scientific break
throughs, rather than acciden
tal happenings.
Shumway compared the work
of Dr. Barnard and his own
team and said that the "actual
technical details are extremely
similar." He made it clear that
the patient "would be consid
ered in critical condition for the
rest of his life."
The critical condition, he ex
plained, is due to the lack of
information on how the body
will react to the heart and
whether it will reject it as for
eign matter. The body may not
reject the heart for months,
Shumway said. The patient will
have to be under continual sur
veillance.
The recipient of a transplanted heart—the second in this coun
try —was described yesterday as "doing quite well" by the Stan
ford doctor who led the surgical team.
Dr. Norman E. Shumway of the Stanford Medical school per
formed the operation Saturday on 54-year-old Mike Kasperak a
steelworker who had to retire 18 months ago because of his heart
condition.
The heart's donor, Mrs. Virginia Mae White, a 43-year-old
Santa Clara housewife, had succumbed to a stroke several hours
earlier Saturday.
Speaking at a news conference Sunday afternoon at the Medi
cal Center, Shumway said that Kasperak "is fully conscious and
responding in good style." He added that he has a tube in his
throat to facilitate breathing.
Dr. Donald C. Harrison, head of the division of cardiology at
Stanford and assistant to Shumway in the transplant, added, "He
recognizes commands and recognizes people, his family."
However, "there is no way to term the episode a success,"
Shumway pointed out. "The work is just now beginning. What
will be done in the next several days and weeks in the manage
ment of this patient will determine whether the result is truly
successful."
Kasperak, who moved to East Palo Alto after retiring from
Laughlin Steel Corp. in Cleveland, Ohio, was suffering severe
and irreversible viral myocraditis. This infection had turned his

heart muscle into fibrous tissue
and weakened its pumping ca
pacity.
The Kasperaks were told of
the danger of the operation, but
were also told that Kasperak
could not live much longer with
out such a transplant.
When he told his wife he had
decided to go ahead with the
transplant, she said, "Go ahead,
don't waste any time. I want
you alive and with me." Mrs.
Feme Kasperak described her
husband as a "quiet, easy going,
lovable man with a lot of con
fidence in himself."
The donor and her husband,
high school sweethearts from
Des Moines, lowa, had cele
brated their 22nd wedding anni
versary Thursday night. But on


HEART OPERATION —The Stanford surgical team, led by Dr.
Norman Shumway, nears the end of their transplant operation at
the Stanford Medical Center Saturday night. The photo, taken by
a member of the surgical team, was released early Monday morn
ing and is the only photo of the operation that will be available.
Friday evening at about 6 p.m.,
Mrs. White, who had never been
seriously ill, suffered a massive
brain hemorrhage, and died
within 24 hours.
"How marvelous to be able to
give someone else a chance to
live," she had said to friends
only a week ago discussing
transplants.
"She was the type who would
want to do this," her husband
said. Mrs. White was the mother
of two children: Rickey, 12, and
Judy, 18. The Whites have lived
in Santa Clara County for the
last fifteen years.
"After my wife was hospital
ized," said White, an administra
tor for an electric firm, "our
family doctor and the neurosur
geon told us there was no hope.
I asked them if there was any
type of research going on re
lating to what had happened to
her, something where she could
help. They said they didn't
know."
"But a few hours later, Dr.
Shumway, whom I've never
met, phoned me and explained
the possibility of a heart trans
plant. I asked for time to talk
it over with the children and
my wife's mother. They all said
yes, and when I talked with Dr.
Shumway about thirty minutes
later, I said yes."
For the past six years, she
was employed full time by
Philco-Ford in Palo Alto, most
recently as a junior program

group.
