## Surveyor On Target 
### 
PASADENA (AP) —Surveyor
7, the last scheduled U.S. un
manned mooncraft, received the
first of two mid-course direction
changes yesterday afternoon
from scientists at the Jet Pro
pulsion Laboratory.
A spokesman said gas jets
on the spacecraft's legs were
activated at 3:30 p.m., PST, on?
for 15 seconds and the other
for four minutes.
The aim is to have the craft
land closer to the crater Tycho,

near the south-central edge of
the lunar disk.
When the maneuver was made,
Surveyor was 150,000 miles from
the moon and 100,000 from the
earth. Another direction change
is scheduled for tonight.
The spokesman said data re
ceived from Surveyor last night
would determine how much more
the craft's path must be altered.
When launched from Cape
Kennedy, Fla., early Sunday, tho
Atlas-Centaur booster rocket car
ried electronic instructions to
hnad for the crater Hipparchus,
1,000 miles north of Tycho.
Hipparchus was believed the
most likely target when the
guidance system was built
months ago, a laboratory spokes
man said.
Last month, however, space
agency scientists decided Tycho
was better suited to the mis
sion's goal of sampling sub
surface lunar material.
It is a younger crater and the
soil ejected when it was creat
ed by meteorite impact has had

less time to be altered by ero
sive processes.
If all goes well, Surveyor 7
will touch down gently tomor
row night and begin exploring
one of the roughest spots on the
moon with a television camera, a
small scoop shovel to dig trench
es up to 18 inches deep, a minia
ture chemistry lab to analyze
tlv? soil, and magnets to hunt
metallic material.
