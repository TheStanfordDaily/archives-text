# Johnson, Eshkol Confer
## Mideast Peace Sought 
### 
SAN ANTONIO, Tex. (AP)—
Presient Johnson and Prime
Minister Levi Eshkol of Israel
came to the solitude of the Tex
as hill country Sunday voicing
mutual hopes for peace in the
Middle East and the world.
Johnson and Eshkol traded
words of greeting and friendship
first at Randolph Air Force Base
in San Antonio. Eshkol flew in
from the East minutes after
Johnson flew down from his
ranch.
Johnson's welcoming speech
was brief. He said the "two
short days" of his meeting with
Eshkol actually just 22 hours
would be "hopeful days" and
"long with the friendship our
nations share."
Johnson said Texas was a
land born in the spirit of hope,
promise and opportunity and
neighbors working together for
common good.
In reply, Eshkol said that he
came from a land in which
hopes for peace were first ex
pressed in ancient days.
"I will not ever give up the
hope that this will come to pass,
and we in our country are work
ing to this end.
Praises Johnson
"I know how much America
is doing under your leadership
to help the cause of peace and
justice in the world. In the Bib
lical phrase (and he said it first
in Hebrew) 'Peace be to him
that is far and to him that is
near.'"
Peace in the near East was the
key point around which discus
sions between the two leaders
were pivoting, and Eshkol .said
that his central concern "is
peace for my country and for
the area of the world in which
we live."
To a crowd at the air base
which gave something of a
warm touch to a greeting in the

equivalent of 8-degree weather,
Johnson's every word almost
was of peace.
Peace In Middle East
The quest for lasting peace in
the Middle East was the top
topic for talks between the two
men during an overnight visit
of Eshkol and his wife to the
LBJ Ranch.
After the brief remarks, the
President escorted the prime
minister aboard his small jet

and headed for the ranch. John
son gave his guest an aerial
sight-seeing tour on the way and
over the ranch stretching along
the Pedernales River.
Mrs. Johnson and Mrs. Eshkol
trailed along in a helicopter.
A few hours earlier, Johnson
went to church a couple of miles
up the river from his ranch
house and heard a Roman Cath
olic defense of his policy in Viet
nam where there is no peace.
