# GOP To Attempt Coup In California Assembly
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) â€” Re
publicans prepared yesterday to
challenge Democratic leadership
in both the Senate and Assembly
when the California legislature
convened, even though signs
point toward defeat for both ef
forts.
GOP asemblymen and sena
tors met behind closed doors in
the deserted Capitol readying
for the opening at noon today of

a session expected to be domi
nated by partisan conflict and
politics, from the presidential to
the legislative level.
A last-minute drive to nomi
nate a Republican to oppose
Democratic Assembly Speaker
Jesse M. Unruh was proposed
by a group of GOP assembly
men at a meeting of 16 of the
38 party members in the lower
house.
They got their caucus execu
tive committee to recommend
that Assembly Republicans meet
before the session convened to
day to decide whether to chal
lenge Unruh. Success seemed
unlikely, since the GOP has
only 38 asemblymen, while Dem
ocrats have 42 and 41 are re
quired to elect a speaker.
It also would take a two
thirds vote of the caucus to
agree to nominate a Republican,
and one assemblyman noted the
whole thing would be a "futile
gesture."
However, Caucus Chairman
Don Mulford, R-Piedmont, told
reporters "the re-election of the
speaker this year will not be
treated in a routine manner.
This is going to be a heavily
partisan session. It's an election
year."
Unruh was contacted at his
Inglewood home while removing
Christmas decorations and told
reporters, "I don't feel threaten
ed."
Th -1 Democratic leader said a
move against him would be a
"desperate" bit of partison man
euvering by Republicans, simi
lar to the more serious attempt
to oust his Senate counterpart,
Democratic President pro tem
Hugh M. Burns of Fresno.
Republican senators met for
two hours, and afterward their
leader, Sen. Donald L. Grunsky
of Watsonvilie, said "I will be
a candidate" for Burns' job Mon
day.
However, it became apparent
he didn't have nearly the 21
votes required in the 40-seat up
per house to take over the
powerful position. The man he
replaced as GOP leader, Sen.
John F. McCarthy of San Rafael,
was found by reporters in Burns'
office after the caucus, having
a friendly drink.
Burns called the challenge
"mere wishful thinking" and
smilingly expressed confidence
he would be reelected to the post
he has hold for the last decade,
and which he won in 1957 in the
same kind of situation. Grunsky
was the unsuccessful candidate
that year.
