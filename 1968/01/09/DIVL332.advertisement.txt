SYMBOL DEPLETION
We've almost lost a good word, and we hate to see it go.
The movie industry may feel the same way about words such as colossal,
gigantic, sensational and history-making. They're good words-good sym
bols. But they've been overused, and we tend to pay them little heed. Their
effectiveness as symbols is being depleted.
One of our own problems is with the word "opportunity." It's suffering sym
bol depletion, too. It's passed over with scant notice in an advertisement.
It's been used too much and too loosely.
This bothers us because we still like to talk about opportunity. A position
at Collins holds great potential. Potential for involvement in designing
and producing some of the most important communication systems in
the world. Potential for progressive advancement in responsibility and
income. Unsurpassed potential for pride-in-product.
That's opportunity.
And we wish we could use the word more often.
Collins representatives will visit your campus this year. Contact your
