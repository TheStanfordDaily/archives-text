# Harris Survey Gives LBJ Edge Over Nixon
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Two
public opinion polls reported
Monday that President Johnson
is running ahead of former Vice
President Richard M. Nixon.
A special survey by Louis
Harris, copyrighted by the
Washington Post, said Johnson
is riding a new crest of popular
ity that would make him the fa
vorite over all four leading Re
publican presidential contenders
if the election were held now.
This is a reversal of the situa
tion two months ago when a
Harris survey indicated that
any one of the four GOP possi
bilities could defeat the Presi
dent.
The Gallup Poll reported that
in a two-way race Johnson
would have a 46 to 41 per cent
edge over Nixon with 13 per
cent undecided.
The Harris survey was com

pleted Dec. 21 and covered 2,003
households. It said:
—A 11 hou g h Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller of New York ties
Johnson 43 to 43 per cent in a
two-way race, when Wallace is
added to the list Johnson takes
the lead over Rockefeller 41 to
37 per cent, with Wallace re
ceiving 12 per cent.
—Against Nixon, Johnson now
has opened up a 50 to 41 per
cent edge, a three-point gain for
the President in three weeks
and a nine-point rise in two
months.
—Johnson runs ahead of Gov.
George Romney of Michigan by
49 to 36 per cent, up two points
in three weeks and 12 points in
eight weeks.
—Gov. Ronald Reagan of Cal
ifornia trails Johnson 37 to 51
per cent, a slippage of nine
points in eight weeks.
