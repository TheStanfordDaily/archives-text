PHNOM PENH, Cambodia
(AP) â€” Ambassador Chester
Bowles arrived Monday on a
mission for President Johnson
to discuss the use of Cambodian
territory by Communist Viet
namese troops, but Prince Noro
dom Sihanouk indicated Bowles
was wasting his time.
Sihanouk told newsmen Sun
day Bowles would do better to
tour the famous ruins at Angkor
that Mrs. John F. Kennedy vis
ited in November. And the prince
said there was "no possibility"
he would allow U.S. forces to
pursue North Vietnamese and
Viet Cong into neutral Cam
bodia.
On New Year's Day, Sihanouk
hinted that under the proper cir
cumstances he might content
himself with a formal protest if
U.S. troops entered Cambodia in
hot pursuit and then quickly
withdrew.
He said then he would "never
let any foreigner occupy the
least square meter of our terri
tory" without acting to drive
him out, "but in the case of par
tial occupation ... we must first
use protests and diplomatic
means to make the adversary
withdraw."
Sihanouk said Sunday he
would meet with Bowles Wed
nesday and suggest the United
States withdraw its troops from
South Vietnam. Johnson arrang
ed the Bowles mission after Si
hanouk said he would welcome
a presidential envoy to discuss
the use of Cambodia as a sanc
tuary by Communist fighting in
Vietnam.
Bowles, U.S. ambassador to
India, flew from New Delhi and
was met by Cambodia's minis
ter of information and the proto
col director of the Foreign Min
istry.
Australia Amassabdor Noel S.
Deschamps also met the plane.
Australia has looked after U.S.
interested in Cambodia since
Sihanouk broke diplomatic re
lations with Washington in May,
1965.
Bowles was expected to seek
tacit agreement from Sihanouk
to permit pursuit by U.S. forces

of Communist troops who attack
them in Vietnam and then re
treat to safety in Cambodia. The
prince told the Sunday news
conference he would not allow
U.S. forces to enter Cambodia
and would condemn both the
United States and the Viet Cong
if they clashed on his soil.
No Pursuit Allowed
Sihanouk said he would tell
Bowles there is "no possibility
of negotiating the right of pur
suit" of Communist forces into
Cambodia.
The prince said he also would
tell Bowles the United States
should follow the example of
France in Algeria and "rid
yourself of the Saigon para
sites."
