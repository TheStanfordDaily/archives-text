# Moscow Trial Opens
## Authors Linked To Anti-Soviet Group 
### 
MOSCOW (AP) — The three
male defendants in a Moscow
literary trial were accused to
day of working for a foreign
emigre group devoted to the
overthrow of the Soviet govern
ment, Soviet sources said.
The accusation was made in
the prosecutor's opening re
marks at a closed trial in Mos
cow city courthouse. The prose
cutor said Alexander Ginsburg,
31, Yuri Galanskov, 28, and Al
exei Dobrovlsky had contacts
with NTS, an organization of
Russians living abroad whose
Russian initials stand for Popu
lar Labor Alliance. The Soviet
government has warned its peo
ple against having anything to
do with it. Also on trial is Vera
Lashkova, a typist.
Dobrovolsky and Miss Lash
kova, admitted the charges in
the ,morning session of the trial,
the Soviet sources said.
It was impossible to obtain
complete information on the
proceedings because Western
correspondents were refused en
try and Soviet news media
maintained silence.
Shortly after the trial began,
about 50 relatives and friends
staged a silent protest on the
sidewalk outside th~ courthouse.
They had been turned away.
After about 15 minutes in the
snow and cold, they disbanded.
The four young literary fig
ures were charged under a law
prohibiting anti-Soviet agitation

and propaganda. It carries a
maximum penalty of seven
years at hard labor.
The linking of the three with
NTS came as a surprise. This
shadowy organization, with
headquarters in Paris, figured
in the 1965 trial of Englishman
Gerald Brooke and the 1967 trial
of West German student Volker
Schaffhauser. They both got
stiff sentences on a charge of
smuggling NTS material into
this country.
The Soviet government has

accused the organization of
working for U.S., British and
West German intelligence. NTS
in its manifestoes has claimed
supporters in the Soviet Union
and proclaimed as its object the
overthrow of communism, by
violence if necessary.
Ginsburg and Galanskov had
been thought to be on trial for
publication outside Russia of
"The White Book of the Sinyav
sky-Daniel Affair."
The book, printed in the So
viet Union and smuggled to

Western Europe, is a collection
of trial documents and protests
over the sentencing of satirists
Andrei D. Sinyavsky and Yuli
M. Daniel, convicted in 1966 for
publishing anti-Soviet writings
abroad. The two were sentenced
to hard labor camps, Sinyavsky
for seven years, Daniel for five.
The other defendants, poet Al
exei Dobrovolsky and Vera
Lashkova, are reported charged
in connection with the publica
tion of the underground maga

zine Phoenix 66. Sources said
Miss Lashkova's involvement
was limited to typing for the
others.
The case has stirred up the
Moscow literary community. It
drew international attention re

than 100 other intellectuals also

MOSCOW (AP) — The three
male defendants in a Moscow
literary trial were accused to
day of working for a foreign
emigre group devoted to the
overthrow of the Soviet govern
ment, Soviet sources said.
The accusation was made in
the prosecutor's opening re
marks at a closed trial in Mos
cow city courthouse. The prose
cutor said Alexander Ginsburg,
31, Yuri Galanskov, 28, and Al
exei Dobrovlsky had contacts
with NTS, an organization of
Russians living abroad whose
Russian initials stand for Popu
lar Labor Alliance. The Soviet
government has warned its peo
ple against having anything to
do with it. Also on trial is Vera
Lashkova, a typist.
Dobrovolsky and Miss Lash
kova, admitted the charges in
the ,morning session of the trial,
the Soviet sources said.
It was impossible to obtain
complete information on the
proceedings because Western
correspondents were refused en
try and Soviet news media
maintained silence.
Shortly after the trial began,
about 50 relatives and friends
staged a silent protest on the
sidewalk outside th~ courthouse.
They had been turned away.
After about 15 minutes in the
snow and cold, they disbanded.
The four young literary fig
ures were charged under a law
prohibiting anti-Soviet agitation

and propaganda. It carries a
maximum penalty of seven
years at hard labor.
The linking of the three with
NTS came as a surprise. This
shadowy organization, with
headquarters in Paris, figured
in the 1965 trial of Englishman
Gerald Brooke and the 1967 trial
of West German student Volker
Schaffhauser. They both got
stiff sentences on a charge of
smuggling NTS material into
this country.
The Soviet government has

accused the organization of
working for U.S., British and
West German intelligence. NTS
in its manifestoes has claimed
supporters in the Soviet Union
and proclaimed as its object the
overthrow of communism, by
violence if necessary.
Ginsburg and Galanskov had
been thought to be on trial for
publication outside Russia of
"The White Book of the Sinyav
sky-Daniel Affair."
The book, printed in the So
viet Union and smuggled to

Western Europe, is a collection
of trial documents and protests
over the sentencing of satirists
Andrei D. Sinyavsky and Yuli
M. Daniel, convicted in 1966 for
publishing anti-Soviet writings
abroad. The two were sentenced
to hard labor camps, Sinyavsky
for seven years, Daniel for five.
The other defendants, poet Al
exei Dobrovolsky and Vera
Lashkova, are reported charged
in connection with the publica
tion of the underground maga

zine Phoenix 66. Sources said
Miss Lashkova's involvement
was limited to typing for the
others.
The case has stirred up the
Moscow literary community. It
drew international attention re
