# Republicans Fail In Legislature Take-over
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP)—Demo
crats beat back Republican at
tempts to take over the legisla
ture's two most powerful posi
tions yesterday in the most par
tisan opening session in years
Democrats charged that the
efforts to oust Democratic As
sembly Speaker Jesse M. Un
ruh and Senate President pro
tem Hugh M. Burns were en
gineered in the office of Gov
Reagan over protests by some
members of his own Republican
Party.
Republicans retorted that
there wasn't much point in sup
porting the Democratic leader
ship because it is determined to
sabotage the governor's 1968
legislative program and torpedo

his chances for the GOP presi
dential nomination.
After the roll was held open
for 35 minutes to round up ab
sent Democrats, Unruh was re
elected speaker of the lower
house 42-38, the exact Demo
cratic-Republican split in the
Assembly. It was the closest
call yet for the 45-year-old Un
ruh, who has held the powerful
job since 1961, longer than any
one else in history.
Proceedings were more sub
dued in the Senate, where Burns
won reelection 27-12 in a repeat
of the situation 11 years ago
when he first won the president
pro tern's post. Seven Republi
cans bolted their party and
lined up behind the 65-year-old
Burns, who didn't vote.

Losing candidate was Sen.
Donald L. Grunsky, R-Watson
ville—who also suffered defeat
in 1957.
In return for the GOP sup
port for Burns, Democrats re
tained Republican Sens. John F.
McCarthy of San Rafael and
Jack Schrade of San Diego on
the powerful Rules Committee,
which controls the path of leg
islation. The pair voted for
Burns, to the chagrin of Grun
sky, who had said he wanted a
public recording of which Re
publicans stuck with their party
and governor, and which ones
chose to go with the opposition.
It was a far more bitter
scene in the Assembly, where a

rancorous caucus of the 38 Re
publicans overrode protests of
middle-of-the-road members and
forced a hopeless challenge ol
Unruh.
Monagan told a news confer
ence there had been no signifi
cant opposition to running a
candidate, but Unruh—follow
ing minutes later in the same
room—said at least 10 Republi
cans lobbied against the futilt
gesture.
After he won, the speaker
said from the rostrum that he
realized some of his Republican
friends were pressured to op
pose him by "outside forces"—
clearly meaning Reagan—and
one GOP assemblyman nodded
his head.
