# Academic Credit Available In P.E.
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Students who took physical
education and other university
courses for activity credits last
quarter will now be able to
petition for one unit of aca
demic credit, Registrar Harvey
JJall said yesterday.
Hall stated that the petition
committees would "react fav
orably" to these petitions, and
added that he would automatic
ally change all signups for
zero units in winter quarter to
one unit of academic credit.
The decision came as a result
of the Academic Council's de
cision to "abolish immediately"
all activity requirements. Stu
dents previously had to partici
pate in at least six activities,
including one in both the fresh
man and sophomore years.
Hall emphasized that the Reg
istrar's subcommittee had
adopted a principle of "equity
within the academic year." Stu
dents will not be able to change
activity credits to academic
units if the courses were taken
before the start of this aca

demic year, i.e. before the fall
quarter of 1967.
Pass-Fail Allowable
Students will be allowed to
take these new academic units
on a pass-fail grading basis and
instructors can make course
grading pass-fail for all stu
dents. Students can continue to
take athletics courses for one
academic unit.
Officials in the men's and
women's P.E. departments said
yesterday that there would be
no immediate reduction in the
number of courses offered, de
spite fears that enrollment will
drop with the end of the re
quirements.
Director of Athletics Chuck
Taylor said he would not be
able to determine whether a
drop in enrollees would force
curriculum changes. "The pres
sure is on us now to provide
a good program and keep mean
ing in the courses," he said.
"We must encourage students
to volunteer to participate with
a wide range of activities and

excellent instruction," Taylor
added.
Drop In Enrollment?
Taylor also mentioned that
previous cuts in athletic require
ments had always been followed
with greater registration on a
voluntary basis.
Ruth Kaiser, secretary to the
women's P.E. department, said
she expected no drop in enroll
ment until at least next year.
"Many women take the course
because they must, then find
out that they like it and con
tinue to take P.E. courses. How
ever, next year's women may
not bother."
Her opinion was sustained by
Judy Boyer, of General Studies
Advising, who said, "Men are
more inclined to care for their
own physical improvement than
women. There was great con
cern over a potentially large
drop in women's P.E. registra
tion."
Mrs. Boyer also feared that
many students would not take
P.E. courses now. "They needed
initiative from another source
to force them out of the dorm
and off the books."
However, after an initial rush
this quarter to verify petitions,
the General Studies office will
no longer need to ki ep track
of activity credits. "Bookkeep
ingwise, that's a very good
thing," Miss Boyer rejoiced.

Students will be allowed to
take these new academic units
on a pass-fail grading basis and
instructors can make course
grading pass-fail for all stu
dents. Students can continue to
take athletics courses for one
academic unit.
Officials in the men's and
women's P.E. departments said
yesterday that there would be
no immediate reduction in the
number of courses offered, de
spite fears that enrollment will
drop with the end of the re
quirements.
Director of Athletics Chuck
Taylor said he would not be
able to determine whether a
drop in enrollees would force
curriculum changes. "The pres
sure is on us now to provide
a good program and keep mean
ing in the courses," he said.
"We must encourage students
to volunteer to participate with
a wide range of activities and

excellent instruction," Taylor
added.
Drop In Enrollment?
Taylor also mentioned that
previous cuts in athletic require
ments had always been followed
with greater registration on a
voluntary basis.
Ruth Kaiser, secretary to the
women's P.E. department, said
she expected no drop in enroll
ment until at least next year.
"Many women take the course
because they must, then find
out that they like it and con
tinue to take P.E. courses. How
ever, next year's women may
not bother."
Her opinion was sustained by
Judy Boyer, of General Studies
Advising, who said, "Men are
more inclined to care for their
own physical improvement than
women. There was great con
cern over a potentially large
drop in women's P.E. registra
tion."
Mrs. Boyer also feared that
many students would not take
P.E. courses now. "They needed
initiative from another source
to force them out of the dorm
and off the books."
However, after an initial rush
this quarter to verify petitions,
the General Studies office will
no longer need to ki ep track
of activity credits. "Bookkeep
ingwise, that's a very good
thing," Miss Boyer rejoiced.
Students who took physical
education and other university
courses for activity credits last
quarter will now be able to
petition for one unit of aca
demic credit, Registrar Harvey
JJall said yesterday.
Hall stated that the petition
committees would "react fav
orably" to these petitions, and
added that he would automatic
ally change all signups for
zero units in winter quarter to
one unit of academic credit.
The decision came as a result
of the Academic Council's de
cision to "abolish immediately"
all activity requirements. Stu
dents previously had to partici
pate in at least six activities,
including one in both the fresh
man and sophomore years.
Hall emphasized that the Reg
istrar's subcommittee had
adopted a principle of "equity
within the academic year." Stu
dents will not be able to change
activity credits to academic
units if the courses were taken
before the start of this aca

demic year, i.e. before the fall
quarter of 1967.
