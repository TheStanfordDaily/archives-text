# Powell Plans Visit For Campus Talk
## 
### 
Rep. Adam Clayton Powell is
expected on campus later this
week as part of a speaking tour
of California college campuses.
Powell arrived at Los Angeles
International Airport last night
at 7:10 after a five hour flight
from Miami.
But the Stanford Black Stu
dent Union (BSU) has as yet re
ceived no response from an in
vitation telegrammed to Powell
last Friday at his island retreat
on Bimini in the Bahamas.
However, Powell indicated at
a press conference in Miami
Monday night before his depar
ture that he had ended his self
imposed island exile to begin
a California tour.
The Harlem Democrat listed
UCLA, San Diego State, Berke
ley, San Francisco State, and
Stanford as the college campus
es that he would visit. He was
scheduled Monday evening to
walk the streets of Watts, the
scene of racial rioting in 1964.
"I haven't heard anything
from him," said Charles Coun
tee, BSU co-chairman.

Countee disclosed that the
BSU had no definite plans for
a Powell visit. Countee said he
would like to schedule a cam
puswide speech by Powell along
with discussions with student
groups.
"So far, it's all just conjec
ture," Countee stated.
The invitation to Powell to
visit the campus is part of a
preliminary program sponsored
by the BSU, entitled: "Black
Power: A Cross-Section of Black
Viewpoints."
The program is still in its
planning stages, since the BSU
has not as yet received funds
from the Tresidder Board, co
sponsors of the series. The BSU
has a list of prospective speak
ers, but is awaiting approval of
funds before making definite
commitments.
Powell's exile began more than
a year ago after he was excluded
from the U.S. House of Repre
sentatives. He later won re-elc
tion, but the House did not per
mit him to take his seat.
