### 
STONEWALL, Tex. (AP) —
President Johnson and Prime
Minister Levi Eshkol of Israel
ended overtime talks at the LBJ
Ranch Monday, and said that
Johnson had agreed to an active,
sympathetic review of Israel's
"military defense capability."
But no offer of U.S. Arms aid
was announced.
Johnson and Eshkol also "re
stated their dedication to the es
tablishment of a just and lasting
peace in the Middle East," in
the spirit of a United Nations
resolution of Nov. 22.
Peace in that uneasy area of
the world haf. oeen billed as the
prime topic of discussions be
tween the President and prime
minister. The talks began Sun
day, continued Monday, and ran
three hours past the time set for
Eshkol's departure.
Renewed Fighting'
Johnson and EJshkol ended
their talks under a cloud of re
newed fighting on the Israeli-
Jordanian frontier.
Israel sent jet fighters over
Jordan yesterday to knock out
Jordanian gun positions and end
a sharp artillery duel across the

Jordan River, an army spokes
man announced here.
Jordan claimed — and Israel
denied — that one plane was
downed by antiaircraft fire.
Israel said there was an ex
change of fire late last night
around the settlement of Yar
dena, but that no was injured
and there was no damage.
In New York, Israeli Ambas
sador Gideon Rafael said he was
sending a letter of complaint to
the U.N. Security Council. He
said the incident showed that
Jordan's hostile attitude toward
Israel has not changed.
The fighting erupted while
Gunnar Jarring, the U.N. peace
envoy, conferred with Jordanian
officials in Amman on a Middle
East settlement.
Each side blamed the other
for starting the fighting. An Is
raeli communique said there
were no Israeli casualities.
A Jordanian army spokesman
said four Israeli tanks were de
stroyed in the 5V2-hour land and
air battle. It reported eight Jor
danians injured and claimed the
Israelis suffered heavy casual
ties.
It was the second use of
planes by Israel since the June
war along the Jordan River
cease-fire line.

Jordan claimed — and Israel
denied — that one plane was
downed by antiaircraft fire.
Israel said there was an ex
change of fire late last night
around the settlement of Yar
dena, but that no was injured
and there was no damage.
In New York, Israeli Ambas
sador Gideon Rafael said he was
sending a letter of complaint to
the U.N. Security Council. He
said the incident showed that
Jordan's hostile attitude toward
Israel has not changed.
The fighting erupted while
Gunnar Jarring, the U.N. peace
envoy, conferred with Jordanian
officials in Amman on a Middle
East settlement.
Each side blamed the other
for starting the fighting. An Is
raeli communique said there
were no Israeli casualities.
A Jordanian army spokesman
said four Israeli tanks were de
stroyed in the 5V2-hour land and
air battle. It reported eight Jor
danians injured and claimed the
Israelis suffered heavy casual
ties.
It was the second use of
planes by Israel since the June
war along the Jordan River
cease-fire line.
