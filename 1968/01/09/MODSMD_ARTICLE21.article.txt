# Ph.D. Degrees
## Study Lauds Stanford 
### 
Stanford is one of the nation's
top ten producers of doctorate
degrees, a newly published study

by the National Academy of Sci
ences (NAS) shows.
The report, entitled "Docto
rate Recipients from United
States Universities 1958-1966,"
ranks Stanford tenth in terms
of the number of doctorate de
grees conferred over the eight
year period with 2393.
Holding the first five spots are
the University of Illinois (3907),
the University of Wisconsin
(3817), the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley (3739), Har
vard (3774), and Columbia
(3344).
Two other California institu
tions are among the top 25 na
tionally. They are UCLA, rank
ed 18th with 1968, and USC, 24th
with 1562. California, neverthe
less, is second only to New York
when compared on a state-wide
basis according to the study.
The NAS report also reveals
a strong Stanford showing in six
specific fields during the 1964-
1966 period. The University
ranks second in mathematics,
third in engineering, third in
earth sciences, eighth in speech
and drama, ninth in anthropo
logy, and tenth in business ad
ministration.
Engineering Growing Fastest
Moreover, in a separate study
published last year by the Amer
ican Council on Education, Stan

ford was rated among the first
three institutions in the nation
with respect to overall excellence
in its graduate programs.
The NAS study elucidates a
number of trends as well. En
gineering, it reports, is the fast
est growing major field with an
18 per cent average annual gain
in doctorates. The professional
fields — particularly business —
show an average growth rate of
more than ten per cent.
In general there seems to be
a trend toward university em
ployment, especially in the phy
sical sciences. Two-thirds of the
Ph.D. recipients took their first
jobs with an educational insti
tution, 12 per cent with industry,
seven per cent with government,
four per cent with non-profit or
ganizations, nine per cent with
foreign employers, and two per
cent with others.
The report also shows that
only 27 per cent of the new doc
torate holders received their de
grees in their native states, and
that the percentage of female
recipients (about one in nine)
remained constant since 1960.
Finally, whereas in 1920 four
of the top five and 12 of the top
20 leading schools were private,
1966 figures show only seven pri
vate schools still in the first
twenty and one in the first five.

with 1562. California, neverthe
less, is second only to New York
when compared on a state-wide
basis according to the study.
The NAS report also reveals
a strong Stanford showing in six
specific fields during the 1964-
1966 period. The University
ranks second in mathematics,
third in engineering, third in
earth sciences, eighth in speech
and drama, ninth in anthropo
logy, and tenth in business ad
ministration.
Engineering Growing Fastest
Moreover, in a separate study
published last year by the Amer
ican Council on Education, Stan

ford was rated among the first
three institutions in the nation
with respect to overall excellence
in its graduate programs.
The NAS study elucidates a
number of trends as well. En
gineering, it reports, is the fast
est growing major field with an
18 per cent average annual gain
in doctorates. The professional
fields — particularly business —
show an average growth rate of
more than ten per cent.
In general there seems to be
a trend toward university em
ployment, especially in the phy
sical sciences. Two-thirds of the
Ph.D. recipients took their first
jobs with an educational insti
tution, 12 per cent with industry,
seven per cent with government,
four per cent with non-profit or
ganizations, nine per cent with
foreign employers, and two per
cent with others.
The report also shows that
only 27 per cent of the new doc
torate holders received their de
grees in their native states, and
that the percentage of female
recipients (about one in nine)
remained constant since 1960.
Finally, whereas in 1920 four
of the top five and 12 of the top
20 leading schools were private,
1966 figures show only seven pri
vate schools still in the first
twenty and one in the first five.
Stanford is one of the nation's
top ten producers of doctorate
degrees, a newly published study

by the National Academy of Sci
ences (NAS) shows.
The report, entitled "Docto
rate Recipients from United
States Universities 1958-1966,"
ranks Stanford tenth in terms
of the number of doctorate de
grees conferred over the eight
year period with 2393.
Holding the first five spots are
the University of Illinois (3907),
the University of Wisconsin
(3817), the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley (3739), Har
vard (3774), and Columbia
(3344).
Two other California institu
tions are among the top 25 na
tionally. They are UCLA, rank
ed 18th with 1968, and USC, 24th
with 1562. California, neverthe
