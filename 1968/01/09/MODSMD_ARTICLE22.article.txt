# Carmichael Letters
## Scrapbooks Show Different Stokely 
### HANK LIESE 
Buried in the University Ar
chives of the main library is
a collection of seven scrapbooks
and personal letters which por
tray a man whom many Am
ericans would like to see ar
rested for treason.
His name is Stokely Car
michael, 26-year-old black power
advocate and former chairman

of the Student Nonviolent Co
ordinating Committee (SNCC).
The Carmichael collection is
a gift of Mrs. Lorna D. Smith
of San Jose, a 70-year-old white
woman, who after working in
the 1930's with Theodore Dreiser
and Upton Sinclair, donated sim
ilar scrapbooks of these auth
ors to Stanford's library.
The seven scrapbooks on Car-

Michael are filled with clippings
from newspapers and maga
zines, circulars, folders, confer
ence advertisements, and pro
grams dating from July, 1964 to
November, 1967. All of the items
relate directly to Carmichael
and primarily to his work with
SNCC.
In the summer of 1964, Mrs.
Smith was active in the Missis
sippi Summer Project in Green
wood, Miss. As a volunteer
worker among students and
ministers under the auspic* s of
SNCC, she sorted books and
read to the children in a SNCC
operated library.
It was in Greenwood that
Mrs. Smith first met Carmichael
and heard him speak at a rally.
Impressed by his "powerful"
oratory, she predicted then that
he was a man "destined for a
rich, full life."
Mrs. Smith feels that history
will prove Carmichael is a great
man. "We must therefore," she
said, "have the early details of
this man's life on record."
Letters Are Personal
Included in the collection in
the main library is the book
Freedom Summer, inscribed by
its author Sally Belfrage. The
book deals with the efforts of
civil rights workers in Missis
sippi in that summer of 1964.
Most of the correspondence In
the collection is addressed to
Mrs. Smith in reference to her
work on the Mississippi project
and her later help with the ef
forts of SNCC.
Twenty-five letters are from
Carmichael himself, dating from
December, 1965 to July, 1967,
and several are quite personal.
Some of the earlier letters are
thank-you notes to Mrs. Smith,
who helped raise funds for Car
michael when he was organiz
ing a tent city in Selma, Ala
bama, in 1965.
At this time, more than 50
Negro families had been evicted
from their plantations for at
tempting to register to vote, and
SNCC had purchased some land
on which to set up what was
called "Freedom City."
The last two leters were sent

to Mrs. Smith just before Car
michael departed five months
ago on a world tour which car
ried him to several Communist
countries, Cuba and North Viet
nam among them.
His reported remarks in Cuba
urging guerilla warfare in Am
erican cities brought cries from
several Congressmen that Car
michael be arrested for sedition
when he returned to the States.
But last month Time Maga
zine reported that Attorney Gen
eral Ramsey Clark "opposed
any legal action in the belief
that the Government's case
might make Carmichael a mar
tyr and would probably not hold
up in court."
When Carmichael did return
to the U.S. last month, his pass

port was confiscated bccause,
as a U.S. citizen, he broke the
State Department's rule against
trips to Cuba and North Viet
nam.
Mrs. Smith, who has not
heard from Carmicharl since
his return, believes that he was
"misquoted" or "taken out of
context" on his recent tour.
Through her correspondence
with him, she says that she
"knows" Carmichael and feels
he is not a man of violence or
an advocate of violence.
In one of the letters of the
collection, Carmichael, in June
of 1966, writes to Mrs. Smith:
"I woke up this morning to find
out that there were riots in
Florida and in Chicago. I do not
know what it will take to make

the people in this country real
ize the danger we're in.
"While the press may try to
distort everything we say, they
cannot distort the riots. They
will still be there."
"You do not find hatred in his
writings," says Mrs. Smith, and
in reference to the above ex
cerpt she continues, "That was
not written by a man who wants
riots."
"Stokely Carmichael," she
says, "has tried and is trying
to wake us up to the fact that
the Negro is human and should
be treated so."
And Mrs. Smith, having just
donated the seventh scrapbook
on Stokely Carmichael early
last month, is already well into
her eighth.
