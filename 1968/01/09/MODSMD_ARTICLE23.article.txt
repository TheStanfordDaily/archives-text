# SRT To Present Controversial Play
## 
### 
"Candaules, Commissioner," a
west coast premiere which
opens Wednesday at the Stan
ford Repertory Theater, is a
"fable for our times," a story
which deals with the consequen
ces of contemporary warfare
and the physical and psychologi
cal destruction it brings.
By San Francisco playwright
Daniel C. Gerould, the play will
run at the Nitery through Feb
ruary 3 under the dire ction of
SRT's William Sharp, with
Sheldon Feldner as Candaules,
Elizabeth Huddle as his wife
Nyssia, and N. R. Davidson as
the native servant Gyges. This
afternoon (Monday) at 4:15 in
the Tresidder Small Lounge the
director and members of the
cast will hold an audience brief
ing for what is likely to be one
of the most controversial plays
to be shown here this year.
Gerould has fused a Greek
legend with his own wartime ex
periences, and the result is a
stage shocker which can be
viewed as a lucid commentary
on present U.S. involvement in

Vietnam. Candaules, the well
intentioned king who insists
upon showing his wife naked
to his servant and thereby loses
his throne and his life, is trans
formed into the modern idiom
of a Western diplomat in a war
torn Asian country. This modern
Candaules also insists upon
showing his wife naked to the
natives, "just as the 'have' na
tions of the world insist upon
sharing their riches with the
'have-not' nations," says Ger
ould.
Gerould, who is a professor
of English and chairman of the
department of world literature
at San Francisco State, drew
upon his experiences in the
Korean War to convey the alien
ation and hostility which per
vades the atmosphere in an oc
supied country. In spite of the
parallels of the play's mythical
country, Lydia, to war-torn Viet
nam, the author insists that
"The play is not simply about
war in Vietnam, or even about
any particular war, but rather
about the kinds of attitudes
which produce such a war."
The author says that both the
intruder and the native are "vic
tims," since both are full of
hostility which remains masked
until the stark reality of the
war situation breaks through.
Candaules, the pleasant bene
factor, masks his hostility by
his refusal to recognize the
agony and oppression around
him, while Gyges represses his
hatred through his acquiescence
to the aggressor.
Candaules, Gerould says, is a
"colossal, comic fool," because
he holds the official, correct at
titudes toward his position and
in doing so remains aloof from
reality." Candaules entertains
his dinner guests with picture
window views of the battlefield
action, yet the window sets them
apart, and Candaules distances
himself even more by using
binoculars.
Author Gerould is expected
to be on hand for one of the
post-performance Thursday eve
ning discussions. The play will
be presented Tuesday through
Saturday evenings at 8 p.m.
(with the exception of this
week's opening). Tickets are
available at Tresidder Union
Box Office with student dis
counts available.
