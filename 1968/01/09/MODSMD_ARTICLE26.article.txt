## Politics In 1968: GOP Needs A New Coalition 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
NEW YORK — The safest thing so say now
Is that it is too early to guess about the 1968
election*. But politicians and journalists are
not allotted to play it that safely. For the poli
ticians are already making choices and deci
sions, and, as for the journalists, they had
better go out of business if they want it never
to be said that they guessed wrong.
And so, since political guessing is inevitable,
how can we best educate our guesses? We
must have some idea where we are going
during the coming months.
While there is no way of forecasting now
whether the Democrats or the Republicans
will win the Presidency or who the Republican
candidate will be or even whether Lyndon
Johnson will be the Democratic candidate, it is
possible, I think, to see that 1968 may be a
critical year in our party politics — a year
like 1932, when a new coalition of groups and
factions emerged and took over political power.
This may be, this can be, a year when the
Democratic Party, as brought together by
Franklin Roosevelt under the banner of the
New Deal, gives place to a new coalition form
ed by the Republicans. This Is not a certainty,
i The Republicans may fumble the opportunity.
i But the dominant feature of the political
scene will be, I venture to predict, that this
: historic opportunity now presents itself.
t Compromise To Succeed
We start, then, with the general proposition
that in this big country all successful political
• parties are coalitions. When they are solid,
, interlocking coalitions of powerful interests,

the party is likely to dominate political life un
til it breaks up and important elements in the
coalition seek their satisfaction in the other
party.
In the past hundred years there have been
two great coalitions. The first was Republican,
formed at the time of the Civil War; it was a
union of the manufacturing interests of the
North and of the farmers outside of the South.
While this coalition lasted, the Republican
Party won most of the elections, losing only
a few and then only temporarily.
In 1912 the Republican coalition began to
break up and, although it recovered in the
19205, after the reaction against Woodrow Wil
son and World War I, the coalition went smash
in 1932 in the Great Depression.
Democrats Dominate
Since then the Democrats have been the
dominant party. They have had a coalition of
organized labor, fanners, ethnic minorities,
the intellectual community, and the young
voters. This coalition was put together by
Franklin Roosevelt and, although it had a set
back under Gen. Dwight Eisenhower because
of the Korean war, it elected John F. Kennedy
in 1960 and Lnydon Johnson in 1964.
The crucial question for 1968 is first whether
the Democratic coalition is breaking up. The
second question is whether a Republican co
alition, capable of taking over political power,
can be discerned.
★ ★ ★
There is, of course, no doubt that the Demo
cratic coalition, first under Mr. Roosevelt and
later under Mr. Kennedy, is, if not broken,

badly fractured. The political question is
whether it will no longer constitute a ma
jority in the 1968 election. It is impossible to
make a definite guess about this.
Victory May Not Mean Victory
There is in the first place the uncertainty
of war. While there is little doubt, it seems to
me, that the war cannot be won in the sense
that South Vietnam becomes an independent,
anti-Communist and anti-Chinese state, it
might happen that Hanoi will be so battered
that it makes a gesture of submission. This
may be unlikely, but it is possible.
In that case Lyndon Johnson may yet appear
in the role of a victor. This might rally a large
part of the old Democratic majority. But we
must remember that as with Mr. Wilson in
1918 and Winston Churchill in 1945, being vic
torious is not necessarily and always a free
ticket of election.
The other great asset of the Democratic
Party today is that as late as 1967 there were,
according to the Gallup Poll, 46 Democrats
to every 27 Republicans in the country. What
the proportion will be in November will sure
ly depend in a great measure on whether the
Republicans nominate a candidate who attracts
or repels Democrats.
Will History Repeat?
Moreover, the Johnson leaders must remem
ber that a landslide victory very much like
that of Mr. Johnson's in 1964 was won by Her
bert Hoover in 1928. Mr. Hoover in 1928 won
by 444 electoral votes to 87. Yet, four years
later, his huge majority had disappeared; the

Great Depression made him a one-term Presi
dent, and the Republican Party after that de
feat was so broken that it lost the next four
elections in a row.
Out of the old Democratic coalition, Mr.
Johnson has lost most of the intellectual com
munity and a very large proportion of the
young voters. It is not easy to see how he can
win them back.
There is little he can say or do which will
make them forget or forgive the way that
pledges were broken and promises reversed
immediately after the 1964 election. Not even
a gesture of surrender from Hanoi will restore
the confidence of the intellectuals and the
young, their faith and hope in the President.
Up To The Republicans
It is true, of course, that the intellectual
community and the young people are nothing
like a majority of the people. But in this cen
tury, at least, the Democrats have never won
an election without their active support.
If the Democrats can win this time, it will
be because the Republicans have made it im
possible for anti-Johnson Democrats to vote
for hte Republican candidate.
If this happens, if the Republicans do not
offer the great mass of dissenting Democrats
a choice, there will be some, there may be
many, who will vote for Mr. Johnson, prefer
ring the devil they know.
Some May Give Up
But what I fear most is that for lack of a
political choice in 1968 there will be a large
exodus from the political arena into some form

of political nihilism — despair, drugs, with
drawal, sporadic violence, refusal to play the
game, including attempts to break up and
interfere with the game.
This is the prospect which must most con
cern responsible Democrats who look ahead.
They do not have to win the 1968 election.
That may be beyond their power. But they
do have to save the Democratic Party as an
American institution, making good its claim
to the support of Americans in times to come.
Their main task in 1968 is to prevent the
destruction of the faith that in this nation
political grievances can be righted by political
means.
The Democrats must not become identified
with the notion, which is not widespread, that
what presidential candidates say when they
are running for office is quite different from
what they do when they get into office; that
voters in the Senate and in the House have no
effect on the activity of a President when he
wages undeclared war after announcing var
ious slogans, refuses to explain what he is
doing; that, in a word, the political life is a
fraud.
This is the overriding issue on which Sen.
Eugene McCarthy has chosen to take his
stand. It is a gallant and discerning decision
and, whatever the outcome, it will mean that
someone has come forth, not to fulfill an ambi
tion or to work off a grievance, but to keep
valid the Democratic belief that the greatest
issues ifc-public should be decided not in the
streets but by orderly and rational debate.
