# Letters To The Editor
## Brown's View On Possible Indictment 
### 
Editor, the Daily:
j appreciate your concern
about my situation vis-a-vis pos
sible indictment, as expressed in
yesterday's news story. I would
like as briefly as I can to clarify
how I see the issues for the
days ahead:
1. My immediate concern is
that total support be given to
Bill Coffin, Dr. Spock and the
others who have been indicted.
Those of us who share their
position must not appear to
back away from them now that
the price of support has been
upped.
2. Part of that price may be
that others will be indicted. I
hope my stress on this will not
leave the impression that I am
"seeking martyrdom" or some
thing of the the sort. I have no
compulsive need to be arrested
or go to jail, but it must be
clear that I, and others, are will
ing to pay that price if it is de
manded.
3. We must welcome the oc
casion of a trial, whoever is in
dicted, as a means of focusing
the moral and legal issues of the
war in sharper perspective. A
public trial will achieve this nd
as perhaps nothing else can do,
and it can achieve it through
the legal structures of our dem
ocratic process, a fact for which
I am profoundly grateful.
4. I want to express my grati
tude to all those in the Stanford

community who have been so
marvelously supportive to my
family and me, and to assure
those who disagree strongly
with the position some of us
have taken, that we take it not
out of disloyalty to our country,
but out of a high sense of loyal
ty to a vision of what America
should be—a vision that has
been so grieviously tarnished in
recent years.

• Banal Morality-
Editor, the Daily:
It is ironic that nowhere
should less enthusiasm and
praise be shown for Dr. Shum
way's heart transplant than in
the newspaper of his own com
munity. To be sure, this reaction
is not uncharacteristic of the
pretentious attitude generally
assumed by collegiate publica
tions, but it is disappointing
that the attempt to appear per
ceptive should lead to such in
anities as those published in The
Daily's Monday editorial.
Obviously, there are questions
to be raised, even in the face
of the most significant and ap
parently remarkable events. But
to ask, "is it moral to remove
a still-beating heart from the
donor in order to save the life
of a recipient?" is, to say the
least, simplistic moralistic rhet
oric. Not to mention that trans
planted hearts are not necessar
ily still beating when they are
removed from the donor's body
and, on the other side of the
coin, that a decapitated man's
heart can still beat.
To ask men as knowledgeable
and respected as Drs. Barnard
and Shumway whether they can
define death is an unpardon
able insult. This is not the first
time that doctors have been
asked to determine whether a
person is alive, nor is the prob
lem by and large so complex
as to require unusual medical
credentials.
And The Daily's questions
about the desirability of extend
ing the life of a 54-year-old man
(or anyone else) are even more
ridiculous. Would the editors
care to comment on the "mor
ality" and "desirability" of hav
ing mortals who are fortunate
enough to be healthy make de
cisions regarding diminution of
the life span of others? It seems
that The Daily, rather than
warn us of the "1984" it fears
lies ahead, is taking us there in
leaps and bounds.
Please, Daily, try to retain a
sense of perspective and give
proper credit to the few who
really deserve it.

Editor, the Dally:
During this academic year,
the Stanford Repertory Theater
has presented three productions.
As a result of a poor review by
The Daily, my wife and I new
comers to the campus, did not
see the first production. With a
bit more independent spirit, we
went off to see the second pro
duction of two one act plays,
Meeting Place and Out at Sea.
These were excellent renditions
of two fine plays, the first of
which was written by a member
of the Theater, Paul Richards.
No review of these plays ap
peared in The Daily. The Palo
Alto Times, however, thought
they were wonderful. The third
production was of The Cavern.
Again, my wife and I felt that
we were treated to an < xcellent
evening of theatre. Both the
Chronicle and the Palo Alto
Times gave the production won

derful reviews, so that the last
few evening performances were
completely sold out. Only The
Daily gave the play a poor re
view.
One cannot help but foel that
there are many newcomers on
the campus who are missing
superb performances by the
Theater of extremely interest
ing plays because they are not
aware that the reviews pre
sented in The Daily are often
not in accord with the opinions
of most other theatre goers. I
urge these people to check the
other papers in the area or to
take a change. They have an op
portunity which is normally
available in just a few major
cities to see plays which are
infrequently produced and to
watch young actors and ac
tresses develop into fine per
formers.

Editor, the Dally:
During this academic year,
the Stanford Repertory Theater
has presented three productions.
As a result of a poor review by
The Daily, my wife and I new
comers to the campus, did not
see the first production. With a
bit more independent spirit, we
went off to see the second pro
duction of two one act plays,
Meeting Place and Out at Sea.
These were excellent renditions
of two fine plays, the first of
which was written by a member
of the Theater, Paul Richards.
No review of these plays ap
peared in The Daily. The Palo
Alto Times, however, thought
they were wonderful. The third
production was of The Cavern.
Again, my wife and I felt that
we were treated to an < xcellent
evening of theatre. Both the
Chronicle and the Palo Alto
Times gave the production won

derful reviews, so that the last
few evening performances were
completely sold out. Only The
Daily gave the play a poor re
view.
One cannot help but foel that
there are many newcomers on
the campus who are missing
superb performances by the
Theater of extremely interest
ing plays because they are not
aware that the reviews pre
sented in The Daily are often
not in accord with the opinions
of most other theatre goers. I
urge these people to check the
other papers in the area or to
take a change. They have an op
portunity which is normally
available in just a few major
cities to see plays which are
infrequently produced and to
watch young actors and ac
tresses develop into fine per
formers.
ARTHUR BIENENSTOCK
Associate Professor of
Materials Science
Editor, the Daily:
j appreciate your concern
about my situation vis-a-vis pos
sible indictment, as expressed in
yesterday's news story. I would
like as briefly as I can to clarify
how I see the issues for the
days ahead:
1. My immediate concern is
that total support be given to
Bill Coffin, Dr. Spock and the
others who have been indicted.
Those of us who share their
position must not appear to
back away from them now that
the price of support has been
upped.
2. Part of that price may be
that others will be indicted. I
hope my stress on this will not
leave the impression that I am
"seeking martyrdom" or some
thing of the the sort. I have no
compulsive need to be arrested
or go to jail, but it must be
clear that I, and others, are will
ing to pay that price if it is de
manded.
3. We must welcome the oc
casion of a trial, whoever is in
dicted, as a means of focusing
the moral and legal issues of the
war in sharper perspective. A
public trial will achieve this nd
as perhaps nothing else can do,
and it can achieve it through
the legal structures of our dem
ocratic process, a fact for which
I am profoundly grateful.
4. I want to express my grati
tude to all those in the Stanford

community who have been so
marvelously supportive to my
family and me, and to assure
those who disagree strongly
with the position some of us
have taken, that we take it not
out of disloyalty to our country,
but out of a high sense of loyal
ty to a vision of what America
should be—a vision that has
been so grieviously tarnished in
recent years.

• Banal Morality-
Editor, the Daily:
It is ironic that nowhere
should less enthusiasm and
praise be shown for Dr. Shum
way's heart transplant than in
the newspaper of his own com
munity. To be sure, this reaction
is not uncharacteristic of the
pretentious attitude generally
assumed by collegiate publica
tions, but it is disappointing
that the attempt to appear per
ceptive should lead to such in
anities as those published in The
Daily's Monday editorial.
Obviously, there are questions
to be raised, even in the face
of the most significant and ap
parently remarkable events. But
to ask, "is it moral to remove
a still-beating heart from the
donor in order to save the life
of a recipient?" is, to say the
least, simplistic moralistic rhet
oric. Not to mention that trans
planted hearts are not necessar
ily still beating when they are
removed from the donor's body
and, on the other side of the
coin, that a decapitated man's
heart can still beat.
To ask men as knowledgeable
and respected as Drs. Barnard
and Shumway whether they can
define death is an unpardon
able insult. This is not the first
time that doctors have been
asked to determine whether a
person is alive, nor is the prob
lem by and large so complex
as to require unusual medical
credentials.
And The Daily's questions
about the desirability of extend
ing the life of a 54-year-old man
(or anyone else) are even more
ridiculous. Would the editors
care to comment on the "mor
ality" and "desirability" of hav
ing mortals who are fortunate
enough to be healthy make de
cisions regarding diminution of
the life span of others? It seems
that The Daily, rather than
warn us of the "1984" it fears
lies ahead, is taking us there in
leaps and bounds.
Please, Daily, try to retain a
sense of perspective and give
proper credit to the few who

praise be shown for Dr. Shum
way's heart transplant than in
the newspaper of his own com
munity. To be sure, this reaction
is not uncharacteristic of the
pretentious attitude generally
assumed by collegiate publica
tions, but it is disappointing
that the attempt to appear per
ceptive should lead to such in
anities as those published in The
Daily's Monday editorial.
Obviously, there are questions
to be raised, even in the face
of the most significant and ap
parently remarkable events. But
to ask, "is it moral to remove
a still-beating heart from the
donor in order to save the life
of a recipient?" is, to say the
least, simplistic moralistic rhet
oric. Not to mention that trans
planted hearts are not necessar
ily still beating when they are
removed from the donor's body
and, on the other side of the
coin, that a decapitated man's
heart can still beat.
To ask men as knowledgeable
and respected as Drs. Barnard
and Shumway whether they can
define death is an unpardon
able insult. This is not the first
time that doctors have been
asked to determine whether a
person is alive, nor is the prob
lem by and large so complex
as to require unusual medical
credentials.
And The Daily's questions
about the desirability of extend
ing the life of a 54-year-old man
(or anyone else) are even more
ridiculous. Would the editors
care to comment on the "mor
ality" and "desirability" of hav
ing mortals who are fortunate
enough to be healthy make de
cisions regarding diminution of
the life span of others? It seems
that The Daily, rather than
warn us of the "1984" it fears
lies ahead, is taking us there in
leaps and bounds.
Please, Daily, try to retain a
sense of perspective and give
proper credit to the few who
really deserve it.

• Review Reviews
Editor, the Dally:
During this academic year,
the Stanford Repertory Theater
has presented three productions.
As a result of a poor review by
The Daily, my wife and I new
comers to the campus, did not
see the first production. With a
bit more independent spirit, we
went off to see the second pro
duction of two one act plays,
Meeting Place and Out at Sea.
These were excellent renditions
of two fine plays, the first of
which was written by a member
of the Theater, Paul Richards.
No review of these plays ap
peared in The Daily. The Palo
Alto Times, however, thought
they were wonderful. The third
production was of The Cavern.
Again, my wife and I felt that
we were treated to an < xcellent
evening of theatre. Both the
Chronicle and the Palo Alto
Times gave the production won

derful reviews, so that the last
few evening performances were
completely sold out. Only The
Daily gave the play a poor re
view.
One cannot help but foel that
there are many newcomers on
the campus who are missing
superb performances by the
Theater of extremely interest
ing plays because they are not
aware that the reviews pre
sented in The Daily are often
not in accord with the opinions
of most other theatre goers. I
urge these people to check the
other papers in the area or to
take a change. They have an op
portunity which is normally
available in just a few major
cities to see plays which are
infrequently produced and to
watch young actors and ac
tresses develop into fine per
formers.

Associate Professor of

Editor, the Daily:
j appreciate your concern
about my situation vis-a-vis pos
sible indictment, as expressed in
yesterday's news story. I would
like as briefly as I can to clarify
how I see the issues for the
days ahead:
1. My immediate concern is
that total support be given to
Bill Coffin, Dr. Spock and the
others who have been indicted.
Those of us who share their
position must not appear to
back away from them now that
the price of support has been
upped.
2. Part of that price may be
that others will be indicted. I
hope my stress on this will not
leave the impression that I am
"seeking martyrdom" or some
thing of the the sort. I have no
compulsive need to be arrested
or go to jail, but it must be
clear that I, and others, are will
ing to pay that price if it is de
manded.
3. We must welcome the oc
casion of a trial, whoever is in
dicted, as a means of focusing
the moral and legal issues of the
war in sharper perspective. A
public trial will achieve this nd
as perhaps nothing else can do,
and it can achieve it through
the legal structures of our dem
ocratic process, a fact for which
I am profoundly grateful.
4. I want to express my grati
tude to all those in the Stanford

community who have been so
marvelously supportive to my
family and me, and to assure
those who disagree strongly
with the position some of us
have taken, that we take it not
out of disloyalty to our country,
but out of a high sense of loyal
ty to a vision of what America
should be—a vision that has
been so grieviously tarnished in
recent years.
