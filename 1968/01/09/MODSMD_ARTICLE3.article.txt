# U.S. Budget Head Quits; Zwick In

### 
SAN ANTONIO (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson announced last
night the resignation of Budget
Director Charles L. Schultze—
his chief of staff in developing
the financial program of the
government which runs to well
over $100 billion a year.
To replace Schultze, Johnson
tapped Assistant Director Char
les J. Zwick.
Schultze said no exact date
has been fixed for his leaving
but it will not be before the
budget is presented to Congress.
The target date for that presen
tation is Jan. 29 but this time
limit may be extended.
He is the second top eco
nomic adviser to President
Johnson to resign within the
past week.
Last week, Johnson an
nounced the resignation of
Gardner Ackley, chairman of
the Council of Economic Advis
ers, and named him ambassador
to Italy.
Schultze plans to join the
Brookings Institution, a private
research group with headquar
ters in Washington, as a senior
fellow, a new post. Brookings is
headed by Kermit Gordon,
whom Schultze succeeded as
budget director.
The switch in the Budget Bu
reau post came at a time when
Johnson is attempting to com
plete the budget for the 1969 fis
cal year— a new-look budget
that may run to more than $180
billion.
In the 10 days Johnson has
been at his Texas ranch,
Schultze has been a frequent
commuter—and he has agreed
to remain on until the job is
finished on the new spending
program.
Schultze, besides going to the
Brookings Institution, is also re
joining the University of Mary

land faculty for part-time teach
ing. An effective date for his
resignation has not been set.
The budget bureau director
said in Washington he talked
about leaving office as early as
last June but agreed to stay on
until the new budget is pre
pared.
Schultze, 43, has been with
the Budget Bureau more than
five years as assistant director
and as director sine? June 1965.
Zwick is 41. He was with the
Rand Corporation in Santa
Monica, Calif., before joining
the Budget Bureau. He has a
doctor's degree in economics
from Harvard University and
for a time taught economics at
Harvard.
He also was a member of the
faculty of the Department of
Agricultural Economics at the
University of Connecticut.
