## Boxing's Establishment-Hardly 'The Greatest' 
### 
Dave Noland

The recent impressive victories scored by heavyweight boxers Joe
Frazier and Buster Mathis are very convenient for boxing's Estab
lishment. The showings of these young fighters, and the eight-man
elimination tournament to fill the vacant championship have been
arousing quite a bit of interest and enjoying good financial success.
There are more good young heavyweights fighting more fights
these days, and this can only benefit the sport. But there is still
something missing.
That something, of course, is Muhammed Ali, or Cassius Clay if
you will. Everyone knows that he has (or had) a big mouth. Every
one remembers his haranguing orations, his poetry, and his pre
dictions. And everybody knows about his connection with the Black
Muslim group. But few people can accept that he is probably the
best boxer that ever lived. The fact that this tremendous athlete,
just now reaching his prime, has not been allowed to fight (either
in the U.S. or abroad) is a sad commentary on the boxing Establish
ment's attitude toward the sport that it controls.
The reason for Ali's suspension, of course, is his refusal to be
inducted into the Army. He broke the law, they say. We won't have
a criminal as a champion. Just think what that would do for our
image.
Why the sudden concern for boxing's image? Where was that
concern four years ago, when the champion was named Sonny Lis
ton? If memory serves correctly, Sonny had been arrested nineteen
times for various charges, including assaulting a police officer.
Not exactly the type to put on a Wheaties box for the youth of
America to worship.
Muhammed Ali single-handedly rescued big time boxing from ex
tinction. Without him, a heavyweight fight is a gigantic yawn, a
plodding show with about as much action as a chess match. Ali
turns it into something truly exciting.
The Establishment has rewarded its saviour with banishment, in
the name of protecting its image.
Perhaps they should concern themselves less with their image,
and more with the business of carrying on boxing matches botween
the best fighters they can find. Muhammed Ali is the very best
there is.

Let's all give a big hand to Winter Carnival organizers Tom
Sather and Mark Zenner. About the only detail they didn't take
care of themselves was providing six inches of nice, fresh powder
snow. By moving the affair from Squaw Valley to Heavenly Valley,
they managed to reduce the total cost from $38 to $28, and commut
ing time from the casinos to almost nothing. Publicity, accom
modations, and food were all great. Now if there had only been
some snow....

All the furor about Health Education 400 and its athletical
ly inclined enrollment has led to "de-emphasis" of the HE De
partment. Undoubtedly, the Mickey courses will have to go
underground, taking refuge behind the skirts of more academically
prestigious departments. Why not one in the Geology Dept.?
It's name, of course, would be "Rocks for Jocks."

TAKE THAT! — Card wrestler Lennie Borchers is in control of the situation as his UCLA opponent
vainly tries to escape with a short sit out and turn in maneuver. Borchers went on to win this 160
pound battle 12-4. The other Cards didn't fare so well, however, and the Bruins won Friday's contest
316.
On Saturday, Stanford took on Cal Poly (Pamona) and San Diego State in a double dual at Berke
ley. The Tribe slipped by Poly for a 20-15 decision, but bowed to San Diego, 18-11. Borchers won both
of his maethes to round off a great weekend's performance.
Bud Hollingsberry at 177 received a severe ankle sprain on Saturday, but still managed to hang on
for the win. However, he will be out of action for at least a week. His slot will be filled by Bill Ross.
Next weekend the Tribe grapplers will venture north for a "warmup" match with Portland State,
and then two big conference matches with Oregon and Oregon State. Coach Dave Heed is confident
that the Cards will get back into the winning column in the Paciflc-8 race.

The recent impressive victories scored by heavyweight boxers Joe
Frazier and Buster Mathis are very convenient for boxing's Estab
lishment. The showings of these young fighters, and the eight-man
elimination tournament to fill the vacant championship have been
arousing quite a bit of interest and enjoying good financial success.
There are more good young heavyweights fighting more fights
these days, and this can only benefit the sport. But there is still
something missing.
That something, of course, is Muhammed Ali, or Cassius Clay if
you will. Everyone knows that he has (or had) a big mouth. Every
one remembers his haranguing orations, his poetry, and his pre
dictions. And everybody knows about his connection with the Black
Muslim group. But few people can accept that he is probably the
best boxer that ever lived. The fact that this tremendous athlete,
just now reaching his prime, has not been allowed to fight (either
in the U.S. or abroad) is a sad commentary on the boxing Establish
ment's attitude toward the sport that it controls.
The reason for Ali's suspension, of course, is his refusal to be
inducted into the Army. He broke the law, they say. We won't have
a criminal as a champion. Just think what that would do for our
image.
Why the sudden concern for boxing's image? Where was that
concern four years ago, when the champion was named Sonny Lis
ton? If memory serves correctly, Sonny had been arrested nineteen
times for various charges, including assaulting a police officer.
Not exactly the type to put on a Wheaties box for the youth of
America to worship.
Muhammed Ali single-handedly rescued big time boxing from ex
tinction. Without him, a heavyweight fight is a gigantic yawn, a
plodding show with about as much action as a chess match. Ali
turns it into something truly exciting.
The Establishment has rewarded its saviour with banishment, in
the name of protecting its image.
Perhaps they should concern themselves less with their image,
and more with the business of carrying on boxing matches botween
the best fighters they can find. Muhammed Ali is the very best
there is.

TAKE THAT! — Card wrestler Lennie Borchers is in control of the situation as his UCLA opponent
vainly tries to escape with a short sit out and turn in maneuver. Borchers went on to win this 160
pound battle 12-4. The other Cards didn't fare so well, however, and the Bruins won Friday's contest
316.
On Saturday, Stanford took on Cal Poly (Pamona) and San Diego State in a double dual at Berke
ley. The Tribe slipped by Poly for a 20-15 decision, but bowed to San Diego, 18-11. Borchers won both
