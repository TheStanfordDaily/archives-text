# Pacific 8 Basketball Roundup
## UCLA Keeps Rolling Along Daily SPORTS 
### 
(AP) UCLA's basketball team
has drawn large crowds for a
long time and especially since
the 1961-62 season when the
Bruins began making a habit of
playing in the NCAA Western
Regional Championships.
This year the crowds are
larger but quieter since the
Bruins usually turn games into
routs and the only thing in
doubt is the particular weapon
chosen to bludgeon the oppon
ent.
Over the weekend Lew Alcin
dor's ball handling led the way
to 28-point victories over Wash
ington State, 97-69, and Wash
ington, 93-65.
The victory was the 44th in a
row over three years, the 10th
without a loss this season and
the 34th at Pauley, where
they've never lost.
The only test for the awe
some men of John Wooden
apepars to be one scheduled
for Jan. 20 in Houston's Astro
dome. About 50,000 in person

and millions via television will
view the Bruin-Huston game.
Southern California opened
its Pacific-8 season with a pair
of victories over the Washing
ton schools. Bill Hewitt scored
the final bucket in a 58-56 tri
umph Friday over the Huskies.
Troy then tripped WSU 92-73,
Oregon State also started the
coast season with a pair of
wins.
The Beavers surprised Cali
fornia 76-63 Friday night and
then held Stanford's Art Harris
to just 15 points in beating the
Indians 67-51.
Harris opened the Pac-8 sea

son Friday night with 37 points
as the Indians beat Oregon
79-73.
Cal's sharpshooting guard
Russ Critchfleld salvaged the
Golden Bear weekend.
The Bears came back from
the loss to the Beavers on Fri
day to trounce the Ducks 96-81
as Critchfleld had 36 points and
center Bob Presley had 19.
