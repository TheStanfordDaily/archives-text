# Black Hawks' Bobby Hull Joins 400 Goal Elite
## 
### 
(AP) — Bobby Hull's non-stop
sprint in the National Hockey
League's all-time goal-scoring
race has carried the Chicago
Black Hawks' superstar past an
other checkpoint. And he's still
in too much of a hurry to look
back.
"I'll just have to take them as
they come," Hull said Sunday
night after his 400 th and 401st
career goals helped Chicago's
East Division leaders beat sec
ond place Boston 4-2. Hull be
came the fourth 400-goal scorer
in NHL history — joining De
troit's Gordie Howe, Montreal's
Jean Beliveau and ex-Canadian
star Maurice Richard — with a
45-foot blast midway in the sec
ond period. He started on the
way to 500 with an cpen-net tal
ly in the final minute.
"I'll keep playing and scoring,
I hope, until the day comes when
I'm plagued with injuries and
no longer a help to the team,"
he said.
Oakland Wins
Three goals by Gerry Ehman
helped Oakland snap an 11-game
winless streak with a 6-0 victory
over skidding Los Angeles; Jean
Ratelle's hat trick led New
York past Toronto 6-2; Montreal
nipped Detroit 4-3 on Gilles
Tremblay's third period goal and
Philadelphia's West Division
front-runners topped Pittsburgh
3-1 in other Sunday games.

Stan Mikita fired Chicago's go
ahead goal in the third period
and Hull provided insurance
with his 31st tally of the season
as the Hawks moved three points
up on Boston in the East. Oak
land goalie Charlie Hodge stop
ped 26 shots in blanking the
Kings, who have lost eight in a
row. Ehman scored once in the
third for the Seals' first hat
trick.
Ratelle Hat Trick
Ratelle registered his first
NHL hat trick inside five min
utes in the second period after
first period tallies by Reg Flem
ing, Orland Kurtenbach and
Phil Goyette staked the Rangers
to a 3-0 lead.
Trembley snapped a 3-3 tie
early in the third period, send
ing the Canadians past the Red
Wings, who fell into the East
cellar — one point behind Mon
treal and New York.
Forbes Kennedy, Gary Dorn
hoefer and Ed Hoekstra scored
for Philadelphia and Doug Fa
vell turned away 36 Pittsburgh
shots in nailing mid-season
goal-tending honors for himself
and alternate Bernie Parent.
The Flyers' goaltenders will
divide $250 for allowing only 77
goals — least in the league —
during the first half of the cam
paign.
In Saturday's games, Montreal
whipped New York 5-2, Chicago

drubbed Detroit 6-2, St. Louis
nipped Los Angeles 2-1, Boston
played Toronto to a 3-3 tie, Phil
adelphia and Pittsburgh tied 2-2
and Minnesota battled Oakland
to a 5-5 deadlock.
