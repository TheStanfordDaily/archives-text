SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Joseph L. Alioto, on the day of
his inauguration as mayor, said
he already has partially solved
what he regards as one of his
most vexing problems — provid
ing jobs for members of minor
ity groups.
On a cross-country trip, he
obtained agreements for em
ployment of more Negroes by
air lines operating at San Fran
cisco International Airport, he
said.
Other challenges facing his
administration Alioto said, in
clude: — San Francisco's rising
crime rate which is far outdis
tancing any increase in popula
tion. — Inferior housing. — High
taxes on homeowners.
All are difficult problems, he

said, but he is beginning efforts
to solve them.
Alioto took office as San Fran
cisco's 34th mayor today in in
augural ceremonies that span
ned most of the day and were
the most elaborate in the city's
history.
One of Alioto's first problems
will be the labor contract dis
pute between the Musicians un
ion and the Symphony associa
tion. There were 18 sign-carry
ing pickets outside the classical
Opera House in chilly, foggy
weather when the inauguration
party arrived. Signs called for
more pay, among other things.
Alioto, delivering his inaugural
address before an audience
which included his mother, wife,
four sons and a daughter, de
clared that no communit ywithin
the city is an island.
