# Vatican Conservative Out
## Prelate Resigns Post 
### DAVID MAZZARELLA Associated Press Writer 
VATICAN CITY — Ultra-con
servative Alfredo Cardinal Otta
viani has resigned as the high
est authority on faith and mor
al in the government of the
Roman Catholic Church, the
Vatican announced Monday.
Pope Paul VI accepted the
resignation, calling it a "most
noble gesture," and appointed
as successor a prelate from Com
munist Yugoslavia, Franjo Car
dinal Seper.
More than any other person
nel change at the Vatican in
years, the development symbol
ized the evolution of the half bil
lion-member Church in this dec
ade from a closed, conservative
institution to one struggling with
a new role in the modern world.
Cardinal Ottaviani, 77, was re
garded by progressive clerics as
a major obstacle to Church
modernization. As proprefect of
the Sacred Congregation for the
Doctrine of the Faith, he wield
ed immense behind-the-scenes
power and described himself as
a "policeman" guarding Church
tradition.
The appointment of Cardinal
Seper, 63, archbishop of Zagreb,
is the most dramatic move so
far in Pope Paul's efforts to in
ternationalize the Italian-domi
nated Roman Curia, th<- central
Church administration.

Informed Vatican sources
said Cardinal Ottaviani leaves
"in piedi" (on his feet), mean
ing the resignation was forced
neither by health reasons nor by
direct intervention of the Pope.
They said that although he has
been partially blind for more
than a decade, he is in good
health. They also said his resig

nation has been sitting on Pope
Paul's desk for some time, the
pontiff having turned it down
until now.
Last February, the pontiff
praised Cardinal Ottaviani in a
letter as "my friend and teach
er" and expressed the hope he
would remain at his post for
many years to come. He had
warm praise again for the car
dinal in his letter accepting the
resignation, printed Monday by
the Vatican paper L'Osserva
tore Romano.
Officials close to Cardinal Ot
taviani let out the word that he
had resigned to "set an exam
ple" for older prelates in high
Curia positions. Pope Paul ask
ed Curia cardinals more than
a year ago to put their jobs at
his disposal. Vatican informants,
however, reported the conviction
in high Church circles that the
cardinal felt himself increasing
ly isolated by the movement for
liberalization that began with
the 1962-65 Second Vatican Coun
cil.
Since 1935 he had been a high
official of the congregation,
which grew out of the 16th cen
tury Inquisition. Since 1953 he
had run it as basically the sole
administrtive arbiter of doctri
nal questions from dioceses
around the world.
At the Vatican Council, how

ever ,he often found himself an
gered by progressive bishops
who repeatedly denounced his
congregation's secrecy. After the
council, Pope Paul changed the
congregation's name from the
"Holy Office," which for cen
turies had evoked the image
of heretic-hunting. He abolished
its index of forbidden books and
ordered fair trials for religious
defendants.
But the flight continued behind
the scenes with Cardinal Otta
viani fighting a rearguard ac
tion against changes he consid
ered were undermining the
church.
The severest blow came last
Aug. 18 when the Pope announc
ed a sweeping reorganization of
the entire Curia designed to
break the domination of conser
vative Italian prelates who tra
ditionally control the Vatican of
fices.
The reform, to take effect
March 1, will end the lifetime
tenure in Curia posts of cardi
nals and their subordinates. In
stead they will be named for
five-year terms with extensions
at the pleasure of the Pope.
