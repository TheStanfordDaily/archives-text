# Transplant Patient Worse
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
The condition of Mike Kas
pernak, heart transplant patient
at the Stanford Medical Center,
worsened yesterday.
Now in his third day with a
new heart, the 54-year-old form
er steelworker is suffering from
a severe pre-existing liver di
sease, a form of liver and kid
ney failure.
Physicians, however, managed
to stop with blood transfusions
the bleeding from his stomach
and intestines which had occur
red early yesterday morning.
The complications that set in
yesterday were described as "se
vere, but soluble," by Dr. Norm
an E. Shumway, head of the
team that performed the heart
surgery.
The patient is receiving fresh
blood transfusions and is being
injected with fluids to wash out
impurities in the blood.
The hospital reported that his
heart appears to be functioning
"very well," and is pumping
blood at a near normal rate.
Kasperak's bleeding yesterday
morning was caused by the liver
disease, which reduced the blood
clotting ability in the body. Ele
ments of the blood, called plate
lets, which are attracted to the
sight of bleeding and "clog up"
the wound, were drastically re
duced in the blood.
The platelet count was 4,000
per cubic millimeter, compared
with a normal count of 250,000
per cu.m.m.
Kasperak is recovering behind
three sets of guarded doors on
the second floor of the hospital
in an intensive care unit. He
watched televised reports of his
own operation for ten minutes
Sunday night. Nurses reported
that he remained calm during
the broadcast.
It is reported that various
news media are presuring Mrs.
Kasperak to make statements re
garding the transplant. She has
so far remained unavailable to
the press. She has seen her hus
band at least four times since
the operation, nurses report.
The four-and-a-half hour op
eration was performed Saturday
evening by Shumway and a team
of associates. Kasperak received
the heart of a 43-year-old house
wife, Mrs. Virginia Mae White,
who died of a stroke two hours
before the historic transplant.

evening by Shumway and a team
of associates. Kasperak received

TRANSPLANTERS — Heart surgeon Norman Shumway with
assistant Dr. Donald Harrison while their patient faces difficulties
they term "severe but soluble."
The condition of Mike Kas
pernak, heart transplant patient
at the Stanford Medical Center,
worsened yesterday.
Now in his third day with a
new heart, the 54-year-old form
er steelworker is suffering from
a severe pre-existing liver di
sease, a form of liver and kid
ney failure.
Physicians, however, managed
to stop with blood transfusions
the bleeding from his stomach
and intestines which had occur
red early yesterday morning.
The complications that set in
yesterday were described as "se
vere, but soluble," by Dr. Norm
an E. Shumway, head of the
team that performed the heart
surgery.
The patient is receiving fresh
blood transfusions and is being
injected with fluids to wash out
impurities in the blood.
The hospital reported that his
heart appears to be functioning
"very well," and is pumping
blood at a near normal rate.
Kasperak's bleeding yesterday
morning was caused by the liver
disease, which reduced the blood
clotting ability in the body. Ele
ments of the blood, called plate
lets, which are attracted to the
sight of bleeding and "clog up"
the wound, were drastically re
duced in the blood.
The platelet count was 4,000
per cubic millimeter, compared
with a normal count of 250,000
per cu.m.m.
Kasperak is recovering behind
three sets of guarded doors on
the second floor of the hospital
in an intensive care unit. He
watched televised reports of his
own operation for ten minutes
Sunday night. Nurses reported
that he remained calm during
the broadcast.
It is reported that various
news media are presuring Mrs.
Kasperak to make statements re
garding the transplant. She has
so far remained unavailable to
the press. She has seen her hus
band at least four times since
the operation, nurses report.

eration was performed Saturday

of associates. Kasperak received
