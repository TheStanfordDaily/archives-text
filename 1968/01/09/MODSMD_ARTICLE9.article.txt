and held it for three hours, kill

ed Kheim Cuong behind a bar

rounds and they "were in the
streets."

hours with nearly 500 enemy in

copters were shot down.

The delta fight 19 miles south
of Saigon started about midday
when a platoon of 9th Infantry
Division troops, perhaps 40 men,
encountered a Communist force
of equal size.
U.S. headquarters said 26 ene

to the local militia.

the Americans' compound.

their bivouac areas three to five
miles away.
The guerrillas left behind 19
dead comrades and five live ones
who were captured, the spokes
man said. Two of the captives
were wounded.
The spoksman said "nine po
licemen were killed and 10 were
wounded, at least four civilians
were killed and 16 wounded, and
the garrison of some 100 militia
men suffered moderate casual
ties, meaning they were hit hard.
Ten houses also were destroyed.
The guerrillas succeeded in
hanging a large Viet Cong flag
on the wall of the military ad
visers' compound, but it was
quickly shot away.
