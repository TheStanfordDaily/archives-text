# Another Transplant Tried In New York
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
The world's fifth heart trans
plant was performed yesterday
on a 57-year-old retired fireman
In New York City, in a nine
hour operation.
Meanwhile, Stanford patient,
Mike Kasperak sat up last night
and dangled his feet over the
edge of the bed to improve his
circulation, and was visited by
his wife Feme. His condition
was "slightly improved," al
though still considered critical.
The New York heart trans
plant patient, Louis Block, was
described early this morning as
having "taken a turn for the
worse," at Maimonides Hospital,
Brooklyn, according to the Asso
ciated Press.
The hospital spokesman said
doctors were having "difficulty
in maintaining his blood pres
sure."
Woman Donor
Block received the heart of
Helen Krouch, 29, of Patterson,
N.J. The heart, said chief sur
geon Dr. Abraham Kantrowltz,
"Just isn't large enough to main
tain the circulation and there
fore has to be assisted by the
balloon pump."
The insertion of the balloon
pump, into the new heart's pres
sure system, caused the opera
tion to last for nine hours. Kan
trowitz was the surgeon who
performed the first U.S. trans
plant on a 2 H-week-old boy De

cember 6, but the boy died after
6Ms hours.
While the small heart was a
problem for physicians, they de

cided to go ahead because the
blood types of the donor and the
recipient matched "so perfect
ly." This is expected to lessen
the chances of the body's reject
ing the new heart.
Improvement at Stanford
At Stanford, hospital spokes
men said "there is no apparent
evidence of rejection at this
early time," and Kasperak's liv
er and kidney condition has im
proved since Monday.
Kasperak is no longer receiv
ing fresh blood transfusions, but
is still being assisted in breath
ing by a respirator.
In New York City, Dr. Kan
trowitz said the woman donor
had been suffering from a "rap
idly expanding brain tumor."
She died about noon, soon af
ter she was transferred to Mai
monides Hospital from a New
Jersey hospital where she was a
patient.
To Prevent Rejection
Kantrowitz said his team was
using only hormone type com
pounds to prevent Block's body
from rejecting te heart. There
are several drugs which can
make the body more tolerant of
foreign tissue.
Most of the previous human
heart transplant cases (includ
ing the Stanford transplant)
have been given Imuran, a
cousin of drugs used in can
cer therapy, X-rays and the hor
mone-type drugs to suppress the
immune reaction.
Block retired from the New
York City Fire Department with
a disability in 1948 after being
injured in the line of duty in
1945.
Bad Heart History
A neighbor, Mrs. Rose Lo Ni
gra, recalled that he had been
hospitalized "14 times with a
heart condition. This is the 15th."
She added, referred to the
heart transplant, "it was com
pelling. There was no other
way."
Block and his wife, Helen,
have two sons living at home,
George, 27, and Gary, 25.

Block retired from the New
York City Fire Department with
a disability in 1948 after being
injured in the line of duty in
1945.
Bad Heart History
A neighbor, Mrs. Rose Lo Ni
gra, recalled that he had been
hospitalized "14 times with a
heart condition. This is the 15th."
She added, referred to the
heart transplant, "it was com
pelling. There was no other
way."
Block and his wife, Helen,
have two sons living at home,
George, 27, and Gary, 25.
The world's fifth heart trans
plant was performed yesterday
on a 57-year-old retired fireman
In New York City, in a nine
hour operation.
Meanwhile, Stanford patient,
Mike Kasperak sat up last night
and dangled his feet over the
edge of the bed to improve his
circulation, and was visited by
his wife Feme. His condition
was "slightly improved," al
though still considered critical.
The New York heart trans
plant patient, Louis Block, was
described early this morning as
having "taken a turn for the
worse," at Maimonides Hospital,
Brooklyn, according to the Asso
ciated Press.
The hospital spokesman said
doctors were having "difficulty
in maintaining his blood pres
sure."
Woman Donor
Block received the heart of
Helen Krouch, 29, of Patterson,
N.J. The heart, said chief sur
geon Dr. Abraham Kantrowltz,
"Just isn't large enough to main
tain the circulation and there
fore has to be assisted by the
balloon pump."
The insertion of the balloon
pump, into the new heart's pres
sure system, caused the opera
tion to last for nine hours. Kan

performed the first U.S. trans

blood types of the donor and the
recipient matched "so perfect
ly." This is expected to lessen
the chances of the body's reject
ing the new heart.
Improvement at Stanford
At Stanford, hospital spokes
men said "there is no apparent
evidence of rejection at this
early time," and Kasperak's liv
er and kidney condition has im
proved since Monday.
Kasperak is no longer receiv
ing fresh blood transfusions, but
is still being assisted in breath
ing by a respirator.
In New York City, Dr. Kan
trowitz said the woman donor
had been suffering from a "rap
idly expanding brain tumor."
She died about noon, soon af
ter she was transferred to Mai
monides Hospital from a New
Jersey hospital where she was a
patient.
To Prevent Rejection
Kantrowitz said his team was
using only hormone type com
pounds to prevent Block's body
from rejecting te heart. There
are several drugs which can
make the body more tolerant of
foreign tissue.
Most of the previous human
heart transplant cases (includ
ing the Stanford transplant)
have been given Imuran, a
cousin of drugs used in can
cer therapy, X-rays and the hor
mone-type drugs to suppress the
immune reaction.
