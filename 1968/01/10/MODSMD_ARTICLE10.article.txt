SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” A
Superior Court judge ordered
pickets late Tuesday not to block
entrances to buildings where San
Francisco's two major daily
newspapers, closed by labor
troubles since last Friday, are
published.
Judge Charles S. Perry grant
ed the temporary restraining
order to the San Francisco
morning Chronicle and the eve
ning Examiner.
He scheduled a hearing Jan.
17 before Superior Court Judge
Robert Drewes on whether the
order involving nine unions
should be made permanent.
Meanwhile, the striking mail
ers' union and publishers' rep

sentatives resumed negotiations
Tuesday.
The Stanford University Daily
found few takers in its excur
sion from university campus to
street sales. The newspaper
sold only 1,000 of 12,000 copies
published for San Francisco
street sale Monday and about
300 of 600 published for Tues
day.
Editor Kirk Hanson said the
Daily was seriously considering
a separate edition that could
solicit advertising from San
Francisco stores. The big pro
blem, he said, was to find some
one willing to undertake handl
ing of such a special edition.
Meanwhile, he said, the Daily
will continue to publish world
news.
