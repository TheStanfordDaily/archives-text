# Stock Market Declines Despite Early Upswing
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP)—The stock
market rally Tuesday seemed
headed vigorously into its third
straight session when it began
to weaken and ended with a loss
in many market indicators.
The early impetus was strong
enough to leave a few more
gains than losses on the New
York Stock Exchange but the
cash value of listed stocks had
obviously diminished judging by
the decline in broadly based in
dices.
Trading continued very heavy.
Volume was 13.72 million shares,
the sixth largest in history,
ranking just below the Monday
total of 14.27 million, the fifth
largest.

The Dow Jones industrial av
erage closed with a loss of .63
at 908.29. At 12:30 p.m. this
closely watched average was up
as much as 7.40.
Analysts saw no specific news
item to account for the wave of
profit taking which washed out
the advance.
Of 1,503 issues traded, 692 ad
vanced and 630 declined. New
highs for the year totaled 97 and
new lows 12.
Thanks to scattered strength
among some blue chip compo
nents, The Associated Press av
erage of 60 stocks kept a small
gain of .2 at 327.3 with indus
trials up .1, rails up .1 and utili
ties up .3.
