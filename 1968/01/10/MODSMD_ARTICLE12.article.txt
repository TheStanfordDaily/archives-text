PASADENA (AP) — Survey
or 7 — last of a surprisingly suc
cessful series of lunar scouts —
made a soft landing amid boul
ders and craters Tuesday and
radioed photos of craggy and
barren moonscape.
One of its three tubular legs
missed by a fraction of an inch
a rock some eight inches in di
ameter that, struck directly,
could have toppled it.
Its television eyes peered out
over the roughest landscape yet
visited by a U.S. mooncraft: rag
ged ridges, boulders the size of
a three-story house, craters
ranging from miniscule to huge.
The spidery 600-pound craft
braked on a tongue of fire to a
touchdown at 5:05 p.m. PST,
just a mile and a half off target,
on a small plateau in highlands
near the battered rim of the
15,000-foot crater Tycho. The
area is near the south central
edge of the lunar disk.
Same As Expected
Rugged though it was, scien
tists said the landscape was
about what they had expected
from viewing aerial pictures.
This was the fifth success in
the series, which achieved its
primary mission when earlier
Surveyors returned tens of thou
sands of photos of terrain where
astronauts may tread next year.
Surveyor 7 was on a purely
scientific job: taking pictures

and sampling soil in the little
known highlands.
"Divine Guidance"
Several scientists at a labora
tory news conference used the
phrase "divine guidance" to de
scribe the lucky level landing.
There were countless places
nearby where pits or projections
could have harmed it.
Some shots showed on the hori

zon a dominant sawtoothed ridge
with what appeared to be a cra
ter at one end.
Computers had given Survey
or 7 at best a 43 per cent chance.
The "Lucky 7th" is the final
unmanned U.S. moon visitor.
Earlier Surveyors have found
four safe equatorial sites for as
tronaut landings expected to
start next year.
