# Asia 'Hot Pursuit' Opposed By Ford
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—House
Republican Leader Gerald Ford
of Michigan opposed today ex
tending the ground fighting in
Southeast Asia to "hot pursuit"
of Communists into Cambodia.
"I feel the administration
hasn't made a case under the
current circumstances for hot
pursuit," Ford told a news con
ference. "I think it would be
mandatory to come to Congress
to get concurrence before mak
ing any change in the Vietnam
policy."
Ford said Republicans agree
with the Democratic administra
tion on the basic principles of
the Vietnam war "but that
doesn't rule out prerogatives of
questioning certain parts of the
management of the war."
He criticized particularly the

pacification program which he
said had failed to work despite
repeated reorganizations in the
last two years.
Ford said he would prefer a
bonafide cease-fire rather than a
cessation of U.S. bombing as a
prelude to peace talks.
"We negotiated in Korea for
nine to 12 months and about
two-thirds of our casualties took
place during that period," Ford
said.
Ford said his initial talks with
returning members of Congress
indicate general approval of a
proposal to tax U.S. travelers
bound for Europe.
President Johnson Is trying to
cut tourist travel overseas to
help the balance of payments,
and a travel tax is one possible
means that has been mentioned.
