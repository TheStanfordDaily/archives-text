# Viet Dove Vs. Hawk In Debate Tonight
## 
### 
A dove and a semi-hawk will
debate the Vietnam war tonight
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 8.
Michael Novak, professor of re
ligion, will face Robert L. Coate,
Northern California Democratic
Party chairman.
Both men have recently vis
ited Vietnam, but have different
views of the situation there. No
vak is opposed to the war, while
Coate basically supports Presi
dent Johnson's policy.
The two participants will first
make a statement of their posi
tion on the issues, and then
answer questions from the aud
ience. The moderator will be A 1
Abrams, a member of the Stan
ford Young Democrats and a
graduate student in statistics.
Coate returned in November
from his second visit to Viet
nam. He interviewed members
of the new government, includ
ing President Thieu, and stated
that he is "optimistic about the
situation in Vietnam and pessi
mistic about the situation in the
United States."
War Is Improving
Militarily, the war is improv
ing, according to Coate. The U.S.
has kept the Vietcong from
overrunning South Vietnam, he
feels, and the country is becom
ing more secure. Coate has
stated hopes for negotiations
are dim, unless they eventually
occur between Thieu and Ho,
but a ceasefire would occur as
soon as the Communists stop
firing. The new government is
well launched he believes.
The situation at home was
"unfortunate" according to
Coate, because of the tremen
dous body of misinformation
about Vietnam, with the press
reporting too much of the nega
tive events and writers seeking
to oversimplify the complexities
of the Vietnam issue.

The peace movement, he
hopes, would not become domin
ated by "strident Americans
who really want Hanoi to win."
This takeover would turn the
cause into a fringe movement
which most Americans would
oppose, he believes.
Novak Supported Dzu
Novak was a strong supporter
of Truong Dinh Dzu, the "white
dove" peace candidate who ran
second to the Thieu-Ky ticket
in last August's election.
Dzu, whose son David attends
Stanford and is a friend of No
vak, called for an immediate
cease-fire, cessation of bombing
in the North, talks between Sai
gon and Hanoi, and a with
drawal of American troops.
Novak recalled that in 1965
he supported the U.S. position
in Saigon "on political grounds.
Now it's obvious that the prob
lem can't be solved militarily.
I'm opposed to the war on both
political and moral grounds be
cause we are destroying the
country. I'm not opposed to vio
lence in a good cause but in
Vietnam it's useless."
