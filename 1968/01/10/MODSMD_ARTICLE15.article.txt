## Engineers Plan Evaluation 
### 
The winds of change are blow
ing strong in the engineering
school. As a counterpart to the
Study of Education at Stanford
the school has launched the
Study of Engineering Educa
tion (SEE).
Special seminars have also
been organized in conjunction
with the study. The seminars
are open to graduate students
as well as undergrads and are
taken for one unit pass-fail.
Subjects for the seminars, at
least ten in number, are open.
Thus far eighteen professors
have volunteered to conduct the
classes.
Professor James Adams, a

member of the Study, said, "Stu
dent opinion is essential to the
Study of Engineering Educa
tion.
Development Troubles
"Unfortunately, it is often dif
ficult for students to find the
opportunity of developing their
ideas sufficiently so that they
will be effective against the in
ertia of established procedures.
These seminars are intended to
provide that opportunity. All
viewpoints are welcome."
The study is coordinated by
a four man committee under the
chairmanship of Ralph Smith,
professor of electrical engineer
ing and associate head of the
department.
Other members of the com
mittee include Perry McCarthy,
professor of civil engineering,
William Reynolds, professor of
mechanical engineering, and
James Adams, professor of me
chanical engineering.
Commenting on the goals of
the SEE, Smith said, "We feel
Stanford is in a unique situation
with a group of unusually prom
ising students with high aca
demic ability and leadership po

tential. At the same time we
have an outstanding faculty in
terms of creativity and scholar
ship. Our primary goal is to
develop an optimum program to
fit this unusually potent en
vironment."
Meeting Planned
At last count over 50 students
had signed up for a seminar.
There will be a meeting tonight
at 7:30 in Room 268 Engineer
ing Corner for all interested stu
dents.
A tentative list of nine sem
inars to be offered has been
drawn up. The seminars will
be limited in enrollment to 10
with one or more professors
conducting each group.
Among the tentative subjects
are the Goal of Engineering
Education at Stanford, the
Social Content of Engineering
Education at Stanford, Role of
Industrial Experience in Engi
neering Education, The Image
of the Stanford Engineering
Student, and Core Programs.
Tau Beta Pi, the engineering
honors society, is planning an
open forum similar to the one
they sponsored in November.

Education at Stanford, the
Social Content of Engineering
Education at Stanford, Role of
Industrial Experience in Engi
neering Education, The Image
of the Stanford Engineering
Student, and Core Programs.
Tau Beta Pi, the engineering
honors society, is planning an
open forum similar to the one
they sponsored in November.
The winds of change are blow
ing strong in the engineering
school. As a counterpart to the
Study of Education at Stanford
the school has launched the
Study of Engineering Educa
tion (SEE).
Special seminars have also
been organized in conjunction
with the study. The seminars
are open to graduate students
as well as undergrads and are
taken for one unit pass-fail.
Subjects for the seminars, at
least ten in number, are open.
Thus far eighteen professors
have volunteered to conduct the
classes.
Professor James Adams, a

member of the Study, said, "Stu
dent opinion is essential to the
Study of Engineering Educa
tion.
Development Troubles
"Unfortunately, it is often dif
ficult for students to find the
opportunity of developing their
ideas sufficiently so that they
will be effective against the in
ertia of established procedures.
These seminars are intended to
provide that opportunity. All
viewpoints are welcome."
The study is coordinated by
a four man committee under the
chairmanship of Ralph Smith,
professor of electrical engineer
ing and associate head of the
department.
Other members of the com
mittee include Perry McCarthy,
professor of civil engineering,
William Reynolds, professor of
mechanical engineering, and
James Adams, professor of me
chanical engineering.
Commenting on the goals of
the SEE, Smith said, "We feel
Stanford is in a unique situation
with a group of unusually prom
ising students with high aca
demic ability and leadership po

tential. At the same time we
have an outstanding faculty in
terms of creativity and scholar
ship. Our primary goal is to
develop an optimum program to
fit this unusually potent en
vironment."
Meeting Planned
At last count over 50 students
had signed up for a seminar.
There will be a meeting tonight
at 7:30 in Room 268 Engineer
ing Corner for all interested stu
dents.
A tentative list of nine sem
inars to be offered has been
drawn up. The seminars will
be limited in enrollment to 10
with one or more professors
conducting each group.
Among the tentative subjects
are the Goal of Engineering
Education at Stanford, the
Social Content of Engineering
Education at Stanford, Role of
Industrial Experience in Engi
neering Education, The Image
of the Stanford Engineering
Student, and Core Programs.
