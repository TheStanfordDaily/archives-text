# Coast Premiere
## Diplomatic Satire To Open 
### 
"Candaules, Commissioner,"
Daniel Gerould's satire on west
ern diplomats in a war-torn
Asian country, opens a four
week run at the Nitery at 8 to
night.
Stanford Repertory Theater's
production of the play, the first
on the west coast, and only the
third in the United States, fea
tures Sheldon Feldner as Can
daules, Elizabeth Huddle as his

wife Nyssia, and N. R. Davidson
as their native servant Gyges.
Gerould's play unites the
Greek myth of a king whose in
sistant displays of his nude wife
caused his own downfall and
his own war experience in Korea.
The modern Candaules, who
also displays his wife, repre
sents, says Gerould, "the have
nations sharing their riches with
the have-not nations."

The play, Gerould Insists, is
not simply about the war in
Vietnam, or any particular war.
It discusses the attitudes which
produce such a war, and shows
how repressed hostility breaks
out when the reality of war hor
rors becomes clear.
The production comes in a
new package, on the renovated
boards of the Nitery. Derek
Hunt, technical director of SRT,
placed a small box-like stage be
fore a three-quarter arena, which
places the actors even closer to
the audience.
The small capacity of the
Nitery (132) forced SRT officials
to extend the performances
through February 3, with pres
entations Tuosday through Sat
urday nights in the theater,
which is at the back of the old
Student Union.
Tickets are available at the
Tresidder Union Box Office.
Audience discussions with di
rector William Sharp, members
of the cast, and members of the
Stanford faculty are held each
Thursday. Gerould, a professor
at San Francisco State College,
is expected for one of the ses
sions.
