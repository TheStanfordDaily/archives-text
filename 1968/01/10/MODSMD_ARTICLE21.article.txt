# Franklin's 4 Visions' To Open Century 21
## 
### 
H. Bruce Franklin, associate
professor of English, will begin
Century 21's winter quarter pro
gram tonight at 7:30 in Tresid
der lounge with a lecture on
"Visions of the Future in Fic
tion and Revolution."
The 33-year-old professor's
topic combines one of Franklin's
main literary interests—futuris
tic fiction —with his chief ideo
logical concern — revolution.
Franklin is a self-professed Mao
ist.
David Harris will continue the
Century 21 series tomorrow with
a talk on "Human Values in the
Political Process."
Harris, a former ASSU presi
dent at Stanford and now a lead
er of the Resistance anti-draft
movement, will speak at 4:15
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Harris has been ordered for in
duction Jan. 17, but publicly
claims he will refuse to go.
Studying: Utopia
In 1962, Franklin published
Future Perfect: American Sci
ence Fiction of the Nineteenth
Century, a favorably reviewed
anthology. He is now working
on a full-length study of Utopian
and anti-utopian literature.
Franklin defines his field as
"Literature and Society," point
ing out that social commitment
often involves a vision of the
future. "If somebody is a revo
lutionary," Franklin said recent
ly, "presumably that means he
thinks things can be better than
they are. He has some kind of
vision of a future which is bet
ter than the present.
"Insofar as he has that kind
of vision, aTid projects it to oth
er people, well, he's a maker of
a fiction — a kind of science
fiction," Franklin said.
Franklin has also written ex
tensively on Melville and Haw
thorne. last quarter he held a
class session on these authors

(English 265) on the front lawn
of Encina hall during a protest
there against the presence of a
CIA recruiter. "We talked about
Taipei, an anti-imperialist book,"
Franklin recollected.
To defend Franklin from criti
cism over the unusual site of
his class, more than 70 members

of English 265 signed a petition
to President Sterling. They de
fended Franklin's right "to de
termine the place of meeting of
the class."
Franklin has played an active
role in leftist activity on campus
since 1964. In 1965, returning to
Stanford as an associate profes
sor after a year at Johns Hop
kins, Franklin spoke at a rally
to organize blood donations to
North Vietnam.
Early in 1966, Franklin was a
leader of the protests against
United Technology Center's na
palm plant in Redwood City.
As a faculty member of Stan
ford-in-France in 1967, Franklin
was harrassed by French police
after handing out leaflets during
a Paris visit of Vice President
Hubert Humphrey.
Recently Franklin has been a
leader in organizing a "Convo
cation of the Left" at Stanford.
Student of Mao
For "about a year" Franklin
has been a serious student of
Mao Tse-tung. He has taught
several special seminars on Com
munism, including an under
graduate special on "Marxism-
Leninism" this quarter.
Mao's thought has influenced
his teaching style, Franklin
said. He read recently in Peking
Review a statement by Mao that
"Present day examinations use
the method of dealing with ene
mies. They are surprise at
tacks."
As a result, Franklin dropped
his practice of spot quizzes. "It
puts the student and teacher in
the role of enemies," Franklin
commented.

to President Sterling. They de
fended Franklin's right "to de
termine the place of meeting of
the class."
Franklin has played an active
role in leftist activity on campus
since 1964. In 1965, returning to
Stanford as an associate profes
sor after a year at Johns Hop
kins, Franklin spoke at a rally
to organize blood donations to
North Vietnam.
Early in 1966, Franklin was a
leader of the protests against
United Technology Center's na
palm plant in Redwood City.
As a faculty member of Stan
ford-in-France in 1967, Franklin
was harrassed by French police
after handing out leaflets during
a Paris visit of Vice President
Hubert Humphrey.
Recently Franklin has been a
leader in organizing a "Convo
cation of the Left" at Stanford.
Student of Mao
For "about a year" Franklin
has been a serious student of
Mao Tse-tung. He has taught
several special seminars on Com
munism, including an under
graduate special on "Marxism-
Leninism" this quarter.
Mao's thought has influenced
his teaching style, Franklin
said. He read recently in Peking
Review a statement by Mao that
"Present day examinations use
the method of dealing with ene
mies. They are surprise at
tacks."
As a result, Franklin dropped
his practice of spot quizzes. "It
puts the student and teacher in
the role of enemies," Franklin
commented.
H. Bruce Franklin, associate
professor of English, will begin
Century 21's winter quarter pro
gram tonight at 7:30 in Tresid
der lounge with a lecture on
"Visions of the Future in Fic
tion and Revolution."
The 33-year-old professor's
topic combines one of Franklin's
main literary interests—futuris
tic fiction —with his chief ideo
logical concern — revolution.
Franklin is a self-professed Mao
ist.
David Harris will continue the
Century 21 series tomorrow with
a talk on "Human Values in the
Political Process."
Harris, a former ASSU presi
dent at Stanford and now a lead
er of the Resistance anti-draft
movement, will speak at 4:15
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Harris has been ordered for in
duction Jan. 17, but publicly
claims he will refuse to go.
Studying: Utopia
In 1962, Franklin published
Future Perfect: American Sci
ence Fiction of the Nineteenth
Century, a favorably reviewed
anthology. He is now working
on a full-length study of Utopian
and anti-utopian literature.
Franklin defines his field as
"Literature and Society," point
ing out that social commitment
often involves a vision of the
future. "If somebody is a revo
lutionary," Franklin said recent
ly, "presumably that means he
thinks things can be better than
they are. He has some kind of
vision of a future which is bet
ter than the present.
"Insofar as he has that kind
of vision, aTid projects it to oth
er people, well, he's a maker of
a fiction — a kind of science
fiction," Franklin said.
Franklin has also written ex
tensively on Melville and Haw
thorne. last quarter he held a
class session on these authors

(English 265) on the front lawn
of Encina hall during a protest
there against the presence of a
CIA recruiter. "We talked about
Taipei, an anti-imperialist book,"
Franklin recollected.
To defend Franklin from criti
cism over the unusual site of
his class, more than 70 members

of English 265 signed a petition
to President Sterling. They de
fended Franklin's right "to de
termine the place of meeting of
