# Aiding And Abetting
## 
### 
Much of the focus in the indictment of Chap
lain W. S. Coffin, Dr. Benjamin Spock, and others
has centered on the constitutionality of the law
under which they were indicted. The law pro
hibits an individual from "counseling, aiding, or
abetting" anyone to evade the draft.
The question is whether a clergyman or pro
fessor can counsel an individual to break the law.
If the counselor feels that to obey the law is
clearly immoral, then he must in conscience
counsel, aid, and abet all who are called to do
so. This is his moral obligation, regardless of the
legality of the action.
Coffin, Robert McAffee Brown, and others
have made it clear they feel the Vietnam war
and accepting induction to serve in it are clearly
immoral. Theirs is a firm moral obligation to
counsel, aid, and abet others to evade the draft.
But what about the constitutionality of the
law concerning this counseling? Can a nation
tolerate a group of individuals openly advocat
ing and aiding others to break a law? Assuming
the law to be wise and moral, the nation must
prosecute those who make it possible for others
to break the law. It is an accepted principle of
law that "whoever commits an offense against

the United States, or aids, abets, counsels, com
mands, induces, or procures its commission, is
punishable as a principal." (Title 18, U.S. code.)
Those who question the constitutionality of
this provision are focusing on the wrong issue.
It is clear that the Constitution allows the re
striction of freedom of speech implied by this
provision in Title 18. The act of those indicted
in New York was clearly one of civil disobedi
ence.
One could argue that a counselor should have
the right to discuss privately what he wants with
an individual, advocating what he thinks right
for the individual. However, the necessities of
justice and freedom for all within a society make
it necesary to prohibit any group which dis
agrees with a law from publicly encouraging and
enabling others to disobey it. This is what Coffin
and others have done.
The importance of their action is not that they
will be vindicated on the basis of freedom of
speech, but rather that they will bring into focus
the morality of the whole draft law and the Viet
nam war.
In this we hail them, but we hope those
concerned don't spend their energy arguing the
question of free speech.
