## Should P.E. Be Academic? 
### 
Edltor, The Dally:
The Academic Council, in its
action regarding Activity Cre
dits last Friday, has certainly
taken action long needed at
Stanford University. The intent
of the Council's action — the eli
mination of the requirement to
participate in activities, includ
ing physical education courses
— seems, to me, to be in the
highest sense a recognition of
the ability of a student to de
cide upon his own educational
goals.
However it appears that the
Council did not fully and care
fully consider the wording of fts
resolution. What the Academic
Council abolished was activity
credits, what it ought to have
abolished was the need for ac
tivity credits.
This is particularly important
in regards to physical education
classes. I feel there is a place
at this University for supervis
ed, and educational, Physical Ed
ucation classes. However, being
no physical behemoth I enjoyed
taking such classes as a credit
class. As explained to me yes
terday by the General Studies
Office, and confirmed with Uni
versity Registrar Harvey Hall,
however, Physical Education
classes are now only offered as
one unit academic courses. Thus
the student who desires to take
such a class for pure enjoyment
must dip into his quota of 27
pass-fail units, or must receive
the consent of the instructor and
audit the course, sometimes dif
ficult, if he wishes to avoid re
ceiving a grade translated into
academic credit.
I hope the Academic Council
will reevaluate the consequences
of its abolition of the Activity
Credit as soon as possible so
that participation in Physical
Education classes without credit
will again be allowed.

Editor, The Daily:
I believe that Tim Haight, in
his very well written and inten
tioned column in Friday's Daily
(Jan. 5), has erred in interpret
ing the argument presented in
The Arena against Dean Napier's
political sermons.
The Arena does not argue, as
Haight asserts, the shocking

statement "that religion is not
concerned with the horror and
suffering of the world, at least
not where it might criticize our
government's policy." The Are
na makes no gesture of accep
tance of what Haight calls the
"private-person" or "head-in-the
said" morality.
The statement of The Arena
that Christianity, and not Viet
nam, is the appropriate topic in
a church is an admittedly am
biguous statement intended to
elucidate the very delicate but
crucial point that, "Many stu
dents regret that the House of
God has become a political
forum." Tim Haight, I think, has
misunderstood the meaning of
this point.
No cognizant Christian could
intelligently maintain, as does
the head-in-the-sand moralist,
that deep religious dilemmas or
matters of public policy or press
ing social concerns should be
kept out of our relationship with
Christ. But a devout, perceptiv l
Christian may quite rationally
observe that there is a distinc
tion between recognizing the
moral relevance of political ques
tions and associating morality
too exclusively with a particu
lar stand on a very controversial
political issue. Dean Napier's
preaching has often seemed to
confuse the very difficult distinc
tion — but a distinction which
must, for the sake of morality
and religion, be made — between
the political and the moral as
pects of a question. The political
must not be emphasized at the
expense of the moral.
It has always been a principle
duty (if not always an ecclesias
tically approved goal) of the
minister to encourage among
his congregation the develop
ment of a critical, independent
personal conscience capable of
guiding the individual in his
practical behavior according to
the general precepts and ideals
of the morality he espouses.
It is because morality is so
largely a matter of personal con
science, of individually perceiv-

Ed right or wrong, that disagree
ments in good faith so often per
sist in questions of practical
morality. And it is because a
common morality can tolerate
differences of opinion in practi
cal matters, particularly a mor
ality based on the overriding
presence of love as an integrat
ing force, that religions, and in
particular Christianity, have
been able to be equally benefi
cial to those of, for example, dif
ferent political persuasions.
Maybe it would help to un
derstand more easily the differ
ence between the political and
the moral if one considered a
somewhat less emotion-charged
issue than one which involves
the shedding of human blood.
If the Christian morality de
manded one inescapable choice
of behavior in every political is
sue, then we would be forced
to consider sinful the countless
numbers who have taken th 1
"immoral" stands in political
questions from the War on Pov
erty to tariff legislation. It
should follow from the realiza
tion that morality can be con
sistent with differing political
views that a clergyman may di
lute his religious appeal and
lessen the impact of his moral
admonitions by tying them too
closely to a political opinion.
When The Arena asks Dean
Napier to concentrate more on
man's personal relation to Christ
and less on political advocacy, I
think it desires not that Dean
Napier cease to remind his con
gregation that political concern
is a moral responsibility, but
that he cease to prejudice his
ministry by his dogmatic and,
to many, highly alienating poli
tical intepretation of Christian
ity.

must not be emphasized at the
expense of the moral.
It has always been a principle
duty (if not always an ecclesias
tically approved goal) of the
minister to encourage among
his congregation the develop
ment of a critical, independent
personal conscience capable of
guiding the individual in his
practical behavior according to
the general precepts and ideals
of the morality he espouses.
It is because morality is so
largely a matter of personal con
science, of individually perceiv-

Ed right or wrong, that disagree
ments in good faith so often per
sist in questions of practical
morality. And it is because a
common morality can tolerate
differences of opinion in practi
cal matters, particularly a mor
ality based on the overriding
presence of love as an integrat
ing force, that religions, and in
particular Christianity, have
been able to be equally benefi
cial to those of, for example, dif
ferent political persuasions.
Maybe it would help to un
derstand more easily the differ
ence between the political and
the moral if one considered a
somewhat less emotion-charged
issue than one which involves
the shedding of human blood.
If the Christian morality de
manded one inescapable choice
of behavior in every political is
sue, then we would be forced
to consider sinful the countless
numbers who have taken th 1
"immoral" stands in political
questions from the War on Pov
erty to tariff legislation. It
should follow from the realiza
tion that morality can be con
sistent with differing political
views that a clergyman may di
lute his religious appeal and
lessen the impact of his moral
admonitions by tying them too
closely to a political opinion.
When The Arena asks Dean
Napier to concentrate more on
man's personal relation to Christ
and less on political advocacy, I
think it desires not that Dean
Napier cease to remind his con
gregation that political concern
is a moral responsibility, but
that he cease to prejudice his
ministry by his dogmatic and,
to many, highly alienating poli

The Academic Council, in its
action regarding Activity Cre
dits last Friday, has certainly
taken action long needed at
Stanford University. The intent
of the Council's action — the eli
mination of the requirement to
participate in activities, includ
ing physical education courses
— seems, to me, to be in the
highest sense a recognition of
the ability of a student to de
cide upon his own educational
goals.
However it appears that the
Council did not fully and care
fully consider the wording of fts
resolution. What the Academic
Council abolished was activity
credits, what it ought to have
abolished was the need for ac
tivity credits.
This is particularly important
in regards to physical education
classes. I feel there is a place
at this University for supervis
ed, and educational, Physical Ed
ucation classes. However, being
no physical behemoth I enjoyed
taking such classes as a credit
class. As explained to me yes
terday by the General Studies
Office, and confirmed with Uni
versity Registrar Harvey Hall,
however, Physical Education
classes are now only offered as
one unit academic courses. Thus
the student who desires to take
such a class for pure enjoyment
must dip into his quota of 27
pass-fail units, or must receive
the consent of the instructor and
audit the course, sometimes dif
ficult, if he wishes to avoid re
ceiving a grade translated into
academic credit.
I hope the Academic Council
will reevaluate the consequences
of its abolition of the Activity
Credit as soon as possible so
that participation in Physical
Education classes without credit
will again be allowed.

I believe that Tim Haight, in
his very well written and inten
tioned column in Friday's Daily
(Jan. 5), has erred in interpret
ing the argument presented in
The Arena against Dean Napier's
political sermons.
The Arena does not argue, as
Haight asserts, the shocking

statement "that religion is not
concerned with the horror and
suffering of the world, at least
not where it might criticize our
government's policy." The Are
na makes no gesture of accep
tance of what Haight calls the
"private-person" or "head-in-the
said" morality.
The statement of The Arena
that Christianity, and not Viet
nam, is the appropriate topic in
a church is an admittedly am
biguous statement intended to
elucidate the very delicate but
crucial point that, "Many stu
dents regret that the House of
God has become a political
forum." Tim Haight, I think, has
misunderstood the meaning of
this point.
No cognizant Christian could
intelligently maintain, as does
the head-in-the-sand moralist,
that deep religious dilemmas or
matters of public policy or press
ing social concerns should be
kept out of our relationship with
Christ. But a devout, perceptiv l
Christian may quite rationally
observe that there is a distinc
tion between recognizing the
moral relevance of political ques
tions and associating morality
too exclusively with a particu
lar stand on a very controversial
political issue. Dean Napier's
preaching has often seemed to
confuse the very difficult distinc
tion — but a distinction which
must, for the sake of morality
and religion, be made — between
the political and the moral as
pects of a question. The political
must not be emphasized at the
expense of the moral.
It has always been a principle

I believe that Tim Haight, in
his very well written and inten
tioned column in Friday's Daily
(Jan. 5), has erred in interpret
ing the argument presented in
The Arena against Dean Napier's
political sermons.
The Arena does not argue, as
Haight asserts, the shocking

statement "that religion is not
concerned with the horror and
suffering of the world, at least
not where it might criticize our
government's policy." The Are
na makes no gesture of accep
tance of what Haight calls the
"private-person" or "head-in-the
said" morality.
The statement of The Arena
that Christianity, and not Viet
nam, is the appropriate topic in
a church is an admittedly am
biguous statement intended to
elucidate the very delicate but
crucial point that, "Many stu
dents regret that the House of
God has become a political
forum." Tim Haight, I think, has
misunderstood the meaning of
this point.
No cognizant Christian could
intelligently maintain, as does
the head-in-the-sand moralist,
that deep religious dilemmas or
matters of public policy or press
ing social concerns should be
kept out of our relationship with
Christ. But a devout, perceptiv l
Christian may quite rationally
observe that there is a distinc
tion between recognizing the
moral relevance of political ques
tions and associating morality
too exclusively with a particu
lar stand on a very controversial
political issue. Dean Napier's
preaching has often seemed to
confuse the very difficult distinc
tion — but a distinction which
must, for the sake of morality
and religion, be made — between
the political and the moral as
pects of a question. The political
must not be emphasized at the
expense of the moral.
It has always been a principle
duty (if not always an ecclesias
tically approved goal) of the
minister to encourage among
his congregation the develop
ment of a critical, independent
personal conscience capable of
guiding the individual in his
practical behavior according to
the general precepts and ideals
of the morality he espouses.
It is because morality is so
largely a matter of personal con
science, of individually perceiv-

Ed right or wrong, that disagree
ments in good faith so often per
sist in questions of practical
morality. And it is because a
common morality can tolerate
differences of opinion in practi
cal matters, particularly a mor
ality based on the overriding
presence of love as an integrat
ing force, that religions, and in
particular Christianity, have
been able to be equally benefi
cial to those of, for example, dif
ferent political persuasions.
Maybe it would help to un
derstand more easily the differ
ence between the political and
the moral if one considered a
somewhat less emotion-charged
issue than one which involves
the shedding of human blood.
If the Christian morality de
manded one inescapable choice
of behavior in every political is
sue, then we would be forced
to consider sinful the countless
numbers who have taken th 1
"immoral" stands in political
questions from the War on Pov
erty to tariff legislation. It
should follow from the realiza
tion that morality can be con
sistent with differing political
views that a clergyman may di
lute his religious appeal and
lessen the impact of his moral
admonitions by tying them too
closely to a political opinion.
When The Arena asks Dean
Napier to concentrate more on
man's personal relation to Christ
and less on political advocacy, I
think it desires not that Dean
Napier cease to remind his con
gregation that political concern
is a moral responsibility, but
that he cease to prejudice his
ministry by his dogmatic and,
to many, highly alienating poli
tical intepretation of Christian
ity.

The Academic Council, in its
action regarding Activity Cre
dits last Friday, has certainly
taken action long needed at
Stanford University. The intent
of the Council's action — the eli
mination of the requirement to
participate in activities, includ
ing physical education courses
— seems, to me, to be in the
highest sense a recognition of
the ability of a student to de
cide upon his own educational
goals.
However it appears that the
Council did not fully and care
fully consider the wording of fts
resolution. What the Academic
Council abolished was activity
credits, what it ought to have
abolished was the need for ac
tivity credits.
This is particularly important
in regards to physical education
classes. I feel there is a place
at this University for supervis
ed, and educational, Physical Ed
ucation classes. However, being
no physical behemoth I enjoyed
taking such classes as a credit
class. As explained to me yes
terday by the General Studies
Office, and confirmed with Uni
versity Registrar Harvey Hall,
however, Physical Education
classes are now only offered as
one unit academic courses. Thus
the student who desires to take
such a class for pure enjoyment
must dip into his quota of 27
pass-fail units, or must receive
the consent of the instructor and
audit the course, sometimes dif
ficult, if he wishes to avoid re
ceiving a grade translated into
