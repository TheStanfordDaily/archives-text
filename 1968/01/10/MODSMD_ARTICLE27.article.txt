# Today And Tomorrow
## Times Have Changed 
### WALTER LIPPMANN (Second of two parts) 
There are reasons for thinking that the time
has come when the Roosevelt coalition is worn
out and a new coalition is waiting to be
formed.
In some respects the situation resembles the
year 1912 when the Republican coalition which
had dominated American politics since the
Civil War broke apart. Like the Republicans
in 1912, the Democrats today are deepiy di
vided among themselves. Mr. Wilson, who was
the beneficiary of the Republican split in 1912,
did not put together a durable Democratic
coalition. The final Republican crack-up took
place under Mr. Hoover in 1932 in the midst
of the Great Depression. In the aftermath
Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s put together
the Democratic coalition which has dominated
American politics ever since.
Today on the eve of the 1968 election year
certain things are clear. One of them is that
the Democrats are split over the war and the
personality of Lyndon Johnson.
Another is really more significant for the
future: it is that the Roosevelt coalition is
worn out and no longer represents the reali
ties of the present age. The true believer in
the New Deal philosophy and program is to
day an old-fashioned fellow who has not kept
up with the times.
LBJ Of The New Deal
It is an accident that, at the time when the
New Deal has become obsolete, the President
in the White House should be a man whose
political ideas are hand-me-downs from the
New Deal. It is an accident, too, that, having
vowed he would not do it, he has involved the
country in a frustrating war. And it is also
an accident that he is personally unlikable.
Had none of these accidents happened, the
outstanding fact of our time would still be
that the old Roosevelt coalition is dying and
that a new coalition is waiting to be formed.
There have been great changes since Mr.
Roosevelt put together his coalition in the
aftermath of the Great Depression.
The working class is no longer struggling,
as it was then, for employment and for ele
mentary rights and privileges in bargaining
about its wages and conditions of work. The
affluence which the expanding American econ
omy is producing has lifted a large part of the

working class to a standard of living which
has made it a part of the middle class.
And this has meant that the working class
which has been left behind, in the main the
Negroes, has little solidarity with and, in fact,
has a dangerous antagonism toward those who
have forged ahead.
In the upper class, among the managers
and owners of corporate industry, there has
been a revolutionary change of attitude since
the first appearance of big business. There
has been developing a remarkable sense of
obligations of power by the men who have
become used to the exercise of power. The
age of the robber barons and of the sweat
shop capitalists has passed away and in the
great modern corporate aggregations there is
a new generation of managers who realize
that they are part of a new form of social or
ganization.
The old concepts of the economists and of
the reformers do not fit the facts any longer.
They do not describe these men who conduct
enterprises which are a mixture of public and
private participation and who have learned
that while they must work for private profit
they must serve the public welfare.
In their leadership and in their political or
ganization today, neither of the two parties
truly reflects and represents these momentous
changes in the dominant forces of our society.
But if self-government is to work through
political means, one party must come to re
flect and represent the realities of contempor
ary life. It must be in tune with what has
happened since the 19305.
I do not myself think that the Democrats
can do this now. For with Lyndon Johnson as
President they have alienated irreparably the
intellectual community and the young voters,
and without them the Democratic Party does
not have the brains or the energy for the
task of representing the new age.
For this reason I do not think that the
crucial question for 1968 is what McCarthy
and Sen. Robert Kennedy do, important and
interesting and significant as that may be,
certainly for the future. The crucial question
is whether the Republicans, who are still dis
traught by their ideological caper in 1964, can
pull themselves together and seize an historic
opportunity which is now theirs for the taking.

that a new coalition is waiting to be formed.
There have been great changes since Mr.
Roosevelt put together his coalition in the
aftermath of the Great Depression.
The working class is no longer struggling,
as it was then, for employment and for ele
mentary rights and privileges in bargaining
about its wages and conditions of work. The
affluence which the expanding American econ
omy is producing has lifted a large part of the

working class to a standard of living which
has made it a part of the middle class.
And this has meant that the working class
which has been left behind, in the main the
Negroes, has little solidarity with and, in fact,
has a dangerous antagonism toward those who
have forged ahead.
In the upper class, among the managers
and owners of corporate industry, there has
been a revolutionary change of attitude since
the first appearance of big business. There
has been developing a remarkable sense of
obligations of power by the men who have
become used to the exercise of power. The
age of the robber barons and of the sweat
shop capitalists has passed away and in the
great modern corporate aggregations there is
a new generation of managers who realize
that they are part of a new form of social or
ganization.
The old concepts of the economists and of
the reformers do not fit the facts any longer.
They do not describe these men who conduct
enterprises which are a mixture of public and
private participation and who have learned
that while they must work for private profit
they must serve the public welfare.
In their leadership and in their political or
ganization today, neither of the two parties
truly reflects and represents these momentous
changes in the dominant forces of our society.
But if self-government is to work through
political means, one party must come to re
flect and represent the realities of contempor
ary life. It must be in tune with what has
happened since the 19305.
I do not myself think that the Democrats
can do this now. For with Lyndon Johnson as
President they have alienated irreparably the
intellectual community and the young voters,
and without them the Democratic Party does
not have the brains or the energy for the
task of representing the new age.
For this reason I do not think that the
crucial question for 1968 is what McCarthy
and Sen. Robert Kennedy do, important and
interesting and significant as that may be,
certainly for the future. The crucial question
is whether the Republicans, who are still dis
traught by their ideological caper in 1964, can
pull themselves together and seize an historic
opportunity which is now theirs for the taking.

There are reasons for thinking that the time
has come when the Roosevelt coalition is worn
out and a new coalition is waiting to be
formed.
In some respects the situation resembles the
year 1912 when the Republican coalition which
had dominated American politics since the
Civil War broke apart. Like the Republicans
in 1912, the Democrats today are deepiy di
vided among themselves. Mr. Wilson, who was
the beneficiary of the Republican split in 1912,
did not put together a durable Democratic
coalition. The final Republican crack-up took
place under Mr. Hoover in 1932 in the midst
of the Great Depression. In the aftermath
Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s put together
the Democratic coalition which has dominated
American politics ever since.
Today on the eve of the 1968 election year
certain things are clear. One of them is that
the Democrats are split over the war and the
personality of Lyndon Johnson.
Another is really more significant for the
future: it is that the Roosevelt coalition is
worn out and no longer represents the reali
ties of the present age. The true believer in
the New Deal philosophy and program is to
day an old-fashioned fellow who has not kept
up with the times.
LBJ Of The New Deal
It is an accident that, at the time when the
New Deal has become obsolete, the President
in the White House should be a man whose
political ideas are hand-me-downs from the
New Deal. It is an accident, too, that, having
vowed he would not do it, he has involved the
country in a frustrating war. And it is also
an accident that he is personally unlikable.
Had none of these accidents happened, the
outstanding fact of our time would still be
that the old Roosevelt coalition is dying and

happened since the 19305.
I do not myself think that the Democrats
can do this now. For with Lyndon Johnson as
President they have alienated irreparably the
intellectual community and the young voters,
and without them the Democratic Party does
not have the brains or the energy for the
task of representing the new age.
For this reason I do not think that the
crucial question for 1968 is what McCarthy
and Sen. Robert Kennedy do, important and
interesting and significant as that may be,
certainly for the future. The crucial question
is whether the Republicans, who are still dis
traught by their ideological caper in 1964, can
pull themselves together and seize an historic
opportunity which is now theirs for the taking.
