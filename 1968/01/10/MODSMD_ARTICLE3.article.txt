# Reagan Urges Tax Revision As Part Of Creative Society

### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagan urged legislators Tues
day to enact his "Creative So
ciety" blueprint for solving Cal
ifornia problems without over
burdening "the forgotten man
. . . the taxpayer."
The Republican chief execu
tive asked a joint legislative ses
sion to "join with me . . . join
together" in immediate action
to cope with day to day ills of
the nation's most populous state
—from smog to campus disturb
ances to crime in the streets.
"These issues cannot wait for
another year . . . There is no
time, there is no room, there is
no defense, for the personal
squabble or the partisan ob
struction," Reagan declared in
his second "state of the state"
message.
Revised Tax Structure
The main issue, he said, is re
vision of the state tax structure
for the first time in 35 years.
But he will fight any proposed
tax raises this year, the gover
nor added.
His 35-minute speech was
greeted by silence, except for a
brief laugh at a joke and a
smatter of applause once later
on. However, the lawmakers
and Reagan's wife Nancy —
watching from the public gal

lery — gave him the usual stand
ing ovation at the end.
Reagan's theme was that Cali
fornia must solve the same wide
range of problems which con
front an increasingly urbanized
society nationally. Society does
have a responsibility to care for
the poor and the ill and meet
demands for services from every
one, he said.

"There is also another respon
sibility ... to the taxpayer, the
too-often forgotten man, who
today is working 2*4 hours out
of every eight-hour day just to
pay his taxes. This Is the citi
zen who has no special pressure
group to lobby for him. He
works and sweats to make ends
meet, to pay his bills and keep

his family in clothes and his
kids in school," he added.
He spent much time on what
he has said will be the "um
brella" issue of the coming na
tional campaign — morality, es
pecially in the broad field of
crime.
Reagan told students and
teachers causing unrest on state

campuses to "obey the rules, or
get out. Our colleges and univer
sities were created ... as cen
ters of education — not staging
areas for insurrection."
On taxes and spending, Rea
gan declared "There is still much
to be done . . . We will continue
to cut and squeeze and trim . . .
We should bear in mind that our
fiscal problems will be just as
tough this year as they were last
year."
He promised, however, that af
ter last year's $1 billion tax
raise "we will not ask for in
creased taxes, indeed we shall
oppose any such suggestion."
He noted that the 1967 session
set aside $155 million for local
property tax relief and "we in
tend to keep that promise." He
said he would propose giving the
relief "through our educational
system. One way is by assum
ing the local property tax burden
of the junior colleges. Another is
through the secondary system."
He also said he will honor the
1967 commitment to a $22 mil
lion property tax break for eld
erly homeowners, and will try
to make a start on eliminating
the business inventory tax.
Reagan again said a restruc
turing of the California taxation
system will be his key goal, and
it must be done now. "We . . .
have a crazy-quilt structure
which is neither equitable nor
effective," the governor remark
ed.
Democratic Assembly Speaker
Jesse M. Unruh of Inglewood
said again, however, that Rea
gan can't hope to get his tax
reform through the Democratic
controlled Assembly without in
cluding withholding of personal
income taxes. Reagan, who has
opposed withholding, did not
mention it in the speech.
Order and Safety
The governor also revealed he
is drawing up proposals "which
will deal with . . . campus disor
der — including trespass legis
lation to keep the disruptive non
student and the troublemakers
from interfering with the order
ly process of education."
He also said he will propose
legislation including "the right of
our law officers to use electronic
surveilance equipment under
the proper control of judicial
warrants."
Reagan also stressed highway
safety, including a pilot program
"to develop the best vehicle in
spection system in the country."
He called for tougher laws
against pornography and narco
tics peddlers and drunken driv
ers.
For those who don't share in
all of society's benefits in 20th
century America, Reagan de
clared he "will never abandon
. . . proper responsibilities to the
needy and the unfortunate . . .
We will continue to attend to
those needs with compassion but
under the proper fiscal control.
We will help those who need
help — and we will expect them
to do their best to help them
selves."
GOP Senate Leader Donald
Grunsky of Watsonville, said
Reagan's program "is realistic
and capable of enactment with
only one problem: That is if
Democrats involve us in parti
san manuvering."
The chairman of the Assem
bly GOP caucus, Don Hulford
of Piedmont, said the legislature
would have to help Reagan solve
the state's problems, "as temp
ting as it may be for the majori
ty party to embarrass the gov
ernor by playing politics with
his program."
