NEW YORK (AP) —The Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation is thinking about its own
football Super Bowl to compete
with the pros for the television
dollar.
"This is Just one of the sev
eral proposals submitted," Paul
Brechler, commissioner of the
Western Athletic Conference,
said Monday after the first
meeting of the nine-man NCAA
committee named a year ago to
study the feasibility of a college
football championship playoff.
"Our purpose is to find out if
there is a workable plan and, if
so, to submit it to the conven
tion a year from now. If it's
found impractical, that's the
report we'll make."
If a playoff plan is devised
and accepted, Brechler, chair
man of the committee said, it
could be put into effect the fall
of 1969.
$10 Million
Brechler denied that escalat
ing television monies were a fac
tor in the NCAA's playoff inter
est but added:
"We have to be practical. We
know there would be television
considerations. I have heard $10
million mentioned, but I
wouldn't think of estimating
what such games might be
worth."
One of the questions of the
proposed plan for picking an
official college grid champion is
whether the playoffs could be
held within the framework of
the present bowl games.
"One proposal is that we hold
the two semifinal games on Jan.
1 at two of the bowls, —alternat-
ing them each year, and then
have the final game a week
later," Brechler said. Some al
roady have dubbed the title
game the NCAA's Super Bowl.
"Other suggestions are that
we hold the playoffs the first
three weeks in December and

have them over before New
Year's," Brechler added, "But
some insist this would take the
lustre off the bowls."
Bowls Object
The committee chairman said
the American Football Coaches
Association, the official body of
college coaches, had expressed
favor for a football playoff.
There have been objections
from other sources he said.
The Southeastern, Big Ten
and Pacific Eight Conferences
are known to be strongly op
posed to a playoff that would
endanger the bowls. The bowls
themselves are lobbying aaginst
the plan.
The group will meet again
Feb. 26-27.
Punt Return Role
Jack Curtice, athletic director
of the University of California
at Santa Barbara and secretary
of the coaches, rules committee,
reported that coaches were in
favor of going back to the 1966
punt return rule, permitting all
players to go down field after
the snap, and also anxious to
retain the present free substi
tution rule.
