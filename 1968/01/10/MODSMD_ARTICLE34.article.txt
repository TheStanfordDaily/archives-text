# Swimmers' Toughest Foe Is Our Own 'Little' Frosh
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's freshman swim
ming team launches a long-an
ticipated challenge against the
NCAA champion varsity Satur
day, 10 a.m., in the Encina Pool.
The Papooses, unquestionably
the strongest freshman contin
gent in Stanford history, have
been hailed as one of the deep
est and most powerful in NCAA
annals. The frosh boast 14 High
School All-Americans.
John Ferris is one of many
reasons why the frosh think
the varsity might swallow its
pride Saturday. Ferris smashed
Mark Spitz's world record in
the 200 meter butterfly to win
a gold medal at the World Stu
dent Games In Tokyo last Aug
ust. Ferris took second in the
400 individual medley and sixth
in the 200 IM in the US Outdoor
AAU championships last sum
mer.
Fred Heywood is the defend
ing Indoor AAU 100 backstroke
champion at 52.6. Haywood shat
tered the national high school
100 backstroke record, followed
closely by Santa Clara and now
Stanford teammate Mitch Ivey.

Haywood has also hit 1:46 for
200 freestyle and 47 in a 400
free relay.
Ivey, who represented the US
in the World Student Games,
took fourth in the Indoor AAU
200 backstroke in 1:56.7.
Brent Berk traveled with the
US national team through
Europe last summer after
taking fourth in the AAU 400
meter freestyle and sixth in the
200 free. His meters times cor
respond to a 4:41 500 yard free
style and a 1:43 200.
Fastest Sprinters Ever
Bob Jamison and Rick Eagle
ston hope to continue the sprint
domination they exercised in
high school Jamison shattered
the national high school 100
freestyle record by more than a
second when he led off Santa
Clara's record-setting 400 free
relay in 46.6.
Eagleston, whose 47.4 also
beat the high school record,
hit 46.9 in that relay.
Joe Welsh hit 52.6 for 100 but
terfly last season and took sec
ond to Eagleston in the CIF
championships.
Ted Nichols soared over 400

points in diving five times dur
ing the 1967 season.
Freshman breaststrokers
Kenn Terry and Bob Brower hit
1:02.5 for 100 yards last year.
Tag Leonard went under the
2:20 barrier in the 200 breast
last weekend.
Kim Lintner, Ray Collins,
Jamie Knoor, Rob Jensen, Paul
Sagues, John Glaser, Larry
Meyer, and Rick Gustadt give
the frosh depth to burn in the
sprint freestyle events. All have
gone faster than 23.0 for 50
free and most faster than 50.0
for 100.
Bert Mason will give Berk
solid backing in distance free
style, after hitting 4:01 for 400
yards last week.
Blood!
Asked what would be the fate
of the Stanford varsity on Sat
urday, Ferris replied cogently,
"Blood." Eagleston expanded on
Ferris' comemntary, declaring
"More blood." Nearby Pete Sie
bert yawned noticeably.


THE MAIN THING â€” Stanford diver Bill Main performs a forward three and a half somersault
from the three meter board in this scene from last Saturday's meet with Canadian champs Simon
Fraser College. The Tribe swimmers will have a much tougher fight on their hands when they take
on the Stanford frosh this weekend.
