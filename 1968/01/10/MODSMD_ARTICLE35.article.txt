â€” Billy Casper, who just won
the Southern California Open,
goes into the Bing Crosby Pro-
Amateur Golf tourney Thursday
with hopes of becoming the first
pro to win it three times.
Paired with young Bob Dick
son, the U.S. and British ama
teur champion, Casper also
could become only the fourth
golfer ever to win both the pro
and pro-amateur divisions of the
tourney.
National Open champion Jack
Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Cas
per and most of the other big
names of golf have arrived for
practice rounds.
With the "luck of the Crosby,"
gale warnings were posted Tues
day for northern California. The
storm was moving south toward
the Monterey Peninsula, where
the tournament is played over
three courses.
It's traditional for a storm to

hit the Crosby tournament. Last
year, a gale on the third day
forced a postponement and
Nicklaus' victory came on Mon
day instead of the usual Sunday.
Bing's $104,500 event will be
played over three courses, and
all have been pronounced in
their best condition by Jack Tut
hill, PGA tournament director.
The field of 168 pros and 168
amateurs will rotate among the
three courses the first three
days. Then the pros and pro
amateur teams which survive
the 54-hole cut play Sunday for
the $16,000 pro first prize and
$2,700 top payoff in the pro-am.
Casper with 289 was runnerup
last year to Nicklaus' 284, with
Palmer third at 291 after a dis
astrous 9 on the 14th hole.
Casper won in 1958 with 277
and in 1963 with 285. He's never
won the pro-am.
Palmer, after 12 Crosby's, nev
er has won here. He's been in
the top five only three times.
