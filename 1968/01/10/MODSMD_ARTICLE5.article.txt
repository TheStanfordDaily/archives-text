# $190 Billion
## Higher Budget Seen 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In
creased domestic spending al
ready written into law, and
higher military costs, reported
ly will boost total federal out
lays in the next fiscal year to
$190 billion or beyond.
An informed source reporting
this Tuesday noted that the fig
ure isn't exactly comparable
with past budgets since the ad
ministration will use this year
for the first time a unified bud

get format which lumps all
spending together, including
that of the huge government-op
erated trust funds such as So
cial Security.
But one official said spending
in the administrative budget—il
that were still in use—would
range between $145 billion and
$150 billion in the estimates now
scheduled to be sent to Congress
Jan. 29.
This is substantially above the
$136 billion to $137 billion in ad
ministrative budget spending
expected in the current fiscal
year ending June 30 but one
source said the increase stems
from higher defense costs and
the increased cost of existing
federal programs such as wel
fare, medicare and pay raises
fof government workers.
Exact budget figures have not
yet been revealed but adminis
tration officials now know into
what range they will fall, al
though some decisions must still
be made by President Johnson.
While spending in the new
budget will be higher than in
the current year, the source said
it will definitely remain below
$200 billion under the new uni
fied budget format.
If the budget for the current
fiscal year had been presented

to Congress last January under
the new system it would have
called for spending $175.5 bil
lion.
But even this figure is not
quite comparable with the $190
billion range now mentioned
since it would include increased
Social Security benefits as of
last July 1.
Under the administrative
budget which has been in use
for years, spending rose above
$100 biUion for the first time in
the fiscal year that end<*d June
30, 1966. It went to $126.7 billion
the following year and is now
estimated at $136.2 billion in the
current fiscal year.
If the new concept had been
in use in the past, total federal
spending would have exceeded
$100 billion for the first time in
the fiscal year which ended
June 30, 1962. It could exceed
$200 billion the next time
around but not this coming
fiscal year.
As for a deficit, that's still un
determined since the Treasury
Department reportedly has not
yet come up with a firm esti
mate of revenue expectations.
Officials are figuring on adop
tion of Johnson's proposed 10
per cent tax surcharge in pre
paring the new budget.
