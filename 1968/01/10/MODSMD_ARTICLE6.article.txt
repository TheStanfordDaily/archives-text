# US Anticipates New Red Drive

SAIGON (AP) — Despite
massive American bombard
ments and ground operations,
U.S. Marine officers figure North
Vietnam is capable today of
launching another major offen
sive against South Vietnam's
northern frontier.
A new Red drive is considered
likely in the Ist Corps area this
spring with dissipation of the
northeast monsoon storm clouds
now blanketing the frontier.
Sizable units of the enemy op
erating in the five northern
provinces and others across the
DMZ are considered in Da Nang,
the Marine headquarters, to pose
the new threat.
With 25,000 North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong troops reported
in the two northernmost prov
inces, Quang Tri and Thua
Thien, it appears likely the Ma
rines will move soon to reinforce
those provinces with additional
maneuver battalions. These are
highly mobile units.
Two Sources
Additional maneuver battal
lions would not necessarily
mean fresh troops from the
United States. They likely would
come from two sources:
—From static defensive out
posts such as Con Thien, which
South Vietnamese forces are
taking over from the Marines.
—From Marine units now
based south of Da Nang in the
three lower provinces of the
corps area. The Marine areas of
responsibility below Da Nang
have been gradually taken up

by Army brigades of the U.S.
Americal Division and a brigade
of Korean marines.
Marine intelligence sources es
timate Communist troops
strength in all the Ist Corps
area at 50,000 men—33,ooo main
force and 17,000 guerrillas.
American and other allied ele
ments total more than 100,000.
Enemy Attack Airfield
Elsewhere in the war:
In action yesterday, Commu
nist forces crept onto an Ameri
can airfield in the central high

lands before dawn, blew up sev
eral airplanes and left 7 Ameri
cans dead and 25 wounded.
The U.S. Command said 11
enemy attackers were killed at
Kontum Airfield, about 275 miles
northeast of Saigon. Some of the
enemy were killed by explosions
from their own satchel charges.
Kontum Airfield is used by
elements of the U.S. Army's
173 rd Airborne Brigade and by
an aviation unit.
U.S. defenders exchanged
small-arms fire with Communist

troops while enemy units placed
and detonated explosive charges
during the 20-minute attack.
Third Airfield Attack
The attack at Kontum was the
third on allied airfields In the
last week in one of the war's
biggest Communist offensives
against allied installations. A
week ago, Communist gunners
slammed more than 40 rounds of
122 mm rockets into the sprawl
ing Da Nar.g fighter base, de
stroying 3 airplanes and dam
aging 24.
