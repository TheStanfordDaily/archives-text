### 
(AP) â€” Gov. Spiro T. Agnew
of Maryland announced Tues
day that he will spearhead a
drive 4n the state to draft Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller of New York
as the Republican presidential
candidate.
Agnew, who has consistenly
urged the New York governor to
run for the Republican nomina
tion, said he made his decision
"in response to the groundswell
of public opinion that I have
seen developing. .
"I have been particularly im
pressed," he said by the many
business, professional and in
dustrial leaders, who are not ac

tive in politics, but who think
Gov. Rockefeller is the best
qualified person in the United
States to be president and have
expressed a willingness to lend
their names on a draft-Rocke
feller movement."
Rockefeller reaffirmed hi s
support for Michigan Gov.
George Romney for the nom
ination today but said he would
back Richard M. Nixon if Nixon
should be named the GOP
standard-bearer against Presi
dent Johnson.
At the same time, Rockefeller
told a radio-TV panel he "had
no desire" to become personally
involved in the race for the Re

publican nomination and said he
believed that party unity was
essential.
He commented in the wake of
polls that show him as the Re
publican with the best chance of
beating Johnson next Novem
ber.
Under questioning, Rockefel
ler said that "only as a last re
sort" would he agree to be the
favorite-son candidate for New
York's 92-member delegation to
the Republican national conven
tion.
Asked whether he intended to
have a "solid delegation,"
Rockefeller replied with a
smile, "Yes, sir."
