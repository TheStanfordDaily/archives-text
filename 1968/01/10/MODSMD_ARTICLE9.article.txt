## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — As
sembly Sp aker Jesse M. Unruh
gave his fellow Democrats new
advantages Tuesday in assign
ments for the lower house's 26
committees.

Republicans lost two commit
tee chairmanships and were de
moted from one other post,
while Democrats kept their pow
er In major jobs and increased

it on the crucial Ways and
Means Committee.
The Democratic margin on the
Assembly's finance committee
was increased from 10-9 to 11-8,
raising the hurdle for some of
Gov. Reagan's major legislation
such as tax reform or the 1968-69
budget.
Unruh, D-Inglewood, said Mon
day he was "willing to forgive,
if not to forget" the Republicans
united but unsuccessful effort to
unseat him.
GOP Assemblyman Demoted
The speaker demoted one GOP
spearhead of the drive, Assem
blyman Robert E. Badham, R-
Newport Beach, from chairman
ship of the Public Utilities and
Corporations Committee to head
of the Legislative Representa
tion Committee, which approves
lobbyists' credentials.
Assemblyman Charles J. Con
rad, R-Sherman Oaks, was drop
ped as chairman of the Inter
state Cooperation Committee
and replaced by Democratic As
semblyman Charles Warren of
Los Angeles.
Unruh said Conrad, who often
challenged the speaker in de
bate, showed "little interest in
interstate cooperation . . . and
had difficulty in getting along
with my administration."
Another Republican, Assem
blyman E. Richard Barnes of
San Diego, lost his chairman
ship because Unruh eliminated
Barnes' Retirement System Com
mittee.
Republicans retained chair
manships of the important Rev
enue and Taxation, Criminal
Procedure and Judiciary com
mittees. But Unruh promoted a
liberal, Assemblyman Willie L.
Brown, Jr., D-San Francisco, to
the head of the Governmental
Efficiency and Economy Com
mittee, which considered bills in
troduced last year to modify or
repeal the Rumford open hous
ing law. He succeeds Democrat
Lester A. McMillan, D-Los Ange
les.
