# Rap Brown Gets Refuge In Cuba's U.N. Mission
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — Black
Power militant H. Rap Brown
took sanctuary inside the Cuban
Mission to the United Nations
for nearly six hours Wednesday
night, after a policeman sought
to arrest him during a pushing
incident on the street outside.
At 10:45 p.m., Brown, an aide
and a girl walked quietly from
the mission, got into a waiting
cab and drove off to an undis
closed destination.

Brown had told a newsman
earlier by telephone: "This hap
pened on mission territory. My
rights are in a gun . . . They had
no right to question me."
The Cuban U.N. delegation
sent a protest note to U.N. Sec
retary-General U Thant com
plaining of the behavior of New
York police. The note came
from Jesus Jimenez, charge
d'affaires of the Cuban delega
tion. The contents were not
made public.
Stopped Outside
Just before leaving, Brown
stopped outside the door of the
mission for a few minutes to tell
newsmen the day's events were
the "action of the Gestapo po
lice" and "instigated by May
or Lindsay and President John
son."
"It is an action to crush dis
sent and to crush governments
who dissent from this country's
policies," he said. "Nobody is
secure in this country. We came
in as guests and we serve notice
again that if white people are
going to play Nazis, black folks
ain't goin' play Jews."
Two policemen standing
guard outside the mission
moved aside to let Brown speak.
They said they were usually sta
tioned there and were not in
volved in the incident with
Brown.
Earlier, Police Capt. William
Lakeman was barred by the
mission's claim of diplomatic
immunity when he tried to enter
the building on Manhattan's up

per East Side. He then held a
sidewalk consultation outside
with Brown's lawyer, Stephen
Hyman.
It was decided that the com
plaining officer, Patrolman
Richard Gleason, would obtain
a summons in night court,
charging Brown with "harass
ment" of a police officer, a
criminal charge.
This could be served on the
24-year-old firebrand leader of
the Student Nonviolent Coordin
ating Committee at any time,
without requiring a physical
confrontation and arrest.
Lakeman said the incident be
gan as Brown and an aide, Bob
Smith, emerged from a visit to
the mission shortly before 5
p.m. In the vestibule, Lakeman
said, Brown in passing pushed
Gleason, who was in uniform
and on routine guard duty at the
building.
Gleason followed the two
Negroes to the street, where Pa
trolman Alfred Smith, also in
uniform, was maintaining a
post.
Brown was said to have been
carrying a package and Gleason
asked: "What have you got
there?"
"Why don't you mind your
own business and go away?"
Brown was quoted by the police
man as replying.
Gleason said a shoving match
ensued as he tried to take
Brown and Smith into custody.
No punches were exchanged,
and the two Negroes ran back
inside the mission, while an

armed mission guard held the
door open for them.
Succeeded C&rmichael
Brown last April succeeded
Stokeley Carmichael, another
Black Power advocate, as chair
man of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee. Car
michael's passport was lifted
recently when he returned from
a visit to North Vietnam.
One of the most outspoken of
the Black Power militants,
Brown has called for "guerrilla
war" by Negroes against
whites, and the "burning down"
of cities where Negroes feel
they are discriminated against.
He is free on $10,000 bond in
an indictment charging him
with inciting to riot and arson
last July in Cambridge, Md.
While under that indictment,
he is accused of violating feder
al law by flying from New Or
leans to New York with a car
bine in his possession. He has
pleaded innocent to the federal
charge and is free on bond from
New Orleans.

with Brown's lawyer, Stephen
Hyman.
It was decided that the com
plaining officer, Patrolman
Richard Gleason, would obtain
a summons in night court,
charging Brown with "harass
ment" of a police officer, a
criminal charge.
This could be served on the
24-year-old firebrand leader of
the Student Nonviolent Coordin
ating Committee at any time,
without requiring a physical
confrontation and arrest.
Lakeman said the incident be
gan as Brown and an aide, Bob
Smith, emerged from a visit to
the mission shortly before 5
p.m. In the vestibule, Lakeman
said, Brown in passing pushed
Gleason, who was in uniform
and on routine guard duty at the
building.
Gleason followed the two
Negroes to the street, where Pa
trolman Alfred Smith, also in
uniform, was maintaining a
post.
Brown was said to have been
carrying a package and Gleason
asked: "What have you got
there?"
"Why don't you mind your
own business and go away?"
Brown was quoted by the police
man as replying.
Gleason said a shoving match
ensued as he tried to take
Brown and Smith into custody.
No punches were exchanged,
and the two Negroes ran back
inside the mission, while an

armed mission guard held the
door open for them.

Brown last April succeeded
Stokeley Carmichael, another
Black Power advocate, as chair
man of the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee. Car
michael's passport was lifted

One of the most outspoken of
the Black Power militants,
Brown has called for "guerrilla
war" by Negroes against
whites, and the "burning down"
of cities where Negroes feel
they are discriminated against.
He is free on $10,000 bond in

with inciting to riot and arson

NEW YORK (AP) — Black
Power militant H. Rap Brown
took sanctuary inside the Cuban
Mission to the United Nations
for nearly six hours Wednesday
night, after a policeman sought
to arrest him during a pushing
incident on the street outside.
At 10:45 p.m., Brown, an aide
and a girl walked quietly from
the mission, got into a waiting
cab and drove off to an undis
closed destination.

Brown had told a newsman
earlier by telephone: "This hap
pened on mission territory. My
rights are in a gun . . . They had
no right to question me."
The Cuban U.N. delegation
sent a protest note to U.N. Sec
retary-General U Thant com
plaining of the behavior of New
York police. The note came
from Jesus Jimenez, charge
d'affaires of the Cuban delega
tion. The contents were not
made public.
Stopped Outside
Just before leaving, Brown
stopped outside the door of the
mission for a few minutes to tell
newsmen the day's events were
the "action of the Gestapo po
lice" and "instigated by May
or Lindsay and President John
son."
"It is an action to crush dis
sent and to crush governments
who dissent from this country's
policies," he said. "Nobody is
secure in this country. We came
in as guests and we serve notice
again that if white people are
going to play Nazis, black folks
ain't goin' play Jews."
Two policemen standing
guard outside the mission
moved aside to let Brown speak.
They said they were usually sta
tioned there and were not in
volved in the incident with
Brown.
Earlier, Police Capt. William
Lakeman was barred by the
mission's claim of diplomatic
immunity when he tried to enter
the building on Manhattan's up

per East Side. He then held a
