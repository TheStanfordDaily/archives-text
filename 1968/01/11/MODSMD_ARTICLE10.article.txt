# Counterfeiting Ring Smashed, Phony $4.1 Million Seized
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP)—A mam
moth counterfeit operation, lar
gest in the nation's history, was
reported smashed Wednesday,
before ring members could un
load $50 million in fake $10, $20
and $100 bills. Samples were
available for inspection by pros
pective' buyers.
Already in the hands of feder
al officials were $4.1 million
worth of the fake $100 bills,
packaged in ordinary cardboard
boxes and seized Dec. 29 at Ken
nedy Airport. Authorities said
they were being shipped to a

buyer, who had agreed to pay 10
cents on the dollar — or more
than $400,000 — for them.
Three men were arrested, one
in New York and two in Ohio.
The man seized in New York,
Joel Lee, a Miami Beach, Fla.,
lawyer, was described by federal
authorities as salesman and traf
fic manager for the ring. The
other two were accused of print
ing the money, none of which,
apparently, got into circulation.
Further arrests were forecast
by Albert E. Whitaker, agent in
charge of the Secret Service in
New York.

The Kennedy Airport seizure
was the largest haul of phony
money in the history of the Sec
ret Service, surpassing the 1963
recovery in San Francisco of $2
million in counterfeit $20 and
$50 Federal Reserve notes.
The Kennedy Airport counter
feits were described as "pass
able" reproductions of regular
$100 bills, which bear the pic
ture of Benjamin Franklin.
"I don't think New York was
their final destination," Whitak.
er said, "although the bills were
good enough to try to pass them
here."

He speculated that the $4.1
million was destined for over
seas.
Lee, 39, father of three chil
dren, was arrested Tuesday
night at Kennedy Airport, while
returning to Florida. He was
held in $25,000 bail by U.S. Com
missioner Max Schiffman on
charges of possession, sale and
delivery of the $4.1 million in
counterfeits.
Ten Cents Per Dollar
At Lee's bail hearing, Asst.
U.S. Atty. Raymond B. Grune
wald said the defendant had ne
gotiated with one Dennis Lor
raine in New York, and worked
out a deal where the latter
would buy the $100 counterfeits
for 10 per cent.
Lee was said by Grunewald to
have provided Lorraine with 221
sample bills in advance, so he
could examine their quality.
Lorraine was not identified
beyond his name, and was not
listed among defendants in the
case.
In 1966, the Secret Service
said, Lee was accused of trans
porting more than $300,000 in
counterfeit money from Florida
to Los Angeles, but the charges
later were dropped.
In Ohio, Secret Service agents
Wednesday arrested Louis Chris
tian, and James Clark, 28, of
Clinton, Ohio, at his job in Ak
ron. Both were charged with
printing counterfeit money.

New York, takes a look at the single largest seizure of counterfeit
money in the history of the Secret Service. Capture was made yes
terday at Kennedy International Airport. The money was the first
shipment in a deal for the purchase of an additional $50 million.

The man seized in New York,
Joel Lee, a Miami Beach, Fla.,
lawyer, was described by federal
authorities as salesman and traf
fic manager for the ring. The
other two were accused of print
ing the money, none of which,
apparently, got into circulation.
Further arrests were forecast
by Albert E. Whitaker, agent in
charge of the Secret Service in
New York.

The Kennedy Airport seizure
was the largest haul of phony
money in the history of the Sec
ret Service, surpassing the 1963
recovery in San Francisco of $2
million in counterfeit $20 and
$50 Federal Reserve notes.
The Kennedy Airport counter
feits were described as "pass
able" reproductions of regular
$100 bills, which bear the pic
ture of Benjamin Franklin.
"I don't think New York was
their final destination," Whitak.
er said, "although the bills were
good enough to try to pass them
here."

He speculated that the $4.1
million was destined for over
seas.
Lee, 39, father of three chil
dren, was arrested Tuesday
night at Kennedy Airport, while
returning to Florida. He was
held in $25,000 bail by U.S. Com
missioner Max Schiffman on
charges of possession, sale and
delivery of the $4.1 million in
counterfeits.

At Lee's bail hearing, Asst.
U.S. Atty. Raymond B. Grune
wald said the defendant had ne
gotiated with one Dennis Lor
raine in New York, and worked
out a deal where the latter
would buy the $100 counterfeits
for 10 per cent.
Lee was said by Grunewald to
have provided Lorraine with 221
sample bills in advance, so he
could examine their quality.
Lorraine was not identified
beyond his name, and was not
listed among defendants in the
case.
In 1966, the Secret Service
said, Lee was accused of trans
porting more than $300,000 in
counterfeit money from Florida
to Los Angeles, but the charges
later were dropped.
In Ohio, Secret Service agents
Wednesday arrested Louis Chris
tian, and James Clark, 28, of
Clinton, Ohio, at his job in Ak
ron. Both were charged with
printing counterfeit money.
