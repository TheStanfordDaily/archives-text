# Reagan's Next Tour Last' Says No Campaign Planned
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagan said Wednesday he
can't conceive of circumstances
under which he would campaign
in the primary elections for the
Republican presidential nomina
tion this year.
"No, I can't," Reagan said in
reply to a reporter's question
during his weekly news confer
ence. "I have no such inten
tion."

The governor said a GOP fund
raising trip he makes next week
is the last he plan's during the
1968 legislative session, expected
to last well into summer.
Reagan said he has done "ev
erything in the world" to halt
a write-in campaign on his be
half in the New Hampshire pri
mary election March 12 and has
no plan whatever to speak in
that state.
"I certainly wouldn't stick my
neck out in going there." Rea
gan said.
Reagan will be a favorite-son
candidate in the California pri
mary June 4, but insists he is
not a candidate for the nomina
tion. However, his name will be
entered in some "open" primar
ies such as Oregon and Wiscon
sin.
Reagan will speak at GOP
rallies and meetings in Tulsa,
Okla., Pittsburgh, Philadelphia
and St. Louis, Mo., next week.
These appearances were "built"

around Reagan's annual trip to
Washington D.C. to confer with
California members of Congress
he said.
Reagan raised an estimated
$1.5 million for the Republican
party by speaking in about a
dozen states during the last
three months of 1967. He consid
ered this work fulfilling his
"party chores" and denied it
was any effort to drum up na
tional interest in him as a pos
sible candidate.
