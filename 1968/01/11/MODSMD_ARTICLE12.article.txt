OAKLAND (AP) â€” A small
group of antidraft pickets
tramped around entrances to
the Oakland Army Induction
Center in the rain today.
There was no disturbance.
Army officers, who estimated the
number of pickets at 50 to 60,
said the pickets were not try

tees to the center. Three of the
eight busloads scheduled for to
day already were in.
Oakland police, who estimated
the number of pickets at about
30, said they had had no calls
for help. Last Nov. more than
250 pickets were arrested on
charges of disturbing the peace
while trying to prevent buses
from entering the induction cen

who had announced his inten

usual nrp-induction routine. Ar
my officers said he was coop
erating and had not expressed
to them any intentions of refus
ing induction.
Today's demonstration was
sponsored by the Committee for
Draft Resistance.
