# Franklin: Maoism Offers Pure Marx
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The Marxian vision, which is
"an alternative to the Utopian
society," has been altered to Pla
toism in the Soviet Union today,
stated Stanford English profes
sor H. Bruce Franklin last
night.
Speaking before an overflow
crowd at Tresidder, Franklin
elaborated his "Visions of the
Future in Fiction and Revolu
tion," saying that "Chinese
Communism is in striking con
trast to this . . ~ because it is
faithful to Marxism."
"It was Marx and Engels,"
Franklin pointed out, "who saw
the entire revolutionary process
as essentially a negative proc
ess."
But before this concept of the
future was evolved, man had to
gain a concept of time in which
"each historical instance was
recognizably different from the
other."
"Before the seventeenth cen
tury," Franklin stressed, "the
vision of history was without
historical process."
"But something new is hap
pening in More," stated Frank
lin. "We see in the opening
chapter of Utopia the first ex
tended description of capital
ism."
As "religious prophesy gave
way to future visions," fiction
gave way to science fiction, he
explained.
The writers "had to extrapo
late from the present change
into the future. They also had
to project the social change
which would result from this
technological change."
Marx, according to Franklin,
"suggests that any vision of a
better society might, in fact, be
counterrevolutionary."

Engels looked even more
closely at what writers with a
Utopian view of the future were
saying. "The more complete
ly (the writer's plans) were
worked out, the more they drif
ted off in fantasy," he said.
Marx, in his concept of dia
lectical materialism, felt that
the future existed, in fact, "in
the processes of the present."
Sranklin sees China's Cultural
Revolution as being directed
against the beliefs that have
arisen in the Soviet Union's re
vision of the Marx-Engels doc
trine.
"Mao argues change comes
from internal contradiction,"
saated Franklin.
Dave Harris will continue the
century 21 series this afternoon
with a speech at 4:15 in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium on "Human
Values in the Political Process."
