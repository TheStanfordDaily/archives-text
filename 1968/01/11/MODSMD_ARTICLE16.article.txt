## 
### 
Mayor Francess Dias of Palo
Alto termed the newest Univer
sity proposal for the solution of
che hospital problem "the most
promising of any alternative
presented previously."
However, a Palo Alto "hospi
tal study committee" noted the
financial aspect was "conspicu
ous by its absence."
Details of the newest Univer
sity proposal were contained in
a letter sent by President Wal
lace Sterling to Mayor Dias last
Tuesday.
According to the plan, the
University would assume com.

plete responsibility for the hos
pital buildings and land present
ly owned and leased by the city.
The hospital would then be
known as the Stanford Univer
sity Hospital and be under the
control of the university Board
of Trustees.
The plan would "guarantee
to the city that all beds current
ly being operated by the hospi
tal center will be continued in
operation" until "either new beds
are added to the present hospital
or a second hospital is opened
that serves Palo Alto."
The 220 beds in the present
city wing would remain open to
the community "with Palo Alto
residents having priority."
The proposal also contained
details of new staff arrange
ments. The hospital staff would

consist of both full.time medical
school faculty and community
physicians who are members of
the part-time "clinical faculty."
The present members of the
Palo Alto Medical staff would be
guaranteed continued staff mem
bership indefinitely. In addition
clinical faculty members could
designate "courtesy staff" for
physicians not affiliated with the
University .
Previously, the University
position was that after with
drawal from the joint operation,
it would not be committed to
provide for community medical
needs. Stanford wanted more in
dependence to give the medical
school latitude in its teaching
program.
