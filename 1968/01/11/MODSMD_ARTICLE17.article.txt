# Demonstrations Begin For Newton Resisters
## 
### 
Demonstrations in support of
Huey P. Newton and the five
men indicted in Boston for en.
couraging draft resistance will
be held today and tomorrow re
spectively.
The Newton demonstration
will take place at 8:45 a.m. at
the Alameda County Courthouse.
The other demonstration will
take place at the Federal Build
ing at noon.
The demonstration announce
ments came on a single mimeo
graphed page handed out at Tre
sidder Union yesterday after
noon after a Black Union noon
rally at White Memorial Plaza
discussing the Newton case.
Newton has been charged with
murder in Oakland in the fatal
shooting of a police officer and
the wounding of another.
The page was signed by three
groups: the American Revolu
tionary Movement, "Radical Cau.
cus" of the Peace and Freedom
Party, and the Ad Hoc Commit
tee to Support The Resistance
movement's leaders including
William Cloan Coffin and Dr.
Spock, who are charged with
aiding draft resisters.

None of the groups issuing the
page is a Stanford group. Bruce
Franklin, associate professor of
English and one of the leaders
of the Convocation of the Left,
told The Daily that he knew of
none of those organizations.
The Berkeley office of the
Peace and Freedom Party re
vealed that the caucus was a
new movement within the party
made up of individuals with un
specified goals.
A staffer at the Berkeley of
fice told The Daily that the new
group is an attempt by some of
the party's members to get the
party working actively.
John Saari of the local office
of the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) said that the "Ad
Hoc Committee" was formed at
a recent meeting in San Fran
cisco of SDS members. The two
other groups signing the sheet
presented it to the meeting of
the new group, which promptly
adopted it.
Saari said that a demonstra
tion is being considered for Dean
Rusk's visit to San Francisco
today.
