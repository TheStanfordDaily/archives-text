# Applications Deadline
## Self-Designed Majors Begin Soon 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The humanities and sciences
office has set a Feb. 16 deadline
for applications for the first
group of interdepartmental ma
jors under an experimental pro
gram approved by the Academic
Council Jan. 5.
Starting spring quarter, as
many as 20 undergraduates will
be studying under individual de
gree programs they designed for
themselves, drawing from the
offerings of several academic de
partments.
Fewer than a dozen applica
tion forms have been handed out
so far by the humanities and
science office. Only sophomores
and juniors can apply for the
program now, but freshmen will
be allowed to submit proposed
majors starting spring quarter.
Only 20 Students
Prof. Lawrence Ryan, asso
ciate dean of humanities and
sciences, said he hopes to have

small numbers of next year's se
niors, juniors and sophomores
engaged in the program by aut
umn quarter. Ryan designed the
interdepartmental "experiment"
last fall.
The Academic Council has
limited the experiment to 20 stu.
dents at any one time, so Ryan
doesn't anticipate approving that
number of degree proposals
from juniors and sophomores
immediately. "That would be un
fair to the present freshman
class," Ryan said.
The group of applicants who
submit their proposals by Feb.
16 will be notified of approval
or disapproval before spring
quarter pre-registration.
After that, interdepartmental
proposals will be considered on
a first-come, first-served basis.
An interdepartmental major,
according to Ryan, must have
a specific scholarly focus which
lies outside any of the regular

undergraduate degrees offered
by University departments.
In a memorandum describing
the experiment, Ryan cited two
actual proposals — one for study
leading to a bachelor's degree
in computer science, another for
linguistic sciences. Both drew
courses from several depart
ments.
No Random Selection
Any study which can be ac
commodated within the require
ments of an existing department
shouldn't be submitted as an in
terdepartmental proposal, Ryan
stressed.
Ryan anticipates that some
students will ask for an inter,
departmental degree for a course
of study which would actually
qualify as a major in one de
partment and a minor in an
other.
To apply for the experiment,
a student must submit a state
ment "explaining the rationale

for, including the educational
objectives of, his proposed inter
departmental program."
A descriptive leaflet warns, "It
should not be a random collec
tion of advanced courses."
An applicant must get three
professors from at least two dif
ferent departments to sponsor
his degree proposal, which must
list all the courses the student
plans to take for his custom
designed major. The three pro
fessors would serve as a super,
visory committee for the stu
dent's curriculum, along with a
person designated by the dean
of humanities and sciences.
General Studies requirements
will still apply for the interde
partmental degrees.
SES Trial
Application forms are avail
able at the humanities and sci
ence office in building one on the
Quad.

Ryan hopes that the trial pro
gram will encourage the d apart
ments to make their own degree
requirements more flexible. He
also speaks of the program as
a "trial" for various proposals
of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). The success or
failure of the interdepartmental
major experiment, Ryan sug
gests, will be important in eval
uating the SES proposals for
giving undergraduates much
more freedom in choosing their
studies.
The first interdepartmental de_
grees will be granted in June,
1969,.5 ix months before SES sub
mits its final report.
Ryan points out that formal
cross-disciplinary study is hard
ly new to Stanford. A special
graduate program has given in
terdepartmental degrees to ad
vanced scholars for ten years.

be allowed to submit proposed
majors starting spring quarter.
Only 20 Students
Prof. Lawrence Ryan, asso
ciate dean of humanities and
sciences, said he hopes to have

small numbers of next year's se
niors, juniors and sophomores
engaged in the program by aut
umn quarter. Ryan designed the
interdepartmental "experiment"
last fall.
The Academic Council has
limited the experiment to 20 stu.
dents at any one time, so Ryan
doesn't anticipate approving that
number of degree proposals
from juniors and sophomores
immediately. "That would be un
fair to the present freshman
class," Ryan said.
The group of applicants who
submit their proposals by Feb.
16 will be notified of approval
or disapproval before spring
quarter pre-registration.
After that, interdepartmental
proposals will be considered on
a first-come, first-served basis.
An interdepartmental major,
according to Ryan, must have
a specific scholarly focus which
lies outside any of the regular

undergraduate degrees offered
by University departments.
In a memorandum describing
the experiment, Ryan cited two
actual proposals — one for study
leading to a bachelor's degree
in computer science, another for
linguistic sciences. Both drew
courses from several depart
ments.
No Random Selection
Any study which can be ac
commodated within the require
ments of an existing department
shouldn't be submitted as an in
terdepartmental proposal, Ryan
stressed.
Ryan anticipates that some
students will ask for an inter,
departmental degree for a course
of study which would actually
qualify as a major in one de
partment and a minor in an
other.
To apply for the experiment,
a student must submit a state
ment "explaining the rationale

for, including the educational
objectives of, his proposed inter
departmental program."
A descriptive leaflet warns, "It
should not be a random collec
tion of advanced courses."
An applicant must get three
professors from at least two dif
ferent departments to sponsor
his degree proposal, which must
list all the courses the student
plans to take for his custom
designed major. The three pro
fessors would serve as a super,
visory committee for the stu
dent's curriculum, along with a
person designated by the dean
of humanities and sciences.
General Studies requirements
will still apply for the interde
partmental degrees.
SES Trial
Application forms are avail
able at the humanities and sci
ence office in building one on the
Quad.

Ryan hopes that the trial pro
gram will encourage the d apart
ments to make their own degree
requirements more flexible. He
also speaks of the program as
a "trial" for various proposals
of the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES). The success or
failure of the interdepartmental
major experiment, Ryan sug
gests, will be important in eval
uating the SES proposals for
giving undergraduates much
more freedom in choosing their
studies.
The first interdepartmental de_
grees will be granted in June,
1969,.5 ix months before SES sub
mits its final report.
Ryan points out that formal
cross-disciplinary study is hard
ly new to Stanford. A special
graduate program has given in
terdepartmental degrees to ad
vanced scholars for ten years.
The humanities and sciences
office has set a Feb. 16 deadline
for applications for the first
group of interdepartmental ma
jors under an experimental pro
gram approved by the Academic
Council Jan. 5.
Starting spring quarter, as
many as 20 undergraduates will
be studying under individual de
gree programs they designed for
themselves, drawing from the
offerings of several academic de
partments.
Fewer than a dozen applica
tion forms have been handed out
so far by the humanities and
science office. Only sophomores
and juniors can apply for the
program now, but freshmen will
be allowed to submit proposed
majors starting spring quarter.
