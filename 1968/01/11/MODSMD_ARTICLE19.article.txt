# Novak Hits U.S. War Efforts, Coate Says Situation Better
## 
### 
"Dove" Michael Novak, pro
fessor of religion, and "hawk"
Robert Coate, California State
Democratic chairman, clashed
over the Vietnam war last night
in a debate at Tresidder Union.
Both men spoke of impressions
from visits during the August
elections.
Speaking first, Coate com
mented that he was upset at
being constantly branded a
hawk because "automatically
nobody will listen to what I
say."
He summed up his views in
a resolution he plans to present
to the California State Demo
cratic party meeting next week.

"I want the U.S. to commence
extricating itself."
But he pointed out that "no
where does my resolution men
tion negotiation. There really
isn't anything to negotiate. A
ceasefire will result as soon as
the Communists stop shooting.
The Communists missed their
chance to negotiate before the
elections."
He urged the government to
stop the bombing of the North
since "any military advances
have been eradicated by the
political effects/ 1 ' He said that
even if there was a bombing
cessation, "don't think it goes
along with negotiation."
On the subject of the elec
tions, he felt they were "reason
ably broadly based." The peo
ple were "willing to give Thieu
a chance but Ky was unpopular."

Coate said that he came away
from Vietnam feeling that it
was "essentially in far better
state than anybody here real
izes. Press sources are in error
so much of the time."
Novak Counters
Novak opened his speech by
asserting that "the U.S. stands
as the number one counter
revolutionary power." It hesi
tates to support anything with
"the slighest trace of pink."
He said that today it was hard
to find a revolutionary move
ment that did not include some
Communists. "How then do you
think people in other parts of
the world look on us?" he
asked. He summed up the over
all situation as a "bucket of
worms."
He said that "I am not nearly

as sanguine about the govern
ment as Mr. Coate. The elec
tion was a strikingly small vote
of confidence, considering the
number of government depend
ents that should have voted."
"Candidates received the wild
est applause when they ap
pealed to anti-American senti
ments or government corrup
tion. Many Vietnamese think
the government has a vested
interest in keeping the war go
ing."
Novak wondered "how long
this present government could
bear the tensions within it." He
cited the Thieu-Ky relationship
as well as the junior officers
anxious to stop the war as soon
as possible.


BUCKET OF WORMS: Michael
Novak repeated a phrase he used
earlier this year to describe the
overall situation in Vietnam:
"It's a bucket of worms," lie said.
Novak clashed with California
State Democratic chairman Rob
ert Coate last night in Tresidder
Union. Coate claimed the situa
tion in Vietnam was "essentially
in a far better state" than any
one in the United States realizes.
