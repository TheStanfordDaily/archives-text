SAN FRANCISCO (AP)â€”The
AFL-CIO Mailers Union and
San Francisco Newspaper Pub
lishers Association broke off
contract talks Wednesday aimed
at ending a strike which has
halted publication of two San
Francisco newspapers.
Doug Smith, president of the
Mailers Union, said talks were
recessed after an hour session
Wednesday afternoon and that
no further meetings were sched
uled. However, a meeting could
be reconvened at the call of
either party, he added.
Smith declined any comment
on why the talks were recessed
or whether any progress had
been made.
Last Friday the afternoon
Hearst's Examiner and inde
pendent morning Chronicle were
closed by Guild "informational"
pickets from Los Angeles where
a strike by the American News
paper Guild has been in prog
ress since Dec. 15 against
Hearst's Herald-Examiner.
Working Without Contract
The mailers, working without
a contract since last March,
struck against the San Fran
cisco Printing Co. Friday night.
Other unions respected their
picket line.
The printing company pro
duces both the Examiner and
Chronicle, but the newspapers
maintain separate editorial of
fices in the same building.
Superior Court Judge Charles
S. Perry restrained the mailer
and supporting unions Tuesday
from blocking the entrances of
any of the four buildings which
house the operations of the
printing company.
A similar action was taken in
Los Angeles where Superior
Judge Robert S. Thompson is
sued a preliminary injunction
Wednesday limiting the number
of pickets from one to four at
each entrance of the Herald-Ex
aminer's main office or 15
branch facilities.
Publishing During Strike
- The Herald-Examiner has
published editions since the
strike began.
The San Francisco Labor
Council executive board has
given official sanction to the
mailers' walkout.
The "informational" pickets,
who company officials claim
provided the catalyst for the
mailer walkout, moved on to
Seattle. They were to have pick
eted Hearst's Seattle Post-In
telligencer, but departed Wed
nesday without making such a
move.
