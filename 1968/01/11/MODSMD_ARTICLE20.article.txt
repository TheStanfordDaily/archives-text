## Scott, Wilson Argue Panther Killed Officer In Self Defense 
### 
A noon rally was held yester
day at White Memorial Plaza
with two speakers speaking in
support of accused murderer
Huey P. Newton.
Two Stanford students, John
nie Scott and Art Wilson dis
cussed the Newton case, defend
ing his alleged shooting of two
policemen as justified since it
was in self-defense.
"The charge is not unusual in
this country—a black man kill
ing a white man," said Scott
the first speaker.
According to Scott, what was
unusual was that Newton was
the minister for defense of
Black Pantehr Party for Self-
Defense. "Huey Newton did
what he was slated to do," said
Scott.
Art Wilson was the second
speaker. He defended Newton's
action by stating that he was
constantly being harassed by
the police and that he decided
to defend himself the next time
the police bothered him.
"What would you do if you
were black?" Wilson continued.
"That's really an unfair ques
tion, I believe, because none of
you are black: you can't feel
what it is to be black."
"Moreover you really don't
care, because you're making
yours. It doesn't matter how
you get it, just so you get it.

The Huey's don't have that type
of luxury."
Wilson said, "You realize by
being a member of the Black
Panther Party that nothing can
be done in this country."
He then complained about

what he termed the double stan
dard in American law enforce
ment. "It permits white people
in Los Angeles to have guns
during riots but then becomes
alarmed when Negroes have
guns."
