# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Win With Lyndon 
### Art Buchwald 
President Johnson indicated
the other evening in his fireside
chat that he's going to run hard
in 1968 to recoup his popularity,
which with every public opinion
poll seems to be going down.
A large staff is already pre
paring for his campaign and the
President has urged anyone who
has a good idea to speak up.
The other day, one of the
President's trusted political ad
visers came up with the most
revolutionary plan to date.
"Mr. President," he said, "I've
been studying the polls and they
seem to be taking on a pattern."
'Nobody Loves Me'
"You're damn right, and the
pattern's against me."
"But wait. The two leading
candidates for the Presidency in
the political polls are Sen. Rob
ert Kennedy and Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller. The question we
must address ourselves is why?"
"Ah'll tell you why. Cause
Ah'm doing all the work, and
they're doing all the griping."
"Perhaps so. But the scientific
reason is that both men have
formally announced that they
will not be presidential candi
dates in 1968.
Running-Downhill
"If you'll notice this graph, it
shows that as soon as the Amer
ican people hear a candidate is

going to run for office, his pop
ularity goes down; but as soon
as a candidate announces that he
doesn't want to run for office, his
popularity soars."
"What are you driving at?"
"Mr. President, I think you
should announce in your State
of the Union speech that you
will not run again for the Presi
dency in 1968."
"You must be out of your cot
ton-pickin' mind," the President
said.
Just Like Nasser
"Think before you speak.
When you announce this on na
tionwide television, your popu
larity will reach new heights.
You'll lead every poll in the
country. There will be demon
strations in the streets, people
will tear their clothes and wail.
They'll be screaming in front of
the White House, 'Johnson!
Johnson! Johnson!' Schools will
close, factory workers will leave
their jobs, students who are ly
ing down in front of draft boards
will sit up. The country will be
in a frenzy."
"Ah must admit Ah like the
picture you paint. But will it
work?"
"It worked lor President Nas
ser," the adviser said.
"Ah new the whole thing had

a familiar ring to it. But it's
risky. After all, the United
States is not Egypt."
Dump Kennedy
"That's not the point, Mr.
President. As soon as you an
nounce that you're not going to
be a candidate in 1968, Bobby
Kennedy will announce that he
is a candidate. And as soon as
he announces it, his popularity
will start slipping while yours
will be going up. There will be
Dump Kennedy movements all
over the country, and every
one will be begging you to ac
cept a draft."
"Ah reckon it makes sense,
and Ah think Ah might buy it.
But Ah've got one problem."
"What's that, sir?"
"How do Ah break the news
to Hubert?"
