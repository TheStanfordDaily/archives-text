# The 						Outpost
## Bonnie, Clyde, And Malcolm X 
### Louis Knowles 
Is there a unique psychologi
cal source of American violence?
Warren Beatty's film, Bonnie and
Clyde searches into the dark
corners of the national mind to
answer this question.
Clyde Barrow, leader of a
vicious gang of bank robbers
during the Depression, is rend
ered impotent by severe sexual
guilt. His frustration is the most
obvious source of his murderous
and suicidal impulses.
But the film probes deeper,
hinting at factors in American
moral thought that produce
anxieties in certain relatively in
nocuous areas of behavior while
allowing emotional release in
that which is ultimately far more
damaging.
Staunch Confusion
Clyde and his cohorts come
from staunch American families
steeped in Protestant fundamen
talist morality. One member of
the gang is the daughter of a
Baptist preacher and C. W. Moss,
another member, points out that
he was a Disciple of Christ.
Their society, far from reject
ing the Barrows for their brutal
murders, receives them almost
as heroes. C. W.'s father is ob
sessed by the sacrilege of a
love symbol tatooed on his son's
chest, but he seems almost proud
of the number of lives C.W. has
taken.

American morality reserves
its mightiest blasts for use
against promiscuity, drugs, and
related personal vices while it
condones by silence the exercise
of violence against various out
groups. In the case of Bonny
and Clyde the out-group was the
capitalist establishment which
reached the nadir of its popu
larity during the '30's.
Look Who Did It
History shows that much of
white American aggression has
been channeled against the Afro-
Americans who have been con.
sistently regarded as barbarians.
White America by the act of
placing the black population out
side the bounds of Christendom
created for itself the greatest
anxiety of all. For now in its
very midst it harbored a group
that it secretly believed was un
fettered by the Protestant moral
ity that produced its own neu
roses as manifested in men such
as Clyde Barrow.
Malcolm X during his years
as a Harlem hustler saw the
lurid fascination with which
whites viewed black men whom
they regarded subconsciously as
pagan savages.
Now It's Easy
He believed that the whit -
man's greatest fear was of the
extraordinary sexual prowess
that whites attributed to the

black man. Malcolm X pointed
to this deep-seated terror as the
reason white America can heap
violence and oppression on the
Afro-American population with,
out so much as batting an eye.
In the final scene of Bonnie
and Clyde in which the killers
are in their turn cut down by
a sadistic act of vengeance, there
are two black farmhands stand
ing as silent witnesses. These
men represent the parents and
grandparents of the black men
who are today exposing the hoi

lowness of the American dream.
These past generations of
Afro-Americans watched the
spectacle of white cutthroat
competition and civil war from
their position as serfs. They
knew America better than any
white for they were the recipi
ents of the bitterest violence the
nation could muster. Their de
scendant H. Rapp Brown sum
med up 400 years of race rela.
tions on this continent when he
said, "Violence is as American
as cherry pie."
