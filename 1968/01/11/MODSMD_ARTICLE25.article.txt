# The 						Adventures Of Me And My Beard
## 
### DAN SNELL 
Last summer in an odd mo
ment I decided that I did not
care what I looked like or what
anyone thought about me and
made the vast existential de
cision not to shave.
At the time I reasoned that
I saved about five minutes and
two pints of blood a day from
not shaving.
But I soon came face-to-beard,
as it were, with some of the
disadvantages.
Little black children I erv
countered in my work would
call me a "hippy," and old
friends at home approached me
with great caution and tended
to ennunciate very clearly for
fear that I had forgotten how to
speak English.
He Must Be Redlcal
And my parents, though not
openly condoled with, were si
lently pitied.
But I have since determined
that there are advantages to
wearing a beard. One is immed
iately associated with the radi
cal movement on campus.
This leads to some very in
teresting girls smiling at you.
But it also leads to the feeling
on the part of others that you
always have something pro
found to say, when in fact your
mind is about as clean-shaven
as it was before.
Be Careful
In one section I had last quar
ter it appeared that my beard
really inspired a large degree of
paranoia on the part of the
teaching assistant and the other
students in the section.
I am sure that this was
caused to some extent by my
natural love of argument. But
whenever someone said some
thing in the least controversial
about any subject, he would
then turn to me to see if I was
going to have some sort of
radical reaction.
And thus I had a chance to
discourse on a variety of mat
ters of which I know little, on
the fairy tale aspects of the
Odyssey and other controversial
problems of life and death.
One Of These Days
But I suppose I shall cut the
thing off eventually. My mother,

a wishy-washy radical if ever
there was one, keeps asking,
"You're not going to wear that
all year, are you?"
And I suppose I shall get
tired of looking ugly and of hav
ing to comb my face.
But there are nice moments
made possible by the business
on my chin. A few weeks ago
I went to a church where I had
not gone for a year.
A couple of dear little old
ladies behind me, whispering
too loudly probably because of
their increasing deafness, noted
disapprovingly my facial ap
pendage.
"But when I was a little girl,"
one of the octogenarians said,
"I knew a man who had a
beard, and he took a bath every
single day."
Controlling my urge to turn
around and let the dears smell
my arm-pits, I contended myself
with studying the stain-glass
window showing Jesus the
Christ looking as though he had
not bathed or shaved for days.
