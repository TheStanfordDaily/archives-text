### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Adam
Clayton Powell told some 6,000
students Wednesday to "fall in
line" behind the Black Power
movement "before it's too late."
The deposed Harlem congress
man called his mostly white au
dience at UCLA "victims of the
cult of mediocrity."
In the first of 14 scheduled
speeches since he broke his self
imposed exile in the Bahamas
and flew to California Monday,
Powell drew occasional laughs
and cheers as he shouted his
remarks.
"The trouble with you young
white men and women is that
you have no .leadership," he
cried. "Whether we agree with
them or not, we've got our
Stokley Carmichael, our Floyd
McKissick, our Rap Brown and
the old man of the sea, Adam
Powell. We black folks, we got
a new breed of cats."
The loudest applause came
from a section of the auditorium
occupied by members of the
Black Students Union. They
cheered when he said: "We are
finished completely and totally
with the American way of life
we've been forced to live under

for 100 years of quasi freedom
and 300 years of slavery."
Powell condemned the origi
nal civil rights movement, say
ing "great old men like Phil
Randolph and Roy Wilkins —
they've had their day."
Powell repeatedly criticized
the Johnson administration's
Great Society program. Refer
ring to his own term in Con
gress, he said, "Probably th?
worst thing I ever did was to
bring out of my committee and
pass on the floor the war on
poverty. It means nothing, noth
ing, nothing."
Powell was ousted from Con
gress after being accused of mis
using government funds. He has
avoided New York for a long
period because of a warrant for
his arrest on criminal contempt
charges stemming from a libel
judgment.
Powell spoke of poverty
stricken families he had seen in
Appalachia and said, "We black
people have made up our minds
we're going to free them." And
turned to the side of the audi
torium where most of the stu
dents were white, he said, "We're
going to free you,"
