## 
### 
Stanford students backing
Gov. George Romney for Presi
dent have called a meeting to
night at 7 p.m. in Tresidder
room 269.
John Munger, a spokesman
for "SURGE" (Students United
for Romney through General
Education) said Tuesday he will
invite the Michigan candidate
to speak at Stanford during the
campaign.
Munger defined the group's
goal as educating the public on
Romney's position on campaign
issues. "We feel, as does Gov.
Rockefeller, that once the public
learns what George Romney
has done and what he stands
for, it will make it impossible

for the conservative wing of the
Republican party to nominate
another loser as it did in 1964,"
Munger said.
A booth to distribute cam
paign literature will be one of
SURGE'S projects, he said. Po
litical speakers and a poll of
campus political sentiment are
also envisioned.
Munger also predicted the
group will send questions on
various issues to Romney, and
publish his replies.
Romney is now the only de
clared candidate for President.
He is entered in the Oregon and
California primaries. In Cali
fornia Romney is certain to be
opposed by Gov. Ronald Reagan,
a "favorite-son" candidate.
