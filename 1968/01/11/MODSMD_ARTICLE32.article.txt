## Draft Call Up To 39,000 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)— Penta
gon sources say the 39,000-man
draft call announced for March
is a sign of things to come this
spring and summer with month
ly manpower requests of about
40,000 or more likely in April,
May and June.
Last year's draft summons in
the same four-month period av
eraged only about 15,300 per
month.
As on manpower planner put
it in describing the upswing:
"We're dealing entirely with
mechanics here."
The mechanics are that the
Army is now in the midst of
what the Pentagon calls a ma.
jor replacement cycle involving
the rotation out of service of
thousands of men drafted when
the Southeast Asia buildup was
launched.
By August replacement needs
will really be soaring. The rea
son: In August 1966, when U.S.
manpower for the war was es
calated, 36,600 men were or
dered to duty, followed by 37,300
in September, 49,200 in October
and 37,600 in November.
Those men will be ending

their two-year tours this fall,
and the Pentagon has to allow
about five months for the induc
tion process and training in lin
ing up ready replacements. Thus,
March inductees actually will
be August replacements. Penta
gon planners say it would be
somewhat misleading to try to
project 1967's April, May and
June manpower needs simply
by looking at the draft calls of
September, October and Novem
ber 1966. This is because enlist,
ments and re-enlistments over
which the Pentagon has no con
trol — help determine replace
ment needs and because the
overall planned level of the arm
ed forces must be considered.
The Army strength stood at
1.47 million at the last account
ing Nov. 30. A new force level
may be set for the fiscal year
beginning July 1.
The Pentagon declined to pre
dict officially monthly draft calls
for 1967's second quarter, but
said in response to questions,
"We can expect a relatively high
level of draft calls to be re
quired during the balance of
the current fiscal year" ending
June 30.

After that there could be a
tapering off in Pentagon re
quests to the Selective Service
System. This would reflect the
dip in December 1966 to 12,100
inductions and average monthly
inductions in 1967 of only 18,200.
The 39,000 man call for March
—second highest of the Vietnam
war — compares with January's
34,000 and February's 23,300.
Calls in the Vietnam war

reached a high of 49,200 in Octo
ber 1966. Actually, 50,576 men
were drafted then — there is al
ways a difference between man
power request and the number
brought in — making it the big
gest month for inductions since
54,981 men were put in uniform
in May 1953 near the end of the
Korean war.
Monthly inductions ranged to
87,000 in the Korean War.
