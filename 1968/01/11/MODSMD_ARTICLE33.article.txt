# Phi Psi's Charter Reinstated, Remaining Pledges May Leave
## 
### WILLIAMSON EVERS 
The national executive council
of Phi Kappa Psi has decided to
return the Stanford chapter's
charter which it revoked No.
vember 9 after a prolonged con
troversy over member selection.
This decision resulted from a
December 26 meeting in Indian
apolis which two active mem
bers of the Stanford chapter
attended to answer questions.
An alumni "supervisory com
mittee" established at the time
of the suspension will continue
to oversee the house until the
end of this academic year.
Only 20 Remain
Only 20 Phi Psis remain in the
house out of the 42 living there
at the beginning of fall quarter.
Seven of these 20 are pledges.
However, some of them plan
to leave when they are asked to
pay the $90 initiation fee. The
former members of the pledge
class are now living in Beta Chi
fraternity, the Grove, and off
campus.
Associate Dean of Students
Williams, who worked with the
house, commented that "since
both pledges and actives entered
into the matter with their eyes
open, I am confident a satisfac
tory arrangement could have
been made, had not the require
ments of national affiliation been
so inflexible on membership se
lection procedures."
The block of more than thirty
students who pledged Phi Psi
last year formed on a nonselec
tive basis. The group's purpose
was to rejuvenate any one of
those fraternities received smal
ler and smaller pledge classes
each year.
Long-Range Changes Planned
The group hoped to retain fin
ancial support from the local
Phi Psi alumni while setting up
a nonselective living unit with
education brought into the resi
dence. Other long-range possibi
lities Included co-education and
a gradual break from the na
tional.
Pledges returned to school last
September to learn that Bill
Holt had won the house presi
dency running on a platform of
giving the pledges a rough hell

week. One pledge left after an
abortive attempt at traditional
hell week procedure by one of
the actives.
The pledges had expected to
be be initiated into the fraternity
at the end of hell week just be
fore school opened. But initia.
tion was postponed many times,
on each occasion for "only a
week or two."
Extensive training in the his
tory and traditions of the fra
ternity was required of the
pledges. Chapter Adviser Charles
Kendall gave weekly quizzes to
prepare the pledges for a test
prepared by the national which
finally arrived after two months.
Pledges became disgruntled
when the house officers failed
to carry out majority vote deci
sions made in house meetings.
The library was never set up,
magazine subscriptions were not
taken, and the billiard table was
not sold.
House social functions were
boycotted by the pledges, and
many stopped doing their house
jobs.
New Program Tried
The pledge class had planned
house seminars, some for cre
dit, on topics like "Psychology
and the Novel" and "Contempor
ary Music," but a controversy
developed when English profes
sor David Levin denounced
offering University â€¢ approved
courses in fraternity houses.
Four members of the pledge
class, including last year's Out
standing Freshman, David Pugh,
were arrested in Oakland on
October 16.
Chapter adviser Kendall, hear
ing this, tried to have them de
pledged, and when national Ex
ecutive Secretary Ralph Dan
iels visited the house in Novem

ber he hinted that these four
might be communists.
Actives and pledges began
meeting with alumni of the chap
ter to discover the consequences
if the house adopted the draw
selection system or went local.
Actives tried to work out a
compromise rush policy in which
selection would be random yet
at the same time there would
be safeguards to prevent "de
generation into a boarding
house."
The national, hearing reports
that the chapter was being "tak
en over," suspended the chapter.
All pledges were ordered de
pledged.
Gradually members of the
pledge class began moving out,
some because the house did not
go local and others because of
dissatisfaction with the "com
promise" rush policy.
Pledge class president Pugh
described the whole affair as "an
exercise in futility." He felt that
'there are more important
things than where you live."
