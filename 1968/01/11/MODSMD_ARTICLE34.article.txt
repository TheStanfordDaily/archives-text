## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)—A jury
imposed the death penalty Wed
nesday on Jack Kirschke, form,
er deputy district attorney, for
murdering his wife and her al
leged lover.
It was the decision Kirschke
asked for when, arguing the
penalty phase of his trial him
self, he told the jury Tuesday:
"I prefer death to spending
the rest of my life in prison."

The same Superior Court jury
which convicted Kirschke, 46,
last Dec. 19 deliberated 4 hours,
15 minutes Tuesday and today
in deciding the penalty.
He was found guilty in the fa
tal shooting last April 8 of
Elaine Kirschke, 43, a dress de
signer, and Orville William Dran
kan, 41, as they lay on a bed
in the Kirschke home in Long
Beach.
The six-man, six-woman jury
could choose either life impris
onment, or death, under Califor
nia law on the conviction of
first degree murder.
Kirschke did not testify dur
ing his trial which lasted nearly
four months but in his argu
ment in the penalty phase he
declared:
"I did not shoot my wife and
I did not shoot Bill Drankhan.
And I am willing to bet my life
on that — that is about as far as
you can go."
