(AP) — Prince Norodom Siha.
nouk has described Mrs. Jacque
line Kennedy's visit to Cambodia
last fall as a diplomatic mission
that failed. He said presidential
envoy Chester Bowles also will
return empty-handed from his

present talks there.
The remarks were made in a
Cambodian news conference last
Sunday but the comments con.
cerning the former First Lady
were not available until yester
day.
In Washington, State Depart
ment spokesmen commenting on
Sihanouk's remarks said Mrs.
Kennedy's trip to Cambodia was
a private and personal visit at
the invitation of the prince.
Meanwhile, Cambodian offi
cials reported Wednesday that
the first meeting of U.S. Ambas
sador Chester Bowles and Prince
Norodom Sihanouk was "frank
and cordial" but they disclosed
no details of the hour-long con
versation.
Bowles arrived in Phnom
Penh Monday on a mission for
President Johnson to discuss the
use of neutral Cambodia as a
sanctuary by Communist stroops
fighting In Vietnam. There was
a possibility the talks would
range over the broader issues of
Vietnam peace talks.
Confer Again Thursday
An informed source said
Bowles probably would confer
with Sihanouk again Thursday
and leave Phnom Penh Friday.
Informants said Sihanouk
spoke to Bowles in English and
expressed the Cambodian posi
tion with his "habitual affabil
ity." The meeting was at the
prince's modernistic Chamcar
Mon Palace, set amid luxuriant
tropical gardens.
Cambodian officials said "use
ful points of view were exchang
ed."
Sihanouk said before the meet
ing that he cannot permit Amer
ican troops to pursue Viet Cong
and North Vietnamese forces in
to Cambodia.
