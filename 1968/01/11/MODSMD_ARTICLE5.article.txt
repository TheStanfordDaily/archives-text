## Surveyor Tries, Can't Dig 
### 
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) —
Surveyor 7 ran into its first me
chanical hitch Wednesday when
a device to analyze soil radia
tion stuck part way to the lunar
surface.
A Jet Propulsion Laboratory
spokesman said radio signals
released the 5x6x7-inch box
from a door 3 feet above the
surface but the string by which
the box was suspended appar
ent y caught in a ratchet.
Controllers said they would
try to jar the box loose with an
extendable scoop like the one
with which Surveyor 3 dug the
first man-made trenches on the
moon last April.
The scoop was expected to be
njin its scratching operations
later.
If the box is not lowered, one
of the major experiments of the
final unmanned U.S. lunar scout
will be blocked. It contains in
struments to bombard the sur
face with radiation and determ

ine soil elements by their re
action.
One of the tasks of Surveyor
7 is to see whether the soil
where it landed in the south
central highlands near the cra
ter Tycho is much different
from that of other regions of
the moon.
The craft had operated
smoothly since its launch Sun
day from Cape Kennedy, Fla.
The three-legged spacecraft,
loaded with instruments to sat*
isfy scientific curiosity, Iftnded
softly Tuesday night and tele
vised 1,225 pictures of a sci
ence-fiction landscape: ragged
ridges, huge boulders, treacher
ous craters.
To Test Surface
Most interesting of the instru
ments is a hand-sized scoop on
an extendable arm, a twin of
that carried by Surveyor 3 last
April which dug several
trenches and helped prove the
li nar surface is strong enough
to bear the weight of manned

landings planned as early as
next year.
During the next two weeks of
lunar daylight scientists at Jet
Propulsion Laboratory will com
mand the scoop to scratch the
surface as deep as 18 inches,
shove nearby rocks around and
hammer holes in the soil.

It also will be used to move
from spot to spot a small box
containing a device to analyze
the soil by radiation.
The purpose is to see whether
highlands areas are much dif
ferent from the equatorial
plains sampled by earlier Sur
veyors.

mand the scoop to scratch the
surface as deep as 18 inches,
shove nearby rocks around and
hammer holes in the soil.

It also will be used to move
from spot to spot a small box
containing a device to analyze
the soil by radiation.
The purpose is to see whether
highlands areas are much dif
ferent from the equatorial
plains sampled by earlier Sur
veyors.
PASADENA, Calif. (AP) —
Surveyor 7 ran into its first me
chanical hitch Wednesday when
a device to analyze soil radia
tion stuck part way to the lunar
surface.
A Jet Propulsion Laboratory
spokesman said radio signals
released the 5x6x7-inch box
from a door 3 feet above the
surface but the string by which
the box was suspended appar
ent y caught in a ratchet.
Controllers said they would
try to jar the box loose with an
extendable scoop like the one
with which Surveyor 3 dug the
first man-made trenches on the
moon last April.
The scoop was expected to be
njin its scratching operations
later.
If the box is not lowered, one
of the major experiments of the
final unmanned U.S. lunar scout
will be blocked. It contains in
struments to bombard the sur
face with radiation and determ

ine soil elements by their re
action.
One of the tasks of Surveyor
7 is to see whether the soil
where it landed in the south
central highlands near the cra
ter Tycho is much different
from that of other regions of
the moon.
The craft had operated
smoothly since its launch Sun
day from Cape Kennedy, Fla.
The three-legged spacecraft,
loaded with instruments to sat*
isfy scientific curiosity, Iftnded
softly Tuesday night and tele
vised 1,225 pictures of a sci
ence-fiction landscape: ragged
ridges, huge boulders, treacher
ous craters.
To Test Surface
Most interesting of the instru
ments is a hand-sized scoop on
an extendable arm, a twin of
that carried by Surveyor 3 last
April which dug several
trenches and helped prove the
li nar surface is strong enough
to bear the weight of manned

landings planned as early as
next year.
During the next two weeks of
lunar daylight scientists at Jet
Propulsion Laboratory will com
mand the scoop to scratch the
surface as deep as 18 inches,
shove nearby rocks around and
hammer holes in the soil.

It also will be used to move
from spot to spot a small box
containing a device to analyze
the soil by radiation.
The purpose is to see whether
highlands areas are much dif
ferent from the equatorial
plains sampled by earlier Sur
veyors.
