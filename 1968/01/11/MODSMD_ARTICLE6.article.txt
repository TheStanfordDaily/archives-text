# U.S. Defense Fire Routs Viet Troops
## 
### 
SAIGON — Defensive fire of
an American infantry outfit and
its artillery virtually destroyed
a 350-man Viet Cong battalion
Wednesday.
A five hour fight 31 miles
northwest of Saigon pointed up
the price the Communists are
paying in blood for their offen
sive efforts of the new year,
win, lose or draw.
U.S. spokesmen announced
103 of the enemy died—many
from howitzer shells that gun
ners call "Killer Juniors"—in a
human wave assault on a biv
ouac of the Ist Battalion, 27th
Infantry, 25th Infantry Division.
On this basis, since military
statistics show two or more men
are wounded for every one
killed in such wide open opera
tions, only a handful of the Com
munists could have emerged un
hit.

Five Americans perished, two
in a bunker struck by an enemy
shell or rocket, and 28 were
wounded.
The Viet Cong battalion,
which a prisoner told interroga
tors had North Vietnamese as
replacements for half its ranks,
could be written off at least
temporarily as a fighting force.
A North Vietnamese raid by
night on the U.S. air strip at
Kontum, in the central high
lands 260 miles northeast of Sai
gon, blasted an unspecified
number of helicopters and mo
tor vehicles.
Twenty-five or 30 satchel
charges wrought damage that
the U.S. Command called
moderate. Seven Americans
were killed and 25 wounded in a
20-minute skirmish. The enemy
left 14 uniformed dead within
the compound.
