# Unruh Argues With Reagan On Extension Of Food Tax
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagan said Wednesday he is
considering extension of the
state sales tax to food, but Dem
ocrats replied they are "utterly,
absolutely opposed" to such a
proposal.
And, in back-to-back news
conferences, Reagan and Dem
ocratic Assembly Speaker Jesse
M. Unruh issued harsh words at
each other, the Republican gov
ernor even reviving the "Big
Daddy" tag hung on Unruh
years ago before he slimmed
down to 200 pounds from 285
pounds.
Ease Tax Burden
The governor was careful to
emphasize that he would ask
lawmakers to tax food only as
part of a program that would
have the end result of easing the
over-all tax burden of low-in
come families. And he stressed
that he has not accepted the

idea, but has it before him as
part of a tax task force study
made by a group of business
men at his request.
At his weekly news confer
ence, the governor made a
sharp attack on Unruh, remark
ing, "It would seem it takes
more than a change of tailors
to change the image of Big
Daddy."
Unanimous Opposition
More seriously, he said the
Democrats, who control the As
sembly and can block any pro
gram of the governor, have
voted unanimously to oppose
any tax on food. "Under no cir
cumstances will we retreat from
that stand," he declared, and em
phasized, "I am utterly, abso
lutely opposed to a sales tax on
food."
Such a tax, the Democratic
leader declared, "has to be the
most short-sighted, selfish, un

enlightened decision anyo n e
could make."
Unruh said Reagan opposed a
Democratic bill last year for
sales tax rebates to low-income
families, which now is part of
the food tax proposal before
him. But perhaps, the speaker
said, the governor could change
his mind on the idea just as "he
could change his party registra
tion and his philosophical con
victions."
Renewed Challenge
Renewing a challenge Reagan
ignored last year, Unruh called
for a television discussion be
tween the two, sitting down "on
a man-to-man basis in front of
the camera and the people . . .
for an hour and discuss the
problems that face this state."
A Reagan spokesman said
the challenge would not be ac
cepted.
Reagan was pressed closely on
the suggestion In the task force
report on tax reform that the
state should seriously consider
extending the sales tax to gro
ceries and take-home food for
the first time since it was adopt
ed early in the Depression. Res.
taurant-consumed food is taxed
now.
In his address to the legisla
ture Tuesday, Reagan had said
"some of the stories on what I
will recommend are a little pre
mature and, like the report of
Mark Twain's death, somewhat
exaggerated."
Wednesday, he told newsmen
the food tax was just one of
many alternatives in the report,
which he hadn't read in detail
yet. He said the report says such
a move should be taken only in
connection with a combined plan
of lowering the current five per
cent sales tax and giving the
lowest-income families — those
who don't pay income tax — a
flat rebate each year to return
some of the food tax they paid.

The aim, he said, is "to make
the tax more equitable ... to
benefit lower income groups. If
broadening of the tax base . . .
can be used in such a way . . .
to make it more equitable" to
all Californians, "we ought to
look at that and consider it very
seriously."
The Republican chief execu
tive said he would oppose ex
tending the sales tax to food
without a rebate or rate-lower
ing provision.
Reagan stressed his aim of re.
forming the tax structure in
California, especially to help out
the average homeowner who "is
paying a completely dispropor
tionate part of the cost of gov
ernment" through the local
property tax.
His comments on Unruh start
ed out with a quip when a re
porter asked how he felt when
his speech to a joint session of
the legislature Tuesday wasn't
interrupted by any applause. The
governor cracked, "I felt a little
bit like Lincoln must have felt
at Gettysburg. I felt I was stand
ing on a great battlefield."

emphasize that he would ask
lawmakers to tax food only as
part of a program that would
have the end result of easing the
over-all tax burden of low-in
come families. And he stressed
that he has not accepted the

idea, but has it before him as
part of a tax task force study
made by a group of business
men at his request.
At his weekly news confer
ence, the governor made a
sharp attack on Unruh, remark
ing, "It would seem it takes
more than a change of tailors
to change the image of Big
Daddy."
Unanimous Opposition
More seriously, he said the
Democrats, who control the As
sembly and can block any pro
gram of the governor, have
voted unanimously to oppose
any tax on food. "Under no cir
cumstances will we retreat from
that stand," he declared, and em
phasized, "I am utterly, abso
lutely opposed to a sales tax on
food."
Such a tax, the Democratic
leader declared, "has to be the
most short-sighted, selfish, un

enlightened decision anyo n e
could make."
Unruh said Reagan opposed a
Democratic bill last year for
sales tax rebates to low-income
families, which now is part of
the food tax proposal before
him. But perhaps, the speaker
said, the governor could change
his mind on the idea just as "he
could change his party registra
tion and his philosophical con
victions."
Renewed Challenge
Renewing a challenge Reagan
ignored last year, Unruh called
for a television discussion be
tween the two, sitting down "on
a man-to-man basis in front of
the camera and the people . . .
for an hour and discuss the
problems that face this state."
A Reagan spokesman said
the challenge would not be ac
cepted.
Reagan was pressed closely on
the suggestion In the task force
report on tax reform that the
state should seriously consider
extending the sales tax to gro
ceries and take-home food for
the first time since it was adopt
ed early in the Depression. Res.
taurant-consumed food is taxed
now.
In his address to the legisla
ture Tuesday, Reagan had said
"some of the stories on what I
will recommend are a little pre
mature and, like the report of
Mark Twain's death, somewhat
exaggerated."
Wednesday, he told newsmen
the food tax was just one of
many alternatives in the report,
which he hadn't read in detail
yet. He said the report says such
a move should be taken only in
connection with a combined plan
of lowering the current five per
cent sales tax and giving the
lowest-income families — those
who don't pay income tax — a
flat rebate each year to return
some of the food tax they paid.

The aim, he said, is "to make
the tax more equitable ... to
benefit lower income groups. If
broadening of the tax base . . .
can be used in such a way . . .
to make it more equitable" to
all Californians, "we ought to
look at that and consider it very
seriously."
The Republican chief execu
tive said he would oppose ex
tending the sales tax to food
without a rebate or rate-lower
ing provision.
Reagan stressed his aim of re.
forming the tax structure in
California, especially to help out
the average homeowner who "is
paying a completely dispropor
tionate part of the cost of gov
ernment" through the local
property tax.
His comments on Unruh start
ed out with a quip when a re
porter asked how he felt when
his speech to a joint session of
the legislature Tuesday wasn't
interrupted by any applause. The
governor cracked, "I felt a little
bit like Lincoln must have felt
at Gettysburg. I felt I was stand
ing on a great battlefield."

sembly and can block any pro
gram of the governor, have
voted unanimously to oppose
any tax on food. "Under no cir
cumstances will we retreat from
that stand," he declared, and em
phasized, "I am utterly, abso
lutely opposed to a sales tax on
food."
Such a tax, the Democratic
leader declared, "has to be the
most short-sighted, selfish, un

enlightened decision anyo n e
could make."
Unruh said Reagan opposed a
Democratic bill last year for
sales tax rebates to low-income
families, which now is part of
the food tax proposal before
him. But perhaps, the speaker
said, the governor could change
his mind on the idea just as "he
could change his party registra
tion and his philosophical con
victions."
Renewed Challenge
Renewing a challenge Reagan
ignored last year, Unruh called
for a television discussion be
tween the two, sitting down "on
a man-to-man basis in front of
the camera and the people . . .
for an hour and discuss the
problems that face this state."
A Reagan spokesman said
the challenge would not be ac
cepted.
Reagan was pressed closely on
the suggestion In the task force
report on tax reform that the
state should seriously consider
extending the sales tax to gro
ceries and take-home food for
the first time since it was adopt
ed early in the Depression. Res.
taurant-consumed food is taxed
now.
In his address to the legisla
ture Tuesday, Reagan had said
"some of the stories on what I
will recommend are a little pre
mature and, like the report of
Mark Twain's death, somewhat
exaggerated."
Wednesday, he told newsmen
the food tax was just one of
many alternatives in the report,
which he hadn't read in detail
yet. He said the report says such
a move should be taken only in
connection with a combined plan
of lowering the current five per
cent sales tax and giving the
lowest-income families — those
who don't pay income tax — a
flat rebate each year to return
some of the food tax they paid.

The aim, he said, is "to make
the tax more equitable ... to
benefit lower income groups. If
broadening of the tax base . . .
can be used in such a way . . .
to make it more equitable" to
all Californians, "we ought to
look at that and consider it very
seriously."
The Republican chief execu
tive said he would oppose ex
tending the sales tax to food
without a rebate or rate-lower
ing provision.
Reagan stressed his aim of re.
forming the tax structure in
California, especially to help out
the average homeowner who "is
paying a completely dispropor
tionate part of the cost of gov
ernment" through the local
property tax.
His comments on Unruh start
ed out with a quip when a re
porter asked how he felt when
his speech to a joint session of
the legislature Tuesday wasn't
interrupted by any applause. The
governor cracked, "I felt a little
bit like Lincoln must have felt
at Gettysburg. I felt I was stand
ing on a great battlefield."
