# Unruh Argues With Reagan On Extension Of Food Tax
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagan said Wednesday he is
considering extension of the
state sales tax to food, but Dem
ocrats replied they are "utterly,
absolutely opposed" to such a
proposal.
And, in back-to-back news
conferences, Reagan and Dem
ocratic Assembly Speaker Jesse
M. Unruh issued harsh words at
each other, the Republican gov
ernor even reviving the "Big
Daddy" tag hung on Unruh
years ago before he slimmed
down to 200 pounds from 285
pounds.
Ease Tax Burden
The governor was careful to
emphasize that he would ask
lawmakers to tax food only as
part of a program that would
have the end result of easing the
over-all tax burden of low-in
come families. And he stressed
that he has not accepted the

idea, but has it before him as
part of a tax task force study
made by a group of business
men at his request.
At his weekly news confer
ence, the governor made a
sharp attack on Unruh, remark
ing, "It would seem it takes
more than a change of tailors
to change the image of Big
Daddy."
Unanimous Opposition
More seriously, he said the
Democrats, who control the As
sembly and can block any pro
gram of the governor, have
voted unanimously to oppose
any tax on food. "Under no cir
cumstances will we retreat from
that stand," he declared, and em
phasized, "I am utterly, abso
lutely opposed to a sales tax on
food."
Such a tax, the Democratic
leader declared, "has to be the
most short-sighted, selfish, un

enlightened decision anyo n e
could make."
Unruh said Reagan opposed a
Democratic bill last year for
sales tax rebates to low-income
families, which now is part of
the food tax proposal before
him. But perhaps, the speaker
said, the governor could change
his mind on the idea just as "he
could change his party registra
tion and his philosophical con
victions."
Renewed Challenge
Renewing a challenge Reagan
ignored last year, Unruh called
for a television discussion be
tween the two, sitting down "on
a man-to-man basis in front of
the camera and the people . . .
for an hour and discuss the
problems that face this state."
A Reagan spokesman said
the challenge would not be ac
cepted.
