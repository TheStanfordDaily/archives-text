# U.S. Security Agreements 'Pillars Of Peace': Rusk
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—Secre
tary of State D°an Rusk said
yesterday the integrity of the
United States under its mutual
security agreements "is a prin
cipal pillar of peace."
Rusk said the United States
during the last 20 years has
triod to build peace in the world
but that it has been necessary
for this country to demonstrate
firmness in the face of aggres.
sion.
"Imagine how a map of the
world would be drawn today
had the United States not used
firmness," he said. "Iran, Tur
key, Greece, the Congo, South
east Asia."
"It's easy to say some place
is too far away . . . those fellows
don't mean what they say . . .
one more bite will satisfy them
. . . in any effect it's none of our
business," Rusk added.
"But there is a struggle going
on in the world between those
who would organize as under
the United Nations charter and
those who would organize under
what they call the world revolu
tion," he said. "That struggle

has not bren solved. The United
States has had to be firm in or
der to stabilize the peace."
Rusk made his remarks at the
1968 Share in Freedom confer
ence held in association with the
U.S. Industrial Payroll Savings
Committee to promote sale of
U.S. Savings Bonds.
No Answer To N. Viets
Rusk, as he did at his news
conference last week, declined
to comment directly on the la
test proposal by North Viet
namese Foreign Minister Nguy
en Duy Trinh who said negotia
tions will begin as soon as the
United States stopped bombing
the North.
President Johnson said last
September in San Antonio, Tex.,
"The United States is willing
immediately to stop aerial and
naval bombardment of North
Vietnam when this will lead
promptly to productive discus
sion."
"We would assume," he add
ed, "that while discussions pro
ceed, North Vietnam would not
take advantage of the bombing
cessation or limitation."
