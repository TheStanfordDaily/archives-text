# Stanford Heart Man Showing Progress

### PAT McMAHON 
Mike Kasperak sat up a g a in
last night and wrote "I love
you" to his wife, Feme, who
was visitng. A tube in his throat
to facilitate breathing prevents
him from talking.
Doctors at Stanford Medical
Center reported he has made
"significant improvement," al
though he is still on the critical
list.
The 54-year-old retired steel
worker, who is now in his fifth
day with a new heart, has not
yet eaten any solid food. His
blood pressure is reported nor
mal and his heart is functioning
normally.
It was also reported last night
the kidney, donated by the heart
donor, Mrs. Virginia White, was
rejected by the recipient's body
and was removed last night in a
half-hour operation.
The hospital revealed only
yesterday morning the recipient
was Mrs. Annabelle Mann, 52,
of Reno, Nevada. She is under
going peritoneal dialysis, a sub
stitute kidney process, until a
new kidney is found.
In New York City, Louis
Block, the world's fifth heart
transplant recipient, died ten
hours after the operation was
performed, The Associated Press
reported yesterday.
A spokesman at Brooklyn's
Maimonides Medical Center,
where Dr. Adrian Kantrowitz'
team performed the 8-hour-and.

20-minute operation, said Kan
trowitz would not discuss the
transplant failure "until they
get results of the post-mortem
and report them to the proper
medical sources."
First reported in "reasonably
satisfactory condition" immedi
ately after the surgery—in which
two major surgical steps were
performed—Block's condition be
came critical shortly after mid
night, when his blood pressure
began to fail. He died a few
hours later.
Officials of Maimonides at.
tributed Block's death to "the
pumping capacity of the trans
planted heart and the poor con
dition of the lungs due to the pa
tient's long-standing heart dis
ease."
In Cape Town, South Africa,
Dr. Christian Barnard said
yesterday he can give no reason
at this stage why the three hu
man heart transplants in the
United States have all encount
ered early postoperative diffi
culty while both of his trans,
plants made good initial prog
ress.
Barnard said if Blaiberg, his
transplant patient, should die
because of something that could
have been prevented, reported
The Associated Press, the South
African program will go ahead.
But if death were due to an un
known factor and "if we hit our
heads against a wall, we will
have to stop and think," he said.
