Pat McMabon talked with General
Hershey in Washington over the Christmas
holidays. From Indiana to October 16th to
the humanities; the coversation continued
for over two hours.

1724 F Street, Washington, D.C., is an unmarked light brown
brick building just down the block from the Executive Offices
of the President. No address on it. No sign. Surrounded by
black, white, and grey "for official government use only" auto
mobiles, it is the headquarters of the Selective Service System.
In a spacious office on the sixth floor, General Lewis B.
Hershey directs the operation of the draft. His office is lined
with 55 flags, and on the walls are pictures of past directors of
the Selective Service. I talked with General Hershey in his
office for over two hours during the Christmas holidays.
Leaning back into his padded leather chair, Hershey spoke
about student deferments. "Unless there is some strong re
action that comes from public disgust at the behavior of a mi
nority of students—a minority, a few hundred or a few thou
sand—student deferments will probably continue. We are aw
fully close to taking four years of college for granted, just as
we once took eighth grade or high school for granted, and we
are even getting closer and closer to taking graduate school for
granted.
There will probably be a lot of shouting about draft defer
ments during the next year, but that's because it is an election
year, and everyone shouts about everything.
"But graduate student deferments are something else."
The General, who was wearing a blue suit, white shirt, blue
knit tie, and black shoes, explained how Congress set up the
present system for deferring graduate students (that is, not
deferring any except those in the health fields and those
deemed necessary to national security.) He talked about the
Burke Marshall committee and its recommendations and
about the make-up of the National Security Council. Hershey
felt that the National Security Council might not accept the
recommendation of the Inter-Agency Committee which felt
that scientists (including mathematicians) and engineers
should be deferred in the national interest.
"It doesn't take long to approve something and they've had
the report nearly six weeks, so they may be up to something.
We've been on the pan for quite a little while. . . . We have
students who graduate in December who want to know what
to do. We can always tell them to plan on the worst, but we
just don't know. And then we have them graduating at the
end of the semester and then at the end of the trimester, which
can be just about anytime."
He talked about a recent visit to Ohio to speak to presidents
of colleges and universities about the draft. "What they men
tioned which most people on the Hill are not aware of is that
there will be a shortage of graduate students to act as teach
ers. There is anxiety on two parts: they need graduate stu
