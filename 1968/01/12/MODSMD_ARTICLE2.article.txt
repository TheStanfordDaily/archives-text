Pat McMabon talked with General
Hershey in Washington over the Christmas
holidays. From Indiana to October 16th to
the humanities; the coversation continued
for over two hours.

1724 F Street, Washington, D.C., is an unmarked light brown
brick building just down the block from the Executive Offices
of the President. No address on it. No sign. Surrounded by
black, white, and grey "for official government use only" auto
mobiles, it is the headquarters of the Selective Service System.
In a spacious office on the sixth floor, General Lewis B.
Hershey directs the operation of the draft. His office is lined
with 55 flags, and on the walls are pictures of past directors of
the Selective Service. I talked with General Hershey in his
office for over two hours during the Christmas holidays.
Leaning back into his padded leather chair, Hershey spoke
about student deferments. "Unless there is some strong re
action that comes from public disgust at the behavior of a mi
nority of students—a minority, a few hundred or a few thou
sand—student deferments will probably continue. We are aw
fully close to taking four years of college for granted, just as
we once took eighth grade or high school for granted, and we
are even getting closer and closer to taking graduate school for
granted.
There will probably be a lot of shouting about draft defer
ments during the next year, but that's because it is an election
year, and everyone shouts about everything.
"But graduate student deferments are something else."
The General, who was wearing a blue suit, white shirt, blue
knit tie, and black shoes, explained how Congress set up the
present system for deferring graduate students (that is, not
deferring any except those in the health fields and those
deemed necessary to national security.) He talked about the
Burke Marshall committee and its recommendations and
about the make-up of the National Security Council. Hershey
felt that the National Security Council might not accept the
recommendation of the Inter-Agency Committee which felt
that scientists (including mathematicians) and engineers
should be deferred in the national interest.
"It doesn't take long to approve something and they've had
the report nearly six weeks, so they may be up to something.
We've been on the pan for quite a little while. . . . We have
students who graduate in December who want to know what
to do. We can always tell them to plan on the worst, but we
just don't know. And then we have them graduating at the
end of the semester and then at the end of the trimester, which
can be just about anytime."
He talked about a recent visit to Ohio to speak to presidents
of colleges and universities about the draft. "What they men
tioned which most people on the Hill are not aware of is that
there will be a shortage of graduate students to act as teach
ers. There is anxiety on two parts: they need graduate stu

dents to teach and they need graduate students to do research
on the grants they get from the government and from other
places."
I asked him about the humanities. If graduate students are
deferred only in the sciences, many people have said it will
cause permanent damage to the humanities. How do you feel
about this?
"I come from the area of the humanities, myself. . . . My
A.B. was a classical degree, which they gave then, which
would be like a liberal arts degree today. So I have a great
deal of sympathy with these people. As an individual, rational
izing, feeling that I'm of some importance, I fear that with all
these technological changes today, we can't even live on this
earth.
"Of course you realize that more of the humanities-types are
the protestors." He went on to explain that an engineering
course was much more difficult and that Engineering students
do not protest as much. "Sometimes 60 per cent are flunked
out, (they) don't have time for that.
"Also, the average person is more impressed by the wonders
of the world of science than of my world . . . the public is
more impressed with a technological achievement than with
your poem. The scientific world has had its innings for a long
time." He also suggested that the public is more impressed
with the length of time it takes to learn the sciences and medi
cine.
Hershey went on to talk about opposition to the war in
Vietnam and about the stop-the-draft demonstrations. "Oppo
sition to wars is not new. There are some new things however.
Television—the picture—has more influence on people. The
protestors, if they're smart, will make use of this by doing
what the photographers can see.
"We haven't always been a law-abiding people. After all,
what can you expect when we were settled by people who left
somewhere else. Disrespect for the law is increasing; people
disobey the law when they speed . . . and they often break the
law to show the sincerity of their cause.
"I am an optimist though. I think the pendulum has swung
as far as it's going to go, and people will begin to obey the
laws more and more."
As he rubbed the handle of his brief case which was sitting
on a table behind his desk, Hershey recalled, "The draft has
always come under fire during wartime. You know, in the
Armed Service, we like to think that the politicians—the civili
ans—are the ones that get us into war, but that we have to
solve the problem of getting us out of it —we're the peace
makers.
"We haven't had draft problems like during the Civil War.
We haven't had it that bad yet. On October 16, at the induc
tion centers we didn't have a single person who refused to be
inducted, and those who didn't come or didn't make it on the
right day all made it by the end of the week.
"It is the good idealistic people who cause more trouble,
such as members of the clergy and the faculty. It is just like
businessmen or very practical people coming into a classroom
and asking questions about what learning is being done and
what practical use is it."
Hershey reported that during the week of October 16, 618
cards had been turned in. He said, "When the cards began to
come, we got sacks of just about everything. First, we sent
the cards back to the local boards and then sent them a letter
explaining what regulations we have." This letter, sent out on
October 26, is the now famous Hershey memorandum "to all
members of the Selective Service System" in which he said
that "anything that violates the Military Selective Service Act
of the Regulations, or the related processes cannot be in the
National interest," and therefore those participating in such
activities should be denied deferments because deferments are
in the National interest.
He said that in his letter the term " 'recruitment' was used
rather loosely," and he meant military recruiting, not demon
strations against the CIA and Dow Chemical. "I don't want
my deferred registrants stopping other people who want to
enlist from doing so. I don't care whether the recruiting is on
or off the campus, but I don't want them interfering with it."
He regretted that his order was taken by some draft boards
to mean legal demonstrations. "I have no quarrel with parades
or expressing one's opinion. I have been to Hyde Park many
times and seen the police keep people from interfering with
other people's freedom of speech. What I object is when you

start stopping people from doing what they want to do—like
the protestors are doing."
"We had a saying on the farm in Indiana," Hershey said, as
he threw a left hook in the air, "a man's liberty ends just be
fore he comes to another man's nose."
Hershey commented on several other things:
On college presidents, referring to demonstrations on cam
puses: "I've got a lot of sympathy for them; they've got a hell
of a job on their hands."
On his relations with the press: "If you want to get the dirt
on me, just read the Washington Post or the New York Times."
On President Johnson: "I have known the President for the
last twenty years, but don't get the idea that we're buddy
buddy."
I was struck by an index card-size sign pasted on the far
wall of his reception room. It read: "LOOK ALIVE: You can
be replaced by a button." And not far away was an auto
graphed LBJ.
Hershey, 74, has been attacked in the press quite often in
recent months. He is old and functionally blind.
I said to the General, 'The Washington Post, The Chicago
Daily News, and many others have called for your retirement.
Just what are your plans for retirement?"
"I haven't any.
"I'm aware of the fact that age is a factor, but so is health.
If I should get sick, I'm not saying that I wouldn't step down."
Before I left, the General told me the stories of the various
flags that deck his office. It was almost like going through
Lewis B. Hershey s scrapbook of 28 years as the grand old
man of conscription, especially as he showed me the flag of
the Lewis B. Hershey Chapter of the Beserve Officers Asso
ciation.
