# The 						condition of the American spirit
## Needed: a new voice of leadership 
### marya marines 
The Stanford daily magazine this tveei
sents the first part of a two-part series o;
cles on "The Condition of the Ann
Spirit."
In this issue, the views of Marya Mc
Dr. Billy Graham, and Dr. James J. Kavai
are presented. The final five articles next
are written by J. Edgar Hoover, Bayard
tin, Saul Bellow, Arthur Schlesinger ]r
Er'ch Fromm.

At a suburban movie theater, eight unac
companied children from 6 to 10 years old see
Bonnie and Clyde and follow with dazzled
eyes their bloody search for identity through
murder.
In a hotel ballroom, leaders of culture sit on
gold chairs and listen to panelists conclude that
culture is part of life and must be supported.
In a bedroom strewn with mattresses, six
teenagers get high on pot, adrift in fantasy.
In city ghettos black militants yell "Kill
VVhitey!" and not too far away white youths
hurl rocks at civil-rights marchers and scream,
"Christ was white!"
Teachers revolt, priests revolt, citizens revolt
for reasons as diverse as they are complex or
obvious.
An increasing number of Americans view the
war in Vietnam with emotions ranging from
doubt to horror, while other millions believe
in military solutions leading to victory.
Why this ferment bordering on anarchy in
the richest and most powerful nation on earth?
Why, even among the passive or apathetic, this
pervasive unease? I think it is largely because
a lot of things we used to believe are no longer
so, and because our wish to cling to them—on
the part of some—and our wish to discard them
—on the part of others— has produced a civil
war of the American soul, with tragic casualties
in sight.
It is a cold war on many fronts. Between the
young and the old, between rich and poor, be
tween black and white, between Bight and
Left, between law and anarchy, between rea
son and violence.
On all these fronts the war has become a hot
war because its conclusion—the future of our
society—can no longer be postponed. In fact,
the war is the disastrous result of postpone
ment. For years during which the fabric of our
society has been fraying and rotting, most
Americans have been clothing themselves in a
series of assumptions, whether liberal or con
servative, which arc just as threadbare when
exposed to reality.
Here are some of them, with their shadow
questions:
Money buys security. (Against crime?
Against pollution? Against congestion? Against
addiction?)

The pursuit of happiness is the great Ameri
can dream. (Whose happiness? Yours or theirs?
Can the individual be happy in an unhappy
society? Can he remain well in a sick one?)
Welfare takes care of the poor. (Does it? At
what cost to us—and to them?)
Uuder free competition, the consumer gets
w v iat he wants. (Does he? Or are his wants
manipulated to large extent by the great Sell
ers? )
Democracy and capitalism are the pillars of
a free society and therefore morally right.
(Right for whom? At what stage of develop
ment? In what part of the world? Whose moral
ity?)
Socialism and communism are morally evil
and therefore threaten our existence, ( Because
their ideas are stronger than ours? Because
they use force and we don't? Don't we? If we
are both strong and morally right, what are we
afraid of?)
Man's prime function is as provider, woman's
as homemaker. (Does either of these functions
fill their lives or complete their beings? Are
these still valid images for intelligent young
people in a society demanding their involve
ment?)
Everybody should have a higher education.

To most of us now, nothing seems stable, nothing certain in the bewildering, tormen
ted chaos of the present except close human relationships and love of country which
makes its present convulsions even more painful. For they are symptoms of a sickness
as yet undiagnosed.

(Even when he doesn't want it? Even if his
talents lie elsewhere? Even if the education
itself is outdated?)
And so it goes, in those American minds not
closed to doubt by doctrine and dogma, by
smugness and complacency, or by the danger
ous incapacity to put themselves into the minds
and hearts of others.
But to most of us now, nothing seems stable,
nothing certain in the bewildering, tormented
chaos of the present except close human rela
tionships and a love of country which makes
its present convulsions even more painful. For
they are symptoms of a sickness as yet undiag
nosed.
Doctors insist that a national health plan
would be Socialized medicine' while an acute
and growing shortage of physicians, nurses, and
hospital facilities leaves an increasing number
of Americans without adaquate care.
Labor unions demand higher and higher
wages while standards of workmanship in
many trades fall lower and lower. (Who hasn't
spoken or heard this phrase: "They don't care
anymore?")
All over the country the conservatives be
moan the lost values of an earlier and simpler
America while liberals are beginning to won-

der where the line can be held between equal
rights and equal lawlessness. Where does "law
and order" become repressive force? Where
does freedom become anarchy?
There is, alas, nobody to tell them. There are
plenty of voices telling them different things
but no real voice of leadership in the nation
clarifying the issues, demanding of Americans
the best that is in them, requiring of them the
kind of effort and restraint without which no
civilized society can endure.
No less so than any other form of govern
ment, a democracy reflects its leadership. And
when that leadership loses the trust and heart
and will if its people—especially of its youth
—deep divisions splinter and weaken the na
tional core.
And what of the wise men of society—the
poets and philosophers, the scientists and art
ists, those through their creative insight have
so often shown us the truth long before politi
cal leaders and the people themselves have per
ceived it?
With a few notable exceptions, the intellec
tual community has helped to compound our
spiritual chaos. We are told by many voices
that standards no longer apply, that there is no
good or evil, right or wrong; that the function

of the artist is to express himself rather than
communicate with others, that it is enough for
him to reflect the violence and anarchy in our
life without providing a vision of a better one.
In the name of culture where no distinction is
made between the amateur and the profession
al, between the serious worker and the dood
ling exhibitionist, between shock for effect and
the shock of truth, we are told that what is new
is important and what was past is dead. We are
told (by our government as well) that what the
average citizen doesn't understand is good for
him.
The state of American spirit? I would say it
was in turmoil, frustration, doubt, and suspen
sion; waiting for a brave and enlightened voice
not only to acknowledge its anguish but to lead
it forward into new resolve.
The American spirit is capable of anything;
including the self-disciplines and generous in
stincts which have produced the finest hours
in our history as a nation. If these qualities are
not soon evoked, the violence which has always
been so near the surface of the American soul
will take their place and become its chronic
climate. For this, all of us—guilty or innocent,
black or white, rich or poor, conservative or lib
eral—will pay bitterly.

in military solutions leading to victory.
Why this ferment bordering on anarchy in
the richest and most powerful nation on earth?
Why, even among the passive or apathetic, this
pervasive unease? I think it is largely because
a lot of things we used to believe are no longer
so, and because our wish to cling to them—on
the part of some—and our wish to discard them
—on the part of others— has produced a civil
war of the American soul, with tragic casualties
in sight.
It is a cold war on many fronts. Between the
young and the old, between rich and poor, be
tween black and white, between Bight and
Left, between law and anarchy, between rea
son and violence.
On all these fronts the war has become a hot
war because its conclusion—the future of our
society—can no longer be postponed. In fact,
the war is the disastrous result of postpone
ment. For years during which the fabric of our
society has been fraying and rotting, most
Americans have been clothing themselves in a
series of assumptions, whether liberal or con
servative, which arc just as threadbare when
exposed to reality.
Here are some of them, with their shadow
questions:
Money buys security. (Against crime?
Against pollution? Against congestion? Against
addiction?)

The pursuit of happiness is the great Ameri
can dream. (Whose happiness? Yours or theirs?
Can the individual be happy in an unhappy
society? Can he remain well in a sick one?)
Welfare takes care of the poor. (Does it? At
what cost to us—and to them?)
Uuder free competition, the consumer gets
w v iat he wants. (Does he? Or are his wants
manipulated to large extent by the great Sell
ers? )
Democracy and capitalism are the pillars of
a free society and therefore morally right.
(Right for whom? At what stage of develop
ment? In what part of the world? Whose moral
ity?)
Socialism and communism are morally evil
and therefore threaten our existence, ( Because
their ideas are stronger than ours? Because
they use force and we don't? Don't we? If we
are both strong and morally right, what are we
afraid of?)
Man's prime function is as provider, woman's
as homemaker. (Does either of these functions
fill their lives or complete their beings? Are
these still valid images for intelligent young
people in a society demanding their involve
ment?)
Everybody should have a higher education.

To most of us now, nothing seems stable, nothing certain in the bewildering, tormen
ted chaos of the present except close human relationships and love of country which
makes its present convulsions even more painful. For they are symptoms of a sickness
as yet undiagnosed.

(Even when he doesn't want it? Even if his
talents lie elsewhere? Even if the education
itself is outdated?)
And so it goes, in those American minds not
closed to doubt by doctrine and dogma, by
smugness and complacency, or by the danger
ous incapacity to put themselves into the minds
and hearts of others.
But to most of us now, nothing seems stable,
nothing certain in the bewildering, tormented
chaos of the present except close human rela
tionships and a love of country which makes
its present convulsions even more painful. For
they are symptoms of a sickness as yet undiag
nosed.
Doctors insist that a national health plan
would be Socialized medicine' while an acute
and growing shortage of physicians, nurses, and
hospital facilities leaves an increasing number
of Americans without adaquate care.
Labor unions demand higher and higher
wages while standards of workmanship in
many trades fall lower and lower. (Who hasn't
spoken or heard this phrase: "They don't care
anymore?")
All over the country the conservatives be
moan the lost values of an earlier and simpler
America while liberals are beginning to won-

der where the line can be held between equal
rights and equal lawlessness. Where does "law
and order" become repressive force? Where
does freedom become anarchy?
There is, alas, nobody to tell them. There are
plenty of voices telling them different things
but no real voice of leadership in the nation
clarifying the issues, demanding of Americans
the best that is in them, requiring of them the
kind of effort and restraint without which no
civilized society can endure.
No less so than any other form of govern
ment, a democracy reflects its leadership. And
when that leadership loses the trust and heart
and will if its people—especially of its youth
—deep divisions splinter and weaken the na
tional core.
And what of the wise men of society—the
poets and philosophers, the scientists and art
ists, those through their creative insight have
so often shown us the truth long before politi
cal leaders and the people themselves have per
ceived it?
With a few notable exceptions, the intellec
tual community has helped to compound our
spiritual chaos. We are told by many voices
that standards no longer apply, that there is no
good or evil, right or wrong; that the function

of the artist is to express himself rather than
communicate with others, that it is enough for
him to reflect the violence and anarchy in our
life without providing a vision of a better one.
In the name of culture where no distinction is
made between the amateur and the profession
al, between the serious worker and the dood
ling exhibitionist, between shock for effect and
the shock of truth, we are told that what is new
is important and what was past is dead. We are
told (by our government as well) that what the
average citizen doesn't understand is good for
him.
The state of American spirit? I would say it
was in turmoil, frustration, doubt, and suspen
sion; waiting for a brave and enlightened voice
not only to acknowledge its anguish but to lead
it forward into new resolve.
The American spirit is capable of anything;
including the self-disciplines and generous in
stincts which have produced the finest hours
in our history as a nation. If these qualities are
not soon evoked, the violence which has always
been so near the surface of the American soul
will take their place and become its chronic
climate. For this, all of us—guilty or innocent,
black or white, rich or poor, conservative or lib
eral—will pay bitterly.

The pursuit of happiness is the great Ameri
can dream. (Whose happiness? Yours or theirs?
Can the individual be happy in an unhappy
society? Can he remain well in a sick one?)
Welfare takes care of the poor. (Does it? At
what cost to us—and to them?)
Uuder free competition, the consumer gets
w v iat he wants. (Does he? Or are his wants
manipulated to large extent by the great Sell
ers? )
Democracy and capitalism are the pillars of
a free society and therefore morally right.
(Right for whom? At what stage of develop
ment? In what part of the world? Whose moral
ity?)
Socialism and communism are morally evil
and therefore threaten our existence, ( Because
their ideas are stronger than ours? Because
they use force and we don't? Don't we? If we
are both strong and morally right, what are we
afraid of?)
Man's prime function is as provider, woman's
as homemaker. (Does either of these functions
fill their lives or complete their beings? Are
these still valid images for intelligent young
people in a society demanding their involve
ment?)
Everybody should have a higher education.

To most of us now, nothing seems stable, nothing certain in the bewildering, tormen
ted chaos of the present except close human relationships and love of country which
makes its present convulsions even more painful. For they are symptoms of a sickness
as yet undiagnosed.

(Even when he doesn't want it? Even if his
talents lie elsewhere? Even if the education
itself is outdated?)
And so it goes, in those American minds not
closed to doubt by doctrine and dogma, by
smugness and complacency, or by the danger
ous incapacity to put themselves into the minds
and hearts of others.
But to most of us now, nothing seems stable,
nothing certain in the bewildering, tormented
chaos of the present except close human rela
tionships and a love of country which makes
its present convulsions even more painful. For
they are symptoms of a sickness as yet undiag
nosed.
Doctors insist that a national health plan
would be Socialized medicine' while an acute
and growing shortage of physicians, nurses, and
hospital facilities leaves an increasing number
of Americans without adaquate care.
Labor unions demand higher and higher
wages while standards of workmanship in
many trades fall lower and lower. (Who hasn't
spoken or heard this phrase: "They don't care
anymore?")
All over the country the conservatives be
moan the lost values of an earlier and simpler
America while liberals are beginning to won-

der where the line can be held between equal
rights and equal lawlessness. Where does "law
and order" become repressive force? Where
does freedom become anarchy?
There is, alas, nobody to tell them. There are
plenty of voices telling them different things
but no real voice of leadership in the nation
clarifying the issues, demanding of Americans
the best that is in them, requiring of them the
kind of effort and restraint without which no
civilized society can endure.
No less so than any other form of govern
ment, a democracy reflects its leadership. And
when that leadership loses the trust and heart
and will if its people—especially of its youth
—deep divisions splinter and weaken the na
tional core.
And what of the wise men of society—the
poets and philosophers, the scientists and art
ists, those through their creative insight have
so often shown us the truth long before politi
cal leaders and the people themselves have per
ceived it?
With a few notable exceptions, the intellec
tual community has helped to compound our
spiritual chaos. We are told by many voices
that standards no longer apply, that there is no
good or evil, right or wrong; that the function

of the artist is to express himself rather than
communicate with others, that it is enough for
him to reflect the violence and anarchy in our
life without providing a vision of a better one.
In the name of culture where no distinction is
made between the amateur and the profession
al, between the serious worker and the dood
ling exhibitionist, between shock for effect and
the shock of truth, we are told that what is new
is important and what was past is dead. We are
told (by our government as well) that what the
average citizen doesn't understand is good for
him.
The state of American spirit? I would say it
was in turmoil, frustration, doubt, and suspen
sion; waiting for a brave and enlightened voice
not only to acknowledge its anguish but to lead
it forward into new resolve.
The American spirit is capable of anything;
including the self-disciplines and generous in
stincts which have produced the finest hours
in our history as a nation. If these qualities are
not soon evoked, the violence which has always
been so near the surface of the American soul
will take their place and become its chronic
climate. For this, all of us—guilty or innocent,
black or white, rich or poor, conservative or lib
eral—will pay bitterly.

Why this ferment bordering on anarchy in
the richest and most powerful nation on earth?
Why, even among the passive or apathetic, this
pervasive unease? I think it is largely because
a lot of things we used to believe are no longer
so, and because our wish to cling to them—on
the part of some—and our wish to discard them
—on the part of others— has produced a civil
war of the American soul, with tragic casualties
in sight.
It is a cold war on many fronts. Between the
young and the old, between rich and poor, be
tween black and white, between Bight and
Left, between law and anarchy, between rea
son and violence.
On all these fronts the war has become a hot
war because its conclusion—the future of our
society—can no longer be postponed. In fact,
the war is the disastrous result of postpone
ment. For years during which the fabric of our
society has been fraying and rotting, most
Americans have been clothing themselves in a
series of assumptions, whether liberal or con
servative, which arc just as threadbare when
exposed to reality.

makes its present convulsions even more painful. For they are symptoms of a sickness
as yet undiagnosed.

(Even when he doesn't want it? Even if his
talents lie elsewhere? Even if the education
itself is outdated?)
And so it goes, in those American minds not
closed to doubt by doctrine and dogma, by
smugness and complacency, or by the danger
ous incapacity to put themselves into the minds
and hearts of others.
But to most of us now, nothing seems stable,
nothing certain in the bewildering, tormented
chaos of the present except close human rela
tionships and a love of country which makes
its present convulsions even more painful. For
they are symptoms of a sickness as yet undiag
nosed.
Doctors insist that a national health plan
would be Socialized medicine' while an acute
and growing shortage of physicians, nurses, and
hospital facilities leaves an increasing number
of Americans without adaquate care.
Labor unions demand higher and higher
wages while standards of workmanship in
many trades fall lower and lower. (Who hasn't
spoken or heard this phrase: "They don't care
anymore?")
All over the country the conservatives be
moan the lost values of an earlier and simpler
America while liberals are beginning to won-

der where the line can be held between equal
rights and equal lawlessness. Where does "law
and order" become repressive force? Where
does freedom become anarchy?
There is, alas, nobody to tell them. There are
plenty of voices telling them different things
but no real voice of leadership in the nation
clarifying the issues, demanding of Americans
the best that is in them, requiring of them the
kind of effort and restraint without which no
civilized society can endure.
No less so than any other form of govern
ment, a democracy reflects its leadership. And
when that leadership loses the trust and heart
and will if its people—especially of its youth
—deep divisions splinter and weaken the na
tional core.
And what of the wise men of society—the
poets and philosophers, the scientists and art
ists, those through their creative insight have
so often shown us the truth long before politi
cal leaders and the people themselves have per
ceived it?
With a few notable exceptions, the intellec
tual community has helped to compound our
spiritual chaos. We are told by many voices
that standards no longer apply, that there is no
good or evil, right or wrong; that the function

of the artist is to express himself rather than
communicate with others, that it is enough for
him to reflect the violence and anarchy in our
life without providing a vision of a better one.
In the name of culture where no distinction is
made between the amateur and the profession
al, between the serious worker and the dood
ling exhibitionist, between shock for effect and
the shock of truth, we are told that what is new
is important and what was past is dead. We are
told (by our government as well) that what the
average citizen doesn't understand is good for
him.
The state of American spirit? I would say it
was in turmoil, frustration, doubt, and suspen
sion; waiting for a brave and enlightened voice
not only to acknowledge its anguish but to lead
it forward into new resolve.
The American spirit is capable of anything;
including the self-disciplines and generous in
stincts which have produced the finest hours
in our history as a nation. If these qualities are
not soon evoked, the violence which has always
been so near the surface of the American soul
will take their place and become its chronic
climate. For this, all of us—guilty or innocent,
black or white, rich or poor, conservative or lib
eral—will pay bitterly.

At a suburban movie theater, eight unac
companied children from 6 to 10 years old see
Bonnie and Clyde and follow with dazzled
eyes their bloody search for identity through
murder.
In a hotel ballroom, leaders of culture sit on
gold chairs and listen to panelists conclude that
culture is part of life and must be supported.
In a bedroom strewn with mattresses, six
teenagers get high on pot, adrift in fantasy.
In city ghettos black militants yell "Kill
VVhitey!" and not too far away white youths
hurl rocks at civil-rights marchers and scream,
"Christ was white!"
Teachers revolt, priests revolt, citizens revolt
for reasons as diverse as they are complex or
obvious.
An increasing number of Americans view the
war in Vietnam with emotions ranging from
doubt to horror, while other millions believe
in military solutions leading to victory.
Why this ferment bordering on anarchy in
the richest and most powerful nation on earth?
Why, even among the passive or apathetic, this
pervasive unease? I think it is largely because
a lot of things we used to believe are no longer
so, and because our wish to cling to them—on
the part of some—and our wish to discard them
—on the part of others— has produced a civil
war of the American soul, with tragic casualties
in sight.
It is a cold war on many fronts. Between the
young and the old, between rich and poor, be
tween black and white, between Bight and
Left, between law and anarchy, between rea
son and violence.
On all these fronts the war has become a hot
war because its conclusion—the future of our
society—can no longer be postponed. In fact,
the war is the disastrous result of postpone
ment. For years during which the fabric of our
society has been fraying and rotting, most
Americans have been clothing themselves in a
series of assumptions, whether liberal or con
servative, which arc just as threadbare when
exposed to reality.
Here are some of them, with their shadow
questions:
Money buys security. (Against crime?
Against pollution? Against congestion? Against
addiction?)

The pursuit of happiness is the great Ameri
can dream. (Whose happiness? Yours or theirs?
Can the individual be happy in an unhappy
society? Can he remain well in a sick one?)
Welfare takes care of the poor. (Does it? At
what cost to us—and to them?)
Uuder free competition, the consumer gets
w v iat he wants. (Does he? Or are his wants
manipulated to large extent by the great Sell
ers? )
Democracy and capitalism are the pillars of
a free society and therefore morally right.
(Right for whom? At what stage of develop
ment? In what part of the world? Whose moral
ity?)
Socialism and communism are morally evil
and therefore threaten our existence, ( Because
their ideas are stronger than ours? Because
they use force and we don't? Don't we? If we
are both strong and morally right, what are we
afraid of?)
Man's prime function is as provider, woman's
as homemaker. (Does either of these functions
fill their lives or complete their beings? Are
these still valid images for intelligent young
people in a society demanding their involve
ment?)
Everybody should have a higher education.
