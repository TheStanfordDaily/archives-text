The twentieth century will undoubtedly go
down in history as the century of revolution.
Almost every day we read in our newspapers
of another revolution somewhere in the world.
Many are of a violent nature, indicative of the
inner conflicts that beset mankind.
The chronicling of wars, rebellion, crime,
rioting, and revolutions make disturbing read
ing. Daily we are conscious that something is
wrong with the human race.
Why, with all our heralded progress in the
educational, scientific and philosophical fields,
do these old conflicts remain? Why can't we
extricate ourselves from the human dilemma?
Why are our problems beyond us, and why
do the solutions of human ills evade and es
cape us? Why does the human condition, in
stead of improving and keeping pace with our
technological developments, grow worse in
stead of better? Why does the world tremble
under the threat of a third world war when
its peoples should be walking in peace, under
standing and prosperity?
These questions furrow the brows of our
greatest scientists and philosophers and. be
cause no valid answers are available, have
caused a frustration among the world's peo
ples bordering upon psychotic trauma and ill
ness.
While we are trying to hypnotize ourselves
into believing that we have a great society—
and in many ways it is great —some of our
leaders, like Senator Fulbright, are saying that
it is sick. In a sense I agree with the Senator.
Why is it that with all our "war on poverty"
programs — which, incidentally, I support —
there are still millions of poor people in af
fluent America? Why do ghettos exist in the
richest nation in the world? Why is it that
with all our talk of national unity we are so
divided? Why is it that with all the progress
made in civil rights there is racial rioting and
bloodshed in our streets? Why is it that with
all our "war on crime" that crime is mush
rooming until our city streets have been
turned into virtual jungles? And why is it that
with all the new sex freedom and knowledge
we are more frustrated, confused and obsessed
with sex than ever?
The great question we ask ourselves is: "Is
there a way out? Can we escape the "house of
mirrors' in which we find ourselves?" I have
been accused of being a moral "alarmist" who

leans on the panic button too hard, but I have
travelled over the world too much, talked pri
vately to too many national leaders, and sifted
the fears and concerns of the average Ameri
can too many times to be overly optimistic
about the moral and spiritual state of our na
tion. While undue optimism may be the quirk
of an unsettled mind, and undue pessimism
the result of an unsettled stomach, I see noth
ing wrong in being a realist, in seeing things
as they are. While a man should be arrested
for turning in a fire alarm when there is no
fire, he should not be criticized by sounding
an alarm when the whole town is ablaze—and
I believe that our nation is in danger of being
mined with high explosives, and that it is high
time to recruit a "detonation crew" which can
successfully relieve the anxieties and fears
that haunt the nation.
As Americans we have all the elements for
security, but we are insecure. A distinguished
Britisher said recently that he visited an Amer
ican home with three cars in the garage, a
gorgeous living room with color television, a
kitchen filled with the latest appliances and a
beautiful pool with a large patio, but the lady
of the house was reading a book entitled
"How To Be Happy"!
Why?
Recently I had breakfast with my friend,
Walter Reuther. He spoke with great enthu
siasm about the technological breakthrough
that is taking place.
He exclaimed: "We are on the verge of
paradise."
I replied, "Walter, there is only one flaw,
and that is human nature."
He replied, "That's the flaw."
I believe that the condition of the American
spirit is due to our adherence to several illu
sions. We are like a man I know in Florida
who threw the anchor to his new boat over
board and took a long nap, only to awaken
and discover that the anchor rope was not tied
to the boat and that he had drifted far out to
sea.
While I would be the last to try to turn the
clock of history backward, I am of the convic
tion that we have trusted in anchors not tied
to the ship. We have followed sociological and
philosophical will-o'-the wisps, and we are ex
periencing a rude awakening.
The first illusion is that money and things
bring happiness and peace of mind. Material
ism without God in America is not much dif

ferent from materialism without God in a
Communist country. Adlai Stevenson, in com
menting upon our obsession with materialism,
quoted a significant verse from the Scriptures:
"He gave them their request; but sent lean
ness into their soul."
The American dream was the desire to give
to every man, regardless of national origin, a
place in the sun and an opportunity to live in
security and freedom. The miracle of America
emerged! Overnight paupers were turned into
kings. We became the richest nation in the
history of the world. Then something began to
happen deep inside of us. We threw our
shoulders back and said, in effect, "See what
we have done! See the golden calf we have
fashioned with our own hands!" We fell vic
tim to the illusion of the primacy of "things"
and drifted from the spiritual genius which
made America great.
What makes a nation great? Its dreams, its
hope, its philosophies, its ideals and its reli
gious faith. When these are lost we become
sick, bored and devoid of great motivation.
This is one of the reasons we now have the
"hippie" movement. The hippies are revolting
against affluency. A movie star I know related
to me recently how his son had dropped out
of the University of California to become a
hippie. He said: "Father, I hate you, and I
want you to know why I hate you. I hate you
because you have given me too much. I have
never had to struggle, or work, or fight! I hate
you for it!"
Affluency without moral standards, self-dis
cipline and religious faith will act like a boom
erang.
The second illusion widely held in America
is our belief that peace is a cause rather than
an effect. We fought World War I, World
War 11, the Korean War, and are now fighting
a strange war in Vietnam, and we were told
that each of them was being fought to "pre
serve the peace." We talk of peace, we march
for peace, we support peace efforts in the
United Nations, and we attend scores of peace
conferences across the world. Still there is no
peace. Ezekiel the prophet was right when he
said: ". . . they have seduced my people, say
ing, Peace; and there was no peace," and Jere
miah the prophet when he said: . . Peace,
peace; when there is no peace."
We have not yet gotten to the root cause of
war. The Bible says:"From whence come
wars and fightings among you? Come they not
hence, even of your own lusts? (James 4:1)."
There will never be peace in the world until
individuals have peace in their hearts. So long
as there is greed, lust, and hate in the world
there will be fighting and war. At best we can
only put a patch here and a bit of ointment
there. The achievement of peace is as compli
cated as the human spirit, and too much time
is spent in trying to change the world instead
of trying to change the men who make the
world what it is.
The third illusion is the belief that man is
naturally good. I wish that were true, but un
fortunately our news media each day reports
scores of incidents that indicate that some
thing is basically wrong with man. Jeremiah
once said: "The heart is deceitful above all
things, and desperately wicked: who can
know it?"
Where did we get the idea that man is nat
urally good? We did not get it from the
Greeks! Aristotle said: "There is no good in
mankind ... for man was born to evil."
Neither did we get it from Judaism. Isaiah


(The Rev. B illy
Graham believes that
a change in human
nature is needed if
the American dream
is to survive. He be
lieves rebell'ousness
is a flaw of man
which must be over
come before peace
can be achieved.)
said: "All we like sheep have gone astray; we
have turned every one to his own way."
Where then did we get the idea that man
is inherently good? We got it from the ex
ponents of expurgation—from people like Sig
mund Freud, who said that man is a helpless
creature of his environment; or from Marx,
who taught that man is good and that society
is evil; or from Nietzsche, who taught that

There will never be peace in the world until individuals have peace in their hearts*
So long as there is greed, lust, and hate in the world there will be fighting and war.

God is dead. The idea that man is good but
that circumstances, environment and society
have made him the undesirable character he
is, is a false illusion. Man is rebellious by na
ture, and the first rebellion was committed in
Paradise — where the environment was per
fect!
The fourth illusion is that religion without
personal commitment and involvement is
enough. I have no quarrel with Marx when he
said: "Religion is the opiate of the people."
Pseudo-religion has been a cloak to cover
many a vile deed and mask the selfish motives
of millions. When I go to a university to ad
dress students I never try to defend religion.
Some of the bloodiest wars of history have
been fought in the name of religion. Preju
dice, pride, bickering, and even slavery have
characterized religious people. I cannot de
fend all that has gone on in the name of Chris
tianity. However, I am trying to call people
back to a simple Jesus who said: "Love your
neighbor as yourself." This is why Arnold
Toynbee believed that "the outlook for the
West would be unpromising if there were to
be no genuine religious revival."
I do not contend for mere religious revival,
for religion per se, Religion as form, is flour
ishing. I do call for a renewal of a vital per
sonal faith that will get at the root of oxir
problems by changing the men who cause our
problems. The great question is: "How can
we re-discover the faith which was once a
dynamic, revolutionary, life-changing force in
our society? I can only speak from experi
ence, but 25 years of proclaiming a gospel to
revolutionize men has demonstrated that there
is hope for any and every person who will
take God seriously. God in Christ is the great
est revolutionist of all time. The word "revo
lution" means "a complete or drastic change",
and Christ's dialectic was revolutionary. He
talked about change, not in government, not
in culture, but in the human heart. Most revo
lutions are accomplished by violence and by
dramatic events, but not so with the the spiri
tual revolution that Christ brings. Like the
quiet power of spring when new life surges
through nature—giving the trees color, the
flowers new beauty, and the whole world a
new freshness and a new hope—Christ comes
quietly, touching our lives with a new radi
ance, a new meaning, a new purpose, a new
glow, and bringing with it a new satisfaction.
I am convinced that many of our leaders
and much of our news media are unaware
that there is already going on at this moment
in America a "quiet revolution", and it could
reverse many of the disturbing trends in our
society. As I travel from coast to coast I find

that thousands are searching for peace of
mind, a reason for living, and a personal rela
tionship with God. I spoke for three evenings
on television during the month of August at
prime evening time, and within a matter of
eight days I had received more than a half a
million letters. Most of these letters came
from people pouring out their hearts, indi
cating a desperate inward search for peace of

soul. I find this true from Birmingham to New
York and from Kansas City to Los Angeles.
Modern man is saying with David: "As the
hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth
my soul after thee, O God."
I believe something vital and historic is be
ginning to happen in America. There is a life
changing force and a society-changing power
at work. The historian Lecky said of John
Wesley, the founder of the Methodist Church:
"When he was converted it was a national
epoch." Out of the Wesley an revivals came the
social revolutions of Great Britain that even
tually led to social reform in America. Out of
it came the emancipation of the slaves, an end

to child labor, the British labor movement, the
YMCA, and many other social and political ef
fects.
In Raleigh, N.C., a few weeks ago 5,000 Ne
groes of the General Baptist State Convention
marched through the streets of North Caro
lina's capital city, singing "I Have Decided To
Follow Jesus" and "Onward Christian Sol
diers". They wanted to show to the world their
Christian faith and their good citizenship in
the midst of a summer filled with rioting and
rebellion. Their demonstration was not on a
single national television program, and it was
not reported in the national press. The chief
of police in Raleigh made the comment that if

there had been a riot in Raleigh the town
would have been loaded with cameramen and
press people.
This quiet, noiseless revolution is going on
in the tens of millions of Americans, and I am
convinced that "truth crushed to earth will
rise again." Thousands of prayer groups and
Bible study groups are springing up from
coast to coast. In many of these groups, Jews,
Catholics and Protestants are meeting together
in their desperate search for life's true mean
ing.
Yes, there is a quiet revolution going on,
and anyone reading these words is a candi
date for this revolution. Most of us face prob
lems that are beyond us. The state of the
world, the threat of war, the boredom, the
purposelessness of living in an affluent society
where the challenge has been removed, has
taken all the zing out of life for millions. Per
sonally, I have found the Bible to be the most
exciting textbook for living in the world and
for curing the pitiful condition of modern
America's spirit. Why? Because it works! It
savs: "If any man be in Christ he is a new
creature," and I have found that to be true.
My own life was radically changed a num
ber of years ago in my own experience with
God in Christ. At the moment of this commit
ment it appeared that very little was changed
in my life. There was no flashing lights, no
ringing bells, no singing of angels, but one
thing was sure—l was sincere when I said I
would follow Christ for better or for worse. As
I kept that vow things began to change for
me. I developed an interest in people, a new
love came to me for mankind; I began to be
concerned about the race question, the pover
ty question and the war question. My entire
life underwent a revolution!
World problems are an extension of our in
dividual problems. Look at the world and you
see yourself with all the fear, meaninglessness,
hatred and self-centeredness, but that world
cannot be changed as long as you remain as
you are. Lasting revolution and lasting change
does not take place en masse, but one by one,
as the people's motives, aspirations and atti
tudes are changed. General Mac Arthur once
said: "The world problem is basically a theo
logical one . . . and involves an improvement
in human character." I agree, except that I
would substitute the word "change" for "im
provement". The need is for revolution—the
need is for drastic change—and only God, in
Christ, can remake us into the people we
ought to be. This is the revolution we need.
If we do not have this revolution then I pre
dict that the American dream will not sur
vive!
