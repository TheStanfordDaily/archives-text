# Not sickness but spiritual health
## 
### james j. kavanaugh 
Shortsighted and frightened men equate rev
olution of any kind with death and destruction.
Political revolution means to them the destruc
tion of society. Religious revolution means the
death of God. Hence, they resist the change
they fear to interpret.
Hardly a half century ago, my Church was
still resisting political democracy because it be
lieved that man was too passionate and ignor
ant to govern himself. It longed for the days of
the kings and nobles and treasured its own aris
tocratic status. It opposed modern thought,
refused scholars the right to speculate, and en
forced its infallibility when science was ques
tioning everything that man had ever believed.
It was fighting a losing battle, and the modern
revolt within the churches is the last chapter in
the struggle of man to preserve his dignity.
For such a man, religious arrogance is dead,
be it Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish. The mod
ern Jew will not treat the gentile with the dis
dain of his parents. He will not be satisfied
with kosher laws nor religious festivals which
only highlight his own isolation. Nor will the
Protestant accept a faith without loving deeds,
or identify morality with anti-gambling laws
or smug, cultural preferences. And the Catho
lic, perhaps most of all, will resist the institu
tional Church which has crammed the com
plexities of marriage and divorce, sex and love,
heaven and hell into fierce and unyielding
laws.
The frightened and conservative critic of
such change seems to have a good case when
he sputters and condemns the rebellious spirit
of America. A prominent senator can shout of
a "sick society," an American bishop of tele
vision fame can call this "an age of assassins."
But these are tired men, who cannot hear the
rhythm of history. They are frightened men
who can only stand on the sidelines of life and
curse man's bid for freedom and peace.
Yet, when such men speak, a few will listen
and be afraid. They hear these men talk of the
violence of the racial struggle and the mob rule
in the slums of Newark and Detroit. They hear
their protests about the indifference and self
ishness of modem youth who refuse to fight in
Vietnam. They hear their criticism of sexual
freedom and a diluted morality which makes
each man his own god. They sneer of hippies,
leer at love-ins, and boast of an America which
once had fiber and a responsible sense of sin.
They speak of a dying country which never
lost a war, never feared an oppressor, which
welcomed the immigrant and gave him a job,

which built churches and fought iniquity,
which gave youth an unparalleled opportunity
for education and made of the slum dweller a
company president.
They love America and point to the struggles
of their own youth as evidence of its former
spirit. They decry the materialism which has
made today's youth fat and cynical. They praise
the formulas which they themselves devised,
formulas which promised to make of every man
a patriot, a moral person, a loyal and affection
ate son. They detest experiments, mock vague
and uncertain ideas, reject the pacifist and the
rebel, and they cite the gross national product
as evidence of God's blessing. They point to
past progress and ask for patience. They point
to current discussions at Vatican Councils or in
wordy congresses and ask us to be impressed.
They see themselves as the strong and enlight
ened with a kind of pharisaic vision and they
call fresh minds rash and intemperate if they
dare to disagree.
Such proud and simplistic men are out of
touch. They are the talkers and debaters who
have promised the Negro freedom for a hun
dred years and wonder why he riots. They are
the legislators and political experts who did
not grow in wisdom or understanding between
Korea and Vietnam. They are the bishops and
pastors and rabbis who could forbid marriages,
describe hell and the character of its occupants,
invade bedrooms and smother youth with per
manent sexual guilt, preach inanities and irrele
vance and be paid for their services, and dis
tort the simplicity of the scriptures with their
own historical bigotry.

They do not understand a Bishop Pike or a
Malcolm Boyd who try to save the institutional
church from history's ash can. They condemn
a Dick Gregory or a Stokely Carmichael who
have been choked with cheap words and trite
promises of gold at the end of a cotton field.
They scorn the hippies, the college protests, the
existential thought which is weary of stale ideas
and pompous compromises. They do not even
recognize the depth of the revolution that is
sweeping through the world.
A former generation would have listened to
its leaders when they asked for patience and
gentle forebearance. This generation has no
time. It is not impressed with a Supreme Court
decision about the Negro which a southern
sheriff or a northern mayor can disregard. It is
not moved by a Vatican Council which pontifi
cates about world problems and does nothing
significant when the council ends. A former
generation did not believe in the power of the
courageous few against the establishment. But
this generation is rash enough to believe that it
can bring about peace and justice and religious
liberty without another century of debate. It
will stand against popes, take on presidents, and
disappoint parents. It will organize marches
refuse to fight wars, reject impersonal educa
tion, scorn dead marriages, ignore formalized
religion, abandon traditional superstitions, and
search for meaning and honesty at any cost.
It will question any idea, prefer action to end
less committees, and withal, be not irrespon
sible.
I love the condition of the American spirit.
It frees me to be myself. It exhilarates me with


(Father James /.
Kavanaugh, Ph.D.,
sees the revolution of
today not as a sick
ness, tut as a "condi
tion of spiritual
health." He says the
American spirit is not
of Amer'ca alone but
of the world and that
"it has joined rebels
everywhere to seek
new forms of the un
dying values.")
