# Not sickness but spiritual health
## 
### james j. kavanaugh 
Shortsighted and frightened men equate rev
olution of any kind with death and destruction.
Political revolution means to them the destruc
tion of society. Religious revolution means the
death of God. Hence, they resist the change
they fear to interpret.
Hardly a half century ago, my Church was
still resisting political democracy because it be
lieved that man was too passionate and ignor
ant to govern himself. It longed for the days of
the kings and nobles and treasured its own aris
tocratic status. It opposed modern thought,
refused scholars the right to speculate, and en
forced its infallibility when science was ques
tioning everything that man had ever believed.
It was fighting a losing battle, and the modern
revolt within the churches is the last chapter in
the struggle of man to preserve his dignity.
For such a man, religious arrogance is dead,
be it Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish. The mod
ern Jew will not treat the gentile with the dis
dain of his parents. He will not be satisfied
with kosher laws nor religious festivals which
only highlight his own isolation. Nor will the
Protestant accept a faith without loving deeds,
or identify morality with anti-gambling laws
or smug, cultural preferences. And the Catho
lic, perhaps most of all, will resist the institu
tional Church which has crammed the com
plexities of marriage and divorce, sex and love,
heaven and hell into fierce and unyielding
laws.
The frightened and conservative critic of
such change seems to have a good case when
he sputters and condemns the rebellious spirit
of America. A prominent senator can shout of
a "sick society," an American bishop of tele
vision fame can call this "an age of assassins."
But these are tired men, who cannot hear the
rhythm of history. They are frightened men
who can only stand on the sidelines of life and
curse man's bid for freedom and peace.
Yet, when such men speak, a few will listen
and be afraid. They hear these men talk of the
violence of the racial struggle and the mob rule
in the slums of Newark and Detroit. They hear
their protests about the indifference and self
ishness of modem youth who refuse to fight in
Vietnam. They hear their criticism of sexual
freedom and a diluted morality which makes
each man his own god. They sneer of hippies,
leer at love-ins, and boast of an America which
once had fiber and a responsible sense of sin.
They speak of a dying country which never
lost a war, never feared an oppressor, which
welcomed the immigrant and gave him a job,

which built churches and fought iniquity,
which gave youth an unparalleled opportunity
for education and made of the slum dweller a
company president.
They love America and point to the struggles
of their own youth as evidence of its former
spirit. They decry the materialism which has
made today's youth fat and cynical. They praise
the formulas which they themselves devised,
formulas which promised to make of every man
a patriot, a moral person, a loyal and affection
ate son. They detest experiments, mock vague
and uncertain ideas, reject the pacifist and the
rebel, and they cite the gross national product
as evidence of God's blessing. They point to
past progress and ask for patience. They point
to current discussions at Vatican Councils or in
wordy congresses and ask us to be impressed.
They see themselves as the strong and enlight
ened with a kind of pharisaic vision and they
call fresh minds rash and intemperate if they
dare to disagree.
Such proud and simplistic men are out of
touch. They are the talkers and debaters who
have promised the Negro freedom for a hun
dred years and wonder why he riots. They are
the legislators and political experts who did
not grow in wisdom or understanding between
Korea and Vietnam. They are the bishops and
pastors and rabbis who could forbid marriages,
describe hell and the character of its occupants,
invade bedrooms and smother youth with per
manent sexual guilt, preach inanities and irrele
vance and be paid for their services, and dis
tort the simplicity of the scriptures with their
own historical bigotry.

They do not understand a Bishop Pike or a
Malcolm Boyd who try to save the institutional
church from history's ash can. They condemn
a Dick Gregory or a Stokely Carmichael who
have been choked with cheap words and trite
promises of gold at the end of a cotton field.
They scorn the hippies, the college protests, the
existential thought which is weary of stale ideas
and pompous compromises. They do not even
recognize the depth of the revolution that is
sweeping through the world.
A former generation would have listened to
its leaders when they asked for patience and
gentle forebearance. This generation has no
time. It is not impressed with a Supreme Court
decision about the Negro which a southern
sheriff or a northern mayor can disregard. It is
not moved by a Vatican Council which pontifi
cates about world problems and does nothing
significant when the council ends. A former
generation did not believe in the power of the
courageous few against the establishment. But
this generation is rash enough to believe that it
can bring about peace and justice and religious
liberty without another century of debate. It
will stand against popes, take on presidents, and
disappoint parents. It will organize marches
refuse to fight wars, reject impersonal educa
tion, scorn dead marriages, ignore formalized
religion, abandon traditional superstitions, and
search for meaning and honesty at any cost.
It will question any idea, prefer action to end
less committees, and withal, be not irrespon
sible.
I love the condition of the American spirit.
It frees me to be myself. It exhilarates me with

its style and concern and openness of mind. It

in life. It encourages me to enlarge the boun
daries of my mind, to expand the borders of my

It is young, rash, exciting, humble, outspoken,

asm. It is earthy, passionate, warm, curious,
alive. Nor can such a spirit die. It has only be
gun to live.
It will make of churches and temples more
than clubs to perpetuate bigotry and self right
eousness. Or it will continue to abandon them
and make them mausoleums. It will not toler
ate the narrowness which reduces God to the
man-made traditions of an archaic sect. It has
discovered its own power and in its modest
success it has sensed the fear and uncertitude
of the leaders who once sounded so enlightened
and secure. It will demand meaning from life,
and in such a demand will not fear pain, or fail
ure, or social scorn.
Such a spirit will enjoy the benefits of an af
fluent society without forgetting the poor. It
will drift away from the establishment to seek
the secret of life. It will search for new ways to
communicate and make friends. It will spot the
stuffiness of middle class boredom, avoid the
cultural symbols which offer no relief from
emptiness of spirit, and resist the pompous pla
titudes which make masquerade for religious
faith.
The American spirit is no longer of America
alone. It is of the world. It no longer must wait
for the French existenialists or German the
ologians to speak. It has ideas of its own. It is
not impressed by hollow authority but docilely
listens to the fellow searcher who does not
know the answers before life and involvement
began. It can be grateful to Kierkegaard or
Camus, but it has joined the rebels everywhere
to seek new forms for the undying values which
were lost in Europe's petty wars of religion and
nationalism, which have been obscured in
America's self worship and chauvinistic pride.
Such a spirit is clearly evident in the growing
transformation of modern man. He is more tol
erant even as the institutional churches re
main rigorous in their resistance to significant
change. He was sadly disappointed by Vatican
11, but now knows that he can become a free
and involved Christian even if pope and bish
ops continue to fight battles that are already
lost or won. He knows that religious reform
will not come from the institution but from
himself. He knows that more laws will not
bring about racial justice, that more money or
a larger house will not bring happiness and
peace. So he does not wait for another program

chance to love and be loved, to seek forms
which assist in the quest to be one's self. This
is not sickness, this is the condition of spiritual
health. Only the frightened tell such a man of
spirit that he has no values, that he makes light
of marriage, or exaggerates love. When he
hears the frightened speak, he knows they have
confused permanent values with the forms that
once sought to make them live. He knows he
can worship God without a church, find for
giveness without profession, know Christ with
out the sacraments. He will not baptize or cir
cumcise without knowing why, nor will he at
tend a religious service unless it teaches him

or outline to replace the structures which have
grown stale and silent. He will not wait for the
institutions to lead him by the hand; modern
man will lead them by the force of his own
spirit.
Is such a society "sick?" Is it "sick" not to ask
much even as one asks everything? To want a
the secrets of an involved love.
He is different from his father because he
does not believe that he is bad. Nor will he ac
cept the simple categories of sin provided by
men who were afraid to be involved in the
world. He has the power of a free man, the
strength of a man who answers to no one but
to the vital force within himself that binds him
to friends and to his God. He is not put off by
name calling, nor dismissed by the loud voices
of helpless and archaic men.
He can smile with me at the anguish of a
simple peasant woman in a southern Irish vil
lage who told me that 14 girls had left the vil
lage that very year to find their way in the big
city. He knows that she longs for a world that
is gone, a life that has given way to another and
more fulfilling life. It is more dangerous than
peat bogs and turf fires, more complicated than
gossip in the square and Mass in the village
church. But he knows that the past cannot be
regained, that it must seek the new ways that
are able to reach his heart with meaning if not
with eloquence. He is the spirit of America, the
spirit of the world, the spirit of the church.
Only the requiem and burial of the institution
remains. Then the future is his, and I am glad.

Is such a society "sick?" Is it "sick" not to ask
much even as one asks everything? To want a

He is different from his father because he
does not believe that he is bad. Nor will he ac
cept the simple categories of sin provided by
men who were afraid to be involved in the
world. He has the power of a free man, the
strength of a man who answers to no one but
to the vital force within himself that binds him
to friends and to his God. He is not put off by
name calling, nor dismissed by the loud voices
of helpless and archaic men.
He can smile with me at the anguish of a
simple peasant woman in a southern Irish vil
lage who told me that 14 girls had left the vil
lage that very year to find their way in the big
city. He knows that she longs for a world that
is gone, a life that has given way to another and
more fulfilling life. It is more dangerous than
peat bogs and turf fires, more complicated than
gossip in the square and Mass in the village
church. But he knows that the past cannot be
regained, that it must seek the new ways that
are able to reach his heart with meaning if not
with eloquence. He is the spirit of America, the
spirit of the world, the spirit of the church.
Only the requiem and burial of the institution
remains. Then the future is his, and I am glad.

Shortsighted and frightened men equate rev
olution of any kind with death and destruction.
Political revolution means to them the destruc
tion of society. Religious revolution means the
death of God. Hence, they resist the change
they fear to interpret.
Hardly a half century ago, my Church was
still resisting political democracy because it be
lieved that man was too passionate and ignor
ant to govern himself. It longed for the days of
the kings and nobles and treasured its own aris
tocratic status. It opposed modern thought,
refused scholars the right to speculate, and en
forced its infallibility when science was ques
tioning everything that man had ever believed.
It was fighting a losing battle, and the modern
revolt within the churches is the last chapter in
the struggle of man to preserve his dignity.
For such a man, religious arrogance is dead,
be it Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish. The mod
ern Jew will not treat the gentile with the dis
dain of his parents. He will not be satisfied
with kosher laws nor religious festivals which
only highlight his own isolation. Nor will the
Protestant accept a faith without loving deeds,
or identify morality with anti-gambling laws
or smug, cultural preferences. And the Catho
lic, perhaps most of all, will resist the institu
tional Church which has crammed the com
plexities of marriage and divorce, sex and love,
heaven and hell into fierce and unyielding
laws.
The frightened and conservative critic of
such change seems to have a good case when
he sputters and condemns the rebellious spirit
of America. A prominent senator can shout of
a "sick society," an American bishop of tele
vision fame can call this "an age of assassins."
But these are tired men, who cannot hear the
rhythm of history. They are frightened men
who can only stand on the sidelines of life and
curse man's bid for freedom and peace.
Yet, when such men speak, a few will listen
and be afraid. They hear these men talk of the
violence of the racial struggle and the mob rule
in the slums of Newark and Detroit. They hear
their protests about the indifference and self
ishness of modem youth who refuse to fight in
Vietnam. They hear their criticism of sexual
freedom and a diluted morality which makes
each man his own god. They sneer of hippies,
leer at love-ins, and boast of an America which
once had fiber and a responsible sense of sin.
They speak of a dying country which never
lost a war, never feared an oppressor, which
welcomed the immigrant and gave him a job,

which built churches and fought iniquity,
which gave youth an unparalleled opportunity
for education and made of the slum dweller a
company president.
They love America and point to the struggles
of their own youth as evidence of its former
spirit. They decry the materialism which has
made today's youth fat and cynical. They praise
the formulas which they themselves devised,
formulas which promised to make of every man
a patriot, a moral person, a loyal and affection
ate son. They detest experiments, mock vague
and uncertain ideas, reject the pacifist and the
rebel, and they cite the gross national product
as evidence of God's blessing. They point to
past progress and ask for patience. They point
to current discussions at Vatican Councils or in
wordy congresses and ask us to be impressed.
They see themselves as the strong and enlight
ened with a kind of pharisaic vision and they
call fresh minds rash and intemperate if they
dare to disagree.
Such proud and simplistic men are out of
touch. They are the talkers and debaters who
have promised the Negro freedom for a hun
dred years and wonder why he riots. They are
the legislators and political experts who did
not grow in wisdom or understanding between
Korea and Vietnam. They are the bishops and
pastors and rabbis who could forbid marriages,
describe hell and the character of its occupants,
invade bedrooms and smother youth with per
manent sexual guilt, preach inanities and irrele
vance and be paid for their services, and dis
tort the simplicity of the scriptures with their
own historical bigotry.

They do not understand a Bishop Pike or a
Malcolm Boyd who try to save the institutional
church from history's ash can. They condemn
a Dick Gregory or a Stokely Carmichael who
have been choked with cheap words and trite
promises of gold at the end of a cotton field.
They scorn the hippies, the college protests, the
existential thought which is weary of stale ideas
and pompous compromises. They do not even
recognize the depth of the revolution that is
sweeping through the world.
A former generation would have listened to
its leaders when they asked for patience and
gentle forebearance. This generation has no
time. It is not impressed with a Supreme Court
decision about the Negro which a southern
sheriff or a northern mayor can disregard. It is
not moved by a Vatican Council which pontifi
cates about world problems and does nothing
significant when the council ends. A former
generation did not believe in the power of the
courageous few against the establishment. But
this generation is rash enough to believe that it
can bring about peace and justice and religious
liberty without another century of debate. It
will stand against popes, take on presidents, and
disappoint parents. It will organize marches
refuse to fight wars, reject impersonal educa
tion, scorn dead marriages, ignore formalized
religion, abandon traditional superstitions, and
search for meaning and honesty at any cost.
It will question any idea, prefer action to end
less committees, and withal, be not irrespon
sible.
I love the condition of the American spirit.
It frees me to be myself. It exhilarates me with

asm. It is earthy, passionate, warm, curious,
alive. Nor can such a spirit die. It has only be
gun to live.
It will make of churches and temples more
than clubs to perpetuate bigotry and self right
eousness. Or it will continue to abandon them
and make them mausoleums. It will not toler
ate the narrowness which reduces God to the
man-made traditions of an archaic sect. It has
discovered its own power and in its modest
success it has sensed the fear and uncertitude
of the leaders who once sounded so enlightened
and secure. It will demand meaning from life,
and in such a demand will not fear pain, or fail
ure, or social scorn.
Such a spirit will enjoy the benefits of an af
fluent society without forgetting the poor. It
will drift away from the establishment to seek
the secret of life. It will search for new ways to
communicate and make friends. It will spot the
stuffiness of middle class boredom, avoid the
cultural symbols which offer no relief from
emptiness of spirit, and resist the pompous pla
titudes which make masquerade for religious
faith.
The American spirit is no longer of America
alone. It is of the world. It no longer must wait
for the French existenialists or German the
ologians to speak. It has ideas of its own. It is
not impressed by hollow authority but docilely
listens to the fellow searcher who does not
know the answers before life and involvement
began. It can be grateful to Kierkegaard or
Camus, but it has joined the rebels everywhere
to seek new forms for the undying values which
were lost in Europe's petty wars of religion and
nationalism, which have been obscured in
America's self worship and chauvinistic pride.
Such a spirit is clearly evident in the growing
transformation of modern man. He is more tol
erant even as the institutional churches re
main rigorous in their resistance to significant
change. He was sadly disappointed by Vatican
11, but now knows that he can become a free
and involved Christian even if pope and bish
ops continue to fight battles that are already
lost or won. He knows that religious reform
will not come from the institution but from
himself. He knows that more laws will not
bring about racial justice, that more money or
a larger house will not bring happiness and
peace. So he does not wait for another program

chance to love and be loved, to seek forms
which assist in the quest to be one's self. This
is not sickness, this is the condition of spiritual
health. Only the frightened tell such a man of
spirit that he has no values, that he makes light
of marriage, or exaggerates love. When he
hears the frightened speak, he knows they have
confused permanent values with the forms that
once sought to make them live. He knows he
can worship God without a church, find for
giveness without profession, know Christ with
out the sacraments. He will not baptize or cir
cumcise without knowing why, nor will he at
tend a religious service unless it teaches him

or outline to replace the structures which have
grown stale and silent. He will not wait for the
institutions to lead him by the hand; modern
man will lead them by the force of his own

erant even as the institutional churches re
main rigorous in their resistance to significant
change. He was sadly disappointed by Vatican
11, but now knows that he can become a free
and involved Christian even if pope and bish
ops continue to fight battles that are already
lost or won. He knows that religious reform
will not come from the institution but from
himself. He knows that more laws will not
bring about racial justice, that more money or
a larger house will not bring happiness and
peace. So he does not wait for another program

chance to love and be loved, to seek forms
which assist in the quest to be one's self. This
is not sickness, this is the condition of spiritual
health. Only the frightened tell such a man of
spirit that he has no values, that he makes light
of marriage, or exaggerates love. When he
hears the frightened speak, he knows they have
confused permanent values with the forms that
once sought to make them live. He knows he
can worship God without a church, find for
giveness without profession, know Christ with
out the sacraments. He will not baptize or cir
cumcise without knowing why, nor will he at
tend a religious service unless it teaches him

or outline to replace the structures which have
grown stale and silent. He will not wait for the
institutions to lead him by the hand; modern
man will lead them by the force of his own
spirit.
Is such a society "sick?" Is it "sick" not to ask
much even as one asks everything? To want a
the secrets of an involved love.
He is different from his father because he
does not believe that he is bad. Nor will he ac
cept the simple categories of sin provided by
men who were afraid to be involved in the
world. He has the power of a free man, the
strength of a man who answers to no one but
to the vital force within himself that binds him
to friends and to his God. He is not put off by
name calling, nor dismissed by the loud voices
of helpless and archaic men.
He can smile with me at the anguish of a
simple peasant woman in a southern Irish vil
lage who told me that 14 girls had left the vil
lage that very year to find their way in the big
city. He knows that she longs for a world that
is gone, a life that has given way to another and
more fulfilling life. It is more dangerous than
peat bogs and turf fires, more complicated than
gossip in the square and Mass in the village
church. But he knows that the past cannot be
regained, that it must seek the new ways that
are able to reach his heart with meaning if not
with eloquence. He is the spirit of America, the
spirit of the world, the spirit of the church.
Only the requiem and burial of the institution
remains. Then the future is his, and I am glad.

Shortsighted and frightened men equate rev
olution of any kind with death and destruction.
Political revolution means to them the destruc
tion of society. Religious revolution means the
death of God. Hence, they resist the change
they fear to interpret.
Hardly a half century ago, my Church was
still resisting political democracy because it be
lieved that man was too passionate and ignor
ant to govern himself. It longed for the days of
the kings and nobles and treasured its own aris
tocratic status. It opposed modern thought,
refused scholars the right to speculate, and en
forced its infallibility when science was ques
tioning everything that man had ever believed.
It was fighting a losing battle, and the modern
revolt within the churches is the last chapter in
the struggle of man to preserve his dignity.
For such a man, religious arrogance is dead,
be it Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish. The mod
ern Jew will not treat the gentile with the dis
dain of his parents. He will not be satisfied
with kosher laws nor religious festivals which
only highlight his own isolation. Nor will the
Protestant accept a faith without loving deeds,
or identify morality with anti-gambling laws
or smug, cultural preferences. And the Catho
lic, perhaps most of all, will resist the institu
tional Church which has crammed the com
plexities of marriage and divorce, sex and love,
heaven and hell into fierce and unyielding
laws.
The frightened and conservative critic of
such change seems to have a good case when
he sputters and condemns the rebellious spirit
of America. A prominent senator can shout of
a "sick society," an American bishop of tele
vision fame can call this "an age of assassins."
But these are tired men, who cannot hear the
rhythm of history. They are frightened men
who can only stand on the sidelines of life and
curse man's bid for freedom and peace.
Yet, when such men speak, a few will listen
and be afraid. They hear these men talk of the
violence of the racial struggle and the mob rule
in the slums of Newark and Detroit. They hear
their protests about the indifference and self
ishness of modem youth who refuse to fight in
Vietnam. They hear their criticism of sexual
freedom and a diluted morality which makes
each man his own god. They sneer of hippies,
leer at love-ins, and boast of an America which
once had fiber and a responsible sense of sin.
They speak of a dying country which never
lost a war, never feared an oppressor, which
welcomed the immigrant and gave him a job,

which built churches and fought iniquity,
which gave youth an unparalleled opportunity
for education and made of the slum dweller a
company president.
They love America and point to the struggles
of their own youth as evidence of its former
spirit. They decry the materialism which has
made today's youth fat and cynical. They praise
the formulas which they themselves devised,
formulas which promised to make of every man
a patriot, a moral person, a loyal and affection
ate son. They detest experiments, mock vague
and uncertain ideas, reject the pacifist and the
rebel, and they cite the gross national product
as evidence of God's blessing. They point to
past progress and ask for patience. They point
to current discussions at Vatican Councils or in
wordy congresses and ask us to be impressed.
They see themselves as the strong and enlight
ened with a kind of pharisaic vision and they
call fresh minds rash and intemperate if they
dare to disagree.
Such proud and simplistic men are out of
touch. They are the talkers and debaters who
have promised the Negro freedom for a hun
dred years and wonder why he riots. They are
the legislators and political experts who did
not grow in wisdom or understanding between
Korea and Vietnam. They are the bishops and
pastors and rabbis who could forbid marriages,
describe hell and the character of its occupants,
invade bedrooms and smother youth with per
manent sexual guilt, preach inanities and irrele
vance and be paid for their services, and dis
tort the simplicity of the scriptures with their
own historical bigotry.

They do not understand a Bishop Pike or a
Malcolm Boyd who try to save the institutional
church from history's ash can. They condemn
a Dick Gregory or a Stokely Carmichael who
have been choked with cheap words and trite
promises of gold at the end of a cotton field.
They scorn the hippies, the college protests, the
existential thought which is weary of stale ideas
and pompous compromises. They do not even
recognize the depth of the revolution that is
sweeping through the world.
A former generation would have listened to
its leaders when they asked for patience and
gentle forebearance. This generation has no
time. It is not impressed with a Supreme Court
decision about the Negro which a southern
sheriff or a northern mayor can disregard. It is
not moved by a Vatican Council which pontifi
cates about world problems and does nothing
significant when the council ends. A former
generation did not believe in the power of the
courageous few against the establishment. But
this generation is rash enough to believe that it
can bring about peace and justice and religious
liberty without another century of debate. It
will stand against popes, take on presidents, and
disappoint parents. It will organize marches
refuse to fight wars, reject impersonal educa
tion, scorn dead marriages, ignore formalized
religion, abandon traditional superstitions, and
search for meaning and honesty at any cost.
It will question any idea, prefer action to end
less committees, and withal, be not irrespon
sible.
I love the condition of the American spirit.
It frees me to be myself. It exhilarates me with

asm. It is earthy, passionate, warm, curious,
alive. Nor can such a spirit die. It has only be
gun to live.
It will make of churches and temples more
than clubs to perpetuate bigotry and self right
eousness. Or it will continue to abandon them
and make them mausoleums. It will not toler
ate the narrowness which reduces God to the
man-made traditions of an archaic sect. It has
discovered its own power and in its modest
success it has sensed the fear and uncertitude
of the leaders who once sounded so enlightened
and secure. It will demand meaning from life,
and in such a demand will not fear pain, or fail
ure, or social scorn.
Such a spirit will enjoy the benefits of an af
fluent society without forgetting the poor. It
will drift away from the establishment to seek
the secret of life. It will search for new ways to
communicate and make friends. It will spot the
stuffiness of middle class boredom, avoid the
cultural symbols which offer no relief from
emptiness of spirit, and resist the pompous pla
titudes which make masquerade for religious
faith.
The American spirit is no longer of America
alone. It is of the world. It no longer must wait
for the French existenialists or German the
ologians to speak. It has ideas of its own. It is
not impressed by hollow authority but docilely
listens to the fellow searcher who does not
know the answers before life and involvement
began. It can be grateful to Kierkegaard or
Camus, but it has joined the rebels everywhere
to seek new forms for the undying values which
were lost in Europe's petty wars of religion and
nationalism, which have been obscured in
America's self worship and chauvinistic pride.

man-made traditions of an archaic sect. It has
discovered its own power and in its modest
success it has sensed the fear and uncertitude
of the leaders who once sounded so enlightened
and secure. It will demand meaning from life,
and in such a demand will not fear pain, or fail
ure, or social scorn.
Such a spirit will enjoy the benefits of an af
fluent society without forgetting the poor. It
will drift away from the establishment to seek
the secret of life. It will search for new ways to
communicate and make friends. It will spot the
stuffiness of middle class boredom, avoid the
cultural symbols which offer no relief from
emptiness of spirit, and resist the pompous pla
titudes which make masquerade for religious
faith.
The American spirit is no longer of America
alone. It is of the world. It no longer must wait
for the French existenialists or German the
ologians to speak. It has ideas of its own. It is
not impressed by hollow authority but docilely
listens to the fellow searcher who does not
know the answers before life and involvement
began. It can be grateful to Kierkegaard or
Camus, but it has joined the rebels everywhere
to seek new forms for the undying values which
were lost in Europe's petty wars of religion and
nationalism, which have been obscured in
America's self worship and chauvinistic pride.
Such a spirit is clearly evident in the growing
transformation of modern man. He is more tol
erant even as the institutional churches re
main rigorous in their resistance to significant
change. He was sadly disappointed by Vatican
11, but now knows that he can become a free
and involved Christian even if pope and bish
ops continue to fight battles that are already
lost or won. He knows that religious reform
will not come from the institution but from
himself. He knows that more laws will not
bring about racial justice, that more money or
a larger house will not bring happiness and
peace. So he does not wait for another program

chance to love and be loved, to seek forms
which assist in the quest to be one's self. This
is not sickness, this is the condition of spiritual
health. Only the frightened tell such a man of
spirit that he has no values, that he makes light
of marriage, or exaggerates love. When he
hears the frightened speak, he knows they have
confused permanent values with the forms that
once sought to make them live. He knows he
can worship God without a church, find for
giveness without profession, know Christ with
out the sacraments. He will not baptize or cir
cumcise without knowing why, nor will he at
tend a religious service unless it teaches him

or outline to replace the structures which have
grown stale and silent. He will not wait for the
institutions to lead him by the hand; modern
man will lead them by the force of his own
spirit.
Is such a society "sick?" Is it "sick" not to ask
much even as one asks everything? To want a
the secrets of an involved love.
He is different from his father because he
does not believe that he is bad. Nor will he ac
cept the simple categories of sin provided by
men who were afraid to be involved in the
world. He has the power of a free man, the
strength of a man who answers to no one but
to the vital force within himself that binds him
to friends and to his God. He is not put off by
name calling, nor dismissed by the loud voices
of helpless and archaic men.
He can smile with me at the anguish of a
simple peasant woman in a southern Irish vil
lage who told me that 14 girls had left the vil
lage that very year to find their way in the big
city. He knows that she longs for a world that
is gone, a life that has given way to another and
more fulfilling life. It is more dangerous than
peat bogs and turf fires, more complicated than
gossip in the square and Mass in the village
church. But he knows that the past cannot be
regained, that it must seek the new ways that
are able to reach his heart with meaning if not
with eloquence. He is the spirit of America, the
spirit of the world, the spirit of the church.
Only the requiem and burial of the institution
remains. Then the future is his, and I am glad.

Shortsighted and frightened men equate rev
olution of any kind with death and destruction.
Political revolution means to them the destruc
tion of society. Religious revolution means the
death of God. Hence, they resist the change
they fear to interpret.
Hardly a half century ago, my Church was
still resisting political democracy because it be
lieved that man was too passionate and ignor
ant to govern himself. It longed for the days of
the kings and nobles and treasured its own aris
tocratic status. It opposed modern thought,
refused scholars the right to speculate, and en
forced its infallibility when science was ques
tioning everything that man had ever believed.
It was fighting a losing battle, and the modern
revolt within the churches is the last chapter in
the struggle of man to preserve his dignity.
For such a man, religious arrogance is dead,
be it Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish. The mod
ern Jew will not treat the gentile with the dis
dain of his parents. He will not be satisfied
with kosher laws nor religious festivals which
only highlight his own isolation. Nor will the
Protestant accept a faith without loving deeds,
or identify morality with anti-gambling laws
or smug, cultural preferences. And the Catho
lic, perhaps most of all, will resist the institu
tional Church which has crammed the com
plexities of marriage and divorce, sex and love,
heaven and hell into fierce and unyielding
laws.
The frightened and conservative critic of
such change seems to have a good case when
he sputters and condemns the rebellious spirit
of America. A prominent senator can shout of
a "sick society," an American bishop of tele
vision fame can call this "an age of assassins."
But these are tired men, who cannot hear the
rhythm of history. They are frightened men
who can only stand on the sidelines of life and
curse man's bid for freedom and peace.
Yet, when such men speak, a few will listen
and be afraid. They hear these men talk of the
violence of the racial struggle and the mob rule
in the slums of Newark and Detroit. They hear
their protests about the indifference and self
ishness of modem youth who refuse to fight in
Vietnam. They hear their criticism of sexual
freedom and a diluted morality which makes
each man his own god. They sneer of hippies,
leer at love-ins, and boast of an America which
once had fiber and a responsible sense of sin.
They speak of a dying country which never
lost a war, never feared an oppressor, which
welcomed the immigrant and gave him a job,

which built churches and fought iniquity,
which gave youth an unparalleled opportunity
for education and made of the slum dweller a
company president.
They love America and point to the struggles
of their own youth as evidence of its former
spirit. They decry the materialism which has
made today's youth fat and cynical. They praise
the formulas which they themselves devised,
formulas which promised to make of every man
a patriot, a moral person, a loyal and affection
ate son. They detest experiments, mock vague
and uncertain ideas, reject the pacifist and the
rebel, and they cite the gross national product
as evidence of God's blessing. They point to
past progress and ask for patience. They point
to current discussions at Vatican Councils or in
wordy congresses and ask us to be impressed.
They see themselves as the strong and enlight
ened with a kind of pharisaic vision and they
call fresh minds rash and intemperate if they
dare to disagree.
Such proud and simplistic men are out of
touch. They are the talkers and debaters who
have promised the Negro freedom for a hun
dred years and wonder why he riots. They are
the legislators and political experts who did
not grow in wisdom or understanding between
Korea and Vietnam. They are the bishops and
pastors and rabbis who could forbid marriages,
describe hell and the character of its occupants,
invade bedrooms and smother youth with per
manent sexual guilt, preach inanities and irrele
vance and be paid for their services, and dis
tort the simplicity of the scriptures with their
own historical bigotry.

They do not understand a Bishop Pike or a
Malcolm Boyd who try to save the institutional
church from history's ash can. They condemn
a Dick Gregory or a Stokely Carmichael who
have been choked with cheap words and trite
promises of gold at the end of a cotton field.
They scorn the hippies, the college protests, the
existential thought which is weary of stale ideas
and pompous compromises. They do not even
recognize the depth of the revolution that is
sweeping through the world.
A former generation would have listened to
its leaders when they asked for patience and
gentle forebearance. This generation has no
time. It is not impressed with a Supreme Court
decision about the Negro which a southern
sheriff or a northern mayor can disregard. It is
not moved by a Vatican Council which pontifi
cates about world problems and does nothing
significant when the council ends. A former
generation did not believe in the power of the
courageous few against the establishment. But
this generation is rash enough to believe that it
can bring about peace and justice and religious
liberty without another century of debate. It
will stand against popes, take on presidents, and
disappoint parents. It will organize marches
refuse to fight wars, reject impersonal educa
tion, scorn dead marriages, ignore formalized
religion, abandon traditional superstitions, and
search for meaning and honesty at any cost.
It will question any idea, prefer action to end
less committees, and withal, be not irrespon
sible.
I love the condition of the American spirit.

asm. It is earthy, passionate, warm, curious,
alive. Nor can such a spirit die. It has only be
gun to live.
It will make of churches and temples more
than clubs to perpetuate bigotry and self right
eousness. Or it will continue to abandon them
and make them mausoleums. It will not toler
ate the narrowness which reduces God to the
man-made traditions of an archaic sect. It has
discovered its own power and in its modest
success it has sensed the fear and uncertitude
of the leaders who once sounded so enlightened
and secure. It will demand meaning from life,
and in such a demand will not fear pain, or fail
ure, or social scorn.
Such a spirit will enjoy the benefits of an af
fluent society without forgetting the poor. It
will drift away from the establishment to seek
the secret of life. It will search for new ways to
communicate and make friends. It will spot the
stuffiness of middle class boredom, avoid the
cultural symbols which offer no relief from
emptiness of spirit, and resist the pompous pla
titudes which make masquerade for religious
faith.
The American spirit is no longer of America
alone. It is of the world. It no longer must wait
for the French existenialists or German the
ologians to speak. It has ideas of its own. It is
not impressed by hollow authority but docilely
listens to the fellow searcher who does not
know the answers before life and involvement
began. It can be grateful to Kierkegaard or
Camus, but it has joined the rebels everywhere
to seek new forms for the undying values which
were lost in Europe's petty wars of religion and
nationalism, which have been obscured in
America's self worship and chauvinistic pride.
Such a spirit is clearly evident in the growing
transformation of modern man. He is more tol
erant even as the institutional churches re
main rigorous in their resistance to significant
change. He was sadly disappointed by Vatican
11, but now knows that he can become a free
and involved Christian even if pope and bish
ops continue to fight battles that are already
lost or won. He knows that religious reform
will not come from the institution but from
himself. He knows that more laws will not
bring about racial justice, that more money or
a larger house will not bring happiness and
peace. So he does not wait for another program

chance to love and be loved, to seek forms
which assist in the quest to be one's self. This
is not sickness, this is the condition of spiritual
health. Only the frightened tell such a man of
spirit that he has no values, that he makes light
of marriage, or exaggerates love. When he
hears the frightened speak, he knows they have
confused permanent values with the forms that
once sought to make them live. He knows he
can worship God without a church, find for
giveness without profession, know Christ with
out the sacraments. He will not baptize or cir
cumcise without knowing why, nor will he at
tend a religious service unless it teaches him

or outline to replace the structures which have
grown stale and silent. He will not wait for the
institutions to lead him by the hand; modern
man will lead them by the force of his own
spirit.
Is such a society "sick?" Is it "sick" not to ask
much even as one asks everything? To want a

He is different from his father because he
does not believe that he is bad. Nor will he ac
cept the simple categories of sin provided by
men who were afraid to be involved in the
world. He has the power of a free man, the
strength of a man who answers to no one but
to the vital force within himself that binds him
to friends and to his God. He is not put off by
name calling, nor dismissed by the loud voices
of helpless and archaic men.
He can smile with me at the anguish of a
simple peasant woman in a southern Irish vil
lage who told me that 14 girls had left the vil
lage that very year to find their way in the big
city. He knows that she longs for a world that
is gone, a life that has given way to another and
more fulfilling life. It is more dangerous than
peat bogs and turf fires, more complicated than
gossip in the square and Mass in the village
church. But he knows that the past cannot be
regained, that it must seek the new ways that
are able to reach his heart with meaning if not
with eloquence. He is the spirit of America, the
spirit of the world, the spirit of the church.
Only the requiem and burial of the institution
remains. Then the future is his, and I am glad.

Shortsighted and frightened men equate rev
olution of any kind with death and destruction.
Political revolution means to them the destruc
tion of society. Religious revolution means the
death of God. Hence, they resist the change
they fear to interpret.
Hardly a half century ago, my Church was
still resisting political democracy because it be
lieved that man was too passionate and ignor
ant to govern himself. It longed for the days of
the kings and nobles and treasured its own aris
tocratic status. It opposed modern thought,
refused scholars the right to speculate, and en
forced its infallibility when science was ques
tioning everything that man had ever believed.
It was fighting a losing battle, and the modern
revolt within the churches is the last chapter in
the struggle of man to preserve his dignity.
For such a man, religious arrogance is dead,
be it Catholic, Protestant, or Jewish. The mod
ern Jew will not treat the gentile with the dis
dain of his parents. He will not be satisfied
with kosher laws nor religious festivals which
only highlight his own isolation. Nor will the
Protestant accept a faith without loving deeds,
or identify morality with anti-gambling laws
or smug, cultural preferences. And the Catho
lic, perhaps most of all, will resist the institu
tional Church which has crammed the com
plexities of marriage and divorce, sex and love,
heaven and hell into fierce and unyielding
laws.
The frightened and conservative critic of
such change seems to have a good case when
he sputters and condemns the rebellious spirit
of America. A prominent senator can shout of
a "sick society," an American bishop of tele
vision fame can call this "an age of assassins."
But these are tired men, who cannot hear the
rhythm of history. They are frightened men
who can only stand on the sidelines of life and
curse man's bid for freedom and peace.
Yet, when such men speak, a few will listen
and be afraid. They hear these men talk of the
violence of the racial struggle and the mob rule
in the slums of Newark and Detroit. They hear
their protests about the indifference and self
ishness of modem youth who refuse to fight in
Vietnam. They hear their criticism of sexual
freedom and a diluted morality which makes
each man his own god. They sneer of hippies,
leer at love-ins, and boast of an America which
once had fiber and a responsible sense of sin.
They speak of a dying country which never
lost a war, never feared an oppressor, which
welcomed the immigrant and gave him a job,

which built churches and fought iniquity,
which gave youth an unparalleled opportunity
for education and made of the slum dweller a
company president.
They love America and point to the struggles
of their own youth as evidence of its former
spirit. They decry the materialism which has
made today's youth fat and cynical. They praise
the formulas which they themselves devised,
formulas which promised to make of every man
a patriot, a moral person, a loyal and affection
ate son. They detest experiments, mock vague
and uncertain ideas, reject the pacifist and the
rebel, and they cite the gross national product
as evidence of God's blessing. They point to
past progress and ask for patience. They point
to current discussions at Vatican Councils or in
wordy congresses and ask us to be impressed.
They see themselves as the strong and enlight
ened with a kind of pharisaic vision and they
call fresh minds rash and intemperate if they
dare to disagree.
Such proud and simplistic men are out of
touch. They are the talkers and debaters who
have promised the Negro freedom for a hun
dred years and wonder why he riots. They are
the legislators and political experts who did
not grow in wisdom or understanding between
Korea and Vietnam. They are the bishops and
pastors and rabbis who could forbid marriages,
describe hell and the character of its occupants,
invade bedrooms and smother youth with per
manent sexual guilt, preach inanities and irrele
vance and be paid for their services, and dis
tort the simplicity of the scriptures with their
own historical bigotry.

They do not understand a Bishop Pike or a
Malcolm Boyd who try to save the institutional
church from history's ash can. They condemn
a Dick Gregory or a Stokely Carmichael who
have been choked with cheap words and trite
promises of gold at the end of a cotton field.
They scorn the hippies, the college protests, the
existential thought which is weary of stale ideas
and pompous compromises. They do not even
recognize the depth of the revolution that is
sweeping through the world.
A former generation would have listened to
its leaders when they asked for patience and
gentle forebearance. This generation has no
time. It is not impressed with a Supreme Court
decision about the Negro which a southern
sheriff or a northern mayor can disregard. It is
not moved by a Vatican Council which pontifi
cates about world problems and does nothing
significant when the council ends. A former
generation did not believe in the power of the
courageous few against the establishment. But
this generation is rash enough to believe that it
can bring about peace and justice and religious
liberty without another century of debate. It
will stand against popes, take on presidents, and
disappoint parents. It will organize marches
refuse to fight wars, reject impersonal educa
tion, scorn dead marriages, ignore formalized
religion, abandon traditional superstitions, and
search for meaning and honesty at any cost.
It will question any idea, prefer action to end
less committees, and withal, be not irrespon
sible.
I love the condition of the American spirit.
It frees me to be myself. It exhilarates me with

recognize the depth of the revolution that is
sweeping through the world.
A former generation would have listened to
its leaders when they asked for patience and
gentle forebearance. This generation has no
time. It is not impressed with a Supreme Court
decision about the Negro which a southern
sheriff or a northern mayor can disregard. It is
not moved by a Vatican Council which pontifi
cates about world problems and does nothing
significant when the council ends. A former
generation did not believe in the power of the
courageous few against the establishment. But
this generation is rash enough to believe that it
can bring about peace and justice and religious
liberty without another century of debate. It
will stand against popes, take on presidents, and
disappoint parents. It will organize marches
refuse to fight wars, reject impersonal educa
tion, scorn dead marriages, ignore formalized
religion, abandon traditional superstitions, and
search for meaning and honesty at any cost.
It will question any idea, prefer action to end
less committees, and withal, be not irrespon
sible.

It frees me to be myself. It exhilarates me with

its style and concern and openness of mind. It
prods me to stay alive, to learn, to get involved
in life. It encourages me to enlarge the boun
daries of my mind, to expand the borders of my
love. It sparks my faith and kindles my hope.
It is young, rash, exciting, humble, outspoken,
and tolerant of anything but the stuffy arro
gance of the frightened past. It demands that
life mean something more than material com
fort and an annual raise in pay. It wants more
than social security and a vacation in Bermuda.
It will not tolerate the torpor of a dull and well
dressed crowd. It despises empty conversation,
superficial friendships, and artificial enthusi-

asm. It is earthy, passionate, warm, curious,
alive. Nor can such a spirit die. It has only be
gun to live.
It will make of churches and temples more
than clubs to perpetuate bigotry and self right
eousness. Or it will continue to abandon them
and make them mausoleums. It will not toler
ate the narrowness which reduces God to the
man-made traditions of an archaic sect. It has
discovered its own power and in its modest
success it has sensed the fear and uncertitude
of the leaders who once sounded so enlightened
and secure. It will demand meaning from life,
and in such a demand will not fear pain, or fail
ure, or social scorn.
Such a spirit will enjoy the benefits of an af
fluent society without forgetting the poor. It
will drift away from the establishment to seek
the secret of life. It will search for new ways to
communicate and make friends. It will spot the
stuffiness of middle class boredom, avoid the
cultural symbols which offer no relief from
emptiness of spirit, and resist the pompous pla
titudes which make masquerade for religious
faith.
The American spirit is no longer of America
alone. It is of the world. It no longer must wait
for the French existenialists or German the
ologians to speak. It has ideas of its own. It is
not impressed by hollow authority but docilely
listens to the fellow searcher who does not
know the answers before life and involvement
began. It can be grateful to Kierkegaard or
Camus, but it has joined the rebels everywhere
to seek new forms for the undying values which
were lost in Europe's petty wars of religion and
nationalism, which have been obscured in
America's self worship and chauvinistic pride.
Such a spirit is clearly evident in the growing
transformation of modern man. He is more tol
erant even as the institutional churches re
main rigorous in their resistance to significant
change. He was sadly disappointed by Vatican
11, but now knows that he can become a free
and involved Christian even if pope and bish
ops continue to fight battles that are already
lost or won. He knows that religious reform
will not come from the institution but from
himself. He knows that more laws will not
bring about racial justice, that more money or
a larger house will not bring happiness and
peace. So he does not wait for another program

chance to love and be loved, to seek forms
which assist in the quest to be one's self. This
is not sickness, this is the condition of spiritual
health. Only the frightened tell such a man of
spirit that he has no values, that he makes light
of marriage, or exaggerates love. When he
hears the frightened speak, he knows they have
confused permanent values with the forms that
once sought to make them live. He knows he
can worship God without a church, find for
giveness without profession, know Christ with
out the sacraments. He will not baptize or cir
cumcise without knowing why, nor will he at
tend a religious service unless it teaches him

or outline to replace the structures which have
grown stale and silent. He will not wait for the
institutions to lead him by the hand; modern
man will lead them by the force of his own
spirit.
Is such a society "sick?" Is it "sick" not to ask
much even as one asks everything? To want a
the secrets of an involved love.
He is different from his father because he
does not believe that he is bad. Nor will he ac
cept the simple categories of sin provided by
men who were afraid to be involved in the
world. He has the power of a free man, the
strength of a man who answers to no one but
to the vital force within himself that binds him
to friends and to his God. He is not put off by
name calling, nor dismissed by the loud voices
of helpless and archaic men.
He can smile with me at the anguish of a
simple peasant woman in a southern Irish vil
lage who told me that 14 girls had left the vil
lage that very year to find their way in the big
city. He knows that she longs for a world that
is gone, a life that has given way to another and
more fulfilling life. It is more dangerous than
peat bogs and turf fires, more complicated than
gossip in the square and Mass in the village
church. But he knows that the past cannot be
regained, that it must seek the new ways that
are able to reach his heart with meaning if not
with eloquence. He is the spirit of America, the
spirit of the world, the spirit of the church.
Only the requiem and burial of the institution
remains. Then the future is his, and I am glad.
