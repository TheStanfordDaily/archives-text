Within the shadows of Stanford's gates on

this theater is a basic tenet in founder Philip

time teacher of English at Menlo College, is
fond of his audiences: he honors and respects

evening—even to allowing them on the small
stage as actors if they choose.
Open only on Friday and Saturday nights,
The Illegitimate is an informal, soft-sell theater

scatological, revolutionary, and conventional
underground material, he will be disappointed.
The audience feels sure that Schultz and com
pany think all the right thoughts about Viet-
