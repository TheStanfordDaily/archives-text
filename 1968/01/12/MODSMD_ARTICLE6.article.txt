# Happy people improvise in Illegitimate Theater
## 
### 
Within the shadows of Stanford's gates on
upper University Avenue is the Illegitimate
Theater, operating upstairs over the Tangent
what-ever-you-call-it of pool, pizza, and beer.
This group of five improvisational actors are in
the third year of their work in Palo Alto; and,
if what happened last Saturday is any indica
tion, things are going very well for them. The
comfortable and attractive cabaret theatre was
filled with people obviously happy to be there
watching the actors do their improvisational
stuff. And it is important to make clear that
eighty percent of what they do is truly impro
vised and that by far the majority of ideas for
the improvs are suggested by the audience.
The central importance of the audience in
this theater is a basic tenet in founder Philip

Schultz's artistic faith. Schultz, who is a full
time teacher of English at Menlo College, is
fond of his audiences: he honors and respects
them in a direct and unique way. Where thea
ters today commonly treat audiences either as
cattle or as butts for their humor and outrage,
Schultz and his company are gentle, friendly,
eager to make their audiences a part of the
evening—even to allowing them on the small
stage as actors if they choose.
Open only on Friday and Saturday nights,
The Illegitimate is an informal, soft-sell theater
where, if one is looking for the cauftic, bitter,
scatological, revolutionary, and conventional
underground material, he will be disappointed.
The audience feels sure that Schultz and com
pany think all the right thoughts about Viet-


De Vera Marcus and Ray Barrett
Improvisations at the Illegitimate Theater are shown above
nam, LBJ, Stanford, Race, Sex, and the Draft,
hut they refuse to dwell on or be limited to
these subjects.
Schultz is, in fact, trying to prove that a cab
aret theater can exist without assaulting the
audience, without employing shock and excess.
Schultz admires San Francisco's Committee
Theatre, but has no wish at all to be like them.
He is going his own way, now beginning Tues
day night instructional classes in improvisa
tional acting and building ever increasing au
diences. If their success on national television
with "The Merv Griffin Show" is a useful index,
the future looks bright. They have been in New
York three times to appear on the Griffin show
and are to go again shortly.
As might be expected, the three or four acts
that had been rehearsed beforehand were the
most entertaining, and one is tempted to advise
Schultz to use more of this kind of prepared
thing. His rejoinder is that you can't have an
improvisational theater and not improvise. He's
willing to be vulnerable, willing to have an idea
flop if it must —and some do. When an act has
gone as far as it can or should, another member
of the company simply "kills" the lights on them
and that's that.
Schultz's right hand man and an equally
powerful actor is Ray Barrett, another teach
er —they're all teachers as a matter of fact.
De Vera Marcus is appealing and effective as
leading actress. Debora Linn Smith was ill
last Saturday and not with the company. Shir
ley Coates, who will be appearing more and
more with them, was a valuable addition.
They are at their best when working on
general character types—and at their weakest
when attempting to impersonate actual per
sons, living and dead. It might be claimed
that their improvs are too talky—too much sit
down and talk it over, interview sorts of
things. The particular physical arrangement
of the theatre invites a highly verbal presen
tation and discourages broad, physical action

that this reviewer, for one, wanted more of.
Schultz, in particular, with his incredibly plas
tic face seemed capable of a broader, more
physical communication had there been room
and view for it
The last act —it always closes their energetic
and generous evenings —is an attempt on
Schultz's part to put out the stage lights by
the will-power of diseases pride and body
whammy. His failure at the last light recalls
Beckett's exhausted world. But Ray Barrett's
success by gently, lovingly blowing out the
light seems to say something about the Ille
gitimate Theater itself. Schultz and company
are trying, in an illegitimate little theater, to
remind us of a forgotten way, a lost way, of
gentleness and love.

Schultz is, in fact, trying to prove that a cab
aret theater can exist without assaulting the
audience, without employing shock and excess.
Schultz admires San Francisco's Committee
Theatre, but has no wish at all to be like them.
He is going his own way, now beginning Tues
day night instructional classes in improvisa
tional acting and building ever increasing au
diences. If their success on national television
with "The Merv Griffin Show" is a useful index,
the future looks bright. They have been in New

As might be expected, the three or four acts
that had been rehearsed beforehand were the

Schultz to use more of this kind of prepared

improvisational theater and not improvise. He's
willing to be vulnerable, willing to have an idea
flop if it must —and some do. When an act has
gone as far as it can or should, another member
of the company simply "kills" the lights on them
and that's that.
Schultz's right hand man and an equally
powerful actor is Ray Barrett, another teach
er —they're all teachers as a matter of fact.
De Vera Marcus is appealing and effective as
leading actress. Debora Linn Smith was ill
last Saturday and not with the company. Shir
ley Coates, who will be appearing more and
more with them, was a valuable addition.
They are at their best when working on
general character types—and at their weakest
when attempting to impersonate actual per
sons, living and dead. It might be claimed
that their improvs are too talky—too much sit
down and talk it over, interview sorts of
things. The particular physical arrangement
of the theatre invites a highly verbal presen
tation and discourages broad, physical action

that this reviewer, for one, wanted more of.
Schultz, in particular, with his incredibly plas
tic face seemed capable of a broader, more
physical communication had there been room
and view for it
The last act —it always closes their energetic
and generous evenings —is an attempt on
Schultz's part to put out the stage lights by
the will-power of diseases pride and body
whammy. His failure at the last light recalls
Beckett's exhausted world. But Ray Barrett's
success by gently, lovingly blowing out the
light seems to say something about the Ille

are trying, in an illegitimate little theater, to
remind us of a forgotten way, a lost way, of
gentleness and love.

Philip Schultz and Barrett

Within the shadows of Stanford's gates on
upper University Avenue is the Illegitimate
Theater, operating upstairs over the Tangent
what-ever-you-call-it of pool, pizza, and beer.
This group of five improvisational actors are in
the third year of their work in Palo Alto; and,
if what happened last Saturday is any indica
tion, things are going very well for them. The
comfortable and attractive cabaret theatre was
filled with people obviously happy to be there
watching the actors do their improvisational
stuff. And it is important to make clear that
eighty percent of what they do is truly impro
vised and that by far the majority of ideas for
the improvs are suggested by the audience.
The central importance of the audience in
this theater is a basic tenet in founder Philip

Schultz's artistic faith. Schultz, who is a full
time teacher of English at Menlo College, is
fond of his audiences: he honors and respects
them in a direct and unique way. Where thea
ters today commonly treat audiences either as
cattle or as butts for their humor and outrage,
Schultz and his company are gentle, friendly,
eager to make their audiences a part of the
evening—even to allowing them on the small
stage as actors if they choose.
Open only on Friday and Saturday nights,
The Illegitimate is an informal, soft-sell theater
where, if one is looking for the cauftic, bitter,
scatological, revolutionary, and conventional
underground material, he will be disappointed.

that this reviewer, for one, wanted more of.
Schultz, in particular, with his incredibly plas
tic face seemed capable of a broader, more
physical communication had there been room
and view for it
The last act —it always closes their energetic
and generous evenings —is an attempt on
Schultz's part to put out the stage lights by
the will-power of diseases pride and body
whammy. His failure at the last light recalls
Beckett's exhausted world. But Ray Barrett's
success by gently, lovingly blowing out the
light seems to say something about the Ille
gitimate Theater itself. Schultz and company
are trying, in an illegitimate little theater, to
remind us of a forgotten way, a lost way, of
gentleness and love.
