# A 						right and wrong way to use Elizabeth Taylor
## 
### 
Elizabeth Taylor is a talented actress, in a limited way, and
her two recent films, Reflections in a Golden Eye, and The
Comedians, are examples of the wrong and right way to express
her talents.
The Comedians, directed by Peter Glenville, and adapted
from the Graham Greene novel, is a well put together film that
is satisfying in almost every respect. The film deals with the
dictatorship that governs Haiti and the relationship of various
individuals to that government. Burton plays a resort hotel
owner who inadvertently is drawn into rebellion against the
police when he isn't trying to satisfy himself with Ambassador
Peter Ustinov's wife, who is naturally enough Elizabeth Taylor.
In general, The Comedians, is an excellent and complete film.
The acting and casting are superb and an exciting script gen
erates both suspense and some subtle thought with regard to
man serving his own needs and recognizing and responding to
the needs of his society. Glenville does an outstanding job of
developing the relationships between Taylor and the three male
leads, the culminating point of which is a short monologue by
Guinness at the end of the film. Everyone should be happy
with the film. While it is not outstanding enough to be marked
down as a great accomplishment, it is good. There is the in
trigue of the rebellion,. the somber reflections on American
values, and the somewhat frightening conclusions as to man's
inhumanity to man. All of this is accomplished with a maxi
mum use of taste and talent.
John Huston's production of Reflections in a Golden Eye
based on a story by Carson McCullers, cast Mrs. Burton in rel
atively the same role of wife errant, which seems to be her usual
part. Huston's film however appears to be simply a series of im
pressions without a clearly defined or tight plot structure. We
are shown a series of events but they are never really explained
or elaborated upon. Miss Taylor is married to Marlon Brando,
a career Army officer with homosexual tendencies. The movie
deals with rather sordid life on an obscure Army post in the
South. Despite Huston's passion for the pseudo-surrealistic, Miss
Taylor is able to convey some feeling for her role as a totally
socially oriented individual whose only concerns are her own
pleasures. She is void of any feeling for creative or artistic en
deavors. However Huston fails to tie the separate incidents to
gether into a unified form with any meaning whatsoever. The
audience is constantly bombarded with gimmicks, not always
accompanied with technical facility, or having any meaningful
point.
We understand what is happening in the film, but why and
what for? Huston does not give the proper background or per
spective to allow us to fill in these blanks. Reflections leaves one
with little to think of other than John Huston's ability to latch
onto present trends and fads and attempt to relate them to per
sonal problems, and his failure to use the vast amount of talent
at his disposal.
