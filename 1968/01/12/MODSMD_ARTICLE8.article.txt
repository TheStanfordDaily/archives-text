The Japanese Film Festival, sponsored by the Keio Com
mittee of the Institute of International Relations, promises
to offer several fine films this quarter.
Ukigusa (Drifting Weeds) opens the festival tonight.
Ukigusa is a two hour, color film made in 1964. It was di
rected by Yasujiro Ozu, who is considered "the most Japa
nese of all directors." He has won many honors even though
few of his films have been shown outside of Japan.
Like most of the films Ozu has directed, Ukigusa centers
around character development rather than plot. A traveling
troupe of actors return to their small seaside village after a
twelve year absence.
Ukigusa will be shown in Cubberley Auditorium, tonight
at 7:30 and again at 10. Tickets for the Stanford Commu
nity are 75c, $1 for the general public.
Drama
Stanford Repertory Theater presents Candaules, Commis
sioner, at the Nitery tonight and tomorrow night at 8.
At the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco:

Harold Pinter's The Homecoming will be offered at the
Curran Theater in San Francisco tonight and Saturday. It

to-be-missed," King of Hearts, at San Mateo.
The Graduate, at Cinema 150, Santa Clara.
La Guerre Est Finie, Altos International.
Bonnie and Clyde, at the Bijou.
One movie which should be avoided is Valley of the
Dolls.
The Comedians, at the Fine Arts, Palo Alto, is well-worth
seeing, but not so the movie being shown with it, Jack of
Diamonds.
The Penthouse, playing at several locations in the area,
might be interesting.
