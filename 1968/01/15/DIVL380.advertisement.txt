Jerusalem: Coming Capital of the World
Ancient Jerusalem is mentioned in manuscripts dating as far back as the
second millenium before Christ. Called in the Bible, "Zion", "the city of David",
and "the city of a great king", Jerusalem has been the center of the bloodiest
and most terrible wars known to man. During the siege and desolation of
70 A.D., occupants of the city were forced to roast and eat their own children
to avoid starvation. Only in the light of the future restoration of Jerusalem
does this city merit its name, "City of Peace".
Since the time of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who plundered and looted
Jerusalem six centuries before Christ, the city has been under foreign (gentile)
domination almost continuously. In June 1967 the Jews regained possession
of the old city fulfilling ancient and most significant prophecies. Jesus Christ
said, "The Jews shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away
captive info all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the gentiles
until the times of the gentiles are completed" (Luke 21:24). According to the
Bible, God is setting the stage in world history for Jerusalem to become the
future capital city of the world, and for Israel to become chief among all the
nations.
"Thus says the Lord of hosts: People shall yet come, the inhabitants of many
cities,- the inhabitants of one city shall go to another saying, Let is go at once
and entreat the favor of the Lord, and seek the Lord of hosts; I am going.' Many
people and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem,
and to entreat the favor of the Lord. In those days ten men from the nations of
every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, 'Let us go with you,
for we have heard that God is with you.' " (Zechariah 8:20-233.
Exciting days lie ahead for the Holy City. Daniel's Old Testament prophecy
says that the Jews will make a treaty with a "foreign prince" who represents
the nations of the western world. They will rebuild their temple on its historic
site, reestablish their worship services for three and a half years. The foreign
prince will, however, break his agreement, and a false Jewish Messiah will
enter the temple and roclaim himself to be God. Israel will be lunged into a
terrible war in which two thirds of the peole will die, according to Zechariam.
The entire world will be involved, especially Russia, China, Egypt and western
Europe. This terrible conflict will be ended by the invasion from space of the
true Messiah and King of the Jews, Jesus Christ, who will commence rule over
all the nations from headquarters in Jerusalem.
In the light of exciting world developments centering around Jerusalem it is
vitally important that each one of us establish a deep personal relationship
with Jesus Christ. The Bible says, "God desires all men to be saved and to come
to the knowledge of the truth." Jesus Christ wishes to become Lord of our lives.
This makes it possible for us to share the future with Him, and enables God to
deliver us from the destructive forces which are soon to be unloosed on a
gigantic world-wide scale at the end of the present age.
The Bible has many details concerning the course of world history and the
future of the Jews. A thorough and complete knowledge of the Scriptures is a
must these days. And, keep your eyes on Jerusalem!

and "the city of a great king", Jerusalem has been the center of the bloodiest
and most terrible wars known to man. During the siege and desolation of
70 A.D., occupants of the city were forced to roast and eat their own children
to avoid starvation. Only in the light of the future restoration of Jerusalem
does this city merit its name, "City of Peace".
Since the time of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who plundered and looted
Jerusalem six centuries before Christ, the city has been under foreign (gentile)
domination almost continuously. In June 1967 the Jews regained possession
of the old city fulfilling ancient and most significant prophecies. Jesus Christ
said, "The Jews shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led away
captive info all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the gentiles
until the times of the gentiles are completed" (Luke 21:24). According to the
Bible, God is setting the stage in world history for Jerusalem to become the
future capital city of the world, and for Israel to become chief among all the
nations.
"Thus says the Lord of hosts: People shall yet come, the inhabitants of many
cities,- the inhabitants of one city shall go to another saying, Let is go at once
and entreat the favor of the Lord, and seek the Lord of hosts; I am going.' Many
people and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem,
and to entreat the favor of the Lord. In those days ten men from the nations of
every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, 'Let us go with you,
for we have heard that God is with you.' " (Zechariah 8:20-233.
Exciting days lie ahead for the Holy City. Daniel's Old Testament prophecy
says that the Jews will make a treaty with a "foreign prince" who represents
the nations of the western world. They will rebuild their temple on its historic
site, reestablish their worship services for three and a half years. The foreign
prince will, however, break his agreement, and a false Jewish Messiah will
enter the temple and roclaim himself to be God. Israel will be lunged into a
terrible war in which two thirds of the peole will die, according to Zechariam.
The entire world will be involved, especially Russia, China, Egypt and western
Europe. This terrible conflict will be ended by the invasion from space of the
true Messiah and King of the Jews, Jesus Christ, who will commence rule over
all the nations from headquarters in Jerusalem.
In the light of exciting world developments centering around Jerusalem it is
vitally important that each one of us establish a deep personal relationship
with Jesus Christ. The Bible says, "God desires all men to be saved and to come
to the knowledge of the truth." Jesus Christ wishes to become Lord of our lives.
This makes it possible for us to share the future with Him, and enables God to
deliver us from the destructive forces which are soon to be unloosed on a
gigantic world-wide scale at the end of the present age.
The Bible has many details concerning the course of world history and the
future of the Jews. A thorough and complete knowledge of the Scriptures is a
must these days. And, keep your eyes on Jerusalem!
Jerusalem: Coming Capital of the World
Ancient Jerusalem is mentioned in manuscripts dating as far back as the
second millenium before Christ. Called in the Bible, "Zion", "the city of David",
