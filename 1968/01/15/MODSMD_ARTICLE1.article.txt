# UC Committee Asks Changes
## 
### 
BERKELEY (AP) — A com
mission formed by the Academic
Senate and the Associated Stu
dents recommends these changes
for the Berkeley campus of the
University of California in a re
port to be issued today:
Giving students a far bigger
role in university administration.
Students would be members of
university academic and admin
istrative committees and parti
cipate in counseling.
Decreasing the chancellor's
contact with students and fac
ulty to give him better perspec
tive for establishing policy. The
idea would be to protect the dig
nity the chancellor needs to be
effective and to encourage more
forthright debate.
Decentralizing the campus
by establishing small undergrad
uate colleges. The commission
report urges four colleges of 500
students each as a start.
The report, by the Commis
sion on University Governance,
was prepared for distribution as
a 96-page supplement to the Ber
keley student newspaper Mon
day.
The commission of six stu

dents and four faculty members
was established in December
1966. It is not an arm of any
state agency.
Some of the commission's pro
posals could be adopted by the
Berkeley chancellor, Roger W.
Heyns. Others would require the
approval of the university re
gents.
The commissioners said the
atmosphere at Berkeley is hos
tile to the concept that an edu
cation there is worthwhile. The
fcaid changes are needed be
cause academic freedom is be
ing assaulted and Gov. Ronald
Reagan's administration has
been "consistently unfriendly."
"We cannot afford many rep
etitions of the events of mid-
October's antidraft activities
when an outside attack that
should have united the campus
became the occasion of a near
civil war," the report said.
The report recommended at
tacking the problems that cause
campus crises by establishing
an independent student - faculty
court system. It would carry out
discipline now the responsibility
of the chancellor.
