wound up talks in Cairo with
President Gamal Abdel Nasser
of Egypt and returned to Am
man. Informants in Cairo said
the two leaders discussed the
means of extending fresh eco
nomic aid from the oil-rich Arab
states to the three losers in the
June war — Egypt, Jordan and
Syria. Hussein had been in oil

rich Saudi Arabia before visit
ing Cairo.
— Kuwait and Iran denounced
Israel's continued occupation of
territories seized from the Ar
abs in the war. In a joint com
munique issued in Kuwait after
a visit to Iran by the Amir of
Kuwait called for the immediate
withdrawal of Israeli forces in
accordance with the resolution
of the U.N. General Assembly.
— The U.N. envoy seeking a
Middle East settlement, Gunnar
Jarring, moves his mission to
Cairo Monday to sound out
Egyptian officials on "specific
proposals" for solving the cri
sis.
In Tel Aviv, an Israeli an
nouncement said sandstorms on
the Sinai Desert had delayed un
til Monday the repatriation of
Egyptian army prisoners of
war. Several hundred Egyptian
prisoners were exchanged Fri

raelis are returning 4,500 Egyp
tians captured in the war for six
Israeli sailors, three airmen and
several civilians, the Red Cross
says.

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) —
Fighting erupted again in the
Beisan Valley along the Israeli-
Jordanian cease-fire line Sun
day, an Israeli army spokesman
reported.
Mortar fire was exchanged
but the Israelis suffered no cas
ualties or damagp, the spokes
man said.
He blamed the Jordanians for
starting the new fight—second
in two days and the third in a
week in the area—by lobbing
mortar shells into the Israeli
border settlement of Beit Yous
sef south of the Sea of Gailee.
Jordanian and Israeli forces
fought two hour-long machine
gun duels Saturday. Last Mon
day Israeli jets screamed across
the ceasefire line to silenc?
Jordanian artillery after a long
gun duel in the valley.
The Israeli army also re
ported another outbreak of
Arab sabotage against Israeli
installations. It said the sabo
teurs opened a midnight mortar
attack on the Red Sea port of
Elath but the shells landed

harmlessly in the desert sand on
the outskirts of the city.
A dispatch from Damascus
said Assifa, the military arm of
the Fatch Palestinian guerrilla
organization, claimed 22 Israeli
casualties in six raids against
Israeli targets Jan. 6-8.
An Assifa communique claim
ed the Elath-Haifa oil pipeline
was blown up in several places
in the attacks. There was no re
port of this from Israeli officials.
Assifa said 15 Israeli soldiers
were killed and 7 wounded. The
communique conceded that two
Assifa fighters were killed.
There were these political de
velopments on the Middle East
secene:
—King Hussein of Jordan
wound up talks in Cairo with
President Gamal Abdel Nasser
of Egypt and returned to Am
man. Informants in Cairo said
the two leaders discussed the
means of extending fresh eco
nomic aid from the oil-rich Arab
states to the three losers in the
June war — Egypt, Jordan and
Syria. Hussein had been in oil

rich Saudi Arabia before visit
ing Cairo.
— Kuwait and Iran denounced
Israel's continued occupation of
territories seized from the Ar
abs in the war. In a joint com
munique issued in Kuwait after
a visit to Iran by the Amir of
Kuwait called for the immediate
withdrawal of Israeli forces in
accordance with the resolution
of the U.N. General Assembly.
