# McCarthy Run Harder
## Peace Candidacy Vital 
### 
The candidacy of Eugene McCarthy is of vital
importance to the lives of many thousands of
Americans and Vietnamese and to the health of
the American political system. We believe his
nomination for President by the Democratic
party may be the only way to stop the political
alienation growing in American society.
Yet even as we hail and support his candidacy,
we are disappointed in his performance so far.
Senator McCarthy's congressional voting rec
ord and public speeches in recent years have
shown a growing dissatisfaction with American
policy in Asia and the growing scope of presi
dential power.
He has asked the moral questions concerning
our Vietnam policy that Johnson, Humphrey,
and Rusk have avoided. Only November 9, he
stated:
The time has come to ask the ultimate
question as to whether or not what is called
our commitment in South Vietnam is mor
ally defensible; to ask not only whether it
is legally, militarily, and politically defen
sible, hut also is it morally defensible and
in the national interest.
We must raise the essential moral ques
tion as to whether or not there is a proper
balance in what we may gain in what is pro
jected as victory, in contrast with the loss
of life, the loss of material integrity and
moral energy which goes with the effort.
The answer, I think, is that it is not."
Early in December when McCarthy an
nounced his candidacy, it appeared anti-war
groups had found their candidate. However,
since then McCarthy's pronouncements, public
speeches, and contentions have been suprisingly
unimpressive and his candidacy all too unexcit
ing. His comment at UCLA last week was hailed
as his strongest: "I suggest that this Administra
tion is afraid to negotiate."
One may well argue that anti-war individuals
and groups have refused to unite behind him,
but it would seem that a more forceful and blunt
approach is now needed. In any case, we must
plead with Senator McCarthy to take his can
didacy to the people the nation over, raising the
basic moral questions inherent in the Vietnam
war. He must seek broad support, drawing where
he can from both major parties and all segments
of the political spectrum. McCarthy now seems
too party-oriented, too narrowly directed to ex
cite anyone.
The importance of McCarthy's candidacy to
the lives of many thousands of American and
Vietnamese is obvious.
• He would start immediate negotiations for
peace and the cessation of the senseless violence
that continues there.
• He would seek to disengage the United
States from Southeast Asia.

• He would raise the prospect that the United
States would be able to solve some of the prob
lems of poverty and social inequality that exist
here at home.
• He would end the myth that America must
involve itself in the affairs of every nation in the
world, and that the answer to every world prob
lem is a military one.
The second great importance of the McCarthy
candidacy is that it may be the only way to re
store the trust of so many Americans in the Amer
ican political process. More and more liberals
are becoming convinced that the electoral pro
cess is impotent to bring the desperately needed
social and foreign policy reforms. Many war cri
tics are now turning to civil disobedience and
even to violence.
In this context we are angered by the actions
of Hubert Humphrey, Robert Kennedy, and the
Peace and Freedom Party. Humphrey's com
ments Saturday to the state Democratics meet
ing in Fresno were pleas for party unity, not jus
tice. The Administration has offered us no real
justification for the war, but only repeated pro
nouncements on the "morality" of the conflict.
Far be it for anything, even the unmorality of
war, to stand in the way of Humphrey's best
chance for reelection.
Robert Kennedy, who fancies himself as the
darling of the youthful set, has fallen into great
disfavor. His endorsement of Lyndon Johnson
for renomination contradicts everything he has
uttered about the war during the last year. Of
Bobby, we can only ask: how does one dissent
from Vietnam policy and still back Johnson? If
dissent is to find meaningful expression in the
political process, then it must do so now through
the McCarthy candidacy.
Just as Kennedy has shied from supporting
McCarthy out of supposed political expediency,
the Peace and Freedom party evidently is doing
the same, showing it is little more than a sham
with no real interest in the political process.
They declare McCarthy is too establishment for
them. We can only assume from this that the
Peace and Freedom party is not serious about
working within the political process. Third par
ties are good for show value but not for much
else. The only effective political challenge to the
Vietnam war this year will be the candidacy of
Senator McCarthy.
We heartily hail the visit of Senator Eugene
McCarthy to campus. We ask him to continue
to challenge the morality of the Vietnam war
and to weigh heavily the importance of his can
didacy to the health of the whole American po
litical process.

justification for the war, but only repeated pro
nouncements on the "morality" of the conflict.
Far be it for anything, even the unmorality of
war, to stand in the way of Humphrey's best
chance for reelection.
Robert Kennedy, who fancies himself as the
darling of the youthful set, has fallen into great
disfavor. His endorsement of Lyndon Johnson
for renomination contradicts everything he has
uttered about the war during the last year. Of
Bobby, we can only ask: how does one dissent
from Vietnam policy and still back Johnson? If
dissent is to find meaningful expression in the
political process, then it must do so now through
the McCarthy candidacy.
Just as Kennedy has shied from supporting
McCarthy out of supposed political expediency,
the Peace and Freedom party evidently is doing
the same, showing it is little more than a sham
with no real interest in the political process.
They declare McCarthy is too establishment for
them. We can only assume from this that the
Peace and Freedom party is not serious about
working within the political process. Third par
ties are good for show value but not for much
else. The only effective political challenge to the
Vietnam war this year will be the candidacy of
Senator McCarthy.
We heartily hail the visit of Senator Eugene
McCarthy to campus. We ask him to continue
to challenge the morality of the Vietnam war
and to weigh heavily the importance of his can
didacy to the health of the whole American po
litical process.
The candidacy of Eugene McCarthy is of vital
importance to the lives of many thousands of
Americans and Vietnamese and to the health of
the American political system. We believe his
nomination for President by the Democratic
party may be the only way to stop the political
alienation growing in American society.
Yet even as we hail and support his candidacy,
we are disappointed in his performance so far.
Senator McCarthy's congressional voting rec
ord and public speeches in recent years have
shown a growing dissatisfaction with American
policy in Asia and the growing scope of presi
dential power.
He has asked the moral questions concerning
our Vietnam policy that Johnson, Humphrey,
and Rusk have avoided. Only November 9, he
stated:
The time has come to ask the ultimate
question as to whether or not what is called
our commitment in South Vietnam is mor
ally defensible; to ask not only whether it
is legally, militarily, and politically defen
sible, hut also is it morally defensible and
in the national interest.
We must raise the essential moral ques
tion as to whether or not there is a proper
balance in what we may gain in what is pro
jected as victory, in contrast with the loss
of life, the loss of material integrity and
moral energy which goes with the effort.
The answer, I think, is that it is not."
Early in December when McCarthy an
nounced his candidacy, it appeared anti-war
groups had found their candidate. However,
since then McCarthy's pronouncements, public
speeches, and contentions have been suprisingly
unimpressive and his candidacy all too unexcit
ing. His comment at UCLA last week was hailed
as his strongest: "I suggest that this Administra
tion is afraid to negotiate."
One may well argue that anti-war individuals
and groups have refused to unite behind him,
but it would seem that a more forceful and blunt
approach is now needed. In any case, we must
plead with Senator McCarthy to take his can
didacy to the people the nation over, raising the
basic moral questions inherent in the Vietnam
war. He must seek broad support, drawing where
he can from both major parties and all segments
of the political spectrum. McCarthy now seems
too party-oriented, too narrowly directed to ex
cite anyone.
The importance of McCarthy's candidacy to
the lives of many thousands of American and
Vietnamese is obvious.
• He would start immediate negotiations for
peace and the cessation of the senseless violence
that continues there.
• He would seek to disengage the United
States from Southeast Asia.

• He would raise the prospect that the United
States would be able to solve some of the prob
lems of poverty and social inequality that exist
here at home.
• He would end the myth that America must
involve itself in the affairs of every nation in the
world, and that the answer to every world prob
lem is a military one.
The second great importance of the McCarthy
candidacy is that it may be the only way to re
store the trust of so many Americans in the Amer
ican political process. More and more liberals
are becoming convinced that the electoral pro
cess is impotent to bring the desperately needed
social and foreign policy reforms. Many war cri
tics are now turning to civil disobedience and
even to violence.
In this context we are angered by the actions
of Hubert Humphrey, Robert Kennedy, and the
Peace and Freedom Party. Humphrey's com
ments Saturday to the state Democratics meet
ing in Fresno were pleas for party unity, not jus
tice. The Administration has offered us no real
justification for the war, but only repeated pro

war. He must seek broad support, drawing where
he can from both major parties and all segments
of the political spectrum. McCarthy now seems
too party-oriented, too narrowly directed to ex
cite anyone.
The importance of McCarthy's candidacy to
the lives of many thousands of American and
Vietnamese is obvious.
• He would start immediate negotiations for
peace and the cessation of the senseless violence
that continues there.
• He would seek to disengage the United
States from Southeast Asia.

• He would raise the prospect that the United
States would be able to solve some of the prob
lems of poverty and social inequality that exist
here at home.
• He would end the myth that America must
involve itself in the affairs of every nation in the
world, and that the answer to every world prob
lem is a military one.
The second great importance of the McCarthy
candidacy is that it may be the only way to re
store the trust of so many Americans in the Amer
ican political process. More and more liberals
are becoming convinced that the electoral pro
cess is impotent to bring the desperately needed
social and foreign policy reforms. Many war cri
tics are now turning to civil disobedience and
even to violence.
In this context we are angered by the actions
of Hubert Humphrey, Robert Kennedy, and the
Peace and Freedom Party. Humphrey's com
ments Saturday to the state Democratics meet
ing in Fresno were pleas for party unity, not jus
tice. The Administration has offered us no real
justification for the war, but only repeated pro
nouncements on the "morality" of the conflict.
Far be it for anything, even the unmorality of
war, to stand in the way of Humphrey's best
chance for reelection.
Robert Kennedy, who fancies himself as the
darling of the youthful set, has fallen into great
disfavor. His endorsement of Lyndon Johnson
for renomination contradicts everything he has
uttered about the war during the last year. Of
Bobby, we can only ask: how does one dissent
from Vietnam policy and still back Johnson? If
dissent is to find meaningful expression in the
political process, then it must do so now through
the McCarthy candidacy.
Just as Kennedy has shied from supporting
McCarthy out of supposed political expediency,
the Peace and Freedom party evidently is doing
the same, showing it is little more than a sham
with no real interest in the political process.
They declare McCarthy is too establishment for
them. We can only assume from this that the
Peace and Freedom party is not serious about
working within the political process. Third par
ties are good for show value but not for much
else. The only effective political challenge to the
Vietnam war this year will be the candidacy of
Senator McCarthy.
We heartily hail the visit of Senator Eugene
McCarthy to campus. We ask him to continue
to challenge the morality of the Vietnam war
and to weigh heavily the importance of his can
didacy to the health of the whole American po
litical process.
The candidacy of Eugene McCarthy is of vital
importance to the lives of many thousands of
Americans and Vietnamese and to the health of
the American political system. We believe his
nomination for President by the Democratic
party may be the only way to stop the political
alienation growing in American society.
Yet even as we hail and support his candidacy,
we are disappointed in his performance so far.
Senator McCarthy's congressional voting rec
ord and public speeches in recent years have
shown a growing dissatisfaction with American
policy in Asia and the growing scope of presi
dential power.
He has asked the moral questions concerning
our Vietnam policy that Johnson, Humphrey,
and Rusk have avoided. Only November 9, he
stated:
The time has come to ask the ultimate
question as to whether or not what is called
our commitment in South Vietnam is mor
ally defensible; to ask not only whether it
is legally, militarily, and politically defen
sible, hut also is it morally defensible and
in the national interest.
We must raise the essential moral ques
tion as to whether or not there is a proper
balance in what we may gain in what is pro
jected as victory, in contrast with the loss
of life, the loss of material integrity and
moral energy which goes with the effort.
The answer, I think, is that it is not."
Early in December when McCarthy an
nounced his candidacy, it appeared anti-war
groups had found their candidate. However,
since then McCarthy's pronouncements, public
speeches, and contentions have been suprisingly
unimpressive and his candidacy all too unexcit
ing. His comment at UCLA last week was hailed
as his strongest: "I suggest that this Administra
tion is afraid to negotiate."
One may well argue that anti-war individuals
and groups have refused to unite behind him,
but it would seem that a more forceful and blunt
approach is now needed. In any case, we must
plead with Senator McCarthy to take his can
didacy to the people the nation over, raising the
basic moral questions inherent in the Vietnam
war. He must seek broad support, drawing where
he can from both major parties and all segments
of the political spectrum. McCarthy now seems
too party-oriented, too narrowly directed to ex
cite anyone.
