# McCarthy Vs. Boneless Bobby
## 
### Henry J. Taylor 
I take off my hat to Sen. Eu
gene J. McCarthy, certainly at
least for his courage in fasci
nating contrast to Sen. Robert
F. Kennedy's self-serving oppor
tunism in playing it cool. Bob
by, the boneless wonder, should
be ashamed.
McCarthy knows that sticking
his neck out on the Vietnam is
sue this way is not prudent in
his party. But honest Eugene J.
McCarthy is at least trying to
stop the rot in the American po
litical system, including a party
leadership that applies its White
House muscle power with all the
force and crunch of a half nel
son.
McCarthy is challenging this.
Honor the brave. Bobby, in con
trast, has typically contrived to
stay neutral until he can dis

cover who is holding the gun.
McCarthy is trying to demon
strate that the party system is
not a controlled fraud. And in
this he is no phony.
Principle Vs. Opportunism
He is defying exactly the kind
of political opportunism, backed
by money and entrenched power,
which Bobby Kennedy has made
into a career, first on his broth
er's coattails and thereafter for
as long as he conceivably could.
Instead of opportunism, Eugene
McCarthy is pursuing the lone
ly route of principle.
McCarthy is promoting hon
estly the essential requirement
that party dissenters can ex
press their grievances whether
their cause is lost—and should
be lost—or not.
Sure-shot Bobby, the boneless

wonder, isn't sure he can afford
this. In his high noon with Pres
ident Johnson, Bobby's battle
cry becomes, "Ready, aim, don't
fire, flee."
This mafioso-in-chief of the
Kennedy clan has expressed
views about the Vietnam war
similar to McCarthy's, and even
more strongly. But he has not
publicly endorsed Senator Mc-
Carthy. He courageously stays
where the bullets are the thick
est, which is under the ammuni
tion wagon.
With a magnanimity nearly
incredible in a political figure
(the more I write about this
man the more I like him, al
though I think his views are dis
astrous), McCarthy excuses
such Senators as J. William Ful
bright, Gaylord A. Nelson,
Wayne Morse, Joseph S. Clark,
etc., who are equally critical in
the Senate of the Johnson Viet
nam policy, for convenient
failure to endorse him.
The Minnesotan philosophical
ly stated on January 5, "They
face hard fights for re-election."
But Sen. Robert Kennedy does
not even face a re-election con
test, and neither does his broth
er.
Maybe Another Time
Asked whether the brothers'
help would not be useful, espe
cially in the Massachusetts pri
mary, McCarthy said, "Yes, it
would be."
He asked the brothers for help,
not for advice. Their advice, as
usual, and costing them nothing,
poured out like apples from a
basket. But help? This potential
loser was talking to the wrong
clan. The Kennedy brothers
merely gave McCarthy the un
willing politicians' smile that
tells you to come back another
day.
Yet Bobby is always talking
about principles. In truth, so far
as I can see, his principle in
public life, and certainly his per
formance with Senator McCar
thy, is merely his time-worn
stunt of "Do as I say," not "Do
as I do." And the cynicism in
this I find downright frighten
ing.

Bobby, who would as soon ad
mit it now as eat a panther's
paw, has been on all sides of the
Vietnam question. In his role of
what many have described as co-
President with his brother, and
in a fundamental break with the
Truman-Eisenhower policy, no
living man is more responsible
than Bobby Kennedy for com
mitting American ground troops
to this land war in Southeast
Asia.
In support of his brother's
break, Bobby went to Saigon
and spouted off there in Febru
ary, 1962, as a tremendous
hawk. And should any reader
question this, may I again quote
his statement: "We're going to
win the war in Vietnam. We will
remain until we do win ... I
think the American people un
derstand and fully support the
struggle."
But since President Johnson
succeeded to the White House
this springing lion of the po
litical jungles, his ambitious
eyes as hot as the Sahara, has
completely changed his stance.
Seeking to unseat LBJ, Bobby
has simply waited and watched
the pressure gauges of public
opinion about Vietnam to decide
when and how loud to blow his
whistle. But strange things hap
pen in the pendulous mechanism
of political history when you
play it that cool. The chances
are overwhelming that Bobby
will outsmart himself.

usual, and costing them nothing,
poured out like apples from a
basket. But help? This potential
loser was talking to the wrong
clan. The Kennedy brothers
merely gave McCarthy the un
willing politicians' smile that
tells you to come back another
day.
Yet Bobby is always talking
about principles. In truth, so far
as I can see, his principle in
public life, and certainly his per
formance with Senator McCar
thy, is merely his time-worn
stunt of "Do as I say," not "Do
as I do." And the cynicism in
this I find downright frighten
ing.

Bobby, who would as soon ad
mit it now as eat a panther's
paw, has been on all sides of the
Vietnam question. In his role of
what many have described as co-
President with his brother, and
in a fundamental break with the
Truman-Eisenhower policy, no
living man is more responsible
than Bobby Kennedy for com
mitting American ground troops
to this land war in Southeast
Asia.
In support of his brother's
break, Bobby went to Saigon
and spouted off there in Febru
ary, 1962, as a tremendous
hawk. And should any reader
question this, may I again quote
his statement: "We're going to
win the war in Vietnam. We will
remain until we do win ... I
think the American people un
derstand and fully support the
struggle."
But since President Johnson
succeeded to the White House
this springing lion of the po
litical jungles, his ambitious
eyes as hot as the Sahara, has
completely changed his stance.
Seeking to unseat LBJ, Bobby
has simply waited and watched
the pressure gauges of public
opinion about Vietnam to decide
when and how loud to blow his
whistle. But strange things hap
pen in the pendulous mechanism
of political history when you
play it that cool. The chances
are overwhelming that Bobby
will outsmart himself.

I take off my hat to Sen. Eu
gene J. McCarthy, certainly at
least for his courage in fasci
nating contrast to Sen. Robert
F. Kennedy's self-serving oppor
tunism in playing it cool. Bob
by, the boneless wonder, should
be ashamed.
McCarthy knows that sticking
his neck out on the Vietnam is
sue this way is not prudent in
his party. But honest Eugene J.
McCarthy is at least trying to
stop the rot in the American po
litical system, including a party
leadership that applies its White
House muscle power with all the
force and crunch of a half nel
son.
McCarthy is challenging this.
Honor the brave. Bobby, in con
trast, has typically contrived to
stay neutral until he can dis

cover who is holding the gun.
McCarthy is trying to demon
strate that the party system is
not a controlled fraud. And in
this he is no phony.
Principle Vs. Opportunism
He is defying exactly the kind
of political opportunism, backed
by money and entrenched power,
which Bobby Kennedy has made
into a career, first on his broth
er's coattails and thereafter for
as long as he conceivably could.
Instead of opportunism, Eugene
McCarthy is pursuing the lone
ly route of principle.
McCarthy is promoting hon
estly the essential requirement
that party dissenters can ex
press their grievances whether
their cause is lost—and should
be lost—or not.
Sure-shot Bobby, the boneless

wonder, isn't sure he can afford
this. In his high noon with Pres
ident Johnson, Bobby's battle
cry becomes, "Ready, aim, don't
fire, flee."
This mafioso-in-chief of the
Kennedy clan has expressed
views about the Vietnam war
similar to McCarthy's, and even
more strongly. But he has not
publicly endorsed Senator Mc-
Carthy. He courageously stays
where the bullets are the thick
est, which is under the ammuni
tion wagon.
With a magnanimity nearly
incredible in a political figure
(the more I write about this
man the more I like him, al
though I think his views are dis
astrous), McCarthy excuses
such Senators as J. William Ful
bright, Gaylord A. Nelson,
Wayne Morse, Joseph S. Clark,
etc., who are equally critical in
the Senate of the Johnson Viet
nam policy, for convenient
failure to endorse him.
The Minnesotan philosophical
ly stated on January 5, "They
face hard fights for re-election."
But Sen. Robert Kennedy does
not even face a re-election con
test, and neither does his broth
er.

Asked whether the brothers'
help would not be useful, espe
cially in the Massachusetts pri
mary, McCarthy said, "Yes, it
would be."

of political opportunism, backed
by money and entrenched power,
which Bobby Kennedy has made
into a career, first on his broth
er's coattails and thereafter for
as long as he conceivably could.
Instead of opportunism, Eugene
McCarthy is pursuing the lone
ly route of principle.
McCarthy is promoting hon
estly the essential requirement
that party dissenters can ex
press their grievances whether
their cause is lost—and should
be lost—or not.
Sure-shot Bobby, the boneless

wonder, isn't sure he can afford
this. In his high noon with Pres
ident Johnson, Bobby's battle
cry becomes, "Ready, aim, don't
fire, flee."
This mafioso-in-chief of the
Kennedy clan has expressed
views about the Vietnam war
similar to McCarthy's, and even
more strongly. But he has not
publicly endorsed Senator Mc-
Carthy. He courageously stays
where the bullets are the thick
est, which is under the ammuni
tion wagon.
With a magnanimity nearly
incredible in a political figure
(the more I write about this
man the more I like him, al
though I think his views are dis
astrous), McCarthy excuses
such Senators as J. William Ful
bright, Gaylord A. Nelson,
Wayne Morse, Joseph S. Clark,
etc., who are equally critical in
the Senate of the Johnson Viet
nam policy, for convenient
failure to endorse him.
The Minnesotan philosophical
ly stated on January 5, "They
face hard fights for re-election."
But Sen. Robert Kennedy does
not even face a re-election con
test, and neither does his broth
er.
Maybe Another Time
Asked whether the brothers'
help would not be useful, espe
cially in the Massachusetts pri
mary, McCarthy said, "Yes, it
would be."
He asked the brothers for help,
not for advice. Their advice, as
usual, and costing them nothing,
poured out like apples from a
basket. But help? This potential
loser was talking to the wrong
clan. The Kennedy brothers
merely gave McCarthy the un
willing politicians' smile that
tells you to come back another
day.
Yet Bobby is always talking
about principles. In truth, so far
as I can see, his principle in
public life, and certainly his per
formance with Senator McCar
thy, is merely his time-worn
stunt of "Do as I say," not "Do
as I do." And the cynicism in
this I find downright frighten
ing.

Bobby, who would as soon ad
mit it now as eat a panther's
paw, has been on all sides of the
Vietnam question. In his role of
what many have described as co-
President with his brother, and
in a fundamental break with the
Truman-Eisenhower policy, no
living man is more responsible
than Bobby Kennedy for com
mitting American ground troops
to this land war in Southeast
Asia.
In support of his brother's
break, Bobby went to Saigon
and spouted off there in Febru
ary, 1962, as a tremendous
hawk. And should any reader
question this, may I again quote
his statement: "We're going to
win the war in Vietnam. We will
remain until we do win ... I
think the American people un
derstand and fully support the
struggle."
But since President Johnson
succeeded to the White House
this springing lion of the po
litical jungles, his ambitious
eyes as hot as the Sahara, has
completely changed his stance.
Seeking to unseat LBJ, Bobby
has simply waited and watched
the pressure gauges of public
opinion about Vietnam to decide
when and how loud to blow his
whistle. But strange things hap
pen in the pendulous mechanism
of political history when you
play it that cool. The chances
are overwhelming that Bobby
will outsmart himself.

I take off my hat to Sen. Eu
gene J. McCarthy, certainly at
least for his courage in fasci
nating contrast to Sen. Robert
F. Kennedy's self-serving oppor
tunism in playing it cool. Bob
by, the boneless wonder, should
be ashamed.
McCarthy knows that sticking
his neck out on the Vietnam is
sue this way is not prudent in
his party. But honest Eugene J.
McCarthy is at least trying to
stop the rot in the American po
litical system, including a party
leadership that applies its White
House muscle power with all the
force and crunch of a half nel
son.
McCarthy is challenging this.
Honor the brave. Bobby, in con
trast, has typically contrived to
stay neutral until he can dis

cover who is holding the gun.
McCarthy is trying to demon
strate that the party system is
not a controlled fraud. And in
this he is no phony.
