# Letters To The Editor
## Ambition Is Produced By Difficulties 
### 
Editor, The Dal^:
(In the standard daily maga
zine, Jan. 12.) T j. - 1 1 i
Billy Graham and Tim Haight
(D Hume) each j .presented a
qmrkoflife:
The hippy says, Father, I
hate you, and I want you to
know why I hate you. I hate you
because you have given me too
much. I have never had to strug
gle, or work, or fight! I hate you
for it."
Hume writes, "Is Deity willing
to prevent evil, but not able?
Then He is not omnipotent. Is
He able, but not willing? Then
He is malevolent."
These thoughts answer each
other. Our families and our coun
try give us everything, yet they
complain when we show no am
bition. The Deity wants us to put
out, too, but He has sense enough
to leave obstacles (evil) in the
picture, knowing people produce
their best while working to over
come whatever challenges are
left in life.

• Code Applies To
Graded Civ Exams
Editor, The Daily:
Can Stanford students trust
one another? How valid is the
honor code?
As a new instructor in the
"History of Western Civilization"
program I was naively under the

impression that an honor code
was in effect at this university.
However the recent theft of
twelve final examniations has
forced me to raise serious ques
tions concerning the honor sys
tem at Stanford.
Twelve of my History 1 stu
dents informed me that their
final examination papers are
missing from the "Western Civ
ilization" boxes on the ground
floor of the history corner. Ele
ven of the twelve missing exam
inations belong to students who
had received "A" grades on this
examination!
In discussing this situation
with other members of the Civ
staff I learned that certain or
ganization on this campus regu
larly "collect" superior examina
tions for their "files" which are
then used by their members in
preparing for future examina
tions. I have no objections to
such "files" provided the exam
inations are "collected" with the
consent of the students who have
written them and that such
"files" be made accessible to all
students wishing to use them.
In fact I regularly put copies of
"A" grade examination papers
on file in the undergraduate li
brary — with the consent of the
students to whom the papers
belong!
If the quality of the students
belonging to certain campus or
ganizations is so poor that they
can not provide "A" grade papers
for the organization's "files" per
haps they might make use of

the library facilities. Otherwise
they should consider some sort
of monetary remuneration for
quality students in order to in
duce them to deposit their exam
inations in the "files."
However the fact remains that
twelve Civ students have had
their final examinations removed
without their consent. The in
dividual or individuals respon
sible for this situation are guilty
not only of violating the Stan
ford honor code, they are guilty
of pure and simple THEFT!
They and the persons who coop
erate with them have STOLEN
the property of members of the
Stanford community. Their mor
al responsibility is clear—return
these examinations to the right
ful owners at once or withdraw
from this community.

Editor, the Dally:
How's about backing a pen
sion plan for us career graduate
students who can't seem to leave
the warm womb of the univer

• Feeding Habits
Of Law Students
Editor, the Daily:
The literary content of THIS
letter stinks and so does Dean
Bayless Manning's opinion of
his bright students of law. He
speaks of his 95 percentile men
as if they truly were going to
guide this country to greater
heights in social and human
justice.
This is a complete farce. Dean
Manning should eat with his
legal children if he would like
to see them as they really are.
He would no doubt be awed at
the great precision and care
demonstrated during the SEMI
MONTHLY FOOD FIGHT in
Encina commons. He would bo
floored by the sound of ham
mered poppings of plastic milk
glasses. Regretably, the sights
and sounds of Stanford law stu
dents at meal time resembles
the activity of kindergarteners
at lunch.
This demonstrated maturity,
(somehow class maturity and
living maturity are antinomies)
along with the newly estab
lished Pub (most people call it
a tavern; I call it a legal wallow
ing hole) in the basement of
Crothers should greatly increase
the odds against being able to
pass this residence without be
ing bombarded by flying food
debris or seeing a stumbling
figure moving aimlessly through
the shadows. Something is dras
tically wrong with your law stu
dents, . . . Mr. Manning. It
would be interesting to make a

brief on their maturity, or may
be on the relevance of your law
school?

• Birds And Bees:
They're Telling Us
Editor, the Daily:
Autumn quarter of this aca
demic year I resided in a tent
beneath a foliated sky of red
woods and oaks. I enjoyed my
self immensely, and found great
solace in the beauty of the area
around my home.
This quarter I was forced to
find a new location for my
dwelling. So, with sharp eye and
keen ear, I set out for the leg
endary Land of Aesthetics, Stan
ford University. "Surely I shall
find great beauty at such a won
drous place," I exclaimed.
But what did I find there?
Beer cans, pop bottles, news
papers, cement slabs, automo
bile parts, used lumber, tire
tracks, high tension wires, radar
scopes, mattresses, clothing,
cardboard boxes, paint cans, old
Christmas trees, refrigerators,
brushes, combs, broken lamps,
dilapidated chairs, and a com
plete set of Playboys dating
back to 1962.
People, you have a real nice
bunch of trees and plants and
things out here. So why the hell
do you insist on throwing all
your garbage on top of the
beauty. I think it's way past
time that you all quit waiting
around for someone to pick up
after you.
I know I speak for all the
trees and hills and animals
when I say, "WE DON'T WANT
YOUR TRASH!" Please, people,
be more careful. It's beginning
to look like Yosemite Valley
around here. And no one in his
right mind would pitch a tent
there.
