# Second Vietnam?
## 
### BRUCE MERRY 
An old woman with a wrin
kled face and tufts of hair
creeping amiably from her nos
trils accosted me in the Palo
Alto Post Office on Saturday
evening. "I know," she whis
pered, "they'll be taking over
here within weeks."
She reminds me of Regis De
bray, only he is right and she
was wrong. Debray's Revolu
tion In The Revolution? is one
of those rare and splendid books
which sweep away the accre
tions of bureaucracy and the
cobweb of justice. In a slim
volume translated as an Ever
green Black Cat book (126
pages, 95 cents) Debray is now
before the North American
reader. What will we make of
it?
The U.S.A. is a politically un
touchable country. Militarily it
has the most colossal and fright
ening defense system ever or
ganized. Not a single inland
city has been bombarded, infil
trated or sacked.
To its north the Union has
fellow-travelers whose business
it controls by majority share
holding in Power, Automobiles,
etc. To its south it has Mexico.
Mexico, with its expanding in
dustry and self re-electing oli
garchy, provides a safe buffer
kingdom and the "stablest dem
ocracy in Latin America."
Look Beyond
At Acapulco, however, the
joke ends. It also ends in Puerto
Rico, but that's another story.
Beyond Acapulco you get
Guatemala with memories of
the 13th Of November Move
ment still very much alive; then
you get the Hondurases (the
colonial ticket on "British" just
means you pay no duty on good
ies there), Nicaragua, and Pan
ama . . .
Here is where the commies
take over. A fact to which a
number of those in the State
Department have not yet wised
is that every single country in
South America has an indigen
ous guerilla movement. Yet the
program of Debray's book is
that "The Cuban Revolution
can no longer be repeated in
Latin America."
The Way It Is
The author explains in socio
military terms even Hubert
could grasp the reasons why
Castro-type insurgency would
not work in, say, Bolivia. He
shows exhaustively why mere

guerilla self-protection (such as
that of Fidel's early Sierra Ma
estra campaigns) is inadequate;
that policy will not oblige the
enemy to "see to it that the sit
uation does not worsen." (Che
Guevara's dictim).
Debray continues: "Self-de
fense permits the ruling class
to conceal its true character as
a dictatorship of violence." and
he attempts a division of insur
rection in both Cuba and "cer
tain other Latin American coun
tries" into three stages: estab
lishment; development and fi
nally revolutionary offensive at
once political and military.
Trotskyism, with benign and
muddled theory of urban syn
dicalism, is argued to have ham
pered communist progress in
Latin America. "At bottom (it)
is a metaphysic paved with good
intentions. It is based on a be
lief in the natural goodness of
the workers, which is always
perverted by evil bureaucracies
(sc: Stalinism) but never des
troyed."
Only HLs Constancy
No: the gnerillero uses a
pseudonym, has only his knap
sack and clings to the slogan:
"Constant vigilance, constant
mistrust, constant mobility."
Not only must the Brazilian
or Peruvian guerilla do armed
propaganda; he must be armed

propaganda. He must have
"achieved active support by the
masses, a solid rearguard, regu
lar provisioning, a broad intelli
gence network, rapid mail ser
vice, and a recruiting center."
One puerillero is calculated to
match the strength, in the field,
of 500 regular troops in the
absence of aerial harassment.
Where there is air assault (as
in the South Vietnamese jungle)
the effective guerilla / regular
ratio drops much lower.
But "it is an incontrovertible
law that a regular army is de
feated when its elite corps is
destroyed." (Dienbienphu; Viet
nam, where as soon as a few
marines get shot, the American
infantry goes haywire.)
Revolution In The Revolu
tion? answers a few other ques
tions. Where was Che Guevara
when the Capitalist Press hinted
Fidel had killed him for jeal
ousy? He was training with the
N.L.F. in South Vietnam for
his eventual headship of the
guerilla rebellion in Bolivia.
What about the Peace Corps
in Latin America? The Peace
Corps, though it will not admit
anyone with "known C.I.A. affil
iations, is part of the Norte
americano effort to respectabil
ise silent counter-revolutionary
activities in the "Second Viet
nam."
