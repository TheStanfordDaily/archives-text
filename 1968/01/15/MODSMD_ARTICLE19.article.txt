## Battling Discrimination At Tresidder; The Meek Claim Their Cheeseburgers 
### Herbie Hinckes 
It is time to speak out against
the massive injustices occurring
everyday at Tresidder Union.
Within the dark confines of that
prefab monolith Stanford stu
dents are being cheated out of
their dignity at this moment.
The problem is cheeseburgers.
At a Great University no one
should have to order a cheese
burger three times. At a Great
University no one should have
to commit mayhem upon his
brother to get a bacon, let
tuce and tomato sandwich,
much less a plate of cold French
fries.
For example, it is possible
at any time to step up to the
grill at Tresidder and make
such a simple request as "A
cheeseburger and fries please."
And it is also possible to get a
cheeseburger and fries—after a
fashion.
I have seen students collapse
from hunger at that grill. When
I was a freshman, I thought
they were hunger strikers and
I sympathized with their cause,
whatever it was. But as an off
campus sophomore, eating an

occsional lunch at the Union, I
soon learned that their cause
was existence itself.
Customers at the grill may be
classified in four ways:
The bold—These students can
hardly sweat the small stuff,
such as ordering. They walk in,
pick up a hamburger, pay for it,
and eat. They also range from
200 to 300 pounds and are over
six feet tall.
The Meek—as the year goes
on, these students lose weight
until they are finally turned
over to the Medical School for
anatomy labs.
The Feminine—this category
is narrower than it at first ap
pears. The Feminine customer
must be beautiful. Once this
criterion is met, she may have
anything she wants, and usually
gets it within 30 seconds. Any
girl without a good body or face
must be classified with The
Meek.
The Employee—all of the for
malities are bypassed for this
customer. He simply walks into
the kitchen and cooks his own
hamburger.

What's wrong with the sys
tem?
Me.
I'm not six feet tall, nor do
I weigh anywhere near 200
pounds. I'm not an employee.
I'm not a female. So they're
about to turn me over to the
Med School.
However, I have found ways
to fight The System. Now, when
some big freshman takes my
cheeseburger, I merely walk
over to him as he is paying for
it, take it off his tray, and in
that inimitable manner learned
from watching Soupy Sales too
often, spread it from his chin
to his foreheail'Theri I run like
hell. oh ■*%> ii l i
To combat The Feminine takes
more origihality. After a curva
ceous pompon girl has stolen

my long-awaited food, I wait un
til she's standing in the line for
the cash register, holding the
tray with both hands. Thr>n I
begin taking off her skirt.
Either she will drop the cheese
burger, in which case I get to
eat that day, or she will not drop
the cheeseburger, in which case
I still have a good time.
This column is swiftly coming
to a close because I am about to
collapse from hunger again. But
before they deliver me to Cowell
Health Center I would like to
make a suggestion for improving
the lot of The Meek. Give psy
chological tests to all students
to determine their meeknoss.
then allow The Meek the first
priority on all food served at the
grill.
Either do that, baby, or we'll
never inherit the earth.
