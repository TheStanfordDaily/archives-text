# Facing Mideast Problems
## 
### Max Lerner 
The Johnson-Eshkol meeting,
whatever its other results, was
bound to yield political dividends
to each man in his own country
. But there are long-term fun
damental problems about Mid
east peace and stability that
Americans, along with others,
must face. They will not be re
solved by haggling about how
many planes America will or
will not sell to Israel. It won't
help either Mideast peace or
American national interest to
run a will-they, won't-they guess
ing contest about American mili
tary supplies to Israel.
For the Arab ploy is that, no
matter how completely the
Arabs allow the Soviet Union to
rearm them, America won't dare
function as the chief source of
Israeli arms, for fear of throw
ing the Arabs further into Rus
sia's embrace.
Choose The Best Answer
The Arabs had better be dis
abused. The best answer is that
American diplomacy doesn't aim
at winning or losing friends in
either camp in the Middle East,
but at doing whatever will main
tain a Mideast balance to pre
vent another war.

If this can be done best by
selling only limited arms to Is
rael, let us do it. If it can be
done best by selling Israel all
the arms it needs, let us do it.
If it can be done best by selling
substantial arms to Israel and
to a number of moderate nonfa
natical Arab states, let us do it.
The crucial question is not
whether the Arabs smile or
frown, but how to maintain a
long enough breathing-spell for
Israel and the Arab states alike
to flower as societies and cul
tures.
Arabs Are Split
Can this be done? I start with
the assumption that the Arab
camp is far from unified about
policy toward Israel and that the
real struggle is between the
moderates and the extremists
within the camp.
Extreme regimes, like Syria
and Iraq, now re-armed beyond
their earlier levels, are hoping to
use Soviet arms to get a heavy
advantage over Israel and this
time take it by surprise in a
war. This is true also of one fac
tion within Egypt.
The best argument the Arab
moderates can use is that it can't

be done. That Is why a well
equipped Israeli air force and
army to balance the Soviet
equipment of the Arabs are a
powerful argument on the mod
erate side in the Arab camp.
Don't Look For Miracles
Some Americans may point
out the superior fighting power
of the Israeli troops, fliers and
officers and therefore argue that
Israel needs no arms parity
against Soviet re arming of the
Arabs, that the Israelis can win
again with their hands tied be
hind their back.
Success also carries a penalty,
but this reasoning is to penalize
Israel needlessly and foolishly.
The Arab soldier had an unde
servedly bad press. On another
occasion, with a better-prepared
leadership, he will fight better.
It would be folly for American
policy-makers to count on anoth
er Israeli miracle and another.
Missileaneous Problems
There is another danger in too
disparate an arms balance.
Whichever side feels itself
David against a Goliath will be
tempted to arm itself with mis
siles the next time around.
There are already charges and
countercharges about missile
preparation between the two
camps and, while they are prob
ably exaggerated, the great
powers cannot ignore the dan
ger. This only makes the cur
rent peace mission of U.N. Am

bassador Jarring all the more
urgent and a clear, firm Ameri
can policy all the more decisive.
There are those who say that
Arabs and Israelis can never live
side by side without killing each
other. That was once said in Eu
rope about Protestants and Cath
olics. It was said in Europe af
ter World War II about commu
nism and the West. Yet today
each camp has had to learn to
live with the other side as a fact
of life.
The Arabs will have to learn
this fact of life, as the Israelis
already have. The Middle East
cannot remain permanently an
armed jungle, with unnamed
terrors lurking on each side.
Jarring will be useful if he
can suggest to the die-hard Arab
leaders that they don't have to
talk to the Israelis directly.
They can at first talk with them,
through him. In time they will
talk to the Israelis.
In time also, when the success
of a military adventure seems
impossible, the Arabs will profit
from the higher level of Israel's
technology and managerial skills
which can be used for both cul
tures. In time —who knows? —
there may even be that not im
possible Utopia: an Arab-Israeli
common market and perhaps
even a confederal Arab-Israeli
state.

Israel needlessly and foolishly.
The Arab soldier had an unde
servedly bad press. On another

Missileaneous Problems
There is another danger in too
disparate an arms balance.
Whichever side feels itself
David against a Goliath will be
tempted to arm itself with mis
siles the next time around.
There are already charges and
countercharges about missile
preparation between the two
camps and, while they are prob
ably exaggerated, the great
powers cannot ignore the dan
ger. This only makes the cur
rent peace mission of U.N. Am

bassador Jarring all the more
urgent and a clear, firm Ameri
can policy all the more decisive.
There are those who say that
Arabs and Israelis can never live
side by side without killing each
other. That was once said in Eu
rope about Protestants and Cath
olics. It was said in Europe af
ter World War II about commu
nism and the West. Yet today
each camp has had to learn to
live with the other side as a fact
of life.
The Arabs will have to learn
this fact of life, as the Israelis
already have. The Middle East
cannot remain permanently an
armed jungle, with unnamed
terrors lurking on each side.
Jarring will be useful if he
can suggest to the die-hard Arab
leaders that they don't have to
talk to the Israelis directly.
They can at first talk with them,
through him. In time they will
talk to the Israelis.
In time also, when the success
of a military adventure seems
impossible, the Arabs will profit
from the higher level of Israel's
technology and managerial skills
which can be used for both cul
tures. In time —who knows? —
there may even be that not im
possible Utopia: an Arab-Israeli
common market and perhaps
even a confederal Arab-Israeli
state.

The Johnson-Eshkol meeting,
whatever its other results, was
bound to yield political dividends
to each man in his own country
. But there are long-term fun
damental problems about Mid
east peace and stability that
Americans, along with others,
must face. They will not be re
solved by haggling about how
many planes America will or
will not sell to Israel. It won't
help either Mideast peace or
American national interest to
run a will-they, won't-they guess
ing contest about American mili
tary supplies to Israel.
For the Arab ploy is that, no
matter how completely the
Arabs allow the Soviet Union to
rearm them, America won't dare
function as the chief source of
Israeli arms, for fear of throw
ing the Arabs further into Rus
sia's embrace.
Choose The Best Answer
The Arabs had better be dis
abused. The best answer is that
American diplomacy doesn't aim
at winning or losing friends in
either camp in the Middle East,
but at doing whatever will main
tain a Mideast balance to pre
vent another war.

If this can be done best by
selling only limited arms to Is
rael, let us do it. If it can be
done best by selling Israel all
the arms it needs, let us do it.
If it can be done best by selling
substantial arms to Israel and
to a number of moderate nonfa
natical Arab states, let us do it.
The crucial question is not
whether the Arabs smile or
frown, but how to maintain a
long enough breathing-spell for
Israel and the Arab states alike
to flower as societies and cul
tures.
Arabs Are Split
Can this be done? I start with
the assumption that the Arab
camp is far from unified about
policy toward Israel and that the
real struggle is between the
moderates and the extremists
within the camp.
Extreme regimes, like Syria
and Iraq, now re-armed beyond
their earlier levels, are hoping to
use Soviet arms to get a heavy
advantage over Israel and this
time take it by surprise in a
war. This is true also of one fac
tion within Egypt.
The best argument the Arab
moderates can use is that it can't

be done. That Is why a well
equipped Israeli air force and
army to balance the Soviet
equipment of the Arabs are a
powerful argument on the mod
erate side in the Arab camp.
Don't Look For Miracles
Some Americans may point
out the superior fighting power
of the Israeli troops, fliers and
officers and therefore argue that
Israel needs no arms parity
against Soviet re arming of the
Arabs, that the Israelis can win
again with their hands tied be
hind their back.
Success also carries a penalty,
but this reasoning is to penalize
Israel needlessly and foolishly.

Israeli arms, for fear of throw
ing the Arabs further into Rus
sia's embrace.
Choose The Best Answer
The Arabs had better be dis
abused. The best answer is that
American diplomacy doesn't aim
at winning or losing friends in
either camp in the Middle East,
but at doing whatever will main
tain a Mideast balance to pre
vent another war.

If this can be done best by
selling only limited arms to Is
rael, let us do it. If it can be
done best by selling Israel all
the arms it needs, let us do it.
If it can be done best by selling
substantial arms to Israel and
to a number of moderate nonfa
natical Arab states, let us do it.
The crucial question is not
whether the Arabs smile or
frown, but how to maintain a
long enough breathing-spell for
Israel and the Arab states alike
to flower as societies and cul
tures.
Arabs Are Split
Can this be done? I start with
the assumption that the Arab
camp is far from unified about
policy toward Israel and that the
real struggle is between the
moderates and the extremists
within the camp.
Extreme regimes, like Syria
and Iraq, now re-armed beyond
their earlier levels, are hoping to
use Soviet arms to get a heavy
advantage over Israel and this
time take it by surprise in a
war. This is true also of one fac
tion within Egypt.
The best argument the Arab
moderates can use is that it can't

be done. That Is why a well
equipped Israeli air force and
army to balance the Soviet
equipment of the Arabs are a
powerful argument on the mod
erate side in the Arab camp.
Don't Look For Miracles
Some Americans may point
out the superior fighting power
of the Israeli troops, fliers and
officers and therefore argue that
Israel needs no arms parity
against Soviet re arming of the
Arabs, that the Israelis can win
again with their hands tied be
hind their back.
Success also carries a penalty,
but this reasoning is to penalize
Israel needlessly and foolishly.
The Arab soldier had an unde
servedly bad press. On another
occasion, with a better-prepared
leadership, he will fight better.
It would be folly for American
policy-makers to count on anoth
er Israeli miracle and another.
Missileaneous Problems
There is another danger in too
disparate an arms balance.
Whichever side feels itself
David against a Goliath will be
tempted to arm itself with mis
siles the next time around.
There are already charges and
countercharges about missile
preparation between the two
camps and, while they are prob
ably exaggerated, the great
powers cannot ignore the dan
ger. This only makes the cur
rent peace mission of U.N. Am

bassador Jarring all the more
urgent and a clear, firm Ameri
can policy all the more decisive.
There are those who say that
Arabs and Israelis can never live
side by side without killing each
other. That was once said in Eu
rope about Protestants and Cath
olics. It was said in Europe af
ter World War II about commu
nism and the West. Yet today
each camp has had to learn to
live with the other side as a fact
of life.
The Arabs will have to learn
this fact of life, as the Israelis
already have. The Middle East
cannot remain permanently an
armed jungle, with unnamed
terrors lurking on each side.
Jarring will be useful if he
can suggest to the die-hard Arab
leaders that they don't have to
talk to the Israelis directly.
They can at first talk with them,
through him. In time they will
talk to the Israelis.
In time also, when the success
of a military adventure seems
impossible, the Arabs will profit
from the higher level of Israel's
technology and managerial skills
which can be used for both cul
tures. In time —who knows? —
there may even be that not im
possible Utopia: an Arab-Israeli
common market and perhaps
even a confederal Arab-Israeli
state.

The Johnson-Eshkol meeting,
whatever its other results, was
bound to yield political dividends
to each man in his own country
. But there are long-term fun
damental problems about Mid
east peace and stability that
Americans, along with others,
must face. They will not be re
solved by haggling about how
many planes America will or
will not sell to Israel. It won't
help either Mideast peace or
American national interest to
run a will-they, won't-they guess
ing contest about American mili
tary supplies to Israel.
For the Arab ploy is that, no
matter how completely the
Arabs allow the Soviet Union to
rearm them, America won't dare
function as the chief source of
Israeli arms, for fear of throw
ing the Arabs further into Rus
sia's embrace.
