# SRT Produces Great 'Candaules, Commissioner'
## 
### GORDON H. WICKSTROM 
Stanford Repertory Theatre
has opened its second major
work of the season at the re
furbished Nitery Theatre—the
West Coast premier of Can
dailies, Commissioner by San
Francisco playwright Daniel C.
Gerould. Both the play and the
production are notable successes.

Candaules, Commissioner is
about an Asian war waged by
a country like ours against a
country like Vietnam. Though
the play was directly inspired
by Mr. Gerould's experiences as
one of the American forces in
Korea, the analogies and par
allels most neatly fit what we
know about our position in Viet
nam. As the SRT would say:
This is a "play for today."
We could hope that this play
is only for today. Mr. Gerould
has so deftly laid his finger on
the deepest sources of our na
tional malaise, so exactly in
dicted our national and inter
national intentions, that we can
only hope that the conditions
which make this play live may
quickly, in a week, a month, or
a season, leave it uselessly dated
and obscure. For it must be the
hope of the theatre one day to
see a world so mended in body
and spirit that the conventional
terrors of the theatre will out
strip those of life itself.
Plato and Herodotus
Mr. Gerould turns to the
Greeks for the framework of his
play, which he calls a fable. He
combines a bit of legend from
Plato's Republic about a certain
Gyges who in very mysterious
circumstances discovers a magic
ring that makes its wearer in
visible with some history from
Herodotus about a King of Ly
dia, Candaules by name, who
becomes obsessed with the need
to display his lovely wife Nyssia
stark naked to his servant
Gyges.
Over Gyges' objection, a plot
is laid whereby he will see the
nude queen, but she detects him
in the act and the next day
forces Gyges to choose between
killing Candaules and taking
her as her husband or being
killed himself on the spot.
Gyges chooses the former, be

comes king, and possesses Nys
sia.
Native Chauffer
The shepherd Gyges' descent
into the underworld for the ring
is a symbol of the wiliness of
the subjugated in an unfortun
ate, war-devastated Asian coun
try. Gyges himself is taken out
of his classic, pastoral element
and made a native-boy chauffer.
The ring remains the one su
pernatural form in the play.
Thr> heroic world of the ancient
Candaules and Nyssia is meta
morphosed into the petty exist
ence of a subordinate pacifica
tion officer and his wife in a
country where they are useless
and unwanted.
Using this legendary, mythic
material, Gerould makes his
play even more melancholy. The
implication is that the situation
is not just one of the moment,
but a pattern stamped indel
ibly on human behavior. If we
solve the problem of this mo
ment, it will certainly return
to plague us again. It is pro
grammed into the cultural DNA
of the West.
Infantile Power
I want to return to the role of
the magic ring for a moment.
The symbolism is clear enough
and very useful too. It reminds
us of how unstable, uncertain,
how schixoid is the structure of
human identity, that it does
slip in and out of visibility-real
ity. In retaliation agaist his role
as victim, contemporary man

can sometimes call himself in
and out of being as the occasion
demands. He can consciously
disassociate himself. Candaules,
riding in his car among the na
tives in their degraded and dan
gerous state, can literally re
fuse to see, or react as a living
person: he slips on Gyges' ring
and all its infantile, regressive
power.
Nakedness and clothing are
basic themes. While Candaules
is very reluctant to be without
his own clothes on his back, he
is eager to display his wife's
nakedness. Perhaps that is just
what a bad war is: Indecent Ex
posure. Candaules as "a decent,
liberal bureaucat" (Gerould's
phrase) is reluctant to expose
himself. He senses that, as Cole
ridge said, it is clothing that
separates men from beasts, that
what he feels are his humane
principles are somehow con
nected with keeping his pants
on.
Guilt
But still at a deeper, truer,
more compulsive and erotic
level Candaules is just as guilty,
just as wrong as the generals;
he wants to strip his wife and
put her on display before the
occupied peoples as a man
might want to strip his coun
try in some kind of grotesque
expiation of personal and na
tional guilt—not unconnected
with seventeen years of im
potence—sexual frustration that
he claims willingly to have ac

cepted in order to pursue his
dream of a richer rice harvest
for Lydia.
The rhythm of the play's pes
simism is summed up in the tor
ture theme. Nyssia denounces
it as immoral: then refuses to
believe that it actually happens,
finally requiring more and more
of it to satisfy her perverted
craving for violence.
As the play so well illustrates,
war, for many, is after all no
more than a civic, high-minded,
Fourth of July fireworks dis
play that we watch with de
lighted detachment from com
fortable homes through binocu
lars. (Read T.V.)
Stimulating Production
The production was altogether
as stimulating and excellent as
Gerould's text. William Sharp, a
resident director for SRT has
made the most of every possi
bility. It is not often that one
sees a production invent for it
self so effective and expeditious
a convention and then stick with
it as consistently. Sharp has
taken a clue from the text for
a stage manager-like figure of
the Oriental theatre and de
veloped it into a team of four
men in black coats who manage
the play's setting, props, pro
vide sound effects, a narration
of the Greek stories, and even
reflections in non-existent full
length mirrors. All this came off
very well.
James Lyon's setting was ex
traordinarily effective, hand

some, and efficient. The low
platform framed in three di
mensions by structural steel
provided just the arena that the
play seemed to want.
The lighting by Stephen Maze
was expert and properly compli
mentary to the other elements
of the production. It succeeded
in being decorative as well as
meaningful.
The properties, had that eco
nomic, clean, even elegant Tight
ness about them wnich helped
to clinch the unity of the pro
duction.
Final Nakedness
Sharp's production is so per
suasive that it is difficult to
imagine the play produced in
any other way. The production,
in fact, defines the text. I think
that the final nakedness of Nys
sia at the end of the play, how
ever, docs not work. Nyssia's
standing there is a homely little
slip does not convey what Ger
ould intends: a body "pale and
sickly," a skin of "cadaverous
greenish hue," "her flesh hang
ing loosely from her bones as
though she were dead." And I
doubt that the Nitery with little
distance, aesthetic or otherwise,
could facilitate this coup de
theatre which wants an upstage,
centered, sudden revelation of
an old hag to make the final
comment on war and what it
does to people who wage it.
Elizabeth Huddle is very good
as Nyssia. In every aspect of
her performance, she is eloquent

and moving. She is beautiful on
stage, perhaps most truly beau
tiful when out of her wigs and
makeup. She gave scale and in
tensity of conviction to the pro
duction that was invaluable.
Sheldon Feldner as Candaules
was at his best in scenes with
Miss Huddle. In those scenes he
seemed more responsive to the
dramatic shape of what was
going on.
Mr. Feldner gets off to an ex
tremely good start in the auto
mobile scene, which opens the
play. Working with N.R. David
son as Gyges, Feldner set a
pleasant, easy, graceful tempo
and tone.
Toward the end of the open
ing scene and up to the entrance
of Nyssia in the next, Feldner
weakens with too much same
ness of tempo and tone. Some
of the delays between his and
Davidson's cues allow moments
in the play's emphasis to dissi
pate into an awkward and em
barrassing slowness.
Davidson's Gyges is excellent
all the way and continuously re
vealing. He builds layers of res
onance into his reactions which
are as revealing as his actions.
So then, if local audiences
want something "for today,"
something to think about, may
be worry over, if they want to
see how the production of a play
can be a unified and handsome
work of art; Stanford's Can
daules, Commissioner is for
them.

level Candaules is just as guilty,
just as wrong as the generals;
he wants to strip his wife and
put her on display before the
occupied peoples as a man
might want to strip his coun
try in some kind of grotesque
expiation of personal and na
tional guilt—not unconnected
with seventeen years of im
potence—sexual frustration that
he claims willingly to have ac

cepted in order to pursue his
dream of a richer rice harvest
for Lydia.
The rhythm of the play's pes
simism is summed up in the tor
ture theme. Nyssia denounces
it as immoral: then refuses to
believe that it actually happens,
finally requiring more and more
of it to satisfy her perverted
craving for violence.
As the play so well illustrates,
war, for many, is after all no
more than a civic, high-minded,
Fourth of July fireworks dis
play that we watch with de
lighted detachment from com
fortable homes through binocu
lars. (Read T.V.)
Stimulating Production
The production was altogether
as stimulating and excellent as
Gerould's text. William Sharp, a
resident director for SRT has
made the most of every possi
bility. It is not often that one
sees a production invent for it
self so effective and expeditious
a convention and then stick with
it as consistently. Sharp has
taken a clue from the text for
a stage manager-like figure of
the Oriental theatre and de
veloped it into a team of four
men in black coats who manage
the play's setting, props, pro
vide sound effects, a narration
of the Greek stories, and even
reflections in non-existent full
length mirrors. All this came off
very well.
James Lyon's setting was ex
traordinarily effective, hand

some, and efficient. The low
platform framed in three di
mensions by structural steel
provided just the arena that the
play seemed to want.
The lighting by Stephen Maze
was expert and properly compli
mentary to the other elements
of the production. It succeeded
in being decorative as well as
meaningful.
The properties, had that eco
nomic, clean, even elegant Tight
ness about them wnich helped
to clinch the unity of the pro
duction.
Final Nakedness
Sharp's production is so per
suasive that it is difficult to
imagine the play produced in
any other way. The production,
in fact, defines the text. I think
that the final nakedness of Nys
sia at the end of the play, how
ever, docs not work. Nyssia's
standing there is a homely little
slip does not convey what Ger
ould intends: a body "pale and
sickly," a skin of "cadaverous
greenish hue," "her flesh hang
ing loosely from her bones as
though she were dead." And I
doubt that the Nitery with little
distance, aesthetic or otherwise,
could facilitate this coup de
theatre which wants an upstage,
centered, sudden revelation of
an old hag to make the final
comment on war and what it
does to people who wage it.
Elizabeth Huddle is very good
as Nyssia. In every aspect of
her performance, she is eloquent

and moving. She is beautiful on
stage, perhaps most truly beau
tiful when out of her wigs and
makeup. She gave scale and in
tensity of conviction to the pro
duction that was invaluable.
Sheldon Feldner as Candaules
was at his best in scenes with
Miss Huddle. In those scenes he
seemed more responsive to the
dramatic shape of what was
going on.
Mr. Feldner gets off to an ex
tremely good start in the auto
mobile scene, which opens the
play. Working with N.R. David
son as Gyges, Feldner set a
pleasant, easy, graceful tempo
and tone.
Toward the end of the open
ing scene and up to the entrance
of Nyssia in the next, Feldner
weakens with too much same
ness of tempo and tone. Some
of the delays between his and
Davidson's cues allow moments
in the play's emphasis to dissi
pate into an awkward and em
barrassing slowness.
Davidson's Gyges is excellent
all the way and continuously re
vealing. He builds layers of res
onance into his reactions which
are as revealing as his actions.
So then, if local audiences
want something "for today,"
something to think about, may
be worry over, if they want to
see how the production of a play
can be a unified and handsome
work of art; Stanford's Can
daules, Commissioner is for
them.
Stanford Repertory Theatre
has opened its second major
work of the season at the re
furbished Nitery Theatre—the
West Coast premier of Can
dailies, Commissioner by San
Francisco playwright Daniel C.
Gerould. Both the play and the
production are notable successes.

Candaules, Commissioner is
about an Asian war waged by
a country like ours against a
country like Vietnam. Though
the play was directly inspired
by Mr. Gerould's experiences as
one of the American forces in
Korea, the analogies and par
allels most neatly fit what we
know about our position in Viet
nam. As the SRT would say:
This is a "play for today."
We could hope that this play
is only for today. Mr. Gerould
has so deftly laid his finger on
the deepest sources of our na
tional malaise, so exactly in
dicted our national and inter
national intentions, that we can
only hope that the conditions
which make this play live may
quickly, in a week, a month, or
a season, leave it uselessly dated
and obscure. For it must be the
hope of the theatre one day to
see a world so mended in body
and spirit that the conventional
terrors of the theatre will out
strip those of life itself.
Plato and Herodotus
Mr. Gerould turns to the
Greeks for the framework of his
play, which he calls a fable. He
combines a bit of legend from
Plato's Republic about a certain
Gyges who in very mysterious
circumstances discovers a magic
ring that makes its wearer in
visible with some history from
Herodotus about a King of Ly
dia, Candaules by name, who
becomes obsessed with the need
to display his lovely wife Nyssia
stark naked to his servant
Gyges.
Over Gyges' objection, a plot
is laid whereby he will see the
nude queen, but she detects him
in the act and the next day
forces Gyges to choose between
killing Candaules and taking
her as her husband or being
killed himself on the spot.
Gyges chooses the former, be

comes king, and possesses Nys
sia.
Native Chauffer
The shepherd Gyges' descent
into the underworld for the ring
is a symbol of the wiliness of
the subjugated in an unfortun
ate, war-devastated Asian coun
try. Gyges himself is taken out
of his classic, pastoral element
and made a native-boy chauffer.
The ring remains the one su
pernatural form in the play.
Thr> heroic world of the ancient
Candaules and Nyssia is meta
morphosed into the petty exist
ence of a subordinate pacifica
tion officer and his wife in a
country where they are useless
and unwanted.
Using this legendary, mythic
material, Gerould makes his
play even more melancholy. The
implication is that the situation
is not just one of the moment,
but a pattern stamped indel
ibly on human behavior. If we
solve the problem of this mo
ment, it will certainly return
to plague us again. It is pro
grammed into the cultural DNA
of the West.
Infantile Power
I want to return to the role of
the magic ring for a moment.
The symbolism is clear enough
and very useful too. It reminds
us of how unstable, uncertain,
how schixoid is the structure of
human identity, that it does
slip in and out of visibility-real
ity. In retaliation agaist his role
as victim, contemporary man

can sometimes call himself in
and out of being as the occasion
demands. He can consciously
disassociate himself. Candaules,
riding in his car among the na
tives in their degraded and dan
gerous state, can literally re
fuse to see, or react as a living
person: he slips on Gyges' ring
and all its infantile, regressive
power.
Nakedness and clothing are
basic themes. While Candaules
is very reluctant to be without
his own clothes on his back, he
is eager to display his wife's
nakedness. Perhaps that is just
what a bad war is: Indecent Ex
posure. Candaules as "a decent,
liberal bureaucat" (Gerould's
phrase) is reluctant to expose
himself. He senses that, as Cole
ridge said, it is clothing that
separates men from beasts, that
what he feels are his humane
principles are somehow con
nected with keeping his pants
on.
Guilt
But still at a deeper, truer,
more compulsive and erotic
level Candaules is just as guilty,
just as wrong as the generals;
he wants to strip his wife and
put her on display before the
occupied peoples as a man
might want to strip his coun
try in some kind of grotesque
expiation of personal and na
tional guilt—not unconnected

potence—sexual frustration that

daules, Commissioner is for
them.
Stanford Repertory Theatre
has opened its second major
work of the season at the re
furbished Nitery Theatre—the
West Coast premier of Can
dailies, Commissioner by San
Francisco playwright Daniel C.
Gerould. Both the play and the
production are notable successes.

Candaules, Commissioner is
about an Asian war waged by
a country like ours against a
country like Vietnam. Though
the play was directly inspired
by Mr. Gerould's experiences as
one of the American forces in
Korea, the analogies and par
allels most neatly fit what we
know about our position in Viet
nam. As the SRT would say:
This is a "play for today."
We could hope that this play
is only for today. Mr. Gerould
has so deftly laid his finger on
the deepest sources of our na
tional malaise, so exactly in
dicted our national and inter
national intentions, that we can
only hope that the conditions
which make this play live may
quickly, in a week, a month, or
a season, leave it uselessly dated
and obscure. For it must be the
hope of the theatre one day to
see a world so mended in body
and spirit that the conventional
terrors of the theatre will out
strip those of life itself.
Plato and Herodotus
Mr. Gerould turns to the
Greeks for the framework of his
play, which he calls a fable. He
combines a bit of legend from
Plato's Republic about a certain
Gyges who in very mysterious
circumstances discovers a magic
ring that makes its wearer in
visible with some history from
Herodotus about a King of Ly
dia, Candaules by name, who
becomes obsessed with the need
to display his lovely wife Nyssia
stark naked to his servant
Gyges.
Over Gyges' objection, a plot
is laid whereby he will see the
nude queen, but she detects him
in the act and the next day
forces Gyges to choose between
killing Candaules and taking
her as her husband or being
killed himself on the spot.
Gyges chooses the former, be

comes king, and possesses Nys
sia.
Native Chauffer
The shepherd Gyges' descent
into the underworld for the ring
is a symbol of the wiliness of
the subjugated in an unfortun
ate, war-devastated Asian coun
try. Gyges himself is taken out
of his classic, pastoral element
and made a native-boy chauffer.
The ring remains the one su
pernatural form in the play.
Thr> heroic world of the ancient
Candaules and Nyssia is meta
morphosed into the petty exist
ence of a subordinate pacifica
tion officer and his wife in a
country where they are useless
and unwanted.
Using this legendary, mythic
material, Gerould makes his
play even more melancholy. The
implication is that the situation
is not just one of the moment,
but a pattern stamped indel
ibly on human behavior. If we
solve the problem of this mo
ment, it will certainly return
to plague us again. It is pro
grammed into the cultural DNA
of the West.
Infantile Power
I want to return to the role of
the magic ring for a moment.
The symbolism is clear enough
and very useful too. It reminds
us of how unstable, uncertain,
how schixoid is the structure of
human identity, that it does
slip in and out of visibility-real
ity. In retaliation agaist his role
as victim, contemporary man

can sometimes call himself in
and out of being as the occasion
demands. He can consciously
disassociate himself. Candaules,
riding in his car among the na
tives in their degraded and dan
gerous state, can literally re
fuse to see, or react as a living
person: he slips on Gyges' ring
and all its infantile, regressive
power.
Nakedness and clothing are
basic themes. While Candaules
is very reluctant to be without
his own clothes on his back, he
is eager to display his wife's
nakedness. Perhaps that is just
what a bad war is: Indecent Ex
posure. Candaules as "a decent,
liberal bureaucat" (Gerould's
phrase) is reluctant to expose
himself. He senses that, as Cole
ridge said, it is clothing that
separates men from beasts, that
what he feels are his humane
principles are somehow con
nected with keeping his pants
on.
Guilt
But still at a deeper, truer,
more compulsive and erotic
level Candaules is just as guilty,
just as wrong as the generals;
he wants to strip his wife and
put her on display before the
occupied peoples as a man
might want to strip his coun
try in some kind of grotesque
expiation of personal and na
tional guilt—not unconnected
with seventeen years of im
potence—sexual frustration that
he claims willingly to have ac

cepted in order to pursue his
dream of a richer rice harvest
for Lydia.
The rhythm of the play's pes
simism is summed up in the tor
ture theme. Nyssia denounces
it as immoral: then refuses to
believe that it actually happens,
finally requiring more and more
of it to satisfy her perverted
craving for violence.
As the play so well illustrates,
war, for many, is after all no
more than a civic, high-minded,
Fourth of July fireworks dis
play that we watch with de
lighted detachment from com
fortable homes through binocu
lars. (Read T.V.)
Stimulating Production
The production was altogether
as stimulating and excellent as
Gerould's text. William Sharp, a
resident director for SRT has
made the most of every possi
bility. It is not often that one
sees a production invent for it
self so effective and expeditious
a convention and then stick with
it as consistently. Sharp has
taken a clue from the text for
a stage manager-like figure of
the Oriental theatre and de
veloped it into a team of four
men in black coats who manage
the play's setting, props, pro
vide sound effects, a narration
of the Greek stories, and even
reflections in non-existent full
length mirrors. All this came off
very well.
James Lyon's setting was ex
traordinarily effective, hand

some, and efficient. The low
platform framed in three di
mensions by structural steel
provided just the arena that the
play seemed to want.
The lighting by Stephen Maze
was expert and properly compli
mentary to the other elements
of the production. It succeeded
in being decorative as well as
meaningful.
The properties, had that eco
nomic, clean, even elegant Tight
ness about them wnich helped
to clinch the unity of the pro
duction.
Final Nakedness
Sharp's production is so per
suasive that it is difficult to
imagine the play produced in
any other way. The production,
in fact, defines the text. I think
that the final nakedness of Nys
sia at the end of the play, how
ever, docs not work. Nyssia's
standing there is a homely little
slip does not convey what Ger
ould intends: a body "pale and
sickly," a skin of "cadaverous
greenish hue," "her flesh hang
ing loosely from her bones as
though she were dead." And I
doubt that the Nitery with little
distance, aesthetic or otherwise,
could facilitate this coup de
theatre which wants an upstage,
centered, sudden revelation of
an old hag to make the final
comment on war and what it
does to people who wage it.
Elizabeth Huddle is very good
as Nyssia. In every aspect of
her performance, she is eloquent

and moving. She is beautiful on
stage, perhaps most truly beau
tiful when out of her wigs and
makeup. She gave scale and in
tensity of conviction to the pro
duction that was invaluable.
Sheldon Feldner as Candaules
was at his best in scenes with
Miss Huddle. In those scenes he
seemed more responsive to the
dramatic shape of what was
going on.
Mr. Feldner gets off to an ex
tremely good start in the auto
mobile scene, which opens the
play. Working with N.R. David
son as Gyges, Feldner set a
pleasant, easy, graceful tempo
and tone.
Toward the end of the open
ing scene and up to the entrance
of Nyssia in the next, Feldner
weakens with too much same
ness of tempo and tone. Some
of the delays between his and
Davidson's cues allow moments
in the play's emphasis to dissi
pate into an awkward and em
barrassing slowness.
Davidson's Gyges is excellent
all the way and continuously re
vealing. He builds layers of res
onance into his reactions which
are as revealing as his actions.
So then, if local audiences
want something "for today,"
something to think about, may
be worry over, if they want to
see how the production of a play
can be a unified and handsome
work of art; Stanford's Can
daules, Commissioner is for
them.

level Candaules is just as guilty,
just as wrong as the generals;
he wants to strip his wife and
put her on display before the
occupied peoples as a man
might want to strip his coun
try in some kind of grotesque
expiation of personal and na
tional guilt—not unconnected
with seventeen years of im
potence—sexual frustration that
he claims willingly to have ac

cepted in order to pursue his
dream of a richer rice harvest
for Lydia.
The rhythm of the play's pes
simism is summed up in the tor
ture theme. Nyssia denounces
it as immoral: then refuses to
believe that it actually happens,
finally requiring more and more
of it to satisfy her perverted
craving for violence.
As the play so well illustrates,
war, for many, is after all no
more than a civic, high-minded,
Fourth of July fireworks dis
play that we watch with de
lighted detachment from com
fortable homes through binocu
lars. (Read T.V.)
Stimulating Production
The production was altogether
as stimulating and excellent as
Gerould's text. William Sharp, a
resident director for SRT has
made the most of every possi
bility. It is not often that one
sees a production invent for it
self so effective and expeditious
a convention and then stick with
it as consistently. Sharp has
taken a clue from the text for
a stage manager-like figure of
the Oriental theatre and de
veloped it into a team of four
men in black coats who manage
the play's setting, props, pro
vide sound effects, a narration
of the Greek stories, and even
reflections in non-existent full
length mirrors. All this came off
very well.
James Lyon's setting was ex
traordinarily effective, hand

some, and efficient. The low
platform framed in three di
mensions by structural steel
provided just the arena that the
play seemed to want.
The lighting by Stephen Maze
was expert and properly compli
mentary to the other elements
of the production. It succeeded
in being decorative as well as
meaningful.
The properties, had that eco
nomic, clean, even elegant Tight
ness about them wnich helped
to clinch the unity of the pro
duction.
Final Nakedness
Sharp's production is so per
suasive that it is difficult to
imagine the play produced in
any other way. The production,
in fact, defines the text. I think
that the final nakedness of Nys
sia at the end of the play, how
ever, docs not work. Nyssia's
standing there is a homely little
slip does not convey what Ger
ould intends: a body "pale and
sickly," a skin of "cadaverous
greenish hue," "her flesh hang
ing loosely from her bones as
though she were dead." And I
doubt that the Nitery with little
distance, aesthetic or otherwise,
could facilitate this coup de
theatre which wants an upstage,
centered, sudden revelation of
an old hag to make the final
comment on war and what it
does to people who wage it.
Elizabeth Huddle is very good
as Nyssia. In every aspect of
her performance, she is eloquent

and moving. She is beautiful on
stage, perhaps most truly beau
tiful when out of her wigs and
makeup. She gave scale and in
tensity of conviction to the pro
duction that was invaluable.
Sheldon Feldner as Candaules
was at his best in scenes with
Miss Huddle. In those scenes he
seemed more responsive to the
dramatic shape of what was
going on.
Mr. Feldner gets off to an ex
tremely good start in the auto
mobile scene, which opens the
play. Working with N.R. David
son as Gyges, Feldner set a
pleasant, easy, graceful tempo
and tone.
Toward the end of the open
ing scene and up to the entrance
of Nyssia in the next, Feldner
weakens with too much same
ness of tempo and tone. Some
of the delays between his and
Davidson's cues allow moments
in the play's emphasis to dissi
pate into an awkward and em
barrassing slowness.
Davidson's Gyges is excellent
all the way and continuously re
vealing. He builds layers of res
onance into his reactions which
are as revealing as his actions.
So then, if local audiences
want something "for today,"
something to think about, may
be worry over, if they want to
see how the production of a play
can be a unified and handsome
work of art; Stanford's Can
daules, Commissioner is for
them.
Stanford Repertory Theatre
has opened its second major
work of the season at the re
furbished Nitery Theatre—the
West Coast premier of Can
dailies, Commissioner by San
Francisco playwright Daniel C.
Gerould. Both the play and the
production are notable successes.

Candaules, Commissioner is
about an Asian war waged by
a country like ours against a
country like Vietnam. Though
the play was directly inspired
by Mr. Gerould's experiences as
one of the American forces in
Korea, the analogies and par
allels most neatly fit what we
know about our position in Viet
nam. As the SRT would say:
This is a "play for today."
We could hope that this play
is only for today. Mr. Gerould
has so deftly laid his finger on
the deepest sources of our na
tional malaise, so exactly in
dicted our national and inter
national intentions, that we can
only hope that the conditions
which make this play live may
quickly, in a week, a month, or
a season, leave it uselessly dated
and obscure. For it must be the
hope of the theatre one day to
see a world so mended in body
and spirit that the conventional
terrors of the theatre will out
strip those of life itself.
Plato and Herodotus
Mr. Gerould turns to the
Greeks for the framework of his
play, which he calls a fable. He
combines a bit of legend from
Plato's Republic about a certain
Gyges who in very mysterious
circumstances discovers a magic
ring that makes its wearer in
visible with some history from
Herodotus about a King of Ly
dia, Candaules by name, who
becomes obsessed with the need
to display his lovely wife Nyssia
stark naked to his servant
Gyges.
Over Gyges' objection, a plot
is laid whereby he will see the
nude queen, but she detects him
in the act and the next day
forces Gyges to choose between
killing Candaules and taking
her as her husband or being
killed himself on the spot.
Gyges chooses the former, be

comes king, and possesses Nys
sia.
Native Chauffer
The shepherd Gyges' descent
into the underworld for the ring
is a symbol of the wiliness of
the subjugated in an unfortun
ate, war-devastated Asian coun
try. Gyges himself is taken out
of his classic, pastoral element
and made a native-boy chauffer.
The ring remains the one su
pernatural form in the play.
Thr> heroic world of the ancient
Candaules and Nyssia is meta
morphosed into the petty exist
ence of a subordinate pacifica
tion officer and his wife in a
country where they are useless
and unwanted.
Using this legendary, mythic
material, Gerould makes his
play even more melancholy. The
implication is that the situation
is not just one of the moment,
but a pattern stamped indel
ibly on human behavior. If we
solve the problem of this mo
ment, it will certainly return
to plague us again. It is pro
grammed into the cultural DNA
of the West.
Infantile Power
I want to return to the role of
the magic ring for a moment.
The symbolism is clear enough
and very useful too. It reminds
us of how unstable, uncertain,
how schixoid is the structure of
human identity, that it does
slip in and out of visibility-real
ity. In retaliation agaist his role
as victim, contemporary man

can sometimes call himself in
and out of being as the occasion
demands. He can consciously
disassociate himself. Candaules,
riding in his car among the na
tives in their degraded and dan
gerous state, can literally re
fuse to see, or react as a living
person: he slips on Gyges' ring
and all its infantile, regressive
power.
Nakedness and clothing are
basic themes. While Candaules
is very reluctant to be without
his own clothes on his back, he
is eager to display his wife's
nakedness. Perhaps that is just
what a bad war is: Indecent Ex
posure. Candaules as "a decent,
liberal bureaucat" (Gerould's
phrase) is reluctant to expose
himself. He senses that, as Cole
ridge said, it is clothing that
separates men from beasts, that
what he feels are his humane
principles are somehow con
nected with keeping his pants
on.
Guilt
But still at a deeper, truer,
more compulsive and erotic
level Candaules is just as guilty,
just as wrong as the generals;
he wants to strip his wife and
put her on display before the
occupied peoples as a man
might want to strip his coun
try in some kind of grotesque
expiation of personal and na
tional guilt—not unconnected

potence—sexual frustration that

daules, Commissioner is for
them.
Stanford Repertory Theatre
has opened its second major
work of the season at the re
furbished Nitery Theatre—the
West Coast premier of Can
dailies, Commissioner by San
Francisco playwright Daniel C.
Gerould. Both the play and the
production are notable successes.

Candaules, Commissioner is
about an Asian war waged by
a country like ours against a
country like Vietnam. Though
the play was directly inspired
by Mr. Gerould's experiences as
one of the American forces in
Korea, the analogies and par
allels most neatly fit what we
know about our position in Viet
nam. As the SRT would say:
This is a "play for today."
We could hope that this play
is only for today. Mr. Gerould
has so deftly laid his finger on
the deepest sources of our na
tional malaise, so exactly in
dicted our national and inter
national intentions, that we can
only hope that the conditions
which make this play live may
quickly, in a week, a month, or
a season, leave it uselessly dated
and obscure. For it must be the
hope of the theatre one day to
see a world so mended in body
and spirit that the conventional
terrors of the theatre will out
strip those of life itself.
Plato and Herodotus
Mr. Gerould turns to the
Greeks for the framework of his
play, which he calls a fable. He
combines a bit of legend from
Plato's Republic about a certain
Gyges who in very mysterious
circumstances discovers a magic
ring that makes its wearer in
visible with some history from
Herodotus about a King of Ly
dia, Candaules by name, who
becomes obsessed with the need
to display his lovely wife Nyssia
stark naked to his servant
Gyges.
Over Gyges' objection, a plot
is laid whereby he will see the
nude queen, but she detects him
in the act and the next day
forces Gyges to choose between
killing Candaules and taking
her as her husband or being
killed himself on the spot.
Gyges chooses the former, be

comes king, and possesses Nys
sia.
Native Chauffer
The shepherd Gyges' descent
into the underworld for the ring
is a symbol of the wiliness of
the subjugated in an unfortun
ate, war-devastated Asian coun
try. Gyges himself is taken out
of his classic, pastoral element
and made a native-boy chauffer.
The ring remains the one su
pernatural form in the play.
Thr> heroic world of the ancient
Candaules and Nyssia is meta
morphosed into the petty exist
ence of a subordinate pacifica
tion officer and his wife in a
country where they are useless
and unwanted.
Using this legendary, mythic
material, Gerould makes his
play even more melancholy. The
implication is that the situation
is not just one of the moment,
but a pattern stamped indel
ibly on human behavior. If we
solve the problem of this mo
ment, it will certainly return
to plague us again. It is pro
grammed into the cultural DNA
of the West.
Infantile Power
I want to return to the role of
the magic ring for a moment.
The symbolism is clear enough
and very useful too. It reminds
us of how unstable, uncertain,
how schixoid is the structure of
human identity, that it does
slip in and out of visibility-real
ity. In retaliation agaist his role
as victim, contemporary man

can sometimes call himself in
and out of being as the occasion
demands. He can consciously
disassociate himself. Candaules,
riding in his car among the na
tives in their degraded and dan
gerous state, can literally re
fuse to see, or react as a living
person: he slips on Gyges' ring
and all its infantile, regressive
power.
Nakedness and clothing are
basic themes. While Candaules
is very reluctant to be without
his own clothes on his back, he
is eager to display his wife's
nakedness. Perhaps that is just
what a bad war is: Indecent Ex
posure. Candaules as "a decent,
liberal bureaucat" (Gerould's
phrase) is reluctant to expose
himself. He senses that, as Cole
ridge said, it is clothing that
separates men from beasts, that
what he feels are his humane
principles are somehow con
nected with keeping his pants
on.
Guilt
But still at a deeper, truer,
more compulsive and erotic
level Candaules is just as guilty,
just as wrong as the generals;
he wants to strip his wife and
put her on display before the
occupied peoples as a man
might want to strip his coun
try in some kind of grotesque
expiation of personal and na
tional guilt—not unconnected
with seventeen years of im
potence—sexual frustration that
he claims willingly to have ac

cepted in order to pursue his
dream of a richer rice harvest
for Lydia.
The rhythm of the play's pes
simism is summed up in the tor
ture theme. Nyssia denounces
it as immoral: then refuses to
believe that it actually happens,
finally requiring more and more
of it to satisfy her perverted
craving for violence.
As the play so well illustrates,
war, for many, is after all no
more than a civic, high-minded,
Fourth of July fireworks dis
play that we watch with de
lighted detachment from com
fortable homes through binocu
lars. (Read T.V.)
Stimulating Production
The production was altogether
as stimulating and excellent as
Gerould's text. William Sharp, a
resident director for SRT has
made the most of every possi
bility. It is not often that one
sees a production invent for it
self so effective and expeditious
a convention and then stick with
it as consistently. Sharp has
taken a clue from the text for
a stage manager-like figure of
the Oriental theatre and de
veloped it into a team of four
men in black coats who manage
the play's setting, props, pro
vide sound effects, a narration
of the Greek stories, and even
reflections in non-existent full
length mirrors. All this came off
very well.
James Lyon's setting was ex
traordinarily effective, hand

some, and efficient. The low
platform framed in three di
mensions by structural steel
provided just the arena that the
play seemed to want.
The lighting by Stephen Maze
was expert and properly compli
mentary to the other elements
of the production. It succeeded
in being decorative as well as
meaningful.
The properties, had that eco
nomic, clean, even elegant Tight
ness about them wnich helped
to clinch the unity of the pro
duction.
Final Nakedness
Sharp's production is so per
suasive that it is difficult to
imagine the play produced in
any other way. The production,
in fact, defines the text. I think
that the final nakedness of Nys
sia at the end of the play, how
ever, docs not work. Nyssia's
standing there is a homely little
slip does not convey what Ger
ould intends: a body "pale and
sickly," a skin of "cadaverous
greenish hue," "her flesh hang
ing loosely from her bones as
though she were dead." And I
doubt that the Nitery with little
distance, aesthetic or otherwise,
could facilitate this coup de
theatre which wants an upstage,
centered, sudden revelation of
an old hag to make the final
comment on war and what it
does to people who wage it.
Elizabeth Huddle is very good
as Nyssia. In every aspect of
her performance, she is eloquent

and moving. She is beautiful on
stage, perhaps most truly beau
tiful when out of her wigs and
makeup. She gave scale and in
tensity of conviction to the pro
duction that was invaluable.
Sheldon Feldner as Candaules
was at his best in scenes with
Miss Huddle. In those scenes he
seemed more responsive to the
dramatic shape of what was
going on.
Mr. Feldner gets off to an ex
tremely good start in the auto
mobile scene, which opens the
play. Working with N.R. David
son as Gyges, Feldner set a
pleasant, easy, graceful tempo
and tone.
Toward the end of the open
ing scene and up to the entrance
of Nyssia in the next, Feldner
weakens with too much same
ness of tempo and tone. Some
of the delays between his and
Davidson's cues allow moments
in the play's emphasis to dissi
pate into an awkward and em
barrassing slowness.
Davidson's Gyges is excellent
all the way and continuously re
vealing. He builds layers of res
onance into his reactions which
are as revealing as his actions.
So then, if local audiences
want something "for today,"
something to think about, may
be worry over, if they want to
see how the production of a play
can be a unified and handsome
work of art; Stanford's Can
daules, Commissioner is for
them.
