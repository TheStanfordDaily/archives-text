# 'Crisis Week' Ahead
## Britain May Cancel Fill 
### 
LONDON (AP) — Prime Min
ister Harold Wilson's govern
ment was reported ready Sun
day night to cancel a billion-dol
lar order for 50 American Fill
bombers. But sources said De
fense Secretary Denis Healey
was still fighting to save the con
tract.
A tentative decision to drop
the controversial swing-wing
jets goes up for final cabinet ap
proval Monday as part of an all
out economy drive to shore up
the pound and restore British
solvency.
It will be a critical week for
Wilson's three-year Labor ad
ministration, which has suffered
at the polls in recent months.
Proposed spending cutbacks
threaten the nation's alliances
abroad and social programs at
home.
The cabinet is considering
massive retrenchments that
would divert a billion pounds—
$2.4 billion —of productive re
sources to Britain's export in
dustries by 1971.
Government authorities and
businessmen agree generally
that by about April it should be
evident whether the new pro

gram can pull Britain out of the
red into a new era of stability.
The British were told last
week they could have 10 years
to pay for the Fills and would
be given rights to pick up U.S.
arms orders in order to earn the
dollars to offset their foreign ex
change costs.
The Americans were reported
to have advised Healey private
ly that Britain's order for the
swing-wing strike bomber could
be cut from 50 to 40 without re
negotiating the basic contract.
The issue will be resolved
Monday when the Cabinet also
will be adopting a new defense
policy surrendering Britain's
century-old system of bases in
the Middle East and Asia — al
though Hong Kong will remain
a notable exception.
Specifically, the Wilson gov
ernment has resolved to pull
troops and airmen out of bases
in Malaysia and Singapore in
Southeast Asia, and Bahrain and
Sharjeah in the Persian Gulf by
1971—four years ahead of a ter
minal date which had been fixed
only last July.
The Labor government's re
treat into a "Fortress Britain"

defense posture allows for the
maintenance of such outposts as
the Rhine Army in Europe and
Cyprus in the east Mediterra
nean. But West Germany is to
be warned it must cover the
deutschmark costs of the Rhine
Army or risk seeing its with
drawal too.
These defense cuts were de
cided upon as part of the price

Wilson's men knew they would
have to pay their own party fol
lowers for a wholesale retrench
ment of social spending at
home. The cuts on the domestic
front will affect the education
program, road building, social
service benefits including re
newed charges for Medicine now
available free under the state
health service.
