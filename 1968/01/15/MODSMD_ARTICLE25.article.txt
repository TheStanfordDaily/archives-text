# Powell Skips Stanford Talk
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Adam Clayton Powell hastily
scheduled a speech at Stanford
Friday, but abruptly cancelled it
only an hour before his sched
uled appearance because he
"didn't feel up to it."
Earlier Friday a crowd of
7,000 at Berkeley heard the for
mer New York Congressman
urge white students to join the
black revolution.

Throughout his week - long
California visit Powell called for
a coalition of college students
and Black Power to cure the
"sick" American society.
The confused sequence of
exents surrounding Powell's
abortive Stanford visit began
with an Associated Press report
Jan. 8 that his California tour
would include a talk at Stanford
along with visits to University
of California campuses at Los

Angeles, San Diego, Berkeley,
and San Francisco.
Inquiries revealed that the
Stanford Black Student Union
(BSU) had telegraphed Powell
Jan. 5 with an invitation to
speak on campus later in the
year as a part of a proposed
Black Power program.
Powell apparently took this as
an invitation to include a visit
to Stanford in his current six
day tour.
No official confirmation of a
Powell visit to Stanford was
forthcoming. Neither BSU co
chairman Charles Countee nor
Tresidder program division offi
cials, co-sponsors of the pro
posed speech, heard from Powell
or his aides during the week. A
talk was scheduled Friday, Jan.
15 and Memorial Auditorium re
served on the basis of uncon
firmed press reports.
The official word that Powell
would appear on campus did not
come until 7 a.m. the day of the
speech, when Countee received a
call from Terry Francois, mem
ber of San Francisco Board of
Supervisors, and organizer of

Powell's Bay Area tour. Fran
cois said that Powell would defi
nitely speak on campus at 4:15
that afternoon.
Word that Powell would not
appear did not reach Countee
until 3:15, an hour before the
talk, when a Powell aide called
to say that Powell was sick and
could not come. A 3 p.m. talk at
San Francisco State was also
cancelled.
A student involved in prepar
ing the visit doubted that Powell
was too sick to speak. "He just
didn't feel like it,"he said. The
New York Times reported that
Powell was "tired."
Other reports indicated that
Powell was paid a fee for his
speaking engagement at Berke
ley, but was to receive nothing
for talks at Stanford and San
Francisco State.
Powell recovered sufficiently
by Saturday to tape two televi
sion shows, including the nation
al network Face the Nation pro
gram and a local talk show. He
was also scheduled yesterday to
give a sermon at a San Francis
co Baptist Church.
