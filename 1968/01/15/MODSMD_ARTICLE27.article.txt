President Johnson's measures
to control the outflow of gold
will probably not affect Stan
ford's overseas campuses.
Assistant to the Director of
Overseas Campuses George
Hamrdla pointed out that no one
knows exactly what legislation
might come from the Presi
dent's proposal at the beginning
of this month.
"But I'm almost certain it
won't have any effect on our
program," Hamrdla said.
The Overseas Campuses Of
fice refused to release figures
on how much it spends because
of the secrecy policy practiced
with regard to items of the uni
versity budget.
Most Expensive
But The Daily estimated that
at least $500,000 was spent each
quarter to run the five overseas
campuses for undergraduates.
The program is said to be the
most expensive of all the sev
eral Stanford programs for
graduate and undergraduate
study abroad.
Professor Lorie Tarshis, head
of the department of economics,
commented about any laws the
government might pass to re
strict foreign travel, "I doubt
if they would affect the over
seas campuses. There would be
some sort of exemption for edu
cational travel."
But Tarshis went on to say

he thought the gold outflow was
"a phony problem." "There is
simply no reason for concern,"
he said.
Tarshis stated that in his opin
ion the possible controls on trav
el were "a thoroughly bad idea."
If there were reason for con
cern over gold outflow, he said,
he could think of "far better
ways of tackling the problem."
"Mine may be a rather un
popular view right now," Tar
shis admitted, "but there are
other economists who agree
with me."
Hamrdla said, "at the moment
we don't anticipate any change
of any sort in our program. The
chances are that any sort of
legislation will apply only to
normal travelers, and not to stu
dents, as we see it."
Keeps In Touch
He said his office was "in
touch with Washington" to let
the administration know what
Stanford's interests were in the
foreign travel ban proposal and
to learn what form the proposal
might take.
Hamrdla pointed out, "Not far
from 150 other universities in
America also have programs of
one sort or another that involve
student's going overseas."
He stated that many of the
universities that have foreign
programs would strenuously ob
ject if the government inter
fered in their activities in order
to restrict the outflow of gold.

he thought the gold outflow was
"a phony problem." "There is
simply no reason for concern,"
he said.
Tarshis stated that in his opin
ion the possible controls on trav
el were "a thoroughly bad idea."
If there were reason for con
cern over gold outflow, he said,
he could think of "far better
ways of tackling the problem."
"Mine may be a rather un
popular view right now," Tar
shis admitted, "but there are
other economists who agree
with me."
Hamrdla said, "at the moment
we don't anticipate any change
of any sort in our program. The
chances are that any sort of
legislation will apply only to
normal travelers, and not to stu
dents, as we see it."
Keeps In Touch
He said his office was "in
touch with Washington" to let
the administration know what
Stanford's interests were in the
foreign travel ban proposal and
to learn what form the proposal
might take.
Hamrdla pointed out, "Not far
from 150 other universities in
America also have programs of
one sort or another that involve
student's going overseas."
He stated that many of the
universities that have foreign
programs would strenuously ob
ject if the government inter
fered in their activities in order
to restrict the outflow of gold.
President Johnson's measures
to control the outflow of gold
will probably not affect Stan
ford's overseas campuses.
Assistant to the Director of
Overseas Campuses George
Hamrdla pointed out that no one
knows exactly what legislation
might come from the Presi
dent's proposal at the beginning
of this month.
"But I'm almost certain it
won't have any effect on our
program," Hamrdla said.
The Overseas Campuses Of
fice refused to release figures
on how much it spends because
of the secrecy policy practiced
with regard to items of the uni

Most Expensive
But The Daily estimated that
at least $500,000 was spent each
quarter to run the five overseas
campuses for undergraduates.
The program is said to be the
most expensive of all the sev
eral Stanford programs for
graduate and undergraduate
study abroad.
Professor Lorie Tarshis, head
of the department of economics,
commented about any laws the
government might pass to re
strict foreign travel, "I doubt
if they would affect the over
seas campuses. There would be
some sort of exemption for edu
cational travel."
