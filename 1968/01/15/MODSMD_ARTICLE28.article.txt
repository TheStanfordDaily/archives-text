# Congress' New Year
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Con
gress starts its 1968 session at
noon today facing the same vex
ing problems — taxes, inflation,
deficits and the Vietnam war—
that haunted it through 1967.
Adding heat to the cauldron of
controversy is the fact that this
is an election year. A little more
than the normal politics as usual
will enter into consideration of
bills likely to be issues in poli
tical campaigns.
This will be especially true in
the House, where all 435 seats
will be at stake in November.
Only 34 of the 100 Senate seats
will be on the line, but several
Senators are available for high
er things, such as a presidential
or a vice presidential nomina
tion.
GOP Optimistic
The House starts the year
with 245 Democrats, 187 Repub
licans and 3 Democratic vacan
cies. The Senate opens with 64
Democrats and 36 Republicans.
Republicans are optimistic over
their chances of picking up the
31 seats needed for control of
the 1969 House. It would take a
landslide to give them the 15 ex
tra Senate seats needed for con
trol of that body.
No major legislation is likely
to be considered during the first
month of the sessions, although
some bills left over from 1967
are ready for debate.
The lawmakers will wait for
three major presidential mes
sages before settling down to
business. These messages will
blueprint what the President
wants in the way of legislation
and appropriations and will out
line the economic state of the
government.
The first, the annual State-of

the-Union message, is scheduled
for delivery to a joint session
Wednesday night. Two others,
the budget message and the eco
nomic report, are to reach Con
gress late this month. Others
will follow as the session pro
gresses.
Johnson's Plans Unknown
There has been no official dis
closure of what President John
son will ask Congress to do. But
unofficial reports are that he will
renew his requests for a tax In
crease, gun-control legislation,
an anti-crime bill, continuation
of the war on poverty and other
"Great Society" programs, addi
tional aid for education and
health, consumer protection and
a head tax on Americans travel

ing to certain designated foreign
countries.
Because of the government's
tight financial condition—a defi
cit of around $20 billion in sight
this year—the President is not
expected to request any new ma
jor costly domestic programs.
His budget reportedly will call
for federal spending of close to
$200 billion during the fisca)
year starting July 1, of which
an estimated $77 billion would be
for the Defense Department.
Ask Surcharge Again
To help offset increased
spending and to hold down the
budget, the President will renew
his plea for a 10 per cent income
tax surcharge.
The House Ways and Means
Committee refused to consider
the proposal last year because it
didn't think the President was
doing enough budget-cutting.
The committee has decided to
reconsider its earlier decisior
and will take another look a'
tax legislation later this month

Ask Surcharge Again
To help offset increased
spending and to hold down the
budget, the President will renew
his plea for a 10 per cent income
tax surcharge.
The House Ways and Means
Committee refused to consider
the proposal last year because it
didn't think the President was
doing enough budget-cutting.
The committee has decided to
reconsider its earlier decisior
and will take another look a'
tax legislation later this month
WASHINGTON (AP) — Con
gress starts its 1968 session at
noon today facing the same vex
ing problems — taxes, inflation,
deficits and the Vietnam war—
that haunted it through 1967.
Adding heat to the cauldron of
controversy is the fact that this
is an election year. A little more
than the normal politics as usual
will enter into consideration of
bills likely to be issues in poli
tical campaigns.
This will be especially true in
the House, where all 435 seats
will be at stake in November.
Only 34 of the 100 Senate seats
will be on the line, but several
Senators are available for high
er things, such as a presidential
or a vice presidential nomina
tion.
GOP Optimistic
The House starts the year
with 245 Democrats, 187 Repub
licans and 3 Democratic vacan
cies. The Senate opens with 64
Democrats and 36 Republicans.
Republicans are optimistic over
their chances of picking up the
31 seats needed for control of
the 1969 House. It would take a
landslide to give them the 15 ex
tra Senate seats needed for con
trol of that body.
No major legislation is likely
to be considered during the first
month of the sessions, although
some bills left over from 1967
are ready for debate.
The lawmakers will wait for
three major presidential mes
sages before settling down to
business. These messages will
blueprint what the President
wants in the way of legislation
and appropriations and will out
line the economic state of the
government.
The first, the annual State-of

the-Union message, is scheduled
for delivery to a joint session
Wednesday night. Two others,
the budget message and the eco
nomic report, are to reach Con
gress late this month. Others
will follow as the session pro
gresses.
Johnson's Plans Unknown
There has been no official dis
closure of what President John
son will ask Congress to do. But
unofficial reports are that he will
renew his requests for a tax In
crease, gun-control legislation,
an anti-crime bill, continuation
of the war on poverty and other
"Great Society" programs, addi
tional aid for education and
health, consumer protection and
a head tax on Americans travel

ing to certain designated foreign
countries.
Because of the government's
tight financial condition—a defi
cit of around $20 billion in sight
this year—the President is not
expected to request any new ma
jor costly domestic programs.
His budget reportedly will call
for federal spending of close to
$200 billion during the fisca)
year starting July 1, of which
an estimated $77 billion would be
for the Defense Department.
