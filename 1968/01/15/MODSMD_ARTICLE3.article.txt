Stanford surgeons removed
the gall bladder of heart trans
plant patient Mike Kasperak
yesterday morning in an effort
to alleviate a failing liver con
dition. His heart remains in
good condition.
It was just one week ago Sat
urday that Kasperak received
the heart of Mrs. Virginia Mae
White, a Santa Clara housewife,
in the fourth heart transplant
in history.
Yesterday after doctors de
termined that the liver was not
being drained by the ducts to
carry away the accumulated
bile, they operated to clear the
ducts so that the liver could
function.
Dr. Roy B. Cohn, the surgeon
who performed the operation,
said in a news conference yes
terday if the ducts are "com
pletely blocked, his liver will
fail immediately."
From a biopsy taken on a

small piece of tissue from the
liver, Dr. Leroy Pesch, liver ex
pert and Professor of Medicine
said that he determined that
Kasperak had a "long time liver
difficulty with acute changes."
He explained that the gall
bladder was enlarged and that
some liver cells had died.
Whether or not the liver will
now function normally depends
on the damage to the liver cells.
Surgeons placed a tube in the
bile ducts to keep it open so
that the bile flow will be smooth.
Saturday, Kasperak received
an 80 percent blood exchange in
order to remove impurities in
his blood.
The retire*}' steel worker, now
living in East Palo Alto, was
considered in satisfactory con
dition aftST the transplant but
internal bleeding from the stom
ach and intestine, kidney, liver,
and gall bladder trouble have
worsened his condition.
