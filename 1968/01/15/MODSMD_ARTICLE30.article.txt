SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€”
Douglas Smith, president of the
striking Mailers Union, asked
San Francisco newspaper pub
lishers Sunday to take a direct
part in contract negotiations to
end a nine-day-old strike.
"We urgently request your
personal participation in nego
tiations to restore newspapers to
a news-hungry public," Smith
wired Charles de Young Theriot,
publisher of the Chronicle and
Charles Gould, publisher of the
Examiner.
"A year's attempt to negotiate
with your subordinates has pro
duced nothing but this disas
trous experience of a newspaper
blackout, the wire continued.
"We are ready to return to the
negotiating table at any hour of
the day or night."
The papers were struck Jan.
5.
Smith's wire said: "The San
Francisco newspaper shutdown
is causing inestimable harm to
the merchants and residents of
the city."
The Mailers Union contracts
with the Oakland Tribune and
the San Jose Mercury and News
also have expired.
Smith has obtained strike
sanction from the Alameda
County Labor Council for action
against the Tribune, and he said
he will seek the same sanction
against the Mercury and News
from the Santa Clara County
Labor Council Monday night.
