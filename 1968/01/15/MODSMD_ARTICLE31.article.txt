MIAMI, Fla. (AP) — Don
Chandler kicked four field goals
as Bart Starr led the battle- tes
ted Green Bay Packers to a
33-14 victory over the Oakland
Raiders Sunday in the second
Super Bowl football game.
( A sellout crowd of 74,546
watched in 64-degree tempera
ture at the Orange Bowl while
Vince Lombardi's National Foot
ball League champions took
charge of the underdogs from

the American Football League.
Green Bay scored the first
three times it had its hands on
the ball and rolled over Oak
land's eleven angry men just
as they had beaten back the
challenge of the Kansas City
Chiefs last year 35-10 in Los
Angeles.
Starr, the man who won the
NFL title for the Packers by
sneaking home in the final 13
seconds against Dallas on New

Year's Eve, did a brilliant job
of directing the Packer offense.
Although Starr has had better
days passing, he was superb
during a third period march
that was climaxed by Donny
Anderson's two-yard touchdown
run.
The 82-yard drive that actu
ally put the game beyond reach
saw Starr completing a 35-yard
pass to Max McGee on a third
and-one situation, hitting Car
roll Dale for 11 yards on a third
and-nine play and connecting
with Anderson for 12 yards on
a second and-ten call.
The Packer's strong defense
kept Daryle Lamonica under
control most of the afternoon
although the Raiders' young
quarterback did hit Bill Miller
with two touchdown passes.
Lombardi Praises
"They're a great football
team," Lombardi said of the
Raiders, "and they played well.
"I'm real grateful. We've got
a great bunch of boys, and they
played well. They deserve the
victory."
In pregame speculations,
much had been made of the
possibility of George Blanda's
kicking swinging the issue to
the Raiders, but it was Chand
ler, the 33-year-old Packer, who
did the job.
The former New York Giant
place kicker kicked four field
goals at distances of 39, 20, 43
and 31 yards while the 40-year
old Blanda missed on one futile
try from the 47.

Starr, who left the game in
the fourth period suffering from
a jommed thumb, caught Boyd
Dowler with a beautifully
thrown pass for a 62-yard touch
down play in the second period.
For his performance, he was
voted the outstanding player of
the game and given a sports
car.
Herb Adderley, the Packers'
alert left corner back, inter
cepted a Lamonica pass early in
the final period and raced 60
yards for a score with the help
of blocks by tackles Henry Jor
dan and Ron Kostelnik.
Raider Offense Stalled
The Raiders simply were not
able to get their offense moving
with the exception of Lamonica's
two tosses to Miller. Willie Davis
was breaking through the Raid
er line all through the sunny af
ternoon.
It was a satisfying triumph
for the overage Packers, who
showed their grid obituaries had
been written prematurely. Com
ing on top of an unprecedented
third straight NFL playoff title,
this second Super Bowl in suc
cession meant almost as much in
prestige as it did in cash.
$26,000
Each winner got $15,000 and
each loser $7,500. Coming on top
of about $8,000 for the Dallas
game and another $3,000 in ex
tra pay for the divisional playoff
and next year's College All-Star
game, each Packer figured to
pocket about $26,000 extra cash.

victory.
