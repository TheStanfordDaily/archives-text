# Two Conference Losses
## A
						Bad Weekend For Basketball 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Stanford saw its Pacific 8 rec
ord drop to 1-3 over the weekend
as the Tribe was buried by USC
Friday night 90-64, and let Al
cindor-less UCLA slip away 75-
63 on Saturday.
Alcindor suffered a cut on his
left eye Friday night at Cal, and
did not even dress for the Stan
ford contest. But apparently just
the sight of Big Lew sitting on
the bench (in a coat, tie, and
sunglasses) scared the wits out
of the Stanford players.
An ice cold first half de
stroyed any hopes of the upset
of the year, which Alcindor's ab
sence made a real possibility.
The Tribe outscored UCLA in
the second half, but just couldn't
close the gap.
Nervous
The mood of the first half was
set early when re-activated Mai
McElwain and Art Harris both
shot wildly and missed every
thing in sight. Harris, suffering
from an abcessed tooth, never
did get going and managed only
two points in the first half.
Except for a couple of long
bombs by Griffin, the rest of the
Tribe attack was similarly dis
couraging. The statistics showed
nine first-half field goals in 25
attempts for a miserable 36 per
cent.
Meanwhile, 6'B" Bruin "re
serve" forward Mike Lynn, was
ripping the nets off the basket
with 20 foot jumpers. Up front,
Lynn Shackleford and Mike
Warren used the old pick-and

roll maneuver to isolate 5'10"
Gary Petersmeyer one-on-one
against 6'5" Shackleford. This,
obviously, was not a favorable
situation.
As the halftime gun sounded,
the scoreboard read 22-36, a size
able, but not impossible gap.
Bruins Outscored
The second half was interest
ing, at least. Lynn lost his touch,
Kuchenbecher, Griffin, and Pe
tersmeyer started scoring, and
suddenly it was only 49-59, with
five minutes left.
Coach Dallmar called a time
out, and the starting five came
out looking charged up with
that "now or never" look.
In typical UCLA fashion,
Shackleford stole the inbounds
pass, and the Tribe was in never
never land.
The game was encouraging in
a couple of respects. Don Griffin
showed some signs of awaken
ing from his early season dol
drums, and Kuchenbecher indi
cated he could score, hitting 4
buckets without a miss.
All Part of the Game
An interesting sidelight devel
oped late in the second half
when Lucius Allen of UCLA
decked Gary Petersmeyer with
a strategically aimed elbow to
the back of the neck. Apparent
ly the blow was in retaliation for
what Allen considered a not-so
accidental eye injury received
earlier in a scramble for a loose
ball.
UCLA coach John Wooden im
mediately pulled Allen, and did

not put him back in until the
last few minutes. Irate Stanford
partisans soundly booed Allen
every time he touched the ball.
Trojans Touffh
UCLA without Alcindor did
not really look as impressive as
USC had Friday night. The Tro
jans, with 7'o Ron Taylor and
6'7" forwards Bill Hewitt and
Jim Marsh rebounding vicious
ly, roared away in the second
half to score their easy 90-64
victory.
The see-saw first half was
highlighted by a great personal
duel between Harris and Bill
Hewitt of USC. Harris out
quicked the 6'7" Hewitt for 14
first half points, and the Tribe
went into the locker room trail
ing only 32-39.
But Harris picked up his 4th
foul with 12 minutes left, and
Hewitt, along with plenty of
support, began to widen the gap.
Hewitt and Harris both ended
the evening with 25 points.
Stanford tried the press which
had ruined Oregon; and when it
failed, began shooting wildly.
But the Trojans just kept
gathering in the rebounds and
simply walked away from the
Tribe. At the end, they were
just barely in sight.
Pacific Eight Roundup
USC's Trojans, led by Bill
Hewitt's 30 points, kept pace
with UCLA in conference play
with an impressive 85-65 victory
over California.
The Golden Bears were held

off the boards by Hewitt and 7-
foot-1 Ron Taylor.
Hewitt grabbed 17 rebounds
and hit some key shots when
the Bears made a run. Guard
Mack Calvin and forward Jim
Marsh each had 16 for the win
ners.
Cal's Russ Critchfield got 25
and 6-footlOV2 center Bob Pres
ley 17.
Oregon State, 2-0 in the Pac
ific-8 before Saturday's play, ran
into Jim McKean and the Wash
ington State Cuogars.
The Cougars had been rated
as one of the top teams on the
coast before the season but lost
twice last week. Their revenge
came in the form of an 85-65
spanking of the Beavers.
McKean, a 6-foot-9, first team
all-conference center last year,
broke loose for 32 points and 17
rebounds.
Washington also got its first
victory — an 84-73 triumph over
winless Oregon.
The Huskies opened up an 11

point halftime lead and built it
to 19 early in the second half.
A Webfoot rally closed the gap
to just two — 73-71 — before
Washington went into a slow
down. Before long, Dave Cart'
and Jay Bond found the bucket
for easy shots and the Huskies
won. Carr wound up with 19 and
Bond 18 as the winners hit 30 of
40 foul shots. ♦
