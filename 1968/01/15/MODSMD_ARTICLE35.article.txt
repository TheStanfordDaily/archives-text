# 'Elders' Retain Dignity, Defeat Frosh
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
John Ferris obliterated the
NCAA freshman record for 200
butterfly and two other fresh
man records gurgled down the
drain, but Papoose swimmers
could not quite overtake the
Stanford varsity as the NCAA
champion Indians prevailed, 65-
48, Saturday.
Friday, nine different Indians
won individual events to swim
over San Jose State, 73-30.
The varsity-frosh meet took on
a new light last Wednesday. The
NCAA rules committee passed a
regulation which, pending clari
fication, will make freshman
athletes for,. NCAA
championship competition.

Ferris -taurned up the_ pool in
the 200 bytjerfly, boiling to a
1:52.9, a sedohd and a'half under
the old record of 1:54.3. He took
out his first 100 in a torrid 52.9
and brought it home in 1:00.
Ferris then returned to take sec
ond in the 500 free 15 minutes
later.
The Papooses started strong
with a decisive victory in the
medley relay. Mitch Ivey broke
his own pool record and estab
lished a new Stanford freshman
record with a 54.9 backstroke
leadoff.
Freestylers Turn Tables
The varsity gradually turned
the tables, winning every free
style event except the 500. Luis
Nicolao took the 200 in 1:46.4
and later edged national high
school record holder Bob Jami
son in the 100 at 48.0.
Ken Hammer sprinted to a
21.9 50 victory and took third
in the 100 free in 48.3.
Bill Main scored two impres
sive victories in diving. All-
American freshman counterpart
Ted Nichols dived with a brace
for a knee injury suffered last
week.
The Papooses nailed down
back-to-back 1-2 sweeps in the
200 backstroke and 500 free to
abruptly close the gap to 50-47.
AAU champion Fred Haywood
and World Student Games com
petitor Ivey aced the backstroke
and Brent Berk and Ferris swept
the 500.
Berk, who toured Europe with
the U.S. national team last fall,
broke Mike Wall's freshman rec
ord with a 4:59.5 effort.
After the successive 1-2 set
backs, the varsity was riding its
tenuous three-point lead with 2
events to go. Bob Momsen and
Dick Roth took first and second
in the 200 breaststroke to clinch
the meet before the final relay.
Pete Siebert's 47.5 anchor leg

on the freestyle relay moved the
Indians to a nippy 3:12.9 and
pushed the final score deceptive
ly out of proportion to the close
ness of the meet.
Bob Momsen, captain of the
NCAA champion varsity, noted
wryly after the last relay, "You
know, it's always hard to beat
an incumbent."
Sure Thing?
While conjecture about an
awesome NCAA lineup buzzed
around the lockerroom, coach
Jim Gaughran talked to the
freshmen and varsity together.
"I think we saw today that what
some people see as a sure thing
doesn't always wind up that
way."
"If we do get to swim varsity
and frosh together in the
NCAA's, however good that
looks on paper, there's no sure
thing about it," said Gaughran,
"especially where USC is con
cerned. We have an awful long
way to go and it's going to take
a lot of hard work."

FERRIS FLIES — Freshman John Ferris set a new Stanford frosh record against the varsity Satur
day morning. His time for the 200 yard butterfly was 1:52.9, just a half second slower than last year's
winning time in the NCAA championships. Despite Ferris's performance, he and his freshmen mates
were nosed out by the varsity, 65-48.
The proposal "Freshman Rule", which would allow frosh participation in NCAA championship
events, could be a boon to Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran. With the addition of the prodigious Pa
pooses, last year's defending NCAA champs would stand a much better chance of beating number
one ranked CSC and hanging on to the team title.

FERRIS FLIES — Freshman John Ferris set a new Stanford frosh record against the varsity Satur
day morning. His time for the 200 yard butterfly was 1:52.9, just a half second slower than last year's
winning time in the NCAA championships. Despite Ferris's performance, he and his freshmen mates
were nosed out by the varsity, 65-48.
The proposal "Freshman Rule", which would allow frosh participation in NCAA championship
events, could be a boon to Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran. With the addition of the prodigious Pa
pooses, last year's defending NCAA champs would stand a much better chance of beating number
one ranked CSC and hanging on to the team title.
John Ferris obliterated the
NCAA freshman record for 200
butterfly and two other fresh
man records gurgled down the
drain, but Papoose swimmers
could not quite overtake the
Stanford varsity as the NCAA
champion Indians prevailed, 65-
48, Saturday.
Friday, nine different Indians
won individual events to swim
over San Jose State, 73-30.
The varsity-frosh meet took on
a new light last Wednesday. The
NCAA rules committee passed a
regulation which, pending clari
fication, will make freshman
athletes for,. NCAA
championship competition.

Ferris -taurned up the_ pool in
the 200 bytjerfly, boiling to a
1:52.9, a sedohd and a'half under
the old record of 1:54.3. He took
out his first 100 in a torrid 52.9
and brought it home in 1:00.
Ferris then returned to take sec
ond in the 500 free 15 minutes
later.
The Papooses started strong
with a decisive victory in the
medley relay. Mitch Ivey broke
his own pool record and estab
lished a new Stanford freshman
record with a 54.9 backstroke
leadoff.
Freestylers Turn Tables
The varsity gradually turned
the tables, winning every free
style event except the 500. Luis
Nicolao took the 200 in 1:46.4
and later edged national high
school record holder Bob Jami
son in the 100 at 48.0.
Ken Hammer sprinted to a
21.9 50 victory and took third
in the 100 free in 48.3.
Bill Main scored two impres
sive victories in diving. All-
American freshman counterpart
Ted Nichols dived with a brace
for a knee injury suffered last
week.
The Papooses nailed down
back-to-back 1-2 sweeps in the
200 backstroke and 500 free to
abruptly close the gap to 50-47.
AAU champion Fred Haywood
and World Student Games com
petitor Ivey aced the backstroke
and Brent Berk and Ferris swept
the 500.
Berk, who toured Europe with
the U.S. national team last fall,
broke Mike Wall's freshman rec
ord with a 4:59.5 effort.
After the successive 1-2 set
backs, the varsity was riding its
tenuous three-point lead with 2
events to go. Bob Momsen and
Dick Roth took first and second
in the 200 breaststroke to clinch
the meet before the final relay.
Pete Siebert's 47.5 anchor leg

on the freestyle relay moved the
Indians to a nippy 3:12.9 and
pushed the final score deceptive
ly out of proportion to the close
ness of the meet.
Bob Momsen, captain of the
NCAA champion varsity, noted
wryly after the last relay, "You
know, it's always hard to beat
an incumbent."

day morning. His time for the 200 yard butterfly was 1:52.9, just a half second slower than last year's
winning time in the NCAA championships. Despite Ferris's performance, he and his freshmen mates
were nosed out by the varsity, 65-48.
The proposal "Freshman Rule", which would allow frosh participation in NCAA championship
events, could be a boon to Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran. With the addition of the prodigious Pa
pooses, last year's defending NCAA champs would stand a much better chance of beating number
one ranked CSC and hanging on to the team title.
John Ferris obliterated the
NCAA freshman record for 200
butterfly and two other fresh
man records gurgled down the
drain, but Papoose swimmers
could not quite overtake the
Stanford varsity as the NCAA
champion Indians prevailed, 65-
48, Saturday.
Friday, nine different Indians
won individual events to swim
over San Jose State, 73-30.
The varsity-frosh meet took on
a new light last Wednesday. The
NCAA rules committee passed a
regulation which, pending clari
fication, will make freshman
athletes for,. NCAA
championship competition.

Ferris -taurned up the_ pool in
the 200 bytjerfly, boiling to a
1:52.9, a sedohd and a'half under
the old record of 1:54.3. He took
out his first 100 in a torrid 52.9
and brought it home in 1:00.
Ferris then returned to take sec
ond in the 500 free 15 minutes
later.
The Papooses started strong
with a decisive victory in the
medley relay. Mitch Ivey broke
his own pool record and estab
lished a new Stanford freshman
record with a 54.9 backstroke
leadoff.
Freestylers Turn Tables
The varsity gradually turned
the tables, winning every free
style event except the 500. Luis
Nicolao took the 200 in 1:46.4
and later edged national high
school record holder Bob Jami
son in the 100 at 48.0.
Ken Hammer sprinted to a
21.9 50 victory and took third
in the 100 free in 48.3.
Bill Main scored two impres
sive victories in diving. All-
American freshman counterpart
Ted Nichols dived with a brace
for a knee injury suffered last
week.
The Papooses nailed down
back-to-back 1-2 sweeps in the
200 backstroke and 500 free to
abruptly close the gap to 50-47.
AAU champion Fred Haywood
and World Student Games com
petitor Ivey aced the backstroke
and Brent Berk and Ferris swept
the 500.
Berk, who toured Europe with
the U.S. national team last fall,
broke Mike Wall's freshman rec
ord with a 4:59.5 effort.
After the successive 1-2 set
backs, the varsity was riding its
tenuous three-point lead with 2
events to go. Bob Momsen and
Dick Roth took first and second
in the 200 breaststroke to clinch
the meet before the final relay.
Pete Siebert's 47.5 anchor leg

on the freestyle relay moved the
Indians to a nippy 3:12.9 and
pushed the final score deceptive
ly out of proportion to the close
ness of the meet.
Bob Momsen, captain of the
NCAA champion varsity, noted
wryly after the last relay, "You
know, it's always hard to beat
an incumbent."
Sure Thing?
While conjecture about an
awesome NCAA lineup buzzed
around the lockerroom, coach
Jim Gaughran talked to the
freshmen and varsity together.
"I think we saw today that what
some people see as a sure thing
doesn't always wind up that
way."
"If we do get to swim varsity
and frosh together in the
NCAA's, however good that
looks on paper, there's no sure
thing about it," said Gaughran,
"especially where USC is con
cerned. We have an awful long
way to go and it's going to take
a lot of hard work."

in the 200 breaststroke to clinch
the meet before the final relay.
Pete Siebert's 47.5 anchor leg

on the freestyle relay moved the
Indians to a nippy 3:12.9 and
pushed the final score deceptive
ly out of proportion to the close
ness of the meet.
Bob Momsen, captain of the
NCAA champion varsity, noted
wryly after the last relay, "You
know, it's always hard to beat
an incumbent."
Sure Thing?
While conjecture about an
awesome NCAA lineup buzzed
around the lockerroom, coach
Jim Gaughran talked to the
freshmen and varsity together.
"I think we saw today that what
some people see as a sure thing
doesn't always wind up that
way."
"If we do get to swim varsity
and frosh together in the
NCAA's, however good that
looks on paper, there's no sure
thing about it," said Gaughran,
"especially where USC is con
cerned. We have an awful long
way to go and it's going to take
a lot of hard work."

FERRIS FLIES — Freshman John Ferris set a new Stanford frosh record against the varsity Satur
day morning. His time for the 200 yard butterfly was 1:52.9, just a half second slower than last year's
winning time in the NCAA championships. Despite Ferris's performance, he and his freshmen mates
were nosed out by the varsity, 65-48.
The proposal "Freshman Rule", which would allow frosh participation in NCAA championship
events, could be a boon to Stanford Coach Jim Gaughran. With the addition of the prodigious Pa
pooses, last year's defending NCAA champs would stand a much better chance of beating number
one ranked CSC and hanging on to the team title.
John Ferris obliterated the
NCAA freshman record for 200
butterfly and two other fresh
man records gurgled down the
drain, but Papoose swimmers
could not quite overtake the
Stanford varsity as the NCAA
champion Indians prevailed, 65-
48, Saturday.
Friday, nine different Indians
won individual events to swim
over San Jose State, 73-30.
The varsity-frosh meet took on
a new light last Wednesday. The
NCAA rules committee passed a
regulation which, pending clari
fication, will make freshman
athletes for,. NCAA
championship competition.

Ferris On Wings
Ferris -taurned up the_ pool in
the 200 bytjerfly, boiling to a
1:52.9, a sedohd and a'half under
the old record of 1:54.3. He took
out his first 100 in a torrid 52.9
and brought it home in 1:00.
Ferris then returned to take sec
ond in the 500 free 15 minutes
later.
The Papooses started strong
with a decisive victory in the
medley relay. Mitch Ivey broke
his own pool record and estab
lished a new Stanford freshman
record with a 54.9 backstroke
leadoff.
Freestylers Turn Tables
The varsity gradually turned
the tables, winning every free
style event except the 500. Luis
Nicolao took the 200 in 1:46.4
and later edged national high
school record holder Bob Jami
son in the 100 at 48.0.
Ken Hammer sprinted to a
21.9 50 victory and took third
in the 100 free in 48.3.
Bill Main scored two impres
sive victories in diving. All-
American freshman counterpart
Ted Nichols dived with a brace
for a knee injury suffered last
week.
The Papooses nailed down
back-to-back 1-2 sweeps in the
200 backstroke and 500 free to
abruptly close the gap to 50-47.
AAU champion Fred Haywood
and World Student Games com
petitor Ivey aced the backstroke
and Brent Berk and Ferris swept
the 500.
Berk, who toured Europe with
the U.S. national team last fall,
broke Mike Wall's freshman rec
ord with a 4:59.5 effort.
After the successive 1-2 set
backs, the varsity was riding its
tenuous three-point lead with 2
events to go. Bob Momsen and
Dick Roth took first and second
in the 200 breaststroke to clinch
the meet before the final relay.
Pete Siebert's 47.5 anchor leg

on the freestyle relay moved the
Indians to a nippy 3:12.9 and
pushed the final score deceptive
ly out of proportion to the close
ness of the meet.
