# B 52 Strike
## Red Buildup Hit Near DMZ 
### 
SAIGON (AP) â€” Air Force
852 bombers, trying to beat the
enemy to the punch in the north
west corner of South Vietnam,
twice Monday bombed Commu
nist camps below the demilitar
ized zone.
It appeared that the stratofort
resses were opening a campaign
to blast enemy concentrations
before the Communists could
mount an offensive against the
tightly stretched allied positions
guarding the northern frontier.
There already were signs of
increasing enemy activity in the
recently dormant DMZ sector.
American Green Beret troopers
detected North Vietnamese units
moving south of the zone Sun
day after 19 U.S. Marines were
killed and 70 wounded in an am
bush in the same general area.
U.S. commanders speculate

that the Communists may be
planning a new wave of assaults
after the monsoon weather ends
in early spring. Intelligence re
ports say a North Vietnamese
army division is poised along the
demilitarized zone.
The U.S. Command said one
of Monday's 852 raids was 12
miles northwest of Khe Sauh
and the second 14 miles north
west of the Marine outpost 20
miles below the DMZ.
The Green Berets spotted the
North Vietnamese troops cross
ing a river Sunday five miles
southwest of Khe Sanh. A U.S.
spokesman said 10 Reds were
killed and one American wound
ed in the ensuing fight.
It was the first time in weeks
that North Vietnamese troops
were seen on the move in that
area.
Elsewhere, ground action was

light. U.S. infantrymen found an
enemy cache of 20,600 pounds of
rice 34 miles north of Saigon.
The rice, in 100-pound bags, will
be distributed among needy
Vietnamese.
Poor weather limited the
American air offensive over
North Vietnam. Pilots reported
hitting a variety of transporta
tion and storage targets.
Ambush Repulsed
The ambush of U.S. Marines
was on Highway 9, which links
Marine supply lines to outposts
along the DMZ from the coast to
the Laotian border.
Springing up from prepared
positions along the highway,
North Vietnamese gunners op
ened up on the convoy with
withering fire from small arms,
machine guns and bazookas. At
the same time, they detonated
two mines in the convoy.
The convoy, about 10 trucks
with tanks as escort, was carry
ing 200 Marines from the out
post of Ca Lu to Camp Carroll,
20 miles below the DMZ. Ca Lu
sits between the Marine strong
point of Camp Carroll along the
eastern edge to the northern

frontier and Khe Sanh that an
chors the western edge.
U.S. headquarters said dam
age to the Marine vehicles was
reported light.
The Marines dismounted from
the convoy and laid down a
blanket of fire. Tanks, artillery
and helicopter gunships also
raked the ambush positions.
The fighting continued for al
most five hours before the North
Vietnamese pulled back late Sat
urday.
New Zealand Debut
Elsewhere, New Zealand
troops, in their first major skir
mish of the Vietnam war, killed
11 Viet Cong in a brief fight 29
miles southwest of Saigon Satur
day night. The New Zealanders,
who have only a handful of
troops in Vietnam, also captured
14 weapons.
Marine rescue teams were
hampered again Sunday by
northeast monsoons blanketing
the northern edge of South Viet
nam in their efforts to reach a
downed helicopter with 41 men
aboard on a hazardous moun
tainside 34 miles below the
DMZ.
