# Axe To Stay In Safe-Keeping Until Cal Can Construct Case
## 
### 
Remember the Axe?
The Cal-Stanford football tro
phy, dating back to the 19th
century, passed into Cal's hands
Nov. 19 after seven consecutive
years at Stanford.
Now Berkeley's Rally Commis
sion must decide what to do with
the trophy, which consists of a
large axe head on a wooden pla
que, listing each year's winner
in the long sports rivalry.
Jay Miller, chairman of the
Cal Rally Comm, says planning
has just started for "some kind
of display case" in the Berkeley
student union. Rally Comm
members discussed plans with
an architect two weeks ago. A
special case must be built for
the Axe, since the Cal student
union wasn't even built when
Cal lost the trophy in 1960.

"We plan to keep it for some
time," Miller said matter-of-fact
iy-
The location of the Axe now is
a secret, according to Miller, but
a careless receptionist at the
student union revealed it is be
ing kept in the safe of the box
office there. Thefts of the Axe
by the dispossessed school are
a 70-year tradition. Last spring
a band of Cal fraternity men
stole it from a display case in
Tresidder Union.
The Axe was returned to Stan
ford's Axe Commission the
morning of Big Game last fall,
but Stanford lost 26-3. After the
game Axe Comm chairman Dick
Roth presented the trophy to
Cal's football co-captains. The
Axe was displayed to a crowd
of thousands of Cal partisans at
a rally two days later.
