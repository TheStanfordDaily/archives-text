# For Vietnam Visitors
## Prof To Sponsor Talk 
### 
Prof.' Claude A. Buss has call
ed a meeting for a discussion by
all people of the Stanford area
who have visited Vietnam for
Tuesday at 7 p.m. in Tresidder.
Buss hopes that the meeting
will serve as a forum in which
people who have been Vietnam
can discuss, compare, and ana
lyze their reactions about the
war-torn country. He adds that
anyone who has been to Viet
nam in either a military or civi
lian capacity is invited.
The Stanford professor has

been to Vietnam himself ten
times since 1957. The main pur
pose of his trips has been to act
as an independent observer and
to obtain information for his
classes on Southeast Asia.
Buss feels that there are three
ways to approach a complex
situation: to academically study
the situation, to hold strong
moral convictions about it, or
to confront the situation first
hand. Tomorrow's meeting hope
fully will approach the Vietnam
problem from the third path.
