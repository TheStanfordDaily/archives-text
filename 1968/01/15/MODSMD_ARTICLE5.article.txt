# Threats Bring End To Saigon Strikes
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — Saigon's
electrical system returned to full
power Monday and cargo flowed
smoothly through the port again
as striking workers returned to
their jobs.
Government threats and pres
sures brought most of the 3,500
electrical workers back to the
generating plants. Longshore
men, striking in sympathy with
the electrical workers, returned
to the docks over the weekend
after they were warned they
would be arrested.
Six leaders of the electrical
workers' union, arrested soon
after the strike for higher pay
began last Thursday, reportedly
were released but still faced a
military court-martial. No nego
tiations to end the electrical
strike officially were in prog
ress Monday, but officials said
probings were being made.
Electrical production fell about
40 per cent during the strike.
Police broke up a union meet
ing Saturday and took more
than 100 electricians away in
trucks to the generating plants.

Sources said a total of 300 strik
ing workers were requisition
ed' 'to return to the plants.
Premier Nguyen Van Loc or
dered the mobilization of the
striking workers for a month.
Police visited the homes of many
workers, warning them of the
consequences if they did not re
turn to their jobs.
Several hundred U.S. troops
were moved to the commercial
docks Saturday when Vietna
mese stevedores refused to un
load military cargo. This ended
when the Vietnamese returned
to work Saturday night.
Bus and scooter-bus drivers
also struck for a while during
the weekend but were back at
work Monday after police began
driving the vehicles.
The electrical strike grew out
of the government takeover Jan.
