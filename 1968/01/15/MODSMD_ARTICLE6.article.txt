# Seminar Program Growth Raises Doubts On Quality
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Burgeoning growth in the "un
dergraduate special" seminar
program will be brought under
control by a new set of regu
lations adopted Friday by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education (CUE).
The Committee wants more
detailed information on the con
tent of the special seminars,
which offer as man as three
units of academic credit on sub
jects ranging from Buddhist
Thought to University Finances.
"There have been growing
pains,' 'said Robert Hind, asso
ciate dean of undergraduate ed
ucation. "We don't want to see
the program jeopardized by slop
py courses."
"The response to the program
has been more rapid than we ex

pected," Hind commented. Last
quarter there were 12 under
graduate specials. This quarter
there are more than 50.
The seminars aren't offered
by a particular department;
hence the name, "undergradu
ate special." Many are born when
a group of students persuade a
professor to sponsor a seminar
on a topic of common interest—
Vietnam, nonviolence, intentional
communities or technology. Oth
er undergraduate specials are
organized by the Grove and
Otero coed houses. The Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
sponsors seven undergraduate
specials on university problems.
Regarded As Experiment
CUE regards the undergradu
ate specials as an "experiment"
to make Stanford's course offer
ings more responsive to student
interests, according to Prof.
Philip Rhinelander, CUE chair
man. Flexibility is fine, but CUE
is a little worried about giving
academic credit to some hastily
conceived seminars with an un
clear degree of faculty partici
pation.
"We want to be liberal," Rhine
lander said, "but we want to be
sure academic standards are
maintained."
CUE also wants more time to
consider seminar proposals. A
flood of proposals came in just
before the Dec. 16 deadline for
winter quarter.
"It was chaotic," Hind recol
lected. "We had no time to check
into the seminars' content." CUE
went ahead and approved almost
all the proposals anyway, not
wanting to dampen faculty and
student enthusiasm for the ex
periment.
New Deadlines Set
But the new deadlines for sub
mitting proposals to Hind's of
fice in building 10A will require
early action by seminar organ
izers. For spring quarter, pro
posals must be submitted by
Feb. 15.
A more detailed "prospectus"
of the seminar is also required.
The regulations state:
"Organizers are to file with the
Committee the following infor
mation:
"a. Course title and descrip
tion, number of units;
"b. A description of the man
ner in which the course will be
conducted, and a meeting sche
dule;

"c. A reading list; and
"d. The name of the instruc
tor and any others who will as
sist in teaching the course."
In addition, the professor in
charge must furnish a state
ment that "he agrees to assume
full academic responsibility" for
the seminar's conduct.
Rhinelander explained that
CUE "wants to make sure that a
faculty member will keep in
touch with his seminar ird
turn it over to someone less
qualified."
Hind is concerned about "the
danger of overloading faculty
members" with undergraduate
specials. He points out that fac
ulty aren't paid for taking on
the extra seminar teaching load.
Hind himself, who is also staff
director of the Study of Educa
tion (SES), teachers Undergrad
uate Special 109 on American
Higher Education, with Robert
Funk.
What Is Academics?
The responsibilty for grant
ing or denying academic credit
for seminar proposals has forced
CUE to come to grips with the
question, What is academics?
Rhinelander hesitates to provide
an explicit definition, but he does
believe "serious academic con
tent" means the study of "solid
intellectual questions in a spirit
of critical inquiry."
Thus a seminar can't carry
academic credit if it approaches
"controversial" issues with a
"preconceived notion, setting out
to prove a thesis, instead of eval
uating something," Rhinelander
said.

Last quarter CUE turned down
a proposal for an undergraduate
special on "parapsychology,"
claiming it "lacked critical ma
terial." Rhinelander is quick to
point out, however, that "if the
committee declines to give a
seminar academic credit, it
doesn't mean the seminar should
be prohibited."
Proposals will be considered
on a "common sense basis," ac
cording to Rhinelander. "If some
one wanted to give a course in
basket weaving, we might doubt
its academic qualifications." But
the approach to a topic, rather
than the topic itself, is stressed
by CUE.
To ease the restrictiveness of
the new deadlines for submitting
proposals (Feb. 15 for spring
quarter, May 15 for summer or

autumn, and Nov. 15 for winter),
CUE itself will be able to initiate
undergraduate specials for prom
ising proposals which come in
after the deadline.
Despite the increased scrutiny
proposals will receive, CUE ex
pects the undergraduate special
program to keep on growing.
Hind suggests it may develop
into a permanent part of Stan
ford's course offerings, provid
ing "highly topical" seminars
which departments are reluctant
to initiate themselves.
A survey will be made of fac
ulty and students in last quar
ter's undergraduate specials to
gauge the effectiveness.
CUE's program "allows a good
many students credit for follow
ing out academic interests," ac
cording to Rhinelander. But "we

have to keep the quality up," ho
warned. "Nothing can ruin a
program more quickly than
poor quality."
SPECIAL RULES FOR UNDER
GRADUATE SPECIAL
SEMINARS
No more than one undergrad
uate special seminar may be
taken for academic credit in any
one quarter. SES seminars are
not counted toward this limit.
An instructor can offer the
seminar only on a pass-fail bas
is, or he can give the option of
letter grades or pass-fail. An un
dergraduate can take only 27
pass-fail units toward the 180
required for graduation, but
pass-fail credit for undergradu
ate specials Isn't counted for the
27-unit limit.

uate special seminar may be
taken for academic credit in any
one quarter. SES seminars are
not counted toward this limit.
An instructor can offer the
seminar only on a pass-fail bas
is, or he can give the option of
letter grades or pass-fail. An un
dergraduate can take only 27
pass-fail units toward the 180
required for graduation, but
pass-fail credit for undergradu
ate specials Isn't counted for the
27-unit limit.
Burgeoning growth in the "un
dergraduate special" seminar
program will be brought under
control by a new set of regu
lations adopted Friday by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education (CUE).
The Committee wants more
detailed information on the con
tent of the special seminars,
which offer as man as three
units of academic credit on sub
jects ranging from Buddhist
Thought to University Finances.
"There have been growing
pains,' 'said Robert Hind, asso
ciate dean of undergraduate ed
ucation. "We don't want to see
the program jeopardized by slop
py courses."
"The response to the program
has been more rapid than we ex

pected," Hind commented. Last
quarter there were 12 under
graduate specials. This quarter
there are more than 50.
The seminars aren't offered
by a particular department;
hence the name, "undergradu
ate special." Many are born when
a group of students persuade a
professor to sponsor a seminar
on a topic of common interest—
Vietnam, nonviolence, intentional
communities or technology. Oth
er undergraduate specials are
organized by the Grove and
Otero coed houses. The Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
sponsors seven undergraduate
specials on university problems.
Regarded As Experiment
CUE regards the undergradu
ate specials as an "experiment"
to make Stanford's course offer
ings more responsive to student
interests, according to Prof.
Philip Rhinelander, CUE chair
man. Flexibility is fine, but CUE
is a little worried about giving
academic credit to some hastily
conceived seminars with an un
clear degree of faculty partici
pation.
"We want to be liberal," Rhine
lander said, "but we want to be
sure academic standards are
maintained."
CUE also wants more time to
consider seminar proposals. A
flood of proposals came in just
before the Dec. 16 deadline for
winter quarter.
"It was chaotic," Hind recol
lected. "We had no time to check
into the seminars' content." CUE
went ahead and approved almost
all the proposals anyway, not
wanting to dampen faculty and
student enthusiasm for the ex
periment.
New Deadlines Set
But the new deadlines for sub
mitting proposals to Hind's of
fice in building 10A will require
early action by seminar organ
izers. For spring quarter, pro
posals must be submitted by
Feb. 15.
A more detailed "prospectus"
of the seminar is also required.
The regulations state:
"Organizers are to file with the
Committee the following infor
mation:
"a. Course title and descrip
tion, number of units;
"b. A description of the man
ner in which the course will be
conducted, and a meeting sche
dule;

"c. A reading list; and
"d. The name of the instruc
tor and any others who will as
sist in teaching the course."
In addition, the professor in
charge must furnish a state
ment that "he agrees to assume
full academic responsibility" for
the seminar's conduct.
Rhinelander explained that
CUE "wants to make sure that a
faculty member will keep in
touch with his seminar ird
turn it over to someone less
qualified."
Hind is concerned about "the
danger of overloading faculty
members" with undergraduate
specials. He points out that fac
ulty aren't paid for taking on
the extra seminar teaching load.
Hind himself, who is also staff
director of the Study of Educa
tion (SES), teachers Undergrad
uate Special 109 on American
Higher Education, with Robert
Funk.
What Is Academics?
The responsibilty for grant
ing or denying academic credit
for seminar proposals has forced
CUE to come to grips with the
question, What is academics?
Rhinelander hesitates to provide
an explicit definition, but he does
believe "serious academic con
tent" means the study of "solid
intellectual questions in a spirit
of critical inquiry."
Thus a seminar can't carry
academic credit if it approaches
"controversial" issues with a
"preconceived notion, setting out
to prove a thesis, instead of eval
uating something," Rhinelander
said.

Last quarter CUE turned down
a proposal for an undergraduate
special on "parapsychology,"
claiming it "lacked critical ma
terial." Rhinelander is quick to
point out, however, that "if the
committee declines to give a
seminar academic credit, it
doesn't mean the seminar should
be prohibited."
Proposals will be considered
on a "common sense basis," ac
cording to Rhinelander. "If some
one wanted to give a course in
basket weaving, we might doubt
its academic qualifications." But
the approach to a topic, rather
than the topic itself, is stressed
by CUE.
To ease the restrictiveness of
the new deadlines for submitting
proposals (Feb. 15 for spring
quarter, May 15 for summer or

autumn, and Nov. 15 for winter),
CUE itself will be able to initiate
undergraduate specials for prom
ising proposals which come in
after the deadline.
Despite the increased scrutiny
proposals will receive, CUE ex
pects the undergraduate special
program to keep on growing.
Hind suggests it may develop
into a permanent part of Stan
ford's course offerings, provid
ing "highly topical" seminars
which departments are reluctant
to initiate themselves.
A survey will be made of fac
ulty and students in last quar
ter's undergraduate specials to
gauge the effectiveness.
CUE's program "allows a good
many students credit for follow
ing out academic interests," ac
cording to Rhinelander. But "we

have to keep the quality up," ho
warned. "Nothing can ruin a
program more quickly than
poor quality."

SPECIAL RULES FOR UNDER
GRADUATE SPECIAL
SEMINARS
No more than one undergrad
uate special seminar may be
taken for academic credit in any
one quarter. SES seminars are
not counted toward this limit.
An instructor can offer the
seminar only on a pass-fail bas
is, or he can give the option of
letter grades or pass-fail. An un
dergraduate can take only 27
pass-fail units toward the 180
required for graduation, but
pass-fail credit for undergradu
ate specials Isn't counted for the
27-unit limit.
Burgeoning growth in the "un
dergraduate special" seminar
program will be brought under
control by a new set of regu
lations adopted Friday by the
Committee on Undergraduate
Education (CUE).
The Committee wants more
detailed information on the con
tent of the special seminars,
which offer as man as three
units of academic credit on sub
jects ranging from Buddhist
Thought to University Finances.
"There have been growing
pains,' 'said Robert Hind, asso
ciate dean of undergraduate ed
ucation. "We don't want to see
the program jeopardized by slop
py courses."
"The response to the program
has been more rapid than we ex

pected," Hind commented. Last
quarter there were 12 under
graduate specials. This quarter
there are more than 50.
The seminars aren't offered
by a particular department;
hence the name, "undergradu
ate special." Many are born when
a group of students persuade a
professor to sponsor a seminar
on a topic of common interest—
Vietnam, nonviolence, intentional
communities or technology. Oth
er undergraduate specials are
organized by the Grove and
Otero coed houses. The Study
of Education at Stanford (SES)
sponsors seven undergraduate
specials on university problems.
Regarded As Experiment
CUE regards the undergradu
ate specials as an "experiment"
to make Stanford's course offer
ings more responsive to student
interests, according to Prof.
Philip Rhinelander, CUE chair
man. Flexibility is fine, but CUE
is a little worried about giving
academic credit to some hastily
conceived seminars with an un
clear degree of faculty partici
pation.
"We want to be liberal," Rhine
lander said, "but we want to be
sure academic standards are
maintained."
CUE also wants more time to
consider seminar proposals. A
flood of proposals came in just
before the Dec. 16 deadline for
winter quarter.
"It was chaotic," Hind recol
lected. "We had no time to check
into the seminars' content." CUE
went ahead and approved almost
all the proposals anyway, not
wanting to dampen faculty and
student enthusiasm for the ex
periment.
New Deadlines Set
But the new deadlines for sub
mitting proposals to Hind's of
fice in building 10A will require
early action by seminar organ
izers. For spring quarter, pro
posals must be submitted by
Feb. 15.
A more detailed "prospectus"
of the seminar is also required.
The regulations state:
"Organizers are to file with the
Committee the following infor
mation:
"a. Course title and descrip
tion, number of units;
"b. A description of the man
ner in which the course will be
conducted, and a meeting sche
dule;

"c. A reading list; and
"d. The name of the instruc
tor and any others who will as
sist in teaching the course."
In addition, the professor in
charge must furnish a state
ment that "he agrees to assume
full academic responsibility" for
the seminar's conduct.
Rhinelander explained that
CUE "wants to make sure that a
faculty member will keep in
touch with his seminar ird
turn it over to someone less
qualified."
Hind is concerned about "the
danger of overloading faculty
members" with undergraduate
specials. He points out that fac
ulty aren't paid for taking on
the extra seminar teaching load.
Hind himself, who is also staff
director of the Study of Educa
tion (SES), teachers Undergrad
uate Special 109 on American
Higher Education, with Robert
Funk.
What Is Academics?
The responsibilty for grant
ing or denying academic credit
for seminar proposals has forced
CUE to come to grips with the
question, What is academics?
Rhinelander hesitates to provide
an explicit definition, but he does
believe "serious academic con
tent" means the study of "solid
intellectual questions in a spirit
of critical inquiry."
Thus a seminar can't carry
academic credit if it approaches
"controversial" issues with a
"preconceived notion, setting out
to prove a thesis, instead of eval
uating something," Rhinelander
said.

Last quarter CUE turned down
a proposal for an undergraduate
special on "parapsychology,"
claiming it "lacked critical ma
terial." Rhinelander is quick to
point out, however, that "if the
committee declines to give a
seminar academic credit, it
doesn't mean the seminar should
be prohibited."
Proposals will be considered
on a "common sense basis," ac
cording to Rhinelander. "If some
one wanted to give a course in
basket weaving, we might doubt
its academic qualifications." But
the approach to a topic, rather
than the topic itself, is stressed
by CUE.
To ease the restrictiveness of
the new deadlines for submitting
proposals (Feb. 15 for spring
quarter, May 15 for summer or

autumn, and Nov. 15 for winter),
CUE itself will be able to initiate
undergraduate specials for prom
ising proposals which come in
after the deadline.
Despite the increased scrutiny
proposals will receive, CUE ex
pects the undergraduate special
program to keep on growing.
Hind suggests it may develop
into a permanent part of Stan
ford's course offerings, provid
ing "highly topical" seminars
which departments are reluctant
to initiate themselves.
A survey will be made of fac
ulty and students in last quar
ter's undergraduate specials to
gauge the effectiveness.

autumn, and Nov. 15 for winter),
CUE itself will be able to initiate
undergraduate specials for prom
ising proposals which come in
after the deadline.
Despite the increased scrutiny
proposals will receive, CUE ex
pects the undergraduate special
program to keep on growing.
Hind suggests it may develop
into a permanent part of Stan
ford's course offerings, provid
ing "highly topical" seminars
which departments are reluctant
to initiate themselves.
A survey will be made of fac
ulty and students in last quar
ter's undergraduate specials to
gauge the effectiveness.
CUE's program "allows a good
many students credit for follow
ing out academic interests," ac
cording to Rhinelander. But "we

have to keep the quality up," ho
warned. "Nothing can ruin a
program more quickly than
poor quality."
SPECIAL RULES FOR UNDER
GRADUATE SPECIAL
SEMINARS
No more than one undergrad
uate special seminar may be
taken for academic credit in any
one quarter. SES seminars are
not counted toward this limit.
An instructor can offer the
seminar only on a pass-fail bas
is, or he can give the option of
letter grades or pass-fail. An un
dergraduate can take only 27
pass-fail units toward the 180
required for graduation, but
pass-fail credit for undergradu
ate specials Isn't counted for the
27-unit limit.
