# McCarthy Talks Today, Anti-War Stand Expected
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy
brings his fledgling presidential
peace candidacy to Stanford to
day for a noon speech in Me
morial Auditorium.
The Minnesota Democrat, a
constant Senatorial critic of
American foreign policy, will
speak on the Vietnam war and
answer questions from the audi
ence. The address will be open
to the public. The doors will
open at 11:45.
McCarthy's Bay Area itiner
ary also includes a 10 a.m. press
conference in San Francisco, a
luncheon with Stanford faculty
members, and a reception and
dinner back in San Francisco
this evening.
The Stanford appearance is
part of a six-day whirlwind cam
paign visit to California that in
cluded an enthusiastic welcome
by 6,000 students at UCLA Fri

day and a speech in Fresno yes
terday before a Democratic cam
paign conference. At Fresno
McCarthy clashed with an ear
lier address by Vice President
Hubert Humphrey.
Today Congressman Don Ed
wards (D-San Jose) and Tim
Vidal, Stanford Political Union
president, will introduce Mc-
Carthy.
Edwards, a Stanford gradu
ate, was the first congressman
to endorse McCarthy.
Charges "Republican Policy"
Yesterday at Fresno, McCar
thy charged that the President
is "following a Republican for
eign policy." He stated the
Democratic Party is badly split
over the war because the Presi
dent is following the same pol
icy advocated by Barry Gold
water in his 1964 presidential
campaign.
McCarthy was addressing the
Democratic campaign confer
ence of the Democratic State
Central Committee.
Humphrey spoke before the
same group Saturday. He chal
lenged McCarthy's assertion
that Vietnam was was "im
moral," and said he viewed the
conflict as an alternative to the
"nuclear holocaust" of World
War 111.
McCarthy also spoke in Fres
no before the steering commit
tee for the California Demo
cratic Council, a state-wide
peace group that is backing him.
The group is an integral part
in his plans to defeat President
Johnson in the California Dem
ocratic primary.
At the campaign conf rence
yesterday, leaders of a 50-mem
ber study group on foreign af
fairs presented a report that
substantially backed McCarthy.
It called for negotiations to end
the war and asked for phased
withdrawal.
Democratic State Chairman
Charles Warren quickly replied,
however, that the study group's
criticism of the Vietnam war

effort did not speak for the
majority of the delegate attend
ing the conference.
Last Friday at UCLA, Mc-
Carthy suggested that the pres
ent Administration "is afraid to
negotiate" a settlement in Viet
nam.
He said President Johnson has
not heeded Presid nt Kennedy's
statement that the United States
"will never negotiate out of
fear, but it will never fear to
negotiate."
In an editorial th'* morning
of the speech, the student-run
UCLA Bruin asked, "What we
want to know is where Eugene
McCarthy standsâ€”without qual
ification. How will he get us out
of Vietnam? And when?"
Even though he did not di
rectly answer these questions,
McCarthy drew frequent and
prolonged applause with his in
dictments of the Administra
tion's policies, as when, after
recounting the U.S. cost in lives,

wounded men and material re
sources, he asked, "To what
end? What comes with victory?
No one gives us a hint.
Hits U.S. Policy
"I suggest there can be no
victory because we are follow
ing a policy that is not an Am
erican policy. It has never been
our policy to use our power
against a backward and primit
ive people."
McCarthy, 51, draws experi
ence from 20 years in Congress
and as a former professor. He
was a representative ten years
and is now serving his second
term in the Senate. He has
never lost an election.
McCarthy's stand on both do
mestic and foreign policies is
basically that the power balance
within government is being de
stroyed. His Vietnam stand is
built upon the accusation that
the executive branch has in
creasingly usurped Senate pre
rogatives especially in the area

of foreign affairs.
He is one of the leaders of a
futile movement to give the Sen
ate more supervision of the
CIA. He is also an outspoken
critic of federal arms sales to
dt'V' loping nations.
McCarthy's voting record in
cludes support for anti-poverty
programs, civil rights acts, edu
cation bills, and medicare.
Although he voted in support
of the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin reso
lution, McCarthy first showed
signs of disenchantment with
Administration policies when he
supported a Morse motion to

repeal the Gulf of Tonkin man
date.
McCarthy has since moved in
to open antagonism with John
son's policies. In a Nov. 9, 1967,
speech at Macalester College in
Minnesota, he summarized his
current feelings:
"The time has come to ask
the ultimate question as to
whether or not what is called
our commitment in South Viet
nam is morally defensible; to
ask not only whether it is legal
ly, militarily, and politically de
fensible, but also is it morally
defensible and in the national
interest."
