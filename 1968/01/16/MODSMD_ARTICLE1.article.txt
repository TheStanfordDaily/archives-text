# McCarthy Condemns Johnson, Calls Viet War 'Un-American'
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
"Peace candidate" Sen. Eugene
McCarthy repeated his indict
ments of the Johnson Adminis
tration before a Stanford audi
ence yesterday, terming the
Vietnam conflict an "immoral,
indefensible, and un-American
war."
In a noon address before an
overflow crowd in Memorial
Auditorium, the Minnesota
Democrat covered many topics
in his speech and question ses
sion, including:
—Rejection of the idea of a
completely volunteer army,
since "the mercenary army that
might result would be harmful."
He did, however, endorse the
notion of S"lective conscientious
objection to military duty.
—Condemnation of the ar
rests of Dr. Benjamin Spock
and William Sloan Coffin as "in
excusable." Their civil disobed
ience could well have been "tol
erated," he said.
—Recognition of those who
must "carry most of tho bur
den": scholars, religious leaders,
young people and students.
—Repetition of his plea that
other Congressmen opposed to
the war speak out more clearly
with him, presumably meaning

an endorsement of his presi
dential candidacy.
Warm Welcome
McCarthy received a far
warmer welcome at Stanford
than he did over the week nd
in Fresno before a State Demo
cratic campaign conference. Mc-
Carthy's speech here was in
terrupted by applause several
times. He was given a standing
ovation before and after his
talk.
McCarthy claimed that negoti
ations to end the war are indeed
possible if the United States
stops bombing North Vietnam
and opens talks with the Na
tional Liberation Front (NLF).
If this plan is vetoed by the
South Vietnamese, he said, we
should plan a "phased with
drawal" until the South Viet
namese and the NLF arrange a
treaty of their own.
He tremed the war "not de
fensible on moral grounds," and
said that is objectives have been
escalated.
"Our weapons and means are
indefensible against primitive
and defensless people," he said,
defenseless people," he said.
Urges Involvement
The Senator rejected the cur
rent Administration's contention
dissent is harmful. "Every citi

zen must become more politi
cal," he said, "so that we can
redeem this nation beyond
1967." He added that younger
people have a greater stake in
this than anyone.
He denied the effectiveness of
third parties, such as the anti
war Peace and Freedom Party,
in bringing the issues before
the country. "We ought to give
the regular process a try," he
stated.
Much of his talk and question
period was sprinkled with ex
amples of the often biting Mc-
Carthy wit, such as:
On prace feelers from Hanoi:
"I wouldn't be too confident
about them because of the trans
lation problem. They come in
Vietnamese, then to French,
then to State Department—and
then they're translated into
English."
On former Secretary of State
Acheson: "Once a man begins
to write his memoirs, he should
not be consulted on current af
fairs."
On lack of support from
other countries: "President
Johnson even had to helicopter
to the Vatican."
On if he were 20 years young
er: "I would demonstrate all the

way to the induction center and
then probably go in."
McCarthy luncheoned after
his speech with a group of 70
Stanford faculty members at
the Faculty Club. Elliot Levln
thal, senior research associate

in genetics, hosted the affair.
In a short talk before the
faculty, McCarthy decried the
erosion by the executive of
many of the prerogatives of
other institutions, such as the
Senate.

than he did over the week nd
in Fresno before a State Demo
cratic campaign conference. Mc-
Carthy's speech here was in
terrupted by applause several
times. He was given a standing
ovation before and after his
talk.
McCarthy claimed that negoti
ations to end the war are indeed
possible if the United States
stops bombing North Vietnam
and opens talks with the Na
tional Liberation Front (NLF).
If this plan is vetoed by the
South Vietnamese, he said, we
should plan a "phased with
drawal" until the South Viet
namese and the NLF arrange a
treaty of their own.
He tremed the war "not de
fensible on moral grounds," and
said that is objectives have been
escalated.
"Our weapons and means are
indefensible against primitive
and defensless people," he said,
defenseless people," he said.
Urges Involvement
The Senator rejected the cur
rent Administration's contention
dissent is harmful. "Every citi

zen must become more politi
cal," he said, "so that we can
redeem this nation beyond
1967." He added that younger
people have a greater stake in
this than anyone.
He denied the effectiveness of
third parties, such as the anti
war Peace and Freedom Party,
in bringing the issues before
the country. "We ought to give
the regular process a try," he
stated.
Much of his talk and question
period was sprinkled with ex
amples of the often biting Mc-
Carthy wit, such as:
On prace feelers from Hanoi:
"I wouldn't be too confident
about them because of the trans
lation problem. They come in
Vietnamese, then to French,
then to State Department—and
then they're translated into
English."
On former Secretary of State
Acheson: "Once a man begins
to write his memoirs, he should
not be consulted on current af
fairs."
On lack of support from
other countries: "President
Johnson even had to helicopter
to the Vatican."
On if he were 20 years young
er: "I would demonstrate all the

way to the induction center and
then probably go in."
McCarthy luncheoned after
his speech with a group of 70
Stanford faculty members at
the Faculty Club. Elliot Levln
thal, senior research associate

in genetics, hosted the affair.
In a short talk before the
faculty, McCarthy decried the
erosion by the executive of
many of the prerogatives of
other institutions, such as the
Senate.

Senator Eugene McCarthy, addressing a capacity audience in
Memorial Auditorium yesterday.
"Peace candidate" Sen. Eugene
McCarthy repeated his indict
ments of the Johnson Adminis
tration before a Stanford audi
ence yesterday, terming the
Vietnam conflict an "immoral,
indefensible, and un-American
war."
In a noon address before an
overflow crowd in Memorial
Auditorium, the Minnesota
Democrat covered many topics
in his speech and question ses
sion, including:
—Rejection of the idea of a
completely volunteer army,
since "the mercenary army that
might result would be harmful."
He did, however, endorse the
notion of S"lective conscientious
objection to military duty.
—Condemnation of the ar
rests of Dr. Benjamin Spock
and William Sloan Coffin as "in
excusable." Their civil disobed
ience could well have been "tol
erated," he said.
—Recognition of those who
must "carry most of tho bur
den": scholars, religious leaders,
young people and students.
—Repetition of his plea that
other Congressmen opposed to
the war speak out more clearly
with him, presumably meaning

an endorsement of his presi
dential candidacy.
