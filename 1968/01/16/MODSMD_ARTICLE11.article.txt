# Wake Up, McCarthy
## 
### 
Does Eugene McCarthy want to make right
eous speeches or does he want to end the Viet
nam war? The Minnesota Democrat had better
decide quickly, because the kind of perform
ance he gave yesterday at Memorial Auditorium
will do little to further his Presidential candi
dacy.
"Every citizen must become more political,"
McCarthy said in his speech. That's right, Sena
tor, and the first citizen who should become
more political is you. The only threat to Lyn
don Johnson is votes, and votes are won by a
realistic, energetic and frankly political cam
paign.
McCarthy spoke yesterday for 20 minutes on
the folly of continuing our involvement in Viet
nam. He never bothered to mention that he is
on the ballot in the June California primary,
despite the fact that perhaps half his audience
consisted of potential campaign workers. If

McCarthy had explained his campaign strategy
and asked Stanford students for help, he would
have done a good deal more to end the war
than he achieved by telling his audience what
it already knew — that the war is a lousy idea.
McCarthy should be hammering away at the
paralyzing effect of immense war expenditures
on the Administration's domestic programs. In
stead, he merely talked vaguely of "housing"
as a pressing domestic need in response to a
question from the floor.
Americans don't vote for Presidential candi
dates who discuss just one issue. McCarthy must
present a eomprehensive platform. Many things
are wrong with America besides the war, al
though it lies at the root of a good number of
the problems.
McCarthy has a chance to fight and win those
six primaries. If he fails, he will only deepen the
bitter national disillusionment which he hopes
to relieve. —M. S.
