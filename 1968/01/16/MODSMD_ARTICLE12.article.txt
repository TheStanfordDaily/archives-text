## 'Student-Nigger' A False Image 
### 
Editor, the Dally:
I find your editorial, "Student
as Nigger," (Friday, Jan. 12) a
deplorable exercise in bad taste
and muddled thinking. Even
leaving aside the cheap sensa
tionalism of the headline, one
need not be the least bit com
placent about the shortcomings
of present day American uni
versities to find something
peculiarly distasteful in the im
plied analogy between the priv
ileged and on the whole cos
seted students of such institu
tions as Stanford, on the one
hand, and the exploited, ne
glected or hopelessly deprived
residents of the ghetto on the
other.
In fact, your editorial man
aged quite a remarkable feat of
triple insult. You insult the
negro slum-dweller by equating
his problems with those you
may encounter in a badly
taught course or two. You in
sult the faculty by suggesting
that only a minority of them
care about education or deal
honestly ' wit htheir students.
And you insult the student body
by the following incredible
short list of paths to truth:
"Two truths are established:
one is 'what the professor
says' and this is regurgitated
on examinations and in term
papers to appease the great
dispenser of grades. The other
truth is what the student ex
periences outside of class,
what is true to his tongue,
his fingers, his stomach, and
his heart."
I suppose that this is intended
as a kind of "gut reaction" to
the problems of contemporary
education. But demands for edu
cational reform that totally
omit the intellect could scarcely
hope to command attention,
even if they were not couched in
the offensive terms of your edi
torial.

• Good Third Party:
Peace And Freedom?
Editor, the Daily:
The editorial (Monday, Jan.
15) cvomrr.enting on McCarthy,
the Peace and Freedom Party
and other political figures ex
cels in moral enthusiasm but
is sadly deficient in political un
derstanding. It claims that the
Peace and Freedom Party is
"a sham with no real interest
in the political process" betrays
a lack of comprehension of
either McCarthy's candidacy or
the nature of the Peace and
Fredom Party.
The Daily admits to being
"disappointed in his perform
ance so far" without wondering
why he is so mediocre. We
would not suggest that he is
merely a stooge and future VP
for Johnson. Perhaps McCarthy
is sincere.
But in a real sense he is a
stooge for the two party system.
McCarthy's position seems to
be one of dissent before the
Democratic Convention, unity
after the Convention. Such an
attitude denies reality: the war
is not just another issue; it is
a poison in American life.
McCarthy's primary goal

sems to be the survival of the
Democratic coalition. His meth
od of preserving party unity
is an ineffectual certain-to-lose
campaign. This tactic is reminis
cent of Johnson's bag: recog
nize dissent, but don't listen.
In general, Peace and Free
dom members believe that the
broadly aggregative nature of
our present parties may serve
very well when called upon to
build dams and help the middle
class. But just as the American
political system could not solve
the problems of 1860, we believe
that it has not and cannot.solve
the problems of the black com
munity and the reactionary na
ture of American foreign policy.
The Daily's claim that "third
parties are good for show value
and not much else" reveals only
a lack of knowledge of Ameri
can history. We suggest that
The Daily consider the effects
on the party system of such
movements as the Populists, the
Bull Moose Progressives, and
the LaFollette Progressives of
1924.
If the Peace and Freedom
Party can succeed in building an
electoral base, even if only 15 to
20 percent of the electorate, it
will force a realignment in the
positions of the major parties.
The Democrats will have to
move left, or face continual de
feat to the Republicans.
Even on the level of tactics
The Daily is deficient. McCar
thy says he won't run as the
candidate of a third party, but
The Daily says we should sup
port his anyway.
First, we doubt that he wants
our support (who wants an en
dorsement from the "lunatic
left").
And second, when McCarthy
loses the nomination, we would
have no candidate.
If the most likely candidates,
Johnson and Nixon, are the
choice in November, dissident
Democrats will seek a legitimate
alternative. If we get lost in
McCarthy's defeat now, the only
alternative will be Wallace.

• In Defense Of God;
A Reply To Tim Haight
Editor, The Daily:
It is certain that all sensitive
persons must deplore the pres
ent state of hell in Vietnam.
What is not so clear, though, is
who bears responsibility for this
bloody chaos. Tim Haight, in
Friday's "Universal Soldier: The
Living God," first indicts God,
and then, in the very last para
graph, also finds the U.S. remiss
in its duties.
Whether these indictments are
seen as mutually compatible or
whether the U.S.-is to displace
God before the judge's bar is not
quite clear. Should God still be
found among the guilty, how
ever, I would like to say a few
words in His defense.
"Why doesn't He act?" we all
scream at the top of our lungs
But in those more reflective mo
ments we pause to wonder how
we would have Him act. Is it
to be in a blinding thunder
storm of .punitive lightning
against all evil men?
And if He is to act in this

manner, what is to prevent Him
from freezing motionless the
hand of every son of Adam
caught in a lawless deed? This
strikes us as too deep a viola
tion of our individual claims to
initiative and independence of
action. We become impotent,
stripped of our abilities to make
the world what we will it to be.
But if not by violent or direct
action, how then can He act?
And the answer returns like a
gentle breeze blowing through
the willows, whispering incred
ible secrets to those who listen,
telling of things that have been
and things that will be. . . .
This quiet and nearly hidden
action takes full form in an ex
carpenter's life, lived out in ob
scurity in a dusty corner of the
old Roman world. And it con
tinues in the unexpected and
radically transformed life which
a small group of his friends dis
covered after his return from
death.
And like a spreading circular
wave on a placid sea, so his word
goes out to all men, "Come, and
bear your cross with me." And
those who . . . resolve to venture
all for him, find that they are
indeed called upon to suffer with
God in the world, but in that
finding there comes also a grow
ing realization of His living pres
ence in them and a slow trans
formation of their own lives.

• We Win Defend
Our Right To Riot!
Editor, The Daily:
This letter is a protest to the
recent insults launched at the
"95%" (known to some as Stan
ford's noteworthy law students.)
As an unofficial spokesman for
"the 95" I can honestly say that
I resent the accusation that we
engage in food fights on a semi
annual basis. On the contrary,
I can assure you that our food
fights are at least weekly, per
haps nightly, and are waged
with sufficient ferocity and cun
ning so as to evoke a smile from
even such a stem critic as Jus
tice Holmes (ex-general U.S.
Army).
Adrift in a society obsessed
with a mock-heroic sense of self
esteem, and puffed up with an
over-inflated spirit of "meaning
ful behavior and meaningful re
lationships" we of the nation's
upper five per cent have created
a haven where humour, good
cheer, friendship and good times
are sacrosanct. ... I must warn
the outside world that if pro
voked we will counter to protect
our way of life. If there is to
be war let it start here!

• Will The Daily's
ISew Format Continue?
Editor, The Daily:
Often, even unfortunate
events give rise to other, more
fortunate events
The San Francisco newspaper
strike is- an apt example.
The str"ke has provided the
impetus for the Stanford Daily
to put news, real, vital, "it just
happened," news on its front
page. How refreshing, how in
formative, how intelligent, how
utterly fantastically wonderful.
The new format is almost
more hallucinary than LSD. It
really opens up my mind. Hope
fully, it will bring the Daily
down to earth and help open up
its mind to the realities of the
world.
I suggest, even after the
strike ends, that The Daily con
tinue this policy of top story
news coverage. And perhaps
we'll find that the ink of the
first page might soak down to
the editorial page. And perhaps
we'll...

ance so far" without wondering
why he is so mediocre. We
would not suggest that he is
merely a stooge and future VP
for Johnson. Perhaps McCarthy
is sincere.
But in a real sense he is a
stooge for the two party system.
McCarthy's position seems to
be one of dissent before the
Democratic Convention, unity
after the Convention. Such an
attitude denies reality: the war
is not just another issue; it is
a poison in American life.
McCarthy's primary goal

sems to be the survival of the
Democratic coalition. His meth
od of preserving party unity
is an ineffectual certain-to-lose
campaign. This tactic is reminis
cent of Johnson's bag: recog
nize dissent, but don't listen.
In general, Peace and Free
dom members believe that the
broadly aggregative nature of
our present parties may serve
very well when called upon to
build dams and help the middle
class. But just as the American
political system could not solve
the problems of 1860, we believe
that it has not and cannot.solve
the problems of the black com
munity and the reactionary na
ture of American foreign policy.
The Daily's claim that "third
parties are good for show value
and not much else" reveals only
a lack of knowledge of Ameri
can history. We suggest that
The Daily consider the effects
on the party system of such
movements as the Populists, the
Bull Moose Progressives, and
the LaFollette Progressives of
1924.
If the Peace and Freedom
Party can succeed in building an
electoral base, even if only 15 to
20 percent of the electorate, it
will force a realignment in the
positions of the major parties.
The Democrats will have to
move left, or face continual de
feat to the Republicans.
Even on the level of tactics
The Daily is deficient. McCar
thy says he won't run as the
candidate of a third party, but
The Daily says we should sup
port his anyway.
First, we doubt that he wants
our support (who wants an en
dorsement from the "lunatic
left").
And second, when McCarthy
loses the nomination, we would
have no candidate.
If the most likely candidates,
Johnson and Nixon, are the
choice in November, dissident
Democrats will seek a legitimate
alternative. If we get lost in
McCarthy's defeat now, the only
alternative will be Wallace.

• In Defense Of God;
A Reply To Tim Haight
Editor, The Daily:
It is certain that all sensitive
persons must deplore the pres
ent state of hell in Vietnam.
What is not so clear, though, is
who bears responsibility for this
bloody chaos. Tim Haight, in
Friday's "Universal Soldier: The
Living God," first indicts God,
and then, in the very last para
graph, also finds the U.S. remiss
in its duties.
Whether these indictments are
seen as mutually compatible or
whether the U.S.-is to displace
God before the judge's bar is not
quite clear. Should God still be
found among the guilty, how
ever, I would like to say a few
words in His defense.
"Why doesn't He act?" we all
scream at the top of our lungs
But in those more reflective mo
ments we pause to wonder how
we would have Him act. Is it
to be in a blinding thunder
storm of .punitive lightning
against all evil men?
And if He is to act in this

manner, what is to prevent Him
from freezing motionless the
hand of every son of Adam
caught in a lawless deed? This
strikes us as too deep a viola
tion of our individual claims to
initiative and independence of
action. We become impotent,
stripped of our abilities to make
the world what we will it to be.
But if not by violent or direct
action, how then can He act?
And the answer returns like a
gentle breeze blowing through
the willows, whispering incred
ible secrets to those who listen,
telling of things that have been
and things that will be. . . .
This quiet and nearly hidden
action takes full form in an ex
carpenter's life, lived out in ob
scurity in a dusty corner of the
old Roman world. And it con
tinues in the unexpected and
radically transformed life which
a small group of his friends dis
covered after his return from
death.
And like a spreading circular
wave on a placid sea, so his word
goes out to all men, "Come, and
bear your cross with me." And
those who . . . resolve to venture
all for him, find that they are
indeed called upon to suffer with
God in the world, but in that
finding there comes also a grow
ing realization of His living pres
ence in them and a slow trans
formation of their own lives.

I find your editorial, "Student

deplorable exercise in bad taste
and muddled thinking. Even
leaving aside the cheap sensa
tionalism of the headline, one
need not be the least bit com
placent about the shortcomings
of present day American uni
versities to find something
peculiarly distasteful in the im
plied analogy between the priv
ileged and on the whole cos
seted students of such institu
tions as Stanford, on the one
hand, and the exploited, ne
glected or hopelessly deprived
residents of the ghetto on the
other.
In fact, your editorial man
aged quite a remarkable feat of
triple insult. You insult the
negro slum-dweller by equating
his problems with those you
may encounter in a badly
taught course or two. You in
sult the faculty by suggesting
that only a minority of them
care about education or deal
honestly ' wit htheir students.
And you insult the student body
by the following incredible
short list of paths to truth:
"Two truths are established:
one is 'what the professor
says' and this is regurgitated
on examinations and in term
papers to appease the great
dispenser of grades. The other
truth is what the student ex
periences outside of class,
what is true to his tongue,
his fingers, his stomach, and
his heart."
I suppose that this is intended
as a kind of "gut reaction" to
the problems of contemporary
education. But demands for edu

• In Defense Of God;
A Reply To Tim Haight
Editor, The Daily:
It is certain that all sensitive
persons must deplore the pres
ent state of hell in Vietnam.
What is not so clear, though, is
who bears responsibility for this
bloody chaos. Tim Haight, in
Friday's "Universal Soldier: The
Living God," first indicts God,
and then, in the very last para
graph, also finds the U.S. remiss
in its duties.
Whether these indictments are
seen as mutually compatible or
whether the U.S.-is to displace
God before the judge's bar is not
quite clear. Should God still be
found among the guilty, how
ever, I would like to say a few
words in His defense.
"Why doesn't He act?" we all
scream at the top of our lungs
But in those more reflective mo
ments we pause to wonder how
we would have Him act. Is it
to be in a blinding thunder
storm of .punitive lightning
against all evil men?
And if He is to act in this

manner, what is to prevent Him
from freezing motionless the
hand of every son of Adam
caught in a lawless deed? This
strikes us as too deep a viola
tion of our individual claims to
initiative and independence of
action. We become impotent,
stripped of our abilities to make
the world what we will it to be.
But if not by violent or direct
action, how then can He act?
And the answer returns like a
gentle breeze blowing through
the willows, whispering incred
ible secrets to those who listen,
telling of things that have been
and things that will be. . . .
This quiet and nearly hidden
action takes full form in an ex
carpenter's life, lived out in ob
scurity in a dusty corner of the
old Roman world. And it con
tinues in the unexpected and
radically transformed life which
a small group of his friends dis
covered after his return from
death.
And like a spreading circular
wave on a placid sea, so his word
goes out to all men, "Come, and
bear your cross with me." And
those who . . . resolve to venture
all for him, find that they are
indeed called upon to suffer with
God in the world, but in that
finding there comes also a grow
ing realization of His living pres
ence in them and a slow trans
formation of their own lives.

Editor, The Daily:

fully, it will bring the Daily

its mind to the realities of the
world.
I suggest, even after the

I find your editorial, "Student
as Nigger," (Friday, Jan. 12) a
deplorable exercise in bad taste
and muddled thinking. Even
leaving aside the cheap sensa
tionalism of the headline, one
need not be the least bit com
placent about the shortcomings
of present day American uni
versities to find something
peculiarly distasteful in the im
plied analogy between the priv
ileged and on the whole cos
seted students of such institu
tions as Stanford, on the one
hand, and the exploited, ne
glected or hopelessly deprived
residents of the ghetto on the
other.
In fact, your editorial man
aged quite a remarkable feat of
triple insult. You insult the
negro slum-dweller by equating
his problems with those you
may encounter in a badly
taught course or two. You in
sult the faculty by suggesting
that only a minority of them
care about education or deal
honestly ' wit htheir students.
And you insult the student body
by the following incredible
short list of paths to truth:
"Two truths are established:
one is 'what the professor
says' and this is regurgitated
on examinations and in term
papers to appease the great
dispenser of grades. The other
truth is what the student ex
periences outside of class,
what is true to his tongue,
his fingers, his stomach, and
his heart."
I suppose that this is intended
as a kind of "gut reaction" to
the problems of contemporary
education. But demands for edu
cational reform that totally
omit the intellect could scarcely
hope to command attention,
even if they were not couched in
the offensive terms of your edi

• Good Third Party:
Peace And Freedom?
Editor, the Daily:
The editorial (Monday, Jan.
15) cvomrr.enting on McCarthy,
the Peace and Freedom Party
and other political figures ex
cels in moral enthusiasm but
is sadly deficient in political un
derstanding. It claims that the
Peace and Freedom Party is
"a sham with no real interest
in the political process" betrays
a lack of comprehension of
either McCarthy's candidacy or
the nature of the Peace and
Fredom Party.
The Daily admits to being
"disappointed in his perform
ance so far" without wondering
why he is so mediocre. We
would not suggest that he is
merely a stooge and future VP
for Johnson. Perhaps McCarthy
is sincere.
But in a real sense he is a
stooge for the two party system.
McCarthy's position seems to
be one of dissent before the
Democratic Convention, unity
after the Convention. Such an
attitude denies reality: the war
is not just another issue; it is
a poison in American life.
McCarthy's primary goal

sems to be the survival of the
Democratic coalition. His meth
od of preserving party unity
is an ineffectual certain-to-lose
campaign. This tactic is reminis
cent of Johnson's bag: recog
nize dissent, but don't listen.
In general, Peace and Free
dom members believe that the
broadly aggregative nature of
our present parties may serve
very well when called upon to
build dams and help the middle
class. But just as the American
political system could not solve
the problems of 1860, we believe
that it has not and cannot.solve
the problems of the black com
munity and the reactionary na
ture of American foreign policy.
The Daily's claim that "third
parties are good for show value
and not much else" reveals only
a lack of knowledge of Ameri
can history. We suggest that
The Daily consider the effects
on the party system of such
movements as the Populists, the
Bull Moose Progressives, and
the LaFollette Progressives of
1924.
If the Peace and Freedom
Party can succeed in building an
electoral base, even if only 15 to
20 percent of the electorate, it
will force a realignment in the
positions of the major parties.
The Democrats will have to
move left, or face continual de
feat to the Republicans.
Even on the level of tactics
The Daily is deficient. McCar
thy says he won't run as the
candidate of a third party, but
The Daily says we should sup
port his anyway.
First, we doubt that he wants
our support (who wants an en
dorsement from the "lunatic
left").
And second, when McCarthy
loses the nomination, we would
have no candidate.
If the most likely candidates,
Johnson and Nixon, are the
choice in November, dissident
Democrats will seek a legitimate
alternative. If we get lost in
McCarthy's defeat now, the only

I find your editorial, "Student

deplorable exercise in bad taste
and muddled thinking. Even
leaving aside the cheap sensa
tionalism of the headline, one
need not be the least bit com
placent about the shortcomings
of present day American uni
versities to find something
peculiarly distasteful in the im
plied analogy between the priv
ileged and on the whole cos
seted students of such institu
tions as Stanford, on the one
hand, and the exploited, ne
glected or hopelessly deprived
residents of the ghetto on the
other.
In fact, your editorial man
aged quite a remarkable feat of
triple insult. You insult the
negro slum-dweller by equating
his problems with those you
may encounter in a badly
taught course or two. You in
sult the faculty by suggesting
that only a minority of them
care about education or deal
honestly ' wit htheir students.
And you insult the student body
by the following incredible
short list of paths to truth:
"Two truths are established:
one is 'what the professor
says' and this is regurgitated
on examinations and in term
papers to appease the great
dispenser of grades. The other
truth is what the student ex
periences outside of class,
what is true to his tongue,
his fingers, his stomach, and
his heart."
I suppose that this is intended
as a kind of "gut reaction" to
the problems of contemporary
education. But demands for edu

omit the intellect could scarcely

even if they were not couched in

• Good Third Party:
Peace And Freedom?
Editor, the Daily:
The editorial (Monday, Jan.
15) cvomrr.enting on McCarthy,
the Peace and Freedom Party
and other political figures ex
cels in moral enthusiasm but
is sadly deficient in political un
derstanding. It claims that the
Peace and Freedom Party is
"a sham with no real interest
in the political process" betrays
a lack of comprehension of
either McCarthy's candidacy or
the nature of the Peace and
Fredom Party.
The Daily admits to being
"disappointed in his perform
ance so far" without wondering
why he is so mediocre. We
would not suggest that he is
merely a stooge and future VP
for Johnson. Perhaps McCarthy
is sincere.
But in a real sense he is a
stooge for the two party system.
McCarthy's position seems to
be one of dissent before the
Democratic Convention, unity
after the Convention. Such an
attitude denies reality: the war
is not just another issue; it is
a poison in American life.
McCarthy's primary goal

sems to be the survival of the
Democratic coalition. His meth
od of preserving party unity
is an ineffectual certain-to-lose
campaign. This tactic is reminis
cent of Johnson's bag: recog
nize dissent, but don't listen.
In general, Peace and Free
dom members believe that the
broadly aggregative nature of
our present parties may serve
very well when called upon to
build dams and help the middle
class. But just as the American
political system could not solve
the problems of 1860, we believe
that it has not and cannot.solve
the problems of the black com
munity and the reactionary na
ture of American foreign policy.
The Daily's claim that "third
parties are good for show value
and not much else" reveals only
a lack of knowledge of Ameri
can history. We suggest that
The Daily consider the effects
on the party system of such
movements as the Populists, the
Bull Moose Progressives, and
the LaFollette Progressives of
1924.
If the Peace and Freedom
Party can succeed in building an
electoral base, even if only 15 to
20 percent of the electorate, it
will force a realignment in the
positions of the major parties.
The Democrats will have to
move left, or face continual de
feat to the Republicans.
Even on the level of tactics
The Daily is deficient. McCar
thy says he won't run as the
candidate of a third party, but
The Daily says we should sup
port his anyway.
First, we doubt that he wants
our support (who wants an en
dorsement from the "lunatic
left").
And second, when McCarthy
loses the nomination, we would
have no candidate.
If the most likely candidates,
Johnson and Nixon, are the
choice in November, dissident
Democrats will seek a legitimate
alternative. If we get lost in
McCarthy's defeat now, the only
alternative will be Wallace.

• In Defense Of God;
A Reply To Tim Haight
Editor, The Daily:
It is certain that all sensitive
persons must deplore the pres
ent state of hell in Vietnam.
What is not so clear, though, is
who bears responsibility for this
bloody chaos. Tim Haight, in
Friday's "Universal Soldier: The
Living God," first indicts God,
and then, in the very last para
graph, also finds the U.S. remiss
in its duties.
Whether these indictments are
seen as mutually compatible or
whether the U.S.-is to displace
God before the judge's bar is not
quite clear. Should God still be
found among the guilty, how
ever, I would like to say a few
words in His defense.
"Why doesn't He act?" we all
scream at the top of our lungs
But in those more reflective mo
ments we pause to wonder how
we would have Him act. Is it
to be in a blinding thunder
storm of .punitive lightning
against all evil men?
And if He is to act in this

manner, what is to prevent Him
from freezing motionless the
hand of every son of Adam
caught in a lawless deed? This
strikes us as too deep a viola
tion of our individual claims to
initiative and independence of
action. We become impotent,
stripped of our abilities to make
the world what we will it to be.
But if not by violent or direct
action, how then can He act?
And the answer returns like a
gentle breeze blowing through
the willows, whispering incred
ible secrets to those who listen,
telling of things that have been
and things that will be. . . .
This quiet and nearly hidden
action takes full form in an ex
carpenter's life, lived out in ob
scurity in a dusty corner of the
old Roman world. And it con
tinues in the unexpected and
radically transformed life which
a small group of his friends dis
covered after his return from
death.
And like a spreading circular
wave on a placid sea, so his word
goes out to all men, "Come, and
bear your cross with me." And
those who . . . resolve to venture
all for him, find that they are
indeed called upon to suffer with
God in the world, but in that
finding there comes also a grow
ing realization of His living pres
ence in them and a slow trans
formation of their own lives.

Editor, the Dally:
I find your editorial, "Student
as Nigger," (Friday, Jan. 12) a
deplorable exercise in bad taste
and muddled thinking. Even
leaving aside the cheap sensa
tionalism of the headline, one
need not be the least bit com
placent about the shortcomings
of present day American uni
versities to find something
peculiarly distasteful in the im
plied analogy between the priv
ileged and on the whole cos
seted students of such institu
tions as Stanford, on the one
hand, and the exploited, ne
glected or hopelessly deprived
residents of the ghetto on the
other.
In fact, your editorial man
aged quite a remarkable feat of
triple insult. You insult the
negro slum-dweller by equating
his problems with those you
may encounter in a badly
taught course or two. You in
sult the faculty by suggesting
that only a minority of them
care about education or deal
honestly ' wit htheir students.
And you insult the student body
by the following incredible
short list of paths to truth:
"Two truths are established:
one is 'what the professor
says' and this is regurgitated
on examinations and in term
papers to appease the great
dispenser of grades. The other
truth is what the student ex
periences outside of class,
what is true to his tongue,
his fingers, his stomach, and
his heart."
I suppose that this is intended
as a kind of "gut reaction" to
the problems of contemporary
education. But demands for edu
cational reform that totally
omit the intellect could scarcely
hope to command attention,
even if they were not couched in
the offensive terms of your edi
torial.

• Good Third Party:
Peace And Freedom?
Editor, the Daily:
The editorial (Monday, Jan.
15) cvomrr.enting on McCarthy,
the Peace and Freedom Party
and other political figures ex
cels in moral enthusiasm but
is sadly deficient in political un
derstanding. It claims that the
Peace and Freedom Party is
"a sham with no real interest
in the political process" betrays
a lack of comprehension of
either McCarthy's candidacy or
the nature of the Peace and
Fredom Party.
The Daily admits to being
"disappointed in his perform
ance so far" without wondering
why he is so mediocre. We
would not suggest that he is
merely a stooge and future VP
for Johnson. Perhaps McCarthy
is sincere.
But in a real sense he is a
stooge for the two party system.
McCarthy's position seems to
be one of dissent before the
Democratic Convention, unity
after the Convention. Such an
attitude denies reality: the war
is not just another issue; it is
a poison in American life.
McCarthy's primary goal

sems to be the survival of the
Democratic coalition. His meth
od of preserving party unity
is an ineffectual certain-to-lose
campaign. This tactic is reminis
cent of Johnson's bag: recog
nize dissent, but don't listen.
In general, Peace and Free
dom members believe that the
broadly aggregative nature of
our present parties may serve
very well when called upon to
build dams and help the middle
class. But just as the American
political system could not solve
the problems of 1860, we believe
that it has not and cannot.solve
the problems of the black com
munity and the reactionary na
ture of American foreign policy.
The Daily's claim that "third
parties are good for show value
and not much else" reveals only
a lack of knowledge of Ameri
can history. We suggest that
The Daily consider the effects
on the party system of such
movements as the Populists, the
Bull Moose Progressives, and
the LaFollette Progressives of
1924.
If the Peace and Freedom
Party can succeed in building an
electoral base, even if only 15 to
20 percent of the electorate, it
will force a realignment in the
positions of the major parties.
The Democrats will have to
move left, or face continual de
feat to the Republicans.
Even on the level of tactics
The Daily is deficient. McCar
thy says he won't run as the
candidate of a third party, but
The Daily says we should sup
port his anyway.
First, we doubt that he wants
our support (who wants an en
dorsement from the "lunatic
left").
And second, when McCarthy
loses the nomination, we would
have no candidate.
If the most likely candidates,
Johnson and Nixon, are the
choice in November, dissident
Democrats will seek a legitimate
alternative. If we get lost in
McCarthy's defeat now, the only
alternative will be Wallace.

• In Defense Of God;
A Reply To Tim Haight
Editor, The Daily:
It is certain that all sensitive
persons must deplore the pres
ent state of hell in Vietnam.
What is not so clear, though, is
who bears responsibility for this
bloody chaos. Tim Haight, in
Friday's "Universal Soldier: The
Living God," first indicts God,
and then, in the very last para
graph, also finds the U.S. remiss
in its duties.
Whether these indictments are
seen as mutually compatible or
whether the U.S.-is to displace
God before the judge's bar is not
quite clear. Should God still be
found among the guilty, how
ever, I would like to say a few
words in His defense.
"Why doesn't He act?" we all
scream at the top of our lungs
But in those more reflective mo
ments we pause to wonder how
we would have Him act. Is it
to be in a blinding thunder
storm of .punitive lightning
against all evil men?
And if He is to act in this

manner, what is to prevent Him
from freezing motionless the
hand of every son of Adam
caught in a lawless deed? This
strikes us as too deep a viola
tion of our individual claims to
initiative and independence of
action. We become impotent,
stripped of our abilities to make
the world what we will it to be.
But if not by violent or direct
action, how then can He act?
And the answer returns like a
gentle breeze blowing through
the willows, whispering incred
ible secrets to those who listen,
telling of things that have been
and things that will be. . . .
This quiet and nearly hidden
action takes full form in an ex
carpenter's life, lived out in ob
scurity in a dusty corner of the
old Roman world. And it con
tinues in the unexpected and
radically transformed life which
a small group of his friends dis
covered after his return from
death.
And like a spreading circular
wave on a placid sea, so his word
goes out to all men, "Come, and
bear your cross with me." And
those who . . . resolve to venture
all for him, find that they are
indeed called upon to suffer with
God in the world, but in that
finding there comes also a grow
ing realization of His living pres
ence in them and a slow trans
formation of their own lives.

• We Win Defend
Our Right To Riot!
Editor, The Daily:
This letter is a protest to the
recent insults launched at the
"95%" (known to some as Stan
ford's noteworthy law students.)
As an unofficial spokesman for
"the 95" I can honestly say that
I resent the accusation that we
engage in food fights on a semi
annual basis. On the contrary,
I can assure you that our food
fights are at least weekly, per
haps nightly, and are waged
with sufficient ferocity and cun
ning so as to evoke a smile from
even such a stem critic as Jus
tice Holmes (ex-general U.S.
Army).
Adrift in a society obsessed
with a mock-heroic sense of self
esteem, and puffed up with an
over-inflated spirit of "meaning
ful behavior and meaningful re
lationships" we of the nation's
upper five per cent have created
a haven where humour, good
cheer, friendship and good times
are sacrosanct. ... I must warn
the outside world that if pro
voked we will counter to protect
our way of life. If there is to
be war let it start here!

• Will The Daily's
ISew Format Continue?
Editor, The Daily:
Often, even unfortunate
events give rise to other, more
fortunate events
The San Francisco newspaper
strike is- an apt example.
The str"ke has provided the
impetus for the Stanford Daily
to put news, real, vital, "it just
happened," news on its front
page. How refreshing, how in
formative, how intelligent, how
utterly fantastically wonderful.
The new format is almost
more hallucinary than LSD. It
really opens up my mind. Hope
fully, it will bring the Daily
down to earth and help open up
its mind to the realities of the
world.
I suggest, even after the
