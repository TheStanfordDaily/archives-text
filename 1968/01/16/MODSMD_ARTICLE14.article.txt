# The 						Capitol Scene
## Rusk Unsafe In Any U.S. City 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON—Secretary of
State Dean Rusk has one of the
toughest jobs in the world. Just
the other day one of his aides
reported to him:
"Sir, all the arrangements
have been made for your trip.
There will be troops all along
the road from the airport into
town. No advance notice is be
ing given of your arrival. You
will be traveling under the name
of Mr. James Smith, a business

consultant. When you arrive in
town you will be whisked off
to the hotel and you won't leave
until the conference is over.
Then we will take you by heli
copter back to the airport be
fore the local press finds out
you were there."
"What country am I going
to?" Rusk asked.
"No country," his aide replied.
"You're going to San Fran
cisco."
No Trouble Abroad
"I was afraid of that," the
secretary said. "Is it going to be
bad?"
"We can't tell, so we have to
take precautions. You see, if
you were going abroad we
wouldn't have problems. If
there were any demonstrations
against you, we could always
protest to the unfriendly na
tion's state department. But
when they have demonstrations
against you in the United
States, we have no one to pro
test to but ourselves."
"I guess there's not much
satisfaction in that," the secre
tary said. "Did Vice President
Humphrey get back from Afri
ca?"
Watch Out In Chicago
"Yes, sir. It was a very suc
cessful trip. There were a few
sporadic incidents in the Congo
but they didn't amount to any
thing. We're a little worried
now, though."
"Why?"
"He has to go to Chicago next
week."
"Poor Hubert. He should have
stayed in Africa."
The CIA Nervous?
"That's what we told him. But
he said he'd go anywhere any
time to defend the President's
Vietnam policies, so it was very
hard for him to refuse to go to
Chicago."
"What are the latest reports
from New Haven?"
"The CIA is nervous."
"Why is that?"
"Yale is talking about giving
you an honorary degree."
Correspondence Degree
"That's serious. How do we
get out of it?"

"Well, if it goes through,
we're going to ask them to mail
it to you."
"But won't it look bad if the
secretary of state of the United
States can't go to New Haven?"
"We thought of that and
we're trying to work out a trip
for you to the Soviet Union or
Cyprus, where you'll be safe.
We figure if you go abroad at
that time, nobody will wonder
why you didn't go to New
Haven."
Not Immune In USA
"Aren't there any safe cities
in the United States I can go
to this year?"
"The CIA can't find any, but
then you have to remember, sir,
there's a war on."
"I'm aware of that," the sec
retary said, "but it seems to me
that a cabinet officer should be

free to travel in his own coun
try."
"You would think so, sir. But,
you see, your American pass
port only protects you when
you're abroad. You have no dip
lomatic immunity in the United
States, and from all we can
gather, the people in this coun
try are not very friendly right
now, particularly during an
election year."
"Well, what am I going to do
about this invitation to speak
in New York next month?" the
secretary asked.
"We've arranged for you tc
give the talk on the battleship
New Jersey in fhe Hudson
River. In that way if the natives
start acting up we can always
weigh anchor and get the heck
out of there."
