# Summer Is Coming; Test Your Riot I.Q.
## 
### PETER M. DOLINGER 
Believe it or not, the days are getting longer, the weather warmer,
fewer frosts plague your garden. We'll keep it in mind to tide us
over the rains: summer is coming. The beach parties, the evening
sun, the riots . . . they're all just a few months away. At this point
there's nothing anyone can do to stop the riots, but we can try to
make our social conversations about them as informed as possible
See how well you match wits with sociologists at UCLA and in
vestigators for the Detroit Free Press in this true-false test:
1. Most Negroes think the riots actually hurt the
Negro cause T F
2. Only a small minority of the Negro population
participates in riots. T F
3. When the riot is over, most participants are ashamed. . T F
4. More integration will prevent future riots T F
5. Police brutality is not an important factor
contributing to riots. T F
6. Riots oould be prevented by increased funds for
anti-poverty and slum clearance programs. T F
Bonus question: The less education and money a Negro
has, the more probable that he will participate
In a riot T F
Answers: If you haven't seen the pattern by now, they're all false
Here's what several polls and surveys involving thousands of blacks
in riots areas of Los Angeles and Detroit found:
1. In Los Angeles, about 40 per cent of blacks polled thought the
riots had "helped the Negro cause." Only 20 per cent felt the riot
had "hurt" the cause. Another poll in Watts showed that about 50
per cent of the people interviewed thought the 1965 riot had helped
blacks in their search for "equality in jobs, schools, and housing."
2 and 3. In Los Angeles, 25 per cent of the people in the 4?
square mile area ("Watts"?) participated in the 1965 riot, and 57
per cent felt "more pride in being a Negro" after the riot.
4. Sociologists at UCLA concluded that "continued contact with
white persons by those Negroes who have made economic gains
would serve to increase their impatience and frustration at not be
ing able to enjoy the same . . . opportunities taken for granted by
white persons..."
5. In Detroit, police brutality was ranked number one cause of
riots by participants; in Watts, 75 per cent believed that police beat
up Negroes in custody.
6. Detroit was receiving the most per capita federal anti-poverty
aid when that riot, the worst so far, broke out last summer. The
same pattern was repeated a few weeks later in New Haven.
Bonus question: In Los Angeles, differences in participation fre
quency between the best-heeled and worst-heeled ghetto dwellers
were not significant. Even in the best Watts neighborhood, where
the median income was $6600, years of schooling 11.7, and 47 per
cent of the workers had white-collar jobs, over 16 per cent partici
pated "moderately" or "actively" in the riots. The UCLA report
concluded that "... a significant number of Negroes, successful or
unsuccessful, are emotionally prepared for violence as a strategy
... to end the problems of segregation, exploitation, and subordina
tion."
In the more recent Detroit riots, this finding was even more pro
nounced. Participation frequency was not affected by differences
of inpome level which ranged between $2,000 and $10,000!
The conclusion was that "... the most aggrieved (Negroes) are
those who have begun to overcome traditional barriers but who
are impatient with the yet existing constraints upon them." And
at the Lemburg Center for the Study of Violence at Brandels Uni
versity, sociologists concluded that middle class Negroes are begin
ning the align with the militants.
If your riot I.Q. was low, don't despair; some very Important peo
ple would have done miserably. In an address before the Interna
tional Association of Chiefs of Police last September, Lyndon John
son said that the riots were the work of "wretched, vulgar men"
and "poisonous propagandists." The studies showed rather conclu
sively that the only special thing about the rioters was their color,
and that 40 per cent of them were women!
Johnson did take prompt action, however. He introduced a "Safe
Streets and Crime Control" bill (passed House, awaits Senate ac
tion) which would provide for federal funds for anti-riot equipment
and training to be used at the states' discretion. (Could there be a
better way to aggravate the situation?)
Other people don't think the riots are amenable to logical ana
lysis. Sam Yorty decided that places of rioting are "not logical from
the standpoint of the grievances of the Negro people." He went on
to say that "Los Angeles is the best city for Negroes . . . living con
ditions are much better than most cities in the East ..." Yorty
put the cap on the problem by concluding: "We do have areas where
only Negroes reside, and, of course, we have white ghettos, too,
where only white people reside ..."
Funny how they never riot in those white ghettos.
