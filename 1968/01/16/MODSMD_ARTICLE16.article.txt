# 3 Stanford Draft Foes Ordered For Induction
## 
### 
Three Stanford students have
been ordered for induction into
the Army because they turned in
their draft cards, during pro
tests late last year.
At least four other Stanford
students have received "delin
quency notices" from their draft
boards because they refuse to
carry draft cards. Draft delin
quents are reclassified 1-A and
immediately inducted.
The three with induction ord
ers are Jeff Browning, a junior;
Richard Baxstresser, a sopho
more; and Mark Riley, a clas
sics graduate student. All say
they will refuse to be drafted
and instead face prosecution un
der the Selective Service Act.
The students are associated
with the Resistance, a nation
wide anti-draft organization.

Resistance leader David Har
ris, former ASSU president at
Stanford, has announced plans
to refuse his scheduled induc
tion at 7 a.m. tomorrow In
Oakland.
Crackdown on Resisters
The crackdown on draft resis
ters has followed Selective Ser
vice Director Lewis Hershey's
letter of Oct. 26 to draft boards,
asking them to withdraw pro
testors' deferments.
Hershey estimated Dec. 29 that
about 700 draft cards had been
turned in across the country.
Local Resistance workers claim
that 300 persons have refused
to carry draft cards in the Bay
Area alone. Many of the cards
were given to Federal officials at
San Francisco rallies in October,
November and December.
The maximum penalty for vio
lating the draft law is five years
in jail and a $10,000 fine. But 18
months has been the average
sentence in the Bay Area, ac
cording to Mark Silverman of
the Stanford Resistance.
A surprisingly light sentence
— six months in jail and 18
months probation — was given
Friday to Resistance member
Bill Fischer by a federal dis
trict court in San Jose.
Nationwide, 952 men were
convicted In 1967 of draft law
violations, with an average
prison term of 32.1 months.
These figures were released
Friday by U.S. Attorney Gen
eral Ramsey Clark.
Harris and the three Stanford
students ordered for induction
anticipate extended legal action
before they receive jail sen
tences.
Riley has asked that his in
duction be shifted from North
Carolina to the Oakland draft
district, which includes Stanford.
His request is being processed
and no date is set for his Oak
land induction. Riley sent in his
draft card in September, and re
ceived induction orders over
Christmas vacation.
Browning turned in his draft
card at the Oct. 16 demonstra
tion. He received his induction
orders Thursday, and asked for
a transfer of his induction, origi
nally set for Jan. 25, from Phoe
nix to Oakland.
Fourth Turn-In
i Baxstresser believes his
Orange County draft board
learned of his protest activities
through newspaper stories. Af
ter FBI investigations and an
unsuccessful request for con

scientious objector (CO) status,
Baxstresser turned in his draft
card for the fourth time at a
Nov. 16 rally. He was ordered
for induction Jan. 24, but has
requested a transfer to Oakland.
Baxstresser says he will legal
ly contest induction because of
alleged irregularities in his
draft board's handling of his
CO oppeal.
"Going to jail is not really
so great a thing," Baxstresser
commented. "Maybe a legal de
fense can hurt the draft more."
Riley and Browning also plan
to consult lawyers when they
refuse induction. Browning says
he is concerned that the govern
ment might arrest him for not
carrying a draft card, as well
as for refusing induction.
Harris, who first turned In
his draft card to his Fresno
board almost a year ago, plans
to speak at a protest rally to
morrow morning after refus
ing to enter the Oakland induc
tion center on Clay street. Cars
will leave from the Stanford
bookstore parking lot at 5:30
a.m., according to Silverman.
Robert McAfee Brown, Stan
ford religion professor, refused
last week to answer questions
by FBI agents regarding his anti
draft statements. Brown has ex
pressed support for Dr. Benja
min Spock and four others in
dicted Jan. 5 for counselling
draft resistance.
