# West Coast Premiere
## Denizens Abound In 'Dance' 
### ROBERT EGAN 
The production of William
Hanley's Slow Dance On the
Killing Ground, currently at the
Manhattan Playhouse (Manhat
tan and W. Bayshore), Fridays
and Saturdays, is an electrify
ing evening of theatre. The play
itself may be one of the finest
of the sixties, and this produc
tion, a West Coast premiere, is
excellent.
The Killing Ground is the
world at large—New York, spe
■« cifically- the "dance" takes
place on an unlit street in
Brooklyn in the temporary back
water of a candy store owned by
Glas, an aging German refugee.
Into it wander Randall, a black
teenage genius who has just
murdered his prostitute mother,
and Rosie, a pregnant N.Y.U.
coed on her way to an abortion.
In the interval that they are
> together, each of these three is
challenged, and ultimately as
; sisted, by the other two to con
front the truth of his own ex
istence as a denizen of the Kill
} ing Ground.
Each is responsible for the
destruction of life. Randall has
knifed his mother, Glas has
' abandoned his Jewish wife and
i son to the Nazis, and Rosie is

about to destroy her unborn
child.
In each case there are reasons
—compelling reasons. Randall is
caught and torn in the insane
paradoxes of a warped society;
Glas was deluded by his Com
munist ideals, later shattered by
the Hitler-Stalin pact; and Rosie
relies on a common morality:
"What does it matter! It hap
pens every day, right?"
But each is brought to
acknowledge the element of
choice in his fate, and the re
sponsibility he must bear for
that choice: "We choose the
dark streets up which we walk.
We choose them. And if we
are guilty of the denial of life,
who is there to save us from
that but ourselves?" They part
with whatever salvation self
knowledge can bring: Randall
and Glas to the certain ends of
sudden death and a life of guilt.
But Rosie remains hesitating
at the head of her dark street,
one which she may never walk
(Hanley wisely avoids melo
drama by leaving her decision
suspended).
Such a play places a heavy
burden on its actors if it is
to be rendered even plausible.
Director Judith Dresch's cast
makes it sing.

Leonard Simon's performance
as Randall is a self-contained
ballet. He is in almost constant
motion from blackout to black
out, moving with a dancer's
grace, a panther's menace.
The role is a particularly chal
lenging one, since the character
consists of two complete per
sonalities—a jive-talking street
bop and an articulate, tortured
intellectual—alternating contin
ually in a "self-induced schizo
phrenia."
Simon meets the challenge
more than half-way, raising
Randall from an initial level of
dangerous and comic fascination
to the stature, ultimat ly, of a
tragic hero: fully aware of his
doom and confronting it un
flinchingly.
Diana Ewing is, in terms of
her physical type, a ready-made
ingenue, and such actresses fre
quently have difficulty breaking
out of the mold.
The value of her performance
is enhanced, then, by the fact
that she brings Rosie—a homely
Jewish girl from the Bronx and
definitely no ingenue—beauti
fully and achingly alive, convey
ing both her facade of soph
moric intellectualism and, when
that crumples, a deep innocence
and sincerity of feeling. The
narration of her seduction in a
New Rochelle attic is at once
terribly funny and terribly sad.
The role of Glas, while the
least spectacular of the three,

may well be the most import
ant. His constant presence must
provide a unifying matrix—a
background against which the
bright colors of Randall and
Rosie flash and fade.
Chorus as well as protagonist,
it is Glas who finally articul
lates what the three have
learned about their dark streets.
William Chestnut is an accomp
lished and obviously seasoned
actor, and his performance is
masterful.
I was most impressed by his
ability to act by understate
ment: to express years of agony
and worlds of meaning by a
shrug, a suppressed quaver in
the voice, even a silence.
Three such talented actors
might well have turned in three
separate theatrical tours de
force, but Mrs. Dresch's direc
tion has molded their perform
ances into a unified, coherent
work of art. This is no virtuoso
showcase but some of the finest
ensemble acting I have seen.
One of the more impressive
aspects of her direction is a con
sistent attempt to involve her
audience. The longer speeches
are frequently addressed out
ward, and when she has Randall
speak directly to the audience
as the "jury" of Glas' mock
trial, her technique works beau
tifully.
In short, then, this production
is undoubtedly one of the best
now in the Bay Area. It should
be seen.


Dr. David Smith of the Halght-
Ashbury Medical Clinic will
speak Wednesday at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium about
his efforts to cope with the med
ieval problems of San Francisco's
hippie drug 1 culture.
The 28-year-old doctor has re
ceived much local and national
attention for his work. His ex
periences in the Haight district
have convinced him that "sci
entific facts are the best antidote
to drug myths ..." and that
drug problems should be treat
ed as medical rather than police
concerns. Dr. Smith was trained
in toxicology and pharmacy at
the University of California
School of Medicine. He is cur
rently involved in pharmacologi
cal research.

to the stature, ultimat ly, of a
tragic hero: fully aware of his
doom and confronting it un
flinchingly.
Diana Ewing is, in terms of
her physical type, a ready-made
ingenue, and such actresses fre
quently have difficulty breaking
out of the mold.
The value of her performance
is enhanced, then, by the fact
that she brings Rosie—a homely
Jewish girl from the Bronx and
definitely no ingenue—beauti
fully and achingly alive, convey
ing both her facade of soph
moric intellectualism and, when
that crumples, a deep innocence
and sincerity of feeling. The
narration of her seduction in a
New Rochelle attic is at once
terribly funny and terribly sad.
The role of Glas, while the
least spectacular of the three,

may well be the most import
ant. His constant presence must
provide a unifying matrix—a
background against which the
bright colors of Randall and
Rosie flash and fade.
Chorus as well as protagonist,
it is Glas who finally articul
lates what the three have
learned about their dark streets.
William Chestnut is an accomp
lished and obviously seasoned
actor, and his performance is
masterful.
I was most impressed by his
ability to act by understate
ment: to express years of agony
and worlds of meaning by a
shrug, a suppressed quaver in
the voice, even a silence.
Three such talented actors
might well have turned in three
separate theatrical tours de
force, but Mrs. Dresch's direc
tion has molded their perform
ances into a unified, coherent
work of art. This is no virtuoso
showcase but some of the finest
ensemble acting I have seen.
One of the more impressive
aspects of her direction is a con
sistent attempt to involve her
audience. The longer speeches
are frequently addressed out
ward, and when she has Randall
speak directly to the audience
as the "jury" of Glas' mock
trial, her technique works beau
tifully.
In short, then, this production
is undoubtedly one of the best
now in the Bay Area. It should
be seen.


Dr. David Smith of the Halght-
Ashbury Medical Clinic will
speak Wednesday at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium about
his efforts to cope with the med
ieval problems of San Francisco's
hippie drug 1 culture.
The 28-year-old doctor has re
ceived much local and national
attention for his work. His ex
periences in the Haight district
have convinced him that "sci
entific facts are the best antidote
to drug myths ..." and that
drug problems should be treat
ed as medical rather than police
concerns. Dr. Smith was trained
in toxicology and pharmacy at
the University of California
School of Medicine. He is cur
rently involved in pharmacologi
cal research.
The production of William
Hanley's Slow Dance On the
Killing Ground, currently at the
Manhattan Playhouse (Manhat
tan and W. Bayshore), Fridays
and Saturdays, is an electrify
ing evening of theatre. The play
itself may be one of the finest
of the sixties, and this produc
tion, a West Coast premiere, is
excellent.
The Killing Ground is the
world at large—New York, spe
■« cifically- the "dance" takes
place on an unlit street in
Brooklyn in the temporary back
water of a candy store owned by
Glas, an aging German refugee.
Into it wander Randall, a black
teenage genius who has just
murdered his prostitute mother,
and Rosie, a pregnant N.Y.U.
coed on her way to an abortion.
In the interval that they are
> together, each of these three is
challenged, and ultimately as
; sisted, by the other two to con
front the truth of his own ex
istence as a denizen of the Kill
} ing Ground.
Each is responsible for the
destruction of life. Randall has
knifed his mother, Glas has
' abandoned his Jewish wife and
i son to the Nazis, and Rosie is

about to destroy her unborn
child.
In each case there are reasons
—compelling reasons. Randall is
caught and torn in the insane
paradoxes of a warped society;
Glas was deluded by his Com
munist ideals, later shattered by
the Hitler-Stalin pact; and Rosie
relies on a common morality:
"What does it matter! It hap
pens every day, right?"
But each is brought to
acknowledge the element of
choice in his fate, and the re
sponsibility he must bear for
that choice: "We choose the
dark streets up which we walk.
We choose them. And if we
are guilty of the denial of life,
who is there to save us from
that but ourselves?" They part
with whatever salvation self
knowledge can bring: Randall
and Glas to the certain ends of
sudden death and a life of guilt.
But Rosie remains hesitating
at the head of her dark street,
one which she may never walk
(Hanley wisely avoids melo
drama by leaving her decision
suspended).
Such a play places a heavy
burden on its actors if it is
to be rendered even plausible.
Director Judith Dresch's cast
makes it sing.

Leonard Simon's performance
as Randall is a self-contained
ballet. He is in almost constant
motion from blackout to black
out, moving with a dancer's
grace, a panther's menace.
The role is a particularly chal
lenging one, since the character
consists of two complete per
sonalities—a jive-talking street
bop and an articulate, tortured
intellectual—alternating contin
ually in a "self-induced schizo
phrenia."
Simon meets the challenge
more than half-way, raising
Randall from an initial level of
dangerous and comic fascination
to the stature, ultimat ly, of a
tragic hero: fully aware of his
doom and confronting it un
flinchingly.
Diana Ewing is, in terms of

and Saturdays, is an electrify
ing evening of theatre. The play
itself may be one of the finest
of the sixties, and this produc
tion, a West Coast premiere, is
excellent.
The Killing Ground is the
world at large—New York, spe
■« cifically- the "dance" takes
place on an unlit street in
Brooklyn in the temporary back
water of a candy store owned by
Glas, an aging German refugee.
Into it wander Randall, a black
teenage genius who has just
murdered his prostitute mother,
and Rosie, a pregnant N.Y.U.
coed on her way to an abortion.
In the interval that they are
> together, each of these three is
challenged, and ultimately as
; sisted, by the other two to con
front the truth of his own ex
istence as a denizen of the Kill
} ing Ground.
Each is responsible for the
destruction of life. Randall has
knifed his mother, Glas has
' abandoned his Jewish wife and
i son to the Nazis, and Rosie is

about to destroy her unborn
child.
In each case there are reasons
—compelling reasons. Randall is
caught and torn in the insane
paradoxes of a warped society;
Glas was deluded by his Com
munist ideals, later shattered by
the Hitler-Stalin pact; and Rosie
relies on a common morality:
"What does it matter! It hap
pens every day, right?"
But each is brought to
acknowledge the element of
choice in his fate, and the re
sponsibility he must bear for
that choice: "We choose the
dark streets up which we walk.
We choose them. And if we
are guilty of the denial of life,
who is there to save us from
that but ourselves?" They part
with whatever salvation self
knowledge can bring: Randall
and Glas to the certain ends of
sudden death and a life of guilt.
But Rosie remains hesitating
at the head of her dark street,
one which she may never walk
(Hanley wisely avoids melo
drama by leaving her decision
suspended).
Such a play places a heavy
burden on its actors if it is
to be rendered even plausible.
Director Judith Dresch's cast
makes it sing.

Leonard Simon's performance
as Randall is a self-contained
ballet. He is in almost constant
motion from blackout to black
out, moving with a dancer's
grace, a panther's menace.
The role is a particularly chal
lenging one, since the character
consists of two complete per
sonalities—a jive-talking street
bop and an articulate, tortured
intellectual—alternating contin
ually in a "self-induced schizo
phrenia."
Simon meets the challenge
more than half-way, raising
Randall from an initial level of
dangerous and comic fascination
to the stature, ultimat ly, of a
tragic hero: fully aware of his
doom and confronting it un
flinchingly.
Diana Ewing is, in terms of
her physical type, a ready-made
ingenue, and such actresses fre
quently have difficulty breaking
out of the mold.
The value of her performance
is enhanced, then, by the fact
that she brings Rosie—a homely
Jewish girl from the Bronx and
definitely no ingenue—beauti
fully and achingly alive, convey
ing both her facade of soph
moric intellectualism and, when
that crumples, a deep innocence
and sincerity of feeling. The
narration of her seduction in a
New Rochelle attic is at once
terribly funny and terribly sad.
The role of Glas, while the
least spectacular of the three,

may well be the most import
ant. His constant presence must
provide a unifying matrix—a
background against which the
bright colors of Randall and
Rosie flash and fade.
Chorus as well as protagonist,
it is Glas who finally articul
lates what the three have
learned about their dark streets.
William Chestnut is an accomp
lished and obviously seasoned
actor, and his performance is
masterful.
I was most impressed by his
ability to act by understate
ment: to express years of agony
and worlds of meaning by a
shrug, a suppressed quaver in
the voice, even a silence.
Three such talented actors
might well have turned in three
separate theatrical tours de
force, but Mrs. Dresch's direc
tion has molded their perform
ances into a unified, coherent
work of art. This is no virtuoso
showcase but some of the finest
ensemble acting I have seen.
One of the more impressive
aspects of her direction is a con
sistent attempt to involve her
audience. The longer speeches
are frequently addressed out
ward, and when she has Randall
speak directly to the audience
as the "jury" of Glas' mock
trial, her technique works beau
tifully.
In short, then, this production
is undoubtedly one of the best
now in the Bay Area. It should
be seen.


Dr. David Smith of the Halght-
Ashbury Medical Clinic will
speak Wednesday at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium about
his efforts to cope with the med
ieval problems of San Francisco's
hippie drug 1 culture.
The 28-year-old doctor has re
ceived much local and national
attention for his work. His ex
periences in the Haight district
have convinced him that "sci
entific facts are the best antidote
to drug myths ..." and that
drug problems should be treat
ed as medical rather than police
concerns. Dr. Smith was trained
in toxicology and pharmacy at
the University of California
School of Medicine. He is cur
rently involved in pharmacologi
cal research.
