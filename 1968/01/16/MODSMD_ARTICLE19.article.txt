# 'Academic Encroachment'
## Pacific-8 Doubtful On Frosh Rule 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Stanford Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor said yesterday
that the AAWU conference
probably would not change con
ference rules to allow freshman
participation in varsity sports
other than football and basket
ball.
The NCAA passed by a nar
row margin such a rule at its
national meeting last week.
Each conference in the NCAA
can now decide whether it will
change its own rules accord
ingly.
At the NCAA meeting, the

AAWU voted aaginst the rule
change. The AAWU had also
previously considered a similar
conference rule of its own, but
decided against it.
Taylor also said that individ
ual conferences can vote to
allow freshman participation
only in non-conference competi
tion or in NCAA championship
events.
Stanford's faculty representa
tive to the AAWU, Dr. Rixford
K. Snider, was unavailable for
comment.
New Rule
The newly amended NCAA
rule now reads, "(the varsity
athlete) must have completed
a full freshman year or two full
semesters, or three full quar
ters, or one academic year as de
fined by the certifying institu
tion for purposes of eligibility
in the sports of football and
basketball." (Amendment in
boldface).
However, the AAWU rule
book still reads, "A student . . .
during his freshman year of
residence shall be eligible for
freshman competition ONLY."
Stanford will be under the

jurisdiction of this rule until it
is abolished or amended by the
conference.
Swimming, Gymnastics Affected
Stanford's swimming team, of
course, will be greatly affected
by the AAWU's decision. This
year's freshman team is the
best ever assembled anywhere,
and could greatly strengthen
the already powerful varsity.
Coach Jim Gaughran is cau
tious in his optimism, however.
"Even if we do swim together,

we've got a lot of hard vvork
ahead of us."
Gymnastics Coach John Gil
more favored the rule change,
both from a personal point of
view and from its effect on the
Stanford team.
Freshman Steve Rochell is
one of the best frosh gymnasts
in the nation, and his presence
on the varsity would be quite a
boost.
Academic Pressure
Taylor said that the reason

for the AAWU's not favoring
the change is that it would be
"an encroachment upon the aca
demic area of a freshman." The
conference feels that a year of
adjustment to academic pres
sures is desirable before becom
ing involved in time-consuming
varsity sports.
Taylor also Indicated that the
Big Ten and Ivy League would
probably not change their own
policies of freshman segregation
in all sports.

Taylor said that the reason

for the AAWU's not favoring
the change is that it would be
"an encroachment upon the aca
demic area of a freshman." The
conference feels that a year of
adjustment to academic pres
sures is desirable before becom
ing involved in time-consuming
varsity sports.
Taylor also Indicated that the
Big Ten and Ivy League would
probably not change their own
policies of freshman segregation
in all sports.
Stanford Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor said yesterday
that the AAWU conference
probably would not change con
ference rules to allow freshman
participation in varsity sports
other than football and basket
ball.
The NCAA passed by a nar
row margin such a rule at its
national meeting last week.
Each conference in the NCAA
can now decide whether it will
change its own rules accord
ingly.
At the NCAA meeting, the

AAWU voted aaginst the rule
change. The AAWU had also
previously considered a similar
conference rule of its own, but
decided against it.
Taylor also said that individ
ual conferences can vote to
allow freshman participation
only in non-conference competi
tion or in NCAA championship
events.
Stanford's faculty representa
tive to the AAWU, Dr. Rixford
K. Snider, was unavailable for
comment.
New Rule
The newly amended NCAA
rule now reads, "(the varsity
athlete) must have completed
a full freshman year or two full
semesters, or three full quar
ters, or one academic year as de
fined by the certifying institu
tion for purposes of eligibility
in the sports of football and
basketball." (Amendment in
boldface).
However, the AAWU rule
book still reads, "A student . . .
during his freshman year of
residence shall be eligible for
freshman competition ONLY."
Stanford will be under the

jurisdiction of this rule until it
is abolished or amended by the
conference.
Swimming, Gymnastics Affected
Stanford's swimming team, of
course, will be greatly affected
by the AAWU's decision. This
year's freshman team is the
best ever assembled anywhere,
and could greatly strengthen
the already powerful varsity.
Coach Jim Gaughran is cau
tious in his optimism, however.
"Even if we do swim together,

we've got a lot of hard vvork
ahead of us."
Gymnastics Coach John Gil
more favored the rule change,
both from a personal point of
view and from its effect on the
Stanford team.
Freshman Steve Rochell is
one of the best frosh gymnasts
in the nation, and his presence
on the varsity would be quite a
boost.
