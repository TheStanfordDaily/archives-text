The Stanford gymnastics team
led by sophomore Craig Dickson
equalled their best score of last
year despite losing to Arizona
State 165.2 to 150.2.
Dickson, who has just return
ed from Britain, grabbed two
first place finishes, three sec
onds, and a fifth in the meet. He
finished just .35 behind the Sun
Devil's star performer, Rick Imp
son.
There were outstanding per
formances in the floor exercise,

sidehorse, long horse, and paral
lel bars with three athletes scor
ing nine or more points on a
10.0 point scale.
Rick Impson scored 9.0 in floor
exercise and a fantastic 9.2 in
the parallel bars.
Dickson executed a beautiful
vault and dismount to score 9.15
in the long horse, and John Price
of ASU earned a 9.15 in the
rings.
Stanford's next home meet
will be against UCLA and Ne
vada on the second of February.

Below is a summary of the
top three performers in each
