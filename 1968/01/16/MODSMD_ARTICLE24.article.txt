# Lederberg To Speak On Ethics Of Biology
## 
### 
Joshua Lederberg, Stanford
professor of genetics, speaks at
7:30 tonight in the Tresidder
large lounge on the "Human
Implication of Biological Dis
covery."
Lederberg will consider the
broad ethical problems posed by

the recent spectacular develop
ments in biology and medicine.
Two of these advances were
made by Stanford colleagues of
Lederberg; Dr. Arthur Korn
ber's synthesis of DNA and Dr.
Norman Shumway's heart trans
plant.

Lederberg, who is a member
of the SES steering committee,
currently serves as the Director
of the Kennedy Laboratories for
Molecular Medicine. This re
search group is conducting stu
dies in genetics, developmental
biology, and neurobiology for
new attacks on the problem of
mental retardation.
Lederberg himself has recent
ly branched into another field
which he has named exobiology,
the biological exploration of
space.
Lederberg, a native of Mont
clair, New Jersey, graduated
from Columbia University at
age 19. After two years as a
medical student, he shifted to
biology and obtained his Ph.D.
a year later at Yale under the
future Nobel Prize winner Ed
ward Tatum. Lederberg's pio
neering studies in the sexual re
combination of bacterial cells
won him his own Nobel Prize
in 1958.
