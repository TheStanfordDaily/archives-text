# An Advance Review
## Vietnam Film To Open Here 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The provocative documentary
film "Inside North Vietnam"
will be screened tomorrow night
at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditor
ium, and it's not surprising that
the show is sponsored by the
local "Committee for Peace in
Vietnam."
Although blatantly political in
its approach, the 85-minute film
gives visual proof of two key
contentions of war critics:
• The bombing is killing civil
ians and destroying North Viet
namese homes, hospitals and
schools.
• North Vietnam's primitive
economy can withstand conven
tional bombing which would
bring a more mechanized soci
ety to its knees.
"Inside North Vietnam" is the

latest opus of Felix Greene, a
spare, graying 57-year-old Brit
ish citizen who has lived in the
United States since 1935. His
other works include four books
an d a documentary film
"China!"
Greene produced "Inside
North Vietnam" during a three
month trip beginning in Febru
ary of last year, financed by th?
San Francisco Chronicle and
CBS News. (He wrote a 10-part
series on the visit for the Chron
icle in July.) Traveling with
four North Vietnamese in a
Russian built jeep, Greene
dodged U.S. bombs up and down
the tiny country while acting
as director-cameraman narrator
for his color documentary.
Enthusiastic Reviews
The film premiered Dec. 10 at
New York's Carnegie Hall to
enthusiastic reviews. After the
San Francisco opening Friday
at Music Hall Theatre, "the
whole audience cheered and
gave it a standing ovation,"
Greene said in an interview the
next day.
"What amazes me about this
film is the favorable reviews,"
Greene commented. Only Vari
ety has panned the documen
tary, calling it "propaganda."
Greene will be at Memorial
Auditorium tomorrow night to
make some preliminary re
marks about the film. History
Prof. Mark Mancall will intro
duce him.
Greene recalled that when the
Chronicle asked him to film the
documentary, he warned them,
" 'You'd better not send me—
I'm not impartial,. It's an un
speakable war." But the movie
"isn't polemical," Greene in
sisted. "It is a camera held up
to events. You can't help being
moved by it."
The film's prominant image is
people at work—r epai r in g
roads, cultivating crops, build
ing bomb shelters, practicing
with guns. Mobilization is total.
"I've never seen such morale,"
said Greene, "not even in Brit
ain during the blitz."
The gentle strains of Vietna
mese music on Greene's sound
track are periodically shattered
by the roar of American jets.
The crowds of Vietnamese run
for cover, scattering fearfully
