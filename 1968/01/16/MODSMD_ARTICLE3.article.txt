# An Advance Review
## Vietnam Film To Open Here 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The provocative documentary
film "Inside North Vietnam"
will be screened tomorrow night
at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditor
ium, and it's not surprising that
the show is sponsored by the
local "Committee for Peace in
Vietnam."
Although blatantly political in
its approach, the 85-minute film
gives visual proof of two key
contentions of war critics:
• The bombing is killing civil
ians and destroying North Viet
namese homes, hospitals and
schools.
• North Vietnam's primitive
economy can withstand conven
tional bombing which would
bring a more mechanized soci
ety to its knees.
"Inside North Vietnam" is the

latest opus of Felix Greene, a
spare, graying 57-year-old Brit
ish citizen who has lived in the
United States since 1935. His
other works include four books
an d a documentary film
"China!"
Greene produced "Inside
North Vietnam" during a three
month trip beginning in Febru
ary of last year, financed by th?
San Francisco Chronicle and
CBS News. (He wrote a 10-part
series on the visit for the Chron
icle in July.) Traveling with
four North Vietnamese in a
Russian built jeep, Greene
dodged U.S. bombs up and down
the tiny country while acting
as director-cameraman narrator
for his color documentary.
Enthusiastic Reviews
The film premiered Dec. 10 at
New York's Carnegie Hall to
enthusiastic reviews. After the
San Francisco opening Friday
at Music Hall Theatre, "the
whole audience cheered and
gave it a standing ovation,"
Greene said in an interview the
next day.
"What amazes me about this
film is the favorable reviews,"
Greene commented. Only Vari
ety has panned the documen
tary, calling it "propaganda."
Greene will be at Memorial
Auditorium tomorrow night to
make some preliminary re
marks about the film. History
Prof. Mark Mancall will intro
duce him.
Greene recalled that when the
Chronicle asked him to film the
documentary, he warned them,
" 'You'd better not send me—
I'm not impartial,. It's an un
speakable war." But the movie
"isn't polemical," Greene in
sisted. "It is a camera held up
to events. You can't help being
moved by it."
The film's prominant image is
people at work—r epai r in g
roads, cultivating crops, build
ing bomb shelters, practicing
with guns. Mobilization is total.
"I've never seen such morale,"
said Greene, "not even in Brit
ain during the blitz."
The gentle strains of Vietna
mese music on Greene's sound
track are periodically shattered
by the roar of American jets.
The crowds of Vietnamese run
for cover, scattering fearfully
like fowl escaping an approach
ing hunter.
"You can't be in North Viet
nam without always being aware
of the danger from the sky,"
Greene said in the interview. His
film tries to document the bomb
ing danger as a vicious threat to
Vietnamese lives, but a military
failure which "hasn't achieved
any of its objectives."
Greene showed me a souvenir
of his trip — a jagged, rusty
18-inch piece of steel. "The
bombs are made of this metal
now — it breaks across the
grain into pieces like this. If they
graze you they tear off your
arm." Greene also contends the
U.S. constantly uses anti-person
nel pellet bombs.
The film's grisliest sequence
shows the inside of a tiny hos
pital, where maimed children are
being treated for wounds from
a stray U.S. bomb.
Ready To Die
"The Pentagon is trying to
break the people's morale and
administrative structure,"
Greene said. "But the people

are ready to die. I know. I lived
with them."
Among the film's many inter
views are conversations with
Pham Van Dong, North Viet
nam's premier, and Maj. James
Hiteshew, an injured U.S. flier
shot down 11 days before. Hite
shew, grateful to still be alive,
criticizes the war and predicts
that the American people will
force its end within a year.
Above all, Greene tries to
show that North Vietnam can
endure the intense bombing. "All
the cities are obliterated except
Hanoi and Haiphong," he said.
"There are almost no bridges,
except at night."
But the tiny nation goes on;
the film shows gangs of workers
repairing "highways" which are
mere dirt trails, women filling
an irrigation ditch with buckets,
and militia shooting at super
sonic jets with rifles.
At the film's end Greene
abandons any pretense of im
partiality. "Their present strug
gle will never be forgotten," he
narrates. "They will not be con
quered."
