# College Paper Sells In City
## 
### 
Cal's Daily Californian (DC)
began street sales in San Fran
cisco to fill the information void
created by the San Francisco
newspaper strike.
The DC expanded its circula
tion for the special City Edition.
Columnists James Reston, Art
Hoppe, Terence O'Flaherty,
Ralph J. Gleason, and I. J.
O'Neale were added to the ex
panded Californian's news cov
erage, stock market summaries,
television listings, and weather
report. Herb Caen's column be
gan yesterday, will appear again
tomorrow, and, th: 1 DC hopes,
will run three times a week.
The Stanford Daily was dis
tributed for one week in San
Francisco, but the pressure of
expanded coverage and insuffici
ent sales crews brought an end
to San Francisco distribution.
Distribution problems were
similar for the Daily Californ
ian. Cal's paper is desperately
seeking vendors in San Fran
cisco, but several difficulties
have been encountered, a DC
spokesman said.
The Daily Californian plans
to continue San Francisco dis
tribution until the strike ends.
