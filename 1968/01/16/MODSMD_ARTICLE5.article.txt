# Cruising With A Cop
## Police Meet The Unexpected 
### H. RENTON ROLPH 
Cruising quietly through an
even quieter Friday night Quad,
the white campus police car
slowly prowled the labyrinthine,
dimly-lit alleyways of Stanford's
inner sanctum of academia.
As I bantered with him, Of
ficer Richard Sanguinetti listen
ed but kept on watching the
lonely sandstone corridors. Any
thing can happen there at night,
anything from arson, burglary,
assault or something like what
we actually did find on Quad
last Friday night.
A door slammed in the dark
ness on history corner, but San
guinetti beamed the car's ceil
ing searchlight for only a mo
ment before he saw that it was
just the janitor.
President's Office
As we neared the wooden ar
cade behind President Sterling's
office (where his Cadillac is
parked each day), Sanguinetti
abruptly braked the prowl car
and leaped out the door.
"Awright, what's going on up
there?" he demanded of a hel
meted human figure clinging pre
cariously halfway up the stone
wall of the President's office.
A meek and befuddled moan
was emitted beneath the white
bowl-shaped helmet: "Oh no. Oh
no."
"OK, come on down from
there. Let's go," Sanguinetti ord
ered.
The suspect protested: "I'm
not breaking in. You can't get
into the office from the roof.
Oh, what can I say? Oh, my
gosh, my gosh."
But Sanguinetti had yet to be
convinced by the pleas of the
climber, who turned out to be
a slight Japanese-American stu
dent named Alvin Yoshinaga.

Yoshinaga obediently climbed
down, fully aware he looked
somewhat unusual scaling the
walls of Sterling's office alone
at night. "I'm climbing now. I
climb. I'm with the Stanford Al
pine Club. I'm just practicing
now," he blurted.
Sanguinetti looked dubious.
The five-and-a-half foot Yoshin
aga, now standing on the ground,
looked up at the six-foot-five cop.
"I'm practicing my rock climb
ing here. I haven't broken any
laws have I? I just climb for
fun. I don't plan to steal any
thing."
Soon all became clear. Other
police arrived only to laugh at
the situation which now even
abashed Alvin found funny. "I've
been here for three year but I've
never seen a guy climbing the
walls before," chuckled Sangui
netti, advising Yoshinaga to
climb only during the day.
Yoshinaga Undaunted
Undaunted, Yoshinaga return
ed the next day to the Quad and
scaled triumphantly to the roof
of the President's office.
The case of Alvin Yoshinaga
is one of many that compose
the eventful life of the Stanford
policeman. The Quad-climbing
escapade was a small part 01
Sanguinetti's eight hour patrol.
As we patrolled the campus
and the surrounding lands San
guinetti, who quit the Navy
Shore Patrol because it was "too
sadistic," spoke of his job, Stan
ford, democracy, peace, horses
and moles, golf courses and
cars.
Student Pranks
Sanguinetti said that the Stan
ford force of 25 men takos the
brunt end of countless student
pranks, but that the police ex
pect it as part of the job. "We've

all been water-ballooned every
now and then, and we've all had
the cherry taken off the top of
the car .It can't be helped."
"Most of the men like the job
because we like the kids. You
have to have a bit of a father
inclination in this job. We are
not here to punish or harass the
students. They are in the best
time of their lives."
Sanguinetti commented about
other policemen that "there is
nothing worse in the world than
a bad cop. In our force a real
ticket writer is looked down on."
Sanguinetti himself is a man
with a flair for humor whose
hobby happens to be meteoro
logy and who owns an acre in
the Santa Cruz mountains where
he loves to take wife, family and
friends to fish and relax.
Loose Horses
Driving down bumpy Fremont
road to the Stanford stables, he
scrutinized the buildings and
grounds from the prowl car. He
commented that very often he
has to catch loose horses on his
night beat and put them back
in the stables. Just a few nights
before, "I had to soft-talk a
horse back to the barn at 2:30 in
the morning," he related. I final
ly just pulled him along by his
blanket."
The radio crackled incessantly
with reports for the Los
Mountain View and Stanford de
partments who share the same
local frequency. The dispatcher
told of a robbery in Sunnyvale,
a stolen car in Los Altos, a dance
breaking up, two missing girls,
and a car accident.
As we passed Lake Lag, San
guinetti commented: "I love all
kinds of animals. It gets pretty
lonely on this drive in the mid
dle of the night. So I talk to rab
bits and racoons. The other

night I saw a poor mole trying
to go across Junipero Serra. So
I stopped my car, got a stick,
and I goosed him across the
highway to keep him from get
ting run over."
Slowing up behind a dog trot
ting in the road Sanguinetti ex
plained facetiously, "I don't dare
honk. Might be a professor on
all fours."
Stanford policemen are prob
ably more physically familiar
with the campus and movements
on it than any other group. They
know exactly what should be
and what shouldn't be where.
Sanguinetti pointed out a large
colony of stray cats that live in
the woods near the Mausoleum.
Pulling up to the Mausoleum
itself we found a couple active-
ly occupied in a car, but San
guinetti drove on as soon as
he saw the Stanford registration
sticker.
At 10:15 the radio announc
ed that an armed 211, police code
for an armed robbery, had oc
cured at the Wells Fargo Bank
in Woodside just before it closed
at six. The robbery car was last
seen speeding down Sand Hill
Road toward Menlo Park.
Alert to the possibility of the
thieves ditching the car at Stan
ford, Sanguinetti left his regu
lar patrol to hunt for the iden
tified car. We travelled to the
Stanford shopping center to in
spect the license plates and
makes of cars parked there, as
well as the wooded area around
Palm Drive. Although we didn't
find the car, the bank robbers
were caught just before 11 in
Sunnyvale.
Prof Threatened
Sanguinetti returned to his pa
trol area and talked of one of
his stints as a Stanford plain
clothesman. Not long ago a
threat was made to a chemistry
professor's life and it became
necessary to guard him in his
lecture hall. Sanguinetti found
the lectures interesting "right
until he finished saying 'good
morning, ladies and gentle
men.' " The Professor lived.
The Stanford cop, who doesn't
mind being cop, takes his job
as seriously as he needs to. Most
of the crimes at Stanford don't
make sensational reading, but
persons involved are thankful to
have the police near.
The most frequent campus
crime is petty theft, but cases of

grand theft (over $300) are in
creasing with two last week.
Cases of indecent exposure are
numerous. One non-Stanford
man disrobed recently in a Roble
hall corridor.
Roble Prowlers
Reports of suspicious men
prowling around Roble and La
gunita have prompted the Stan
ford force to employ another
foot-patrolman for that area this
quarter.
Arson is another violation that
fills campus police files. Two
such cases involving a Stanford
fraternity were under investiga
tion during December.
All follow-up investigations of
Stanford crimes are conducted
by the Santa Clara county sher
iff's office which Stanford police
men serve as deputy sheriffs, al
though they are directly employ
ed and paid by the University.
Sanguinetti views himself a
teacher. When someone asks him
what he does for a living he
often says proudly, "I'm a teach
er at Stanford University."
And when asked, "Teacher of
what?", he replies, "A teacher
of practical law."
