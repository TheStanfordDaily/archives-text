• Romney Campaigns
KEENE, N.H. (AP) — Michi
gan's George Romney said Mon
day night if he becomes presi
dent he will seek guarantees of
neutrality and thus peace for
South Vietnam and for its
troubled neighbors.
He said foreign military bases
should be withdrawn from the
area.
Romney accused President

Johnson of permitting past op
portunities for peace talks to
lapse, "by design or mishand
ling."
"We have looked too much as
if we were demanding uncondi
tional surrender," Romney said
in a long and detailed speech on
the Vietnam war.
Campaigning for Republican
votes in New Hampshire's pres
idential primary, the Michigan
governor said the United States
has placed too much emphasis
on conventional military force
and not enough on the political
aspects of the struggle—or on
efforts to end the fighting.
• Kasperak Improves
In a report issued yesterday,
doctors said heart transplant pa
tient Mike Kasperak's liver cri
sis may be over.
Doctors emphasized, however,
that Kasperak's condition re
mains critical and that the prob
lems of rejection of his trans
planted heart still lie ahead.
They said the patient had im

proved moderately since Sunday
when doctors removed his gall
bladder. The surgeons also drain
ed the duct which carries bile
away from the liver into the in
testine.
A liver biopsy was also per
formed which indicated that the
deterioration of his liver may
have been arrested. Kasperak
still suffers from short periods
of semiconsciousness, but this
condition is reported to be im
proving.

MIAMI, Fla. (AP) — Adam
Clayton Powell Monday pro

Negro leaders on his Bimini is

"Black Power depends on how
you define it," Powell said. "It's
fragmented. One group says 'No
whites.' Another group says
'Kill 'em,' and some just want
equality and dignity."
Powell said he would like to

meet with Floyd McKissick,
head of the Congress of Racial
Equality, CORE; H. Rap Brown,

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Leaders of 12 unions involved
in the 11-day-old San Francisco

Examiner.
U.S. Senators Thomas Kuchel

to determine if antitrust laws
were violated when the two

• Curbs Hurt France
PARIS lAP) President
Charles de Gaulle may have to
dip into his gold hoard this year
because of the Johnson admini

American balance of payments.
This is the opinion of business
and diplomatic sources trying to
exaluate the consequences df
President Johnson's plans to bol
ster the dollar.
Though financial experts em
phasize the difficulty of arriving
at a precise calculation, they
concur that restrictive American
measures will increase the prob
ability France will run a balance
of payments deficit in 1968.
Weakening of the French in
ternational payments position
became apparent last year.
Some preliminary estimates put
France's 1967 deficit at some
$300 million. Here again, experts
emphasize the difficulty of know
ing for sure.
• R. R. Merger OKed
NEW YORK (AP) - The Su

the nearly six-year-old proposal
to merge the Pennsylvania and
New York Central railroads in
the biggest consolidation in U.S.
corporate history.
In a 7-1 decision, the court in
Washington cleared the tracks
for the creation by Feb. 1 of the
world's largest privately owned
railroad system with assets of
more than $4.3 billion.
Justice Abe Fortas, speaking
for the court, said the justices
could find no basis for reversing
approval of the merger by the
Interstate Commerce Commis
sion and a New York federal
court.
The merged road, to be known
as the Pennsylvania New York
Central Transportation Co.,
stretches halfway across the
continent between New York
and St. Louis and Chicago with
20,000 miles of road.

ATHENS (AP) — The interior

Papandreou, son of ex-Pre

• Wall St. Summary
NEW YORK (AP)—The pe
culiar, two-sided performance of
the stock market became even
more contradictory Monday as
gains again outnumbered losses
while averages declined. Trading
was active.
The contrast was more acute
Monday because the Dow Jones
industrial average took a fairly
sharp loss of 6.24 at 892.74.
Meanwhile, 694 stocks rose
and 599 fell of the 1,515 traded
on the New York Stock Ex
change. New highs for 1967-68
totaled 108 and new lows 9.
It was the fifth straight ses
sion in which the advance-de
cline ratio showed a plus while
the Dow industrials showed a
minus.
The deterioration of quality
issues was underlined by the
fact that two broadly based in
dicators also took losses.
The New York Stock Ex
change index fell 9 cents to
$54.07.
General uncertainty in Wall
Street was ascribed to the re
convening of Congress and to
hesitation in advance of Presi
dent Johnson's State of the
Union and budget messages.

KEENE, N.H. (AP) — Michi

day night if he becomes presi

neutrality and thus peace for
South Vietnam and for its

He said foreign military bases

Romney accused President

lapse, "by design or mishand

"We have looked too much as

in a long and detailed speech on

The contrast was more acute
Monday because the Dow Jones

NEW YORK (AP)—The pe

more contradictory Monday as
gains again outnumbered losses
while averages declined. Trading
was active.
The contrast was more acute
Monday because the Dow Jones
industrial average took a fairly
sharp loss of 6.24 at 892.74.
Meanwhile, 694 stocks rose
and 599 fell of the 1,515 traded

It was the fifth straight ses

The deterioration of quality

• R. R. Merger OKed
NEW YORK (AP) - The Su

the nearly six-year-old proposal
to merge the Pennsylvania and
New York Central railroads in
the biggest consolidation in U.S.
corporate history.
In a 7-1 decision, the court in
Washington cleared the tracks
for the creation by Feb. 1 of the
world's largest privately owned
railroad system with assets of
more than $4.3 billion.
Justice Abe Fortas, speaking
for the court, said the justices
could find no basis for reversing
approval of the merger by the
Interstate Commerce Commis
sion and a New York federal
court.
The merged road, to be known
as the Pennsylvania New York
Central Transportation Co.,
stretches halfway across the
continent between New York
and St. Louis and Chicago with
20,000 miles of road.

• Wall St. Summary
NEW YORK (AP)—The pe
culiar, two-sided performance of
the stock market became even
more contradictory Monday as
gains again outnumbered losses
while averages declined. Trading
was active.
The contrast was more acute
Monday because the Dow Jones
industrial average took a fairly
sharp loss of 6.24 at 892.74.
Meanwhile, 694 stocks rose
and 599 fell of the 1,515 traded
on the New York Stock Ex
change. New highs for 1967-68
totaled 108 and new lows 9.
It was the fifth straight ses
sion in which the advance-de
cline ratio showed a plus while
the Dow industrials showed a
minus.
The deterioration of quality
issues was underlined by the
fact that two broadly based in
dicators also took losses.
The New York Stock Ex
change index fell 9 cents to
$54.07.
General uncertainty in Wall
Street was ascribed to the re
convening of Congress and to
hesitation in advance of Presi

• Romney Campaigns
KEENE, N.H. (AP) — Michi

neutrality and thus peace for
South Vietnam and for its
troubled neighbors.
He said foreign military bases
should be withdrawn from the
area.
Romney accused President

Johnson of permitting past op
portunities for peace talks to
lapse, "by design or mishand
ling."
"We have looked too much as
if we were demanding uncondi
tional surrender," Romney said
in a long and detailed speech on
the Vietnam war.
Campaigning for Republican

has placed too much emphasis
on conventional military force
and not enough on the political
aspects of the struggle—or on
