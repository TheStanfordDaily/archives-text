snowy and mountainous western
tip of Sicily Monday. Police esti
mated nearly 300 persons were
killed.
With many of tho stricken
communities still out of touch,
officials feared the final death
toll might go to 500 or even
more. The injured were ex
pected to exceed 1,000.
About 10,000 persons were left
without homes and spent the
night outdoors or under tents
pitched by the Italian army.
The quakes toppled houses,
hospitals, medieval castles and
churches in the worst disaster
to hit the island since 1908.
• Romney Campaigns
KEENE, N.H. (AP) — Michi
gan's George Romney said Mon
day night if he becomes presi
dent he will seek guarantees of
neutrality and thus peace for
South Vietnam and for its
troubled neighbors.
He said foreign military bases
should be withdrawn from the
area.
Romney accused President

Johnson of permitting past op
portunities for peace talks to
lapse, "by design or mishand
ling."
"We have looked too much as
if we were demanding uncondi
tional surrender," Romney said
in a long and detailed speech on
the Vietnam war.
Campaigning for Republican
votes in New Hampshire's pres
idential primary, the Michigan
governor said the United States
has placed too much emphasis
on conventional military force
and not enough on the political
aspects of the struggle—or on
efforts to end the fighting.
• Kasperak Improves
In a report issued yesterday,
doctors said heart transplant pa
tient Mike Kasperak's liver cri
sis may be over.
Doctors emphasized, however,
that Kasperak's condition re
mains critical and that the prob
lems of rejection of his trans
planted heart still lie ahead.
They said the patient had im

proved moderately since Sunday
when doctors removed his gall
bladder. The surgeons also drain
ed the duct which carries bile
away from the liver into the in
testine.
A liver biopsy was also per
formed which indicated that the
deterioration of his liver may
have been arrested. Kasperak
still suffers from short periods
of semiconsciousness, but this
condition is reported to be im
proving.
• Powell Seeks Unity
MIAMI, Fla. (AP) — Adam
Clayton Powell Monday pro
posed a meeting with militant
Negro leaders on his Bimini is
land retreat to "sweat out" a po
sition paper on Black Power.
"Black Power depends on how
you define it," Powell said. "It's
fragmented. One group says 'No
whites.' Another group says
'Kill 'em,' and some just want
equality and dignity."
Powell said he would like to

meet with Floyd McKissick,
head of the Congress of Racial
Equality, CORE; H. Rap Brown,
leader of the Student Nonvio
-1 nt Coordinating Committee,
SNCC, and Stokoly Carmichael
who preceded Brown in the
SNCC leadership.

• Curbs Hurt France
PARIS lAP) President
Charles de Gaulle may have to
dip into his gold hoard this year
because of the Johnson admini
stration's program to redress the
American balance of payments.
This is the opinion of business
and diplomatic sources trying to
exaluate the consequences df
President Johnson's plans to bol
ster the dollar.
Though financial experts em
phasize the difficulty of arriving
at a precise calculation, they
concur that restrictive American
measures will increase the prob
ability France will run a balance
of payments deficit in 1968.
Weakening of the French in
ternational payments position
became apparent last year.
Some preliminary estimates put
France's 1967 deficit at some
$300 million. Here again, experts
emphasize the difficulty of know
ing for sure.
