# Is Peace Candidacy A Non-Campaign?
## 
### KIRK HANSON A Personal Report 
Senator Eugene McCarthy is
a gentle and sincere man, per
haps too gentle and too sincere.
His calm, reasoned approach to
the issue of the Vietnam war
is convincing, but as a presi
dential candidate he appears too
casual and retiring, and any
thing but the political animal.
It would be easy to make the
judgment that McCarthy is lazy
or insincere, but he struck me as
surprisingly sincere. In some
ways the Senator is all too rea
listic and candid for the good of
his campaign.
As we walked from Memorial

Auditorium across campus to
the Faculty Club yesterday, he
admitted Johnson's political
strength and the narrow chance
of his own nomination.
In his mind, his candidacy re
mains an attempt to influence
Lyndon Johnson's foreign pol
icy. I asked him if he really
thought Johnson could be in
fluenced during this election.
McCarthy claimed that If he
succeeds In winning 30 per
cent of the vote and perhaps
one of the primaries in the
months ahead, Johnson could
not ignore the sentiment. It
sounded like a meager goal
for a Presidential candidate.
He sounded realistic, too, about
the possible candidacy of Sen.
Robert Kennedy. Earlier in the
day at a San Francisco news
conference I heard him tell a
circle of editors, reporters, and
cameras that he felt Bobby had
taken a "neutral position" to
ward the McCarthy candidacy.
But now in White Plaza he ad
mitted he was upset by Ken
nedy's latest statement of firm
support for Johnson.
Would McCarthy withdraw
Lf Bobby decided to try for the
Democratic nomination? Mc-
Carthy told me he then would
have to reassess his own can
didacy and that it might well
be that Kennedy would have
much broader support than he
would. lie hastened to add that
he and Kennedy agreed on a
broad range of issues.
All of this seemed tragic to
me, for I was impressed by the
positions he articulated in Me
morial Auditorium and in other
speeches on the California swing.
I felt he had the making of a
serious candidate if he would
let himself become that.
His stands are outspoken. Re
cently he has called for the resig
nation and replacement of Se
lective Service Director Gen.
Lewis Hershey and Secretary of
State Dean Rusk. I asked him
about specific plans for ending
the war. He said he would stop
the bombing and negotiate with
the NLF or whoever else would
talk. In any case, he would cut
down the military involvement,
forcing South Vietnamese to take
over the fight for themselves.
I pressed the question of se

lective conscientious objection
which he supported several
times. He admitted the difficulty
of enacting this, but noted the
recommendations of the Presi
dent's Commission on the Draft
for such a possibility. He pro
posed a series of military and
non-military alternatives for
those who claimed and could
prove such status.
Unexciting Campaign
The ideas McCarthy presented
are not unexciting, but his cam
paign is. In many of his stands,
I found positions I want to ad
vocate in 1968. The campaign of
the Senator, the sincere Senator,
is unexciting because he admit
ted defeat before he began. The
campaign does not seem to seek
those ideas McCarthy advocates.
Does he really want to end the
war, or just call LBJ's attention
to existing dissent?
After my ten minute walk
with the Senator, these ques
tions remained with me—Can
McCarthy, who seems so sin
cere, forthright and non-politi
cal, wage a successful campaign
against President Johnson?
Does he deserve the support of
those who seek the end of the
Vietnam war? Can he formulate
a realistic foreign policy for the
United States?
I came away frustrated, not
knowing what to make of him.
It seems there is so much at
stake this year, so much politi
cal involvement demanded this
year. I felt Senator McCarthy
is somehow playing his cards—
and ours—wrong.
