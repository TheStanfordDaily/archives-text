The board, appointed by As

a kind of lobby for student in

SES project.
"Frequent informal discussions
in living groups" will be the
review board's way of keeping
in touch with their constituants'
views.
Hugh MacMillan, a materials
science graduate student, is
chairman of the 10-member
board.
The discussions tonight, Wed
nesday and Thursday will center
around four questions the board
has drawn up:
"1. Should general studies
go?
"2. What purpose undergrad
uate education?
"3. Should independent study
be limited to a small number of
students?
"4. What place has 'training'
in undergraduate education?"
The schedule for the discus
sions for this week is:
Tuesday night Branner
and Cedro
Wednesday night Adelphi
Thursday night .. Kappa Sigma
Many other residences will be
visited, and schedules will be
