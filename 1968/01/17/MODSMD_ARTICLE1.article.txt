# 'Tough' Problems Will Stay, Outgoing President Predicts
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
President J. E. Wallace Ster
ling yesterday told students that
the world's problems are "per
sistent and tough," but the
younger generation should face
these problems with "patience,
persistence and perspective."
"Your generation, despite its
minor incidence of so-called ali
enation and psychedelic with
drawal from society, has great
tackling potential" to solve prob
lems, Sterling said.
But don't count on any quick
success in overcoming poverty,
prejudice and war, Sterling
counseled. He called for "a deep
er realization that desired change
is not as promptly responsive to
command as one could wish."
Today's younger generation
will also leave "a legacy of
unsolved problems," he pre
dicted.
Sterling made these remarks
in his tenth and last Convoca
tion speech before an audience
of 1,200 in Memorial Auditorium.
The 61 -year-old president, who
will retire before next Septem
ber, covered a wide range of
university issues. He repeated
his often-stated conviction that
universities must guard their
"detachment and freedom" from
society's control, yet continue to
"be a part of it and serve it."
Sterling had sharp words for
"so-called activists" who have
been "more prone to assert their
own freedom than to defend it
on behalf of those with whom
they disagree." He said their "in
tolerance . . . invades and weak
ens that very freedom and in
dependence which the university
claims to be necessary to its
work."
Sterling advised such radicals
to "preserve" the freedoms
which the university "defends
on its own behalf as well as
theirs."
Sterling wove into his

speech comments on the "sen
sitive and delicate" relations
between the fedearl govern
ment and universities. Recent
ly he has been in frequent con
flict with federal officials over
the draft and cutbacks in fed
eral financial support for ed
ucation.
No end is in sight for the "ex
panded federal participation,"
Sterling implied, although the
Vietnam war has "produced
something of a freeze" on feder
al funds. Sterling expressed con
cern over this dependence on the
government because "American
education does not speak with
one voice or present a common
front in coping with the prob
lems presented by federal financ
ing."
Yet the university should not
"seek political power," Sterling
said, because that would endang
er the crucial "detachment and
freedom" of higher education.
The university's "resources of
learning are in such demand that
it cannot avoid exerting influence
through the consultive activities
of its members, but such in
fluence is not the same as seek
ing political power."
Sterling distinguished between
"environmental" influences on
Stanford, such as federal money,
and "hereditary" traditions such
as the "ivory tower" detachment
and in loco parentis, the assump
tion by the college of responsi
bility for the student's "non-aca
demic life."
Sterling- termed in loco
parentis "something of a
threadbare notion."
"I suspect that current objec
tion to the concept of in loco
parentis is to Its institutionalized
aspects which have made it seem
bureaucratic," said Sterling. "I
suspect that this objection is not
to those of its aspects which rep
resent close and effective teach
er-student relationships; other
wise why would there be clamor

for those relationships?"
He quoted Sir Eric Ashby's
observation of the futility of an
attempt "to remain in loco pa
rentis toward a generation which
rejects authority."
Sterling concluded, "Environ
mental pressure for change is
not likely to lessen. All the more
reason, then, that under pres
sure of continuing change, the
university should be alert to pre
serve the freedom and detach
ment which are essential to aca
demic independence.
"I have found it exciting to
be a member of this particular
university during these recent
years of great change ... I
have had no greater concern
titan to try to defend its basic
freedom against all comers —
from the Right and the Left,
from Inside and outside."
"As I look to the future and
its problems, I cannot say that
I am sorry that my term of
office is nearing its end. But I
can say I do not propose to ter
minate my interest in Stanford's
welfare, least of all in the de
fense of its freedom."
Sterling received a one-minute
standing ovation from his audi
ence.

STERLING — "No generation has a monopoly on aspirations . . .
there is always the opportunity, if not the need, to gain a deeper
realization that desired change is not as promptly responsive to
command as one could wish."
