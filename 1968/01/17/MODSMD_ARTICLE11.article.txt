# McCarthy Campaign Disaster

Let the unhappv, brutal truth
come out. Eugene McCarthy's
camapign is a disaster. It has
been run as if King Constantine
was the manager.
McCarthy's speeches are dull,
vague, and without either balls
or poetry. He is lazy and vain.
His failure to jump on issues
like Robert McNamara's firing
or General Hershey's recent
manifestos reveals a serious de
ficiency of political instinct. He
has put together a campaign
staff of amateurs and burnt-out
Stevensonians. He has said noth
ing of conseqeunce about the
cities, the poor, the draft, or
the Third World.
Even on Vietnam he talks
more about abstractions like
"the erosion of the Senate as an
institution" than about the dfad,
homeless, or maimed victims of
American napalm. He has no
explanation for his Senate votes
aaginst drug law reform and
plugging up the oil depletion
allowance.
He has hired as his press sec
retary Tom Page, who six
months ago was calling news
papers in New York and Wash
ington, trying to convince them
Allard Lowenstein was a sub
versive.
Sorry And Angry
This is all written in sorrow
as well as anger. The idea of

McCarthy's candidacy was posi
tively transcendental. But he
has done nothing right since he
announced on November 30.
He says his candidacy is aimed
at getting the draft resistance
kids out of the streets and into
the political system: But then
he hired a government bureau
cratlike Page who red-baits a
reform Democrat like Lowen
stein.
McCarthy can't have it both
ways. He can't win the alleg
iance of the marching radicals
while trying to run a hygienic
campaign to mobilize the silent
center. Up to now he has dis
appointed both potential constit
uencies.
Inept Campaign
Every professional politician
who has had any direct exper
ience with McCarthy's cam
paign has come away in des
pair. It is so inept it almost
seems that only a paranoid view
of his intentions can explain its
failure.
Senator Ernest Gruening, a
charter dove, has privately told
friends he suspects McCarthy
may have been put up to run
ning by LBJ himself, in order
to deflect dissent into a harm
less vessel.
Other polls, bitterly anti-war,
desperate for an alternative
candidate six weeks ago, now
think McCarthy is really run
ning for vice-president, or am
bassador to the UNâ€”under
Johnson.
Francois Mitteand, leader of
France's reform Democrats,

told an American last week:
"The first week I was in your
country I thought McCarthy was
a stalking horse for Bobby Ken
nedy. The second week I
thought he was a stalking horse
for Johnson."
Establishment liberals have
always had a depressing genius
for self-deception. They project
ed qualities onto Adlai Steven
son he never had, and now they
talk as if the Bay of Pigs is
not part of the New Frontier's
history.
So today Joe Rauh and Rus
sell Hemenway and Gilbert Har
rison talk is if McCarthy's cam
paign was actually effective and
exhilarating. They sound like
Jacob Javits discussing Rom
ney's campaign.
No one wanted McCarthy to
be a success more than me. But
right now his campaign looks
like just another effort by the
ADA to promote a candidate for
vice-president.
Fears Multiply
My fear is that the result of
a bland McCathy campaign will
be negative and destructive if
he runs as badly in the primar
ies as now seems likely.
I fear his campaign will not
energize the middle and thus
will under-represent the actual
feeling in the country against
the war.
I fear its effect will be to
make Johnson appear more pop
ular than he is, encourage LBJ
to escalate the war even more,
and give him the necessary mo
mentum to win re-election next

November.
Further, I fear that those anti
war activists drawn into Mc-
Carthy's campaign will become
even more alienated and em
bittered against electoral poli
tics.
Such a frustrating experience
could have the same traumatic
effect the rejection of the
MFDP challenge had on the
New Left in 1964. When the
pure cause of the delegation of
Mississippi tenant farmers was
subordinated to the ambitions
of Hubert Humphrey, the Billy
Budds of the Mississippi Sum
mer were disillusioned into
apocalyptic guerrillas.
This can happen again when
those street marchers McCar
thy wants to domesticate find
out all he really wants to do is
cut the war in half.
McCarthy earned my vote just
by announcing. But he doesn't
deserve anything more. And I
would advise the Resistance
people and the anti-war move
ment to disavow him soon, be
fore the country begins to
think of him as their leader.
