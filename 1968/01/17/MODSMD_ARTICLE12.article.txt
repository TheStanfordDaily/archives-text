# 'True' De Gaulle Revealed A Not So Senile Enemy
## 
### Henry J. Taylor 
President Charles de Gaulle,
behind the scenes, tried to sabo
tage Presidential envoy Chester
Bowles' mission to Cambodia on
U.S.-Vietnam matters. How de
Gaulle succeeded remains to be
established, but French influence
on Prince Norodom Sihanouk is
strong.
As de Gaulle systematically
stHkes against our country, mil
lions generously infer he is se
nile, which he definitely is not.
And the false explanation of
senility weakens our ability to
survive his part in the Moscow-
Peking-Paris attack.
His roots, of course, are in
great events and any clarifi
cation of the attack starts with
these.
De Gaulle made his Resistance
appeal from London on June 18,
1940. He symbolized the Resis
tance, and we propped him up
handsomely in this, although we
knew he had a reputation for
biting the feeding hand.
When today de Gaulle com- i
plains of Anglo-American slights
he makes us forget he exploded
our patience himself. Winston
Churchill's statement that "of
all the crosses I have to bear the
Cross of Lorraine (de Gaulle) is
the worst" is something we're
entitled to remember.
Though de Gaulle was the
symbol of Fronch resistance, thr
response was to France, not to
him — a fact he twice denied
to me and which he now denies
to anybody.
French escapees went first to
safety at the Spanish govern
ment's ancient penitentiary at
Pamplona, then pilgrimaged to
the old bull ring stadium at Mai
aga. They embarked there, as I
once did in this trip with them,
to join de Gaulle's Anglo-Ameri
can-supported Fighting French
in North Africa.
Starting with the landing in
the African Cameroons in 1940,
the Fighting French had rallied
Gabon, French Equitorial Afri
cal, Chad and Übangi to the
cause and were well entranched
in the Mediterranean's northern
strip, including Syria.
In the Pacific and Far East,
Tahiti and New Caledonia de
clared for the Free French, fol
lowed by Pondicherry and the
French possessions in India.
Then Senegal, French Guinea,
the Ivory Coast, Dahomey, Mad
agascar and Niger (all now in
the United Nations where each
has a vote as heavy as that of
the United States) all declared.
So did Guadeloupe and Martin
que, as well as some islands off
Newfoundland.
Gabon typifies de Gaulle's
cynical preachments about inter
vention, which are sheer double
talk.

The French had timber and
iron holdings there. The terri
tory was proclaimed indepen
dent August 17, 1960. On Feb
ruary 18, 1964, native junior of
ficers threw French-subsidized
stooge dictator Leon M'Ba in the
clink and reached for his power
and the French purse. Bingo! De
Gaulle sent in French paratroop
ers the next day.
The Kremlin inherited nearly
four million French Communists
whose loyalty is to Moscow.
Many of their leaders were
French Army deserters who sat
out the war in Moscow and one
of the deserters, Maurice Thor
ez, became Vice-Premier of
France. In large measure their
Red divisive tactics defeated
France in Vietnam, Morocco, Tu
nisia and Algeria. De Gaulle,
from the very beginning, in
power and out, dealt with the
French Communists.
He had dealt with them in the
mistaken idea that he personally
could remain a free agent. And,
as for their sponsors in Mos
cow and Peking, de Gaulle must
win his points by diplomatic
blackmail — a game he knows
well.
Twice America went to help
France expel her invaders, liber
ate her sons from prisons, help

France recover her independence
and her liberties and the right
to regain a place among civili7cd
nations. In fact, except for
American intervention there
would be no de Gaulle.
Yet de Gaulle's primary pol
icy is to sabotage and, if pos
sible, destroy America's world
leadership. For this destructive
purpose he has created his de
facto Moscow - Peking - Paris
axis. We are suffering the hor
rors of Vietnam because of its
manipulations.
And de Gaulle's Asian policy,
which accounts for his Cambod
ian finagle, his Arab policy, his
hostility to NATO, his recalci
trance in the Common Market
and his Latin • American adven
tures are all likewise Red ob
jectives — legs on the de facto
Mosow • Peking - Paris axis
stool.
The payoff to us is in what de
Gaulle does, and this is only be
clouded by such distracting ex
cuses as "senility." We shouH
collect at once France's long
overdue, and payable debts to us
instead of allowing de Gaulle to
exploit America's gold crisis and
in all intellectual ways recognize
him for what he is: our declared
enemy.
