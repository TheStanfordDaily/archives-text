# The 						Study Of Education Position Paper
## 
### PHILIP DAWSON 
This memorandum is a re
sponse to the position paper
issued by the steering commit
tee of the Study of Education
at Stanford, October 30, 1967,
entitled "Toward a More Flex
ible Undergraduate Program."
The steering committee at
taches greater importance to its
basic approach than to specific
proposals. The contention to be
outlined here is that this basic
approach is inadequate and
needs to be defined anew.
The object is set forth for
undergraduate education are
formulae for the acquisition of
knowledge, the critical evalua
tion of knowledge, and the ap
plication of knowledge or the
perception of its relation to the
environment. These are either
passive or purely instrumental.
Nothing in these phrases evokes
creative, original work of any
sort. The emphasis upon intel
lectual quality, which one would
expect to find, is reduced to a
reference to "rigor."
Doubtless the reformation of
the mind is an unusual occur
rence in the education of under
graduates. But this fact, if it is
a fact, does not justify the as
sumption seemingly made here,
that the minds of undergradu
ates are definitely formed and
that what is required is an in
fusion of something that can
later be applied or related to
real life.

The inadequacy of the steer
ing committee's definition of ob
jectives is related to the commit
tee's failure to present a clear
enough view of students as they
are.
Students Under Stress
Undergraduate students us
ually display characteristics that
result not only from the stress
ful stage of life they have rec
ently attained but also from the
uncertainties and dilemmas ex
perienced by American parents.
It is obvious that American
family life is under considerable
pressure to change in some way,
but for many parents it is un
clear what direction change
ought to take.
A continuing result of this
state of affairs is going to be
a particular kind of immaturity
among undergraduate students.
At times they will insist upon
being treated as adults, al
though their underlying inten
tion may be to exhort them
selves to act as adults. At other
times (perhaps on the very
same day) they will indignantly
refuse to conform to require
ments that the adults they know
accept for their own lives.
These circumstances require
a university to profer advice
and counseling of various kinds,
short-term diagnosis and ther
apy for stress situations, advice
concerning careers and voca
tions, and candid guidance con

cerning academic work during
the undergraduate years. Like
most universities, Stanford pres
ently has inadequate provisions
for all this. (One student sui
cide per year is one too many.)
It is essential to avoid trying
to compensate for inadequate
counseling and advising by for
mulating rules as a general sub
stitute. That is what most uni
versities have done in the past,
and it is visibly going to work
even more badly in the future
than in the past.
High School Deficient
Undergraduate students bring
with them to college the results
of the current deficiencies in
high school education. Efforts
have begun to remedy these de
ficiencies, but steady pressure
applied through standards de
fined by colleges is still very
much in order.
One of the worst deficiencies
is the feeble control of the En
glish language manifested in
varying degrees by some stu
dents. Associated with the im
maturity of their reading and
writing skills there is often a
general shallowness of exper
ience in and apptitude toward
humanistic studies, including
foreign languages and history.
Mere arrival at the university
does not liberate students, does
not even inform them of such
obstacles to their intellectual
freedom.
Thus the section in the posi
tion paper on "The Characteris
tics of Students" needs amend
ment. That section presents a
traditional ideal for undergrad
uate education, an ideal which
has been described (in Bacon's
phrase) as a "lucid interval" be
tween periods of subjection of
the mind, first to the family and
the school, later to the economic
and civic obligations of the
adult. What needs to be recog
nized now is that there is im
portant continuity between
these stages.
Undergraduate education may

be, as the position paper says,
"a time for general intellectual
and personal growth." But the
phrase is vague, and hence
evasive. On the one hand there
is often the need to compensate
for the failings of secondary
education, its emphasis on in
strumental utility, social relev
ance, and civic consensus, and
its low valuation of orginality
and of irrelevance or antagon
ism to prevailing social values,
and especially of the skills of
thought and communication. On
the other hand the choice of a
lifetime occupation can be made
only after trying out, so to
speak, several professional roles
with full but temporary com
mitment to each in turn.
In view of these complexities,
what sense is to be made of
the section in the position paper
which suggests that there will
be a "standard route" and it
recognizes that "the immature"
(i.e., most students) might, if
permitted to do so, "wander
aimlessly through the univers
ity." Why should there be a
standard route? How can a stu
dent avoid wandering "aim
lessly" if our purpose is to per
mit him to change his aims?
To be sure, there are sound
reasons for proceeding grad
ually in the application of new
rules. But that does not dictate
preservation of the existing sys
tem in our minds as we consider
college education. The failure
to examine the needs of under
graduates is combined, in the
later sections of the position
paper, with an assumption that
there must be something good
in the existing General Studies
program, which was in fact al
ready out-of-date at the time it
was adopted.
Remedial Work Needed
, The position paper offers no
recognition of the need for rem
edial or compensatory work in
reading and writing. "The culti
vation of these abilities should
be the responsibility of the en
tire faculty": that is, of no one
in particular. What is a faculty
member to do when he encoun
ters, as he all too frequently
does, a term paper that calls out
not for rewriting of the paper
but for retraining of the mind
that produced it?
The paragraph devoted to urg
ing alternatives for the Western
Civilization course begins with
the surprising assertion that his
torical studies have a transcend
ent methodological significance.
In fact, historical methods are
distinguished by, the weakness
and uncertainty of their philo
sophical and logical basis, and
the catch-as-catch-can proced
ures actually followed by his
torians. As for the applicability
of historical knowledge, that mi
lage has been dissipated by
Paul Freund: "Of history it may
be said briefly that its useful
ness varies inversely with the
weight of the demands made
on it." (Nomos VII, 1964, p. 114)

Accuracy and candor would
compel one to admit that the
value of the course in western
Civilization has consisted in (1)
its remedial usefulness for stu
dents who arrive in college ap
pallingly ignorant of their own
cultural past, and (2) the broad
perspective it supplies for the
individual student who contem
plates his own biographical ex
perience. The same would be
true, more or less, of any alter
native. For whom, then, is a
Western Civilization course or
some alternative desirable? As
suming that it is essential for
some students, how are they to
be identified?
Science Isn't Technology
Concerning the science re
quirement, also, just because the
existing rules are obviously un
satisfactory the matter needs to
be reconsidered in fundamental
terms. Here, the position paper
is useless. It refers to "science
and technology' as one "area of
learning," ignoring the differ
ence between them.
(The technologist, like the
physician or the lawyer, is con
fronted with problems for which
some solution must be found.
If it is an unsatisfactory solu
tion, that is regrettable, but one
must tolerate in practice the
best possible soluion. The posi
tion of the scientist is funda
mentally different. His work in
volves learned ignorance just as
much as does the work of a
philologist or a philosopher.)
Ways should be found to
cause students in the human
istic disciplines to share in the
scientific enterprise during part
of their education. What ap
pears to be needed is the ex
perience of doing some science:
an internalization of scientific
ways of thought. This requires
serious work in a scientific dis
cipline.
The history of science is im
portant in the study of history.
The philosophy of science is sig
nificant to a philosopher. The
social relevance of science is an
aspect of the study of society,
not science. None of these sub
stitutes provides the experience
of thinking as a scientist for the
time being. It is the task of the
science faculties to devise ways
of offering that experience, as
well as they can. Naturally
these will stress the nature and
methods of science, just as they
would do for students aiming to
become scientists.
Before imposing any require
ments on undergraduate stu
dents, it is appropriate to make
available the educational ex
periences which would justify
the requirements. It is possible
that providing such educationa 1
experiences will impede the
training of graduate students
and the pursuit of research in
terests â€”just as it has done and
is doing in the humanities and
the social sciences. It is also
possible that the scientific estab
lishment cannot be de-monastic

ized; if so, let us avoid ersatz
substitutions and pretence.
On the subject of the existing
requirement for study for math
ematics or a foreign language,
the position paper again fails to
make distinctions that ought to
have been made. It says "there
does not seem to be an adequate
basis for requiring all students
to attain a fixed level of pro
ficiency in a foreign language."
What stage of the student's
life is envisaged here? Arrival
in college, the end of the sopho
more year, or entrance (among
90 percent of recent graduates)
into graduate or professional
training? What is the purpose
of the assertion: To controvert
the conclusions reached by
Conant in his study of the Am
erican high school and the de
liberate policies of many high
schools? To suggest that the
undergraduate years are priv
ileged in that the student can
temporarily ignore what he has
already learned and what will
very probably be required of
him in the future? To deny the
facts of life in graduate schools?
It is evident that the proper
question is not whether all Stan
ford students ought to attain
proficiency in a foreign lan
guage. Instead, the question is
when and, secondarily, how and
with what relationship to other
academic work before or after
college? These questions must
precede consideration of a uni
versal requirement, and because
these questions have not even
been asked it is premature, to
say the least, to urge either
abandoning the existing re
quirement or making it more
practicable.
Neglecting this distinction be
tween stages of education, the
position paper attaches import
ance to a distinction between
mathematics and other lan
guages and attempts to justify
this by calling it "well recog
nized." What is mathematics if
it is not a language? And how
can the steering committee say
that there is not adequate basis
for imposing a requirement in
mathematics and then proceed
to offer social relevance as a
value to be sought in science
courses for the "non-scientist"?
If social relevance is consid
ered to depend on impact; there

is scarcely a discipline offering
greater social relevance than
mathematics. Or is the intended
meaning rather that the value
of a course lies In its obvious
ness? If the proposal to to dis
pense not only with many of the
existing formal requirements
(for which there would be
strong support in the faculty)
but with serious guidance of
any sort, then obviousness will
indeed be importantâ€”competi
tively. But it is not clear, for
tunately, that this really is the
proposal.
Position Paper Is Timid
The decisive flaw in the posi
tion paper is its timidity. Timid
ity in the face of the faculty,
who deserve to be informed that
they presently offer far too
many options and far too little
individual guidance to students,
and who need to be challenged
to reconsider in fundamental
terms the relationship between
purposes and rules. Timidity in
the face of the students, who are
not yet capable of judging the
value and meaning of the var
ious intellectual worlds consti
tuted by scholarly and scien
tific disciplines and who will
often, if left to themselves, seek
quick dividends and acquire edu
cational deficits.
A faculty member who sug
gests offering a course for un
dergraduate students ought not
to obtain permission for this
automatically or by default. A
student who entirely neglects a
large body of knowledge or an
intellectual skill ought not to be
thereafter awarded a diploma
certifying that he is educated.
The criteria and the means of
enforcement for both these
kinds of judgment need to be
thought through all over again
from time to time.
The Study of Education at
Stanford ought not to attempt
to patch existing programs by
offering small-scale experimen
tal "reforms." It ought to face
squarely the issues of purposes,
sanctions, and their interrela
tions.
This memorandum is a re
sponse to the position paper
issued by the steering commit
tee of the Study of Education
at Stanford, October 30, 1967,
entitled "Toward a More Flex
ible Undergraduate Program."
The steering committee at
taches greater importance to its
basic approach than to specific

lectual quality, which one would

The inadequacy of the steer

ism to prevailing social values,
and especially of the skills of
thought and communication. On
the other hand the choice of a
lifetime occupation can be made
only after trying out, so to
speak, several professional roles
with full but temporary com
mitment to each in turn.
In view of these complexities,
what sense is to be made of
the section in the position paper
which suggests that there will
be a "standard route" and it
recognizes that "the immature"
(i.e., most students) might, if
permitted to do so, "wander
aimlessly through the univers
ity." Why should there be a
standard route? How can a stu
dent avoid wandering "aim
lessly" if our purpose is to per
mit him to change his aims?
To be sure, there are sound
reasons for proceeding grad
ually in the application of new
rules. But that does not dictate
preservation of the existing sys
tem in our minds as we consider
college education. The failure
to examine the needs of under
graduates is combined, in the
later sections of the position
paper, with an assumption that
there must be something good
in the existing General Studies
program, which was in fact al
ready out-of-date at the time it
was adopted.
Remedial Work Needed
, The position paper offers no
recognition of the need for rem
edial or compensatory work in
reading and writing. "The culti
vation of these abilities should
be the responsibility of the en
tire faculty": that is, of no one
in particular. What is a faculty
member to do when he encoun
ters, as he all too frequently
does, a term paper that calls out
not for rewriting of the paper
but for retraining of the mind
that produced it?
The paragraph devoted to urg
ing alternatives for the Western
Civilization course begins with
the surprising assertion that his
torical studies have a transcend
ent methodological significance.
In fact, historical methods are
distinguished by, the weakness
and uncertainty of their philo
sophical and logical basis, and
the catch-as-catch-can proced
ures actually followed by his
torians. As for the applicability
of historical knowledge, that mi
lage has been dissipated by
Paul Freund: "Of history it may
be said briefly that its useful
ness varies inversely with the
weight of the demands made
on it." (Nomos VII, 1964, p. 114)

Accuracy and candor would
compel one to admit that the
value of the course in western
Civilization has consisted in (1)
its remedial usefulness for stu
dents who arrive in college ap
pallingly ignorant of their own
cultural past, and (2) the broad
perspective it supplies for the
individual student who contem
plates his own biographical ex
perience. The same would be
true, more or less, of any alter
native. For whom, then, is a
Western Civilization course or
some alternative desirable? As
suming that it is essential for
some students, how are they to
be identified?
Science Isn't Technology
Concerning the science re
quirement, also, just because the
existing rules are obviously un
satisfactory the matter needs to
be reconsidered in fundamental
terms. Here, the position paper
is useless. It refers to "science
and technology' as one "area of
learning," ignoring the differ
ence between them.
(The technologist, like the
physician or the lawyer, is con
fronted with problems for which
some solution must be found.
If it is an unsatisfactory solu
tion, that is regrettable, but one
must tolerate in practice the
best possible soluion. The posi
tion of the scientist is funda
mentally different. His work in
volves learned ignorance just as
much as does the work of a
philologist or a philosopher.)
Ways should be found to
cause students in the human
istic disciplines to share in the
scientific enterprise during part
of their education. What ap
pears to be needed is the ex
perience of doing some science:
an internalization of scientific
ways of thought. This requires
serious work in a scientific dis
cipline.
The history of science is im
portant in the study of history.
The philosophy of science is sig
nificant to a philosopher. The
social relevance of science is an
aspect of the study of society,
not science. None of these sub
stitutes provides the experience
of thinking as a scientist for the
time being. It is the task of the
science faculties to devise ways
of offering that experience, as
well as they can. Naturally
these will stress the nature and
methods of science, just as they
would do for students aiming to
become scientists.
Before imposing any require
ments on undergraduate stu
dents, it is appropriate to make
available the educational ex
periences which would justify
the requirements. It is possible
that providing such educationa 1
experiences will impede the
training of graduate students
and the pursuit of research in
terests â€”just as it has done and
is doing in the humanities and
the social sciences. It is also
possible that the scientific estab
lishment cannot be de-monastic

ized; if so, let us avoid ersatz
substitutions and pretence.
On the subject of the existing
requirement for study for math
ematics or a foreign language,
the position paper again fails to
make distinctions that ought to
have been made. It says "there
does not seem to be an adequate
basis for requiring all students
to attain a fixed level of pro
ficiency in a foreign language."
What stage of the student's
life is envisaged here? Arrival
in college, the end of the sopho
more year, or entrance (among
90 percent of recent graduates)
into graduate or professional
training? What is the purpose
of the assertion: To controvert
the conclusions reached by
Conant in his study of the Am
erican high school and the de
liberate policies of many high
schools? To suggest that the
undergraduate years are priv
ileged in that the student can
temporarily ignore what he has
already learned and what will
very probably be required of
him in the future? To deny the
facts of life in graduate schools?
It is evident that the proper
question is not whether all Stan
ford students ought to attain
proficiency in a foreign lan
guage. Instead, the question is
when and, secondarily, how and
with what relationship to other
academic work before or after
college? These questions must
precede consideration of a uni
versal requirement, and because
these questions have not even
been asked it is premature, to
say the least, to urge either
abandoning the existing re
quirement or making it more
practicable.
Neglecting this distinction be
tween stages of education, the
position paper attaches import
ance to a distinction between
mathematics and other lan
guages and attempts to justify
this by calling it "well recog
nized." What is mathematics if
it is not a language? And how
can the steering committee say
that there is not adequate basis
for imposing a requirement in
mathematics and then proceed
to offer social relevance as a
value to be sought in science
courses for the "non-scientist"?
If social relevance is consid
ered to depend on impact; there

is scarcely a discipline offering
greater social relevance than
mathematics. Or is the intended
meaning rather that the value
of a course lies In its obvious
ness? If the proposal to to dis
pense not only with many of the
existing formal requirements
(for which there would be
strong support in the faculty)
but with serious guidance of
any sort, then obviousness will
indeed be importantâ€”competi
tively. But it is not clear, for
tunately, that this really is the
proposal.
Position Paper Is Timid
The decisive flaw in the posi
tion paper is its timidity. Timid
ity in the face of the faculty,
who deserve to be informed that
they presently offer far too
many options and far too little
individual guidance to students,
and who need to be challenged
to reconsider in fundamental
terms the relationship between
purposes and rules. Timidity in
the face of the students, who are
not yet capable of judging the
value and meaning of the var
ious intellectual worlds consti
tuted by scholarly and scien
tific disciplines and who will
often, if left to themselves, seek
quick dividends and acquire edu
cational deficits.
A faculty member who sug
gests offering a course for un
dergraduate students ought not
to obtain permission for this
automatically or by default. A
student who entirely neglects a
large body of knowledge or an
intellectual skill ought not to be
thereafter awarded a diploma
certifying that he is educated.
The criteria and the means of
enforcement for both these
kinds of judgment need to be
thought through all over again
from time to time.
The Study of Education at
Stanford ought not to attempt
to patch existing programs by
offering small-scale experimen
tal "reforms." It ought to face
squarely the issues of purposes,
sanctions, and their interrela
tions.
This memorandum is a re
sponse to the position paper
issued by the steering commit
tee of the Study of Education
at Stanford, October 30, 1967,
entitled "Toward a More Flex
ible Undergraduate Program."
The steering committee at
taches greater importance to its
basic approach than to specific
proposals. The contention to be
outlined here is that this basic
approach is inadequate and
needs to be defined anew.
The object is set forth for
undergraduate education are
formulae for the acquisition of
knowledge, the critical evalua
tion of knowledge, and the ap
plication of knowledge or the
perception of its relation to the
environment. These are either
passive or purely instrumental.
Nothing in these phrases evokes
creative, original work of any
sort. The emphasis upon intel
lectual quality, which one would
expect to find, is reduced to a
reference to "rigor."
Doubtless the reformation of
the mind is an unusual occur
rence in the education of under
graduates. But this fact, if it is
a fact, does not justify the as
sumption seemingly made here,
that the minds of undergradu
ates are definitely formed and
that what is required is an in
fusion of something that can
later be applied or related to
real life.

The inadequacy of the steer
ing committee's definition of ob
jectives is related to the commit
tee's failure to present a clear
enough view of students as they
are.
Students Under Stress
Undergraduate students us
ually display characteristics that
result not only from the stress
ful stage of life they have rec
ently attained but also from the
uncertainties and dilemmas ex
perienced by American parents.
It is obvious that American
family life is under considerable
pressure to change in some way,
but for many parents it is un
clear what direction change
ought to take.
A continuing result of this
state of affairs is going to be
a particular kind of immaturity
among undergraduate students.
At times they will insist upon
being treated as adults, al
though their underlying inten
tion may be to exhort them
selves to act as adults. At other
times (perhaps on the very
same day) they will indignantly
refuse to conform to require
ments that the adults they know
accept for their own lives.
These circumstances require
a university to profer advice
and counseling of various kinds,
short-term diagnosis and ther
apy for stress situations, advice
concerning careers and voca
tions, and candid guidance con

cerning academic work during
the undergraduate years. Like
most universities, Stanford pres
ently has inadequate provisions
for all this. (One student sui
cide per year is one too many.)
It is essential to avoid trying
to compensate for inadequate
counseling and advising by for
mulating rules as a general sub
stitute. That is what most uni
versities have done in the past,
and it is visibly going to work
even more badly in the future
than in the past.
High School Deficient
Undergraduate students bring
with them to college the results
of the current deficiencies in
high school education. Efforts
have begun to remedy these de
ficiencies, but steady pressure
applied through standards de
fined by colleges is still very
much in order.
One of the worst deficiencies
is the feeble control of the En
glish language manifested in
varying degrees by some stu
dents. Associated with the im
maturity of their reading and
writing skills there is often a
general shallowness of exper
ience in and apptitude toward
humanistic studies, including
foreign languages and history.
Mere arrival at the university
does not liberate students, does
not even inform them of such
obstacles to their intellectual
freedom.
Thus the section in the posi
tion paper on "The Characteris
tics of Students" needs amend
ment. That section presents a
traditional ideal for undergrad
uate education, an ideal which
has been described (in Bacon's
phrase) as a "lucid interval" be
tween periods of subjection of
the mind, first to the family and
the school, later to the economic
and civic obligations of the
adult. What needs to be recog
nized now is that there is im
portant continuity between
these stages.
Undergraduate education may

be, as the position paper says,
"a time for general intellectual
and personal growth." But the
phrase is vague, and hence
evasive. On the one hand there
is often the need to compensate
for the failings of secondary
education, its emphasis on in
strumental utility, social relev
ance, and civic consensus, and
its low valuation of orginality
and of irrelevance or antagon
ism to prevailing social values,
and especially of the skills of
thought and communication. On
the other hand the choice of a
lifetime occupation can be made
only after trying out, so to
speak, several professional roles
with full but temporary com
mitment to each in turn.
In view of these complexities,
what sense is to be made of
the section in the position paper
which suggests that there will
be a "standard route" and it
recognizes that "the immature"
(i.e., most students) might, if
permitted to do so, "wander
aimlessly through the univers
ity." Why should there be a
standard route? How can a stu
dent avoid wandering "aim
lessly" if our purpose is to per
mit him to change his aims?
To be sure, there are sound
reasons for proceeding grad
ually in the application of new

Before imposing any require
ments on undergraduate stu
dents, it is appropriate to make
available the educational ex
periences which would justify
the requirements. It is possible
that providing such educationa 1
experiences will impede the
training of graduate students
and the pursuit of research in
terests â€”just as it has done and
is doing in the humanities and
the social sciences. It is also
possible that the scientific estab
lishment cannot be de-monastic

ized; if so, let us avoid ersatz
substitutions and pretence.
On the subject of the existing
requirement for study for math
ematics or a foreign language,
the position paper again fails to
make distinctions that ought to
have been made. It says "there
does not seem to be an adequate
basis for requiring all students
to attain a fixed level of pro
ficiency in a foreign language."
What stage of the student's
life is envisaged here? Arrival
in college, the end of the sopho
more year, or entrance (among
90 percent of recent graduates)
into graduate or professional
training? What is the purpose
of the assertion: To controvert
the conclusions reached by
Conant in his study of the Am
erican high school and the de
liberate policies of many high
schools? To suggest that the
undergraduate years are priv
ileged in that the student can
temporarily ignore what he has
already learned and what will
very probably be required of
him in the future? To deny the
facts of life in graduate schools?
It is evident that the proper
question is not whether all Stan
ford students ought to attain
proficiency in a foreign lan
guage. Instead, the question is
when and, secondarily, how and
with what relationship to other
academic work before or after
college? These questions must
precede consideration of a uni
versal requirement, and because
these questions have not even
been asked it is premature, to
say the least, to urge either
abandoning the existing re
quirement or making it more
practicable.
Neglecting this distinction be
tween stages of education, the
position paper attaches import
ance to a distinction between
mathematics and other lan
guages and attempts to justify
this by calling it "well recog
nized." What is mathematics if
it is not a language? And how
can the steering committee say
that there is not adequate basis
for imposing a requirement in
mathematics and then proceed
to offer social relevance as a
value to be sought in science
courses for the "non-scientist"?
If social relevance is consid
ered to depend on impact; there

is scarcely a discipline offering
greater social relevance than
mathematics. Or is the intended
meaning rather that the value
of a course lies In its obvious
ness? If the proposal to to dis
pense not only with many of the
existing formal requirements
(for which there would be
strong support in the faculty)
but with serious guidance of
any sort, then obviousness will
indeed be importantâ€”competi
tively. But it is not clear, for
tunately, that this really is the
proposal.
Position Paper Is Timid
The decisive flaw in the posi
tion paper is its timidity. Timid
ity in the face of the faculty,
who deserve to be informed that
they presently offer far too
many options and far too little
individual guidance to students,
and who need to be challenged
to reconsider in fundamental
terms the relationship between
purposes and rules. Timidity in
the face of the students, who are
not yet capable of judging the
value and meaning of the var
ious intellectual worlds consti
tuted by scholarly and scien
tific disciplines and who will
often, if left to themselves, seek
quick dividends and acquire edu
cational deficits.
A faculty member who sug
gests offering a course for un
dergraduate students ought not
to obtain permission for this
automatically or by default. A
student who entirely neglects a
large body of knowledge or an
intellectual skill ought not to be
thereafter awarded a diploma
certifying that he is educated.
The criteria and the means of
enforcement for both these
kinds of judgment need to be
thought through all over again
from time to time.
The Study of Education at
Stanford ought not to attempt
to patch existing programs by
offering small-scale experimen
tal "reforms." It ought to face
squarely the issues of purposes,
sanctions, and their interrela
tions.
This memorandum is a re
sponse to the position paper
issued by the steering commit
tee of the Study of Education
at Stanford, October 30, 1967,
entitled "Toward a More Flex
ible Undergraduate Program."
The steering committee at
taches greater importance to its
basic approach than to specific
proposals. The contention to be
outlined here is that this basic
approach is inadequate and
needs to be defined anew.
The object is set forth for
undergraduate education are
formulae for the acquisition of
knowledge, the critical evalua
tion of knowledge, and the ap
plication of knowledge or the
perception of its relation to the
environment. These are either
passive or purely instrumental.
Nothing in these phrases evokes
creative, original work of any
sort. The emphasis upon intel
lectual quality, which one would
expect to find, is reduced to a
reference to "rigor."
Doubtless the reformation of
the mind is an unusual occur
rence in the education of under
graduates. But this fact, if it is
a fact, does not justify the as
sumption seemingly made here,
that the minds of undergradu
ates are definitely formed and
that what is required is an in
fusion of something that can
later be applied or related to
real life.

The inadequacy of the steer
ing committee's definition of ob
jectives is related to the commit
tee's failure to present a clear
enough view of students as they
are.
Students Under Stress
Undergraduate students us
ually display characteristics that
result not only from the stress
ful stage of life they have rec
ently attained but also from the
uncertainties and dilemmas ex
perienced by American parents.
It is obvious that American
family life is under considerable
pressure to change in some way,
but for many parents it is un
clear what direction change
ought to take.
A continuing result of this
state of affairs is going to be
a particular kind of immaturity
among undergraduate students.
At times they will insist upon
being treated as adults, al
though their underlying inten
tion may be to exhort them
selves to act as adults. At other
times (perhaps on the very
same day) they will indignantly
refuse to conform to require
ments that the adults they know
accept for their own lives.
These circumstances require
a university to profer advice
and counseling of various kinds,
short-term diagnosis and ther
apy for stress situations, advice
concerning careers and voca
tions, and candid guidance con

cerning academic work during
the undergraduate years. Like
most universities, Stanford pres
ently has inadequate provisions
for all this. (One student sui
cide per year is one too many.)
It is essential to avoid trying
to compensate for inadequate
counseling and advising by for
mulating rules as a general sub
stitute. That is what most uni
versities have done in the past,
and it is visibly going to work
even more badly in the future
than in the past.
High School Deficient
Undergraduate students bring
with them to college the results
of the current deficiencies in
high school education. Efforts
have begun to remedy these de
ficiencies, but steady pressure
applied through standards de
fined by colleges is still very
much in order.
One of the worst deficiencies
is the feeble control of the En
glish language manifested in
varying degrees by some stu
dents. Associated with the im
maturity of their reading and
writing skills there is often a
general shallowness of exper
ience in and apptitude toward
humanistic studies, including
foreign languages and history.
Mere arrival at the university
does not liberate students, does
not even inform them of such
obstacles to their intellectual
freedom.
Thus the section in the posi
tion paper on "The Characteris
tics of Students" needs amend
ment. That section presents a
traditional ideal for undergrad
uate education, an ideal which
has been described (in Bacon's
phrase) as a "lucid interval" be
tween periods of subjection of
the mind, first to the family and
the school, later to the economic
and civic obligations of the
adult. What needs to be recog
nized now is that there is im
portant continuity between
these stages.
Undergraduate education may

be, as the position paper says,
"a time for general intellectual
and personal growth." But the
phrase is vague, and hence
evasive. On the one hand there
is often the need to compensate
for the failings of secondary
education, its emphasis on in
strumental utility, social relev
ance, and civic consensus, and
its low valuation of orginality
and of irrelevance or antagon
ism to prevailing social values,
and especially of the skills of
thought and communication. On
the other hand the choice of a
lifetime occupation can be made
only after trying out, so to
speak, several professional roles
with full but temporary com
mitment to each in turn.
In view of these complexities,
what sense is to be made of
the section in the position paper
which suggests that there will
be a "standard route" and it
recognizes that "the immature"
(i.e., most students) might, if
permitted to do so, "wander
aimlessly through the univers
ity." Why should there be a
standard route? How can a stu
dent avoid wandering "aim
lessly" if our purpose is to per
mit him to change his aims?
To be sure, there are sound
reasons for proceeding grad
ually in the application of new
rules. But that does not dictate
preservation of the existing sys
tem in our minds as we consider
college education. The failure
to examine the needs of under
graduates is combined, in the
later sections of the position
paper, with an assumption that
there must be something good
in the existing General Studies
program, which was in fact al
ready out-of-date at the time it
was adopted.
Remedial Work Needed
, The position paper offers no
recognition of the need for rem
edial or compensatory work in
reading and writing. "The culti
vation of these abilities should
be the responsibility of the en
tire faculty": that is, of no one
in particular. What is a faculty
member to do when he encoun
ters, as he all too frequently
does, a term paper that calls out
not for rewriting of the paper
but for retraining of the mind
that produced it?
The paragraph devoted to urg
ing alternatives for the Western
Civilization course begins with
the surprising assertion that his
torical studies have a transcend
ent methodological significance.
In fact, historical methods are
distinguished by, the weakness
and uncertainty of their philo
sophical and logical basis, and
the catch-as-catch-can proced
ures actually followed by his
torians. As for the applicability
of historical knowledge, that mi
lage has been dissipated by
Paul Freund: "Of history it may
be said briefly that its useful
ness varies inversely with the
weight of the demands made
on it." (Nomos VII, 1964, p. 114)

Accuracy and candor would
compel one to admit that the
value of the course in western
Civilization has consisted in (1)
its remedial usefulness for stu
dents who arrive in college ap
pallingly ignorant of their own
cultural past, and (2) the broad
perspective it supplies for the
individual student who contem
plates his own biographical ex
perience. The same would be
true, more or less, of any alter
native. For whom, then, is a
Western Civilization course or
some alternative desirable? As
suming that it is essential for
some students, how are they to
be identified?
Science Isn't Technology
Concerning the science re
quirement, also, just because the
existing rules are obviously un
satisfactory the matter needs to
be reconsidered in fundamental
terms. Here, the position paper
is useless. It refers to "science
and technology' as one "area of
learning," ignoring the differ
ence between them.
(The technologist, like the
physician or the lawyer, is con
fronted with problems for which
some solution must be found.
If it is an unsatisfactory solu
tion, that is regrettable, but one
must tolerate in practice the
best possible soluion. The posi
tion of the scientist is funda
mentally different. His work in
volves learned ignorance just as
much as does the work of a
philologist or a philosopher.)
Ways should be found to
cause students in the human
istic disciplines to share in the
scientific enterprise during part
of their education. What ap
pears to be needed is the ex
perience of doing some science:
an internalization of scientific
ways of thought. This requires
serious work in a scientific dis
cipline.
The history of science is im
portant in the study of history.
The philosophy of science is sig
nificant to a philosopher. The
social relevance of science is an
aspect of the study of society,
not science. None of these sub
stitutes provides the experience
of thinking as a scientist for the
time being. It is the task of the
science faculties to devise ways
of offering that experience, as
well as they can. Naturally
these will stress the nature and
methods of science, just as they
would do for students aiming to
become scientists.
Before imposing any require
ments on undergraduate stu
dents, it is appropriate to make
available the educational ex
periences which would justify
the requirements. It is possible
that providing such educationa 1
experiences will impede the
training of graduate students
and the pursuit of research in
terests â€”just as it has done and
is doing in the humanities and
the social sciences. It is also
possible that the scientific estab
lishment cannot be de-monastic

ized; if so, let us avoid ersatz
substitutions and pretence.
On the subject of the existing
requirement for study for math
ematics or a foreign language,
the position paper again fails to
make distinctions that ought to
have been made. It says "there
does not seem to be an adequate
basis for requiring all students
to attain a fixed level of pro
ficiency in a foreign language."
What stage of the student's
life is envisaged here? Arrival

more year, or entrance (among
90 percent of recent graduates)
into graduate or professional

of the assertion: To controvert

liberate policies of many high
schools? To suggest that the
undergraduate years are priv
ileged in that the student can
temporarily ignore what he has
already learned and what will
very probably be required of
him in the future? To deny the
facts of life in graduate schools?
It is evident that the proper
question is not whether all Stan
ford students ought to attain
proficiency in a foreign lan
guage. Instead, the question is
when and, secondarily, how and
with what relationship to other
academic work before or after
college? These questions must
precede consideration of a uni
versal requirement, and because
these questions have not even
been asked it is premature, to
say the least, to urge either
abandoning the existing re
quirement or making it more
practicable.
Neglecting this distinction be
tween stages of education, the
position paper attaches import
ance to a distinction between
mathematics and other lan
guages and attempts to justify
this by calling it "well recog
nized." What is mathematics if
it is not a language? And how
can the steering committee say
that there is not adequate basis
for imposing a requirement in
mathematics and then proceed
to offer social relevance as a
value to be sought in science
courses for the "non-scientist"?
If social relevance is consid
ered to depend on impact; there

is scarcely a discipline offering

mathematics. Or is the intended
meaning rather that the value

taches greater importance to its
basic approach than to specific
proposals. The contention to be
outlined here is that this basic
approach is inadequate and
needs to be defined anew.
The object is set forth for
undergraduate education are
formulae for the acquisition of
knowledge, the critical evalua
tion of knowledge, and the ap
plication of knowledge or the
perception of its relation to the
environment. These are either
passive or purely instrumental.
Nothing in these phrases evokes
creative, original work of any
sort. The emphasis upon intel
lectual quality, which one would
expect to find, is reduced to a
reference to "rigor."
Doubtless the reformation of
the mind is an unusual occur
rence in the education of under
graduates. But this fact, if it is
a fact, does not justify the as
sumption seemingly made here,
that the minds of undergradu
ates are definitely formed and
that what is required is an in
fusion of something that can
later be applied or related to
real life.

The inadequacy of the steer
ing committee's definition of ob
jectives is related to the commit
tee's failure to present a clear
enough view of students as they
are.
Students Under Stress
Undergraduate students us
ually display characteristics that
result not only from the stress
ful stage of life they have rec
ently attained but also from the
uncertainties and dilemmas ex
perienced by American parents.
It is obvious that American
family life is under considerable
pressure to change in some way,
but for many parents it is un
clear what direction change
ought to take.
A continuing result of this
state of affairs is going to be
a particular kind of immaturity
among undergraduate students.
At times they will insist upon
being treated as adults, al
though their underlying inten
tion may be to exhort them
selves to act as adults. At other
times (perhaps on the very
same day) they will indignantly
refuse to conform to require
ments that the adults they know
accept for their own lives.
These circumstances require
a university to profer advice
and counseling of various kinds,
short-term diagnosis and ther
apy for stress situations, advice
concerning careers and voca
tions, and candid guidance con

cerning academic work during
the undergraduate years. Like
most universities, Stanford pres
ently has inadequate provisions
for all this. (One student sui
cide per year is one too many.)
It is essential to avoid trying
to compensate for inadequate
counseling and advising by for
mulating rules as a general sub
stitute. That is what most uni
versities have done in the past,
and it is visibly going to work
even more badly in the future
than in the past.
High School Deficient
Undergraduate students bring
with them to college the results
of the current deficiencies in
high school education. Efforts
have begun to remedy these de
ficiencies, but steady pressure
applied through standards de
fined by colleges is still very
much in order.
One of the worst deficiencies
is the feeble control of the En
glish language manifested in
varying degrees by some stu
dents. Associated with the im
maturity of their reading and
writing skills there is often a
general shallowness of exper
ience in and apptitude toward
humanistic studies, including
foreign languages and history.
Mere arrival at the university
does not liberate students, does
not even inform them of such
obstacles to their intellectual
freedom.
Thus the section in the posi
tion paper on "The Characteris
tics of Students" needs amend
ment. That section presents a
traditional ideal for undergrad
uate education, an ideal which
has been described (in Bacon's
phrase) as a "lucid interval" be
tween periods of subjection of
the mind, first to the family and
the school, later to the economic
and civic obligations of the
adult. What needs to be recog
nized now is that there is im
portant continuity between
these stages.
Undergraduate education may

be, as the position paper says,
"a time for general intellectual
and personal growth." But the
phrase is vague, and hence
evasive. On the one hand there
is often the need to compensate
for the failings of secondary
education, its emphasis on in
strumental utility, social relev
ance, and civic consensus, and
its low valuation of orginality
and of irrelevance or antagon
ism to prevailing social values,
and especially of the skills of
thought and communication. On
the other hand the choice of a
lifetime occupation can be made
only after trying out, so to
speak, several professional roles
with full but temporary com
mitment to each in turn.
In view of these complexities,
what sense is to be made of
the section in the position paper
which suggests that there will
be a "standard route" and it
recognizes that "the immature"
(i.e., most students) might, if
permitted to do so, "wander
aimlessly through the univers
ity." Why should there be a
standard route? How can a stu
dent avoid wandering "aim
lessly" if our purpose is to per
mit him to change his aims?
To be sure, there are sound
reasons for proceeding grad
ually in the application of new
rules. But that does not dictate
preservation of the existing sys
tem in our minds as we consider
college education. The failure
to examine the needs of under
graduates is combined, in the
later sections of the position
paper, with an assumption that
there must be something good
in the existing General Studies
program, which was in fact al
ready out-of-date at the time it
was adopted.
Remedial Work Needed
, The position paper offers no
recognition of the need for rem
edial or compensatory work in
reading and writing. "The culti
vation of these abilities should
be the responsibility of the en
tire faculty": that is, of no one
in particular. What is a faculty
member to do when he encoun
ters, as he all too frequently
does, a term paper that calls out
not for rewriting of the paper
but for retraining of the mind
that produced it?
The paragraph devoted to urg
ing alternatives for the Western
Civilization course begins with
the surprising assertion that his
torical studies have a transcend
ent methodological significance.
In fact, historical methods are
distinguished by, the weakness
and uncertainty of their philo
sophical and logical basis, and
the catch-as-catch-can proced
ures actually followed by his
torians. As for the applicability
of historical knowledge, that mi
lage has been dissipated by
Paul Freund: "Of history it may
be said briefly that its useful
ness varies inversely with the
weight of the demands made
on it." (Nomos VII, 1964, p. 114)

Accuracy and candor would
compel one to admit that the
value of the course in western
Civilization has consisted in (1)
its remedial usefulness for stu
dents who arrive in college ap
pallingly ignorant of their own
cultural past, and (2) the broad
perspective it supplies for the
individual student who contem
plates his own biographical ex
perience. The same would be
true, more or less, of any alter
native. For whom, then, is a
Western Civilization course or
some alternative desirable? As
suming that it is essential for
some students, how are they to
be identified?
Science Isn't Technology
Concerning the science re
quirement, also, just because the
existing rules are obviously un
satisfactory the matter needs to
be reconsidered in fundamental
terms. Here, the position paper
is useless. It refers to "science
and technology' as one "area of
learning," ignoring the differ
ence between them.
(The technologist, like the
physician or the lawyer, is con
fronted with problems for which
some solution must be found.
If it is an unsatisfactory solu
tion, that is regrettable, but one
must tolerate in practice the
best possible soluion. The posi
tion of the scientist is funda
mentally different. His work in
volves learned ignorance just as
much as does the work of a
philologist or a philosopher.)
Ways should be found to
cause students in the human
istic disciplines to share in the
scientific enterprise during part
of their education. What ap
pears to be needed is the ex
perience of doing some science:
an internalization of scientific
ways of thought. This requires
serious work in a scientific dis
cipline.
The history of science is im
portant in the study of history.
The philosophy of science is sig
nificant to a philosopher. The
social relevance of science is an
aspect of the study of society,
not science. None of these sub
stitutes provides the experience
of thinking as a scientist for the
time being. It is the task of the
science faculties to devise ways
of offering that experience, as
well as they can. Naturally
these will stress the nature and
methods of science, just as they
would do for students aiming to
become scientists.
Before imposing any require
ments on undergraduate stu
dents, it is appropriate to make
available the educational ex
periences which would justify
the requirements. It is possible
that providing such educationa 1
experiences will impede the
training of graduate students
and the pursuit of research in
terests â€”just as it has done and
is doing in the humanities and
the social sciences. It is also
possible that the scientific estab
lishment cannot be de-monastic

ized; if so, let us avoid ersatz
substitutions and pretence.
On the subject of the existing
requirement for study for math
ematics or a foreign language,
the position paper again fails to
make distinctions that ought to
have been made. It says "there
does not seem to be an adequate
basis for requiring all students
to attain a fixed level of pro
ficiency in a foreign language."
What stage of the student's
life is envisaged here? Arrival
in college, the end of the sopho
more year, or entrance (among
90 percent of recent graduates)
into graduate or professional
training? What is the purpose
of the assertion: To controvert
the conclusions reached by
Conant in his study of the Am
erican high school and the de
liberate policies of many high
schools? To suggest that the
undergraduate years are priv
ileged in that the student can
temporarily ignore what he has
already learned and what will
very probably be required of
him in the future? To deny the
facts of life in graduate schools?
It is evident that the proper
question is not whether all Stan
ford students ought to attain
proficiency in a foreign lan
guage. Instead, the question is
when and, secondarily, how and
with what relationship to other
academic work before or after
college? These questions must
precede consideration of a uni
versal requirement, and because
these questions have not even
been asked it is premature, to
say the least, to urge either
abandoning the existing re
quirement or making it more
practicable.
Neglecting this distinction be
tween stages of education, the
position paper attaches import
ance to a distinction between
mathematics and other lan
guages and attempts to justify
this by calling it "well recog
nized." What is mathematics if
it is not a language? And how
can the steering committee say
that there is not adequate basis
for imposing a requirement in
mathematics and then proceed
to offer social relevance as a
value to be sought in science
courses for the "non-scientist"?
If social relevance is consid
ered to depend on impact; there

is scarcely a discipline offering
greater social relevance than
mathematics. Or is the intended
meaning rather that the value
of a course lies In its obvious
ness? If the proposal to to dis
pense not only with many of the
existing formal requirements
(for which there would be
strong support in the faculty)
but with serious guidance of
any sort, then obviousness will
indeed be importantâ€”competi
tively. But it is not clear, for
tunately, that this really is the
proposal.
Position Paper Is Timid
The decisive flaw in the posi
tion paper is its timidity. Timid
ity in the face of the faculty,
who deserve to be informed that
they presently offer far too
many options and far too little
individual guidance to students,
and who need to be challenged
to reconsider in fundamental
terms the relationship between
purposes and rules. Timidity in
the face of the students, who are
not yet capable of judging the
value and meaning of the var
ious intellectual worlds consti
tuted by scholarly and scien
tific disciplines and who will
often, if left to themselves, seek
quick dividends and acquire edu
cational deficits.
A faculty member who sug
gests offering a course for un
dergraduate students ought not
to obtain permission for this
automatically or by default. A
student who entirely neglects a
large body of knowledge or an
intellectual skill ought not to be
thereafter awarded a diploma
certifying that he is educated.
The criteria and the means of
enforcement for both these
kinds of judgment need to be
thought through all over again
from time to time.
The Study of Education at
Stanford ought not to attempt
to patch existing programs by
offering small-scale experimen
tal "reforms." It ought to face
squarely the issues of purposes,
sanctions, and their interrela
tions.
This memorandum is a re
sponse to the position paper
issued by the steering commit
tee of the Study of Education
at Stanford, October 30, 1967,
entitled "Toward a More Flex
ible Undergraduate Program."
The steering committee at
taches greater importance to its
basic approach than to specific
proposals. The contention to be
outlined here is that this basic
approach is inadequate and
needs to be defined anew.

creative, original work of any

lectual quality, which one would

the mind is an unusual occur

In view of these complexities,
what sense is to be made of
the section in the position paper
which suggests that there will
be a "standard route" and it
recognizes that "the immature"
(i.e., most students) might, if
permitted to do so, "wander
aimlessly through the univers
ity." Why should there be a
standard route? How can a stu
dent avoid wandering "aim
lessly" if our purpose is to per
mit him to change his aims?
To be sure, there are sound
reasons for proceeding grad
ually in the application of new
rules. But that does not dictate
preservation of the existing sys
tem in our minds as we consider
college education. The failure
to examine the needs of under
graduates is combined, in the
later sections of the position
paper, with an assumption that
there must be something good
in the existing General Studies
program, which was in fact al
ready out-of-date at the time it
was adopted.
Remedial Work Needed
, The position paper offers no
recognition of the need for rem
edial or compensatory work in
reading and writing. "The culti
vation of these abilities should
be the responsibility of the en
tire faculty": that is, of no one
in particular. What is a faculty
member to do when he encoun
ters, as he all too frequently
does, a term paper that calls out
not for rewriting of the paper
but for retraining of the mind
that produced it?
The paragraph devoted to urg
ing alternatives for the Western
Civilization course begins with
the surprising assertion that his
torical studies have a transcend
ent methodological significance.
In fact, historical methods are
distinguished by, the weakness
and uncertainty of their philo
sophical and logical basis, and
the catch-as-catch-can proced
ures actually followed by his
torians. As for the applicability
of historical knowledge, that mi
lage has been dissipated by
Paul Freund: "Of history it may
be said briefly that its useful
ness varies inversely with the
weight of the demands made
on it." (Nomos VII, 1964, p. 114)

Accuracy and candor would
compel one to admit that the
value of the course in western
Civilization has consisted in (1)
its remedial usefulness for stu
dents who arrive in college ap
pallingly ignorant of their own
cultural past, and (2) the broad
perspective it supplies for the
individual student who contem
plates his own biographical ex
perience. The same would be
true, more or less, of any alter
native. For whom, then, is a
Western Civilization course or
some alternative desirable? As
suming that it is essential for
some students, how are they to
be identified?
Science Isn't Technology
Concerning the science re
quirement, also, just because the
existing rules are obviously un
satisfactory the matter needs to
be reconsidered in fundamental
terms. Here, the position paper
is useless. It refers to "science
and technology' as one "area of
learning," ignoring the differ
ence between them.
(The technologist, like the
physician or the lawyer, is con
fronted with problems for which
some solution must be found.
If it is an unsatisfactory solu
tion, that is regrettable, but one
must tolerate in practice the
best possible soluion. The posi
tion of the scientist is funda
mentally different. His work in
volves learned ignorance just as
much as does the work of a
philologist or a philosopher.)
Ways should be found to
cause students in the human
istic disciplines to share in the
scientific enterprise during part
of their education. What ap
pears to be needed is the ex
perience of doing some science:
an internalization of scientific
ways of thought. This requires
serious work in a scientific dis
cipline.
The history of science is im
portant in the study of history.
The philosophy of science is sig
nificant to a philosopher. The
social relevance of science is an
aspect of the study of society,
not science. None of these sub
stitutes provides the experience
of thinking as a scientist for the
time being. It is the task of the
science faculties to devise ways
of offering that experience, as
well as they can. Naturally
these will stress the nature and
methods of science, just as they
would do for students aiming to
become scientists.
Before imposing any require
ments on undergraduate stu
dents, it is appropriate to make
available the educational ex
periences which would justify
the requirements. It is possible
that providing such educationa 1
experiences will impede the
training of graduate students
and the pursuit of research in
terests â€”just as it has done and
is doing in the humanities and
the social sciences. It is also
possible that the scientific estab
lishment cannot be de-monastic

ized; if so, let us avoid ersatz
substitutions and pretence.
On the subject of the existing
requirement for study for math
ematics or a foreign language,
the position paper again fails to
make distinctions that ought to
have been made. It says "there
does not seem to be an adequate
basis for requiring all students
to attain a fixed level of pro
ficiency in a foreign language."
What stage of the student's
life is envisaged here? Arrival
in college, the end of the sopho
more year, or entrance (among
90 percent of recent graduates)
into graduate or professional
training? What is the purpose
of the assertion: To controvert
the conclusions reached by
Conant in his study of the Am
erican high school and the de
liberate policies of many high
schools? To suggest that the
undergraduate years are priv
ileged in that the student can
temporarily ignore what he has
already learned and what will
very probably be required of
him in the future? To deny the
facts of life in graduate schools?
It is evident that the proper
question is not whether all Stan
ford students ought to attain
proficiency in a foreign lan
guage. Instead, the question is
when and, secondarily, how and
with what relationship to other
academic work before or after
college? These questions must
precede consideration of a uni
versal requirement, and because
these questions have not even
been asked it is premature, to
say the least, to urge either
abandoning the existing re
quirement or making it more
practicable.
Neglecting this distinction be
tween stages of education, the
position paper attaches import
ance to a distinction between
mathematics and other lan
guages and attempts to justify
this by calling it "well recog
nized." What is mathematics if
it is not a language? And how
can the steering committee say
that there is not adequate basis
for imposing a requirement in
mathematics and then proceed
to offer social relevance as a
value to be sought in science
courses for the "non-scientist"?
If social relevance is consid
ered to depend on impact; there

is scarcely a discipline offering
greater social relevance than
mathematics. Or is the intended
meaning rather that the value
of a course lies In its obvious
ness? If the proposal to to dis
pense not only with many of the
existing formal requirements
(for which there would be
strong support in the faculty)
but with serious guidance of
any sort, then obviousness will
indeed be importantâ€”competi
tively. But it is not clear, for
tunately, that this really is the
proposal.
Position Paper Is Timid
The decisive flaw in the posi
tion paper is its timidity. Timid
ity in the face of the faculty,
who deserve to be informed that
they presently offer far too
many options and far too little
individual guidance to students,
and who need to be challenged
to reconsider in fundamental
terms the relationship between
purposes and rules. Timidity in
the face of the students, who are
not yet capable of judging the
value and meaning of the var
ious intellectual worlds consti
tuted by scholarly and scien
tific disciplines and who will
often, if left to themselves, seek
quick dividends and acquire edu
cational deficits.
A faculty member who sug
gests offering a course for un
dergraduate students ought not
to obtain permission for this
automatically or by default. A
student who entirely neglects a
large body of knowledge or an
intellectual skill ought not to be
thereafter awarded a diploma
certifying that he is educated.
The criteria and the means of
enforcement for both these
kinds of judgment need to be
thought through all over again
from time to time.
The Study of Education at
Stanford ought not to attempt
to patch existing programs by
offering small-scale experimen
tal "reforms." It ought to face
squarely the issues of purposes,
sanctions, and their interrela
tions.
This memorandum is a re
sponse to the position paper
issued by the steering commit
tee of the Study of Education
at Stanford, October 30, 1967,
entitled "Toward a More Flex
ible Undergraduate Program."
The steering committee at
taches greater importance to its
basic approach than to specific
proposals. The contention to be
outlined here is that this basic
approach is inadequate and
needs to be defined anew.
The object is set forth for
undergraduate education are
formulae for the acquisition of
knowledge, the critical evalua
tion of knowledge, and the ap
plication of knowledge or the
perception of its relation to the
environment. These are either
passive or purely instrumental.
Nothing in these phrases evokes
creative, original work of any
sort. The emphasis upon intel
lectual quality, which one would
expect to find, is reduced to a
reference to "rigor."
Doubtless the reformation of
the mind is an unusual occur
rence in the education of under
graduates. But this fact, if it is
a fact, does not justify the as
sumption seemingly made here,
that the minds of undergradu
ates are definitely formed and
that what is required is an in
fusion of something that can
later be applied or related to
real life.

The inadequacy of the steer
ing committee's definition of ob
jectives is related to the commit
tee's failure to present a clear
enough view of students as they
are.
Students Under Stress
Undergraduate students us
ually display characteristics that
result not only from the stress
ful stage of life they have rec
ently attained but also from the
uncertainties and dilemmas ex
perienced by American parents.
It is obvious that American
family life is under considerable
pressure to change in some way,
but for many parents it is un
clear what direction change
ought to take.
A continuing result of this
state of affairs is going to be
a particular kind of immaturity
among undergraduate students.
At times they will insist upon
being treated as adults, al
though their underlying inten
tion may be to exhort them
selves to act as adults. At other
times (perhaps on the very
same day) they will indignantly
refuse to conform to require
ments that the adults they know
accept for their own lives.
These circumstances require
a university to profer advice
and counseling of various kinds,
short-term diagnosis and ther
apy for stress situations, advice
concerning careers and voca
tions, and candid guidance con

cerning academic work during
the undergraduate years. Like
most universities, Stanford pres
ently has inadequate provisions
for all this. (One student sui
cide per year is one too many.)
It is essential to avoid trying
to compensate for inadequate
counseling and advising by for
mulating rules as a general sub
stitute. That is what most uni
versities have done in the past,
and it is visibly going to work
even more badly in the future
than in the past.
High School Deficient
Undergraduate students bring
with them to college the results
of the current deficiencies in
high school education. Efforts
have begun to remedy these de
ficiencies, but steady pressure
applied through standards de
fined by colleges is still very
much in order.
One of the worst deficiencies
is the feeble control of the En
glish language manifested in
varying degrees by some stu
dents. Associated with the im
maturity of their reading and
writing skills there is often a
general shallowness of exper
ience in and apptitude toward
humanistic studies, including
foreign languages and history.
Mere arrival at the university
does not liberate students, does
not even inform them of such
obstacles to their intellectual
freedom.
Thus the section in the posi
tion paper on "The Characteris
tics of Students" needs amend
ment. That section presents a
traditional ideal for undergrad
uate education, an ideal which
has been described (in Bacon's
phrase) as a "lucid interval" be
tween periods of subjection of
the mind, first to the family and
the school, later to the economic
and civic obligations of the
adult. What needs to be recog
nized now is that there is im
portant continuity between
these stages.
Undergraduate education may

be, as the position paper says,
"a time for general intellectual
and personal growth." But the
phrase is vague, and hence
evasive. On the one hand there
is often the need to compensate
for the failings of secondary
education, its emphasis on in
strumental utility, social relev
ance, and civic consensus, and
its low valuation of orginality
and of irrelevance or antagon
ism to prevailing social values,
and especially of the skills of
thought and communication. On
the other hand the choice of a
lifetime occupation can be made
only after trying out, so to
speak, several professional roles
with full but temporary com
mitment to each in turn.
In view of these complexities,
what sense is to be made of
the section in the position paper
which suggests that there will
be a "standard route" and it
recognizes that "the immature"
(i.e., most students) might, if
permitted to do so, "wander
aimlessly through the univers
ity." Why should there be a
standard route? How can a stu
dent avoid wandering "aim
lessly" if our purpose is to per
mit him to change his aims?
To be sure, there are sound
reasons for proceeding grad
ually in the application of new
rules. But that does not dictate
preservation of the existing sys
tem in our minds as we consider
college education. The failure
to examine the needs of under

terests â€”just as it has done and
is doing in the humanities and
the social sciences. It is also
possible that the scientific estab
lishment cannot be de-monastic

ized; if so, let us avoid ersatz
substitutions and pretence.
On the subject of the existing
requirement for study for math
ematics or a foreign language,
the position paper again fails to
make distinctions that ought to
have been made. It says "there
does not seem to be an adequate
basis for requiring all students
to attain a fixed level of pro
ficiency in a foreign language."
What stage of the student's
life is envisaged here? Arrival
in college, the end of the sopho
more year, or entrance (among
90 percent of recent graduates)
into graduate or professional
training? What is the purpose
of the assertion: To controvert
the conclusions reached by
Conant in his study of the Am
erican high school and the de
liberate policies of many high
schools? To suggest that the
undergraduate years are priv
ileged in that the student can
temporarily ignore what he has
already learned and what will
very probably be required of
him in the future? To deny the
facts of life in graduate schools?
It is evident that the proper
question is not whether all Stan
ford students ought to attain
proficiency in a foreign lan
guage. Instead, the question is
when and, secondarily, how and
with what relationship to other
academic work before or after
college? These questions must
precede consideration of a uni
versal requirement, and because
these questions have not even
been asked it is premature, to
say the least, to urge either
abandoning the existing re
quirement or making it more
practicable.
Neglecting this distinction be
tween stages of education, the
position paper attaches import
ance to a distinction between
mathematics and other lan
guages and attempts to justify
this by calling it "well recog
nized." What is mathematics if
it is not a language? And how
can the steering committee say
that there is not adequate basis
for imposing a requirement in
mathematics and then proceed
to offer social relevance as a
value to be sought in science
courses for the "non-scientist"?
If social relevance is consid
ered to depend on impact; there

is scarcely a discipline offering
greater social relevance than
mathematics. Or is the intended
meaning rather that the value
of a course lies In its obvious
ness? If the proposal to to dis
pense not only with many of the
existing formal requirements
(for which there would be
strong support in the faculty)
but with serious guidance of
any sort, then obviousness will
indeed be importantâ€”competi
tively. But it is not clear, for
tunately, that this really is the
proposal.
Position Paper Is Timid
The decisive flaw in the posi
tion paper is its timidity. Timid
ity in the face of the faculty,
who deserve to be informed that
they presently offer far too
many options and far too little
individual guidance to students,
and who need to be challenged
to reconsider in fundamental
terms the relationship between
purposes and rules. Timidity in
the face of the students, who are
not yet capable of judging the
value and meaning of the var
ious intellectual worlds consti
tuted by scholarly and scien
tific disciplines and who will
often, if left to themselves, seek
quick dividends and acquire edu
cational deficits.
A faculty member who sug
gests offering a course for un
dergraduate students ought not
to obtain permission for this
automatically or by default. A
student who entirely neglects a
large body of knowledge or an
intellectual skill ought not to be
thereafter awarded a diploma
certifying that he is educated.
The criteria and the means of
enforcement for both these
kinds of judgment need to be
thought through all over again
from time to time.
The Study of Education at
Stanford ought not to attempt
to patch existing programs by
offering small-scale experimen
tal "reforms." It ought to face
squarely the issues of purposes,
sanctions, and their interrela
tions.
This memorandum is a re
sponse to the position paper
issued by the steering commit
tee of the Study of Education
at Stanford, October 30, 1967,
entitled "Toward a More Flex
ible Undergraduate Program."
The steering committee at
taches greater importance to its
basic approach than to specific
proposals. The contention to be
outlined here is that this basic
approach is inadequate and
needs to be defined anew.
The object is set forth for
undergraduate education are
formulae for the acquisition of
knowledge, the critical evalua
tion of knowledge, and the ap
plication of knowledge or the
perception of its relation to the
environment. These are either
passive or purely instrumental.
Nothing in these phrases evokes
creative, original work of any
sort. The emphasis upon intel
lectual quality, which one would
expect to find, is reduced to a
reference to "rigor."
Doubtless the reformation of
the mind is an unusual occur
rence in the education of under
graduates. But this fact, if it is
a fact, does not justify the as
sumption seemingly made here,
that the minds of undergradu
ates are definitely formed and
that what is required is an in
fusion of something that can
later be applied or related to
real life.

The inadequacy of the steer
ing committee's definition of ob
jectives is related to the commit
tee's failure to present a clear
enough view of students as they
are.
Students Under Stress
Undergraduate students us
ually display characteristics that
result not only from the stress
ful stage of life they have rec
ently attained but also from the
uncertainties and dilemmas ex
perienced by American parents.
It is obvious that American
family life is under considerable
pressure to change in some way,
but for many parents it is un
clear what direction change
ought to take.
A continuing result of this
state of affairs is going to be
a particular kind of immaturity
among undergraduate students.
At times they will insist upon
being treated as adults, al
though their underlying inten
tion may be to exhort them
selves to act as adults. At other
times (perhaps on the very
same day) they will indignantly
refuse to conform to require
ments that the adults they know
accept for their own lives.
These circumstances require
a university to profer advice
and counseling of various kinds,
short-term diagnosis and ther
apy for stress situations, advice
concerning careers and voca
tions, and candid guidance con

cerning academic work during
the undergraduate years. Like
most universities, Stanford pres
ently has inadequate provisions
for all this. (One student sui
cide per year is one too many.)
It is essential to avoid trying
to compensate for inadequate
counseling and advising by for
mulating rules as a general sub
stitute. That is what most uni
versities have done in the past,
and it is visibly going to work
even more badly in the future
than in the past.
High School Deficient
Undergraduate students bring
with them to college the results
of the current deficiencies in
high school education. Efforts
have begun to remedy these de
ficiencies, but steady pressure
applied through standards de
fined by colleges is still very
much in order.
One of the worst deficiencies
is the feeble control of the En
glish language manifested in
varying degrees by some stu
dents. Associated with the im
maturity of their reading and
writing skills there is often a
general shallowness of exper
ience in and apptitude toward
humanistic studies, including
foreign languages and history.
Mere arrival at the university
does not liberate students, does
not even inform them of such
obstacles to their intellectual
freedom.
Thus the section in the posi
tion paper on "The Characteris
tics of Students" needs amend
ment. That section presents a
traditional ideal for undergrad
uate education, an ideal which
has been described (in Bacon's
phrase) as a "lucid interval" be
tween periods of subjection of
the mind, first to the family and
the school, later to the economic
and civic obligations of the
adult. What needs to be recog
nized now is that there is im
portant continuity between
these stages.
Undergraduate education may

be, as the position paper says,
"a time for general intellectual
and personal growth." But the
phrase is vague, and hence
evasive. On the one hand there
is often the need to compensate
for the failings of secondary
education, its emphasis on in
strumental utility, social relev
ance, and civic consensus, and
its low valuation of orginality
and of irrelevance or antagon
ism to prevailing social values,
and especially of the skills of
thought and communication. On
the other hand the choice of a
lifetime occupation can be made
only after trying out, so to
speak, several professional roles
with full but temporary com
mitment to each in turn.
In view of these complexities,
what sense is to be made of
the section in the position paper
which suggests that there will
be a "standard route" and it
recognizes that "the immature"
(i.e., most students) might, if
permitted to do so, "wander
aimlessly through the univers
ity." Why should there be a
standard route? How can a stu
dent avoid wandering "aim
lessly" if our purpose is to per
mit him to change his aims?
To be sure, there are sound
reasons for proceeding grad
ually in the application of new
rules. But that does not dictate
preservation of the existing sys
tem in our minds as we consider
college education. The failure
to examine the needs of under
graduates is combined, in the
later sections of the position
paper, with an assumption that
there must be something good
in the existing General Studies
program, which was in fact al
ready out-of-date at the time it
was adopted.
Remedial Work Needed
, The position paper offers no
recognition of the need for rem
edial or compensatory work in
reading and writing. "The culti
vation of these abilities should
be the responsibility of the en
tire faculty": that is, of no one
in particular. What is a faculty
member to do when he encoun
ters, as he all too frequently
does, a term paper that calls out
not for rewriting of the paper
but for retraining of the mind
that produced it?
The paragraph devoted to urg
ing alternatives for the Western
Civilization course begins with
the surprising assertion that his
torical studies have a transcend
ent methodological significance.
In fact, historical methods are
distinguished by, the weakness
and uncertainty of their philo
sophical and logical basis, and
the catch-as-catch-can proced
ures actually followed by his
torians. As for the applicability
of historical knowledge, that mi
lage has been dissipated by
Paul Freund: "Of history it may
be said briefly that its useful
ness varies inversely with the
weight of the demands made
on it." (Nomos VII, 1964, p. 114)

Accuracy and candor would
compel one to admit that the
value of the course in western
Civilization has consisted in (1)
its remedial usefulness for stu
dents who arrive in college ap
pallingly ignorant of their own
cultural past, and (2) the broad
perspective it supplies for the
individual student who contem
plates his own biographical ex
perience. The same would be
true, more or less, of any alter
native. For whom, then, is a
Western Civilization course or
some alternative desirable? As
suming that it is essential for
some students, how are they to
be identified?
Science Isn't Technology
Concerning the science re
quirement, also, just because the
existing rules are obviously un
satisfactory the matter needs to
be reconsidered in fundamental
terms. Here, the position paper
is useless. It refers to "science
and technology' as one "area of
learning," ignoring the differ
ence between them.
(The technologist, like the
physician or the lawyer, is con
fronted with problems for which
some solution must be found.
If it is an unsatisfactory solu
tion, that is regrettable, but one
must tolerate in practice the
best possible soluion. The posi
tion of the scientist is funda
mentally different. His work in
volves learned ignorance just as
much as does the work of a
philologist or a philosopher.)
Ways should be found to
cause students in the human
istic disciplines to share in the
scientific enterprise during part
of their education. What ap
pears to be needed is the ex
perience of doing some science:
an internalization of scientific
ways of thought. This requires
serious work in a scientific dis
cipline.
The history of science is im
portant in the study of history.
The philosophy of science is sig
nificant to a philosopher. The
social relevance of science is an
aspect of the study of society,
not science. None of these sub
stitutes provides the experience
of thinking as a scientist for the
time being. It is the task of the
science faculties to devise ways
of offering that experience, as
well as they can. Naturally
these will stress the nature and
methods of science, just as they
would do for students aiming to
become scientists.
Before imposing any require
ments on undergraduate stu
dents, it is appropriate to make
available the educational ex
periences which would justify
the requirements. It is possible
that providing such educationa 1
experiences will impede the
training of graduate students
and the pursuit of research in
terests â€”just as it has done and
is doing in the humanities and
the social sciences. It is also
possible that the scientific estab
lishment cannot be de-monastic

ized; if so, let us avoid ersatz
substitutions and pretence.
On the subject of the existing
requirement for study for math
ematics or a foreign language,
the position paper again fails to
make distinctions that ought to
have been made. It says "there
does not seem to be an adequate
basis for requiring all students
to attain a fixed level of pro
ficiency in a foreign language."
What stage of the student's
life is envisaged here? Arrival
in college, the end of the sopho
more year, or entrance (among
90 percent of recent graduates)
into graduate or professional
training? What is the purpose
of the assertion: To controvert

erican high school and the de
liberate policies of many high
schools? To suggest that the
undergraduate years are priv
ileged in that the student can
temporarily ignore what he has
already learned and what will
very probably be required of
him in the future? To deny the
facts of life in graduate schools?
It is evident that the proper
question is not whether all Stan
ford students ought to attain
proficiency in a foreign lan
guage. Instead, the question is
when and, secondarily, how and
with what relationship to other
academic work before or after
college? These questions must
precede consideration of a uni
versal requirement, and because
these questions have not even
been asked it is premature, to
say the least, to urge either
abandoning the existing re
quirement or making it more
practicable.
Neglecting this distinction be
tween stages of education, the
position paper attaches import
ance to a distinction between
mathematics and other lan
guages and attempts to justify
this by calling it "well recog
nized." What is mathematics if
it is not a language? And how
can the steering committee say
that there is not adequate basis
for imposing a requirement in
mathematics and then proceed
to offer social relevance as a
value to be sought in science
courses for the "non-scientist"?
If social relevance is consid
ered to depend on impact; there

is scarcely a discipline offering
greater social relevance than
mathematics. Or is the intended
meaning rather that the value
of a course lies In its obvious

tion of knowledge, and the ap
plication of knowledge or the
perception of its relation to the
environment. These are either
passive or purely instrumental.
Nothing in these phrases evokes
creative, original work of any
sort. The emphasis upon intel
lectual quality, which one would
expect to find, is reduced to a
reference to "rigor."
Doubtless the reformation of
the mind is an unusual occur
rence in the education of under
graduates. But this fact, if it is
a fact, does not justify the as
sumption seemingly made here,
that the minds of undergradu
ates are definitely formed and
that what is required is an in
fusion of something that can
later be applied or related to
real life.

The inadequacy of the steer
ing committee's definition of ob
jectives is related to the commit
tee's failure to present a clear
enough view of students as they
are.
Students Under Stress
Undergraduate students us
ually display characteristics that
result not only from the stress
ful stage of life they have rec
ently attained but also from the
uncertainties and dilemmas ex
perienced by American parents.
It is obvious that American
family life is under considerable
pressure to change in some way,
but for many parents it is un
clear what direction change
ought to take.
A continuing result of this
state of affairs is going to be
a particular kind of immaturity
among undergraduate students.
At times they will insist upon
being treated as adults, al
though their underlying inten
tion may be to exhort them
selves to act as adults. At other
times (perhaps on the very
same day) they will indignantly
refuse to conform to require
ments that the adults they know
accept for their own lives.
These circumstances require
a university to profer advice
and counseling of various kinds,
short-term diagnosis and ther
apy for stress situations, advice
concerning careers and voca
tions, and candid guidance con

cerning academic work during
the undergraduate years. Like
most universities, Stanford pres
ently has inadequate provisions
for all this. (One student sui
cide per year is one too many.)
It is essential to avoid trying
to compensate for inadequate
counseling and advising by for
mulating rules as a general sub
stitute. That is what most uni
versities have done in the past,
and it is visibly going to work
even more badly in the future
than in the past.
High School Deficient
Undergraduate students bring
with them to college the results
of the current deficiencies in
high school education. Efforts
have begun to remedy these de
ficiencies, but steady pressure
applied through standards de
fined by colleges is still very
much in order.
One of the worst deficiencies
is the feeble control of the En
glish language manifested in
varying degrees by some stu
dents. Associated with the im
maturity of their reading and
writing skills there is often a
general shallowness of exper
ience in and apptitude toward
humanistic studies, including
foreign languages and history.
Mere arrival at the university
does not liberate students, does
not even inform them of such
obstacles to their intellectual
freedom.
Thus the section in the posi
tion paper on "The Characteris
tics of Students" needs amend
ment. That section presents a
traditional ideal for undergrad
uate education, an ideal which
has been described (in Bacon's
phrase) as a "lucid interval" be
tween periods of subjection of
the mind, first to the family and
the school, later to the economic
and civic obligations of the
adult. What needs to be recog
nized now is that there is im
portant continuity between
these stages.
Undergraduate education may

be, as the position paper says,
"a time for general intellectual
and personal growth." But the
phrase is vague, and hence
evasive. On the one hand there
is often the need to compensate
for the failings of secondary
education, its emphasis on in
strumental utility, social relev
ance, and civic consensus, and
its low valuation of orginality
and of irrelevance or antagon
ism to prevailing social values,
and especially of the skills of
thought and communication. On
the other hand the choice of a
lifetime occupation can be made
only after trying out, so to
speak, several professional roles
with full but temporary com
mitment to each in turn.
In view of these complexities,
what sense is to be made of
the section in the position paper
which suggests that there will
be a "standard route" and it
recognizes that "the immature"
(i.e., most students) might, if
permitted to do so, "wander
aimlessly through the univers
ity." Why should there be a
standard route? How can a stu
dent avoid wandering "aim
lessly" if our purpose is to per
mit him to change his aims?
To be sure, there are sound
reasons for proceeding grad
ually in the application of new
rules. But that does not dictate
preservation of the existing sys
tem in our minds as we consider
college education. The failure
to examine the needs of under
graduates is combined, in the
later sections of the position
paper, with an assumption that
there must be something good
in the existing General Studies
program, which was in fact al
ready out-of-date at the time it
was adopted.
Remedial Work Needed
, The position paper offers no
recognition of the need for rem
edial or compensatory work in
reading and writing. "The culti
vation of these abilities should
be the responsibility of the en
tire faculty": that is, of no one
in particular. What is a faculty
member to do when he encoun
ters, as he all too frequently
does, a term paper that calls out
not for rewriting of the paper
but for retraining of the mind
that produced it?
The paragraph devoted to urg
ing alternatives for the Western
Civilization course begins with
the surprising assertion that his
torical studies have a transcend
ent methodological significance.
In fact, historical methods are
distinguished by, the weakness
and uncertainty of their philo
sophical and logical basis, and
the catch-as-catch-can proced
ures actually followed by his
torians. As for the applicability
of historical knowledge, that mi
lage has been dissipated by
Paul Freund: "Of history it may
be said briefly that its useful
ness varies inversely with the
weight of the demands made
on it." (Nomos VII, 1964, p. 114)

Accuracy and candor would
compel one to admit that the
value of the course in western
Civilization has consisted in (1)
its remedial usefulness for stu
dents who arrive in college ap
pallingly ignorant of their own
cultural past, and (2) the broad
perspective it supplies for the
individual student who contem
plates his own biographical ex
perience. The same would be
true, more or less, of any alter
native. For whom, then, is a
Western Civilization course or
some alternative desirable? As
suming that it is essential for
some students, how are they to
be identified?
Science Isn't Technology
Concerning the science re
quirement, also, just because the
existing rules are obviously un
satisfactory the matter needs to
be reconsidered in fundamental
terms. Here, the position paper
is useless. It refers to "science
and technology' as one "area of
learning," ignoring the differ
ence between them.
(The technologist, like the
physician or the lawyer, is con
fronted with problems for which
some solution must be found.
If it is an unsatisfactory solu
tion, that is regrettable, but one
must tolerate in practice the
best possible soluion. The posi
tion of the scientist is funda
mentally different. His work in
volves learned ignorance just as
much as does the work of a
philologist or a philosopher.)
Ways should be found to
cause students in the human
istic disciplines to share in the
scientific enterprise during part
of their education. What ap
pears to be needed is the ex
perience of doing some science:
an internalization of scientific
ways of thought. This requires
serious work in a scientific dis
cipline.
The history of science is im
portant in the study of history.
The philosophy of science is sig
nificant to a philosopher. The
social relevance of science is an
aspect of the study of society,
not science. None of these sub
stitutes provides the experience
of thinking as a scientist for the
time being. It is the task of the
science faculties to devise ways
of offering that experience, as
well as they can. Naturally
these will stress the nature and
methods of science, just as they
would do for students aiming to
become scientists.
Before imposing any require
ments on undergraduate stu
dents, it is appropriate to make
available the educational ex
periences which would justify
the requirements. It is possible
that providing such educationa 1
experiences will impede the
training of graduate students
and the pursuit of research in
terests â€”just as it has done and
is doing in the humanities and
the social sciences. It is also
possible that the scientific estab
lishment cannot be de-monastic

ized; if so, let us avoid ersatz
substitutions and pretence.
On the subject of the existing
requirement for study for math
ematics or a foreign language,
the position paper again fails to
make distinctions that ought to
have been made. It says "there
does not seem to be an adequate
basis for requiring all students
to attain a fixed level of pro
ficiency in a foreign language."
What stage of the student's
life is envisaged here? Arrival
in college, the end of the sopho
more year, or entrance (among
90 percent of recent graduates)
into graduate or professional
training? What is the purpose
of the assertion: To controvert
the conclusions reached by
Conant in his study of the Am
erican high school and the de
liberate policies of many high
schools? To suggest that the
undergraduate years are priv
ileged in that the student can
temporarily ignore what he has
already learned and what will
very probably be required of
him in the future? To deny the
facts of life in graduate schools?
It is evident that the proper
question is not whether all Stan
ford students ought to attain
proficiency in a foreign lan
guage. Instead, the question is
when and, secondarily, how and
with what relationship to other
academic work before or after
college? These questions must
precede consideration of a uni
versal requirement, and because
these questions have not even
been asked it is premature, to
say the least, to urge either
abandoning the existing re
quirement or making it more
practicable.
Neglecting this distinction be
tween stages of education, the
position paper attaches import
ance to a distinction between
mathematics and other lan
guages and attempts to justify
this by calling it "well recog
nized." What is mathematics if
it is not a language? And how
can the steering committee say
that there is not adequate basis
for imposing a requirement in
mathematics and then proceed
to offer social relevance as a
value to be sought in science
courses for the "non-scientist"?
If social relevance is consid
ered to depend on impact; there

is scarcely a discipline offering
greater social relevance than
mathematics. Or is the intended
meaning rather that the value
of a course lies In its obvious
ness? If the proposal to to dis
pense not only with many of the
existing formal requirements
(for which there would be
strong support in the faculty)
but with serious guidance of
any sort, then obviousness will
indeed be importantâ€”competi
tively. But it is not clear, for
tunately, that this really is the
proposal.
Position Paper Is Timid
The decisive flaw in the posi
tion paper is its timidity. Timid
ity in the face of the faculty,
who deserve to be informed that
they presently offer far too
many options and far too little
individual guidance to students,
and who need to be challenged
to reconsider in fundamental
terms the relationship between
purposes and rules. Timidity in
the face of the students, who are
not yet capable of judging the
value and meaning of the var
ious intellectual worlds consti
tuted by scholarly and scien
tific disciplines and who will
often, if left to themselves, seek
quick dividends and acquire edu
cational deficits.
A faculty member who sug
gests offering a course for un
dergraduate students ought not
to obtain permission for this
automatically or by default. A
student who entirely neglects a
large body of knowledge or an
intellectual skill ought not to be
thereafter awarded a diploma
certifying that he is educated.
The criteria and the means of
enforcement for both these
kinds of judgment need to be
thought through all over again
from time to time.
The Study of Education at
Stanford ought not to attempt
to patch existing programs by
offering small-scale experimen
tal "reforms." It ought to face
squarely the issues of purposes,
sanctions, and their interrela
tions.
