I will confine my remarks to
two issues raised in Professor
Dawson's critique.
First, Professor Dawson
points out that the phrase "a
time for general intellectual and
personal growth" is vague,
hence evasive. He goes on to
say that one's undergraduate
years should be, among other
things, a time when several pro
fessional roles are pursued with
a full but temporary commit
ment to each.
I agree that "intellectual and
personal growth" is inadequat
ely defined. The sort of growth
that I believe we have in mind
is more clearly spelled out
where we observe that the great
majority of our students will
go on to graduate studies and
suggest that a student's ability
to educate himself will be an
important skill for this later
endeavor.
An increased facility in self
education is the sort of intel
lectual growth that I think is
most essential and most deserv
ing of cultivation. It involves
not only listening and talking,
but also reading, writing, re
flecting and self-testing in a
combination that each student
has found by experiment to be
most nearly optimum.
Of course facility at self- edu
cation (or graduate maturity
as it is sometimes called) is only
one of the ingredients necessary
for productive graduate study.
A student also has to make a
realistic choice of his special
field of study, and here the
paper is also vague. We say
that pre-professional work
should be deemphasized but do
not suggest a substitute for it.
Personally, I think Professor
Dawson's suggestion that a stu
dent try a "full but temporary
commitment" to several poten
tially interesting areas is an
excellent way to choose a career.
The second issue that I would
like to discuss is the position
Professor Dawson appears to
take regarding science educa

tion for the non-scientist. He
says that ways should be found
to cause students in the hu
manistic disciplines to share in
the scientific enterprise and that
these ways should involve "do
ing some science," the objective
being to internalize scientific
ways of thought.
I believe the idea that non
scientists must do some science
to become educated about sci
ence leads to serious defects in
science courses for the non
scientist. The usual thing that
happens is that departments
give one type of course for ma
jors and an entirely different
course for non-majors.
The course for non-majors
frequently suffers from the fact
that the science that is done
is either too qualitative or too
elementary to really help a non
scientist internalize scientific
ways of thought. The course for
non-majors also suffers from the
absence of potential majors be
cause of both the lower fre
quency of lively class discussion
and the difficulty of maintaining
long term faculty enthusiasm.
At the same time, the course
for majors hardly touches on
the social relevance of the dis
cipline.
Design A New Course
I think some of these prob
lems could be avoided if each
of the science departments were
to design a special course to
meet the needs of both poten
tial majors in the field and of
non-majors.
One possibility would be a one
quarter, no prerequisite course
in which a first-class scientists
and lecturer would discuss in
depth a few problems of cur
rent interest, using some of the
main concepts and methods in
his discipline.
Students taking the course for
general studies credit would
only be required to attend these
lectures, do some general read
ing, and work a representative
selection of good problems or
perhaps do a term paper. The
course could be supplemented

by more detailed lectures and
possibly a basic laboratory for
the potential major (optional
for the non-major).
While such a course could not
pretend to cover a discipline, I
think non-scientists could in
ternalize scientific ways of
thought more easily by observ
ing a first-class scientist at work
on interesting problems than by
doing some elementary science.
The potential majors would
benefit both through a consider
ation of the social relevance of
their discipline and because they
would get to see some of the
current problems in the field
discussed in a larger scientific
context than they presently do
in their first courses.

science courses for the non
scientist. The usual thing that
happens is that departments
give one type of course for ma
jors and an entirely different
course for non-majors.
The course for non-majors
frequently suffers from the fact
that the science that is done
is either too qualitative or too
elementary to really help a non
scientist internalize scientific
ways of thought. The course for
non-majors also suffers from the
absence of potential majors be
cause of both the lower fre
quency of lively class discussion
and the difficulty of maintaining
long term faculty enthusiasm.
At the same time, the course
for majors hardly touches on
the social relevance of the dis
cipline.
Design A New Course
I think some of these prob
lems could be avoided if each
of the science departments were
to design a special course to
meet the needs of both poten
tial majors in the field and of
non-majors.
One possibility would be a one
quarter, no prerequisite course
in which a first-class scientists
and lecturer would discuss in
depth a few problems of cur
rent interest, using some of the
main concepts and methods in
his discipline.
Students taking the course for
general studies credit would
only be required to attend these
lectures, do some general read
ing, and work a representative
selection of good problems or
perhaps do a term paper. The
course could be supplemented

by more detailed lectures and
possibly a basic laboratory for
the potential major (optional
for the non-major).
While such a course could not
pretend to cover a discipline, I
think non-scientists could in
ternalize scientific ways of
thought more easily by observ
ing a first-class scientist at work
on interesting problems than by
doing some elementary science.
The potential majors would
benefit both through a consider
ation of the social relevance of
their discipline and because they
would get to see some of the
current problems in the field
discussed in a larger scientific
context than they presently do
in their first courses.
I will confine my remarks to
two issues raised in Professor
Dawson's critique.
First, Professor Dawson
points out that the phrase "a
time for general intellectual and
personal growth" is vague,
hence evasive. He goes on to
say that one's undergraduate
years should be, among other
things, a time when several pro
fessional roles are pursued with
a full but temporary commit
ment to each.
I agree that "intellectual and
personal growth" is inadequat
ely defined. The sort of growth
that I believe we have in mind
is more clearly spelled out
where we observe that the great
majority of our students will
go on to graduate studies and
suggest that a student's ability
to educate himself will be an
important skill for this later
endeavor.
An increased facility in self
education is the sort of intel
lectual growth that I think is
most essential and most deserv
ing of cultivation. It involves
not only listening and talking,
but also reading, writing, re
flecting and self-testing in a
combination that each student
has found by experiment to be
most nearly optimum.
Of course facility at self- edu
cation (or graduate maturity
as it is sometimes called) is only
one of the ingredients necessary
for productive graduate study.
A student also has to make a
realistic choice of his special
field of study, and here the
paper is also vague. We say
that pre-professional work
should be deemphasized but do
not suggest a substitute for it.
Personally, I think Professor
Dawson's suggestion that a stu
dent try a "full but temporary
commitment" to several poten
tially interesting areas is an
excellent way to choose a career.
The second issue that I would
like to discuss is the position
Professor Dawson appears to
take regarding science educa

tion for the non-scientist. He
says that ways should be found
to cause students in the hu
manistic disciplines to share in
the scientific enterprise and that
these ways should involve "do
ing some science," the objective
being to internalize scientific
ways of thought.
I believe the idea that non
scientists must do some science
to become educated about sci
ence leads to serious defects in
science courses for the non
scientist. The usual thing that
happens is that departments
give one type of course for ma
jors and an entirely different
course for non-majors.
The course for non-majors
