Mr. Michael Sweeney of The
Daily has asked me, along with
other members of the Steering
Committee of the Study of Edu
cation at Stanford, to respond to
Professor Philip Dawson's mem
orandum on the position paper
"Toward a More Flexible Un
dergraduate Program."
It is important to recognize at
the outset that the SES position
paper was intended to promote
discussion and response, and not
to present specific proposals and
final decisions. Many of the re
sponses that have been gener
ated contained constructive
ideas and suggestions. As ex
amples, useful discussions have
been held with the language
faculties, and a novel and inter
esting proposal has been made
for the teaching of English com
position.
To start with, one of the mat
ters that distresses Professor
Dawson is the reference in the
position paper to a "standard
route" for undergraduate stu
dents. However, this is not at
all the monolithic set of require
ments that is characteristic of
most colleges today, but rather
consists of a series of norms
that differ in different disci
plines, and from which reason
able deviations are to be en
couraged.

The hope expressed in the
position paper that the imma
ture will not be permitted to
"wander aimlessly through the
university" is not at all incon
sistent with Professor Dawson's
view that students should be
allowed to try out "several pro
fessional roles with full but
temporary commitment to each
in turn."
With regard to the science
requirement, Professor Dawson
regards the position paper as
"useless," since the "existing
rules are obviously unsatisfac
tory," and also since the posi
tion paper "refers to 'science
and technology' as one 'area of
learning,' ignoring the differ
ence between them."
The scientists and engineers
on the steering committee are,
of course, well aware of the
distinction between science and
technology that is elaborated by
Professor Dawson, as are most
of our colleagues throughout
the University. Our intention
was not to lump science and
technology together, any more
than we would lump all of the
social sciences or all of the hu
manities together.
Rather, we wanted to insure
that technology would not be
forgotten in the process of di
viding learning into broad areas.
Further, there is much of

value to be learned, by non
scientist, scientist, and engineer
alike, concerning the interaction
between the development of the
conceptual apparatus of science
on the one hand, and the de
velopment of the practical ap
paratus of technology on the
other.
My final comment has to do
with the next to the last para
graph of Professor Dawson's
memorandum. In an exercise of
the kind represented by the
position paper, it is always nec
essary to steer a course between
an excess of timidity and an
excess of zeal; it is never pos
sible to satisfy all the readers,
and criticism has been received
on both scores. However, Pro
fessor Dawson's accusation of
timidity based on the offer of
too much freedom to the stu
dent seems to be inconsistent
with his earlier comment that
students must not be allowed
to "wander aimlessly." In my
opinion, the position paper
adopts a reasonable stance be
tween these opposing extremes,
both of which appear desirable
to Professor Dawson.
In any event, the discussion
and response stimulated by the
position paper will surely
stregthen the final recommenda
tions on the undergraduate pro
gram that will ultimately
emerge from the SES.
