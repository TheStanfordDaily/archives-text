# Campus Burglars Remain At Large
## 
### 
A wave of recent burglaries
at Stanford has prompted the
police to seek greater citizen
cooperation in law enforcement
on campus.
Santa Clara County detectives
as well as the campus police
asked for an increased alertness
on the part of citizens in report
ing suspicious persons and cir
cumstances as soon as they are
noticed.
In making this request the
Stanford Police Department
stressed the difficulties in cov
ering the wide-open campus.
Latest crimes, which began
during the Christmas holidays,
were the taking of stereo equip
ment from the lounges of two
men's dormitories. Discovered
missing Wednesday was a $150
stereo receiver from the Larkin
lounge in Stern and a $500
stereo sound system from the
Otero lounge in Wilbur.
Detectives found that wires
had been cut and the equipment
ripped from its moorings.
Lan Arnold, coincidentally a
resident of Otero, also reported
last Wednesday the theft of his
$270 camera.
Shortly after returning for
registration a Storey house girl
discovered that her $270 stereo
set had been stolen from her
room.
On December 26 four electric
typewriters valued at more than
$1,500 were reported stolen from

the chemistry department and
the Stanford Repertory Thea
ter.
One unusual burglarly during
November was the theft of 20
pipes from the organ in Me
morial Church. This crime re
mained unsolved yesterday.
