# Professors Petition Congress; Knock Viet Economics, Surtax
## 
### 
A group of 320 economists
from 50 colleges and universities
has expressed opposition to the
Johnson Administration's fiscal
policies because of the war in
Vietnam.
"An Open Letter to Congress
Against the War Tax" charges
the Administration with "stub
bornly refusing to accept a re
alistic view of the impasse in
Vietnam."
The petition was sponsored by
six economists, including John
G. Gurley, professor of econo
mics at Stanford.
The other originators are Was
sily Leontief of Harvard, Ken
neth Boulding of the University
of Colorado, R. A. Gordon of
Berkeley, Edwin Kuh of MIT,
and Robert Eisner of Northwest
ern.
The group contends that the
war is a major source of the na
tion's economic difficulties, as
serting that "as long as $2 bil
lion of American resources pour
into Vietnam every month, the
needy will remain the war's
chief victims.
"By this fiscal year's end," the
320 say, "more than $750 for
every household will have been
dissipated on the conflict. The
underprivileged and children in
crowded schools are made to
wait."
According to Gurley, Joseph
Pechman, an economist at the
Brookings Instition, circulated a
petition on behalf of the admini
stration about four months ago

asking economists to support
Johnson's proposal to raise
taxes.
"It was in response to this
that several economists got up
sort of a counter petition to op
pose the surtax proposal," Gur
ley said.
Robert Eisner, economist at
Northwestern, sent around a
letter telling economists why he
was against the Johnson pro
posal and why he wasn't going
to sign the Pechman letter.
"In response to Eisner's let
ter," Gurley commented, "about
five of us worked out a state
ment in petition form so that

other economists could sign.
We've been sending this around
the country for the last six
weeks.
"It's really a political stand,"
continued. "We're not saying
as economists that there's a poor
economic case for the surtax.
There's probably a pretty good
economic case to be made for
the surtax, but we're against the
surtax on political grounds."
The petition urges Congress
not to pass the proposed surtax
on incomes.
A refusal to pass the surtax,
the group says, will restrain
further intensification.
