# 'We Love You'
## MFU Store Shows Pop Art 
### MARY HAGAN 
The frustrated artists of the
Midpeninsula Free University
(MFU) display their wares in a
quiet, almost "respectable," if
somewhat shabby store in Men
lo Park.
Committed to supporting the
artistic expression of its mem
bers, the MFU plans to subsi
dize the store indefinitely as an
outlet for those who otherwise
would not be able to sell or ex
hibit their work.
Featuring nothing more out
rageous than one purple wall
and a ban-the-bra activist as a
volunteer sales girl, the MFU
store, 1061 El Camino Real, is a
concoction of soft-throbbing
soul music, homemade candles,
and all sorts of priced works of
art.
We Love You
The "Come in and browse—
We Love You" sign hanging on
the door attracts the curious
and faithful. In one corner
a hip suburban matron replete
strolls with genuine imitation
leopard skin coat, carefully coif
fured "innocent blonde" hair,
boots, and truly "groovy" coun
tenance.
An almost reverential air per
vades the premises. The quiet is
occasianally punctuated by the
nervous giggle of short-haired
boys reading roomate requests

on the bulletin board or by the
gentle slurping of ice cream
cones by junior high school
girls.
"Don't Push Me In the Swim
ming Pool; I Just Got My Per
iod" is a $150 creation offering
one gilded Barbie Doll, one gil
ded Ken Doll (both complete
with swimming suits), one gil
ded cherub and two green
leaves, all on a red background.
For those searching for some
thing a bit more economical,
there is the genuine "Zodiac
Candle Holder" $6.00 (Candle
Not Included) Custom Made In
Your Zodiac Sign." Such rela
tive oddities as an American
flag can also be found among
the paper flowers.
The store operates on a 70-30
commission basis with the arti
sans. Working on a non-profit
basis and paying no taxes), the
store uses the funds it receives
to cover running expenses. Any
additional money goes toward
payment of the initial cost of
establishment.
The shop is open eleven to

nine or ten, six or seven days a
week, depending on when volun
teer help will work.

The frustrated artists of the
Midpeninsula Free University
(MFU) display their wares in a
quiet, almost "respectable," if
somewhat shabby store in Men
lo Park.
Committed to supporting the
artistic expression of its mem
bers, the MFU plans to subsi
dize the store indefinitely as an
outlet for those who otherwise
would not be able to sell or ex
hibit their work.
Featuring nothing more out
rageous than one purple wall
and a ban-the-bra activist as a
volunteer sales girl, the MFU
store, 1061 El Camino Real, is a
concoction of soft-throbbing
soul music, homemade candles,
and all sorts of priced works of
art.
We Love You
The "Come in and browse—
We Love You" sign hanging on
the door attracts the curious
and faithful. In one corner
a hip suburban matron replete
strolls with genuine imitation
leopard skin coat, carefully coif
fured "innocent blonde" hair,
boots, and truly "groovy" coun
tenance.
An almost reverential air per
vades the premises. The quiet is
occasianally punctuated by the
nervous giggle of short-haired
boys reading roomate requests

on the bulletin board or by the
gentle slurping of ice cream
cones by junior high school
girls.
