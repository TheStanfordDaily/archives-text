# KZSU To Air Radio Moscow
## 
### 
In what may well be a first
for American public radio, KZSU
(90.1 FM) at Stanford will be
gin to rebroadcast the English
language Radio Moscow news
at 9:30 p.m. each Thursday start
ing next week, unless there is
exceptional atmospheric interfer
ence.
"Most Americans are not
aware of the relatively small
number of news sources which
govern their conception of world
events," commented Ralph Peer,
a Business School students who
is working on the project.
"We would hope that by pre
senting 'news' with a very dif
ferent viewpoint our listeners
will be able to better evaluate
the objectivity of their tradition
al news sources," he continued.
Expansion of this type of
broadcasting is contemplated if
response to the experiment in
dicates it is warranted. The sche
dule could be expanded to in
clude broadcasts from Peking
and Havana and other countries
that broadcast English language
programs to the U.S. on a daily
basis.
