# On The Knoll:
## Music Archive Saves Old Sounds 
### 
Stanford's Archive of Re
corded Sound, now heading for
its 10th anniversary, is long on
recordings and short on funds.
Begun in the late 1950's under
Archivist Edward C o 1 by, it
forms a part of the University's
massive library system, al
though it is headquartered on
the Knoll with the Music De
partment.
It was off to a good start in
1959 with 10,000 discs, 139 tapes,
and a substantial number of
Thomas Edison's old cylinder
type recordings.
Now it has burgeoned Into a
repository of 55,000 records, 700
piano rolls, a corresponding in
crease in long-play recordings
and tapes, and boasts a repre
sentative collection of oldtlme
phonographs. Duplicates are
weeded out and sold periodically.
Musical Oddity
The archive is also the U.S.
distribution point for a record
buff's "jewel": a seven-inch, 45
rpm dubbing of Soprano Mar
cella Sembrich singing Strauss'
"Voices of Spring." This oddity
was re recorded from a five-inch
wax cylinder originally recorded
in 1900. The music library aug
ments its income slightly with
sales of the record at $1.50 each,

along with reprints of four orig
inal Bettinl catalogs.
The archive has acquired a
substantial collection of jazz
records of the '30's and '40's,
most recently a 22,000-record
gift of jazz and early popular
78-rpm discs from a Los An
geles record shop.
It also has acquired the serv
ices of Ed Linotti, a record col
lector in his own right, who is
Colby's principal library assist
ant.
Teaching Aids
The archive's chief function is
to offer students an opportunity
to hear recitals by the great
artists of the past and to pro
vide a valuable source of teach
ing aids for Stanford instru
mental and vocal coaches.
"The study of these recitals,"
says Archivist Colby, "especially
of those artists who created
roles under the direction of the
composers themselves, offers
major assistance in the re-crea
tion of authentic interpreta
tions."
But the Stanford archivist
fears that even recent material
is in danger of dispersion and
destruction.
"Smaller firms with unique
recordings to their credit have
gone out of business. Non-com

mercial recordings are especially
elusive. We'd like to get repre
sentative examples of all these
before they disappear," Colby
says.
Linotti, whose specialty is jazz
and popular recordings, echoes
these sentiments. He has found
that even the masters of such
old-time popular labels as Bruns
wick, Gennett, Vocalion, Okeh
and many others have been de
stroyed by the companies which
took them over. For this reason
he combs dealer catalogs, haunts
rummage sales, and engages in
a never-ceasing prowl for col
lector's "jewels."
The library is hampered by
lack of funds with which to bid
on the open market for coveted
items.
It also is short on space. The
library bulges with cardboard
cartons of gifts which need to
be sorted and stored. "Two mar
velous collections have to be
held at arm's length, because we
literally have no room for
them," Colby reports.
