# Lederberg Lauds Advances But Sees Moral Questions
## 
### SUE NEIL 
The director of Stanford's
Kennedy Laboratories for Mol
ecular Medicine attempted "to
"quiet the unnecessary ex
tremes" of speculations and pre
dictions which have arisen as
a result of recent biological dis
coveries.
Professor Joshua Lederberg,
last evening's Century 21 speak

er, addressed an above-capacity
audience in the Tresidder large
lounge on "Human Implications
of Biological Discoveries."
He spoke of the recent devel
opments in heart trans 1 , lants
and of the so-called "creation of
life in a test tube" as holding
"great promise for the future
of mankind."
However, he also pointed out

that "profound questions" are
raised, such as "What is life?"
and "Who decides who shall
live?"
When questioned on the ethi
cal implications of heart trans
plants, he replied that, in situ
ations of duress, "individuals
have the right to do what they
wish with their own bodies," pro
vided they are completely in
formed on all factors involved.
To deal with the new moral
and ethical issues, Lederberg ad
vocates a national committee re
ceiving authority from Congress
and drawn from a broad cross
section of society. He empha
sized that a committee for such
a purpose should not be a po
litical one.
Lederberg called Dr. Arthur
Romberg's artificial duplication
of DNA "one of the astounding
intellectual achievements of the
century." Although this duplica
tion occurred in only one form
of bacteria, he sees it as "an
opening of the door" toward dup
lication of DNA in other orga
nisms.
However, he was careful to
point out that the process in
volved is actually replication, not
|creation. He compared Rom
berg's achievement to that of
a printing press running off cop
ies of Shakespeare's sonnets in
that it creates copies but does
not create the sonnets them
selves .
This replication, Lederberg
said, has definite possibilities in
the cure of genetic defects which
cause disease.
However, he answered an "un
equivocal no" to a question on
whether or not we will be able
to exchange specific and prede
termined elements of one gene
for those of another. "We might
even have peace in the world be
fore that," he said.
