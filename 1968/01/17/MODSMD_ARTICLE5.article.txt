# Publisher Backs War Effort, Hits' Pallid Non-Conservatism'
## 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
William A. Rusher, publisher
of the National Review, attri
buted the recent rise of conser
vatism in America to "the pal
lid non-conservatism of Eisen
hower" before 50 people in
Tresidder Union last night.
The assumption in the early
1950'5, Rusher said, was that the
election of a Republican to the
Presidency would be "a conser
vative development of great note
and import."
But by 1955, he said, it was
"obvious that the election of a
Republican President was not
going to do the trick."
In a speech sponsored by the
Young Americans for Freedom,
Busher also said that Richard
Nixon, having "sought with cali
pers and footrules the dead cen
ter of the Republican party", is
the probable GOP nominee.
Claiming the balance of poli
tical power has shifted from the
northeast to the South and West,
Rusher predicted that the lib
erals in the Republican party
will not regain their former
power "for some time to come."
The election of a Republican

to the Presidency "would not
mean a sudden cessation of hu
manitarian concern in America."
Rusher said. The anti-poverty
programs, he said, would not be
severely cut back though "I
would expect to see them modi
fied in various ways."
Rusher said that while the
use of drugs by many members
of the New Left could "produce
a certain number of compari
tively manageable warm bodies
to circle the Pentagon" in the
long run the use of drugs would
only weaken the movement.
Wants Quantum Escalation
Rusher said that his differ
ences with the President over
the conduct of the war in Viet
nam were "differences in detail
and not in general." He said he
favored "quantum escalation" of
the war and not the "increment
al" escalation of the current Ad
ministration.
When asked about the reason
for U.S. involvement in Viet
nam, Rusher replied that it was
"our interest that got us in
volved and not an effort to con
fer democracy on Vietnam or to
prevent them from having com
munism."

He explained that the war
was the "present manifestation
of aggessive communism" and
that in order to prevent World
War 111, the United States
"must stop it somewhere."
On the subject of possible
Russian or Chinese intervention,
Rusher asserted that neither
power would intervene because
of the "great risks" as well as
the logistics problems. Rusher
went on to say that "we are
making quite substantial mili
tary, political, and economic pro
gress in Vietnam." he did not
predict when we could start to
withdraw troops.
Sees Rockefeller Candidacy
Rusher predicted that Nelson
Rockefeller will formally enter
the Presidential race after
"Romney loses terribly in New
Hampshire." he said that Rocke
feller will "let the press chew
Rommey up for now."
He also remarked on what he
termed the irony of thestituation
that "36 years after the first
election of Franklin Roosevelt
the American people are going
to be offered the choice this
year of Lyndon Johnson, Rich
ard Nixon, or George Wallace."

power would intervene because
of the "great risks" as well as
the logistics problems. Rusher
went on to say that "we are
making quite substantial mili
tary, political, and economic pro
gress in Vietnam." he did not
predict when we could start to
withdraw troops.
Sees Rockefeller Candidacy
Rusher predicted that Nelson
Rockefeller will formally enter
the Presidential race after
"Romney loses terribly in New
Hampshire." he said that Rocke
feller will "let the press chew
Rommey up for now."
He also remarked on what he
termed the irony of thestituation
that "36 years after the first
election of Franklin Roosevelt
the American people are going
to be offered the choice this
year of Lyndon Johnson, Rich
ard Nixon, or George Wallace."
William A. Rusher, publisher
of the National Review, attri
buted the recent rise of conser
vatism in America to "the pal
lid non-conservatism of Eisen
hower" before 50 people in
Tresidder Union last night.
The assumption in the early
1950'5, Rusher said, was that the
election of a Republican to the
Presidency would be "a conser
vative development of great note
and import."
But by 1955, he said, it was
"obvious that the election of a
Republican President was not
going to do the trick."
In a speech sponsored by the
Young Americans for Freedom,
Busher also said that Richard
Nixon, having "sought with cali
pers and footrules the dead cen
ter of the Republican party", is
the probable GOP nominee.
Claiming the balance of poli
tical power has shifted from the
northeast to the South and West,
Rusher predicted that the lib
erals in the Republican party
will not regain their former
power "for some time to come."
The election of a Republican

to the Presidency "would not
mean a sudden cessation of hu
manitarian concern in America."
Rusher said. The anti-poverty
programs, he said, would not be
severely cut back though "I
would expect to see them modi
fied in various ways."
Rusher said that while the
use of drugs by many members
of the New Left could "produce
a certain number of compari
tively manageable warm bodies
to circle the Pentagon" in the
long run the use of drugs would
only weaken the movement.
Wants Quantum Escalation
Rusher said that his differ
ences with the President over
the conduct of the war in Viet
nam were "differences in detail
and not in general." He said he
favored "quantum escalation" of
the war and not the "increment
al" escalation of the current Ad
ministration.
When asked about the reason
for U.S. involvement in Viet
nam, Rusher replied that it was
"our interest that got us in
volved and not an effort to con
fer democracy on Vietnam or to
prevent them from having com
munism."

He explained that the war
was the "present manifestation
of aggessive communism" and
that in order to prevent World
War 111, the United States
"must stop it somewhere."
On the subject of possible
Russian or Chinese intervention,
Rusher asserted that neither
power would intervene because
of the "great risks" as well as
the logistics problems. Rusher
went on to say that "we are
making quite substantial mili
tary, political, and economic pro
gress in Vietnam." he did not
