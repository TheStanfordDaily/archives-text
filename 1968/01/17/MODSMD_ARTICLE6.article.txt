• Wilson Sets Plans
LONDON (AP) — Prime Min
ister Harold Wilson declared
Tuesday Britain will withdraw
its military forces east of Suez
by the end of 1971, scrap a bil
lion-dollar order to buy Ameri
can-made bombers and cut so
cial services spending — all in a
drive for national solvency.
Wilson outlined his program
before a tense House of Com
mons, saying he hoped to save
$720 million in the 1968-69 fiscal
year and $960 million in subse
quent years.
"Our purpose," Wilson said,
" is to make devaluation work."
The pound was devalued Nov. 18.
Included in the savings is a
speedup in reduction of the arm
ed forces, a phase-out of Bri
tain's last three aircraft carriers
after 1971, and suspension of
civil defense work. On the do
mestic front, cuts will be made
in education, housing and road
building.
• Japan Protest Set
SASEBO, Japan (AP) — Left
wing students and workers by
the thousands converged on this
southern Japanese port city
Tuesday to mount massive dem
onstrations against the visit of
the nuclear-powered U.S. air
craft carrier Enterprise. Rein

forced police made preparations
to prevent a bloody riot.
The Enterprise and the nu
clear-powcred frigate Truxton,
bound for Vietnam duty, made
their way toward Sasebo but the
time of their arrival was uncer
tain. Informed sources said the
Enterprise would visit Japan
even though it may be delayed a
day or two.
Masashi Ishibashi, chairman
of the Socialist party's execu
tive committee, said the Enter
prise was delaying her arrival
"because she is afraid of the
demonstrations opposing her
visit."
• Economy Picks Vp
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
nation's economy took its big
gest forward step in almost two
years during the last quarter of
1967, a factor almost certain to
be cited by the administration
in the reopened congressional
battle over higher taxes.
In announcing the advance,
the Commerce Department said
Tuesday inflation absorbed half
of the fourth quarter increase in
gross national product and more
than half of the rise for the en
tire year.
Higher taxes are designed
partly to dampen inflation. The
billion increase in GNP during
the fourth quarter of 1967 to a

record annual rate of $807.6 bil
lion.
• Viet Action Sporadic
Communist bushwhackers
struck at two U.S. supply con
voys in the central highlands
and a South Vietnamese infan
try company on a road-opening
mission near the coast below Da
Nang Monday. The allies hit
back hard in each case.
U.S. spokesmen said 37 Com
munists and three Americans
were killed in the highland
clashes, both in the 4th Infantry
Division's area of operations,
and 23 Americans were wound
ed. Damage to the convoys were
reported light.
A Special Forces camp west
of Dak To has received heavy
enemy mortar fire the past two
days, but was reported to
come through without easaul
ties.
• U.S. Aides Killed
GUATEMALA (AP) — The
U.S. naval attache and an Amer
ican Army colonel were ma
chine-gunned to death while

they were riding in a car near
Guatemalan air force head
quarters today. Two other
Americans were wounded.

Guatemalan congressman and
his bodyguard were slain by
machine-gunners.
The Army colonel was identi
fied as John Weber, command
er of the U.S. military advisory

• Newton Trial Later
OAKLAND (AP) — Arraign
ment of Black Panther Huey
Newton on charges of killing
one Oakland policeman and
wounding another was post
poned today until Jan. 26 when
his attorney challenged constitu
tionality of the grand jury which
indicted him.
His attorney, Charles Garry of
San Francisco, contended the
grand jury system was uncon
stitutional because, he asserted,
it excluded members of low eco
nomic status.
Newton, natty in a sharkskin

suit, gave the Black Panther
clenched-fist salute as he enter
ed and left the court of Superior
Judge Redmond Staats.
Outside the building, a crowd
of about 250 persons demon
strated quietly.
• State Food Tax Out
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov
ernor Reagan had a cheery word
for California families Tuesday
—he has rejected a suggestion
that the state sales tax be charg
ed on food purchases.
It was only last Wednesday
that the governor had said his
task force studying tax reform
had included a food tax among
various possibilities for reshap
ing the tax structure. Reagan
said then the idea deserved
serious consideration if it could,
in fact, be made to spread out
the tax burden even more
among all Californians.
Shortly after his news confer
ence, the Republican chief ex
ecutive boarded a chartered jet
plane for a trip that will take
him to Oklahoma, Washington,

D.C., Pennsylvania and New
York.
• Kasperak Gets Food
STANFORD (AP) — Doctors
said today that Mike Kasperak,
fourth recipient of a human
heart transplant, shows im
provement but remains on the
critical list because of possible
rejection of the new heart.
Kasperak, 54, is getting his
first food —sugar and water via
a tube in his throat. He has been
fed intravenously.
A morning bulletin said his
liver function has improved sig
nificantly, his kidney function is
near normal, and he is breath
ing for longer periods without
respirator aid.
The new heart function and
blood pressure remain good doc
tors said, and Kasperak is con
scious and responds to com
mands.
• Romney Wants Talks
KEENE, N.H. (AP) — Michi
gan Gov. George Romney said
today the United States should
use its influence to persuade
Saigon to enter peace talks with
the Communist National Libera
tion Front in Vietnam.

a legitimate government but "it

has to be reckoned with in any
settlement in Vietnam."

them to have discussions," Rom
ney said.
• L.A. Strikers Talk
LOS ANGELES (AP)—Nego
tiations between the Herald-Ex
aminer and nine unions, aimed
at ending a strike that began
Dec. 15, resumed today. It was
the first session since Jan. 8.
The two sides met with a fed
eral mediator in a downtown ho
tel.
The American Newspaper
Guild walked out seeking a
wage increase and other bene
fits, and other unions joined in,

state legislations banning im
portation of what it calls "pro
fessional strikebreakers" in
such disputes.
The guild seeks a wage in
crease to $200.80 over two years
from the present $174.40 week
ly.
• Students Charged
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Police waited today for nine
San Franncisco State College
students to surrender on
charges growing out of a win
dow smashing demonstration
that shut down the campus last
Dec. 6 and put President John
Summerskill's job on the line.
Summerskill swore out mis
demeanor warrants against 11
students and a dismissed faculty
member last week. Two of the
12 surrendered and another
was one of 58 persons arrested
last Friday night in a riotous
demonstration on Nob Hill when
Secretary of State Dean Rusk
was appearing in the Fairmont
Hotel.
Those accused held a rally on
the campus last week after
Summerskill signed warrants
charging disturbing the peace
and trespass. They called it an
all-night sit-in.
Meanwhile, nine Negro stu
dents were ordered to trial in
Municipal court Jan. 29 on
charges of conspiracy and as
sault in the invasion last Novem
ber of the campus newspaper
offices, The Gator. Suspension of
four of the nine led to the pro
test demonstration Dec. 6.

• Wall St. Summary
NEW YORK (AP)—After five
sessions of cross currents, the
stock market Tuesday finally
took a sharp, well-defined loss.
Trading was active.
Losses outnumbered gains and
the averages fell. It was the first
time in six sessions that these
two factors were in gear. On the
previous five sessions gains ex
ceeded losses each day but aver
ages declined.
The handiest explanation for
the market's uncertain and, fi
nally, bearish behavior was that
Wall Street was apprehensive
about what President Johnson
would say in his State of the
Union message and others to fol
low.
The Dow Jones industrial av
erage fell 5.60 with 877.14.
Volume was 12.34 million
shares compared with 12.75 mil
lion Monday.
Of 1,534 issues traded on the
New York Stock Exchange, 539
rose and 773 fell. New highs for
1967-68 totaled 72 and new lows
15.
