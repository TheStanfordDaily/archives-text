# Idealism, Progress
## 
### 
In his convocation address yesterday, Presi
dent Sterling emphasized that previous gener
ations have left a "legacy of unsolved problems
to each of us" and that we too shall leave such
a legacy to the next generation.
What seems to us more important, though, is
that the legacy of problems for the next gener
ation will be even the slightest bit smaller. We
have the confidence that this legacy will at least
consist of different problems.
Every generation is required to find solu
tions and evolve major changes in the social
structure so that society may continue to evolve.
Our parents' generation was left the national
poverty of the depression and was called upon
to raise the country to prosperity. This they have
done and leave for us the more advanced, if not
less acute problem, of finding values which di
rect us to distribute that prosperity to all the
peoples of the nation and the world.
This legacy we inherit from our parents is cer
tainly more advanced than the legacy they in
herited. This progress is a tribute to their ideal

ism and hard work. But will our idealism stand
the test of the problems we now face?
The way to encourage social development is
by encouraging a healthy idealism amongst stu
dents today, not by discouraging it. The students
with the far-out and disruptive ideas within our
present society may well be the prophets of what
is to come.
We do not expect to eliminate all the world's
problems. However, we do sincerely ask "why
equity among nations and amity between peo
ples is so hard to achieve." Maybe we won't
achieve the perfection we envision, but we must
confidently seek to bring our world and our hu
man race to this equity and amity.
In that effort we will certainly leave many
things undone, but we hopefully will have solved
some of the problems left us. We hope the next
generation will not curse us for the legacy they
inherit, but will be able to say our generation,
though it did not achieve complete equity and
amity, did aliviate many of the problems that
seemed most acute in 1968.
