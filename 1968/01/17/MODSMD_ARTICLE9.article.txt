## Peace And Freedom Position 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of the San Ma
teo County Peace and Freedom
Party I would like to comment
on Monday's editorial. To cri
ticize an anti-war Democrat
(RFK) for failing to endorse
McCarthy is reasonable; to in
clude the Peace and Freedom
Party in this criticism is inap
propriate for several reasons.
I will mention only a few.
The Peace and Freedom Party
is a political party under Cali
fornia election law and must
hold its own primary with its
own candidates. We are legally
prevented from nominating any
but registered Peace and Free
dom members.
Even if we could nominate
McCarthy, there is no doubt in
my mind after personal conver
sations with leaders in his cam
paign that they do not want the
help of the Peace and Freedom
Party and would be embarrassed
by it. McCarthy is running as a
loyal Democrat, and his backers
do not want the support of those
who are so disgusted with the
present administration that they
plan to bolt the Democratic
Party after the convention.
There is the possibility that
the McCarthy organization will
decide it needs Peace and Free
dom workers and will ask for
our support. At that point we
can begin to discuss a very im
portant issue. It is clear that we
will not have peace at home or
abroad until we have freedom.
Yet it is equally clear that the
McCarthy campaign will concern
itself principally with Vietnam,
and despite minority represen
tation on the steering commit
tee, the power of the campaign
remains in the hands of tho
white executive committee. If
the Peace Slate pledge of "Peace,
Progress, Equality" is to be
kept, their candidates must cam
paign on all these issues.
Although many of us have
reservations about the meaning
and depth of the McCarthy cam
paign, certain points should be
made.
Even though the local Demo
cratic leadership gave us no help
and one "liberal" spokesman for
the Palo Alto-Stanford Demo
cratic Club denounced us at an
open meeting as his worst ene
my, we will continue to stress
that the enemy of Peace and
Freedom is not McCarthy and
his supporters but the present
corporate • military - bureau
cratic elite in government.
Many Peace and Freedom
members will register Demo

cratic to work for McCarthy
realizing his deficiences, but
many plan to wait and see if his
campaign is meaningful or
simply an attempt to keep dis
sent within the Democratic
Party in order to mount a unitod
campaign to reelect Johnson af
ter the "good guys" lose at the
convention.

Editor, The Daily:
The crime against humanity
was (honest to God) served as
yesterday's Wilbur lunch. After
you have smelled, tasted (and
puked)., we trust that you will
have the compassion to help
right this gross injustice. With
sick sincerity,

Seeking 4 Sham Value 9
Editor, The Daily:
. . .Let me assure the editors
of The Stanford Daily and the
people of our community that
we in the Peace and Freedom
Party are earnestly trying to use
political and electroral processes
to accomplish our goals. . . .
We are dedicated to the con
struction of a meaningful poli
tical alternative — one that will
go beyond June or August or
November of this year, and one
that will not be focused on any
single issue or personality.
Our aim is to develop a viable
political movement at the grass
roots level which will be respon
sive to the needs of the people
in this and other nations. . . .
