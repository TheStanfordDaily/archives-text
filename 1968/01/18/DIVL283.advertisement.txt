Dear Mr. Galvin:
Thank you for your questions concerning the drug issue. We on the campus are indeed
aware that our parents' generation is concerned about this movement and to a large extent
does not understand it. This is a particularly difficult area for communication—since
each group's exposure to drugs is so different. In the following, however, I will attempt
to speak for college students in general, and not for hard-core drug users, who I feel
are a small minority.
Among college students is a concern about what we feel is the cautious approach of our
parents' generation to living and developing interpersonal relationships. Wealth,
position, and fame are less important to us as goals than the development of our human
potential for happiness and establishing real interpersonal relationships. Our generation's
affluence has allowed us this luxury.
Thus the student today who experiments with psychedelic drugs does not usually do so
for the sake of increased creativity or productivity—but for release from an "ego
dominated" outer world. It is indeed rebellion against the established order, but not
against people! For associated with the decision to experiment with marijuana or LSD is
a commitment of interest in other people and to the inner self. A student who has tried
a trip or two (again I emphasize that this does not include the habitual drug user) is
likely to be more compatible with people in his work than if he had steadfastly refused
to consider taking the risk. It is true, however, that such a student is then less likely
to get along with someone who righteously condemns the use of psychedelics without
any personal experience.
Experimentation with and exposure to stimulants and drugs such as marijuana and LSD
are indeed widespread. Probably two-thirds of my school's undergraduates have had the
opportunity to try marijuana and perhaps half this many or less the opportunity to try
LSD —thanks to the recent flurry of law-making.
However the real issue at stake, as far as the business world and the campus are
concerned, is that we feel that the burden is on our parents' generation to show us why
it is wrong to experiment. Marijuana has been shown to be virtually harmless and no
one has made a responsible evaluation of the physical effects of LSD-like drugs. We are
roundly condemned for using such stimulants, yet cigarettes are known to be harmful
and they enjoy an enormous popularity. We see many contradictions in "the system" and
we demand justification for criticisms made of us.
The net effect of the psychedelic drug movement on business will probably be a more
conscious evaluation of personal goals by those who have been involved in the
movement and hopefully an acceleration of the development of interest in humanitarian
projects by business.
Sincerely,
Ralph B. Kimball

Dear Mr. Galvin:
Thank you for your questions concerning the drug issue. We on the campus are indeed
aware that our parents' generation is concerned about this movement and to a large extent
does not understand it. This is a particularly difficult area for communication—since
each group's exposure to drugs is so different. In the following, however, I will attempt
to speak for college students in general, and not for hard-core drug users, who I feel
are a small minority.
Among college students is a concern about what we feel is the cautious approach of our
parents' generation to living and developing interpersonal relationships. Wealth,
position, and fame are less important to us as goals than the development of our human
potential for happiness and establishing real interpersonal relationships. Our generation's
affluence has allowed us this luxury.
Thus the student today who experiments with psychedelic drugs does not usually do so
for the sake of increased creativity or productivity—but for release from an "ego
dominated" outer world. It is indeed rebellion against the established order, but not
against people! For associated with the decision to experiment with marijuana or LSD is
a commitment of interest in other people and to the inner self. A student who has tried
a trip or two (again I emphasize that this does not include the habitual drug user) is
likely to be more compatible with people in his work than if he had steadfastly refused
to consider taking the risk. It is true, however, that such a student is then less likely
to get along with someone who righteously condemns the use of psychedelics without
any personal experience.
Experimentation with and exposure to stimulants and drugs such as marijuana and LSD
are indeed widespread. Probably two-thirds of my school's undergraduates have had the
opportunity to try marijuana and perhaps half this many or less the opportunity to try
LSD —thanks to the recent flurry of law-making.
However the real issue at stake, as far as the business world and the campus are
concerned, is that we feel that the burden is on our parents' generation to show us why
it is wrong to experiment. Marijuana has been shown to be virtually harmless and no
one has made a responsible evaluation of the physical effects of LSD-like drugs. We are
roundly condemned for using such stimulants, yet cigarettes are known to be harmful
and they enjoy an enormous popularity. We see many contradictions in "the system" and
we demand justification for criticisms made of us.
The net effect of the psychedelic drug movement on business will probably be a more
conscious evaluation of personal goals by those who have been involved in the
movement and hopefully an acceleration of the development of interest in humanitarian
projects by business.

Ralph B. Kimball
