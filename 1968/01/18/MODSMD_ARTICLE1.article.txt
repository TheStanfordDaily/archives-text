# Johnson Asks Tax Hike, To Sustain Peace Search
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson told the nation
Wednesday night it can expect
higher taxes, continued prog
ress, the most massive $186 bil
lion spending program in all
history, and continued explora
tions for peace.
There was a call for legisla
tion to "free our gold reserves"
without backing off from com
mitments to maintain the price
of gold at $35 an ounce.
Johnson also urged in his
State of the Union message, leg
islation aimed at private em
ployment of 500,000 hard core
unemployed in three years.
The President delivered his

message in person to a joint
Senate-House session, broadcast
nationally by television and ra
dio.
Building Campaign
He asked for the launching of
a 10-year campaign to build six
million housing units for low
and middle income families.
He urged steps to improve
what he called the shocking in
fant mortality rate in America.
In addition to prodding Con
gress to pass consumer legisla
tion still left over from the last
session, the chief executive sug
gested a major study of auto
mobile insurance, "new safe
guards to insure the quality of
fish and poultry, and the safety
of our community water sup
plies."
These and other proposals will
be covered in a budget for the
1969 fiscal year, which starts
July 1, that will be up $10.4
billion in spending over the cur
rent year.
Fight Inflation
Revenues will come within $8
billion of providing a balanced
budget, and that takes into ac
count the tax bill Johnson is in
sisting is vital to protect the
country against inflation.
There was no backing away

from the President's bid for a
10 per cent surtax on incomes
of individuals and corporations.
The budget figures are based
for the first time on a new uni
fied concept which includes $47
billion in spending from vast
trust funds. These are for such
things as Social Security, high
ways and medicare.
Johnson said the economic
outlook for this year, if the
country is vigilant, is one for
steady growth.
Yet Clouds
"True," he said, "there are
some clouds on the horizon.
Prices are rising. Interest rates
have passed the peak of 1966;
and if there is continued inac
tion on the tax bill, they will
climb higher.
"I want the nation to realize
that this failure to act will
sweep us into an accelerating
spiral of price increases; a
slump in home building; and a
continuing erosion of the Am
erican dollar.
"This would be a tragedy for
every American family. And I
predict that if it happens they
will all let us know about it."
Both at home and abroad,
Johnson said, the nation is chal
lenged. But he said it is the na
tional will and not its strength
that is being tried, its sense
of purpose and not it ability to
achieve a better America.
Meet The Challenges
He said that we have the
strength to meet every chal
lenge and he believes with an
abiding conviction that the
American people "have the will
to meet the trials these times
impose."
Among the trials, of course, is
the war in Vietnam. And John
son said there are marks of
progress.
Declaring that aggression nev
er will prevail and that Ameri
can patience and perseverence
will match U.S. power, the Pres
ident said: *
"But our goal is peace—and
peace at the earliest possible
moment."

As the core of U.S. policy at
this point, Johnson listed the
San Antonio foundation. This
was a reference to a speech he
made Sept. 29 in San Antonio,
Tex., in which he said bombings
would stop if talks would "take
place promptly and with reason
able hopes they would be pro
ductive."
U.S. Restraint
To that he then added that
this would carry an assumption
that the enemy would not take
advantage of the halt.
As he put it in his State of the
Union message, Johnson omit
ted the word "assume" and
said that "the other side must
not take advantage of our re
straint as they have in the past."
Right now, Johnson said, the
administration still is exploring
the meaning of a recent state
ment by Hanoi's foreign minis
ter that once the bombing stops
it will be possible for talks to
begin.
"If a basis for peace talks can
be established on the San An
tonio foundations—and it is my
hope and my prayer that they
can —we would consult with our
allies and with the other side,"
Johnson said, "to see if a com
plete cessation of hostilities—a
really true cease-fire—could be
made the first order of business.
I will report at the earliest pos
sible moment the results of our
explorations."
Johnson went to the Capitol to
deliver his message after a
round of White House confer
ences with Congressional lead
ers and his cabinet about its
content.

EX-STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT — Dave Harris addresses supporters and newsmen outside the
Oakland induction center yesterday after refusing to enter for induction into the Armed Forces.
There were more than 500 people present, many of them Stanford students. Harris tore up his In
duction notice amid cheers from the crowd.
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson told the nation
Wednesday night it can expect
higher taxes, continued prog
ress, the most massive $186 bil
lion spending program in all
history, and continued explora
tions for peace.
There was a call for legisla
tion to "free our gold reserves"
without backing off from com
mitments to maintain the price
of gold at $35 an ounce.
Johnson also urged in his
State of the Union message, leg
islation aimed at private em
ployment of 500,000 hard core
unemployed in three years.
The President delivered his

message in person to a joint
Senate-House session, broadcast
nationally by television and ra
dio.
Building Campaign
He asked for the launching of
a 10-year campaign to build six
million housing units for low
and middle income families.
He urged steps to improve
what he called the shocking in
fant mortality rate in America.
In addition to prodding Con
gress to pass consumer legisla
tion still left over from the last
session, the chief executive sug
gested a major study of auto
mobile insurance, "new safe
guards to insure the quality of
fish and poultry, and the safety
of our community water sup
plies."
These and other proposals will
be covered in a budget for the
1969 fiscal year, which starts
July 1, that will be up $10.4
billion in spending over the cur
rent year.
Fight Inflation
Revenues will come within $8
billion of providing a balanced
budget, and that takes into ac
count the tax bill Johnson is in
sisting is vital to protect the
country against inflation.
There was no backing away

from the President's bid for a
10 per cent surtax on incomes
of individuals and corporations.
The budget figures are based
for the first time on a new uni
fied concept which includes $47
billion in spending from vast
trust funds. These are for such
things as Social Security, high
ways and medicare.
Johnson said the economic
outlook for this year, if the
country is vigilant, is one for
steady growth.
Yet Clouds
"True," he said, "there are
some clouds on the horizon.
Prices are rising. Interest rates
have passed the peak of 1966;
and if there is continued inac
tion on the tax bill, they will
climb higher.
"I want the nation to realize
that this failure to act will
sweep us into an accelerating
spiral of price increases; a
slump in home building; and a
continuing erosion of the Am
erican dollar.
"This would be a tragedy for
every American family. And I
predict that if it happens they
will all let us know about it."
Both at home and abroad,
Johnson said, the nation is chal
lenged. But he said it is the na
tional will and not its strength
that is being tried, its sense
of purpose and not it ability to
achieve a better America.
Meet The Challenges
He said that we have the
strength to meet every chal
lenge and he believes with an
abiding conviction that the
American people "have the will
to meet the trials these times
impose."
Among the trials, of course, is
the war in Vietnam. And John
son said there are marks of
progress.
Declaring that aggression nev
er will prevail and that Ameri
can patience and perseverence
will match U.S. power, the Pres
ident said: *
"But our goal is peace—and
peace at the earliest possible
moment."

As the core of U.S. policy at
this point, Johnson listed the
San Antonio foundation. This
was a reference to a speech he
made Sept. 29 in San Antonio,
Tex., in which he said bombings
would stop if talks would "take
place promptly and with reason
able hopes they would be pro
ductive."
U.S. Restraint
To that he then added that
this would carry an assumption
that the enemy would not take
advantage of the halt.
As he put it in his State of the
Union message, Johnson omit
ted the word "assume" and
said that "the other side must
not take advantage of our re
straint as they have in the past."
Right now, Johnson said, the
administration still is exploring
the meaning of a recent state
ment by Hanoi's foreign minis
ter that once the bombing stops
it will be possible for talks to
begin.
"If a basis for peace talks can
be established on the San An
tonio foundations—and it is my
hope and my prayer that they
can —we would consult with our
allies and with the other side,"
Johnson said, "to see if a com
plete cessation of hostilities—a
really true cease-fire—could be
made the first order of business.
I will report at the earliest pos
sible moment the results of our
explorations."

hope and my prayer that they
can —we would consult with our
allies and with the other side,"
Johnson said, "to see if a com
plete cessation of hostilities—a
really true cease-fire—could be
made the first order of business.
I will report at the earliest pos
sible moment the results of our
explorations."
Johnson went to the Capitol to
deliver his message after a
round of White House confer
ences with Congressional lead
ers and his cabinet about its
content.


EX-STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT — Dave Harris addresses supporters and newsmen outside the
Oakland induction center yesterday after refusing to enter for induction into the Armed Forces.
There were more than 500 people present, many of them Stanford students. Harris tore up his In
duction notice amid cheers from the crowd.
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson told the nation
Wednesday night it can expect
higher taxes, continued prog
ress, the most massive $186 bil
lion spending program in all
history, and continued explora
tions for peace.
There was a call for legisla
tion to "free our gold reserves"
without backing off from com
mitments to maintain the price
of gold at $35 an ounce.
Johnson also urged in his
State of the Union message, leg
islation aimed at private em
ployment of 500,000 hard core
unemployed in three years.
The President delivered his

message in person to a joint
Senate-House session, broadcast
nationally by television and ra
dio.
Building Campaign
He asked for the launching of
a 10-year campaign to build six
million housing units for low
and middle income families.
He urged steps to improve
what he called the shocking in
fant mortality rate in America.
In addition to prodding Con
gress to pass consumer legisla
tion still left over from the last
session, the chief executive sug
gested a major study of auto
mobile insurance, "new safe
guards to insure the quality of
fish and poultry, and the safety
of our community water sup
plies."
These and other proposals will
be covered in a budget for the
1969 fiscal year, which starts
July 1, that will be up $10.4
billion in spending over the cur
rent year.
Fight Inflation
Revenues will come within $8
billion of providing a balanced
budget, and that takes into ac
count the tax bill Johnson is in
sisting is vital to protect the
country against inflation.
There was no backing away

from the President's bid for a
10 per cent surtax on incomes
of individuals and corporations.
The budget figures are based
for the first time on a new uni
fied concept which includes $47
billion in spending from vast
trust funds. These are for such
things as Social Security, high
ways and medicare.
Johnson said the economic
outlook for this year, if the
country is vigilant, is one for
steady growth.
Yet Clouds
"True," he said, "there are
some clouds on the horizon.
Prices are rising. Interest rates
have passed the peak of 1966;
and if there is continued inac
tion on the tax bill, they will
climb higher.
"I want the nation to realize
that this failure to act will
sweep us into an accelerating
spiral of price increases; a
slump in home building; and a
continuing erosion of the Am
erican dollar.
"This would be a tragedy for
every American family. And I
predict that if it happens they
will all let us know about it."
Both at home and abroad,
Johnson said, the nation is chal
lenged. But he said it is the na
tional will and not its strength
that is being tried, its sense
of purpose and not it ability to
achieve a better America.
Meet The Challenges
He said that we have the
strength to meet every chal
lenge and he believes with an
abiding conviction that the
American people "have the will
to meet the trials these times
impose."
Among the trials, of course, is
the war in Vietnam. And John
son said there are marks of
progress.
Declaring that aggression nev
er will prevail and that Ameri
can patience and perseverence
will match U.S. power, the Pres
ident said: *
"But our goal is peace—and
peace at the earliest possible
moment."

As the core of U.S. policy at
this point, Johnson listed the
San Antonio foundation. This
was a reference to a speech he
made Sept. 29 in San Antonio,
Tex., in which he said bombings
would stop if talks would "take
place promptly and with reason
able hopes they would be pro
ductive."
U.S. Restraint
To that he then added that
this would carry an assumption
that the enemy would not take
advantage of the halt.
As he put it in his State of the
Union message, Johnson omit
ted the word "assume" and
said that "the other side must
not take advantage of our re
straint as they have in the past."
Right now, Johnson said, the
administration still is exploring
the meaning of a recent state
ment by Hanoi's foreign minis
ter that once the bombing stops
it will be possible for talks to
begin.
"If a basis for peace talks can
be established on the San An
tonio foundations—and it is my
hope and my prayer that they
can —we would consult with our
allies and with the other side,"
Johnson said, "to see if a com
plete cessation of hostilities—a
