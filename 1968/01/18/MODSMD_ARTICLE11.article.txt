# Denial Of Authority In U.S.
## 
### Max Lerner 
The question that the draft re
sistance cases raise is intel
lectually perhaps the prime
question of our time: to what
extent does political authority
have a claim on the individual—
a moral as well as a power
claim?
The question is raised when
young men decide that they will
resist the draft and when older
men as a matter of conscience
urge them to resist. It is also
raised less sharply in the sit-ins
and the close-ins, where the au
thority being denied is a local
one. The draft resistance cases
come closer to the central issue
because the nerve they touch is
the war-recruiting nerve, which
no nation—however powerful—
can afford to have paralyzed.

To understand what is in
volved, one must cut below the
surface controversies of today
and make a brief foray into the
history of ideas. The problem
goes back, 500 years or so, to
the church-state struggle in Eu
rope, when the church denied
the final authority of the state
and claimed a separate but equal
moral territory which the state
could not violate. It was renewed
in the 19th century by historians
and political thinkers who would
not accept the idea that no au
thority can clash with that of
the state.
A young British thinker,

Harold Laski, gathered together
the strands of church and po
litical theory into the concept of
political "pluralism." Society, he
said, is many, not one. It con
tains not only the political com
munity—the state—but also the
corporation, the trade union, the
church, the university. The state
has its claim on the individual,
but so has each of the others.
Sovereignty is plural.

This furnished one base for
the theory of civil disobedience.
But while the French, British
and Germans were influenced by
it, the Americans have gone on
to other traditions. The strong
est and most glamorous prece
dent today is that of Thoreau,
whose thought was anarchistic,
denying authority to the state
over the individual as a matter
of principle. Thoreau went to
jail rather than pay taxes to a
state which he regarded as in
volved in immoral acts like the
Mexican war.
His great essay, "On the Duty
of Civil Disobedience," had a de
cisive influence on the thinking
of Tolstoy and Gandhi. Through
Gandhi's influence on a number
of early American civil rights
leaders, it came back again to
the United States and has been
part of the thought and tactics
of Martin Luther King's group.
It has influenced the black
power movement, and is now at

the core of civil disobedience of
the draft. A quiet man who lived
all his life at Concord has be
come the most important intel
lectual influence today in the
struggle against the authority of
the American state and is an un
matched force not only on the
university campuses but even in
the black ghettos among people
who may never have heard of
his name.

I have deep respect for a
thoroughgoing believer in civil
disobedience, even though I
don't go along with him. If he
really believes in it, he is pre
pared to suffer the consequences
of his acts, as Thoreau and Tol
stoy and Gandhi did. But for
those who want to use the tac
tics of civil disobedience, but
have not thought through what
it means for them and for the
society, I suggest three problems
that need to be explored:
One is whether a person who
takes a principled moral stand
in disobeying the law has a
moral right to appeal to the
same legal structure and the
same state to protect him. The
black power militant picks the
laws he wants to break and the
laws he invokes for safeguard
ing himself. The draft resister,
unless he is an out-and-out paci
fist, picks the war he will resist,
reserving the right to serve in
some other. In both Instances he

takes not a firm anarchistic po
sition, but a selective one. He is
willing to pay the price of his
actions, but by a check he can
cancel at will.

The second problem is about
what happens to the larger so
ciety when total permissiveness
reigns. Dr. Benjamin Spock, in
his earlier phase as a child
psychologist, plumped all out for
the permissive parent. In a later
phase he revised his view and
recognized the need for a frame
of limits within which freedom
can develop. But can a society
survive with total politiral and
legal permissiveness without a
similar frame of limits? Or does
the anarchic principle of picking
what you will or won't observe
among the laws—the principle
of selective denial of authority
—lead to an Intolerable vio
lence?
Finally, there is the question
of the vigilantism that may well
come from one section of the
population as a response to the
denial of authority by another.
It is shortsighted to think that
such a denial can be quarantined
within the circle of a favored
few, whether on the campuses or
among black power leaders. At
some point the infection will
spread, and then we may have
the rule of law replaced by the
law of the posse and the mob.
It is worth thinking through.
Tdeas do have consequences.
