Editor, the Daily:
Leßoi Jones once wrote
where, among other things (con
cerning Our life), "the middle
class black bourgeois intelli
gentsia was very probably the
worst thing that ever happened
to a Street Brother."
He was absolutely correct!
It goes even further, how
ever, another bit of Truth show

not a One of which here at this
school ever coming directly out
of a lifelong double-identitied
slumworld—said Compromisers,
unwittingly yet unerringly dilut
ing the blood of Righteous An
ger, maker of and for extended
Interrogation of wrongdoing,
have now gone so far as to tam
per with one possible vehicle for
social mobilisation in American
society.
This vehicle—the Black Stu
dent Union. Much-maligned and
oft-debated during its short but
temptestuous beginnings, this
group has passed through any
number of critical stages. Noth
ing seems to have been learned.
However painful, the living ex
perience was lost.
We are BLACK STUDENTS,
Yes. But even more, we are
ARTISTS. ARTISTS—in the
fullest sense of the word—striv
ing with our own ghetto-made
images and slum-indentured cul
tures to add/retraction is im
possible: all of this to a much
grander race than Our Own, or
that of (for brothers) The
White Man.
The Human Race, which will
never be owned up to, not by
Negative Chauvinists, is that
Race. The Human Race—which
has been for too long and too
many times, slandered.
What We have to say will not
be too lightly taken by our fel
low brothers and sisters on the
campus. It is painful, it hurts
(it should)—but it is true. In
tellectualism as a social ab
stract, devoid of the reality to
be found in Actualized Memory,
is only one more face in the
series of permutations that
writhing black Aberrated Social
Psyche undergoes in denying
life to its own condition.
It is long since overdue for a
complete reorinetation, (and per
haps, re-integration) of our
souls, "Since they Have None",
Into the Technocracy of the
White Man. Despair sits on
those slum streets because it
has no place to go to be buried
—which should be within the
coffin of Happiness/non-History.
The Changing Times have
ruled out all classic militant
types. These same Times have
all but ruled the possiblity of
having nothing more than non
identical intellectual stereo
types. Blacks on Stanford's
Farm —the condition is one You
cannot run away from. It must
be studied. It must be under
stood. But most of all, IT MUST
BE LIVED CONSTANTLY!
The Changing Times done left
you behind. Don't want to be

assimilated by neo-radicals any
more than we wish to be taken

• McCarthy Does JSot
Need That Energy
Editor, the Daily:
In an editorial last week the
Daily expressed solid support
for Senator Eugene McCarthy
and his campaign for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination.
It appears that Gene has let the
Daily down, and it is unfor
tunate, almost repulsive, that
the Daily now has attempted to
tell Senator McCarthy, who is,
I'm sure, an experienced poli
tician, how he should conduct
his own campaign.
Admittedly, Senator McCar
thy's campaign is unexciting.
Admittedly, the Senator is a sin
cere man. So sincere, in fact,
that in his address Monday in
Memorial Auditorium he con
fessed there were other political
leaders who advocated similar
ideas and could probably wage
a more enthusiastic campaign.
But such leaders, most probably
fearing they would split the
Democratic party, failed to
launch a campaign for the
Democratic nomination.
The Daily asked whether Mc-
Carthy deserves the support of
those who seek the end of the
Vietnam war. Well, maybe Mc-
Carthy's campaign is just what
the Senator reported through
Kirk Hanson, namely "an at
tempt to influence Lyndon John
son's foreign policy," not an all
out attempt to end the war. If
this is so, then McCarthy need

not conduct the "energetic"
campaign the Dally has sug
gested.

• Lederberg: Ethics
Not For Congress
Editor, the Dally:
In its front page coverage of
the 21st Century lecture series,
Wednesday's Daily mistakenly
reports:
"To deal with the new moral
and ethical issues (in biology
and medicine), Lederberg advo
cates a national committee re
ceiving authority from Con
gress and drawn from a broad
cross section of society. He em
phasizes that a committee for
such a purpose should not be a
political one."
This proposal actually was
made by Senator Walter F. Mon
dale, Minnesota Democrat—not
Dr. Lederberg. In his speech,
Dr. Lederberg said: "ethical and
moral guidelines just aren't the
business for a new creature of
Congress."
He indicated that Congress
and other legislative bodies
should be concerned with such
questions as 1) the legal rights
governing disposition* of living
human organs, 2) legal assur
ances that individual decisions
regarding transplants and other
advanced medical procedures
are free of duress, and 3) the
basic allocation of public re
sources for research in these
and competing fields.

• Lonely Hearts Band
Out In Right Field
Editor, The Dally:
The creator of the recording
"Lyndon Johnson's Lonely
Hearts Club Band" made a re
mark in a radio interview which
suggested to me the aptness of
the title with respect to foreign
policy. He said he used the title
because LBJ and the others he
questioned in the recording

(questions, for comic effect,
spliced Into excerpts from
speeches or interviews) ap
peared to him to be lonely hearts
out of touch with the rest of us.
By my definition the members
of the Lonely Hearts Band
would be those conservatives In
both political parties who still
employe the domino theory to
justify a military assault upon
monolithic communism. In my
opinion they are out of touch
with reality. The domino theory
has been discredited, and mono
lithic communism Is now gen
erally recognized to be non
existent. Yet witness recent per
formances of members of the
band.
President Eisenhower In his
televised appearance with Gen
eral Bradley reiterated his dedi
cation to the domino theory. Ac
cording to that theory, if com
munism is defeated in Vietnam
it will be prevented from spread
ing to Thailand, India, the Mid
dle East, Africa, and eventually
to the coast of Florida. The
foundation of the theory rests
upon monolithic communism as
the aggressor. It pays little heed
to indigenous conditions which
invite communist activity.
Secretary Rusk in his San
Francisco speech again com
pared resistance to the commu
nist aggressor to resistance to
Nazi Germany. The validity of
such a comparison depends,
among other things, upon the
acceptance of a monolithic com
munist structure—i.e., one con
trolled and directed from a sin
gle authority with power to
make and carry out its own
policy.
There is virtually no possibili
ty that a liberal such as Rocke
feller, Romney or Percy repre
senting the predominantly con
servative Republican party
could do anything other than
imitate President Johnson—pick
up the baton and direct the
Lonely Hearts Band in the same
dreary march that sounds ever
increasingly like a dirge.

• McCarthy Does JSot
Need That Energy
Editor, the Daily:
In an editorial last week the
Daily expressed solid support
for Senator Eugene McCarthy
and his campaign for the Demo
cratic presidential nomination.
It appears that Gene has let the
Daily down, and it is unfor
tunate, almost repulsive, that
the Daily now has attempted to
tell Senator McCarthy, who is,
I'm sure, an experienced poli
tician, how he should conduct
his own campaign.
Admittedly, Senator McCar
thy's campaign is unexciting.
Admittedly, the Senator is a sin
cere man. So sincere, in fact,
that in his address Monday in
Memorial Auditorium he con
fessed there were other political
leaders who advocated similar
ideas and could probably wage
a more enthusiastic campaign.
But such leaders, most probably
fearing they would split the
Democratic party, failed to
launch a campaign for the
Democratic nomination.
The Daily asked whether Mc-
Carthy deserves the support of
those who seek the end of the
Vietnam war. Well, maybe Mc-
Carthy's campaign is just what
the Senator reported through
Kirk Hanson, namely "an at
tempt to influence Lyndon John
son's foreign policy," not an all
out attempt to end the war. If
this is so, then McCarthy need

not conduct the "energetic"
campaign the Dally has sug
gested.
