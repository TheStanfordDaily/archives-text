# Letter Policy
## 
### 
Letters to the editor are glad
ly accepted and will be printed
as relevant. All letters become
the property of The Stanford
Dally and are subject to editing.
Any person submitting a letter
Indicates his trust that the main
point of the letter will not be
altered by editing. Hence letters
should be short and to the point.
Letters must be typed, double
spaced on a 65 space line. Other
wise they will not be considered.
