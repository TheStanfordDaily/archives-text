## Meet Domino Of The Theory 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON — One of the
most discussed political theories
of our time is the so-called "dom
ino theory" which the Adminis
tration uses to justify most of
the reasons why we are in Viet
nam. The domino theory is based
on the premise that countries in
Southeast Asia are like so many
dominoes, and if one falls, the
next one will fall until every
country out there is down and
taken over by godless commu
nism.
While there has been a great
deal of talk about the domino
theory, very little attention has
been paid to the man who ori
ginally thought it up, and I de
cided it was time somebody
talked to him.
His name, it turns out, is Sam
Domino and he lives in Forest
Hills, N.Y., where I found him
on a recent Sunday afternoon
playing gin rummy.
When I expressed surprise at
this, he explained, "Dominoes
bore me."
A Touchstone
"Mr. Domino, your domino
theory is the touchstone of our
American military and diplomat
ic thrust in Southeast Asia.
Could you explain how you
thought It up?"
"Well, one evening we were
having a buffet and there were
about 20 people lined up with
plates waiting for some chicken
cacciatore when my uncle, who
was first in line, slipped and fell
backward. He knocked over my
aunt standing in back of him
and she, in turn, knocked over
my cousin, who knocked over
my son and so on until all 20
people were on the floor. It sud
denly occurred to me that if this
could happen to people, it could
happen to countries."
"So what did you do?"
"I wrote a letter to John Fos
ter Dulles, who was then our
secretary of state."
"But who named it the domino
theory?"
"My wife. She said when she
read the letter, 'Sam, put your
name on it or they won't give
you any credit.' At first I was
reluctant to do so, but then I
figured I had nothing to lose so
I specifically said that if they
used any part of my letter,
they'd have to mention me as
the author of the theory.
New Approach
"Much to my surprise, Dulles
answered the letter. He said that
up until I had written, the State
Department had been fooling
around with brinkmanship,
which had been advocated by a
man named Brinkman, who lived
in Bethseda, Md. Dulles felt that
the domino theory was a new
approach to the cold war, and he
thanked me personally for bring
ing it to his attention."
"How did he know it would
work?"
"He lined up 20 State Depart
ment employes in the cafeteria,
and tried the same experiment.
When the first one in line fell

the others fell behind him. This
was proof enough as far as he
was concerned."
"And so the domino theory
was then practically applied to
the countries in Southeast
Asia?"
"Yup. From then through the
Kennedy and Johnson Adminis
trations our whole commitment
in that part of the world has
been based on my theory. If it
hadn't been for my wife, no one
would have ever heard of me."
"You must be very proud."

"I am, but I'm starting to get
a little worried."
"What is that?"
"The other night I had another
party and again my uncle was
first in line and again he fell,
but this time everyone was
braced for it and no one else
fell. It shot my domino theory
to hell."
"You'd better get off a letter
to Dean Rusk right away."
"My wife said I'd better forget
it. I've caused enough trouble
already."

my cousin, who knocked over
my son and so on until all 20
people were on the floor. It sud
denly occurred to me that if this
could happen to people, it could
happen to countries."
"So what did you do?"
"I wrote a letter to John Fos
ter Dulles, who was then our
secretary of state."
"But who named it the domino
theory?"
"My wife. She said when she
read the letter, 'Sam, put your
name on it or they won't give
you any credit.' At first I was
reluctant to do so, but then I
figured I had nothing to lose so
I specifically said that if they
used any part of my letter,
they'd have to mention me as
the author of the theory.
New Approach
"Much to my surprise, Dulles
answered the letter. He said that
up until I had written, the State
Department had been fooling
around with brinkmanship,
which had been advocated by a
man named Brinkman, who lived
in Bethseda, Md. Dulles felt that
the domino theory was a new
approach to the cold war, and he
thanked me personally for bring
ing it to his attention."
"How did he know it would
work?"
"He lined up 20 State Depart
ment employes in the cafeteria,
and tried the same experiment.
When the first one in line fell

the others fell behind him. This
was proof enough as far as he
was concerned."
"And so the domino theory
was then practically applied to
the countries in Southeast
Asia?"
"Yup. From then through the
Kennedy and Johnson Adminis
trations our whole commitment
in that part of the world has
been based on my theory. If it
hadn't been for my wife, no one
would have ever heard of me."
"You must be very proud."

"I am, but I'm starting to get
a little worried."
"What is that?"
"The other night I had another
party and again my uncle was
first in line and again he fell,
but this time everyone was
braced for it and no one else
fell. It shot my domino theory
to hell."
"You'd better get off a letter
to Dean Rusk right away."
"My wife said I'd better forget
it. I've caused enough trouble
already."
WASHINGTON — One of the
most discussed political theories
of our time is the so-called "dom
ino theory" which the Adminis
tration uses to justify most of
the reasons why we are in Viet
nam. The domino theory is based
on the premise that countries in
Southeast Asia are like so many
dominoes, and if one falls, the
next one will fall until every
country out there is down and
taken over by godless commu
nism.
While there has been a great
deal of talk about the domino
theory, very little attention has
been paid to the man who ori
ginally thought it up, and I de
cided it was time somebody
talked to him.
His name, it turns out, is Sam
Domino and he lives in Forest
Hills, N.Y., where I found him
on a recent Sunday afternoon
playing gin rummy.
When I expressed surprise at
this, he explained, "Dominoes
bore me."
A Touchstone
"Mr. Domino, your domino
theory is the touchstone of our
American military and diplomat
ic thrust in Southeast Asia.
Could you explain how you
thought It up?"
"Well, one evening we were
having a buffet and there were
about 20 people lined up with
plates waiting for some chicken
cacciatore when my uncle, who
was first in line, slipped and fell
backward. He knocked over my
aunt standing in back of him
and she, in turn, knocked over
my cousin, who knocked over
my son and so on until all 20
