# Threats To Rusk Limit Our Freedom
## 
### DENIS HAYES 
Dean Rusk recently refused
an invitation to speak at Stan
ford. There is reason to believe
this refusal was motivated by
a fear that his presence would
spark violent demonstrations.
And according to a Dally edi
torial of January 3, "the truth
is that violent demonstrations
might well have greeted Secre
tary Rusk on this visit."
A man apparently feared to
come to Stanford to express his
views. Although no plot of as
sault has as yet been uncovered,
the college president and the
student newspaper seem to
think such fears were reason
able. And to date no one has
seen fit to condemn this state
of affairs.
A Daily editorial on the sub
ject contended that Rusk's plati
tudes and his lack of candor
"would have been an insult to
the critical intelligence of the
Stanford community," and con
cluded "it is better that Rusk
stay home." This is ludicrous!
If, indeed, no one wanted to
hear Rusk speak, he should
never have been invited. But
once, invited, it is certainly not
"better" that he be frightened
away. Yet not a single letter to
the editor has taken up this
topic. No one, it would seem,
is concerned.
I'm concerned.
Marketplace Of Ideas
My immediate concern with
the Rusk Affair lies in my re
spect for the traditional view
of the university as an open
marketplace of ideas. What I
am saying is that certain be
havior is inappropriate in a
scholastic setting, and if the
concept of academic freedom is
to have any relevance to Stan
ford, such behavior cannot be
countenanced here.
It normally isn't counten
anced. If some vague threat
from the far right were to
disuade, say, Noman Thomas
from appearing on campus, the
outcry would (hopefully) be
immense! And it would be justi
fied.

But the Rusk affair seems to
have generated only silence.
This silence could have far
reaching effects on all splinter
radicals in the future. By threat
ening violence small groups of
any persuasion might now try
to intimidate any prospective
speaker whose views they op
pose. The logical end of such
a process would be a campus
fre of communists, fascists, pap
ists, and anti-vivisectionists.
But this is highly unlikely.
The most unfortunate thing
about the Rusk case is far more
'immediate: maybe someone
want*>d to hear him .speak.
Granted his trite, ill-reasoned,
repetitious remarks may have
irked some of the finely-honed
intellects we have floating
around here. Granted his 'dia
logue' has tended in th epast
to fit a formula. Granted his
candor may be subject to ques
tion. And granted his speech
would probably have contained
nothing new.
If some hard-nosed scholars
didn't want to be fed his plati
tudinous Pablum, they could
stay home. Of if they were to
feel compelled to confrontation,
they could don white arm bands
and ask him embarrassingly
acute questions. Or, perhaps
better yet they could carry nice,
witty, brightly-painted signs
back and forth for the Huntley-
Brinkley Report, thus convey
ing their message over 25 mil
lion boob-tubes.
There are perhaps people on
this campus who might have
learned something (about either
Vietnam or Rusk) from his
speech. There are certainly peo
ple on campus who could have
benefitted from exposure to a
set of well-formulated questions.
While not likely, it is remotely
possible that a peaceful confron
tation just might have benefici
ally affected Mr. Rusk himself.
And even if no one at all had
profited from the entire affair,
at least no one would have been
hurt and an open forum of oc
casional value would have been
preserved.

Marketplace Of Ideas
My immediate concern with
the Rusk Affair lies in my re
spect for the traditional view
of the university as an open
marketplace of ideas. What I
am saying is that certain be
havior is inappropriate in a
scholastic setting, and if the
concept of academic freedom is
to have any relevance to Stan
ford, such behavior cannot be
countenanced here.
It normally isn't counten
anced. If some vague threat
from the far right were to
disuade, say, Noman Thomas
from appearing on campus, the
outcry would (hopefully) be
immense! And it would be justi
fied.

But the Rusk affair seems to
have generated only silence.
This silence could have far
reaching effects on all splinter
radicals in the future. By threat
ening violence small groups of
any persuasion might now try
to intimidate any prospective
speaker whose views they op
pose. The logical end of such
a process would be a campus
fre of communists, fascists, pap
ists, and anti-vivisectionists.
But this is highly unlikely.
The most unfortunate thing
about the Rusk case is far more
'immediate: maybe someone
want*>d to hear him .speak.
Granted his trite, ill-reasoned,
repetitious remarks may have
irked some of the finely-honed
intellects we have floating
around here. Granted his 'dia
logue' has tended in th epast
to fit a formula. Granted his
candor may be subject to ques
tion. And granted his speech
would probably have contained
nothing new.
If some hard-nosed scholars
didn't want to be fed his plati
tudinous Pablum, they could
stay home. Of if they were to
feel compelled to confrontation,
they could don white arm bands
and ask him embarrassingly
acute questions. Or, perhaps
better yet they could carry nice,
witty, brightly-painted signs
back and forth for the Huntley-
Brinkley Report, thus convey
ing their message over 25 mil
lion boob-tubes.
There are perhaps people on
this campus who might have
learned something (about either
Vietnam or Rusk) from his
speech. There are certainly peo
ple on campus who could have
benefitted from exposure to a
set of well-formulated questions.
While not likely, it is remotely
possible that a peaceful confron
tation just might have benefici
ally affected Mr. Rusk himself.
And even if no one at all had
profited from the entire affair,
at least no one would have been
hurt and an open forum of oc
casional value would have been
preserved.
Dean Rusk recently refused
an invitation to speak at Stan
ford. There is reason to believe
this refusal was motivated by
a fear that his presence would
spark violent demonstrations.
And according to a Dally edi
torial of January 3, "the truth
is that violent demonstrations
might well have greeted Secre
tary Rusk on this visit."
A man apparently feared to
come to Stanford to express his
views. Although no plot of as
sault has as yet been uncovered,
the college president and the
student newspaper seem to
think such fears were reason
able. And to date no one has
seen fit to condemn this state
of affairs.
