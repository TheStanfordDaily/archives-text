# Y. A. Tittle Sues Area Go-Go Bar
## 
### 
A topless bar usually does a
brisk business because of the
unique entertainment it offers
its patrons.
But as tar as Y. A. Tittle,
former pro football quarterback,
is concerned, business at the
Hip Hugger bar in Sunnyvale
is too brisk.
Tittle and his partner, Palo
Altan Ray Handley (not the
former Stanford football player)
have filed a suit to calm the sit
uation by ejecting "voluptuous
women" from the premises.
They said other businessmen
in the building, which they own,
are "Puritans at heart" and ob
ject to both the activity and the
rock and roll music in the bar
because it hurts their businesses.
Two tenants refuse to pay their
rents until the bar maids go.
Tittle and Handley claim they
had an oral agreement with the
three men who lease and run
the Hip Hugger not to employ
topless waitresses. The Hip Hug
ger was for "dignified and order
ly" entertainment only.

The suit claims this agreement
was broken. In staid legal terms,
the owners charge the defen
dants have:
"Employed and engaged volup
tuous women, who, from the
waist up, are unclothed, unre
strained, unencumbered, unsup
ported, unashamed, unbosomed,
unbridled, and undaunted, and
have in the past and continue
to undulate in an unparalleled
and unobstructed fashion, their
overexposed, overdeveloped, and
overactive anatomy in an over
whelming display over the count
er of said establishment there
by overstepping the terms of
said agreement."
Unclear
It was not immediately clear
how the waitresses were both
"unbosomed" and "overdevelop
ed" at the same time.
But the owners concern over
unrestrained, unencumbered, and
unbridled bar maids on the loose
in the midst of Puritan tenants
was quickly understood.
