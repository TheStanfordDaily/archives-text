# Local McCarthy Group Formed, 200 Sign Up
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Senator Eugene McCarthy's
Mem Aud speech Monday set
off the drive of the Stanford
Committee for McCarthy to
gain local support for the Min
nesota Democrat's presidential
campaign
Almost 200 students and fac
ulty members have already ex
pressed an interest in working
for McCarthy, and the group is
looking for more people.
According to opinion ex
pressed at the steering commit
tee meeting Monday the group
will have four purposes.
The first aim is to provide
well-organized manpower for
other peninsula groups to use
in corralling votes. The second
goal is to gather contributions
to further both the Stanford
and the statewide effort.
Third the group would like to
get out voters at Stanford who
will support McCarthy's candi
dacy. Lastly the group would
like to help organize McCarthy
groups at Foothill Junior Col
lege and local high schools.

The group's officers are Jack
Porter, president; Jim Storey,
vice president: JefT Blum, treas
urer: and Chris Harte, secre
tary.
These students also head the
Stanford Young Democrats
(YD's); Porter explained that
the McCarthy committee is
merely an extension of the YD's.
Porter said that the commit
tee is affiliated with the Cali
fornia Democratic Council, a
study group which has declared
itself for McCarthy, as well as
the state YD organization.
The Stanford organization is
run by a steering committee
consisting of the group's of
ficers, plus Robert McAfee
Brown, professor of religion,
George Leppert, professor of
mechanical engineering, and
anyone who is in charge of a
specific function of the McCar
thy group.
Organizing Manpower
During the coming weeks, the
committee will spend its time
mainly organizing manpower
and establishing contact with
other local McCarthy groups.
The group is using a punch
card sorter and a computer
print-out system to sort the vol
unteers interested in working
for McCarthy by particular in
terest in his campaign and by
home address.
A variety of methods will be
used to gather money for the
Minnesota Senator's drive for
the nomination. A table for dis
tributing buttons, and bumper
stickers to contributors every
day outside of Tresidder.
The table will also be used
as a recruiting station.
Bumper Sticker Contributions
According to Lee Herzenberg,
a research assistant at the medi

cal school and a member of the
steering committee, the group
hopes to average a 50c contri
bution for each bumper sticker
distributed and 25c for each but
ton. The group pays 7c apiece
for the stickers.
Plans are also in the works
for a fund raising rally at White
Plaza in about two weeks with
"an interesting and important
speaker." The group also hopes
to hold a benefit dance on Val
entines Day with a major rock
group.
Assistant registrars are being
trained in order to register Cali
fornia residents who are likely
to vote for McCarthy.
Some of the registrars already
working for the committee are
Peace and Freedom Party mem
bers.
Lucio Ruotolo, the faculty
resident at Rineonada House
in Wilbur and one of the com
mittee's members in charge
of faculty contributions, said
that many faculty members
are reluctant to contribute to
the McCarthy campaign chest
because they are members of
the Peace and Freedom Party
and are waiting to see how
their party moves in respect
to McCarthy.
Another comment on the
Peace and Freedom Party was
made by committee member
Chris Harte: "The leadership of
the Peace and Freedom Party
seems to be geared now to giv
ing McCarthy trouble."
Harte, however, took pains to
distinguish between the Peace
and Freedom party's leaders
and its rank and file members,
remarking on the strong, sup
port given to the committee by
many Peace and Freedom mem
bers.
