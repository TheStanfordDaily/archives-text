## 
### 
America's first adult heart
transplant patient, Mike Kasper
ak, who also had his gall blad
der removed last Sunday, is re
ported improving slowly but
steadily at the Stanford Medi
cal Center.
Doctors stated that for the
first time since his gall bladder
operation, Kasperak sat in a
chair this morning with the help
of nurses. Despite this seeming
improvement in his condition,
Kasperak is still listed in criti
cal condition.

Kasperak's respiratory and
liver functions also showed prog
ress, although dialysis, a meth
od of aiding the kidney, is be
ing continued intermittently as
a precaution.
Tuesday, Kasperak was fed for
the first time on a diet consist
ing of sugar and water. He had
been on intravenous feeding.
Despite all other bodily prob
lems, Kasperak's heart continues
to function normally. There
have been no detectable signs
of rejection, according to the
doctor's report.
