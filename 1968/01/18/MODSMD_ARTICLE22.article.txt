# Ehrlich: Population Policy Should Be Campaign Issue
## 
### 
A Stanford population biolo
gist has called on fellow profes
sionals to "do everything pos
sible to make population policy a
major campaign issue" in the
1968 Presidential election.
Prof. Paul R. Eh rich told the
annual scientific meeting of
alumni of the University of Cali
fornia School of Dentistry that
"an estimated 3.5 million or so
will starve to death this year,
mostly children. But this is a
mere handful compared to the
numbers that will be starving in
a decade or so.
"It is now too late to take ac
tion to save most of these peo
pie," he continued. "But things
are not so tough in the good old
U.S.A. So the population explo
sion seems to be a problem of
the underdeveloped countries.
"Or is it?" he asked rhetorical
ly. "We live on the same planet
as these other people, and events
in their countries will inevitably
have drastic effects on the future

of the U.S.
"I support wholeheartedly the
thesis that much of the fate of
the world hinges on American
food and population policy. And
much of that policy in turn
hinges on our choice of president
this year.
"One could evr>n go <so far as
to argue that any candidate un
willing to make a strong stand
on this issue is at best unwill
ing to trust the American people
to see in what direction their best
interests lie. At the worst he
would be stupid or unpatriotic,
or both."
Prof. Ehrlich scorned the no
tion of "many patriotic Ameri
cans" who seem to fear that by
limiting the size of our popula
tion we will be at the mercy of
growing numbers of our ene
mies.
"Nothing, of course, could be
further from the truth,"he said.
"Our highly technological so
ciety does not need more human

beings to maintain economic
dominance or to wage war. We
fought the Second World War
with less than 150 million peo
ple, and Germany conquered
most of Europe with less than
half that number.
"In addition, more people will
weaken, not strengthen, the U.S.
Increasing population will only
add to our economic and social
woes, and lead to further erosion
of our freedoms.
"Russia recently realized that
overpopulation would weaken
her and is moving toward a pro
gram of population control. We
should be smart enough to do
the same.
"Politicians brag as Ameri
ca's population passes the 2DO
million mark," he added, "and
look forward to the time some
60 years from now when that
population will be 400 million.
They apparently do not under
stand even the most elementary
consequences of such growth."
