# Hasher Senses Mute Prejudice
## 
### 
Sophomore Robert O'Meally
has got another job.
But before he got it, he be
came involved in a series of
charges and counter-charges, and
he told The Daily that he feared
a muted form of racial discrimi
nation was present in at least
one branch of the University's
Food Service.
Food Service Director William
Myers denied O'Meally's charge
and said that there never had
been any cases of discrimination
in his department.
O'Meally, a Negro Beta Chi
who had worked a year and two
months in the Encina Food Ser
vice, said he was unable to get
on any flight to San Francisco
from his home in Washington,
D.C. to get back in time to work
as a hasher January 3.
Late Return
"I suppose I really should
have phoned the Food Service
people to tell them that I would
n't be able to be here till Friday
of reg week," O'Meally said, "but
I thought it would be all right
anyway."
But when he did come to En
cina Friday, Miss Geneva Con
nors, head of the Encina Food
Service, told him he was fired
lor failing to report Wednesday.
O'Meally then went to Mr.
Myers to complain. He said he
had been absent from his hash
ing job only once in the time he
had held it. Myers commiserated
with O'Meally but emphasized
to him that he had been late for
work without previous explana
tion.
Myers offered to get O'Meally
another job in some other branch
of the Service.

But O'Meally wanted to work
the hours he had worked at En
cina. Also he said he wanted to
be paid in cash and not in meals
as is the procedure in most other
Food Service branches.
Feeling slighted and "suspect
ing some sort of discrimination,"
O'Meally want to Myer's super
ior and to University Provost
Richard Lyman. But both said
they could do nothing about his
plight because they did not wish
to contradict the judgment of
their subordinates, according to
O'Meally.
'O'Meally then appealed to an
official of the Associated Stu
dents who talked with Myers
Tuesday and seemed to have
smoothed out the situation.
Inhuman Oppression
But O'Meally said, "I think the
hashers who have to work at
Encina are being held under a
form of oppression by Miss Con
nors. She treats everybody there
as if they weren't human, and
many of the regular workers are
members of minority groups."
Myers said, "Some of the kids
who work with her have said
they feel Miss Connors is not
too warm toward them, but she's
an efficient and businesslike per
son. I don't think they have
much to complain about."
Miss Connors gave O'Meally
a good recommendation. O'Meal
ly said he was in line for the job
of head hasher at Encina, but
Miss Connors has recently abol
ished the post
O'Meally is to report today
for work at the Faculty Club,
which Myers called "one of the
most sought after places to work
on campus."

Miss Connors gave O'Meally
a good recommendation. O'Meal
ly said he was in line for the job
of head hasher at Encina, but
Miss Connors has recently abol
ished the post
O'Meally is to report today
for work at the Faculty Club,
which Myers called "one of the
most sought after places to work
on campus."
Sophomore Robert O'Meally
has got another job.
But before he got it, he be
came involved in a series of
charges and counter-charges, and
he told The Daily that he feared
a muted form of racial discrimi
nation was present in at least
one branch of the University's
Food Service.
Food Service Director William
Myers denied O'Meally's charge
and said that there never had
been any cases of discrimination
in his department.
O'Meally, a Negro Beta Chi
who had worked a year and two
months in the Encina Food Ser
vice, said he was unable to get
on any flight to San Francisco
from his home in Washington,
D.C. to get back in time to work
as a hasher January 3.
Late Return
"I suppose I really should
have phoned the Food Service
people to tell them that I would
n't be able to be here till Friday
of reg week," O'Meally said, "but
I thought it would be all right
anyway."
But when he did come to En
cina Friday, Miss Geneva Con
nors, head of the Encina Food
Service, told him he was fired
lor failing to report Wednesday.
O'Meally then went to Mr.
Myers to complain. He said he
had been absent from his hash
ing job only once in the time he
had held it. Myers commiserated
with O'Meally but emphasized
to him that he had been late for
work without previous explana
tion.
Myers offered to get O'Meally
another job in some other branch
of the Service.

But O'Meally wanted to work
the hours he had worked at En
cina. Also he said he wanted to
be paid in cash and not in meals
as is the procedure in most other
Food Service branches.
Feeling slighted and "suspect
ing some sort of discrimination,"
O'Meally want to Myer's super
ior and to University Provost
Richard Lyman. But both said
they could do nothing about his
plight because they did not wish
to contradict the judgment of
their subordinates, according to
O'Meally.
'O'Meally then appealed to an
official of the Associated Stu
dents who talked with Myers
Tuesday and seemed to have
smoothed out the situation.
Inhuman Oppression
But O'Meally said, "I think the
hashers who have to work at
Encina are being held under a
form of oppression by Miss Con
nors. She treats everybody there
as if they weren't human, and
many of the regular workers are
members of minority groups."
Myers said, "Some of the kids
who work with her have said
they feel Miss Connors is not
too warm toward them, but she's
an efficient and businesslike per
son. I don't think they have
much to complain about."
