Staffer Gary Cavalll talked to
Basketball G'oach Howie Dall
mar yesterday. Here Is their
conversation.)
Q. Up to this point in the
season, has the team performed
in the way you anticipated, or
have you been surpised or dis
appointed?
A. I was really looking for
ward to this season. I knew we
had an exciting team, and fig
ured aggressiveness would make
up for our lack of a big man.
But rebounding Is evldentally
much more important. The
other teams are getting more
cheap shots. Besides that, they
have more confidence in putting
up their first shot, knowing
that they'll probably get the re
bound for another attempt.
Q. Whose performance have
you been pleased with this
year?
A. Well, Art Harris has
played really well for us —good,
consistent basketball. We de
pend on him an awful lot. Be
sides being our leading scorer,
he's our top rebounder. Gary
Petersmeyer and Mai McElwain
have also played well.
Q. Do you feel Don Griffin

has come out of his early season
slump?
A. I sure hope so.
Q. Were you disappointed
with the recent losses to UCLA
and USC?
A. Everyone knows UCLA
has great personnel, even with
out Alcindor. But our game isn't
a true test of how they'd do
without him, since we don't
have a big man. We played very
poorly in the first half, but we
still managed to stay close.
USC just bombed us. Hewitt's
a gTeat ballplayer, but the guy
that really killed us was Marsh.
He went wild. Harris had an
abcessed toth in both games,
and this hurt us. We had a
dentist standing by in case he
got hit.
Q. Taking Stanford's num
erous injuries into considera
tion, how much do you think
they've hurt the team's per
formance this year?
A. Well, you expect a few In
juries, but it's Just one of those
years when everything goes
wrong. The big loss was Palmer.
We knew we wouldn't have good
rebounding, but Palmer was
really coming along. Then there
was McEl wain's ankle; now

Harris' tooth and Petersmeyer's
arm.
Q. Considering the number of
men on the mend, do you think
the present layoff between lea
gue games will help? Or will
the players lose their sharp
ness?
A. The rest'll do us good.
We'll work on getting better. I

don't think there'll be any staJe
ness, since we have three prac
tice games. It'll give McElwain
a chance for some additional
treatment, and Petersmeyer a
few days off. He caught an
elbow up in Oregon a few weeks
ago, and the bruise Ls getting
worse. Now the arm is hemor
rhaging, so we'll be treating it.

McElwaln's ankle has been com
ing along, but It may have hurt
his rebounding last weekend...
Q. What will be your goals in
the remaining games this
season?
A. We're hoping to upset a
lot of teams.
Q. Do you anticipate having
the same type of problem next
yea that you are struggling
with now, that is, lack of height
and rebounding? Or do you feel
Palmer and Kuchenbecher will
progress enough to fill this
void?
A. We're hoping Palmer will

be all right next year. This year
the burden is on Kuchenbecher.
It makes him learn things the
liard way.
