## CCNY Power Changes? 
### 
Changes in administrative
structures at City College in
New York which would give the
faculty and students increased
powers have been recommended
by a special committee commis
sioned by the college's president,
Dr. Buell G. Gallagher.
Among the recommendations
was the creation of a faculty
and a student senate, both with
increased, and in some areas,
equal power in the day-to-day
running of the college and in
determining education policies,
budget matters and long range
planning.
The proposed faculty senate,
in conjunction with the student
senate, would advise Gallagher
on college affairs, and take a
hand in determining policy mat
ters such as the size of the fresh
man class, expansion of the col
lege, or the creation of service
agencies to help the nearby com
munity.

largest fund-raising drive in the
history of that university. The
goal set by President Kingman

the fact that Yale's endowment
is more than $500 million, the
second largest in the country,
