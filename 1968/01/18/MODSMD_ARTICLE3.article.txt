and make the same call that
they have.
"I call on every person in this
country registered with the
Selective Service to refuse to
cooperate any longer with that
mechanism and I call on every
young man who has not yet
registered to refuse to register
and I call on all those people
in the army to refuse the orders

of that system and I call on all
of our brothers around the
world to repudiate that thing
which is destroying them and
destroying the lives of people
around the world.
"I am very glad that after a
year and a half of waiting after
sending back my draft card I
finally got a chance to do this
thing," Harris continued.
Harris, affirming he was not
afraid of what "modern Ameri
ca" could do to him, said, "They
can't touch us." Asked about
the possibility of a jail term, he
said, "That's not touching us.
I've still got my mind, let them
do with my body what they
want.
"Myself and my brothers have
begun the joyous process of
tearing that building down, and
we don't intend to stop until that
is not there any more."
A spokesman for the Resis

may leave, but they won't be

Referring to the recent indict
ment of Dr. Benjamin Spock
and five others fo counseling

"They indicted six of our broth
ers in the east and I stand here
and make the same call that
they have.
"I call on every person in this
country registered with the
Selective Service to refuse to
cooperate any longer with that
mechanism and I call on every
young man who has not yet
registered to refuse to register
and I call on all those people
in the army to refuse the orders

of that system and I call on all
of our brothers around the
world to repudiate that thing
which is destroying them and
destroying the lives of people
around the world.
"I am very glad that after a
year and a half of waiting after
sending back my draft card I
finally got a chance to do this
thing," Harris continued.
Harris, affirming he was not
afraid of what "modern Ameri
ca" could do to him, said, "They
can't touch us." Asked about
the possibility of a jail term, he
said, "That's not touching us.
I've still got my mind, let them
do with my body what they
want.
"Myself and my brothers have
begun the joyous process of
tearing that building down, and
we don't intend to stop until that
is not there any more."
