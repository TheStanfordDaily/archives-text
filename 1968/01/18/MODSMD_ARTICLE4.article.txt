# Internal Strife Hits Black Student Union
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
Dissent within the member
ship of the Black Student Union
has caused seven black students
to declare they are "pulling out"
of the organization.
In a letter to the editor in to
day's Daily (p. 2), the group
terms other of the black st dents
"a mass of and
claim they have now gone o far
as to tamper with one p< sible
vehicle for social mobilisat iin
American society. This v icle

The letter was written by joh
nie Scott, a junior and occasion
al columnist for The Dally, for
himse'f and six others pulling
out of the BSU. Yesterday, how
ever, Scott noted that "pulling
out" is really a meaningless
term, for "in one sense, all black
students are members of the
BSU."
Besides Scott, the group in
cludes Joe Goone, LASSU mem
ber and recently appointed mem
ber of the Committee of 15.
The letter attacks "intell ctual
ism as a social abstract" and
Scott has implied that the basic

conflict has arisen between the
"thinkers" and the "revolution
ary thinkers." The dissenting
group desires a more active
stance by black students, who
otherwise succeed only in "deny
ing life to their own condition."
The dissenting group asserts
that not one of the other black
students has come "out of a life
long double - identitied slum
world." Th letter quotes Leßoe
Jones that "the middle-class
black bourgeois intelligentsia
was very probably the worst
thing that ever happened to a
Street Brother."
Scott said yesterday that
there was a hesitation on the
part of those withdrawing to
bring the dissent within the BSU
into the open. However, the
group decided the discussion
would be beneficial to the black
students.
Sincc its formation last spring,
the Black Student Union has
shunned publicity about its ac
tivities and has shown no signs
of disagreement and dissent. Un
til now Scott has ber>n an infor
mal spokesman for the BSU.
