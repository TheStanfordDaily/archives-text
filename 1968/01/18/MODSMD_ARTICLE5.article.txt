# ASUC Now Faces Uncertain Future
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
In another step in the con
tinuing confusion surrounding
the Associated Students of the
University of California (ASUC),
the Cal Judicial Committee met
late last night to decide on the
eligibility of suspended students
to serve on the ASUC Senate.
The controversy has been de
veloping for months, involving
such diverse issues as:
• Chancellor Roger Heyns' de
cision to strip the ASUC of its
power to allocate student fees;
• The ASUC declaring itself

independent of the "dminista
tion; and
• The eligibility of graduate
students to vote in ASUC elec
tions, and the question of wheth
er they really are ASUC mem
bers.
All of the items are interrelat
ed, however. The "declaration of
independence" was prompted by
the removal of the power to dis
tribute funds. This, in turn, had,
as its immediate cause, the
ASUC's allowal of graduate stu
dents to vote and run for office
in December. And some of those
graduate students elected were
on suspension.
Have Retained lawyer
Meanwhile, the state of the
ASUC is up in the air. Their
funds have been suspended, but
they have retained a lawyer and
plan legal action against the uni
versity.
The group's basis for the ac
tion is the fact that the ASUC
was initially instituted as a
body separate from the univer
sity administration. It originally
ran all athletics at the school,
hiring and firing the coaches.
When the teams started losing,
and the ASUC began losing mon
ey, it ceded this power to the
administration.
The ASUC still runs the book

store and the Student Union, or
at least it did before the recent
to-do. It hires separately from
the university, and its payment
system is different. For example,
ASUC employees make Social
Security payments, while those
who work for the university do
not.
Membership Onoe Voluntary
The history of the confusion
dates back to 1955. At that time,
membership in the ASUC was
voluntary. A poll was taken of
all students during registration,
giving them four choices:
• Paying for a Student Union
through compulsory member
ship in the ASUC;
• Paying for the building with
compulsory membership, but
making athletic cards voluntary;

• Paying for the Union
through some other method;
and
'• Not having the students pay
for the Union.
Over 60 percent of the under
graduates voted for one of the
first three choices, while only
51 percent of the graduates chose
one of them. The administration
eventualley decided on the sec
ond choice for all students.
In 1959, graduate students be
gan complaining about being
forced to belong to the ASUC.
Another poll was taken, again
with several choices. No alter
native received a majority, but
the first choice was a separate
association for graduate stu
dents.

Therefore, the administration
declared that graduate students
were no longer ASUC members.
This necessitated a change in
the ASUC constit"tion. An
amendment was passed that year
removing graduate students
from the organization. But only
undergraduates were allowed to
vote on it; the graduate stu
dents were constitutionally still
ASUC members, however.
Some complaints were made
about this, but nothing was done
until last year, when a graduate
student brought the matter be
fore the Judicial Committtee.
The committee ruled that be
cause of the exclusion of gradu
ate students from the 1959 vot
ing, their removal from the
ASUC was illegal.
The Judicial Committee also
ordered the Senate to provide a
means for graduate students to
vote. The difficulty with this was
a section of the constitution
which stated that only students
who had been paying fees re
quired by the ASUC could vote.
Administration Collected Fees
But the administration had
been collecting $1.50 from each
graduate student and giving it
to the ASUC. The registrar and
the catalog called this money
ASUC membership fees.
The administration disagreed.
The undergraduates had voted
on their fee, which is $4.25, but
the graduates' payment had
been set by the administration.
Money collected from the grad
uates was supposed to go for
the Daily Californian, the stu
dent newspaper, and payment
for the Student Union.
But, according to ASUC Sen
ate chairman Ken Stahl, this is
more than covered by the $1.50.
Therefore, the rest goes for ac
tivities, just as undergraduate
funds do, making no difference
between graduate and under
graduate payments, Stahl said.
Allowed Graduate Vote
So the ASUC went ahead and
allowed the graduate students to

vote and run for office. But some
of those elected were on sus
pension for their part in the
anti-Dow demonstrations.
It was after this that the
Chancellor decided to transfer
control of the student fees from
the ASUC to another body, the
Union Board.
This Board was to consist of
six students — the president
and vice-president of the ASUC
and four representatives chosen
by the Senate, and four students
—and nine people appointed by
the Chancellor.
The students have refused to
serve on the board, and the
group has yet to meet, waiting
for a settlement of the conflict
before getting together.
Hopes Are Dim
The hopes for this are dim.
Chancellor Heyns has said the
make-up of the Board is nego
tiable, but, according to Dally
Californian editor Karlyn Bark
er, he would not allow a student
majority or student chairman
ship.
Miss Barker feels that there
are other reasons behind Heyn's
action. "The Chancellor feels

that ASUC is too radical, too po
litical," she said.
His opposition to the ASUC
stems from such Senate actions
as providing bail-bond for anti
draft demonstrators, readjusting
the budget so that most of the
money goes to "tutorial" pro
grams rather than
groups," and coming out against
the Vietnam war, Barker stated.
Thus, the controversy con
tinues. Last night's meeting was
to determine the eligibility of
suspended students to hold of
fice. The ASUC contends this
legal, because of a provision in
their constitution which allows
any student eligible to register
the following quarter without
applying for readmission to be
a candidate.
This was originally meant to
allow students who wanted to
take one quarter off to still be
elected. But technically, this ap
plies to students on suspension
as well.
But no matter what the deci
sion on suspended students is,
many other questions hang over
the ASUC. And it may be a long
time before they are answered.
