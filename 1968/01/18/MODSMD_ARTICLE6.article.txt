# Buildings Displace Autos
## Parking Crisis Upsets Staff 
### H. RENTON ROLPH 
Alarm clocks are buzzing ear
lier. Eggs are frying faster. And
newspapers are read more
quickly these days, as members
of the University staff rush to
the ever earlier morning scram
ble for parking around the
Quad.
Department secretaries, ad
ministrative assistants, staff as
sociates, executive secretariesâ€”
all are bewailing a scarcity of
auto parking near their jobs. As
the University reroutes its road
ways, removes parking space
near construction, and replaces
it further from the Quad, staff
personnel must walk 15 minutes
from car to desk.
The embittered staff of the de
partment of aeronautics and as
tronautics voiced their dissatis
faction last month in a letter to
the University Traffic Commit
tee.

The letter read in part, "We
would like to congratulate you
on your ability to eliminate staff
parking spaces. There are prob
ably some who disagree with
your apparent policy, i.e., with
no parking spaces there will be
no traffic problems."
Space Grabbing
One of the letter's signers de
clared, "They even tried to take
away the space for the depart
ment truck. I don't think they
are very conscious of our prob
lems. How far out are we going
to be parking? This is a ques
tion I'd like an answer to."
One department secretary says
she sees "an inordinate amount
of reserved parking that re
mains empty throughout the
day. Faculty, many of whom
have two stickers, leave the
Quad during the day and leave
their reserved spaces vacant. We
walk."
But one girl was able to laugh

about her long morning walk.
"We bring sleeping bags to work
and stay for the whole week.
And when we do walk, we just
charge corn pads off to the de
partment. The situation is so
deplorable, its funny."
Much of the staff members
rancor seems justified, at the
present time, conceded Oscar
Nelson, Master Planner for the
University, who serves on the
Traffic Committee. But he ex
plained that the "University
physical plant is in transition
now."
"With more and more cars,
students, classrooms, lecture
halls and laboratories competing
for space in the inner core of
the University, something has to
give. What will it be? It has to
be the cars. We have to think
more about people than cars,"
Nelson declared.
Nelson maintained that the
University has been adding

parking each year, but, as the
perimeter expands, spaces are
necessarily further from Quad.
Last year Stanford gained a net
500 parking places, according to
Nelson.
Scenic And Efficient
Nelson pointed "out that the
traffic and parking rearrange
ment on campus will ultimately
result in a "scenic, efficient road
(Campus Drive) completely
around the campus." The pur
pose of this restructuring is to
eliminate a maximum number of
cars from the center of the Uni
versity, Nelson said.
He observed that people at
Stanford for the first time don't
mind the new system. "In the
past we have spoiled ourselves.
Now, as other large schools have
already done, we have to adjust.
The age of parking under your
window sill is over," he con
cluded.
