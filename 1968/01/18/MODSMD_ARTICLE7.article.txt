• Guatamalan Arrests
GUATEMALA (AP) —Police
made largo numbers of arrests
Wednesday in the hunt for the
assassins of two U.S. military
officers. But terrorists ma
chine-gunned a wealthy land
owner to death in a continuing
wave of violence.
The farmer, Alfonso Alejos
de la Cerda, 77, was cut down
in his car in a residential su
burb of the capital. His driver
was wounded.
The Americans were slain
Tuesday by machine-gun fire
from a speeding car.
A clandestine communique
signed by Rebel Armed Forces
—FAR—a Castroite group,
claimed it killed the two Am
ericans Tuesday because they
were associated with Guatema
lan army groups who "dedicated
themselves to sow terror and
death."
The police roundup was car
ried out under a decree of modi
fied martial law declared short
ly after the Americans were
killed. They were the first U.S.
victims of the wave of rightist
and leftist terror that has
claimed more than 1,000 lives in
the last year and a half.
• Tax Men Arrested
NEW YORK (AP)--Twenty
six present and former Internal

Revenue Service agents and an
accountant were arrested on
bribery charges Wednesday, as
the federal government stepped
up a four-year probe of corrup
tion in its New York tax offices.
U.S. Attorney Robert M. Mor
genthau said the 27 men had
paid a total of $10,000 in bribes
to an unnamed inspector, who
was an undercover agent.
Morgenthau said the bribers
tried to get the inspector to re
veal confidential information
about themselves, or to quash
inquiries into reported bribe at
tempts involving them.
'There will be a very inten
sive investigation of the tax re
turns these people were in
volved in auditing, and of the
accountants and taxpayers they
dealt with," Morgenthau said.
The arrests were the latest in
a four-year investigation that
previously had resulted in the
arrest of 65 IRS employes and
81 other persons, including law
yers, accountants, tax advisers,
and taxpayers.
• Britain To lip Taxes
LONDON (AP) — Chancellor
of the Exchequer Roy Jenkins
told Britons Wednesday runa
way wages and profits would be
taxed away by the government
lest they imperil the benefits of

Britain's devaluation of the
pound.
"The faster money incomes
increase, the harsher must be
the tax increases," Jenkins told
the House of Commons at the
start of a two-day debate on the
government's economy package
ushering a shift in Britain's
world role and its welfare state.
The theat of tax increases
followed the swing of the econo
my ax by Prime Minister Har
old Wilson. Jenkins said the two
must go together to keep the
economy in balance so it can
concentrate on exports. He
predicted harsh taxes in any
event, no matter how "unpopu
lar and unpleasant."
• End Seen In Viet Lull
SAIGON (AP) — Gen. Wil
liam C. Westmoreland said Wed
nesday a renewal of enemy acti
vity can be expected soon,
though the Communists "seem
to have temporarily run out of
steam."
The commander of U.S. forces
in Vietnam expressed belief in

an interview the next major
campaign will develop in the Ist
Corps area just below the demil
itarized zone, where increased
signs of enemy movement have
been detected lately.
U.S. bombers and Marine bat
talions form the major allied
shield there against a mass in
vasion from the north by the
35,000 or so Red regulars Hanoi
is estimated to have standing by.
The ground war was in one of
its periodic lulls after heavy
fighting over two weeks which,
while levying a relatively high
toll on allied units and material,
was reported to have cost the
Viet Cong and North Vietnamese
more than 5,000 dead.
• Japan Anti-V.S. Riot
SASEBO, Japan (AP) — Beat
en back trying to invade the
U.S. Navy base here, 800 leftist
Zengakuren students left Sasebo
by train Wednesday. They prom
ised to return for new demon
strations against the visit of
the American nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier Enterprise.
In Tokyo, about 8,000 Zengak

uron students demonstrated in a
park near the U.S. Embassy and
the residence of the prime min
ister. About 20 persons were in
jured when a clash broke out be
tween students and police near
the prime minister's home. Oth
ers staged a sit-in outside the
U.S. Embassy but were removed
by police.
Helmeted students, who ar
rived from Hakata after a three
hour train ride, used staves and
rocks in a pitched battle with
1,000 police who fought back
with fire hoses and tear gas.
• Quake's Aftermath
GIBELLINA, Sicily (AP) —
The scene is one of desolation
in this farm and vineyard coun
try town of 6,410 population on
the sulphur-bearing hills slop
ing up to Mt. Pergola after the
disastrous earthquake Monday
which laid waste to a triangle
shaped area of western Sicily.
Gibellina with probably 100
dead and nearby Montevago with
200 dead were the hardest hit.
Every building in both towns

was ruined when the tremors
struck between midnight and
dawn. *
Scores still are missing in both
towns, perhaps dead beneath the
rock and cinderblock wreckage
of their homes. But there still
was a thin threat of hope.
• Strike Talks Set
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—Ne
gotiations between the striking
Mailers Union and The San
Francisco Newspaper Printing
Co., will resume next Tuesday,
both sides announced today.
The company prints the San
Francisco Examiner and Chron
icle, the city's two major dailies,
which have been closed since
Jan. 5 as a result of the strike.
Representatives of the Oak
land Tribune and the San Jose
Mercury and 'News, which have
not been affected, also will at
tend the session, as will repre
sentatives of the International
Typographical Union, with which
the mailers are affiliated.
Spokesmen said the resump
tion of negotiations was not con
nected with an offer by San
Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto
to mediate.
• State Spending Same
SACRAMENTO (AP) - The
Reagan administration told Dem
ocratic legislators Wednesday to

abandon any hope that state
spending in the coming year can
be boosted substantially above
the current ecortomy level.
State Finance Director Gor
don P. Smith held special, sep
arate briefings for Republican
legislators and newsmen to ex
plain the state's current fiscal
picture. He said the aim was to
head off in advance any idea
that last year's $1 billion tax
raise will produce enough money
to allow spending above the nor
mal increases accounted for by
population growth.
Smith went on to say that
the Republican governor's sec
ond budget will be sent to the
legislature on Feb. 6, and will
not take the big jump it regu
larly did in the days of former
Democratic Gov. Edumund G.
Brown, when new programs
were usually introduced and cur
rent ones expanded.
The budget for the fiscal year
ending June 30 is $5.07 billion.
• Berkeley Integrates
BERKELEY (AP) — The Ber
keley Board of Education has
voted 5-0 to desegregate the
city's schools by busing some
3,650 Negro and Caucasian stu
dents out of their neighborhoods.
The action was taken Tuesday
nieht after three hours of nub
lie and board discussion before
an audience of about 1,000 per
sons at Berkeley Community
Theater.
Supt. Neil V. Sullivan said
Berkeley would "make history"
when the plan goes into effect
in September. He said Berkeley
will be the only city of more
than 100,000 population and a
significant proportion of Negroes
to have achieved total school in
tegration.
