# State Of The Union
## 
### 
President Johnson's State of the Union address
was the speech of a winner. It was well-directed
to the American electorate, the first major ad
dress in a campaign which seems to point more
and more to the reelection of Lyndon Johnson.
Yet in being these things, it was the most
devastating indictment of our nation that could
have been made. The President spoke of a "cer
tain restlessness, a questioning," noted growing
abundance, growing paychecks, humming fac
tories, more automobiles, homes and television
sets, and then asked "Why then this restless
ness?"
We will tell Mr. Johnson why all the restless
ness — because those Americans who do not
share in the prosperity want to know why they
don't, and other Americans who do are realizing
prosperity isn't the sole purpose of our nation.
It was the middle-class Negro, not just the poor
slumdweller, who rioted in Detroit. It is the af
fluent young who are demonstrating against
American policy in Vietnam.
With skill, Lydon Johnson avoided the biting
moral issues that plague the nation. He men
tioned nothing of racial injustice, but talked at
length about lawlessness.
He said more about the wholesome meat act
and hazardous radiation from television sets

than he did about the Vietnam war. Protect the
consumer, not the Vietnamese peasant or even
the American soldier.
It was a speech for a prosperous, fat-bellied na
tion. Johnson proclaimed "a truly new day for
the American consumer," and itemized a series
of legislation to guarantee for every American
"a fair deal in the market place." We could only
cry: Why? Why?
The President did talk of desperately needed
housing to break up the slums of our cities.
There were three other very concordant notes in
his speech: the prosecution of lawlessness is a
local, not a federal responsibility (hear that Gen
eral Hershey); marijuana was not specifically
mentioned as a dangerous drug to be controlled
as we try to halt "the sale of slavery to the
young;" and Johnson will push for a Save the
Redwoods act this term.
But beyond these rare high points the Presi
dent's speech was a mass of disorganized and
highly emotionalized rhetoric which avoided
the really difficult questions so that he might ap
pear the harbinger of good times and success.
He most certainly was not that last night.
While he may have spoken a language under
stood by most of the American electorate, he did
not speak ours.

It was a speech for a prosperous, fat-bellied na
tion. Johnson proclaimed "a truly new day for
the American consumer," and itemized a series
of legislation to guarantee for every American
"a fair deal in the market place." We could only
cry: Why? Why?
The President did talk of desperately needed
housing to break up the slums of our cities.
There were three other very concordant notes in
his speech: the prosecution of lawlessness is a
local, not a federal responsibility (hear that Gen
eral Hershey); marijuana was not specifically
mentioned as a dangerous drug to be controlled
as we try to halt "the sale of slavery to the
young;" and Johnson will push for a Save the
Redwoods act this term.
But beyond these rare high points the Presi
dent's speech was a mass of disorganized and
highly emotionalized rhetoric which avoided
the really difficult questions so that he might ap
pear the harbinger of good times and success.
He most certainly was not that last night.
While he may have spoken a language under
stood by most of the American electorate, he did
not speak ours.
President Johnson's State of the Union address
was the speech of a winner. It was well-directed
to the American electorate, the first major ad
dress in a campaign which seems to point more
and more to the reelection of Lyndon Johnson.
Yet in being these things, it was the most
devastating indictment of our nation that could
have been made. The President spoke of a "cer
tain restlessness, a questioning," noted growing
abundance, growing paychecks, humming fac
tories, more automobiles, homes and television
sets, and then asked "Why then this restless
ness?"
We will tell Mr. Johnson why all the restless
ness — because those Americans who do not
share in the prosperity want to know why they
don't, and other Americans who do are realizing
prosperity isn't the sole purpose of our nation.
It was the middle-class Negro, not just the poor
slumdweller, who rioted in Detroit. It is the af
fluent young who are demonstrating against
American policy in Vietnam.
With skill, Lydon Johnson avoided the biting
moral issues that plague the nation. He men
tioned nothing of racial injustice, but talked at
length about lawlessness.
He said more about the wholesome meat act
and hazardous radiation from television sets

than he did about the Vietnam war. Protect the
consumer, not the Vietnamese peasant or even
the American soldier.
