# ASSU ‘Doing Nothing,’ Cesare Tells Legislature
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
"The ASSU is doing nothing
for the students," the ASSU
president told the legislature
last night "1 really wonder if it
would be advisable to destroy
it."
With these words Cesare Mas
sarenti opened a report to the
legislature on his newly formed
executive committee.
The ASSU has no real power,
he asserted and "destroying"
the student government could
dramatize that lack of power.
Massarenti revealed that the
presidents of the student organi
zations of four professional
schools—law, business, medicine

and education — are discussing
cutting their ties to ASSU .
"And I can't really blame
them," he added.
Community Government
But short of destroying stu
dent government, his ten-mem
ber executive committee intends
to explore long- and short-run
methods of developing a com
munity government of students
and faculty.
Two executive committee mem
bers reported to the legislature
the progress of their discussions.
Stephen McMillan, who also
heads the ASSU study commit
tee, said the committee wants to
propose eventually an "ideal
constitution for community gov
ernment."
Specific I*roposals
David Brown pointed at some
more specific proposals now be
ing discussed, for example, cut
ting the legislature's size to a
more manageable 30 members,
and having it direct its activities
in four areas: academic, politi
cal, sports and cultural.
McMillan said current discus
sions on restructuring the legis
lature would bo his committee's
main concern for the next few
months.
The question of control of
ASSU funds arose early in the
session in connection with a pro
posed appropriation for salary
to hire an ASSU presidential sec
retary.
Some members were concerned

that the ultimate control over
ASSU finances rests with the
of students, not with the
students themselves. It was
pointed out the secrtaries now
working in the ASSU office are
employees of the dean of stu
dents rather than the ASSU.
Massarenti pointed out rela
tions are friendly between these
secretaries and ASSU officers,
but said the situation in any
case exemplified the true bal
ance of power in the University.
Massarenti also remarked on a
lack of "class consciousness"
among students. "I don't see
any . . . students seeing them
selves as second- or third-class
citizens," he said.
He stated some of his short
range goals as being to set up a
system of consumer protection
for students, a study of anti
student discrimination in local
off-campus housing, a co-op store
and a coffee shop.

Ho also dlscussod the student
board which will review the
work of the Study of Education
at Stanford.
In other business, the legisla
ture tabled a resolution to ask
Speaker Michael Weinstein to
request the dean of students to
turn over all control of ASSU
finances to students.
If the dean refused, the ques
tion would then be taken to the
Committee of 15.
Dates were set for the election
of ASSU vice president. Peti
tions must be turned in by Fri
day, Jan. 26. The election, to re
place Massarenti after he suc
ceeded Peter Lyman in the presi
dency, will be held Feb. 14 and
15.
The legislature approved an
$800 appropriation for KZSU to
buy two high-quality portable
tape recorders to use in its radio
news operation.

TRUSTEES MEET AT BOWMAN —The January meeting of Stanford's Board of Trustees ended yes
terday with it 2 p.m. conference at Bowman Alumni house on campus. Pictured are trustees (from
left) Ben C. Duniway, Charles E. Ducommun, William Hewlett, David Packard and Gardiner Symonds,
and University President Wallace Sterling talking with unidentified trustee shortly before the meet
ing. The Board discussed Stanford's ten-year financial plan, and heard a rei>ort from its committee
to select Sterling's successor. No statements were made public.
"The ASSU is doing nothing
for the students," the ASSU
president told the legislature
last night "1 really wonder if it
would be advisable to destroy
it."
With these words Cesare Mas
sarenti opened a report to the
legislature on his newly formed
executive committee.
The ASSU has no real power,
he asserted and "destroying"
the student government could
dramatize that lack of power.
Massarenti revealed that the
presidents of the student organi
zations of four professional
schools—law, business, medicine

and education — are discussing
cutting their ties to ASSU .
"And I can't really blame
them," he added.
Community Government
But short of destroying stu
dent government, his ten-mem
ber executive committee intends
to explore long- and short-run
methods of developing a com
munity government of students
and faculty.
Two executive committee mem
bers reported to the legislature
the progress of their discussions.
Stephen McMillan, who also
heads the ASSU study commit
tee, said the committee wants to
propose eventually an "ideal
constitution for community gov
ernment."
Specific I*roposals
David Brown pointed at some
more specific proposals now be
ing discussed, for example, cut
ting the legislature's size to a
more manageable 30 members,
and having it direct its activities
in four areas: academic, politi
cal, sports and cultural.
McMillan said current discus
sions on restructuring the legis
lature would bo his committee's
main concern for the next few
months.
The question of control of
ASSU funds arose early in the
session in connection with a pro
posed appropriation for salary
to hire an ASSU presidential sec
retary.
Some members were concerned

that the ultimate control over
ASSU finances rests with the
of students, not with the
students themselves. It was
pointed out the secrtaries now
working in the ASSU office are
employees of the dean of stu
dents rather than the ASSU.
Massarenti pointed out rela
tions are friendly between these
secretaries and ASSU officers,
but said the situation in any
case exemplified the true bal
ance of power in the University.
Massarenti also remarked on a
lack of "class consciousness"
among students. "I don't see
any . . . students seeing them
selves as second- or third-class
citizens," he said.
He stated some of his short
range goals as being to set up a
system of consumer protection
for students, a study of anti
student discrimination in local
off-campus housing, a co-op store
and a coffee shop.

Ho also dlscussod the student
board which will review the
work of the Study of Education
at Stanford.
In other business, the legisla
ture tabled a resolution to ask
Speaker Michael Weinstein to
request the dean of students to
turn over all control of ASSU
finances to students.
If the dean refused, the ques
tion would then be taken to the
Committee of 15.
Dates were set for the election
of ASSU vice president. Peti
tions must be turned in by Fri
day, Jan. 26. The election, to re
place Massarenti after he suc
ceeded Peter Lyman in the presi
dency, will be held Feb. 14 and
15.
The legislature approved an
$800 appropriation for KZSU to
buy two high-quality portable
tape recorders to use in its radio
news operation.
