## Do Not Applaud Death 
### 
Editor, the Daily:
Felix Greene's film made me
very sad Wednesday night, sad
that our perspectives become
so polarized that we lose a sense
of feeling for humanity.
The film itself was beautiful
in that it expressed this war we
talk about in something better
than words, people, and yet the
audience's reactions showed that
it was immediately translated
back into other terms. The
hawks were able to synthesize
the suffering they saw into "just
another crock of peace propa
ganda," the doves were so
moved by their political convic
tions that they applauded the
downing of an American plane.
Those big silver jets aren't really
inanimate mechanisms for des
truction, I had a friend who
flew one. He's dead now.
The Vietnam casualty figures
(ours or theirs) transcend the
arguments of both sides. Even
in war death does not deserve
applause.

• Hasher's Dismissal
Prejudice or Excuse?
Editor, the Daily:
Having been a hasher for
seven quarters at Encina Hall,
I consider myself qualified to
answer Bob O'Meally's charges
of racial discrimination on the
part of Miss Connor, director
at Encina.
At the time of his dismissal,
Mr. O'Meally claimed that he
had not known the exact day
on which he was to begin work.
In the first place, a notice was
posted above the time clock on
December 12th stating the day
that all hashers were expected
to begin work. Maybe Bob didn't
see the notice, but being a vet
eran of one year and two
months at Encina, he should
have known that Registration
day is always considered to be
the first day of work.
Bob knew he was late when
he went to see Miss Connor on
Friday, January 5, but instead
of explaining the extenuating
circumstances that prevented
him from arriving on Wednes
day, January 3—namely no
available transportation from
Washington, D.C.—and apoliz
ing for being late, he acted as
if he had arrived for work two
days early, instead of two days
late.
In answer to the charge that
Miss Connor abolished the head
hasher's job at lunch because
she knew that Bob O'Meally was
next in line for the job, it so
happens that there hasn't been
an official head hasher at lunch
since June, 1966, when Tom
Edison graduated, the last one
to hold the post—about the time
that Bob O'Meally was reading
over his certificate of accept
ance into Stanford.
It is well known that Miss
Connor treats her employees as

employees, and on a number of
different occasions, she men
tioned that Mr. O'Meally was
one of the best hashers at En
cina. In fact, during Autumn
quarter, she asked him to be
one of the six hashers to help
serve a luncheon for a business
conference held on a Saturday
morning. Knowing Miss Con
nor's feelings toward Bob as a
hasher, it irks me no end to see
him resort to the charge of
racial prejudice for lack of any
thing else to support his case.
It would have been a totally
different situation if he had ap
proached Miss Connor with an
attitude that reflected the fact
that he regretted being two days
late for work. But for Mr.
O'Meally to resort to, in effect,
calling Miss Connor a callous
bigot, is not only a poor excuse
for a lousy attitude, but unex
cusable as well.

With Closed Mind
Editor, The Daily:
Last Wednesday after dinner
we went down to the Wilbur
basement to hear the President's
State of the Union message, ex
pecting the usual dull Johnson
oratory. No Johnson lovers our
selves, we by no means agreed
with what he said. It was soon
evident that the others watching
were also critical of the Presi
dent.
Unfortunately, these people
didn't seem to care what Presi
dent Johnson had to say. The
TV audience thought it more im
portant to ridicule the President
for his gestures, facial expres
sions, and Southern slurs. Be
fore long, it became so noisy in
the room that we could not hear
the speech, and it is not likely
that anyone else could either.
However, we suppose it was un
important to them, since they
evidently didn't care to heaA
what he had to say, anyway.
We were saddened and disap
pointed that these people, sup
posedly among the brightest
scholars in the country, should
possess such a closed-minded,
unscholarly attitude. To say
nothing of the immaturity they
displayed in their degrading per
sonal ridicule.
This was not the first such
display of this kind of behavior.
It was a big thing last October
16 to watch the evening news to
see the exhibition of police bru
tality at the Resistance activi
ties in Oakland. It made us sick
to see such violent police action,
but how did the others feel?
They laughed. "What did we tell
you," they said, "there's police
brutality for you." This tends to
cast doubts on the strength of
their convictions.
It seems increasingly apparent
to us that many of today's
young people are close-minded
and unable to see beneath the
surface of today's controversial
Issues. We are concerned that
this attitude can exist here at
Stanford. We hope it does not
prevail.

• It's Sad But True-
Election Campaigns
Editor, The Dally:
You're right about Senator Mc-
Carthy having to escalate his

campaign if his candidacy is to
have the effect hoped for. But it
should be pointed out that his
apparent lack of luster is not so
much a commentary on him as
it is a reflection on the Ameri
can political system and the pe
culiarly crass form of politick
ing that is so much a part of it.
There should be plenty of dy
namism merely in the fact that a
man of McCarthy's stature and
eloquence is willing to sacrifice
his political security in a cour
ageous effort to restore the Viet
nam debate to the arena in
which it belongs.
In thinking of the type of
campaign which McCarthy is
chided for failing to conduct,
one cannot help but have night
mares of Richard Nixon's 1950
Senatorial bid, in which voters
were offered prizes (electric
clocks, coffee pots, toasters, etc.)
if they would answer the phone
and say, "Vote for Nixon."
Perhaps we should have elec
tions for car salesmen instead of
statesmen.

• Watch It McCarthy,
'New Left 9 Is Coming
Editor, The Daily:
Due to their lack of subtlety,
student leftists have made it im
possible for Johnson to begin to
disengage from Vietnam with
out polarizing American politics
and turning the conduct of the
war over to the Republican
right.
Now, McCarthy cannot speak
above a whisper for fear that
the "New Left" might descend
on his headquarters with draft
cards blazing. It is therefore hu
morous of student leftists to
censure the Senator for being
phlegmatic.

day, January 3—namely no
available transportation from
Washington, D.C.—and apoliz
ing for being late, he acted as
if he had arrived for work two
days early, instead of two days
late.
In answer to the charge that
Miss Connor abolished the head
hasher's job at lunch because
she knew that Bob O'Meally was
next in line for the job, it so
happens that there hasn't been
an official head hasher at lunch
since June, 1966, when Tom
Edison graduated, the last one
to hold the post—about the time
that Bob O'Meally was reading
over his certificate of accept
ance into Stanford.
It is well known that Miss
Connor treats her employees as

employees, and on a number of
different occasions, she men
tioned that Mr. O'Meally was
one of the best hashers at En
cina. In fact, during Autumn
quarter, she asked him to be
one of the six hashers to help
serve a luncheon for a business
conference held on a Saturday
morning. Knowing Miss Con
nor's feelings toward Bob as a
hasher, it irks me no end to see
him resort to the charge of
racial prejudice for lack of any
thing else to support his case.
It would have been a totally
different situation if he had ap
proached Miss Connor with an
attitude that reflected the fact
that he regretted being two days
late for work. But for Mr.
O'Meally to resort to, in effect,
calling Miss Connor a callous
bigot, is not only a poor excuse
for a lousy attitude, but unex
cusable as well.

Editor, The Daily:
Last Wednesday after dinner
we went down to the Wilbur
basement to hear the President's
State of the Union message, ex
pecting the usual dull Johnson
oratory. No Johnson lovers our
selves, we by no means agreed
with what he said. It was soon
evident that the others watching
were also critical of the Presi
dent.
Unfortunately, these people
didn't seem to care what Presi
dent Johnson had to say. The
TV audience thought it more im
portant to ridicule the President
for his gestures, facial expres
sions, and Southern slurs. Be
fore long, it became so noisy in
the room that we could not hear
the speech, and it is not likely
that anyone else could either.
However, we suppose it was un
important to them, since they
evidently didn't care to heaA
what he had to say, anyway.
We were saddened and disap
pointed that these people, sup
posedly among the brightest
scholars in the country, should
possess such a closed-minded,
unscholarly attitude. To say
nothing of the immaturity they
displayed in their degrading per
sonal ridicule.
This was not the first such
display of this kind of behavior.
It was a big thing last October
16 to watch the evening news to
see the exhibition of police bru
tality at the Resistance activi
ties in Oakland. It made us sick
to see such violent police action,
but how did the others feel?
They laughed. "What did we tell
you," they said, "there's police
brutality for you." This tends to
cast doubts on the strength of
their convictions.
It seems increasingly apparent
to us that many of today's
young people are close-minded
and unable to see beneath the
surface of today's controversial
Issues. We are concerned that
this attitude can exist here at
Stanford. We hope it does not
prevail.

Editor, The Dally:
You're right about Senator Mc-
Carthy having to escalate his

campaign if his candidacy is to
have the effect hoped for. But it
should be pointed out that his
apparent lack of luster is not so
much a commentary on him as
it is a reflection on the Ameri
can political system and the pe
culiarly crass form of politick
ing that is so much a part of it.
There should be plenty of dy
namism merely in the fact that a
man of McCarthy's stature and
eloquence is willing to sacrifice
his political security in a cour
ageous effort to restore the Viet
nam debate to the arena in
which it belongs.
In thinking of the type of
campaign which McCarthy is
chided for failing to conduct,
one cannot help but have night
mares of Richard Nixon's 1950
Senatorial bid, in which voters
were offered prizes (electric
clocks, coffee pots, toasters, etc.)
if they would answer the phone
and say, "Vote for Nixon."
Perhaps we should have elec

'New Left 9 Is Coming
Editor, The Daily:
Due to their lack of subtlety,
student leftists have made it im
possible for Johnson to begin to
disengage from Vietnam with
out polarizing American politics
and turning the conduct of the
war over to the Republican

Now, McCarthy cannot speak

Felix Greene's film made me
very sad Wednesday night, sad
that our perspectives become
so polarized that we lose a sense
of feeling for humanity.
The film itself was beautiful
in that it expressed this war we
talk about in something better
than words, people, and yet the
audience's reactions showed that
it was immediately translated
back into other terms. The
hawks were able to synthesize
the suffering they saw into "just
another crock of peace propa
ganda," the doves were so
moved by their political convic
tions that they applauded the
downing of an American plane.
Those big silver jets aren't really
inanimate mechanisms for des
truction, I had a friend who
flew one. He's dead now.
The Vietnam casualty figures
(ours or theirs) transcend the

Editor, The Dally:
You're right about Senator Mc-
Carthy having to escalate his

campaign if his candidacy is to
have the effect hoped for. But it
should be pointed out that his
apparent lack of luster is not so
much a commentary on him as
it is a reflection on the Ameri
can political system and the pe
culiarly crass form of politick
ing that is so much a part of it.
There should be plenty of dy
namism merely in the fact that a
man of McCarthy's stature and
eloquence is willing to sacrifice
his political security in a cour
ageous effort to restore the Viet
nam debate to the arena in
which it belongs.
In thinking of the type of
campaign which McCarthy is
chided for failing to conduct,
one cannot help but have night
mares of Richard Nixon's 1950
Senatorial bid, in which voters
were offered prizes (electric
clocks, coffee pots, toasters, etc.)
if they would answer the phone
and say, "Vote for Nixon."
Perhaps we should have elec
tions for car salesmen instead of

'New Left 9 Is Coming
Editor, The Daily:
Due to their lack of subtlety,
student leftists have made it im
possible for Johnson to begin to
disengage from Vietnam with
out polarizing American politics
and turning the conduct of the
war over to the Republican
right.
Now, McCarthy cannot speak
above a whisper for fear that
the "New Left" might descend
on his headquarters with draft
cards blazing. It is therefore hu
morous of student leftists to
censure the Senator for being

Felix Greene's film made me
very sad Wednesday night, sad
that our perspectives become
so polarized that we lose a sense
of feeling for humanity.
The film itself was beautiful
in that it expressed this war we
talk about in something better
than words, people, and yet the
audience's reactions showed that
it was immediately translated
back into other terms. The
hawks were able to synthesize
the suffering they saw into "just
another crock of peace propa
ganda," the doves were so
moved by their political convic
tions that they applauded the
downing of an American plane.
Those big silver jets aren't really
inanimate mechanisms for des
truction, I had a friend who
flew one. He's dead now.
The Vietnam casualty figures
(ours or theirs) transcend the
arguments of both sides. Even
in war death does not deserve

• Hasher's Dismissal
Prejudice or Excuse?
Editor, the Daily:
Having been a hasher for
seven quarters at Encina Hall,
I consider myself qualified to
answer Bob O'Meally's charges
of racial discrimination on the
part of Miss Connor, director
at Encina.
At the time of his dismissal,
Mr. O'Meally claimed that he
had not known the exact day
on which he was to begin work.
In the first place, a notice was
posted above the time clock on
December 12th stating the day
that all hashers were expected
to begin work. Maybe Bob didn't
see the notice, but being a vet
eran of one year and two
months at Encina, he should
have known that Registration
day is always considered to be
the first day of work.
Bob knew he was late when
he went to see Miss Connor on
Friday, January 5, but instead
of explaining the extenuating
circumstances that prevented
him from arriving on Wednes
day, January 3—namely no
available transportation from
Washington, D.C.—and apoliz
ing for being late, he acted as
if he had arrived for work two
days early, instead of two days
late.
In answer to the charge that
Miss Connor abolished the head
hasher's job at lunch because
she knew that Bob O'Meally was
next in line for the job, it so
happens that there hasn't been
an official head hasher at lunch
since June, 1966, when Tom
Edison graduated, the last one
to hold the post—about the time
that Bob O'Meally was reading
over his certificate of accept
ance into Stanford.
It is well known that Miss
Connor treats her employees as

employees, and on a number of
different occasions, she men
tioned that Mr. O'Meally was
one of the best hashers at En
cina. In fact, during Autumn
quarter, she asked him to be
one of the six hashers to help
serve a luncheon for a business
conference held on a Saturday
morning. Knowing Miss Con
nor's feelings toward Bob as a
hasher, it irks me no end to see
him resort to the charge of
racial prejudice for lack of any
thing else to support his case.
It would have been a totally
different situation if he had ap
proached Miss Connor with an
attitude that reflected the fact
that he regretted being two days
late for work. But for Mr.
O'Meally to resort to, in effect,
calling Miss Connor a callous
bigot, is not only a poor excuse
for a lousy attitude, but unex
cusable as well.

have the effect hoped for. But it
should be pointed out that his
apparent lack of luster is not so
much a commentary on him as
it is a reflection on the Ameri
can political system and the pe
culiarly crass form of politick
ing that is so much a part of it.
There should be plenty of dy
namism merely in the fact that a
man of McCarthy's stature and
eloquence is willing to sacrifice
his political security in a cour
ageous effort to restore the Viet
nam debate to the arena in
which it belongs.
In thinking of the type of
campaign which McCarthy is
chided for failing to conduct,
one cannot help but have night
mares of Richard Nixon's 1950
Senatorial bid, in which voters
were offered prizes (electric
clocks, coffee pots, toasters, etc.)
if they would answer the phone
and say, "Vote for Nixon."
Perhaps we should have elec
tions for car salesmen instead of
statesmen.

• Watch It McCarthy,
'New Left 9 Is Coming
Editor, The Daily:
Due to their lack of subtlety,
student leftists have made it im
possible for Johnson to begin to
disengage from Vietnam with
out polarizing American politics
and turning the conduct of the
war over to the Republican
right.
Now, McCarthy cannot speak
above a whisper for fear that
the "New Left" might descend
on his headquarters with draft
cards blazing. It is therefore hu
morous of student leftists to
censure the Senator for being
phlegmatic.

Editor, the Daily:
Felix Greene's film made me
very sad Wednesday night, sad
that our perspectives become
so polarized that we lose a sense
of feeling for humanity.
The film itself was beautiful
in that it expressed this war we
talk about in something better
than words, people, and yet the
audience's reactions showed that
it was immediately translated
back into other terms. The
hawks were able to synthesize
the suffering they saw into "just
another crock of peace propa
ganda," the doves were so
moved by their political convic
tions that they applauded the
downing of an American plane.
Those big silver jets aren't really
inanimate mechanisms for des
truction, I had a friend who
flew one. He's dead now.
The Vietnam casualty figures
(ours or theirs) transcend the
arguments of both sides. Even
in war death does not deserve
applause.

• Hasher's Dismissal
Prejudice or Excuse?
Editor, the Daily:
Having been a hasher for
seven quarters at Encina Hall,
I consider myself qualified to
answer Bob O'Meally's charges
of racial discrimination on the
part of Miss Connor, director
at Encina.
At the time of his dismissal,
Mr. O'Meally claimed that he
had not known the exact day
on which he was to begin work.
In the first place, a notice was
posted above the time clock on
December 12th stating the day
that all hashers were expected
to begin work. Maybe Bob didn't
see the notice, but being a vet
eran of one year and two
months at Encina, he should
have known that Registration
day is always considered to be
the first day of work.
Bob knew he was late when
he went to see Miss Connor on
Friday, January 5, but instead
of explaining the extenuating
circumstances that prevented
him from arriving on Wednes
day, January 3—namely no
available transportation from
Washington, D.C.—and apoliz
ing for being late, he acted as
if he had arrived for work two
days early, instead of two days
late.
In answer to the charge that
Miss Connor abolished the head
hasher's job at lunch because
she knew that Bob O'Meally was
next in line for the job, it so
happens that there hasn't been
an official head hasher at lunch
since June, 1966, when Tom
Edison graduated, the last one
to hold the post—about the time
that Bob O'Meally was reading
over his certificate of accept
ance into Stanford.
It is well known that Miss
Connor treats her employees as

employees, and on a number of
different occasions, she men
tioned that Mr. O'Meally was
one of the best hashers at En
cina. In fact, during Autumn
quarter, she asked him to be
one of the six hashers to help
serve a luncheon for a business
conference held on a Saturday
morning. Knowing Miss Con
nor's feelings toward Bob as a
hasher, it irks me no end to see
him resort to the charge of
racial prejudice for lack of any
thing else to support his case.
It would have been a totally
different situation if he had ap
proached Miss Connor with an
attitude that reflected the fact
that he regretted being two days
late for work. But for Mr.
O'Meally to resort to, in effect,
calling Miss Connor a callous
bigot, is not only a poor excuse
for a lousy attitude, but unex
cusable as well.

With Closed Mind
Editor, The Daily:
Last Wednesday after dinner
we went down to the Wilbur
basement to hear the President's
State of the Union message, ex
pecting the usual dull Johnson
oratory. No Johnson lovers our
selves, we by no means agreed
with what he said. It was soon
evident that the others watching
were also critical of the Presi
dent.
Unfortunately, these people
didn't seem to care what Presi
dent Johnson had to say. The
TV audience thought it more im
portant to ridicule the President
for his gestures, facial expres
sions, and Southern slurs. Be
fore long, it became so noisy in
the room that we could not hear
the speech, and it is not likely
that anyone else could either.
However, we suppose it was un
important to them, since they
evidently didn't care to heaA
what he had to say, anyway.
We were saddened and disap
pointed that these people, sup
posedly among the brightest
scholars in the country, should
possess such a closed-minded,
unscholarly attitude. To say
nothing of the immaturity they
displayed in their degrading per
sonal ridicule.
This was not the first such
display of this kind of behavior.
It was a big thing last October
16 to watch the evening news to
see the exhibition of police bru
tality at the Resistance activi
ties in Oakland. It made us sick
to see such violent police action,
but how did the others feel?
They laughed. "What did we tell
you," they said, "there's police
brutality for you." This tends to
cast doubts on the strength of
their convictions.
It seems increasingly apparent
to us that many of today's
young people are close-minded
and unable to see beneath the
surface of today's controversial
Issues. We are concerned that
this attitude can exist here at
Stanford. We hope it does not
prevail.
