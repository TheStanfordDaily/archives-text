# Two Minutes of Haight
## On The State Of Everything 
### Tim Haight 
"All about them, most Ameri
can families can see the evidence
of growing abundance. Higher
pay checks, humming factories,
new cars moving down new high
ways. More and more families
own their own homes, equipped
with more than 70 million tele
vision sets . . .
""Why, then, this restless
ness?" —President Johnson
"Progress is our most import
ant product" —Ronald Reagan
Products are our most import
ant progress. I mean, how else
do you measure progress?
What's bugging you?" "We
never thought of ourselves,
never a thought for ourselves.
We gave her everything money
could buy."
Abundance for What? "I don't
care so much for money. Money
can't buy me love." Take Alka-
Seltzer and get rid of the blahs.
Beware of the blahs. This scien
tist has just drunk onion juice.
Now he blows into this cylinder.
See, the needle goes into the dan
ger zone. Me, no, I'm not the
Green Phantom.
The Green Phantom of Felix
Greene's opera in the perfect
image signed by Ivy Baker
Priest. In god we trust. But
keep your powder dry. Don't
cry. No more tears with John
sons' baby shampoo. Baby, baby
. . . Where did our love go?
"She's leaving home after liv
ing alone for so many years."
Freedom from. Freedom to?
The Sane Society? The Art of
Loving? "Oh God, am I here all
alone? You know something's
happening . . ." "Do you need
anybody?" "Your mother should
know."
"Somebody spoke and I went
into a dream." Interpret reality
symbolically. Pretend it's all a
dream. Why can we only see
symbols in our dreams? They

are all around. It is all some
body's dream. Ask Bishop
Berkeley. "My needs are such,
I pretend too much."
"Pretending that you're still
around." God is dead. "Ding,
dong, the witch is dead, which
ol' witch the wicked witch."
Which witch? Which God? "A
mighty fortress is our God."
"Something there is that does
n't love a wall, that wants it
down."
Come down. Back down the
rabbit hole. But "up is a nice
place to be." "Turn off your
mind relax and float down
straight." Straight? "They're
coming to take me away, ha
ha." "The wonderful Magical
Mystery Tour is coming to take
you away." "I beg the Lord my
soul to take."
"Last night I dreamed I was
a butterfly. . ." "Last night I
had the strangest dream. . ."
"At dawn my lover comes to me
to tell me of her dreams . . ."
"Last night I went to sleep in
Detroit City, and I dreamed
about the cotton fields back
home. . ."
"Dream-lover, where are
you?" "I need somebody to
love." "You can be in my dream
if I can be in yours." "The
theological implications alone
are staggering." "Here in my
deep purple dream." The deep
blue sea. Silent World. World
without sun. Come Sweet Death.
"Sweet dreams?"
Tell us, Marshall McLuhan,
are dreams hot or cold? Are
they tactile? Did Freud try to
shove them into print? Always
rushing to print these scholars.
"Once more into the breach my
lads." "Into the valley of Death
rode the five hundred." "Yea,
though I walk in the valley of
the shadow of death. . ." Walk
ing in the Shadow, Shadow in

the Valley, Valley of the Jolly
(Ho ho ho) Green Giant. The
Jolly Green Giants. Ho ho ho
Phantom.
In Vietnam they call the Mar
ines the Jolly Green Giants. The
Jolly Grene Giants. Ho ho ho
Chi Minh. Good things from the
It Drang valley. Body count
figures. The Shadow knows. Me
and my shadow, strolling down
the avenue. "After living alone
for so many years." "All the
lonely people."
How green was my valley?
Long green. Keep California
green. The grass is always
greener. The grass is gold. The
gold standard. The stone stan
dard. The Stone Age. The grass
age. Let ye who be without sin
throw the first grass. "Suffer
little children to come unto
me." Suffering little children.
Suffering succotash. Succotash.
Good things from the valley.
"When I'm feeling sad. . . I sim
ply remember my favorite
things."
The Thing. Beware the Thing.
The Blob. The blahs. The Cul
ture Mass. Not High Mass,
though perhaps high noon, but
don't get caught high. "Up, up.
and away. . Escape velocity.
Escape from. Escape to. . . .
"they're coming to take me
away." "Look away, look away
Dixie Land." Look away. Let
the Vietnamese torture the pris
oners. How green was my Viet
nam.
"Are you driving that shiny
new car or is it driving you?"
Mustang Sally. Feel like a
healthy animal. Feel like a Mus
tang. Buy a new car. "Things
are in the saddle and ride man."
Beware the Thing. It won't let
them take you away. So to ans
wer that Question, Mr. John
son. . . .
