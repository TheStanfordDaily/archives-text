# Some Legal Justifications For Civil Disobedience
## 
### TERRY BARNETT 
Max Lerner's column in yes
terday's Daily began with what
"is intellectually perhaps the
prime question of our time: to
what extent does political au
thority have a claim on the in
dividual—a moral as well as a
political claim?"
Lerner cites Thoreau as the
source and example of civil dis
obedience, first calling Thoreau
anarchistic and later directly
stating that civil disobedience is

anarchy. From this belief Lerner
proposes three possible conse
quences of civil disobedience.
Linking anarchy and civil dis
obedience suggests that civil dis
obedience denies law both in ar
ticle and in principle.
Since the law is Lerner's
frame of reference I'll confine
myself to legal arguments in
considering another side of the
problems he indicates.
Two Reasons To Disobey
Lerner's first question is
"whether a person who takes a
principled moral stand in dis
obeying the law has a moral
right to appeal to the same legal
structure and the same state to
protect him."
There are two practical legal
istic reasons for committing
civil disobedience.
The first is that within the
American legal system judicial
review is the only way to test
the legality of a law once it is
passed. In Keegan vs. U.S., the
Supreme Court held that one
"who honestly believes a law is
unconstitutional and, therefore,
not obligatory, may well counsel
that the laws shall not be obeyed
. . . this is not knowingly coun
selling ... to evade its com
mand."
Pressure On Legislatures
Second, civil disobedience can
move legislative bodies to pass
laws that they wouldn't other
wise have considered.
Bayard Rustin notes: "When
President Kennedy put before
Congress the Civil Rights Bill,
he said a curious thing: 'Gentle
men of the Congress, I had
never intended to put forth a
civil rights bill; I didn't think it
would be necessary. But we can

not have social peace in the
United States until we can get
the Negroes out of the streets.'
He was saying, in essence, that
the legislature must now make
law in the interest of what those
people were in the streets for."
There is also a moral argu
ment for civil disobedience. Th->
Supreme Court has repeatedly
held that there are degrees of
law. Especially in civil rights
cases, it has held that breaking
unjust local laws in pursuit of
a higher law is justified.
The Court specifically held in
Girouard vs. U.S. that moral law
is above the law of the state.
Follow The Leader?
Lerner's second and third
problems are essentially the
same. He is afraid that civil dis
obedience will breed "total po
litical and legal permissiveness."
Richard Lichtman suggests
this consideration: "One of the
most serious and frequent criti
cisms voiced against acts of civil
disobedience is that they are
wrong because ... if one person
claims the right, there seems no
reason why others cannot claim
it too, and the result would be
the destruction of law and civil
ized society . . . [but] if I com
mit an act of civil disobedience,
how many others will in fact
follow my example . . . and how
good or bad will this general re
sult be? . . . the general result
of an act is the sum of particu
lar individual results and noth
ing more."
Civil disobedience does present
real problems, not just Lerner's
brashly rhetorical ones. Lerner
is right when he says that "It is
worth thinking through. Ideas
do have consequences."

terday's Daily began with what
"is intellectually perhaps the
prime question of our time: to
what extent does political au
thority have a claim on the in
dividual—a moral as well as a
political claim?"
Lerner cites Thoreau as the
source and example of civil dis
obedience, first calling Thoreau
anarchistic and later directly
stating that civil disobedience is

anarchy. From this belief Lerner
proposes three possible conse
quences of civil disobedience.
Linking anarchy and civil dis
obedience suggests that civil dis
obedience denies law both in ar
ticle and in principle.
Since the law is Lerner's
frame of reference I'll confine
myself to legal arguments in
considering another side of the
problems he indicates.
Two Reasons To Disobey
Lerner's first question is
"whether a person who takes a
principled moral stand in dis
obeying the law has a moral
right to appeal to the same legal
structure and the same state to
protect him."
There are two practical legal
istic reasons for committing
civil disobedience.
The first is that within the
American legal system judicial
review is the only way to test
the legality of a law once it is
passed. In Keegan vs. U.S., the
Supreme Court held that one
"who honestly believes a law is
unconstitutional and, therefore,
not obligatory, may well counsel
that the laws shall not be obeyed
. . . this is not knowingly coun
selling ... to evade its com
mand."
Pressure On Legislatures
Second, civil disobedience can
move legislative bodies to pass
laws that they wouldn't other
wise have considered.
Bayard Rustin notes: "When
President Kennedy put before
Congress the Civil Rights Bill,
he said a curious thing: 'Gentle
men of the Congress, I had
never intended to put forth a
civil rights bill; I didn't think it
would be necessary. But we can

not have social peace in the
United States until we can get
the Negroes out of the streets.'
He was saying, in essence, that
the legislature must now make
law in the interest of what those
people were in the streets for."
There is also a moral argu
ment for civil disobedience. Th->
Supreme Court has repeatedly
held that there are degrees of
law. Especially in civil rights
cases, it has held that breaking
unjust local laws in pursuit of
a higher law is justified.
The Court specifically held in
Girouard vs. U.S. that moral law
is above the law of the state.
Follow The Leader?
Lerner's second and third
problems are essentially the
same. He is afraid that civil dis
obedience will breed "total po
litical and legal permissiveness."
Richard Lichtman suggests
this consideration: "One of the
most serious and frequent criti
cisms voiced against acts of civil
disobedience is that they are
wrong because ... if one person
claims the right, there seems no
reason why others cannot claim
it too, and the result would be
the destruction of law and civil
ized society . . . [but] if I com
mit an act of civil disobedience,
how many others will in fact
follow my example . . . and how
good or bad will this general re
sult be? . . . the general result
of an act is the sum of particu
lar individual results and noth
ing more."
Civil disobedience does present
real problems, not just Lerner's
brashly rhetorical ones. Lerner
is right when he says that "It is
worth thinking through. Ideas
do have consequences."
