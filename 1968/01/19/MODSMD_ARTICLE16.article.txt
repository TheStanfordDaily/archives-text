# Books To Go To Philippines
## 
### 
Volunteers in Asia (VIA) is
again sending books to schools
on Mindano Island in the Philip
pines.
Volunteers are needed to help
box books for shipping. Those
interested should meet in the
Branner lounge at 9 a.m. Sat
urday or call Howard Weiss in
Branner.
Approximately 20,000 books
will be sent this year. This is
more than in last year's effort,
when the program sent 13,000
volumes.
These books came from the
Palo Alto Unified School District,
which donated its surplus and
discarded books. Last year the
Menlo-Atherton School District
participated in this way.
The Navy's Project Handclasp
will ship the books free of
charge to Mindanao State Uni
versity where they will be dis
tributed to primary and secon
dary schools and colleges.
