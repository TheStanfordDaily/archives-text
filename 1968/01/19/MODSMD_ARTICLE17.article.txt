"There are many of us who
believe that the war in Vietnam
is immoral and that men should
not be forced to participate in

that involves men In that war.
"While we do not seek indict
ment for the sake of indictment,
we must be willing to risk it for
the sake of an ongoing witness
to the belief in the integrity of
conscience."
