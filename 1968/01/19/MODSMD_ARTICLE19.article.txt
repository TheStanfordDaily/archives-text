# Drugs Misunderstood By Law, Haight-Ashbury Doctor Says

### JENNIE FRASER 
"The large discrepancy be
tween drug use and a buse is due
to the lack of information and
misconceptions of t'he effect of
drugs," a drug expert said Wed
nesday night in Din kelspiel.
"No drug is inherently good or
bad," said Dr. David Smith in
his lecture on "Dilemmas in
Drug Abuse, Treatment, Educa
tion, and Legislation, sponsored
by the Century 21 s ;ories. Defin
ing both marijuana and alcohol
as "drugs with nominal abuse
potentials," Smith said certain
patterns of drug abuse are ac
ceptable in society today, in par
ticular, alcohol intox i cation.
Smith is editor of t he UC Med
ical Center's Journal of Psyche
delic Drugs and founder and di
rector of the Hai ยง:ht- Ashbury
Medical Clinic.
The lack of know ] ledge about
the effect of drugs is; noticeably
evident in drug legislation, said
Smith, citing as a j 3 rime exam
ple the 1965 law on LSD. This
law made sale of [J3D a mis
demeanor, possession of mari
juana a felony, yel: left more
powerful drugs such as STP and
MDA virtually legal I.
"And despite interest, concern
and literature about drugs to
day, the state of California still
considers drug abuse not a
health problem but a criminal
problem."
Smith maintained that unsup

ported information has had
harmful effects on the public
as well, especially in the LSD
chromosomes controversy. Im
mediately after a group of doc
tors reported that birth abnor
malities had been noticed in the
offspring of rats who had been
given LSD, magazines printed
articles attesting to the absolute
certainty of LSD's genetic ef
fect.
"Undeniably the Saturday
Evening Post was responsible
for the deaths of several ba
bies, asserted Smith. The truth
about LSD, Smith asserted, is
that some studies found ab
normalities while others did
not In any case, the studies
involved animals, not people.
"If you will remember," he
continued, "the administration of
thalididomide to rats produces
no birth defects while aspirin
does."
Complicating the knowledge
gap problem, said Smith, is the
lack of concern of professional
people over the sociological
problems of drug usage. "To
date, professional individuals
have remained aloof from cur
rent social problems."
"You can't understand the
problem of drug abuse until you
discover why people are using
them," he explained. A common
misbelief is that drug abusers
were materially or educationally
deprived.

Conversely, the majority of
Haight-Ashbury in h a b i t a nts
come from middle class families
with up to 30 per cent from high
income brackets.
Smith believes this change
of values cannot be credited
to a generation gap, but to a
new developing philosophy
among the youn^.
Dr. Smith urged that "we
must teach young people to
adapt to a rapidly changing
world." "We must teach them
that social activism is a way of
being turned on" he said and
added that there are a "variety
of activities that can turn one
on."
