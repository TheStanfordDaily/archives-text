# Deferment Possible
## ROTC Open To Graduates 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Small but growing numbers
of Stanford graduate students
are protecting themselves from
the threatening uncertainty of
the draft by joining two-year
ROTC programs.
The Army, Navy and Air
Force ROTC are anxious to en
roll the graduate students and
seniors. Enlistments by fresh
men in the standard four-year
programs have declined sharply,
and the military has been de
vising new ways to keep ROTC
ranks filled.
ROTC gives a law, business
or other graduate student an
iron-clad draft deferment for
two years of study. After
completing officer training,
the student can ask for an
"academic delay" to allow him
to earn his degree before
starting four years' active
service as an officer.
Air Force ROTC, which
started a two-year progam at
Stanford two years ago, has five
graduate students among its 32
cadets. Army has three grad

uates among the 31 men in its
two-year program, which started
in 1965. Navy's two-year plan
will be opened to graduate stu
dents next fall.
Stiff competition is anticipated
by ROTC officers for the limited
openings in the next "entering
class." Deadlines for Air Force
and Army applications are Jan.
31; Navy's deadline is March
15. This means a graduating
senior has to apply immediately
if he wants to protect himself
from the draft in graduate
school.
Juniors, seniors and first-year
graduate students will all be
competing for the same places
in the Stanford ROTC quotas,
which are set by the Pentagon.
Maj. Toraki Fukushima says
Army ROTC will take 15 new
cadets into its two-year pro
gram, which starts off in June
with a six-week training camp
at steamy Ft. Benning, Georgia.
The entire first half of the old
four-year ROTC is compressed
into these six weeks, Fuku
shima commented.
Many more graduate stu

dents are expressing an in
terest in the program," Fuku
shima said. At the same time,
freshmen enrollments in the
four-year Army program fell
from (52 to 45 last fall.
Fukushima attributes the
rapid shift to the 1967 draft law.
Undergraduates are guaranteed
a deferment as long as they
stay in good standing, but all
graduate deferments except doc
tors' will be phased out.
Air Force Maj. John Dodds
has 10 openings for men who
don't pass the rigid physical
requirements for pilots. He al
ready has 20 applicants. But
any man who can pass the fly
er's physical "is assured of ac
ceptance," according to Dodds.
Like the Army, two summer
camps are required for the Air
Force cadet. He takes three
units in "aerospace studies"
each quarter.
Dodds indicated the Air Force
is very liberal in giving "aca
demic delays" for graduate stu
dents who want to continue

their studies after receiving
commissions.
"If people would understand
the Air Force as a way of
public service," Dodds com
mented, "they would see it as
a way to plan their lives."
Marine Col. Robert L. Thomas
can't say how many two-year
midshipmen he will enroll in
the brand-new Navy program.
All applications will be pro
cessed in Washington, and the
number accepted for study at
Stanford depends on the Navy's
need. Like the Air Force, pros
pective flyers get taken first.
Thomas explained that the
Navy's increased demand for
officers results from "higher
attrition" in its ranks—meaning
that fewer Naval officers are re
enlisting.
Academic delavs will be tough
to get in the Navy program,
Thomas predicted. A student
with three or more years of
study before his degree isn't
likely to be taken into the two
year program.

ROTC gives a law, business
or other graduate student an
iron-clad draft deferment for
two years of study. After
completing officer training,
the student can ask for an
"academic delay" to allow him
to earn his degree before
starting four years' active
service as an officer.
Air Force ROTC, which
started a two-year progam at
Stanford two years ago, has five
graduate students among its 32
cadets. Army has three grad

uates among the 31 men in its
two-year program, which started
in 1965. Navy's two-year plan
will be opened to graduate stu
dents next fall.
Stiff competition is anticipated
by ROTC officers for the limited
openings in the next "entering
class." Deadlines for Air Force
and Army applications are Jan.
31; Navy's deadline is March
15. This means a graduating
senior has to apply immediately
if he wants to protect himself
from the draft in graduate
school.
Juniors, seniors and first-year
graduate students will all be
competing for the same places
in the Stanford ROTC quotas,

Maj. Toraki Fukushima says
Army ROTC will take 15 new
cadets into its two-year pro
gram, which starts off in June
with a six-week training camp
at steamy Ft. Benning, Georgia.
The entire first half of the old
four-year ROTC is compressed
into these six weeks, Fuku
shima commented.
Many more graduate stu

dents are expressing an in
terest in the program," Fuku
shima said. At the same time,
freshmen enrollments in the
four-year Army program fell
from (52 to 45 last fall.
Fukushima attributes the
rapid shift to the 1967 draft law.
Undergraduates are guaranteed
a deferment as long as they
stay in good standing, but all
graduate deferments except doc

Air Force Maj. John Dodds
has 10 openings for men who
don't pass the rigid physical
requirements for pilots. He al
ready has 20 applicants. But
any man who can pass the fly
er's physical "is assured of ac
ceptance," according to Dodds.
Like the Army, two summer
camps are required for the Air
Force cadet. He takes three
units in "aerospace studies"
each quarter.
Dodds indicated the Air Force
is very liberal in giving "aca
demic delays" for graduate stu
dents who want to continue

their studies after receiving
commissions.
"If people would understand
the Air Force as a way of
public service," Dodds com

a way to plan their lives."
Marine Col. Robert L. Thomas
can't say how many two-year
midshipmen he will enroll in
the brand-new Navy program.
All applications will be pro
cessed in Washington, and the
number accepted for study at
Stanford depends on the Navy's
need. Like the Air Force, pros
pective flyers get taken first.
Thomas explained that the
Navy's increased demand for
officers results from "higher
attrition" in its ranks—meaning
that fewer Naval officers are re
enlisting.
Academic delavs will be tough
to get in the Navy program,
Thomas predicted. A student
with three or more years of
