# Stanford Increase Not Alone
## College Education Cost Still Rising 
### JOHN ALCORN 
Stanford students are un
doutedly aware of the endless
rises in tuition costs here, but
the price of education has been
climbing at almost every college
and university across the coun
try-
Last year four-fifths of Amer
ica's Institutions of higher ed
ucation raised tuition, fees or
room and board prices. At
Stanford, tuition will Increase
trom $1,770 to $1,920 In 1968-
69. After that It will be re
evaluated each year, possibly
reaching $2,300 by 1971, ac
cording to Kenneth Cuthbert
son, vice president for finance.
' . In the past twenty years, aver
age tuition has tripled in the
United States. The U.S. Office
Education reports that $4.9
•billion was spent for higher edu
ction in 1957. In 1967 this figure
reached $16.6 billion, or an in
crease of over 300 per cent.
Higher costs have effected stu

dents in private universities like
Stanford much more than those
in public schools. In 1957 the
average cost per student at a
private university was $1,892.
Last year this figure was $3,414.
By comparison, in schools which
are tax supported, the cost per
student has risen only $388 in
the last ten years, from an aver
age of $1,834 in 1957 to $2,222 in
1967.
But tuition has covered an in
creasingly smaller percentage
of the cost of a student's educa
tion. Stanford's tuition was $660
in 1952, when the education cost
per student was close to $1,000.
This means that the University
had to cover with other income
the other $340.
In 1965 Stanford's tuition was
$1,575, but the amount needed
by the University to educate
each student had risen to $3,495.
In other words, the University
supplemented each student's tui
tion with an additional $1,920.

Since then this amount has con-
tinued to rise.
Stanford's rates, though, are

will charge $1,800 for tuition this
coming September, a $300 in
crease in one year. Tuition

stfill substantial'y lower than
those of major Eastern univer
sities. By next September, when
the newest Stanford increase
takes effect. Harvard, Yale and
Princeton will have tuitions rang
ing from $2,000 to $2,200. Cornell,
Chicago, Caltech, MIT, and Pen
nsylvania will be in approximate
ly the same bracket.
The University of Southern
California, also a private school,

covers only 38 per cent of USC's
operating costs, even less than
Stanford's.
This year the University of
California charged each Califor
nia student a fee of $243, and
in this category ranks 28th
among the nation's public uni
versities.
But the Chancellor of the Uni
versity of California at Los Ang
eles, Franklin D. Murphy, stated
recently that the State Board
of Regents will probably reverse
an earlier decision to hike stu
dent fees on the state's nine
campuses.
The increases in tuition at
Stanford have been paralleled by
a growing number of students
who have applied for financial
aid or deferred payment of tui
tion.
In 1959, when it cost an aver
age of $2,300 total to attend Stan
ford, 1,507 undergraduates were
receiving scholarships and grants
totaling $1,253,000. This year it
takes an average of $3,410 to go
to school here, and approximate
ly 2,000 undergraduates are re
ceiving $2,600,000 in grants and
scholarships.

Robert I'. HulT, director of fin
ancial aicls, stated that the in
crease in t he number of students
receiving aid is "to some extent
the result of higher costs, but
it is also because of a greateV
awareness of the availability of
additional financial aid pro
grams." T1 lere is a current move
ment undi ?r way to double the
number ol ! California state scho
larships."
"The University has to rely
heavily on gift support for
financial aid purposes," Huff
pointed o«jt He added that "It
is nartici ilarly important for
students receiving scholar
ships to make known to those
responsible for the scholarship
what it n leans."
Joseph J r edd, Stanford's assis
tant manager in charge of the
deferred payment program, said
"in the las't; seven years we have
experienced a large increase in
tuition def< ?rments" which is the
result of i.uition increases and
"the fact t hat more students of
limited moans are coming to
Stanford tl lan ever before."
Until las t quarter, there was
no charge for deferring tuition
payments. Officials explained the
reason for the charge was that
approximal ely $1 million of Uni
versity funds was tied up in de
ferred payments each quarter,
and that this in turn meant ex
tra interest costs to Stanford.
Now the interest cost is passed
on to students.
Neverthe iess, the number of
students wi 10 defer their tuition
payments h as risen steadily for
the last fc urteen years. Last
quarter, ho- .vever, there was a
slight dip 1 >ecause of the new
charges.
