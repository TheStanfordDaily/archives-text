## If It Moves, Bomb It 
### BRUCE MERRY 
Felix Greene's Inside North
Vietnam, a 90-minute documen
,'tkry on Communist resistance
to American bombing, played to
two full houses in Memorial Au
ditorium on Wednesday night.
As a movie it fully deserves the
standing ovation which it receiv
ed at the end of the first show

-«Even more moving was the
tiUrst of spontaneous clapping at
trail, austere Ho Chi Minh's ap
pearance on the footage. He
lyanders among his people, rever
i«d as a saviour and loved as
"Uncle Ho." He accepts a cup
of tea from a villager, perches
ojn a stfcp to hear the local ac
tivists speak. Truly it is a long
(distance to the colored tele
phones of the White House and
ItJSe Cadillacs parked outside the
Pentagon.
Pastel Beauty
! movie was made last year
as a journalistic assignment, but
it ends up closer to the edge of
art. There was a remote pastel
beauty in the lingering shots
of fishing boats drifting out
against mauve grey outlines of
sunset, in the faces of starved
bullocks pulling cartloads of
man-shelters along tree-lined city
streets.
Part of the film's success was

its stress on the Vietnamese
physiognomy. The lucid vision
of the woman doctor explaining
her people's resistance (until the
interview was cut short by the
glare of air-raid warnings) had
a striking facial accompaniment.
The tragedy of their resistance
is the fiendish and enormous
civilian toll. We are familiar,
from too little read articles in
the New York Review of Books
and the pages of New Republic,
with the fact that defoliation
and chemical warfare have de
stroyed the ecology of Vietnam.
But Greene's film hinted at the
terrifying civilian mortality:
little children clutching stumps,
their cheeks pock-marked with
pellets, the death of a parent
recorded simply by a white band
wrapped round their skull.
Sacred Commitment
The film turns to a shot-down
American pilot lying in a hos
pital bed, convinced that his
country will take the war to the
polls in 1968 (it certainly will
not), admitting he had been well
treated by the enemy and expect
ing the war to end within a year.
Other subjects interviewed had
little to say for the "democracy"
being granted by our Sacred
Commitment to their brothers
in the South.
The Vietnamese country is

one, not two. The division be
tween them is a false and gra
tuitous one, which makes a dis
tinction that is blurred by na
tionalism into a poke that few
Americans could even begin to
understand. If Greene "only
showed one side of the picture,"
it is because THERE IS NOTH
ING LEFT INTACT BY THE
BOMBING OF NORTH VIET
NAM.
Indignance, Shame
There was indeed no other
"picture to show." In a movie
distinguished as much by its
temperate commentary as by the
transient strains of Vietnamese
singing which accompanied it,
there was precious little need
for Greene to editorialize. And
while indignant American citi
zens filed out of the auditorium
to their parked cars and well
earned apartments, they should
have been ashamed rather than
surprised.
For men like Bernard Fall
and Felix Greene have been
screaming the truth in our ears
for years now. And what do we
do about it? We mutter about
elections, ideology and power.
But there is the Peace and Free
dom Party, isn't there? What
are you, reader, going to do
about it?
