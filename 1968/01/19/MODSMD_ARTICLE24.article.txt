# Five Lost To Injuries
## Stanford Boxers Host Cal Tonight 
### JOHN MERRILL 
A six-bout card will open the
season for the Stanford Boxing
team tonight at 8:00 in Enctna
Gym, as the Indians take on
the boxers from the University
of California.
Long-time Stanford Boxing
Coach Ray Lunny declined to
speculate on the meet outcome,
but explained the reduced sche
dule of matches, with Stanford
not having a entrant in the 147,
172, and 180 pound divisions.
Injuries—Ouch!
"In recent weeks we have lost
five team members to injuries
and other reasons. We are left
with only one returning letter
man." One of the members of
the squad not returning is two
time league champion at 172,
Tom Jenks.
Carter, Moffett Top Card
Lunny singled out Lander Car
ter, 165, and Gene Moffett, heavy
weight, as two individuals who
have looked exceptional in prac
tice sessions. Barney Adler, 156,
is the returning letterman, with
the most experience of anyone
on the squad.
The first bout of the evening
will feature Stanford's George
McFall against Jim Cowart of
Cal, in the 125 pound match. Mc-
Fall, a sophomore, came to the
team for the PE classes in box
ing and has shown a rapid im
provement to win the position.
A Stanford freshman, Brant
Bassett, will battle Cal's Dan
Burnstein at 139. Bassett also
is a product of the PE boxing
program.
Senior Barney Adler opens his
third year of boxing for Stanford
against Bill Holmes of Califor
nia. Adler is a tough competitor,
with the experience edge in this
bout.
Lander Carter, a junior, will

be in his first collegiate match
against either Greg Monohan or
Ray Koch of Cal.
Carter does have other boxing
background and, if pitted against
Mononhan, who is normally the
Bears' top 172 could provide the
best action of the meet.
Two Heavyweights See Action
Coach Lunny will send two
Stanford heavyweights into the
fray against Cal, Gene Moffett
and Chuck Schembra.
Moffett, who has played both
varsity football and rugby at
Stanford, will battle Webb Lloyd
of Cal. Moffett had one fight last
year, scoring a convincing knock
out victory in the Mare Island
Invitational Meet.
Schembra, at 6' 3", 240 pounds,
will face Rod Ott of Cad. Schem
bra, who is principally known
as the discus-man for Payton
Jordan's track team, will be
making his intial appearance as
a Stanford boxer.
The two heavyweight bouts
will round out the collegiate part
of the card, and usually pro
vide more than their share of
the action.
Son-of-Coach Does Battle
In addition to he Stanford-
Cal meet, fans will get a chance
to see one of the best young
boxers in the Bay Area. The son
of the Stanford Coach, and a
high school student at San Car
los, Ray Lunny, Jr., will box an
exhibition.
There are only two home
meets for the Stanford Boxing
Team this year, the other being
against Chico State College on
February 17.
The Cal Meet is usually a good
one, with another meeting plan
ned for Berkeley in February.
Fans are encouraged to be at
Encina early for the best seat
ing in the small gym.

OOF"! Here's a sample of the action that can be expected tonight at 8:00 p.m. In Encina Gym when
the Tribe boxers square off against Cai. In this scene from last year's match, Heavyweight Dave
Oswald lands a left hook to the ribcage of his Bear opponent.

Bears' top 172 could provide the
best action of the meet.
Two Heavyweights See Action
Coach Lunny will send two
Stanford heavyweights into the
fray against Cal, Gene Moffett
and Chuck Schembra.
Moffett, who has played both

of Cal. Moffett had one fight last
year, scoring a convincing knock
out victory in the Mare Island
Invitational Meet.
Schembra, at 6' 3", 240 pounds,
will face Rod Ott of Cad. Schem
bra, who is principally known
as the discus-man for Payton
Jordan's track team, will be
making his intial appearance as
a Stanford boxer.
The two heavyweight bouts
will round out the collegiate part
of the card, and usually pro
vide more than their share of
the action.
Son-of-Coach Does Battle
In addition to he Stanford-
Cal meet, fans will get a chance
to see one of the best young
boxers in the Bay Area. The son

Team this year, the other being

OOF"! Here's a sample of the action that can be expected tonight at 8:00 p.m. In Encina Gym when
the Tribe boxers square off against Cai. In this scene from last year's match, Heavyweight Dave
Oswald lands a left hook to the ribcage of his Bear opponent.
A six-bout card will open the
season for the Stanford Boxing
team tonight at 8:00 in Enctna
Gym, as the Indians take on
the boxers from the University
of California.
Long-time Stanford Boxing
Coach Ray Lunny declined to
speculate on the meet outcome,
but explained the reduced sche
dule of matches, with Stanford
not having a entrant in the 147,
172, and 180 pound divisions.
Injuries—Ouch!
"In recent weeks we have lost
five team members to injuries
and other reasons. We are left
with only one returning letter
man." One of the members of
the squad not returning is two
time league champion at 172,
Tom Jenks.
Carter, Moffett Top Card
Lunny singled out Lander Car
ter, 165, and Gene Moffett, heavy
weight, as two individuals who
have looked exceptional in prac
tice sessions. Barney Adler, 156,
is the returning letterman, with
the most experience of anyone
on the squad.
The first bout of the evening
will feature Stanford's George
McFall against Jim Cowart of
Cal, in the 125 pound match. Mc-
Fall, a sophomore, came to the
team for the PE classes in box
ing and has shown a rapid im
provement to win the position.
A Stanford freshman, Brant
Bassett, will battle Cal's Dan
Burnstein at 139. Bassett also
is a product of the PE boxing
program.
Senior Barney Adler opens his
third year of boxing for Stanford
against Bill Holmes of Califor
nia. Adler is a tough competitor,
with the experience edge in this
bout.
Lander Carter, a junior, will

be in his first collegiate match
against either Greg Monohan or
Ray Koch of Cal.
Carter does have other boxing
background and, if pitted against
Mononhan, who is normally the
Bears' top 172 could provide the
best action of the meet.
