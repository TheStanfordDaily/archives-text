## Paper Lion 
### 
Dave Noland

A sports column may not seem a particularly appropriate place
for a book review, but don't go away, sports fans, it's a book about
football.
The work in question is Paper Lion, by George Plimpton, and any
football fan who misses this one deserves to be banished to an
eternal existence in the Oakland Coliseum watching the Ath
letics play the Senators.
Plimpton, of course, is the suave, intellectual, and very literate
Walter Mitty who gets his kicks by failing at things, and then
writing about it.
In Yankee Stadium a couple of year ago, he pitched to both
All-Star lineups and got bombed. He boxed Archie Moore and got
a bloody nose. He played in a golf tournament with Arnold Palmer
and shot a 119.
In Paper Lion, Plimpton spends a month in the training camp of
the Detroit Lions, and then actually quarterbacks the team during
the final, all-out intra-squad scrimmage. Needless to say, his failure
is complete and hilarious.
This will come as a massive relief to every true sports fan. In
the minds of athlete-worshipers there still lingers a nagging twinge
ot doubt. "How good are those guys really? Back in high school
I could heave the ol' pigskin pretty good, and I'm still pretty fast for
a guy my age, all things considered. If I were in shape, I wonder
if maybe ..."
Plimpton's performance proves beyond a doubt that the gods of
pro football really do belong on their pedestals.
So all of us sports fans can heave a huge sigh of relief, lean back,
id just the color, and go on worshipping, secure in the knowledge
that our heroes are indeed heroic.
Paper Lion is more than just a great book about football.
Plimpton has fashioned a precisely and sensitively written narra
tive about people; the kind of people about whom little is known
except for number, height, weight, and position. Plimpton's athletic
performances may have proved that Alex Karras and Night Train
are properly superhuman on Sunday afternoon, but his liter
ary skills just as convincingly demonstrate that they are real people
off the field.
He describes things not usually seen by run-of-the-mill football
writers. Chorus lines of 250-pound rookies clad only in jock straps,
the real tears trickling down the cheeks of players who didn't make
the final cut — descriptions such as these give Paper Lion an
ppeal that raises It above the classification of a football book.
Plimpton has created a refreshingly entertaining and literate work
that just happens to be about football.

ppeal that raises It above the classification of a football book.
Plimpton has created a refreshingly entertaining and literate work
that just happens to be about football.

A sports column may not seem a particularly appropriate place
for a book review, but don't go away, sports fans, it's a book about
football.
The work in question is Paper Lion, by George Plimpton, and any
football fan who misses this one deserves to be banished to an
eternal existence in the Oakland Coliseum watching the Ath
letics play the Senators.
Plimpton, of course, is the suave, intellectual, and very literate
Walter Mitty who gets his kicks by failing at things, and then
writing about it.
In Yankee Stadium a couple of year ago, he pitched to both
All-Star lineups and got bombed. He boxed Archie Moore and got
a bloody nose. He played in a golf tournament with Arnold Palmer
and shot a 119.
In Paper Lion, Plimpton spends a month in the training camp of
the Detroit Lions, and then actually quarterbacks the team during
the final, all-out intra-squad scrimmage. Needless to say, his failure
is complete and hilarious.
This will come as a massive relief to every true sports fan. In
the minds of athlete-worshipers there still lingers a nagging twinge
ot doubt. "How good are those guys really? Back in high school
I could heave the ol' pigskin pretty good, and I'm still pretty fast for
a guy my age, all things considered. If I were in shape, I wonder
if maybe ..."
Plimpton's performance proves beyond a doubt that the gods of
pro football really do belong on their pedestals.
So all of us sports fans can heave a huge sigh of relief, lean back,
id just the color, and go on worshipping, secure in the knowledge
that our heroes are indeed heroic.
Paper Lion is more than just a great book about football.
Plimpton has fashioned a precisely and sensitively written narra
tive about people; the kind of people about whom little is known
except for number, height, weight, and position. Plimpton's athletic
performances may have proved that Alex Karras and Night Train
are properly superhuman on Sunday afternoon, but his liter
ary skills just as convincingly demonstrate that they are real people
off the field.
He describes things not usually seen by run-of-the-mill football
writers. Chorus lines of 250-pound rookies clad only in jock straps,
the real tears trickling down the cheeks of players who didn't make
the final cut — descriptions such as these give Paper Lion an
ppeal that raises It above the classification of a football book.
