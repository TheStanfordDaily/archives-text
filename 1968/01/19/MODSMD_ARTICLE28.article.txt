## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford swimmers host Ore
gon today at 3 p.m., and Oregon
State's Beavers waddle into the
Encina Pool tomorrow at 2 p.m.
to face the Indians at the same
time the Stanford frosh take on
the Arden Hills Swim Club.
Oregon beat Stanford three
years ago, but the times have
been a-changin' ever since. The
Duck's only big threat to the
NCAA champion Indians is free
style sprinter Bob Boyer.
Boyer took the AAWU 50 free
style last year in 21.1, the sec
ond fastest time in the country:
With Boyer for an anchor man,
the Duck's freestyle relay could
push the Tribe hard.
Oregon State should give Stan
ford coach Jim Gaughran the
opportunity to try the Cards in
possible outside events for the
NCAA's.
The frosh won't have such an
easy time of it, however. Arden
Hills is the summer home of
Stanford freshman John Ferris,
who last week broke the NCAA
freshman record for 200 butter
fly at 1:52.9.
World record distance free
stylers Mike Burton and DebJue
Meyer also train at Arden Hills

during the summer under Pan
Am Women's coach Sherm Cha
voor.
Stanford's Pete Siebert cur
rently holds the nation's top
ranking in the 200 individual
medley on the basis of a 2:00.6
effort two weeks ago. Sophomore
butterflier Jim Nicholoff has the
second fastest 200 fly to far at
2:00.9.
Ken Hammer's 21.9 50 makes
the top 6 rankings. Luis *Nicolao
hit 48.0 and 1:46.4 for 100 and
200 freestyle last week, both
among individual medley, and a
2:17.9 breaststfoke after the flu,
made the top 6 , in those three
events. Bob Momsen's 2:17.8 ,200

breaststroke tops the sheet.
Both of Stanford's relays are
in the top ranks. The Tribe has
progressed considerably further
than at this time last year.

the Duck's freestyle relay could
push the Tribe hard.
Oregon State should give Stan
ford coach Jim Gaughran the
opportunity to try the Cards in
possible outside events for the
NCAA's.
The frosh won't have such an
easy time of it, however. Arden
Hills is the summer home of
Stanford freshman John Ferris,
who last week broke the NCAA
freshman record for 200 butter
fly at 1:52.9.
World record distance free
stylers Mike Burton and DebJue
Meyer also train at Arden Hills

during the summer under Pan
Am Women's coach Sherm Cha
voor.
Stanford's Pete Siebert cur
rently holds the nation's top
ranking in the 200 individual
medley on the basis of a 2:00.6
effort two weeks ago. Sophomore
butterflier Jim Nicholoff has the
second fastest 200 fly to far at
2:00.9.
Ken Hammer's 21.9 50 makes
the top 6 rankings. Luis *Nicolao
hit 48.0 and 1:46.4 for 100 and
200 freestyle last week, both
among individual medley, and a
2:17.9 breaststfoke after the flu,
made the top 6 , in those three
events. Bob Momsen's 2:17.8 ,200

breaststroke tops the sheet.
Both of Stanford's relays are
in the top ranks. The Tribe has
progressed considerably further
than at this time last year.
