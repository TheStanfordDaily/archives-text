# Motorcyclist Hurt In Crash With Car
## 
### 
Dee Hermann, a junior from
Phoenix, collided with a moving
automobile yesterday morning
as she drove a Honda 90 motor
cycle through the Galvez St.
blockade posts near the under
graduate library.
Peter Siebert, a junior and a
member of Beta Theta Pi fra
ternity, was turning his Pontiac
Cutlass into the parking lot be
hind the main library when Miss
Hermann's motorcycle collided
with his car.
Miss Hermann, who jumped
clear before impact, received
"abrasions and contusions on her
lower legs," but was not serious
ly injured, according to a Uni
versity spokesman.
Resting in the Cowell Health
Center yesterday afternoon,
Miss Hermann declined to com
ment on her accident.
The collision occurred next to
the controversial white jump
posts which were installed last

fall to block through traffic on
Galvez St.
The original placement of the
barrier was a subject discussed
at length in meetings of the traf
fic committee, according to Uni
versity business manager,
Dwight Adams.
Adams commented yesterday
afternoon, "The problem of a
possible accident like this one,
a motorcycle or bike sneaking
through the posts, was never
given consideration in the meet
ings.
"But there was unanimous
agreement to close the street.
Unfortunately we probably
picked the wrong street and
place," he continued. "The type
of barrier was not dicussed ei
ther."
Adams indicated that the next
meeting of the traffic committee
will definitely consider the re
construction or relocation of the
barrier as a result of yesterday's
accident.
