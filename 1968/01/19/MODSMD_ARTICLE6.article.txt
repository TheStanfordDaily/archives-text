# Kasperak Receives Another Operation
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Mike Kasporak underwent his
th'rd major operation in less
than two weeks Thursday eve
ning, this time to stop major
blooding from intestinal ulcers.
Kasporak, who received a
transplanted heart Jan. 6, is still
in critical condition.
Kasporak had his gall bladder
rrmovod last Sunday morning,
slightly more than a week after
he received the heart of Mrs.
Virginia Mae White, a Santa
Clara housewife.
Yesterdav's operation was ne
cessitated by blooding from mul
tiple ulcerations of the duode
num, the first portion of the
small intestine.
Bloediner Sites Closed
Th * major bleeding sites were
closed, and the nerves to the
which had been caus
ing excossive gastric secretions,
were cut. In addition, the open
ing from the stomach to the
small intestine was widened to
onse drainage.
Dr. Harry Oborhelman Jr., pro
fessor of surgery, who per
formed the operation, noted "The
patient's condition is still criti
cal. His heart has withstood the
present surgery in an excellent
manner, however."
Oborhelman also said the op
eration was more taxing to Kas
perak's liver than to his heart,
and that the patient's blood pres
sure was somewhat below nor
mal, not unusual after such sur
gery.
The operation began at 4:45
p.m., and lasted approximately
two hours. Kasperak received
ten units of blood prior to going
Into surgery, and five units af
ter the operation.
Little Rejection
"His heart has shown very lit
tle evidence of rejection, and
except for the effects of massive
bleeding, his heart has withstood
the operation very well," Ober
helman said.
The surgeon also stated that
Kasperak's liver had biop
sied, and from "gross inspec
tion" it appeared "to be some
what improved over the previ
ous operation," although micro
scopic examination had not been
completed.

It was a liver disease which
Kasperak has had for some time
whirh brought about the previ
ous decision to remove the pa
tient's gall bladder.
A tube was also placed in Kas
perak's stomach in the opera
tion, to keep the stomach decom
pressed.
Oborhelman said this was
needed because after the nerves
to the stomach are severed, the
organ "doesn't empty itself as
well. It takes three or four days
for it to regain its muscle tone."
Kasperak was returned to h.s
room in the intensive care unit
after the operation. His wife was
with him. Oberhelman said he
expected the patient to rest
"fairly comfortably" during the
nipht.
