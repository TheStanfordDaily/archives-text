# U.S. To Follow Britain's Fall?
## 
### Henry J. Taylor 
On January 22, 1901, Queen
Victoria died, age 82. At 18 she
received a crown that had been
tarnished by ineptitude and
wore It with honor for 63 years
in what was by four years the
longest reign, and by three days
the longest royal life, in British
history.
The incredible era's end sig
naled by this date should remind
us vividly what can happen to a
nation that is the No. 1 power
in the world as we are today.
In only the 31 years between
1870 and 1901 Great Britain ac
quired 4.7 million square miles
of territory; France, 3.6 million;
Germany, one million; Belgium,
one million—or 77 times Bel
gium's own size.
One European nation after
another, along with Japan, en
croached on China. But China
herself had been colonizing for
2,500 years — intermarrying
with others and making them
Chinese. Only some Far East
seaports were secure, and to
day's hard-pressed Hong Kong
was Britain's jewel among
these, acquired for Victoria
from Emperor Tao Kuang on
January 20, 1841, in the fourth
year of her reign by the Treaty
of Chuenpi.
Opera For Number 1
Verdi composed the opera
"Aida" for the inauguration of
the Suez Canal, the canal that
made Africa an island, on No
vember 17,1869. The French had
supplied the money and the man
—Ferdinand de Lesseps — for
Egyptian Khedive Ismail to Brit
ain's dismay. French Empress
Eugenie and de Lesseps were
aboard the yacht that led the

-50 - ship inaugural procession
through what is now Nasser's
canal but in a deliberate snub
Egypt placed the great vessel
carrying Victoria's represent
ative far down the line. For, as
usual, Britain's unpopularity
rose with her prestige—the in
evitable effect on us today as
the world's No. 1 power.
Lord Beaconsfield (Benjamin
Disraeli) ultimately paid $18
million for Ismail's controlling
shares of the canal—to gain a
route 6,000 miles shorter than
the old way around Africa, and
it was he who crowned Victoria
"Empress of Indian." But Bea
consfield was what you might
call ?. total diplomate, without
strong feelings on most sub
jects.
Victoria's Lords Palmerston
and Clarendon, not Disraeli,
made the British Foreign Office
and left it at its greatest. It has
been gradually declining ever
since. This column recently men
tioned how, by skillfully apply
ing Britain's balance of power,
they even blocked a Franco-
Prussian war. German Chancel
lor Otto von Bismarck had to
wait for them to die before he
could start the war.
Gulf Between Men
Editor William Thomas Stead
of London's vigorous Pall Mall
Gazette introduced the "inter
view" into British—and world—
journalism in 1884. The occa
sion was Gen. Charles (Chinese)
Gordon's blast at the govern
ment —which meant Prime Min
ister William E. Gladstone—on
Gordon's return from inspecting
the Sudan. Gladstone made

comebacks and Margot Asquith
said of him: "What a gulf be
tween him and most men," but
he was a man Victoria never
could understand.
Lord Salisbury, the English
gentleman personified—a Cecil
who had behind him the long
stability of belonging on top—
was called the Hamlet of Brit
ish diplomacy. Above conven
tions, he went so far as to re
fuse as Prime Minister to live
in Downing Street. Oxford is
said to produce statesmen who
distrust great thoughts even if
they think thorn. But Salisbury's
prestige with the Queen was un
parallelel; he was, in audience,
the only minister that Victoria
ever invited to sit down. He had
bad legs.
By June 22, 1897, Victoria's
sovereignty extended across a
quarter of the entire land sur
face of the world. The living evi
dence of this marched in splen
did ranks to the thanksgiving
service in St. Paul's that inaugu
rated Queen Victoria's Diamond
Jubilee.
The Empire never seemed so
great, nor the future so secure,
as on that sun-showered day.
But as so often happens when
an institution seems at its high
est force, actually the process of
decay has already set in. As is
easy now to see, Queen Vic
toria's Diamond Jubilee be
longed to the twilight, not the
noontide, of British security.
The first great flaw in Brit
ain's position as the No. 1 power
in the world was revealed by
her failure to promptly win the
Boer War—a tiny enemy fight

ing in an area only the size of
Vietnam.
For our United States, as well,
this very minute has history in
it. Our stalemate war in Korea
was one too many.

herself had been colonizing for
2,500 years — intermarrying
with others and making them
Chinese. Only some Far East
seaports were secure, and to

Opera For Number 1
Verdi composed the opera
"Aida" for the inauguration of
the Suez Canal, the canal that
made Africa an island, on No
vember 17,1869. The French had
supplied the money and the man
—Ferdinand de Lesseps — for
Egyptian Khedive Ismail to Brit
ain's dismay. French Empress
Eugenie and de Lesseps were
aboard the yacht that led the

-50 - ship inaugural procession
through what is now Nasser's
canal but in a deliberate snub
Egypt placed the great vessel
carrying Victoria's represent
ative far down the line. For, as
usual, Britain's unpopularity
rose with her prestige—the in
evitable effect on us today as
the world's No. 1 power.
Lord Beaconsfield (Benjamin
Disraeli) ultimately paid $18
million for Ismail's controlling
shares of the canal—to gain a
route 6,000 miles shorter than
the old way around Africa, and
it was he who crowned Victoria
"Empress of Indian." But Bea
consfield was what you might
call ?. total diplomate, without
strong feelings on most sub

Victoria's Lords Palmerston

Prussian war. German Chancel
lor Otto von Bismarck had to
wait for them to die before he
could start the war.
Gulf Between Men
Editor William Thomas Stead
of London's vigorous Pall Mall
Gazette introduced the "inter
view" into British—and world—
journalism in 1884. The occa
sion was Gen. Charles (Chinese)
Gordon's blast at the govern
ment —which meant Prime Min
ister William E. Gladstone—on
Gordon's return from inspecting
the Sudan. Gladstone made

comebacks and Margot Asquith
said of him: "What a gulf be
tween him and most men," but
he was a man Victoria never
could understand.
Lord Salisbury, the English
gentleman personified—a Cecil
who had behind him the long
stability of belonging on top—
was called the Hamlet of Brit
ish diplomacy. Above conven
tions, he went so far as to re
fuse as Prime Minister to live
in Downing Street. Oxford is
said to produce statesmen who
distrust great thoughts even if
they think thorn. But Salisbury's
prestige with the Queen was un
parallelel; he was, in audience,
the only minister that Victoria
ever invited to sit down. He had
bad legs.
By June 22, 1897, Victoria's
sovereignty extended across a
quarter of the entire land sur
face of the world. The living evi
dence of this marched in splen
did ranks to the thanksgiving
service in St. Paul's that inaugu
rated Queen Victoria's Diamond
Jubilee.
The Empire never seemed so
great, nor the future so secure,
as on that sun-showered day.
But as so often happens when
an institution seems at its high
est force, actually the process of
decay has already set in. As is
easy now to see, Queen Vic
toria's Diamond Jubilee be
longed to the twilight, not the
noontide, of British security.
The first great flaw in Brit
ain's position as the No. 1 power
in the world was revealed by
her failure to promptly win the

ing in an area only the size of
Vietnam.
For our United States, as well,
this very minute has history in

On January 22, 1901, Queen
Victoria died, age 82. At 18 she
received a crown that had been
tarnished by ineptitude and

in what was by four years the
longest reign, and by three days
the longest royal life, in British
history.

Gulf Between Men
Editor William Thomas Stead
of London's vigorous Pall Mall
Gazette introduced the "inter
view" into British—and world—
journalism in 1884. The occa
sion was Gen. Charles (Chinese)
Gordon's blast at the govern
ment —which meant Prime Min
ister William E. Gladstone—on
Gordon's return from inspecting
the Sudan. Gladstone made

comebacks and Margot Asquith
said of him: "What a gulf be

he was a man Victoria never
could understand.
Lord Salisbury, the English
gentleman personified—a Cecil
who had behind him the long
stability of belonging on top—
was called the Hamlet of Brit

tions, he went so far as to re
fuse as Prime Minister to live
in Downing Street. Oxford is
said to produce statesmen who
distrust great thoughts even if
they think thorn. But Salisbury's
prestige with the Queen was un
parallelel; he was, in audience,
the only minister that Victoria
ever invited to sit down. He had
bad legs.
By June 22, 1897, Victoria's
sovereignty extended across a
quarter of the entire land sur
face of the world. The living evi

rated Queen Victoria's Diamond
Jubilee.
The Empire never seemed so
great, nor the future so secure,
as on that sun-showered day.
But as so often happens when
an institution seems at its high

decay has already set in. As is
easy now to see, Queen Vic
toria's Diamond Jubilee be
longed to the twilight, not the
noontide, of British security.
The first great flaw in Brit
ain's position as the No. 1 power
in the world was revealed by
her failure to promptly win the
Boer War—a tiny enemy fight

ing in an area only the size of
Vietnam.
For our United States, as well,
this very minute has history in
it. Our stalemate war in Korea

On January 22, 1901, Queen
Victoria died, age 82. At 18 she
received a crown that had been
tarnished by ineptitude and
wore It with honor for 63 years
in what was by four years the
longest reign, and by three days
the longest royal life, in British
history.
The incredible era's end sig
naled by this date should remind
us vividly what can happen to a
nation that is the No. 1 power
in the world as we are today.
In only the 31 years between
1870 and 1901 Great Britain ac
quired 4.7 million square miles
of territory; France, 3.6 million;
Germany, one million; Belgium,
one million—or 77 times Bel
gium's own size.
One European nation after
another, along with Japan, en
croached on China. But China
herself had been colonizing for
2,500 years — intermarrying
with others and making them
Chinese. Only some Far East
seaports were secure, and to
day's hard-pressed Hong Kong
was Britain's jewel among
these, acquired for Victoria
from Emperor Tao Kuang on
January 20, 1841, in the fourth
year of her reign by the Treaty
of Chuenpi.
Opera For Number 1
Verdi composed the opera
"Aida" for the inauguration of
the Suez Canal, the canal that
made Africa an island, on No
vember 17,1869. The French had
supplied the money and the man
—Ferdinand de Lesseps — for
Egyptian Khedive Ismail to Brit
ain's dismay. French Empress
Eugenie and de Lesseps were
aboard the yacht that led the
