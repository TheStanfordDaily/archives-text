## Can It Happen Here? 
### Christopher Hargrove 
A small number of students
on this campus have tried for
several years—unsuccessfully —
to arouse a degree of moral and
revolutionary fervor among
their fellows.
David Harris probably came
as close to doing this as any
body. But to the disillusionment
of his closest followers and the
relief of his elders, Harris
failed.
Peter Lyman, following in
Harris's spiritual footsteps, also
tried. His approach was some
what softer, though he was no
less committed to an ideal of a
better society.
He too failed, partly because
his personality was not as dy
namically attractive as Harris's
and thus could not weld a move
ment by sheer magnetism; part
ly because he was not by nature
a proselytizer; and partly be
cause the disappointment follow
ing Harris's resignation from
the ASSU presidency had weak
ened the dedication of all but a
very few.
Immunity Here
Today as then, curious ob
servers and still-hopeful activists
are driven to ask why, 40 miles
from Berkeley, the students of
a major university—who elected
as their president a bearded
revolutionary one year and an
outspoken liberal political scien
tist the next —seem so immune
to the contagion of dissent and
rebellion that has swept campus
es from San Francisco to Bos
ton.
Are Stanford students too com
fortable? Are they apathetic?
Are they naive? Are they stu
pid?
No, they are not stupid. Nor
is the answer that they are sim
ply bourgeois; for so, after all,
were Lenin, Trotsky and Mao.
The difference with the latter
group, however, was that they
were not products of a society
dominated by their own class.
Middle Class In Charge
The middle classes of Russia
and China were not in charge.
In America, the middle class is
in charge, and if Stanford is
nothing else, it is middle class.
But that answer is not enough
either to explain the complacen
cy of the average Stanford stu
dent. For American young peo
ple are oppressed (General Her
shey calls it "channeled") by,
ironically, their own class. Why
is there no resentment?
The forms of oppression are
rarely as blatant and heavy
handed as the Selective Service,
but they pervade and direct our
lives no less completely — so
much, in fact, that we take them
for granted and hardly notice
them.
For example, we are taught
from infancy that our goal in
life is to succeed—at anything,
but preferably if it pays reason
ably well. It hardly occurs to us,
until we are perhaps 45 years
old, to think otherwise.
I mean not to imply that we
are forcibly pushed into accept
ing a success-oriented system of
values. It is a much less direct
kind of coercion, one which
makes the alternatives seem so
unattractive, socially unaccept
able —or distant that our minds
are shut to them and we are
left no real choice except to de

cide what we are going to be
"successful" at.
Social conformity is nothing
new, of course, but methods of
enforcing it have never been so
sophisticated or so prone to ma
nipulation.
Unquestionably many students
are vaguely aware that some
thing is wrong (some are in
tensely aware of it), as recent
student elections attest. But they
are too afraid or too materially
comfortable to claim their free
dom. Or they may think they
already have it.
Society has bought their si
lence and they were not even

aware of the transaction.
Now our president Is Cesare
Massarenti, a studeat of sociolo
gy and no stranger to politics.
Massarenti has been in office
less than two months but he has
lost no time in communicating
his sense of urgency to the stu
dent legislature and the student
body at large.
It remains to be seen, how
ever, whether he will succeed—
where Harris and Lyman failed
—to "politicize," as he puts it,
the politically dormant young
heirs to the Great Society now
populating our potentially great
university.
