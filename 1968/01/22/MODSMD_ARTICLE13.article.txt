## Lesson In Politics From Old Herbie 
### Herbie Hinkes 
All you political science ma
jors crowd around now and your
ole uncle Herbie is going to give
you a lesson in politics.
What's that? You say you
know all that stuff already? Let
me give you a brief quiz before
we start:
If Sen. Eugene McCarthy had
been chosen by LBJ to be his
vice-president in 1964, what
would Hubert Humphrey be do
ing now?
None of you seem to know, so
let me explain: He would still
be in the Americans for Demo
cratic Action and would be bit
terly feuding with LBJ over
Vietnam. The feud, at times,
would be so acrimonious that his
name would be rumored as a
possibility to run against John
son for the Democratic nomina
tion.
How about another question—
how much trouble will Johnson
have being renominated?
And anyone who says McCar
thy is going to cause LBJ any
trouble will flunk this quiz.
Johnson will be renominated,
and, most likely, re-elected. But
this campaign will be different
than most.
For example, Johnson's pre
convention speeches will have to
be given on military bases,
where extremely tight security
can be arranged. Holding the
speeches out in the real world
would mean that Johnson will
have to take several changes of
clothes with him on each speak
ing tour. The red paint doesn't
come out so easily.
But as long as he stays in gov
ernment buildings atid military
bases, Johnson will be able to
carry out at least a mediocre
pre-convention campaign. Which
is about all that an incumbent
president needs anyway.
But what about the conven
tion?
Well, remember all those sol

diers who were flown to the
Pentagon in October to hold the
fortress against the assault of
the dissatisfied?
They will be the same soldiers
who guard the Democratic Con
vention in Chicago.
I suppose they'll start out just
guarding the entrances to the
convention hall, but after they
are hit by wave after wave of
protestors—just like Oakland—
the streets will be sealed off.
And this time the whole affair
will be on live network televi
sion.
Inside the convention hall, a
very abbreviated type of conven
tion will renominate Lyndon
Johnson.
Of course, Johnson doesn't
need to be present at the con
vention to accept the nomina
tion. He can stay at the White
House and make his acceptance
speech there.
But knowing our boy from the
Pedernales, he'll come. And the
Chicago paint stores will sell out
of red paint.
The post-convention campaign
will closely resemble the pre
convention campaign. The In
auguration will look like the con
vention.
But what will the toll be by
early January, 1969?
Will 10 demonstrators have
died? Or will the number be
closer to 100? Or 1000?
The voice of dissent and frus
tration is small now, but it ap
pears to be growing more un
compromising, more demanding.
Simultaneously, the war be
comes a little bigger.
"No more marches. No more
rallies. No more speeches.
The dialogue is over, baby.
Tolerance of rational dissent
has become an insidious form
of repression. The goal now is
to disrupt an insance society."
—Paul Krassner, Editor, The
Realist.
