## Responses Criticize Turmoil With BSU 
### 
Editor, the Dally:
The only difference between
me and a militant black is fear.
I am afraid of the extremist
mentality. It may be useful to
think in only Black or White
terms but it is not real. It may
be useful to listen only to my
own anguish but I cannot deny
any man's humanity without
denying my own.
I can't say I see no reflection
of myself in the bigot. My re
fusal to listen and attitude of
pre-judgment are the same. My
self-righteous ignorance is the
same. But I am so afraid to
acknowledge my observation. I
am afraid I will be called a
Black Bourgeoise or a White
Nigger. I am afraid that my
statements will align me with
scared whites who say the same
thing to keep me from threat
ening them.
If you criticize democracy you
must be a Commie because they
do it. If you question the efficacy
of pulling out in Viet Nam you
must be a Bircher. If you ques
tion your parents' values you
must be a Dirty Hippie. The
opposition encompasses all evil.
The Yellow Peril, The Red Peril,
The Man, The Militant Black,
The Hippie Doper are bogey
men, hordes of Anti-Christs.
Minds must remain closed to
the opposition, they must never
be listened to.
So I curse my cowardness and
inability to be blind. I coax my
self with rationalizations: it's
necessary to overemphasize in
order to be strong; when we
win I'll be open to contradic
tions; the exceptions aren't im
portant in light of the whole.
I tell myself that my objec
tions are the brainwash of the
white man's education; that he
has no morality and justifies
only through power; that he
has purposely taught me to
wade in intellectual oceans
which immobilize me to act
against him. But I still hesitate.
I wonder who has enslaved who
in what entanglement. I still
see no difference between our
sins of omission and any other
age's or movement's.
So when my fever pitched
emotion takes a breather I try
to hide behind the excuse that
an open mind is of necessity
weak and should therefore be
quiet. But I can no longer rely
on name calling to get me by.
I know that reform or revolu
tion is useless when the new
order has the same basic closed
mind as the old.
It is fortunate that I agree
with militant aims. But I mustn't
forfeit the ability to see our
selves in light of all contradic
tory others because someday I
may disagree and be confronted
with that same closed minded
group I helped nurture. The
price of real victory is not blind
ness.

The Bourgeois Press
Editor, the Daily:
In reference to Mr. Scott's
letter in Thursday's Dally I am
at a loss to understand exactly
what his complaint is with the

BSU. If indeed it is a complaint
against the bourgeois leadership
within the BSU, then why com
plain io a white press which is
basically bourgeois (as Stanford
is). From what little contact I
have had with Stanford's black
community there appears to be
a real effort to keep problems
within the community and at the
same time do something rather
than just talk. By making an
incoherent statement which in
dicates only dissatisfaction, Mr.
Scott does his race and his cause
a disservice.

• Pave The Quad
And Cut The Walking
Editor, the Daily:
Let's all bleed in the heart
for the poor secretaries who
have to walk to work. We all
know how damaging walking is
to the human body; the mind
boggles at the thought of fifteen
minutes of this torture. We sug
gest that all trees in and around
the Quad be cut down and the
entire area paved (with green
concrete, if necessary, to satisfy
the nature lovers and other
nuts). By so doing we will im
prove the environment for auto

The only difference between
me and a militant black is fear.
I am afraid of the extremist
mentality. It may be useful to
think in only Black or White
terms but it is not real. It may
be useful to listen only to my
own anguish but I cannot deny
any man's humanity without
denying my own.
I can't say I see no reflection
of myself in the bigot. My re
fusal to listen and attitude of
pre-judgment are the same. My
self-righteous ignorance is the
same. But I am so afraid to
acknowledge my observation. I
am afraid I will be called a
Black Bourgeoise or a White
Nigger. I am afraid that my
statements will align me with
scared whites who say the same
thing to keep me from threat
ening them.
If you criticize democracy you
must be a Commie because they
do it. If you question the efficacy
of pulling out in Viet Nam you
must be a Bircher. If you ques
tion your parents' values you
must be a Dirty Hippie. The
opposition encompasses all evil.
The Yellow Peril, The Red Peril,
The Man, The Militant Black,
The Hippie Doper are bogey
men, hordes of Anti-Christs.
Minds must remain closed to
the opposition, they must never
be listened to.
So I curse my cowardness and
inability to be blind. I coax my
self with rationalizations: it's
necessary to overemphasize in
order to be strong; when we
win I'll be open to contradic
tions; the exceptions aren't im
portant in light of the whole.
I tell myself that my objec
tions are the brainwash of the
white man's education; that he
has no morality and justifies
only through power; that he
has purposely taught me to
wade in intellectual oceans
which immobilize me to act
against him. But I still hesitate.
I wonder who has enslaved who
in what entanglement. I still
see no difference between our
sins of omission and any other
age's or movement's.
So when my fever pitched
emotion takes a breather I try
to hide behind the excuse that
an open mind is of necessity
weak and should therefore be
quiet. But I can no longer rely
on name calling to get me by.
I know that reform or revolu
tion is useless when the new
order has the same basic closed
mind as the old.
It is fortunate that I agree
with militant aims. But I mustn't
forfeit the ability to see our
selves in light of all contradic
tory others because someday I
may disagree and be confronted
with that same closed minded
group I helped nurture. The

The Hippie Doper are bogey
men, hordes of Anti-Christs.
Minds must remain closed to
the opposition, they must never
be listened to.
So I curse my cowardness and
inability to be blind. I coax my
self with rationalizations: it's
necessary to overemphasize in
order to be strong; when we
win I'll be open to contradic
tions; the exceptions aren't im
portant in light of the whole.
I tell myself that my objec
tions are the brainwash of the
white man's education; that he
has no morality and justifies
only through power; that he
has purposely taught me to
wade in intellectual oceans
which immobilize me to act
against him. But I still hesitate.
I wonder who has enslaved who
in what entanglement. I still
see no difference between our
sins of omission and any other
age's or movement's.
So when my fever pitched
emotion takes a breather I try
to hide behind the excuse that
an open mind is of necessity
weak and should therefore be
quiet. But I can no longer rely
on name calling to get me by.
I know that reform or revolu
tion is useless when the new
order has the same basic closed
mind as the old.
It is fortunate that I agree
with militant aims. But I mustn't
forfeit the ability to see our
selves in light of all contradic
tory others because someday I
may disagree and be confronted
with that same closed minded
group I helped nurture. The
price of real victory is not blind

Editor, the Daily:
In reference to Mr. Scott's
letter in Thursday's Dally I am
at a loss to understand exactly
what his complaint is with the

BSU. If indeed it is a complaint
against the bourgeois leadership
within the BSU, then why com
plain io a white press which is
basically bourgeois (as Stanford
is). From what little contact I
have had with Stanford's black
community there appears to be
a real effort to keep problems
within the community and at the
same time do something rather
than just talk. By making an
incoherent statement which in
dicates only dissatisfaction, Mr.
Scott does his race and his cause
a disservice.

The only difference between
me and a militant black is fear.
I am afraid of the extremist
mentality. It may be useful to
think in only Black or White
terms but it is not real. It may
be useful to listen only to my
own anguish but I cannot deny
any man's humanity without
denying my own.
I can't say I see no reflection
of myself in the bigot. My re
fusal to listen and attitude of
pre-judgment are the same. My
self-righteous ignorance is the
same. But I am so afraid to
acknowledge my observation. I
am afraid I will be called a
Black Bourgeoise or a White
Nigger. I am afraid that my
statements will align me with
scared whites who say the same
thing to keep me from threat
ening them.
If you criticize democracy you
must be a Commie because they
do it. If you question the efficacy
of pulling out in Viet Nam you
must be a Bircher. If you ques
tion your parents' values you
must be a Dirty Hippie. The
opposition encompasses all evil.
