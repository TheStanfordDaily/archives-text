# Sunday Morning Happening
## Hardy Band Awaits Times 
### AN OBSERVER 
The Sunday morning commu
nity of the New York Times,
located in and around the Tres
idder Union drug store, is grow
in leaps, bounds, and loyalty.
Before the San Francisco
newspaper strike, the commu
nity had no cohesion or sense
of interdependence. But today,
with the Times being the only
Sunday morning paper in the
Bay Area, the community has
acquired a sense of purpose,
and at times intense frustration.
The first loyal Times buyers
usually arrives at Tresidder
about 11 a.m. with book in hand
or friends in tow to pass the
time. By 11:30 the area outside
the drug store is filled with
familiar faces, nodding greet
ings to one another, always pre
faced by the question "It hasn't
come yet, has it?"
The men In the drug store
are eternal optimists, always
assuring the loyalists that the
paper is due in a minute. In
truth, no one, Including the de
liveryman knows when the
paper will arrive or how many
there will be.
Two weeks ago, the commu
nity gathered early and by noon
there were at least 25 members
on hand. The store was doing a
brisk business in magazines and
food.
One chap arrived, obviously
out of breath, reporting he had
just come from Mac's Smoke
Shop in Palo Alto where the
paper had been sold out. Gasp
ing for breath he said, "I phoned
Mac's and they said the paper
had just arrived. I figured that

meant it would arrive here at
Stanford any minute so I came
over here. When I saw it hadn't
come, I drove right down to
Mac's. Just as I got there the
last one was being sold. So I
came right back here.'
Just as he finished his story,
the deliveryman did indeed ar
rive and the crowd rushed into
line behind the cash register.
But alas, he had brought just
10 copies. Five were reserved
by departments. That left five
copies for 30 people. Would the
community share the gem': or
would it be survival of the fit
test? The tradition of the line
remained supreme, and the first
five in line left somewhat em
harassed yet satisfied that it
would be a normal Sunday. The
man from Mac's was not one of
them.
By yesterday the community
had grown in size and pa
tience. Its easy to spot a pro
spective buyer. He usually ap
proaches the scene at a brisk
pace, enters the store and Im
mediately looks behind the
counter and on the news stand.
With no paper in sight he
fizzles to a lethargic crawl
and meekly asks the cashier
whether they have been sold
out. If the response is yes, the
buyer dejectedly walks out of
the store and heads home with
a depressed and, worse yet, un
informed mind.
If the answer is no, his spirit
immediately picks up and he
exits from the store to join the
news-hungry crowd outside. By
noon yesterday there were w
over 30 people aimlessly wan
dering about the Tresidder court

yard. One group of friends had
gathered and their conversation
about why the paper came late
consisted of various theories
and why more copies could not
be reserved if paid for in ad
vance.
One four year old, who had
been engrossed in a chocolate

ice-cream cone, suddenly asked
his father "Daddy, what are we
waiting for?" His father pa
tiently responded, "It won't be
long now Mike, we're just wait
ing for something to read." It
was obvious that Mike consid
ered his time flagrantly mis
used.
