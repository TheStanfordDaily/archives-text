# Two Week Vigil
## News Bureau Ends Surveillance 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Shortly before 2:00 yesterday
afternoon, Spyros Andreopoulo
slowly got up from his desk,
yawned, and walked out of the
Stanford Medical Center News

Bureau, locking the door behind
him.
The News Bureau director
had been at the hospital since
Friday night.
This was the end of more than
two weeks of 12-hour work days
and sleepless nights for the men
and women whose job it had
been to keep the world's press
informed of the ups and downs,
the advances and setbacks, the
triumphs and defeats of Mike
Kasperak, the first adult heart
transplant patient in the United
States.
The long haul began at 4:50
Saturday afternoon, January 6,
when Jane Duff, assistant infor
mation director of the News
Bureau, received a call at home
informing her that a heart
transplant was about to begin.
With Andreopoulo ostensibly
on vacation, she was in charge.
Fifteen minutes later, Mrs.
Duff was in the operating room
where the transplant was being
performed, while her husband
manned the phones at the News
Bureau.
Quickly, the crew was as
sembled, including people
from the Stanford News Serv
ice; Bob Beyers, director of
the News Service; Harry
Press, editor of the Stanford
Observer and also from the
News Service; and Star Car
ter, News Bureau secretary.
And Andreopoulos, who had
just finished a hectic few days
dealing with the press because
of Prof. Arthur Romberg's
DNA-synthesis, found his brief
vacation at a sudden end.
For the first four days after
the transplant, the News Bureau
office was open 24 hours a day,
with the five people sneaking
home whenever they got the
chance to grab a few hours
sleep.
At least one bulletin was re
leased every day, and phone
calls were coming in continually.
Calls were received from Lon
don, Tokyo, Paris, Argentina,
and South Africa.
As the added work load on the
News Bureau and News Service
grew, another employee, Joellyn
Kapp, had to be called back
from her vacation.
But the bulletins kept roll
ing—up to four in one day
late last wee k —a n d the
phones kept ringing, giving
out and asking for informa
tion. The staff kept up with it.
And the reporters appr< ciated
the job they did. Bill Harrison,
veteran science reporter for the
Associated Press, felt that their
work was "excellent, very fine.
I can't fault them on their cov
erage of this at all," and com
pared the News Bureau favor
ably with others he has dealt
with.
Others agreed. Larry Davies,
in charge of the Bay Area for
the New York Times, said "As
far as I can tell, they've been
doing a fine job."
"They're doing a great job,"
concurred a cameraman for

Channel 3 in Sacramento, Earl
Barrett.
"The News Bureau Itself has
been doing an outstanding job,
handing out bulletins as soon as
they can and answering any
questions," he continued, but
said he felt that occasionally the
doctors held up releasing some
items for a short while.
Some of those covering the
heart transplant went so far
as to write letters about the
service they received. Harri
son said he had already sent
a note to Dr. Robert Glaser,
dean of the School of Medi
cine.
Also, Bernie Rausch, KTVU
cameraman and West Coast
representative of the German
press agency Deutsche Presse
Agenture Hamburg told Bob
Beyers yesterday that he plan
ned to send a letter to President
Sterling commending the News
Bureau on its work.
It was a two-way street. Not
only did the press praise the
News Bureau, but its director
was very happy with the con
duct of the press.
Andreopoulos said that he had
been told that "it was a circus
in South Africa" during the two
transplants there. He said his
source had reported that photo
graphers had tried to take pic
tures during the operation on
Dr. Philip Blaiberg, a Capetown
dentist, from an operating room
ampitheater.
Unlike here, there was no se
curity.
He said the reporters con
trolled themselves well, unlike
in South Africa.
There, his source told him,
condition reports were obtained
not from Dr. Christiaan Bar
nard, the surgeon, or Grote
Schuur Hospital, the place
where the operations took place,
but from relatives of the pa
tients.
"The press was bootlegging
the reports," Andreopoulos said.
He was quite satisfied with the
way the coverage was conducted
here.
And very happy to be able
to get a good night's sleep.
