## Bookstore Profits Fall 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ (First of Two Parts 
A major increase in stealing
hit the Bookstore last year. Par
tially because of it, the coopera
tive's profits dropped from
$108,000 to $68,000.
Although the previous rate of
pilferage was rather low, accord
ing to William Kimball, Book
store manager, he has no ex
planation for the sudden in
crease.
Pilferage is covered in the
Bookstore's budget under an
item called "inventory shrink
age." This also includes losses
due to mismarking of items and
ringing up the wrong price (only
ones lower than the correct one
—presumably the customers
catch all overcharges) at the
registers.
But the bulk of the item Is
stealing. And inventory
shrinkage rose from $13,500
to $35,fW0 last year, an in
crease of more than 160 per
cent.
The other major factors caus
ing the decreased profit also
showed large increases, but per
centagewise nowhere near that
of stealing.

Cost of goods sold rose from
70.08 per cent of sales to 70.76
per cent of sales. Salaries and
wages were up by almost $35,-
000, or 12 per cent.
There is always the Inevitable
question, why should the Book
store make any profit at all? A
bit of history is needed to an
swer this.
Founded in 1897 by faculty
and staff, the Bookstore is—le
gally, at any rate —a non-profit
cooperative association run by a
board of directors. The 30 board
members represent all the
schools and departments.
Thus, the Bookstore, being a
nonprofit organization, legally
can't make any money. But it
does, and with the consent of the
Internal Revenue Service.
The reason is that the prof-
Its go for expansion. The
Bookstore pays an amazingly
low rent of $25,000 a year to
the University, but must pro
vide much of the funds for fu
ture facilities.
(This small rent is the reason
the store is able to make a profit
and give discounts at the same
time. A standard rate for use of
a building such as the Bookstore

here would be more on the or
der of $100,000 a year, according
to various surveys that have
been made. The store has a 30-
year lease, which started in
May, 1960.)
Profits are therefore invested
for future use, so nobody really
makes any money out of the
operation. And it is possible that
students will see the store's sur
plus put to work in the not-too
distant future.
According to Kimball, the
Bookstore is quickly running out
of space. The shipping and re
ceiving araus completely inade
quate, storage facilities are min
imal, and the textbook depart
ment is overcrowded.
This hampers efficient opera
tion, the manager says, and pre
vents the store from giving bet
ter service.
"We have always tried to run
the store as if we had a com
petitor across the street," he
claims.
In fact, Kimball would rather
have a "competitor across the
street" than the present monop
oly situation, to ensure the qual
