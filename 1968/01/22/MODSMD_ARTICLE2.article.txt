## Bookstore Profits Fall 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ (First of Two Parts 
A major increase in stealing
hit the Bookstore last year. Par
tially because of it, the coopera
tive's profits dropped from
$108,000 to $68,000.
Although the previous rate of
pilferage was rather low, accord
ing to William Kimball, Book
store manager, he has no ex
planation for the sudden in
crease.
Pilferage is covered in the
Bookstore's budget under an
item called "inventory shrink
age." This also includes losses
due to mismarking of items and
ringing up the wrong price (only
ones lower than the correct one
—presumably the customers
catch all overcharges) at the
registers.
But the bulk of the item Is
stealing. And inventory
shrinkage rose from $13,500
to $35,fW0 last year, an in
crease of more than 160 per
cent.
The other major factors caus
ing the decreased profit also
showed large increases, but per
centagewise nowhere near that
of stealing.

Cost of goods sold rose from
70.08 per cent of sales to 70.76
per cent of sales. Salaries and
wages were up by almost $35,-
000, or 12 per cent.
There is always the Inevitable
question, why should the Book
store make any profit at all? A
bit of history is needed to an
swer this.
Founded in 1897 by faculty
and staff, the Bookstore is—le
gally, at any rate —a non-profit
cooperative association run by a
board of directors. The 30 board
members represent all the
schools and departments.
Thus, the Bookstore, being a
nonprofit organization, legally
can't make any money. But it
does, and with the consent of the
Internal Revenue Service.
The reason is that the prof-
Its go for expansion. The
Bookstore pays an amazingly
low rent of $25,000 a year to
the University, but must pro
vide much of the funds for fu
ture facilities.
(This small rent is the reason
the store is able to make a profit
and give discounts at the same
time. A standard rate for use of
a building such as the Bookstore

here would be more on the or
der of $100,000 a year, according
to various surveys that have
been made. The store has a 30-
year lease, which started in
May, 1960.)
Profits are therefore invested
for future use, so nobody really
makes any money out of the
operation. And it is possible that
students will see the store's sur
plus put to work in the not-too
distant future.
According to Kimball, the
Bookstore is quickly running out
of space. The shipping and re
ceiving araus completely inade
quate, storage facilities are min
imal, and the textbook depart
ment is overcrowded.
This hampers efficient opera
tion, the manager says, and pre
vents the store from giving bet
ter service.
"We have always tried to run
the store as if we had a com
petitor across the street," he
claims.
In fact, Kimball would rather
have a "competitor across the
street" than the present monop
oly situation, to ensure the qual
ity of service is kept high.
"But we're stuck with being a
monopoly, and we can't help
this," he says.
"Students feel the Book
store is gouging them," Kim
ball said. But he feels the stu
dents here are treated excel
lently by the store, in fact, as
well as almost anywhere else.
Every Stanford student is fa
miliar with the eight per cent
discount the Bookstore gives,
slightly easing the overwhelm
ing book-buying burden at the
beginning of each quarter. Only
a handfull of college stores give
any discount to students at all,
according to Kimball.
Then why does all the dissat
isfaction—which leads to the pil
ferage—with the Bookstore ex
ist?
Kimball has his own theories.
"Where it starts," he says, "is
that in our system of American
education all books are provided
free until you hit college. Also,
the percentage of American fam
ilies who are regular book buy
ers is small, so that many stu
dents arrive at college without

really knowing the cost ol
books."
All these factors, he feels,
bring about an attitude which
causes some students to have no
compunctions about stealing
from the store.
What most of the people do
not know, Kimball says, is that
for almost three months—July,
August, and most of September
—the Bookstore runs at a huge
loss.
"But for many students," he
continues, the only time they
see the store is during the
rush," when the money is roll
ing in.
For six months of the year,
the store runs in the red, show
ing large profits only during the
four rush periods. Kimball gives
as a prime example the textbook
department, which operates in
the black only during the busy
seasons, piling up big deficits at
all other times.
Kimball's major concern now
is expansion.

and plans for expansion, and a

store with several others.)

Then why does all the dissat
isfaction—which leads to the pil
ferage—with the Bookstore ex
ist?
Kimball has his own theories.
"Where it starts," he says, "is
that in our system of American
education all books are provided
free until you hit college. Also,
the percentage of American fam
ilies who are regular book buy
ers is small, so that many stu
dents arrive at college without

really knowing the cost ol
books."
All these factors, he feels,
bring about an attitude which
causes some students to have no
compunctions about stealing
from the store.
What most of the people do
not know, Kimball says, is that
for almost three months—July,
August, and most of September
—the Bookstore runs at a huge
loss.
"But for many students," he
continues, the only time they
see the store is during the
rush," when the money is roll
ing in.
For six months of the year,
the store runs in the red, show
ing large profits only during the
four rush periods. Kimball gives
as a prime example the textbook
department, which operates in
the black only during the busy
seasons, piling up big deficits at
all other times.
Kimball's major concern now
is expansion.

and plans for expansion, and a

SHRINKING STOCK — A student examines part of the general
book display at the bookstore, possibly with theft In mind. Stolen
merchandise increased by more than 160 per cent at the store last
year.
A major increase in stealing
hit the Bookstore last year. Par
tially because of it, the coopera
tive's profits dropped from
$108,000 to $68,000.
Although the previous rate of
pilferage was rather low, accord
ing to William Kimball, Book
store manager, he has no ex
planation for the sudden in
crease.
Pilferage is covered in the
Bookstore's budget under an
item called "inventory shrink
age." This also includes losses
due to mismarking of items and
ringing up the wrong price (only
ones lower than the correct one
—presumably the customers
catch all overcharges) at the
registers.
But the bulk of the item Is
stealing. And inventory
shrinkage rose from $13,500
to $35,fW0 last year, an in
crease of more than 160 per
cent.
The other major factors caus
ing the decreased profit also
showed large increases, but per
centagewise nowhere near that
of stealing.

Cost of goods sold rose from
70.08 per cent of sales to 70.76
per cent of sales. Salaries and
wages were up by almost $35,-
000, or 12 per cent.
There is always the Inevitable
question, why should the Book
store make any profit at all? A
bit of history is needed to an
swer this.
Founded in 1897 by faculty
and staff, the Bookstore is—le
gally, at any rate —a non-profit
cooperative association run by a
board of directors. The 30 board
members represent all the
schools and departments.
Thus, the Bookstore, being a
nonprofit organization, legally
can't make any money. But it
does, and with the consent of the
Internal Revenue Service.
The reason is that the prof-
Its go for expansion. The
Bookstore pays an amazingly
low rent of $25,000 a year to
the University, but must pro
vide much of the funds for fu
ture facilities.
(This small rent is the reason
the store is able to make a profit
and give discounts at the same
time. A standard rate for use of
a building such as the Bookstore

here would be more on the or
der of $100,000 a year, according
to various surveys that have
been made. The store has a 30-
year lease, which started in
May, 1960.)
Profits are therefore invested
for future use, so nobody really
makes any money out of the
operation. And it is possible that
students will see the store's sur
plus put to work in the not-too
distant future.
According to Kimball, the
Bookstore is quickly running out
of space. The shipping and re
ceiving araus completely inade
quate, storage facilities are min
imal, and the textbook depart
ment is overcrowded.
This hampers efficient opera
tion, the manager says, and pre
vents the store from giving bet
ter service.
"We have always tried to run
the store as if we had a com
petitor across the street," he
claims.
In fact, Kimball would rather
have a "competitor across the
street" than the present monop
oly situation, to ensure the qual
ity of service is kept high.
"But we're stuck with being a
monopoly, and we can't help
this," he says.
"Students feel the Book
store is gouging them," Kim
ball said. But he feels the stu
dents here are treated excel
lently by the store, in fact, as
well as almost anywhere else.
Every Stanford student is fa
miliar with the eight per cent
discount the Bookstore gives,
slightly easing the overwhelm
ing book-buying burden at the
beginning of each quarter. Only
a handfull of college stores give
any discount to students at all,
according to Kimball.

to various surveys that have
been made. The store has a 30-
year lease, which started in
May, 1960.)
Profits are therefore invested
for future use, so nobody really
makes any money out of the
operation. And it is possible that
students will see the store's sur
plus put to work in the not-too
distant future.
According to Kimball, the
Bookstore is quickly running out
of space. The shipping and re
ceiving araus completely inade
quate, storage facilities are min
imal, and the textbook depart
ment is overcrowded.
This hampers efficient opera
tion, the manager says, and pre
vents the store from giving bet
ter service.
"We have always tried to run
the store as if we had a com
petitor across the street," he
claims.
In fact, Kimball would rather
have a "competitor across the
street" than the present monop
oly situation, to ensure the qual
ity of service is kept high.
"But we're stuck with being a
monopoly, and we can't help
this," he says.
"Students feel the Book
store is gouging them," Kim
ball said. But he feels the stu
dents here are treated excel
lently by the store, in fact, as
well as almost anywhere else.
Every Stanford student is fa
miliar with the eight per cent
discount the Bookstore gives,
slightly easing the overwhelm
ing book-buying burden at the
beginning of each quarter. Only
a handfull of college stores give
any discount to students at all,
according to Kimball.
Then why does all the dissat
isfaction—which leads to the pil
ferage—with the Bookstore ex
ist?
Kimball has his own theories.
"Where it starts," he says, "is
that in our system of American
education all books are provided
free until you hit college. Also,
the percentage of American fam
ilies who are regular book buy
ers is small, so that many stu
dents arrive at college without

really knowing the cost ol
books."
All these factors, he feels,
bring about an attitude which
causes some students to have no
compunctions about stealing
from the store.
What most of the people do
not know, Kimball says, is that
for almost three months—July,
August, and most of September
—the Bookstore runs at a huge
loss.
"But for many students," he
continues, the only time they
see the store is during the
rush," when the money is roll
ing in.
For six months of the year,
the store runs in the red, show
ing large profits only during the
four rush periods. Kimball gives
as a prime example the textbook
department, which operates in
the black only during the busy
seasons, piling up big deficits at
all other times.
Kimball's major concern now
is expansion.

and plans for expansion, and a

store with several others.)


SHRINKING STOCK — A student examines part of the general
book display at the bookstore, possibly with theft In mind. Stolen
merchandise increased by more than 160 per cent at the store last
year.
A major increase in stealing
hit the Bookstore last year. Par
tially because of it, the coopera
tive's profits dropped from
$108,000 to $68,000.
Although the previous rate of
pilferage was rather low, accord
ing to William Kimball, Book
store manager, he has no ex
planation for the sudden in
crease.
Pilferage is covered in the
Bookstore's budget under an
item called "inventory shrink
age." This also includes losses
due to mismarking of items and
ringing up the wrong price (only
ones lower than the correct one
—presumably the customers
catch all overcharges) at the
registers.
But the bulk of the item Is
stealing. And inventory
shrinkage rose from $13,500
to $35,fW0 last year, an in
crease of more than 160 per
cent.
The other major factors caus
ing the decreased profit also
showed large increases, but per
centagewise nowhere near that
of stealing.

Cost of goods sold rose from
70.08 per cent of sales to 70.76
per cent of sales. Salaries and
wages were up by almost $35,-
000, or 12 per cent.
There is always the Inevitable
question, why should the Book
store make any profit at all? A
bit of history is needed to an
swer this.
Founded in 1897 by faculty
and staff, the Bookstore is—le
gally, at any rate —a non-profit
cooperative association run by a
board of directors. The 30 board
members represent all the
schools and departments.
Thus, the Bookstore, being a
nonprofit organization, legally
can't make any money. But it
does, and with the consent of the
Internal Revenue Service.
The reason is that the prof-
Its go for expansion. The
Bookstore pays an amazingly
low rent of $25,000 a year to
the University, but must pro
vide much of the funds for fu
ture facilities.
(This small rent is the reason
the store is able to make a profit
and give discounts at the same
time. A standard rate for use of
a building such as the Bookstore

here would be more on the or
der of $100,000 a year, according
to various surveys that have
been made. The store has a 30-
year lease, which started in
May, 1960.)
