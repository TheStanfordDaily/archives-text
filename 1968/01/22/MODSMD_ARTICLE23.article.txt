# Program Expanded In Group Therapy
## 
### 
The Counseling and Testing
Center is opening a group work
shop program called Project En
counter to all Stanford students
this quarter. During Autumn
Quarter about one hundred

freshmen from Roble and Wil
bur Halls participated in a lim
ited number of the Encounter
groups.
The main purpose of the
groups, according to Dr. John
D. Black, director of the Center,
is to help people bridge more
easily the psychological barriers
that tend to separate human be
ings from each other.
"We hope the members of a
group will become less defen
sive, more aware of their per
sonal feelings about themselves
and others, more perceptive of
the feelings of one another,"
Black commented.
"For most students Stanford
is not really a terribly warm and
supportive community, but it is
reassuring the observe how
much affection and approval
members of these groups can
give one another even though
they are not well acquainted in
the conventional sense," he add
ed.
Black observed that Stanford
is psychologically less warm not
only than it used to be but also
than comparable, present insti
tutions. He pointed out that, not
withstanding the high degree of
competition at Princeton, for ex
ample, there is a stronger sense
of community at that university.
Black emphasized that the En
counter groups are designed for
"ordinary students with their
normal share of hang-ups" al
though the Center does provide
group and individual therapy
for those with special problems.
Most groups meet once a week
for two or three hours, but some
have had week-end sessions or
planned social activities.
Interested students may sign
up on the third floor of the Stu
dent Services Building with Miss
Sue Taylor.
