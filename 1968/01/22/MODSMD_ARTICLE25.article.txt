# Econ Dept. Widens Honors Programs
## 
### 
The Department of Econom
ics has announced a new hon
ors program which will begin
immediately.
Dr. Lorie Tarshis, head of the
department, said the program
will provide "an opportunity for
selected students to design their
own programs after working
closely with a member of the
faculty."
A GPA of 3.0 will be a pre
requisite to admission. The de
partment's intention is to later
provide the program for all
economics majors, but Tarshis
termed this initial program "a
beginning." He added that the
honors program should permit
students to make use of facili
ties in other departments like
sociology, architecture, psychol
ogy, history and public health.
Tarshis* major emphasis was
on the flexibility of the pro
gram.
He stated, "We don't really
want a tailor-made program for
each individual. I would advise
interested students to contact
either Professor E. S. Shaw or
Assistant Professor Bridger
Mitchell as soon as possible. The
program should be initiated in
the student's junior year."
Tarshis commented on the de

partment's outlook today. He
said, "Department rules postu
late the type of student we had
here twelve or fifteen years ago.
With the new breed of students
who are more qualified, moti
vated and interested, I doubt
if our rules make sense."
