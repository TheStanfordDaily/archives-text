# More Essays, Color
## 'Analytic' Quad 
### MARK LITTLE 
This year the '68 Quad is go
ing to be "more than a picture
book," according to Quad editor,
Bruce Howard. "The 'New Look
of the Quad' is going to be more
analytic than pretty or poetic."
Increased from 420 to 540
pages, the Quad will feature
more color pictures and cover
age of the Oakland demonstra
tions and of the subsequent
peace vigil. The yearbook will
have a total of 92 pages of col
ored essay in five divisions.
After the first 32 page essay,
the remaining portion of the
yearbook will be divided into
four section: academics, athlet
ics, activities, and residences.
Highlighted in these areas will
be controversial issues such as
the undergraduate and SES re
ports, the controversial role of
athletics on campus, and the
current debates over the philoso
phy of residence halls.
Answering charges that the
Quad will have a new left
slant, Howard said that year
book will at least be "more
advocative." The 32-page es
say will discuss the motiva
tions of the students to dem
onstrate, and the new changes
on campus which cause stu
dent unrest.
Howard notes that student re
action to mass culture has lead
to an undirected search for per
sonal identity and idealism. The
same idealism which gives Stan
ford the highest percentage of

Peace Corps volunteers of any
University in the country is al#p
responsible for the protests. lA'
New changes on campus cati&
student unrest, Howard stressed.
Stanford's fantastic dependence
on aid from government and ht
dustry have changed the univer
sity's primary emphasis 6h
broad academic background. Ac
cording to a recent report, Thfe
Quality of Education at St&ff
ford, ten of the 24 academic de
partments at Stanford aft
ranked in the top three in tfife
country, but "of these ten, eight
are in the general areas of sA
ence and engineering." i|
The Quad holds that these
departments are being: pulled
up by trading research for
monetary aid. Howard
gests that this aid Is a threat,
to Stanford. "Stanford is
walking on a tightrope in its
attempt to main independency
of coercive forces. It is under (
threat of becoming a t r a d
school rather than a place
where one can get a broad
academic background and too
much money and publicity 1$
being diverted to research." J
Only six pages are devoted to
the Oakland demonstration and
its ensuing activities. However,
the editor, Bruce Howard wss
arrested during the demonstra
tion last October and spent five
days in Santa Rita county jail.
The editor maintains that bitter
ness will not play a part in h&
editorializing.
