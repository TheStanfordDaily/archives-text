# 'We Were Beaten By A Better Team'-Alcindor
## 
### 
HOUSTON (AP) â€” UCLA
Coach John Wooden surveyed
the wreckage of a 47-game win
ning streak and shrugged,
"Well, I guess we'll just have to
start all over again."
"This is the greatest thrill
of my life," Houston Coach Guy
Lewis said Saturday night after
his Cougars had upset the na
tion's top-ranked college basket
ball team 71-69 before a record
crowd of 52,693 in the Astro
dome.
"We were beaten by a better
team," said Lew Anlcindor, the
7-foot-l super star for UCLA,
who refused to use the excuse
of an injured eye for a sub par
performance.
'Greatest'
Elvin Hayes, Houston's 6-
foot-8 Ail-American, and 6 foot-9
Ken Spain combined to put the
defensive clamps on the awe
some Alcindor, Hayes playing
what he called "the greatest
game of my life."
Hayes finished with 39 points,
including 17 of 25 from the field,
15 rebounds and four assists.
Three times he blocked shots by
Alcindor and twice intercepted
passes intended for the UCLA
center.
Alcindor, who missed UCLA's
two previous games because of
an eye injury and got a medical
okay for this one only a couple
of hours before game time, had
only 15 points, including four of
18 from the field and 12 re
bounds.
"Our plan was to keep Alcin
dor bottled up and cut off his
passing lanes to his cornermen,
Lynn Shackleford and Mike
Lynn," Lewis said.
Bruins Shoot 33.6%
That defensive effort plus
Houston's unflappable poise in
the face of UCLA's famed press
and a poor shooting night for
the Bruins told the story. UCLA
hit on only 26 of 77 from the
field, 33.6 per cent, compared
with a season average of 50 per
cent. Houston was 30 of 66.
Houston, ranked No. 2 in the
nation with a 16-0 record going
into the game, bolted in front in
the opening minutes 13-12 and
never trailed again. The Cou
gars led by nine points three
times in the first half and,
sparked by Hayes' 29-point ef

fort, had a 46-43 margin at inter
mission.
They spent most of the last
half fighting off repeated Bruin
threats.
Five times UCLA closed to
within two points and they tied
it three times, the last at 69-69
with only 44 seconds to go on
two free throws by Lucius Allen.
But Hayes, who had been
playing the last 11 minutes with
four fouls, was fouled by Jim
Nielsen with 28 seconds to go
and broke the tie with two free
throws.
Bruins Blow It
Now UCLA trailed by two but
had one last chance to tie it.
The Bruins brought the ball
downcourt -and blew it on an
uncharacteristic mixup on sig
nals. A pass to Schakleford in
the corner was tipped out of
bounds by teammate Mike War
ren. Houston then ran out the
last 12 seconds.
Allen finished with 25 points
for UCLA, Warren had 13 and
Shackleford 10. George Rey
nolds had 13 and Don Chaney 11
for Houston.
OtheT Action
UCLA's defeat by Houston ov
ershadowed all other develop
ments on the college courts Sat
urday night.
Sixth-ranked New Mexico and
seventh-ranked St. Bonaventure
remained unbeaten, but fourth
ranked Tennessee, fifth-ranked
Utah and eighth-ranked Ken
tucky each lost.
New Mexico made it 16
straight by downing Brigham
Young 84-69, and St. Bonaven
ture extended its streak to 13 by
taking Canisius 71-65.
Tennessee fell before Florida
(59-46), Utah was tripped by
Wyoming (81-72) and Kentucky
dropped a 74-73 squeaker to Au
burn on Tom Perry's two free
throws with 36 seconds left.
The defeat kept Adolph Rupp,
Kentucky coach, from equalling
the all-time career victory
record of 771 held by the retired
Phog Allen of Kansas.
Columbia, lOth-ranked, routed
Cornell 93-51. Third-ranked
North Carolina and ninth
ranked Vanderbilt did not play.

Francis, Pa., toppled St. Peters
of New Jersey from the un
