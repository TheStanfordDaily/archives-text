# 25% Dissent
## ROTC Cadets Question War 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Approximately 25 per cent of
the students enrolled in Stan
ford's Army ROTC program do
not support the U.S. presence
in Vietnam, according to a stu
dent poll taken during Novem
ber.
Among those students who
support U.S. involvement, better
than half indicated that they
support policy changes "in the
direction of increased U.S. pres
sure ... in order to force the
Viet Cong to negotiate."
Almost two-thirds of the
Army ROTC program's 352 ca
dets responded to the survey,
which apparently is the first
polling to be conducted on the
West Coast of ROTC student
opinion on the Vietnam war.
Although the survey was dis
tributed in ROTC classes, the
Department of Military Science
did not officially sanction it. The
Stanford Company of the Asso
ciation of the United States
Army, which finances The Ex
plorer's publication costs, also
is not under Army control.
Richard Harris, a senior who
originated the idea for the stu
dent poll, said that he became
interested following the demon
strations at the Oakland Induc
tion Center, what were the ca
dets' opinions with a "vocal pro
dominance of anti-war and anti
military feelings on the Stan
ford campus."
"The purpose was to point
out to cadets whether their
rationalizations are strong
enough to keep them in the
program or have them drop
out," Harris added.
Since better than half of the
students in the first two years
of the program come from five
surrounding junior colleges, it
is difficult to ascertain from the
survey if the opinions of Stan
ford freshmen differ significant
ly from those of the seniors in
volved in the program.

However, among those sen
iors polled, one-third of them
stated that they didn't support
U.S. involvement.
Four of the senior cadets, or
more than 10 per cent of the
33 seniors responding to the
questionaire, indicated that they
could not reconcile their enroll
ment in ROTC with Vietnam.
This number equals those ca
dets in the other three years
combined who oppose the war
but can not justify the "moral
inconsistency" of their contin
ued enrollment.
Those cadets who feel they
can reconcile continued enroll
ment list a variety of reasons.
Approximately half of the dis
senting cadets stated that "per
sonal practical reasons out
weigh moral considerations."
One senior observed that "going
to jail hinders my goals in life."
Other students felt that
there is no inconsistency in
volved. One senior with this
position felt he could serve
and "at the same time be in
conjunction with my moral
feelings. Serving two years In
the Army does not mean I
support the war in Vietnam."
Col. David Y. Nanney, profes
sor of military science for the

Stanford Army ROTC program,
seemed to agree with this posi
tion when asked for his reaction
to the overall results of the poll
by The Explorer.
"A person's attitude on Viet
nam should not determine
whether he will be a good or
bad officer. It is the general
principle that is important,"
Col. Nanney said.
One cadet said, "Th re are
those who don't take that strict
a course." He pointed out that
one could usp this position to
areue for pa vine: taxes, even
though one mipht not supnort
the Vietnam war. "And vet," he
added, are people who
aren't pavinf? their taxes."
Other cadets stated that
thev cannot justify enroll
ment, but they are "remain
ing in because of the tremen
dous difficulties and discom
fort involved in getting out."
One senior with this position
said, "I was at Oakland, I am in
ROTC, I will probablv end up in
Vietnam. What a shame."
Students in the first two
years of the program may drop
out any time. However, those
students in the third and fourth
year of the program have
signed a contract with the See

retary of the Army which re
quires that they serve two years
of active duty as a commis
sioned officer upon graduation.
Although the procedure that a
student must go through to
drop at this point is somewhat
complicated, apparently no Stan
ford student has b en drafted
as a result.
According to Maj. Robert
Siderius, the Army ROTC infor
mation officer, four or five of
the advanced students drop out
of the program each year. Two
students who dropped out last
spring listed as th ir personal
reason their position on Vi t
nam.
One student who dropped out
of the program after his fresh
man year admitted that his de
cision was based in part on his
opposition to U.S. presence in
Vietnam.
"But it is really hard to say
whether it was more anti-Viet
nam or anti-military establish
ment," he said.
"And, too, when I first came
to Stanford, I wasn't sure
that there would be any more
deferments. ROTC seemed to
be the best way to insure that
I could stay in school. But the
longer I was in the program,
the more I became cynical."
Over 85 per cent of the stu
dents in the program stated that
they felt enrollment in ROTC
did not restrict the opinions
they "voice in regards to such
issues as Vietnam and Oakland."
Supporting this feeling Col.
Nanney said, "The Army does
not feel comfortable unless both
sides are stated."
When one student was asked
about his reaction to the poll,
he stated, "I was surprised that
there wasn't more opposition
within ROTC."
He added, however that those
students who hold opposing
opinions "just don't express
their views around ROTC."
