West roared from behind with
three fourth-quarter touchdowns
and defeated the East 38-20 in

Pro Bowl All-Star Game Sun
day.
Unitas, Gabriel
A crowd of 53,289 saw quarter

sunny, 80-degree weather at the
Memorial Colisuem.
Chicago's Richie Petitbon re
turned an interception 70 yards
for one TD and th n Bill Brown
of Minnesota ran 19 yards for
another as the West came back.
Gale Sayers' three-yard touch
down plunge after a recovered
fumble started the fourth quar
ter rally.
Short Punts
The West's first two scores
came as a result of short punts
by Dallas flanker Bob Hayes.
The first traveled only six yards
and the second 14. Each time
the West converted quickly, the
first touchdown coming on Les
Josephson's four-yard run and
the second on a 39-yard pass
from Gabriel to Detroit's Mel
Farr, who caught the ball on
his fingertips while flying in the
end zone.

Frank Tarkenton of the New

York Giants divided quarter
back duties for the East.

East its temporary 20-17 lead
while scrambling Tarkenton
was the victim of the pass inter
ception by Petitbon whose 70
yard return was a Pro Bowl
record.

Bay Packers kicked a 26-yard
field goal and handled the punt
ing with a creditable 41-yard av
