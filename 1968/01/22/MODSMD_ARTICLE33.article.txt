JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP)
—Quarterback Joe Namath of
the New York Jets, erratic for
three quarters, capped a come
back with a one-yard touchdown
plunge that gave the East a 25-
24 victory over the West in the
American Football League All-
Star game Sunday.
The New York passing whiz
tossed a 24-yard touchdown pass
to Jet teammate Don Maynard
with six minutes to play and
gave the East an upset triumph
with his scoring leap with 58
seconds to play.
Chargers' Duncan Stars
Namath's heroics, after a dis
mal start in the nationally tele
vised game that attract'd a
record crowd of 38,500, offset
the defensive brilliance of Les
Duncan, San Diego cornerback.
Duncan darted 90 yards with
a kickoff return on the longest
scoring play in the history of
the AFL All-Star gam > and tied
a game record by intercepting
two passes.
Lamonica Builds Lead
Quarterback Daryle Lamonica
of the Oakland Raiders tossed
a pair of touchdown passes for
the West in the first half and
pushed the favorites to a 21-13
lead. Len Dawson of the Kan
sas City Chiefs guided the West
through the second half wh n
the East pulled away.
The West had a chance with
six seconds left, but veteran
George Blanda's 35-yard field
goal attempt was wide, leaving

the East on top for only the sec
ond time in the seven-year his
tory of the battle in which the
winners pocketed $1,000 and the
losers $500 each.
Three Interceptions
Namath had three passes in
tercepted in the first half, but
he kept the East in contention
with a 35-yard touchdown strike
to New York teammate Pete
Lammons. Buffalo's Mike Mer
cer kicked field goals of 10 and
33 yards for the East.
Neither team scored in the
third quarter, and Blanda gave
the West what appeared to be
th.? winning margin when he

booted a 28-yard field goal at
the start of the final period.
But Namath teamed up with
Maynard—who caught a record
nine passes in the game—and
sent the East to its comeback
conquest.
Lamonica threw a three-yard
scoring pass to Willie Frazier of
San Diego and hit Lance Al
worth of San Diego with a nine
yard touchdown strike.
Namath and Maynard shared
the awards as the game's top of
fensive player, and Duncan was
selected by sportswriters and
broadcasters as the defensive
standout.
