# BOXING
## Moffett TKO 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Stanford boxers were victor
ious in two of five bouts in Fri
day night's opening meet
against the University of Cali
fornia.
However, since one of the
victories was won by Stanford
freshman, Brant Bassett, and
did no count in the official meet
scoring, and because Stanford
forfeited matches in five di
visions, the official tally was 8-1
California.
Lunny Pleased
But for an opening meet, for a
team riddled by the loss of five
members before the season ever
began, the two victories were
sweet, and Coach Ray Lunny
was pleased with the perform
ances of all five men who boxed.
"I was worried about the over
all team conditioning, but was
very pleased and proud of the
performances of all the boxers.
With another meet or so under
us, It should be a good squad."
In the opening bout of the
evening, Stanford's George Mc-
Fall dropped a three-round de
cision to Cal's Jim Cowart. Mc-
Fall, in his first Varsity compe
tition, tired visibly at the end,
and his stronger opponent was
awarded a unanmious decision.
Frosh Scores Victory
In the big surprise of the
card, Stanford Freshman Brant
Bassett led all the way to defeat
Cal's Dan Burnstein in the 139
pound class.
Bassett surprised his more
experienced opponent with a
first round flurry of punches,

and scored a second round
knockdown to clinch the unani
mous decision at the end of the
three rounds.
At 156 pounds, Stanford's
Barney Adler was defeated by
Bill Holmes of the visiting
Bears. Adler gave away several
inches in height and reach to
Holmes, but battled his oppon
ent all the way in the swinging
three-rounder.
A close decision awarded the
match to Holmes, but Coach
Lunny commented that the fight
was one of Adler's finest at
Stanford.
In the 165 pound bout, Cal's
Ray Koch stopped Lander Car
ter of Stanford with 15 seconds
to go in the last round.
Carter and Koch were even at
the end of the first round, but
Koch, taking advantage of sev
eral boxing errors of Carter,
scored a convincing knockdown
in the second round.
MofTet TKO
The highlight of the evening
for Stanford came in the heavy
weight bout between Stanford's
Gene Moffett and Webb Lloyd
of Cal.
Moffett swarmed all over
Lloyd from the beginning, scor
ing well with both rights and
lefts.
The 6-4, 225 pound Moffet dis
played poise and boxing style
uncommon to Stanford heavy
weights, and his punching
power ended the bout halfway
through the second round.
The next meet for Stanford is
scheduled for February 17,
against Chico State College.
