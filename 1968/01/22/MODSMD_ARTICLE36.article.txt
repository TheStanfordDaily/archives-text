## Frosh Records Tumble, Tribe Romps To 3 Wins 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford swimmers went on a
binge against the North last
weekend, knocking off Oregon.
State 72-32 and Oregon 75-36.
John Ferris blasted his week-old
NCAA freshman record in the
200 fly while the Papooses muti
lated the Stanford freshman rec
ord board in a 78-27 victory over
Arden Hills.
Ferris packed 200 yards of but
terfly into 1:51.9, a full second
faster than his record jaunt of
last week. The NCAA record is
1:51.7.
Butterfllers Fly
It was a good weekend for
Stanford butterfliers. Pete Sie
bert hit 1:56.9 against Oregon
and Luis Nicolao threw in a
1:57.5 against OSU to tie down
the top two spots in the current
college listings.
Varsity Captain Bob Momsen
bubbled to a 2:15.6 200 breast
stroke, the second fastest of the
season. Momsen hit 1:01.9 for
the breaststroke leg of a medley
relay and also won a 500 free
style in 4:55.4.
Tom Jamison sparked the
Oregon State meet, winning
both 50 and 100 freestyles and
leading off the free relay with
a personal best of 49.1. Jeff Ham
mett continues to drop his sprint
times, anchoring Stanford's fast

est medley relay this season
(3:39.3) in a swift 48.1.
The frosh made their medley
relay a tough act to follow. The
Papooses whipped off a 3:34.9
for the combination event, faster
than any college varsity so far
this year.
Fred Haywood led off the med
ley with a 53.9 backstroke leg,
good for a new pool and fresh
man record. Kenn Terry kept up
the pace with a 1:02.3 breast
stroke leg, his best. Ferris
plowed up a 50.9 butterfly and
Bob Jamison put the icing on
the cake with a 47.8 freestyle.
Haywood later in the meet
broke the Stanford freshman
record with a 4:56.1 effort in the
500 freestyle.
Brent Berk chopped 12 seconds
off his freshman record in the
1000 freestyle, finishing the dis
tance event in a brisk 10:17.2.
Berk won the 200 free against
Arden Hills in 1:47.6, edging
teammate Jamie Knorr's 1:48.3.
Roth's Record Falls
Mitch Ivey, who watched Hay
wood snatch away his pool rec
ord in the 100 backstroke, sought
greener pastures. Ivey left Dick
Roth's 200 backstroke pool and
freshman records in the lurch
with a 1:58.7 performance.
Tag Leonard and Kenn Terry
couldn't decide who would have
the privilege of breaking Bob
Momsen's freshman 200 breast

stroke record. So the Tag 'n'
Terry duo wound up in a dead
heat at 2:19.5, half a second un
der Momsen's three-year old
standard.
The two Oregon teams left the
Indians the chance to do some
fiddling with the line-up. Dis
tance freestyler Mike Wall
swam the 200 backstroke in a
respectable 2:08.6, and back
stroker Bill Kee handled the 200
butterfly in a more-than-respect
able 2:04.3.
Weary Hammer
For comic relief, sprint spe
cialist Ken Hammer was sen
tenced to 1000 yards of hard la
bor. The 'comic' was perhaps
esoteric, but the relief was ever
so genuine. "Never again,"
quoth a weary Hammer after 11
minutes and 39 flip turns.
Stanford Relays Next
The Indians face Foothill
Aquatic Club here, Friday at
3:00 p.m. Saturday at 2 p.m.,
the Cards square off against the
always-awesome Santa Clara
Swim Club and the revenge
seeking Stanford frosh in the
annual Stanford Relays.
Santa Clara, with Stanford
NCAA ace Greg Buckingham,
multiple world record holder
Mark Spitz, Olympian Gary ll
man, former NCAA sprint
champ Don Roth, and Santa
Clara high school's fleet, should
make things interesting.
