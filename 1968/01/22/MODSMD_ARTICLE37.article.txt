## Evans, Nye Lead Convincing Victory Over Outclassed OSU 
### DAVE NOLAND 
The Stanford Rugby team
rolled to their second straight
victory as they buried a dogged
Oregan State squad 21-3.
Led by Dave Evans' three tries
and tower of strength Blaine
Nye, the Cards dominated the
entire game. The Beavers rarely
were able to get out of their
own half of the field.
Stanford's Eric Sutcliffe
opened the scoring with a 25-
yard try ("touchdown") after
taking a pass from Ray Wilson.
Leon Hartvickson converted, and
the scoreboard read 5-0.
Both defenses then tightened,
and the half ended with no fur
ther scoring.
Stanford struck quickly in the
second period. Jon Huss scam
pered for a long run through
the OSU backs, was tackled
just short of the goal line, and
Jack Alustisa pounced on the
ball for three points. Hartvick
son converted from a difficult
single, and the Tribe led 10-0.
Evans Hat Trick
But the show wasn't over yet.
Team captain and scrum half
David Evans broke through for
three consecutive tries of 15,
20, and 30 yards. Evans' last
effort, was dead conter be
tween the posts, and Bill Thomp
son easily converted to com
plete the Stanford scoring.
Oregon State's lone score

came when an alert Beaver
fell on the ball just over the
goal line as the ball came out of
a loose scrum.
A major factor in the Tribe's
decisive victory was the play of
forward Blaine Nye, hooker
Robbie Nero and Australian
fullback Mike Forester.
Nye Tough
Nye, 6-5 and 240, totally dom
inated the line-outs with clean
grabs and quick, accurate pass
outs.

Nero's hooking made it even
tougher for the Beavers to get
the ball. And Forester's accurate
kicking into touch made sure
that when they did get it, they
had their backs to the wall.
Big One Next
Coach Pete Kmetovic is now
looking to next Saturday for
the big match of the season,
against Church College of
Hawaii. The Islanders are gen
erally regarded as the best col
legiate rugby team in the nation.
