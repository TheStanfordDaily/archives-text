## Red Tiles Reduce Danger 
### HANK LIESE 
When people get bored with
the usual objects of dissent,
which, contrary to common b?-
lief, is possible in an intellectual
community, they sometimes at
tack the most inane conditions
in their environment.
And when Stanford students
tire of their normal sources of
complaint, their wrath periodic
ally falls on one of th? Uni
versity's most cherished trade
marks and landscape features,
its red tile roofs.
Many questions concerning
both the abundance and safety
of these tile roofs have be n
raised in the past. It is time to
end the controversy, for a rec
ent academic survey has shown
red tiles unsurpassed in reduc
ing hidden dangers of roofs.
In 1893, Mrs. Jane Stanford
hired a group of contractors to
help design and build a Uni
versity, which was to be called
the Leland Stanford Junior Uni
versity.
When Stanford's first build
ings, now Inner Quad, were
built in the 1880's, they were
crowned with red tile in keep
ing with California's Spanish
architectural tradition.
As chance would have It,
Outer Quad followed suit with
the red tile, and likewise En
cina and Roble Halls. Red
tiles were here to stay.
Recent buildings, th? new un
dergraduate library, for exam
ple, have been topped with red
tile. Why? Because people—
among them the Board of Trus
tees, through whom all building
designs must pass for approval
—feel that red tile roofs are
a part of Stanford.
At least one old woman actu
ally complained to the planning
office when Stern Hall was com
pleted, since the dormitory com
plex is the only large resid nee
built without red tile roofs.

The red tiles seem to be
loosely fastened. Those on the
Meyer Library can be lifted by
hand. Many suspct that during
an earthquake Stanford's roofs
might start slinging tile.
Up to this time, however,
there have been no recorded in
stances of death or injury from
flying tile.
Each tile, which is set on a
base of tar paper and metal
strips, is securely fastened to
the roof with a piece of copper
wire, according to Royal H.
Tyson, principal planner for
Stanford.
In addition, Fire Marshall
John M. Marston stated that
the fire department likes any
kind of roof that doesn't burn.
Tile doesn't burn.
Says Marston, "The major

contributing factor in all con
flagrations has been combustible
roofs."
Tyson says that although the
initial cost of tile is greater than
other roofing — for example,
slate or shingles—the mainten
ance costs of tile are far less
than these other types.
It appears that complaints
will have to be refocused on
more traditional sources, for as
an architectural motif, the
Farm's red tile roofs are likely
to endure.
