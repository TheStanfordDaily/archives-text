# Transplant Patient Dies After Massive Bleeding
## 
### PAT MCMAHON 
Stanford heart transplant pa
tient Mike Kasperak died early
yesterday morning from a "gal
axy of complications" following
his intial surgery 15 days before,
said Dr. Norman E. Shumway,
who performed the historic op
eration.
Death came to the retired
steelworker, America's first adult
transplant patient, at 1:43 a.m
Sunday, Dr. Shumway at his side
in the Stanford Medical Center.
Kasperak, the fourth per
son In history to receive a new
heart, was in no pain, Shum
way asserted. It was reported
that Mrs. Kasperak, also a car
diac patient, was informed of
her husband's death by Dr.
Shumway.

She remains "In seclusion"
at the advice of her physician.
Meanwhile, in South Africa,
Dr. Christian Barnard reported
that his patient, Philip Blaiberg
of Cane Town, is "up and about
and showing no rejection clini
ca'ly" of his new heart.
Tired and seemingly dejocted,
Shumway told the news confer
ence, "We don't have enough in
formation at this time to decide
precisely whether there has been
any element of success in the
venture."
For Kasperak, he said, "ob
viously there was no success."
Shumway said, however, the
observations made could be "of
tremendous importance to oth
er possible recipients and to
the medical community as
well.

"Mr. Kasperak, as you know,
was a terminal patient who had
only 15 days life after heart
transplantation, but what should
be emphasized is that during this
time he survived a fantastic gal
axy of complications which we
have seen before in other kinds
of cardiac patients, but never in
such profusion.
"We think that because of his
normal cardiac action, he was
able to survive first of all renal
[kidney] failure, then heaptic or
liver failure, and then following
this three major operations all
of which were done during the
time that his circulation was
moved by the transplanted
heart."
"... We feel that any one of
these complications would have
been lethal had it not been for

the cardiac transplant."
Shumway said the turning
point toward death came "with
the massive hemorrage from
the stomach, which required
two operations."
More transplants for the Stan
ford team? "A provisional yes"
from Shumway, "depending en
tirely still on the findings of post
mortem examination on Mr. Kas
perak."
He said that if careful investi
gation reveals no rejection of the
heart, "we have every basis upon
which to plan another clinical at
tempt."
The husband of the heart don
or, Charles White, said in a
statement issued at the news con
ference, "My deepest sympathy
goes out to Mrs. Kasperak, and
I know she understands just
how great a contribution her
husband has made.
"If this heart transplant is go
ing to help someone in the fu
ture — many people in the fu
ture — then what Dr. Shumway
and the other doctors have learn
ed wiH eventually save many
lives.
'T am grateful to God that
Virginia and Mr. Kasperak
both were able to contribute to
this."
Mrs. White suffered a massive
brain hemorrhage and died just
two hours before the transplant
operation began. A kidney was
also transplanted from Mrs.
White into a Nevada woman,
whose body later rejected the
organ.
Kasperak's condition following
the transplant was "satisfactory,
but considered critical." Two
days later, he suffered bleeding
from the stomach and intestines,
which was stopped with the aid
of fresh blood transfusions, and
liver and kidney failure.
His condition improved
through the week except for bis
liver condition, which continued
to worsen. By Saturday, one
week after the historic opera
tion, hemorrhaging had devel
oped and on Sunday doctors re
moved his gall bladder.
Kasperak progressed well ear
ly last week. He sat up, walked
across his intensive care unit,
sat in a chair, and was visited
regularly by his wife, Ferne.
The transplanted heart func
tloned well, although Kasper
ak's general condition began
to worsen again at the end ot
the week.
Thursday night, surgery was
again required to halt bleeding
from his duodenum. And within
20 hours, another operation was
needed to halt continued bleed
ing.
By Saturday, two weeks alter
the initial operation, Kasperajc
was near death. Medical bulle
tins called his condition "extre«
mely critical," and said that
there was "bleeding internally
throughout his body."
And early yesterday morning
Mike Kasperak succumbed to the
ailments that had wracked his
body since the operation.
In London, The Associated
Press reported that Dr. Donald
Ross of the National Heart
Hospital in London expressed
amazement that Kasperak
lived as long as he did.
"It is not surprising that Mr.
Kasperak has died," said Dr.
Ross, "but I am amazed that
they have been able to keep him
alive so long."
He declined to make detailed
comment, but said that the in
ternal bleeding alone would ac
count for his death, as it does
for many other deaths follow
ing open heart surgery.
The Stanford University medi
cal team which performed the
heart transplant operation stres
sed the need today for better
physical evaluation of potential
transplant patients.
"The severely ill and the com
atose are the patients with
whom we must work," Dr.
Shumway told the JAMA.
"But there may very well be
a level of organ function below
which we should not perform
such an operation," said Shum
way. "We do not yet know, how
ever, what the level might be."
"The reason that complica
tions did not clear quickly in
this patient Kasperak," Dr.
Shumway said, "as they did
in those of Dr. Christiaan Bar
nard in South Africa, is due, I
believe, to the advanced chron
ic state of these complication
in our patient."

viously there was no success."
Shumway said, however, the
observations made could be "of
tremendous importance to oth
er possible recipients and to
the medical community as
well.

"Mr. Kasperak, as you know,
was a terminal patient who had
only 15 days life after heart
transplantation, but what should
be emphasized is that during this
time he survived a fantastic gal
axy of complications which we
have seen before in other kinds
of cardiac patients, but never in
such profusion.
"We think that because of his
normal cardiac action, he was
able to survive first of all renal
[kidney] failure, then heaptic or
liver failure, and then following
this three major operations all
of which were done during the
time that his circulation was
moved by the transplanted
heart."
"... We feel that any one of
these complications would have
been lethal had it not been for

the cardiac transplant."
Shumway said the turning
point toward death came "with
the massive hemorrage from
the stomach, which required
two operations."
More transplants for the Stan
ford team? "A provisional yes"
from Shumway, "depending en
tirely still on the findings of post
mortem examination on Mr. Kas
perak."
He said that if careful investi
gation reveals no rejection of the
heart, "we have every basis upon
which to plan another clinical at
tempt."
The husband of the heart don
or, Charles White, said in a
statement issued at the news con
ference, "My deepest sympathy
goes out to Mrs. Kasperak, and
I know she understands just
how great a contribution her
husband has made.
"If this heart transplant is go
ing to help someone in the fu
ture — many people in the fu
ture — then what Dr. Shumway
and the other doctors have learn
ed wiH eventually save many
lives.
'T am grateful to God that
Virginia and Mr. Kasperak
both were able to contribute to
this."
Mrs. White suffered a massive
brain hemorrhage and died just
two hours before the transplant
operation began. A kidney was
also transplanted from Mrs.
White into a Nevada woman,
whose body later rejected the
organ.
Kasperak's condition following
the transplant was "satisfactory,
but considered critical." Two
days later, he suffered bleeding
from the stomach and intestines,
which was stopped with the aid
of fresh blood transfusions, and
liver and kidney failure.
His condition improved
through the week except for bis
liver condition, which continued
to worsen. By Saturday, one
week after the historic opera
tion, hemorrhaging had devel
oped and on Sunday doctors re
moved his gall bladder.
Kasperak progressed well ear
ly last week. He sat up, walked
across his intensive care unit,
sat in a chair, and was visited
regularly by his wife, Ferne.
The transplanted heart func
tloned well, although Kasper
ak's general condition began
to worsen again at the end ot
the week.
Thursday night, surgery was
again required to halt bleeding
from his duodenum. And within
20 hours, another operation was
needed to halt continued bleed
ing.
By Saturday, two weeks alter
the initial operation, Kasperajc
was near death. Medical bulle
tins called his condition "extre«
mely critical," and said that
there was "bleeding internally
throughout his body."
And early yesterday morning
Mike Kasperak succumbed to the
ailments that had wracked his
body since the operation.
In London, The Associated
Press reported that Dr. Donald
Ross of the National Heart
Hospital in London expressed
amazement that Kasperak
lived as long as he did.
"It is not surprising that Mr.
Kasperak has died," said Dr.
Ross, "but I am amazed that
they have been able to keep him
alive so long."
He declined to make detailed
comment, but said that the in
ternal bleeding alone would ac
count for his death, as it does
for many other deaths follow
ing open heart surgery.
The Stanford University medi
cal team which performed the
heart transplant operation stres
sed the need today for better
physical evaluation of potential
transplant patients.
"The severely ill and the com
atose are the patients with
whom we must work," Dr.
Shumway told the JAMA.
"But there may very well be
a level of organ function below
which we should not perform
such an operation," said Shum
way. "We do not yet know, how
ever, what the level might be."
"The reason that complica
tions did not clear quickly in
this patient Kasperak," Dr.
Shumway said, "as they did
in those of Dr. Christiaan Bar
nard in South Africa, is due, I
believe, to the advanced chron
ic state of these complication
in our patient."
Stanford heart transplant pa

yesterday morning from a "gal

his intial surgery 15 days before,
said Dr. Norman E. Shumway,
who performed the historic op

Death came to the retired
steelworker, America's first adult
transplant patient, at 1:43 a.m
Sunday, Dr. Shumway at his side
in the Stanford Medical Center.
Kasperak, the fourth per
son In history to receive a new
heart, was in no pain, Shum
way asserted. It was reported
that Mrs. Kasperak, also a car
diac patient, was informed of
her husband's death by Dr.
Shumway.

She remains "In seclusion"
at the advice of her physician.
Meanwhile, in South Africa,
Dr. Christian Barnard reported
that his patient, Philip Blaiberg
of Cane Town, is "up and about
and showing no rejection clini
ca'ly" of his new heart.
Tired and seemingly dejocted,
Shumway told the news confer

any element of success in the

gation reveals no rejection of the
heart, "we have every basis upon
which to plan another clinical at
tempt."
The husband of the heart don
or, Charles White, said in a
statement issued at the news con
ference, "My deepest sympathy
goes out to Mrs. Kasperak, and
I know she understands just
how great a contribution her
husband has made.
"If this heart transplant is go
ing to help someone in the fu
ture — many people in the fu
ture — then what Dr. Shumway
and the other doctors have learn
ed wiH eventually save many
lives.
'T am grateful to God that
Virginia and Mr. Kasperak
both were able to contribute to
this."
Mrs. White suffered a massive
brain hemorrhage and died just
two hours before the transplant
operation began. A kidney was
also transplanted from Mrs.
White into a Nevada woman,
whose body later rejected the
organ.
Kasperak's condition following
the transplant was "satisfactory,
but considered critical." Two
days later, he suffered bleeding
from the stomach and intestines,
which was stopped with the aid
of fresh blood transfusions, and
liver and kidney failure.
His condition improved
through the week except for bis
liver condition, which continued
to worsen. By Saturday, one
week after the historic opera
tion, hemorrhaging had devel
oped and on Sunday doctors re
moved his gall bladder.
Kasperak progressed well ear
ly last week. He sat up, walked
across his intensive care unit,
sat in a chair, and was visited
regularly by his wife, Ferne.
The transplanted heart func
tloned well, although Kasper
ak's general condition began
to worsen again at the end ot
the week.
Thursday night, surgery was
again required to halt bleeding
from his duodenum. And within
20 hours, another operation was
needed to halt continued bleed
ing.
By Saturday, two weeks alter
the initial operation, Kasperajc
was near death. Medical bulle
tins called his condition "extre«
mely critical," and said that
there was "bleeding internally
throughout his body."
And early yesterday morning
Mike Kasperak succumbed to the
ailments that had wracked his
body since the operation.
In London, The Associated
Press reported that Dr. Donald
Ross of the National Heart
Hospital in London expressed
amazement that Kasperak
lived as long as he did.
"It is not surprising that Mr.
Kasperak has died," said Dr.
Ross, "but I am amazed that
they have been able to keep him
alive so long."
He declined to make detailed
comment, but said that the in
ternal bleeding alone would ac
count for his death, as it does
for many other deaths follow
ing open heart surgery.
The Stanford University medi
cal team which performed the
heart transplant operation stres
sed the need today for better
physical evaluation of potential
transplant patients.
"The severely ill and the com
atose are the patients with
whom we must work," Dr.
Shumway told the JAMA.
"But there may very well be
a level of organ function below
which we should not perform
such an operation," said Shum
way. "We do not yet know, how
ever, what the level might be."
"The reason that complica
tions did not clear quickly in
this patient Kasperak," Dr.
Shumway said, "as they did
in those of Dr. Christiaan Bar
nard in South Africa, is due, I
believe, to the advanced chron
ic state of these complication
in our patient."
Stanford heart transplant pa
tient Mike Kasperak died early
yesterday morning from a "gal
axy of complications" following
his intial surgery 15 days before,
said Dr. Norman E. Shumway,
who performed the historic op
eration.
Death came to the retired
steelworker, America's first adult
transplant patient, at 1:43 a.m
Sunday, Dr. Shumway at his side
in the Stanford Medical Center.
Kasperak, the fourth per
son In history to receive a new
heart, was in no pain, Shum
way asserted. It was reported
that Mrs. Kasperak, also a car
diac patient, was informed of
her husband's death by Dr.
Shumway.

She remains "In seclusion"
at the advice of her physician.
Meanwhile, in South Africa,
Dr. Christian Barnard reported
that his patient, Philip Blaiberg
of Cane Town, is "up and about
and showing no rejection clini
ca'ly" of his new heart.
Tired and seemingly dejocted,
Shumway told the news confer
ence, "We don't have enough in
formation at this time to decide
precisely whether there has been
any element of success in the
venture."
For Kasperak, he said, "ob
viously there was no success."
Shumway said, however, the
observations made could be "of
tremendous importance to oth
er possible recipients and to
the medical community as
well.

"Mr. Kasperak, as you know,
was a terminal patient who had
only 15 days life after heart
transplantation, but what should
be emphasized is that during this
time he survived a fantastic gal
axy of complications which we
have seen before in other kinds
of cardiac patients, but never in
such profusion.
"We think that because of his
normal cardiac action, he was
able to survive first of all renal
[kidney] failure, then heaptic or
liver failure, and then following
this three major operations all
of which were done during the
time that his circulation was
moved by the transplanted
heart."
"... We feel that any one of
these complications would have
been lethal had it not been for

the cardiac transplant."
Shumway said the turning
point toward death came "with
the massive hemorrage from
the stomach, which required
two operations."
More transplants for the Stan
ford team? "A provisional yes"
from Shumway, "depending en
tirely still on the findings of post
mortem examination on Mr. Kas
perak."
He said that if careful investi
gation reveals no rejection of the
heart, "we have every basis upon
which to plan another clinical at
tempt."
The husband of the heart don
or, Charles White, said in a
statement issued at the news con
