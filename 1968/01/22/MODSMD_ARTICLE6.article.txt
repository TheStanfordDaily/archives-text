# New Draft Rules Seen, 'Prime Group' Likely
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
University officials expect the
government to announce new
draft rules this week which will
re'ieve some of the uncertainty
about graduate school enroll
ment.
President Johnson will specify
a "prime age group," these sour
ces predict, which will lump to
gether all 19-yoar-old non-stu
dents with graduate students and
seniors who will lose their 11-S
deferments in June.
Out of this pool, local draft
boards will be instructed to draft
men according to birth date—
starting with those bom Jan. 1,
and continuing until each board's
draft qrota is filled.
This means men born in Jan
uary would have the greatest
chance of being drafted, and
those born in December have the
least.
According to estimates by
the Scienctific Manpower Com
mission, up to 50 per cent of
able-bodied seniors and first
year graduate students could
be inducted.
On Friday the Pentagon an
nounced a 1968 draft call of 302,-
000 men, smaller than some ob
servers had predicted but 72,000
larger than last year's.
George Maslach, dean of Ber
keley's college of engineering,
told The Daily yesterday he ex

pects the Administration to an
nounce the new prime age group
this week. Maslach is chairman
of a Commerce department ad
visory panel on the draft.
"We agreed upon this recom
mendation," Maslach said of the
birth-dat- 1 formula. He points
out that the 1967 law requires
the President "draft the oldest
first, with no lottery."
If President Johnson didn't
modify the draft as much
as the law permits, the older
graduate students and seniors
would be taken before any 19-
year-olds, since the 1967 law pro
vided for a of the 11-S
deferment for graduate study.
The law continued deferments
"for one academic year only" for
"any registrant enrolled in his
first year of postgraduate study
on Oct. 1, 1967." Students enroll
ed in their second year of grad
uate study on that date w*re
allowed deferment until they re
ceived a degree. Deferment of
medical students was continued,
and all undergraduates were
guaranteed a 11-S deferment as
long as they made "normal prog
ress."
What the President will do
this week, according to Maslach,
is to reduce the draft's impact
on graduate study. The creation
of a prime age group will lump
19-year-olds together with the
older men, and the birth date
gimmick will randomly choose
men from this pool.
The President's imminent an
nouncement of this procedure
is "the strongest possibility,"
according to Stanford Provost
Richard Lyman, who calls his

comment an "informed guess."
Lyman is one of several top
Stanford officials who have lob
bied vigorously to influence the
Administration's draft policy.
Along with other representatives
of U.S. universities, they have
apparently bren successful in
convincing the Administration
that it shoild not continue de
ferments for science and engi
neering students while ending
them for other students. Such a
selective deferment policy, fol
lowed during the Korean war,
was one option given the Presi
dent by the 1967 law.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
expects the new rules to allow
universities to finally "do some
planning" of graduate school en
rollment for September, 1968.
The President's announcement
will end seven months of total
uncertainty for graduate schools.
Fears were expressed late last
year by Harvard President Na
than M. Pusey, that only "the
lame, the halt, the blind, and the
fema'e" would be left in grad
uate school.
If a prime age group is
created, the outlook won't be
that bleak. According to the
Scientific Manpower Commis
sion, the total draft pool for
1968 consists of approximately
590,000 19-year-olds without de
ferments, and non-students 20-
26 years old.
Since the birth-date selection
doesn't distinguish between
members of the pool, up to one
half of the eligible men in class
of '68 could be draft. One-half
of graduate students now in their
first year of study could also be
inducted.
won't be known until the new
rules are announced and the na
tion's 4,100 local draft boards
show how closely they intend to
follow them. Local boards con
tinue to have a great deal of
autonomy under the 1967 law.
The uproar over the 1967 law

might result in its repeal. Mas
lach said "Congress feels this
law has to be worked over. Two
national groups, the Association
of Graduate Schools and Council
of Graduate Schools, have asked
President Johnson to propose a
new law which would "create a
minimum of disruption and un
certainty in the lives of those
eligible for service."

This means men born in Jan
uary would have the greatest
chance of being drafted, and
those born in December have the
least.
According to estimates by
the Scienctific Manpower Com
mission, up to 50 per cent of
able-bodied seniors and first
year graduate students could
be inducted.
On Friday the Pentagon an
nounced a 1968 draft call of 302,-
000 men, smaller than some ob
servers had predicted but 72,000
larger than last year's.
George Maslach, dean of Ber
keley's college of engineering,
told The Daily yesterday he ex

pects the Administration to an
nounce the new prime age group
this week. Maslach is chairman
of a Commerce department ad
visory panel on the draft.
"We agreed upon this recom
mendation," Maslach said of the
birth-dat- 1 formula. He points
out that the 1967 law requires
the President "draft the oldest
first, with no lottery."
If President Johnson didn't
modify the draft as much
as the law permits, the older
graduate students and seniors
would be taken before any 19-
year-olds, since the 1967 law pro
vided for a of the 11-S
deferment for graduate study.
The law continued deferments
"for one academic year only" for
"any registrant enrolled in his
first year of postgraduate study
on Oct. 1, 1967." Students enroll
ed in their second year of grad
uate study on that date w*re
allowed deferment until they re
ceived a degree. Deferment of
medical students was continued,
and all undergraduates were
guaranteed a 11-S deferment as
long as they made "normal prog
ress."
What the President will do
this week, according to Maslach,
is to reduce the draft's impact
on graduate study. The creation
of a prime age group will lump
19-year-olds together with the
older men, and the birth date
gimmick will randomly choose
men from this pool.
The President's imminent an
nouncement of this procedure
is "the strongest possibility,"
according to Stanford Provost
Richard Lyman, who calls his

comment an "informed guess."
Lyman is one of several top
Stanford officials who have lob
bied vigorously to influence the
Administration's draft policy.
Along with other representatives
of U.S. universities, they have
apparently bren successful in
convincing the Administration
that it shoild not continue de
ferments for science and engi
neering students while ending
them for other students. Such a
selective deferment policy, fol
lowed during the Korean war,
was one option given the Presi
dent by the 1967 law.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
expects the new rules to allow
universities to finally "do some
planning" of graduate school en
rollment for September, 1968.
The President's announcement
will end seven months of total
uncertainty for graduate schools.
Fears were expressed late last
year by Harvard President Na
than M. Pusey, that only "the
lame, the halt, the blind, and the
fema'e" would be left in grad
uate school.
If a prime age group is
created, the outlook won't be
that bleak. According to the
Scientific Manpower Commis
sion, the total draft pool for
1968 consists of approximately
590,000 19-year-olds without de
ferments, and non-students 20-
26 years old.
Since the birth-date selection
doesn't distinguish between
members of the pool, up to one
half of the eligible men in class
of '68 could be draft. One-half
of graduate students now in their
first year of study could also be
inducted.
won't be known until the new
rules are announced and the na
tion's 4,100 local draft boards
show how closely they intend to
follow them. Local boards con
tinue to have a great deal of
autonomy under the 1967 law.
The uproar over the 1967 law

might result in its repeal. Mas
lach said "Congress feels this
law has to be worked over. Two
national groups, the Association
of Graduate Schools and Council
of Graduate Schools, have asked
President Johnson to propose a
new law which would "create a
minimum of disruption and un
certainty in the lives of those
eligible for service."
University officials expect the
government to announce new
draft rules this week which will
re'ieve some of the uncertainty
about graduate school enroll
ment.
President Johnson will specify
a "prime age group," these sour
ces predict, which will lump to
gether all 19-yoar-old non-stu
dents with graduate students and
seniors who will lose their 11-S
deferments in June.
Out of this pool, local draft
boards will be instructed to draft
men according to birth date—

pects the Administration to an
nounce the new prime age group
this week. Maslach is chairman
of a Commerce department ad
visory panel on the draft.
"We agreed upon this recom
mendation," Maslach said of the
birth-dat- 1 formula. He points
out that the 1967 law requires
the President "draft the oldest
first, with no lottery."
If President Johnson didn't
modify the draft as much
as the law permits, the older
graduate students and seniors
would be taken before any 19-
year-olds, since the 1967 law pro
vided for a of the 11-S
deferment for graduate study.
The law continued deferments
"for one academic year only" for
"any registrant enrolled in his
first year of postgraduate study
on Oct. 1, 1967." Students enroll
ed in their second year of grad
uate study on that date w*re
allowed deferment until they re
ceived a degree. Deferment of
medical students was continued,
and all undergraduates were
guaranteed a 11-S deferment as
long as they made "normal prog
ress."
What the President will do
this week, according to Maslach,
is to reduce the draft's impact
on graduate study. The creation
of a prime age group will lump
19-year-olds together with the
older men, and the birth date
gimmick will randomly choose
men from this pool.
The President's imminent an
nouncement of this procedure
is "the strongest possibility,"
according to Stanford Provost
Richard Lyman, who calls his

comment an "informed guess."
Lyman is one of several top
Stanford officials who have lob
bied vigorously to influence the
Administration's draft policy.
Along with other representatives
of U.S. universities, they have
apparently bren successful in
convincing the Administration
that it shoild not continue de
ferments for science and engi
neering students while ending
them for other students. Such a
selective deferment policy, fol
lowed during the Korean war,
was one option given the Presi
dent by the 1967 law.
Dean of Students Joel Smith
expects the new rules to allow
universities to finally "do some
planning" of graduate school en
rollment for September, 1968.
The President's announcement
will end seven months of total
uncertainty for graduate schools.
Fears were expressed late last
year by Harvard President Na
than M. Pusey, that only "the
lame, the halt, the blind, and the
fema'e" would be left in grad
uate school.
If a prime age group is
created, the outlook won't be
that bleak. According to the
Scientific Manpower Commis
sion, the total draft pool for
1968 consists of approximately
590,000 19-year-olds without de
ferments, and non-students 20-
26 years old.
Since the birth-date selection
doesn't distinguish between
members of the pool, up to one
half of the eligible men in class
of '68 could be draft. One-half
of graduate students now in their
first year of study could also be
inducted.
won't be known until the new
rules are announced and the na
tion's 4,100 local draft boards
show how closely they intend to
follow them. Local boards con
tinue to have a great deal of
autonomy under the 1967 law.
The uproar over the 1967 law

might result in its repeal. Mas
lach said "Congress feels this
law has to be worked over. Two
national groups, the Association
of Graduate Schools and Council
of Graduate Schools, have asked
President Johnson to propose a
new law which would "create a
minimum of disruption and un
certainty in the lives of those
eligible for service."
University officials expect the
government to announce new
draft rules this week which will
re'ieve some of the uncertainty
about graduate school enroll
ment.
President Johnson will specify
a "prime age group," these sour
ces predict, which will lump to
gether all 19-yoar-old non-stu
dents with graduate students and
seniors who will lose their 11-S
deferments in June.
Out of this pool, local draft
boards will be instructed to draft
men according to birth date—
starting with those bom Jan. 1,
and continuing until each board's
draft qrota is filled.
This means men born in Jan
uary would have the greatest
chance of being drafted, and
those born in December have the
least.
According to estimates by
the Scienctific Manpower Com
mission, up to 50 per cent of
able-bodied seniors and first
year graduate students could
be inducted.
On Friday the Pentagon an
nounced a 1968 draft call of 302,-
000 men, smaller than some ob
servers had predicted but 72,000
larger than last year's.
