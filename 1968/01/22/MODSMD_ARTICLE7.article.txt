## Kennedy Says U.S. Seeks 'Surrender' Before Peace 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy (D., N.Y.)
asserted yesterday the United
States is "asking for uncondi
tional surrender" as its terms
for peace talks in Vietnam.
Kennedy called again for a
bombing halt to try to start ne
gotiations toward a compromise
settlement.
He was joined in a renewed
chorus of criticism of U.S. poli
cy by Sen. J. W. Fulbright (D.,
Ark.) and Michigan Gov. George
Romney.
Romney. seeking the Republi
can presidential nomination, ani
Kennedy each said the United
States should pursue Hanoi's re
cent hint of peace talks.
Romney added, "I don't think
we should have stifFnecked
about it and I don't think that
we should make our conditions
stiffer as we have tended to do
through the years and kind of
confuse the situation."
Kennedy said a statement
by the North Vietnamese for
eign minister, Nguyen Duy
Trinh, that Hanoi will talk if
the bombing and other acts of
war are stopped "is an open
ing—l think we have to aoeept
that."
Sen. Gale McGee (D., Wyo.)
opposed a bombing halt and ar
gued, "We don't dare go to any
conference table strictly on a
fishing expedition. This is total
ly irresponsible."
Earlier Sunday, the official
North Vietnamese daily Nhan
Dan rejected Presid nt John
son's State of the Union address,
which recited the U.S. promise

to stop the bombing If talks
would take place promptly and
the Communists wouldn't take
advantage of the pause. The
daily called these "very insolent
conditions."
Kennedy and McGee ap
peared on a special CBS televi
sion program on Vietnam peace
talks. Fulbright was interviewed
on NBS's TV-radio program
"Meet the Press" while Romney
was heard on ABC's similar pro
gram "Issues and Answers."
Bombing Halt Doubted
SAIGON (AP)—An Allied de
cision to shorten the lunar new
year truce from 48 hours to 36
was taken to mean her yester
day the United States has no
intention of extending its pause
in the bombing of North Viet
nam beyond the cease-fire per
iod.
Th re have been suggestions
from various international quar
ters that President Johnson
should order the new year bomb
ing pause extended as one way
of testing Hanoi on its assertion
that it will talk peace if the
bombing is stopp d.
Premier Nguyen Van Loc an
nounced the shortening of the
cease fire period in a memo to
the South Vietnamese Ministry
of Defense. Informants said U.S.
concurrence came directly from
the White House.
The Viet Cong has announced
it intends to observe a seven-day
truce running from 1 a.m. Jan.
28 until 1 a.m. Feb. 3
Veteran North Vietnamese

troops believed based in Laos
suffered heavy casualties in a
weekend of fierce assaults on
U.S. Marine hill outposts in
South Vietnam's northwest cor
ner.
The U.S. Command in Saigon
said 25 enemy were killed but
field reports from the Marines,
as yet unprocessed at headquar
ters,listed 128 North Vietnamese
dead.
Marine loses were put at 14
killed and 43 wounded seriously
enough to require evacuation.
The fighting broke out Satur
day in the Khe Sanh area and
climaxcd Sunday in an attack
by more than 200 North Viet
namese on the Marine position
atop Hill 861. That assault and
a later one on the Khe Sanh air
strip were repelled.
Raids by B 52 Stratofortresses
and Air Force and Navy fighter
bombers supported the Ameri
can troops. Enemy ground fire
downed a Marine A 4 Skyhawk.
The pilot bailed out and was res
cued.
Ask Rritish Wealth Tax
LONDON (AP) — Represent
atives of nine million organized
workers called today for a
"soak the rich" tax to swell
Britain's shrunken coffers.
In a 50,000-word policy state
ment reviewing economic pros
pects for 1968 in the wake of the
devalued pound, the Trades Un
ion Congress (TUC) declared:
"The time is overdue for a prop
er contribution to be mad? to
the exchequer by the owners of
the great concentrations of
wealth and property in Britain."
It urged Prime Minister Har
old Wilson's Labor government
to institute an annual wealth
tax on persons owning prop
erty worth more than 20,000
pounds ($48,000).
A tax averaging 3 per cent of
such property values would
probably yield about $2.4 billion
a year, TUC estimated.
"This," it said, "would be
considered equitable by the vast
majority of the population and
would have no disincentive ef
fect on economic growth."
Recommendations by the
TUC, which holds the purse
strings of the Labor movement,
inevitably influence the thinking
of Wilson's government but in
no way are binding on the ad
ministration.
The TUC has gone along cau
tiously with Wilson's harsh aus
terity program aimed at stabi
lizing Britain's wayward econo
my. There are doubts, however,
that the honeymoon will last.
Lunar Module To Orbit
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. (AP)
— The space agency started the
countdown clock Sunday and de
clared that all "is proceeding
smoothly" toward an earth orbi
tal test today of America's
first Lunar Module, forerunner
of the type spacecraft being de
signed to ferry astronauts to
and from the moon.
Perched atop the same Saturn
1 rocket that was grounded one
year ago by the Apollo 1 fire,
the 16-ton Lunar Module 1 is to
blast off at 11 a.m. Pacific time
for a punishing 6V2-hour orbital
exercise of its moon landing and
take-off engines.
During man-to-the-moon mis
sions, a Lunar Module, attached
to the nose of a three-man Apol
lo command ship, will ride into
orbit around the moon. Once in
lunar orbit, the Module is to
separate from the orbiting Apol
lo and ferry two crewmen to the
moon's surface.
Rocky 9 s Popularity
Soars In Gallup
NEW YORK (AP) — Gov.
Nelson A. Rorkpfellpr of Npw

York has dramatically increased
his popularity among Republi
can voters, but former Vice Pres
ident Richard M. Nixon re
mains the choice of party mem
bers for the presidential nomi
nation, the Gallup Poll reported
yesterday.
Rockefeller, who was the
choice of 15 per cent of the Re
publicans in the last sampling,
made in November, increased his
share of 27 per cent in the latest
poll. Nixon stayed steady at 42
per cent.
But in a test run against Pres
ident Johnson, the New York
governor ran strongest of the
top four GOP contenders. But
none of the four — Nixon, Rock
efeller, Michigan Gov. George
Romney, and California Gov.
Ronald Reagan, could defeat
the President, if the election
were held now, the poll says.
In the test of Republican vot
ers, Nixon's 42 per cent and
Rockefeller's 27 per cent were
followed by Reagan's 12 per
cent and Reagan's 8 per cent.
Reagan, who had 13 per cent
in November, showed the sharp
est drop. Romney slid two per
centage points from his Novem
ber figure of 14.
Carrier Sparks Riots
SASEBO, Japan (AP) —
About 700 extremist left-wing
students battled Japanese police
Sunday protesting the visit here
of the nuclear-powered U.S. air
craft carrier Enterprise, and a
number of them succeeded
briefly in breaking into the U.S.
naval base.
After attacking police with
sticks and rocks at the base en
trance without success, about 70
of the students broke away from
the main group. Crossing a river
bed boardering the base 500
yards away, six of them climbed
over a six-foot wire fence and
entered the base proper.
Japanese police and U.S.
shore patrols rushed up and ar
rested two of the students. The
others fled. Navy shore patrols
confiscated a red flag brought
into the base by the students.
Cops Seize Marijuana '
CHICAGO (AP) — Police
seized 500 pounds of processed

marijuana valued at $1 million
Sunday in what officials de
scribed as "the biggest mari
juana pick-up in the history of
the police department."
The drug was discovered in an
automobile parked in a vacant
lot on the South Side. Police in
vestigated the car after receiv
ing a report that it had been
abandoned for two weeks.
Lt. Jack Barry said burlap
sacks filled with hundreds of
two-pound bags full of marijua
na were on the back seat of the
car.
When police pried open the
car trunk they found it stuffed
with more marijuana.
Refugees Oppose Talks
SAIGON (AP) — A group of
300 Roman Catholics — refugees
from North Vietnam more than
a decade ago—urged the South
Vietnamese government Sunday
to reject any peace solutions ini
tiated by the United States.
The refugees, traditionally
among the staunchest anti-Com
munist elements in South Viet
nam, adopted a resolution con
demning efforts to recognize the
Communist-led National Libera
tion Front, or to negotiate with
it.
Israeli Parties Unite
JERUSALEM (AP) — Three
of Israel's major parties merged
Sunday to form a United Labor
party which will dominate this
country's politics.
Months of often bitter wran
gling ended when the party
leaders signed a charter of un
ion to form the new party, made
up of Prime Minister Levi Esh
kol's Mapai, Labor Minister Yi
gal Allon's Achdut Havodah and
ex-Premier Ben-Gurion's splin
ter Rafi group.
Political experts hinted the al
liance of Eshkol, Allon and De
fense Minister Moshe Dayan,
Rafi's big name, would be un
easy because of personal rival
ries and ideological differences.
But they were certain the
giant would be able to silence
opposition, especially minority
parties which have held the bal
ance of power in a long series of
coalition governments.
