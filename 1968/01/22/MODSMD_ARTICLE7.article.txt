## Kennedy Says U.S. Seeks 'Surrender' Before Peace 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy (D., N.Y.)
asserted yesterday the United
States is "asking for uncondi
tional surrender" as its terms
for peace talks in Vietnam.
Kennedy called again for a
bombing halt to try to start ne
gotiations toward a compromise
settlement.
He was joined in a renewed
chorus of criticism of U.S. poli
cy by Sen. J. W. Fulbright (D.,
Ark.) and Michigan Gov. George
Romney.
Romney. seeking the Republi
can presidential nomination, ani
Kennedy each said the United
States should pursue Hanoi's re
cent hint of peace talks.
Romney added, "I don't think
we should have stifFnecked
about it and I don't think that
we should make our conditions
stiffer as we have tended to do
through the years and kind of
confuse the situation."
Kennedy said a statement
by the North Vietnamese for
eign minister, Nguyen Duy
Trinh, that Hanoi will talk if
the bombing and other acts of
war are stopped "is an open
ing—l think we have to aoeept
that."
Sen. Gale McGee (D., Wyo.)
opposed a bombing halt and ar
gued, "We don't dare go to any
conference table strictly on a
fishing expedition. This is total
ly irresponsible."
Earlier Sunday, the official
North Vietnamese daily Nhan
Dan rejected Presid nt John
son's State of the Union address,
which recited the U.S. promise

to stop the bombing If talks
would take place promptly and
the Communists wouldn't take
advantage of the pause. The
daily called these "very insolent
conditions."
Kennedy and McGee ap
peared on a special CBS televi
sion program on Vietnam peace
talks. Fulbright was interviewed
on NBS's TV-radio program
"Meet the Press" while Romney
was heard on ABC's similar pro
gram "Issues and Answers."
