# Academics Evolving
## 
### 
Once upon a time, Stanford education was supposed to consist of fulfilling a list of requirements
for an embossed piece of paper called a diploma.
Things have changed. Faculty, administration and students are beginning to realize that fulfilling re
quirements means nothing; only personal intellectual growth matters.
This dramatic change of attitude is illustrated by these two selections on "Academics" from recent
editions of the Stanford Handbook, a descriptive publication given to freshmen.
The first selection appeared in the 1964 Handbook. The second was written by Paul Rupert, then m
senior, for the 1967-1968 Handbook, given to this year's freshman.

Stanford's undergraduate pro
gram is designed to ensure that
all students obtain a liberal edu
cation in addition to completing
courses necessary to their ma
jor fields. While the program
permits each entering student to
declare his major immediately,
if he so desires, he should do so
only if he is quite certain about
his primary interest.
Stanford provides the under
graduate a period for explora
tion of his developing interests
and individual talents during the
freshman and sophomore years.
It is usually to the student's
advantage to be knowledgeable
about himself and the Univer
sity's offerings before he de
clares his major. He is not re
quired to make this declaration
until the beginning of his junior
year.
Undergraduate requirements
are arranged in an integrated
four-year General Studies Pro
gram, in which all students must
meet the basic requirements
(English, History of Western
Civilization, foreign language or
mathematics, group activity, and
courses in the humanities, social
sciences, and natural sciences).
The student should refer to the
General Studies Bulletin to find
more about the program and to
find which courses can be used
to satisfy General Studies re
quirements. Stanford recognizes
scholastic achievement in high
school by awarding up to 45
units of advanced placement
credit. Awards are made on the
basis of College Board and spe
cial placement examinations.
Courses at Stanford generally
aim for a maximum of student
participation. In many of the
larger lecture courses, part of
the time is spent in sections
(small discussion groups of fif
teen to twenty-five students led
by a teaching assistant). Other
courses have small laboratory
groups, where students may ask
questions and receive individual
help.
Students are encouraged to
take exploratory courses as elec
tives in addition to their major
and General Studies require
ments. Students are also re
quired to take part in organized
or group activities, which have
potential recreational value, dur
ing six quarters of their four
years.

"In general, the Committee re
gards attendance in final exami
nations as the student's primary
academic obligation."
(From examination Instruc
tions in the Stanford Time
Schedule)

Many students, perhaps a ma
jority, will easily fulfill the "pri
mary academic obligation" of
their four years at Stanford. Too
many will do that alone, and in
so doing suffer the illusion that
they have been educated, that
the multitudinous processes of
the University have truly en
lightened them. But in the end,
they will remain totally ignorant
of the "liberty, health, and joy"
of the individual, and their
minds will undergo the dull
atrophy that is to characterize
the remainder of a life full of
potential-become-reminiscence.
Many students think there Is
an identifiable something, a
"Stanford type" to adjust to.
There is no such entity. For each
student, Stanford includes an
enormous variety of opportuni
ties if he will utilize them. By
enrolling in this university, the
student provides himself with
the raw materials of academic
courses, facilities, faculty, fel
low students, cultural and recre
ational opportunities. With these
he should create an education
for himself. Unfortunately most
students never make a con
scious, rational choice because
they're not even aware of the
alternatives. They passively ac
cept situations which reinforce
their narrow preconceptions
about university life and about
themselves. It need not be so,
and it may not be for those who
attempt to understand their edu
cation.
The undergraduate is free to
create his education to form him
self, inform his mind, and re
form his actions—but that free
dom is contingent upon self
awareness and determination.
The very trite but demanding
maxim, "You get out of it what
you put fnto it," is compounded
by the realization that you must
reach far beyond requirements,
both in apprehension and com
prehension, and then create the
conditions for your personal
growth.
The entering student, condi
tioned to authority and skilled
and schooled in the ways of the

system, may never know his
bondage. The insecure will as
sess requirements and choose
the road of least resistance; the
less able will throw themselves
with frightening vengeance at
the library and Quad, and the
compulsive will read, and re
read, and amass notes and as
sume that to be learning. All
these will succeed, and go on.
But will any of them know sig
nificant change? Perhaps their
experience is not growth, and
they are only formally students,
as their school is formally a
guarantor of education.
To you who would learn, to
those of you who might leam
about yourself and study your
life, to those who seek under
standing and the freedom to
view yourself in light of what
you might become: Stanford will
seem a different experience and
a fuller one. Appreciating lei
sure and the independence from
the trivial and the disruptive;
having overcome the tendency
to adjust yourself to the lowest
common denominator; having
understood that the virtue of
competition is its stimulation of
the mind to a point where it as
sumes a life of its own and un
derstands further competition to
be the disruptive, unreflective,
brutal absurdity that it is; hav
ing escaped the pressure, often
the tyranny of grades, and of
unexamined routines; and sens
ing that there must be more to
knowledge than rote recapitula
tion and regurgitation, you will
begin a difficult, trying, frus
trating process — designed by
you, accomplished by you, and
appreciated only by you—that
should make you a more com
plete person.
You are entering a commu
nity. It is isolated from society,
granting possibilities for a warm
exchange of friends and schol
ars, constantly reflecting and ex
ploring. But it is a community
that exists only as it is renewed
and recreated by each of you.
And while removed from socie
ty, it is dedicated to understand
ing that society. It holds you for
four years after which you will
go on with a unique understand
ing through a life that you
create for yourself. If all goes
well, this challenge and the joy
of your own growth will be your
memory, and newer discoveries,
higher actions, and warmer rela
tionships must follow.
