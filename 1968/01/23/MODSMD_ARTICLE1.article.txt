The Campus leftists gathered last night at a Community of the Left meeting in Tresidder (left pic
ture), while a group of more conservative students, the Stanford Nixon Committee, met elsewhere
in the building (right picture). The Nixon Committee officers are (1-r) Michael Wolf, secretary
treasurer; John Rodgers, chairman; and Bob Clark, vice chairman. The Nixon group passed a reso
lution urging Nixon to announce his candidacy, while the Community of the Left made plans for a
panel discussion on the McCarthy candidacy, which the group opposes as too moderate.
