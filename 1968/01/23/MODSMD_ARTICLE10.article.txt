# Stop The Bombing: Humanity Wants To Get Off
## 
### BRUCE MERRY 
For everyone the enemy has
a different face. For the hairy
old woman in the Post Office
the Viet-Chinese are operating
from Los Altos hills. For the ex-
Special Forces evangelical about
to go to Bible School in S. Vir
ginia, the enemy are godless
huns who did not even kill the
right missionaries in nineteenth
century China.
For Joan Baez and her ilk the
enemy is quite simply the con
cept of military coercion, wheth
er applied by White or Red Rus
sian, by American or Vietna
mese. For others still, the
enemy is political. For ninety
per cent of American G.l.'s (see
Frank Harvey's Air War: Viet
nam) the enemy is a political
vermin that "we'd rather stop
in Vietnam than on the coast of
California."
In Britain the Vietnamese
enemy is a vague oriental
cousin of the Warsaw Pact, and
De Gaulle's flirtation against
N.A.T.O. is seen, by a brilliant
and unorthodox stretch of their
ex-Imperial paranoia, as a pre
liminary concession to those
awful expanding Dominos the
advance of which our pals in
S.E.A.T.O. are passionately
striving to block.
Even we radicals see our pet
enemies at work in the war.
Horrible streaks of silver jet
against the noonday Vietna
mese sky, descending cigars of

napalm, canisters of C.B.U.'s,
millions of lethal machine guns
made in a gum-chewing capital
ist industrial-military complex.
Pool Resourc?s
Perhaps it is nearly time to
pool the energy of our preju
dices and erect a common truth
from the war. Humanitarian is
sues are too easily forgotten. It
is facile to feel a twinge of
greedy pleasure when a S.A.M.
downs one of our $8 million
jets (though only 2 per cent
of S.A.M.'s find a target).
It is equally easy for Ameri
can newspaper readers to gorge
themselves on the number of
corpses left after every engage
ment by the crack Viet Cong
9th Division. The constant alien
ation of various regiments of
this Division is a propaganda
miracle, because the 9th is ap
parently still in fighting con
dition (see New Republic, "Is
This Overkill," January 13,
1968).
The common humanitarian
truth should be erected above
the sordid drama of human poli
tics. Here is a war which de
stroys eight or nine times more
Vietnamese citizens than Am
erican occupiers. Here is a war
which has devastated a minus
cule Communist regime from
the air.
Terrorism From Both Sides
It is a war which has annihil
ated the morality of the watch
ing world only two decades
after the Second World War.

It is a war which has leveled
every school and hospital in the
North and most of those built
(admittedly for propaganda pur
poses) by the Viet Cong in the
South. Terrorism and violence
are doled out from unequal
ladles by both sides, but their
effects are identical.
This madness, this insanity,
could be called to a halt the day
after tomorrow. The first step
is tohalt U.S. bombing. For three
years our planet had not seen
city bombardment from the air.
And now it had happened in the
case of undeclared ideological
warfare.
In calling for a cessation of
bombing, the radical Peacenik
is only accidentally identifying
himself with Communist inter
ests. Through long weeks of
World War II the Luftwaffe
pulverised London and the
R.A.F. gutted Nazidom. In
neither case is there much evi
dence that the falling bombs
even fractionally changed the
outcome of the ground war.
Today, in our country, there
is a growing chorus of voices
which partake, like Mike Mans
field's, of somewhat more re
spectability than Baez-Coffln-
Spock's. Just for a joke, just
for a New Year's laugh, come
on Lyndon, just on the off
chance, just so you can throw
it back in our teeth come No
vember, just like a nice guy,
why not halt the bombing?
