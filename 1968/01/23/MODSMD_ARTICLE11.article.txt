## The
						Problem Is... 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It was not really surprising to
me when I read in The Daily
that the downing of an Ameri
can plane was applauded at
Stanford. Had I been in attend
ance, and had either of the
"Americans" sitting next to me
applauded, I might have been
moved to fill their mouths with
fists.
You see, I have fought in Viet
nam. Many of my friends have
died there, killed by the men the
"frail, austere Ho Chi Minh"
sends into South Vietnam. He
also sends them to Laos nd
Thailand, if anybody's interested.
Several of my friends have
been killed over North Vietnam,
too. Perhaps one was in the
plane in the film.
I also know many South Viet
namese — strange as it seems,
that are grateful to Americans
for helping them repel the North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong. For
the non-believers, Viet Cong
means Vietnamese Communist.
Yes, it is Communism we are
fighting over there. Not the theo
retical communism about which
the whiskered ones speak; but
the communism that exists and
would extend its influence.
Call it a domino theory; that
is what it is. Saying that it is
untrue will not make it so, we
have seen the dominos topple.
The "dominos" next in line know
the theory is real.
For any of you readers who
might be a little concerned over
the antiwar, antidraft, SNCC in
dividuals — relax. These are not
Americans.
Go to any U.S. military instal
lation in Europe, Korea, Vietnam
or even America and you will
find Americans. They are profes
sionals, draftees, oriental, color
ed, white; but they are all Amer
icans, and they know what they
are doing.
They are not asking for peace,
love, or civil rights; they are
working for them. They have
not sold out; they have recog
nized their responsibilities.
It is indeed easy to say we
really have no enemy in Viet
nam; but go take a look — some
one is shooting back. If you
could, it might be interesting to
ask the U.S. medical teams who
have been killed while treating
South Vietnamese civilians. You
might ask Captain Versace who
was murdered as a POW (take
note Napier; remember him
when you pray). He was a friend
of mine and had planned on en
tering the clergy.

I have rambled but do not
apologize. The message I have
tried to convey is this: Those of
you who have been making noise
and taking delight in disrupting
law and order, shut up and
listen — the problem is you.
AN AMERICAN STUDENT
• Political Activism
Isn't Really JSetv
Editor, the Daily:
In his "Guided Miscellany" of
Jan. 22. Christopher Hargrove
seems to lament the fact the
"young heirs to the Great So
ciety" at Stanford are "politi
cally dormant," i.e. either right
wing or in various areas of the
middle. Stanford students are
compared unfavourably with
those at Berkeley, but what Mr.
Hargrove doesn't realize is that
many freshmen turned Berkeley
down because they hoped to es
cape the leftest "politicizing"
that he so much desires.
While the saintly David Har
ris' "dynamic personality" may
be attractive to some, and his
manner of oratory entertaining
if not cohesive or enlightening,
his inane rantings and ravings
against every available facet of
the established order reflect the
sentiments of only a segment
of the Stanford community.
A majority of the members
of the academic community have
moral doubts concerning the
Vietnam war by this time, but
are either indifferent to or re
pelled by the increasingly mo
notonous "wild-eyed leftist" line,
and are convinced of the futility

of rallies in White Plaza and
demonstrations in Oakland.
It is unfortunate that the out
side world gets the impression
that The Daily is an expression
of popular student opinion. This
kind of political viewpoint will
repulse many exceptional stu
dents in the same way that
Berkeley does now. And believe
it or not, those students are im
portant to Stanford. If Mr. Har
grove and his colleagues would
get their noses out of The Dally
and similar publications, they
might conceivably find out that
political activism predates the
New Left by quite a few years,
and that it is possible to hold a
political view without the aid of
a bullhorn and a crowd.

• Cars On The Farm
But No Lighted Steets
Editor, The Daily:
Regardless of the efforts of
the Planning Office, many per
sons associated with Stanford
own cars. Many drive them on
the campus at night. They can
not see where they are going.
There are not enough street
lights. Many of the street lights
are turned off at night.
Eating carrots does not im
prove the situation. I have tried
it. Please, can't we have more
street lights, brighter street
lights, or even large candles? I
do not want to run over some
pedestrian on the campus at
night. I have enough problems.
