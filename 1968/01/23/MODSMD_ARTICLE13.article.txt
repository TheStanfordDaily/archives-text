## LBJ's Negotiations: Ho's Moral Victory 
### Art Buchwald 
My good friend Joe Wallstop,
whom aU of us in the column
business look on as the opinion
maker's opinion-maker, was in a
foul mood when I saw him the
other day.
"What's the trouble, Joe?"
"I can't stand these fools who
keep talking about peace in Viet
nam."
"You mean President Johnson
and Dean Rusk?"
The Peaceniks
"No, you idiot," he said angri
ly. "I mean the appeasers and
the peaceniks and the nervous
Nellies who keep screaming for
us to stop the bombing and sit
down with the "Communists."
"Oh, those fools. But why are
you so upset right now?"
"Because Hanoi is trying to
trick us into peace negotiations."
"I thought that was what we
were going for in Vietnam."
Hit 'Em Again, Harder
"Don't you see? If they're ask
ing for peace negotiations, that
means they're hurting, and in
stead of letting up on them now,
we should really start clobber
ing them."
"But we were clobbering them
before because they wouldn't
talk peace with us."
"Exactly. We clobbered them
before because they wouldn't dis
cuss negotiations with us. They
thought they were winning the
war. Now that they're asking
for peace, they obviously don't
think they can win the war, and
this is the time to let them have
it."
We Can't Sit Down
"But, Joe, what I don't under
stand is that if we can't sit down
with them when they think
they're winning the war, and we
can't sit down with them when
they think they're losing the war,
when the hell can we sit down
with them?"
"There is no good time to sit
down with Hanoi. That's why we

have to keep clobbering th**'
I have here some captured don
ments which indicate that it wr
part of Hanoi's master plan t'-
if they couldn't win the war t 1 r
would sit down with us and t' 1
peace."
"That's serious, if tru°." T <?•
"But what's wrong with it?''
Puff, Puff. Puff
Wallstop seemed
"Dont you understand? AH th
want is a breathing s^ 1 ' 112
th -1 bombing."
"But I thought the whole id
of the bombing was to bring t'
North Vietnamese to the conf^ v
ence table."
"Sure," said WaPstop, "b*
they won't come to the conf *
ence table unless we stop tb
bombing. So why should we st<~
the bombing to appease them?"
Peace Too Expensive
"I guess we shouldn't. Th"
you see peace as the bigge c
danger of the war?"
"I certainly do. It's th ra on
thing we can't afford to hav
When you start talking pea"'
you have to make concession
We're in no position to make con
cessions to the Communists. Af
ter all, our obligation is to South
Vietnam, not North Vietnam."
"From what you have said,
you really can't have peace talk*
with the Communists, even i*
they ask for it, because if you
do they would interpret it as a
sign of weakness on our part."
"Now you've got it," said WaH
stop. "If we stop the bombinp
and sit down with them, it wil 1
be a moral victory for their
side."
"And if we continue to bomb
them after they've asked for
peace, it will be a moral victory
for our side," I said excitedly.
Wallstop seemed weary. "It's
so simple. Why do I have to keep
explaining it to those fools all
the time?"
