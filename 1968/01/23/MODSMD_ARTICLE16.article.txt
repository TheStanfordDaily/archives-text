# Senator Stanford's Show
## Leland's Nag Stars In Flick 
### ROBIN KNIGHT 
To some people Leland Stan
ford Sr. has a lot to answer*
for. He produced this Univers
ity, he opened up California
through the operations of the
Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany, and he was instrumental
in starting experiments which
produced the prototype of the
moving picture.
Whether or not Mr. Stanford
realized that the seemingly in
nocent trials of his string of
trotting horses would generate
a multi-million dollar industry,
replete with bubble baths, sex,
violence and moments of ex

treme beauty, is questionable.
But this is what has happened.
It all began in 1872 in Sacra
mento. Legend has us believe
that the episode started with a
bet, reportedly $4,000, that a
horse's four legs were off the
ground at the same time.
Stanford's Brainstrorn
In the preface to J.D. Still
man's The Horse in Motion,
which was published in 1882 as
a result of the experiments,
Stanford wrote:
"I have for a long time enter
tained the opinion that the ac
cepted theory of the relative
positions of the feet of horses

was erroneous. I also believed
that the camera could be util
ized to demonstrate this fact,
and by instantaneous pictures
show the actual positions of the
limbs at each stage of the
stride."
To prove this theory Stanford
employed th e photographer,
Eadwarde Muybridge, born
plain Edward Muggeridge in
Kingston - upon - Thames, En
gland. Early in youth, Muy
bridge was touched by the ro
mance of one of the Anglo-
Saxon kings of Southern En
gland. He later acquired some
renown by shooting his wife's

lover, and winning acquittal
from a jury which said that any
man would do the same.
In 1872 the normal way to
produce a photograph was to
use the wet collodion process
with glass plates which n> cessi
tated dipping plates in a solu
tion just before exposure. The
exposure for the 1872 experi
ments was only 1/12 second
causing the pictures to blurr.
Move To Palo Alto
By 1877 Stanford had moved
his stock farm to Palo Alto,
and the trotting track occupied
an area stretching from today's
stables to Santa Teresa Avenue.

Muybridge, meanwhile, had
been on a lengthy expedition to
Central America. Stanford re
contacted Muybridge and the
experiments began again.
Learning from his 1872 ex
periments, Muybridge used 24
cameras placed one foot apart
for the 1877-78 project. These
cameras were housed in a long
building which stood parallel to
a section of the one mile track.
Across the track successive
strings were stretched attached
to the camera shutters. As the
horse ran over the track, each
string was broken causing the
shutter to open and close. This
time the exposure was 1/200
second.
Eureka
Results exceeded all expecta
tions. By judicious touching-up
of the photographs, and the
use of a machine which Muy
bridge invented called a zoopra
xiscope, it was shown beyond
doubt that a horse has all four
feet on the ground at one point.
Instead of the centuries-old
idea that the four 1 >gs were off
the ground at a point of maxi
mum gallop, however, Muy
bridge's pictures showed that
the crucial point was when the
legs are bunched together be
neath the belly.
Today it is generally accepted
that this represents the birth of
the motion-picture industry, and
plaques in Memorial Court and
the riding-stables confidently
make this claim. In 1929 cele
brations were held here to mark
the fiftieth anniversary of the
project.


HORSE TRACK — This is the housing for the apparatus used by
Stanford's photographer Eadwarde Muybridge to prove that horses
do indeed have all their feet off the ground at times when then are
galloping. The cameras were housed in the building at right and
placed 27 inches apart One of Stanford's horses, named Sallie

Gardner, ran through the track June 19, 1878, to prove the S ■nator's
hypothesis. The cameras took pictures at one twenty-fifth of a
second intervals. The track was built somewhere near the present
University riding stables near the golf course.

cepted theory of the relative
positions of the feet of horses

was erroneous. I also believed
that the camera could be util
ized to demonstrate this fact,
and by instantaneous pictures
show the actual positions of the
limbs at each stage of the
stride."
To prove this theory Stanford
employed th e photographer,
Eadwarde Muybridge, born
plain Edward Muggeridge in
Kingston - upon - Thames, En
gland. Early in youth, Muy
bridge was touched by the ro
mance of one of the Anglo-
Saxon kings of Southern En
gland. He later acquired some
renown by shooting his wife's

lover, and winning acquittal
from a jury which said that any
man would do the same.
In 1872 the normal way to
produce a photograph was to
use the wet collodion process
with glass plates which n> cessi
tated dipping plates in a solu
tion just before exposure. The
exposure for the 1872 experi
ments was only 1/12 second
causing the pictures to blurr.
Move To Palo Alto
By 1877 Stanford had moved
his stock farm to Palo Alto,
and the trotting track occupied
an area stretching from today's
stables to Santa Teresa Avenue.

Muybridge, meanwhile, had
been on a lengthy expedition to
Central America. Stanford re
contacted Muybridge and the
experiments began again.
Learning from his 1872 ex
periments, Muybridge used 24
cameras placed one foot apart
for the 1877-78 project. These
cameras were housed in a long
building which stood parallel to
a section of the one mile track.
Across the track successive
strings were stretched attached
to the camera shutters. As the
horse ran over the track, each
string was broken causing the
shutter to open and close. This
time the exposure was 1/200
second.
Eureka
Results exceeded all expecta
tions. By judicious touching-up
of the photographs, and the
use of a machine which Muy
bridge invented called a zoopra
xiscope, it was shown beyond
doubt that a horse has all four
feet on the ground at one point.
Instead of the centuries-old
idea that the four 1 >gs were off
the ground at a point of maxi
mum gallop, however, Muy
bridge's pictures showed that
the crucial point was when the
legs are bunched together be
neath the belly.
Today it is generally accepted
that this represents the birth of
the motion-picture industry, and
plaques in Memorial Court and
the riding-stables confidently
make this claim. In 1929 cele
brations were held here to mark
the fiftieth anniversary of the
project.


HORSE TRACK — This is the housing for the apparatus used by
Stanford's photographer Eadwarde Muybridge to prove that horses
do indeed have all their feet off the ground at times when then are
galloping. The cameras were housed in the building at right and
placed 27 inches apart One of Stanford's horses, named Sallie

Gardner, ran through the track June 19, 1878, to prove the S ■nator's
hypothesis. The cameras took pictures at one twenty-fifth of a
second intervals. The track was built somewhere near the present
University riding stables near the golf course.
To some people Leland Stan
ford Sr. has a lot to answer*
for. He produced this Univers
ity, he opened up California
through the operations of the
Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany, and he was instrumental
in starting experiments which
produced the prototype of the
moving picture.
Whether or not Mr. Stanford
realized that the seemingly in
nocent trials of his string of
trotting horses would generate
a multi-million dollar industry,
replete with bubble baths, sex,
violence and moments of ex

treme beauty, is questionable.
But this is what has happened.
It all began in 1872 in Sacra
mento. Legend has us believe
that the episode started with a
bet, reportedly $4,000, that a
horse's four legs were off the
ground at the same time.

and the trotting track occupied
an area stretching from today's
stables to Santa Teresa Avenue.

Muybridge, meanwhile, had
been on a lengthy expedition to
Central America. Stanford re
contacted Muybridge and the
experiments began again.
Learning from his 1872 ex
periments, Muybridge used 24
cameras placed one foot apart
for the 1877-78 project. These
cameras were housed in a long
building which stood parallel to
a section of the one mile track.
Across the track successive
strings were stretched attached
to the camera shutters. As the
horse ran over the track, each
string was broken causing the
shutter to open and close. This
time the exposure was 1/200
second.
Eureka
Results exceeded all expecta
tions. By judicious touching-up
of the photographs, and the
use of a machine which Muy
bridge invented called a zoopra
xiscope, it was shown beyond
doubt that a horse has all four
feet on the ground at one point.
Instead of the centuries-old
idea that the four 1 >gs were off
the ground at a point of maxi
mum gallop, however, Muy
bridge's pictures showed that
the crucial point was when the
legs are bunched together be
neath the belly.
Today it is generally accepted
that this represents the birth of
the motion-picture industry, and
plaques in Memorial Court and
the riding-stables confidently
make this claim. In 1929 cele
brations were held here to mark
the fiftieth anniversary of the
project.


HORSE TRACK — This is the housing for the apparatus used by
Stanford's photographer Eadwarde Muybridge to prove that horses
do indeed have all their feet off the ground at times when then are
galloping. The cameras were housed in the building at right and
placed 27 inches apart One of Stanford's horses, named Sallie

Gardner, ran through the track June 19, 1878, to prove the S ■nator's
hypothesis. The cameras took pictures at one twenty-fifth of a
second intervals. The track was built somewhere near the present
University riding stables near the golf course.
