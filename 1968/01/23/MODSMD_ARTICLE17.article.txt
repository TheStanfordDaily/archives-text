# Discussion Tonight
## Women Washed Up At 37? 
### 
A meeting of feminine minds
in Lagunita Court at 8 tonight
will discuss this non-academic
question:
Does a woman have to be
washed up at age 37?
Dr. Elizabeth G. Cohen, assist
ant professor of education, and
9 other women will meet in La

gunita's Magnolia Lounge to
"talk with women very realistic
ally about the problems they
will face for the next 15 years."
All of the women are married
and have children, according to
Dr. Cohen, but they differ from
most other women of th. ir age.
"They have continued to do
very interesting things with
their lives," the professor notes.
"One is a school board member.
Another is a mystery book
author."
"Not one has had a 'straight
line' career development."

As Dr. Cohen sees the prob
lem, most women graduate
from college, then enter the oft
repeated pattern of homemaker
housewife, only to find after a
few years that they are de
pressed and have nothing to do.
What they don't .realize, notes
Dr. Cohen, is that "it will be
tough to re-enter the labor mar
ket in their early 30's without
training. But you can prepare
for this day."
Dr. Cohen said she will begin
with a 20 minute talk, followed
by small group discussions.
