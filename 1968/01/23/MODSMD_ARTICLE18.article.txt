# National Problems Affect Peace Corps

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Peace Corps' official policy says
volunteers are not to get in
volved in the politics of a host
nation. But there's nothing in
the rule hook that says local pol
itics can't involve the Peace
Corps.
During the seven years of its
existence, the Peace Corps has
been caught up in the political
and armed crossfires of coun
tries in which it serves.
The volunteer agency's bat
ting average, however, has been
quite high in winning more
friends than it loses.
Since its inception in 1961, the
Corps has left a nation—either
voluntarily or on being asked—
on the average of one country a
year.
On the other hand, it has sent
volunteers to a new nation on
the average of nine new coun
tries a year.
Thus, the Peace Corps had
slightly more than 12,000 volun
teers serving in 55 countries by
the end of 1967.
Volunteers have left seven
countries during the past seven
years but one—Ceylon—asked
for more volunteers last year
after asking them to leave in
1964.
The other countries in which
volunteers no longer serve are
Pakistan, Cyprus, Guinea, In
donesia, Mauritania and Gabon.
The Peace Corps is gradually

fading out of Nigeria, once one
of the agency's largest pro
grams, but there has been no of
ficial notice the program there
is being eliminated.
Jack Vaughn, director, and
other officials at headquarters
here have a standard reply
when asked about volunteers
being pulled out of a country.
Typical was the reply in De
cember when the announcement
was made that 57 volunteers
were being withdrawn from Ga
bon at the request of that
French-speaking West African
nation: "We go to a country at
the invitation of the host gov
ernment, and whenever a gov
ernment wishes us to leave, we
do so willingly."
There was no mention of the
recent shakeup of the Gabonese
government after the death of
the prime minister and the pos
sibility of influence from the
French government.
The Corps does not officially
comment critically on its oust
ers because there is always the
possibility of another change in
government.
In 1962 the Peace Corps sent
39 volunteers to Ceylon for a
two year tour of duty but the
program was not continued
after it ended in 1964 "by mu
tual agreement of the United
States and Ceylon govern
ments," according to official re
leases.
