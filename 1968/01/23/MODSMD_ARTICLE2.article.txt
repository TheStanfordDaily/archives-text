# Larger Student Body
## Bookstore Capacity Too Small 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ (Second of Two Parts) 
The Stanford Bookstore moved
into a big, new, modern build
ing in 1960, and has already out
grown the structure.
The reason: a 32 per cent in
crease in the size of the student
body since the store was erected.
When the new Bookstore
was planned, it was slated to
have a full basement for stor
age. According to the store's
manager, William Kimball,
this "was cut to a half-base
ment, then to a quarter-base
ment, then to none at all."
And now he sorely needs the
space.
The loading and unloading
area wasn't adequate even when
the Bookstore moved into the
new building, Kimball asserts.
During the period when books
are arriving for the beginning
of-the-quarter rush, the receiv
ing and handling room is insuf
ficient to keep even the books
that have arrived and are wait
ing to be sorted and still allow
people to work.
So during this period, the
books are moved outside onto
the loading platform during the
day, and returned to the receiv
ing room at night, causing extra
delay and therefore extra ex
pense.
Other areas, adequate in the
past, are reaching the saturation
point and will soon be inadequ
ate to handle the activity.
In the textbook department
on the mezzanine, skids have
been placed along the rail to
hold extra books. The section
Is barely holding its own now,
and if enrollment and courses
continue to grow, the Book
store will soon run out of
space to display the texts.
Office space is minimal and
scattered throughout the store,
tucked into every available cor

ner. The lack of centralization
causes even further inefficiency.
On top of this, office space
sometimes doubles as storage
space. The desk of the general
book department manager con
sists mainly of shelves full of
books — replacements for titles
already on display.
The storeroom for stationery
and supplies is adequate during
most of the year. But at the start
of each quarter when spiral note
books are sold in huge quantities,
the room just cannot handle the
volume, and the supply must be
replenished daily from tempor
ary storage space in Meyer Li
brary.
This space in the library is also
used to keep texts that arrive for
the following quarter long be
fore they can be put on the
shelves.
This happens because to en
sure delivery by the start of
the quarter, books must be
ordered three months in
advance. The texts arrive
throughout the three months,
however, and must be kept
somewhere until they are need
ed.
What makes the situation
worse is that the Bookstore will
soon have to relinquish this li
brary space, which will be con
verted into stacks.
What is barely tolerfeble now
will become even worse in a
few years, Kimball predicts, be
cause of the projected growth
of the student body.
To prepare for future needs,
the board of directors of the
Bookstore received permission
from the University in 1966 to
expand the store.
But the exact method, namely
adding on to the present build
ing or erecting a second struc
ture, was not specified.
A cost study was carried out,
and projected estimates of need
ed space were made. But because
of the lapse of time and the con

tinuing inflation, the business of
fice asked for another cost
study, which is presently being
conducted.
Applying a basic rule of thumb
approved by the National Asso
ciation of College Stores for a
school with between 12,000 and
15,000 students, three square
feet of space for books and sup
plies per student is optimal, Stan
ford's store is presently far
smaller than it should be.
Using this rule, the Book
store should have more than
37,000 square feet available.
It has only a total of 19,000
square feet, 3,000 of which can
not be used for books and sup
plies.
But in other ways, the Stan
ford Bookstore rates with the
best in the country.
A survey way made several
years ago of the amount of mon
ey spent on books by students at
various universities. The method
was rather crude, merely divid
ing the total book sales by the
number of students.
The results showed Stanford
as the fourth highest in the
country, behind Harvard, Yale,
and Princeton.
According to Kimball this is
not an indication of too many
assigned texts here or over
priced books, but rather of the
large general book department
here and at the three mentioned
Ivy League schools.
Having a large selection of
non-text books seems to be a
goal that other college book
stores would like to reach.
Robert Kennedy, manager of
the Cal bookstore, believes "the
Stanford Bookstore, at this point
at least, is more book-oriented
than our store, and in my opin
ion this is quite an asset."
"It is a direction to which we
hope to point in the not too
distant future."
The setup at Cal is quite dif
ferent from here, however. The

Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California (ASUC)
owns the bookstore, and all pro
fits return to the ASUC for use
in student activities.
Therefore, since the money in
effect is returned to the students
in some form, the bookstore
gives no student discount. Teach
ing faculty get a ten per cent re
bate.
San Jose State's bookstore also
has no discount to students, and
a ten per cent savings for the
faculty. The manager there, Har
ry Wineroth, is also somewhat
envious of Stanford's store.
He feels that Stanford has
"a real good bookstore. I'd be
very happy to have a setup
like that, but we just don't
have the space."
Some other college stores give
student discounts, some larger
than Stanford, but because the
amount of sales to non-univer
sity community members at
these schools is large, the per
centage of total sales which are
refunded are as a rule lower
than that here, namely seven
per cent.
Also, those with larger dis
counts garner additional revenue
from co-op membership fees —
and only members are eligible
for discounts from list prices.
Therefore, by all standards,
Stanford's Bookstore compares
favorably with almost all others
in the way it treats its cus
tomers — the students, faculty,
and staff.
But there is always the ques
tion of whether the Bookstore
should have to make a profit to
put into expansion, or if the Uni
versity should pay for all build
ing.
The Bookstore's profits are
still declining, however, and this
question may no longer be an
issue unless the store can ex
pand, thereby becoming more ef
ficient and increasing profits
again.

ey spent on books by students at
various universities. The method
was rather crude, merely divid
ing the total book sales by the
number of students.
The results showed Stanford
as the fourth highest in the
country, behind Harvard, Yale,
and Princeton.
According to Kimball this is
not an indication of too many
assigned texts here or over
priced books, but rather of the
large general book department
here and at the three mentioned
Ivy League schools.
Having a large selection of
non-text books seems to be a
goal that other college book
stores would like to reach.
Robert Kennedy, manager of
the Cal bookstore, believes "the
Stanford Bookstore, at this point
at least, is more book-oriented
than our store, and in my opin
ion this is quite an asset."
"It is a direction to which we
hope to point in the not too
distant future."
The setup at Cal is quite dif
ferent from here, however. The

Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California (ASUC)
owns the bookstore, and all pro
fits return to the ASUC for use
in student activities.
Therefore, since the money in
effect is returned to the students
in some form, the bookstore
gives no student discount. Teach
ing faculty get a ten per cent re
bate.
San Jose State's bookstore also
has no discount to students, and
a ten per cent savings for the
faculty. The manager there, Har
ry Wineroth, is also somewhat
envious of Stanford's store.
He feels that Stanford has
"a real good bookstore. I'd be
very happy to have a setup
like that, but we just don't
have the space."
Some other college stores give
student discounts, some larger
than Stanford, but because the
amount of sales to non-univer
sity community members at
these schools is large, the per
centage of total sales which are
refunded are as a rule lower
than that here, namely seven
per cent.
Also, those with larger dis
counts garner additional revenue
from co-op membership fees —
and only members are eligible
for discounts from list prices.
Therefore, by all standards,
Stanford's Bookstore compares
favorably with almost all others
in the way it treats its cus
tomers — the students, faculty,
and staff.
But there is always the ques
tion of whether the Bookstore
should have to make a profit to
put into expansion, or if the Uni
versity should pay for all build
ing.
The Bookstore's profits are
still declining, however, and this
question may no longer be an
issue unless the store can ex
pand, thereby becoming more ef
ficient and increasing profits
again.
The Stanford Bookstore moved
into a big, new, modern build
ing in 1960, and has already out
grown the structure.
The reason: a 32 per cent in
crease in the size of the student
body since the store was erected.
When the new Bookstore
was planned, it was slated to
have a full basement for stor
age. According to the store's
manager, William Kimball,
this "was cut to a half-base
ment, then to a quarter-base
ment, then to none at all."
And now he sorely needs the
space.
The loading and unloading
area wasn't adequate even when
the Bookstore moved into the
new building, Kimball asserts.
During the period when books
are arriving for the beginning
of-the-quarter rush, the receiv
ing and handling room is insuf
ficient to keep even the books
that have arrived and are wait
ing to be sorted and still allow
people to work.
So during this period, the
books are moved outside onto
the loading platform during the
day, and returned to the receiv
ing room at night, causing extra
delay and therefore extra ex
pense.
Other areas, adequate in the
past, are reaching the saturation
point and will soon be inadequ
ate to handle the activity.
In the textbook department
on the mezzanine, skids have
been placed along the rail to
hold extra books. The section
Is barely holding its own now,
and if enrollment and courses
continue to grow, the Book
store will soon run out of
space to display the texts.
Office space is minimal and
scattered throughout the store,
tucked into every available cor

ner. The lack of centralization
causes even further inefficiency.
On top of this, office space
sometimes doubles as storage
space. The desk of the general
book department manager con
sists mainly of shelves full of
books — replacements for titles
already on display.
The storeroom for stationery
and supplies is adequate during
most of the year. But at the start
of each quarter when spiral note
books are sold in huge quantities,
the room just cannot handle the
volume, and the supply must be
replenished daily from tempor
ary storage space in Meyer Li
brary.
This space in the library is also
used to keep texts that arrive for
the following quarter long be
fore they can be put on the
shelves.
This happens because to en
sure delivery by the start of
the quarter, books must be
ordered three months in
advance. The texts arrive
throughout the three months,
however, and must be kept
somewhere until they are need
ed.
What makes the situation
worse is that the Bookstore will
soon have to relinquish this li
brary space, which will be con
verted into stacks.
What is barely tolerfeble now
will become even worse in a
few years, Kimball predicts, be
cause of the projected growth
of the student body.
To prepare for future needs,
the board of directors of the
Bookstore received permission
from the University in 1966 to
expand the store.
But the exact method, namely
adding on to the present build
ing or erecting a second struc
ture, was not specified.
A cost study was carried out,
and projected estimates of need
ed space were made. But because
of the lapse of time and the con

tinuing inflation, the business of
fice asked for another cost
study, which is presently being
conducted.
Applying a basic rule of thumb
approved by the National Asso
ciation of College Stores for a
school with between 12,000 and
15,000 students, three square
feet of space for books and sup
plies per student is optimal, Stan
ford's store is presently far
smaller than it should be.
Using this rule, the Book
store should have more than
37,000 square feet available.
It has only a total of 19,000
square feet, 3,000 of which can
not be used for books and sup
plies.
But in other ways, the Stan
ford Bookstore rates with the
best in the country.

Office space is minimal and
scattered throughout the store,
tucked into every available cor

ner. The lack of centralization
causes even further inefficiency.
On top of this, office space
sometimes doubles as storage
space. The desk of the general
book department manager con
sists mainly of shelves full of
books — replacements for titles
already on display.
The storeroom for stationery
and supplies is adequate during
most of the year. But at the start
of each quarter when spiral note
books are sold in huge quantities,
the room just cannot handle the
volume, and the supply must be
replenished daily from tempor
ary storage space in Meyer Li
brary.
This space in the library is also
used to keep texts that arrive for
the following quarter long be
fore they can be put on the
shelves.
This happens because to en
sure delivery by the start of
the quarter, books must be
ordered three months in
advance. The texts arrive
throughout the three months,
however, and must be kept
somewhere until they are need
ed.
What makes the situation
worse is that the Bookstore will
soon have to relinquish this li
brary space, which will be con
verted into stacks.
What is barely tolerfeble now
will become even worse in a
few years, Kimball predicts, be
cause of the projected growth
of the student body.
To prepare for future needs,
the board of directors of the
Bookstore received permission
from the University in 1966 to
expand the store.
But the exact method, namely
adding on to the present build
ing or erecting a second struc
ture, was not specified.
A cost study was carried out,
and projected estimates of need
ed space were made. But because
of the lapse of time and the con

tinuing inflation, the business of
fice asked for another cost
study, which is presently being
conducted.
Applying a basic rule of thumb
approved by the National Asso
ciation of College Stores for a
school with between 12,000 and
15,000 students, three square
feet of space for books and sup
plies per student is optimal, Stan
ford's store is presently far
smaller than it should be.
Using this rule, the Book
store should have more than
37,000 square feet available.
It has only a total of 19,000
square feet, 3,000 of which can
not be used for books and sup
plies.
But in other ways, the Stan
ford Bookstore rates with the
best in the country.
A survey way made several
years ago of the amount of mon
ey spent on books by students at
various universities. The method
was rather crude, merely divid
ing the total book sales by the
number of students.
The results showed Stanford
as the fourth highest in the
country, behind Harvard, Yale,
and Princeton.
According to Kimball this is
not an indication of too many
assigned texts here or over
priced books, but rather of the
large general book department
here and at the three mentioned
Ivy League schools.
Having a large selection of
non-text books seems to be a
goal that other college book
stores would like to reach.
Robert Kennedy, manager of
the Cal bookstore, believes "the
Stanford Bookstore, at this point
at least, is more book-oriented
than our store, and in my opin
ion this is quite an asset."
"It is a direction to which we
hope to point in the not too
distant future."
The setup at Cal is quite dif
ferent from here, however. The

Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California (ASUC)
owns the bookstore, and all pro
fits return to the ASUC for use
in student activities.
Therefore, since the money in
effect is returned to the students
in some form, the bookstore
gives no student discount. Teach
ing faculty get a ten per cent re
bate.
San Jose State's bookstore also
has no discount to students, and
a ten per cent savings for the
faculty. The manager there, Har
ry Wineroth, is also somewhat
envious of Stanford's store.
He feels that Stanford has
"a real good bookstore. I'd be
very happy to have a setup
like that, but we just don't
have the space."
Some other college stores give
student discounts, some larger
than Stanford, but because the
amount of sales to non-univer
sity community members at
these schools is large, the per
centage of total sales which are
refunded are as a rule lower
than that here, namely seven
per cent.
Also, those with larger dis
counts garner additional revenue
from co-op membership fees —
and only members are eligible
for discounts from list prices.
Therefore, by all standards,
Stanford's Bookstore compares
favorably with almost all others
in the way it treats its cus
tomers — the students, faculty,
and staff.
But there is always the ques
tion of whether the Bookstore
should have to make a profit to
put into expansion, or if the Uni
versity should pay for all build
ing.
The Bookstore's profits are
still declining, however, and this
question may no longer be an
issue unless the store can ex
pand, thereby becoming more ef
ficient and increasing profits
again.
The Stanford Bookstore moved
into a big, new, modern build
ing in 1960, and has already out
grown the structure.
The reason: a 32 per cent in
crease in the size of the student
body since the store was erected.
When the new Bookstore
was planned, it was slated to
have a full basement for stor
age. According to the store's
manager, William Kimball,
this "was cut to a half-base
ment, then to a quarter-base
ment, then to none at all."
And now he sorely needs the
space.
The loading and unloading
area wasn't adequate even when
the Bookstore moved into the
new building, Kimball asserts.
During the period when books
are arriving for the beginning
of-the-quarter rush, the receiv
ing and handling room is insuf
ficient to keep even the books
that have arrived and are wait
ing to be sorted and still allow
people to work.
So during this period, the
books are moved outside onto
the loading platform during the
day, and returned to the receiv
ing room at night, causing extra
delay and therefore extra ex
pense.
Other areas, adequate in the
past, are reaching the saturation
point and will soon be inadequ
ate to handle the activity.
In the textbook department
on the mezzanine, skids have
been placed along the rail to
hold extra books. The section

continue to grow, the Book
store will soon run out of

like that, but we just don't
have the space."
Some other college stores give
student discounts, some larger
than Stanford, but because the
amount of sales to non-univer
sity community members at
these schools is large, the per
centage of total sales which are
refunded are as a rule lower
than that here, namely seven
per cent.
Also, those with larger dis
counts garner additional revenue
from co-op membership fees —
and only members are eligible
for discounts from list prices.
Therefore, by all standards,
Stanford's Bookstore compares
favorably with almost all others
in the way it treats its cus
tomers — the students, faculty,
and staff.
But there is always the ques
tion of whether the Bookstore
should have to make a profit to
put into expansion, or if the Uni
versity should pay for all build
ing.
The Bookstore's profits are
still declining, however, and this
question may no longer be an
issue unless the store can ex
pand, thereby becoming more ef
ficient and increasing profits
again.
The Stanford Bookstore moved
into a big, new, modern build
ing in 1960, and has already out
grown the structure.
The reason: a 32 per cent in
crease in the size of the student
body since the store was erected.
When the new Bookstore
was planned, it was slated to
have a full basement for stor
age. According to the store's
manager, William Kimball,
this "was cut to a half-base
ment, then to a quarter-base
ment, then to none at all."
And now he sorely needs the
space.
The loading and unloading
area wasn't adequate even when
the Bookstore moved into the
new building, Kimball asserts.
During the period when books
are arriving for the beginning
of-the-quarter rush, the receiv
ing and handling room is insuf
ficient to keep even the books
that have arrived and are wait
ing to be sorted and still allow
people to work.
So during this period, the
books are moved outside onto
the loading platform during the
day, and returned to the receiv
ing room at night, causing extra
delay and therefore extra ex
pense.
Other areas, adequate in the
past, are reaching the saturation
point and will soon be inadequ
ate to handle the activity.
In the textbook department
on the mezzanine, skids have
been placed along the rail to
hold extra books. The section
Is barely holding its own now,
and if enrollment and courses
continue to grow, the Book
store will soon run out of
space to display the texts.
Office space is minimal and
scattered throughout the store,
tucked into every available cor

ner. The lack of centralization
causes even further inefficiency.
On top of this, office space
sometimes doubles as storage
space. The desk of the general
book department manager con
sists mainly of shelves full of
books — replacements for titles
already on display.
The storeroom for stationery
and supplies is adequate during
most of the year. But at the start
of each quarter when spiral note
books are sold in huge quantities,
the room just cannot handle the
volume, and the supply must be
replenished daily from tempor
ary storage space in Meyer Li
brary.
This space in the library is also
used to keep texts that arrive for
the following quarter long be
fore they can be put on the
shelves.
This happens because to en
sure delivery by the start of
the quarter, books must be
ordered three months in
advance. The texts arrive
throughout the three months,
however, and must be kept
somewhere until they are need
ed.
What makes the situation
worse is that the Bookstore will
soon have to relinquish this li
brary space, which will be con
verted into stacks.
What is barely tolerfeble now
will become even worse in a
few years, Kimball predicts, be
cause of the projected growth
of the student body.
To prepare for future needs,
the board of directors of the
Bookstore received permission
from the University in 1966 to
expand the store.
But the exact method, namely
adding on to the present build
ing or erecting a second struc
ture, was not specified.
A cost study was carried out,
and projected estimates of need
ed space were made. But because
of the lapse of time and the con

tinuing inflation, the business of
fice asked for another cost
study, which is presently being
conducted.
Applying a basic rule of thumb
approved by the National Asso
ciation of College Stores for a
school with between 12,000 and
15,000 students, three square
feet of space for books and sup
plies per student is optimal, Stan
ford's store is presently far
smaller than it should be.
Using this rule, the Book
store should have more than
37,000 square feet available.
It has only a total of 19,000
square feet, 3,000 of which can
not be used for books and sup
plies.
But in other ways, the Stan
ford Bookstore rates with the
best in the country.
A survey way made several
years ago of the amount of mon
ey spent on books by students at
various universities. The method
was rather crude, merely divid
ing the total book sales by the
number of students.
The results showed Stanford
as the fourth highest in the
country, behind Harvard, Yale,
and Princeton.
According to Kimball this is
not an indication of too many
assigned texts here or over
priced books, but rather of the
large general book department
here and at the three mentioned
Ivy League schools.
Having a large selection of
non-text books seems to be a
goal that other college book
stores would like to reach.
Robert Kennedy, manager of
the Cal bookstore, believes "the
Stanford Bookstore, at this point
at least, is more book-oriented
than our store, and in my opin
ion this is quite an asset."
"It is a direction to which we
hope to point in the not too
distant future."
The setup at Cal is quite dif
ferent from here, however. The

Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California (ASUC)
owns the bookstore, and all pro
fits return to the ASUC for use
in student activities.
Therefore, since the money in
effect is returned to the students
in some form, the bookstore
gives no student discount. Teach
ing faculty get a ten per cent re
bate.
San Jose State's bookstore also
has no discount to students, and
a ten per cent savings for the
faculty. The manager there, Har
ry Wineroth, is also somewhat
envious of Stanford's store.
He feels that Stanford has
"a real good bookstore. I'd be
very happy to have a setup
like that, but we just don't
have the space."
Some other college stores give
student discounts, some larger
than Stanford, but because the
amount of sales to non-univer
sity community members at
