# Doctors Cite New Progress With Plastic In Virus Control
## 
### 
Scientists have found a syn
thetic plastic which powerfully
stimulates production of human
interferon, a natural antiviral
substance that holds promise as
an approach to control of a wide
range of virus infections.
Work by Dr. Thomas C. Meri
gan at the Stanford School of
Medicine and by Dr. William
Regelson, formerly of Roswell
Park Memorial Institute in Buf
falo and now at the Medical
College of Virginia, has shown
that pyran, a plastic manufac
tured by Hercules Company of
Wilmington, Deleware, is taken
up by the body's system which
is the source of native inter
feron.
Interferon is a protein which
is normally produced by cells
in the body to limit the spread
of virus infection.
Merigan and Regelson have
shown pyran to be active
against a leukemia-producing
virus in mice and to have a po
tent and prolonged antiviral ef
fect against a polio-like virus
in mice. A single injection had
a protective effect for two
months, they reported.
The two investigators also
confirmed that pyran had in
duced interferon in cancer pa
tients participating in a cooper
ative study conducted by sev
eral hospitals on the East Coast.
"The studies demonstrate the
ability of man to respond to
nonviral agents like pyran with
circulating interferon," Dr. Mer
igan stated in an editorial in
the December issue of the Am
erican Journal of Medicine, and
in a detailed report co-authored
with Dr. Regelson in the De
cember 14 issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine.
"We stand on the threshold
of an era that may see chemo
therapeutic and other non-im
munologic methods for control

of virus infections in humans
become as commonplace as the
use of antibiotics against bac
terial infections," Dr. Merigan
predicted.
Ever since its discovery in
1957, interferon has been con
sidered to have potential value
in the control of virus disease
in man, ranging from the most
deadly virus infections to the

common cold, for which no vac
cines or chemical weapons are
presently available.
Researchers had hoped that
relatively harmless viruses
could purposefully be intro
duced in patients to stimulate
interferon production, or else
that interferon might be puri
fied from animal tissues for
clinical use.
