Stanford will get $5 million
from the estate of the late Kath
erine Dexter McCormick, it was
reported last week from Santa
Barbara.
University officials confirmed
that attorneys had notified them

they would be among the bene
ficiaries of Mrs. McCormick's
estate.
The Associated Press reported
that Mrs. McCormick's attorney,
James Black, had said Stanford
would receive $5 million, destin
ed for the Medical School.
Mrs. McCormick died Dec. 28
in Boston at 92. She was the wi

an estate of $30 million. The will
was filed for probate in Superior
Court in Santa Barbara, where
she lived.
Black said the bulk of the
estate will go to Massachusetts

it should be substantially more
than the $5 million willed to both
Stanford and the Planned Par
