# Investment Club Shows Big Profits
## 
### 
Since reorganization in late
November the Graduate School
of Business Investment Club
has recorded more than a 22%
profit according to Bill Rogers,
Club Treasurer. While it is too
early to compare such perfor
mance with any mutual fund,
prospects for the future seem
bright.
Late in November the Invest
ment Club assumed manage
ment of the Herman Crown Col
lege Investment League Fund,
a national non-prifit organiza
tion established to provide
money management opportun
ities to college students. These
funds were previously divided
among several campus organi
zations.
Unlike other Investment clubs,
only donated funds are involved,
and profits are never distributed
to the members. At the present
time the Crown Fund provides
all the money that the club has
at its disposal (about $10,000).
By directing profitable man
agement of the funds given to
the club, the Herman Crown
Trust seeks to develop the busi
nessman, financier and entrepre

neur of tomorrow's community.
Club president is John Scully,
graduate in the Business School
and the man who successfully
competed with ASSU in flying
students home over the Christ
mas holidays at the lowest pos
sible fare.
The present portfolio consist?
of a dividend of a diversified
holding of about 15 stocks, the
favored fields to be consumer
services, office equipment and
specialized electronic firms. A
majority of these investments
are over-the-counter stocks, and
none are listed on the New
York Stock Exchange. Empha
sis seems to be placed on the
small, well-managed company
with a good profits record that
might be subject to merger or
could be the Control Data or
IBM of the future.
The club is loosely organized
and run according to the one
man-one vote principle. Mem
bership is free, now open to all
students, and requires only
nominal attendance at weekly
meetings. Weekly meetings are
held in Room 49 at the Graduate
School of Business Tuesdays be
tween 12 and 1 p.m.
