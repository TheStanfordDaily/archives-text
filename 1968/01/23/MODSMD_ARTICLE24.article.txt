# Paper Claims SRI Involved In S. Asia
## 
### 
A radical twice-monthly news
paper published yesterday what
it claims are details of the Stan
ford Research Institute's count
erinsurgency study in Thailand.
The "Midpeninsula Observer"
says SRI has 55 staff members
working in Thailand as part of
"Project Agile," a Pentagon con
tract involving several U.S. uni
versities.
The SRI employees in Thai
land include operations analysts,
statisticians, anthropologists, so
ciologists, economists and logist
ic and transport specialists, the
Observer reports. It gives SRI
Vice President H. E. Roblson as
a source for this information.
SRI is an affiliate of Stanford
University under a separate
board of directors. The Institute,
based in Menlo Park, is engaged
in many government and indus
trial research projects.
Enemy Detection
The Observer says SRl's-Thai
land work includes testing de
vices which "sniff an enemy's
presence," writing ethnographies
of areas of potential insurgency,
advising on military and para
military communications needs,
and reports on Communist guer
rilla activities in southern Thai
land.
At the 22nd annual meeting of
SRI Associates in San Francisco
Dec. 14, the Observer reports
that W. R. Vincent, manager of
SRl's communications labora
tory, described SRl's work in
placing electronic devices under
ground in Thailand to detect
movement on nearby trails.
Vincent explained that "the
only trouble is that we haven't
found a way to tell the differ
ence between men and animals,"
the Observer reported.
SRI scientists are also testing
the Varian Rubidium Vapor
Magnetometer, developed by
Varian Associates of Palo Alto,
for use in "detecting quantities
of iron of a size comparable to
insurgent weapons," according
to the Observer.
Dual Contract
SRl's Project Agile participa
tion has been under two main
contracts. One, entitled SEA
SURE, began in 1964 and con
cerned "investigation of counter
guerrilla surveillance processes."
The other, entitled SEACORE,

began in 1962 and has concerned
'.Research • Engineering and
Support for Tropical Communi
cations."
According to the Observer,
both began as counter-insur
gency research and development
programs for Vietnam, but with
the increase in guerrilla activity
in Thailand, both have been con
cerned with building the counter
insurgency capabilities of the
Thai military and collecting data
which will put the U.S. in a
"knowledgeable position" should
"large-scale intervention in Thai
land ever be called for."
SRI has advised the Pentagon
that the Thai Provincial Police
and the Border Patrol Police
communications systems would
need "substantial enlargement"
to put down "medium-level insur
gency" in the northeast, the Ob
server claims.
The Observer article was writ
ten by David Ransom, co-editor.
Research was conducted by Stan
ford undergraduates Chris
Harte, Jeff Browning, Mary Han
son, John Kelich and others.

SRI scientists are also testing
the Varian Rubidium Vapor
Magnetometer, developed by
Varian Associates of Palo Alto,
for use in "detecting quantities
of iron of a size comparable to
insurgent weapons," according
to the Observer.
Dual Contract
SRl's Project Agile participa
tion has been under two main
contracts. One, entitled SEA
SURE, began in 1964 and con
cerned "investigation of counter
guerrilla surveillance processes."
The other, entitled SEACORE,

began in 1962 and has concerned
'.Research • Engineering and
Support for Tropical Communi
cations."
According to the Observer,
both began as counter-insur
gency research and development
programs for Vietnam, but with
the increase in guerrilla activity
in Thailand, both have been con
cerned with building the counter
insurgency capabilities of the
Thai military and collecting data
which will put the U.S. in a
"knowledgeable position" should
"large-scale intervention in Thai
land ever be called for."
SRI has advised the Pentagon
that the Thai Provincial Police
and the Border Patrol Police
communications systems would
need "substantial enlargement"
to put down "medium-level insur
gency" in the northeast, the Ob
server claims.
The Observer article was writ
ten by David Ransom, co-editor.
Research was conducted by Stan
ford undergraduates Chris
Harte, Jeff Browning, Mary Han
son, John Kelich and others.
A radical twice-monthly news
paper published yesterday what
it claims are details of the Stan
ford Research Institute's count
erinsurgency study in Thailand.
The "Midpeninsula Observer"
says SRI has 55 staff members
working in Thailand as part of
"Project Agile," a Pentagon con
tract involving several U.S. uni
versities.
The SRI employees in Thai
land include operations analysts,
statisticians, anthropologists, so
ciologists, economists and logist
ic and transport specialists, the
Observer reports. It gives SRI
Vice President H. E. Roblson as
a source for this information.
SRI is an affiliate of Stanford
University under a separate
board of directors. The Institute,
based in Menlo Park, is engaged
in many government and indus
trial research projects.
Enemy Detection
The Observer says SRl's-Thai
land work includes testing de
vices which "sniff an enemy's
presence," writing ethnographies
of areas of potential insurgency,
advising on military and para
military communications needs,
and reports on Communist guer
rilla activities in southern Thai
land.
At the 22nd annual meeting of
SRI Associates in San Francisco
Dec. 14, the Observer reports
that W. R. Vincent, manager of
SRl's communications labora
tory, described SRl's work in
placing electronic devices under
ground in Thailand to detect
movement on nearby trails.
Vincent explained that "the
only trouble is that we haven't
found a way to tell the differ
ence between men and animals,"
the Observer reported.
