# Front Line Averages 6-7
## Sig Behemoths Terrorize IM Courts 
### JOHN WRIGHT 
A tall, talented Sigma Chi
team has totally dominated the
opening week's action in intra
mural basketball.
With two crushing victories al
ready under their collective belts,
125-23 over the Alpha Delts and
92-27 over Theta Xi, the Sigs give
no indication of showing their
opponents any mercy.

A devastating full-court press
throughout the game, 6-11 center
Larry Rosenzweig's control of
the boards, and a balanced scor
ing attack accounting for the
demolition of the Alpha Delts.
Theta Xi, despite catching Sig
ma Chi on an "off" night, suc
cumed in a smilarly convincing
manner.
Rosenzweig, a sophomore who

started at center on last year's
freshman team and stands four
inches taller than anyone pres
ently on the Stanford Varsity,
is by no means a one-man team.
Balance
Bob Mallek and Pat Canfield,
a pair of 6-5 forwards, plus
guards Rolland Regnery, John
Tracy, and Steve Scott, who
plays both forward and guard,
are all averaging at least fif
teen points per game.
The only thing the Sigs lack
is depth. With just six players on
the squad, injuries could pose
problems later in the season.
Regnery, a senior, was the
third guard behind Art Harris
and Gary Petersmeyer on the
freshman team of three years
ago, while Mallek, a junior, saw
action with the varsity last sea
son.
Scott, Tracy, and Canfield also
played on the freshman squad
at one time, and have consider
able competitive experience.
"Second String"
Amazingly enough, the second
strongest team also is composed
of Sigma Chi's. The team plays
in the off-campus league under
the name of the Plainsmen.
Buck Westfall, Bruce Cass,
Jerry Dover, John Steele, Herb
Hill, Tom Hill, A 1 Yost are all
off-campus Sig affiliates.

In their first game, they anni
hilated the Hatchett Squad 78-7.
That brings the totals for the
three games to the staggering
total of 195-57, which works out
an average of about 98-19.
Other Action
With over a hundred teams
participating, intramural basket
ball rates as the most popular

winter sport in the Stanford IM
program.
Seventy-eight "A" teams and
25 "B" teams are competing in a
total of eighteen leagues.
Round-robin play will continue
through February 22, and the
top two teams from each lea
gue qualify for the single eli
mination tournament, which will
begin February 26.

three games to the staggering
total of 195-57, which works out
an average of about 98-19.

With over a hundred teams
participating, intramural basket
ball rates as the most popular

winter sport in the Stanford IM
program.
Seventy-eight "A" teams and
25 "B" teams are competing in a
total of eighteen leagues.
Round-robin play will continue
through February 22, and the
top two teams from each lea
gue qualify for the single eli
mination tournament, which will
begin February 26.
A tall, talented Sigma Chi
team has totally dominated the
opening week's action in intra
mural basketball.
With two crushing victories al
ready under their collective belts,
125-23 over the Alpha Delts and
92-27 over Theta Xi, the Sigs give
no indication of showing their
opponents any mercy.

A devastating full-court press
throughout the game, 6-11 center
Larry Rosenzweig's control of
the boards, and a balanced scor
ing attack accounting for the
demolition of the Alpha Delts.
Theta Xi, despite catching Sig
ma Chi on an "off" night, suc
cumed in a smilarly convincing
manner.
Rosenzweig, a sophomore who

started at center on last year's
freshman team and stands four
inches taller than anyone pres
ently on the Stanford Varsity,
is by no means a one-man team.
Balance
Bob Mallek and Pat Canfield,
a pair of 6-5 forwards, plus
guards Rolland Regnery, John
Tracy, and Steve Scott, who
plays both forward and guard,
are all averaging at least fif
teen points per game.
The only thing the Sigs lack
is depth. With just six players on
the squad, injuries could pose
problems later in the season.
Regnery, a senior, was the
third guard behind Art Harris
and Gary Petersmeyer on the
freshman team of three years
ago, while Mallek, a junior, saw
action with the varsity last sea
son.
Scott, Tracy, and Canfield also
played on the freshman squad
at one time, and have consider
able competitive experience.
"Second String"
Amazingly enough, the second
strongest team also is composed
of Sigma Chi's. The team plays
in the off-campus league under
the name of the Plainsmen.
Buck Westfall, Bruce Cass,
Jerry Dover, John Steele, Herb
Hill, Tom Hill, A 1 Yost are all
off-campus Sig affiliates.

In their first game, they anni
hilated the Hatchett Squad 78-7.
That brings the totals for the
three games to the staggering
total of 195-57, which works out
an average of about 98-19.
