## More Money, Less Sport 
### Dave Noland 
Well, it's almost Valentine's Day, and you know what that means,
sports fans. The professional football season is over.
The Super Bowl has now passed into history, along with the Pro
Bowl, the Playoff Bowl, the NFL Championship Game, two divi
sion playoffs, and 14 consecutive TV Sunday double-headers. And
that's just the NFL, for Pete's sake! (Rozelle, of course).
Yes, our great autumn spectacle has finished another fiscal year
(oops, season), and frankly, it's about time.
We had wistful hopes that the capitalists of pro football would
somehow retain their modicum of concern for football as an ath
letic event, as sport for sport's sake. But the new league alignment
and the endless schedule indicate that they're following the lead (?)
of their brethern in other sports.
The capitalists of baseball expanded to 162 games, necessitating
that absudity of all absurdities, the asterisk. What did they get
for their trouble? Worn out pitching staffs and an extra Tuesday
afternoon game every other week. (Average attendance, 1,017, in
cluding ushers.)
The capitalists of basketball now have a schedule that Includes an
incredible 80 games, plus the most absurd playoff system ever de
vised by Western Man.
Unfortunately, pro football is headed down that same road to
more money and less sport.
Just once, couldn't somebody sacrifice quantity and extra profit
for quality and the extra excitement of knowing that "this is the big
one"? Starting with this year's Rams-Colts game, the NFL had no
less than five "big ones," all on consecutive weekends. By the time
the Super Bowl finally came around, we couldn't have cared less.
Mr. Rozelle, just take a look at the Beatles. They make just one
album and maybe two singles a year and have lots of money and
class. The Monkees crank out endless streams of music and have
lots of money.
Please, pro football. Show me a little class.

One of the numbers members of the Stanford golf team was
playing a practice round the other day. He was faced with a sidehill
putt of about six feet on the fourth green, which is near the inter
section of Sandhill Road and Junipero Serra.
After lengthy, intense concentration, he stroked it bravely into
the back of the cup.
The instant the ball disappeared, a thunderous ovation exploded
behind him. The amazed golfer turned to see a charter bus load of
cheering, clapping, whistling spectators expressing their apprecia
tion of his effort while waiting for a stoplight.
The astonished golfer, caught in the spirit of the occasion, bowed
expansively and tossed the ball dramatically in the direction of
the bus. If he'd had a cap, I'm sure he would have doffed it.
Walking to the fifth tee as the madly cheering bus pulled away,
he commented, "That's the biggest gallery I've ever had in my life,"
and proceeded to take a triple bogey seven.

We had wistful hopes that the capitalists of pro football would
somehow retain their modicum of concern for football as an ath
letic event, as sport for sport's sake. But the new league alignment
and the endless schedule indicate that they're following the lead (?)
of their brethern in other sports.
The capitalists of baseball expanded to 162 games, necessitating
that absudity of all absurdities, the asterisk. What did they get
for their trouble? Worn out pitching staffs and an extra Tuesday
afternoon game every other week. (Average attendance, 1,017, in
cluding ushers.)
The capitalists of basketball now have a schedule that Includes an
incredible 80 games, plus the most absurd playoff system ever de
vised by Western Man.
Unfortunately, pro football is headed down that same road to
more money and less sport.
Just once, couldn't somebody sacrifice quantity and extra profit
for quality and the extra excitement of knowing that "this is the big
one"? Starting with this year's Rams-Colts game, the NFL had no
less than five "big ones," all on consecutive weekends. By the time
the Super Bowl finally came around, we couldn't have cared less.
Mr. Rozelle, just take a look at the Beatles. They make just one
album and maybe two singles a year and have lots of money and
class. The Monkees crank out endless streams of music and have
lots of money.
Please, pro football. Show me a little class.

One of the numbers members of the Stanford golf team was
playing a practice round the other day. He was faced with a sidehill
putt of about six feet on the fourth green, which is near the inter
section of Sandhill Road and Junipero Serra.
After lengthy, intense concentration, he stroked it bravely into
the back of the cup.
The instant the ball disappeared, a thunderous ovation exploded
behind him. The amazed golfer turned to see a charter bus load of
cheering, clapping, whistling spectators expressing their apprecia
tion of his effort while waiting for a stoplight.
The astonished golfer, caught in the spirit of the occasion, bowed
expansively and tossed the ball dramatically in the direction of
the bus. If he'd had a cap, I'm sure he would have doffed it.
Walking to the fifth tee as the madly cheering bus pulled away,
he commented, "That's the biggest gallery I've ever had in my life,"
and proceeded to take a triple bogey seven.
Well, it's almost Valentine's Day, and you know what that means,
sports fans. The professional football season is over.
The Super Bowl has now passed into history, along with the Pro
Bowl, the Playoff Bowl, the NFL Championship Game, two divi
sion playoffs, and 14 consecutive TV Sunday double-headers. And
that's just the NFL, for Pete's sake! (Rozelle, of course).
Yes, our great autumn spectacle has finished another fiscal year
(oops, season), and frankly, it's about time.
