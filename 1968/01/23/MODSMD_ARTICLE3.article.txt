# Sterling's Class, Napier's Capacity
## 
### 
"Corn flakes are good for
Wallace Sterling," proclaims
the advertisement in Bride
Magazine. The pert Stanford
senior, contemplating her wed
ding gifts, is moved to recog
nition and decides that if Stan
ford's President eats corn flakes,
so will she.
Over the past few years, the
Wallace Sterling company has
advertised with comments such
as "Only Wallace Sterling looks
good from all angles." A few
years ago, the company sent a
silver plate to Dr. Sterling,
thanking him for being such a
good sport.
Another Stanford celebrity
made news in a recent issue of
the New Yorker. We are in
formed that Napier holds full
jigger or half-jigger.
Well, if the academic com
munity insists that you publish,
this is one way to do it.
