# Lacrosse Team Readying
## 
### 
The lacrosse team has already
begun practice sessions in prep
aration for its upcoming season.
Held on Monday, Wednesday and
Thursday afternoons on the la
crosse field from 4:15-5:30, the
sessions serve as instructional
clinics for beginners and lossen
ing-up periods for returning let
termen.
Starting two weeks before
Dead Week, the sessions will
take on a more serious air as
the full team will hold four-day
per-week sessions in preparation
for the season's opener against
the University of Utah the day
after Finals Week.
The major changes this year
will include the appointment of
a new head coach.
Don Ronayne will succeed Bob

Barton and the addition of con
siderable depth as fifteen frosh
attempt to get starting positions
on the already strong team.
Returning from last year are
seventeen lettermen, nine of
whom were starters on last
year's Northern California
Championship team. But Coach
Ronayne has made it clear, as
befitting his training as a third
year student in the Law School,
that, "There is no such thing as
a firm position on this team.
Everybody will have to work
hard to play as a regular here."
On the schedule are games
with the University of Utah, Den
ver University, Claremont Col
lege, the Air Force Academy,
Cal, Marin County, San Fran
cisco Lacrosse Club, and the
Palo Alto Lacrosse Club.
