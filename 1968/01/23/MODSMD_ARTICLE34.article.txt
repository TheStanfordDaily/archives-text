# Cornell May Cut Ties To Defense Lab
## 
### 
ITHACA, N.Y. (CPS) — In the
midst of national criticism of uni
versities who do military re
search, Cornell University may
sever connections with its mili
tary research arm.
A committee appointed by the
university's board of trustees has
recommended separation be
tween Cornell and Cornell Aero
nautical Laboratory (CAL).
More than two-thirds of CAL's
$30 million in research is per
formed under contracts from the
Defense Department. About half
of the military work is classified.
The committee gave three rea
sons for its recommendations:
lack of significant educational
and research interaction between
the university and CAL, the need
to provide the laboratory with
an effective independent board
of directors, and the overlap and
potential conflict between CAL's
increasing overseas research
projects and the university's ex
panding program of internation
al studies.
On this latter point the com
mittee said, "International scho
lars can only work effectively if
it is clear to everyone, and most
particularly to the people in the
countries involved, that their
goal is pure scholarship. Hence,
a defense - oriented CAL applied
research program operated un
der Cornell's name constitutes a
serious threat to the viability of
these Cornell programs."
Cornell faculty members will
vote on the report Jan. 15 and
the final decision from the board
of trustees will come on Jan. 20.
