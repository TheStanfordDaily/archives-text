# Brain Study Talk Tonight
## 
### 
David Krech, professor of psy
chology at Berkeley, will discuss
brain research at 7:30 tonight in
the Tresidder large lounge. The
speech is part of the continuing
Century 21 series.
Krech will examine the ef
fects of chemical enhancement
of intelligence on social, educa
tional, and ethical life. Krech is
now involved in research on the
relationship between chemistry
and learning.
This research may lead to the
creation of chemicals to stimu
late the mentally retarded, as
well as increase the learning po
tential of a normal mind. The
Berkeley professor is expected
to make some predictions on the
practical application of this re
search in the near future.
