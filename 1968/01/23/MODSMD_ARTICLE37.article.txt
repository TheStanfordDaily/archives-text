# Harvard Students Urge Peace Moves
## 
### 
A majority of Harvard Univer
sity and Radcliffe College under
graduates have signed a state
ment calling on President John
son to de-escalate the war in
Vietnam.
It also urged the Administra
tion to be prepared to accept
a settlement in which the Na
tional Liberation Front, the po
litical arm of the Vietcong,
"would participate along with
other groups in the political life
of South Vietnam."
A student-faculty Ad Hoc Com
mittee on Vietnam, which in
cluded Prof. Edwin O. Rei
schauer of Harvard, former
United States Ambassador to
Japan, said Tuesday that 3,077
Harvard and Radcliffe students,
representing 51 per cent of the
undergraduates, had signed the
statement.
The committee said those who
had signed also included 338

members, or 54 per cent, of the
Harvard faculty of arts and sci
ences, and 772 "other Harvard
students, faculty and staff."
Professor Reischauer, who
served as a spokesman for the
committee, said that the state
ment "was certainly not ex
treme, either way."
The statement was sent by
telegram to the President. It
said in part:
"We believe that the Admin
istration's conduct of the war
has not been sufficiently di
rected toward the attainment of
a settlement.
"We urge the Administra
tion to refrain from futher es
calation of the war, and to make
serious and sustained efforts, in
cluding de-escalation, to reach a
negotiated settlement."
Eleven students and 11 fac
ulty members were listed on the
Ad Hoc Committee.
