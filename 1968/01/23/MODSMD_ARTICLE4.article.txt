# Sarnoff To Biz Grads: Aid Government Effort
## 
### NICK SELBY 
RCA president Robert W.
Sarnoff last night painted a
bright picture for the future of
businessmen, but warned that
the United States stands "on
the rim of a volcano of social
unrest" in a speech to the Stu
dent Association of the Gradu
ate School of Business.
"We can begin to see at every
level of management, from the
smallest to the largest enter
prise, heightened opportunity
for individual fulfillment and ad
vancement," Sarnoff said.
He called the idea that busi
nessmen can not significantly
contribute to the betterment of
society as a stereotype which
exists "largely in the imagina
tion."
SarnofT explained that,
above all, leadership from
skilled managers In the pri
vate sector of the economy
was necessary "to douse and
contain fires of urban vio
lence."
a combined and reso
lute effort by every segment of
our society" will solve our social
problems, the 49 year old presi
dent said.
Citing new approaches to
these problems, Sarnoff claimed
the modern corporation "is now
making a meaningful contribu
tion." He said that urban
blight, faulty education, pov
erty, and pollution have grown
"dismally familiar", and that
business and government will
not be able to solve them work
ing separately.
But, he continued, "new re
lationships between business
and government are already
taking shape." Sarnoff said
companies were helping finance
and construct urban housing
in depressed areas, and added
that his own company was har
nessing computers to education,
thus enabling us to "close the
knowledge gap that now con
demns far too many people to
the welfare rolls."
In response to questions after

his speech, Sarnoff described
many welfare recipients as "un
employables, who don't know
how to learn." He said the gov
ernment must initiate programs
to help them, but that these
programs could not succeed
without the support of business.
He explained that computers
were a major answer to help
ing these people, and he claimed
that the new RCA computer
assisted instruction center in
Palo Alto was proving that such
educational aids were already
financially and practically feas
ible.
Sarnoff based his hopes for
progress entirely on the profit
system, nationally and inter
nationally. "I have hopes that
the international businessman
may yet succeed where the
international statesmen have
so often failed."
Sarnoff also stated after his
speech that he was very un
happy with the proposed limita
tions on American spending
abroad. "I hope it was a short
term measure," h? said, "be
cause it would be very unfor
tunate if American companies
were not able to expand glob
ally."
Decentralization will in turn
permit greater lateral and up
ward movement within the cor
poration because managers at
the local level will have access
to information needed for de
cision making.
Sarnoff claimed that the
ground rules of business are
shifting from an emphasis on
goods and the "hardsell" to a
reliance on services to "softsell"
the product, making the United
States "the world's first service
oriented economy."
Sarnoff elaborated the conse
quences of technological advan
ces for businessmen. Communi
cations satellites and computers,
for example, have helped effect
a complete transformation of
communications, thus making
unlimited worldwide communi
cations a reality and allowing

management to be everywhere
at once.
As a result, the growth of
larger "conglomerate" enter
prises will aoeelerate, while
their operations decentralize
without loss of coordination.
Sarnoff, the son of RCA foun
der and chairman Gen. David
Sarnoff, was president of the
National Broadcasting Corpor
ation from 1956-65 and became
president of RCA last year.
About 400 people heard the
speech in the Cabana Hotel in
Palo Alto.
