## Lunar Module I Blasts Off For Punishing Engine Test 
### 
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. (AP)
—Lunar Module I, forerunner
of the spaceship expected to fer
ry U.S. astronauts to and from
the moon's surface next year,
rocketed into earth orbit Mon
day for a punishing test of its
landing and takeoff engines.
Guided by a computer directed
robot nicknamed the "mechanic
al boy" the 16-ton unmanned
mooncraft thundered away
from Cape Kennedy at 5:48
p.m. (EST) aboard the famed
181-foot tall Saturn I rocket
which was grounded one year
ago by the Apollo I fire that
killed three astronauts.
The powerful Saturn I, weigh
ing more than 650 tons on lift
off, performed flawlessly as it
ended a 16-month stint on the
launch pad. It initially hurled
the bug-like Lunar Module, still
attached to the rocket's last
stage, into an earth orbit 100 to
138 miles high.
Later in the Alight the space
craft will perform a series of

tests to determine if it is de
signed properly for the critical
job of ferrying astronauts to
and from the moon's surface.
• Wilson in Moscow
MOSCOW (AP) — Premier
Alexei N. Kosygin began a dis
cussion of world problems with
British Prime Minister Harold
Wilson Monday shortly after re
ceiving a secret American mes
sage, apparently from President
Johnson.
Wilson flew into frigid Mos
cow and immediately sat down
in the Kremlin for substantive
discussions.
Neither British nor Soviet offi
cials would specify which world
problems were covered in the
90-minute opening meeting but
Vietnam, Cambodia and the
Middle East were known to be
on the list of topics for Wilson's
51-hour visit.
And U.S. Embassy officials
and the Russians put a blanket
of silence over the purpose of
American Ambassador Llewel
lyn E. Thompson's 30-minute
Kremlin call on Kosygin.
• Gls Cross Border
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
United States acknowledged
Monday that a U.S.-Vietnamese
patrol had crossed Cambodia's
border "during the heat of bat
tle" with Viet Cong guerrillas.
The State Department said it
sent formal regrets for any
Cambodian casualties that may
have resulted from what it
called an unintended intrusion
75 yards inside Cambodian ter
ritory last Thursday.
Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
Cambodia's chief of state, has
demanded that the International
Control Commission investigate
the violation of his border and
the killing of three Cambodians
during the fight.
Robert J. McCloskey, State
Department press officer, said
the incidents occurred while an
American-South Vietnamese pa
trol was defending itself from
Viet Cong gunfire coming from
both sides of the Vietnam-Cam
bodian border.
• Tax Hike Pushed
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Johnson administration tried
Monday to speed congressional
approval of a tax increase by
outlining $3 billion in budget
cuts. But a Republican prompt
ly accused it of not demonstrat
ing real restraint in spending.

Secretary of the Treasury
Henry H. Fowler, pleading with
the House Ways and Means
Committee to approve a 10 per
cent income-tax surcharge, said
the cuts range from space to
highways — and that some will
be unpopular. All together, he
said, they do not save enough to
offset the need for higher taxes.
But Rep. John W. Byrnes of
Wisconsin, senior Republican
member of the committee, told
Fowler and other administra
tion witnesses their presentation
sounded to him like "business
as usual, and I don't think busi
ness as usual supports a tax
increase.
• /V. Laos Crumbles
LUANG PRABANG, Laos
(AP) — Fresh troops were de
ployed around Luang Prabang
on Monday but Laotian military
sources said resistance north of
the royal capital has crumbled
after the Communist victory at
Nam Bac.
These sources said all govern
ment posts had been abandoned
between Luang Prabang and
Nam Bac, 60 miles to the north
and the scene of a government
debacle Jan. 12. They reported
government control extends only
a few miles in each direction
from the royal capital.
Senior Laotian officers pre
dicted a major attack on the
royal capital by the North Viet
namese and Communist Pathet
Lao — estimated to number
about 1,200 men.
But this view was contradict
ed by Western sources in Vienti
ane, the administrative capital
to the south. They said the Com
munists have given clear signs
through third parties that they
did not want to risk all-out war
by attacking Luang Prabang,
where King Savang Vathana
has his court.
• 852 Goes Down
WASHINGTON (AP) — An
Air Force 852 bomber crashed
off Greenland Sunday plunging
perhaps four hydrogen bombs
through seven feet of ic£ and
into freezing northern waters,
government sources said Mon
day.
The Pentagon, announcing
bare-bone details of the accident,
said the devices were unarmed
"so there is no danger of a
nuclear explosion at the crash
site."
The Defense Department dis
closure of the crash came 18
hours after the 852 smacked
down near Thule, Greenland,
during ?n emergency-landing
approach. No explanation of the
delay was given.
Unconfirmed reports said the
$10-rnillion bomber was on fire.
Of seven crewmen aboard six
parachuted to safety and one
died of undisclosed causes.

COPENHAGEN, Denmark
(AP) — Foreign Minister Hans
Tabor reminded the United
States today that military
planes carrying nuclear weap
ons are not to fly over Green
land or any other Danish terri
tory.
The foreign minister's com
•ment followed Pentagon reports
on the crash of a 852 bomber
carrying nuclear weapons near
Thule Sunday.
Tabor explained that Danish
nuclear policy allows no nuclear
weapons on or over Danish ter
ritory, but that Pentagon re
ports established that in this in
stance it had been a case of an
emergency landing attempt in
an area with few air bases.
• Parties Certified
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The
anti-war Peace and Freedom
Party and the conservative
American Independent Party of
former Alabama Gov. George
Wallace will be on the Califor
nia ballot this year posing new
problems for the major parties.
Secretary of State Frank M.
Jordan announced Monday that
hard hitting registration drives
had paid off for both the minor
parties putting them well over
the 66,069 registration needed to
qualify.
At tin; same time, Jordan dis
closed that the Democratic par
ty has picked up 200,000 regis
trations since January 1967, and
now have 3,829,243 registered
voters. The Republicans gained
125,757, and have 2,934,061.
Democrats still outnumber Re
publicans by about 4-3.
Both of the new parties are
eligible for the primary in June
and the general election in No
vember.
The Peace and Freedom
Party had 105,263.
• Abortionists Heard
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—Dr.
J. Paul Shively, one of nine San
Francisco doctors who admitted
ly tried to prevent birth of chil
dren to women exposed to Ger
man Measles, faced a Califor
nia Medical Board examiner
Monday.
The doctor, accused of vio
lating a 95-year-old California
law forbidding abortions except
where the operation is neces
sary to preserve a woman's
life, is chief of obstetrics at St.
Luke's Hospital.
"There is a lot more to the

life of a mother than living and
breathing," Dr. Shively told the
examiner. "It is important to
consider all facts of a person's
life and her well-being."
Although the state statute un
der which the doctors are bring
accused has since been liberal
ized to allow therapeutic abor
tions under certain circum
stances, they face possible loss
of their medical licenses.
• UCLA Punishment
LOS ANGELES (AP) —
UCLA's chancellor approved to
day the punishment decreed by
a student committee in the case
of five campus protestors—but
said they'll be bounced if they
do it again.
The Student Conduct Com
mittee had ordered one student
suspended and four placed on
probation for their roles in dem
onstrations against recruiters
from Dow Chemical Co., mak
ers of fire bombs used in Viet
nam.
Chancellor Franklin D. Mur
phy added a provision to the
committee's recommendation
that "upon further rule violation
of a comparable sort during the
period of probation" the stu
dents would be expelled.
• Wall St. Summary
NEW YORK (AP) — A ner
vous stock market took its
worst loss in two months Mon
day as it began a series of short
ened sessions to allow broker
age houses to catch up with a
huge backlog of paperwork.
The pace of trading was actu
ally heavier than Friday's al
though the four-hour session
produced turnover of only 10.63
million shares compared with
11.95 million for the full sVfe
hour trading day Friday.
The major exchanges have
adopted the shortened sessions
until further notice. A series of
nine short sessions was ordered
last August, for the same rea
son.
The day's decline followed the
worst weekly decline since early
last November. Brokers said in
vestors were confused about the
early market closing and wor
ried about recent warnings on
overspeculation.
The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 8.61 to 871.71. Of
1,494 issues traded, 1,072 fell
and 27 rose. New highs for
