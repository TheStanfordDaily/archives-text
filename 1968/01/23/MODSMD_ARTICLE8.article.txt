# Our Graduate Students: They're Alive And Hiding
## 
### 
Half of Stanford students are graduates, yet
too little is heard from or known about these
six thousand individuals. The growth of the
graduate student population has made little
visible impact on the nature of the University.
Stanford still lives as if the graduate students
did not exist as a part of the Uuiversity, as if
they were superimposed on a structure consist
ing only of undergraduates. If we did not have
a yearly financial statement to remind us how
much money flows into Stanford to support
graduate students, we might forget entirely
they are here.
Graduate students in student organizations
are rare. One needs to look only to LASSU,
political clubs, or even The Daily staff. We can
look to an ASSU president who is a graduate
student, but he is the only visible graduate
student in student government. Efforts to form
a local chapter of the American Federation of
Teachers are the only evidence of graduate
students doing much of anything this year.
There are one or two instances of graduate
students waking up and taking part in the
activities of the Stanford community. In the
fall of 1964, with most graduate seats on
LASSU empty (as they seem to be most of
the time) the Graduate Coordinating Commit
tee, a loose group of pilot activists, marched
in and seated themselves. It took LASSU two
years to figure out what happened. Things are
back to normal now, as the few graduates have
retreated back into the stacks, or have gradu
ated. LASSU is again run by undergraduates,
ied by a relatively inexperienced sophomore.

In part the graduate students are to blame,
for they are too aloof from the University com
munity. They are too concerned about their
research or their defined study area to be in
volved in the community activities of the Uni
versity. Some even impose this academic isola
tion for the sole purpose of being able to make
more money.
While this is true to a certain degree, we
must admit that the concerns of student organ
izations are hardly related to the concerns of
most graduate students. Few graduate students
are dying to sit on LASSU in order to aid in
appropriating $100,000 yearly to Axe Comm,
IIR, and Speech Association. Graduate students
may want to come to hear speeches, but rarely
will they want to spend their time in a volun
teer committee planning them.
These are all games, and the campus is full
of structures for students to play games. Stu
dent government is a game. The graduate stu
dent doesn't want to play any games. He is
living life. Some organizations and institutions,
like The Daily, can diversify, involve graduate
students and reflect the concerns of this half
of the student body, if graduate students want
to become involved. But so many other organ
izations are hopelessly tied down in the quag
mire of undergraduate structures and tradition.
It's time graduate students became involved
in all areas of the life of the University commu
nity. It's time the games and lore associated
with an undergraduate college gave way to the
seriousness and relevance characteristic of a
University community of scholars. Stanford can
not be less.

volved in the community activities of the Uni
versity. Some even impose this academic isola
tion for the sole purpose of being able to make
more money.
While this is true to a certain degree, we
must admit that the concerns of student organ
izations are hardly related to the concerns of
most graduate students. Few graduate students
are dying to sit on LASSU in order to aid in
appropriating $100,000 yearly to Axe Comm,
IIR, and Speech Association. Graduate students
may want to come to hear speeches, but rarely
will they want to spend their time in a volun
teer committee planning them.
These are all games, and the campus is full
of structures for students to play games. Stu
dent government is a game. The graduate stu
dent doesn't want to play any games. He is
living life. Some organizations and institutions,
like The Daily, can diversify, involve graduate
students and reflect the concerns of this half
of the student body, if graduate students want
to become involved. But so many other organ
izations are hopelessly tied down in the quag
mire of undergraduate structures and tradition.
It's time graduate students became involved
in all areas of the life of the University commu
nity. It's time the games and lore associated
with an undergraduate college gave way to the
seriousness and relevance characteristic of a
University community of scholars. Stanford can
not be less.
Half of Stanford students are graduates, yet
too little is heard from or known about these
six thousand individuals. The growth of the
graduate student population has made little
visible impact on the nature of the University.
Stanford still lives as if the graduate students
did not exist as a part of the Uuiversity, as if
they were superimposed on a structure consist
ing only of undergraduates. If we did not have
a yearly financial statement to remind us how
much money flows into Stanford to support
graduate students, we might forget entirely
they are here.
Graduate students in student organizations
are rare. One needs to look only to LASSU,
political clubs, or even The Daily staff. We can
look to an ASSU president who is a graduate
student, but he is the only visible graduate
student in student government. Efforts to form
a local chapter of the American Federation of
Teachers are the only evidence of graduate
students doing much of anything this year.
There are one or two instances of graduate
students waking up and taking part in the
activities of the Stanford community. In the
fall of 1964, with most graduate seats on
LASSU empty (as they seem to be most of
the time) the Graduate Coordinating Commit
tee, a loose group of pilot activists, marched
in and seated themselves. It took LASSU two
years to figure out what happened. Things are
back to normal now, as the few graduates have
retreated back into the stacks, or have gradu
ated. LASSU is again run by undergraduates,
ied by a relatively inexperienced sophomore.

In part the graduate students are to blame,
for they are too aloof from the University com
munity. They are too concerned about their
research or their defined study area to be in
volved in the community activities of the Uni
versity. Some even impose this academic isola
tion for the sole purpose of being able to make
more money.
