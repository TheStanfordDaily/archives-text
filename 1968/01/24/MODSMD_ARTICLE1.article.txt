# Crew's Fate Uncertain
## North Koreans Hold U.S. Ship 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)— North
Korea held the U.S. intelligence
ship Pueblo and its crew captive
Tuesday night after seizing the
vessel at sea and ordering it
Into a Communist port.
The United Nations Command
in Korea demanded the ship and
the crew of 83 men be freed
Immediately with apologies.
The White House called the situ
ation "very serious."
North Korea was quoted as
broadcasting it "killed and
wounded several crewmen" in
boarding and capturing the
ship. The Pentagon said it had
no knowledge of any fatalities.
The American ship radioed
that four men were either
wounded or injured when it was
captured Monday night. Then
communications ended.
The nuclear carrier Enter
prise, sailing to Vietnam, was
reported to have turned around
to stand by in the Sea of Japan.
Another report from the Far

East said the sth Air Force had
been placed on combat alert.
The Pueblo was the first
American vessel seized at sea
since the Civil War.
American reaction was angry.
One congressman called the
seizure "an act of piracy." An
other termed it "obviously an
act of war."
The Pueblo was surrounded
by four North Korean patrol
boats Monday night about 25
miles off the coast of the Com
munist nation. It was forced at
gunpoint to accompany the pa
trol boats toward the North Ko
rean port of Wonsan.
The Pentagon said the Pueblo
made only one call for help and
that came too late.
The first request for assist
ance came when the U.S. ship al
ready was being boarded by
North Korean sailors, the Pen
tagon said. It explained, "Time
and distance factors made it im
possible to respond."

The United States asked Rus
sia to relay an urgent request to
North Korea for the release of
the ship and crew.
The U.N. protest was deliv
ered in Panmunjon where the
truce was signed to halt the
fighting in the Korean War 14
years ago. The Tuesday session
of the armistice commission
had been called originally be
cause of a North Korean terror
ist raid on Seoul Sunday.
In Tokyo, Japan's Kyodo news
service quoted a North Korean
broadcast Tuesday night as say
ing Communist navy vessels
"killed and wounded several
crewmen of the intruding U.S.
ship."
"More than 80 were cap
tured," the broadcast was
quoted as saying.
The Pentagon said the Pueblo
radioed at one point that four
men were wounded and mes
saged at another point that four
were injured. Defense spokes

men said they did not know
which was correct and didn't
have further details.
The Pueblo war armed with
three .50 caliber machine guns,
but did not fire a shot, military
officials said.
Two of the men aboard the
Pueblo were civilians, described
officially as Navy hydrogra
phers.
Pentagon spokesmen denied
the vessel was operated for the
National Security Agency, which
cracks codes and handles elec
tronic espionage.
However, the Defense Depart
ment confirmed the ship was
collecting information. It didn't
elaborate.
There was also a report from
the Far East that the sth Air
Force had been placed on com
bat alert,, a normal procedure
for military units that might
be used under emergency situa
tions. But the Pentagon said it

couldn't comment on alerts at
any time.
The Defense Department gave
this report:
"At approximately 10 p.m.
EST, a North Korean patrol
boat approached the Pueblo. Us
ing international signals, it re
quested the Pueblo's nationality.
"The Pueblo identified herself
as a U.S. ship. Continuing to use
flag signals, the patrol said:
'Heave to or I will open fire on
you.'
"The Pueblo replied: 'I am in
international waters.' The pa
trol circled the Pueblo.
"Approximately one hour lat
er, three additional patrol craft
appeared. One of them ordered:
'Follow in my wake, I have a
pilot aboard.'
"The four ships closed In on
the Pueblo, taking different po
sitions on her bow, beam and
quarter. Two MIG aircraft were
also spotted by the Pueblo,
circling off the starboard bow.

WASHINGTON (AP)— North
Korea held the U.S. intelligence
ship Pueblo and its crew captive
Tuesday night after seizing the
vessel at sea and ordering it
Into a Communist port.
The United Nations Command
in Korea demanded the ship and
the crew of 83 men be freed
Immediately with apologies.
The White House called the situ
ation "very serious."
North Korea was quoted as
broadcasting it "killed and
wounded several crewmen" in
boarding and capturing the
ship. The Pentagon said it had
no knowledge of any fatalities.
The American ship radioed
that four men were either
wounded or injured when it was
captured Monday night. Then
communications ended.
The nuclear carrier Enter
prise, sailing to Vietnam, was
reported to have turned around
to stand by in the Sea of Japan.
Another report from the Far

East said the sth Air Force had
been placed on combat alert.
The Pueblo was the first
American vessel seized at sea
since the Civil War.
American reaction was angry.
One congressman called the
seizure "an act of piracy." An
other termed it "obviously an
act of war."
The Pueblo was surrounded
by four North Korean patrol
boats Monday night about 25
miles off the coast of the Com
munist nation. It was forced at
gunpoint to accompany the pa
trol boats toward the North Ko
rean port of Wonsan.
The Pentagon said the Pueblo
made only one call for help and
that came too late.
The first request for assist
ance came when the U.S. ship al
ready was being boarded by
North Korean sailors, the Pen
tagon said. It explained, "Time
and distance factors made it im
possible to respond."

The United States asked Rus
sia to relay an urgent request to
North Korea for the release of
the ship and crew.
The U.N. protest was deliv
ered in Panmunjon where the
truce was signed to halt the
fighting in the Korean War 14
years ago. The Tuesday session
of the armistice commission
had been called originally be
cause of a North Korean terror
ist raid on Seoul Sunday.
In Tokyo, Japan's Kyodo news
service quoted a North Korean
broadcast Tuesday night as say
ing Communist navy vessels
"killed and wounded several
crewmen of the intruding U.S.
ship."
"More than 80 were cap
tured," the broadcast was
quoted as saying.
The Pentagon said the Pueblo
radioed at one point that four
men were wounded and mes
saged at another point that four
were injured. Defense spokes

men said they did not know
which was correct and didn't
have further details.
The Pueblo war armed with
three .50 caliber machine guns,
but did not fire a shot, military
officials said.
Two of the men aboard the
Pueblo were civilians, described
officially as Navy hydrogra
phers.
Pentagon spokesmen denied
the vessel was operated for the
National Security Agency, which
cracks codes and handles elec
tronic espionage.
However, the Defense Depart
ment confirmed the ship was
collecting information. It didn't
elaborate.
There was also a report from
the Far East that the sth Air
Force had been placed on com
bat alert,, a normal procedure
for military units that might
be used under emergency situa
tions. But the Pentagon said it

couldn't comment on alerts at
any time.
The Defense Department gave
this report:
"At approximately 10 p.m.
EST, a North Korean patrol
boat approached the Pueblo. Us
ing international signals, it re
quested the Pueblo's nationality.
"The Pueblo identified herself
as a U.S. ship. Continuing to use
flag signals, the patrol said:
'Heave to or I will open fire on
you.'
"The Pueblo replied: 'I am in
international waters.' The pa
trol circled the Pueblo.
"Approximately one hour lat
er, three additional patrol craft
appeared. One of them ordered:
'Follow in my wake, I have a
pilot aboard.'
"The four ships closed In on
the Pueblo, taking different po
sitions on her bow, beam and
quarter. Two MIG aircraft were
also spotted by the Pueblo,
circling off the starboard bow.

WASHINGTON (AP)— North
Korea held the U.S. intelligence
ship Pueblo and its crew captive
Tuesday night after seizing the
vessel at sea and ordering it
Into a Communist port.
The United Nations Command
in Korea demanded the ship and
the crew of 83 men be freed
Immediately with apologies.
The White House called the situ
ation "very serious."
North Korea was quoted as
broadcasting it "killed and
wounded several crewmen" in
boarding and capturing the
ship. The Pentagon said it had
no knowledge of any fatalities.
The American ship radioed
that four men were either
wounded or injured when it was
captured Monday night. Then
communications ended.
The nuclear carrier Enter
prise, sailing to Vietnam, was
reported to have turned around
to stand by in the Sea of Japan.
Another report from the Far

East said the sth Air Force had
been placed on combat alert.
The Pueblo was the first
American vessel seized at sea
since the Civil War.
American reaction was angry.
One congressman called the
seizure "an act of piracy." An
other termed it "obviously an
act of war."
The Pueblo was surrounded
by four North Korean patrol
boats Monday night about 25
miles off the coast of the Com
munist nation. It was forced at
gunpoint to accompany the pa
trol boats toward the North Ko
rean port of Wonsan.
The Pentagon said the Pueblo
made only one call for help and
that came too late.
The first request for assist
ance came when the U.S. ship al
ready was being boarded by
North Korean sailors, the Pen
tagon said. It explained, "Time
and distance factors made it im
possible to respond."

The United States asked Rus
sia to relay an urgent request to
North Korea for the release of
the ship and crew.
The U.N. protest was deliv
ered in Panmunjon where the
truce was signed to halt the
fighting in the Korean War 14
years ago. The Tuesday session
of the armistice commission
had been called originally be
cause of a North Korean terror
ist raid on Seoul Sunday.
In Tokyo, Japan's Kyodo news
service quoted a North Korean
broadcast Tuesday night as say
ing Communist navy vessels
"killed and wounded several
crewmen of the intruding U.S.
ship."
"More than 80 were cap
tured," the broadcast was
quoted as saying.
The Pentagon said the Pueblo
radioed at one point that four
men were wounded and mes
saged at another point that four
were injured. Defense spokes

men said they did not know
which was correct and didn't
have further details.
The Pueblo war armed with
three .50 caliber machine guns,
but did not fire a shot, military
officials said.
Two of the men aboard the
Pueblo were civilians, described
officially as Navy hydrogra
phers.
Pentagon spokesmen denied
the vessel was operated for the
National Security Agency, which
cracks codes and handles elec
tronic espionage.
However, the Defense Depart
ment confirmed the ship was
collecting information. It didn't
elaborate.
There was also a report from
the Far East that the sth Air
Force had been placed on com
bat alert,, a normal procedure
for military units that might
be used under emergency situa
tions. But the Pentagon said it

couldn't comment on alerts at
any time.
The Defense Department gave
this report:
"At approximately 10 p.m.
EST, a North Korean patrol
boat approached the Pueblo. Us
ing international signals, it re
quested the Pueblo's nationality.
"The Pueblo identified herself
as a U.S. ship. Continuing to use
flag signals, the patrol said:
'Heave to or I will open fire on
you.'
"The Pueblo replied: 'I am in
international waters.' The pa
trol circled the Pueblo.
"Approximately one hour lat
er, three additional patrol craft
appeared. One of them ordered:
'Follow in my wake, I have a
pilot aboard.'
"The four ships closed In on
the Pueblo, taking different po
sitions on her bow, beam and
quarter. Two MIG aircraft were
also spotted by the Pueblo,
circling off the starboard bow.
