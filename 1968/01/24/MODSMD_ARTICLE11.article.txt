# Why Does It Happen To Them?
## 
### Max Lerner 
This year's political campaign
will see a sustained attack on
Lyndon Johnson's war policies,
especially in contrast with his
1964 position, when he seemed
to be championing at least a
measure of moderation and
peace. He is enough of a politi
cal veteran to know this and
to shape a political strategy to
meet it.
But what will the historian
say about it, who tries not to be
a partisan one way or the other,
but uses history to illumine the
present?
One thing he will note is a
dramatically startling fact. In
the past half-century America
has engaged in four major wars
that have affected the policies of
five administrations.
The wars have been World
Wars I and 11, the Korean war
and the Vietnamese war. The ad
ministrations have been those
of Wilson, Roosevelt, Truman,
Kennedy and Johnson. And the
startling fact is that all five have
been those of Democratic liber
als, and each has been divided
into a Reform administration
and a War administration.
Inherent Democrat
Characteristic ?
How is this explained? Is it
sheer historical accident? Or is
there some inner necessity that
links the liberal Democrat in
America with war?
One explanation sometimes of
fered is that the liberals are
"starry-eyed idealists," "bleeding
hearts" and "do-gooders" who
are bound to get messed up in
war trouble through sheer mor
alistic meddling. This may well
have applied to Woodrow Wil
son, whose intervention in World
War I no longer seemed as in
evitable as It once did. But Wil
son's brand of moralism scarce
ly applies to any of his succes
sors.
A second explanation stresses
the economic phase of war —
that America got into its wars
to keep its economy going full
blast. This may have been true
of Wilson and Roosevelt to a

minor degree. But it has not been
at all true of Truman, Kennedy
or Johnson. We know too much
about economics to make war
tempting as a solution.
Why, then the bloody record
of a half-century? The answer
lies in America's emergence as
a world power just as the old
global power system was break
ing up: hence America's role in
World War I, in the effort to
keep the Germans from wreck
ing the balanced global power
structure that America was
about to inherit.
From the time that Hitler and
Roosevelt both came to power,
in 1932, the chances of a clash
between Nazi Germany and the
Western democracies had to be
reckoned with. But Roosevelt
had to put the American house
in order first, which he did rea
sonably well in his first Reform
term. Had he been able to get
a united country behind him af
ter 1936, to meet the Nazi chal

lenge in Europe by collective se
curity, World War II would nev
er have taken place.
It was not too much but too
little American intervention; not
the liberals but the appeasers
that were responsible for World
War 11. The Japanese and Pearl
Harbor merely triggered Ameri
ca's interest, which had been
prepared by the revenge in
Europe.
Nationalism Lends A Hand
After Roosevelt and World
War II a decisive new factor en
ters: the revolutionary national
isms in uprisings which can be
mounted or used by the Commu
nist powers.
Truman got involved in one
of these wars — the Korean. His
successors got involved in an
other, in Vietnam — Eisenhower
a little, Kennedy more, Johnson
most. There may be others. They
come at the point where the
revolutionary passions of na
tions, hunger, class, race, color

and ideology, meet and merge.
The ideal American response
would be to ignore them, but fail
ing this the best policy is to use
economic and military aid to
help organize regional or con
tinent-wide alliances for collec
tive security against a clear
power-thrust. Only thus can
America stay out of strangling
wars.
But Why The Democrats?
This still leaves the question
of why it should have been
Democratic Presidents who did
get entangled in them. One
might answer, of course, that
since 1932 — when the ideologi
cal offensive began, first Nazi,
then Communist — there have
been Democrats in power in
Washington, except for Eisen
hower's two terms.
Eisenhower and Dulles prac
ticed a brink diplomacy, but, ex
cept briefly in Lebanon and ten
tatively in Vietnam, they didn't
go over the brink and take th?

plunge. Truman did. Kennedy
used the brink method in Ber
lin, went over the brink in Cuba
but turned back, got more wis
dom in handling Laos and used
the brink on the missile confron
tation — with luck and courage.
Johnson went deeper into th?
water with every step in Viet
nam and finally passed the point
of no return.
Both the Democratic and Re
publican Party leaders are prac
tical men, but there is one differ
ence between them. The Demo
crats, since Jefferson, have
thought in terms of America's
world mission and have tended
to carve out what Jefferson call
ed "an Empire for Liberty."
The trouble is that there are
too many nationalist combust
ible fires around the world to
make such an empire worth
carving, and, besides, the liberty
is dubious.
