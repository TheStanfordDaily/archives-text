# Letters To The Editor
## In The Tradition Of Nothing 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Since nothing much is ever
said on the Farm, I thought I'd
make my regular contribution
this morning. If by some Strang 1
twist of fate someone does read
this letter and asks the ques
tion "What the hell were you
trying to say," my stock reply
will be "Nothing." So don't
bother to ask.
Anyway, I was confronted
with this grave existential prob
lem at breakfast — whether to
eat my scrambled eggs while
they were still warm or read
The Dally. After consuming the
eggs, I noticed an article con
cerning speculation for a new
draft law (which isn't anything
new; post hoc, ergo propter hoc
it's nothing). It appears as
though all males, ages 19-26, who
have birthdays between January
1 and December 31 are subject
to the draft, something which
came as a great surprise to me.
Now I'd like to propose an al
ternative to this proposal which,
since it's nothing, will probably
be taken seriously, but that
doesn't matter. I propose rais
ing the age limitations to 45-60;
but, because this proposal tends
to be a little too indiscriminate
for our American social patterns,
I'd also suggest that only those
males engaged in professional
politics (as distinguished from
amateur politics) be subject.
My proposal also includes a
new radical (satire) element:
Proposition N2, which would
stand for nothing new, would
give the American public a

choice: 1) to continue the old
policy of sending our soldiers
overseas to fight in the conven
tional manner; or 2) to deter
mine a standard coefficient of
casualities pro rated on a month
ly basis and then to establish an
agreement with the enemy
whereby each side would peace
fully reduce to nothing the re
quired number of their own
soldiers.
The first choice, however,
would still offer the surest and
quickest method of material vic
tory — if a sophisticated Ameri
can public cannot cope with the
tactics of their own elected rep
resentatives, what chance do th ">
Cong, who aren't even Ameri
cans but foreigners, stand?
If the old adage "Nothing mat
ters" has any validity, then by
definition, this is possibly one of
the most significant contribu
tions which has ever b?en sub
mitted to The Daily. In second
thought, I guess The Daily prints
a lot of significant material.

• Air Society Prize
Isn't Even Consolation
Editor, The Daily:
This letter may interest those
who wish to enter candidates in
th? Arnold Air Society Campus
Playboy contest.
The same contest was held by
the same organization in the
spring of 1966. As mentioned in
The Daily, this contest was won
by Mr. Wilson Condon, Head

Coach of the Stanford Crew.
The Daily neglected to men
tion the events following his
election. Indeed, it appeared that
the "elaborate" preparations
made by Arnold's Air Society
(or whatever) were not as com
plete as they had claimed. In
fact, he is yet to receive his prize,
a Playboy Club Key, as adver
tised.
An expedition was made to
the San Francisco Playboy Club
by Mr. Condon, a Hertz repre
sentative (the Hertz company
was providing the transporting
automobile for promotional con
sideration), a photographer
from Hertz, and one of Arnold's
men in quest of this trinket.
Upon arrival at the Club, the
Club's personnel disclaimed any
knowledge of an arrangement
with Arnold.
After a great hassel, . . . they
were "awarded" a day's mem
bership, but were required to
buy their own lunch instead of
attending a promotional lunch
on the house to which they
thought they had been invited.
The Arnold Air Society claim
ed in a LASSU meeting of last
quarter that they had rectified
the situation and had sent Mr.
condon several letters, which
had not been answered.
Since a great deal of money
was expanded on his behalf, and
the situation in which he was
placed was extremely embar
rassing, we feel more than just
letters was warranted. . . .

• Police Termed
Nasty, Useless
Editor, The Dally:
It Is very obvious to me that
the Stanford Police are inept
and lackadasical. Their primary
purpose is in name only, and
giving parking tickets appears
to be their major task.
About two weeks ago, my car
was broken into and an attempt
was made to steal it. As I dis
covered my car, inoperable, I
talked to a policeman who
seemed unconcerned and even
nasty. I then phoned the Stan
ford Police Headquarters, and
they sent a policeman over to
talk to me. As I gave the police
man the information regarding
the attempted theft, he men
tioned to me that it was unfor
tunate that the interview was
now because he was supposed to
get off duty at 3:00, and the
time was 3:10. He cut the con
versation short and left.
The Stanford Campus Police
are not only impotent figure
heads, but their concern for the
Stanford student appears only
in a negative manner. If Stan
ford University feels it neces
sary to have a Campus Police
Force instead of local police,
they should take some concern
in the quality of these men, and
let them project an image of
public service, rather than that
of uselessness.

This letter may interest those
who wish to enter candidates in

Playboy contest.
The same contest was held by
the same organization in the
spring of 1966. As mentioned in
The Daily, this contest was won
by Mr. Wilson Condon, Head

Coach of the Stanford Crew.
The Daily neglected to men
tion the events following his
election. Indeed, it appeared that
the "elaborate" preparations
made by Arnold's Air Society
(or whatever) were not as com
plete as they had claimed. In
fact, he is yet to receive his prize,
a Playboy Club Key, as adver
tised.
An expedition was made to
the San Francisco Playboy Club
by Mr. Condon, a Hertz repre
sentative (the Hertz company
was providing the transporting
automobile for promotional con
sideration), a photographer
from Hertz, and one of Arnold's
men in quest of this trinket.
Upon arrival at the Club, the
Club's personnel disclaimed any
knowledge of an arrangement
with Arnold.
After a great hassel, . . . they
were "awarded" a day's mem
bership, but were required to
buy their own lunch instead of
attending a promotional lunch
on the house to which they
thought they had been invited.
The Arnold Air Society claim
ed in a LASSU meeting of last
quarter that they had rectified
the situation and had sent Mr.
condon several letters, which
had not been answered.
Since a great deal of money
was expanded on his behalf, and
the situation in which he was
placed was extremely embar
rassing, we feel more than just
letters was warranted. . . .

Editor, The Dally:
It Is very obvious to me that
the Stanford Police are inept
and lackadasical. Their primary
purpose is in name only, and
giving parking tickets appears
to be their major task.
About two weeks ago, my car
was broken into and an attempt
was made to steal it. As I dis
covered my car, inoperable, I
talked to a policeman who
seemed unconcerned and even
nasty. I then phoned the Stan
ford Police Headquarters, and
they sent a policeman over to
talk to me. As I gave the police
man the information regarding
the attempted theft, he men
tioned to me that it was unfor
tunate that the interview was
now because he was supposed to
get off duty at 3:00, and the
time was 3:10. He cut the con
versation short and left.
The Stanford Campus Police
are not only impotent figure
heads, but their concern for the
Stanford student appears only
in a negative manner. If Stan
ford University feels it neces
sary to have a Campus Police
Force instead of local police,
they should take some concern
in the quality of these men, and
let them project an image of
public service, rather than that
of uselessness.

Since nothing much is ever
said on the Farm, I thought I'd
make my regular contribution
this morning. If by some Strang 1
twist of fate someone does read
this letter and asks the ques
tion "What the hell were you
trying to say," my stock reply
will be "Nothing." So don't
bother to ask.
Anyway, I was confronted
with this grave existential prob
lem at breakfast — whether to
eat my scrambled eggs while
they were still warm or read
The Dally. After consuming the
eggs, I noticed an article con
cerning speculation for a new
draft law (which isn't anything
new; post hoc, ergo propter hoc
it's nothing). It appears as
though all males, ages 19-26, who
have birthdays between January
1 and December 31 are subject
to the draft, something which
came as a great surprise to me.
Now I'd like to propose an al
ternative to this proposal which,
since it's nothing, will probably
be taken seriously, but that
doesn't matter. I propose rais
ing the age limitations to 45-60;
but, because this proposal tends
to be a little too indiscriminate
for our American social patterns,
I'd also suggest that only those
males engaged in professional
politics (as distinguished from
amateur politics) be subject.
My proposal also includes a
new radical (satire) element:
Proposition N2, which would
stand for nothing new, would
give the American public a

choice: 1) to continue the old
policy of sending our soldiers
overseas to fight in the conven
tional manner; or 2) to deter
mine a standard coefficient of
casualities pro rated on a month
ly basis and then to establish an
agreement with the enemy
whereby each side would peace
fully reduce to nothing the re
quired number of their own
soldiers.
The first choice, however,
would still offer the surest and
quickest method of material vic
tory — if a sophisticated Ameri
can public cannot cope with the
tactics of their own elected rep
resentatives, what chance do th ">
Cong, who aren't even Ameri

the Stanford Police are inept
and lackadasical. Their primary
purpose is in name only, and
giving parking tickets appears
to be their major task.
About two weeks ago, my car
was broken into and an attempt
was made to steal it. As I dis
covered my car, inoperable, I
talked to a policeman who
seemed unconcerned and even
nasty. I then phoned the Stan
ford Police Headquarters, and
they sent a policeman over to
talk to me. As I gave the police
man the information regarding
the attempted theft, he men
tioned to me that it was unfor
tunate that the interview was
now because he was supposed to
get off duty at 3:00, and the
time was 3:10. He cut the con
versation short and left.
The Stanford Campus Police
are not only impotent figure
heads, but their concern for the
Stanford student appears only
in a negative manner. If Stan
ford University feels it neces
sary to have a Campus Police
Force instead of local police,
they should take some concern
in the quality of these men, and
let them project an image of
public service, rather than that
of uselessness.

Since nothing much is ever
said on the Farm, I thought I'd
make my regular contribution
this morning. If by some Strang 1
twist of fate someone does read
this letter and asks the ques
tion "What the hell were you
trying to say," my stock reply
will be "Nothing." So don't
bother to ask.
Anyway, I was confronted
with this grave existential prob
lem at breakfast — whether to
eat my scrambled eggs while
they were still warm or read
The Dally. After consuming the
eggs, I noticed an article con
cerning speculation for a new
draft law (which isn't anything
new; post hoc, ergo propter hoc
it's nothing). It appears as
though all males, ages 19-26, who
have birthdays between January
1 and December 31 are subject
to the draft, something which
came as a great surprise to me.
Now I'd like to propose an al
ternative to this proposal which,
since it's nothing, will probably
be taken seriously, but that
doesn't matter. I propose rais
ing the age limitations to 45-60;
but, because this proposal tends
to be a little too indiscriminate
for our American social patterns,
I'd also suggest that only those
males engaged in professional
politics (as distinguished from
amateur politics) be subject.
My proposal also includes a
new radical (satire) element:
Proposition N2, which would
stand for nothing new, would
give the American public a

choice: 1) to continue the old
policy of sending our soldiers
overseas to fight in the conven
tional manner; or 2) to deter
mine a standard coefficient of
casualities pro rated on a month
ly basis and then to establish an
agreement with the enemy
whereby each side would peace
fully reduce to nothing the re
quired number of their own
soldiers.
The first choice, however,
would still offer the surest and
quickest method of material vic
tory — if a sophisticated Ameri
can public cannot cope with the
tactics of their own elected rep
resentatives, what chance do th ">
Cong, who aren't even Ameri
cans but foreigners, stand?
If the old adage "Nothing mat
ters" has any validity, then by
definition, this is possibly one of
the most significant contribu
tions which has ever b?en sub
mitted to The Daily. In second
thought, I guess The Daily prints
a lot of significant material.

This letter may interest those
who wish to enter candidates in
th? Arnold Air Society Campus
Playboy contest.
The same contest was held by
the same organization in the
spring of 1966. As mentioned in
The Daily, this contest was won
by Mr. Wilson Condon, Head

Coach of the Stanford Crew.
The Daily neglected to men
tion the events following his
election. Indeed, it appeared that
the "elaborate" preparations
made by Arnold's Air Society
(or whatever) were not as com
plete as they had claimed. In
fact, he is yet to receive his prize,
a Playboy Club Key, as adver
tised.
An expedition was made to
the San Francisco Playboy Club
by Mr. Condon, a Hertz repre
sentative (the Hertz company
was providing the transporting
automobile for promotional con
sideration), a photographer
from Hertz, and one of Arnold's
men in quest of this trinket.
Upon arrival at the Club, the
Club's personnel disclaimed any
knowledge of an arrangement
with Arnold.
After a great hassel, . . . they
were "awarded" a day's mem
bership, but were required to
buy their own lunch instead of
attending a promotional lunch
on the house to which they
thought they had been invited.
The Arnold Air Society claim
ed in a LASSU meeting of last
quarter that they had rectified
the situation and had sent Mr.
condon several letters, which
had not been answered.
Since a great deal of money
was expanded on his behalf, and
the situation in which he was
placed was extremely embar
rassing, we feel more than just
letters was warranted. . . .
