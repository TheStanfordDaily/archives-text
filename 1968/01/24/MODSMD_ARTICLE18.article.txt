## Gold Payments End Asked 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
"What I'm advocating is the
application of the New Econo
mics to the international pay
ments field," says Lorie Tarshis,
executive head of the economics
department.
Tashis's proposal is that the
United States refuse to pay out
gold for foreign-held dollars. The
U.S. currently exchanges foreign
hold dollars for gold at the rate
of $35 per ounce.
Since Great Britain devaluated
the pound there has been much
controversy over whether the
U.S. would be able to continue
to allow its already shrunken
gold reserves to fall. Several
measures have been proposed to
cure the U.S.'s balance-of-pay
ments deficit which is the main
contributor to the gold loss.
Devaluation has been propos
ed as one possible solution. This
would consist of the U.S.'s an
nouncing that the United States

would sell gold for, say, $40 per
ounce. This increase in price
would be similar to Great Bri
tain's devaluation. This course
was rejected by the U.S. govern
ment.
Devaluation Futile
Tarshis feels that such a move
would be futile because most oth
er countries would follow suit.
Failure to do so would give the
United States an even greater
competitive advantage in world
trade than it enjoys today. De
valuation, when not widely imi
tated stimulates exports while
discouraging imports.
Tarshis points out that Great
Britain was forced to limit her
devaluation to 14.3% because
any greater cut would have
prompted many other countries
to follow suit. "If such a rela
tively small country was restrict
ed to less than 15% devaluation,
think what the limit on the
United States would be," Tarshis
said.
Another possible course, and
the one the U.S. has chosen,
would be to place direct controls
on foreign investment by Ameri
can companies. Tarshis said that
the result of imposition of di
rect controls may be "a serious
economic slowdown."
This slowdown would come
about because our controls may
cause the domestic economies of
other countries to slow down
and this would have a "back
lash" effect on the United States.
Furthermore, Tarshis remarked,
there would be a tendency for
other countries to raise their
tariffs which would further
hamper trade and thus adverse
ly affect general economic well
being.
Floating Dollar
Tarshis's proposal is to let the
value of the dollar "float" in the
expectation that it would stabi
lize after the initial reaction.
Asked how long this correction
would last, Tarshis replied, "I
think it would be over pretty
damn quickly." He also said that
the size of the correction would
be moderate.
"The support of the price of
the dollar should be an interna
tional business since the dollar
is the international currency,"
Tarshis said. "Our role is to con
trol the size of the deficit and
their role is to hold dollars as
their reserve."
His belief is that the sheer
size of the U.S. economy would
lead the other countries to use
the dollar as their reserve. The

deficit Tarshis refers to is the
balance • of • payments deficit
which, in the new situation,
would amount to the size of the
increase in the world's currency
reserves.
Tarshis termed the proposal
an application of "New Econo
mics" because the move would
involve a complete re-evaluation
of the meaning and significance
of the balance-of-payments "de
ficit."
Asked why he thought there
is such an attachment among
economists and others to the
gold backing of our foreign-held
dollars, Tarshis replied that a
"mystique" has grown up around
the gold backing, and many peo
ple just don't question it.
Excessive Publicity
He went on to say that much
of the current speculation about
the possible devaluation of the
dollar was the result of the ex
cessive publicity by the United
States. He said it was analogous
to a bank suddenly calling its
big depositors up and telling
them not to worry about the
bank failing. A run on the bank
is inevitable.
Tarshis said that this induced
fear was a major cause for the
recent dip in our gold reserves.
Speculators exchange dollars
for gold because the value of
their holdings would increase
substantially if the United States
devaluated the dollar. "We make
their expectations seem likely,"
Tarshis said.
Tarshis emphasized that his
view of the solution to our gold
problem is not a very widely
held one among economists. He
said that supporters of his view
can be found at MIT, the Brook
ings Institute and Stanford.
Difference Of Opinion
Even at Stanford there is no
uniformity of opinion on Tar
shis's proposal. Professor Geo
rge Bach of the Graduate School
of Business has expressed a dif
ferent view as to the proper
solution of the problem.
Contacted by The Daily, Pro
fessor Bach said that, while ho
too favors the elimination of the
dependence on gold to back our
international obligations, the
process should be carried out
over a long period of time in
order to lessen the impact.
Bach took issue with Tarshis's
belief that the reaction to the
refusal to buy and sell gold
would be brief and moderate. He
said, "I am distressed about the
probable consequences of such

a move. I would foresee no im
mediate stability. It might not be
reached for years. A sudden
move might also provoke retali
atory measures that would cause
a condition like that of the
1930'5."
Bach emphasized that the dif
ference between his view and
Tarshis's was one of the means
to obtain the same end, eliminat
ing the excessive reliance on
gold for reserves. Bach believes
his method would facilitate the
growth of an international re
serve currency.

and this would have a "back
lash" effect on the United States.
Furthermore, Tarshis remarked,
there would be a tendency for
other countries to raise their
tariffs which would further
hamper trade and thus adverse
ly affect general economic well
being.
Floating Dollar
Tarshis's proposal is to let the
value of the dollar "float" in the
expectation that it would stabi
lize after the initial reaction.
Asked how long this correction
would last, Tarshis replied, "I
think it would be over pretty
damn quickly." He also said that
the size of the correction would
be moderate.
"The support of the price of
the dollar should be an interna
tional business since the dollar
is the international currency,"
Tarshis said. "Our role is to con
trol the size of the deficit and
their role is to hold dollars as
their reserve."
His belief is that the sheer
size of the U.S. economy would
lead the other countries to use
the dollar as their reserve. The

deficit Tarshis refers to is the
balance • of • payments deficit
which, in the new situation,
would amount to the size of the
increase in the world's currency
reserves.
Tarshis termed the proposal
an application of "New Econo
mics" because the move would
involve a complete re-evaluation
of the meaning and significance
of the balance-of-payments "de
ficit."
Asked why he thought there
is such an attachment among
economists and others to the
gold backing of our foreign-held
dollars, Tarshis replied that a
"mystique" has grown up around
the gold backing, and many peo
ple just don't question it.
Excessive Publicity
He went on to say that much
of the current speculation about
the possible devaluation of the
dollar was the result of the ex
cessive publicity by the United
States. He said it was analogous
to a bank suddenly calling its
big depositors up and telling
them not to worry about the
bank failing. A run on the bank
is inevitable.
Tarshis said that this induced
fear was a major cause for the
recent dip in our gold reserves.
Speculators exchange dollars
for gold because the value of
their holdings would increase
substantially if the United States
devaluated the dollar. "We make
their expectations seem likely,"
Tarshis said.
Tarshis emphasized that his
view of the solution to our gold
problem is not a very widely
held one among economists. He
said that supporters of his view
can be found at MIT, the Brook
ings Institute and Stanford.
Difference Of Opinion
Even at Stanford there is no
uniformity of opinion on Tar
shis's proposal. Professor Geo
rge Bach of the Graduate School
of Business has expressed a dif
ferent view as to the proper
solution of the problem.
Contacted by The Daily, Pro
fessor Bach said that, while ho
too favors the elimination of the
dependence on gold to back our
international obligations, the
process should be carried out
over a long period of time in
order to lessen the impact.
Bach took issue with Tarshis's
belief that the reaction to the
refusal to buy and sell gold
would be brief and moderate. He
said, "I am distressed about the
probable consequences of such

a move. I would foresee no im
mediate stability. It might not be
reached for years. A sudden
move might also provoke retali
atory measures that would cause
a condition like that of the
1930'5."
Bach emphasized that the dif
ference between his view and
Tarshis's was one of the means
to obtain the same end, eliminat
ing the excessive reliance on
gold for reserves. Bach believes
his method would facilitate the
growth of an international re
serve currency.
"What I'm advocating is the
application of the New Econo
mics to the international pay
ments field," says Lorie Tarshis,
executive head of the economics
department.
Tashis's proposal is that the
United States refuse to pay out
gold for foreign-held dollars. The
U.S. currently exchanges foreign
hold dollars for gold at the rate
of $35 per ounce.
Since Great Britain devaluated
the pound there has been much
controversy over whether the
U.S. would be able to continue
to allow its already shrunken
gold reserves to fall. Several
measures have been proposed to
cure the U.S.'s balance-of-pay
ments deficit which is the main
contributor to the gold loss.
Devaluation has been propos
ed as one possible solution. This
would consist of the U.S.'s an
nouncing that the United States

would sell gold for, say, $40 per
ounce. This increase in price
would be similar to Great Bri
tain's devaluation. This course
was rejected by the U.S. govern
ment.
Devaluation Futile
Tarshis feels that such a move
would be futile because most oth
er countries would follow suit.
Failure to do so would give the
United States an even greater
competitive advantage in world
trade than it enjoys today. De
valuation, when not widely imi
tated stimulates exports while
discouraging imports.
Tarshis points out that Great
Britain was forced to limit her
devaluation to 14.3% because
any greater cut would have
prompted many other countries
to follow suit. "If such a rela
tively small country was restrict
ed to less than 15% devaluation,
think what the limit on the
United States would be," Tarshis
said.
Another possible course, and
the one the U.S. has chosen,
would be to place direct controls
on foreign investment by Ameri
can companies. Tarshis said that
the result of imposition of di
rect controls may be "a serious
economic slowdown."
This slowdown would come
about because our controls may
cause the domestic economies of
other countries to slow down
and this would have a "back
lash" effect on the United States.
Furthermore, Tarshis remarked,
there would be a tendency for

Speculators exchange dollars
for gold because the value of
their holdings would increase
substantially if the United States
devaluated the dollar. "We make
their expectations seem likely,"
Tarshis said.
Tarshis emphasized that his
view of the solution to our gold
problem is not a very widely
held one among economists. He
said that supporters of his view
can be found at MIT, the Brook
ings Institute and Stanford.
Difference Of Opinion
Even at Stanford there is no
uniformity of opinion on Tar
shis's proposal. Professor Geo
rge Bach of the Graduate School
of Business has expressed a dif
ferent view as to the proper
solution of the problem.
Contacted by The Daily, Pro
fessor Bach said that, while ho
too favors the elimination of the
dependence on gold to back our
international obligations, the
process should be carried out
over a long period of time in
order to lessen the impact.
Bach took issue with Tarshis's
belief that the reaction to the
refusal to buy and sell gold
would be brief and moderate. He
said, "I am distressed about the
probable consequences of such

a move. I would foresee no im
mediate stability. It might not be
reached for years. A sudden
move might also provoke retali
atory measures that would cause
a condition like that of the
1930'5."
Bach emphasized that the dif
ference between his view and
Tarshis's was one of the means
to obtain the same end, eliminat
ing the excessive reliance on
gold for reserves. Bach believes
his method would facilitate the
growth of an international re
serve currency.
"What I'm advocating is the
application of the New Econo
mics to the international pay
ments field," says Lorie Tarshis,
executive head of the economics
department.
Tashis's proposal is that the
United States refuse to pay out
gold for foreign-held dollars. The
U.S. currently exchanges foreign
hold dollars for gold at the rate
of $35 per ounce.
Since Great Britain devaluated
the pound there has been much
controversy over whether the
U.S. would be able to continue
to allow its already shrunken
gold reserves to fall. Several
measures have been proposed to
cure the U.S.'s balance-of-pay
ments deficit which is the main
contributor to the gold loss.
Devaluation has been propos
ed as one possible solution. This
would consist of the U.S.'s an
nouncing that the United States

would sell gold for, say, $40 per
ounce. This increase in price
would be similar to Great Bri
tain's devaluation. This course
was rejected by the U.S. govern
ment.
Devaluation Futile
Tarshis feels that such a move
would be futile because most oth
er countries would follow suit.
Failure to do so would give the
United States an even greater
competitive advantage in world
trade than it enjoys today. De
valuation, when not widely imi
tated stimulates exports while
discouraging imports.
Tarshis points out that Great
Britain was forced to limit her
devaluation to 14.3% because
any greater cut would have
prompted many other countries
to follow suit. "If such a rela
tively small country was restrict
ed to less than 15% devaluation,
think what the limit on the
United States would be," Tarshis
said.
Another possible course, and
the one the U.S. has chosen,
would be to place direct controls
on foreign investment by Ameri
can companies. Tarshis said that
the result of imposition of di
rect controls may be "a serious
economic slowdown."
This slowdown would come
about because our controls may
cause the domestic economies of
other countries to slow down
and this would have a "back
lash" effect on the United States.
Furthermore, Tarshis remarked,
there would be a tendency for
other countries to raise their
tariffs which would further
hamper trade and thus adverse
ly affect general economic well
being.
Floating Dollar
Tarshis's proposal is to let the
value of the dollar "float" in the
expectation that it would stabi
lize after the initial reaction.
Asked how long this correction
would last, Tarshis replied, "I
think it would be over pretty
damn quickly." He also said that
the size of the correction would
be moderate.
"The support of the price of
the dollar should be an interna
tional business since the dollar
is the international currency,"
Tarshis said. "Our role is to con
trol the size of the deficit and
their role is to hold dollars as
their reserve."
His belief is that the sheer
size of the U.S. economy would
lead the other countries to use
the dollar as their reserve. The

deficit Tarshis refers to is the
balance • of • payments deficit
which, in the new situation,
would amount to the size of the
increase in the world's currency
reserves.
Tarshis termed the proposal
an application of "New Econo
mics" because the move would
involve a complete re-evaluation
of the meaning and significance
of the balance-of-payments "de
ficit."
Asked why he thought there
is such an attachment among
economists and others to the
gold backing of our foreign-held
dollars, Tarshis replied that a
"mystique" has grown up around
the gold backing, and many peo
ple just don't question it.
Excessive Publicity
He went on to say that much
of the current speculation about
the possible devaluation of the
dollar was the result of the ex
cessive publicity by the United
States. He said it was analogous
to a bank suddenly calling its
big depositors up and telling
them not to worry about the
bank failing. A run on the bank
is inevitable.
Tarshis said that this induced
fear was a major cause for the
recent dip in our gold reserves.
