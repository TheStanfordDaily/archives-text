# Teachers Study Sociologically
## 
### 
A unique sociology institute,
involving 30 secondary school
teachers and a full-size demon
stration class of 23 juniors and
seniors from the Palo Alto Uni
fied School District, will get its
first test at Stanford University
next summer.
The 30 secondary school
teachers, chosen on the basis
of "best qualified" from all over
the U.S., will spend eight weeks
at Stanford taking four special
courses in sociology and educa
tion.
These will include general
lectures, individual laboratory
research on special projects,
field study of community struc
tures, and small-group interac
tion. Particular attention will
be given to the new materials
for high schools developed by
the American Sociology Associ
ation.
Under the general supervision
of Prof. Richard E. Gross of the
Stanford School of Education,
president of the National Coun
cil for Social Studies, the insti
tute participants will also hear
from five or six leading Ameri
can sociologists who will be in
stitute guests.
The purpose of the institute,
which will be supported by a
grant from the National Science
Foundation, is to emphasize the
use of sociology in high school
social studies classes.
"We need to incorporate more
behavioral science into the tra
ditional social studies curricu
lum," Prof. Gross explained, "to
balance the historically oriented
approach."
The group will study trends
and innovations in social studies
curriculum development, includ
ing the use of games and simu
lation of real-life activities.
The Palo Alto district high
school students will put in two
hours a day in class, Monday
through Friday, and participate
twice a week in the laboratory
and field sessions.
Their teacher will also come
from the Palo Alto school sys
tem. He or she will have taught
a preliminary sociology course
during the second semester be
ginning next month. Actual ad
ministration of the program
will be under Prof. Emily Gir
ault, a former teacher in the
Palo Alto system, who also has
taught in Denver, at San Fran
cisco State and at an overseas
U.S. dependent's school in Mu
nich.
Prof. Girault, who was a
member of the visiting faculty
at Stanford during 1966 sum
mer session, is now assistant
professor of education at the
University of Michigan and a
research associate at the Michi
gan Institute of Social Re
search.
