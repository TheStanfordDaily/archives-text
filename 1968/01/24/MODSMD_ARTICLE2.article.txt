## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The University is "seriously
considering" converting Alpha
Tau Omicron house into regu
lar student housing next fall
when the fraternity moves into
a new cluster residence.
Edward A. Scoles, assistant
business manager for residences,
said a contractor has looked at
the ATO house to estimate the
costs of modifications necessary
for continued occupancy.
The University already In
tends to buy the ATO house
as well as Chi Psi and Delta
Kappa Epsllon houses. Stan
ford already owns the Phi
Gamma Delta (Fiji) and Al
pha Sigma Phi residences.
Only the ATO house can con
tinue to house students, accord
ing to Scoles and Dan Williams,
assistant dean of students.
The ATO house could be used
for an independent men's resi
dence or could be part of a
coed housing plan. "Within a
month's time the whole picture
will be much clearer," Scoles
said. Several University commit
tees are currently working on an
overall residences plan for un
dergraduates. University offi
cials have indicated that a stair
well enclosure and an outside
fire escape would be added at
Stanford's expense to meet de
mands of Santa Clara fire mar
shals.
Currently the ATO house has
33 residents. The new cluster
house, now being built next to
Cowell Health Center, will hold
50.
Alpha Sigma Phi, scattered
among Manzanita house, Hous
ton house and two trailers, will
also move into a new cluster
building. Scoles said the Chinese
Club might be relocated into
Houston house. The proposed
new law school would take the
site of the present Chinese Club,
situated directly behind the post
office.
