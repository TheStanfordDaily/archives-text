# Teletype Links Schools In Tenn. With Stanford
## 
### 
Major expansion of the tele
type network which provides
mathematics drill and practice
from a Stanford computer to
schools in the Eastern and
Southern U.S. is well underway.
Starting last week, 30 tele
type machines went into opera
tion at Breckenridge School,
Morehead State College, Ken
tucky.
Second through sixth graders
will practice daily at the ma
chines at Breckenridge, which
is the demonstration school at
Morehead State College.
Their practice began last
spring when 26 machines were
placed in operation. The ma
chines are "multiplexed" into
two table-top computers, one at
Morehead, the other at Stan
ford's Institute for the Study
of Mathematics in the Social
Sciences (ISMSS) directed by
Philosophy Prof. Patrick Sup
pes, pioneer in the field of com
puter-assisted instruction (CAI).
"These computers talk to each
other automatically," Suppes
explains, "then give and receive
information about the student,
increasing the difficulty of the
material as the student im
proves."

When the network was tested
and put into operation last
spring, the event marked the
first time a transcontinental
educational computer hookup
had beon attempted.
Distance is no problem. The
machine, after programming,
keeps track of the student by
name and number, remembers
his skills and progress, and
feeds new materials as the oc
casion requires. The student sits
down at the terminal, types out
his name and number, and the
computer does the rest.
In the Breckenridge opera
tion, plans are afoot to move
terminals into schools in 10
Eastern Kentuck counties in the
heart of the "poverty pockets"
in the coal-mining areas of the
Western Appalachians.
Some of the schools are as
much as 300 miles apart. Where
necessary, telephone lines will
be installed or improved to
bring the system to previously
isolated schools.
Teachers anywhere on the
network can query the comput
er for an instant print-out on
the progress and abilities of any
of their students.
