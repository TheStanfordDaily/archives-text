# Stanford Shop Serves Shoes
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Near the Bookstore and the
Placement Service, the Campus
Shoe Store hides behind a
clump of trees.
Its main room is a clutter of
polishes, laces, and worn-out
shoes, yet it has managed to do
an active business of shining,
repairing, and dyeing shoes
since 1912.
Maurice Delyon, its owner,
has run the store since 1936. In
those thirty-two years, he has
only missed two days of work.
Delyon is helped by Tony
Alexander, who is also no new
comer to the Campus Shoe
Store. He has been there since
1948 when he was much "youn
ger and wilder," he says.
The two have observed many
changes in Stanford's students,
campus and shoe styles.
Save the Goldfish
Delyon notices that today's
students are "more brilliant on
politics and more active in af
fairs around them." It is "a
healthy sort of thing that stu
dents do wake up" to world af
fairs.
"It's a lot better than swal
lowing goldfish and standing
under a shower for a length of
time. The old crowd was more
sports minded." During Big
Game week, one could feel the
"game fever" during the whole
time.
Students used to wear two
toned saddle shoes, which were
"quite practical on campus,"
says Deylon. Today most stu
dents wear loafers. In recent
years, Alexander has seen an
increase in the number of san
dals.
As the campus has expanded,
shoe wear has become a more
serious problem. The shop does
"thousands and thousands" of
heel jobs each year, according

to Alexander. Evidently women
walk more than men, for al
though they are in the minority,
women bring in almost as many
shoes to be fixed as the men do.
Cardboard Shoes
Alexander claims shoes wear
out faster now due to the
cheapened quality of the shoes.
He remarked scornfully that
modern shoes are pust "lots of
paper." Delyon said that manu
facturers are substituting leath
er with materials like plastics
and specially-treated cardboard.
The Campus Shoe Store is
one of a very few privately
owned enterprises on campus.
Dwight Adams, business man
ager of the University, ex
plained that "the only reason
we have services is where
there's a need. It is not for
money."
Although "every conceivable
commercial type of venture"
has tried to establish itself on
campus, only those that bene
fit both students and faculty
and which would be hard to
reach off-campus are allowed to
rent from the University. He
said, "We don't want to de
velop a shopping center on cam
pus."
Adams said the Campus Shoe
Store keeps a "balance between
quality, price, and service." In
Alexander's opinion, the prices
at the store are lower than
those downtown, but he com
mented Stanford students are
"not as price conscious as in
the old days."
Bare Feet?
Business is good although it
fluctuates. It climbs slowly in
the beginning of the school year
and reaches a peak from No
vember to February. It falls off
in the summer with the warm
weather.
Both Alexander and Delyon
enjoy working with the stu
dents. Alexander said, "I have
n't had a falling out with a per
son since I've been here. Not
even a squabble. There's so
many just beautiful people."
Delyon and j Alexander like
the campus. Delyon is from
Palo Alto and enjoys this area.
"I've always lived here and
don't choose to leave it.""The
new improvements are beauti
ful. The new library is the finest
building in architecture." The
"UGLY" is Tony's specialty
too for it is the "beautifullest
building" around.

SHOESTORE — Tony Alexander, shoemaker at the Stanford cam
pa* shoe»fcore, repairs a shoe for a customer. Tony and Maurice Dey
lon, who have run the shop since 1936, operate the store adjacent to
the Placement Service.
Near the Bookstore and the
Placement Service, the Campus
Shoe Store hides behind a
clump of trees.
Its main room is a clutter of
polishes, laces, and worn-out
shoes, yet it has managed to do
an active business of shining,
repairing, and dyeing shoes
since 1912.
Maurice Delyon, its owner,
has run the store since 1936. In
those thirty-two years, he has
only missed two days of work.
Delyon is helped by Tony
Alexander, who is also no new
comer to the Campus Shoe
Store. He has been there since
1948 when he was much "youn
ger and wilder," he says.
The two have observed many
changes in Stanford's students,
campus and shoe styles.
Save the Goldfish
Delyon notices that today's
students are "more brilliant on
politics and more active in af
fairs around them." It is "a
healthy sort of thing that stu
dents do wake up" to world af
fairs.
"It's a lot better than swal
lowing goldfish and standing
under a shower for a length of
time. The old crowd was more
sports minded." During Big
Game week, one could feel the
"game fever" during the whole
time.
Students used to wear two
toned saddle shoes, which were
"quite practical on campus,"
says Deylon. Today most stu
dents wear loafers. In recent
years, Alexander has seen an
increase in the number of san
dals.
As the campus has expanded,
shoe wear has become a more
serious problem. The shop does
"thousands and thousands" of
heel jobs each year, according

to Alexander. Evidently women
walk more than men, for al
though they are in the minority,
women bring in almost as many
shoes to be fixed as the men do.
Cardboard Shoes
Alexander claims shoes wear
out faster now due to the
cheapened quality of the shoes.
He remarked scornfully that
modern shoes are pust "lots of
paper." Delyon said that manu
facturers are substituting leath
er with materials like plastics
and specially-treated cardboard.
The Campus Shoe Store is
