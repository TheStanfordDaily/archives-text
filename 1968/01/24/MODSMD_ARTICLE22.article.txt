# SES Review Unit 'Gadfly' To Study
## 
### 
The ASSU committee recently
formed as a review board for
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) plans to seek and
reflect student opinion concern
ing the future of Stanford's un
dergraduate education, acting as
a gadfly to the study as a whole.
The board's goals, according
to chairman Hugh MacMillan,
are to represent student inter
ests to the Packer Committee of
SES through criticism of the
Study's programs and emphasis
on areas of change important to
students. MacMillan hopes that
the board will influence the
Study of Education's recommen
dations through cooperation
with the SES or publication by
the student committee of a mi
nority position paper "if no re
sults are achieved."
Review board members plan
to continue discussions in uni
versity residences to sample stu
dent opinion on undergraduate
education and the SES. The
board also holds weekly meet
ings that are open to the public
to discuss future actions.
MacMillan and other board
members agree that the results
of the SES and the success of
the ASSU committee depend
upon student interest. MacMil
lan emphasized, "We need more
members and more publicity to
function more effectively as a
student lobby."
He pointed out that several
of the dorm meetings last week
failed because of a lack of ade
quate publicity.
"We must reach the students
through these discussions in liv
ing groups," MacMillan added.
The board also welcomes writ
ten student recommendations to
the review board and SES on
questions arising in the residen
tial discussions.
The student review board has
not made any specific criticisms
to the Packer Committee yet,
since the board is still in its for
mative stage. "We are not real
ly in any hurry to offer sugges
tions at this time. We plan to
act with caution," said MacMil
lan. As the SES committees re
lease more reports, the review
board plans to step up its ac
tion.
MacMillan forsees an "intelli
gent proposal for reform" as the
final product of the Study of Ed
ucation, but he believes that con
crete predictions of specific
changes in undergraduate edu
cation cannot yet be made.
However, he cites experiment
al coed housing programs, off
campus living for undergradu
eat women, the abolition of acti
vity credits, and the permission
to twenty undergraduates to de
sign their own programs of
study as "quick steps for
change" that were instigated re
cently.
Neither MacMillan nor board

member David Alkire felt that
Stanford students were apathetic
toward the SES project. MacMil
lan said that students were not
informed of the Study's goals
because of a previous lack of
personal contact between SES
and the students.
Alkire maintained, "Students
are not apathetic, but they feel
that there are too many other
concerns today. They also tend
to believe that their desires for
change will not be put into ef
fect."

study as "quick steps for
change" that were instigated re
cently.
Neither MacMillan nor board

member David Alkire felt that
Stanford students were apathetic
toward the SES project. MacMil
lan said that students were not
informed of the Study's goals
because of a previous lack of
personal contact between SES
and the students.
Alkire maintained, "Students
are not apathetic, but they feel
that there are too many other
concerns today. They also tend
to believe that their desires for
change will not be put into ef
fect."
The ASSU committee recently
formed as a review board for
the Study of Education at Stan
ford (SES) plans to seek and
reflect student opinion concern
ing the future of Stanford's un
dergraduate education, acting as
a gadfly to the study as a whole.
The board's goals, according
to chairman Hugh MacMillan,
are to represent student inter
ests to the Packer Committee of
SES through criticism of the
Study's programs and emphasis
on areas of change important to
students. MacMillan hopes that
the board will influence the
Study of Education's recommen
dations through cooperation
with the SES or publication by
the student committee of a mi
nority position paper "if no re
sults are achieved."
Review board members plan
to continue discussions in uni
versity residences to sample stu
dent opinion on undergraduate
education and the SES. The
board also holds weekly meet
ings that are open to the public
to discuss future actions.
MacMillan and other board
members agree that the results
of the SES and the success of
the ASSU committee depend
upon student interest. MacMil
lan emphasized, "We need more
members and more publicity to
function more effectively as a
student lobby."
He pointed out that several
of the dorm meetings last week
failed because of a lack of ade
quate publicity.
"We must reach the students
through these discussions in liv
ing groups," MacMillan added.
The board also welcomes writ
ten student recommendations to
the review board and SES on
questions arising in the residen
tial discussions.
The student review board has
not made any specific criticisms
to the Packer Committee yet,
since the board is still in its for
mative stage. "We are not real
ly in any hurry to offer sugges
tions at this time. We plan to
act with caution," said MacMil
lan. As the SES committees re
lease more reports, the review
board plans to step up its ac
tion.
MacMillan forsees an "intelli
gent proposal for reform" as the
final product of the Study of Ed
ucation, but he believes that con
crete predictions of specific
changes in undergraduate edu
cation cannot yet be made.
However, he cites experiment
al coed housing programs, off
campus living for undergradu
eat women, the abolition of acti
vity credits, and the permission
to twenty undergraduates to de
sign their own programs of
study as "quick steps for
change" that were instigated re
cently.
