# Seek Easy A's
## 'Mickey's' Found In Many Places 
### SCOTT KEENEY 
A "mickey" is many things.
A two-eared mouse, the Cal
band, a powerful purgative, an
Irishman, a potato, ... an easy
course.
"Mickeys" in the form of easy
courses catapulted Stanford into
the national educational grime
lite recently.
Time magazine featured an
article in early December about
"mickeys" on American college
campuses. And right there, right
sharing the wealth of Time's
verbal palette glowing with such
phrases as "rocks for jocks,"
"micks," "roaring guts," "snaps,"
and such names as Stanford Pro
fessors Oliver Byrd and James
Watkins.
Health Ed 400
The Time article, drawing on
reports previously published in
The Daily, put the finger on
Byrd's Health Education 400 as
an easy course which athletes
and others took for large num
bers of units.
Watkins was said to grade
easily in his political science
courses. Time quoted him as
saying, "There is too much ten
sion in the University — I don't
want to add to the general in
security and unhappiness of the
community."
So much for the mickeys Time
uncovered. What other ones exist

in this, the "Harvard of the
West?"
When questioned, many stu
dents mention Civil Engineering
170, "Man and His Environ
ment," nicknamed "Sewage-Gar
bage," whose teacher allegedly
mentioned on the first day of
class that students need not
attend on nice days because he
would be playing golf.
Library Course
Other students cite: "Use of
the Library," calling it an "easy
unit of A"; Psych 60 or Stat 50,
"five unit courses with two and
a half units of work"; "general
studies courses with a '1' beside
their name"; Engineering 11,
where one student went to three
classes and the final and got an
A; Engineering 9, where "You
have to draw some beep-beep";
"overseas campuses, where you
fulfill all your humanities and
social sciences requirements and
have fun doing it"; the English
campus, "because all the misfits
are there."
The list of mickeys students
mention is endless: Bio 4 and 5;
ROTC courses, which one stu
dent feels are on "an A curve";
physical science courses that ful
fill science requirements; "phys
ed, now for academic credit";
"Economics 1"; Chem 4 and 5;
freshman seminars "where A's
are automatic''; and pass-fail

courses. One student said, "My
research project Is six units of
easy A."
No Agreement
Obviously, a mick Is many
things to many people. And all
people do not agree.
What is a mickey course? Is it
a course where an A comes with
little time spent, with little
thought or morethan-superficial
probing? Is it a course with an
A curve, where average achieve
ment earns A grades, instead
of a B, B-C, or C curve?
Is a mickey easy for everyone,
or for just some people? And a
big question: is Stanford a
mickey because of the fabled
"Stanford Curve," which sup
posedly considers the average
grade to be a B minus?
Really Mickeys?
And, most important, are
there really mickeys at Stan
ford?
Bob Hogueland, a senior in
communications and a veteran
of five health courses, calls the
mickeys at Stanford a veritable
"goldmine." He refuses to cite
examples beyond "the one where
I got D minuses on the mid
term and final and got a B minus
in the course."
But Robert Hind, associate
dean of undergraduate educa
cation, feels, "I don't think it
(mickeys) is a problem." Hind
continues: "When I was a stu

dent, there were a lot more of
what today's students call mick
eys."
Grade Pressure
Hind feels it is unfortunate
that grade pressure forces stu
dents to seek courses to bolster
their grade point averages. He
adds that the student must de
cide whether he will waste time
and money on courses in which
he doesn't learn.
Herbert Packer, chairman of
the SES steering committee, says
individual departments polico
themselves with regard to mick
eys. He mentions "informal pres
sure" which keeps "courses up
to snuff."
Some formal studies are be
ing done, however. Freshman
seminars are often mentioned as
mickeys by students. A study to
be conducted by Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch, in collaboration with
Hind and General Studies Chair
man Robert Walker, will speci
fically question "work load,"
"grading patterns," and "com
parisons of seminars to other
courses at Stanford."
Pass-Fall Mickey?
Does pass-fail convert a
course into a mickey by reduc
ing the work needed to get a
passable grade?
Professor Michael Novak
urges his "Belief and Unbelief"
students to take the course pass
fail, and 70 per cent do. He

notices no difference in the cali
ber of work done by pass-fail
students and that done by con
ventionally graded students. (He
also mentions that his is a poor
course to test such an hypothe
sis.)
On the other hand, an infor
mal count reveals that 90 per
cent of last quarter's Anthropo
logy 1 students who took
course pass-fail received C's or
D's on the final. The overall per
centage of C's and D's wer
lower.
Mickey Majors?
Are there mickey majors? The
engineers vilify the poly sci's;
the law heap cituperation upon
the biz; the English belittle the
communications.
A chart is presented herewith
to resolve (or try to) the ques
tion of mickey majors and mick
ey departments. It shows the
overall grade average meted out
by each department, on three
course levels.
In general, high level courses
have higher grade averages.
The seminars, senior colloquia
and undergraduate specials have
the highest GPA — 3.59.
Closely following are the ele
mentary level courses in ROTC,
humanities, English and the
overseas campus programs.
The toughest elementary cour
ses seem to be physical sciences,
biology and geology — at least
according to the GPAs.
