Mr. Edwards, associated with
Stanford all his life, left the
University in 1906, his senior
year, to become a newspaper
reporter. His abilities were so
apparent that E. W. Scripps,
who founded more daily news
papers than any other Ameri
can publisher, named the youth
ful Edwards in 1911 to serve
as founding editor of the Hous
ton Press.
His first newspaper job was
as reporter and assistant to the
editor on the San Francisco
News in 1907 fresh out of school.
He subsequently worked for the
United Press, where UP execu
tive Robert F. Paine spotted
him as a young man with great
potential. When the Dallas Dis
patch was started, Mr. Edwards
became assistant to the editor,

and when the Houston paper
was started a few years later,
young Edwards got the top
spot.
In later years, he served with
distinction as editor-in-chief of
the Scripps-Howard Southwest
ern group, as editor of the San
Diego Sun, then returned to the
San Francisco News, his first
paper, as associate editor and
chief editorial writer.
He won the University's high
est accolade, the title of "Un
common Man," in lieu of the
bachelor's degree he never ac
quired.
Mr. Edwards served as a Uni
versity trustee for 11 years,
five of them as board president,
and even after his retirement
continued as a volunteer in
many capacities. He was co
editor with Prof. Edgar Eugene
Robinson of "The Memoirs of
Ray Lyman Wilbur," published
in 1960 by Stanford University
Press.
In his late years, he was a
familiar figure on the campus,
and could often be found chat
ting with groups of students,
faculty, or staff members.
He died at the age of 80 July
23, 1962. His widow now lives in
Palo Alto, as does his son, Paul
C. EJwards Jr.

Mr. Edwards, associated with
Stanford all his life, left the
University in 1906, his senior
year, to become a newspaper
reporter. His abilities were so
apparent that E. W. Scripps,
who founded more daily news
papers than any other Ameri
can publisher, named the youth
ful Edwards in 1911 to serve
as founding editor of the Hous
ton Press.
His first newspaper job was
as reporter and assistant to the
