# Krech Predicts Ability To Regulate Learning
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
Present biochemical research
indicates it will be possible in
the future to alter "personality
traits, abilities, skills, and (ap
ply) supplemental therapy to
help heal the mentally retarded
and senile," declared Berkeley
Professor David Krech.
Memory is entirely a physical
process dependent upon chemi
cals, proteins and macro-mole
cules which combine to form
our "chemical brain-soup," de
clared Krech, the fourth speaker
in this quarter's Century 21
series. He spoke before an over
flow crowd last night in Tresid
der's large lounge.

Tomorrow night Century 21
will feature E. Fuller Torrey,
M.D., who will discuss ethical
Issues In the future of medi
cine. Torrey will speak In
Dinkelspiel Auditorium at
7:30 p.m.
The main question the people
of the twenty-first century will
have to answer, Krech pointed
out, will not be how to alter
memory and learning by bio
chemical processes, but "who
will direct what should be
done."
"Shall our experts raise or
lower aggressiveness, senility,
musical ability?" asked Krech.
He added that the rulers of the
future will have the potential
power to set goals, values and
aims.
He related a number of ex
periments which prove man's
total dependence upon chemical
matter. In some experiments
rats' memories improved dra
matically when the rats ate
brains of other rats who had
been trained to do specific tasks.
In other experiments the
memories of goldfish were dras
tically reduced when they were
injected with certain antibiotics
which inhibited the production
of new protein and RNA in the
brain. These two substances
were found to be especially im
portant to the long term mem
ory process.
Krech is presently working

on his own experiments in
which he is further examining
the relationship between chemi
cals and the brain.
Regarding the future of brain
control, Krech said, "I refuse
to prognosticate. I feel much too
pessimistic to inflict predictions
about Century 21. Indeed, I can
not even predict with confidence
that we will have a Century 21."

ATO, A DORM? — University officials are considering plans to convert the ATO house, shown here,
into a dorm facility when the fraternity moves into a new cluster residence. The house may be used
for an independent men's residence or become a coed facility.

"Shall our experts raise or
lower aggressiveness, senility,
musical ability?" asked Krech.
He added that the rulers of the
future will have the potential
power to set goals, values and
aims.
He related a number of ex
periments which prove man's
total dependence upon chemical
matter. In some experiments
rats' memories improved dra
matically when the rats ate
brains of other rats who had
been trained to do specific tasks.
In other experiments the
memories of goldfish were dras
tically reduced when they were
injected with certain antibiotics
which inhibited the production
of new protein and RNA in the
brain. These two substances
were found to be especially im
portant to the long term mem
ory process.
Krech is presently working

on his own experiments in
which he is further examining
the relationship between chemi
cals and the brain.
Regarding the future of brain
control, Krech said, "I refuse
to prognosticate. I feel much too
pessimistic to inflict predictions
about Century 21. Indeed, I can
not even predict with confidence
that we will have a Century 21."

ATO, A DORM? — University officials are considering plans to convert the ATO house, shown here,
into a dorm facility when the fraternity moves into a new cluster residence. The house may be used
for an independent men's residence or become a coed facility.


E. FULLER TORREY, M.D. con
tinues the Century 21 series with
a talk on "Ethical Issues in Fu
ture Medicine" tonight in Dlnkel
spiel at 7:30. Torrey will speci
fically discuss contraception,
abortion, sterilization, artificial
insemination, and control of the
mind, among other topics.
Present biochemical research
indicates it will be possible in
the future to alter "personality
traits, abilities, skills, and (ap
ply) supplemental therapy to
help heal the mentally retarded
and senile," declared Berkeley
Professor David Krech.
Memory is entirely a physical
process dependent upon chemi
cals, proteins and macro-mole
cules which combine to form
our "chemical brain-soup," de
clared Krech, the fourth speaker
in this quarter's Century 21
series. He spoke before an over
flow crowd last night in Tresid
der's large lounge.

Tomorrow night Century 21
will feature E. Fuller Torrey,
M.D., who will discuss ethical
Issues In the future of medi
cine. Torrey will speak In
Dinkelspiel Auditorium at
7:30 p.m.
The main question the people
of the twenty-first century will
have to answer, Krech pointed
out, will not be how to alter
memory and learning by bio
chemical processes, but "who
will direct what should be
done."
"Shall our experts raise or
lower aggressiveness, senility,
musical ability?" asked Krech.
