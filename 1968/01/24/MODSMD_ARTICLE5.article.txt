# City Council Acts
## P.A. Accepts Hospital Plan 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council
voted unanimously Monday
night to approve "in principle"
and "as a basis for negotiations"
Stanford President J. Wallace
Sterling's proposal that the Uni
versity assume full control of
the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital
Center.
The decision means that, after
more than a year of delibera
tion, Palo Alto is ready to get
out of the hospital business.
Stanford intends to convert the
center into a teaching hospital.
The medical center, which
is jointly administered by the
University and the city, now
operates about 570 beds. Palo
Alto owns 370 of them.
The resolution to approve
Sterling's proposal was pre
sented to the council as an urg

ency matter by Robert Cooley,
chairman of the Finance-Hos
pital Committee. It did not ap
pear on the agenda.
Council members Kirke W.
Comstock and Enid Pearson
both introduced amendments to
the resolution calling for strong
er guarantees of hospital beds
to Palo Alto residents. Both
amendments were rejected by a
vote of 7-2.
Councilmen William H. Clark
and Frank Gallagher abstained
from all voting. Dr. Clark is
affiliated with the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic and Gallagher is
an employee of Stanford Uni
versity.
The possibility of a lay board
to assist in the administration
of the hospital was raised by
several council members. Mayor

Dias reported that Dr. Robert
Glaser, dean of the Stanford
Medical School, had approved
this idea in principle and that
it would be one of the points
that would be discussed in fu
ture negotiations.
City Manager George Mor
gan emphasized that the Uni
versity wants to acquire "full
administrative and operation
al control of the medical facil
ities. The proposed lay board
would presumably serve an
advisory function.
Last year Stanford offered $5
million for Palo Alto's interest
in the hospital. That offer dif
fered from the one that was
accepted in that it did not sug
gest any guarantees of medical
services or physician access to
the community.
City Controller Alfred Mitch

ell last week estimated the pres
ent value of thr> Palo Alto invest
ment in the medical facilities to
be $6.1 million, not counting the
value of leases which the city
holds on land adjoining the Hos
pital Center.
Morgan said yesterday that
he forsres four or five months
of negotiations before a final
agreement can be worked out.

Sterling's proposal that the Uni
versity assume full control of
the Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital
Center.
The decision means that, after
more than a year of delibera
tion, Palo Alto is ready to get
out of the hospital business.
Stanford intends to convert the
center into a teaching hospital.
The medical center, which
is jointly administered by the
University and the city, now
operates about 570 beds. Palo
Alto owns 370 of them.
The resolution to approve
Sterling's proposal was pre
sented to the council as an urg

ency matter by Robert Cooley,
chairman of the Finance-Hos
pital Committee. It did not ap
pear on the agenda.
Council members Kirke W.
Comstock and Enid Pearson
both introduced amendments to
the resolution calling for strong
er guarantees of hospital beds
to Palo Alto residents. Both
amendments were rejected by a
vote of 7-2.
Councilmen William H. Clark
and Frank Gallagher abstained
from all voting. Dr. Clark is
affiliated with the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic and Gallagher is
an employee of Stanford Uni
versity.
The possibility of a lay board
to assist in the administration
of the hospital was raised by
several council members. Mayor

Dias reported that Dr. Robert
Glaser, dean of the Stanford
Medical School, had approved
this idea in principle and that
it would be one of the points
that would be discussed in fu
ture negotiations.
City Manager George Mor
gan emphasized that the Uni
versity wants to acquire "full
administrative and operation
al control of the medical facil
ities. The proposed lay board
would presumably serve an
advisory function.
Last year Stanford offered $5
million for Palo Alto's interest
in the hospital. That offer dif
fered from the one that was
accepted in that it did not sug
gest any guarantees of medical
services or physician access to
the community.
City Controller Alfred Mitch

ell last week estimated the pres
ent value of thr> Palo Alto invest
ment in the medical facilities to
be $6.1 million, not counting the
value of leases which the city
holds on land adjoining the Hos
pital Center.
Morgan said yesterday that
he forsres four or five months
of negotiations before a final
agreement can be worked out.
The Palo Alto City Council
voted unanimously Monday
night to approve "in principle"
and "as a basis for negotiations"
