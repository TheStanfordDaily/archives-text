# Bookstores Elsewhere
## Problems Widespread 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ (Last of a Series) 
"It's too bad the Bookstore
got wise and started using two
different colored bags," a Stan
ford sophomore said recently,
"Now it's harder to steal books."
This contributor to the 160
plus percent increase in stealing
at the store last year explained
the old method of thievery and
the new problems the brown
and white shopping bags cause.
A student would enter the
store, pick up a shopping- bag,
and fill it with books. He then
would go to the returns coun
ter and say, "I want to return
these books, and I forgot the
receipt Do I need one?"
Naturally, the answer was
yes, and so the pilferer, saying
that he would go home to get
the cash register slip, merrily
marched out with his load of
texts, to be sold elsewhere.
Now the bookstore gives out
brown bags for use inside the
store, the student claimed, and
white ones after purchase.
Therefore, any returned books
would have to be in white bags
—which the students don't get
now until they have purchased
books.
Other college bookstores have
been having problems with
stealing. William Kimball, man

ager of the Stanford store, says
that the normal rate is more
than two percent of sales, while
the frequency here last year,
even with the increase, was only
1.35 per cent.
At the University of New
Mexico, the store head claims
that between three and four
thousand dollars in merchandise
is stolen each year, the greatest
loss being in books.
The theives there some
times act in rings, the school's
newspaper reports. Three or
four enter the store together,
and while some create a dis
turbance in one part of the
store, the others walk off with
armfuis of books.
Other college stores have dif
ferent difficulties. Bookstores
around Amherst have been run
ning into troubles with a Massa
chusetts sales tax. State law ex
empts texts from the tax if
the purchaser has a special
form signed by the professor
who required the book.
The school is challenging the
fact that only the specific form
may be used and not a substi
tute, as they would like. There
fore, the area bookstores are in
doubt as to whether they should
charge the tax.
If they don't, and the state
rules that they should, the

stores must make up the uncol
lected tax themselves.
At Temple, the university
owned bookstore has recently
come under pressure because of
inefficient operation — students
must sometimes wait in line
four hours to purchase books—
and a lack of a student discount,
which stores at other colleges
in the area do give.
At the University of Mine
sota, the newly-formed Union
of Students has complained to
the administration about the
school-owned bookstore there.
Presently, profits from the
stores go to two areas: schol
arship funds and bookstore ex
pansion. The students want a
five pere en t discount on
books, and a say in whether
additional bookstores should
be built —and therefore a say
in how much of the profits go
to scholarships.
UCLA students have com
plained about profits made by
the Associated Students-owned
store there, claiming they are
too large. They have also ex
pressed dissatisfaction with the
eight percent rebate system
there: students must stand in
line with their receipts, and can
only get a credit toward their
next book purchase.
So Stanford is not the only
school with Bookstore problems.
