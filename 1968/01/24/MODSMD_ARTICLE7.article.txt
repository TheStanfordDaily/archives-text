## Greek Military Regime Gets U.S. Recognition 
### 
ATHENS, Greece (AP)—The
United States dropped its boy
cott of the Greek regime yester
day and resumed normal diplo
matic contacts with the leaders
who quashed King Constantine's
countercoup in December.
U.S. Ambassador Philips Tal
bot signified the end of Wash
ington's snub by calling on For
eign Minister Panayiotis Pipine
lis and telling newsmen after
ward: "This is really the re
sumption of normal diplomatic
contacts."
This the United States be
came the second member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion to give de-facto recognition
to the army colonels running
this NATO nation.
Turkey, a NATO member,
and the Congo extended recogni
tion earlier this month. Spain
did the same within an hour
after Talbot's announcemet.
Czechoslovakia also recog
nized the government Tuesday.
Washington's action was an
enormous relief for the ruling
junta. It almost certainly meant
that other Western nations like
Britain, West Germany and Italy
would soon follow suit.
The Western powers refused
open contacts with the regime
after Constantine fled toRRonm n
Dec. 14, the day after his effort
to oust the junta collapsed.
It was not clear what effect
the resumption of normal ties
between Athens and other world
capitals would ultimately have
on the future of the king.
Module Big Success
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. (AP)
— Space agency officials report

ed yesterday that America's first
Lunar Module achieved 96 per
cent of its major test objectives
in a remarkable performance
that practically assured the
craft's next flight would be
manned.
Experts began extensive ex
amination of data received from
the eight-hour flight, which was
rescued from possible failure
Monday by quick action from a
ground control crew headed by
youthful flight director Eugene
Kranz.
George M. Low, manager of
the Apollo spacecraft program
office, said, "I hope that our
data evaluation will confirm
and will show with this flight
and with some additional
ground tests that we are ready
to fly men in the Lunar Mod
ule."
If so, a second unmanned
flight scheduled in May would
be cancelled and astronauts con
ceivably could ride the lunar
landing craft on an earth orbit
test late this year. That would
be a rehearsal for a man-to-the
moon trip next year.
Johnson Announces
Big Manpower Plan
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson sent Congress a
record-setting $2.1-billion man
power proposal yesterday. It
features a plan to attack hard
core unemployment in the slums
of the 15 largest cities.
But the suggested new pro
gram, even if enacted promptly
by Congress, could be expected
to have little or no impact on
restlessness in the slums this
summer. This is so because its

aim of providing 500,000 new
jobs for slum dwellers would be
carried out gradually over a
three-year period.
Here, in brief, is how John
son's plan would work:
1. The government would lo
cate, by name and address, men
and women who because they
lack training or education or
are otherwise disadvantaged,
cannot reasonably expect to find
jobs even in times of great pros
perity.
2. Private employers would
hire and train these people for
skilled jobs on their regular
payrolls.
3. Government would pro
vide a subsidy by paying the
difference between training
costs for an average worker and
extra outlays required to fit the
hard core jobless for regular
employment.
