## Greek Military Regime Gets U.S. Recognition 
### 
ATHENS, Greece (AP)—The
United States dropped its boy
cott of the Greek regime yester
day and resumed normal diplo
matic contacts with the leaders
who quashed King Constantine's
countercoup in December.
U.S. Ambassador Philips Tal
bot signified the end of Wash
ington's snub by calling on For
eign Minister Panayiotis Pipine
lis and telling newsmen after
ward: "This is really the re
sumption of normal diplomatic
contacts."
This the United States be
came the second member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion to give de-facto recognition
to the army colonels running
this NATO nation.
Turkey, a NATO member,
and the Congo extended recogni
tion earlier this month. Spain
did the same within an hour
after Talbot's announcemet.
Czechoslovakia also recog
nized the government Tuesday.
Washington's action was an
enormous relief for the ruling
junta. It almost certainly meant
that other Western nations like
Britain, West Germany and Italy
would soon follow suit.
The Western powers refused
open contacts with the regime
after Constantine fled toRRonm n
Dec. 14, the day after his effort
to oust the junta collapsed.
It was not clear what effect
the resumption of normal ties
between Athens and other world
capitals would ultimately have
on the future of the king.
Module Big Success
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. (AP)
— Space agency officials report

ed yesterday that America's first
Lunar Module achieved 96 per
cent of its major test objectives
in a remarkable performance
that practically assured the
craft's next flight would be
manned.
Experts began extensive ex
amination of data received from
the eight-hour flight, which was
rescued from possible failure
Monday by quick action from a
ground control crew headed by
youthful flight director Eugene
Kranz.
George M. Low, manager of
the Apollo spacecraft program
office, said, "I hope that our
data evaluation will confirm
and will show with this flight
and with some additional
ground tests that we are ready
to fly men in the Lunar Mod
ule."
If so, a second unmanned
flight scheduled in May would
be cancelled and astronauts con
ceivably could ride the lunar
landing craft on an earth orbit
test late this year. That would
be a rehearsal for a man-to-the
moon trip next year.
Johnson Announces
Big Manpower Plan
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson sent Congress a
record-setting $2.1-billion man
power proposal yesterday. It
features a plan to attack hard
core unemployment in the slums
of the 15 largest cities.
But the suggested new pro
gram, even if enacted promptly
by Congress, could be expected
to have little or no impact on
restlessness in the slums this
summer. This is so because its

aim of providing 500,000 new
jobs for slum dwellers would be
carried out gradually over a
three-year period.
Here, in brief, is how John
son's plan would work:
1. The government would lo
cate, by name and address, men
and women who because they
lack training or education or
are otherwise disadvantaged,
cannot reasonably expect to find
jobs even in times of great pros
perity.
2. Private employers would
hire and train these people for
skilled jobs on their regular
payrolls.
3. Government would pro
vide a subsidy by paying the
difference between training
costs for an average worker and
extra outlays required to fit the
hard core jobless for regular
employment.
U.S. Attack Signs
Found In Cambodia
KOMPONG TRABEK, Cam
bodia (AP) — Newsmen inspect
ing the area where Cambodia
says it repulsed U.S. South Viet
namese attack found two bloody
bandages, some insect repellent
containers marked "U.S." and
hundreds of .30-caliber shell
casings.
Some of the ground was
splotched with dried blood and
the trees were shedded and
blackened around the bullet
pocked fortified outpost where
the press chief of the Cambo
dian Ministry of Information
took newsmen for a briefing on
the incident last Thursday.
Cambodian officials sav their
forces killed three Americans
and 20 South Vietnamese who
they charge penetrated about
100 yards into Cambodia and
fired at Cambodian soldiers who
had been sleeping outside the
post.
The outpost is northwest of
Saigon in an area where the
border is poorly marked and
disputed, but the U.S. State De
partment in Washington ac
knowledged Monday that a
U.S.-South Vietnamese patrol
had intruded 75 yards inside
Cambodian territory last Thurs
day.
It sent formal regrets for any
Cambodian casualities that may
have resulted.
Reagan Discusses Pot
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagan said yesterday a relaxa
tion of California's stiff mari
juana law may be needed, but
not if it encourages the idea
marijuana isn't harmful to
young people.
Reagan's cautious statements
at his weekly news conference
came after Atty. Gen. Thomas
C. Lynch came out in flat oppo
sition to a significant change in
the law being sought in the leg
islature.
The change is being sponsored
by Republican Assemblyman W.
Craig Biddle of Riverside, chair
man of the Criminal Procedure
Committee. It would give the
judge discretion on sentencing
persons on marijuana posses
sion charges, allowing them to
hand down a lesser misdemean
or penalty of up to a year in
county jail.
At present, a judge can only

impose a felony penalty, which
draws up to 10 years in state
prison.
Barrier Set In Laos
VIENTIANE, Laos (AP)—A
high-government source said
yesterday a line across Laos to
block North Vietnamese move
ment will be electronic and will
include neither ground barriers
nor U.S. troops.
He implied that devices drop
ped from airplanes as well as
sophisticated airborne devices
will be used to check on the
movement of North Vietnamese
down the Ho Chi Minh trail of
eastern Laos to South Vietnam.
Actually, the United States
has long used electronic sys
tems, such as infrared cameras,
to photograph truck convoys at
night and U.S. bombers have
been called in to destroy these
movements.
The government of Laos, offi
cially neutral, has been embar
rassed by these reports. The
high government source said he
was unaware any such exten
sion had been carried out. The
U.S. Embassy declined to discuss
any aspect of the barrier.
