# Sinking Deeper And Deeper Into Widening Credibility Gap
## 
### Henry J. Taylor 
President Johnson's $186 bil
lion budget proposal in his State
of the Union message couldn't
have been more inflationary if
he'd written it in dynamite,
and much of its justification for
the over-spending is the same
old political raccoon with just
another ring around it tail.
How much government over
spending and debt we can stand
is the great standing question.
The message brushes this off
entirely. I don't know to what
beach Mr. Johnson goes to put
his head in the sand but there's
a lot of dangerous undertow
around there for us taxpayers.
With Mr. Johnson's popular
ity springing some leaks below
the water line, and intent on
reaching the haven of reelec
tion, he proposes still more
spending like a starved man at
the sound of a steak sizzling in
the pan. But what happens to
our country?
Conveniently not acknowledg
ing his Great Society's over
spending disease, he cannot
fathom the cure. Again refus
ing to apply priorities in the
spending, the State of the Un
ion message fails to measure
the real, the weighable, the mea
surable problems in our country
within our present powers to
solve them. The only solution
LBJ offers is that there is no
bottom to the barrel.
This epic of communication,
designed to move mountains, or
at least keep sycophants awake,
fails on both counts. It starts
off with sentences that are posi
tively Etruscan in their refusal
to be cracked. Then, reaching
deep in his bag of cliches for a

snapper, this old-style word
spinner ends it as he habitually
ends his speeches: Send me
more money.
In this Mr. Johnson has clear
ly fallen out of phase with the
folks back home, unless I am
deaf, dumb and blind every
where I go across the country.
The pollsters would have to be
wrong, too.
Dr. Gallup and most other
find that the rising cost of
living and of government
(taxes) are such a major con
cern of the American people
today that these rank even
ahead of the Vietnam war.
Further, millions ask—with
the war on poverty a local and
national shambles and the So
cial Security and welfare pro
grams loaded with abuse —how
long this prostitution of our
wealth can continue without
wrecking every decent concept
of our democratic system.
They feel that when a better
madhouse is built the Great
Society will build it, and that
Mr..Johnson's refrain of "Let's
all sing like the birdies sing"
is painfully, outrageously out
of date and out of place in a
country which feels that no
matter what we do, no matter
what sacrifices we make, we
are somehow being thrown
away. It is this widespread feel
ing of confusion, anxiety and
impatience— a nagging feeling
that the country's sacrifices
have got it nowhere—that the
State of the Union message
misses utterly.
Its next major contribution
is to the President's famous
"credibility gap." Millions ask

how we can spend billions to
guard against the gigantic, mer
ciless Sino-Soviet threat, fulfill
our unlimited commitment in
the Vietnamese war, support
the U.S. dollar's at-bay position
and still make good on the Pres
ident's expanded promises for
pie-in-the-sky.
Today's movement toward
nihilism, anarchy and alienation
—not alone among many young
people—and the cynicism that
accompanies it, never before
typical in our country, are in
large part due to the under
mined faith of our people.
The Kennedy and Johnson re
versals of their 1960 and 1964
promises were, and still are,
carried forth by deception, both
in domestic policy (both went
on and on to say, "I be
lieve in a balanced budget")
and in foreign policy (Cuba,
Laos, Berlin, Vietnam). The
people's lack of confidence in
the government's truth telling
is the inevtiable result.
This is most recently evi
denced, for example, by polls
indicating that the majority of
the American people do not be
lieve that they are being told
the full truth, or have ever
been told the full truth about
the Vietnam war.
Doubt is a cumulative process
and the gnawing, corrosive
doubt about President John
son's truth telling that saps our
strength and weakens our wills
is a shameful and dangerous
tragedy. In deepening the
doubts the message is like pour
ing water on a drowning man.

This is most recently evi
denced, for example, by polls
indicating that the majority of
the American people do not be
lieve that they are being told

been told the full truth about
the Vietnam war.
Doubt is a cumulative process

President Johnson's $186 bil
lion budget proposal in his State
of the Union message couldn't
have been more inflationary if
he'd written it in dynamite,
and much of its justification for
the over-spending is the same
old political raccoon with just
another ring around it tail.
How much government over
spending and debt we can stand
is the great standing question.
The message brushes this off
entirely. I don't know to what
beach Mr. Johnson goes to put
his head in the sand but there's
a lot of dangerous undertow
around there for us taxpayers.
With Mr. Johnson's popular
ity springing some leaks below
the water line, and intent on
reaching the haven of reelec
tion, he proposes still more
spending like a starved man at
the sound of a steak sizzling in
the pan. But what happens to
our country?
Conveniently not acknowledg
ing his Great Society's over
spending disease, he cannot
fathom the cure. Again refus
ing to apply priorities in the
spending, the State of the Un
ion message fails to measure
the real, the weighable, the mea
surable problems in our country
within our present powers to
solve them. The only solution
LBJ offers is that there is no
bottom to the barrel.
This epic of communication,
designed to move mountains, or
at least keep sycophants awake,
fails on both counts. It starts
off with sentences that are posi
tively Etruscan in their refusal
to be cracked. Then, reaching
deep in his bag of cliches for a

snapper, this old-style word
spinner ends it as he habitually
ends his speeches: Send me
more money.
In this Mr. Johnson has clear
ly fallen out of phase with the
folks back home, unless I am
deaf, dumb and blind every
where I go across the country.
The pollsters would have to be
wrong, too.
Dr. Gallup and most other
find that the rising cost of
living and of government
(taxes) are such a major con
cern of the American people
today that these rank even
ahead of the Vietnam war.
Further, millions ask—with
the war on poverty a local and
national shambles and the So
cial Security and welfare pro
grams loaded with abuse —how
long this prostitution of our
wealth can continue without
wrecking every decent concept
of our democratic system.
They feel that when a better
madhouse is built the Great
Society will build it, and that
Mr..Johnson's refrain of "Let's
all sing like the birdies sing"
is painfully, outrageously out
of date and out of place in a
country which feels that no
matter what we do, no matter
what sacrifices we make, we
are somehow being thrown
away. It is this widespread feel
ing of confusion, anxiety and
impatience— a nagging feeling
that the country's sacrifices
have got it nowhere—that the
State of the Union message
misses utterly.
Its next major contribution
is to the President's famous
"credibility gap." Millions ask

how we can spend billions to
guard against the gigantic, mer
ciless Sino-Soviet threat, fulfill
our unlimited commitment in
the Vietnamese war, support
the U.S. dollar's at-bay position
and still make good on the Pres
ident's expanded promises for
pie-in-the-sky.
Today's movement toward
nihilism, anarchy and alienation
—not alone among many young
people—and the cynicism that
accompanies it, never before
typical in our country, are in
large part due to the under
mined faith of our people.
The Kennedy and Johnson re
versals of their 1960 and 1964
promises were, and still are,
carried forth by deception, both
in domestic policy (both went
on and on to say, "I be
lieve in a balanced budget")
and in foreign policy (Cuba,
Laos, Berlin, Vietnam). The
people's lack of confidence in
the government's truth telling
is the inevtiable result.

President Johnson's $186 bil
lion budget proposal in his State
of the Union message couldn't
have been more inflationary if
he'd written it in dynamite,
and much of its justification for
the over-spending is the same
old political raccoon with just
another ring around it tail.
How much government over
spending and debt we can stand
is the great standing question.
The message brushes this off
entirely. I don't know to what
beach Mr. Johnson goes to put
his head in the sand but there's
a lot of dangerous undertow
around there for us taxpayers.
With Mr. Johnson's popular
ity springing some leaks below
the water line, and intent on
reaching the haven of reelec
tion, he proposes still more
spending like a starved man at
the sound of a steak sizzling in
the pan. But what happens to
our country?
Conveniently not acknowledg
ing his Great Society's over
spending disease, he cannot
fathom the cure. Again refus
ing to apply priorities in the
spending, the State of the Un
ion message fails to measure
the real, the weighable, the mea
surable problems in our country
within our present powers to
solve them. The only solution
LBJ offers is that there is no
bottom to the barrel.
This epic of communication,
designed to move mountains, or
at least keep sycophants awake,
fails on both counts. It starts
off with sentences that are posi
tively Etruscan in their refusal
to be cracked. Then, reaching
deep in his bag of cliches for a

snapper, this old-style word
spinner ends it as he habitually
ends his speeches: Send me
more money.
In this Mr. Johnson has clear
ly fallen out of phase with the
folks back home, unless I am
deaf, dumb and blind every
where I go across the country.
The pollsters would have to be
wrong, too.
Dr. Gallup and most other
find that the rising cost of
living and of government
(taxes) are such a major con
cern of the American people
today that these rank even
ahead of the Vietnam war.
Further, millions ask—with
the war on poverty a local and
national shambles and the So
cial Security and welfare pro
grams loaded with abuse —how
long this prostitution of our
wealth can continue without
wrecking every decent concept
of our democratic system.
They feel that when a better
madhouse is built the Great
Society will build it, and that
Mr..Johnson's refrain of "Let's
all sing like the birdies sing"
is painfully, outrageously out
of date and out of place in a
country which feels that no
matter what we do, no matter
what sacrifices we make, we
are somehow being thrown
away. It is this widespread feel
ing of confusion, anxiety and
impatience— a nagging feeling
that the country's sacrifices
have got it nowhere—that the
State of the Union message
misses utterly.
Its next major contribution
is to the President's famous
"credibility gap." Millions ask

how we can spend billions to
guard against the gigantic, mer
ciless Sino-Soviet threat, fulfill
our unlimited commitment in
the Vietnamese war, support
the U.S. dollar's at-bay position
and still make good on the Pres
ident's expanded promises for
pie-in-the-sky.
Today's movement toward
nihilism, anarchy and alienation
—not alone among many young
people—and the cynicism that
accompanies it, never before
typical in our country, are in
large part due to the under
mined faith of our people.
