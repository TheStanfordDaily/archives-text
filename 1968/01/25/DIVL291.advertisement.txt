NEED A NEW HEART?
With amazing skill and fantastic experience today's surgeons of the body re
place kidney's valves or hearts prolonging life and compassionately giving ad
ditional years of useful life back to dying men. Few feats of modern science and
research are so commendable and worthwhile in view of the preciousness of
every individual life.
Vet our western world which values physical life so highly usually ignores
the soul, and the inner man, that part which lives on forever. In utter inconsis
tency we give men comfort, life and temporal hope to prepare them for the
eternal fires of hell, the garbage dump of God's universe. There is even a sense
of shocked disbelief when someone dies and must leave this mortal scene to
give account of himself to Almighty God. But sooner or later each of us must
go. Jesus said, ' What shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world and
loses or forfeits his own soul; and what shall a man give in exchange for his
life?''
In the Bible the word heart is used over nine hundred times, but almost never
in the literal sense referring to the physical organ, but in a figurative way of
the inner most center of human consciousness, the seat of the affections and the
spirit of man. Jeremiah the prophet proclaims to the human race, "The heart of
man is deceitful above all things and desperately corrupt, who is able to un
derstand it. When the flood wiped out a heavily populated ancient world,
Moses records, "The LORD saw that the wilderness of man was great in the
earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually. And the LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and
it greived Him to His heart."
Speaking of the importance of looking to the internal motives as well as out
ward actions Jesus said, "What comes out of a man is what defiles a man. For
from within, out of the heart, of man come evil thoughts, fornication, theft, mur
der, adultry, coveting, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride,
foolishness.''
Even though God really knows what we are all like inside, and though we
can not hide from His searching gaze, He loves us. John's gospel records, "For
God so loved the world that He gave His only Son that whoever would believe
in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God sent His Son into the
world not to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be
saved."
It is an actual fact that God today, as always, gives men new inner Hearts,
changes their lives and grants them everlasting life in the present as a free gift.
This endless life is not some last minute transaction to be worked out on o death
bed, but the actual daily experience of us millions in the world who acknowl
edge the Lordship, and authority of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ has identified Him
self totally with suffering humanity and in actual fact has already died our
deaths for us. This is why a new heart from God is free for the asking. As the
Scripture puts it, "If any man is in Christ he is a new creation, old things have
pased away, behold all things have become new." You ought not to wait until
its too late, or gamble about the reality and nature of God when God's love is
free for the asking.
