# Russia Staying Out Of Korean Crisis
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
White House and other top ad
ministration sources passed the
ominous word Wednesday that
Russia so far has spurned U.S.
pleas to act as go-between with
North Korea in settling the
Pueblo dispute by diplomatic
means.
Officials told newsmen "all
appropriate diplomatic chan
nels" were being pursued but
they did not rule out the use of
force.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk
called the North Korean seizure
of the U.S. Navy intelligence
ship off North Korea Monday
night "an act of war."
Rusk advised the North Ko
reans to "cool it"and said they
would be "well advised to pull
back here."
The secretary said the United
States intends to get back the
ship which, with its 83 crewmen,
was apparently forced to a
North Korean port. Rusk de
clined to talk about the future
course of action this country
may take.
The nuclear - powered aircraft
carrier Enterprise and three es
corts were reported taking posi
tion in the Sea of Japan. South

Korean sources in Seoul said
the 75,000 ton carrier and its es
corts would take station 12 miles
off Wonsan Bay to await de
velopments. North Korea main
tains its territorial waters ex
tend 12 miles out from shore.
At the White House, the top
level National Security Council,
which ponders major strategic
moves, met in full dress session
on the problem.
George Christian, White
House press secretary, reported
after the meeting that "we have
not abandoned efforts to settle
the problem diplomatically."
These efforts "are still of para
mount interest," he said, but he
would not detail them.
One of the first U.S. moves,
after the seizure of the 935-ton
Pueblo became known, was to
ask the Soviet Union to act as a
diplomatic channel between the
United States and Communist
North Korea in hopes of resolv
ing the tense dispute without
shooting.
But White House sources said
such efforts "have not had satis
factory results."
There are still a number of
key gaps in the story, including
details on what kind of instruc
tions, if any, were sent out from
Washington to govern the skip

per's conduct and actions when
he was confronted by the North
Korean challenge.
The dour Soviet reaction to
the U.S. plea to act as go-be
tween was a blow to American
diplomats and government lead
ers hoping for a non-shooting
solution.
Sources said the United States
has no evidence that the Soviets
passed on the U.S. communica
tions to the North Korean gov
ernment.
McCloskey underscored the
apparent intrasigence of the
North Koreans when he said
that the Communist representa
tives at the Mixed Armistice
Commission meeting at Pan
munjom, South Korea, amount
ed to "cynical and denunci
atory" treatment of the United
States and "a distortion of the
facts in the case."

By distortions, State Depart
ment sources said, McCloskey
meant North Korean charges
that the Pueblo had been acting
provocatively and in a hostile
manner.
Officials were vague about the
chanels being pursued, other
than the unfruitful approach
through Russia.
North Korea broadcast
Wednesday "a confession" from
the captain of the USS Pueblo,
quoting him as saying he was
spying for the Central Intelli
gence Agency and was deep in
side North Korea's territorial
waters when his ship was cap
tured.
The statement concluded with
a reference to "parents and
wives and children" waiting
anxiously at home for the Pueb
lo crew's release. The fact that
the North Koreans included that

seemed to raise at least the pos>
sibility that the release was
being considered.
The English-language text of
an 800-word statement attrib
uted to Cmdr. Lloyd Mark
Bucher, commander of the in
telligence ship, said "my crime
committed by me and my men
is entirely indelible."
This terminology was not ex
panded. One definition of "indel
ible" denotes inability to wash
away or blot out something.
"I have no excuse whatsoever
for my criminal act as my ship
intruded deep into the territorial
waters of the Democratic Re
public of North Korea and was
captured by the naval patrol
craft of the Korean People's
Army in their self-defense ac
tion while conducting the crim
inal espionage activities," the
statement said.

"Having been captured now, I
say frankly that our act was a
criminal act which flagrantly
violated the armistice agree
ment and it was a sheer act of
aggression."
There was an entirely differ
ent version of the incident when
the United States called a meet
ing of the Military Armistice
Commission at Panmunjom and
demanded the release of the
Pueblo.
Rear Adm. John V. Simth, the
senior delegate, accused the
Communists of "criminal board
ing" and seizing the Pueblo in
international waters.
Maj. Gen. Park Choong-kook,
the senior North Korean dele
gate, answered with a tirade
contending the Pueblo was in
territorial waters on a spy mis
sion.

There was speculation that
the seizure of the Pueblo was
designed to divert U.S. forces
from the war in Vietnam. North
Korea long has been clamoring
for other Communist nations to
aid the Communist forces there.
President Chung Hee Park in
structed his aides to work close
ly with U.S. authorities for the
return of the Pueblo.
U.S. Ambassador William J.
Porter told Premier Chung ll
kwon that the U.S. government
had decided to take certain
measures.

The dour Soviet reaction to

North Korea broadcast
Wednesday "a confession" from
the captain of the USS Pueblo,
quoting him as saying he was
spying for the Central Intelli

side North Korea's territorial
waters when his ship was cap

The statement concluded with
a reference to "parents and
wives and children" waiting
anxiously at home for the Pueb

the North Koreans included that

seemed to raise at least the pos>
sibility that the release was
being considered.
The English-language text of
an 800-word statement attrib

Bucher, commander of the in

committed by me and my men
is entirely indelible."
This terminology was not ex

North Korea broadcast
Wednesday "a confession" from
the captain of the USS Pueblo,
quoting him as saying he was
spying for the Central Intelli
gence Agency and was deep in
side North Korea's territorial
waters when his ship was cap
tured.
The statement concluded with
a reference to "parents and
wives and children" waiting
anxiously at home for the Pueb
lo crew's release. The fact that
the North Koreans included that

seemed to raise at least the pos>
sibility that the release was
being considered.
The English-language text of
an 800-word statement attrib
uted to Cmdr. Lloyd Mark
Bucher, commander of the in
telligence ship, said "my crime
committed by me and my men
is entirely indelible."
This terminology was not ex
panded. One definition of "indel

away or blot out something.
"I have no excuse whatsoever
for my criminal act as my ship
intruded deep into the territorial
waters of the Democratic Re
public of North Korea and was
captured by the naval patrol
craft of the Korean People's
Army in their self-defense ac
tion while conducting the crim
inal espionage activities," the
statement said.

"Having been captured now, I
say frankly that our act was a
criminal act which flagrantly
violated the armistice agree
ment and it was a sheer act of
aggression."
There was an entirely differ
ent version of the incident when
the United States called a meet
ing of the Military Armistice
Commission at Panmunjom and
demanded the release of the
Pueblo.
Rear Adm. John V. Simth, the
senior delegate, accused the
Communists of "criminal board
ing" and seizing the Pueblo in
international waters.
Maj. Gen. Park Choong-kook,
the senior North Korean dele
gate, answered with a tirade
contending the Pueblo was in
territorial waters on a spy mis
sion.

There was speculation that
the seizure of the Pueblo was
designed to divert U.S. forces
from the war in Vietnam. North
Korea long has been clamoring
for other Communist nations to
aid the Communist forces there.
President Chung Hee Park in
structed his aides to work close
ly with U.S. authorities for the
return of the Pueblo.
U.S. Ambassador William J.
Porter told Premier Chung ll
kwon that the U.S. government
had decided to take certain
measures.
Korean sources said the
measures included dispatch of
the 75,000-ton nuclear-powered
carrier Enterprise and three de
stroyers to the Wonsan area.
They reported the Enterprise
will take up a station at the
edge of territorial waters 12
miles from Wonsan.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
White House and other top ad
ministration sources passed the
ominous word Wednesday that
Russia so far has spurned U.S.
pleas to act as go-between with
North Korea in settling the
Pueblo dispute by diplomatic
means.
Officials told newsmen "all
appropriate diplomatic chan
nels" were being pursued but
they did not rule out the use of
force.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk
called the North Korean seizure
of the U.S. Navy intelligence
ship off North Korea Monday
night "an act of war."
Rusk advised the North Ko
reans to "cool it"and said they
would be "well advised to pull
back here."
The secretary said the United
States intends to get back the
ship which, with its 83 crewmen,
was apparently forced to a
North Korean port. Rusk de
clined to talk about the future
course of action this country
may take.
The nuclear - powered aircraft
carrier Enterprise and three es
corts were reported taking posi
tion in the Sea of Japan. South

Korean sources in Seoul said
the 75,000 ton carrier and its es
corts would take station 12 miles
off Wonsan Bay to await de
velopments. North Korea main
tains its territorial waters ex
tend 12 miles out from shore.
At the White House, the top
level National Security Council,
which ponders major strategic
moves, met in full dress session
on the problem.
George Christian, White
House press secretary, reported
after the meeting that "we have
not abandoned efforts to settle
the problem diplomatically."
These efforts "are still of para
mount interest," he said, but he
would not detail them.
One of the first U.S. moves,
after the seizure of the 935-ton
Pueblo became known, was to
ask the Soviet Union to act as a
diplomatic channel between the
United States and Communist
North Korea in hopes of resolv
ing the tense dispute without
shooting.
But White House sources said
such efforts "have not had satis
factory results."
There are still a number of
key gaps in the story, including
details on what kind of instruc
tions, if any, were sent out from
Washington to govern the skip

per's conduct and actions when
he was confronted by the North
Korean challenge.
The dour Soviet reaction to
the U.S. plea to act as go-be
tween was a blow to American
diplomats and government lead
ers hoping for a non-shooting
solution.
Sources said the United States
has no evidence that the Soviets
passed on the U.S. communica
tions to the North Korean gov
ernment.
