# Ethics And Grading
## 
### 
The recurrent debate over grading, dean s
lists, and grade point averages is evidence of the
firmly entrenched ethic of productivity in our
society. We must learn to work hard, to maxim
ize our efficiency, to do our best no matter what
we are doing.
Only rarely are we to question why we do
something, or whether there is something more
than the ethic of productivity involved. If we
do ask why, we are all too often told that as soon
as we learn more about life, we will understand,
so for the prpsent, we should conform and not
upset the system.
Too many university professors, administra
tors, and parents feel that the one value to be
taught to the younger generation is the ethic of
productivity. Education becomes a process of
learning how to work, how to get along easily
in life, how to fit into the system and be judged
"best" by it. Parents worry constantly that their
children are not applying themselves, are not
getting the best grades, and hence are not get
ting the "most" out of college.
Business corporations require that their em
ployees do their best, produce as much as pos
sible in the course of a day. The company has
certain stated objectives and employees are
aware of these when they accept employment.
But universities and other educational institu
tions are not businesses with preconceived ob
jectives. The ethic of productivity can be applied
only where objectives are held in common,
where the behavior of a certain individual can

be weighed according to his fulfillment of those
objectives.
This is why grading systems as applied in the
universities are most often misleading. Rarely
does a professor look beyond the student's com
mand of a particular body of knowledge. It is
all too hard to find another criterion for judging
performance in a course. Some have suggested
the number of identity crises a student under
goes is a better criterion than examinations as
now given.
A good argument can be made for the elimin
ation of all evaluation at the undergraduate level.
The reasons given for grading are to motivate
the individual student and to allow graduate
schools to set their admissions standards. The
type of motivation students should be given does
not come through the grading system as it ex
ists, for students are encouraged to produce,
without much knowledge of why they produce,
except that society and the university might
judge one "best." In later life, this productivity
leads to material success.
Graduate schools, where vocational training
is more and more concentrated, can easily find
alternative and more efficient means of judging
an individuals competency in skills considered
important. Comprehensive examinations and
personal interviews can be more effectively used.
It is time education was defined more broadly
than seeking grade-point averages. It is time life
was defined more broadly than the pursuit of
productivity, and material success.

than seeking grade-point averages. It is time life
was defined more broadly than the pursuit of
productivity, and material success.
The recurrent debate over grading, dean s
lists, and grade point averages is evidence of the
firmly entrenched ethic of productivity in our
society. We must learn to work hard, to maxim
ize our efficiency, to do our best no matter what
we are doing.
Only rarely are we to question why we do
something, or whether there is something more
than the ethic of productivity involved. If we
do ask why, we are all too often told that as soon
as we learn more about life, we will understand,
so for the prpsent, we should conform and not
upset the system.
Too many university professors, administra
tors, and parents feel that the one value to be
taught to the younger generation is the ethic of
productivity. Education becomes a process of
learning how to work, how to get along easily
in life, how to fit into the system and be judged
"best" by it. Parents worry constantly that their
children are not applying themselves, are not
getting the best grades, and hence are not get
ting the "most" out of college.
Business corporations require that their em
ployees do their best, produce as much as pos
sible in the course of a day. The company has
certain stated objectives and employees are
aware of these when they accept employment.
But universities and other educational institu
tions are not businesses with preconceived ob
jectives. The ethic of productivity can be applied
only where objectives are held in common,
where the behavior of a certain individual can

be weighed according to his fulfillment of those
objectives.
This is why grading systems as applied in the
universities are most often misleading. Rarely
does a professor look beyond the student's com
mand of a particular body of knowledge. It is
all too hard to find another criterion for judging
performance in a course. Some have suggested
the number of identity crises a student under
goes is a better criterion than examinations as
now given.
A good argument can be made for the elimin
ation of all evaluation at the undergraduate level.
The reasons given for grading are to motivate
the individual student and to allow graduate
schools to set their admissions standards. The
type of motivation students should be given does
not come through the grading system as it ex
ists, for students are encouraged to produce,
without much knowledge of why they produce,
except that society and the university might
judge one "best." In later life, this productivity
leads to material success.
Graduate schools, where vocational training
is more and more concentrated, can easily find
alternative and more efficient means of judging
an individuals competency in skills considered
important. Comprehensive examinations and
personal interviews can be more effectively used.
