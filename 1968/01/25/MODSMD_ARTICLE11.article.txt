## 'Grad Student's Life Is Dull' 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
In response to your "Alive and
Hiding" editorial (Tuesday, Jan.
23) about graduate students (ob
viously written by an under
grade I could say that I, for
one, come from a school where
student government was student
government, not a political
sounding board; where the fra
ternity system (rated best in the
nation by the NIC) was a fra
ternity system, and not a glori
fied housing development; where
the newspaper was concerned
with the welfare of the student
community and not the welfare
of the world. I could also say
that, in comparison to my un
dergraduate college, Stanford
extra-curricular life (with the
exception of athletics) is one
big farce.
Your editorial, however, did
not point out deficiencies in the
extra-curricular program; it ze
roed in, rather, on the less-active
(?) half of the student body. For
what it's worth: 1) graduate stu
dents are excluded by NCAA
rules from participating in var
sity athletics; 2) most national
fraternities classify personnel
with a bachelor's degree as
alumni and no longer active
members of any chapter. Chalk
two of the largest activity-pro
ducers. This leaves the Daily
staff, student government, and
the grand sociaJ whirl ever-pres
ent on a typical Stanford week
end. I find the stacks more in
teresting.

• Maybe They're
Disgusted With Trivia
Editor, The Daily:
You bet student organizations
are a game. And unless a twen
ty-one year old is so stunted so
as not to have passed the Friday
afternoon mixer stage, he recog
nizes that four years of trivia
are about enough.
There are graduate students
who are involved, you know;
for instance, the astute editors
of occasional journals who blub
ber at Messrs. Sterling and Ar
buckle about their "complicity"
in the Vietnam war in a langu
age that is, understandably
enough, comprehended by the
squawkers only. Not to mention
the übiquitious hawkers of those
same publications, who have
been "involved" for quite a few
years already, and will probably
be "involved" for several more
to come.
Let's not forget that the mon
ey-grubbing graduate students
described in your editorial were
once undergraduates, and they
may, quite simply, have had
their fill of Jabberwocky LASSU
sessions, Grovy "dialogues," and
student no - news newspapers
crammed full of . . . endless rep
etition, and editorials whose in

credible simplicity is surpassed
only by the boredom they evoke.

• Quad Hasn't Taken
Any Political Stances
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to clarify a few
things with respect to the 1968
Quad. It is the desire of the staff
to examine all student interests
in an effort to reflect the con
cerns and commitments of the
entire student body, not, as you
suggest, merely those of the left.
In this vein I might add that
nowhere in the book are there
six pages covering the Oakland
demonstration or any other dem
onstration as such. Further
more, the Quad has not adopted
any particular political stance;
the activities of any staff mem
ber are personal commitments
and have little relevance to the
Quad.
We appreciate the correction
in the January 23 Daily regard
ing the number of color pages.
However, there was so little
truth in the entire article that
your attempt at correction bare
ly made a dent! I would recom
mend that The Daily check its
facts before attempting further
"analytic" articles and spare the
campus further ridiculously ir
responsible journalism.

• Leper Mission
In East Nigeria
Editor, The Daily:
Situated in East Nigeria, the
most peaceful and happy coun
try in Africa, if not in the whole
world, is the Ogoja diocese, with
an area of 7,700 square miles
and a population of 1,250,000 peo
ple. The diocese is entrusted to
the missionary care of the St.
Patrick Fathers.
With only 15 doctors in the
whole diocese, that is one doctor
for every 100,000 people, these
doctors are tragically overwork
ed. The doctors are not surgeons,
gynecologists or specialists —
there is no dentist. They have no
running water, no electricty and
no X-Ray. The people are racked
with diseases of all kind, lep
rosy, malaria, typhus, etc.
One third of the children nev
er see their third birthday. Lep
rosy is prevalent here in Ogoja.
Lepers who survived after 10 to
15 years were simply human
wrecks; skin and bone, emaciat
ed, homeless and without hope.
There are now 5,000 lepers here.
It takes $180.00 per day to feed
all of them. We spend $45,000.00
per year on Lepers. For the
clean, we also run 6 hospitals.
God bless all our generous
friends overseas. Beds, blankets,
medicine, clothing, canned food
and funds are desperately need
ed. No matter the size of the
donation, it is sincerely appro

ciated. If you have goods you
wish to contribute call Father
O'Byrne at 253-9836. (Send mone
tary contributions to: LEPERS

• Red Tile JSo Good
Even As Tradition
Editor, The Daily:
If Hank Liese, who thinks to
end the controversy over the
danger of Stanford's tile roofs,
will climb the stairs on the
South side of Memorial Quad,
he will find among the dozen or
so tiles within easy reach two
whose copper wires have come
undone. Considering the brittle
ness of the tile and the flimsi
ness of the attachments, the use
of tile where experts agree that
a major earthquake will come
in time is irresponsible.
I don't believe any architect
or engineer will publicly agree
with "the recent academic sur
vey (which) has shown red tiles
unsurpassed in reducing hidden
dangers of roofs." A copper
roof, with no need for tar be
neath it, to name one of many
examples, far surpasses tile in
safety.
The use of tiles is also a ques
tion of taste and of one's con
ception of tradition. Tile roofs
are very beautiful where appro
priate. But the tile fringe around
the undergraduate library is a
heavy, costly, dangerous super
structure added to the basic
structure for appearance only,
and its appearance is top heavy.
The building has many excell
ent features, but I challenge Mr.
Liese to find one outside pro
fessional architect or architec
tural critic who regards it as
anything but a shoddy compro
mise with what some people
think of as "tradition."
