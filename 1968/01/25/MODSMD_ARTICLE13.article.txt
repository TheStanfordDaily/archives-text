# The 						Capitol Scenes
## The 						Convention Super Bowl Will Bobby Enter The Game? 
### Art Buchwald 
"Well, ladies and gentlemen,
this has been quite a football
game. The heavily favored John
son Regulars are leading the
Democratic Dissenters 56 to 12,
and although we're still in the
first quarter, there doesn't seem
to be much chance of the Dis
senters overcoming the Johnson
Regulars' lead.
"As you know, the winner of
this ball game gets to play in
the Presidential Super Bowl in
November, 1968, and all eyes are
focused on what is happening
here today.
"Leading the attack for the
Dissenters in second-string quar
terback Gene McCarthy of Min
nesota. The first-string quarter
back, Bobby Kennedy, a transfer
student from Massachusetts to
New York, is suited up but is
sitting on the bench.
"A doubtful starter because he
was afraid of being permanently
injured, Bobby has been work
ing out with the team in prac
tice, but no one knows if he'll
get into the game.
Fanning: Dissent
"That cheering you hear in
the background came from the
Dissenter fans' section of the
stadium. In case you can't un
derstand what they're chanting,

it's We want Bobby,' 'We want
Bobby.' Bobby has a blanket
around his head as if to drown
out the chant.
"During the first quarter,
every time Gene McCarthy was
thrown for a loss, he got up
and looked over at the bench as
if to inquire if Bobby were go
ing to come into the game. But
so far there has been no indica
tion that Bobby is going to play.
"Coach Lyn Johnson of the
Regulars doesn't seem to be too
bothered by the McCarthy of
fense. As a matter of fact, dur
ing the game he substituted the
regular defense captain, Bob
McNamara, and put in Clark
Clifford to replace him.
No Fumbles?
"While Clifford has never
played defense before, he got a
rousing cheer when he came
into the contest.
"There haven't been too many
fumbles in the game. The Dis
senters just can't seem to get
the ball rolling. Their strategy
has been listless, and they just
can't seem to catch the imagi
nation of the crowd.
"Wait a minute, folks. Wait a
minute. Bobby Kennedy has just
taken off his blanket and he's
starting to warm up with a foot

ball with his brother, Teddy.
The crowd has gone crazy. Bob
by is throwing the ball back
and forth now, and more fans
are watching him than are
watching the ball game.
Guess Not
"McCarthy is looking over at
the bench again, wondering if
he will be substituted. Now Ken
nedy is talking with the coach
es. He seems to be in an argu
ment. He's nodding his head.
Now he's sitting down on the
bench again and is putting a
blanket around himself. The
fans are booing, but Bobby
doesn't seem to be paying any
attention.
"The Johnson Regulars are
making long yardage, and there
doesn't seem to be anything
that's going to stop them.
They've been running through
Bill Fulbright, Mike Mansfield,
Ernie Gruening and Joe Clark
and have been passing over the
heads of George McGovern,
Frank Church and Wayne
Morse.
"Wait a minute. Bobby's get
ting up off the bench again. He's
thrown off his blanket and he's
running up and down. Now he's
doing knee bends. The fans are
going wild. It looks as if this
time he may go In.
"Oh, oh. He's talking to the
coaches again. Now he's on the
phone to the scouts up in the
boxes. He's examining the field.
He's studying the Johnson Reg
ulars' bench. He's on the phone
again. Now he's talking to the
cheer leaders. He picks up a
football and is juggling it in his
hand as he walks by himself
along the sidelines.
"Now he's back at the bench.
He shrugs his shoulders, sits
down and puts the blanket
around himself again and stares
out toward the goal line. From
where he sits it seems awfully
far away."
