# New Dormitory Plans Age Under Watchful SES Eye
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Plans for two luxurious, coed
dorms, Moore and Jacks Halls,
are now aging under the watch
ful eye of the SES Residence
Committee.
Definite $7,540,000 plans for
the new housing originated as
early as 1965. Architects' draw
ings had been completed and the
building sites chosen at that
time.
But early in 1967 the plans ran
into trouble. Edward Scoles re
ported to the Residence Com
mittee in an Oct. 25 meeting
(quoted from the minutes):
"... Both projects were shelv
ed for a number of reasons:
"The government announced a
freeze on loan money included in
the plans;" ($2,360,000 was anti
cipated. )
"Ferment on the campus con
cerning housing and the new
Study of Education brought to
a head concern about the appro
priateness of the project to cur
rent housing needs ..."
The need to "consider Moore-
Jacks in relation to the overall
purposes of a residence univer
sity" was noted at that time by
Joel Smith, dean of students.
Wait For Evaluation
Robert Hind, associate dean
of undergraduate education,
later predicted planning would
"go slow until evidence on resi
dence patterns has been evalu
ated by the Residence Committee
of SES.
"The notion of coed housing
was a bold one at the time Moore
and Jacks were planned," he add
ed. "Now our experience with
Grove and the demonstration
houses may well change our
views. We may have to make
minor or major changes in the
plans."
Hind termed those plans

"beautiful." Each dorm would
have consisted of four units, two
for men and two for women,
housing seventy residents in
each. They were arranged with
balconies opening onto a court
yard, and coed lounges and din
ing halls.
Jacks would house five faculty
residents in addition, "quite an
expensive undertaking," noted
Hind, and provide associates, tu
tors, and courses offered in the
residence.
Moore was to have only one
housemaster, but could be con
verted for more faculty residents
if the Jacks trial proved success
ful.
Common dining facilities for
men and women were to be pro
vided in each dorm.
The new dorms would house
those displaced by the predicted
loss of the lower row houses
within the next five to ten years,
explained Sally Mahoney, assis
tant dean of students.
Changing Ideas
During the Residence Commit
tee meeting, Donald Kennedy, a
member of the original plan
ning committee, noted that ideas
of students and faculty had

changed since the first plan
ning.
He remarked about a change
from thinking the Harvard or
Yale college system with house
masters would be best, to recog
nition that integrated living
groups like the present demon
stration with faculty associates
were more feasible at Stanford.
The Scoles report went on to
indicate dissatisfactions with the
plans, hinting at two possible
lines of change saying;
Apartments?
"... The success of Hoskins
has indicated that it might be
better to build more apartments
for undergraduates;" and"it
was recognized that the educa
tional input [for the dorms] was
not nearly ideal."
Lewis Spitz, Committee chair
man, predicts that more definite
plans for Moore and Jacks can't
be made until "sometime in the
spring."
"The money has been preserv
ed for new residences," he said,
"but so much depends on the
overall findings of the Residence
Policy Committee. We want to
use the funds in the wisest pos
sible way."
