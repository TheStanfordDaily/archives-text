A two-day hasher "strike" in
the El Capitan eating club
ended yesterday. Members ol
the club agreed to treat the
hashers with more respect.
The eight hashers walked off
the job Monday to protest an
attitude of club members which
characterized them as a "sep

erate, servile group" whenever
they put on their hashing jack
ets.
Club president Don Piatt ex
plained that club members
agreed to try hashing for them
selves at all meals. The regular
hashers described the work as
a "disgusting job."
After one day, the members
met with the hashers in a club
meeting and talked over the
problems involved, apparently to
the satisfaction of the hashers.
The eight hashers, who are
mmebers of the club, also com
plained about the size of a rec
ent pay increase. They received
only a $3.25 increase after re
questing $15 more per quarter.
Piatt said the salary matter
would come up for house con
sideration in several weeks.
Hashers termed the small in
crease an "insult."
