# Historians To Offer Diplomacy Course
## 
### 
Student participation in prob
lem-solving and teaching will
mark a new course in diplomacy
to be introduced by the History
Department in the Spring Quar
ter.
Called the "Diplomatic His
tory of Our Time," the course
will deal with international cri
ses ranging from the Berlin Con
gress of 1878 to the post World
War II Arab-Israeli conflict. Six
man student teams will present
analyses of each of these situa
tions.
"This is something new. It
may fall right flat on its face,"
said Professor Gordon A. Craig,
adding that the reaction of stu
dents to the idea will largely
determine its success. Professor
Craig will teach the course with
Professors Ivo Lederer and
Mark Mancall.
The course is designed to at
tract students from outside the
History Department. It will be
graded on a pass-fail basis. For
the Spring Quarter trial run,
40 juniors and seniors and 20

graduate students will be select
ed.
Professor Craig emphasized
the relevance of the course to
modern international problems.
A diplomatic problem encount
ered in the Balkans before the
First World War may provide
the prototype of a negotiation
situation involving large and
small powers, ideological differ
ences, and other modern com
plications, he said.
The thesis behind the course
is that the traditional system
of Western diplomacy has been
destroyed by two world wars.
In its place we have a large,
heterogeneous diplomatic com
munity which must deal with
tensions between different cul
tures, each of which may have
its own style of diplomacy.
The uses and limitations of in
ternational organizations will be
discussed.
The final examination will con
sist of a situation paper written
to guide the U.S. in negotiating
a specific problem.
