# Massarenti: Warnings Here
## Cal Student Government Sinks 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Cal's student government is
slowly sinking out of sight. And
ASSU President Cesare Massa
renti wants to make sure noth
ing similar happens here.
In the latest move in an ever
growing, ever more complicated
controversy, the Cal Judiciary
Committee ruled Monday that
two suspended students, Peter
Camejo and Reese Erhlich, are
not eligible to serve in the Asso
ciated Students of the Univer
sity of California (ASUC) stu
dent senate.
The ASUC, after having its
funds cut off by Chancellor
Roger Heyns in December, de
clared itself "Independent" of
the university administration
earlier tills month.
Its present situation is un
clear, and the future is uncer
tain. The problems there have
aroused some interest here, es
pecially from Massarenti.
"The ASUC put themselves
In a position of allowing the ad
ministration to take the initia
tive," Massarenti said. "We are
trying to avoid this here."
He feels the ASUC has, to a
great extent, dug its own hole.
"They have not worked out a
clear understanding of what
they exist for," Massarenti said,
"leaving the initiative up to the
administration."

As for the ASUC declaration
of independence, the ASSU pres
ident feel that the move was "too
late. They are declaring them
selves independent because there
Ls nothing else they can do."
The seating of the suspend
ed students was one of many
actions which brought about
Heyns' move against the
ASUC. Four other newly-elect
ed senators were on disciplin
ary probation, all because of
anti-draft demonstrations.
The Judicial Committee ruled
that the four could be seated.
But two of them have already
resigned, after administration
pressure.
They had been threatened
with suspension if they did not
give up their seats, since serv
ing on the senate violated the
terms of their probation.
Nothing along these lines will
cause trouble with the ASSU,
but Massarenti is questioning
the organization's entire pur
pose and function.
"The ASSU is doing nothing
for the students," Massarenti re
marked at last Thursday's Legi
slature meeting. "I really won
der if it would be advisable to
destroy it."
At present, his ten-member
executive committee is consider
ing possible plans for ASSU's
future.
Suggestions being oonslder-

Ed Include abolishing the or
ganization altogether, moving
It off campus, and completely
restructuring the ASSU. A
full Investigation of each item
and the consequences on im
plementing them is being
made.

Massarenti said his group
would not make a decision
on these possibilities. After
thorough research, a report on
each will be submitted to
LASSU, he said, for discussion
and for a general student refer
endum.

Cal's student government is
slowly sinking out of sight. And
ASSU President Cesare Massa
renti wants to make sure noth
ing similar happens here.
In the latest move in an ever
growing, ever more complicated
controversy, the Cal Judiciary
Committee ruled Monday that
two suspended students, Peter
Camejo and Reese Erhlich, are
not eligible to serve in the Asso
ciated Students of the Univer
sity of California (ASUC) stu
dent senate.
The ASUC, after having its
funds cut off by Chancellor
Roger Heyns in December, de
clared itself "Independent" of
the university administration
earlier tills month.
Its present situation is un
clear, and the future is uncer
tain. The problems there have
aroused some interest here, es
pecially from Massarenti.
"The ASUC put themselves
In a position of allowing the ad
ministration to take the initia
tive," Massarenti said. "We are
trying to avoid this here."
He feels the ASUC has, to a
great extent, dug its own hole.
"They have not worked out a
clear understanding of what
they exist for," Massarenti said,
"leaving the initiative up to the
administration."

As for the ASUC declaration
of independence, the ASSU pres
ident feel that the move was "too
late. They are declaring them
selves independent because there
Ls nothing else they can do."
The seating of the suspend
ed students was one of many
actions which brought about
Heyns' move against the
ASUC. Four other newly-elect
ed senators were on disciplin
ary probation, all because of
anti-draft demonstrations.
The Judicial Committee ruled
that the four could be seated.
But two of them have already
resigned, after administration
pressure.
They had been threatened
with suspension if they did not
give up their seats, since serv
ing on the senate violated the
terms of their probation.
Nothing along these lines will
cause trouble with the ASSU,
but Massarenti is questioning
the organization's entire pur
pose and function.
"The ASSU is doing nothing
for the students," Massarenti re
marked at last Thursday's Legi
slature meeting. "I really won
der if it would be advisable to
destroy it."
At present, his ten-member
executive committee is consider
ing possible plans for ASSU's
future.
Suggestions being oonslder-

Ed Include abolishing the or
ganization altogether, moving
It off campus, and completely
restructuring the ASSU. A
full Investigation of each item
and the consequences on im
plementing them is being
made.

Massarenti said his group
would not make a decision
on these possibilities. After
thorough research, a report on
each will be submitted to
LASSU, he said, for discussion
and for a general student refer
endum.
