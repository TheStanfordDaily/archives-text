# G.I.'s Told To Stop Transporting Pot

"Marijuana is somewhat prev
alent in this command," an
Army colonel in Vietnam ad
mitted, according to the New
York Times Tuesday. "I don't
think I'm saying anything new,"
the officer added.
He is Lieut. Col. J. T. Min
yard, responsible for "outpro
cessing" soldiers leaving Viet
nam for a "Rest and Recrea
tion" (R & R) leave in the Pa
cific area.
The Times reported the Army
is warning soldiers not to car
ry marijuana from Vietnam to
Australia.
Last week, the Army Report
er, the official Army publication
in Vietnam, printed an article
with the headline, "Further
Marijuana Smuggling Into Aus
tralia Could Eliminate Area as
Future Rand R Site." The ar
ticle said: "The legal officer here
says that if violations of local
laws continue to occur there
may be curtailment of travel to
these areas."
Rest Tours
Army officers said that since
Oct. 1, when the rest tours to
Sydney, Australia began, Aus
tralian customs officials had
found 10 service men carrying
marijuana into the country.
A total of 20,000 soldiers leave
Vietnam each month on the
five- to six- day rest tours. The
most popular spot, Hawaii, re
ceives 4,400 soldiers a month.
Australia, the second favorite,
now has a monthly Army quota
of 3,300. The other popular cities
include Bangkok, Tokyo and
Taipei.
Marijuana is easy to get in
Vietnam, according to the Army.
"By and large, what's happen
ing here is a reflection of what's
happening in the States," an
officer said. 'This pot—you can
smell it almost anywhere you
go on the streets here—is not
against the law in Vietnam and
it's readily available."
"The G.l.'s have read about it
and a certain number of them
have apparently smoked it even
before they got here."
Punishment
The maximum sentence for
the possession or use of mari
juana is a dishonorable dis
charge, confinement at hard
labor for five years, forfeiture
of all pay and allowances and,
in the case of enlisted men, re
duction to the lowest grade.
Last year, there were 731
cases involving the possession
or use of marijuana by Army
personnel in Vietnam. Many of
these cases—especially those in
volving first-time offenses—
were resolved by company pun
ishment of restriction to bar
racks, extra duty and forfeit
ure of a week's pay.
Army officials here empha
sized that the number of mari

juana offenses brought before
a court-martial is relatively
small in comparison with other
offenses. In December, for ex
ample, there were 39 courts
martial for narcotics violations,
usually marijuana offenses. In
the same period there were 106
courts-martial for "sentinel of
fenses" involving sleeping on
guard or leaving a post illeg
ally.
