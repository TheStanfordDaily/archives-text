# Doctor Outlines Future Of Medicine: 'Awesome'

### JOHN ALCORN 
"Sperm banks," "one-shot and
retro act ive contraceptives,"
frozen bodies and organs, and
transplanted and artificial or
gans of every type will be com
monplace in the twenty-first cen
tury according to Stanford psy
chiatrist E. Fuller Torrey.
Torrey told a Century 21 aud
ience last night that "the era
of unlimited transplants will
soon be upon us" and that vir
tually the only medical question
which will not be solved in the
next 150 years will be how to
create a totally artificial man.
Concerning contraceptives,
Torrey said that in the near
future two types will be com
mon: the "injectables"—chemi
cals injected into the body, and
the "implantables"—physical de
vices, which are already com
mon, placed inside the body.
"Do people have the right to
have children at all?" is a vital
question which Torrey thinks
should be closely examined in
the future. He noted that it will
soon be possible for a govern
ment to make everyone sterile,
although "this seems a bit fanci
ful in America."
It will be possible for adults
in the future to become par
ents merely by going to their
local "sperm bank" and select
ing the sperm of a great man
whom the couple especially

admires to be injected into
the wife's ovary.
Ovary transplants will be pos
sible "in the next decade" creat
ing for the first time in history
"pre-natal adoptions" and "mer
cenary wet-nurses" who could
give birth, for a price, to a
child of a mother who simply
might not want to go to the
trouble herself.
There are over one million
illegal abortions every year in
the United States, but Torrey
predicted that in the near future
"do it yourself abortions," by
means of pills, "will make it
pointless to outlaw abortion."
He said that a Supreme Court
ruling is only a matter of time.
Euthanasia, or the problem of
"mercy killing," will also dis
appear in the future primarily
because drugs and surgery will
alleviate the necessity of having
to kill someone in order for
them to escape pain.
Synthetic immortality has
already been achieved, Torry
said. A few people in the Un
ited States who have "died"
from incurable diseases are
presently frozen and awaiting
the day when a cure is found
and their bodies will be
thawed. One group which is
totally committed to sus
pended animation sponsors a
publication titled "Freeze-
Wait-Reanimate."

ss
It will be so easy to change
skin color in the future that he
asked, "How are people going
to be bigots," when anybody
can be any color he chooses?
According to Torrey, the ethi
cal questions related to the com
ing advances in medicine lead to
the basic problems of "what is
life and what is death?"
The medical profession, he
emphasized, has two main re
sponsibilities: to publicize in
formation concerning medical
break-throughs, and to take a
position of leadership in dis
cussing how these discoveries
will relate to society.
