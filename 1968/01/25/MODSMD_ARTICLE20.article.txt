# ASSU To Produce Student-Buyer Aid
## 
### 
A group of Stanford students,
bothered by what they consider
unfair business practices against
students, has decided to do some
thing about it.
Organized with financial help
from the ASSU legislature, the
Student Consumer Protection
Study Committee intends to
probe landlords who discriminate
against students and businesses
which take advantage of stu
dents.
"We're going to try to conduct
this thing fairly respectably,"
said law student Nick Feakins,
acting co-head of the group. "I'm
hoping this can be a continuing
thing," he added.
Feakins cited car dealers and
repair shops as examples of
businesses often dealing unfair
ly with students. He also men
tioned gasoline prices as being
disproportionately high in the
Palo Alto area.
The study committee. now iust
organizing itself, already has
eight people pledged to work on
the project, including three law
students, two freshmen, a fresh
man sponsor and two off-campus
men.
The group plans a campus
wide survey in about three weeks
to find specific cases of unfair
practices.
Feakins said the committee
will also welcome advice and
suggestions from "anybody who
is interested in helping out."
He said he plans to put to
gether a booklet of "remedies,"
containing advice on what a stu

dent should do if he thinks he
has been cheated.
For example, it would explain
procedures of small claims court
and descriptions of the Better
Business Bureau's facilities, the
Chamber of Commerce and chan
nels of complaint within the
University.
The committee also expects to
issue reports on what to look
for in an apartment lease, a list
of landlords who discriminate
against students, and other in
formation and advice.
Feakins said the committee
did not expect to find a "conspi
racy" among businessmen to
cheat students, but added, "There
are some abuses, and I think
they ought to be looked into."
Students now working on the
committee include law students
Feakins, Robert Arthur and Rob
ert Arhelger; freshmen Clydia
Cuykendall and Paul Loewen
stein; Branner sponsor Stephen
McMillan; and graduate students
Robert Taylor and Edward John
Ray.
Feakins urged anyone inter
ested in working on the study
to contact one of these students.
