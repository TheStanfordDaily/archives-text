# Athletes Demand Coaching Changes
## Cal Negroes Threaten Boycott 
### 
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) —
Negro athletes at the University
of California demanded the re
placement of three major sports
coaches and improved canditions
for themselves Tuesday, under
threat of boycotting sports.

About 25 of the 40 leading Ne
gro athletes on the Berkeley
campus called a news confer
ence and presented eight com
plaints and their boycott threat.
Bobby Smith, defensive half
back who was on the All-Pacific
8 Conference team and chosen
for the Shrine East-West and
Hula Bowl games, was spokes
man for the group.
Demand Firings
Their protest was labeled "Res
olution of Black Athletes of the
University of California." Those
they said "must be replaced for
reasons of their inability or un
willingness to relate to black
athletes and their general incom
petence" are Rene Herrerias,
head basketball coach; William
Dutton, defensive football line
coach, and Joe Marvin, offensive
backfield coach.
The Negro athletes said, "The
university should make a sin
cere effort to hire coaches of
minority backgrounds." They
did not propose any candidates.
Athletic Director Pete Newell
and Herrerias declined comment.
Their action was a quick fol
lowup to a resolution of 12 white
California basketball players,
who declared Monday night
they would not play again until
administrative pressures were
removed from Herrerias.
Presley Suspension
The coach suspended high
scoring Bob Presley, 6-10V& cen
ter, Thursday night and rein
stated him this week. The white
athletes said he was ordered by
the administration to reinstate
Presley. Herrerias denied that.
Presley sat out the Bears' vic
tory over Portland Saturday
night. That made California's
record 84 for the season, but
only 2-4 in its last six games.
California announced Presley
was suspended for disciplinary

reasons, but Herrerias said
Tuesday the action was taken
for purely personal reasons.
Asked if it would be correct to
say a personality clash split the
basketball team, the coach re
plied, "I can't say that," but re
peated the reason was personal.
"Is the trouble deep and seri
ous?" he was asked.
"Only time will tell," Herrer
ias replied.
Race Issue?
He declined to hint at reasons
for the personal differences. He
declared racism was not involv
ed in either his clash with Pres
ley or between the 12 white and
five Negros basketball players.
An athletic department spokes
man said the Negro athletes'
protest and basketball revolt
were not related. Basketball play
ers were among the Negro ath
letes at the Tuesday news con
ference.
The Negro athletes' resolution
said they were "sick and tired

of giving of our talents without
appreciation and due recogni
tion from the athletic depart
ment and mass media."
Eight Grievances
It listed these eight griev
ances :
1. Replace Herrerias, Dutton
and Marvin.
2. Remove Pat Farran, busi
ness manager, because "black
athletes receive worse scholar
ship and summer jobs in terms
of working conditions and pay."
3. "On numerous occasions
our personal and physical ap
pearance have been the object
of derogatory comments and
ridicule by members of the ath
letic department."
Deny Gold-Bricking
4. "Frequently, black athletes
have been forced to play when
injured. Trainers have written
off our injuries as hypochondria
or gold bricking."
5. Eliminating black quotas"
among athletic scholarships.

6. "Hire coaches of minority
background."
7. "Black athletes have been
left to fend for themselves in
finding housing without appro
priate support from the athletic
department."
8. "The assumption is made
that black athletes are lacking
in intelligence, the result being
that we receive inferior aca
demic advice and counseling."
Bleak Future
The resolution concluded with
a resolve to discourage Negro
athletes from attending Califor
nia and to boycott future ath
letic events.
"This resolution has the full
support of black student groups
on the campus, black community
organizations, and black commu
nity leaders," it concluded.
California has five Negro bas
ketball players, 12 Negroes on
the varsity football squad, and
others are on swimming, wres
tling and baseball teams.

Athletic Director Pete Newell
and Herrerias declined comment.
Their action was a quick fol
lowup to a resolution of 12 white
California basketball players,
who declared Monday night
they would not play again until
administrative pressures were
removed from Herrerias.
Presley Suspension
The coach suspended high
scoring Bob Presley, 6-10V& cen
ter, Thursday night and rein
stated him this week. The white
athletes said he was ordered by
the administration to reinstate
Presley. Herrerias denied that.
Presley sat out the Bears' vic
tory over Portland Saturday
night. That made California's
record 84 for the season, but
only 2-4 in its last six games.
California announced Presley
was suspended for disciplinary

reasons, but Herrerias said
Tuesday the action was taken
for purely personal reasons.
Asked if it would be correct to
say a personality clash split the
basketball team, the coach re
plied, "I can't say that," but re
peated the reason was personal.
"Is the trouble deep and seri
ous?" he was asked.
"Only time will tell," Herrer
ias replied.
Race Issue?
He declined to hint at reasons
for the personal differences. He
declared racism was not involv
ed in either his clash with Pres
ley or between the 12 white and
five Negros basketball players.
An athletic department spokes
man said the Negro athletes'
protest and basketball revolt
were not related. Basketball play
ers were among the Negro ath
letes at the Tuesday news con
ference.
The Negro athletes' resolution
said they were "sick and tired

of giving of our talents without
appreciation and due recogni
tion from the athletic depart
ment and mass media."
Eight Grievances
It listed these eight griev
ances :
1. Replace Herrerias, Dutton
and Marvin.
2. Remove Pat Farran, busi
ness manager, because "black
athletes receive worse scholar
ship and summer jobs in terms
of working conditions and pay."
3. "On numerous occasions
our personal and physical ap
pearance have been the object
of derogatory comments and
ridicule by members of the ath
letic department."
Deny Gold-Bricking
4. "Frequently, black athletes
have been forced to play when
injured. Trainers have written
off our injuries as hypochondria
or gold bricking."
5. Eliminating black quotas"
among athletic scholarships.

6. "Hire coaches of minority
background."
7. "Black athletes have been
left to fend for themselves in
finding housing without appro
priate support from the athletic
department."
8. "The assumption is made
that black athletes are lacking
in intelligence, the result being
that we receive inferior aca
demic advice and counseling."
Bleak Future
The resolution concluded with
a resolve to discourage Negro
athletes from attending Califor
nia and to boycott future ath
letic events.
"This resolution has the full
support of black student groups
on the campus, black community
organizations, and black commu
nity leaders," it concluded.
California has five Negro bas
ketball players, 12 Negroes on
the varsity football squad, and
others are on swimming, wres
tling and baseball teams.
BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) —
Negro athletes at the University

ias replied.
Race Issue?
He declined to hint at reasons
for the personal differences. He
declared racism was not involv
ed in either his clash with Pres
ley or between the 12 white and
five Negros basketball players.
An athletic department spokes
man said the Negro athletes'
protest and basketball revolt
were not related. Basketball play
ers were among the Negro ath
letes at the Tuesday news con
ference.
The Negro athletes' resolution
said they were "sick and tired

of giving of our talents without
appreciation and due recogni
tion from the athletic depart
ment and mass media."
Eight Grievances
It listed these eight griev
ances :
1. Replace Herrerias, Dutton
and Marvin.
2. Remove Pat Farran, busi
ness manager, because "black
athletes receive worse scholar
ship and summer jobs in terms
of working conditions and pay."
3. "On numerous occasions
our personal and physical ap
pearance have been the object
of derogatory comments and
ridicule by members of the ath
letic department."
Deny Gold-Bricking
4. "Frequently, black athletes
have been forced to play when
injured. Trainers have written
off our injuries as hypochondria
or gold bricking."
5. Eliminating black quotas"
among athletic scholarships.

6. "Hire coaches of minority
background."
7. "Black athletes have been
left to fend for themselves in
finding housing without appro
priate support from the athletic
department."
8. "The assumption is made
that black athletes are lacking
in intelligence, the result being
that we receive inferior aca
demic advice and counseling."
Bleak Future
The resolution concluded with
a resolve to discourage Negro
athletes from attending Califor
nia and to boycott future ath
letic events.
"This resolution has the full
support of black student groups
on the campus, black community
organizations, and black commu
nity leaders," it concluded.
California has five Negro bas
ketball players, 12 Negroes on
the varsity football squad, and
others are on swimming, wres
tling and baseball teams.
