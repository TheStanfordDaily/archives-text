An overnight fairy tale trans
formed Grantham's Eagles —
the local basketball team —
from a club with a bleak future
to one possessing enormous po
tential, and they are now riding
the crest of a successful wave.
During the 1966-67 season, the
future looked far from rosy.
Then along came Stanford Uni
versity of Palo Alto, California,
who took over Harlaxtorv Manor
as an overseas campus. Not un
naturally, some of the under
graduates wanted to play bas
ketball.
The Eagles club was the near
est and the attraction of local
league and national champion
ship basketball was to the liking
of these students.
The local league has not real
ly recovered from the impact
made by the Americans on the
scene and the strength attracted
better opposition. In fact, in a
recent game, against the R.A.F.
All-Stars, the Eagles went down
by one point in an overtime
thriller.
In the southern section of the
county league this season the
Eagles are undefeated after five
games, and are firm favourites
to win the title.
Undoubtably the influx of
Americans to Stanford has help
ed the club tremendously, and
it can only be hoped that the
new students coming next year
will be able to keep the Eagles
on top.
Certainly from reports already
reaching Eagles' officials, it looks
very much as if the team will
be as strong, if not stronger,
i Eagles' coach, Roy Taylor,
told the "Journal" that from in
foration he had received on the
new students coming to Harlax
ton from America, the team
could even be stronger.
The Americans who have now
returned home played no small
part in making the Eagles a

force to be reckoned with. Hal
Cranston, 6ft. sin. in seven
games scored 160 points and to
gether with colleagues Tony
Christensen, Mark FredkiTi,
Mark Jones, Ron Van Buskirk
and Scott Burns helped to put
the Eagles on top of the Lin
colnshire Amateur Basketball
League, Southern Division.
The Eagles are stil lin the
Amateur Basketball Association
intermediate championships and
will meet stretford Tigers at
Spitaigate — better known to
the basketball fans as the Eyrie
— on January 18th.
Asked what progress the
Eagles could make in the compe
tition, Mr. Taylor's first com
ment was: "Difficult to say." He
went on to add: "We ought to
stand a fairly good chance of
going through the quarter finals,
which is better than the club
has ever done before. But a lot
depends on how good these
Americans are."
