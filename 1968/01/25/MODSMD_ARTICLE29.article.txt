# Coaches Still Prefer Lew

### 
CHICAGO (AP) â€” Regardless
of the battle of the Astrodome,
two winning college basketball
coaches said Tuesday they pre
ferred UCLA's Lew Alcindor
over top-ranked Houston's El
vin Hayes.
"I still have to take Alcindor,
the most unselfish big payer I
ever saw, over Hayes, as great
as he is," said Coach Don Has
kins of Texas-El Paso in a tel
ephonic report to the Chicago
Basketball Writers chapter.
"I must go for Big Lew, who
may be the greatest player in
basketball history when he ma
tures," declared Coach A 1 Mc-
Guire of Marquette, whose War
riors lost to Houston 77-65 earli
er in the season.
Hayes' Greatest
Haskins said he viewed Hous
ton's 71-69 victory over UCLA
on television and concluded that

while Hayes played his greatest
game Alcindor didn't play up to
par.
"At that, UCLA shot only 33
per cent from the field and
nearly won the game which
shows how great a team UCLA
really is," said Haskins. Has
kins, whose 1965-66 Texas West
ern team won the NCAA title,
said there was one doubt in his
mind about Alcindor.
Strength Lacking?
"I am wondering if Alcindor
has the tremendous strength to
become an instant superstar in
pro basketball," said Haskins.
"This question developed in my
mind when I saw Hayes and
Ken Spain of Houston push him
around pretty good."
On the same subject, however,
Marquette's McGuire emphasized
that Alcindor still is a growing
boy.
