# Colleges Will Feel Federal Aid Pinch
## 
### 
Federal financial assistance to
colleges will be reduced sharply,
but financial aid to primary and
secondary schools in poverty
areas will not be cut at all, un
der the budget-reducing program
that has been adopted by the
Department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare.
The Welfare Department has
decided, it was disclosed Friday,
to make its heaviest cut—a full
third—in grants it makes to in
stitutions of higher education
for improvement of educational
facilities, including classrooms
and laboratories.
The budget cuts, applicable
for the balance of the Govern
ment's current fiscal year, which
runs through June 30, are being
put into effect under an order
issued by President Johnson in

November. At that time, he or
dered all the Government's non
defense agencies to reduce
spending commitments on "con
trollable" programs by 10 per
cent and personnel budgets by 2
per cent. Mr. Johnson left it up
to each agency to decide how it
would reach this overall objec
tive.
These grants will be reduced
from the originally scheduled to
tal of $450-million to $300-mil
lion.
Over-all, the department will
reduce its spending in the cur
rent fiscal year by $700million
from the $11.7-billion proposed
by President Johnson a year
ago. Of this total, $150-million
represents cuts ordered by Con
gress and $550-million reflects
those made under the Presi
dent's November order.
