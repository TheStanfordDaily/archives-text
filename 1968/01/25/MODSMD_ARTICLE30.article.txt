# Courage, Flexibility—What An Educated Woman Needs
## 
### 
"A certain courage, an open
ness to opportunity, and a great
deal of flexibility" — these are
the qualities an educated woman
needs to develop, according to
Mrs. Elizabeth Cohen, Assistant
Professor in the School of Edu
cation.
She said the most important
factors in determining an edu
cated woman's happiness were
"the cultivation of a certain
eager, optimistic attitude toward
life, the development of skills,
and self-discipline."
However, she noted unhappily,
"None of these things are taught
in a course at Stanford."
This lack of attention for the
particular problems facing edu
cated women in today's society
has been a topic for several mem
bers of the Stanford community
in the last week. B. Davie Napier,
Dean of the Chapel, addressed
his sermon to this subject last
Sunday, and after the service
many women students joined
discussion groups to further ex
amine these problems.
At Tuesday night's program
in Lagunita Court, Dr. Cohen

spoke on the topic "Women:
Problems and Decision-Making."
Flexibility Urged
Dr. Cohen said it was "irra
tional," for a women student to
make specific choices at this
time; it is better to remain flex
ible. Mrs. Bernice Zelditch, En
glish teacher at Foothill Junior
College and wife of the head
of Stanford's Sociology Depart
ment, told a discussion group
after Dr. Cohen's talk women
students are apt to imagine
problems with right and wrong
answers.
Actually, she said, decisions
are worked out on a personal,
and therefore adaptable level,
rather than on a theoretical
plane.
Dr. Cohen said the most im
portant question for a woman
to ask herself is "What should
I do that will help me discover
my competencies and strengths
and develop them?" She ex
plained that college helps a per
son discover his academic in
terests, but these are only a
limited part of his competencies.
She recommended choosing a

"challenging job that demands a
lot of you" rather than "enter
ing graduate school because you
don't have anything else to do."
Suburban Housewives
Another problem is that after
a woman gets married and has
children, she may find that these
alone are not sufficient. Dr.
Cohen described the situation:
"Entirely too many educated
women in their thirties suffer
from depressions, particularly
after their children get into
school."
She spoke critically of the su
burban wife who "makes work
to fill her time so she can avoid
making a real decision about
her life."
Dr. Cohen and other discus
sion leaders admitted that wo
men with children are at a dis
advantage in the working world
because they do not want their
careers to conflict with their
major concern, their family.
However, Dr. Cohen affirmed,
"If the educated woman really
knows what she wants, nothing
will stop her."
