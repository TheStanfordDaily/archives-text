# Judicial Council To Hear CIA Demonstrators' Case
## 
### 
The student Judicial Council
will meet tonight to hear the
case of ten students charged with
illegally demonstrating against
Central Intelligence Agency re
cruiting.
Previously the council had re
fused to hear the case and it had
taken to the all-faculty Interim
Judicial Body (IJB), an appeals
board above the council.
Then in early December, the
council changed its mind, and
the IJB agreed to remand the
case to the council.
The charges stem from a Nov.
1 demonstration against CIA re
cruiting in Encina Hall. The stu
dents are accused of violating
campus policy on demonstra
tions by blocking Encina's west
entrance.
One student is also charged
with "recklessly" shoving a
sign through the doorway
"narrowly missing the head of
an individual who was on the
other side of the door."
The person whose head was
narrowly missed was reported
to be Dean of Students Joel
Smith, who is prosecuting the
case on behalf of the University.
The IJB voted 3-2 at a Dec. 5
meeting to send the case back
to the Judicial Council. Nine of
the accused students refused to
attend that IJB meeting.
The Associated Students, of
which the council is the judicial
arm, does not recognize the pres
ent IJB. By vote of the legisla
ture on Nov. 30, ASSU decided

not to recognize any judicial ap
peals board not composed of
faculty and students.
The council had first decided
not to hear the case because it
felt, on the basis of an earlier
IJB precedent, that if it found
the students not guilty of a Fun
damental Standard violation, its
ruling would almost certainly
be overturned.
The Fundamental Standard is
the general code of student con
duct, which the Judicial Council
is supposed to enforce. The IJB
had decided last spring that any
violation of University policy
was necessarily a violation of
the Standard.
The Council vehemently dis
agreed with the higher board,
and the student legislature
later backed up the council's
interpretation with an act
"clarifying" the ASSU by-laws
on the point
The IJB, however, contends
that this act has no bearing on
the demonstrators' case because
it came after the demonstration.
This opinion is shared by Dean
Smith. The question hinges on
whether LASSU's action was a
clarification or a change in its
interpretation of the Funda
mental Standard.
In addition to the case of the
accused demonstrators, the coun
cil will hear testimony tonight
on these questions:
—"Has the ASSU Judicial
Council the right or duty to en
force University policy as such?
—"Is the University policy on

demonstrations compatible with
the freedom of expression guar
anteed by the First Amendment
and inherent in the idea of a
University?
—"What is the relation be
tween University policy on dem
onstrations and the Fundamental
Standard?
Presiding over the council will
be Richard Such, a law student
who became chairman recently
when John Raskin's term on the
council expired.
