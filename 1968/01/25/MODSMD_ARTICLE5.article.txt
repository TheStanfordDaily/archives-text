# Lambda Nu Seeking Approval For Women To Live In House
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
Lambda Nu fraternity voted
Tuesday evening to "negotiate
with th'? University" on a propo
sal for a coeducational living ex
periment in their house next
year.
The proposal calls for twenty
women "Associates of Lambda
Nu," chosen by draw, to live on
the first and second floors of
the south wing of the house, lo
cated on Lomita Court next to
Lake Lagunita.
House President Fred Fudacz
said yesterday that the proposed
experiment "reflects the house's
growing awareness of the limi

tations of an all male resi
dence."
Fudacz said the fraternity
feels "the separation of the sex
es at Stanford perpetuates arti
ficiality in male-female relation
ships and that the feminine
perspective would benefit the
house's intellectual and social
atmosphere."
The proposal is carefully set
forth, explained Fudacz, so that
Lambda Nu can "maintain its
integrity as a local fraternity
under the existing corporate
laws of the State of California."
The women then will not be
officially members, but ac

cording to the proposal will
take part in the planning and
administering of all activities
except rush.
The selection procedure for
men will not be affected by the
experiment. The house present
ly uses a "positive vote system"
whereby every member has a
certain number of votes which
he can divide among the rushees
as he pleases. Those rushees
with the highest number of posi
tive votes are given bids by the
fraternity.
Fudacz said that the fraternity
has the support of their alumni
for the experiment. He also said
that he and several members of
the house have spoken with
Dean of Students Joel P. Smith
regarding the proposal.
However, it was ascertained
yesterday by The Daily that
Smith "would be most receptive
to their (the Lambda Nu) propo
sal" if it contained three con
siderations:
• that the women would not
be selected by the house;
• that there would be guaran
teed female participation in
house policy; and
• that there be a guaranteed
end of house selectivity for all
members after one year.
Dan Williams, assistant dean
of students, said yesterday that
these criteria represent what
"in his (Smith's) judgement, are
important for an effective co
educational residence."
Fudacz said yesterday that
the last criterion was the only

one which the proposal did not
include. He expressed doubt
that it would be possible to
guarantee an end to house se
lectivity, at this time, but he
plans to discuss this with
Smith.
Smith has been in Florida and
unavailable for comment.
Fudacz however pointed out
that the proposal calls for a
committee "to review the co
educational program and report
on its evaluation" next year.
Eating clubs have presented
the Dean of Student's Office with
a proposal to make Toyon co
educational. Presently, four eat
ing clubs accept women: Los
Arcos, El Capitan, El Campo,
and Breakers.
Another club, El Tigre, voted
down a proposal to allow women
to join their ranks. The change
lost by one vote.
