## Air Force Searchers Find H-Bomb Pieces 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Pieces of one or more of four
hydrogen bombs aboard an Air
Force B-52 that crashed Sunday
off Greenland have been found,
the Pentagon reported Wednes
day.
But "it still has not deter
mined whether parts of the
plane or of the four nuclear
weapons carried on the plane
went into or through the ice,"
the Defense Department said.
Left unanswered was whether
the bombs are imbedded in the
ice or are on the surface.
This was the first official con
firmation of reports that the
number of nuclear bombs
aboard the plane totaled four.
The announcement did not
make clear precisely where the
parts of the hydrogen bombs
were found, but indications
were that this was on the thick
ice cover over North Star Bay
where the plane went down.
The Pentagon said earlier
search teams using dog sleds
and helicopters found scattered
debris and fuel burns near the
impact site about seven miles
southwest of Thule, Greenland.
It said scientists had detected
what is described as low-level
alpha radiation there.
In revealing that "pieces of
weapons-associated hardware
were identified among the de
bris," the Defense Department
statement did not say whether
significant amounts of the
bombs were located. Nor was it
clear whether just one bomb or
more were involved in the dis
covery.
The Pentagon has refused to
discuss the size of the bombs,
but sources indicate they were
l.lmegaton hydrogen bombs —
the equivalent explosive force of
1.1 million tons of TNT.

• Khe Sanh Shelled
SAIGON (AP)— North Viet
namese heavy artillery hit the
U.S. Marines' Khe Sanh base
for the first time late Wednes
day. Explosion of the big shells
all but muffled an accompany
ing rain of lighter projectiles—
mortar rounds and rockets.
A 30-minute barrage from
Communist batteries signaled a
step-up in the military confron
tation in the Khe Sanh hill coun
try, a defensive American array
against invasion from the North
that has brought the threat of
the war's biggest battles to the
critical sector below the demili
tarized zone.
There was no immediate word
of casualties or results of coun
terfire from American batteries
at the base, headquarters of the
reinforced 26th Marine Regi
ment on a red clay bluff three
miles north of the town of Khe
Sanh.
Marine spokesmen said 150
shells spewed from the long
range Red guns, perhaps moved
by hand into the Annamlte
Mountains just as the Commu
nists positioned mountain how
itzers for the siege that forced
surrender of the French at Dien
Bien Phu in 1954.
• Castro To Resign?
HAVANA (AP) — An official
reference to Fidel Castro as
general secretary of Cuba's
Communist party touched off
speculation Wednesday that Cas
tro might resign as prime mini
ster to concentrate on control
over the party.
The party's central committee
met amid rumors that Castro's
brother, Raul, was favored to
succeed him as prime minister.
Raul now is deputy prime min

ister and chief of the armed
forces.
A one-paragraph announce
ment in the official Communist
organ Granma said the commit
tee meeting was called in the
name of the eight-man politburo
headed by Castro. Granma then
referred to Castro as general
secretary.
Castro has been first secre
tary, rather than general sere
tary, since the party was
formed in October 1965.
If Castro steps down as prime
minister, that post likely would
become more administrative.
The bearded Cuban leader still
would hold the most powerful
political job arid the leadership
of the country.
• Rights Bill Pushed
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres
ident Johnson asked Congress
Wednesday for virtually the
same civil rights program he
sought last year. But high ad
