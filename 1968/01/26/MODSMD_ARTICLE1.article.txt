# LBJ Calls Up Reserves, U.N. To Meet On Korea
##

Compiled From The Associated Pre»a
Aroused by North Korea's seiz
ure of the USS Pueblo, the
United States Thursday called
more than 14,700 airmen to ac
tive duty and sought an urgent
meeting of the U.N. Security
Council.
President Johnson ordered the
call - up of men to active duty
immediately. Then he dis
patched Ambassador Arthur J.
Goldberg to the New York head
quarters of the United Nations
to present a formal request for
a Security Council meeting.
Th<> decision to seek Security
Council action was taken in
the face of North Korea's past
record of ignoring the United
Nations. It is not a member.
After presenting the request
for a meeting to the (council's
January president, Ambassa
dor Agha Shahi of Pakistan,
Goldberg said the United
States wanted a session at
10:30 a.m. P2ST Friday.
While pressing for a resolu
tion of the crisis through diplo
matic means, the White House
indicated the ground troops
may be mobilized later if the
situation worsens.
White House press secretary
George Christian told newsmen
the Security Council will be
asked to consider what he called
North Korea's "aggressive ac
tion" against South Korea and
also "the Illegal and wanton sei
zure of a United States vessel
and crew in international wa
ters."
Communist guerrillas from
the north have been accused of
an attempt to assassinate South
Korean President Chung Hee
Park.
Christian said Johnson's ap
peal to the United Nations "re

flects his earnest desire to settle
this matter promptly and, if at
all possible, by diplomatic
means."
The President has no pres
ent plans to make a personal
apj>earanoe before the U.N.
council. Christian said. An
other effort also will be made,
it was learned, to enlist So
viet Russia's aid in obtaining
the release of the Pueblo and
its crew. The Soviets spurned
the first overture.
On Capitol Hill, Rep. Paul
Findley, R-111., introduced a res
olution that would put Congress
on record as supporting Johnson
in any effort to recover the ship.
Findley said adoption of his
resolution would show that Con
gress is united behind the Presi
dent's efforts in this instance,
despite disagreements over Viet
nam war policy.
The call-up of air reservists
affects 9,340 Air National
Guardsmen, 4,847 Air Force re
servists, and 600 Navy air re
servists. The move to strengthen
the nation's air arm was precipi
tated by the capture off North
Korea Monday night of the light
ly armed U.S. Navy intelligence
ship and its 83-man crew.
Efforts to effect the release of
the captives through diplomatic
means continued despite Mos
cow's intial refusal to act as in
termediary.
Also rebuffed was a U.S. at
tempt to deal directly with the
North Koreans at a meeting of
the Military Armistice Com
mission at the Panmonjom
truce site in Korea.
Johnson's decision to call up
the air reservists was reached
at a morning conference in the
White House. Phil G. Goulding,
assistant secretary of defense.

described the move as "a precau
tionary measure to strengthen
our forces."
Orders went out to the reserv
ists to report to their bases be
fore Friday night. Altogether
there are 372 fighter and tran
sport planes in the various units,
which is the number Johnson
asked for.
A National Guard spokesman
said the air guard units are
ready for immediate movement.
The units have been brought up
to 100 per cent levels in man
ning and equipment in recent
months.
Another American soldier was
killed Friday by "hostile fire"
during a sweep for North Ko
rean infiltrators.
He was the second U.S. sol
dier killed in the current series
of incidents following an unsuc

cessful assassination attempt on
President Chung Hee Park by a
gt-oup of 31 Communist infiltra
tors Sunday night.
The first American was killed
in action Wednesday night.
Christian said Johnson
reached his decision to beef up
the Air Force at a breakfast
conference with Secretary of
State Dean Busk, Secretary of
Defense Robert S. McNamara,
and U.N. Ambassador Arthur
J. Goldberg, among others.
The Pentagon said both Mc-
Namara and the Joint Chiefs
of Staff recommended calling
up the air reserves.
If there was any doubt as to
the reason, Christian said the
mobilization was directly con
nected with the Pueblo affair.
Christian said "efforts are
