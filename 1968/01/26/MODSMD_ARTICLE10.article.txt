## Who's Calling What A Mick? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
RE: Scott Keenoy's article on
Micks in The Daily, Jan. 24.
Granted, Stanford has its
share of "micks" (courses re
quiring little or no work to get
an A or B) — CE 170, Health Ed
400. Use of the Library. I'm sure,
however .that the rest of Stan
ford's undergraduates would
like to meet your budding ge
niuses who consider courses like
the following to be "micks":
Psych. 60, Stat. 50. Bio. 4 & 5,
Chem. 4 & 5, "general studies
courses with a '1' beside their
name."
May I suggest that your fame
of reference be broadened to in
clude members of the Stanford
community outside of your resi
dence who have taken these
courses. I'm sure that you would
get some very different views
on the subject. Some of us not
so-gifted students have had to
struggle through those "micks."
In addition to "ease" a "mick"
seems to bo, in your sample's es
timation, any course which one
enjoys while getting a good
grade. I feel sorry for the stu
dent who knocked the overseas
"where you fulfill all your hu
manities and social studies re
quirements and have fun doing
it."
Does enjoying a learning ex
perience make it a "mick"? If so,
then Professors Baily, Buss,
Eriedlander, Gurley, Kennedy,
Mothershead, Novak. Potter,
Rhinelander, Rivers, Spitz, and
Wright (to name a few) had bet
ter change their approach quick

ly or they, too, will be accused
of giving "micks."

Looking For Goldmine
Editor, The Daily:
Let me make it abundantly
clear that the statements Mr.
Keeney attributed to me in his
article on "Mickey" courses
were in no way true.
I am not a veteran of five
health courses, and I really do
not know enough about "Mick
ey's" to judge if there is a veri
table "goldmine" at Stanford or
not.
With regard to the statement
about the "one where I got D
minuses on the midterm and
final and got a B minus in the
course." — that's just false. The
grades, if Mr. Keeney will re
member, were C minus and C,
and the author fails to mention
the more heavily weighted re

search paper that received a B
plus/A minus. I realize that D
minus sounds better, but those
were not the grades.
At no time did I say anything
that would cast aspersions on
any department or course — in
fact I was a little leery to dis
cuss the matter at all in light
of the previous Daily attacks
on Dr. Byrd and his department.
Unfortunately what I did say
ended up twisted around to fit
Mr. Keeney's muck-raking ends,
while putting me in the rather
uncomfortable position as the ap
parent spokesman for the sup
posed "goldmine."
Anyway — the article was
printed and no retraction ever
catches up with the original, but
hopefully my situation will cause
the Daily editors to be a little
more critical of what their re
porters turn as the "super
scoop of the week."
