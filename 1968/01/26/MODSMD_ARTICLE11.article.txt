## Pueblo Crisis: Blinkmanship 
### Tim Haight 
"Everybody is looking with a
mixture of confidence and appre
hension to the "statesmen" of
the various peoples, ready to
heap all praise on them if they
"succeed in avoiding a war," and
ignoring the fact that it is only
these very statesmen who ever
cause a war, usually not even
through their bad intentions, but
by their unreasonable misman
agement of the affairs entrusted
to them." —Erich Fromm
For the first time since the
1962 Cuban missile crisis, forces
of the Air Reserve and Air Na
tional Guard have been mobi
lized. This is in response to the
"Pueblo Crisis" in North Kofea.
People, we are getting sucked
in, and the only way to act is to
protest.
At first this may sound like
treason. After all, it looks like
the Pueblo was in international
waters and like this incident is
part of a unified campaign by
the North Koreans, including
also border incidents and the re
cent attempt to assassinate
South Korean officials.
But even if this is true (and
our experience with the Tonkin
Gulf affair could lead us to stay
our judgment) it is irrelevant.
What is relevant is the proper
nature of our response, in con
sideration of the consequences
of our actions.
Collision Course
At the present time the United
States is on a collision course
with the Soviet Union, much like
the Cuban missile confrontation.
Only this time the figures in
Washington are different, the
models of response are different,
and the alternatives open to both
sides are dangerously, perhaps
fatally, limited.
Before we can discuss why we
are now involved in a situation
far more grave than the missile
crisis—more grave, even, than
the short-range prospects of the
war in Vietnam—we must un
derline the reasons that make
that missile crisis the best mod
el of our present predicament.
To do that, we must reexam
ine those fateful events in the
fall of 1962.
The issue in the missile crisis,
first of all, was not national se
curity. As Secretary of Defense
McNamara said at the time, "A
missile is a missile. It makes no
great difference whether you are
killed by a missile fired from the
Soviet Union or from Cuba."
I. F. Stone has written, "As
Sorensen wrote in his Kennedy,
'To be sure, these Cuban missiles
alone, in view of all the other
megatonnage the Soviets were
capable of unleashing upon us,
did not substantially alter the
strategic balance in fact . . . But
that balance would have been
substantially altered in appear
ance (italics in original); and
in matters of national will and
world leadership, as che Presi

dent said later, such appearances
contribute to reality.' The real
stake was prestige."
Korea Like Cuba
As it was in Cuba, so it is in
North Korea. The capture of an
intelligence ship does not threat
en our national security. Even
the loss of the lives of the Pueb
lo's crew, while a tragedy, would
not necessarily demand our
forceful retaliation.
A similar spy ship was at
tacked by Israel this June, with
considerable loss of life. The is
sue is not what has been done,
but how it was done and who
did it.
But the fact that the prime is
sue is prestige is not the most
dangerous similarity between
the present crisis and the events
in 1962. That similarity is the
disastrous tendency of our gov
ernment to look upon confronta
tions of this kind as some nu
clear game of "Chicken."
As I. F. Stone writes, "Th e
question was whether, with the
whole world looking on, Ken
nedy would let Khrushchev get
away with it. The world's first
thermonuclear c on 112 r on tation
turned out to be a kind of ordeal
by combat between two men to
see which one would back down
first.
"Schlesinger relates that in the
earlier Berlin crisis, he wrote a
memorandum to Kennedy pro
testing the tendency to defiine
the issue as "Are you chicken or
not?" But inescapably that's
what the issue came around to.
The Early Kennedy
"Schlesinger recounts an in
terview Kennedy gave James
Wechsler of the New York Post
in the Berlin crisis in which the
President recognized that no one
could win a nuclear war, that
"the only alternatives were au
thentic negotiation or mutual
annihilation, but—
"What worried him (Kennedy)
was that Khrushchev might in
terpret his reluctance to wage
nuclear war as a symptom of an
American loss of nerve . . . "If
Khrushchev wants to rub my
nose in the dirt," he told Wechs
ler, "it's all over." . .
In the Cuban crisis, this ten
dency had become more pro
nounced, as Stone notes. "James
Reston of the New York Times,
who saw Kennedy emerge "shak
en and angry" from his meeting
with Khrushchev in Vienna,
speculates that Khrushchev had
studied the Bay of Pigs. "He
would have understood if Ken
nedy had left Castro alone or
destroyed him; but when Ken
nedy was rash enough to strike
at Cuba but not bold enough to
finish the job, Khrushchev de
cided he was dealing with an in
experienced young leader who
could be intimidated and black
mailed." . . .
"There was an intensely per
sonal note in the Kennedy broad

cast which announced the quar
antine of Cuba. 'This secret,
swift and extraordinary buildup
of communist missiles ... is a
deliberately provocative and un
justified change in the status
quo which cannot be accepted
by this country, if our courage
(my italics) and our commit
ments are ever to be trusted
again by either friend or foe.'
"It was the courage of John
F. Kennedy which was in ques
tion, the credibility of his readi
ness to go the whole way if the
missiles were not removed. In
the eyeball to eyeball confronta
tion, it was Khrushchev who was
forced to blink first."
Does this sound familiar? It
should. In his "State of the Un
ion" address, President Johnson
underlined that it is our will
that is being tested. Dean Rusk,
the author of the "eyeball to
eyeball" metaphor, has been us
ing the missile crisis, and the
Berlin situation, as perfect rea
sons for maintaining our stand
in Vietnam.
How much more important,
then, to maintain our credibility
in a situation so much closer to
those precedents than Vietnam?
Keeping Virile Image
This syndrome can be exam
ined on another level as well.
The psychologies of Lyndon
Baines Johnson and Dean Rusk
seem well geared to this kind of
Faulknerian (both men are
Southerners) preoccupation of
facing the test of honr. Psychol
ogists in the Journal of Social
Issues (July 1966) have com
mented on this phenomenon as
the maintenance of the "virile
self-image."
We can imagine how impor
tant this is to Johnson, a man
who tells the story of the Texas
ranger that takes six bullets and
keeps coming.
Further, he is a troubled and
frustrated President, seeing dis
affection in the midst of the
plenty his New Deal mentality
thought to be the cure-all. He
needs an ego-boost. Here it is,
although it may cost our lives.
It is this masculinization and
personalization of the conflict,
embodied in the eyeball-to-eye
ball, man-to-man metaphor, that
changes brinksmanship to
blinksmanship and confounds
diplomatic goals and methods
with the turbulent forces of per
sonal pride.
But Cuba is not the only fac
tor converging on this crisis.
Also involved are Pearl Harbor,
the Arab-Israeli War and Viet
nam. These limit our alterna
tives in a time when flexibility is
imperative.
History Shapes Mentality
Pearl Harbor is felt in the
idea of "America attacked."
When this happens the Ameri
can people and leadership know
only one response. Any criticism
at this point is called treason.
This Pueblo crisis, in contrast to
the murky situation in Vietnam,
holds possible heroes and devils.
Irrationality is less tempered.
The Arab-Israeli War holds
two lessons. First, the "beauty"
of that war was its speed and
military conventionality. There
were not jungles in Egypt but
desert—maximizing the effect
iveness of a warfare of technol
ogy.
Second, it confronted us with
the danger of a "second front."
The speed of the war solved the
problem, but this memory might
force speed on the Pueblo Crisis.
Then there is Vietnam, our
land war in Asia. It is no ran
dom occurance that Air Force
reserves, not Army or Marine,
were the first to be called. We
will not be creating "another
Vietnam". Our national confu
sion about the war, and our lack
of adequate resources in an al
ready crisis-torn land could not
allow it.
But while this prospect is un
likely, this narrows our response

to one that will have to substi
tute technology for manpower,
speed and severity for powerful
buildup.
Our quickest, most severe
weapon is the Atomic Bomb.
New People In Charge
Further, the personalities in
charge of our policy have
changed. In the place of Adlal
Stevenson, a person now felt to
have urged restraint over Cuba,
we have Arthur Goldberg. Per
haps this is not too bad, but re
member that the U.N. is less
relevant in a fight with North
Korea than with the U.S.S.R.
Robert McNamara, although
still around, is now a lame duck.
In the place of Kennedy we have
Lyndon Johnson. Of course, the
Secretary of State is the same,
but that is hardly a consolation.
Remember also that this is an
election year, as it was in 1962.
Already Republicans have made
speeches about this current
threat to our "National Honor."
A campaign issue is in the mak
ing, and who can say that the
politician Johnson will not take
some risk of war to counter the
otherwise near-certainty of po
litical trouble?
Our country stands in one of
those situations where the
threads of history, the foibles of
our leaders, and the fixed re
sponses of the American people
auger ill for our future. Yet this
need not be so.
We must, at this point, urge
restraint by our government
and some action to break this
crisis-escalating momentum. We
must take our time. As George
Kennan has said, "There is no
presumption more terrifying
than that of those who would
blow up the world on the basis
of their personal judgment of a
transient situation. I do not pro
pose to let the future of the
world be settled, or ended, by a
group of men operating on the
basis of limited perspectives and
short-run calculations."
What Will Koreans Do?
Look at it one final way. What
can we do to North Korea that
we have not tried in North Viet
nam? If the Oriental mentality
is the same, they may endure it.
If they endure it, they may not
back down as Khrushchev, a
Russian from a Russia who lost
13 million lives in World War 11,
did. They might not save us
from ourselves.
Yet while the fact that it is
little, weak North Korea who is
facing us and not Russia might
indicate a less serious situation
even if North Korea does not
give in, we must then ask what
choice Russia has, in her strug
gle to maintain influence and
leadership in the communist
world.
Her obligations to help an in
transigent North Korea might
limit her responses to the point
that she will not have the oppor
tunity to de-escalate that Khru
shchev had in 1962. The situa
tion is this dangerous.
Stone writes, "The missile
crisis is a model of what to
avoid. This is the lesson John F.
Kenedy learned. 'His feelings,'
Schlesinger writes in the finest
passage of his A Thousand
Days, 'underwent a qualitative
change after Cuba: A world in
which nations threatened each
other with nuclear weapons now
seemed to him not just an ir
rational but an intolerable and
impossible world.
" 'Cuba thus made vivid the
sense that all humanity had a
common interest in the preven
tion of nuclear war —an interest
far above those national and
ideological interests which had
once seemed ultimate.'"
Kennedy learned this lesson.
Johnson and Rusk have not.
Perhaps, vicariously, we have.
If we have, the time for learn
ing is past. While we still can,
we must teach.
