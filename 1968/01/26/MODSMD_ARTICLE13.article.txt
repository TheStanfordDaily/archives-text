# Legal, Social Ethical Dilemmas
## When Can Physicians Perform Abortions? 
### BARBARA RITZ 
Each time a physician is asked to perform
an abortion, he must face a number of legal,
social, and ethical problems in complying with
the request.
The California Therapeutic Abortion Act,
passed last November 8, redefined the legality
of abortion practices in the state. The old
law, enacted in 1872, permitted abortions only
when continued pregnancy distinctly threat
ened the life of the mother.
Although the new Therapeutic Abortion Act
is more liberal than the previous law, it is still
ambiguous enough to put many physicians on
a legal tightrope in acting upon it.
Besides legal problems, the new abor
tion law has triggered moral and social
debates centering around the physician,
the pregnant woman, and the rights of
the unborn child.
The abortion law has changed, commented
Dr. Jerome Lackner, a San Jose doctor, but
society's attitude toward the unmarried preg
nant woman has not changed. The threatened
stigma of bearing a child out of wedlock is
enough to panic many unmarried girls into
getting an abortion.
California's new law permits abortions in
cases of forcible rape, incest, and statutory
rape if the victim is under 15 years of age, or
if there is "substantial risk" that continuing
the pregnancy would "gravely impair" the
"physical or mental health of the mother."
Some legal authorities interpret impairment
of "mental health" to mean that the woman is
potentially dangerous to herself or to others.
Thus, if a pregnant woman needs prolonged
psychiatric hospitalization, or if she is sui
cidal, or homicidal, she can legally be given
an abortion.
In many respects, however, the new
law has made it harder to gjt an abortion.
There Is a nebulous line between legal and
Illegal abortions on "mental health"
grounds. No doctor wants to spend up to
five years In Jail for crossing It.
Section 25950 of the Therapeutic Abortion
Act says the abortion must take place in a
hospital accredited by the Joint Commission
of Accreditation of Hosiptals.
The Palo Alto-Stanford hospital has this
accreditation, and it has an Abortion Com
mittee of two internists, two psychiatrists and
two obstetrician-gynecologists. Only three of
these physicians, one from each specialty, re
view a particular case.
The committee studies three pieces of evi
dence: a letter from the woman's attending

physician, and two others from consulting
physicians. The committee evaluates the case
and, in about a week, either approves or
denies the abortion. Approval is by majority
vote.
Four times a year the Palo Alto-Stanford hos
pital has to send a report of the committee's
activities to the State Department of Public
Health. The report states whether the abor
tions were approved or denied, and on what
grounds.
The same basic procedure is followed in
every abortion case. The physician first de
termines the medical history of a woman de
siring an abortion. Then he conducts a physi
cal examination to make sure she is preg
nant.
After the diagnosis, the physician will
counsel the woman, discussing what
chances she might have for obtaining a
legal abortion. If he believes the abortion
can be performed legally, the physician
will send the woman to two other physi
cians for consultation.
The information from all three physicians
is sent to the Abortion Committee, along with
an application for approval.
If rape or incest is to be grounds for the
abortion, the physician must notify the dis
trict attroney of the county in which it alleg
edly occurred. The D.A. investigates the
charges, and may or may not send the Com
mittee permission for an abortion.
If the Abortion Committee does not get an
answer from the D.A.'s office within five days,
it may approve the abortion.
If it is a question of impairment to "mental
health," the woman may be granted an abor
tion depending on the circumstances. An ex
amining psychiatrist must find a certain kind
of mental illness, where the woman is "dan
gerous to herself or to the person and prop
erty of others, or is in need of supervision
or restraint."
If a woman says she will kill herself if she
does not get an abortion, the psychiatrist
must decide if she really means it.
If a girl asks a doctor at the Cowell
Health Center for an abortion, she is not
turned away. The policy of the Health
Center does not cover therapeutic abor
tions, but the girl may still be referred
to private doctors, if she so desires.
She may also receive counseling for any
physical or mental complications caused by
her condition. After determining her preg
nancy, the Health Center doctors discuss all
the alternatives.

The information she gives the Health Cen
ter and her examination are all confidential.
Several persons from the "California Com
mittee to Legalize Abortion" operate a 'coun
seling service* which gives out information
concerning abortions but does not direct peo
ple to a hospital or an individual doctor.
It does direct them through various chan
nels out of the United States. Abortionists
in Mexico charge approximately $200 for an
abortion and are said to pay much of that to
local police.
Women who want abortions cannot be
typed. Most requests come from married
women. The unmarried pregnant woman
might be of any social class and have any
type of personality.
When they seek out a doctor, many of these
women are confused and often display im
maturity. Some became pregnant while under
the influence of liquor Of drugs.
Some have backgrounds of psychological
problems and became pregnant intentionally.
Some women took precautions but were not
careful enough. The only thing these women
have in common is wanting an abortion.
A doctor at the Palo Alto hospital described
a paradox between the unmarried pregnant
girl who wants an abortion and society's im
age of her.
"The old standard was that in order for
an unmarried girl to have intercourse
there must be something wrong with
her." Some girls take precautions, he said.
Others do not.
The girl with adequate contraceptive mea
sures is not the girl who comes in needing an
abortion.
It is the other girl, he explained—the one
who was raised in a home where contracep
tion was never mentioned, who feels a moral
dilemma about sex, who becomes involved in
a sexual relationship and then one day finds
herself pregnant.
This is the girl who wants an abortion, he
said, and also the girl who is condemned
by society if she trys to get it.
The Stanford doctor cited a parallel between
the ethics of recent heart transplants and the
controversy over legalized abortion. The ab
stractions right and wrong are not always
obvious, he pointed out.
"If a person can be revived after his heart
has stopped, is it right to transplant this heart
into another person?" Some doctors believe
that by attaching electrodes to a person's

brain, they can detect activity, even if his
heart has stopped beating. Therefore, what
constitutes death? he asked—when a heart
stops beating, or when the brain stops func
tioning?
Likewise, when does life begin? The ques
tion debated often with abortions is the nature
of the object that is destroyed. Before the 20th
week of pregnancy, when an abortion is still
legal, a physician removes the feto-placenta
unit as he might remove an ordinary body
organ.
But after the 20th week, the fetus's legal
status changes. The Santa Clara Department
of Public Health requires the delivery of a
dead fetus after the 20th week to be reported
as a "still birth." If the fetus was delivered
alive and then died, a birth and death certifi
cate are needed.
The distinction between a fetus and a
human being would seem to depend on a legal
technicality.

Despite religious and social opposition, Colo
rado and North Carolina have also changed
their abortion laws. These states have pro
visions in their laws authorizing abortions
in cases of possible deformity or mental im
pairment of the fetus.
The California bill was not signed by the
governor until a similar provision was deleted
from it.
Great Britain has a new abortion law which
will take effect in April. The new law permits
an abortion when pregnancy might "threaten
the mother's life, or physical or mental health,
or might result in the birth of a child with
handicapping physical or mental abnormal
ities."
The new British law also permits an
abortion if the child's birth might Injure
the physical or mental health of the
woman's existing children.
This so-called "social clause" goes far be
yond the most liberal abortion laws in the
United States. Opponents to legalized abor
tion fear the same thing might happen to
present U.S. abortion laws, resulting in what
they call "abortion on demand."
Those who oppose the abortion laws say
they can be stretched too easily to meet the
needs of the persons involved. How is a psy
chiatrist supposed to determine what will
"gravely impair" the "mental health" of the
woman, they ask. How can a psychiatrist
know for certain if a woman really intends
to kill herself?

Many believe that abortions do not correct
the underlying problems in society.
Dr. Jerome Lackner of San Jose gave the
example of pregnancy caused by rape. "The
matter should be uncovering the causes for
sexual violence," he said, "not patching up
the mistakes."
He believes that taking a human life is not
the way to solve the problem. "The mother
is the victim, the rapist is the victim, the baby
is the victim. Killing one does not help the
other two."
One suggestion is legalization to change
the punitive attitude toward unmarried preg
nant women. In Sweden the "illegitimate"
pregnancy does not exist. Sweden years ago
removed the word "illegitimate" from its laws
and texts, referring Instead to "unmarried
motherhood."
California has begun taking steps to
remove stigmatizing labels from Its legal
records. The words "legitimate" and
"illegitimate" no longer appear on a Cali
fornia birth certificate.
One Stanford doctor criticized the tendency
to argue for or against an abstraction. You
can't lump all abortions together, he said.
How many persons have seen a sexually
assaulted 15 year old girl who has just been
brought into the emergency ward of a hos
pital? he asked. She may be bleeding and in
a state of shock.
He questioned whether this girl should have
to carry the product of a sexual assault. An
other example he gave was a pregnancy
brought about by incest. Should this girl be
forced to carry her father's child? he asked.
The Stanford doctor believes that every
abortion case should be evaluated separately.
How can you compare the girl who has be
come pregnant from rape, he asked, to a mar
ried woman who wants an abortion because
she is legally separated from her husband
and is planning a divorce?
Those who favor legalized abortion admit
the question of saving a life is valid and neces
sary.
But, they ask, is it best to produce a child
at all costs, whatever the threat to the moth
er's well-being, however deformed the baby
may be, whether it will be welcomed and
loved or rejected and hated?
The debate over abortion promises not to
let up soon. As one Stanford law student ob
served, "It all depends on your definition of
a human being."
