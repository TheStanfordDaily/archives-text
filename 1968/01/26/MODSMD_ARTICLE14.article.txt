# The 						Outpost
## Black Moderates, Radicals 
### Louis Knowles 
Whites cannot help but be
gleeful over signs of dissension
within the black community.
During the long hot summer
racial unity looked like a force
welding the dispossessed into a
mighty instrument of revenge.
Now the spectacle of blacks in
conflict with blacks causes
whites to breathe more easily.
Voices reminiscent of a past
era of relative calm can be heard
from some Negro groups.
Whites try to magnify these
pleasant sounds to drown out
the strident tones of the radi
cals. It is crucial that society not
allow wishful thinking to once
more obscure the truth.
The voices whites like to hear
belong to the moderates found
here and there in city councils
and in other white structures.
These men rely on the ideology
of the Negro bourgeoisie.
Trying To Go Middle Class
They are tougher than they
used to be, but they are still
trying to bring the Negroes into
the cultural mainstream of
white America.
For the moderates, blackness
is ttot a thing to be desired, or
even a thing to be spurned. It
simply is not. "People are peo
ple, goes their thinking, "and
Negroes must learn to be decent,
acceptable people. Then racial
prejudice will melt away."
White Approve Moderates
The moderate Negroes fit very
neatly into the white Establish
ment's plan for treating the ra
cial situation. The minority must
be uplifted to the level of the
majority.
These Negroes make fine com
munity leaders because they
agree that progress must be fit
ted into existing structures.
They talk the same language as
white liberals and in general
have adopted white culture.
There Is nothing Inherently
bad in this stance, but it is
wrong for the Negro bourgeoisie
to pretend it speaks for all black
people.
Radicals Acknowledge Culture
The radical black leadership
shares the moderates' concern
over ghetto poverty conditions.
But the radicals recognize the
culture of blackness as a legiti
mate life style. Trying to adapt
to the standards of acceptability
of the majority culture is a way
of dodging the basic Issue of hu
man rights.
One should not be forced to
give up his mores and traditions
to achieve legal equality and the
same economic opportunity.
There are rights and there is
dignity due to all men.
Whites too often become ob
sessed with bringing culture to

American black people when
their first duty Is to stop Inter
fering with the human preroga
tive of self-determination.
The black radicals will not
play games with whites. They
are unpleasant because they
speak their own language, keep
their own rules, and still de
mand equal human rights.
If whites decide to listen to
the moderates and to reject the

radicals as that "tiny minority
of troublemakers," nothing can
be expected but mounting ten
sion and more violence. For the
moderates are an old guard,
taught that white culture is
good and that black culture does
not exist. The radicals speak for
the new black man who demands
his human rights and his share
of national prosperity but who
does not wish to be white.

The moderate Negroes fit very
neatly into the white Establish
ment's plan for treating the ra
cial situation. The minority must
be uplifted to the level of the
majority.
These Negroes make fine com
munity leaders because they
agree that progress must be fit
ted into existing structures.
They talk the same language as
white liberals and in general
have adopted white culture.
There Is nothing Inherently
bad in this stance, but it is
wrong for the Negro bourgeoisie
to pretend it speaks for all black
people.
Radicals Acknowledge Culture
The radical black leadership
shares the moderates' concern
over ghetto poverty conditions.
But the radicals recognize the
culture of blackness as a legiti
mate life style. Trying to adapt
to the standards of acceptability
of the majority culture is a way
of dodging the basic Issue of hu
man rights.
One should not be forced to
give up his mores and traditions
to achieve legal equality and the
same economic opportunity.
There are rights and there is
dignity due to all men.
Whites too often become ob
sessed with bringing culture to

American black people when
their first duty Is to stop Inter
fering with the human preroga
tive of self-determination.
The black radicals will not
play games with whites. They
are unpleasant because they
speak their own language, keep
their own rules, and still de
mand equal human rights.
If whites decide to listen to
the moderates and to reject the

radicals as that "tiny minority
of troublemakers," nothing can
be expected but mounting ten
sion and more violence. For the
moderates are an old guard,
taught that white culture is
good and that black culture does
not exist. The radicals speak for
the new black man who demands
his human rights and his share
of national prosperity but who
does not wish to be white.
Whites cannot help but be
gleeful over signs of dissension
within the black community.
During the long hot summer
racial unity looked like a force
welding the dispossessed into a
mighty instrument of revenge.
Now the spectacle of blacks in
conflict with blacks causes
whites to breathe more easily.
Voices reminiscent of a past
era of relative calm can be heard
from some Negro groups.
Whites try to magnify these
pleasant sounds to drown out
the strident tones of the radi
cals. It is crucial that society not
allow wishful thinking to once
more obscure the truth.
The voices whites like to hear
belong to the moderates found
here and there in city councils
and in other white structures.
These men rely on the ideology
of the Negro bourgeoisie.
Trying To Go Middle Class
They are tougher than they
used to be, but they are still
trying to bring the Negroes into
the cultural mainstream of
white America.
For the moderates, blackness
is ttot a thing to be desired, or
even a thing to be spurned. It
simply is not. "People are peo
ple, goes their thinking, "and
Negroes must learn to be decent,
acceptable people. Then racial
prejudice will melt away."
