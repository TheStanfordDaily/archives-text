# What Are They For?
## Student VPs Hardly Visible 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The Constitution of the Asso
ciated Students defines the
powers and duties of the vice
president in exactly 100 words,
fewer than it took the founding
fathers to define the post now
occupied by Hubert Humphrey.
Can we carry the analogy
further? Are ASSU vice presi
dents historically consigned,
as American vice presidents
usually are, to the dustbin of
history?
There may be people who still
remember Alben Barkley (Tru
man's no. 2), but how many
remember Hannibal Hamlin,
Lincoln's first running mate?
Or Garret Hobart, or Levi Mor
ton?
Some vice presidents of
course, end up fulfilling the pur
pose for which they were
elected, to succeed the president
in case of "removal, death, res
ignation or inability . .
In fact, Lyndon Johnson be
came president that way. So
did Cesare Massarenti.
And now the post once held
by Massarenti, ASSU vice presi
dent, is vacant. An election to
fill it is scheduled for Feb. 14
and 15, and the elections com
missioner is collecting petitions
from those who want the job.
What does the ASSU vice
president do? Like many
other political positions, the
nature of the job Is defined,
usually by the person In It.
And even though the ASSU
vice president's duties are fairly
clear in the ASSU by-laws, there
is nothing to stop him from do
ing more things than he is ex
plicitly directed to, assuming of
course he has the blessing of
the president and the money
from the legislature.
Besides filling in for the presi
dent if necessary, or assisting
him, the vice president is sup
posed to sit as an ex-officio mem
ber of all ASSU boards and
commissions.
That's all the constitution has
to say.
The by-laws go just a little
further. The vice president is
made responsible to the legis
lature for carrying out its pol
icy concerning these board and
commissions.
The by-laws also place him on
the legislature's Student Affairs
Committee, to act as a consult
ing exeprt on the ASSU boards
and commissions.
These boards and commis
sions cover almost every con
ceivable kind of extra-curricu
lar group activity, ranging
from international relations to
art to school spirit to hous
ing to skiing to elections to
sponsor-choosing to speeches
to publications to women's
recreation.
All these things the vice pres
ident presumably has to know
something about.
To top it off, the vice presi
dent is also a non-voting mem
ber of the legislature, and at
the end of his term, he must
report to the legislature on his
concept of the vice presidency,
his accomplishments in office
and his suggestions for the fu
ture.
That's all there is to it. But
what have past vice presidents
actually done while in office?
William E. Stone, who was
Michael Collins' vice president
last spring quarter, said, "I
can't point to anything that I
accomplished. But that seemed
to be a function of the presi

dent then in office, and he didn't
feel the need to do anything
given the shortness of his
term."
Collins had succeeded David
Harris as president after Harris
resigned.
What Is the ASSU vice pres
ident supposed to do? "I
really don't have any idea,"
Stone said. He added he ran
mostly to test student reac
tion to the Harris regime.
Stone's opponent was en
dorsed by Harris.
The vice president can do any
thing the president can do,
Stone went on to say. As an
elected official, he can repre
sent the students on such things
as advisory committees. And he
can act as the president's stand
in.
Or if he has a particular pet
program, he can take advan
tage of the president's office to
pursue the program.
Stone had been active as stu
dent financial manager in 1965-
66. He is now in the Graduate
School of Business and said
he has no more time for ASSU.
Cesare Massarenti was
elected vice president at the
end of last year and suc
ceeded his running mate,
Peter Lyman, when Lyman
resigned in November.
Stone's remarks about "pet
programs" seems to have ap
plied well to Massarenti, who
spent much of his time last
summer helping to organize
campus cultural programs for
this year.
Even now with the added
duties of the presidency, Mas
sarenti still expresses a great
desire to upgrade the Stanford
cultural scene, which he regards
as an apalling wasteland.
The Vice president can do
"anything he wants," Massar
enti said, "because it's a job
which is not defined.
"But there are certain things
which are his own specialty.
For example, of the three top
officers of the ASSU, he is the
only one who can sit on all
boards of the ASSU and vote
on them."
Why would anyone want to
be vice president of ASSU?
Roy Weatherup, senior po
litical science major and can
didate in the coming election,
is running to protest. "Basic
ally, I am disgusted with
what is going on," he said In
a letter to the editor of The
Daily.
"The problem boils down to
this," the letter reads. "ASSU
is presently dominated by a
bunch of irresponsible, fanatic
al, unreasonable, uncompromis
ing, visionary radical activists
who have done nothing except
make their presence known.
"I am offering my candidacy

in order to enable Stanford stu
dents to express their disgust,"
the letter continues. "If I am
elected . . ~1 will only try to
do a good job fulfilling the lim
ited responsibilities assigned to
ASSU."
Another candidate is Denis
Hayes, a junior history major.
Hayes, whose platform runs to
five single-spaced typed pages,
presents a fairly detailed pro
posal for revamping the student
government from top to bottom.
And he says, "If elected
president, I will prepare a
draft constitution for a viable
political system, relevant to
the needs of today and tomor
row."
Hayes suggests that the prob
lem with ASSU today is it was
created for a different era
(1962) and has failed to adapt
to the changing times.
A third candidate is Skip
Tammany, senior biology major,
who resigned last night from
being assistant elections com
missioner to announce his can
didacy.

Tammany intends to focus
on some shortterm goals, in
order, he says, "to get results
and to establish credibility."
Pointing out that long-term
goals usually imply basic insti
tutional changes, Tammany
says the University will never
accept basic changes, Tammany
fore students should concentrate
on "seemingly small changes
[which] can be made and made
now."
Tammany doesn't think re
organizing the student govern
ment is going to provide a so
lution to the problems he sees.
A new system, he says, "Is
no better than an old one
when it Is the students them
selves who are to blame for
Its shortcomings."
The ASSU president and vice
president do have power, Tam
many insists, but they are not
using it wisely.
The fourth declared candidate
so far is junior English major
Johnie Scott, until recently a
member of the Black Student
Union.

Scott sees the most important
issues as going beyond the con
fines of Stanford University. He
cited a lack of communications
between the university and the
community outside.
"Intellectuals are estranged
from the people," he said.
"They're supposed to be leaders,
and if changes are going to
come, they're supposed to be pio
neered by schools like this."
Scott wants to see more "peo
ple from minority backgrounds"
brought into the University, in
cluding professors and admini
strators.
Speaking of his idea of how
a university should be, Scott
said, "I've gotten tired of scream
ing about it. I'm going to try
to see if it can be done."
By 4:30 today (the deadline
for filing petitions), perhaps a
few more hopefuls will have de
cided to take on the responsi
bilities of ASSU vice president.
It Is clear from the posi
tions of the four students who
have already announced their
positions, that the number of
ways one can define the vice
presidency exactly equals the
number of people who are
running for the office.
But the number of ways the
post is actually filled is consid
erably fewer. In the past, the
vice president (if he has done
anything at all) has seldom
done even those things the
ASSU constitution and by-laws
tell him to do.
But as Massarenti says, the
possibilities are countless.
