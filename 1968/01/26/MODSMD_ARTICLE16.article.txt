## 
### 
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Univer
sity Vice President for Finance,
will address area chairmen and
captains of the Senior Fund on
Feb. 6. The Fund is planning a
spring quarter drive for addi
tional annual gifts from alumni
and friends.
The fund was begun when a
senior class committee realized
Stanford must rely more heavily
on such donations. The Univer
sity's budget is supported by en
dowment income, tuition, fed
eral aid, and unrestricted gifts,
but the endowment per student
is substantially lower than at
Chicago, Yale, and Harvard.
Area chairmen for on-campus
living groups have been chosen.
They will select team captains
to solicit seniors in the spring.
Richard Werschkul, this year's
Fund chairman, explained "the
Senior Fund's primary goal is
to educate seniors about the
University's need for unrestrict
ed gifts." Fund Director Ronald
Bogard hopes to accomplish this
goal "by getting a high percent
age of participation among se
niors."
