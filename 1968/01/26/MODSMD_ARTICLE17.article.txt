# Doctor Discusses Population Limits
## 
### 
Public and personal attitudes,
not technology, are the key to
success in population control, a
Stanford Medical School phar
macologist told the Palo Alto
Kiwanis yesterday.
Dr. Summer M. Kalman said
that in spite of contraception,
abortion, famine, pestilence and
war, "it is estimated 500 million
people will starve to death" in
the early years of 1970'5.
"The attitudes of all of us
must change," he told the Kiwan
is. "The large family so neces
sary for the pioneer, for the
growth of agriculture, is not
needed."
Since the poorest and most
ignorant families are the ones
that produce the most children,
"we should include them in the
community for programs that
offer (contraceptive informa
tion). This is a matter which
concerns everyone."
The U.S. should make foreign
aid contingent upon programs
of population control and in
creased food production among
the recipient nations, he urged.
As has already been done in
Japan, abortions should be made
legal everywhere.
"There is no reason why there
should be about one million il
legal abortions per year in our

country," he said. "Abortions
properly performed carry a
smaller health risk than preg
nancy, and certainly should be
legalized."
Since youth will inherit the
problems caused by population
growth, "it is only fair to teach
them what we know" about pop
ulation trends, reproductive phy
siology and allied subjects.
If these are introduced into
the school curriculum, Dr. Kal
man emphasized, it should be on
the basis of "information, not
on morality."
The problem is immediate and
immense, he stressed. The U.S.
population just passed the 200
million mark "and this will dou
ble in 4 • 5 years."
Populations of cities in the
developed nations increased by
25 per cent during the decade of
the '50's. Increasing urbanization
everywhere brings with it smog,
water pollution, traffic problems,
disappearance of open areas,
and this in turn brings other
problems: erosion of personal
liberty by increased federal con
trol, waste and scrap disposal.
Especially in the developing
countries, urbanization "leads to
riots, political instability, and a
reduced rate of food production,"
Dr. Kalman declared.

problems caused by population
growth, "it is only fair to teach
them what we know" about pop
ulation trends, reproductive phy
siology and allied subjects.
If these are introduced into
the school curriculum, Dr. Kal
man emphasized, it should be on
the basis of "information, not
on morality."
The problem is immediate and
immense, he stressed. The U.S.
population just passed the 200
million mark "and this will dou
ble in 4 • 5 years."
Populations of cities in the
developed nations increased by
25 per cent during the decade of
the '50's. Increasing urbanization
everywhere brings with it smog,
water pollution, traffic problems,
disappearance of open areas,
and this in turn brings other
problems: erosion of personal
liberty by increased federal con
trol, waste and scrap disposal.
Especially in the developing
countries, urbanization "leads to
riots, political instability, and a
reduced rate of food production,"
Dr. Kalman declared.
Public and personal attitudes,
not technology, are the key to
success in population control, a
Stanford Medical School phar
macologist told the Palo Alto
Kiwanis yesterday.
Dr. Summer M. Kalman said
that in spite of contraception,
abortion, famine, pestilence and
war, "it is estimated 500 million
people will starve to death" in
the early years of 1970'5.
"The attitudes of all of us
must change," he told the Kiwan
is. "The large family so neces
sary for the pioneer, for the
growth of agriculture, is not
needed."
Since the poorest and most
ignorant families are the ones
that produce the most children,
"we should include them in the
community for programs that
offer (contraceptive informa
tion). This is a matter which
concerns everyone."
The U.S. should make foreign
aid contingent upon programs
of population control and in
creased food production among
the recipient nations, he urged.
As has already been done in
Japan, abortions should be made
legal everywhere.
"There is no reason why there
should be about one million il
legal abortions per year in our

country," he said. "Abortions
properly performed carry a
smaller health risk than preg
nancy, and certainly should be
legalized."
Since youth will inherit the
problems caused by population
growth, "it is only fair to teach
them what we know" about pop
ulation trends, reproductive phy
siology and allied subjects.
