"Where do we go from here?"
was the fundamental question
posed at last night's meeting of
the Stanford Anti-draft Union
(ADU).
ADU Chairman Leonard
Siegel told the group that about
400 "We Won't Go" statements
have been collected, and he
asked what people thought
should be done with them.
John Saari informed the mem
bers that advertisements and
television broadcasts from last
April's "We Won't Go" cam
paign had resulted in both more
statements and more financial
contributions to ADU.
A committee was formed for
dissemination of information on

draft resistance and for resump
tion of wide-spread leafleting of
soldiers and potential inductees.
Tables will also be manned in
White Plaza to distribute gen
eral information on the draft.
After the meeting Siegel in
formed The Daily that neither
he nor Saari, both members of
the "Stop the Draft Week"
steering committee, were among
the seven individuals charged
with conspiracy as a result of
the October demonstration.
Siegel said he does not expect
to be charged, but during the
course of the meeting also men
tioned the alleged existence of
underground organizations to
allow draft resisters to remain
in this country.
