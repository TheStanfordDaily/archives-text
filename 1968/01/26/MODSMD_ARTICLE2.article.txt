# Rush Plans Complete
## University Housing Uncertain 
### NICK SELBY (First of Two Parts) 
Rush procedures for winter
and spring quarter of this year
are now complete, but the list
of living alternatives other than
fraternities and eating clubs is
not.
Assistant Dean of Students for
University Residences Sally Ma
honey says that specific plans for
elimination or continuation of
the demonstration houses and
Durand House, and for more
coed dorms have not been for
mulated and will not be finalized
until the end of the quarter.
These plans will depend on
the Study of Education's
(SES) proposals and the re
sults of the housing question
naire distributed to students
earlier this month.
These reports will probably be
available by Feb. 1. Proposals
should be completed by the end
of the month, with announce
ment of all alternatives by the
end of winter quarter.
The latest possible date for
completion of the list of housing
alternatives is April 12, when
students sign bid cards in the
dean of students office.
"Students will not have to
sign bid cards only to find out
a few days later that there will
be living alternatives that they
hoped for and didn't count on,"
says Dan Williams, assistant
dean of students.

Plans for a new draw system
for the demonstration houses (if
they are continued) and Stern
Hall rooms also must be devel
oped.
"We need to create a compre
hensive, equitable draw to ack
nowledge specific house attri
butes and the desire of fresh
men men living on campus to
stay on campus," says Dean Ma
honey.
"Certainly the men who are
living on campus now or who
are on a waiting ILst should
get priority over those ofT
eampus. Last year we saw
many people living off-campus
move back on to live In the
demonstration houses," she
concludes.
The uncertainty over living al
ternatives also applies to under
graduate women. Although the
draw for spring housing alterna
tives will remain the same, the
plans for a draw for next fall are
as sketchy as the proposals for
living alternatives.
Meanwhile, informal meal ex
changes between freshmen and
fraternities and eating clubs
have already begun. The pro
gram this year calls for fresh
man house leaders to organize
exchanges on an individual basis.
Last year, freshmen signed
up for random exchanges, and
were assigned to visit eating
clubs, fraternities, and Stern
Hall houses as they desired.

The lack of overall planning
for meal exchanges symbolizes
a growing informality in rush
procedures. Besides being allow
ed three open houses in winter
and spring quarters, fraternities
and eating clubs can invite up
to five freshmen to their houses
for informal activities — exclud
ing. parties — during the week.
Strict rules providing- for
specific periods and areas of
contact with the freshman
have been abolished in favor
of this new practice.
"We hope for a sense of re

sponsibility in all parties in
volved,' 'says Bob Freelen, chair
man of the 13 member Ad Hoc
committee on Rush, which for
mulated rush policy.
"It is up to freshmen and Wil
bur sponsors to report instances
of too great pressure from up
per classmen, and up to the var
ious living groups not to try
to take advantage of each other,"
Freelen states.
The fraternities hope they
"won't have to add more rules
to control rush procedures," says
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
President Mike Quinn. "The
rules used to be ground out, and
they were unenforceable."
"We want to keep things as
loose as possible to emphasize
the responsibility of each party
concerned," he concludes.
Quinn also emphasized the
importance of the freshman
role in controlling rush pro
cedures. "We hope they will
take it upon themselves to
abide by the rules and to
chang-e them if they don't like
them."
Two other rush procedures are
new this year: the fraternities
will split into two groups for the
third open house, and the eating
clubs and fraternities are each

putting out separate rush book
lets.
The split of the fraternities is
designed to allow the freshman
a chance to visit other houses
without feeling an obligation to
visit the one he is most interest
ed in at the time. He will be able
to visit more houses and ex
amine them more closely under
this new procedure.
Inter-Club Council (ICC) Pres
ident Gary Blank explains that
the eating clubs suggested to
fraternity members of the Ad
Hoc Committee that they jointly
publish a supplement to the
Daily as the 1968 rush book.
The clubs felt that they would
be able to reach more graduate
students and women in this
fashion. In the past, the rush
book has only been distributed
to freshmen men. The clubs this
year are aiming at a much wider
audience.

and female graduate students

book. The clubs will publish a
supplement, the fraternity rush
book is scheduled for distribu
tion on Feb. 9. The Stern Houses,
due to the confusion over what
Stern Houses will be like, will
publish no rush book.
With the demonstration
houses looming very largely
over rush, several fraternities
are worried about filling their
pledge classes.
The Fij is, the Dekes, and the
Chi Psis all had small pledge

classes last year and a repeat
now would be disastrous. All are
scheduled to move into the new
cluster houses next fall and must
fill their houses so they can pay
the University rental fees.
The IFC considered ideas to
help these houses with their rush
programs, including proposals
to give them extra open house
nights, but no plans were for
malized. The IFC agreed to help
promote any special programs
— such as meal exchanges or

discussions.
Whether or not every frater
nity or eating club will get the
desired number of members re
mains to be seen. Says Quinn,
"I hope the possibility of demon
stration houses does not dissu
ade freshmen from at least visit
ing the fraternities. Besides
knowing the list of alternatives
they should also know what
each alternative entails."
