# Rush Plans Complete
## University Housing Uncertain 
### NICK SELBY (First of Two Parts) 
Rush procedures for winter
and spring quarter of this year
are now complete, but the list
of living alternatives other than
fraternities and eating clubs is
not.
Assistant Dean of Students for
University Residences Sally Ma
honey says that specific plans for
elimination or continuation of
the demonstration houses and
Durand House, and for more
coed dorms have not been for
mulated and will not be finalized
until the end of the quarter.
These plans will depend on
the Study of Education's
(SES) proposals and the re
sults of the housing question
naire distributed to students
earlier this month.
These reports will probably be
available by Feb. 1. Proposals
should be completed by the end
of the month, with announce
ment of all alternatives by the
end of winter quarter.
The latest possible date for
completion of the list of housing
alternatives is April 12, when
students sign bid cards in the
dean of students office.
"Students will not have to
sign bid cards only to find out
a few days later that there will
be living alternatives that they
hoped for and didn't count on,"
says Dan Williams, assistant
dean of students.

Plans for a new draw system
for the demonstration houses (if
they are continued) and Stern
Hall rooms also must be devel
oped.
"We need to create a compre
hensive, equitable draw to ack
nowledge specific house attri
butes and the desire of fresh
men men living on campus to
stay on campus," says Dean Ma
honey.
"Certainly the men who are
living on campus now or who
are on a waiting ILst should
get priority over those ofT
eampus. Last year we saw
many people living off-campus
move back on to live In the
demonstration houses," she
concludes.
The uncertainty over living al
ternatives also applies to under
graduate women. Although the
draw for spring housing alterna
tives will remain the same, the
plans for a draw for next fall are
as sketchy as the proposals for
living alternatives.
Meanwhile, informal meal ex
changes between freshmen and
fraternities and eating clubs
have already begun. The pro
gram this year calls for fresh
man house leaders to organize
exchanges on an individual basis.
Last year, freshmen signed
up for random exchanges, and
were assigned to visit eating
clubs, fraternities, and Stern
Hall houses as they desired.

The lack of overall planning
for meal exchanges symbolizes
a growing informality in rush
procedures. Besides being allow
ed three open houses in winter
and spring quarters, fraternities
and eating clubs can invite up
to five freshmen to their houses
for informal activities — exclud
ing. parties — during the week.
Strict rules providing- for
specific periods and areas of
contact with the freshman
have been abolished in favor
of this new practice.
"We hope for a sense of re

sponsibility in all parties in
volved,' 'says Bob Freelen, chair
man of the 13 member Ad Hoc
committee on Rush, which for
mulated rush policy.
"It is up to freshmen and Wil
bur sponsors to report instances
of too great pressure from up
per classmen, and up to the var
ious living groups not to try
to take advantage of each other,"
Freelen states.
The fraternities hope they
"won't have to add more rules
to control rush procedures," says
Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC)
President Mike Quinn. "The
rules used to be ground out, and
they were unenforceable."
"We want to keep things as
loose as possible to emphasize
the responsibility of each party
concerned," he concludes.
Quinn also emphasized the
importance of the freshman
role in controlling rush pro
cedures. "We hope they will
take it upon themselves to
abide by the rules and to
chang-e them if they don't like
them."
Two other rush procedures are
new this year: the fraternities
will split into two groups for the
third open house, and the eating
clubs and fraternities are each
