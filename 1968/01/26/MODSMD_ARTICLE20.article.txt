# Novak Discusses Split Among Bishops, Laity
## 
### DAN SNELL 
Michael Novak said in an in
terview Wednesday that Catho
lics and their bishops "live in
two different mental worlds."
Reacting to the letter sent re
cently by the U.S. Roman Catho
lic bishops to the nation's 46
million Catholics, the Stanford
associate professor of religion
said that bishops are on the
whole chosen for their ability in
fund-raising.
The prelates cannot thus be
expected to have much in com
mon with their ever more edu
cated flocks.
"There was a time when the
bishop could command a great
deal of respect," Novak said.
"The people weren't very well
educated, most of them, and
they were very impressed by
his learning and his vestments."
But now lay Catholics are
more likely to be well-read in
theology than their bishops, No
vak claimed.
In their letter the bishops de
nounced priests who leave the
priesthood as "derelict" and as
sources of "scandal." Novak
called this a "very wrong atti
tude."
He explained that in the past
the Catholics have felt that to
be a really good Catholic, one
should become a priest. Novak
said many persons have entered
the priesthood without recog
nizing the truth about them
selves, what they really want to
do in life.
"There is no 'derelection' In
recognizing the truth about
yourself," Novak said, and in
leaving the priesthood.
He stated that scandal is "in
the eyes of the beholder" in this
sort of matter. "There's scandal
in a priest leaving his post be
cause Catholics tend to be scan
dalized."
"There is really no theological
reason for a celibate priest
hood," Novak said. "Many young
Catholics want to go into the
priesthood but don't want to
take the vow of celibacy."
Novak said he thought it was
a "very good thing" that Alfre
do Cardinal Ottaviani, 77, had
resigned from his post as the
head of the Vatican's office
charged with protecting faith
and morals. Ottaviani was
known as an arch-conservative.
Pope Paul named Franjo Car
dinal Seper, 62, of Yugoslavia to

the post Ottaviani left. Seper
was important in bringing about
the 1960 accord between the Vat
ican and the Yugoslavian Com
munist government when he was
Bishop of Zagreb.
Novak says this change and
the other resignations of car
dinals that followed Ottavl
ani's step-down may not be
significant in the long ran.
But it may show that the Vat
ican is slowly coming around
to accept the rule adopted by

the Ecumenical Council that
prelates should retire at age
75.
"I think on the whole people
tend to overemphasize the im
portance of what the bishops
and the Vatican do. What I'm
really interested in is what in
telligent Catholics are thinking
here," Novak said.
"Those sorts of things will
probably have a lot more to do
with the future of Catholicism
than what bishops say."

priesthood but don't want to
take the vow of celibacy."
Novak said he thought it was
a "very good thing" that Alfre
do Cardinal Ottaviani, 77, had
resigned from his post as the
head of the Vatican's office
charged with protecting faith
and morals. Ottaviani was
known as an arch-conservative.
Pope Paul named Franjo Car
dinal Seper, 62, of Yugoslavia to

the post Ottaviani left. Seper
was important in bringing about
the 1960 accord between the Vat
ican and the Yugoslavian Com
munist government when he was
Bishop of Zagreb.
Novak says this change and
the other resignations of car
dinals that followed Ottavl
ani's step-down may not be
significant in the long ran.
But it may show that the Vat
ican is slowly coming around
to accept the rule adopted by

the Ecumenical Council that
prelates should retire at age
75.
"I think on the whole people
tend to overemphasize the im
portance of what the bishops
and the Vatican do. What I'm
really interested in is what in
telligent Catholics are thinking
here," Novak said.
"Those sorts of things will
probably have a lot more to do
with the future of Catholicism
than what bishops say."

Michael Novak said in an in
terview Wednesday that Catho
lics and their bishops "live in
two different mental worlds."
Reacting to the letter sent re
cently by the U.S. Roman Catho
lic bishops to the nation's 46
million Catholics, the Stanford
associate professor of religion
said that bishops are on the
whole chosen for their ability in
fund-raising.
The prelates cannot thus be
expected to have much in com
mon with their ever more edu
cated flocks.
"There was a time when the
bishop could command a great
deal of respect," Novak said.
"The people weren't very well
educated, most of them, and
they were very impressed by
his learning and his vestments."
But now lay Catholics are
more likely to be well-read in
theology than their bishops, No
vak claimed.
In their letter the bishops de
nounced priests who leave the
priesthood as "derelict" and as
sources of "scandal." Novak
called this a "very wrong atti
tude."
He explained that in the past
the Catholics have felt that to
be a really good Catholic, one
should become a priest. Novak
said many persons have entered
the priesthood without recog
nizing the truth about them
selves, what they really want to
do in life.
"There is no 'derelection' In
recognizing the truth about
yourself," Novak said, and in
leaving the priesthood.
He stated that scandal is "in
the eyes of the beholder" in this
sort of matter. "There's scandal
in a priest leaving his post be
cause Catholics tend to be scan
dalized."
"There is really no theological
reason for a celibate priest
hood," Novak said. "Many young
Catholics want to go into the
priesthood but don't want to
take the vow of celibacy."
