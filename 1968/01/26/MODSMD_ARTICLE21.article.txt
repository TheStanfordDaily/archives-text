# Red China ICBMs Soon, Expert Says
## 
### 
China will have 300 medium
and long-range intercontinental
missiles by 1976, according to a
Hoover Institution China watch
er.
Brigadier General Samuel
Griffith (USMC-Ret.) returned
in December from a six-week
trip around the world to check
on theories a Hoover study
group was formulating about
Red China.
He said he had encountered
several theories In his travels
about the future of China af
ter the so-called cultural revo
lution.
"First there's the MMG The
ory—Mao Must Go," Griffith told
the 30 faculty members and Hoo
ver fellows yesterday. "There are
those who believe that Mao Tse
tung is the only obstacle to par
ty unity, to a realistic foreign
policy, and to a good economic
program."
But the general said he could
not hold with that idea.
Other China watchers in Hong
Kong believe that China will
soon fragment into autonomous
"regional groupings" with only
a nominal relationship to the
central government.
Griffith said the official British
view was that the People's Lib
eration Army would eventually
take over and institute a strong
military government.
But Griffith said he and the
other members of Hoover's

Arms Control Study believed
that the Chinese economy has
been only slightly affected by
the cultural revolution, even
though communications net
works have been disrupted
from time to time.
Griffith did not comment on
his own view of China's political
future.
But he predicted that the Chi
nese would have 120 to 150 mis
siles with a range of 1800 nauti
cal miles by 1970, and they
would have the same number of
missiles with a range of 6000
miles by 1976.
Griffith pointed out that such
missiles could reach Seattle if
fired from the Chinese main
land, but not Palo Alto.
Griffith visited Denmark,
where he attended the Confer
ence for Strategic Studies at El
sinore; New Delhi; Bangkok;
Hong Kong; Taipei; Tokyo; and
Honolulu.
He predicted that the Congress
Party, India's ruling party, prob
ably will not be able to make im
provements in the country's
economy and might well fall
soon from power.
Militarily, however, the In
dians were not badly off in their
ability to defend themselves
against any renewed Chinese of
fensive since the United States
has recently equipped five divi
sions of mountain trained
troops, Griffith said.

his own view of China's political
future.
But he predicted that the Chi
nese would have 120 to 150 mis
siles with a range of 1800 nauti
cal miles by 1970, and they
would have the same number of
missiles with a range of 6000
miles by 1976.
Griffith pointed out that such
missiles could reach Seattle if
fired from the Chinese main
land, but not Palo Alto.
Griffith visited Denmark,
where he attended the Confer
ence for Strategic Studies at El
sinore; New Delhi; Bangkok;
Hong Kong; Taipei; Tokyo; and
Honolulu.
He predicted that the Congress
Party, India's ruling party, prob
ably will not be able to make im
provements in the country's
economy and might well fall
soon from power.
Militarily, however, the In
dians were not badly off in their
ability to defend themselves
against any renewed Chinese of
fensive since the United States
has recently equipped five divi
sions of mountain trained
troops, Griffith said.
China will have 300 medium
and long-range intercontinental
missiles by 1976, according to a
Hoover Institution China watch
er.
Brigadier General Samuel
Griffith (USMC-Ret.) returned
in December from a six-week
trip around the world to check
on theories a Hoover study
group was formulating about
Red China.
He said he had encountered
several theories In his travels
about the future of China af
ter the so-called cultural revo
lution.
"First there's the MMG The
ory—Mao Must Go," Griffith told
the 30 faculty members and Hoo
ver fellows yesterday. "There are
those who believe that Mao Tse
tung is the only obstacle to par
ty unity, to a realistic foreign
policy, and to a good economic
program."
But the general said he could
not hold with that idea.
Other China watchers in Hong
Kong believe that China will
soon fragment into autonomous
"regional groupings" with only
a nominal relationship to the
central government.
Griffith said the official British
view was that the People's Lib
eration Army would eventually
take over and institute a strong
military government.
But Griffith said he and the
other members of Hoover's

Arms Control Study believed
that the Chinese economy has
been only slightly affected by
the cultural revolution, even
though communications net
works have been disrupted
from time to time.
Griffith did not comment on
his own view of China's political
future.
