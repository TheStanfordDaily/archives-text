# Coed Dormitories Less Vandal-Prone?

### CHARLES THIERIOT 
Does the presence of the fair
sex tend to dampen and curb the
destructive elements of male be
havior?
The evidence from damage
records of the recently formed
demonstration houses in Wilbur
and Stern seems to indicate that
dollies calm the freshmen, but
have little effect on upperclass
men's behavior.
In Wilbur there has been a
marked reduction of destruc
tion In both Soto and Otero,
while Stern's Srrra and Grove
show damage costs similar to
last year's.
Joseph Higgins, director of the
Wilbur houses, quoted damages
in both Otero and Soto to be ap
proximately ten dollars last
quarter compared to the all-male
Wilbur houses with damage
costs over one hundred dollars
each.
Higgins feels this was due to
increased maturity of the stu
dents and a much greater diver
sity for the channeling of inter
ests. In Branner, after an initial
settling-in period, the damages
also have been far below those
in a regular freshmen dorm.
Higgins cited abundant activi
ties as the key factor in the ap
parent pacification of the de
structive male element in the co
ed dorms. "All one has to do is
sit in Soto and observe for sev
eral hours, and there is clearly
much more activity than in any
of the male houses."
According to Bill Leland, di
rector of the Stern houses, there
has never been a particularly
high rate of vandalism in any of
the Stern houses, and this year
there appears to b«> little change
even in the experimental dorms.

Stern has always been an all
undergraduate dorm while Wil
bur previously housed only
freshmen.
Residence Manager William
Freldrich also pointed out the
dlfTerenee in damage cost be
tween Wilbur and Stern but
emphasized that It was too
early to make a clear cut
statement after only one quar
ter.
Freidrich expressed three main
reasons which he felt accounted
for the reduced damage rate.
First, the great number of or
ganized programs in the coedu
cational houses result in less idle
time for the students.
Second, the presence of girls
in close proximity seems to in
duce a sobering effect upon the
men. The males apparently are
more conscious of their roles and
expected behavioral responses
with women around them.
Third, as shown most dramat
ically by the different damage
costs in Wilbur, the relationships
with older students seems to
produce a possible acceleration
of the maturation process as
manifest in reduced destruction
and vandalism.
Last year the cost of damage
in Wilbur was four thousand dol
lars compared with two thou
sand dollars in Stern. Freidrich
predicts the damage cost in Wil
bur this year with the addition
of the two coeducational dorms
will be greatly reduced.
In conclusion to this brief so
ciological survey, since destruc
tion seems to be more a function
of age rather than sex, it would
be financially advisable for the
university to usher all incoming
freshmen into all undergraduate
coed dorms before their destruc
tion potential is released.

of the male houses."
According to Bill Leland, di
rector of the Stern houses, there
has never been a particularly
high rate of vandalism in any of
the Stern houses, and this year
there appears to b«> little change
even in the experimental dorms.

Stern has always been an all
undergraduate dorm while Wil
bur previously housed only
freshmen.
Residence Manager William
Freldrich also pointed out the
dlfTerenee in damage cost be
tween Wilbur and Stern but
emphasized that It was too
early to make a clear cut
statement after only one quar
ter.
Freidrich expressed three main
reasons which he felt accounted
for the reduced damage rate.
First, the great number of or
ganized programs in the coedu
cational houses result in less idle
time for the students.
Second, the presence of girls
in close proximity seems to in
duce a sobering effect upon the
men. The males apparently are
more conscious of their roles and
expected behavioral responses
with women around them.
Third, as shown most dramat
ically by the different damage
costs in Wilbur, the relationships
with older students seems to
produce a possible acceleration
of the maturation process as
manifest in reduced destruction
and vandalism.
Last year the cost of damage
in Wilbur was four thousand dol
lars compared with two thou
sand dollars in Stern. Freidrich
predicts the damage cost in Wil
bur this year with the addition
of the two coeducational dorms
will be greatly reduced.
In conclusion to this brief so
ciological survey, since destruc
tion seems to be more a function
of age rather than sex, it would
be financially advisable for the
university to usher all incoming
freshmen into all undergraduate
coed dorms before their destruc
tion potential is released.
Does the presence of the fair
sex tend to dampen and curb the
destructive elements of male be
havior?
The evidence from damage
records of the recently formed
demonstration houses in Wilbur
and Stern seems to indicate that
dollies calm the freshmen, but
have little effect on upperclass
men's behavior.
In Wilbur there has been a
marked reduction of destruc
tion In both Soto and Otero,
while Stern's Srrra and Grove
show damage costs similar to
last year's.
Joseph Higgins, director of the
Wilbur houses, quoted damages
in both Otero and Soto to be ap
proximately ten dollars last
quarter compared to the all-male
Wilbur houses with damage
costs over one hundred dollars
each.
Higgins feels this was due to
increased maturity of the stu
dents and a much greater diver
sity for the channeling of inter
ests. In Branner, after an initial
settling-in period, the damages
also have been far below those
in a regular freshmen dorm.
Higgins cited abundant activi
ties as the key factor in the ap
parent pacification of the de
structive male element in the co
ed dorms. "All one has to do is
sit in Soto and observe for sev
eral hours, and there is clearly
much more activity than in any
of the male houses."
