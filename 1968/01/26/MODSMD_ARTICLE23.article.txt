# South Carolina College Sets Up 'Pleasure Fund'
## 
### 
Many colleges give loans—for
tuition, books, room and board
and the like. But only Wofford
College in Spartanburg, South
Carolina, has a "Pleasure Fund."
The fund was established by
an anonymous alumnus, class of
'39, who wanted to make sure
that no one goes through Wof
ford "without having any fun."
Students can borrow up to $50
interest-free for fraternity week
end, hi-fi equipment, or almost
anything else that gives them
enjoyment.
Those receiving loans certify
that the money won't be used
for school fees, room and board
or books.
All upperclassmen are eligible
to draw on the pleasure fund if
they have passing grades and
are deemed to be "worthy and
reliable" by college administra
tors. The money must be repaid

within four months, along with
a $1 charge for administrative
expenses.
The donor got the idea for the
fund as a senior at WofTord
when he found himself without
enough money to rent a tuxedo
and buy his girl friend a corsage
for a school dance. In setting up
the fund, he observed: "I believe
that having a good time at col
lege is important to any stu
dent."
