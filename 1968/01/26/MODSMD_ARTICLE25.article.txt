# Absences Disrupt History Department
## 
### 
The history department faces
the loss of as many as nine
members of its faculty, includ
ing the chairman and the asso
ciate head of the department,
for all or part of the next aca
demic year.
Three of the four East Asian
specialists in the department
may be missing. The Medieval
history section will also be hard*
hit, with two or three profes
sors on leave.
But the department will be re
inforced by visiting professors
and those who will be returning
from leaves of absence.
Executive Head David M. Pot
ter, a specialist in United States
history, will take a sabbatical
leave to study the problem of
alienation in American history.
Renaissance and Reformation
historian Lewis W. Spitz, who is
second in command of the de
partment is planning to spend
the year completing a book, The
Reformation in Historical
Thought.
Both men will spend part of
the year at Stanford and part
doing research elsewhere. Prof.
Spitz has been invited to Tue
bingen, Germany, to study the
Reformation at an institute
there.
Mark N. Mancall, assistant
professor in Chinese and East
Asian history, is planning to be
absent from Stanford. Far East
ern historian Claude A. Buss
will be away during the Autumn
quarter and possibly longer. Ly
man P. Van Slyke, whose spe
cialty is China, is also consider
ing a sabbatical.
Professor Gordon Wright, who

teaches modern European his
tory, will be serving the second
year of a two year appointment
as cultural attache with the
American Embassy in Paris.
Neither he nor American his
torian Don E. Fehrenbacher,
who is also away from Stanford
this year, will return to teach
ing in 1968-69.
Russian specialist Ivo J. Led
erer will spend at least one quar
ter of the coming year at an
overseas campus. Medievalist
William Carroll Bark will prob
ably be away from the Univer
sity for the entire year.
Some of the gaps in the de
partment will be filled by those
professors who will be returning
to the campus. G. Wesley John
son, the only historian of Africa
in the department, will be back
from an overseas campus this
Spring. Professors Barton J.
Bernstein and Thomas C. Smith
will both return from sabbatical
leaves next year.
The department is also invit
ing several prominent historians
to visit Stanford as lecturers.
Their names will not be released
until their appointments have
been approved by the trustees.
