## Indian Ruggers Take On No. 1 Team 
### 
Stanford's undefeated rugby
squad faces its toughest test of
the season as they take on
Church College of Hawaii to
morrow at 1:30 p.m. at Harry
Mahoney Field, behind the base
ball diamond.
Church was the number one
collegiate rugby team in the na
tion last year, and shows few
signs of losing that ranking this
year. Their only loss has been
to the BARTs (Bay Area Rugby
Team), who were formerly the

Olympic Club of San Francisco.
Church College has built up
its reputation by recruiting play
ers from the South Sea Islands
and Polynesia. Their brand of
rugby is fast, tough, and ex
citing, and it pays off in victo
ries as well as in spectator ap
peal.
Stanford Captain David Evans
commented that the Polynesian
teams which tour Australia al
ways mop up all of their oppo
nents.

The star of the Church team
is Joe Vahalas, whose kicking
and passing Coach Pete Kmeto
vic describes as "really some
thing."
Tribe Tough
But Kmetovic is pleased with
the way the Stanford team is
progressing, and expects to give
the Hawaiians all they can han
dle. He is especially pleased with
the play of Evans and Blaine
Nye. Dick Ragsdale, however is
injured and will not play.
Stanford's main weakness is a
lack of experienced backs. Few
of the Stanford players have
grown up with the game, as
have all of the members of the
Church squad.
Last week the Tribe rolled
over Oregon State 21-3. Evans
scored three tries and Nye domi
nated the line outs completely. If
these two can repeat their per
formances, and the Stanford
backs keep their cool, it should
be a jolly good show.

PARDON ME, BUT â€”This scene from last week's Stanford-Oregon
State match would seem to Indicate that rugby Is not the most
gentlemanly game In the world. Tomorrow, the Tribe takes on
Church College of Hawaii, a team of Polynesians who are among
the best in the world.
