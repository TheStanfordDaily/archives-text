est-ever freshmen battle a San
ta Clara squad loaded to the
veritable gills.

many Stanford swimmers, mus
cles up with Stanford NCAA
giant Greg Buckingham, multi

and Jamie Knorr will have to
hit a 1:48.1 pace to break the
record of 7:12.5 in the 800 free

mely, and Luis Nicolao broke
the American record in the 800
free relay with a 7:01.4 effort.
