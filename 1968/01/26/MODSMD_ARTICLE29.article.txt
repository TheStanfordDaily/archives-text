To the average. American,
born and raised on football, rug
by seems to be a rather inter
esting but totally incomprehen
sible pastime. If the sight of
l?rge groups of young men push
ing on each other and people
fumbling the ball on purpose
doesn't confuse the novice,
words such as "scrum," "in
touch," "fly half" and "knock
on" certainly will.
But fear not, unenlightened
ones, The Daily hereby offers
you enlightenment, in the form
of a simple discription of how
rugby is played.
Like Football, But...
Rugby is basically similar to
football in that one team (15
players) tries to advance the
ball to a goal line by running,
passing and kicking. A "touch
down" is called a try and scores
three points. A try is converted
by place-kicking the ball be
tween the goal posts for an ad
ditional 2 points.
The kick, however, is taken
from a line even with where the
try was scored. Thus, a try
scored between the posts is a
cinch to convert, but if the
runner tightropes along the side
line for his try, the kicker has
a long, difficult kick from the
edge of the field.
Another method of scoring is
the penalty kick (3 points). This
is also a place kick, and it is
awarded at the place where cer
tain penalties occur. One can
also get 3 points by drop kick
ing the ball through the goal
post during play, but this rarely
happens.
Position
The secret of the game is not
posession, as in football, but
field position. Possession means
nothing, because the rules re
quire a player to drop the ball
when he is tackled. Since there
is no blocking allowed, long
runs are very rare.
The best way to advance the
ball is by kicking, which can be
done at any time during the
game. It's smartest to kick the
ball into touch (i.e., out of
bounds). I you don't, the other

bloke will simply catch it and
kick it right back at you.
Line-Out
When the ball is kicked into
touch, a line-out follows at the
point which the ball went into
touch. This is something like a
jump ball, except it involves
15 or 20 players rather than 2.
One of the defensive players
stands in touch and tosses the
ball into the middle of 2 lines of
players. A massive melee ensues
for posession of the ball.
Scrum
Another way of putting the
ball into play (usually after
penalties) is the scrum. Eight
big, strong bodies on each team
lock arms in 3 rows (one behind
the other) and lower their heads
and push against the other team.
The ball is then placed in the
middle, and the object is to push
the other team off the ball and
then heel the ball backwards so
that the scrum-half can pick it
up and either run, kick, or pass
(no forward passes are allowed
—it's got to be backwards or a
sideways, lateral-type pass).
Hooker
The center man in the front
row is called the hooker, and his
job is to grab the ball with his
feet and heel it behind him.
Scrums can also form spon
taneously during play when the
ball is bouncing around. This is
called a loose scrum. The object
is still the same—push the other
guys away from the ball and
heel it back to the scrum half.
Penalties
The most common penalties
are off-side and knock-on. The
off-side rule requires that a
player, in order to touch a ball
kicked by a teammate, must be
behind the kicker when the ball
was kicked.
The knock-on rule makes it il
legal for a ball to bounce for
ward off the hands or body of
a player. It in effect prevents
sloppy ball handling.
Continuous Excitement
And that's it, basically. The
game is continuous, exciting and
action-filled. Stanford will play
tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. behind
the baseball diamond.
