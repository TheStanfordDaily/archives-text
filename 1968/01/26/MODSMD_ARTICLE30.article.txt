# Exhibition Game
## Chargers Challenge Tribe 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford returns to the hard
woods tomorrow night at 8 p.m.
with an exhibition game against
the Athletes-in-Action Chargers.

The Chargers will be the new
est and most unusual team to
make an appearance in the Stan
ford Pavilion this year. Affiliated
with the NCAA through mem
bership in the Basketball Fed
eration of the United States, the
Chargers play a gruelling barn
storming schedule against top
universities throughout the
country. The team is sponsored
by World Athletes in Action, a
division of the Campus Crusade
for Christ.
Coached by former University
of Alaska mentor Fred Crowell,
the team consists of former bas
ketball players from American
college campuses.
Wisconsin Star
Guard Ken Gustafson, scoring
leader at Wisconsin for three
years, paces the team in scoring
with 22 points per game. Gustaf
son receives fine support from
forwards Larry Tregoning and
Bill Westphal.
Tregoning, who captained the
1965 NCAA runner-up Michigan
squad that included Cazzie Rus
sell, is averaging 12 points per
game. Westphal, a former USC
star, is hitting at a 16-point clip
for the year.
The Chargers knocked off
their first six opponents, but
then ran into trouble against
the likes of Utah, Wichita State,
and Arizona State. Recently
they picked up hard-fought vic
tories over two West Coast
teams, a 75-73 squeaker
over Oregon, and an overtime
97-85 thriller over San Jose
State.
Kuchenbecker Out
Stanford will be without the
services of 6-6% soph center
Steve Kuchenbecker, who has
been suffering from a serious
bout with the flu.
"Kuchenbecker lost around 22
pounds," Coach Howie Dallmar
revealed yesterday. "He'll suit
up, but will not play."
Dallmar indicated that 6-5 jun
ior Mai McElwain would move
over from his forward spot to
take over the pivot. Sophomore
Chuck Moore would then as
sume the starting forward berth
vacated by McElwain.

The Tribe goes into tomorrow
night's contest with a 5-8 record,
while the Chargers will be try
ing for their tenth win against
seven losses.
"This is a good team," Dall
mar stated. "They're 9-7, and
they never play at home.
They've got a lot of real good
ballplayers."
With the forward spot weak
ened as a result of McElwain's
shift to center, Dallmar may
play ace guard Don Griffin up
front if the necessity presents
itself. The Tribe mentor also
indicated that high-schoring for
ward Art Harris may see action
in the backcourt.
The Chargers' barnstorming
schedule includes several speak
ing engagements as well as bas
ketball games. During the sea
son, members of the team will
be featured speakers at busi
ness and service clubs, and on
the campuses of competing uni
versities. At the game they will
be sharing their faith with those
present.
The activities of the Chargers
are only one facet of the minis
try of the Campus Crusade for
Christ International, a student
Christian movement on hun
dreds of campuses in the United
States. These basketball players
are part of an international staff
of approximately 1200, with
members in 36 countries around
the world.
