# Abernethy On Black Power
## 
### 
Professor David Abernethy of
the political science department
will give a short talk on the ra
cial crisis in the United States,
tonight at 8 in the Traneos
lounge.
The talk will be preceded by
a general membership meeting
of the Stanford Young Republi
cans at 7:30 p.m., but all interest
ed students are invited to at
tend Abernethy's talk. After 8
p.m., formal YR business will
not be discussed. Free beer will

be served.
Though Ahernethy's topic will
be "An Intelligent Conservative's
Guide to Black Power," YR
President Bob Clark pointed out
that the club is a "fair represen
tation of most sentiments of the
Party," not only the conservative
element.
A question and answer period
will follow Abernethy's talk. As
an extension of the topic, more
general racial issues will be dis
cussed to conclude the evening.
