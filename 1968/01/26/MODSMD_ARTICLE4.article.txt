# Research Cutback Will Hurt Stanford

### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Severe reductions in federal
grants and contracts for univer
sities have recently been or
dered, and Stanford could suffer
from the economy drive.
Total defense and space agen
cy spending for research at uni
versities is being cut back 20
per cent this year, the Associ
ated Press reported.
A week ago the Department
of Health, Education and Wel
fare (HEW) announced plans to
defer $208 million in spending
for campus construction. This
reduction resulted from Presi
dent Johnson's order last No
vember that all the Govern
ment's non-defense agencies cut
spending by 10 per cent.
In recent years Stanford has
received millions for research
from the Department of Defense
and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration
(NASA). These funds could be
affected by the cutback, accord
ing to Robert M. Rosenzweig, as
sociate provost.

In the fiscal year ended Aug.
31, Stanford spent $4,205,000 in
NASA contracts and grants and
$16,365,000 in Defense Depart
ment research money.
Nationwide, the Defense De
partment research support to
schools is dropping from $284
million in 1967 to $225 million
this year.
Contracts for projects the De
fense Department would contin
ue full tilt if it had the money
are either being slowed or short
ened.
"We'll have to wait and see
what the exact consequences
are," according to Raymond Bac
chetti, assistant provost.
The Associated Press reported
that a Government survey of 33
universities said "the cuts have
just not hit them yet but are
only beginning to be felt."
