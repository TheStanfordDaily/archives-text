# Research Cutback Will Hurt Stanford
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Severe reductions in federal
grants and contracts for univer
sities have recently been or
dered, and Stanford could suffer
from the economy drive.
Total defense and space agen
cy spending for research at uni
versities is being cut back 20
per cent this year, the Associ
ated Press reported.
A week ago the Department
of Health, Education and Wel
fare (HEW) announced plans to
defer $208 million in spending
for campus construction. This
reduction resulted from Presi
dent Johnson's order last No
vember that all the Govern
ment's non-defense agencies cut
spending by 10 per cent.
In recent years Stanford has
received millions for research
from the Department of Defense
and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration
(NASA). These funds could be
affected by the cutback, accord
ing to Robert M. Rosenzweig, as
sociate provost.

In the fiscal year ended Aug.
31, Stanford spent $4,205,000 in
NASA contracts and grants and
$16,365,000 in Defense Depart
ment research money.
Nationwide, the Defense De
partment research support to
schools is dropping from $284
million in 1967 to $225 million
this year.
Contracts for projects the De
fense Department would contin
ue full tilt if it had the money
are either being slowed or short
ened.
"We'll have to wait and see
what the exact consequences
are," according to Raymond Bac
chetti, assistant provost.
The Associated Press reported
that a Government survey of 33
universities said "the cuts have
just not hit them yet but are
only beginning to be felt."
Some Hiring Frozen
Faculty and staff hirings and
graduate enrollment have been
frozen at some science-oriented
schools which depend heavily on
DOD money, the AP said.
The Stanford Linear Accelera
tor Center has been severely af
fected by research spending cuts
of one kind or another, accord
ing to information officer Doug
las Dupen.
He said SLAC is "operating at
less than peak capacity because
of budgetary limitations . . . per
haps as much as 50 per cent un
der capacity."
The effect of the HEW fund
freeze can have serious conse
quences at Stanford for future
construction. Rosenzweig points
out that the graduate facilities
program of the Office of Educa
tion has been reduced from $60
million last year to $33 million
this year, with further shrink
age possible. Stanford has drawn
from this fund in the past.

As part of an overall spending
cut of $700 million this year,
HEW reduced the grants for
construction of undergraduate
facilities in California alone
from $33 million to $21 million
this year. Similar cutbacks will
occur in the graduate facilities
grants and in loans and scholar
ship money.
Stanford has only one build
ing application filed with HEW
at this time, according to Wil
liam McCammon of the control
ler's office. This is a $125,000
loan request for the new $4 mil
lion earth sciences building.
Two major renovation proj
ects, Jordan Hall and Encina
west wing, have already been
assured of HEW money after
some delay.
To McCammon and others, the
big worry is a long list of future
construction projects requiring

federal money to start on sched
ule.
Three Question Marks
"Three buildings will all be
ready to go at the same time,"
McCammon said. With HEW
grants disappearing, the pro
vost's office may have to decide
to push ahead with one and post
pone the others, McCammon
commented. He did not reveal
the projects.
Among other Stanford proj
ects vulnerable to a dry-up in
HEW money, the biggest is the
new law school. Groundbreaking
is scheduled for 1971, just south
of the post office.
Cost estimates have been
made for the law school, but
they may not be meaningful by
the time construction starts.
Barch''tti explained that con
struction costs rise about six per
cent each year, and every delay
"cost thousands of dollars" for
Stanford.
Uncertainty seems to plague
Stanford's planning. "We've
been told we'll be going through
this freeze as long as there's a
war," McCammon said.
Besides construction, HEW fi
nances extensive research at
Stanford. Public health service
grants totaled $11,326,000 in the
1967 fiscal year. Education office
grants were $2,933,000, and $154,-
000 went for vocational rehabili
tation.
