# Gardner Quits Cabinet Post
## 
### WALTER GRANT College Press Service 
WASHINGTON — Secretary
of Health, Education and Wel
fare John W. Gardner, who has
been considered one of educa
tion's closest friends, resigned
yesterday.
It was apparent, however, that
Gardner has no intention of
becoming the next president of
Stanford.
Trustee President W. Parmer
Fuller said that Gardner was
"an obvious candidate" for the
presidency, but said "from the
outset of our search . . . Gardner
made it clear he did not wish

to be a candidate for a univer
sity presidency.
"The Board of Trustees' com
mittee has respected this wish
and continues to do so."
Near the beginning of the
year, Gardner said in a tele
vised interview In Washing
ton that "I am not a candi
date," answering a question
specifically about the Stan
ford presidency.
Gardner told President John
son he plans to leave the posi
tion he has held for two and a
half years "on or before March
1." He said he plans to return
to the Carnegie Corporation of

New York as a consultant and
to undertake special projects re
lating to the problems of cities.
Gardner was president of Car
negie before his appointment to
the Cabinet position July 27,
1965.
In his letter of resignation
Gardner said, "When I came to
Washington I took a two-year
leave of absence from the Car
negie Corporation, and overstay
ed that leave half a year."
In a televised interview last
night, Gardner said the reasons
for his resignation "are not to
be found in any issue or incident
but a judgment as to where I
can be most useful."
However, Gardner reportedly
is quitting the Cabinet because
he is displeased with the severe
budget cuts in his department,
particularly in the area of ed
ucation. Gardner is also consid
ered a dove on Vietnam and re
portedly wants to disassociate
himself from the Johnson ad
ministration's foreign policy.
Gardner joins a growing list
of government officials who are
resigning. Many reportedly are
leaving the government because
of the heavy escalation of the

war and the resulting reduction
hi funds available for domestic
programs.
Neither Gardner's office nor
officials at Carnegie Corpora
tion would comment on the
possibility that he might stay
at Carnegie for only a short
time, and then assume the
presidency of a major college
or university.
An HEW official said, "He's
said he's going to Carnegie. I
assume he's going to Carnegie."
Gardner's office had no com
ment on his resignation. Officials
refused to confirm or deny that
he was leaving to protest the
war and the cuts in his operating
budget.
The official announcement of
the resignation came from the
White House, which released to
reporters copies of Gardner's
letter of resignation and a let
ter from President Johnson to
Gardner. The White House re
fused further comment and
would not say when a successoi
might be named.
President Johnson had lit
tle comment beyond the cus

totnary statement that he was
accepting the resignation with
"deep regret."
Education officials greeted
Gardner's resignation with re
gret, noting that he has been a
close friend to all levels of edu
cation, particularly higher edu
cation. Jack Morse of the Amer
ican Council on Education said,
"From his days at Carnegie he
has been regarded as one of
higher education's most knowl*
edgeable and articulate spokes
men. He has always been deep
ly interested and concerned
about the problems of educa
tion."

close friend to all levels of edu
cation, particularly higher edu
cation. Jack Morse of the Amer
ican Council on Education said,
"From his days at Carnegie he

edgeable and articulate spokes
men. He has always been deep

about the problems of educa
tion."
WASHINGTON — Secretary
of Health, Education and Wel
fare John W. Gardner, who has
been considered one of educa
tion's closest friends, resigned
yesterday.
It was apparent, however, that
Gardner has no intention of
becoming the next president of
Stanford.
Trustee President W. Parmer
Fuller said that Gardner was
"an obvious candidate" for the
presidency, but said "from the
outset of our search . . . Gardner
made it clear he did not wish

to be a candidate for a univer
sity presidency.
"The Board of Trustees' com
mittee has respected this wish
and continues to do so."
Near the beginning of the
year, Gardner said in a tele
vised interview In Washing
ton that "I am not a candi
date," answering a question
specifically about the Stan
ford presidency.
Gardner told President John
son he plans to leave the posi
tion he has held for two and a
half years "on or before March
1." He said he plans to return
to the Carnegie Corporation of

New York as a consultant and
to undertake special projects re
lating to the problems of cities.
Gardner was president of Car
negie before his appointment to
the Cabinet position July 27,
1965.
In his letter of resignation
Gardner said, "When I came to
Washington I took a two-year
leave of absence from the Car
negie Corporation, and overstay
ed that leave half a year."
In a televised interview last
night, Gardner said the reasons
for his resignation "are not to
be found in any issue or incident
but a judgment as to where I
can be most useful."
However, Gardner reportedly
is quitting the Cabinet because
he is displeased with the severe
budget cuts in his department,
particularly in the area of ed
ucation. Gardner is also consid
ered a dove on Vietnam and re
portedly wants to disassociate
himself from the Johnson ad
ministration's foreign policy.
Gardner joins a growing list
of government officials who are
resigning. Many reportedly are
leaving the government because
of the heavy escalation of the

war and the resulting reduction
hi funds available for domestic
programs.
Neither Gardner's office nor
officials at Carnegie Corpora
tion would comment on the
possibility that he might stay
at Carnegie for only a short
time, and then assume the
presidency of a major college
or university.
An HEW official said, "He's
said he's going to Carnegie. I
assume he's going to Carnegie."
Gardner's office had no com
ment on his resignation. Officials
refused to confirm or deny that
he was leaving to protest the
war and the cuts in his operating
budget.
The official announcement of
the resignation came from the
White House, which released to
reporters copies of Gardner's
letter of resignation and a let
ter from President Johnson to
Gardner. The White House re
fused further comment and
would not say when a successoi
might be named.
President Johnson had lit
tle comment beyond the cus

totnary statement that he was
accepting the resignation with
"deep regret."
