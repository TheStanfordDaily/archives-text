## Clifford: No Bomb Halt; Gets Committee Approval 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Clark
M. Clifford testified Thursday he
opposes any halt in the bombing
of North Vietnam until leaders
there demonstrate they will
cease attacks and intervention
in South Vietnam.
Clifford, the prospective new
secretary of defense, expressed
hope that North Vietnam forces
soon will learn that they can't
take over South Vietnam, and
that this will bring peace.
Saying he approves the way
the war has been fought in Viet
nam, he said U.S. and allied
forces already have "achieved a
type of victory" there.
He was responding to ques
tions at a hearing on his nomi

nation to succeed Robert S. Mc-
Namara in the defense post.
After hearing Clifford, the
Senate Armed Services Commit
tee voted unanimous approval of
the selection. The Senate will be
asked to confirm his nomination
next week.
