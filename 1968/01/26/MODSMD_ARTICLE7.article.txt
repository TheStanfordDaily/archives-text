###

soon will learn that they can't
take over South Vietnam, and
that this will bring peace.
Saying he approves the way
the war has been fought in Viet

forces already have "achieved a
type of victory" there.
He was responding to ques
tions at a hearing on his nomi

Namara in the defense post.
After hearing Clifford, the
Senate Armed Services Commit
tee voted unanimous approval of
the selection. The Senate will be
asked to confirm his nomination
next week.

Friday.
Lance Cpl. Stoven D. Nelson,

under heavy bombing attacks,
shelled the Khe Sanh air strip
Thursday in an effort to cut
down the flow of supplies and
reinforcements to the embat
tled U.S. 26th Marine Regiment.

no bargarining sessions were

The San Francisco Printing

• tSeiv Sicily Quake
PALERMO, Sicily (AP)—An
other crippling earthquake shot
through western Sicily on
Thursday, bringing more death
and ruin to this island 10 days
after its worst quake disaster in
60 years.
The new, violent trembler
killed at least seven persons and
injured 55 in the same impover
ished, hilly region where an
earthquake Jan. 15 claimed at
least 224 lives.
Some rescue workers were
crushed as they picked through
mountains of debris for bodies.
Buildings swayed and crumbled
in towns relatively untouched
in the earlier disaster.
The western tip of the island
again became a nightmarish
landscape of panic and chaos.
Soon afterward, a rainstorm
swept the island, bogging down
relief squads that had just re
turned to an emergency footing.
At least 30 aftershocks rippled
through the area.
• Mideast Fighting

Democratic leaders had failed
to include Negroes and Mexi
can-Americans on the committee

Sen. Mervyn M. Dymally,
whose district includes the
Watts district of Los Angeles,
sent a telegram to the Demo
cratic National Committee ob
jecting to the makeup of the 12-
select members of the pro-
Johnson national convention del
egation in the June presidential

The delegation headed by
Atty. Gen. Thomas C. Lynch

• Unruh Hits Back
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Dem
ocratic Assembly Speaker James
M. Unruh said Thursday he
doesn't mind Republican criti
cism if it diverts GOP attacks
from targets such as poor peo

• Stock Take Big Dip
NEW YORK (AP)—The stock
market was battered by selling
in typical war-scare fashion
Thursday but recovered late in
the day, registering gains in
some averages even though los
ers outnumbered gainers in the
list as a whole. Trading was
heavy.
After 12 straight losses In the
Dow Jones industrial average,
the market was staging a tech
nical rally in the morning de
spite deep public concern about
the North Korean seizure of the
U.S. Navy intelligence ship, Pu
eblo.
The rally was technical, based
on the relative cheapness of
many stocks after the long re
treat. News that President John
son, responding to the Pueblo
crisis, had called up certain
Navy and Air Force reservists
and planes, triggered a tidal
wave of selling. The market
gain was quickly erased and
prices declined on a broad front.

• tSeiv Sicily Quake
PALERMO, Sicily (AP)—An
other crippling earthquake shot
through western Sicily on
Thursday, bringing more death
and ruin to this island 10 days
after its worst quake disaster in
60 years.
The new, violent trembler
killed at least seven persons and
injured 55 in the same impover

earthquake Jan. 15 claimed at
least 224 lives.
Some rescue workers were
crushed as they picked through
mountains of debris for bodies.
Buildings swayed and crumbled
in towns relatively untouched

The western tip of the island
again became a nightmarish

Soon afterward, a rainstorm
swept the island, bogging down
relief squads that had just re
turned to an emergency footing.
At least 30 aftershocks rippled
through the area.

• Stock Take Big Dip
NEW YORK (AP)—The stock
market was battered by selling
in typical war-scare fashion
Thursday but recovered late in

some averages even though los

After 12 straight losses In the

the market was staging a tech

• tSeiv Sicily Quake
PALERMO, Sicily (AP)—An
other crippling earthquake shot
through western Sicily on
Thursday, bringing more death
and ruin to this island 10 days
after its worst quake disaster in
60 years.
The new, violent trembler
killed at least seven persons and
injured 55 in the same impover
ished, hilly region where an
earthquake Jan. 15 claimed at
least 224 lives.
Some rescue workers were
crushed as they picked through
mountains of debris for bodies.
Buildings swayed and crumbled
in towns relatively untouched
in the earlier disaster.
The western tip of the island
again became a nightmarish
landscape of panic and chaos.
Soon afterward, a rainstorm
swept the island, bogging down
relief squads that had just re
turned to an emergency footing.
At least 30 aftershocks rippled
through the area.

• Stock Take Big Dip
NEW YORK (AP)—The stock
market was battered by selling
in typical war-scare fashion
Thursday but recovered late in
the day, registering gains in
some averages even though los

list as a whole. Trading was
heavy.
After 12 straight losses In the
Dow Jones industrial average,
the market was staging a tech
nical rally in the morning de
spite deep public concern about
the North Korean seizure of the
U.S. Navy intelligence ship, Pu
eblo.
The rally was technical, based
on the relative cheapness of
many stocks after the long re
treat. News that President John
son, responding to the Pueblo
crisis, had called up certain
Navy and Air Force reservists
and planes, triggered a tidal
wave of selling. The market
gain was quickly erased and
prices declined on a broad front.

take over South Vietnam, and

He was responding to ques

After hearing Clifford, the

• Stock Take Big Dip
NEW YORK (AP)—The stock
market was battered by selling
in typical war-scare fashion
Thursday but recovered late in
the day, registering gains in
some averages even though los

list as a whole. Trading was
heavy.
After 12 straight losses In the
Dow Jones industrial average,
the market was staging a tech
nical rally in the morning de
spite deep public concern about
the North Korean seizure of the
U.S. Navy intelligence ship, Pu
eblo.
The rally was technical, based
on the relative cheapness of
many stocks after the long re

son, responding to the Pueblo
crisis, had called up certain
Navy and Air Force reservists
and planes, triggered a tidal
wave of selling. The market
gain was quickly erased and
prices declined on a broad front.

• Stock Take Big Dip
NEW YORK (AP)—The stock
market was battered by selling
in typical war-scare fashion
Thursday but recovered late in
the day, registering gains in
some averages even though los
ers outnumbered gainers in the
list as a whole. Trading was
heavy.
After 12 straight losses In the
Dow Jones industrial average,
the market was staging a tech
nical rally in the morning de
spite deep public concern about
the North Korean seizure of the
U.S. Navy intelligence ship, Pu
eblo.
The rally was technical, based
on the relative cheapness of
many stocks after the long re
treat. News that President John
son, responding to the Pueblo
crisis, had called up certain
Navy and Air Force reservists
and planes, triggered a tidal
wave of selling. The market
gain was quickly erased and
prices declined on a broad front.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Clark

take over South Vietnam, and

forces already have "achieved a
type of victory" there.
He was responding to ques

After hearing Clifford, the

tee voted unanimous approval of
the selection. The Senate will be

PALERMO, Sicily (AP)—An
other crippling earthquake shot
through western Sicily on
Thursday, bringing more death
and ruin to this island 10 days
after its worst quake disaster in
60 years.
The new, violent trembler
killed at least seven persons and
injured 55 in the same impover
ished, hilly region where an
earthquake Jan. 15 claimed at
least 224 lives.
Some rescue workers were
crushed as they picked through
mountains of debris for bodies.
Buildings swayed and crumbled
in towns relatively untouched
in the earlier disaster.
The western tip of the island
again became a nightmarish

Soon afterward, a rainstorm
swept the island, bogging down
relief squads that had just re
turned to an emergency footing.
At least 30 aftershocks rippled
through the area.
