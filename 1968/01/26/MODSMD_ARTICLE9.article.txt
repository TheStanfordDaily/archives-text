# Evolving And Involving On The Road To Greatness
## 
### 
Today Stanford stands a little closer to the
proverbial edge of greatness. Her struggle has
brought her from a mediocre western private
university to the top of university rankings.
The growing strength of faculty, academic
programs, and yes, buildings too, has brought
Stanford recognition as one of the top three
graduate schools in the nation. At the under
graduate and graduate levels, the humanities
and social sciences are growing to share recog
nition with the engineering and sciences.
One of the key factors in this development
has been Stanford's willingness to undertake
new and experimental programs. President Ster
ling brought the medical center to Palo Alto
early in his presidential career in one of the bold
est moves. Stanford has committed itself to an
overseas program more extensive than that of
any other American university. Despite cries of
academic rigidity, the flexibility of the academic
program has allowed students to initiate and re
ceive credit for almost any course they desire.
Only recently undergraduate specials and inter
departmental major programs have been ex
panded as Stanford introduces more and more
flexibility into its undergraduate education.
However, in other areas, Stanford has been
slow and can hardly be praised for its innova
tion. Freedom of worship was not allowed on
campus until last year and it still exists only on a
"trial" basis. The freedom granted to political
organizations, and other special interest groups
has been snowballed for much of Stanford's his
tory.
Rut the importance of innovation is now more
broadly recognized, as reflected in the Study of
Education. Sincc its inception, the SES has had
as one of its major goals the institutionalizing of
reform mechanisms for the university.

And innovation is vital to greatness. Greatness
is not a stable commodity to be achieved just by
the calculated fulfillment of certain quotas of
professors, courses, and buildings. It is as much
and more a spirit and a willingness of the univer
sity to involve and evolve itself. The University
must involve itself with its students, their prob
lems, and their concerns. The University must
evolve itself in the pursuit of the always chang
ing vision of the students, faculty, and society.
To adhere to any one vision would be stagnating.
Cries to go slow because of financial infeasi
bility or impracticality might be valid at a par
ticular time, but despite their validity, they can
not be allowed to be the final answer. Stanford
is already seen by too many as rich, large, dis
tinguished, but not really great.
Stanford must face several key problems in its
pursuit of greatness:
(1) the first is to find a balance between the
Wilsonian ideal of a university, of "remoteness
and withdrawal from the contemporary scene,"
and the ideal of energetic and committed in
volvement demanded by more active elements.
(2) the second problem is to define academic
freedom for a generation that questions whole
sale the long-accepted principles and values
which have formulated our governmental and
civil laws. Does academic freedom allow Dean
Rusk to appear on campus but not Ho Chi
Minh? Does academic freedom protect the LSD
users on campus, but not the CIA?
The problems are evolving just as the defini
tion of a great university is evolving. How Stan
ford evolves and involves itself to seek new an
swers to these problems today, tomorrow, and
next year will determine whether Stanford can
be numbered among the great universities in
the years to come.

Minh? Does academic freedom protect the LSD
users on campus, but not the CIA?
The problems are evolving just as the defini
tion of a great university is evolving. How Stan
ford evolves and involves itself to seek new an
swers to these problems today, tomorrow, and
next year will determine whether Stanford can
be numbered among the great universities in
the years to come.
Today Stanford stands a little closer to the
proverbial edge of greatness. Her struggle has
brought her from a mediocre western private
university to the top of university rankings.
The growing strength of faculty, academic
programs, and yes, buildings too, has brought
Stanford recognition as one of the top three
graduate schools in the nation. At the under
graduate and graduate levels, the humanities
and social sciences are growing to share recog
nition with the engineering and sciences.
One of the key factors in this development
has been Stanford's willingness to undertake
new and experimental programs. President Ster
ling brought the medical center to Palo Alto
early in his presidential career in one of the bold
est moves. Stanford has committed itself to an
overseas program more extensive than that of
any other American university. Despite cries of
academic rigidity, the flexibility of the academic
program has allowed students to initiate and re
ceive credit for almost any course they desire.
Only recently undergraduate specials and inter
departmental major programs have been ex
panded as Stanford introduces more and more
flexibility into its undergraduate education.
However, in other areas, Stanford has been
slow and can hardly be praised for its innova
tion. Freedom of worship was not allowed on
campus until last year and it still exists only on a
"trial" basis. The freedom granted to political
organizations, and other special interest groups
has been snowballed for much of Stanford's his
tory.
Rut the importance of innovation is now more
broadly recognized, as reflected in the Study of
Education. Sincc its inception, the SES has had
as one of its major goals the institutionalizing of
reform mechanisms for the university.

And innovation is vital to greatness. Greatness
is not a stable commodity to be achieved just by
the calculated fulfillment of certain quotas of
professors, courses, and buildings. It is as much
and more a spirit and a willingness of the univer
sity to involve and evolve itself. The University
must involve itself with its students, their prob
lems, and their concerns. The University must
evolve itself in the pursuit of the always chang
ing vision of the students, faculty, and society.
To adhere to any one vision would be stagnating.
Cries to go slow because of financial infeasi
bility or impracticality might be valid at a par
ticular time, but despite their validity, they can
not be allowed to be the final answer. Stanford
is already seen by too many as rich, large, dis
tinguished, but not really great.
Stanford must face several key problems in its
pursuit of greatness:
(1) the first is to find a balance between the
Wilsonian ideal of a university, of "remoteness
and withdrawal from the contemporary scene,"
and the ideal of energetic and committed in
volvement demanded by more active elements.
(2) the second problem is to define academic
freedom for a generation that questions whole
sale the long-accepted principles and values
which have formulated our governmental and
civil laws. Does academic freedom allow Dean
Rusk to appear on campus but not Ho Chi
Minh? Does academic freedom protect the LSD
users on campus, but not the CIA?
