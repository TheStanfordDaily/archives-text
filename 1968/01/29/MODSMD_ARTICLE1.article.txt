# 'Debaters' Attempt To Define Terms Of Civil Disobedience
## 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
A lawyer and a theologian at
tempted to define the circum
stances under which violation
of the law can be justified dur
ing a public discussion held in
Memorial Church last night.
Although the event was billed
as a debate, both John C Ben
nett, president of Union Theo
logical Seminary and Prof. How
ard Williams of the Stanford
law school pointed out that they
did not really disagree about
"Civil Disobedience, Law and Or
der, and the Draft"
Williams maintained that a
persor. must consider such fac
tors as the magnitude of the in
justice which he wants to resist
the hopelessness of other rem
edies, and the purity of his own
motivse before breaking a law.
Civil disobedience must be
weighed carefully, said Wll-

Hams, because one illegal act
can lead to another. He said
that the Sproul Hall disturban
ces at Berkeley resulted in part
from the activities of the crvil
rights movement, and that such
incidents contributed to the
Watts riot.
When someone does commit
an illegal act, he must be ready
to "put his skin on the line,"
Williams said.
The subject of civil disobedi
ence, he continued, is either to
obtain a constitutional test for
a law or to call public attention
to it. In either case, the dissen
ter must, be prepared tc be ar
rested, tried and punished.
On these grounds, WDflams
defended the recent arrest of
Dr. Benjamin Spock and Tale
theologian William Sloan Cof
fin Jr., who have been accused
of hi hhii a ting young men who

resist the draft
Bennett implicitely supported
the actions of Spock and Coffin.
Aid for those who have already
decided to resist the draft can
be justified, he said. But he did
not approve of any attempt to
persuade people to refuse induc
tion.
Concerning the war itself,
Bennett said that it was prob
ably legal but not "prudent" for
our government to send people
to "kill and die" in Vietnam. He
cited the fact that about 40 per
cent of the American people op
pose the present administration
on the war issue.
Concerning the legality of our
involvement in Vietnam, Wil
liams said that the only way to
test it would be for a draftee to
refuse to fight, be court-mar
tialled, and hope that the case
would reach the Supreme Court
