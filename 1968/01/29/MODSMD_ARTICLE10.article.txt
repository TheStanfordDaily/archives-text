# On Cooling It
## 
### 
To paraphrase Dean Rusk, we strongly advise the United
States to "cool it" in the North Korean crisis.
Under the old diplomatic conventions a ship was some
thing worth fighting for. It isn't any more. And if the Presi
dent had shown he knew that, we probably would have had
the Pueblo and her crew back by now.
Our involvement in Vietnam has shown that our inter
national prestige is not always enhanced by a show of force.
In the Korean crisis to show restraint is to show strength.
Apparently the President has taken advantage of the inci
dent to call up reserves needed for the Vietnam conflict.
There has even been speculation that the whole crisis was
manufactured. In any case the call-up was totally out of pro
portion to the situation.
We cannot go on calling up troops at the slightest prov
ocation of insignificant nations. To continue overreacting
like we have in this situation would soon make it necessary
to convert the economy to a wartime footing for racier
trivial reasons.
It is important for our government to decide what our
objectives are in the present crisis. Do we want to protect
the captured crewmen? Do we want the ship back? Do we
want to maintain peace or do we want to defend our inter
national prestige?
Hawks in Congress seem to want the ship more than
peace or prestige. We believe that the most important ob
jective now is the maintenance of peace.
The President's call-up of reservists must be weighed in
light of his decision to take the matter to the United Na
tions. The move is perhaps futile since North Korea is not
a member, but it bespeaks a desire for peace on Johnson's
part that some of us had forgotten to expect. Now the Presi
dent should continue his diplomatic, not military, efforts to
find ways to get the ship and crew home.
Nothing justifies war; violence is justified only as a des
perate last resort in a fight for self-preservation. Johnson has
forgotten this in Vietnam. We hope he will remember it in
Korea.
