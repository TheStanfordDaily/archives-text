## Man's Savings Amazes IRS 
### Art Buchwald 
When Emil Harwood Booster
paid his taxes for 1967, he dis
covered that he still had $117.50
left over in' his bank account.
It probably would have been
overlooked but he made the mis
take of bragging to a friend in
a bar about and he was over
heard by an Internal Revenue
Service agent who reported it to
his chief.
An emergency meeting was
called of federal, state, county
and city tax officials to discover
why Booster still had money
left in the bank.
The IRS man said Booster's
federal tax return had been
checked and it was all in order,
so he couldn't be tried for any
criminal violations. The state
tax official said as far as his
people could find out, Booster
had paid all state taxes. The

county man said his records
showed that Booster was clean,
and the city man said the same
thing.
"Then," the IRS man said, "we
can only come to one conclusion.
If Booster still has money left
over after he has paid his taxes,
there is a loophole somewhere
in the tax law."
"Wait a minute." said the
county tax collector. "If anyone
should get the $117.50, it's the
county. It would be very easy
for us to raise Booster's real
estate taxes."
"I object," said the city's rep
resentative. "It seems to me that
the reason Booster got away
with this is that our sales tax
has been too low. We can up the
sales tax by 1%, make it retro
active and inform Booster he
owes us the $117.50.

There was a lot of angry
shouting and finally the IRS man
called the meeting to oilier.
"Hold it. Shouting will do us
no good. Let's look at this thing
calmly. The way I see it, we
are not as concerned about the
$117.50 as we are about the fact
that Booster still had money left
over after he paid his taxes.
"Now we'll all have to admit
that this is a very bad precedent
and, If Booster can get away
with it, everyone else will try
to get away with it. We must
discover what went wrong and
see that it doesn't happen again."
"I'll tell you where it went
wrong," the state man said. "We
thought the President was go
ing to put a surcharge of 10%
on everyone's income tax, so
we didn't tax Booster the way
we originally planned to."

"And," said the county man,
"we thought the state was go
ing to raise Booster's gasoline
taxes, so we didn't raise his
water and sewer taxes."
The city man said, "And we
thought the county was going
to put on a liquor and cigarette
tax, so we thought we would
pass up an entertainment tax
until next year."
The IRS man said, "It seems
to be a comedy of errors, and
the only one who is laughing
right now is Booster.
"The solution to the problem,
as I see it, is to set up a co-ordi
nating committee and in 1968
tax Booster an extra $117.50
which he failed to pay 1967. We
could split the $117.50 among
all of us so Booster would have
no idea what we were doing."
"It's not a bad idea," the state
man said. "But I think there
should be some punitive damages
added.
"It's true that Booster didn't
violate any laws, but he knew
as well as we did that if he had
any money at the end of the
year, it belonged to one of us."
"That's true," the county man
said. "He should have come
clean and told us he still had
money left in the bank and then
let us adjust our tax rates ac
cordingly."
"I say give it to the Grand
Jury," the city man said. "Any
guy who has any money left
over after he pays his taxes has
got to be guilty of something."
Everyone agreed and the IRS
man said, "It's guys like Booster
who give inflation a bad name."

the reason Booster got away
with this is that our sales tax
has been too low. We can up the
sales tax by 1%, make it retro
active and inform Booster he
owes us the $117.50.

There was a lot of angry
shouting and finally the IRS man
called the meeting to oilier.
"Hold it. Shouting will do us
no good. Let's look at this thing
calmly. The way I see it, we
are not as concerned about the
$117.50 as we are about the fact
that Booster still had money left
over after he paid his taxes.
"Now we'll all have to admit
that this is a very bad precedent
and, If Booster can get away
with it, everyone else will try
to get away with it. We must
discover what went wrong and
see that it doesn't happen again."
"I'll tell you where it went
wrong," the state man said. "We
thought the President was go
ing to put a surcharge of 10%
on everyone's income tax, so
we didn't tax Booster the way
we originally planned to."

"And," said the county man,
"we thought the state was go
ing to raise Booster's gasoline
taxes, so we didn't raise his
water and sewer taxes."
The city man said, "And we
thought the county was going
to put on a liquor and cigarette
tax, so we thought we would
pass up an entertainment tax
until next year."
The IRS man said, "It seems
to be a comedy of errors, and
the only one who is laughing
right now is Booster.
"The solution to the problem,
as I see it, is to set up a co-ordi
nating committee and in 1968
tax Booster an extra $117.50
which he failed to pay 1967. We
could split the $117.50 among
all of us so Booster would have
no idea what we were doing."
"It's not a bad idea," the state
man said. "But I think there
should be some punitive damages
added.
"It's true that Booster didn't
violate any laws, but he knew
as well as we did that if he had
any money at the end of the
year, it belonged to one of us."
"That's true," the county man
said. "He should have come
clean and told us he still had
money left in the bank and then
let us adjust our tax rates ac
cordingly."
"I say give it to the Grand
Jury," the city man said. "Any
guy who has any money left
over after he pays his taxes has
got to be guilty of something."
Everyone agreed and the IRS

When Emil Harwood Booster
paid his taxes for 1967, he dis
covered that he still had $117.50
left over in' his bank account.
It probably would have been
overlooked but he made the mis
take of bragging to a friend in
a bar about and he was over
heard by an Internal Revenue
Service agent who reported it to
his chief.
An emergency meeting was
called of federal, state, county
and city tax officials to discover
why Booster still had money
left in the bank.
The IRS man said Booster's
federal tax return had been
checked and it was all in order,
so he couldn't be tried for any
criminal violations. The state
tax official said as far as his
people could find out, Booster
had paid all state taxes. The

county man said his records
showed that Booster was clean,
and the city man said the same
thing.
"Then," the IRS man said, "we
can only come to one conclusion.
If Booster still has money left
over after he has paid his taxes,
there is a loophole somewhere
in the tax law."
"Wait a minute." said the
county tax collector. "If anyone
should get the $117.50, it's the
county. It would be very easy
for us to raise Booster's real
estate taxes."
"I object," said the city's rep
resentative. "It seems to me that
the reason Booster got away

to be a comedy of errors, and
the only one who is laughing
right now is Booster.
"The solution to the problem,
as I see it, is to set up a co-ordi
nating committee and in 1968
tax Booster an extra $117.50
which he failed to pay 1967. We
could split the $117.50 among
all of us so Booster would have
no idea what we were doing."
"It's not a bad idea," the state
man said. "But I think there
should be some punitive damages
added.
"It's true that Booster didn't
violate any laws, but he knew
as well as we did that if he had
any money at the end of the
year, it belonged to one of us."
"That's true," the county man
said. "He should have come
clean and told us he still had
money left in the bank and then
let us adjust our tax rates ac
cordingly."
"I say give it to the Grand
Jury," the city man said. "Any
guy who has any money left
over after he pays his taxes has
got to be guilty of something."
Everyone agreed and the IRS
man said, "It's guys like Booster
who give inflation a bad name."
