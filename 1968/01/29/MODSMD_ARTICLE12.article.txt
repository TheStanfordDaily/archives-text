## Do Outfitted Cops Need Guns? 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
Eliot Ness rode again at the
Stoney Brook campus of the
State University of New York
last week. Two hundred cops,
armed with shotguns, surround
ed the school and rounded up
scores of pot-smokers and other
dangerous drug addicts.
The incident provided photog
raphers with a chance to take
pictures of bearded degenerates
in their natural habitat, and en
abled Newsweek to leer at the
fact that girls were found in
several men's rooms.
There is no use arguing about
pot. Most Californians are al
ready experts on that subject.
There is no use telling News
week that finding a girl in a
man's room might mean some
thing different that it did in the
good ol' raccoon coat and Stutz
Bearcat days.
But there Is a good reason
to talk about those shotguns.
The issue is not as far away
from Stanford as Stoney Brook.
The University police right here
in Pleasant Valley go about
their business armed with pis
tols.
Who are they planning to
shoot? Certainly these men can
conceive of hypothetical cases in
which they may need their
weapons.
But this is a university com

munity. Is any situation likely
to occur here which could justi
fy taking someone's life?
There is no doubt that we live
in a violent society. Lots of peo
ple have guns, and they use
them frequently. Our President's
brains were blown out on a city
street.
But why should the proce
dures of this society be ex
tended to the university cam
pus where people are pre
sumably looking for a better
way to live?
Not long ago I was given a
ticket for backing into a park
ing space. The desk man at the
Stanford Police Station ex
plained to me that I had vio
lated a regulation intended to
protect the shrubbery from ex
haust fumes.
The officer who gave me this
ticket was carrying a gun. If his
function is to protect the shrub
bery, why does he need a gun?
Can I expect a .38 slug between
my eyes the next time I step on
the ivy?
Actually the guns are just
part of a cop's wardrobe which
includes boots, a leather jacket,
a helmet, and sometimes a mo
torcycle. The effect of this get
up is to make a Stanford police

man indistinguishable from his
brethren in Oakland. Are our
police also stocking up on Mace?
I would not recommend that
we take away the University's
shiney red fire engines. But the
motorcyles, the squad cars and
the "I'm a real cop" uniforms
may not be as necessary as they
seem. And, for heaven's sake,
let's get rid of those guns.
