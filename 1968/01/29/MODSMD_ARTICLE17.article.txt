## LBJ Considers Rusk's 'Jive'

"My strong: advice to the
North Koreans Ls to cool it" —
Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
Jan. 24.
Cool it?
Did the honorable Secretary
Rusk mean to imply the North
Korean government should use
the utmost restraint in respond
ing to United States precautions
following the Pueblo incident?
Please, Mr. Secretary, speak

your own language. Like, do
your thing. You dig?
Perhaps Rusk's venture into
the diction of the young was a
calculated attempt to change
his staid, shopworn image. Or
perhaps Rusk saw the expres
sion "cool it" in Time magazine
and assumed it was respectable,
not knowing Time used it in a
calculated attempt to change its
staid, shopworn image.

Whatever Rusk's motives,
such semantic slips will only
confuse the old, bemuse the
young, and terrify state depart
ment press officers.
But with a widening credibi
lity gap, the Administration is
apt to try anything to rescue its
plummeting popularity. Rusk's
hip talk could have been a trial
balloon for the President's next
press conference. Imagine a
flustered George Christian giv
ing Johnson a quick cram ses
sion on an amalgam of Negro
jive, Pepsi generation, Haight-
Ashbury, and Quotations from
Chairman Mac) Tse-tung.
Suitably clad in faded dunga
rees, sandals and sweatshirt,
with unshaven face and uncomb
ed gray hair reaching down to
his rimless glasses, Johnson
shuffles into the press confer
ence.
Policy Change
The first reporter to recover
from a state of shock ventures
a question.
Reporter: "Mr. President, does
your unusual attire imply a
change of policy regarding draft
protestors?"
Johnson: "Man, I'm just
changin' my scene. Like, why go
around all dressed up like a Un
ion Jack? Up-tight clothes mess
up your mind. We got to relate
and be real."
Reporter: "Do you mean the
Administration is taking a fresh
look at the world? What stance
will you take toward the new
anti-riot bill in Congress which
would institute an 8 p.m. cur
few in ghettos and make loiter
ing a capital offense?"

•Johnson: "Them spade cats
got to cool it and love all the
People, especially honkies. Ain't
no man wants to get busted, and
makin' the scene at night in the
street .is no way to keep clean.
We're going to persuade our
soul brothers to stay in their
homes after 8 o'clock and do
their thing, except nobody bet
ter blow grass, drop acid or
take speed because the Great
Society protects its People
against bad trips, and we got
a whole barracks of peace-lov
ing narcs to help enforce com
pliance. , . . er, I mean, bring
love and understanding."
Bread For Colleges
Reporter: "Perhaps you are
considering a diversion of funds
from the war budget to aid high
er education?"
Johnson: "Man, we give more
bread to colleges already than
the Gross National Products of
all African countries combined!
The Republicans are hung-up on
money — I mean, they don't
groove on the mere spirit of in
quiry. Federal aid to universities
has got to show a five per cent
return on investment else
Everett Dirksen gets super up
tight. There's just no way to
give universities more, unless
they make the research scene
with electronic psychedelics for
our peace-loving fighter bombers
in Vietnam."
Reporter: "Speaking of Viet
nam, Mr. President, is there a
chance of any pause in the
bombing of the North?"
Johnson: "Man, we're gonna
blow their minds."
