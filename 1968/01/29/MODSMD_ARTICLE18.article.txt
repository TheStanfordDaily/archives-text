# Letters To The Editor
## Review Overestimates Systems Analysis Role 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Although I do not know if
this past issue (Jan. 26) of the
daily magazine was the most
popular, I found it to be the
most interesting. I am some
what familiar with the subjects
of the two lead stories and feel
that the review of the Report
from Iron Mountain . . . requires
no comment.
The two most unsatisfactory
aspects of the review are its
inconsistencies and the author's
willingness to accept the OSD
line about the book and the study
group being the products of an
enterprising author's mind.
Certain small errors of fact
and omission are also bother
some to the reader: Iron Moun
tain is not the first satire on
systems analysis (ask any of
several economics "summer in
terns"); systems analysis un
happily does not have the poli
tical supremacy ascribed to it;
and it certainly is not "value
free," however that may be de
fined.
Analysis In War
The war in South-East Asia
is a bad and unfortunate epi
sode, but the review has con
fused it with war in general. The
current war may be an "efficient
misuse of technology and the
most brilliantly organized abor
tion" (of the set of all abortions,
perhaps?), but this does not
necessarily mean that systems
analysis is bad in and of itself.
Possibly the analysts or the
decision-makers leave something
to be desired, but I see no rea
son for condemning this analytic
calculus. Some have learned es
sentially the same tools under
the name of capital budgeting,
and that has not been blamed
for any wars.
What distresses me the most
is the description of the sup
posedly unbreachable gap be

tween those who observe what
needs to be done and those who
are able to correct the situation
followed by a cry for more ser
ious thought about peace.
While the review chooses to
consider this gap, historian Schle
singer, astronomer Clarke, and
the other members of the study
group obviously have given
thought to peace.

are able to correct the situation
followed by a cry for more ser
ious thought about peace.
While the review chooses to
consider this gap, historian Schle
singer, astronomer Clarke, and
the other members of the study
group obviously have given
thought to peace.

Although I do not know if
this past issue (Jan. 26) of the
daily magazine was the most
popular, I found it to be the
most interesting. I am some
what familiar with the subjects
of the two lead stories and feel
that the review of the Report
from Iron Mountain . . . requires
no comment.
The two most unsatisfactory
aspects of the review are its
inconsistencies and the author's
willingness to accept the OSD
line about the book and the study
group being the products of an
enterprising author's mind.
Certain small errors of fact
and omission are also bother
some to the reader: Iron Moun
tain is not the first satire on
systems analysis (ask any of
several economics "summer in
terns"); systems analysis un
happily does not have the poli
tical supremacy ascribed to it;
and it certainly is not "value
free," however that may be de
fined.
Analysis In War
The war in South-East Asia
is a bad and unfortunate epi
sode, but the review has con
fused it with war in general. The
current war may be an "efficient
misuse of technology and the
most brilliantly organized abor
tion" (of the set of all abortions,
perhaps?), but this does not
necessarily mean that systems
analysis is bad in and of itself.
Possibly the analysts or the
decision-makers leave something
to be desired, but I see no rea
son for condemning this analytic
calculus. Some have learned es
sentially the same tools under
the name of capital budgeting,
and that has not been blamed
for any wars.
What distresses me the most
is the description of the sup
posedly unbreachable gap be

tween those who observe what
needs to be done and those who
are able to correct the situation
followed by a cry for more ser
ious thought about peace.
While the review chooses to
consider this gap, historian Schle
singer, astronomer Clarke, and
the other members of the study
group obviously have given
thought to peace.
