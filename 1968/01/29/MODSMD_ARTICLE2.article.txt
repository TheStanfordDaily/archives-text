# Panel Debates Rush
## Selectivity: Barrier Or Boon? 
### NICK SELBY 
Does selective rush increase
community within a living
group?
"I would have to say it does,
much in the same way that any
natural disaster increases com
munity among the people af
fected," says Political Science
Professor Sidney Verba.
A fraternity man comments,
"Selective rush answers only
this question: is the rushee will
ing to participate in the house
and add to its compatibility? We
feel selective rush answers this
question to the benefit of the
house."
Bat, are there negative fac
tors in the selection process
which outweigh all benefits of
prearranging a group with

"I have seen students return
to Wilbur after being rejected
with their egos completely de
flated. They are then willing to
accept the next available descrip
tion of themselves â€” turkey.
Selective rush is not worth it,"
answers Jon Trimbur, former
sponsor and chairman of the
ASSU housing commission last
year.
On the other hand, a frater
nity advocate counters, "Stu
dents enjoy the "being wanted*
feeling that they have when
they receive a bid card. Also,
maybe the rejection and ego de
flation helps certain individuals
grow up."
These questions and answers,
central to every debate on the
merits of selective rush, high
lighted a discussion Thursday

night at Delta Chi on selectivity
in university residences.
The direct opposition of the
answers reflects the concern of
various people on campus, a
concern which increases in in
tensity every year with the start
of the rush period.
The history of selective rush
in the last two years at Stan
ford indicates that the concern
originated solely with the cri
tics*. Breakers eating club be
came the first living group to
abolish selectivity in favor of
a draw system in February 1966.
Beta Chi fraternity followed
in October 1966, and El Capi
tan eating club became the third
living group to adopt a draw
system in Rebruary, 1967. El
Capitan President David Mich
ell said at the time, "We did

not like playing junior gods,"
while selecting future members.
Verba, who to * member of
Stanford (SES) subcommittee
on aithwraity residences, rais
ed a second criticism of the
"junior gods" selection proc
"Besides hurting certain in
dividuals, it results in the crea
tion of a prematurely homo
genous community. The range
of experiences for rushees is
narrowed at a time in their col
lege lives when it should be
expanding widely," he said.
"The university is an import
ant switching point in life, and
horizons should not be limited by
a selection process which seeks
to eliminate conflict within a
living group," Verba concluded.
One problem with discussions
on selectivity is that they al
ways concern not only the se
lection process, but also the
general philosophy of living
groups.
Trimbur's comments Thursday
night illustrated this point: "Ba
sic individual growth results
from conflict of viewpoints. Ran
dom placement in Wilbur, for
example, forces people to adapt
to create a viable living group."
However, a fraternity advo
cate challenged Trimbur's state
ments, saying that under ran
dom selection people don't feel
the obligation to contribute or
to know every one.
Several Delta Chi members
stated that selective rush does
not necessarily mean there will
be no Intellectual conflict, and
added that such intellectual con
flict becomes more possible when
there is an obligation to make

the living group succeed. They
said selective rush creates this
obligation.
Critics of rush at the dis
cussion maintained that the
open house atmosphere forc
ed a freshman to try to im
pres house members, while fra
ternity spokesmen complained
that they felt pressure in hav
ing to constantly evaluate each
rushee in the space of a mo
ment's meeting.
"It bothers me that this per
sonal judgement can prevail
without embarrassment," com
mented Bill Leland, Stern Hall
director and chairman of the
housing questionnaire commit
tee.
A Delta Chi active answered
that he did have this right, be
cause he was a house member
and part owner of the building.
Another fraternity man argued
that as long as the rushee par
ticipated in the rush process, he
was tacitly acknowledging the
house's right to choose its mem
bers.
Associate Dean of Students
Willard Wyman focused on the
crux of the discussion just be
fore its conclusion. "Who should
decide whether selective rush is
to be allowed at Stanford?" he
asked. Some students argued
that if enough people wanted
selective living groups, then se
lectivity should be allowed.
The discussion reached no
agreement as to the correct ans
wer. "It's almost impossible to
reach any consensus at discus
sions like this because the con
versation jumps from point to
point," Dean Williams said af
terward. "But they do help to
open everyone's mind and keep
us all thinking."
