## Selectivity: Barrier Or Boon? 
### NICK SELBY 
Does selective rush increase
community within a living
group?
"I would have to say it does,
much in the same way that any
natural disaster increases com
munity among the people af
fected," says Political Science
Professor Sidney Verba.
A fraternity man comments,
"Selective rush answers only
this question: is the rushee will
