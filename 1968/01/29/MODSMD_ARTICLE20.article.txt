## Security Is A Warm Campus 
### Kirk Hanson 
Old editors never die, they
just become columnists. But
writing as a columnist is very
different, in many ways less
secure than writing as editor.
Gone is the strength of the
larger editorial typeface, the
dignity of unsigned excellence,
th€ feeling that one can pontifi
cate with less than the firmest
of footing. Writing from a posi
tion of insecurity would seem to
make one more intense, more
rigorous, more sure of his state
ments.
This healthy insecurity is
something most Stanford under
graduates do not experience. In
the last three years of report
ing about the Stanford student,
I have wanted to define exactly
"who" he is. Though each year's
class comes from myriad states
and backgrounds, something can
be said of the typical Stanford
student.

The word that seems to best
describe him is "secure." Statis
tical studies show him to be
from a generally wealthy back
ground. He has done exception
ally well in high school, usually
in academics and in the extra
curricular activities that insure
that he has become "confident,
well-poised and socially at ease.
Though he goes through a

trauma or two freshman year,
he finds his way in the univers
ity environment. He fits in well,
rolls with the punches, and by
the end of the freshman year,
can say that he is a member of
this fraternity or that coeduca
tional house. This is his identity
and he can relax with it. He is
secure in the warmth of the uni
versity's protective womb, its
overseas campuses and special
seminars.
Established Game
Pleasant coffee houses, fire
sides, and dances are planned
for him. For "meaning" all he
does is venture to a local girl's
dorm and start up one of the
established patterns of relation
ships laid out for him. He either
plays the stud, taking out a
frosh dollie, or he plays the bit
best described as "relating", i.e.
those who have rejected the
"dating game" for something
they call relating, but they only
succeed in playing another sort
of game. But it is secure and
established.
He really doesn't have to wor
ry about what happens at Stan
ford, for no matter how he does,
he will have enough decent
grades for some graduate
school. He will get his start on
a career to bring him enough
money to be comfortable later.

What else does he want? What
reason is there to be anything
but secure?
No Concern
What the Stanford student is
not is rigorous. Rarely is he ex
cited about anything he is do
ing. Rarely is he vitally con
cerned with anything but his
own comfort, which is virtually
assured, and so there is noth
ing to be concerned about. And
rarely does he get involved.
This lack of commitment and
lack of concern can have tre
mendous impact upon a society
created by Stanford students. It
certainly says something about
the society that they have cre
ated amongst themselves now.
Too often it is a cold, person
less, and game playing atmo
sphere—but the perfection of
the broader society outside.
If Stanford is serious about
wanting to serve society and
humanity, it better give its stu
dents some greater hope of cre
ating that new society. The first
step must be the alteration of
admissions policies so that we
are not deluged each fall by
these secure, relaxed, confident,
and competent individuals with
out an ounce of rigor in their
souls. Prototypes be damned,
but we need more fanatics.
Hmmm, maybe pontificating
has become a way of life.

What the Stanford student is
not is rigorous. Rarely is he ex
cited about anything he is do
ing. Rarely is he vitally con
cerned with anything but his
own comfort, which is virtually
assured, and so there is noth
ing to be concerned about. And
rarely does he get involved.
This lack of commitment and
lack of concern can have tre
mendous impact upon a society
created by Stanford students. It
certainly says something about
the society that they have cre
ated amongst themselves now.
Too often it is a cold, person
less, and game playing atmo
sphere—but the perfection of
the broader society outside.
If Stanford is serious about
wanting to serve society and
humanity, it better give its stu
dents some greater hope of cre
ating that new society. The first
step must be the alteration of
admissions policies so that we
are not deluged each fall by
these secure, relaxed, confident,
and competent individuals with
out an ounce of rigor in their
souls. Prototypes be damned,
but we need more fanatics.
Hmmm, maybe pontificating
has become a way of life.
Old editors never die, they
just become columnists. But
writing as a columnist is very
different, in many ways less
secure than writing as editor.
Gone is the strength of the
larger editorial typeface, the
dignity of unsigned excellence,
th€ feeling that one can pontifi
cate with less than the firmest
of footing. Writing from a posi
tion of insecurity would seem to
make one more intense, more
rigorous, more sure of his state
ments.
This healthy insecurity is
something most Stanford under
graduates do not experience. In
the last three years of report
ing about the Stanford student,
I have wanted to define exactly
"who" he is. Though each year's
class comes from myriad states
and backgrounds, something can
be said of the typical Stanford
student.

The word that seems to best
describe him is "secure." Statis
tical studies show him to be
from a generally wealthy back
ground. He has done exception
ally well in high school, usually
in academics and in the extra
curricular activities that insure
that he has become "confident,
well-poised and socially at ease.
Though he goes through a

trauma or two freshman year,
he finds his way in the univers
ity environment. He fits in well,
rolls with the punches, and by
the end of the freshman year,
can say that he is a member of
this fraternity or that coeduca
tional house. This is his identity
and he can relax with it. He is
secure in the warmth of the uni
versity's protective womb, its
overseas campuses and special
seminars.
Established Game
Pleasant coffee houses, fire
sides, and dances are planned
for him. For "meaning" all he
does is venture to a local girl's
dorm and start up one of the
established patterns of relation
ships laid out for him. He either
plays the stud, taking out a
frosh dollie, or he plays the bit
best described as "relating", i.e.
those who have rejected the
"dating game" for something
they call relating, but they only
succeed in playing another sort
of game. But it is secure and
established.
He really doesn't have to wor
ry about what happens at Stan
ford, for no matter how he does,
he will have enough decent
grades for some graduate
school. He will get his start on
a career to bring him enough
money to be comfortable later.

What else does he want? What
reason is there to be anything
but secure?
