## Political Rightsâ€”An Obituary 
### ROBERT SPANNER 
it is inconsistent ior tne iid
eral or the conservative to be
unhappy with the sorry state of
American society. He created it.
The left may indict the con
servative for his refusal to
march into battle and make war
on poverty, and the right may
assail the liberal for his disin
clination to march into battle
and make war on men. But both
liberal and conservative are in
substantial agreement as to
what constitutes legitimate
means.
Liberal and conservative have
joined philosophical forces. They
are making a mockery of the
concept of inalienable rights. The
State giveth and the State
taketh away. And whosoever
among you shall not believe, ye
shall be jailed.
Statists of either bent adopt
a common technique in order
to silence criticism. To chal
lenge means Ls to impugn ob
jectives, they declare. If you
object to the draft, you're
pink; if you protest against
burgeoning welfare programs,
you're rotten.
This is not to say that the lib
eral or the conservative is moti
vated by any but the most bene
volent ends. For example, Gen
eral Hershey is genuinely be
wildered by the anger and hatred
that accompanies the letter
which begins so ominously:
"Greetings from the President,
you are hereby instructed . . . "
And when William Rusher,
editor of National Review, spoke
here recently, he stated that he

could not understand how any
one could object to two years
of service in defense of the
United States.
Or take as another example,
Secretary of Defense McNamara,
who, concerned about the in
equities of the draft and the
level of poverty, proposed that
everyone be forced to serve in
some capacity.
The Negro militants who in
cited riots, and the congress
men who demand more, and
more, and still more taxes to
fund their welfare proposals,
and yet are never satisfied,
they too are motivated by a
desire to make the world a bet
ter place in which to live.
And it is they, and the Her
shey's and Rushers and Mac-
Namaras, who make life intol
erable.
These men suffer from the
;ame basic premise: that men
oelong to them by majority
vote. "How much of what a
man has earned shall we allow
him to keep?" they ask them
selves. "Lots," say the conserva
:ives. "Not so lots," say the lib
erals. 'Toward what goals shall
we allocate lives?" they wond
er. "To fight communism," the
conservatives say. "To fight pov
erty," the liberals say.
The liberal and the conserva
tive fight over men the way
jackals fight over a piece of
meat.
They have a tremendous
penchant for setting other
people's goals for them, and
enforcing those goals by law.
But even more do these men

exhibit a preference for mea
sures in which they can get
something for nothing.
The conservative calls for an
offering to the State when he
supports the draft. The public
applauds. The student who has
to go is cynical, hostile.
The liberal calls for an ob
lation to Society when he sup
ports a new welfare measure.
The public, which has to pay, is
cynical, hostile. The student ap
plauds.
What goes on here?

Or take as another example,
Secretary of Defense McNamara,
who, concerned about the in
equities of the draft and the
level of poverty, proposed that
everyone be forced to serve in
some capacity.
The Negro militants who in
cited riots, and the congress
men who demand more, and
more, and still more taxes to
fund their welfare proposals,
and yet are never satisfied,
they too are motivated by a
desire to make the world a bet
ter place in which to live.
And it is they, and the Her
shey's and Rushers and Mac-
Namaras, who make life intol
erable.
These men suffer from the
;ame basic premise: that men
oelong to them by majority
vote. "How much of what a
man has earned shall we allow
him to keep?" they ask them
selves. "Lots," say the conserva
:ives. "Not so lots," say the lib
erals. 'Toward what goals shall
we allocate lives?" they wond
er. "To fight communism," the
conservatives say. "To fight pov
erty," the liberals say.
The liberal and the conserva
tive fight over men the way
jackals fight over a piece of
meat.
They have a tremendous
penchant for setting other
people's goals for them, and
enforcing those goals by law.
But even more do these men

exhibit a preference for mea
sures in which they can get
something for nothing.
The conservative calls for an
offering to the State when he
supports the draft. The public
applauds. The student who has
to go is cynical, hostile.
The liberal calls for an ob
lation to Society when he sup
ports a new welfare measure.
The public, which has to pay, is
cynical, hostile. The student ap
plauds.
What goes on here?
it is inconsistent ior tne iid
eral or the conservative to be
unhappy with the sorry state of
American society. He created it.
The left may indict the con
servative for his refusal to
march into battle and make war
on poverty, and the right may
assail the liberal for his disin
clination to march into battle
and make war on men. But both
liberal and conservative are in
substantial agreement as to
what constitutes legitimate
means.
Liberal and conservative have
joined philosophical forces. They
are making a mockery of the
concept of inalienable rights. The
State giveth and the State
taketh away. And whosoever
among you shall not believe, ye
shall be jailed.
Statists of either bent adopt
a common technique in order
to silence criticism. To chal
lenge means Ls to impugn ob
jectives, they declare. If you
object to the draft, you're
pink; if you protest against
burgeoning welfare programs,
you're rotten.
This is not to say that the lib
eral or the conservative is moti
vated by any but the most bene
volent ends. For example, Gen
eral Hershey is genuinely be
wildered by the anger and hatred
that accompanies the letter
which begins so ominously:
"Greetings from the President,
you are hereby instructed . . . "
And when William Rusher,
editor of National Review, spoke
here recently, he stated that he

could not understand how any
one could object to two years
of service in defense of the
United States.
