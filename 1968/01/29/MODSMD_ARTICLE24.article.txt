# Symphony Review
## Krips Returns In Style 
### BRUCE MERRY 
After a truly sensational read
ing of Brahms' Piano Concerto
No. 2 at Foothill the night be
fore — a performance that pit
ted the stern insight of Claudio
Arrau against the conductor's
own mellow strength — Josef
Krips brought the San Francisco
Symphony to Stanford on Sat
urday.
Krips brings always to his
Beethoven a jocund and refresh
ing sensuousness, an ability to
underplay and underscore, rath
er than to assault and detonate
in the manner of a Von Karajon
or sometimes even of a Klemp
erer.
Here is a conductor who has
Vienna written all over his ample
paunch and chubby features. He
feels Beethoven; he adores Bee
thoven, smiling and teasing his
orchestra through Beethoven
with the hilarity of a precocious

cherub. He conducted without a
score, using his waist and neck
no less than his baton.
He opened "Beethoven night"
with a marvellously delicate and
persuasive Leonore No. 3. Every
one knows and loves the climatic
theme of this darkling concert
piece, yet Krips' revelation of its
unhurried climb to the final for
tissimos was a delight to the
sensitive ear.
The Leonore was followed by
a performance of the 4th Sym
phony which, though probably
inadequately rehearsed after the
musicians' recent strike, was as
mellow and lyrical as you could
ask for. Like the other "even
number symphonies," the 4th
has tended to be relegated by
critics to a less dynamic status
than, say, the 3rd, sth and 9th.
Krips, however, steered an even
course between drama and piece
de salon, giving us a symphony

that was precise, poetic and se
date.
The excessive length of the
Eroica led Beethoven to stipulate
that it be played toward the be
ginning of concert programs. An
easy canon to disobey, Beetho
ven's grandiose vision of this
work has nevertheless persisted
in its sobriquet.
One or two trumpet passages
were somewhat awkward in the
Scherzo, and Saturday night's
horn playing did not always have
that crispness of tone which is
desirable when the instrument
is to soar above Beethovenian
strings. What was significant
throughout Krips' concert was
the supreme relaxation with
which he floated in his string and
wind cues. The first violin entry
in the Adagio of the 4th Sym
phony is an excellent case in
point: this vitally beautiful cue
seemed to materialize from a
soundless zone somewhere be
yond the conductor's baton.
It was a moving concert, done
in the grand manner. Nijinsky,
leaning heavily on the arm of
his grand-niece, was seen to
leave the Stanford area in a
Rolls Royce Silver Wraith. It
is one of the very rare appear
ances which the ghostly old
dancer makes nowadays; he too
was visibly moved by Krips'
Eroica.
