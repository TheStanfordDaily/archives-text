# Records Tumble
## Santa Clara Defeats Swimmers 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Pouring rain, a touch of thun
der, and a hail of broken records
set the stage for the Santa
Clara Swim Club to win the
annual Stanford Relays Satur
day. Stanford's freshmen stole
two NCAA frosh relay records
from Yale, and in addition four
pool records and three meet
records crashed on the deck.
Santa Clara picked up 70
points to beat the Stanford vars
ity's 64. The frosh finished third
with 52 ahead of Foothill Aqua
tic Club with 44.
Friday afternoon, Foothill AC
capitalized on some temporary
holes in the Stanford lineup to

nip the frosh 58-54 and take the
varsity down to the last relay
before losing 61-52 in the double
dual meet-
In the Relays, the Papooses
hit 3:33.4 in the 400 medley re
lay to edge Yale's 3:33.8 record.
The frosh didn't piddle with the
800 free relay, burying the Yale
record of 7:12.5 six seconds un
der with a 7:06.9.
The medley relay race be
tween Santa Clara and the frosh
highlighted the soggy relays.
Fred Haywood led off for the
frosh with a pool record 53.8
backstroke leg, moving half a
body length ahead of Ray Riv
ero. Then Santa Clara's Brian

Job, the hottest thing in high
school breaststroke since the
butterfly stroke, took over the
lead with a 1:00.3 leg. Kenn
Terry hit a personal best of 1;.
01.4 for the frosh.
Ferris Evens It
John Ferris chewed up the
Santa Clara lead with a red-hot
50.8 butterfly leg to catch Greg
Buckingham, no slouch at 51.5.
Gary Ilmari, who earned two
gold medals on world record
freestyle relays at the Olympics,
hit 47.1 on the anchor leg to
touch out freshman Bob Jami
son.
Santa Clara won In 3:33.2, a
new pool record. The frosh had
to settle for second place and
an NCAA frosh record at 3:33.4.
The 800 free relay was a three
team race. Buckingham led off
for Santa Clara in a pool record
1:43.7, giving the Santa Clarans
a two body length lead over
Haywood of the frosh (1:45.8)
and Luis Nicolao of the varsity
(1:46.1).
Brent Berk and Jamie Knorr

of the frosh and Mike Wall and
Pete Siebert of the varsity each
threw in l:47's to catch Santa
Clara going into the anchor leg.
Ferris wailed to a 1:45.4 to hold
off Santa Clara's Ilman and
Dick Roth of the varsity and
cinch the record.
Buckingham, Haywood, Nico
lao, and Ferris' times represent
the fastest four 200 freestyles
in the country so far this sea
son.
The Stanford varsity flew to
a meet record 1:27.0 in the mini
sprint 200 freestyle relay. Diver
Bill Main led off in 22.3 followed
by Jeff Hammett (21.5), Morgan
Manning (21.7), and Ken Ham
mer (21.5).
No Spitz
There were a few noticeable
absences in the Relays. Mark
Spitz, who holds about every
butterfly record in the book,
could not swim for Santa Clara.
Cal was intimidated by a few
gentle Berkeley snow flurries
and decided to roll over and go
back to sleep. San Jose State
brought two divers.
