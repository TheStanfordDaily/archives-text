### BOB RUND 
Stanford's Tom Massey, shed
ding his football jersey for a
track suit, grabbed second and
fourth place finishes in Friday
night's Athens Invitational track
meet in Oakland arena. Massey
cleared 6'B" in the high jump to
take the runner-up spot behind
Oregon State's amazing Dick
Fosbury, who cleared 7'o" going
over the bar backwards. Both
defeated National AAU champi
on Ed Caruthers who was off
his usual form.
Massey hopped, stepped, and
jumped 48'10" for his fourth
place finish in the triple jump.
Charlie Cratg of Pacific Coast
Club was the winner with
51'2K".
Tipton Surprises
Another Tribe runner, Rick
Tipton, continued to bring joy to
the hearts of his coaches. Three
weeks ago Rick ran 7.4 for the
high hurdles by beating NCAA
champ Ron Copeland of UCLA,
but failed to make the finals.
This time Tipton took second
in his heat and then came back
in the final to hurdle to fourth
place ahead of last year's NCAA
runner-up Terry Fredericks of
Arizona in 7.3. Rick is only a
freshman.
The winner was Earl, The
Pearl, McCulloch of USC in a
near world record. McCulloch's
time of 6.9 was the best indoor

time in the world since 1964
when Hayes Jones set the record
of 6.8.
Ward Fourth
Stanford's Jim Ward battled
his way to a fourth place finish
in an elbow swinging race in
the 500 yard dash. Cal's Larry
Hengl was the winner in 57.5.
Rapidly improving Greg Brock
failed to place despite running
his lifetime best against a world
class field. Brock crossed the
finish line with a 14:01 clocking.
Tracy Smith, the world record
holder, outkicked Van Nelson In
the meet's best race. Smith, run
ning his last mile in a phenom
enal 4:18, broke the tape only
five seconds off his own world
record with a 13:21.9.
