## Conference Dumps On Gold 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
The usefulness of gold as the
basis of the international mone
tary system was questioned at
the Conference on International
Monetary Problems here Fri
day.
Sponsored by the Graduate
Economics Society, the Confer
ence featured papers presented
by Professors Abba of
Berkeley and Lorie Tarshis, ex
ecutive head of Stanford's eco
nomics department.
The papers were followed by
a panel discussion with Ernest
Olson, staff economist of the
Federal Reserve Bank in San
Francisco, -?everal Stanford pro
fessors and Lerner.
Most of the participants
adopted the position that gold
at one time served a useful pur
pose in facilitating international
exchange but that present poli
cies to maintain the gold sys
tem only hinder international
exchange.
In his paper Lerner advocated
the establishment of a dollar
standard for world trade with
the exchange rates determined

by market action. Such arrange
ment would be known as a
'floating* exchange rate.
The Berkeley professor went
on to say other countries should
determine their own exchange
rates, opting for either the
stable or the floating rate. He
suggested that most of the de
veloped countries should adopt
the floating rate, but that it
would be a matter of self-de
termination.
Addressing himself to the role
of the United States as world
banker, he mentioned the view
that, in serving this role, the
U.S. greatly benefitted by hav
ing other countries use our
currency as a reserve.
Later, however. Lerner ex
plained that while the U.S.
would gain from the arrange
ment, other countries would
also benefit. Any offset to the
gain of the U.S. was what were
referred to as "costs of inter
mediation."
As a solution to the gold prob
lem. Lerner suggested that the
United States refuse to buy any

more gold and allow the present
stocks to be depleted as foreign
countries cash in their dollars.
When the gold stock is elimin
ated the dollar would very likely
become the basis for the in
ternational monetary system.
Tarshis. in his paper, attacked
the balance-of-payments "defi
cit." saying that "the measure
we employ would be appropriate
to an economy that was primar
ily a trader ; we have an equally
important role as the world's
banker and the measure we em
ploy gives us a faulty diag
nosis."
"We have no baiance-of-pay
ments problem as the phrase is
normally understood. We are
applying wrong remedies for a
disease we don't have and our
policies are inflicting great dam
age on us and most of the rest
of the world"
He went on to say that pres
ent monetary policies "are al
ready slowing down economic
growth in most countries,
threatening depression in some
policies are inflicting great dam
age on us and most of the rest
of the world."
"We should be lending and
investing abroad when worth
while opportunities present
themselves. Admittedly, this will
mean a whittling away of our
gold reserves, but we should
welcome this because it'll allow
us to get something—highly pro
ductive assets abroad — for
almost nothing—gold."
"When our gold reserves have
melted away, we still have no
cause for alarm. Major foreign
economies cannot allow the dol
lar to fall in price, vis-a-vis their
own currencies. Such a step
would permit too much dollar
competition in various markets.
They're bound to support the
dollar."
Several novel proposals were
voiced in the afternoon panel
discussion. Prof. Edward Shaw
of Stanford proposed giving our
gold to the underdeveloped
countries as a sort of new Mar
shall Plan.
In order to improve their
economies these countries would
sell their gold to those Western
European countries in return
for goods. The European coun
tries would then have a substan
tial gold stock, the economies
of the underdeveloped countries
would be improved, and the U.S.
would no longer have a gold
problem.
Prof. Ronald McKinnon
brought up the point that there
is often a rather large lag be
tween academic discussions and
policy implementations.
Prof. George Bach of the
Graduate School of Business
noted the "sweet reasonable
ness" of Lemer's paper. The
only trouble, Bach noted, was
that while Lemer could con
vince many economists with his
reasoning, it was an entirely
different matter to persuade
governments to implement pro
posals.
Olson emphasized that gold
should be thought of in other
than monetary terms. There is a
growing demand, he noted, for
gold in industrial areas. How
ever, if the U.S. stopped paying

out gold its price would prob
ably fall.
The effect of this situation is
that instead of gold supporting
the dollar, the dollar is actually
supporting gold, he said.
