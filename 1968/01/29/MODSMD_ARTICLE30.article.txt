# Ruggers Out-Slosh CCH For Waterlogged 6-3 Win
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
A determined Stanford rugby
squad fought back from a three
point halftime deficit and de
feated highly-regarded Church
College of Hawaii, 6-3, to bright
en a dreary, drizzly Saturday af
ternoon.
The Indians, playing their first
game of the year on a wet field,
started slowly, and were com
pletely outclassed by the Hawai
ians in the first half.
CCH controlled the scrums
early and, except for a long run
by Tim Abena and a towering
kick into touch by Leon Hart
vickson, Stanford found itself
struggling deep in its own terri
tory most of the time.
Two Missed Chances
But the Hawaiians, perhaps
longing for some island sun
shine, missed two makeable pen
alty kicks and managed only a
single try in the first period.
Stanford went into the prover
bial locker room trailing only
3-0.
The weather which had been
threatening for hours finally
broke as the whistle started the
second half. Amidst a driving
rainstorm and occasional hail
stones, the Tribe found their
footing and began to dig in.

Hartvickson tied the scorr
with a beautiful penalty kick
from just inside the 40 yard line
midway in the second half. Con
sidering the slippery, waterlog
ged ball and the windy down
pour, Hartvickson's effort was
nothing of magnificent.
This tying score was the turn
ing point of the match, and the
inspired Tribe took charge the
rest of the way.
SutclllTe lees The Cake
Hartvickson missed another
penalty kick from about the
same spot with 15 minutes left,
but a few moments later Eric
Sutcliffe cut inside on a sweep
and outraced a couple of CCH
backs to score the go-ahead try,
bringing the score to 6-3.
The Tribe then controlled the
game the rest of the way and
held on for a very sweet victory.
The weather played no small
part in the outcome. CCH's quick
backs had a tough time hanging
onto the very slippery ball and
found the footing a bit dodgey.
Forester Shines
The rain apparently didn't
bother Stanford Fullback Mike
Forester. The shaggy â€¢ haired
freshman seemed to have glue
on his fingers and cannons in
his feet as he time and again
handled slippery, squiggley balls '

and boomed them into touch,
forcing the Hawaiians back into
their own territory.
Although the weather did
dampen the skins of the spec
tators, their spirits were left
untouched. The crowd, bolstered
by a sizeable and wildly enthu
siastic Polynesian contingent,
stayed until the very end. They
got more than their money's
worth.
