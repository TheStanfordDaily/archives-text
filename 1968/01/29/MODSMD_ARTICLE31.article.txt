# Indian Running Game Scuttles Tall Athletes-In-Action, 94-83
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford's fast-break nearly
blew the Athletes-in-Action off
the court Saturday night, as the
Tribe blazed to a 94-83 victory
in the Pavilion.
The victory, which snapped a
three-game losing streak, upped
the Indians' overall record to
6-8.
Guard Gary Petcrsmeyer and
forward Art Harris repeatedly
streaked downcourt for uncon
tested layups off the break, as
Stanford utilized a pronounced
speed advantage to break the
game open. Pivotman Mai Mc-
Elwain keyed the Indian attack
with 13 rebounds and some fine
outlet passing, in addition to 15
points.
Chargers Lead
The Chargers held a four to
six-point lead throughout the
first ten minutes of play, but
the tide turned once the Stan
ford break started rolling.
An eight-point outburst mid
way through the first half
erased the Charger advantage
and put Stanford on top 26-22.
Guard Don Griffin netted two
free throws and a breakaway
layup, while Harris and Mc-
Elwain scored on uncontested
drives.
Minutes later the Tribe took
a 10-point lead on three straight
buckets off the break, two by
the diminutive Petersmeyer and
one by Harris. Charger coach
Fred Crowell quickly called a
time out to regroup his forces.
Sophomore Chuck Moore bur
ied two jumpers shortly before
the intermission to give the In
dians a 49-35 edge at halftime.
Alley Oop Hoop
The lead mushroomed to 17 in
the opening minutes of the sec
ond half, as Harris meshed
three baseline drives and fired
a spectacular alley-oop pass to
Petersmeyer for another Indian
hoop.
The following six minutes
saw the Tribe lead trimmed to
six, as the Indians could only
tally five points. Charger guard
Dwayne Brewer funneled nine
points during that span, as the
visitors narrowed it to 65-59.
Indians Revive
The Indians seemed to be fad
ing fast, but Petersmeyer came
to the rescue. The fiery back
court ace threaded 13 points in
the final eight minutes of the

game, as Stanford regained the
whip hand.
Harris led the scoring parade
with 24 points, closely followed
by Petersmeyer's 23. McElwain,
who switched over from for
ward to replace an ill Steve
Kuchenbecker, followed with 15,
and Griffin had 10. Brewer led
the Chargers with 17, but netted
only 8 of 23 field-goal attempts.
Stanford's fast-break was re
sponsible for no less than 13
layups, and this undoubtedly
contributed to an impressive 53
percent shooting mark. The In
dians were also deadly from the
foul stripe, where they con
verted 20 of 23 attempts.
The Chargers, plagued by a
tenacious Tribe defense which
forced numerous turnovers and
hurried shots, connected on only

39 percent of their attempts
from the floor. Missed free
throws also hurt the visitors, as
they shot only 60 percent from
the line.

Stanford's fast-break nearly
blew the Athletes-in-Action off
the court Saturday night, as the
Tribe blazed to a 94-83 victory
in the Pavilion.
The victory, which snapped a
three-game losing streak, upped
the Indians' overall record to
6-8.
Guard Gary Petcrsmeyer and
forward Art Harris repeatedly
streaked downcourt for uncon
tested layups off the break, as
Stanford utilized a pronounced
speed advantage to break the
game open. Pivotman Mai Mc-
Elwain keyed the Indian attack
with 13 rebounds and some fine
outlet passing, in addition to 15
points.
Chargers Lead
The Chargers held a four to
six-point lead throughout the
first ten minutes of play, but
the tide turned once the Stan
ford break started rolling.
An eight-point outburst mid
way through the first half
erased the Charger advantage
and put Stanford on top 26-22.
Guard Don Griffin netted two
free throws and a breakaway
layup, while Harris and Mc-
Elwain scored on uncontested
drives.
Minutes later the Tribe took
a 10-point lead on three straight
buckets off the break, two by
the diminutive Petersmeyer and
one by Harris. Charger coach
Fred Crowell quickly called a
time out to regroup his forces.
Sophomore Chuck Moore bur
ied two jumpers shortly before
the intermission to give the In
dians a 49-35 edge at halftime.
Alley Oop Hoop
The lead mushroomed to 17 in
the opening minutes of the sec
ond half, as Harris meshed
three baseline drives and fired
a spectacular alley-oop pass to
Petersmeyer for another Indian
hoop.
The following six minutes
saw the Tribe lead trimmed to
six, as the Indians could only
tally five points. Charger guard
Dwayne Brewer funneled nine
points during that span, as the
visitors narrowed it to 65-59.
Indians Revive
The Indians seemed to be fad
ing fast, but Petersmeyer came
to the rescue. The fiery back
court ace threaded 13 points in
the final eight minutes of the

game, as Stanford regained the
whip hand.
Harris led the scoring parade
with 24 points, closely followed
by Petersmeyer's 23. McElwain,
who switched over from for
ward to replace an ill Steve
Kuchenbecker, followed with 15,
and Griffin had 10. Brewer led
the Chargers with 17, but netted
only 8 of 23 field-goal attempts.
Stanford's fast-break was re
sponsible for no less than 13
layups, and this undoubtedly
contributed to an impressive 53
percent shooting mark. The In
dians were also deadly from the
foul stripe, where they con
verted 20 of 23 attempts.
