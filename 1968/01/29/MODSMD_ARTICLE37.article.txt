# Cystic Fibrosis Sufferers Aided By Student Invention
## 
### 
Two mechanicai engineering
students are developing a
"thumping-vibrating" machine
to take over from nurses some
of the tiring and expensive
physical therapy now applied to
cystic fibrosis patients.
William H. Boies of San
Carlos and Jerrold C. Manock
of Los Angeles are attemping
to produce a machine for "per
cussion drainage therapy," a
process which cam be usee to
extend the lifespan of cystic fi
brosis sufferers. This therapy is
now given as many as four
times daily with each treatment
lasting 30 minutes.
Cystic fibrosis, an inherited
disease, afflicts children. In
the past it has proved fatal
before the end of their teens.
The disease is marked by a
continuous release of thick
ened mucus which becomes
lodged in the lungs.
If net removed by coughing,
the mucus reduces the efficiency
of the lungs, in turn reducing
the patient's resistance to such
diseases as pneumonia. Percus
sion drainage therapy, applied
to the back and chest, loosens

the mucus and helps the chil
dren expel it.
Nurses at the Children's Con
valescent Hospital are enthus
iastic about the machine. The
device consists of a five-pound
package containing a solenoid
and vibrating coil which applies
foam rubber-cushioned thumps
and vibrations of varying
strengths and frequencies. A
small console housing the elec
tric controls allows the ther
apist to adjust the intensity of
the treatments.
The two students hope to
"provide a unit within the
purchasing range of an aver
age family so that this optim
ized treatment can be dupii
rated in the home by parents
or by the child himself."
To aid parents in use of the
device at home, Boles and Man
ock have added a T-shirt for the
patient with places marked for
applying the machine properly.
A final touch was a jumping
barking toy dog which could be
plugged into the console and
controlled by the child during
the treatment.
While the device has met with
enthusiasm from doctors and

parents, the students consider it
a preliminary model and will
build an improved unit in the
near future. Among other
things, they say it can be made
much lighter, quieter and elec
tronically simpler, thus reduc
ing the overall cost.
