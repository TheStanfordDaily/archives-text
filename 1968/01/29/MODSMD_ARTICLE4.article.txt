SEOUL, Korea (AP) â€”South
Korea rejected Monday the pos
sibility of trading North Korean
infiltrators captured in the
South for the American intelli
gence ship Pueblo and its crew.
A foreign ministry spokesman
said the idea is "outrageous and
nonsensical." Spokesmen for
South Korea's two major politi
cal parties said such an ex
change is "out of the question."
The possibility of the swap
was raised in New Delhi, first
by Soviet sources and then by a
spokesman for the North Ko
rean diplomatic mission to In
dia. Meanwhile, U-S. troops beat
off North Korean raids on
American outposts along the Ko
rean armistice line over the
weekend and early Monday.
Fail To Infiltrate
A U.S. military spokesman
said four North Korean groups
failed in efforts to sneak to the
South through the area guarded
by the US. 2nd Infantry Divi
sion. He said there were no
American casualties and Com
munist casualties were not
known.
It was the eighth straight day
of sporadic shootings along the
line dividing North and South
Korea. The action started after
31 North Korean commandos
got through allied positions
along the line and made their
way to Seoul 'with orders to as
sassinate President Chung Hee
Park.
The U.S. division guards an
18-mile western sector of the
151-mile armistice line at a point
about 25 miles north of SeouL
U.S. forces have killed four
North Koreans in the week of
fighting along the line. Two
Americans have been killed and
a dozen other? wounded.
The South Korean counteres
pionage center in Seoul an
nounced ite oi North
Korean assassination team had
been killed Friday 15 miles
north of the capital- It said his
body was identified by the lone
captured North Korean. So far,
25 North Koreans have been
killed and five are still at large.

Officials expressed belief the five
may have starved to death by
now.
In New Delhi, a spokesman
for the North Korean diplomat
ic mission to India said there
was no reason why his govern
ment should not agree to a swap
of the Korean assassination
team for the UJS. Navy intelli
gence ship Pueblo and her 83-
man crew seized last week by
Communist patrol boats.
The spokesman was comment

ing on reports quoting Soviet
sources in New Delhi as saying
such a swap could be a possi
bility. Soviet Premier Alexei N.
Kosygin is visiting India.
However, no mention was
made that the South Koreans
have only one prisoner of the
31-man team. The North Korean
spokesman told a reporter in
New Delhi: "1 don't know why
we should not and could not do
that when the Pueblo and its
crew were captured while on es

pionage work within our terri
torial waters."
There was no Immediate reac
tion in South Korea to these re
ports.
Military informants in Seoul
said the U.N. Command, whose
chief negotiators are American
officers, plans to display the
bodies of the 25 dead infiltrators
at the next meeting of the mixed
Military Armistice Commission
at Panmunjom No date has
been fixed for the session.
