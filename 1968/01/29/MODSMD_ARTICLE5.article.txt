WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen
ate Republican leader Everett
M. Dirksen of Illinois says "we
are going to have to put our
foot down" in Korea if diplo
matic efforts fail to free the cap
utred USS Pueblo and its crew.
Two leading Democratic sena
tors took the same tack Sunday,
with suggestions ranging from a
blockade to sinking of North
Korean gunboats.
Sen. John C. Stennis CD-
Miss.), chaiman of the Senate
Preparedness Subcommittee
mentioned a possible blockade.

While he carefully avoided ad
vocating any specific military
steps in advance of LJ-S. action,
he said "I wouldn't rule out any
thing"—including nuclear weap
ons.
Sen. Russell B. Long, D-La.,
suggested the United States
might start sinking North Ko
rean gunboats and holding its
merchant ships hostage in re
taliation for the seizure of the
Pueblo and its crew of 8 31ast
Monday night.
The Pentagon said Sunday it
is strengthening U-S. Air power

in the Far East as a precaution
ary move in the Korean cnsis.
The names of the air units
and the number of planes are
defense secrets, the Pentagon
said, in shunting aside all ques
tions on specific military moves.
"The United States is taking
certain precautionary measures
to strengthen our forces and to
reinforce our tactical air capa
bilities for the current situa
tion," the Pentagon said.
