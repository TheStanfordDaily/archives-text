# NLF Backed In Roble Talk
## 
### 
Karen Koonan, recently re
turned from an eight day trip to
Cambodia, said "cultural and na
tional integrity" are what South
east Asians really want.
"Everywhere we went in Cam
bodia people understood and sup
ported the National Liberation
Front," she noted.
Her visit, arranged by Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
and the Student Association of
Hanoi, included talks with NLF
and North Vietnamese represen
tatives and informal travel
through the Cambodian country
side. A planned excursion to
Hanoi was cancelled because of
increased bombing raids.
Her experience began with a
"real cultural shock," she said,
when the group hit "95 de
gree, dripping wet air" of Cey
lon.
The smells, "every block an
other one, all different than I
had ever smelled," and climate,
because of the heat "nothing
is closed in . . . there is a com
munal feeling . . . the cultured
centers around the market
place," were the most noticeable
features of Cambodia's capitol,
she recalled.
Dinner with two West German
doctors and an American who
had been to Vietnam was the
first of a series of experiences
for Miss Koonan relating to sup
port for the NLF.
The doctors noted in NLF con
trolled zones, unlike those con
trolled by South Vietnam, per
manent hospitals, schools, doc
tors and teachers have been es
tablished. Eighty per cent of the
people support the NLF, they
estimated.
The "honesty" of an NLF
dance program portraying "the
war and struggle for liberation"
and"the American soldier as a
symbol of America's vulgarity"
in involvement in Vietnam re-in
forced the doctors' analysis for
Miss Koonan.
She is "optimistic In terms
of the GI understanding the
situation, however. NLF
spokesmen quoted numerous
letters to the States saying
"We shouldn't be here." Miss
Koonan termed that and de
serting soldiers "a human re
sponse."
American troops are "slaugh
tered", she said, because they
are sent to fight with light
weapons. "They don't expect to

find so much oppostion after
preliminary bombing, she ex
plained.
The NLF leaders outlined this
and Viet Cong tactics of "de
moralizing rather than k i 111 ng
Americans." She noted instances
of shooting down helicopters,
the means of escape, rather than
Gl's, and distributing propagan
da leaflets.
Miss Koonan also elaborated
the war's effects of liberating
North Vietnamese women and
uniting the society in a common
cause. "The NLF wants to fight
the war without outside help,"
she said.
Miss Koonan discussed her ex
perience with about twenty stu
dents at Roble Hall last night.

because of the heat "nothing
is closed in . . . there is a com
munal feeling . . . the cultured
centers around the market
place," were the most noticeable
features of Cambodia's capitol,
she recalled.
Dinner with two West German
doctors and an American who
had been to Vietnam was the
first of a series of experiences
for Miss Koonan relating to sup
port for the NLF.
The doctors noted in NLF con
trolled zones, unlike those con
trolled by South Vietnam, per
manent hospitals, schools, doc
tors and teachers have been es
tablished. Eighty per cent of the
people support the NLF, they
estimated.
The "honesty" of an NLF
dance program portraying "the
war and struggle for liberation"
and"the American soldier as a
symbol of America's vulgarity"
in involvement in Vietnam re-in
forced the doctors' analysis for
Miss Koonan.
She is "optimistic In terms
of the GI understanding the
situation, however. NLF
spokesmen quoted numerous
letters to the States saying
"We shouldn't be here." Miss
Koonan termed that and de
serting soldiers "a human re
sponse."
American troops are "slaugh
tered", she said, because they
are sent to fight with light
weapons. "They don't expect to

find so much oppostion after
preliminary bombing, she ex
plained.
The NLF leaders outlined this
and Viet Cong tactics of "de
moralizing rather than k i 111 ng
Americans." She noted instances
of shooting down helicopters,
the means of escape, rather than
Gl's, and distributing propagan
da leaflets.
Miss Koonan also elaborated
the war's effects of liberating
North Vietnamese women and
uniting the society in a common
cause. "The NLF wants to fight
the war without outside help,"
she said.
Miss Koonan discussed her ex
perience with about twenty stu
dents at Roble Hall last night.
Karen Koonan, recently re
turned from an eight day trip to
Cambodia, said "cultural and na
tional integrity" are what South
east Asians really want.
"Everywhere we went in Cam
bodia people understood and sup
ported the National Liberation
Front," she noted.
Her visit, arranged by Stu
dents for a Democratic Society
and the Student Association of
Hanoi, included talks with NLF
and North Vietnamese represen
tatives and informal travel
through the Cambodian country
side. A planned excursion to
Hanoi was cancelled because of
increased bombing raids.
Her experience began with a
"real cultural shock," she said,
when the group hit "95 de
gree, dripping wet air" of Cey
lon.
The smells, "every block an
other one, all different than I
had ever smelled," and climate,
because of the heat "nothing
is closed in . . . there is a com
munal feeling . . . the cultured
centers around the market
place," were the most noticeable
