## Speechwriter Faces Issues 
### Art Buchwald 
"So you want to work as a
speechwriter for the Republican
Party in 1968?"
"Yes, Sir."
"All right. Did you see the
television show the other eve
ning when the Republicans an
swered President Johnson's
State of the Union address?"
"Yes, Sir. And it was a bril
liant performance by one and
all."
"Okay, forget the soft soap.
Let's get on with the test."
"I have to take a test?"
"Of course! If you're going to
work for the Republican Party,
you're going to have to know
where it stands on the issues."
"I know where it stands."
Dollar's Integrity
"Well, let's just see. First
question: what kind of integrity
does the Republican Party stand
for?"
"The integrity of the Ameri
can dollar."
'Okay. What has the Johnson
Administration failed to do?"

"It has failed to make clear
our goalg, and it hits not been
candid with the American pe*)
pie in facing up to the complex
and difficult road that lies
ahead."
"By heaven, you did watch
the show. Now let's go on to
the Ship of State. Where is the
Ship ol State?"
"It is wallowing in a storm
tossed sea, drifting toward the
rocks of domestic disaster, beat
en by the waves of worldwide
fiscal crisis that threaten ship
wreck."
Through Storms
"And what can save the Ship
of State?"
"A new captain at the helm
who will call up full power,
break out new charts and hold
our course steadfast and inspire
the crew to bring us through
the storm."
"Good. Now let's go on to
cities. What are the cities boil
ing with at the moment?"
"Frustration and unrest."

"It's 'unrest and frustration,'
but we'll accept your answer.
And why are thby boiling
thusly?"
"Because the Administration
has been long on promises and
short on performance."
"And what situation are we
confronted with because of
this?" '
"Lawlessness, crime in the
streets and abuse heaped upon
our police and elected officials."
Individual and Faith
"That's well put. Now let me
ask you this. What does the
Republican Party have abiding
faith in?"
"The individual."
"Why did you hesitate?"
"I thought it might be the
American free enterprise sys
tem."
"We've got abiding faith in
that, too. Either answer would
have been correct. Let's go on to
inflation. What does the Presi
dent have to do to cut it?"
"He's got to cut back on fed
eral spending and impress on
the people that we have to live
within our means here at
home."
"And if he doesn't, where will
the American people be sacri
ficed?"
"On the golden altar of eco
nomic expediency."
"What kinds of chaos do the
American people face in the
challenging years ahead?"
"Domestic chaos as well as
chaos abroad. And because of
this, we are forfeiting our lead
ership overseas and our credi
bility at home."
And Vietnam
"Okay. Now let's go on to
Vietnam. What kind of Com
munist aggression are we trying
to stem there?"
"Naked?"
"Fine. You seem to have
passed the test. You can start
writing speeches in the morn
ing."
'Thank you."
"Thank you, what?"
"Thank you from the bottom
of my heart, so help me God."

thusly?"
"Because the Administration
has been long on promises and
short on performance."
"And what situation are we
confronted with because of
this?" '
"Lawlessness, crime in the
streets and abuse heaped upon
our police and elected officials."
Individual and Faith
"That's well put. Now let me
ask you this. What does the
Republican Party have abiding
faith in?"
"The individual."
"Why did you hesitate?"
"I thought it might be the
American free enterprise sys
tem."
"We've got abiding faith in
that, too. Either answer would
have been correct. Let's go on to
inflation. What does the Presi
dent have to do to cut it?"
"He's got to cut back on fed
eral spending and impress on
the people that we have to live
within our means here at
home."
"And if he doesn't, where will
the American people be sacri
ficed?"
"On the golden altar of eco
nomic expediency."
"What kinds of chaos do the
American people face in the
challenging years ahead?"
"Domestic chaos as well as
chaos abroad. And because of
this, we are forfeiting our lead
ership overseas and our credi
bility at home."
And Vietnam
"Okay. Now let's go on to
Vietnam. What kind of Com
munist aggression are we trying
to stem there?"
"Naked?"
"Fine. You seem to have
passed the test. You can start
writing speeches in the morn
ing."
'Thank you."
"Thank you, what?"
"Thank you from the bottom
of my heart, so help me God."

"So you want to work as a
speechwriter for the Republican
Party in 1968?"
"Yes, Sir."
"All right. Did you see the
television show the other eve
ning when the Republicans an
swered President Johnson's
State of the Union address?"
"Yes, Sir. And it was a bril
liant performance by one and
all."
"Okay, forget the soft soap.
Let's get on with the test."
"I have to take a test?"
"Of course! If you're going to
work for the Republican Party,
you're going to have to know
where it stands on the issues."
"I know where it stands."
Dollar's Integrity
"Well, let's just see. First
question: what kind of integrity
does the Republican Party stand
for?"
"The integrity of the Ameri
can dollar."
'Okay. What has the Johnson
Administration failed to do?"

"It has failed to make clear
our goalg, and it hits not been
candid with the American pe*)
pie in facing up to the complex
and difficult road that lies
ahead."
"By heaven, you did watch
the show. Now let's go on to
the Ship of State. Where is the
Ship ol State?"
"It is wallowing in a storm
tossed sea, drifting toward the
rocks of domestic disaster, beat
en by the waves of worldwide
fiscal crisis that threaten ship
wreck."
Through Storms
"And what can save the Ship
of State?"
"A new captain at the helm
who will call up full power,
break out new charts and hold
our course steadfast and inspire
the crew to bring us through
the storm."
"Good. Now let's go on to
cities. What are the cities boil
ing with at the moment?"
"Frustration and unrest."

"It's 'unrest and frustration,'
but we'll accept your answer.
And why are thby boiling
thusly?"
"Because the Administration
has been long on promises and
short on performance."
"And what situation are we
confronted with because of
this?" '
"Lawlessness, crime in the
