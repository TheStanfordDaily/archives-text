# Trio Of Agonies In Korea
## 
### Max Lerner 
The Korean crisis involves a
trio of decision making agonies.
One is in Washington, in the
American power-center; the sec
ond is in the Communist power
center at Moscow; the third is
in Pyongyang itself, where the
North Koreans have had to
make a fateful decision. What
happens finally will depend on
the point at which the three
intersect.
President Johnson and his ad
visers have been playing it cool,
but how long will they be able
to keep the American people
cool? Moscow has been playing
it stony-faced, but that, too, may
vanish when they learn that
Washington means business.
Pyongyang has covered itself
with a thick propaganda cloud,
making it hard to separate their
current exultation in a propa
ganda success with a graver
long-range intent.
The danger lies in the chance
that, somewhere In this three
cornered game that nations
play, someone may assume
the others are bluffing when
they are in dead earnest. The
fact is that it is a game that
none of the three can win if
it results in more shooting.
The hope Is that all three will
know it before it is too late.

I shouldn't enjoy being In
President Johnson's seat at this
point. He has been careful not to
say anything that would heat
up the American passions. Ev
eryone has known that govern
ments today engage in electron
ic spying, and everyone has as
sumed that if the ships are far
enough offshore they can get
away with it.
The Pueblo was far enough
offshore, in international wa
ters, and in that sense the sei
zure was a violation of interna
tional law, even though the
ship was on an obvious intelli
gence mission. The American
people consider the seizure an
act of piracy, and any senator
or President who runs afoul of
this mood does so at his polit
ical peril.
It takes skillful leadership in
Washington to stay cool and de
termined at the same time. One
trusts there will be no break in
this mood. At some point, of
course, there must be the credi
ble intent to act with power if
the strategy of persuasion fails.
The questions are what action,
and how much power.
Washington has little pres
sure it can exert on Moscow
to persuade Its Korean ally
except the threat of a show

down on the Soviet spy-ships
disguised as trawlers and fish
ing boats.
If that fails, both Moscow and
Pyongyang must ask themselves
whether they want to run the
risk of a repetition of the ad
venture they ended in Korea
almost 15 years ago, this time
with a strong South Korean
army as an opponent, aided by
American planes.
The Americans in turn must
ask themselves whether they
want to add a second messy war,
even if limited to the air, to the
current messy war in Vietnam.
The prospect of this may cool
off the ardor of some of the
senators and congressmen and
governors who have come out
with "go in and get out the ship
and men" statements.
It is interesting that several
senators who are Doves on
Vietnam have called for strong
action on Korea. But nothing
will be lost with the lapse of
some time for cooling and real
negotiation. The ship and the
men will still be there.
Obviously, the Vietnamese
war complicates everything.
If not for Vietnam, the Ameri
can government would have
mofe options and a freer hand.
Yet it is also true that by

handling himself skillfully on
Korea — as he did in the Cy
prus crisis and the Arab-Is
raeli war — President John
son could gain added strength
both at home and In world
opinion.
The key to the crisis lies with
North Korea's intent to play off
its old ally, China, against its
new ally, Russia, and thus get
its share of leadership and glory
in the Communist world. If so,
the key to the solution will have
to lie with Russia and its capa
city to keep its ally within the
bounds of nonfanatical action.
If the crisis gets resolved, and
the men and ship are returned,
we may later have the luxury
of an inquest into what actually
happened on the Pueblo at the
moment of decision, how the ship
was left unprotected, what op
tions the commander had, why
he made the choice he did.
We are learning that at even
this level of decision-making, in
his lowly spot in command of a
small intelligence craft, a young
American had to make a choice
on which not only his whole
career and reputation depended,
but the risks of war and peace
for his country and the world.
