## H-Bomb Averts Spirits 
### Art Hopper 
Once upon a time there was a
very backward, superstitious,
uncivilized Eskimo named Mr.
Albert Chukaluk who found a
hydrogen bomb.
Naturally, Mr. Chuckaluk, be
ing backward, superstitious and
uncivilized, didn't know it was
a hydrogen bomb.
He thought it was a totem
pole. So he dragged it home,
stood it up on end in front of his
igloo and danced around it daily,
mutter imprecations.
The other Eskimoes thought
he was crazy. "That's not a to
tem pole, Albert," they'd say. "It
doesn't have an eagle's a
petrel's wings nor a walrus'
tusks. How do you expect to
ward off evil spirits with that?"
But Mr. Chukaluk just kept on
dancing. "In my heart," he said
grimly, "I know I'm right."
★ ★ ★
Eventutally, word of Mr. Chuk
aluk's find reached Washington.
"Now look it here," said the Pres
ident testily to his generals. "You
got to stop carelessly dropping
these hydrogen bombs all over
the countryside. They don't come

cheap, you know. Well, don't
stand there. Go get it back."
So an airborne brigade under
General Zip K. Zapp was dis
patched to Mr. Chukaluk's vil
lage. At the sight of this ap
proaching military might, the
Eskimoes panicked and each
danced furiously around his own
totom pole, muttering impreca
tions — Mr. Chukaluk along with
the rest.
The brigade drew up in front
of Mr. Chukaluk's igloo. "All
right," said General Zapp tc
Mr. Chukaluk, "give us back our
hydrogen bomb."
"It's not a hydrogen bomb,"
said Mr. Chukaluk, folding nis
arms. "It's a totem pole designed
to ward off evil spirits."
At this the General had to
laugh. "My, you Eskimos are
backward, superstitious and un
civilized," he said. "But anyway,
it's purs, so fork it over."
"Finders, keepers," said Mr.
Chukaluk and picking up a wal
rus-bone hammer he added
bravely, "Before I let you have
it, I'll pound it to pieces first."
"Let's not be hasty," cried Gen
eral Zapp hastily. And, changing
tactics, he turned on his most
persuasive smile. "Actually, Mr.
Chukaluk,' he said, "we need
it more than you do."
"What for?" said Mr. Chuka
luk suspiciously.
"It's part of our arsenal of
democracy,' said the General.
"It is essential to our national
security."
"How do you use it?" inquired
Mr. Chukaluk.
"Oh, we'd never use it," said
the General reassuringly. "But
simply by having it, and thou
sands like it, around, we know
in our hearts that no enemy
would ever dare attack us."
"Well, if you've got no use for
it, I might as well pound it to
pieces,' 'said Mr. Chukaluk, heft
ing his walrus-bone hammer.
"Unless, of course, you hightail
it out of here before I count to
one. Ten, nine, eight ..."
•i ★ ★
Needless'* to say the airborne
brigade beat a hasty retreat.
And all the other Eskimos hail
ed Mr. Chukaluk for driving off
such a vastly more numerous
force.
"Oh, it wasn't so much," said

Mr. Chukaluk modestly. "After
all, any tribe that thinks it
needs thousands of useless to

tems to worship is very back
ward, superstitious and uncivi
lized lot."

got to stop carelessly dropping
these hydrogen bombs all over
the countryside. They don't come

cheap, you know. Well, don't
stand there. Go get it back."
So an airborne brigade under
General Zip K. Zapp was dis
patched to Mr. Chukaluk's vil
lage. At the sight of this ap
proaching military might, the
Eskimoes panicked and each
danced furiously around his own
totom pole, muttering impreca
tions — Mr. Chukaluk along with
the rest.
The brigade drew up in front
of Mr. Chukaluk's igloo. "All
right," said General Zapp tc
Mr. Chukaluk, "give us back our
hydrogen bomb."
"It's not a hydrogen bomb,"
said Mr. Chukaluk, folding nis
arms. "It's a totem pole designed
to ward off evil spirits."
At this the General had to
laugh. "My, you Eskimos are
backward, superstitious and un
civilized," he said. "But anyway,
it's purs, so fork it over."
"Finders, keepers," said Mr.
Chukaluk and picking up a wal
rus-bone hammer he added
bravely, "Before I let you have
it, I'll pound it to pieces first."
"Let's not be hasty," cried Gen
eral Zapp hastily. And, changing
tactics, he turned on his most
persuasive smile. "Actually, Mr.
Chukaluk,' he said, "we need
it more than you do."
"What for?" said Mr. Chuka
luk suspiciously.
"It's part of our arsenal of
democracy,' said the General.
"It is essential to our national
security."
"How do you use it?" inquired
Mr. Chukaluk.
"Oh, we'd never use it," said
the General reassuringly. "But
simply by having it, and thou
sands like it, around, we know
in our hearts that no enemy
would ever dare attack us."
"Well, if you've got no use for
it, I might as well pound it to
pieces,' 'said Mr. Chukaluk, heft
ing his walrus-bone hammer.
"Unless, of course, you hightail
it out of here before I count to
one. Ten, nine, eight ..."
•i ★ ★
Needless'* to say the airborne
brigade beat a hasty retreat.
And all the other Eskimos hail
ed Mr. Chukaluk for driving off
such a vastly more numerous
force.
"Oh, it wasn't so much," said

Mr. Chukaluk modestly. "After
all, any tribe that thinks it
needs thousands of useless to

tems to worship is very back
ward, superstitious and uncivi
lized lot."
Once upon a time there was a
very backward, superstitious,
uncivilized Eskimo named Mr.
Albert Chukaluk who found a
hydrogen bomb.
Naturally, Mr. Chuckaluk, be
ing backward, superstitious and
uncivilized, didn't know it was
a hydrogen bomb.
He thought it was a totem
pole. So he dragged it home,
stood it up on end in front of his
igloo and danced around it daily,
mutter imprecations.
The other Eskimoes thought
he was crazy. "That's not a to
tem pole, Albert," they'd say. "It
doesn't have an eagle's a
petrel's wings nor a walrus'
tusks. How do you expect to
ward off evil spirits with that?"
But Mr. Chukaluk just kept on
dancing. "In my heart," he said
grimly, "I know I'm right."

Eventutally, word of Mr. Chuk
aluk's find reached Washington.
"Now look it here," said the Pres
