## Course Credit Concern Shows Student Attitude 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Your editorial, "Ethics and
Grading," is a positively stun
ning example of Stanford im
maturity. Stanford students talk
a great deal about the need for
the student to plan his own edu
cation, and to be independent of
the Oppressive Stanford System;
they insist repeatedly that edu
cation is not gained from cour
ses alone.
But at the same time, they still
want the Stanford Establishment
to pat them paternally on the
head and give their every iden
tity crisis its official stamp of
approval, the Academic Credit.
Kiddies, you can't have it both
ways. If the System bugs you
so much, maybe that's your
fault for taking the System so
damn seriously, and not practic
ing the mature, inner-oriented
philosophy you preach. . . .
Few Independents
I think it's significant that
Stanford has so few independent
student organizations. Every
thing from the Stanford orches
tra to the sfnallest Undergradu
ate Special seminar is a course
for credit, under the auspices of
Official Stanford. And no one —
not even the most anti-establish
ment reformer — seems to feel
that there's anything wrong
with this.
What is so good about a pat
tern of independent activities is
that every entering freshman
very quickly gets the idea that
his dealings with the official aca
demic system comprise only a
part — perhaps a small part —
of his college education.
Whatever he does, he soon
discovers that, within very wide
limits, nobody cares very much
how he runs his life, except him
self. Not even the graduate
schools — if you're good enough
and interested enough in a field,
it usually shows up in some
form that graduate schools can
recognize.
Accept System
I maintain that much of the
general unhappiness around this

place stems not from the Sys
tem's attitude toward students,
but from the students' attitude
toward the System. I don't think
Stanford students — and that in
cludes whoever wrote that edi
torial — are really willing to
accept the consequences of the
demise of in loco parentis.
If you assert that ypur edu
cation is ultimately in your
hands, not Stanford's, then you
also have to admit that your
identity crises are your business,
and your friends' business, but
not Stanford's.
Damn it, figure out what your
thing is, and do it. Lightning
won't strike if you get a few
C's. Stanford doesn't care. (If
mommy and daddy care, that's
your problem.)
Yes, Virginia, in loco parentis
really is -dead. You're on your
own now.

Editorial Hypocrisy
Doesn't Justify War
Editor, The Daily:
The editorial of Jan. 29 pre
sented an excellent, though per
haps unwitting, characterization
of the hypocrisy of the liberal
ism so much in vogue on cam
pus: "Nothing justifies war; vio
lence is justified only as a des
perate last resort in a fight for
self-preservation." Thomas Hob
bes would be proud.
DAVID SCARBROUGH
Sophomore
Editor, The Dally:
Your editorial, "Ethics and
Grading," is a positively stun
ning example of Stanford im
maturity. Stanford students talk
a great deal about the need for
the student to plan his own edu
cation, and to be independent of
the Oppressive Stanford System;
they insist repeatedly that edu
cation is not gained from cour
ses alone.
But at the same time, they still
want the Stanford Establishment
to pat them paternally on the
head and give their every iden
tity crisis its official stamp of
approval, the Academic Credit.
Kiddies, you can't have it both
ways. If the System bugs you
so much, maybe that's your
fault for taking the System so
damn seriously, and not practic
ing the mature, inner-oriented
philosophy you preach. . . .
Few Independents
I think it's significant that
Stanford has so few independent
student organizations. Every
thing from the Stanford orches
tra to the sfnallest Undergradu
ate Special seminar is a course
for credit, under the auspices of
Official Stanford. And no one —
not even the most anti-establish
ment reformer — seems to feel
that there's anything wrong
with this.
What is so good about a pat
tern of independent activities is
that every entering freshman
very quickly gets the idea that
his dealings with the official aca
demic system comprise only a
part — perhaps a small part —
of his college education.
Whatever he does, he soon
discovers that, within very wide
limits, nobody cares very much
how he runs his life, except him
self. Not even the graduate
schools — if you're good enough
and interested enough in a field,
it usually shows up in some
form that graduate schools can
recognize.
Accept System
I maintain that much of the
general unhappiness around this

place stems not from the Sys
tem's attitude toward students,
but from the students' attitude
toward the System. I don't think
Stanford students — and that in
cludes whoever wrote that edi
torial — are really willing to
accept the consequences of the
demise of in loco parentis.
If you assert that ypur edu
cation is ultimately in your
hands, not Stanford's, then you
also have to admit that your
identity crises are your business,
and your friends' business, but
not Stanford's.
Damn it, figure out what your
thing is, and do it. Lightning
won't strike if you get a few
C's. Stanford doesn't care. (If
mommy and daddy care, that's
your problem.)
Yes, Virginia, in loco parentis
really is -dead. You're on your
own now.
