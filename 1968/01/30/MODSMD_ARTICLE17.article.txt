# Students Becoming Apolitical, Harvard Professor Asserts
## 
### 
Despite the attentions focused
on political demonstrations on
campuses, most students are a
political and tend to endorse
moderate or conservative parties,
according to a study by the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences.
The winter issue of Daedalus,
the journal of the Academy, ana
lyzes students groups through
out the world. The issue cele
brates Daedalus's 10th annover
sary.
In an introductory essay, Sey
mour Martin Lipset, professor
of government at Harvard Uni
versity, asserts that the largest
political groups on campuses in
the United States are the Young
Republicans and the Young
Democrats, with a combined
membership of under 250,000.
Students for a Democratic So
ciety, a New Left organization,
has 7,000 members, he says. He
notes that a survey of college
students in 1967 showed a plur
ality in favor of the Republicans
for the 1968 elections.
Moreover, Professor Lipset
says, four national surveys con
ducted during 1965-1966 show
two-thirds to three-fourths of
American students supported the
war in Vietnam.
"Although students have play
ed a rather major role in sup

porting various Communist
movements at different times,"
Professor Lipset says,"the par
ty has tended to deprecate their
role."
Organized workers of the de
veloped countries of Europe and
America have become a conser
vative force, Professor Lipset
says, and trade unions and lab
or-based parties had been inte
grated into an "institutional sys
tem of representation and collec
tive bargaining."
"As such, they are not con
cerned with policies and pro
grams that may upset the po
litical system," he writes.
"The orthodox (pro-Russian)
Communist parties in man}
countries have also become part
of the regular system of repre
sentation and no longer advo
cate extra-legal and extra-par
liamentary tactics. In Latin-
America, they oppose the guer
rilla tactics of the Castroites
and Maoists."
More attention has been fo
cused on the American student
movement today than was the
case in the nineteen-thirties,
Professor Lipset says, because
intellectuals and students "have
remained a force of new radical
leadership and mass support
while other elements of society
have not."

Research in various countries
tends to validate the generali
zation that the children of
poorer families are more well-to
do, Professor Lipset says, but
this does not apply "that simply
to student populations."

In an introductory essay, Sey
mour Martin Lipset, professor
of government at Harvard Uni
versity, asserts that the largest
political groups on campuses in
the United States are the Young
Republicans and the Young
Democrats, with a combined
membership of under 250,000.
Students for a Democratic So
ciety, a New Left organization,
has 7,000 members, he says. He
notes that a survey of college
students in 1967 showed a plur
ality in favor of the Republicans
for the 1968 elections.
Moreover, Professor Lipset
says, four national surveys con
ducted during 1965-1966 show
two-thirds to three-fourths of
American students supported the
war in Vietnam.
"Although students have play
ed a rather major role in sup

porting various Communist
movements at different times,"
Professor Lipset says,"the par
ty has tended to deprecate their
role."
Organized workers of the de
veloped countries of Europe and
America have become a conser
vative force, Professor Lipset
says, and trade unions and lab
or-based parties had been inte
grated into an "institutional sys
tem of representation and collec
tive bargaining."
"As such, they are not con
cerned with policies and pro
grams that may upset the po
litical system," he writes.
"The orthodox (pro-Russian)
Communist parties in man}
countries have also become part
of the regular system of repre
sentation and no longer advo
cate extra-legal and extra-par
liamentary tactics. In Latin-
America, they oppose the guer
rilla tactics of the Castroites
and Maoists."
More attention has been fo
cused on the American student
movement today than was the
case in the nineteen-thirties,
Professor Lipset says, because
intellectuals and students "have
remained a force of new radical
leadership and mass support
while other elements of society
have not."

Research in various countries
tends to validate the generali
zation that the children of
poorer families are more well-to
do, Professor Lipset says, but
this does not apply "that simply
to student populations."
Despite the attentions focused
on political demonstrations on
campuses, most students are a
