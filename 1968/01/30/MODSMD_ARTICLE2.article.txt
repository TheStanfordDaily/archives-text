## 
### 
The Department of Modern
European Languages will be
split into three separate depart
ments, effective September 1.
The new areas will be the De
partment of German, with F. W.
Strothmann as executive head,
the Department of Slavic, head
ed by Donald Fanger, and the
Department of Spanish and Por
tuguese, with Bernard Gicovate
in charge.
These new departments are
presently divisions of the Mod
ern European Languages De
partment.
Strothmann stated that this
change only "makes official"
what had previously existed with
the three divisions.
"It was decided about six years
ago that as soon as each divi
sion was strong enough to func
tion on its own this move would
be made," he said. "They have
grown significantly over the past
few years and are now large
enough.
"This simply makes it offi
cial. We are recognizing the aca
demic fact"
The German department will
remain in building 240. Spanish
and Portuguese will be housed
in its current location, building
120, next to the Law School.

The future site of the Slavic
department is undecided, pos
sibly in the old biology building,
Strothmann said.
At present, there are 89 Ger
man majors, 62 in Spanish and
Portuguese, and 27 in Slavic.
