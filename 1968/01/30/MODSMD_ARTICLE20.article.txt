# Erasmus Ineligible, Can't Be 'Playboy'
## 
### 
For awhile it appeared as if
a cat (feline) named Erasmus
would walk off with first prize
in the Air Force R.O.T.C. Play
boy Contest, an expense-paid
visit to the San Francisco Play
boy Club.
When the apparent victory
was announced Friday, Eras

mus' owner, Jonathan Ketchum,
commented, "For my part, I
think this is the most wonder
ful tribute paid any other ani
mal of our kingdom since Har
vard University awarded an aca
demic degree to a monkey many
years ago."
In actual fact, as Robert
Stone, Cadet Commander of the
Air Force R.0.T.C., expalined,
Erasmus was ineligible, not
having reached age 21.
The eventual winner was
therefore a senior, Richard Mur
doch, with 600 votes, all of
which, reported Stone, "Were
cast by himself." Murdoch is
the business manager of Los
Arcos eating club.
Second v#fh 595 ballots was
Dean of the Chapel B. Davie
Napier. Former ASSU president
Dave Harris ran third with 190.
