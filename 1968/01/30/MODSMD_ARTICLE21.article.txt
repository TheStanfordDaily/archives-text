# Deported Bishop Views South African Danger
## 
### TOM REESE 
South Africa is on a "collision
course with disaster," according
to the Right Rev. C. Edward
Crowther, former Anglican Bish
op of Kimberley and Kuruman,
South Africa.
Bishop Crowther said that
South Africa's apartheid poli
cies are the cause of this dan
gerous situation. He was de
ported from South Africa last
summer because of his opposi
tion to racial apartheid.
Speaking yesterday afternoon
in a speech sponsored by the
Political Union, Bishop Crow
ther gave a background sum
mary of the racial situation in
the African country. He termed
apartheid "a quasi-theology
springing from the Dutch Re
form Church doctrine of pre
destination" that views South
Africa's thirteen million Ne
groes as children. "Clergy that
attack apartheid," Crowther
said, "are therefore viewed by
the South African government
as attacking God."
Citing the poor health, ex
treme poverty, and lack of
education of the South African
Bantus, Rev. Crowther denied
that South Africa keeps her
races "separate but equal." He
pointed out new legislation in
South Africa to create "Ban
tu stands" on which the na
tion's colored, who comprise
three-fourths of South Afri
ca's population, would be
forced to live off one-eighth

of the country's land.
"Although economic standards
are improving for the colored in
South Africa," Crowther assert
ed, "the gap between the haves
and the have-nots is widening."
An average black worker in
South Africa earns $15 per
month, while the nation's whites
enjoy the world's second highest
living standard according to
Crowther. Crowther also stated
that South Africa requires each
person to be educated in his na
tive tongue, thus denying Ban
tus opportunity to succeed in the
white world. Crowther conclud
ed his economic remarks by
stating, "The fact is that the
colored in South Africa live in
squalor and degradation."
Turning to the legal prob
lems of apartheid, Bishop Crow
ther called South Africa a "po
lice state." He told of prison sen
tences for opponents of apar
theid of six to eighteen months
without trial or right of habeas
corpus.
Crowther described the effi
cient South African secret police
and related their discovery of
such small details as his dinner
conversations with friends. He
then said he had discovered that
over three hundred letters he had
sent to America had been im
pounded by the South African
government.
Crowther concluded his lec

ture by tracing the future con
sequences of South Africa's seg
regation policies. He saw Amer
ica as having a growing eco
nomic interest in South Africa,
and he forecast increased "in
advertent American involve
ment" in South African affairs.
"Meanwhile, black Africa
seeks to destroy white South
Africa. The United States may
therefore look forward to mili
tary action in South Africa
within the decade—and she
might be on the wrong side."

that South Africa requires each
person to be educated in his na
tive tongue, thus denying Ban
tus opportunity to succeed in the
white world. Crowther conclud
ed his economic remarks by
stating, "The fact is that the
colored in South Africa live in
squalor and degradation."
Turning to the legal prob
lems of apartheid, Bishop Crow
ther called South Africa a "po
lice state." He told of prison sen
tences for opponents of apar
theid of six to eighteen months
without trial or right of habeas
corpus.
Crowther described the effi
cient South African secret police
and related their discovery of
such small details as his dinner
conversations with friends. He
then said he had discovered that
over three hundred letters he had
sent to America had been im
pounded by the South African
government.
Crowther concluded his lec

ture by tracing the future con
sequences of South Africa's seg
regation policies. He saw Amer
ica as having a growing eco
nomic interest in South Africa,
and he forecast increased "in
advertent American involve
ment" in South African affairs.
"Meanwhile, black Africa
seeks to destroy white South
Africa. The United States may
therefore look forward to mili
tary action in South Africa
within the decade—and she
might be on the wrong side."
South Africa is on a "collision
course with disaster," according
to the Right Rev. C. Edward
Crowther, former Anglican Bish
op of Kimberley and Kuruman,
South Africa.
Bishop Crowther said that
South Africa's apartheid poli
cies are the cause of this dan
gerous situation. He was de
ported from South Africa last
summer because of his opposi
tion to racial apartheid.
Speaking yesterday afternoon
in a speech sponsored by the
Political Union, Bishop Crow
ther gave a background sum
mary of the racial situation in
the African country. He termed
apartheid "a quasi-theology
springing from the Dutch Re
form Church doctrine of pre
destination" that views South
Africa's thirteen million Ne
groes as children. "Clergy that
attack apartheid," Crowther
said, "are therefore viewed by
the South African government
as attacking God."
Citing the poor health, ex
treme poverty, and lack of
education of the South African
Bantus, Rev. Crowther denied
that South Africa keeps her
races "separate but equal." He
pointed out new legislation in
South Africa to create "Ban
tu stands" on which the na
tion's colored, who comprise
three-fourths of South Afri
ca's population, would be
forced to live off one-eighth

of the country's land.
"Although economic standards
are improving for the colored in
South Africa," Crowther assert
ed, "the gap between the haves
and the have-nots is widening."
An average black worker in
South Africa earns $15 per
month, while the nation's whites
enjoy the world's second highest
living standard according to
Crowther. Crowther also stated
that South Africa requires each
person to be educated in his na
tive tongue, thus denying Ban
tus opportunity to succeed in the
white world. Crowther conclud
