# Century 21 Series Studies Machine Creativity, Future
## 
### 
The potentials for "Artificial
Intelligence and Creativity" will
be considered by John McCarthy,
Stanford professor of computer
science, tonight at 7:30 in Tres
idder Lounge as a part of the
continuing Century 21 series.
McCarthy, a graduate of Cal
Tech and Princeton, and former
faculty member of Princeton,
MIT, and Dartmouth, feels that
" . . . computers can make it
possible for people to be treated
as individuals in any situation
where they are now lumped in
the aggregate."
He will consider the quality
of this individual attention and
the extent to which the quality
of a computer program can ap
proach the quality of the human
mind.
The impact of the computer is
often underestimated. McCarthy

writes, "The creation of the
high-speed computer has been
as central to the contemporary
revolution in the technology of
war as the intercontinental mis
sle and the thermonuclear war
head."
Presently the use of the com
puter's technical abilities in this
application is straightforward
but the creative abilities of the
computer are still uncertain and
attract the attention of many
researchers.
Lost To Russia
McCarthy headed the team of
Stanford mathematicians which
programmed a recent computer
chess match with a group of
Russians; despite the Soviet vic
tory, the experiment was termed
a "significant step in research
toward development of comput
ers capable of creative decision
making in economics, industry
and science."
McCarthy also feels "the com
mand of information made pos
sible by the computer should
also make it possible to reverse
the trend toward mass-produced
uniformity started by the in
dustrial revolution. Taking ad
vantage of this opportunity may
present the most urgent engi
neering, social and political
questions of the next genera
tion."
