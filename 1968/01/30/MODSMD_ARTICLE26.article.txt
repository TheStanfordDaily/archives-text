# Stereo Thief Hits Professor's Home
## 
### 
A thief with a preference for
expensive hi-fi and stereo equip
ment was busy on campus Sat
urday night for the eighth time
this month.
The home of English Prof.
David Levin at 831 Esplanada
Way was burglarized early
Saturday evening. The thief re
moved a stereo radio, a record
turntable, two stereo speakers
and a portable television worth
a total of $590 after forcing a
sliding glass door.
Prof. Levin reported that he
returned home Saturday eve
ning at 10 to find his door open

and the equipment missing.
Mrs. Levin said that the bur
glars were "very neat and
clean," though some books were
knocked off the bookcase.
Stereo tapes worth about $100
were reported taken from two
cars parked in campus parking
lots Saturday afternoon. The
stereo tape decks in the cars
were not removed.
The burglary of the Levin
home continues a series of
stereo equipment burglaries
from dormitory rooms and pri
vate campus houses that started
during the Christmas vacation.
