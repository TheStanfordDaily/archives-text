# Possony Says USSR Behind Vietnam War
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
The Vietnamese War is "one
front in a raw confrontation"
between Communist ideology,
which is "still run out of Mos
cow," and the United States, ar
cording to Dr. Stefan Possony
of the Hoover Institute.
Possony told a Tresidder au
dience last night that the Soviet
Union is responsible not only
for the Vietnam conflict but also
for last June's Israeli-Arab war,
the devaluation of the British
pound, an attempted military
coup in Grece last May, the re
cent Cuban purge, and the new
est Korean crisis.
"All these little wars are not
going to get the U.S. down,"
Possony emphasized, but the

"attrition of our military
strength is the method by
which they can set us up for
the kilL"
Possony, director of Hoover's
International Political Studies
Program, cited evidence which
he claimed supports his conten
tions.
He commented that "the way
in which the U.S. has been act
ing has been counter-productive.
Everytime we compromise a sit
uation is not settled. It Just con
tinues. We always have unfinish
ed business."
On Vietnam, the major topic
of his speech, Possony said that
"at the rate we are going we are
ahead of the game by our old
deadlines. But there is still one

or two years before the situ
ation is liquidated."
The Vietnamese conflict is "far
from being a mutually genocidal
war," Possony affirmed. He add
ed that "the war itself is a great
economic boom" for both North
and South Vietnam.
Hanoi has "no substitute for
this war" because, assuming that
the war could go on for twenty
years, North and South Vietnam
"will be two of the best develop
ed countries in Asia," Possony
said.
"The cost of manpower doesn't
particularly bother the Asians.
These losses can be sustained
indefinitely" by North Vietnam,
he declared, since "two-fifths to
two-thirds of Hanoi's gross na
tional product is being supplied
from the outside."
He explained that It Is a
"grave mistake to consider
that escalation was restricted
to Vietnam." Possony claim
ed that "people's wars of lib
eration" were planned for In
donesia, Malaysia, Thailand
and the Philippines In South
east Asia, and for a number
of African and Latin Ameri
can countries as well.
Because the United States de
cided to make Vietnam a testing
point, these planned Communist
wars were never carried through
successfully, Possony asserted.
Commenting on the Korean
crisis, Possony called the North
Korean action an open violation
of our rights and predicted that
"in three to four days we'll have
to get the ship back. I presume
we will strike by air."
The purpose of the North Ko
rean action is to resume "activi
ties in one way or andther to
take over South Korea", while
the United States' forces are tied
up in Vietnam, he said.
Possony added, "I hope the
Koreans have done us a service.
I hope we will be forced into it
since Americans have to be hit
over their heads before they
realize" Communist aggression.
