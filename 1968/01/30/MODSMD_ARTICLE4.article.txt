# Committee Grants First Waiver From General Studies Program
## 
### DAN SNELL 
The General Studies Commit
tee granted the first waiver from
General Studies requirements
ever last week.
A senior was allowed to com
plete the General Studies lan
guage requirement with two
quarters of Greek instead of
completing the five required
quarters in Spanish.
Four petitions came before the
committee, and three were de
nied. Two others had been "de
nied administratively" because
they did not fit into the de
scription of petitions delineated
in the Academic Council em
powering resolution.
The Academic Council, com

posed of all faculty members
above and including the rank of
instructor, approved January 5
the proposal submitted by Vice
provost Herbert Packer to al
low the General Studies Com
mittee to waive requirements in
certain cases.
The resolution made it clear
that no relief was to be grant
ed students who had failed to
fulfill their requirements.
Exemptions would be granted
only^
• if the student plans the pro
gram beforehand.
• if there is "compelling rea
son to warrant such action."
Now the General Studies Com
mittee is in the process of adopt
ing guidlines for use in deciding
which petitions will be granted.
In their meeting January 10,
the committee members decided
on three rules of procedure:
• Petitions must be submitted
to the committee by the first
quarter of the junior year. The
committee resolution stated, "In
no case will a petition of this
nature be considered after the
third quarter of the junior year."
This was adopted with the un
derstanding that students who
are seniors this year will be al
lowed to petition the committee
in spite of the resolution.
The Commitoe felt that se
niors this year should not be

denied the chance to take ad
vantage of the newly institut
ed, approved possibilities for
flexibility. The committee ex
pects that the other require
ments for petitions will hold
for petitions from seniors, in
cluding the stipulation that
the change in General Stu
dies requirements be planned
"in advance."
• Another committee resolu
tion read, "All exemptions from
or substitutions for the General
Studies requirements shall be
made in the spirit of advancing
the aims of general education."
The Committee did not define
what constituted "the aims of
general education:" but from the
decisions of the committee it
seemed that, in order to be ap
proved, a program should not
be mere elaborations of the stu
dent's major field.
• It was decided that requests
for outright exemption from re
quirements would be decided by
the General Studies Committee,
but requests for substitution
would be handled by the com
mittee's sub-committee on ad
vising, chaired by Dr. Harvey
Hall, registrar.
The recommendation to the
Academic Council quoted the
findings of the study of eduac
tion of 1954-56. "This Commit

tee . . . has become increasingly
aware of the fact that no spe
cific set of requirements can
constitute a satisfactory pro
gram of general studies if it
remains unchanged over a long
period of time," that report
said.
The Packer recommendation
pointed out that giving the Gen
eral Studies Committee power
to approve changes in the re
quirements for individuals was
within the spirit of the 1956
report.
Packer's proposal said, "The
need which the (Academic
Council Executive) Commit
tee sees is for authority to
approve well-planned pro
grams which may deviate in
some particulars from the
formal General Studies re
quirements.
No general studies exemptions
will be considered for persons
applying for interdepartmental
majors, according to Lawrence
Ryan, Associate Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences. This is
to avoid having to get the ap
proval of too many committees
for any interdepartmental
major program.
The General Studies Commit
tee consists of Robert Walker,
chairman; Richard Eastman,
chemistry; Lorenz Eitner, art;

H. Bruce Franklin, English;
and Edwin Good, humanities.
Other members are Joseph
Pettit, electrical engineering;
David Regnery, biology; Robert
Sears, humanities and sciences
dean; and Lorie Tarshis, eco
nomics.

members as well as the profes

eral Studies Committee power
to approve changes in the re
quirements for individuals was
within the spirit of the 1956
report.
Packer's proposal said, "The
need which the (Academic
Council Executive) Commit
tee sees is for authority to
approve well-planned pro
grams which may deviate in
some particulars from the
formal General Studies re
quirements.
No general studies exemptions
will be considered for persons
applying for interdepartmental
majors, according to Lawrence
Ryan, Associate Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences. This is
to avoid having to get the ap
proval of too many committees
for any interdepartmental
major program.
The General Studies Commit
tee consists of Robert Walker,
chairman; Richard Eastman,
chemistry; Lorenz Eitner, art;

H. Bruce Franklin, English;
and Edwin Good, humanities.
Other members are Joseph
Pettit, electrical engineering;
David Regnery, biology; Robert
Sears, humanities and sciences
dean; and Lorie Tarshis, eco
nomics.
The committee has student
members as well as the profes
sors named above, but the stu
dents are not present to hear
petitions.
