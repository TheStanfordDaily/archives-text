# World Student Strike Seen
## 
### 
CHICAGO (CPS) — More
than 900 student activists from
the United States and Latin
America have called a world
wide student strike "against the
war in Vietnam and racism."
The students announced plans
for the strike during a confer
ence here last weekend spon
sored by the Student Mobiliza
tion Committee, a New York
based organization which helped
plan large-scale demonstrations
in New York and California last
April 15, and the massive demon
stration at the Pentagon last
Oct. 21.
The strike will be held Fri
day, April 20, In the midst of
10 days of concentrated anti

war activity scheduled from
April 20 to April 30.
The 10-day period coincides
with the "Ten Days To Shake
The Empire" program announ
ced at a national meeting of
Students for a Democratic So
ciety last December.
The Black Caucus at the con
ference last weekend called its
strike against "imperialism, ra
cism, and the draft."
The majority of students at
tending the conference strongly
supported the strike, but there
was some opposition. The op
position centered largely around
charges that the Student Mobi
lization Committee is a "manpu
lative, elitist organization with
out a broad-based constituency."

Some students also charged
that the call for a world-wide
strike is a bad tactic because it
does not stem from nor does it
contribute to building the grass
roots anti-war movement.
Chris Hobson, a member of
the SDS chapter at the Uni
versity of Chicago, said the
strike "would isolate rather
than build ttie anti-war move
ment in that staying out of
classes for a day 'against the
war' is far removed from the
everyday lives and decisions
of the average student."
Hobson encouraged the stu
dents at the conference to "con
centrate on local issues show
ing how they are tied into the

war and into the society we live
in, and in this way build the
consciousness of the movement.
We don't need elite-sponsored
gimmacks that can so easily
fail."
However, Renaldo Moute, a
Latin American student, said
students in the United States
must strike "to demonstrate to
the peoples of Latin America,
Asia, and Africa that there are
those in America who still have
a conscience and who oppose
the imperalist and racist poli
cies perpetrated by the U.S. gov
ernment all over the world."
A motion to call off the strike
and to dissolve the Student
Mobilization Committee was
roundly defeated.

The strike will be held Fri
day, April 20, In the midst of
10 days of concentrated anti

war activity scheduled from
April 20 to April 30.
The 10-day period coincides
with the "Ten Days To Shake
The Empire" program announ
ced at a national meeting of
Students for a Democratic So
ciety last December.
The Black Caucus at the con
ference last weekend called its
strike against "imperialism, ra
cism, and the draft."
The majority of students at
tending the conference strongly
supported the strike, but there
was some opposition. The op
position centered largely around
charges that the Student Mobi
lization Committee is a "manpu
lative, elitist organization with
out a broad-based constituency."

Some students also charged
that the call for a world-wide
strike is a bad tactic because it
does not stem from nor does it
contribute to building the grass
roots anti-war movement.
Chris Hobson, a member of
the SDS chapter at the Uni
versity of Chicago, said the
strike "would isolate rather
than build ttie anti-war move
ment in that staying out of
classes for a day 'against the
war' is far removed from the
everyday lives and decisions
of the average student."
Hobson encouraged the stu
dents at the conference to "con
centrate on local issues show
ing how they are tied into the

war and into the society we live
in, and in this way build the
consciousness of the movement.
We don't need elite-sponsored
gimmacks that can so easily
fail."
However, Renaldo Moute, a
Latin American student, said
students in the United States
must strike "to demonstrate to
the peoples of Latin America,
Asia, and Africa that there are
those in America who still have
a conscience and who oppose
the imperalist and racist poli
cies perpetrated by the U.S. gov
ernment all over the world."
A motion to call off the strike
and to dissolve the Student
Mobilization Committee was
roundly defeated.

than 900 student activists from

America have called a world
wide student strike "against the
