# CIA Demonstrators Get Third Hearing
## 
### 
Last night the student Judicial
Council continued its hearings
of ten students accused of ille
gally demonstrating against
C.I.A. recruiters at Encina Hall
on November 1.
The meeting, an open hearing
at the request of the defendants,
attempted, in the words of Coun
cil President Richard Such, simp
ly to "get the facts." A hearing
next Monday will begin the ar
gument as to whether the ac
tions of the ten students con
stitute a violation of the Funda
mental Standard.
Last night's meeting was the
third on this case. On January
25, the Council heard Dean of
Students Joel Smith, who is pros
ecuting on behalf of the univer
sity, and Yale Braunstein, one of
the ten defendants.
Separate Review
Since the charges against him
are considered to be more seri
ous, Braunstein's case is being
reviewed separately. He is accus
ed of "behaving recklessly" and
of pushing a picket sign through
the door of Encina. The sign
barely missed Dean Smith's
head.
As are the other nine, Braun
stein is also charged with viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard.
At this time, one of the major
arguments center on Braun
stein's motives behind forcing
the picket sign through the door.
Dean Smith claims that It was

a "reckless" effort to prevent the
door from closing, so that fel
low demonstrators might enter
Encina.
Braunstein, however, contends
that he pushed the sign to pre
vent people from being crushed
as police inside attempted to
keep them out.
Blocking the entry, the univer
sity argues, constitutes a viola
tion of demonstration policy.
Fear Reversal
Originally, the Judicial Coun
cil declined to hear this case.
In light of a decision by the
Associated Students that a vio
lation of university policy is a
violation of the Fundamental
Standard, the Council feared
that an aquittal of the ten stu
dents might be reversed. Ac
cordingly, the Council requested
that Dean Smith refer the case
to the Interim Judicial Board, a
body composed of five faculty
members appointed by Presi
dent Sterling.
The defendants failed to ap
pear at their trial before the
IJB.
Early in December, ASSU re
versed its decision on the rela
tion between university policy
and the Fundamental Standard
As a result, the Judicial Council
requested that the case of the
ten students be returned to it.
On December 5, the IJB voted
3-2 to turn the case over to the
student body.
A decision is expected next
Monday night.
