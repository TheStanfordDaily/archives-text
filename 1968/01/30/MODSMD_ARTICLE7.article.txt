• Fighting In Da Nang
SAIGON (AP) — Communist
forces launched widespread at
tacks on lunar new year day,
Tuesday, including a destruc
tive docket assault on the big
U.S. fighter base at Da Nang
and strike against at least seven
government provincial capitals.
Street fighting was reported
in several of the cities, includ
ing Da Nang, the second largest
city in South Vietnam.
Unofficial reports said six
American planes valued at $12
million were destroyed and an
other damaged in the predawn
shelling of the Da Nang base,
100 miles south of the demilitar
ized zone.
Besides Da Nang, other prov
incial capitals reported attacked
by Red units were Kentum,
Pleiku and Ban Methuot in the
central highlands, and Nha
Trang, Qui Uhon and Hoi An
along the east coast.
Details of the fighting were
sketchy. A U.S. military spokes
man said only government
forces were involved in nearly
all the places under enemy at
tack.
"However," he said, "we may

be sending in U.S. reinforce
ments at any time."
The fighting made a shambles
of the truces each side had de
clared for Tet, the lunar new
year.
South Vietnamese President
Nguyen Van Thieu announced
Tuesday that the allied lunar
new year cease-fire was cancel-
Id throughout the country be
cause of wide spread Communist
Attacks.
• Korea Developments
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.
(AP) — The United States was
authoritatively reported Mon
day night to be ready to discuss
all aspects of the Korean issue
with the North Korean Commu
nists — but not as long as they
insist upon continued detention
of the U.S. intelligence ship Pue
blo and its crew.
The Soviet Union hinted that
it backed sending an invitation
to North Korea, but it was up to
that country to say whether it
would accept.
The U.S. view was described
as willing to take part in talks
at the United Nations or any
place else with North Korea on

the entire Korean issue—but not
at the price of having the Pueb
lo and its creto held for an in
definite time as hostages.
Meanwhile some Congress
members showed growing impa
tience, the White House pressed
ahead with backstage diplomatic
efforts to resolve the USS Pueb
lo crisis.
Presidential press secretary
George Christian said a number
of diplomatic channels are ac
tive, but at the same time he
said the United States is making
"prudent, orderly, and limited
deployment" of military forces
in the Korean crisis area. U.S.
troops along the North Korea-
South Korea truce line reported
Monday they beat back several
infiltration attempts from the
North.
• New Transplant?
STANFORD (AP) - A report
circulated today of a possible
second heart transplant at the

Stanford University Medical Cen
ter, but a spokesman said none
is planned in the immediate fu
ture.
Information Officer Spyros An
dreopoules said that a patient
who was rushed to Stanford
was undergoing cardiac evalu
ation with a transplant possi
bility in mind, "but no transplant
is planned in the Immediate fu
ture."
The Redwood City Tribune
had raised the possibility.
• Gambling Tax Out
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court Monday upset
the government's system of
flushing out gamblers for prose
cution when it invalidated laws
requiring them to register and
pay special taxes.
If the gamblers obey these
laws, Justice John M. Harlan
said in a 71 decision, they pro
vide evidence that could lead to
their own prosecution under

separate state and federal anti
gambling laws.
Thus, in view of the Fifth
Amendment guarantee against
self-incrimination, Harlan went
on, a gambler cannot be pun
ished for refusing on constitu
tional grounds to register or to
pay the special taxes.
With an identical vote and
identical logic, the court also
upset government procedures
for prosecuting possessors of
unregistered sawed-off shotguns,
machineguns and silencers.
• Gunman Captured
DENVER, Colo. (AP) — A
gunman, holding four persons
hostage, was captured Monday
in the Denver suburb of Aurora,
more than seven hours after he
fled from the scene of an abor
tive supermarket holdup.
The hostages were unharmed
after the wild, 250-mile ride that
started in northeast Denver

about 8 a.m., and covered a cir
cuitious, clockwise route south of
here to Colorado Springs, north
east to Limon and northwest
back toward Denver.
• Reagan Hits Unruh
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagan said Monday that Dem
ocratic Assembly Speaker Jesse
M. Unruh's plan to create an in
dependent budget department in
the legislature may be "useless
duplication."
Unruh introduced a bill Mon
day that would create an As
sembly • Senate committee to
make its own studies of state
revenue and expenses just as
Reagan's finance department
does.
The speaker's description of
the bill also contained strong
criticism of the Reagan admin
istration's finance department
in its estimates of Medi-Cal ex
penses.
• Spock Enters Plea
BOSTON (AP) — Dr. Benja
min Spock and four other men
pleaded innocent Monday to
charges of counseling young
men to avoid the draft.
The pleas, which included one

by the chaplain of Yale Univer
sity, were entered during a
brief arraignment in U.S. Dis
trict Court as demonstrators
marched outside in their suo
port.
Judge Francis J. W. Ford or
dered the defendants released in
$1,000 bail each and told law
yers for the defense and prose
cution he wanted trial to begin
by spring.
• Primary Proposed
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A
bill to give California an "open"
presidential primary election be
ginning in 1971 was introduced
Monday by Sen. Alfred E. Al
quist, D-San Jose.
A similar bill sponsored by
Alquist last year was defeated
in the Senate on a straight par
ty vote. Republicans were op
posed.
"Governor Reagan opposed
the legislation last year for fear
it would upset his single-slate
favorite son candidacy for the
Republican presidential nomina
tion," Alquist said.
• Garrison Subpoena
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagan's office today received
a request from Louisiana for
the extradition of Edgar Eugene
Bradley, charged with conspir
ing to murder the late President
John F. Kennedy.
Edwin Meese 111, Reagan's
egal affairs secretary, forward
ed the extradition papers tp the
office of Atty. Gen. Thomas C.
Lynch for legal review.
When the papers have been
approved as meeting legal re
quirements, the extradition
hearing requested by Garrison's
attorney will be scheduled.
• Stocks Fall Slightly
NEW YORK (AP) — An early
advance in the stock market
Monday reflected relief that the
Pueblo crisis had not worsened

over the weekend, but nothing
developed to sustain a rising
market and stocks ended with a
loss. Trading was fairly active.
Volume was . 9.95 million
shares compared with 9.99 mil
lion Friday.
The Dow Jones industrial av
erage fell 1.39 at 86'.67.
It was the start of another
week of shortened market ses
sions, with the final bell at 2
p.m. instead of the usual 3:30
p.m.
The Dow industrials were up
4.22 at the end of the first half
hour. After that it was all down
hill.
It was a restless, trading type
3f market, analysts said, be
cause the Street had no confi

next.

• Korea Developments
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.
(AP) — The United States was
authoritatively reported Mon
day night to be ready to discuss
all aspects of the Korean issue
with the North Korean Commu

insist upon continued detention
of the U.S. intelligence ship Pue

The Soviet Union hinted that
it backed sending an invitation
to North Korea, but it was up to
that country to say whether it

The U.S. view was described
as willing to take part in talks
at the United Nations or any

the entire Korean issue—but not
at the price of having the Pueb

Meanwhile some Congress

Presidential press secretary

• Gambling Tax Out
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court Monday upset
the government's system of
flushing out gamblers for prose

requiring them to register and
pay special taxes.
If the gamblers obey these
laws, Justice John M. Harlan
said in a 71 decision, they pro
vide evidence that could lead to
their own prosecution under

separate state and federal anti
gambling laws.
Thus, in view of the Fifth
Amendment guarantee against
self-incrimination, Harlan went
on, a gambler cannot be pun
ished for refusing on constitu
tional grounds to register or to
pay the special taxes.
With an identical vote and
identical logic, the court also
upset government procedures
for prosecuting possessors of
unregistered sawed-off shotguns,
machineguns and silencers.

UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.
(AP) — The United States was

day night to be ready to discuss
all aspects of the Korean issue
with the North Korean Commu

The Soviet Union hinted that

• Gambling Tax Out
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court Monday upset
the government's system of
flushing out gamblers for prose

requiring them to register and
pay special taxes.
If the gamblers obey these
laws, Justice John M. Harlan
said in a 71 decision, they pro
vide evidence that could lead to
their own prosecution under

separate state and federal anti
gambling laws.
Thus, in view of the Fifth
Amendment guarantee against
self-incrimination, Harlan went
on, a gambler cannot be pun
ished for refusing on constitu
tional grounds to register or to
pay the special taxes.
With an identical vote and

• Korea Developments
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y.
(AP) — The United States was
authoritatively reported Mon
day night to be ready to discuss
all aspects of the Korean issue
with the North Korean Commu
nists — but not as long as they
insist upon continued detention
of the U.S. intelligence ship Pue
blo and its crew.
The Soviet Union hinted that
it backed sending an invitation
to North Korea, but it was up to
that country to say whether it
would accept.
The U.S. view was described
as willing to take part in talks
at the United Nations or any
place else with North Korea on

the entire Korean issue—but not
at the price of having the Pueb
lo and its creto held for an in
definite time as hostages.
Meanwhile some Congress
members showed growing impa
tience, the White House pressed
ahead with backstage diplomatic
efforts to resolve the USS Pueb
lo crisis.
Presidential press secretary
George Christian said a number
of diplomatic channels are ac
tive, but at the same time he
said the United States is making
"prudent, orderly, and limited
deployment" of military forces
in the Korean crisis area. U.S.
troops along the North Korea-
South Korea truce line reported
Monday they beat back several
infiltration attempts from the
North.
• New Transplant?
STANFORD (AP) - A report

Information Officer Spyros An

• Gambling Tax Out
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Supreme Court Monday upset
the government's system of
flushing out gamblers for prose
cution when it invalidated laws
requiring them to register and
pay special taxes.
If the gamblers obey these
laws, Justice John M. Harlan
said in a 71 decision, they pro
vide evidence that could lead to
their own prosecution under

separate state and federal anti
gambling laws.
Thus, in view of the Fifth
Amendment guarantee against
self-incrimination, Harlan went
on, a gambler cannot be pun
ished for refusing on constitu
tional grounds to register or to
pay the special taxes.
With an identical vote and
identical logic, the court also
upset government procedures
for prosecuting possessors of
unregistered sawed-off shotguns,
machineguns and silencers.

DENVER, Colo. (AP) — A

back toward Denver.
• Reagan Hits Unruh
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagan said Monday that Dem

Unruh introduced a bill Mon
day that would create an As

make its own studies of state

The speaker's description of
the bill also contained strong

in its estimates of Medi-Cal ex

• Spock Enters Plea
BOSTON (AP) — Dr. Benja

NEW YORK (AP) — An early

Volume was . 9.95 million

The Dow industrials were up
