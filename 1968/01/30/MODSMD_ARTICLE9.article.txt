# Lambda Nu's Window Dressing
## 
### 
At first glance, Lambda Nu's proposal to go coed with 20
women residents next fall would appear to be a revolutionary
breakthrough for Stanford frats.
But the fraternity's plan for a one-year trial shows it doesn't
understand what coeducation is all about.
Lambda Nu would bring in the 20 women through a ran
dom draw, but it wants to keep unchanged its own selective
rush for men.
The women "associates" would not have an equal voice
with the fraternity men in house decisions. Women would be
excluded from voting on the fraternity's executive board, ac
cording to Lambda Nu's proposal. The women would be
guests, not residents.
Lambda Nu has got to realize that coeducation isn't just a
gimmick for getting boys and girls together. Stanford didn't
set up four coed "demonstration" houses last fall just to help
guys get dates. Coeducational living is part of an entirely new
approach to dealing with people; a liberal philosophy that
accepts individuals on equal terms —regardless of whether
they're male or female, hung-up or hung-down, Greek-let
tered or misanthropic.
Lambda Nu President Fred Fudacz has said "the feminine
perspective would benefit the house's intellectual and social
atmosphere." Sure, women are nice to have around—but as
people, as well as Females.
Now if Lambda Nu has really rejected the fraternity pen
chant for artificially discriminating between human beings,
that's great. By national standards Stanford frats are progres
sive, and Lambda Nu, which threw off its national affiliation
in 1965, is one of the best.
But Lambda Nu hasn't entirely escaped its heritage. It
can't. The house members must obtain the agreement of the
alumni association on major policy changes. And the alumni
would never agree to abolishing selectivity outright and per
manently opening the house without discrimination to wom
en. Lambda Nu would then no longer be a fraternity.
Lambda Nu's initiative in responding to the opportunities
of coed living shown by the four demonstration houses is
laudable. But the Dean of Students shouldn't go along with
Lambda Nu's acceptance of one tenet of a liberal residence
philosophy, while the fraternity resists the other tenets.
Lambda Nu should seek the substance of coeducation, not
the window dressing.

people, as well as Females.
Now if Lambda Nu has really rejected the fraternity pen
chant for artificially discriminating between human beings,
that's great. By national standards Stanford frats are progres
sive, and Lambda Nu, which threw off its national affiliation
in 1965, is one of the best.
But Lambda Nu hasn't entirely escaped its heritage. It
can't. The house members must obtain the agreement of the
alumni association on major policy changes. And the alumni
would never agree to abolishing selectivity outright and per
manently opening the house without discrimination to wom
en. Lambda Nu would then no longer be a fraternity.
Lambda Nu's initiative in responding to the opportunities
of coed living shown by the four demonstration houses is
laudable. But the Dean of Students shouldn't go along with
Lambda Nu's acceptance of one tenet of a liberal residence
philosophy, while the fraternity resists the other tenets.
Lambda Nu should seek the substance of coeducation, not
the window dressing.
