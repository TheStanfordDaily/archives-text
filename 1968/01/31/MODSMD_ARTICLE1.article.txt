SAIGON (AP) — A Viet Cong
suicide squad seized and held
parts of the U.S. Embassy in
the heart of Saigon for six hours
Wednesday before being wiped
out by American forces.
Paratroopers swarmed out of
helicopters landing on the roof
of the eight-story building to
battle the invaders to the end
and lift the siege.
All the bold Viet Cong In
truders died In the embassy
battle, climaxing a series of
guerrilla assaults and shellings
in Saigon that brought limited
warfare deep into the South
Vietnamese capital.
Gen. William C. Westmore
land, U.S. commander in Viet

nam, said "the enemy's well
laid plans went afoul," and list
ed 19 Viet Cong bodies found on
the premises.
He said one U.S. Marine was
killed and five were wounded
and that seven U.S. military po
licemen wene killed or wounded,
of whom he thought four were
dead.
Trapped in his two-story
frame house in the embassy
compound, a senior U.S. diplo
mat, mission coordinator George
Jacobsen, 56, fought a duel with
one of the Viet Cong, killing him
with a pistol thrown to him
from the outside. Jacobson is
a retired U.S. Army colonel.
Simultaneously with the
strikes against Saigon, the
Beds for the second straight
day attacked cities up and
down the country in an un
precedented explosion of guer
rilla warfare against urban
centers.
Aside from their propaganda
impact, the Red attacks ap
peared aimed at diverting allied
strength from the northern
provinces where a major battle
seemed imminent.
Visiting the embassy shortly
aften U.S. forces regained con
trol, Gen. Westmoreland said
the Viet Cong did not get
the building itself.
However, dozens of persons
on the scene said some of the
Viet Cong were in the lower
floors of the main building.
The lower floor of the embas
sy building was a mass of tan
gled debris and there were four
gaping holes in the front wall
left by rocket rounds.
Two hours after the U.S.
troops had recaptured control
of the embassy, the bodies of
two Viet Cong still were lying
only a few yards from a blast-

Ed hole in the wall where they
had entered the compound.
From Washington, President
Johnson kept in close communi
cation with military and diplo
matic leaders in Saigon through
out the Viet Cong assault on the
embassy.
Among the key buildings at
tacked in Saigon were Independ
ence Palace, where President
Ngusen Van Thieu has offices.
Also shelled or attacked with
small-arms fine were the build
ing of the Vietnamese joint
chiefs of staff, Vietnamese navy
headquarters, three U.S. offi
cers' billets, the Philippine Em
bassy and the vicinity of Tan
Son Nhut Air Base.
Westmoreland said that in
the countryside outside Saigon
there were a number of efforts
to damage or destroy airfields
with mortar and rocket fire
and ground attacks.
Westmoreland said first re
ports indicated two aircraft
were detroyed at Bien Hea, but
were some shellings at
Can Tho and other areas of the
Mekong Delta south of Saigon.
Westmoreland told newsmen,
"Obviously the enemy had been

planning the assault on the
American Embassy for some
time. They chose the Tet-lunar
new yean-period for this as
sault. The enemy obviously as
sumed the security would be
lessened during this period.
"Through this hole, a platoon
of enemy soldiers, disguised in
civilian dress, came inside the
embassy compound. They had
infiltrated into the city and were
armed with satchel charges and
demolitions. With the demoli
tions, they tried to demolish it
— the embassy."
About two companies of U.S.
military police tried to take the
embassy compound at daybreak
Wednesday but were driven off
in their first attempt, fleports
from the scene said. A company
of the U.E. 101st Airborne Divi
sion then was rushed in.
As these forces inched for
ward in bloody fighting, the hel
icopter assault began about 8:35
a.m.
About a dozen clattering heli
copters swaaped in over the
rooftops of downtown Saigon to
unload the 101st Airborne troops
on the roof of the gleaming,
white, eight-story building.
