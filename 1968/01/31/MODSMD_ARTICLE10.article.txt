# Our Man Hopper
## Speed Rushes Man To Death 
### Art Hoppe 
Once upon a time there was
a very ordinary young man
named Harlington Hoops, who
rode a bicycle, played an ocha
rina and worked eight hard
hours a day making trout flies.
The sale of his trout flies pro
vided Harlington with a com
fortable living. In the evenings
he would curl up before the fire
with his ocharina or a good book.
And Sundays were devoted to lei
surely circling the park three
times on his bicycle.
But he wasn't happy.
"Life is a drag," said Harling
ton. "It takes such a long time
to live it. And though I'm busy
from dawn to dusk, I just don't
seem to be getting anywhere."
So he took a course in Speed
Reading.

Harlington turned out to have
a phenomenal ability for Speed
Reading. In no time, he was read
ing 100,000 words a minute.
"It's marvelous," he told his
friends happily. "I came down
to breakfast this morning, read
the paper and three volumes of
Gibbons and by that time the
coffee had perked."
So proficient did he become
that he was able to pick up a
book, fan the pages hnd compre
hend every nuance of every
phrase. Indeed, in six weeks he
had fanned through every book
in the library including indexes,
footnotes and glossaries.
This left him nothing to do
in the eventings but play the
ocharina. "If I so easily master
ed Speed Reading," said Harl
ington thoughtfully, "surely I

could easily master another
skill."
So he took up Speed Listen
ing.
He trained himself by playing
his tape recorder at ever faster
speeds until finally he was able
to listen to Beethoven's entire
fifth Symphony in 12.2 seconds,
comprehending every tonal shad
ing and intricate counterpoint.
Speed Seeing followed. Thanks
to his superbly developed eye
muscles and a little self-teaching
he soon could do any art mu
seum, from Etruscan to abstract,
on roller skates and he was able
to milk the last iota of aesthetic
pleasure from a sunset at sea
or a mountain meadow in one
second flat.
He speeded up his electric
shaver, his electric shoe polish
er and his electric toothbrush.
He mastered Spred Cooking and
Speed Eating, downing a gour
met meal in two seconds and
savoring it in another.
Through Speed Fly Tying he
was able to make all the flies
the market would bear in 33 min
utes a day and, through Speed
Sleeping, get all the sleep he
could use in two hours and 18
minutes a night.
By swapping his bicycle for
a 600-horsepower Borsolino (cq)
with overhead cams, he was able
to circle the park thrice on Sun
days in the same time it used to
take him to put on his trouser
clips.
The dramatic highlight of his
n 'w life came when he fell in
love with a girl at the super
market, speedily wooed her in
frozen foods, speedily betrothed
her at the check-out counter,
sppedily married her at the Little
Church Around the Corner and
speedily divorced her two blocks
later at the City Hall after speed
ily discovering that she was a
slow walker with a Southern
drawl.
"But at least," said Harlington
proudly, "I have speeded up my
life to the ultimate. I now need
only four hours and 47 minutes
a day for sleeping, eating, work
ing, grooming, seeing, listening,
reading and enjoying.
"The only question now," he
added with a frown, "is what on
earth am I going to do with my
leisure time?"
It was a question Harlington
never resolved. Slowly he fell ill,
slowly his strength ebbed and
slowly he died. An autopsy show
ed he was bored to death.

Moral: Life is a long time. But
considering where it gets you,
why hurry?
