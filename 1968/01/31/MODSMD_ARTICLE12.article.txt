Headmistress Foo is a vigor
ous woman about fifty years
old.
Fei Por Hung, a village made
of tin, pieces of board, and bur
lap, fills the crevice between two
hills. Although it is in a busy
industrial section of the Kow
loon peninsula, it is invisible to
the passer-by, for the path to it
starts at the back of a modern
looking factory which blocks a
view from the boulevard in
front. Water is supplied by chil
dren balancing buckets they fill
at the village well; candles and
lanterns provide light.
When headmistress Foo first
went there four years ago, she
asked the boys she found fight
ing in the lanes why they
weren't in school. There was no
school near-by, they said, and
they could afford money for
neither transportation nor
school fees.
Headmistress Foo and sev

en teachers have been provid
ing 200-300 of the village chil
dren with a primary education
at a nominal cost For the
very poor, she has provided
instruction, books, and a daily
lunch for less than $1 U.S.
per month.
The villagers have come to
trust her, and seek her help
when they have problems. The
shopkeepers of the village, for
example, depended on her to
help them get their shop re
settlement allocations which
they had been deprived of
through bribery. The govern
ment has decided to resettle
Fei Por Hung—to take people
from their huts and place them
in bee-hive "resettlement es
tates," with up to five adults
(a child is half an adult) in a
room 10 feet by 12 feet.
But there are adjustment dif
ficulties: in some cases there
are not enough places in the re
settlement schools for the chil
dren; in other cases, the fees
are too high. Headmistress Foo
wants to move her school with
the village, and the government
has agreed to give her land, but
she must build the school her
self.
Education is an Important
means of giving people here
the ability to make a better
life for themselves.
