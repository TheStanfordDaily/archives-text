• Wilson Sees Talks
LONDON (AP) — Prime Min
ister Harold Wilson contended
Tuesday that very little in their
public stances now separates the
United States and North Viet
nam from a peace parley.
Wilson, home from Moscow
last week, suggested in the
House of Commons an exchange
of assurances between Washing
ton and Hanoi.
Answering questioners, the
British leader said he will seek
to persuade President Johnson,
as he has urged the Russians to
persuade Hanoi, "to cross the
narrow bridge that remains."
Wilson reaffirmed his govern
ment's backing for the U.S. ap
proach to peace talks spelled
out by the President in San An
tonio, Tex., last fall.
Most of Wilson's two-day
meeting with Premier Alexei N.
Kosygin in Moscow was taken
up with studies of precisely how
peace talks could be organized
quickly.
"There Is now very little be
tween the two sides as far as
public declarations are con
cerned," Wilson told Commons.
"I think the Americans have
a right to be assured this action
peace talks will follow the cessa
tion of the bombing—and North
Vietnam has a right to be as
sured that the Americans will
cease the bombing if this con
ference follows.
• Campus Punishment
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Uni
versity of California officials de
clared today that protestors who
disrupt campuses should be pun
ished under campus regulations
—rather than prosecuted in the
courts.
Charles Young, the vice chan
cellor of the University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles, said the
students were punished by the
campus for breaking regulations
in their protest against Dow
Chemical Co. If they had been
prosecuted in Los Angeles
courts, he said, UCLA would
have become "a sea of chaos."
Students and faculty were
also told that campus unrest is
making it "much more difficult"
for legislators to provide needed
money.
• Bodies TJ ncovered
CUMMINS PRISON FARM,
Ark. (AP) — A hulking 30-year
convict who led prison officials
to an unmarked graveyard in
which three skeletons were
found here Monday said today
he had helped bury "10 or 12"
inmates on the prison grounds
in the 19405.
Rueben Johnson, 59, said he
believed there were 2,000 per
sons buried at Cummins, and he
told newsmen, "If y'all will look
at the ground, you would say
the same thing."
Dr. Edwin Barren Jr. of Little

Rock, the prison physician, said
after the skeletons of three men
were uncovered in crude wood
en coffins Monday afternoon
that an investigation started by
Prison Supt. Thomas O. Murton
might turn up "as many as 100,
if not more" bodies.
Digging operations, which
were to have resumed today,
were halted for the time being
as State Police took charge of
the investigation.
"We will continue to dig as
long as we have graves to dig,"
said Murten, who had ordered
the search of the prison grounds
to check convict reports that in
mates had been killed and se
cretly buried at the prison
through the years.
"I feel reasonably certain that
there are more bodies out
there," Barron said.
Discovery of the bodies was
the latest in a series of revela
tions about Arkansas prison
conditions that have shocked the
state and the world.
• RFK: No Primaries
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy (D, N.Y.),
said Tuesday he has told friends
and associates that he will not
oppose President Johnson in
presidential primaries under
any foreseeable circumstances.
Kennedy did not spell out to
reporters the nature of circum
stances that might cause him to
change his mind. But it was in
dicated that developments in the
Vietnam war may have a great
deal to do with his thinking.
The New York senator has
been under pressure to make an
open break with Johnson. He
has said he will campaign for
Johnson if the President is nom
inated fop a second elective
term, despite their differences
over Vietnam.
Although he has said he is
sympathetic with the foreign
policy views of Sen. Eugene J.
McCarthy (D., Minn), Kennedy
has declined to aid in the Minne
sota senator's primary cam
paign against Johnson.
• Strike Violence
WALNUT CREEK (AP)—Vi
olence, possibly linked to the
Los Angeles Herald-Examiner
strike, wrecked a San Francisco
Bay suburban newspaper print
ing plant Tuesday.
A mob of 35 or 40 men
smashed typesetting machines,
damaged a press, wrecked
photoengraving equipment and
dumped type prepared for the
days editions of the Contra
Costa Times and the Concord
Transcript.
Dean Lesher, publisher of the
papers and owner of the non
union shop, said he understood
"the theory is that we have been
helping the Los Angeles Herald-
Examiner, which is untrue."
"We have no connection what

soever with the Los Angeles or
San Francisco newspaper
strikes," Lesher said.
The San Francisco strike has
been peaceful. But violence has
erupted in Los Angeles.
• Loan Change Asked
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres
ident Johnson asked Congress
today to revise the GI home
loan program so veterans can
buy better, more expensive
houses.
In a special message, Johnson
also called for a new law to help
subsidize veterans who train
themselves for teaching, police
and fire fighting work, hospital
employment and jobs in the an
tipoverty program. This would
cost $50 million in the 12 months
beginning July 1.
The chief executive urged that
the maximum guarantee on GI
home loans be increased to
$10,000 from $7,500. These guar
antees normally cover about 35
per cent of the value of a loan,
which means a higher guaraiftee
would make available larger
loans for better houses.
The President said his pro
posed Veterans in the Public
Service Act would "provide in
centives to channel the talents
of the veterans to the most ur
gent needs of rural and urban
America."
• Israel, Egypt Clash
PORT SAID, Egypt (AP) —
Israeli forces opened fire on four
Egyptian launches today as they
prepared to make a search for
obstacles in the northern end of
the Suez Canal that bar the re
lease of 16 foreign ships.
Egyptian official circles said
that while the original plan was
to clear away the southern sec
tion of the canal to free the
ships, so many obstacles were
found that it was believed easier
to open the north portion.
Israel had warned that it
would permit no survey of the
northern section, considering
that a violation of the agree
ment ending the June war.
• Glamor Stocks Hit
NEW YORK (AP) — Glamor
stocks were hit hard as the
stock market took a loss today in
active trading.
Volume was 10.12 million
shares compared with 9.95 mil
lion Monday — both shortened
sessions.
The Dow Jones industrial aver
age fell 4.10 to 859.57.
The session began in a trend
less fashion, with most changes
small and no group action
worth talking about. The list
was befogged by uncertainties,
foreign and domestic.
Before the morning was over,
traders began to dump some of
the higher-priced conglomerate,
computer and electronic issues
and selling spread to blue chips.

CUMMINS PRISON FARM,

convict who led prison officials
to an unmarked graveyard in
which three skeletons were
found here Monday said today
he had helped bury "10 or 12"
inmates on the prison grounds
in the 19405.
Rueben Johnson, 59, said he
believed there were 2,000 per

told newsmen, "If y'all will look

the same thing."
Dr. Edwin Barren Jr. of Little

after the skeletons of three men
were uncovered in crude wood
en coffins Monday afternoon
that an investigation started by
Prison Supt. Thomas O. Murton
might turn up "as many as 100,
if not more" bodies.
Digging operations, which
were to have resumed today,
were halted for the time being
as State Police took charge of
the investigation.
"We will continue to dig as
long as we have graves to dig,"
said Murten, who had ordered
the search of the prison grounds
to check convict reports that in
mates had been killed and se
cretly buried at the prison
through the years.
"I feel reasonably certain that
there are more bodies out
there," Barron said.
Discovery of the bodies was

• Loan Change Asked
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres

today to revise the GI home
loan program so veterans can
buy better, more expensive
houses.
In a special message, Johnson
also called for a new law to help
subsidize veterans who train
themselves for teaching, police
and fire fighting work, hospital
employment and jobs in the an

cost $50 million in the 12 months
beginning July 1.
The chief executive urged that
the maximum guarantee on GI
home loans be increased to
$10,000 from $7,500. These guar
antees normally cover about 35
per cent of the value of a loan,
which means a higher guaraiftee
would make available larger
loans for better houses.
The President said his pro

LONDON (AP) — Prime Min

Tuesday that very little in their

Wilson, home from Moscow

House of Commons an exchange
of assurances between Washing

out by the President in San An

• Loan Change Asked
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres

today to revise the GI home
loan program so veterans can
buy better, more expensive
houses.
In a special message, Johnson
also called for a new law to help
subsidize veterans who train
themselves for teaching, police
and fire fighting work, hospital
employment and jobs in the an
tipoverty program. This would
cost $50 million in the 12 months
beginning July 1.
The chief executive urged that
the maximum guarantee on GI
home loans be increased to
$10,000 from $7,500. These guar
antees normally cover about 35
per cent of the value of a loan,
which means a higher guaraiftee
would make available larger
loans for better houses.
The President said his pro

• Wilson Sees Talks
LONDON (AP) — Prime Min
ister Harold Wilson contended
Tuesday that very little in their
public stances now separates the
United States and North Viet
nam from a peace parley.
Wilson, home from Moscow
last week, suggested in the
House of Commons an exchange
of assurances between Washing
ton and Hanoi.
Answering questioners, the
British leader said he will seek
to persuade President Johnson,
as he has urged the Russians to
persuade Hanoi, "to cross the
narrow bridge that remains."
Wilson reaffirmed his govern
ment's backing for the U.S. ap
proach to peace talks spelled
out by the President in San An
tonio, Tex., last fall.
Most of Wilson's two-day
meeting with Premier Alexei N.
Kosygin in Moscow was taken
up with studies of precisely how
peace talks could be organized
quickly.
"There Is now very little be
tween the two sides as far as
public declarations are con
cerned," Wilson told Commons.
"I think the Americans have
a right to be assured this action
peace talks will follow the cessa

• Loan Change Asked
WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres
ident Johnson asked Congress
today to revise the GI home
loan program so veterans can
buy better, more expensive
houses.
In a special message, Johnson
also called for a new law to help
subsidize veterans who train
themselves for teaching, police
and fire fighting work, hospital
employment and jobs in the an
tipoverty program. This would
cost $50 million in the 12 months
beginning July 1.
The chief executive urged that
the maximum guarantee on GI
home loans be increased to
$10,000 from $7,500. These guar
antees normally cover about 35
per cent of the value of a loan,
which means a higher guaraiftee
would make available larger
loans for better houses.
The President said his pro
posed Veterans in the Public
Service Act would "provide in
centives to channel the talents
of the veterans to the most ur
gent needs of rural and urban
America."
• Israel, Egypt Clash
PORT SAID, Egypt (AP) —
Israeli forces opened fire on four
Egyptian launches today as they
prepared to make a search for
obstacles in the northern end of
the Suez Canal that bar the re
lease of 16 foreign ships.
Egyptian official circles said
that while the original plan was
to clear away the southern sec
tion of the canal to free the
ships, so many obstacles were
found that it was believed easier
to open the north portion.
Israel had warned that it
would permit no survey of the
northern section, considering
that a violation of the agree
ment ending the June war.

• Wilson Sees Talks
LONDON (AP) — Prime Min
ister Harold Wilson contended
Tuesday that very little in their
public stances now separates the
United States and North Viet
nam from a peace parley.
Wilson, home from Moscow
last week, suggested in the
House of Commons an exchange
of assurances between Washing
ton and Hanoi.
Answering questioners, the
British leader said he will seek
to persuade President Johnson,
as he has urged the Russians to
persuade Hanoi, "to cross the
narrow bridge that remains."
Wilson reaffirmed his govern
ment's backing for the U.S. ap
proach to peace talks spelled
out by the President in San An
tonio, Tex., last fall.
Most of Wilson's two-day
meeting with Premier Alexei N.
Kosygin in Moscow was taken
up with studies of precisely how
peace talks could be organized
quickly.
"There Is now very little be
tween the two sides as far as
public declarations are con
cerned," Wilson told Commons.
"I think the Americans have
a right to be assured this action
peace talks will follow the cessa
tion of the bombing—and North
Vietnam has a right to be as
sured that the Americans will
cease the bombing if this con
ference follows.
• Campus Punishment
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Uni
versity of California officials de
clared today that protestors who
disrupt campuses should be pun
ished under campus regulations
—rather than prosecuted in the
courts.
Charles Young, the vice chan
cellor of the University of Cali
fornia at Los Angeles, said the
students were punished by the
campus for breaking regulations
in their protest against Dow
Chemical Co. If they had been
prosecuted in Los Angeles
courts, he said, UCLA would
have become "a sea of chaos."
Students and faculty were
also told that campus unrest is
making it "much more difficult"
for legislators to provide needed
money.
• Bodies TJ ncovered
CUMMINS PRISON FARM,
Ark. (AP) — A hulking 30-year
convict who led prison officials
to an unmarked graveyard in
which three skeletons were
found here Monday said today
he had helped bury "10 or 12"
inmates on the prison grounds
in the 19405.
Rueben Johnson, 59, said he
believed there were 2,000 per
sons buried at Cummins, and he
told newsmen, "If y'all will look
at the ground, you would say
the same thing."
Dr. Edwin Barren Jr. of Little

Rock, the prison physician, said
after the skeletons of three men
were uncovered in crude wood
en coffins Monday afternoon
that an investigation started by
Prison Supt. Thomas O. Murton
might turn up "as many as 100,
if not more" bodies.
Digging operations, which
were to have resumed today,
were halted for the time being
as State Police took charge of
the investigation.
"We will continue to dig as
long as we have graves to dig,"
said Murten, who had ordered
the search of the prison grounds
to check convict reports that in
mates had been killed and se
cretly buried at the prison
through the years.
"I feel reasonably certain that
there are more bodies out
there," Barron said.
Discovery of the bodies was
the latest in a series of revela
tions about Arkansas prison
conditions that have shocked the
state and the world.
• RFK: No Primaries
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen.
Robert F. Kennedy (D, N.Y.),
said Tuesday he has told friends
and associates that he will not
oppose President Johnson in
presidential primaries under
any foreseeable circumstances.
Kennedy did not spell out to
reporters the nature of circum
stances that might cause him to
change his mind. But it was in
dicated that developments in the
Vietnam war may have a great
deal to do with his thinking.
The New York senator has
been under pressure to make an
open break with Johnson. He
has said he will campaign for
Johnson if the President is nom
inated fop a second elective
term, despite their differences
over Vietnam.
Although he has said he is
sympathetic with the foreign
policy views of Sen. Eugene J.
McCarthy (D., Minn), Kennedy
has declined to aid in the Minne
