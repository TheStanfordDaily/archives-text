# Emeritus Predicts Surtax Approval
## 
### 
President Johnson probably
will get his tax surcharge
through Congress, effective Apr.
1, Emeritus Prof. Theodore J.
Kreps predicted Tuesday.
Defense expenditures will rise
$3 or $4 billion — a much small
er increase than the $13 billion
gain last year, he added.
Prof. Kreps, a teacher of
business economics for much
of his 33 years on the faculty
of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business, empha
sized that he based his predic
tions on the expectation that
the Vietnam war would con
tinue through 1968.
The tax boost will elicit an ad
ditional $3 billion from individ
uals and $3.5 billion from cor
porations, Prof. Kreps said.
The 1968 Gross National Prod
uct will hit $842.5 billion, up $57
billion over the past year, and
consumer spending will total
about $525 billion for durable
goods such as autos and ap
pliances, up from $493 billion.
Expenses for non - durable
goods, such as clothing and oth
er woven materials, will be up
$1.8 billion to $232.5 billion.
Wages will rise because 1.8
million more workers will enter
the labor market and 1968's dis
posable income — money earn
ed by all workers — will top
out at $574.4 billion, Prof. Kreps
predicted.
In the housing market, in
terest rates will stay high but
mortgage money will be avail
able. Housing starts will be
reflected by the number of
"heads of households" whose
age bracket is in the early
30's.
"This is because these 'de
pression kids' of the middle
1930's have now reached the age
when they can move from apart

ments to homes of their own, but
there are not as many of them
as there will be."
He predicted that the next big
housing boom will cover 1976
through 1983, when the young
men and women of today reach
the same age bracket and begin
to settle down in homes.
Price increases will be ap
parent but the effect on the cost
of living will not be as sharp as
might be expected, according to
Prof. Kreps, a noted govern
mental and business consultant.
His predictions were offered
to the monthly meeting of the
Stanford Distaff Club, composed
of women staff members.

as there will be."
He predicted that the next big
housing boom will cover 1976
through 1983, when the young
men and women of today reach
the same age bracket and begin
to settle down in homes.
Price increases will be ap
parent but the effect on the cost
of living will not be as sharp as
might be expected, according to
Prof. Kreps, a noted govern
mental and business consultant.
His predictions were offered
to the monthly meeting of the
Stanford Distaff Club, composed
of women staff members.
President Johnson probably
will get his tax surcharge
through Congress, effective Apr.
1, Emeritus Prof. Theodore J.
Kreps predicted Tuesday.
Defense expenditures will rise
$3 or $4 billion — a much small
er increase than the $13 billion
gain last year, he added.
Prof. Kreps, a teacher of
business economics for much
of his 33 years on the faculty
of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business, empha
sized that he based his predic
tions on the expectation that
the Vietnam war would con
tinue through 1968.
The tax boost will elicit an ad
ditional $3 billion from individ
uals and $3.5 billion from cor
porations, Prof. Kreps said.
The 1968 Gross National Prod
uct will hit $842.5 billion, up $57
billion over the past year, and
consumer spending will total
about $525 billion for durable
goods such as autos and ap
pliances, up from $493 billion.
Expenses for non - durable
goods, such as clothing and oth
er woven materials, will be up
$1.8 billion to $232.5 billion.
Wages will rise because 1.8
million more workers will enter
the labor market and 1968's dis
posable income — money earn
ed by all workers — will top
out at $574.4 billion, Prof. Kreps
predicted.
In the housing market, in
terest rates will stay high but
mortgage money will be avail
able. Housing starts will be
reflected by the number of
"heads of households" whose
age bracket is in the early
30's.
"This is because these 'de
pression kids' of the middle
1930's have now reached the age
when they can move from apart

ments to homes of their own, but
there are not as many of them
as there will be."
