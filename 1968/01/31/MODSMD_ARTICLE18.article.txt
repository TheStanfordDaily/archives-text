# Johnson Cuts College Aid
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS)—Presi
dent Johnson has asked Congress
for modest increases in federal
student aid programs during
fiscal 1969, but the increases will
be offset by severe reductions in
higher education construction
funds.
In his budget message sent
to Congress today, the President
requested an increase of $112
million for existing student fin

ancial aid programs. But the
budget shows a decrease of $82
million in the amount of federal
funds for construction grants
to colleges.
The administration's budget
also asks $23 million for pro
posed new legislation in the
area of federal assistance to
students.
This apparently refers to Pres
ident Johnson's promise in his
state of the union message that

he will recommend passage of
an education opportunity act "to
step up our drive to break down
financial barriers separating our
young people from college."
Details of this $23 million stu
dent aid legislation will be in
cluded in the President's educa
tion message, which will be sent
to Congress within the next few
weeks.
The administration's 1969 bud
get request also includes an in

crease of about $86 million for
education research in the office
of education, and an increase of
nearly $70 million for teacher
training.
About $18 million of the in
crease for teacher training is
designated for expanding the
teacher corps, which received a
severe financial beating by con
gress this year.
If the President's request is
accepted by Congress, the pres
ent teacher corps of 1,000 mem
bers would be expanded to bring
1,500 new members into the pro
gram this coming summer and
1,500 more in the summer of
1969 for a total of nearly 4,000
corps members by the end of
fiscal 1969.
Despite these increases, the
budget outlook for education
in fiscal 1969 remains gloomy
for two major reasons:
• As a result of the rising
costs of the war in Vietnam, a
fiscally conservative mood pre
vails in Congress, and cutbacks
are expected in nearly all of the
administration's requests.
• Higher education presently
is suffering not only from the
lack of sufficient appropriations
in fiscal 1968, but also from the
across-the-board cutbacks in
federal spending ordered by Con
gress late last year. Higher edu
cation construction funds, for ex
ample, were cut by about $150
million this year, about one-third
of the entire year's budget.
Wilbur Cohen, undersecretary
of the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare, describ
ed the administration's budget
request as "large but constrain
ed." He said the administration
decided to give priority to "pro
grams involving people and re
search rather than to bricks and
mortar."
Cohen conceded that the un

met needs in oducation "a»-p ve**"
great," and he added, "there will
be unmet needs for years to
come. But this budget will enable
us to continue the forward
thrust in the major programs."
The increases in federal aid
to students are spread over a
number of different programs,
resulting In only modest In
creases for each program.
The 1969 program level for
higher education construction
grants under the administra
tion's budget totals $255.6 mil
lion. Of the total, $200 million
will support 470 new projects
for undergraduate academic fa
cilities and public community
colleges and technical institutes,
and $25.6 million will support
about 33 graduate facility proj
ects.
Other major increases for
higher education include $5 mil
lion for strengthening develop
ing institutions and $8 million
for inter-institutional sharing of
resources.
Developing institutions include
the many small Negro colleges
and other schools which benefit,
from cooperative relationships
— including exchange of facili
ties — with larger universities.
And under proposed legislation,
Congress will be requested to
authorize support for the shar
ing of college and university re
sources, especially those requir
ing large investments for spe
cialized libraries, computer ser
vices, and curriculum develop
ment.
