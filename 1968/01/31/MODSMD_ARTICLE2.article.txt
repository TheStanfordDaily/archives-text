# Letter To Sterling
## Branner Lauds Coed Living 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The freshman residents of co
educational Branner hall have
asked the University to reorga
nize campus housing so coed
living will "be an option for all
Stanford undergraduates in the
coming school year."
In a letter signed by all 174
men and women, including spon
sors, Branner tells President
Wallace Sterling "there is much
to be gained in a coed dormitory
that cannot be found in other
housing available to us."
Copies of the letter were sent
Monday to Dean of Students
Joel Smith and the Study of Ed
ucation (SES) Residence com
mittee, which is now preparing
proposals for next year's hous
ing.
Branner faculty residents
Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence A.
Bennigson sent a memoran
dum to Smith and Residence
Committee chairman Lewis
Spitz saying "We agree whole
heartedly in both spirit and
letter with this statement by
the students. . . . We feel that
the coeducational residence
experience at Branner has
been an unqualified success."
Branner, formerly a dormitory
for freshmen women, was made
coed starting last September.
Two houses in Wilbur hall and
two in Stern hall also became
coed as part of a one-year ex
periment. These "integrated"
houses have men and women
from all four undergraduate
classes.
Unless the University remod
els more dormitories to house
both men and women, only a
few of the Branner freshmen
can expect to get into the exist
ing coed residences next fall.
This was the concern of the
three Branner freshmen who cir
culated the petition — Steve
Abrams, of Park Forest, 111.;
Philip McDonald, of San Diego;

and David Fidanque, of New
York City.
The three hope the Branner
letter will be "just one more
thing" to influence the Univer
sity to expand coed housing.
"After living there for one
quarter it seems so natural,"
Fldanque explained. "Every,
one should have the oppor
tunity.
The unanimous support of
Branner residents pleased the
organizers but didn't surprise
them. "I thought we'd get about
everybody," McDonald com
mented.
But the 100 per cent agree
ment that all undergraduates
should have the coed "option"
doesn't mean all the Branner
freshmen want to remain in a
coed residence next year, Ab
rams pointed out.
"There are a few people who
would like to try other situa
tions," he said. "Some guys
would like to move into a fra
ternity." McDonald added that
some Branner women feel the
stresses of coed housing out
weight the advantages.
But all 97 Frosh men and 63
women endorsed the letter's
statement that "Our stay here
has been most rewarding and
valuable, and our friendships
have been informal yet mean
ingful. We extend our sincere
appreciation to those who have
made this experience possible."
In the random draw last sum
mer to assign freshmen to dor
mitories, Branner was by far
the most popular choice.
A comprehensive survey of
student housing preferences,
due for completion this week
by a Dean's office committee,
shows many more undergrad
uates want to move Into coed
dormitories than can now be
accommodated.
Presently 520 undergraduates
live in coed housing on campus.

Total undergraduate enrollment
is about 5,900, with 3,921 living
in University residences or fra
ternities.
The Branner freshmen assert
that their coed experiment has
been an "unqualified success."
Abrams debunks the "party"
image some students have of
Branner life, pointing out that
the Branner grade point aver
age (GPA) autumn quarter,
2.86, was higher than the GPAs
of the single-sex freshman dor
mitories, Wilbur (2.76) and Ro
ble (2.83).
"Everyone was mature from
the start in this thing — they
adjusted to it immediately," Fi
danque added. McDonald com

mented, "Nobody watches TV,
because there are more inter
esting things going on."
Abrams and Fidanque com
pare Branner favorably to Wil
bur, citing the noise and rowdi
ness of the all-male houses.
"Branner is very quiet," Abrams
claimed.
"Over in Wilbur guys invite
girls over for study dates just
to have them around—in Bran
ner girls are always there," Fi
danque said. "If a girl doesn't
have a date on Saturday night
she isn't at all ashamed to go
down to the lounge and read,"
McDonald commented.
