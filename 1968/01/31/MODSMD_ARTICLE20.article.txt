# New FCC Ruling Endangers KZSU
## 
### DAVE LOMBARDI 
The future of KZSU, Stan
ford's student radio station, as
well as all ten watt FM stations
is uncertain because of a Fed
eral Communications Commis
sion (FCC) plan to eventually
eliminate all such low power in
stallations.
John Semion, 1967 manager of
KZSU, received a notice of in
quiry from the FCC early last
year that told of their plans to
phase out ten watt stations to
make room on the FM bands
for higher power stations.
The FCC offered no alterna
tives except a power raise to
1,000 watts or removal from
the air, according to Semion.
In his reply to the FCC letter,
Semion proposed point by point
alternatives that would either
eliminate the need to raise low
power stations or demonstrated
the impracticality of such a
move.
There has been no response
from the FCC since KZSU sent
their reply in February 1967.
The FCC move similarly af
fected low power stations across
the nation. WPKN of the Uni
versity of Bridgeport and WESU
of Wesleyan have undertaken
the expensive task of raising
their power output and will be

functioning at the stated 1,000
watt minimum. Such renovation
for KZSU would cost thousands
of dollars.
This is the second of KZSU's
problems with the FCC since
1946 when the station originally
went on the air. The first came
in 1958 when the station was in
definitely suspended for opera
ting its AM signal with more
power than was legally allowed.
The power adjustment is now
closely watched by station per
sonnel.
KZSU's closed circuit AM
system transmits to univer
sity dormitories and buildings
through the existing electrical
wiring systems within the
structures.
Shortly after KZSU's rein
statement by the FCC in Au
tumn quarter 1959, the FM
broadcast idea was approved by
a student-faculty committee and
application was made for an FM
license.
KZSU broadcasts from 4:00
p.m. to 1:00 a.m. on weekdays
and somewhat longer on week
ends. Regular portions of this
time are set aside for various
types of music and two-and-one
half hours are devoted to Uni
versity-oriented talk program
ming.
