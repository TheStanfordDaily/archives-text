# Tribe Grapplers Smash UC Davis
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
Stanford's wrestlers returned,
rebounded from a discouraging
road trip and scored a convinc
ing win over UC Davis Satur
day, despite giving away ten
quick points on forfeits in the
115 and 130 pounds divisions.
The Tribe won eight of the
nine matches, five by falls.
Tom Hazelton started things
off with an 8-5 decision over his
man in the 123 division, and

Mike Pete kept the ball rolling
at 137 with an 8-3 win.
Three Straight Pins
Brian Smith at 145 picked up
the pace with a pin, and Bill
Vogelpohl (152) and Len Borch
ers (160), not to be outdone,
immediately followed suit and
the parade of pins continued.
UC Davis, by this time bloat
ed from their conitnued diet of
canvas, then toughened and
Burt Ambler could "only" score
a 12-5 decision.

The Davis boys finally broke
into the victory column
when fast-improving Bill Ross
was nosed out in an 8-7 decision
at 177. Coach Dave Reed said
that Ross had wrestled well,
however.
The score at that point stood
at 24-13 with two events to go,
so the best UCD could hope for
was a narrow 24-23 loss.
28 Second Pin
However, co-captain Terry
Crenshaw took exactly 28 sec
onds to wipe out any hopes of
a respectable showing by Davis.
That was the time it took for his
191 opponent to find himself flat
on his back and pinned.

Heavyweight Ben Shaver then
mopped up the final match of
the day with a fall.
Coach Pleased
Coach Reed was very en
couraged by the showing of the
Stanford grapplers, and is now
looking forward to next week
nd's match with SF State. He
predicts a close match, the out
come of which should be deter
mined by the lower weight
classes. The heavier men, led by
stalwarts Borchers and Cren
shaw, should be able to pick up
their share of points.
Reed is unconcerned about the
automatic ten points the Tribe
gives away every match. (There

is no one at 115, and the only
130 pounder is hurt).
"What we're really shooting
for is the conference meet,
which will be here on the March
first and second. These early
dual meets are just warmups."

at 24-13 with two events to go,
so the best UCD could hope for
was a narrow 24-23 loss.
28 Second Pin
However, co-captain Terry
Crenshaw took exactly 28 sec
onds to wipe out any hopes of
a respectable showing by Davis.
That was the time it took for his
191 opponent to find himself flat
on his back and pinned.

Heavyweight Ben Shaver then
mopped up the final match of
the day with a fall.
Coach Pleased
Coach Reed was very en
couraged by the showing of the
Stanford grapplers, and is now
looking forward to next week
nd's match with SF State. He
predicts a close match, the out
come of which should be deter
mined by the lower weight
classes. The heavier men, led by
stalwarts Borchers and Cren
shaw, should be able to pick up
their share of points.
Reed is unconcerned about the
automatic ten points the Tribe
gives away every match. (There

is no one at 115, and the only
130 pounder is hurt).
"What we're really shooting
for is the conference meet,
which will be here on the March
first and second. These early
dual meets are just warmups."
Stanford's wrestlers returned,
rebounded from a discouraging
road trip and scored a convinc
ing win over UC Davis Satur
day, despite giving away ten
quick points on forfeits in the
115 and 130 pounds divisions.
The Tribe won eight of the
nine matches, five by falls.
Tom Hazelton started things
off with an 8-5 decision over his
man in the 123 division, and

Mike Pete kept the ball rolling
at 137 with an 8-3 win.
Three Straight Pins
Brian Smith at 145 picked up
the pace with a pin, and Bill
Vogelpohl (152) and Len Borch
ers (160), not to be outdone,
immediately followed suit and
the parade of pins continued.
UC Davis, by this time bloat
ed from their conitnued diet of
canvas, then toughened and
Burt Ambler could "only" score
a 12-5 decision.

The Davis boys finally broke
into the victory column
when fast-improving Bill Ross
was nosed out in an 8-7 decision
at 177. Coach Dave Reed said
that Ross had wrestled well,
however.
The score at that point stood
at 24-13 with two events to go,
so the best UCD could hope for
was a narrow 24-23 loss.
