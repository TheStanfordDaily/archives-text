# Gymnasts Trounce Hayward, Chico
## 
### BOB RUND 
Stanford easily defeated Hay
ward and Chico State in gym
nastics Friday despite the ab
sence of Jim Petersen and Jay
Schnack due to injuries. The
Indian gymnasts scored 142.90
to Hayward's 92.40 and Chico
State's 91.10 respectively.
Leading scorer for the Tribe
was arounder Craig Dickson
who edged Chico State's Buckey
Mackey 42.65 to 42.50 for the all
around honors.
The meet which coach Gil
more termed, "a poor one" did
have some bright spots. The In
dians had their best total score
of the season in the trampoline
with Mark Wood and Norris
Heckel scoring lifetime bests.
Jim Synder and Mike Mulr
subbed capably in the high bar
competition for their injured
teammates.
The top individual perform
ances of the meet were Rich
Guess's 8.65 in the long horse

competition and Craig Dickson's
8.40 in the floor exercise rou
tine.
Stanford was once again
plagued by the failure of a good
side horse man because of the
failure of three of last year's
men to come out for the team.
Next week the Tribe will face
its toughest competition thus
far this season against UCLA
and the University of Nevada
on Friday and Sacramento
State on Saturday. Kanati Allen
of UCLA is one of the nations
top gymnasts.

Stanford easily defeated Hay
ward and Chico State in gym
nastics Friday despite the ab
sence of Jim Petersen and Jay
Schnack due to injuries. The
Indian gymnasts scored 142.90
to Hayward's 92.40 and Chico
State's 91.10 respectively.
Leading scorer for the Tribe
was arounder Craig Dickson
who edged Chico State's Buckey
Mackey 42.65 to 42.50 for the all
around honors.
The meet which coach Gil
more termed, "a poor one" did
have some bright spots. The In
dians had their best total score
of the season in the trampoline
with Mark Wood and Norris
Heckel scoring lifetime bests.
Jim Synder and Mike Mulr
subbed capably in the high bar
competition for their injured
teammates.
The top individual perform
ances of the meet were Rich
Guess's 8.65 in the long horse

competition and Craig Dickson's
8.40 in the floor exercise rou
tine.
Stanford was once again
plagued by the failure of a good
side horse man because of the
failure of three of last year's
men to come out for the team.
Next week the Tribe will face
its toughest competition thus
far this season against UCLA
and the University of Nevada
on Friday and Sacramento
State on Saturday. Kanati Allen
of UCLA is one of the nations
top gymnasts.
