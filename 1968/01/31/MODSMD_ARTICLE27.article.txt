# Jogging Club
## 
### 
The Stanford Department of
Athletics and Sports Instruction
is now organizing a Jogging
Club for faculty and graduate
students.
The purpose of the program
is to improve cardio-vascular
fitness and weight control. Hope
fully other values related to in
tra â€¢ University communications
will accrue.
Anyone interested in the pro
gram is invited to meet with
Dick Reese, the instructor, at
12:15 M-W-F in Encina Gym. Be
ginning joggers are especially
encouraged to join.
