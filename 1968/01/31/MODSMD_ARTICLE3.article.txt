# SRT Actors Richards, Hiken Leaving Amid Controversy
## 
### JACK KAPLAN 
Gerald Hiken and Paul Rich
ards, Speech and Drama Depart
ment lecturers, Stanford Reper
tory Theater actors, and ex-
Broadway performers, will leave
Stanford next June.
Richards received a written
notice last Thursday from Wen
dell Cole, Acting Executive Head

of the Speech and Drama De
partment, stating that his con
tract would not be renewed in
the fall.
Hiken then informed Cole that
he was not interested in remain
ing at Stanford after Richards
left.
This development follows a
University decision to reduce
the number of acting artists
in-residence from four to
three for 1968-69, mainly be
cause of continued budget re
straint within the University.
Prof. Robert Sears, dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, said a search will be
conducted to find replacements
but emphasized that "we antici
pate the program will be con
tinued very much in its present
format" next year.
Hiken and Richards have
taught the first and second-year
acting classes, respectively, in
Stanford's Master of Fine Arts
program. Seven students are in
the second-year group and nine
are in the first-year class. Two
of the first-year group, Mary
Staton and Gene Parseghian, last
week were among five West
Coast students selected for the
finals in a national intercollegi
ate acting competition.
Both Hiken and Richards have
been hired on a yearly basis, but
according to Hiken there has
been a general understanding

that they would return next
year.
Richards said news that his
contract would not be renewed
came as a "complete surprise."
Both men had been discussing
plans for next year's drama pro
gram, assuming that they would
be here to participate in it.
Neither one could give an
explanation for the depart
ment's actions.
Cole said yesterday he "knew
nothing about" either the termi
nation of Richard's contract or
Hiken's resignation. However,
several first-year graduate stu
dents in drama claimed they had
spoken to Cole earlier in the
day, objecting to the depart
ment's actions regarding the de
partures of the two actor-lect
urers.
Cole has been acting executive
head since Professor William
Loper took a one-year leave of
absence last fall. Loper has since
decided to leave Stanford per
manently. Both the department
and SRT have been seeking full
directors since his resignation.
Initiated in 1965, SRT has op
erated on a reduced program of
four productions this year, re
ceiving wide favorable acclaim
for its first two places, Jean
Anouilh's "The Cavern" and
Daniel Gerould's "Candaules,
Commissioner," which ends this
week. Both have played to au
diences averaging more than 90
per cent of theater capacity.
Several first year graduate
students in drama expressed dis
satisfaction with the depart
ment's actions.
"They don't realize how Ir
replaceable they (Richards and
Hiken) are," commented one
student. Another added, "Some
of us have come thousands of
miles, passing up opportuni
ties at other universities, to
work with these two profes
sional actors."
One student surmised that
Richards was let go for finan

cial reasons. Several students
contended that the department
was aware that Hiken would
leave if Richards was not re
hired.
Richards has made no plans
for the future, except that he
will continue writing plays. One
of his works, "There Is a Meet
ing Place," was produced last
fall by SRT. Another, "The Great
Bolyouski," has proven popular
with Palo Alto groups in two
man performances with Hiken.
Hiken also said he has no
immediate plans, although he
Intends to remain a Palo Alto
resident.

An artist-in-residence at Stan
ford since 1964, he said he might
return to stamp collecting. Then,
recalling a theatrical yarn, he
described the somewhat con
fused series of events as "a
comedy with tragic relief."
