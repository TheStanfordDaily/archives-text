# Overambitious Program
## Frats Lose Improvement Plan 
### NICK SELBY 
Eight fraternity cluster houses
have lost their $2500 university
improvements subsidies, the
Daily learned yesterday.
Robert Summers, manager of
fraternities in the university

housing office, said that funds
for the subsidy, usually supplied
by receipts from summer con
ferences, had run out.
Summers indicated that there
never had been enough money
for the program and that there

had been only one profitable
summer. "Our subsidy plan was
overambitious. We were earning
only half the subsidy to each
house," he said.
Members of the clusters
have considered ending house
work programs. "We pay the
university rent and yet we per
form the functions of maids
In university dorms. Now
we'll be keeping up university
houses for free," explained
one cluster resident.
There have been no formal
plans for ending the house work,
however.
Summers and Assistant Dean
of Students Dan Williams will
meet with cluster house presi
dents and managers to discuss
the entire financial situation of
the houses in the spring.
Summers admitted that the
cluster houses "have a very legi
timate point," in complaining
about performing upkeep ser
vices for free, and added that
he was "thankful" for their
work. "Even the highly moti
vated houses find it hard to get
work done," he said.
But he stressed that there
were good prospects for the
university finding other ways
to subsidize improvements
and upkeep.
"This summer does not look
very hopeful because of reduc
tions in the number of confer
ences at Stanford due to govern

ment spending cuts," Summers
said.
"But we will have a broader
base with the new fraternity
clusters and we don't expect
labor costs in the fraternities to
rise as much as in other univer
sity residences," he stated.
Original plans for the cluster
houses called for one janitor per
house, but financial problems
quickly ruled them out. Attempts
at having two janitors per clus

ter failed, as did ideas for one.
Each house now pays rent
bills over $21,000 a year, or ap
proximately $2200 a month. The
per capita debt in the cluster
residences is twice the debt In
other university owned resi
dences.
The eight houses affected are:
Kappa Sigma, SAE, Phi Delta
Theta, Theta Delt, Zeta Psl, Kap
pa Alpha, Lambda Nu, and Al
pha Delt.

improvements subsidies, the
Daily learned yesterday.
Robert Summers, manager of
fraternities in the university

housing office, said that funds
for the subsidy, usually supplied
by receipts from summer con
ferences, had run out.
Summers indicated that there
never had been enough money
for the program and that there

had been only one profitable
summer. "Our subsidy plan was
overambitious. We were earning
only half the subsidy to each
house," he said.
Members of the clusters
have considered ending house
work programs. "We pay the
university rent and yet we per
form the functions of maids
In university dorms. Now
we'll be keeping up university
houses for free," explained
one cluster resident.
There have been no formal
plans for ending the house work,
however.
Summers and Assistant Dean
of Students Dan Williams will
meet with cluster house presi
dents and managers to discuss
the entire financial situation of
the houses in the spring.
Summers admitted that the
cluster houses "have a very legi
timate point," in complaining
about performing upkeep ser
vices for free, and added that
he was "thankful" for their
work. "Even the highly moti
vated houses find it hard to get
work done," he said.
But he stressed that there
were good prospects for the
university finding other ways
to subsidize improvements
and upkeep.
"This summer does not look
very hopeful because of reduc
tions in the number of confer
ences at Stanford due to govern

ment spending cuts," Summers
said.
"But we will have a broader
base with the new fraternity
clusters and we don't expect
labor costs in the fraternities to
rise as much as in other univer
sity residences," he stated.
Original plans for the cluster
houses called for one janitor per
house, but financial problems
quickly ruled them out. Attempts
at having two janitors per clus

ter failed, as did ideas for one.
Each house now pays rent
bills over $21,000 a year, or ap
proximately $2200 a month. The
per capita debt in the cluster
residences is twice the debt In
other university owned resi
dences.
The eight houses affected are:
Kappa Sigma, SAE, Phi Delta
Theta, Theta Delt, Zeta Psl, Kap
pa Alpha, Lambda Nu, and Al
pha Delt.
