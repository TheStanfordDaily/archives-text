# Studies Claim Stanford Has Low Spirit, High Academics
## 
### 
As seen by students, the Stan
ford community is scholarly, a
v/are, and lonely, two recent stu
dies suggest.
Conducted in cooperation with
Prof. C. R. Pace of the Univer
sity of California at Los Angeles
and the American Council of Ed
ucation (ACE), both studies
show Stanford ranks extraor
dinarily high in academic scho
larship and very low as a co
hesive community, compared
with universities.
The lack of group spirit,
friendliness and warmth
among students "is due, in
part, to the relative lack of
paternalism at Stanford — a
fact which may be surprising
to some students," according

to John D. Black, director of
the Counseling and Testing
Center.
Summarizing findings of the
two studies, he comments: "The
atmosphere is highly academic,
but the emphasis seems to lie
in isolated and competitive
achievement, rather than in a
truly effective sharing of the
intellectual life among students
and faculty or even among stu
dents themsevles."
The University's new coeduca
tional living-learning centers, ex
panded last fall, may reduce
this problem. Another effort in
this same direction is "Project
Encounter," an experimental ef
fort for students, faculty, and
staff to become less defensive,
and more aware of their per
sonal feelings through small
groups. Started with 100 fresh
men last fall, the project will be
expand-d on a voluntary basis
this year.
The Pace study showed Stan
ford students ranked in the top
two per cent (98th percentile)
nationally in awareness — the
search for personal, poetic, and
political meaning in life.
As a group, they also ranked
in the top fifth (81st percentile)
nationally in their scholarly con
cerns.
"In general, our faculty are
respected for their intellectual
ability, research productivity,
and conduct of their classes,"
Black noted.

On the other hand, student
responses placed Stanford in
the bottom sixth nationally in
practicality, community, and pro
priety.
Pace described practicality as
meaning that "status is gained
by knowing the right people, be
ing in the right groups, and do
ing what is expected . . . Good
fun, school spirit, and student
leadership in campus social ac
tivities are evident."
Community means a friendly,
congenial, cohesive atmosphere,
while propriety includes such
items as caution, thoughtful
ness, and group standards of
decorum.
Findings of the Pace study
suggest that Stanford combines
the cultural and intellectual at
tributes of the small, selective
liberal arts college with the im
personality and unconventional
ly of some of the large state
universities, Black says.
The Pace study covered a
cross section of 50 institutions,
including a random selection of
136 Stanford upperclassmen and
women. The ACE study cover
ed more than 300 Stanford stu
dents who had completed at least
one year of study and involved
246 institutions nationally.
The ACE study showed that
Stanford ranked in the top two
per cent (98th percentile) na
tionally in the perceived intel
lectual ability of the student
body, proportion of students
participating in faculty re
search — and students who
come to class late.
Stanford students also ranked
in the top sixth (84th percentile)
in amount of time spent study
ing, pressure to earn high grades,
verbal aggression with faculty,
and feeling of insufficient faculty
contacts.
In their personal lives, Stan
ford students ranked in the top
sixth across a wide range of
activities: sports, daydreaming,
listening to folk music and jazz,
and drinking.
They were also among the top
sixth in feeling they lacked
time for extracurricular and so
cial activities or contact with
their classmates. When it came
to watching TV, sleeping, and
getting pinned or engaged as
freshmen, they ranked in the
bottom sixth.
Stanford students ranked in
the top sixth in verbal aggres

sion with their fellow students
and in using such words as
"tense," "enterprising," "liberal,"
"sophisticated," and "not con
ventional" to describe their cam
pus environment.
Commenting further on the
findings, Black says: "A basic
cause of the problem is the
hurried, almost hectic pace of
life on campus which is, in
turn, a product of the sheer
quantity of work demanded
of students, faculty, and staff
alike.
'To pause for a leisurely cup
of coffee or a chat on Quad with
a student or a colleague becomes
a rare luxury.
"Yet the forces that have
transformed the campus from
a peaceful island of study and
contemplation are so powerful
it is hard to imagine how to
combat them.
"Some improvement might re
sult from a reduction of those
practices which stimulate compe
tition for grades and which lead
to unwarranted multiplication of
the sheer quantity of readings,
papers, and exams demanded of
students....
"However trivial and vacuous
the focus of football rallies or
Homecoming activities, these in
stitutions do serve the useful
purpose of providing for expres
sion of widely-shared interest in
the atmosphere conducive to
friendliness.
"Such functions are less well

performed by many ad hoc pro
test groups, because membership
in them requires a highly per
sonal and idiosyncratic decision.
The affective tone of many such
groups is aggresive — and some
times hostile."
