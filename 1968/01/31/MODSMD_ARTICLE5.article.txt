# Studies Claim Stanford Has Low Spirit, High Academics

As seen by students, the Stan
ford community is scholarly, a
v/are, and lonely, two recent stu
dies suggest.
Conducted in cooperation with
Prof. C. R. Pace of the Univer
sity of California at Los Angeles
and the American Council of Ed
ucation (ACE), both studies
show Stanford ranks extraor
dinarily high in academic scho
larship and very low as a co
hesive community, compared
with universities.
The lack of group spirit,
friendliness and warmth
among students "is due, in
part, to the relative lack of
paternalism at Stanford — a
fact which may be surprising
to some students," according

to John D. Black, director of
the Counseling and Testing
Center.
Summarizing findings of the
two studies, he comments: "The
atmosphere is highly academic,
but the emphasis seems to lie
in isolated and competitive
achievement, rather than in a
truly effective sharing of the
intellectual life among students
and faculty or even among stu
dents themsevles."
The University's new coeduca
tional living-learning centers, ex
panded last fall, may reduce
this problem. Another effort in
this same direction is "Project
Encounter," an experimental ef
fort for students, faculty, and
staff to become less defensive,
and more aware of their per
sonal feelings through small
groups. Started with 100 fresh
men last fall, the project will be
expand-d on a voluntary basis
this year.
The Pace study showed Stan
ford students ranked in the top
two per cent (98th percentile)
nationally in awareness — the
search for personal, poetic, and
political meaning in life.
As a group, they also ranked
in the top fifth (81st percentile)
nationally in their scholarly con
cerns.
"In general, our faculty are
respected for their intellectual
ability, research productivity,
and conduct of their classes,"
Black noted.

On the other hand, student
responses placed Stanford in
the bottom sixth nationally in
practicality, community, and pro
priety.
Pace described practicality as
meaning that "status is gained
by knowing the right people, be
ing in the right groups, and do
ing what is expected . . . Good
fun, school spirit, and student
leadership in campus social ac
tivities are evident."
Community means a friendly,
congenial, cohesive atmosphere,
while propriety includes such
items as caution, thoughtful
ness, and group standards of
decorum.
Findings of the Pace study
suggest that Stanford combines
the cultural and intellectual at
tributes of the small, selective
liberal arts college with the im
personality and unconventional
ly of some of the large state
universities, Black says.
The Pace study covered a
