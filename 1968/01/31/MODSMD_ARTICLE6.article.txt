# Eating Clubs' Request
## Women In Toyon Asked 
### CICELY BATES 
Four Stanford eating clubs
have presented a proposal to
university officials asking for ad
mission of women to Toyon Hall
for the 1968-69 academic year.
The request carries the provi
sion that the women become
members of one of four coedu
cational clubs — Los Arcos,
Breakers, El Campo, and El Cap
itan.
In a two page proposal sent
to Assistant Deans of Students
Sally Mahoney and Dan Wil
liams, the Inter-Club Council
(ICC) requests admission of 30
to 50 women, with the exact
number depending on available
facilities.
The proposal outlines these

procedures for selection of the
women: women could visit the
Eating Clubs and Toyon dur
ing Winter rush and include
the Toyon alternative among
their list of draw choices.
The university would continue
to conduct the draw. Women's
choices would be indicated as
Toyon-Los Arcos, Toyon-El Cam
po, Toyon-Breakers, or Toyon-El
Capitan.
Each club would establish a
quota so that the number of
women allowed in the clubs
would equal the total number of
women admitted to Toyon.
However, the plan also recog
nizes that many eating club
members would be displaced by
the women, and asks that only

residents presently in coed clubs
have to move. Members of El
Cuadro, El Tigre, and El Toro
would not be affected.
Toyon residents for long pe
riods of time would have senior
ity in the displacement process.
The proposal also strongly rec
ommended that the displaced
men be allowed to remain on
campus. The ICC would choose
the men to be displaced.
The proposal also says that
the ICC will remain the "sole
student legislative body for
Toyon Hall and the eating clubs."
The proposal grew out of
the four coed clubs' belief that
"women residents should be
given the same opportunity to
participate in eating club ac

tivlties as men."
Presently women who live on
campus must pay university
board bills, and must pay board
a second time if they want to
join an eating club.
This setup has limited female
membership in the clubs to se
nior or graduate women living
ofT-campus or junior and senior
women living in Hoskins House.
Mahoney and Williams said
they looked "favorably" upon all
suggestions for coed housing, but
that no final decisions for uni
versity housing for next year
have been made yet.
At the same time, the eating
clubs say the details of
proposal are not final and can
be altered.

facilities.
The proposal outlines these

procedures for selection of the
women: women could visit the
Eating Clubs and Toyon dur
ing Winter rush and include
the Toyon alternative among
their list of draw choices.
The university would continue
to conduct the draw. Women's
choices would be indicated as
Toyon-Los Arcos, Toyon-El Cam
po, Toyon-Breakers, or Toyon-El
Capitan.
Each club would establish a
quota so that the number of
women allowed in the clubs
would equal the total number of
women admitted to Toyon.
However, the plan also recog
nizes that many eating club
members would be displaced by
the women, and asks that only

residents presently in coed clubs
have to move. Members of El
Cuadro, El Tigre, and El Toro
would not be affected.
Toyon residents for long pe
riods of time would have senior
ity in the displacement process.
The proposal also strongly rec
ommended that the displaced
men be allowed to remain on
campus. The ICC would choose
the men to be displaced.
The proposal also says that
the ICC will remain the "sole
student legislative body for
Toyon Hall and the eating clubs."
The proposal grew out of
the four coed clubs' belief that
"women residents should be
given the same opportunity to
participate in eating club ac

tivlties as men."
Presently women who live on
campus must pay university
board bills, and must pay board
a second time if they want to
join an eating club.
This setup has limited female
membership in the clubs to se
nior or graduate women living
ofT-campus or junior and senior
women living in Hoskins House.
Mahoney and Williams said
they looked "favorably" upon all
suggestions for coed housing, but
that no final decisions for uni
versity housing for next year
have been made yet.
At the same time, the eating
clubs say the details of
proposal are not final and can
be altered.
Four Stanford eating clubs
have presented a proposal to
university officials asking for ad
mission of women to Toyon Hall
for the 1968-69 academic year.
The request carries the provi
sion that the women become
members of one of four coedu
cational clubs — Los Arcos,
Breakers, El Campo, and El Cap
itan.
In a two page proposal sent
to Assistant Deans of Students
Sally Mahoney and Dan Wil
liams, the Inter-Club Council
(ICC) requests admission of 30
to 50 women, with the exact
number depending on available
facilities.
