# Pueblo Sailor Reported Dead
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — One
of the 83 crew members of the
USS Pueblo , seized by North
Korea as a spy ship, was report
ed Tuesday to have died.
The Defense Department said
the report was unconfirmed,
and there was no way of identi
fying any casualties among the
captured mon.
The report followed a White
House statement that It had
been advised the crew was
being properly treated and the
wounded were receiving medi
cal care.
Asst. Secretary of Defense
Phil G. Goulding said, "We are
not able to confirm the reliabili
ty" of either report.
"The govennment still has no
firm information on injured or
wound Ml among the crew of the
USS Pueblo," Goulding said in a
statement.
Sen. J. W. Fulbright, D-Ark.,
said President Johnson "has
great hopes that diplomatic
procedures" will settle the
crisis brought about by North
Korea's seizure of the ship and
Its 82-man crew.

Fulbright, one of Johnson's
severest foreign policy critics,
endorsed the President's handl
ing of the situation.
"We've really gone complete
ly mad if this results in a war,"
Fulbright said.
California Gov. Ronald Rea
gan termed President Johnson's
action "a continuation of a pol
icy of appeasement that started
a long time ago."
Asked at his weekly news con
ference how he would have han
dled the situation, Reagan did
not give a direct reply. How
ever, he noted that others, in
Congress and elsewhere, have
suggested blockading North Ko
rean ports to freeze their econ
omy, or seizing their shipping
on the high seas.
"We are the most powerful
nation in the world," while
North Korea is "a little fifth-rate
power." However, Reagan adds,
"apparently they can tweak our
nose and get away with it." This
is the result, he remained "when
you follow more or less ap
peasing tactics."
