# Century 21 Speaker Says Machines To Outsmart Us
## 
### 
Computers will eventually be
smarter than people, according
to Professor John McCarthy of
the computer science depart
ment. He asserted this in a Cen
tury 21 speech on "Artificial In
telligence and Creativity" at
Tresidder last night.
"Even present day digital com
puters have the potentiality of
simulating human intelligence,"
McCarthy maintained, "we just
don't know the proper pro
grams."
The main problem for re
searchers in artificial intelligence
is language. "It would be pos
sible to feed the sentences 'Col
liding bodies make noise,' and

'Dropped things fall' into a com
puter, but the computer would
not then be able to hear a noise
and assume that I had just drop
ped my piece of chalk, as most
of you have," explained Mc-
Carthy.
Another problem with present
day computers is speed. Mc-
Carthy cited the example of a
woman in India whose arithme
tic was faster than any com
puter.
In the classic example of pro
gramming computers to play
chess, McCarthy asserted the
major problem is one of speed.
A thorough program would take
more than a year to decide on
one move, even with faster com
puters than any available today.
Therefore, chess-playing pro
grams are simplified, using gim
micks to reduce time. The best
chess-playing program today
holds the Class D amateur tro
phy in Boston.
McCarthy also discussed the
implications of creating ma
chines with morje intelligence
than humans.
He predicted that having ma
chines which could do anything
would not remove incentive for
human achievement, but make
many activities take on the na
ture of mountain climbing.
"There are many ways of
climbing mountains, but some
of them just don't count. That is,
you can land on top of Mt. Ever
est with a helicopter, but it's
just not the same."
There are at present two ap
proaches to the development of
artificial intelligence, McCarthy
said: understanding human intel
ligence and creating programs
to simulate these processes and
evolving the intelligence through
a system of rewarding the com
puter when it happened to reach
a proper solution.

day computers is speed. Mc-
Carthy cited the example of a
woman in India whose arithme
tic was faster than any com
puter.
In the classic example of pro
gramming computers to play
chess, McCarthy asserted the
major problem is one of speed.
A thorough program would take
more than a year to decide on
one move, even with faster com
puters than any available today.
Therefore, chess-playing pro
grams are simplified, using gim
micks to reduce time. The best
chess-playing program today
holds the Class D amateur tro
phy in Boston.
McCarthy also discussed the
implications of creating ma
chines with morje intelligence
than humans.
He predicted that having ma
chines which could do anything
would not remove incentive for
human achievement, but make
many activities take on the na
ture of mountain climbing.
"There are many ways of
climbing mountains, but some
of them just don't count. That is,
you can land on top of Mt. Ever
est with a helicopter, but it's
just not the same."
There are at present two ap
proaches to the development of
artificial intelligence, McCarthy
said: understanding human intel
ligence and creating programs
to simulate these processes and
evolving the intelligence through
a system of rewarding the com
puter when it happened to reach
a proper solution.
