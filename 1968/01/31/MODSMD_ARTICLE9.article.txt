# Fulbright Speech Charges
## Defense Contracts Subvert University Services 
### 
in his two speeches last December on "The
War and Its Effects," Sen. J. William Fulbright
criticized the increasing involvement of Amer
ican universities with the "military-industrial
complex."
Fulbright's references to universities which
have "joined the monolith" seem to be directed
at Stanford as much as any institution. Last
fiscal year 59 per cent of Stanford's income
(counting SLAC) came from the federal gov
ernment, for contracts and grants.
What follows is a selection from Fulbright's
Senate speech, Dec. 13, subtitled "The Military-
Industrial-Academic Complex."
While young dissenters plead for resurrection
of the American promise, their elders continue

to subvert it. As if it were something to be very
proud of, it was announced not long ago that the
war in Vietnam had created a million new jobs
in the United States. Our country is becoming
conditioned to permanent conflict. More and more
our economy, our government and our universi
ties are adapting themselves to the requirements
of continuing war—total war, limited war and
cold war. The struggle against militarism into
which we were drawn 26 years ago has become
permanent, and for the sake of conducting it we
are making ourselves into a militarized society.
I do not think the military-industrial complex
is the conspiratorial invention of a band of "mer
chants of death." One almost wishes that it were.
Conspiracies can be exposed and dealt
with. But the components of the new American
militarism are too diverse, independent and com
plex for it to be the product of a centrally di
rected conspiracy. It is rather the inevitable re

suit of the creation of a huge, permanent mili
tary establishment, whose needs have given rise
to a vast private defense industry tied to the
armed forces by a natural bond of common in
terest.
As the largest producer of goods and services
in the United States, the industries and business
es that fill military orders will in the coming fis
cal year pour some $45 billion into over five thou
sand cities and towns where over eight million
Americans, counting members of the armed
forces, comprising 10 percent of the labor force,
will earn their living from defense spending.
Political Force
Unplanned though it was, this complex has be
come a major political force. It is the result
rather than the cause of American military in
volvements around the world, but, composed as
it is of a vast number of citizens—not tycoons or
"merchants of death" but ordinary good Ameri
can citizens—whose livelihood depends on de
fense production, the military-industrial complex
has become an indirect force for the perpetua
tion of our global military commitments. This is
not because anyone favors war but because every
one of us has a natural and proper desire to
preserve the sources of his livelihood. For the
defense worker this means preserving or obtain
ing some local factory or installation and obtain
ing new defense orders; for the politician it
means preserving the good will of his constitu
ents by helping them to get what they want.
Every time a new program, such as Mr. Mc-
Namara's $5 billion "thin" antiballistic missile
system, is introduced, a new constituency is
created—a constituency that will strive mightily
to protect the new program and, in the case of
the ABM, turn the "thin" system into a "thick"
one.
In this natural way generals, industrialists,
businessmen, workers and politicians have joined
together in a military-industrial complex—a com
plex which, for all the inadvertency of its crea
tion and the innocent intentions of its partici
pants, has nonetheless become a powerful new
force for the perpetuation of foreign military
commitments, for the introduction and expansion
of expensive weapons systems, and, as a result,
for the militarization of large segments of our
national life.
Universities Join Trend
The universities might have formed an effec
tive counterweight to the military-industrial com
plex of strengthening their emphasis on the tra
ditional values of our democracy, but many of
our leading universities have instead joined the
monolith, adding greatly to its power and influ
ence.
Disappointing though it is, the adherence of
the professors is not greatly surprising. No less
than businessmen, workers and politicians, pro
fessors like money and influence. Having tradi
tionally been deprived of both, they have wel
comed the contracts and consultantships offered
by the military establishment. The great ma
jority of American professors are still teaching
students and engaging in scholarly research, but
some of the most famous of our academicians
have set such activities aside in order to serve
their government, especially those parts of the
government which are primarily concerned with
war.
The bonds between the government and the
universities are no more the result of a con
spiracy than those between government and
business. They are an arrangement of conveni
ence, providing the government with politically
usable knowledge and the universities with bad
ly needed funds. Most of these funds go to large
institutions which need them less than some
smaller and less well known ones, but they do
on the whole make a contribution to higher
learning, a contribution, however, which is pur
chased at a high price.
That price is the surrender of independence,
the neglect of teaching, and the distortion of
scholarship. A university which has become ac
customed to the inflow of government contract
funds is likely to emphasize activities which will
attract those funds. These, unfortunately, do not
include teaching undergraduates and the kind of
scholarship which, though it may contribute to
the sum of human knowledge and to man's un
derstanding of himself, is not salable to the De
fense Department or the CIA. As Clark Kerr,
former president of the University of California,
expressed it:
"The real problem is not one of Federal con
trol but of Federal influence. A Federal agen
cy offers a project. The university need not
accept, but as a practical matter, it usually
does. . . . Out of this reality have followed
many of the consequences of Federal aid for
the universities; and they have been substan

tial. That they are subtle, slowly cumulative,
and gentlemanly makes them all the more po
tent."
Deadly Process
From what one hears the process of acquiring
government contracts is not always passive and
gentlemanly. "One of the dismal sights in Ameri
can higher education," writes Robert M. Rosen
zweig, associate dean of the Stanford University
graduate division,
"is that of administrators scrambling for con
tracts for work which does not emerge from
th" research or teaching interests of their
faculty. The result of this unseemly enterprise
is bound to be a faculty coerced or seduced
into secondary lines of interest, or a frantic
effort to secure nonfaculty personnel to meet
the contractual obligations. Among the most
puzzling aspects of such arrangements is the
fact that Government agencies have permitted
and even encouraged them. Not only are they
harmful to the universities—which is not, of
course, the Government's prime concern—but
they insure that the Government will not get
what it is presumably buying; namely, the in
tellectual and technical resources of the aca
demic community. It is simply a bad bargain
all the way around."
Among the baneful effects of the government
university contract system the most damaging
and corrupting are the neglect of the university's
most important purpose, which is the education
of its students, and the taking into the govern
ment camp of scholars, especially those in the
social sciences, who ought to be acting as respon
sible and independent critics of their govern
ment's policies.
Subtle Process
The corrupting process is a subtle one: no
one needs to censor, threaten, or give orders to
contract scholars; without a word of warning or
advice being uttered, it is simply understood that
lucrative contracts are awarded not to those who
question their government's policies but to those
who provide the government with the tools and
techniques it desires. The effect, in the words of
the report to the Advisory Commission on Inter
national Education, is "to suggest the possibility
to a world—never adverse to prejudice—that aca
demic honesty is no less marketable than a box
of detergent on the grocery shelf."
The formation of a military-industrial com
plex, for all its baneful consequences, is the re
sult of great numbers of people engaging in
more or less normal commercial activities. The
adherence of the universities, though no more
the result of a plan or conspiracy, nonetheless
involves something else: the neglect and, if car
ried far enough the betrayal, of the university's
fundamental reason for existence, which is the
advancement of man's search for truth and hap
piness. It is for this purpose, and this purpose
alone, that universities receive—and should re
ceive—the community's support in the form of
grants, loans and tax exemptions.
When the university turns away from its cen
tral purpose and makes itself an appendage to
the government, concerning itself with tech
niques rather than purposes, with expedients
rather than ideals, dispensing conventional or
thodoxy rather than new ideas, it is not only
failing to meet its responsibilities to its students;
it is betraying a public trust.
Betrayal
This betrayal is most keenly felt by the stu
dents, partly because it is they who are being
denied the services of those who ought to be
their teachers, they to whom knowledge is being
dispensed wholesale in cavernous lecture halls,
thev who must wait weeks for brief audiences
with eminences whose time is taken up by travel
and research connected with government con
tracts. For all these reasons the students feel
themselves betrayed, but it is doubtful that any
of these is the basic cause of the angry rebel
lions which have broken out on so many cam
puses.
It seems more likely that the basic cause of
the great trouble in our universities is the stu
dent's discoverey of corruption in the one place,
besides perhaps the churches, which might have
been supposed to be immune from the corrup
tions of our age. Having seen their country's tra
ditional values degraded in the effort to attribute
moral purpose to an immoral war, having seen
their country's leaders caught in inconsistencies
which are politely referred to as a "credibility
gap," they now see their universities—the last
citadels of moral and intellectual integrity —
lending themselves to ulterior and expedient
ends, and betraying their own fundamental pur
pose, which, in James Bryce's words, is to "re
flect the spirit of the times without yielding to
it."

rected conspiracy. It is rather the inevitable re

suit of the creation of a huge, permanent mili
tary establishment, whose needs have given rise
to a vast private defense industry tied to the
armed forces by a natural bond of common in
terest.
As the largest producer of goods and services
in the United States, the industries and business
es that fill military orders will in the coming fis
cal year pour some $45 billion into over five thou
sand cities and towns where over eight million
Americans, counting members of the armed
forces, comprising 10 percent of the labor force,
will earn their living from defense spending.
Political Force
Unplanned though it was, this complex has be
come a major political force. It is the result
rather than the cause of American military in
volvements around the world, but, composed as
it is of a vast number of citizens—not tycoons or
"merchants of death" but ordinary good Ameri
can citizens—whose livelihood depends on de
fense production, the military-industrial complex
has become an indirect force for the perpetua
tion of our global military commitments. This is
not because anyone favors war but because every
one of us has a natural and proper desire to
preserve the sources of his livelihood. For the
defense worker this means preserving or obtain
ing some local factory or installation and obtain
ing new defense orders; for the politician it
means preserving the good will of his constitu
ents by helping them to get what they want.
Every time a new program, such as Mr. Mc-
Namara's $5 billion "thin" antiballistic missile
system, is introduced, a new constituency is
created—a constituency that will strive mightily
to protect the new program and, in the case of
the ABM, turn the "thin" system into a "thick"
one.
In this natural way generals, industrialists,
businessmen, workers and politicians have joined
together in a military-industrial complex—a com
plex which, for all the inadvertency of its crea
tion and the innocent intentions of its partici
pants, has nonetheless become a powerful new
force for the perpetuation of foreign military
commitments, for the introduction and expansion
of expensive weapons systems, and, as a result,
for the militarization of large segments of our
national life.
Universities Join Trend
The universities might have formed an effec
tive counterweight to the military-industrial com
plex of strengthening their emphasis on the tra
ditional values of our democracy, but many of
our leading universities have instead joined the
monolith, adding greatly to its power and influ
ence.
Disappointing though it is, the adherence of
the professors is not greatly surprising. No less
than businessmen, workers and politicians, pro
fessors like money and influence. Having tradi
tionally been deprived of both, they have wel
comed the contracts and consultantships offered
by the military establishment. The great ma
jority of American professors are still teaching
students and engaging in scholarly research, but
some of the most famous of our academicians
have set such activities aside in order to serve
their government, especially those parts of the
government which are primarily concerned with
war.
The bonds between the government and the
universities are no more the result of a con
spiracy than those between government and
business. They are an arrangement of conveni
ence, providing the government with politically
usable knowledge and the universities with bad
ly needed funds. Most of these funds go to large
institutions which need them less than some
smaller and less well known ones, but they do
on the whole make a contribution to higher
learning, a contribution, however, which is pur
chased at a high price.
That price is the surrender of independence,
the neglect of teaching, and the distortion of
scholarship. A university which has become ac
customed to the inflow of government contract
funds is likely to emphasize activities which will
attract those funds. These, unfortunately, do not
include teaching undergraduates and the kind of
scholarship which, though it may contribute to
the sum of human knowledge and to man's un
derstanding of himself, is not salable to the De
fense Department or the CIA. As Clark Kerr,
former president of the University of California,
expressed it:
"The real problem is not one of Federal con
trol but of Federal influence. A Federal agen
cy offers a project. The university need not
accept, but as a practical matter, it usually
does. . . . Out of this reality have followed
many of the consequences of Federal aid for
the universities; and they have been substan

tial. That they are subtle, slowly cumulative,
and gentlemanly makes them all the more po
tent."
Deadly Process
From what one hears the process of acquiring
government contracts is not always passive and
gentlemanly. "One of the dismal sights in Ameri
can higher education," writes Robert M. Rosen
zweig, associate dean of the Stanford University
graduate division,
"is that of administrators scrambling for con
tracts for work which does not emerge from
th" research or teaching interests of their
faculty. The result of this unseemly enterprise
is bound to be a faculty coerced or seduced
into secondary lines of interest, or a frantic
effort to secure nonfaculty personnel to meet
the contractual obligations. Among the most
puzzling aspects of such arrangements is the
fact that Government agencies have permitted
and even encouraged them. Not only are they
harmful to the universities—which is not, of
course, the Government's prime concern—but
they insure that the Government will not get
what it is presumably buying; namely, the in
tellectual and technical resources of the aca
demic community. It is simply a bad bargain
all the way around."
Among the baneful effects of the government
university contract system the most damaging
and corrupting are the neglect of the university's
most important purpose, which is the education
of its students, and the taking into the govern
ment camp of scholars, especially those in the
social sciences, who ought to be acting as respon
sible and independent critics of their govern
ment's policies.
Subtle Process
The corrupting process is a subtle one: no
one needs to censor, threaten, or give orders to
contract scholars; without a word of warning or
advice being uttered, it is simply understood that
lucrative contracts are awarded not to those who
question their government's policies but to those
who provide the government with the tools and
techniques it desires. The effect, in the words of
the report to the Advisory Commission on Inter
national Education, is "to suggest the possibility
to a world—never adverse to prejudice—that aca
demic honesty is no less marketable than a box
of detergent on the grocery shelf."
The formation of a military-industrial com
plex, for all its baneful consequences, is the re
sult of great numbers of people engaging in
more or less normal commercial activities. The
adherence of the universities, though no more
the result of a plan or conspiracy, nonetheless
involves something else: the neglect and, if car
ried far enough the betrayal, of the university's
fundamental reason for existence, which is the
advancement of man's search for truth and hap
piness. It is for this purpose, and this purpose
alone, that universities receive—and should re
ceive—the community's support in the form of
grants, loans and tax exemptions.
When the university turns away from its cen
tral purpose and makes itself an appendage to
the government, concerning itself with tech
niques rather than purposes, with expedients
rather than ideals, dispensing conventional or
thodoxy rather than new ideas, it is not only
failing to meet its responsibilities to its students;
it is betraying a public trust.
Betrayal
This betrayal is most keenly felt by the stu
dents, partly because it is they who are being
denied the services of those who ought to be
their teachers, they to whom knowledge is being
dispensed wholesale in cavernous lecture halls,
thev who must wait weeks for brief audiences
with eminences whose time is taken up by travel
and research connected with government con
tracts. For all these reasons the students feel
themselves betrayed, but it is doubtful that any
of these is the basic cause of the angry rebel
lions which have broken out on so many cam
puses.
It seems more likely that the basic cause of
the great trouble in our universities is the stu
dent's discoverey of corruption in the one place,
besides perhaps the churches, which might have
been supposed to be immune from the corrup
tions of our age. Having seen their country's tra
ditional values degraded in the effort to attribute
moral purpose to an immoral war, having seen
their country's leaders caught in inconsistencies
which are politely referred to as a "credibility
gap," they now see their universities—the last
citadels of moral and intellectual integrity —
lending themselves to ulterior and expedient
ends, and betraying their own fundamental pur
pose, which, in James Bryce's words, is to "re
flect the spirit of the times without yielding to
it."
in his two speeches last December on "The
War and Its Effects," Sen. J. William Fulbright
criticized the increasing involvement of Amer
ican universities with the "military-industrial
complex."
Fulbright's references to universities which
have "joined the monolith" seem to be directed
at Stanford as much as any institution. Last
fiscal year 59 per cent of Stanford's income
(counting SLAC) came from the federal gov
ernment, for contracts and grants.
What follows is a selection from Fulbright's
Senate speech, Dec. 13, subtitled "The Military-
Industrial-Academic Complex."
While young dissenters plead for resurrection
of the American promise, their elders continue

to subvert it. As if it were something to be very
proud of, it was announced not long ago that the
war in Vietnam had created a million new jobs
in the United States. Our country is becoming
conditioned to permanent conflict. More and more
our economy, our government and our universi
ties are adapting themselves to the requirements
of continuing war—total war, limited war and
cold war. The struggle against militarism into
which we were drawn 26 years ago has become
permanent, and for the sake of conducting it we
are making ourselves into a militarized society.
I do not think the military-industrial complex
is the conspiratorial invention of a band of "mer
chants of death." One almost wishes that it were.
Conspiracies can be exposed and dealt
with. But the components of the new American
militarism are too diverse, independent and com
plex for it to be the product of a centrally di
rected conspiracy. It is rather the inevitable re

suit of the creation of a huge, permanent mili

system, is introduced, a new constituency is
created—a constituency that will strive mightily
to protect the new program and, in the case of
the ABM, turn the "thin" system into a "thick"
one.
In this natural way generals, industrialists,
businessmen, workers and politicians have joined
together in a military-industrial complex—a com
plex which, for all the inadvertency of its crea
tion and the innocent intentions of its partici
pants, has nonetheless become a powerful new
force for the perpetuation of foreign military
commitments, for the introduction and expansion
of expensive weapons systems, and, as a result,
for the militarization of large segments of our
national life.
Universities Join Trend
The universities might have formed an effec
tive counterweight to the military-industrial com
plex of strengthening their emphasis on the tra
ditional values of our democracy, but many of
our leading universities have instead joined the
monolith, adding greatly to its power and influ
ence.
Disappointing though it is, the adherence of
the professors is not greatly surprising. No less
than businessmen, workers and politicians, pro
fessors like money and influence. Having tradi
tionally been deprived of both, they have wel
comed the contracts and consultantships offered
by the military establishment. The great ma
jority of American professors are still teaching
students and engaging in scholarly research, but
some of the most famous of our academicians
have set such activities aside in order to serve
their government, especially those parts of the
government which are primarily concerned with
war.
The bonds between the government and the
universities are no more the result of a con
spiracy than those between government and
business. They are an arrangement of conveni
ence, providing the government with politically
usable knowledge and the universities with bad
ly needed funds. Most of these funds go to large
institutions which need them less than some
smaller and less well known ones, but they do
on the whole make a contribution to higher
learning, a contribution, however, which is pur
chased at a high price.
That price is the surrender of independence,
the neglect of teaching, and the distortion of
scholarship. A university which has become ac
customed to the inflow of government contract
funds is likely to emphasize activities which will
attract those funds. These, unfortunately, do not
include teaching undergraduates and the kind of
scholarship which, though it may contribute to
the sum of human knowledge and to man's un
derstanding of himself, is not salable to the De
fense Department or the CIA. As Clark Kerr,
former president of the University of California,
expressed it:
"The real problem is not one of Federal con
trol but of Federal influence. A Federal agen
cy offers a project. The university need not
accept, but as a practical matter, it usually
does. . . . Out of this reality have followed
many of the consequences of Federal aid for
the universities; and they have been substan

tial. That they are subtle, slowly cumulative,
and gentlemanly makes them all the more po
tent."
Deadly Process
From what one hears the process of acquiring
government contracts is not always passive and
gentlemanly. "One of the dismal sights in Ameri
can higher education," writes Robert M. Rosen
zweig, associate dean of the Stanford University
graduate division,
"is that of administrators scrambling for con
tracts for work which does not emerge from
th" research or teaching interests of their
faculty. The result of this unseemly enterprise
is bound to be a faculty coerced or seduced
into secondary lines of interest, or a frantic
effort to secure nonfaculty personnel to meet
the contractual obligations. Among the most
puzzling aspects of such arrangements is the
fact that Government agencies have permitted
and even encouraged them. Not only are they
harmful to the universities—which is not, of
course, the Government's prime concern—but
they insure that the Government will not get
what it is presumably buying; namely, the in
tellectual and technical resources of the aca
demic community. It is simply a bad bargain
all the way around."
Among the baneful effects of the government
university contract system the most damaging
and corrupting are the neglect of the university's
most important purpose, which is the education
of its students, and the taking into the govern
ment camp of scholars, especially those in the
social sciences, who ought to be acting as respon
sible and independent critics of their govern
ment's policies.
Subtle Process
The corrupting process is a subtle one: no
one needs to censor, threaten, or give orders to
contract scholars; without a word of warning or
advice being uttered, it is simply understood that
lucrative contracts are awarded not to those who
question their government's policies but to those
who provide the government with the tools and
techniques it desires. The effect, in the words of
the report to the Advisory Commission on Inter
national Education, is "to suggest the possibility
to a world—never adverse to prejudice—that aca
demic honesty is no less marketable than a box
of detergent on the grocery shelf."
The formation of a military-industrial com
plex, for all its baneful consequences, is the re
sult of great numbers of people engaging in
more or less normal commercial activities. The
adherence of the universities, though no more
the result of a plan or conspiracy, nonetheless
involves something else: the neglect and, if car
ried far enough the betrayal, of the university's
fundamental reason for existence, which is the
advancement of man's search for truth and hap
piness. It is for this purpose, and this purpose
alone, that universities receive—and should re
ceive—the community's support in the form of
grants, loans and tax exemptions.
When the university turns away from its cen
tral purpose and makes itself an appendage to
the government, concerning itself with tech
niques rather than purposes, with expedients
rather than ideals, dispensing conventional or
thodoxy rather than new ideas, it is not only
failing to meet its responsibilities to its students;
it is betraying a public trust.
Betrayal
This betrayal is most keenly felt by the stu
dents, partly because it is they who are being
denied the services of those who ought to be
their teachers, they to whom knowledge is being
dispensed wholesale in cavernous lecture halls,
thev who must wait weeks for brief audiences
with eminences whose time is taken up by travel
and research connected with government con
tracts. For all these reasons the students feel
themselves betrayed, but it is doubtful that any
of these is the basic cause of the angry rebel
lions which have broken out on so many cam
puses.
It seems more likely that the basic cause of
the great trouble in our universities is the stu
dent's discoverey of corruption in the one place,
besides perhaps the churches, which might have
been supposed to be immune from the corrup
tions of our age. Having seen their country's tra
ditional values degraded in the effort to attribute
moral purpose to an immoral war, having seen
their country's leaders caught in inconsistencies
which are politely referred to as a "credibility
gap," they now see their universities—the last
citadels of moral and intellectual integrity —
lending themselves to ulterior and expedient
ends, and betraying their own fundamental pur
pose, which, in James Bryce's words, is to "re
flect the spirit of the times without yielding to
it."
in his two speeches last December on "The
War and Its Effects," Sen. J. William Fulbright
criticized the increasing involvement of Amer
ican universities with the "military-industrial
complex."
Fulbright's references to universities which
have "joined the monolith" seem to be directed
at Stanford as much as any institution. Last
fiscal year 59 per cent of Stanford's income
(counting SLAC) came from the federal gov
ernment, for contracts and grants.
What follows is a selection from Fulbright's
Senate speech, Dec. 13, subtitled "The Military-
Industrial-Academic Complex."
While young dissenters plead for resurrection
of the American promise, their elders continue

to subvert it. As if it were something to be very
proud of, it was announced not long ago that the
war in Vietnam had created a million new jobs
in the United States. Our country is becoming
conditioned to permanent conflict. More and more
our economy, our government and our universi
ties are adapting themselves to the requirements
of continuing war—total war, limited war and
cold war. The struggle against militarism into
which we were drawn 26 years ago has become
permanent, and for the sake of conducting it we
are making ourselves into a militarized society.
I do not think the military-industrial complex
is the conspiratorial invention of a band of "mer
chants of death." One almost wishes that it were.
Conspiracies can be exposed and dealt
with. But the components of the new American
militarism are too diverse, independent and com
plex for it to be the product of a centrally di
rected conspiracy. It is rather the inevitable re

suit of the creation of a huge, permanent mili
tary establishment, whose needs have given rise
to a vast private defense industry tied to the
armed forces by a natural bond of common in
terest.
As the largest producer of goods and services
in the United States, the industries and business
es that fill military orders will in the coming fis
cal year pour some $45 billion into over five thou
sand cities and towns where over eight million
Americans, counting members of the armed
forces, comprising 10 percent of the labor force,
will earn their living from defense spending.
Political Force
Unplanned though it was, this complex has be
come a major political force. It is the result
rather than the cause of American military in
volvements around the world, but, composed as
it is of a vast number of citizens—not tycoons or
"merchants of death" but ordinary good Ameri
can citizens—whose livelihood depends on de
fense production, the military-industrial complex
has become an indirect force for the perpetua
tion of our global military commitments. This is
not because anyone favors war but because every
one of us has a natural and proper desire to
preserve the sources of his livelihood. For the
defense worker this means preserving or obtain
ing some local factory or installation and obtain
ing new defense orders; for the politician it
means preserving the good will of his constitu
ents by helping them to get what they want.
Every time a new program, such as Mr. Mc-
Namara's $5 billion "thin" antiballistic missile
system, is introduced, a new constituency is
created—a constituency that will strive mightily

war.
The bonds between the government and the
universities are no more the result of a con
spiracy than those between government and
business. They are an arrangement of conveni
ence, providing the government with politically
usable knowledge and the universities with bad
ly needed funds. Most of these funds go to large
institutions which need them less than some
smaller and less well known ones, but they do
on the whole make a contribution to higher
learning, a contribution, however, which is pur
chased at a high price.
That price is the surrender of independence,
the neglect of teaching, and the distortion of
scholarship. A university which has become ac
customed to the inflow of government contract
funds is likely to emphasize activities which will
attract those funds. These, unfortunately, do not
include teaching undergraduates and the kind of
scholarship which, though it may contribute to
the sum of human knowledge and to man's un
derstanding of himself, is not salable to the De
fense Department or the CIA. As Clark Kerr,
former president of the University of California,
expressed it:
"The real problem is not one of Federal con
trol but of Federal influence. A Federal agen
cy offers a project. The university need not
accept, but as a practical matter, it usually
does. . . . Out of this reality have followed
many of the consequences of Federal aid for
the universities; and they have been substan

tial. That they are subtle, slowly cumulative,
and gentlemanly makes them all the more po
tent."
Deadly Process
From what one hears the process of acquiring
government contracts is not always passive and
gentlemanly. "One of the dismal sights in Ameri
can higher education," writes Robert M. Rosen
zweig, associate dean of the Stanford University
graduate division,
"is that of administrators scrambling for con
tracts for work which does not emerge from
th" research or teaching interests of their
faculty. The result of this unseemly enterprise
is bound to be a faculty coerced or seduced
into secondary lines of interest, or a frantic
effort to secure nonfaculty personnel to meet
the contractual obligations. Among the most
puzzling aspects of such arrangements is the
fact that Government agencies have permitted
and even encouraged them. Not only are they
harmful to the universities—which is not, of
course, the Government's prime concern—but
they insure that the Government will not get
what it is presumably buying; namely, the in
tellectual and technical resources of the aca
demic community. It is simply a bad bargain
all the way around."
Among the baneful effects of the government
university contract system the most damaging
and corrupting are the neglect of the university's
most important purpose, which is the education
of its students, and the taking into the govern
ment camp of scholars, especially those in the
social sciences, who ought to be acting as respon
sible and independent critics of their govern
ment's policies.
Subtle Process
The corrupting process is a subtle one: no
one needs to censor, threaten, or give orders to
contract scholars; without a word of warning or
advice being uttered, it is simply understood that
lucrative contracts are awarded not to those who
question their government's policies but to those
who provide the government with the tools and
techniques it desires. The effect, in the words of
the report to the Advisory Commission on Inter
national Education, is "to suggest the possibility
to a world—never adverse to prejudice—that aca
demic honesty is no less marketable than a box
of detergent on the grocery shelf."
The formation of a military-industrial com
plex, for all its baneful consequences, is the re
sult of great numbers of people engaging in
more or less normal commercial activities. The
adherence of the universities, though no more
the result of a plan or conspiracy, nonetheless
involves something else: the neglect and, if car
ried far enough the betrayal, of the university's
fundamental reason for existence, which is the
advancement of man's search for truth and hap
piness. It is for this purpose, and this purpose
alone, that universities receive—and should re
ceive—the community's support in the form of
grants, loans and tax exemptions.
When the university turns away from its cen
tral purpose and makes itself an appendage to
the government, concerning itself with tech
niques rather than purposes, with expedients
rather than ideals, dispensing conventional or
thodoxy rather than new ideas, it is not only
failing to meet its responsibilities to its students;
it is betraying a public trust.
Betrayal
This betrayal is most keenly felt by the stu
dents, partly because it is they who are being
denied the services of those who ought to be
their teachers, they to whom knowledge is being
dispensed wholesale in cavernous lecture halls,
thev who must wait weeks for brief audiences
with eminences whose time is taken up by travel
and research connected with government con
tracts. For all these reasons the students feel
themselves betrayed, but it is doubtful that any
of these is the basic cause of the angry rebel
lions which have broken out on so many cam
puses.
It seems more likely that the basic cause of
the great trouble in our universities is the stu
dent's discoverey of corruption in the one place,
besides perhaps the churches, which might have
been supposed to be immune from the corrup
tions of our age. Having seen their country's tra
ditional values degraded in the effort to attribute
moral purpose to an immoral war, having seen
their country's leaders caught in inconsistencies
which are politely referred to as a "credibility
gap," they now see their universities—the last
citadels of moral and intellectual integrity —
lending themselves to ulterior and expedient
ends, and betraying their own fundamental pur
pose, which, in James Bryce's words, is to "re
flect the spirit of the times without yielding to
it."
in his two speeches last December on "The
War and Its Effects," Sen. J. William Fulbright
criticized the increasing involvement of Amer
ican universities with the "military-industrial
complex."
Fulbright's references to universities which
have "joined the monolith" seem to be directed
at Stanford as much as any institution. Last
fiscal year 59 per cent of Stanford's income
(counting SLAC) came from the federal gov
ernment, for contracts and grants.
What follows is a selection from Fulbright's
Senate speech, Dec. 13, subtitled "The Military-
Industrial-Academic Complex."
While young dissenters plead for resurrection
of the American promise, their elders continue

to subvert it. As if it were something to be very
proud of, it was announced not long ago that the
war in Vietnam had created a million new jobs
in the United States. Our country is becoming
conditioned to permanent conflict. More and more
our economy, our government and our universi
ties are adapting themselves to the requirements
of continuing war—total war, limited war and
cold war. The struggle against militarism into
which we were drawn 26 years ago has become
permanent, and for the sake of conducting it we
are making ourselves into a militarized society.
I do not think the military-industrial complex
is the conspiratorial invention of a band of "mer
chants of death." One almost wishes that it were.
Conspiracies can be exposed and dealt
with. But the components of the new American
militarism are too diverse, independent and com
plex for it to be the product of a centrally di
rected conspiracy. It is rather the inevitable re

suit of the creation of a huge, permanent mili
tary establishment, whose needs have given rise
to a vast private defense industry tied to the
armed forces by a natural bond of common in
terest.
As the largest producer of goods and services
in the United States, the industries and business
es that fill military orders will in the coming fis
cal year pour some $45 billion into over five thou
sand cities and towns where over eight million
Americans, counting members of the armed
forces, comprising 10 percent of the labor force,
will earn their living from defense spending.
Political Force
Unplanned though it was, this complex has be
come a major political force. It is the result
rather than the cause of American military in
volvements around the world, but, composed as
it is of a vast number of citizens—not tycoons or
"merchants of death" but ordinary good Ameri
can citizens—whose livelihood depends on de
fense production, the military-industrial complex
has become an indirect force for the perpetua
tion of our global military commitments. This is
not because anyone favors war but because every
one of us has a natural and proper desire to
preserve the sources of his livelihood. For the
defense worker this means preserving or obtain
ing some local factory or installation and obtain
ing new defense orders; for the politician it
means preserving the good will of his constitu
ents by helping them to get what they want.
Every time a new program, such as Mr. Mc-
Namara's $5 billion "thin" antiballistic missile
system, is introduced, a new constituency is
created—a constituency that will strive mightily
to protect the new program and, in the case of
the ABM, turn the "thin" system into a "thick"
one.
In this natural way generals, industrialists,
businessmen, workers and politicians have joined
together in a military-industrial complex—a com
plex which, for all the inadvertency of its crea
tion and the innocent intentions of its partici
pants, has nonetheless become a powerful new
force for the perpetuation of foreign military
commitments, for the introduction and expansion
of expensive weapons systems, and, as a result,
for the militarization of large segments of our
national life.
Universities Join Trend
The universities might have formed an effec
tive counterweight to the military-industrial com
plex of strengthening their emphasis on the tra
ditional values of our democracy, but many of
our leading universities have instead joined the
monolith, adding greatly to its power and influ
ence.
Disappointing though it is, the adherence of
the professors is not greatly surprising. No less
than businessmen, workers and politicians, pro
fessors like money and influence. Having tradi
tionally been deprived of both, they have wel
comed the contracts and consultantships offered
by the military establishment. The great ma
jority of American professors are still teaching
students and engaging in scholarly research, but
some of the most famous of our academicians
have set such activities aside in order to serve
their government, especially those parts of the
government which are primarily concerned with
war.

gentlemanly. "One of the dismal sights in Ameri
can higher education," writes Robert M. Rosen
zweig, associate dean of the Stanford University
graduate division,
"is that of administrators scrambling for con
tracts for work which does not emerge from
th" research or teaching interests of their
faculty. The result of this unseemly enterprise
is bound to be a faculty coerced or seduced
into secondary lines of interest, or a frantic
effort to secure nonfaculty personnel to meet
the contractual obligations. Among the most
puzzling aspects of such arrangements is the
fact that Government agencies have permitted
and even encouraged them. Not only are they
harmful to the universities—which is not, of
course, the Government's prime concern—but
they insure that the Government will not get
what it is presumably buying; namely, the in
tellectual and technical resources of the aca
demic community. It is simply a bad bargain
all the way around."
Among the baneful effects of the government
university contract system the most damaging
and corrupting are the neglect of the university's
most important purpose, which is the education
of its students, and the taking into the govern
ment camp of scholars, especially those in the
social sciences, who ought to be acting as respon
sible and independent critics of their govern
ment's policies.
Subtle Process
The corrupting process is a subtle one: no
one needs to censor, threaten, or give orders to
contract scholars; without a word of warning or
advice being uttered, it is simply understood that
lucrative contracts are awarded not to those who
question their government's policies but to those
who provide the government with the tools and
techniques it desires. The effect, in the words of
the report to the Advisory Commission on Inter
national Education, is "to suggest the possibility
to a world—never adverse to prejudice—that aca
demic honesty is no less marketable than a box
of detergent on the grocery shelf."
The formation of a military-industrial com
plex, for all its baneful consequences, is the re
sult of great numbers of people engaging in
more or less normal commercial activities. The
adherence of the universities, though no more
the result of a plan or conspiracy, nonetheless
involves something else: the neglect and, if car
ried far enough the betrayal, of the university's
fundamental reason for existence, which is the
advancement of man's search for truth and hap
piness. It is for this purpose, and this purpose
alone, that universities receive—and should re
ceive—the community's support in the form of
grants, loans and tax exemptions.
When the university turns away from its cen
tral purpose and makes itself an appendage to
the government, concerning itself with tech
niques rather than purposes, with expedients
rather than ideals, dispensing conventional or
thodoxy rather than new ideas, it is not only
failing to meet its responsibilities to its students;
it is betraying a public trust.
Betrayal
This betrayal is most keenly felt by the stu
dents, partly because it is they who are being
denied the services of those who ought to be
their teachers, they to whom knowledge is being
dispensed wholesale in cavernous lecture halls,
thev who must wait weeks for brief audiences
with eminences whose time is taken up by travel
and research connected with government con
tracts. For all these reasons the students feel
themselves betrayed, but it is doubtful that any
of these is the basic cause of the angry rebel
lions which have broken out on so many cam
puses.
It seems more likely that the basic cause of
the great trouble in our universities is the stu
dent's discoverey of corruption in the one place,
besides perhaps the churches, which might have
been supposed to be immune from the corrup
tions of our age. Having seen their country's tra
ditional values degraded in the effort to attribute
moral purpose to an immoral war, having seen
their country's leaders caught in inconsistencies
which are politely referred to as a "credibility
gap," they now see their universities—the last
citadels of moral and intellectual integrity —
lending themselves to ulterior and expedient
ends, and betraying their own fundamental pur
pose, which, in James Bryce's words, is to "re
flect the spirit of the times without yielding to
it."
in his two speeches last December on "The
War and Its Effects," Sen. J. William Fulbright
criticized the increasing involvement of Amer
ican universities with the "military-industrial
complex."
Fulbright's references to universities which
have "joined the monolith" seem to be directed
at Stanford as much as any institution. Last
fiscal year 59 per cent of Stanford's income
(counting SLAC) came from the federal gov
ernment, for contracts and grants.
What follows is a selection from Fulbright's
Senate speech, Dec. 13, subtitled "The Military-
Industrial-Academic Complex."
While young dissenters plead for resurrection
of the American promise, their elders continue

to subvert it. As if it were something to be very
proud of, it was announced not long ago that the
war in Vietnam had created a million new jobs
in the United States. Our country is becoming
conditioned to permanent conflict. More and more
our economy, our government and our universi
ties are adapting themselves to the requirements
of continuing war—total war, limited war and
cold war. The struggle against militarism into
which we were drawn 26 years ago has become
permanent, and for the sake of conducting it we
are making ourselves into a militarized society.
I do not think the military-industrial complex
is the conspiratorial invention of a band of "mer
chants of death." One almost wishes that it were.
Conspiracies can be exposed and dealt
with. But the components of the new American
militarism are too diverse, independent and com
plex for it to be the product of a centrally di
rected conspiracy. It is rather the inevitable re

suit of the creation of a huge, permanent mili
tary establishment, whose needs have given rise
to a vast private defense industry tied to the
armed forces by a natural bond of common in
terest.
As the largest producer of goods and services
in the United States, the industries and business
es that fill military orders will in the coming fis
cal year pour some $45 billion into over five thou
sand cities and towns where over eight million
Americans, counting members of the armed
forces, comprising 10 percent of the labor force,
will earn their living from defense spending.
Political Force
Unplanned though it was, this complex has be
come a major political force. It is the result
rather than the cause of American military in
volvements around the world, but, composed as
it is of a vast number of citizens—not tycoons or
"merchants of death" but ordinary good Ameri
can citizens—whose livelihood depends on de
fense production, the military-industrial complex
has become an indirect force for the perpetua
tion of our global military commitments. This is
not because anyone favors war but because every
one of us has a natural and proper desire to
preserve the sources of his livelihood. For the
defense worker this means preserving or obtain
ing some local factory or installation and obtain
ing new defense orders; for the politician it
means preserving the good will of his constitu
ents by helping them to get what they want.
Every time a new program, such as Mr. Mc-
Namara's $5 billion "thin" antiballistic missile
system, is introduced, a new constituency is
created—a constituency that will strive mightily
to protect the new program and, in the case of
the ABM, turn the "thin" system into a "thick"
one.
In this natural way generals, industrialists,
businessmen, workers and politicians have joined
together in a military-industrial complex—a com
plex which, for all the inadvertency of its crea
tion and the innocent intentions of its partici
pants, has nonetheless become a powerful new
force for the perpetuation of foreign military
commitments, for the introduction and expansion
of expensive weapons systems, and, as a result,
for the militarization of large segments of our
national life.
Universities Join Trend
The universities might have formed an effec
tive counterweight to the military-industrial com
plex of strengthening their emphasis on the tra
ditional values of our democracy, but many of
our leading universities have instead joined the
monolith, adding greatly to its power and influ
ence.
Disappointing though it is, the adherence of
the professors is not greatly surprising. No less
than businessmen, workers and politicians, pro
fessors like money and influence. Having tradi
tionally been deprived of both, they have wel
comed the contracts and consultantships offered
by the military establishment. The great ma
jority of American professors are still teaching
students and engaging in scholarly research, but
some of the most famous of our academicians
have set such activities aside in order to serve
their government, especially those parts of the
government which are primarily concerned with
war.
The bonds between the government and the
universities are no more the result of a con
spiracy than those between government and
business. They are an arrangement of conveni
ence, providing the government with politically
usable knowledge and the universities with bad
ly needed funds. Most of these funds go to large
institutions which need them less than some
smaller and less well known ones, but they do
on the whole make a contribution to higher
learning, a contribution, however, which is pur
chased at a high price.
That price is the surrender of independence,
the neglect of teaching, and the distortion of
scholarship. A university which has become ac
customed to the inflow of government contract
funds is likely to emphasize activities which will
attract those funds. These, unfortunately, do not
include teaching undergraduates and the kind of
scholarship which, though it may contribute to
the sum of human knowledge and to man's un
derstanding of himself, is not salable to the De
fense Department or the CIA. As Clark Kerr,
former president of the University of California,
expressed it:
"The real problem is not one of Federal con
trol but of Federal influence. A Federal agen
cy offers a project. The university need not
accept, but as a practical matter, it usually
does. . . . Out of this reality have followed
many of the consequences of Federal aid for
the universities; and they have been substan

tial. That they are subtle, slowly cumulative,
and gentlemanly makes them all the more po
tent."
