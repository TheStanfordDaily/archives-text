# Los Arcos
## HELICOPTER 
### 
Dear Stanford student,
Los Arcos invites you to come by to meet us.
We can't describe our club accurately in print,
but we'd be happy to share our meals, parties,
and activities with you. If you're just looking
for three good meals a day you probably won't
like it here; but the decision is yours.
All of us feel a sense of responsibility to the
club because we chose it and it is a part of us.
Our outlook of Los Arcos has nothing to do
with athletic prowess, sex appeal, or ability to
drop out; it merely concerns an openness to
share oneself and express one's ideas.
If this sounds good to you, come by alone or

with your friends. (In the meantime we've pro
vided you with a helicopter to play with at
UGLY during Dead Week or other appropri
ate times until we see you.)
See you soon,
Los Arcos

Dear Stanford student,
Los Arcos invites you to come by to meet us.
We can't describe our club accurately in print,
but we'd be happy to share our meals, parties,
and activities with you. If you're just looking
for three good meals a day you probably won't
like it here; but the decision is yours.
All of us feel a sense of responsibility to the
club because we chose it and it is a part of us.
Our outlook of Los Arcos has nothing to do
with athletic prowess, sex appeal, or ability to
drop out; it merely concerns an openness to
share oneself and express one's ideas.
If this sounds good to you, come by alone or

with your friends. (In the meantime we've pro
vided you with a helicopter to play with at
UGLY during Dead Week or other appropri
ate times until we see you.)
See you soon,
Los Arcos
