Stanford Eating Clubs, once an exclusively
undergraduate male preserve, now welcome
all students, graduate and undergraduate, male
and female, to participate in this year's rush
program. As an alternative to Stern Hall and
the fraternities, clubs provide privately con
trolled dining and social facilities as well as the
option of living on campus (in Toy on, Crothers,
or Crothers Memorial Hall) or off campus. Six
of the seven clubs offer an active social, ath
letic, and cultural program, thus uniting their
respective memberships, which vary from 40
to 70, through common interests. This past year
the clubs ran as a group the successful Go Go
to College tutoring project, which will con
tinue next year.
The membership of the eating clubs repre
sents the broadest cross-section of the univer
sity to be found in any living group. Breakers,
El Campo, El Capitan, and Los Arcos are coed
and all seven admit male graduate students.
Transfer students living off campus often find
the clubs a highly desirable on-campus affilia
tion.
Four of the clubs maintain selective rush
programs: El Cuadro and Los Arcos, which
make bids on the basis of positive voting, and
El Tigre and El Toro. Breakers, El Campo, and
El Capitan have abandoned selective rush,
leaving the decision of pledging to the rushee.
Eating clubs have always valued their inde
pendence from the university, from national
ties, and from one another. The hiring of a cook,

menus, and social programs are all determined
by the individual club. In addition, members
have open kitchen privileges all day.
The cost of board at an eating club is gener
ally comparable to the university residence
board of $220 per quarter. All clubs offer par
tial board plans to suit the needs of the student.
Hashing positions are controlled by each club
and are available exclusively to club members.
The clubs will hold a meal exchange with
other university residences from Monday, Feb
ruary 5, to Friday, February 9. Freshmen in
terested in participating should sign the lists
posted in their dorms.
As in any other living group, it is the mem
bers who make the club what it is, and at the
open houses (see rush calendar) you will have
the best opportunity for getting to know club
members and for finding out what club life is
all about.
