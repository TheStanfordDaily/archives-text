El Campo can be nothing but a name—the
name of another Stanford eating club—until
one knows about the people who form its mem
bership and make it live. You must see them
and talk with them to know them, which you
can easily do if you are curious enough to ask
for a free meal. Rush is non-selective; the club
is open to undergraduates and graduates, men
and women. No eating club has a lower board
rate.
Even before paying a visit, you can learn
much about the members' spirit from their ac
tivities. The last year or so brought ski week
ends, square dancing, avid participation in in
tramurals, camping in Grand Canyon, another
Spring Sing triumph, a Yosemite weekend, ex
changes with women's residences, and a vari
ety of parties.
The list is longer. However, anyone old
enough to get drafted knows life isn't all fun.
Besides helping once a quarter with the Satur
day morning house cleaning (coed members
exempt), we join the club officers in doing the
work that goes along with the action.
We pride ourselves on our membership's in
volvement in club life, in both planning activi
ties and seeing them through.
Oh, Dave, the cook, so consistently comes
up with excellent meals that we take that for
granted.
