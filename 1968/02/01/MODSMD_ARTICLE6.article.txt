# El Capitan
## 
### 
El Capitan is a co-ed eating club open to un
dergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with
an open rush policy which merely requires a
prospective member to attend three meals. The
reason for that requirement is to impress pros
pective members with the concept of El Cap
as more than a restaurant. It's much more.
A quick look at the majors and classes of
members listed here indicates the diversity of
the club. For example, a recent survey showed

that no major type of social activity was over
whelmingly preferred by more than 10 to 15
members. The result is a social calendar that,
at first glance, reveals chaos:
Vineyard Seminars (featuring prominent
Bay Area personalities for an evening of wine,
cheese, and conversation), ski trips, live rock
band parties, cocktail parties, flicks, special
dinners, art parties, and the weekly TGIF.
After meals there's always a rush for the
bridge table, the tube, and the stereo, yet at
the same time, many members stay at the
tables to continue their conversations long
after the meal is consumed.
The athletic program, while not overbur
dened with victories, draws interest from the
club in all forms of sport.
Political discussions find ROTC pitted
against peacenik, Goldwater-ite versus McCar
thy-ite, or Rockefeller-ite, or Romney-ite, or—
yes—even Johnson-ite. And while the over-all
GPA of the club remains relatively high, a cas
ual visitor would hardly know it.
The Result? El Capitan Eating Club. The
only thing we can guarantee anyone is that
there'll be at least one member who disagrees
and one who agrees whether it's political, so
cial, academic, or personality. The choice is
not ours. By disavowing selective rush, we've
placed the burden on you. The responsibility

to visit, analyze, and decide is the prospective
members', not the club's. Our doors will be
open—take the risk and walk through some
time.
