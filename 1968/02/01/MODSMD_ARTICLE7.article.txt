El CuacLro does not have mystery meat or
meat slices so thin that you can use them for
toilet paper. The food has improved since we
fired our last cook, who had a successful oper
ation for the removal of her taste buds. We
hired a new cook last spring quarter in an ex
travagant gesture which resulted in six perma
nent dinner guests from two other clubs.
El Cuadro has champagne formals, nights
in the city, hill parties, jazz parties, exchanges
with other schools (not Paly), Big Game over
nights and R & R parties with our own Strobe.
El Cuadro has weekly meetings which are
begun with an invocation to the Deity, "God
damnit, let's get this thing going."
El Cuadro has a God-like Intramural team
in every sport —a football team known as the
"Delt-ldllers" and a baseball team that has won
the L-championship for three straight years.
El Cuadro has a couple of Christian Atheists,
a United Nations loving pinko rapist commie
bastard, an I Spy fan club, great breakfasts, a
sewer engineer, a camera nut, a few ski bums,
an addicted pin ball player, a pool shark, some
ex-frat men, a few varsity jocks, a Phi Beta
Kappa and a couple of guys just like you.
El Cuadro has few rules and traditions, lots
of informalities and a hang loose feeling. The
only way for you to find out what we have to
offer is to drop by for a meal or open house (the
club with the green door). You just may find
something you like.

El CuacLro does not have mystery meat or
meat slices so thin that you can use them for
toilet paper. The food has improved since we
fired our last cook, who had a successful oper
ation for the removal of her taste buds. We
hired a new cook last spring quarter in an ex
travagant gesture which resulted in six perma
nent dinner guests from two other clubs.
El Cuadro has champagne formals, nights
in the city, hill parties, jazz parties, exchanges
with other schools (not Paly), Big Game over
nights and R & R parties with our own Strobe.
El Cuadro has weekly meetings which are
begun with an invocation to the Deity, "God
damnit, let's get this thing going."
El Cuadro has a God-like Intramural team
in every sport —a football team known as the
"Delt-ldllers" and a baseball team that has won
the L-championship for three straight years.
El Cuadro has a couple of Christian Atheists,
a United Nations loving pinko rapist commie
bastard, an I Spy fan club, great breakfasts, a
sewer engineer, a camera nut, a few ski bums,
an addicted pin ball player, a pool shark, some
ex-frat men, a few varsity jocks, a Phi Beta
Kappa and a couple of guys just like you.
El Cuadro has few rules and traditions, lots
of informalities and a hang loose feeling. The
only way for you to find out what we have to
offer is to drop by for a meal or open house (the
club with the green door). You just may find
something you like.
