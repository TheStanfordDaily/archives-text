What's in El Tigre? Our Club by any other
name would be as ... well, exactly as it is (with
the possible exception of a wall decoration or
two). So let us pass beyond the name and the
yellow striped doors and see what lies inside ...
FOOD—it is an EATING club, you know—
to suit every taste (including bad, occasionally).
This is one of the most pleasant changes after
a year as a S. U. frosh. El Tigre shows its re
sponsiveness to its members' wishes by holding
the record for 'most former cooks.'
ATHLETICS—EI Tigre fields teams in vir
tually all intramural events, and perennially
finishes among the top few clubs in I.M. points.
SOCIAL PROGRAM—TGIFs, rock 'n roll
parties, ski weekends, beach parties, exchanges
(both Stanford dollies AND outside talent),
etc
ACADEMICS —Traditionally El Tigre ranks
near the top of all men's living groups in GPA
(if you're really interested).
DIVERSITY—You'II hear this word often
enough in coming weeks. Suffice it to say we
have it, too.
To give a complete picture of El Tigre in so
few words would be impossible, so just let us
assure you, 'you have to see us to believe us.'
(But before you decide just how to interpret
that last remark, we suggest you drop by and
see us for yourself—you still might not believe
us.)

What's in El Tigre? Our Club by any other
name would be as ... well, exactly as it is (with
the possible exception of a wall decoration or
two). So let us pass beyond the name and the
yellow striped doors and see what lies inside ...
FOOD—it is an EATING club, you know—
to suit every taste (including bad, occasionally).
This is one of the most pleasant changes after
a year as a S. U. frosh. El Tigre shows its re
sponsiveness to its members' wishes by holding
the record for 'most former cooks.'
ATHLETICS—EI Tigre fields teams in vir
tually all intramural events, and perennially
finishes among the top few clubs in I.M. points.
SOCIAL PROGRAM—TGIFs, rock 'n roll
parties, ski weekends, beach parties, exchanges
(both Stanford dollies AND outside talent),
etc
ACADEMICS —Traditionally El Tigre ranks
near the top of all men's living groups in GPA
(if you're really interested).
DIVERSITY—You'II hear this word often
enough in coming weeks. Suffice it to say we
have it, too.
To give a complete picture of El Tigre in so
few words would be impossible, so just let us
assure you, 'you have to see us to believe us.'
(But before you decide just how to interpret
that last remark, we suggest you drop by and
see us for yourself—you still might not believe
us.)
