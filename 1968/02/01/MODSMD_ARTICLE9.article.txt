# El Toro

### 
El Toro Eating Club is aware! We know well
the importance of the next few months of Win
ter and Spring quarters in the selection of the
living or social group that will significantly
determine or influence your extracurricular ac
tivities for the next few years.
Whichever of the many available living-so
cial arrangements you may choose, it is that
environment which will for the most part pro
vide your circle of friends, your social activities
and some of the perspective with which you
will experience other phases of your University
education. It may be either a fortuitous selec
tion or one which you may regret after the
initial impression wears off.
As such, you should give the most careful

consideration to the available alternatives; and
we at El Toro would like to extend this invita
tion to come and see what we are all about—
El Toro is a unique experience!
Our good old-fashioned rush system is con
ducted by an actively concerned membership,
who are not participating in our rush program
because of any kind of coercion, but because
they are as concerned as you are with getting
to know their prospective companions. We are
looking for people who are interested, enthu
siastic, who we hope will take an active part
in making their club run.
The business manager (who handles our in
dependent finances) is directly responsible to
the membership. The Social chairman is kept
busy organizing new and different activities to
stimulate club participation in such things as
our Tom Jones dinner, A.C.T. "Twelfth Night"
theater party, and our upcoming car rally and
topless-entertainment rock-out party etc., and
works in conjunction with the Cultural chair
man, who is responsible for our Wednesday
night lx).\ at the San Francisco Symphony.
Our intramural program is rigorously sup
ported (we were third best at Stanford last
year) by everyone from a former varsity foot
ball linebacker to frisbee flyers; recently 15 of
our more avid distance runners relayed a pizza
120 miles to Gov. Reagan's home in Sacramen
to in under 12 hours.
On another level, there is quite a wide range
of intellectual interest and commitment in con
versations around the Club and elsewhere:
University politics, government policies, inter
national affairs, science, U.F.O.'s, skiing—you

name it —someone here has something to say
about it, ranging from profundity to profanity.
Involvement is not lacking, as typified by
three presidents of the Stanford Young Repub
licans in the past few years, S.D.S. members,
and white-armband-wearers. Seniors are going
on to medical schools, the Peace Corps, OCS
programs, law schools, and careers in engineer
ing and industry. There is no such thing as a
"typical, average" Toro who could be pointed
out as a stereotype, but you can talk to any one
of us about most anything and we will listen
and answer. We want to meet and get to know
something about the people who will be shar
ing our meals next year, and we hope that you
will want to get to know us.
