TMU PRESENTS SATURDAYS AT 7:30, 8:30,
AND 9:30 P.M.:
• Feb. 10 —"Master of the House" 1925, and "Vampyr"
1932. In "Master" a husband treats his wife as an inferior
until she and the nanny team up to teach him a lesson.
Referring: to "Vampyr," probably the greatest horror film
ever made, Dreyer comments, "Our first idea was to have
the old doctor disappear in the earth, swallowed up by
quicksand. But ... it was too dangerous for the actor."
• Feb. 17 —"Passion of Joan of Arc" 1928. "When I ar
rived in France to make a film," Dreyer writes, "I proposed
three subjects—one on Marie Antoinette, another on Cath
erine de Medici, and the third on Joan of Arc. . . . Some
one said, 'Let's lake three straws and draw.' I agreed."
Thus, the masterpiece of the silent era and one of the best
ever was horn.
• Feb. 24 —"Day of Wrath" 1948. Usually considered
Dreyer's best along with "Joan of Arc," "Wrath" is a tale
of intolerance set against a backdrop of witchcraft and
sorcery in seventeenth century Denmark.
• March 2 —"Ordet" 1954. Winner of the Golden IJon at
the Venice Film Festival, Dreyer regards this film as more
successful than "Joan of Arc."
• March 9 —"Gertrud" 1964. A lonely woman refuses to
leave her husband and renew an affair with a poet, but
does have an afTair with a youth, and finally leaves for
Paris to live alone. Winner of the Critics Award, Venice.
