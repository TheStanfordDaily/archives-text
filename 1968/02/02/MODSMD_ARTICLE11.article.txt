# Collinson's 'Penthouse' combines assets of stage and cinematography
## 
### 
The Penthouse, directed by Peter Collinson,
is an interesting attempt to combine, or per
haps translate, theatrical drama into the cin
ema (the movie is based on an earlier play).
Collinson has brought together the best ele
ments of both art forms.
The plot is extremely simple to the point of
being non-existent, as in a play of the absurd
genre. Two men, Tom and Dick, pasing as
meter men, force their way into the penthouse
of an unfinished apartment building. There
Bruce (Terence Morgan), a real estate agent,
is making love to Barbara (Susan Kendall).
Tom and Dick proceed to have a party, to
which Bruce is not invited because of his pre
vious bad behavior.
After inebriating Barbara with some expen
sive whiskey and a joint or two, Tom and Dick
make love to her, as Bruce screams helplessly
in the corner. Then as quickly as they arrive,
the two men depart, leaving Bruce and Bar
bara to reconstruct their affair and their lives.
For a brief moment Tom, Dick, and Harry (a
female associate of the group) return to ask
the couple whether Tom and Dick should be
punished. Because of his own guilt at this ex
tramarital affair Bruce flees as soon as he and
Barbara are able to free themselves. The film
ends as Barbara and Bruce return to their sep
arate lives.
Collinson has expertly used the camera to
add a new dimension to drama. We are not
seeing a mere reproduction of a theater play.
The mobility of the motion picture camera as
well as its ability to focus attention and direct
the flow of action makes The Penthouse excit
ing and alive. The excellent photography and
absurd dialogue combine to give the viewer a
feeling of continuity and understanding that
is sometimes lacking in theater productions.
What Collinson has done is to show that
film allows the director more control, for it
permits him to show only what he desires the
audience to see. Either a long shot, encompass
ing the entire room, or a close-up showing only

part of a face can be used depending on the
desired effect. Collinson seems to have made
all the right choices.
The characters, too, have been well devel
oped, with each couple serving as a foil for
exploring the other's personality. Through the
macabre antics of Tom and Dick, we see the
frustrations of unfulfilled love that haunts
Barbara and the basic cowardice of Bruce.
Tom and Dick reveal themselves as they lead
their absurd party to its conclusion. The pair
represents the overt piety and morality and
the hidden and suppressed experiences that
direct our lives. Tom relates how baby croco
diles were kept as pets and then flushed down
the toilet when they grew too large. He pas
sionately tries to get Bruce to understand the
fight for survival that takes place in the sewer,
and how the anger and hatred shown to us
(and "How would you feel if one of these
crocodiles snapped you up in his jaws?" he
asks Bruce) is only our just reward.
Collinson has created both a technical and
an intellectual work of art. The Penthouse is
an excellent synthesis of theater and
that explores a little further the potential of the
cinema.
