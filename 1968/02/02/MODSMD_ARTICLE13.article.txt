# Entremont: keyboard maestro
## 
### 
Tall, slim, with a possessing smile best
describe piano virtuoso Philippe En
tremont. This young Frenchman is held
in highest esteem by American concert aud
iences (as he is on four other continents) for
his engaging interpretations of various Roman
tic compositions.
Bom in Rheims, Entremont was guided to
ward a career in music by his parents —his
mother, a pianist and Grand Prix winner; his
father, a violinist and now Director of the
Conservatoire in Brive. Philippe Entremont
received most of his formal training in Paris
under the tutelage of Rose Aye-Lejour, Mar
guerite Long and Jean Doyen. He has dis
tinguished himself in music competitions, col
lecting Grands Prix, first prizes and several
gold medals. At seventeen he embarked upon
a professional career which has taken him
around the world several times to practically
every musical center. Now at thirty-two, Phil
ippe Entremont stands as a sparkling land
mark in the world of music.
His unique style shone admirably as the
Tri-City Concert Association presented Mr.
Entremont in recital at the San Mateo High
School a week ago. The best way to character
ize Entremont's ability: he knows every inch
of his piano. Although he has a tendency to
slur over many passages, his renditions are
filled with fantastic tonal variations which are
inimitable in the musical realm.
Entremont began the evening with a charm
ing, light presentation of Three Sonatas by
Domenico Scarlatti (D-minor, D-major, and
C-major). He effectively charmed his audi
ence as his fingers danced through rapidly
repeating notes, skips, and intricate hand
crossings. He followed with Ludwjg van Bee
thoven's Sonata in C Sharp Minor, Opus 27,
No. 2 ("Moonlight"). The Adagio Sostenu*o
and Allegretto were incomparable; the Presto
Agitato was somewhat less impressive. Entre
mont lost his musical "sense of direction"; he
did not know quite where he was headed in
this rendition—somewhat like a car trying to
get to San Francisco from the Peninsula via
Oakland.
His fort 6, Claude Debussy: Suite: Pour Le

Piano, remains today an outstanding contri
bution to the expression of the total resources
of the modern concert piano. Based on mem
ories of Javanese music he heard at the 1889
World's Fair in Paris, Debussy's composition
is a major landmark in the history of piano
literature. In the Prelude, Entremont secured
his reputation by making use of the whole
virtuosity of his instrument. In the Sarabande,
he mastered the sublety of Debussy's work.
The Toccata was bold and dashing in parts,
in others quite dainty.
During the second half of the evening, En
tremont played the works of Frederic Chopin.
The artist started out quite poorly but finished
up with bravado. The Ballade No. 1 in G
Minor, Opus 23 was rendered overly melo
dramatic. Entremont became quite carried
away with himself and many problems in tech
nique resulted. His playing of the Impromptu
No. 1 in A Flat Major, Opus 29 was graceful
and well-executed. Emotionally it seemed as
though Entremont were definitely at one with
the piece. He followed with the Scherzo No.
3 in C Sharp Minor, Opus 39 full of fantastic
vibrance and the reflective and imploring
Nocturne No. 8 in D Flat Major, Opus 27,
No. 2. His final piece, the Polonaise No. 6 in
A Flat Major, Opus 53 was less than admir
able, but then it really is out of Entremont's
class—demanding crisp, clear, and penetrat
ing playing. Called back for two encores, he
played the Chopin: Waltz in E Flat Major,
Opus 18, and as the audience began to file
out, finished with a short Etude.
Philippe Entremont was expecting us back
stage, and as we asked him his plans for the
future (which, incidentally, included a con
cert in Oakland, one in Sacramento, and one
in New York—all within a period of some 60
hours), we found him as courteous and pleas
ant as his delightful musical ability. To Stan
ford he bids a happy, "Hello."
