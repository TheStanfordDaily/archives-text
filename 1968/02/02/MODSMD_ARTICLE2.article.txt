# Congress to colleges: evolution of the law
## 
### michael couzens 
Congress called the tune for a new draft
law last summer. Only by autumn did
somnolent universities realize that the
legislators were asking them to pay the piper.
The new law looks like siphoning off all eli
gible graduate students, leaving, in Nathan
Pusey's phrase, "the lame, the halt, the blind,
the female." Add "the foreign" and the Presi
dent of Harvard was not exaggerating.
Many people in Washington speculated that
the President would modify the law by Presi
dential directive this week. But at press time,
no one had heard a peep ; much less an Execu
tive Order.
Even with a Presidential directive, graduate
schools would be in trouble. Not that total en
rollment would plunge. The President can
still invalidate dire and reasonable warnings
that the number of graduate students might
be cut in half.
But for certain areas, curtailment and even
crippling are seriously discussed. Engineering,
with a high proportion of foreign students,
cannot assimilate them if their vulnerable do
mestic fellows must go to serve. A heavy call
would deny them the chance to get an "Ameri
can" education.
Departments which rely on teaching assist
ants to conduct classes and on lab assistants to
conduct research must hope for new men, new
methods, or more than their share of good
luck to carry on daily business. Laboratories
will be hit first. Because many TA's are third
and fourth-year men, the problem will lie hid
den for a couple of years, at which time short
ages are on the cards.
Finally, professional schools —law and busi
ness—stand to receive a body blow from the
new legislation. Unprotected by foreign and
female, looking altogether like healthy Ameri
cans, their students are going to dwindle. Even
under the best conditions, they could be
halved.
It is this list of expected consequences which
prompted Virgil K. Whitaker, Dean of the
Graduate Division, to warn: "The immediate
plight of the universities will be severe. But
what really matters in the long run is the seri
ous disruption of advanced training upon
which the United States must rely to maintain
intellectual leadership in world affairs and
technological and industrial progress at home."
How did this law, Senate Bill 1432, June 30,
1967, go through without a clamor from the
higher learning?
The full answer comes with a look at delib
erations in a frustrated Ninetieth Congress.
But three factors put universities off their
guard from the start.
No major revision of the Selective Service
Act had been made since 1951. Congress was
reluctant to address the statute at all, and hur
ried its alteration through. President Johnson
signed the bill hours before the old one was to
expire. There was no time to anticipate the
change, and no sign to anticipate the danger.
Second, a very able Presidential Advisory
Commission on Selective Service made its re
port in February, 1967. Chairman was former
Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall,
and its members included President Kingman
Brewster of Yale, John A. McCone, and John
Courtney Murray.
The Commission's recommendations were
thoughtful and reasonable. If they were not
especially daring, they contained nothing to
disrupt or distort the universities. And the
President, with Sen. Richard Russell (D.-Ga.)
floor managing, seemed a good bet to get them
written into law.
Finally, the draft is a circus of many rings.
Those who opposed it unconditionally, some
suggesting a voluntary service alternative, took
themselves out of the political process. To
most Congressmen, voluntary service is not
only pie-in-t he-sky, but it casts doubt on the
good intentions and patriotism of American
men who answer the draft call and serve.
Other rings, such as conscientious objection,

classification of protestors, and the legitimacy
of the draft in our present "peacetime," let out
emotion, and served to obscure the salient con
sequences of the new law. Kingman Brewster
was moved to action by Gen. Lewis B. Fer
shey's dictum on protestors Oct. 26, but not by
the repudiation in Congress of his Commis
sion's valuable recommendations.

On April 5, 1967, Sen. Russell introduced
the administration bill. A week later, hearings
were opened in the Senate Armed Services
Committee. The tone was set by Gen. Mark W.
Clark (USA-ret.), who inveighed against pro
test, draft-card burners, and Supreme Court
expansion of the criteria for conscientious ob
jection.
Gen. Clark said that he opposed the exemp
tion for someone who "can't prove belief in a
Supreme Being rather than in a tobacco plant
or "something." He confessed exasperation at
"a breed of cat running around" who did not
"want to fight... to go to war," who was "anti-
Vietnam all the time."
When a spokesman for the Nat'onal Federa
tion for the Blind requested that the blind be
allowed to join the army to perform some ad
ministrative jobs, Sen. Russell said that his tes
timony ought to bring a "blush of shame" to
those who had protested the draft.
Other witnesses represented the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, American
Legion, United Church of Christ, and National
Guard Association. The Young Americans for
Freedom argued for voluntary service, in order

"There was no time to anticipate the change, and no
time to anticipate the danger."

that the youth might affirm their patriotism
without compulsion.
The university voice was significantly ab
sent from these hearings. And the cause was
not taken up. Marshall and Hershey explained
proposals for a lottery, but did not buck the
committee's evident hostility to ending under
graduate deferments.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.-Mass.) testified
that the Manpower Subcommittee, of which
he was acting chairman, favored induction of
19-year-olds first, lottery, and an end to grad
uate deferments.
On the crucial point of undergraduate de
ferments, Kennedy said he favored them in
peacetime, but not at war. The question be
came: "When is the country at war?" And the
Senator replied, under questioning, that Viet
nam should definitely be considered "war
time."
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R.-Ore.) proposed a vol
untary service. The suggestion, later to be hotly
debated and roundly defeated when he sub
mitted it as an amendment, completes the cata
logue of points of view. What was emotionally
felt in the Senate was to be liberalized and
sharpened in the House. In the process, Presi
dent Johnson, his Special Commission, and
graduate education were softly retired from
the debate.
Gen. Clark's proposal to maintain under
graduate deferments was written into the com
mittee's Report of May 4. A continuing supply
of college graduates was important to the na
tion, and this overrode arguments of che in

equity for those who could not afford to go to
college.
Unremarked was the importance to the na
tion of the graduate students who would have
to take their places in the army, or the impor
tance of a supply of teachers for these impor
tant undergraduates.
The Senate, with nays from Wayne Morse
(D.-Ore.) and Ernest Gruening (D.-Alaska),
passed S 1432 on May 11. Hatfield's amend
ment was that "Whenever . . . reassessment
reveals that a system of involuntary inductions
can be replaced by a system based on the free
choice of individuals at an over-all cost the na
tion can reasonably afford, Congress should
act to facilitate the prompt termination of mili

tary inductions. . . It was defeated, 9-69.
Tlie Bill did not include the President's pro
posal to reverse induction priorities from the
oldest first to the youngest first, in ages 19-26.
It was, however, approved in the Armed Ser
vices Committee Report. The Marshall Com
mission had argued that the old law creatcd a
long period of painful uncertainty for many
young men. To this, Sen. Russell made the in
credible argument that it was only true "if one
begins with the idea that avoidance of service
is an objective." As though the Ph.D. candi
dates and young men starting their own busi
nesses waited for the draft as a stimulating
change of pace!
The House, with legislation against draft
card burners recently to its credit, was even
less kindly disposed. The House Armed Ser
vices Committee reported out a bill which
tightened restrictions for conscientious objec
tors and urged the Justice Department to pro
ceed quickly in prosecuting draft law violators.
Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D.-La.), third
ranking Democrat on the Committee, took up
the subject of draft protest: "Let's forget about
the first amendment. I know that will be the
refuge of the Supreme Court, I recognize that.
But at least the effort can be made and the
demonstration given the American people cer
tainly that the Department of Justice and most
assuredly the Congress is determined to elimi
nate this rat-infested area in this country."
But he was fulminating about a side issue.

rective, to institute a lottery or to abolish un
dergraduate deferments, unless those changes
were "in the national interest." If they were
abolished, potential doctors, lawyers, and
other specialists would fulfill their military ob
ligation before completing their professional
training. So the committee argued.
No one from the universities was present to
suggest that, doctors aside, this argument
could be used to oppose what was being done
to graduate study.
The House version was debated on the floor
on May 25. An amendment by Otis G. Pike
(D.-N.Y.) to eliminate undergraduate defer
ments was rejected 77-160. As in the Senate,
arguments in favor were based solely on eq
uity. The pinch which devolved upon graduate
study never came to light.
Objection was raised that debate had been
scheduled on the night following action on
the controversial elementary and secondary
education bill, which dragged on until 1:40
a.m. But the Congressmen soldiered on to final
passage of S 1432 just before midnight. The
vote was 362-9.
House and Senate versions were broadly dif
ferent. In the conference to resolve the two,
House members held tenaciously to their ver
sion. At a crucial time, Sen. Russell switched
sides and gained an absolute ban on lottery,
instead of the House's request for 60-day noti
fication. The final bill, cleared by Congress on
June 20, left the President only two areas in
which to maneuver.
• He could move through the National Se
curity Council to defer some areas of graduate
study as "in the national interest."
• He could declare a prime age group, in
structing local boards to order for induction a
certain "mix" of ages.
Only one major administration - sponsored
provision survived: the President was still free
to take 19-year-olds first.
Sen. Russell, presiding in the ruins of a bill
which bore little affinity to the one he had in
troduced, gave credit to a mute, but kindred
spirit:
"It is significant to me, in reading these com
munications here today, that we have not had
anything from General Hershey objecting to
this bill. He has not expressed any displeasure
with it."

Why did Congress arrive at this version of
the new draft law? One has the impression that
irritat on and urgency were important. The
Senate was especially pressed, with Sen. Thom
as Dodd (D.-Conn.) up for scrutiny in a few
days.
A view of higher education was also mani
fest. Attempts selectively to defer undergrad
uates had met with strenuous complaints.
Some universities refused to disclose class
ranking. Others conducted "draft tests" to the
accompaniment of demonstrations and sit-ins.
The temptation to a washing of hands, with
respect to undergraduates, was powerful.
Secondly, the Eighty-ninth Congress had
been very generous to universities, in grant,
loan and gift. Draft-test protest, Vietnam pro
test, and general hostility seemed, at least, un
grateful.
Having forsaken the undergraduates, the
Congress needed men from somewhere. Lack
ing a sense of what graduate schools did, per
haps suspecting them, Congress took the ob
vious step.
Four years of college has become enshrined
as an American value. Rut for most Americans,

and Congressmen are like most Americans, ad

Senate Bill 1432 and the Executive Order
putting it into effect were signed by President
Johnson on June 30, 1967. The next day, Burke
Marshall was quoted by The New York Times
as saying, "In my judgment, the new bill makes
the system worse than it was before."
The Executive Order set the demise of most
graduate deferments for next year. Universities
were about to get onto the scent.
According to provisions which remained in
effect with the new law, the oldest in the man
power pool were to be taken first. But anyone
who had had a student deferment at any time
went into the "most vulnerable" category.
The result would be to wipe out some areas
of graduate study and to debilitate others, un
less' the President made some change with a
new Executive Order. It is understandable that
the universities did not realize this at once. It
appears not to have dawned on the lawmakers
themselves.
But opposition began to be vocalized. John
F. Morse of the American Council on Educa
tion circulated memoranda. And the graduate
deans started alerting people to the danger.
On August 8, the Council of Graduate
Schools held an emergency meeting of its Se
lective Service Committee. Two statements
later emerged with the support of the CGE
Executive Committee and the Association of
Graduate Schools.
One statement began, "The Military Selec
tive Service Act of 1967 and the President's Ex
ecutive Order 11360, ending deferments of
graduate students except those in health sci
ences and those in certain other, not yet desig
nated disciplines, will have immediate serious
consequences for all graduate education and
will produce an inevitable deterioration of all
higher education for an unpredictable number
of years."
The first task was to stop the President from
designating additional areas of exemption.

These, the Council said, would inevitably "im
pede the strength and warp the free intellec
tual development of the United States." While
the President is still free to do this, the cam
paign appears to have succeeded.
Other recommendations were similar to the
Marshall Commission: selection at an early
age; advance notice (perhaps a year); and free
dom to complete a degree program in prog
ress. The Commission had urged an end to all
student deferments. But with Congress cutting
off the supply of undergraduates for the army,
the CGS request for reconsideration of gradu
ate deferments was reasonable.

Will the draft law be changed again before it
has run its four-year course?
Walter Findeisen, National Service Officer
at Stanford, doubts it. The Army prefers 19-
year-olds. And Findeisen believes that draft
boards will show just enough favoritisn. to
graduate students to prevent Congress from re
opening the unpleasant debate.
He further doubts that the President will
designate a prime age, since to do so would be
to incur "the wrath of every local PTA mem
ber in the United States."
Meanwhile, the local boards, which the Mar
shall Commission wanted to replace with na
tional standards, will continue to do what Fin
deisen called their "agonizing, thankless, God
forsaken job."
And Cen. Lewis B. Hershey will join with
the Congress in avoiding discussion of substan
tive goals and consequences: "I'm as popular
as a bastard at a family reunion with the mili
tary because they don't want to run a correc
tional institution. But they have the know-how
to teach discipline. It's not a matter of author
ity for the sake of authority. Authority is just a
method of getting things done without being
reduced to chaos. . . . The question is, what
are you running? A force to garrison the world,
or a training school for citizens? 1 guess I
straddle that one."


Dean Whitaker warns that the new draft law
will cause "serious disruption of ad
vanced training."
Congress called the tune for a new draft
law last summer. Only by autumn did
somnolent universities realize that the
legislators were asking them to pay the piper.
The new law looks like siphoning off all eli

tional institution. But they have the know-how
to teach discipline. It's not a matter of author
ity for the sake of authority. Authority is just a
method of getting things done without being
reduced to chaos. . . . The question is, what
are you running? A force to garrison the world,
or a training school for citizens? 1 guess I
straddle that one."


Dean Whitaker warns that the new draft law
will cause "serious disruption of ad
vanced training."
Congress called the tune for a new draft
law last summer. Only by autumn did
somnolent universities realize that the
legislators were asking them to pay the piper.
The new law looks like siphoning off all eli
gible graduate students, leaving, in Nathan
Pusey's phrase, "the lame, the halt, the blind,
the female." Add "the foreign" and the Presi
dent of Harvard was not exaggerating.
Many people in Washington speculated that
the President would modify the law by Presi
dential directive this week. But at press time,
no one had heard a peep ; much less an Execu
tive Order.
Even with a Presidential directive, graduate
schools would be in trouble. Not that total en
rollment would plunge. The President can
still invalidate dire and reasonable warnings
that the number of graduate students might
be cut in half.
But for certain areas, curtailment and even
crippling are seriously discussed. Engineering,
with a high proportion of foreign students,
cannot assimilate them if their vulnerable do
mestic fellows must go to serve. A heavy call
would deny them the chance to get an "Ameri
can" education.
Departments which rely on teaching assist
ants to conduct classes and on lab assistants to
conduct research must hope for new men, new
methods, or more than their share of good
luck to carry on daily business. Laboratories
will be hit first. Because many TA's are third
and fourth-year men, the problem will lie hid
den for a couple of years, at which time short
ages are on the cards.
Finally, professional schools —law and busi
ness—stand to receive a body blow from the
new legislation. Unprotected by foreign and
female, looking altogether like healthy Ameri
cans, their students are going to dwindle. Even
under the best conditions, they could be
halved.
It is this list of expected consequences which
prompted Virgil K. Whitaker, Dean of the
Graduate Division, to warn: "The immediate
plight of the universities will be severe. But
what really matters in the long run is the seri
ous disruption of advanced training upon
which the United States must rely to maintain
intellectual leadership in world affairs and
technological and industrial progress at home."
How did this law, Senate Bill 1432, June 30,
1967, go through without a clamor from the
higher learning?
The full answer comes with a look at delib
erations in a frustrated Ninetieth Congress.
But three factors put universities off their
guard from the start.
No major revision of the Selective Service
Act had been made since 1951. Congress was
reluctant to address the statute at all, and hur
ried its alteration through. President Johnson
signed the bill hours before the old one was to
expire. There was no time to anticipate the
change, and no sign to anticipate the danger.
Second, a very able Presidential Advisory
Commission on Selective Service made its re
port in February, 1967. Chairman was former
Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall,
and its members included President Kingman
Brewster of Yale, John A. McCone, and John
Courtney Murray.
The Commission's recommendations were
thoughtful and reasonable. If they were not
especially daring, they contained nothing to
disrupt or distort the universities. And the
President, with Sen. Richard Russell (D.-Ga.)
floor managing, seemed a good bet to get them
written into law.
Finally, the draft is a circus of many rings.
Those who opposed it unconditionally, some
suggesting a voluntary service alternative, took
themselves out of the political process. To
most Congressmen, voluntary service is not
only pie-in-t he-sky, but it casts doubt on the
good intentions and patriotism of American
men who answer the draft call and serve.
Other rings, such as conscientious objection,

classification of protestors, and the legitimacy
of the draft in our present "peacetime," let out
emotion, and served to obscure the salient con
sequences of the new law. Kingman Brewster
was moved to action by Gen. Lewis B. Fer
shey's dictum on protestors Oct. 26, but not by
the repudiation in Congress of his Commis
sion's valuable recommendations.

On April 5, 1967, Sen. Russell introduced
the administration bill. A week later, hearings
were opened in the Senate Armed Services
Committee. The tone was set by Gen. Mark W.
Clark (USA-ret.), who inveighed against pro
test, draft-card burners, and Supreme Court
expansion of the criteria for conscientious ob
jection.
Gen. Clark said that he opposed the exemp
tion for someone who "can't prove belief in a
Supreme Being rather than in a tobacco plant
or "something." He confessed exasperation at
"a breed of cat running around" who did not
"want to fight... to go to war," who was "anti-
Vietnam all the time."
When a spokesman for the Nat'onal Federa
tion for the Blind requested that the blind be
allowed to join the army to perform some ad
ministrative jobs, Sen. Russell said that his tes
timony ought to bring a "blush of shame" to
those who had protested the draft.
Other witnesses represented the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, American
Legion, United Church of Christ, and National
Guard Association. The Young Americans for
Freedom argued for voluntary service, in order

"There was no time to anticipate the change, and no
time to anticipate the danger."

that the youth might affirm their patriotism
without compulsion.
The university voice was significantly ab
sent from these hearings. And the cause was
not taken up. Marshall and Hershey explained
proposals for a lottery, but did not buck the
committee's evident hostility to ending under
graduate deferments.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.-Mass.) testified
that the Manpower Subcommittee, of which
he was acting chairman, favored induction of
19-year-olds first, lottery, and an end to grad
uate deferments.
On the crucial point of undergraduate de
ferments, Kennedy said he favored them in
peacetime, but not at war. The question be
came: "When is the country at war?" And the
Senator replied, under questioning, that Viet
nam should definitely be considered "war
time."
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R.-Ore.) proposed a vol
untary service. The suggestion, later to be hotly
debated and roundly defeated when he sub
mitted it as an amendment, completes the cata
logue of points of view. What was emotionally
felt in the Senate was to be liberalized and
sharpened in the House. In the process, Presi
dent Johnson, his Special Commission, and
graduate education were softly retired from
the debate.
Gen. Clark's proposal to maintain under
graduate deferments was written into the com
mittee's Report of May 4. A continuing supply
of college graduates was important to the na
tion, and this overrode arguments of che in

equity for those who could not afford to go to
college.
Unremarked was the importance to the na
tion of the graduate students who would have
to take their places in the army, or the impor
tance of a supply of teachers for these impor
tant undergraduates.
The Senate, with nays from Wayne Morse
(D.-Ore.) and Ernest Gruening (D.-Alaska),
passed S 1432 on May 11. Hatfield's amend
ment was that "Whenever . . . reassessment
reveals that a system of involuntary inductions
can be replaced by a system based on the free
choice of individuals at an over-all cost the na
tion can reasonably afford, Congress should
act to facilitate the prompt termination of mili

tary inductions. . . It was defeated, 9-69.
Tlie Bill did not include the President's pro
posal to reverse induction priorities from the
oldest first to the youngest first, in ages 19-26.
It was, however, approved in the Armed Ser
vices Committee Report. The Marshall Com
mission had argued that the old law creatcd a
long period of painful uncertainty for many
young men. To this, Sen. Russell made the in
credible argument that it was only true "if one
begins with the idea that avoidance of service
is an objective." As though the Ph.D. candi
dates and young men starting their own busi
nesses waited for the draft as a stimulating
change of pace!
The House, with legislation against draft
card burners recently to its credit, was even
less kindly disposed. The House Armed Ser
vices Committee reported out a bill which
tightened restrictions for conscientious objec
tors and urged the Justice Department to pro
ceed quickly in prosecuting draft law violators.
Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D.-La.), third
ranking Democrat on the Committee, took up
the subject of draft protest: "Let's forget about
the first amendment. I know that will be the
refuge of the Supreme Court, I recognize that.
But at least the effort can be made and the
demonstration given the American people cer
tainly that the Department of Justice and most
assuredly the Congress is determined to elimi
nate this rat-infested area in this country."
But he was fulminating about a side issue.
Crucial provisions of the bill reported out of

rective, to institute a lottery or to abolish un
dergraduate deferments, unless those changes
were "in the national interest." If they were
abolished, potential doctors, lawyers, and
other specialists would fulfill their military ob
ligation before completing their professional
training. So the committee argued.
No one from the universities was present to
suggest that, doctors aside, this argument
could be used to oppose what was being done
to graduate study.
The House version was debated on the floor
on May 25. An amendment by Otis G. Pike
(D.-N.Y.) to eliminate undergraduate defer
ments was rejected 77-160. As in the Senate,
arguments in favor were based solely on eq
uity. The pinch which devolved upon graduate
study never came to light.
Objection was raised that debate had been
scheduled on the night following action on
the controversial elementary and secondary
education bill, which dragged on until 1:40
a.m. But the Congressmen soldiered on to final
passage of S 1432 just before midnight. The
vote was 362-9.
House and Senate versions were broadly dif
ferent. In the conference to resolve the two,
House members held tenaciously to their ver
sion. At a crucial time, Sen. Russell switched
sides and gained an absolute ban on lottery,
instead of the House's request for 60-day noti
fication. The final bill, cleared by Congress on
June 20, left the President only two areas in
which to maneuver.
• He could move through the National Se
curity Council to defer some areas of graduate
study as "in the national interest."
• He could declare a prime age group, in
structing local boards to order for induction a
certain "mix" of ages.
Only one major administration - sponsored
provision survived: the President was still free
to take 19-year-olds first.
Sen. Russell, presiding in the ruins of a bill
which bore little affinity to the one he had in
troduced, gave credit to a mute, but kindred
spirit:
"It is significant to me, in reading these com
munications here today, that we have not had
anything from General Hershey objecting to
this bill. He has not expressed any displeasure
with it."

Why did Congress arrive at this version of
the new draft law? One has the impression that
irritat on and urgency were important. The
Senate was especially pressed, with Sen. Thom
as Dodd (D.-Conn.) up for scrutiny in a few
days.
A view of higher education was also mani
fest. Attempts selectively to defer undergrad
uates had met with strenuous complaints.
Some universities refused to disclose class
ranking. Others conducted "draft tests" to the
accompaniment of demonstrations and sit-ins.
The temptation to a washing of hands, with
respect to undergraduates, was powerful.
Secondly, the Eighty-ninth Congress had
been very generous to universities, in grant,
loan and gift. Draft-test protest, Vietnam pro
test, and general hostility seemed, at least, un
grateful.
Having forsaken the undergraduates, the
Congress needed men from somewhere. Lack
ing a sense of what graduate schools did, per
haps suspecting them, Congress took the ob
vious step.

as an American value. Rut for most Americans,

Senate Bill 1432 and the Executive Order
putting it into effect were signed by President
Johnson on June 30, 1967. The next day, Burke
Marshall was quoted by The New York Times
as saying, "In my judgment, the new bill makes
the system worse than it was before."
The Executive Order set the demise of most
graduate deferments for next year. Universities
were about to get onto the scent.
According to provisions which remained in
effect with the new law, the oldest in the man
power pool were to be taken first. But anyone
who had had a student deferment at any time
went into the "most vulnerable" category.
The result would be to wipe out some areas
of graduate study and to debilitate others, un
less' the President made some change with a
new Executive Order. It is understandable that
the universities did not realize this at once. It
appears not to have dawned on the lawmakers
themselves.
But opposition began to be vocalized. John
F. Morse of the American Council on Educa
tion circulated memoranda. And the graduate
deans started alerting people to the danger.
On August 8, the Council of Graduate
Schools held an emergency meeting of its Se
lective Service Committee. Two statements
later emerged with the support of the CGE
Executive Committee and the Association of
Graduate Schools.
One statement began, "The Military Selec
tive Service Act of 1967 and the President's Ex
ecutive Order 11360, ending deferments of
graduate students except those in health sci
ences and those in certain other, not yet desig
nated disciplines, will have immediate serious
consequences for all graduate education and
will produce an inevitable deterioration of all
higher education for an unpredictable number
of years."
The first task was to stop the President from
designating additional areas of exemption.

These, the Council said, would inevitably "im
pede the strength and warp the free intellec
tual development of the United States." While
the President is still free to do this, the cam
paign appears to have succeeded.
Other recommendations were similar to the
Marshall Commission: selection at an early
age; advance notice (perhaps a year); and free
dom to complete a degree program in prog
ress. The Commission had urged an end to all
student deferments. But with Congress cutting
off the supply of undergraduates for the army,
the CGS request for reconsideration of gradu
ate deferments was reasonable.
• • »
Will the draft law be changed again before it
has run its four-year course?
Walter Findeisen, National Service Officer
at Stanford, doubts it. The Army prefers 19-
year-olds. And Findeisen believes that draft
boards will show just enough favoritisn. to
graduate students to prevent Congress from re
opening the unpleasant debate.
He further doubts that the President will
designate a prime age, since to do so would be
to incur "the wrath of every local PTA mem
ber in the United States."
Meanwhile, the local boards, which the Mar
shall Commission wanted to replace with na
tional standards, will continue to do what Fin
deisen called their "agonizing, thankless, God
forsaken job."
And Cen. Lewis B. Hershey will join with
the Congress in avoiding discussion of substan
tive goals and consequences: "I'm as popular
as a bastard at a family reunion with the mili
tary because they don't want to run a correc
tional institution. But they have the know-how
to teach discipline. It's not a matter of author
ity for the sake of authority. Authority is just a

ber in the United States."
Meanwhile, the local boards, which the Mar
shall Commission wanted to replace with na
tional standards, will continue to do what Fin
deisen called their "agonizing, thankless, God
forsaken job."
And Cen. Lewis B. Hershey will join with
the Congress in avoiding discussion of substan
tive goals and consequences: "I'm as popular
as a bastard at a family reunion with the mili
tary because they don't want to run a correc
tional institution. But they have the know-how
to teach discipline. It's not a matter of author
ity for the sake of authority. Authority is just a
method of getting things done without being
reduced to chaos. . . . The question is, what
are you running? A force to garrison the world,
or a training school for citizens? 1 guess I
straddle that one."


Dean Whitaker warns that the new draft law
will cause "serious disruption of ad
vanced training."
Congress called the tune for a new draft
law last summer. Only by autumn did
somnolent universities realize that the
legislators were asking them to pay the piper.
The new law looks like siphoning off all eli
gible graduate students, leaving, in Nathan
Pusey's phrase, "the lame, the halt, the blind,
the female." Add "the foreign" and the Presi
dent of Harvard was not exaggerating.
Many people in Washington speculated that
the President would modify the law by Presi
dential directive this week. But at press time,
no one had heard a peep ; much less an Execu
tive Order.
Even with a Presidential directive, graduate
schools would be in trouble. Not that total en
rollment would plunge. The President can
still invalidate dire and reasonable warnings
that the number of graduate students might
be cut in half.
But for certain areas, curtailment and even
crippling are seriously discussed. Engineering,
with a high proportion of foreign students,
cannot assimilate them if their vulnerable do
mestic fellows must go to serve. A heavy call
would deny them the chance to get an "Ameri
can" education.
Departments which rely on teaching assist
ants to conduct classes and on lab assistants to
conduct research must hope for new men, new
methods, or more than their share of good
luck to carry on daily business. Laboratories
will be hit first. Because many TA's are third
and fourth-year men, the problem will lie hid
den for a couple of years, at which time short
ages are on the cards.
Finally, professional schools —law and busi
ness—stand to receive a body blow from the
new legislation. Unprotected by foreign and
female, looking altogether like healthy Ameri
cans, their students are going to dwindle. Even
under the best conditions, they could be
halved.
It is this list of expected consequences which
prompted Virgil K. Whitaker, Dean of the
Graduate Division, to warn: "The immediate
plight of the universities will be severe. But
what really matters in the long run is the seri
ous disruption of advanced training upon
which the United States must rely to maintain
intellectual leadership in world affairs and
technological and industrial progress at home."
How did this law, Senate Bill 1432, June 30,
1967, go through without a clamor from the
higher learning?
The full answer comes with a look at delib
erations in a frustrated Ninetieth Congress.
But three factors put universities off their
guard from the start.
No major revision of the Selective Service
Act had been made since 1951. Congress was
reluctant to address the statute at all, and hur
ried its alteration through. President Johnson
signed the bill hours before the old one was to
expire. There was no time to anticipate the
change, and no sign to anticipate the danger.
Second, a very able Presidential Advisory
Commission on Selective Service made its re
port in February, 1967. Chairman was former
Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall,
and its members included President Kingman
Brewster of Yale, John A. McCone, and John
Courtney Murray.
The Commission's recommendations were
thoughtful and reasonable. If they were not
especially daring, they contained nothing to
disrupt or distort the universities. And the
President, with Sen. Richard Russell (D.-Ga.)
floor managing, seemed a good bet to get them
written into law.
Finally, the draft is a circus of many rings.
Those who opposed it unconditionally, some
suggesting a voluntary service alternative, took
themselves out of the political process. To
most Congressmen, voluntary service is not
only pie-in-t he-sky, but it casts doubt on the
good intentions and patriotism of American
men who answer the draft call and serve.
Other rings, such as conscientious objection,

classification of protestors, and the legitimacy
of the draft in our present "peacetime," let out
emotion, and served to obscure the salient con
sequences of the new law. Kingman Brewster
was moved to action by Gen. Lewis B. Fer
shey's dictum on protestors Oct. 26, but not by
the repudiation in Congress of his Commis
sion's valuable recommendations.

On April 5, 1967, Sen. Russell introduced
the administration bill. A week later, hearings
were opened in the Senate Armed Services
Committee. The tone was set by Gen. Mark W.
Clark (USA-ret.), who inveighed against pro
test, draft-card burners, and Supreme Court
expansion of the criteria for conscientious ob
jection.
Gen. Clark said that he opposed the exemp
tion for someone who "can't prove belief in a
Supreme Being rather than in a tobacco plant
or "something." He confessed exasperation at
"a breed of cat running around" who did not
"want to fight... to go to war," who was "anti-
Vietnam all the time."
When a spokesman for the Nat'onal Federa
tion for the Blind requested that the blind be
allowed to join the army to perform some ad
ministrative jobs, Sen. Russell said that his tes
timony ought to bring a "blush of shame" to
those who had protested the draft.
Other witnesses represented the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, American
Legion, United Church of Christ, and National
Guard Association. The Young Americans for
Freedom argued for voluntary service, in order

"There was no time to anticipate the change, and no
time to anticipate the danger."

that the youth might affirm their patriotism
without compulsion.
The university voice was significantly ab
sent from these hearings. And the cause was
not taken up. Marshall and Hershey explained
proposals for a lottery, but did not buck the
committee's evident hostility to ending under
graduate deferments.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.-Mass.) testified
that the Manpower Subcommittee, of which
he was acting chairman, favored induction of
19-year-olds first, lottery, and an end to grad
uate deferments.
On the crucial point of undergraduate de
ferments, Kennedy said he favored them in
peacetime, but not at war. The question be
came: "When is the country at war?" And the
Senator replied, under questioning, that Viet
nam should definitely be considered "war
time."
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R.-Ore.) proposed a vol
untary service. The suggestion, later to be hotly
debated and roundly defeated when he sub
mitted it as an amendment, completes the cata
logue of points of view. What was emotionally
felt in the Senate was to be liberalized and
sharpened in the House. In the process, Presi
dent Johnson, his Special Commission, and
graduate education were softly retired from
the debate.
Gen. Clark's proposal to maintain under
graduate deferments was written into the com
mittee's Report of May 4. A continuing supply
of college graduates was important to the na
tion, and this overrode arguments of che in

equity for those who could not afford to go to
college.
Unremarked was the importance to the na
tion of the graduate students who would have
to take their places in the army, or the impor
tance of a supply of teachers for these impor
tant undergraduates.
The Senate, with nays from Wayne Morse
(D.-Ore.) and Ernest Gruening (D.-Alaska),
passed S 1432 on May 11. Hatfield's amend
ment was that "Whenever . . . reassessment
reveals that a system of involuntary inductions
can be replaced by a system based on the free
choice of individuals at an over-all cost the na
tion can reasonably afford, Congress should
act to facilitate the prompt termination of mili

tary inductions. . . It was defeated, 9-69.
Tlie Bill did not include the President's pro
posal to reverse induction priorities from the
oldest first to the youngest first, in ages 19-26.
It was, however, approved in the Armed Ser
vices Committee Report. The Marshall Com
mission had argued that the old law creatcd a
long period of painful uncertainty for many
young men. To this, Sen. Russell made the in
credible argument that it was only true "if one
begins with the idea that avoidance of service
is an objective." As though the Ph.D. candi
dates and young men starting their own busi
nesses waited for the draft as a stimulating
change of pace!
The House, with legislation against draft
card burners recently to its credit, was even
less kindly disposed. The House Armed Ser
vices Committee reported out a bill which
tightened restrictions for conscientious objec
tors and urged the Justice Department to pro
ceed quickly in prosecuting draft law violators.
Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D.-La.), third
ranking Democrat on the Committee, took up
the subject of draft protest: "Let's forget about
the first amendment. I know that will be the
refuge of the Supreme Court, I recognize that.
But at least the effort can be made and the
demonstration given the American people cer
tainly that the Department of Justice and most
assuredly the Congress is determined to elimi
nate this rat-infested area in this country."
But he was fulminating about a side issue.
Crucial provisions of the bill reported out of
committee barred the President's way, by di-

rective, to institute a lottery or to abolish un
dergraduate deferments, unless those changes
were "in the national interest." If they were
abolished, potential doctors, lawyers, and
other specialists would fulfill their military ob
ligation before completing their professional
training. So the committee argued.
No one from the universities was present to
suggest that, doctors aside, this argument
could be used to oppose what was being done
to graduate study.
The House version was debated on the floor
on May 25. An amendment by Otis G. Pike
(D.-N.Y.) to eliminate undergraduate defer
ments was rejected 77-160. As in the Senate,
arguments in favor were based solely on eq
uity. The pinch which devolved upon graduate
study never came to light.
Objection was raised that debate had been
scheduled on the night following action on
the controversial elementary and secondary
education bill, which dragged on until 1:40
a.m. But the Congressmen soldiered on to final
passage of S 1432 just before midnight. The
vote was 362-9.
House and Senate versions were broadly dif
ferent. In the conference to resolve the two,
House members held tenaciously to their ver
sion. At a crucial time, Sen. Russell switched
sides and gained an absolute ban on lottery,
instead of the House's request for 60-day noti
fication. The final bill, cleared by Congress on
June 20, left the President only two areas in
which to maneuver.
• He could move through the National Se
curity Council to defer some areas of graduate
study as "in the national interest."
• He could declare a prime age group, in
structing local boards to order for induction a
certain "mix" of ages.
Only one major administration - sponsored
provision survived: the President was still free
to take 19-year-olds first.
Sen. Russell, presiding in the ruins of a bill
which bore little affinity to the one he had in
troduced, gave credit to a mute, but kindred
spirit:
"It is significant to me, in reading these com
munications here today, that we have not had
anything from General Hershey objecting to
this bill. He has not expressed any displeasure
with it."

Why did Congress arrive at this version of
the new draft law? One has the impression that
irritat on and urgency were important. The
Senate was especially pressed, with Sen. Thom
as Dodd (D.-Conn.) up for scrutiny in a few
days.
A view of higher education was also mani
fest. Attempts selectively to defer undergrad
uates had met with strenuous complaints.
Some universities refused to disclose class
ranking. Others conducted "draft tests" to the
accompaniment of demonstrations and sit-ins.
The temptation to a washing of hands, with
respect to undergraduates, was powerful.
Secondly, the Eighty-ninth Congress had
been very generous to universities, in grant,
loan and gift. Draft-test protest, Vietnam pro
test, and general hostility seemed, at least, un
grateful.
Having forsaken the undergraduates, the
Congress needed men from somewhere. Lack
ing a sense of what graduate schools did, per
haps suspecting them, Congress took the ob
vious step.

as an American value. Rut for most Americans,

Senate Bill 1432 and the Executive Order
putting it into effect were signed by President
Johnson on June 30, 1967. The next day, Burke
Marshall was quoted by The New York Times
as saying, "In my judgment, the new bill makes
the system worse than it was before."
The Executive Order set the demise of most
graduate deferments for next year. Universities
were about to get onto the scent.
According to provisions which remained in
effect with the new law, the oldest in the man
power pool were to be taken first. But anyone
who had had a student deferment at any time
went into the "most vulnerable" category.
The result would be to wipe out some areas
of graduate study and to debilitate others, un
less' the President made some change with a
new Executive Order. It is understandable that
the universities did not realize this at once. It
appears not to have dawned on the lawmakers
themselves.
But opposition began to be vocalized. John
F. Morse of the American Council on Educa
tion circulated memoranda. And the graduate
deans started alerting people to the danger.
On August 8, the Council of Graduate
Schools held an emergency meeting of its Se
lective Service Committee. Two statements
later emerged with the support of the CGE
Executive Committee and the Association of
Graduate Schools.
One statement began, "The Military Selec
tive Service Act of 1967 and the President's Ex
ecutive Order 11360, ending deferments of
graduate students except those in health sci
ences and those in certain other, not yet desig
nated disciplines, will have immediate serious
consequences for all graduate education and
will produce an inevitable deterioration of all
higher education for an unpredictable number
of years."
The first task was to stop the President from
designating additional areas of exemption.

These, the Council said, would inevitably "im
pede the strength and warp the free intellec
tual development of the United States." While
the President is still free to do this, the cam
paign appears to have succeeded.
Other recommendations were similar to the
Marshall Commission: selection at an early
age; advance notice (perhaps a year); and free
dom to complete a degree program in prog
ress. The Commission had urged an end to all
student deferments. But with Congress cutting
off the supply of undergraduates for the army,
the CGS request for reconsideration of gradu
ate deferments was reasonable.

Will the draft law be changed again before it
has run its four-year course?
Walter Findeisen, National Service Officer
at Stanford, doubts it. The Army prefers 19-
year-olds. And Findeisen believes that draft
boards will show just enough favoritisn. to
graduate students to prevent Congress from re
opening the unpleasant debate.
He further doubts that the President will
designate a prime age, since to do so would be
to incur "the wrath of every local PTA mem
ber in the United States."
Meanwhile, the local boards, which the Mar
shall Commission wanted to replace with na
tional standards, will continue to do what Fin

Will the draft law be changed again before it
has run its four-year course?
Walter Findeisen, National Service Officer
at Stanford, doubts it. The Army prefers 19-
year-olds. And Findeisen believes that draft
boards will show just enough favoritisn. to
graduate students to prevent Congress from re
opening the unpleasant debate.
He further doubts that the President will
designate a prime age, since to do so would be
to incur "the wrath of every local PTA mem
ber in the United States."
Meanwhile, the local boards, which the Mar
shall Commission wanted to replace with na
tional standards, will continue to do what Fin
deisen called their "agonizing, thankless, God
forsaken job."
And Cen. Lewis B. Hershey will join with
the Congress in avoiding discussion of substan
tive goals and consequences: "I'm as popular
as a bastard at a family reunion with the mili
tary because they don't want to run a correc
tional institution. But they have the know-how
to teach discipline. It's not a matter of author
ity for the sake of authority. Authority is just a
method of getting things done without being
reduced to chaos. . . . The question is, what
are you running? A force to garrison the world,
or a training school for citizens? 1 guess I
straddle that one."


Dean Whitaker warns that the new draft law
will cause "serious disruption of ad
vanced training."
Congress called the tune for a new draft
law last summer. Only by autumn did
somnolent universities realize that the
legislators were asking them to pay the piper.
The new law looks like siphoning off all eli
gible graduate students, leaving, in Nathan
Pusey's phrase, "the lame, the halt, the blind,
the female." Add "the foreign" and the Presi
dent of Harvard was not exaggerating.
Many people in Washington speculated that
the President would modify the law by Presi
dential directive this week. But at press time,
no one had heard a peep ; much less an Execu
tive Order.
Even with a Presidential directive, graduate
schools would be in trouble. Not that total en
rollment would plunge. The President can
still invalidate dire and reasonable warnings
that the number of graduate students might
be cut in half.
But for certain areas, curtailment and even
crippling are seriously discussed. Engineering,
with a high proportion of foreign students,
cannot assimilate them if their vulnerable do
mestic fellows must go to serve. A heavy call
would deny them the chance to get an "Ameri
can" education.
Departments which rely on teaching assist
ants to conduct classes and on lab assistants to
conduct research must hope for new men, new
methods, or more than their share of good
luck to carry on daily business. Laboratories
will be hit first. Because many TA's are third
and fourth-year men, the problem will lie hid
den for a couple of years, at which time short
ages are on the cards.
Finally, professional schools —law and busi
ness—stand to receive a body blow from the
new legislation. Unprotected by foreign and
female, looking altogether like healthy Ameri
cans, their students are going to dwindle. Even
under the best conditions, they could be
halved.
It is this list of expected consequences which
prompted Virgil K. Whitaker, Dean of the
Graduate Division, to warn: "The immediate
plight of the universities will be severe. But
what really matters in the long run is the seri
ous disruption of advanced training upon
which the United States must rely to maintain
intellectual leadership in world affairs and
technological and industrial progress at home."
How did this law, Senate Bill 1432, June 30,
1967, go through without a clamor from the
higher learning?
The full answer comes with a look at delib
erations in a frustrated Ninetieth Congress.
But three factors put universities off their
guard from the start.
No major revision of the Selective Service
Act had been made since 1951. Congress was
reluctant to address the statute at all, and hur
ried its alteration through. President Johnson
signed the bill hours before the old one was to
expire. There was no time to anticipate the
change, and no sign to anticipate the danger.
Second, a very able Presidential Advisory
Commission on Selective Service made its re
port in February, 1967. Chairman was former
Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall,
and its members included President Kingman
Brewster of Yale, John A. McCone, and John
Courtney Murray.
The Commission's recommendations were
thoughtful and reasonable. If they were not
especially daring, they contained nothing to
disrupt or distort the universities. And the
President, with Sen. Richard Russell (D.-Ga.)
floor managing, seemed a good bet to get them
written into law.
Finally, the draft is a circus of many rings.
Those who opposed it unconditionally, some
suggesting a voluntary service alternative, took
themselves out of the political process. To
most Congressmen, voluntary service is not
only pie-in-t he-sky, but it casts doubt on the
good intentions and patriotism of American
men who answer the draft call and serve.
Other rings, such as conscientious objection,

classification of protestors, and the legitimacy
of the draft in our present "peacetime," let out
emotion, and served to obscure the salient con
sequences of the new law. Kingman Brewster
was moved to action by Gen. Lewis B. Fer
shey's dictum on protestors Oct. 26, but not by
the repudiation in Congress of his Commis
sion's valuable recommendations.

On April 5, 1967, Sen. Russell introduced
the administration bill. A week later, hearings
were opened in the Senate Armed Services
Committee. The tone was set by Gen. Mark W.
Clark (USA-ret.), who inveighed against pro
test, draft-card burners, and Supreme Court
expansion of the criteria for conscientious ob
jection.
Gen. Clark said that he opposed the exemp
tion for someone who "can't prove belief in a
Supreme Being rather than in a tobacco plant
or "something." He confessed exasperation at
"a breed of cat running around" who did not
"want to fight... to go to war," who was "anti-
Vietnam all the time."
When a spokesman for the Nat'onal Federa
tion for the Blind requested that the blind be
allowed to join the army to perform some ad
ministrative jobs, Sen. Russell said that his tes
timony ought to bring a "blush of shame" to
those who had protested the draft.
Other witnesses represented the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, American
Legion, United Church of Christ, and National
Guard Association. The Young Americans for
Freedom argued for voluntary service, in order

"There was no time to anticipate the change, and no
time to anticipate the danger."

that the youth might affirm their patriotism
without compulsion.
The university voice was significantly ab
sent from these hearings. And the cause was
not taken up. Marshall and Hershey explained
proposals for a lottery, but did not buck the
committee's evident hostility to ending under
graduate deferments.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.-Mass.) testified
that the Manpower Subcommittee, of which
he was acting chairman, favored induction of
19-year-olds first, lottery, and an end to grad
uate deferments.
On the crucial point of undergraduate de
ferments, Kennedy said he favored them in
peacetime, but not at war. The question be
came: "When is the country at war?" And the
Senator replied, under questioning, that Viet
nam should definitely be considered "war
time."
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R.-Ore.) proposed a vol
untary service. The suggestion, later to be hotly
debated and roundly defeated when he sub
mitted it as an amendment, completes the cata
logue of points of view. What was emotionally
felt in the Senate was to be liberalized and
sharpened in the House. In the process, Presi
dent Johnson, his Special Commission, and
graduate education were softly retired from
the debate.
Gen. Clark's proposal to maintain under
graduate deferments was written into the com
mittee's Report of May 4. A continuing supply
of college graduates was important to the na
tion, and this overrode arguments of che in

equity for those who could not afford to go to
college.
Unremarked was the importance to the na
tion of the graduate students who would have
to take their places in the army, or the impor
tance of a supply of teachers for these impor
tant undergraduates.
The Senate, with nays from Wayne Morse
(D.-Ore.) and Ernest Gruening (D.-Alaska),
passed S 1432 on May 11. Hatfield's amend
ment was that "Whenever . . . reassessment
reveals that a system of involuntary inductions
can be replaced by a system based on the free
choice of individuals at an over-all cost the na
tion can reasonably afford, Congress should
act to facilitate the prompt termination of mili

tary inductions. . . It was defeated, 9-69.
Tlie Bill did not include the President's pro
posal to reverse induction priorities from the
oldest first to the youngest first, in ages 19-26.
It was, however, approved in the Armed Ser
vices Committee Report. The Marshall Com
mission had argued that the old law creatcd a
long period of painful uncertainty for many
young men. To this, Sen. Russell made the in
credible argument that it was only true "if one
begins with the idea that avoidance of service
is an objective." As though the Ph.D. candi
dates and young men starting their own busi
nesses waited for the draft as a stimulating
change of pace!
The House, with legislation against draft
card burners recently to its credit, was even
less kindly disposed. The House Armed Ser
vices Committee reported out a bill which
tightened restrictions for conscientious objec
tors and urged the Justice Department to pro
ceed quickly in prosecuting draft law violators.
Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D.-La.), third
ranking Democrat on the Committee, took up
the subject of draft protest: "Let's forget about
the first amendment. I know that will be the
refuge of the Supreme Court, I recognize that.
But at least the effort can be made and the
demonstration given the American people cer
tainly that the Department of Justice and most
assuredly the Congress is determined to elimi
nate this rat-infested area in this country."
But he was fulminating about a side issue.
Crucial provisions of the bill reported out of

rective, to institute a lottery or to abolish un
dergraduate deferments, unless those changes
were "in the national interest." If they were
abolished, potential doctors, lawyers, and
other specialists would fulfill their military ob
ligation before completing their professional
training. So the committee argued.
No one from the universities was present to
suggest that, doctors aside, this argument
could be used to oppose what was being done
to graduate study.
The House version was debated on the floor
on May 25. An amendment by Otis G. Pike
(D.-N.Y.) to eliminate undergraduate defer
ments was rejected 77-160. As in the Senate,
arguments in favor were based solely on eq
uity. The pinch which devolved upon graduate
study never came to light.
Objection was raised that debate had been
scheduled on the night following action on
the controversial elementary and secondary
education bill, which dragged on until 1:40
a.m. But the Congressmen soldiered on to final
passage of S 1432 just before midnight. The
vote was 362-9.
House and Senate versions were broadly dif
ferent. In the conference to resolve the two,
House members held tenaciously to their ver
sion. At a crucial time, Sen. Russell switched
sides and gained an absolute ban on lottery,
instead of the House's request for 60-day noti
fication. The final bill, cleared by Congress on
June 20, left the President only two areas in
which to maneuver.
• He could move through the National Se
curity Council to defer some areas of graduate
study as "in the national interest."
• He could declare a prime age group, in
structing local boards to order for induction a
certain "mix" of ages.
Only one major administration - sponsored
provision survived: the President was still free
to take 19-year-olds first.
Sen. Russell, presiding in the ruins of a bill
which bore little affinity to the one he had in
troduced, gave credit to a mute, but kindred
spirit:
"It is significant to me, in reading these com
munications here today, that we have not had
anything from General Hershey objecting to
this bill. He has not expressed any displeasure
with it."

Why did Congress arrive at this version of
the new draft law? One has the impression that
irritat on and urgency were important. The
Senate was especially pressed, with Sen. Thom
as Dodd (D.-Conn.) up for scrutiny in a few
days.
A view of higher education was also mani
fest. Attempts selectively to defer undergrad
uates had met with strenuous complaints.
Some universities refused to disclose class
ranking. Others conducted "draft tests" to the
accompaniment of demonstrations and sit-ins.
The temptation to a washing of hands, with
respect to undergraduates, was powerful.
Secondly, the Eighty-ninth Congress had
been very generous to universities, in grant,
loan and gift. Draft-test protest, Vietnam pro
test, and general hostility seemed, at least, un
grateful.
Having forsaken the undergraduates, the
Congress needed men from somewhere. Lack
ing a sense of what graduate schools did, per
haps suspecting them, Congress took the ob
vious step.

Senate Bill 1432 and the Executive Order
putting it into effect were signed by President
Johnson on June 30, 1967. The next day, Burke
Marshall was quoted by The New York Times
as saying, "In my judgment, the new bill makes
the system worse than it was before."
The Executive Order set the demise of most
graduate deferments for next year. Universities
were about to get onto the scent.
According to provisions which remained in
effect with the new law, the oldest in the man
power pool were to be taken first. But anyone
who had had a student deferment at any time
went into the "most vulnerable" category.
The result would be to wipe out some areas
of graduate study and to debilitate others, un
less' the President made some change with a
new Executive Order. It is understandable that
the universities did not realize this at once. It
appears not to have dawned on the lawmakers
themselves.
But opposition began to be vocalized. John
F. Morse of the American Council on Educa
tion circulated memoranda. And the graduate
deans started alerting people to the danger.
On August 8, the Council of Graduate
Schools held an emergency meeting of its Se
lective Service Committee. Two statements
later emerged with the support of the CGE
Executive Committee and the Association of
Graduate Schools.
One statement began, "The Military Selec
tive Service Act of 1967 and the President's Ex
ecutive Order 11360, ending deferments of
graduate students except those in health sci
ences and those in certain other, not yet desig
nated disciplines, will have immediate serious
consequences for all graduate education and
will produce an inevitable deterioration of all
higher education for an unpredictable number
of years."
The first task was to stop the President from
designating additional areas of exemption.

These, the Council said, would inevitably "im
pede the strength and warp the free intellec
tual development of the United States." While
the President is still free to do this, the cam
paign appears to have succeeded.
Other recommendations were similar to the
Marshall Commission: selection at an early
age; advance notice (perhaps a year); and free
dom to complete a degree program in prog
ress. The Commission had urged an end to all
student deferments. But with Congress cutting
off the supply of undergraduates for the army,
the CGS request for reconsideration of gradu
ate deferments was reasonable.

paign appears to have succeeded.
Other recommendations were similar to the
Marshall Commission: selection at an early
age; advance notice (perhaps a year); and free
dom to complete a degree program in prog
ress. The Commission had urged an end to all
student deferments. But with Congress cutting
off the supply of undergraduates for the army,
the CGS request for reconsideration of gradu
ate deferments was reasonable.

Will the draft law be changed again before it
has run its four-year course?
Walter Findeisen, National Service Officer
at Stanford, doubts it. The Army prefers 19-
year-olds. And Findeisen believes that draft
boards will show just enough favoritisn. to
graduate students to prevent Congress from re
opening the unpleasant debate.
He further doubts that the President will
designate a prime age, since to do so would be
to incur "the wrath of every local PTA mem
ber in the United States."
Meanwhile, the local boards, which the Mar
shall Commission wanted to replace with na
tional standards, will continue to do what Fin
deisen called their "agonizing, thankless, God
forsaken job."
And Cen. Lewis B. Hershey will join with
the Congress in avoiding discussion of substan
tive goals and consequences: "I'm as popular
as a bastard at a family reunion with the mili
tary because they don't want to run a correc
tional institution. But they have the know-how
to teach discipline. It's not a matter of author
ity for the sake of authority. Authority is just a
method of getting things done without being
reduced to chaos. . . . The question is, what
are you running? A force to garrison the world,
or a training school for citizens? 1 guess I
straddle that one."


Dean Whitaker warns that the new draft law
will cause "serious disruption of ad
vanced training."
Congress called the tune for a new draft
law last summer. Only by autumn did
somnolent universities realize that the
legislators were asking them to pay the piper.
The new law looks like siphoning off all eli
gible graduate students, leaving, in Nathan
Pusey's phrase, "the lame, the halt, the blind,
the female." Add "the foreign" and the Presi
dent of Harvard was not exaggerating.
Many people in Washington speculated that
the President would modify the law by Presi
dential directive this week. But at press time,
no one had heard a peep ; much less an Execu
tive Order.
Even with a Presidential directive, graduate
schools would be in trouble. Not that total en
rollment would plunge. The President can
still invalidate dire and reasonable warnings
that the number of graduate students might
be cut in half.
But for certain areas, curtailment and even
crippling are seriously discussed. Engineering,
with a high proportion of foreign students,
cannot assimilate them if their vulnerable do
mestic fellows must go to serve. A heavy call
would deny them the chance to get an "Ameri
can" education.
Departments which rely on teaching assist
ants to conduct classes and on lab assistants to
conduct research must hope for new men, new
methods, or more than their share of good
luck to carry on daily business. Laboratories
will be hit first. Because many TA's are third
and fourth-year men, the problem will lie hid
den for a couple of years, at which time short
ages are on the cards.
Finally, professional schools —law and busi
ness—stand to receive a body blow from the
new legislation. Unprotected by foreign and
female, looking altogether like healthy Ameri
cans, their students are going to dwindle. Even
under the best conditions, they could be
halved.
It is this list of expected consequences which
prompted Virgil K. Whitaker, Dean of the
Graduate Division, to warn: "The immediate
plight of the universities will be severe. But
what really matters in the long run is the seri
ous disruption of advanced training upon
which the United States must rely to maintain
intellectual leadership in world affairs and
technological and industrial progress at home."
How did this law, Senate Bill 1432, June 30,
1967, go through without a clamor from the
higher learning?
The full answer comes with a look at delib
erations in a frustrated Ninetieth Congress.
But three factors put universities off their
guard from the start.
No major revision of the Selective Service
Act had been made since 1951. Congress was
reluctant to address the statute at all, and hur
ried its alteration through. President Johnson
signed the bill hours before the old one was to
expire. There was no time to anticipate the
change, and no sign to anticipate the danger.
Second, a very able Presidential Advisory
Commission on Selective Service made its re
port in February, 1967. Chairman was former
Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall,
and its members included President Kingman
Brewster of Yale, John A. McCone, and John
Courtney Murray.
The Commission's recommendations were
thoughtful and reasonable. If they were not
especially daring, they contained nothing to
disrupt or distort the universities. And the
President, with Sen. Richard Russell (D.-Ga.)
floor managing, seemed a good bet to get them
written into law.
Finally, the draft is a circus of many rings.
Those who opposed it unconditionally, some
suggesting a voluntary service alternative, took
themselves out of the political process. To
most Congressmen, voluntary service is not
only pie-in-t he-sky, but it casts doubt on the
good intentions and patriotism of American
men who answer the draft call and serve.
Other rings, such as conscientious objection,

classification of protestors, and the legitimacy
of the draft in our present "peacetime," let out
emotion, and served to obscure the salient con
sequences of the new law. Kingman Brewster
was moved to action by Gen. Lewis B. Fer
shey's dictum on protestors Oct. 26, but not by
the repudiation in Congress of his Commis
sion's valuable recommendations.

On April 5, 1967, Sen. Russell introduced
the administration bill. A week later, hearings
were opened in the Senate Armed Services
Committee. The tone was set by Gen. Mark W.
Clark (USA-ret.), who inveighed against pro
test, draft-card burners, and Supreme Court
expansion of the criteria for conscientious ob
jection.
Gen. Clark said that he opposed the exemp
tion for someone who "can't prove belief in a
Supreme Being rather than in a tobacco plant
or "something." He confessed exasperation at
"a breed of cat running around" who did not
"want to fight... to go to war," who was "anti-
Vietnam all the time."
When a spokesman for the Nat'onal Federa
tion for the Blind requested that the blind be
allowed to join the army to perform some ad
ministrative jobs, Sen. Russell said that his tes
timony ought to bring a "blush of shame" to
those who had protested the draft.
Other witnesses represented the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, American
Legion, United Church of Christ, and National
Guard Association. The Young Americans for
Freedom argued for voluntary service, in order

"There was no time to anticipate the change, and no
time to anticipate the danger."

that the youth might affirm their patriotism
without compulsion.
The university voice was significantly ab
sent from these hearings. And the cause was
not taken up. Marshall and Hershey explained
proposals for a lottery, but did not buck the
committee's evident hostility to ending under
graduate deferments.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.-Mass.) testified
that the Manpower Subcommittee, of which
he was acting chairman, favored induction of
19-year-olds first, lottery, and an end to grad
uate deferments.
On the crucial point of undergraduate de
ferments, Kennedy said he favored them in
peacetime, but not at war. The question be
came: "When is the country at war?" And the
Senator replied, under questioning, that Viet
nam should definitely be considered "war
time."
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R.-Ore.) proposed a vol
untary service. The suggestion, later to be hotly
debated and roundly defeated when he sub
mitted it as an amendment, completes the cata
logue of points of view. What was emotionally
felt in the Senate was to be liberalized and
sharpened in the House. In the process, Presi
dent Johnson, his Special Commission, and
graduate education were softly retired from
the debate.
Gen. Clark's proposal to maintain under
graduate deferments was written into the com
mittee's Report of May 4. A continuing supply
of college graduates was important to the na
tion, and this overrode arguments of che in

equity for those who could not afford to go to
college.
Unremarked was the importance to the na
tion of the graduate students who would have
to take their places in the army, or the impor
tance of a supply of teachers for these impor
tant undergraduates.
The Senate, with nays from Wayne Morse
(D.-Ore.) and Ernest Gruening (D.-Alaska),
passed S 1432 on May 11. Hatfield's amend
ment was that "Whenever . . . reassessment
reveals that a system of involuntary inductions
can be replaced by a system based on the free
choice of individuals at an over-all cost the na
tion can reasonably afford, Congress should
act to facilitate the prompt termination of mili

tary inductions. . . It was defeated, 9-69.
Tlie Bill did not include the President's pro
posal to reverse induction priorities from the
oldest first to the youngest first, in ages 19-26.
It was, however, approved in the Armed Ser
vices Committee Report. The Marshall Com
mission had argued that the old law creatcd a
long period of painful uncertainty for many
young men. To this, Sen. Russell made the in
credible argument that it was only true "if one
begins with the idea that avoidance of service
is an objective." As though the Ph.D. candi
dates and young men starting their own busi
nesses waited for the draft as a stimulating
change of pace!
The House, with legislation against draft
card burners recently to its credit, was even
less kindly disposed. The House Armed Ser
vices Committee reported out a bill which
tightened restrictions for conscientious objec
tors and urged the Justice Department to pro
ceed quickly in prosecuting draft law violators.
Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D.-La.), third
ranking Democrat on the Committee, took up
the subject of draft protest: "Let's forget about
the first amendment. I know that will be the
refuge of the Supreme Court, I recognize that.
But at least the effort can be made and the
demonstration given the American people cer
tainly that the Department of Justice and most
assuredly the Congress is determined to elimi
nate this rat-infested area in this country."
But he was fulminating about a side issue.
Crucial provisions of the bill reported out of
committee barred the President's way, by di-

rective, to institute a lottery or to abolish un
dergraduate deferments, unless those changes
were "in the national interest." If they were
abolished, potential doctors, lawyers, and
other specialists would fulfill their military ob
ligation before completing their professional
training. So the committee argued.
No one from the universities was present to
suggest that, doctors aside, this argument
could be used to oppose what was being done
to graduate study.
The House version was debated on the floor
on May 25. An amendment by Otis G. Pike
(D.-N.Y.) to eliminate undergraduate defer
ments was rejected 77-160. As in the Senate,
arguments in favor were based solely on eq
uity. The pinch which devolved upon graduate
study never came to light.
Objection was raised that debate had been
scheduled on the night following action on
the controversial elementary and secondary
education bill, which dragged on until 1:40
a.m. But the Congressmen soldiered on to final
passage of S 1432 just before midnight. The
vote was 362-9.
House and Senate versions were broadly dif
ferent. In the conference to resolve the two,
House members held tenaciously to their ver
sion. At a crucial time, Sen. Russell switched
sides and gained an absolute ban on lottery,
instead of the House's request for 60-day noti
fication. The final bill, cleared by Congress on
June 20, left the President only two areas in
which to maneuver.
• He could move through the National Se
curity Council to defer some areas of graduate
study as "in the national interest."
• He could declare a prime age group, in
structing local boards to order for induction a
certain "mix" of ages.
Only one major administration - sponsored
provision survived: the President was still free
to take 19-year-olds first.
Sen. Russell, presiding in the ruins of a bill
which bore little affinity to the one he had in
troduced, gave credit to a mute, but kindred
spirit:
"It is significant to me, in reading these com
munications here today, that we have not had
anything from General Hershey objecting to
this bill. He has not expressed any displeasure
with it."

Why did Congress arrive at this version of
the new draft law? One has the impression that
irritat on and urgency were important. The
Senate was especially pressed, with Sen. Thom
as Dodd (D.-Conn.) up for scrutiny in a few
days.
A view of higher education was also mani
fest. Attempts selectively to defer undergrad
uates had met with strenuous complaints.
Some universities refused to disclose class
ranking. Others conducted "draft tests" to the
accompaniment of demonstrations and sit-ins.
The temptation to a washing of hands, with
respect to undergraduates, was powerful.
Secondly, the Eighty-ninth Congress had
been very generous to universities, in grant,
loan and gift. Draft-test protest, Vietnam pro
test, and general hostility seemed, at least, un
grateful.
Having forsaken the undergraduates, the
Congress needed men from somewhere. Lack
ing a sense of what graduate schools did, per
haps suspecting them, Congress took the ob
vious step.

Senate Bill 1432 and the Executive Order
putting it into effect were signed by President
Johnson on June 30, 1967. The next day, Burke
Marshall was quoted by The New York Times
as saying, "In my judgment, the new bill makes
the system worse than it was before."
The Executive Order set the demise of most
graduate deferments for next year. Universities
were about to get onto the scent.
According to provisions which remained in
effect with the new law, the oldest in the man
power pool were to be taken first. But anyone
who had had a student deferment at any time
went into the "most vulnerable" category.
The result would be to wipe out some areas
of graduate study and to debilitate others, un
less' the President made some change with a
new Executive Order. It is understandable that
the universities did not realize this at once. It
appears not to have dawned on the lawmakers
themselves.
But opposition began to be vocalized. John
F. Morse of the American Council on Educa
tion circulated memoranda. And the graduate
deans started alerting people to the danger.
On August 8, the Council of Graduate
Schools held an emergency meeting of its Se
lective Service Committee. Two statements
later emerged with the support of the CGE
Executive Committee and the Association of
Graduate Schools.
One statement began, "The Military Selec
tive Service Act of 1967 and the President's Ex
ecutive Order 11360, ending deferments of
graduate students except those in health sci
ences and those in certain other, not yet desig
nated disciplines, will have immediate serious
consequences for all graduate education and
will produce an inevitable deterioration of all
higher education for an unpredictable number
of years."
The first task was to stop the President from
designating additional areas of exemption.

These, the Council said, would inevitably "im
pede the strength and warp the free intellec
tual development of the United States." While
the President is still free to do this, the cam
paign appears to have succeeded.
Other recommendations were similar to the
Marshall Commission: selection at an early
age; advance notice (perhaps a year); and free

ences and those in certain other, not yet desig
nated disciplines, will have immediate serious
consequences for all graduate education and
will produce an inevitable deterioration of all
higher education for an unpredictable number
of years."
The first task was to stop the President from
designating additional areas of exemption.

These, the Council said, would inevitably "im
pede the strength and warp the free intellec
tual development of the United States." While
the President is still free to do this, the cam
paign appears to have succeeded.
Other recommendations were similar to the
Marshall Commission: selection at an early
age; advance notice (perhaps a year); and free
dom to complete a degree program in prog
ress. The Commission had urged an end to all
student deferments. But with Congress cutting
off the supply of undergraduates for the army,
the CGS request for reconsideration of gradu
ate deferments was reasonable.

Will the draft law be changed again before it
has run its four-year course?
Walter Findeisen, National Service Officer
at Stanford, doubts it. The Army prefers 19-
year-olds. And Findeisen believes that draft
boards will show just enough favoritisn. to
graduate students to prevent Congress from re
opening the unpleasant debate.
He further doubts that the President will
designate a prime age, since to do so would be
to incur "the wrath of every local PTA mem
ber in the United States."
Meanwhile, the local boards, which the Mar
shall Commission wanted to replace with na
tional standards, will continue to do what Fin
deisen called their "agonizing, thankless, God
forsaken job."
And Cen. Lewis B. Hershey will join with
the Congress in avoiding discussion of substan
tive goals and consequences: "I'm as popular
as a bastard at a family reunion with the mili
tary because they don't want to run a correc
tional institution. But they have the know-how
to teach discipline. It's not a matter of author
ity for the sake of authority. Authority is just a
method of getting things done without being
reduced to chaos. . . . The question is, what
are you running? A force to garrison the world,
or a training school for citizens? 1 guess I
straddle that one."


Dean Whitaker warns that the new draft law
will cause "serious disruption of ad
vanced training."
Congress called the tune for a new draft
law last summer. Only by autumn did
somnolent universities realize that the
legislators were asking them to pay the piper.
The new law looks like siphoning off all eli
gible graduate students, leaving, in Nathan
Pusey's phrase, "the lame, the halt, the blind,
the female." Add "the foreign" and the Presi
dent of Harvard was not exaggerating.
Many people in Washington speculated that
the President would modify the law by Presi
dential directive this week. But at press time,
no one had heard a peep ; much less an Execu
tive Order.
Even with a Presidential directive, graduate
schools would be in trouble. Not that total en
rollment would plunge. The President can
still invalidate dire and reasonable warnings
that the number of graduate students might
be cut in half.
But for certain areas, curtailment and even
crippling are seriously discussed. Engineering,
with a high proportion of foreign students,
cannot assimilate them if their vulnerable do
mestic fellows must go to serve. A heavy call
would deny them the chance to get an "Ameri
can" education.
Departments which rely on teaching assist
ants to conduct classes and on lab assistants to
conduct research must hope for new men, new
methods, or more than their share of good
luck to carry on daily business. Laboratories
will be hit first. Because many TA's are third
and fourth-year men, the problem will lie hid
den for a couple of years, at which time short
ages are on the cards.
Finally, professional schools —law and busi
ness—stand to receive a body blow from the
new legislation. Unprotected by foreign and
female, looking altogether like healthy Ameri
cans, their students are going to dwindle. Even
under the best conditions, they could be
halved.
It is this list of expected consequences which
prompted Virgil K. Whitaker, Dean of the
Graduate Division, to warn: "The immediate
plight of the universities will be severe. But
what really matters in the long run is the seri
ous disruption of advanced training upon
which the United States must rely to maintain
intellectual leadership in world affairs and
technological and industrial progress at home."
How did this law, Senate Bill 1432, June 30,
1967, go through without a clamor from the
higher learning?
The full answer comes with a look at delib
erations in a frustrated Ninetieth Congress.
But three factors put universities off their
guard from the start.
No major revision of the Selective Service
Act had been made since 1951. Congress was
reluctant to address the statute at all, and hur
ried its alteration through. President Johnson
signed the bill hours before the old one was to
expire. There was no time to anticipate the
change, and no sign to anticipate the danger.
Second, a very able Presidential Advisory
Commission on Selective Service made its re
port in February, 1967. Chairman was former
Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall,
and its members included President Kingman
Brewster of Yale, John A. McCone, and John
Courtney Murray.
The Commission's recommendations were
thoughtful and reasonable. If they were not
especially daring, they contained nothing to
disrupt or distort the universities. And the
President, with Sen. Richard Russell (D.-Ga.)
floor managing, seemed a good bet to get them
written into law.
Finally, the draft is a circus of many rings.
Those who opposed it unconditionally, some
suggesting a voluntary service alternative, took
themselves out of the political process. To
most Congressmen, voluntary service is not
only pie-in-t he-sky, but it casts doubt on the
good intentions and patriotism of American
men who answer the draft call and serve.
Other rings, such as conscientious objection,

classification of protestors, and the legitimacy
of the draft in our present "peacetime," let out
emotion, and served to obscure the salient con
sequences of the new law. Kingman Brewster
was moved to action by Gen. Lewis B. Fer
shey's dictum on protestors Oct. 26, but not by
the repudiation in Congress of his Commis
sion's valuable recommendations.

On April 5, 1967, Sen. Russell introduced
the administration bill. A week later, hearings
were opened in the Senate Armed Services
Committee. The tone was set by Gen. Mark W.
Clark (USA-ret.), who inveighed against pro
test, draft-card burners, and Supreme Court
expansion of the criteria for conscientious ob
jection.
Gen. Clark said that he opposed the exemp
tion for someone who "can't prove belief in a
Supreme Being rather than in a tobacco plant
or "something." He confessed exasperation at
"a breed of cat running around" who did not
"want to fight... to go to war," who was "anti-
Vietnam all the time."
When a spokesman for the Nat'onal Federa
tion for the Blind requested that the blind be
allowed to join the army to perform some ad
ministrative jobs, Sen. Russell said that his tes
timony ought to bring a "blush of shame" to
those who had protested the draft.
Other witnesses represented the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, American
Legion, United Church of Christ, and National
Guard Association. The Young Americans for
Freedom argued for voluntary service, in order

"There was no time to anticipate the change, and no
time to anticipate the danger."

that the youth might affirm their patriotism
without compulsion.
The university voice was significantly ab
sent from these hearings. And the cause was
not taken up. Marshall and Hershey explained
proposals for a lottery, but did not buck the
committee's evident hostility to ending under
graduate deferments.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.-Mass.) testified
that the Manpower Subcommittee, of which
he was acting chairman, favored induction of
19-year-olds first, lottery, and an end to grad
uate deferments.
On the crucial point of undergraduate de
ferments, Kennedy said he favored them in
peacetime, but not at war. The question be
came: "When is the country at war?" And the
Senator replied, under questioning, that Viet
nam should definitely be considered "war
time."
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R.-Ore.) proposed a vol
untary service. The suggestion, later to be hotly
debated and roundly defeated when he sub
mitted it as an amendment, completes the cata
logue of points of view. What was emotionally
felt in the Senate was to be liberalized and
sharpened in the House. In the process, Presi
dent Johnson, his Special Commission, and
graduate education were softly retired from
the debate.
Gen. Clark's proposal to maintain under
graduate deferments was written into the com
mittee's Report of May 4. A continuing supply
of college graduates was important to the na
tion, and this overrode arguments of che in

equity for those who could not afford to go to
college.
Unremarked was the importance to the na
tion of the graduate students who would have
to take their places in the army, or the impor
tance of a supply of teachers for these impor
tant undergraduates.
The Senate, with nays from Wayne Morse
(D.-Ore.) and Ernest Gruening (D.-Alaska),
passed S 1432 on May 11. Hatfield's amend
ment was that "Whenever . . . reassessment
reveals that a system of involuntary inductions
can be replaced by a system based on the free
choice of individuals at an over-all cost the na
tion can reasonably afford, Congress should
act to facilitate the prompt termination of mili

tary inductions. . . It was defeated, 9-69.
Tlie Bill did not include the President's pro
posal to reverse induction priorities from the
oldest first to the youngest first, in ages 19-26.
It was, however, approved in the Armed Ser
vices Committee Report. The Marshall Com
mission had argued that the old law creatcd a
long period of painful uncertainty for many
young men. To this, Sen. Russell made the in
credible argument that it was only true "if one
begins with the idea that avoidance of service
is an objective." As though the Ph.D. candi
dates and young men starting their own busi
nesses waited for the draft as a stimulating
change of pace!
The House, with legislation against draft
card burners recently to its credit, was even
less kindly disposed. The House Armed Ser
vices Committee reported out a bill which
tightened restrictions for conscientious objec
tors and urged the Justice Department to pro
ceed quickly in prosecuting draft law violators.
Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D.-La.), third
ranking Democrat on the Committee, took up
the subject of draft protest: "Let's forget about
the first amendment. I know that will be the
refuge of the Supreme Court, I recognize that.
But at least the effort can be made and the
demonstration given the American people cer
tainly that the Department of Justice and most
assuredly the Congress is determined to elimi
nate this rat-infested area in this country."
But he was fulminating about a side issue.
Crucial provisions of the bill reported out of
committee barred the President's way, by di-

rective, to institute a lottery or to abolish un
dergraduate deferments, unless those changes
were "in the national interest." If they were
abolished, potential doctors, lawyers, and
other specialists would fulfill their military ob
ligation before completing their professional
training. So the committee argued.
No one from the universities was present to
suggest that, doctors aside, this argument
could be used to oppose what was being done
to graduate study.
The House version was debated on the floor
on May 25. An amendment by Otis G. Pike
(D.-N.Y.) to eliminate undergraduate defer
ments was rejected 77-160. As in the Senate,
arguments in favor were based solely on eq
uity. The pinch which devolved upon graduate
study never came to light.
Objection was raised that debate had been
scheduled on the night following action on
the controversial elementary and secondary
education bill, which dragged on until 1:40
a.m. But the Congressmen soldiered on to final
passage of S 1432 just before midnight. The
vote was 362-9.
House and Senate versions were broadly dif
ferent. In the conference to resolve the two,
House members held tenaciously to their ver
sion. At a crucial time, Sen. Russell switched
sides and gained an absolute ban on lottery,
instead of the House's request for 60-day noti
fication. The final bill, cleared by Congress on
June 20, left the President only two areas in
which to maneuver.
• He could move through the National Se
curity Council to defer some areas of graduate
study as "in the national interest."
• He could declare a prime age group, in
structing local boards to order for induction a
certain "mix" of ages.
Only one major administration - sponsored
provision survived: the President was still free
to take 19-year-olds first.
Sen. Russell, presiding in the ruins of a bill
which bore little affinity to the one he had in
troduced, gave credit to a mute, but kindred
spirit:
"It is significant to me, in reading these com
munications here today, that we have not had
anything from General Hershey objecting to
this bill. He has not expressed any displeasure
with it."

Why did Congress arrive at this version of
the new draft law? One has the impression that
irritat on and urgency were important. The
Senate was especially pressed, with Sen. Thom
as Dodd (D.-Conn.) up for scrutiny in a few
days.
A view of higher education was also mani
fest. Attempts selectively to defer undergrad
uates had met with strenuous complaints.
Some universities refused to disclose class
ranking. Others conducted "draft tests" to the
accompaniment of demonstrations and sit-ins.
The temptation to a washing of hands, with
respect to undergraduates, was powerful.
Secondly, the Eighty-ninth Congress had
been very generous to universities, in grant,
loan and gift. Draft-test protest, Vietnam pro
test, and general hostility seemed, at least, un
grateful.
Having forsaken the undergraduates, the
Congress needed men from somewhere. Lack
ing a sense of what graduate schools did, per
haps suspecting them, Congress took the ob
vious step.

Senate Bill 1432 and the Executive Order
putting it into effect were signed by President
Johnson on June 30, 1967. The next day, Burke
Marshall was quoted by The New York Times
as saying, "In my judgment, the new bill makes
the system worse than it was before."
The Executive Order set the demise of most
graduate deferments for next year. Universities
were about to get onto the scent.
According to provisions which remained in
effect with the new law, the oldest in the man
power pool were to be taken first. But anyone
who had had a student deferment at any time
went into the "most vulnerable" category.
The result would be to wipe out some areas
of graduate study and to debilitate others, un
less' the President made some change with a
new Executive Order. It is understandable that
the universities did not realize this at once. It
appears not to have dawned on the lawmakers
themselves.
But opposition began to be vocalized. John
F. Morse of the American Council on Educa
tion circulated memoranda. And the graduate
deans started alerting people to the danger.
On August 8, the Council of Graduate
Schools held an emergency meeting of its Se
lective Service Committee. Two statements
later emerged with the support of the CGE
Executive Committee and the Association of
Graduate Schools.
One statement began, "The Military Selec
tive Service Act of 1967 and the President's Ex
ecutive Order 11360, ending deferments of
graduate students except those in health sci
ences and those in certain other, not yet desig
nated disciplines, will have immediate serious
consequences for all graduate education and
will produce an inevitable deterioration of all

deans started alerting people to the danger.
On August 8, the Council of Graduate
Schools held an emergency meeting of its Se
lective Service Committee. Two statements
later emerged with the support of the CGE
Executive Committee and the Association of
Graduate Schools.
One statement began, "The Military Selec
tive Service Act of 1967 and the President's Ex
ecutive Order 11360, ending deferments of
graduate students except those in health sci
ences and those in certain other, not yet desig
nated disciplines, will have immediate serious
consequences for all graduate education and
will produce an inevitable deterioration of all
higher education for an unpredictable number
of years."
The first task was to stop the President from
designating additional areas of exemption.

These, the Council said, would inevitably "im
pede the strength and warp the free intellec
tual development of the United States." While
the President is still free to do this, the cam
paign appears to have succeeded.
Other recommendations were similar to the
Marshall Commission: selection at an early
age; advance notice (perhaps a year); and free
dom to complete a degree program in prog
ress. The Commission had urged an end to all
student deferments. But with Congress cutting
off the supply of undergraduates for the army,
the CGS request for reconsideration of gradu
ate deferments was reasonable.

Will the draft law be changed again before it
has run its four-year course?
Walter Findeisen, National Service Officer
at Stanford, doubts it. The Army prefers 19-
year-olds. And Findeisen believes that draft
boards will show just enough favoritisn. to
graduate students to prevent Congress from re
opening the unpleasant debate.
He further doubts that the President will
designate a prime age, since to do so would be
to incur "the wrath of every local PTA mem
ber in the United States."
Meanwhile, the local boards, which the Mar
shall Commission wanted to replace with na
tional standards, will continue to do what Fin
deisen called their "agonizing, thankless, God
forsaken job."
And Cen. Lewis B. Hershey will join with
the Congress in avoiding discussion of substan
tive goals and consequences: "I'm as popular
as a bastard at a family reunion with the mili
tary because they don't want to run a correc
tional institution. But they have the know-how
to teach discipline. It's not a matter of author
ity for the sake of authority. Authority is just a
method of getting things done without being
reduced to chaos. . . . The question is, what
are you running? A force to garrison the world,
or a training school for citizens? 1 guess I
straddle that one."


Dean Whitaker warns that the new draft law
will cause "serious disruption of ad
vanced training."
Congress called the tune for a new draft
law last summer. Only by autumn did
somnolent universities realize that the
legislators were asking them to pay the piper.
The new law looks like siphoning off all eli
gible graduate students, leaving, in Nathan
Pusey's phrase, "the lame, the halt, the blind,
the female." Add "the foreign" and the Presi
dent of Harvard was not exaggerating.
Many people in Washington speculated that
the President would modify the law by Presi
dential directive this week. But at press time,
no one had heard a peep ; much less an Execu
tive Order.
Even with a Presidential directive, graduate
schools would be in trouble. Not that total en
rollment would plunge. The President can
still invalidate dire and reasonable warnings
that the number of graduate students might
be cut in half.
But for certain areas, curtailment and even
crippling are seriously discussed. Engineering,
with a high proportion of foreign students,
cannot assimilate them if their vulnerable do
mestic fellows must go to serve. A heavy call
would deny them the chance to get an "Ameri
can" education.
Departments which rely on teaching assist
ants to conduct classes and on lab assistants to
conduct research must hope for new men, new
methods, or more than their share of good
luck to carry on daily business. Laboratories
will be hit first. Because many TA's are third
and fourth-year men, the problem will lie hid
den for a couple of years, at which time short
ages are on the cards.
Finally, professional schools —law and busi
ness—stand to receive a body blow from the
new legislation. Unprotected by foreign and
female, looking altogether like healthy Ameri
cans, their students are going to dwindle. Even
under the best conditions, they could be
halved.
It is this list of expected consequences which
prompted Virgil K. Whitaker, Dean of the
Graduate Division, to warn: "The immediate
plight of the universities will be severe. But
what really matters in the long run is the seri
ous disruption of advanced training upon
which the United States must rely to maintain
intellectual leadership in world affairs and
technological and industrial progress at home."
How did this law, Senate Bill 1432, June 30,
1967, go through without a clamor from the
higher learning?
The full answer comes with a look at delib
erations in a frustrated Ninetieth Congress.
But three factors put universities off their
guard from the start.
No major revision of the Selective Service
Act had been made since 1951. Congress was
reluctant to address the statute at all, and hur
ried its alteration through. President Johnson
signed the bill hours before the old one was to
expire. There was no time to anticipate the
change, and no sign to anticipate the danger.
Second, a very able Presidential Advisory
Commission on Selective Service made its re
port in February, 1967. Chairman was former
Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall,
and its members included President Kingman
Brewster of Yale, John A. McCone, and John
Courtney Murray.
The Commission's recommendations were
thoughtful and reasonable. If they were not
especially daring, they contained nothing to
disrupt or distort the universities. And the
President, with Sen. Richard Russell (D.-Ga.)
floor managing, seemed a good bet to get them
written into law.
Finally, the draft is a circus of many rings.
Those who opposed it unconditionally, some
suggesting a voluntary service alternative, took
themselves out of the political process. To
most Congressmen, voluntary service is not
only pie-in-t he-sky, but it casts doubt on the
good intentions and patriotism of American
men who answer the draft call and serve.
Other rings, such as conscientious objection,

classification of protestors, and the legitimacy
of the draft in our present "peacetime," let out
emotion, and served to obscure the salient con
sequences of the new law. Kingman Brewster
was moved to action by Gen. Lewis B. Fer
shey's dictum on protestors Oct. 26, but not by
the repudiation in Congress of his Commis
sion's valuable recommendations.
• • •
On April 5, 1967, Sen. Russell introduced
the administration bill. A week later, hearings
were opened in the Senate Armed Services
Committee. The tone was set by Gen. Mark W.
Clark (USA-ret.), who inveighed against pro
test, draft-card burners, and Supreme Court
expansion of the criteria for conscientious ob
jection.
Gen. Clark said that he opposed the exemp
tion for someone who "can't prove belief in a
Supreme Being rather than in a tobacco plant
or "something." He confessed exasperation at
"a breed of cat running around" who did not
"want to fight... to go to war," who was "anti-
Vietnam all the time."
When a spokesman for the Nat'onal Federa
tion for the Blind requested that the blind be
allowed to join the army to perform some ad
ministrative jobs, Sen. Russell said that his tes
timony ought to bring a "blush of shame" to
those who had protested the draft.
Other witnesses represented the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, American
Legion, United Church of Christ, and National
Guard Association. The Young Americans for
Freedom argued for voluntary service, in order

"There was no time to anticipate the change, and no
time to anticipate the danger."

that the youth might affirm their patriotism
without compulsion.
The university voice was significantly ab
sent from these hearings. And the cause was
not taken up. Marshall and Hershey explained
proposals for a lottery, but did not buck the
committee's evident hostility to ending under
graduate deferments.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.-Mass.) testified
that the Manpower Subcommittee, of which
he was acting chairman, favored induction of
19-year-olds first, lottery, and an end to grad
uate deferments.
On the crucial point of undergraduate de
ferments, Kennedy said he favored them in
peacetime, but not at war. The question be
came: "When is the country at war?" And the
Senator replied, under questioning, that Viet
nam should definitely be considered "war
time."
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R.-Ore.) proposed a vol
untary service. The suggestion, later to be hotly
debated and roundly defeated when he sub
mitted it as an amendment, completes the cata
logue of points of view. What was emotionally
felt in the Senate was to be liberalized and
sharpened in the House. In the process, Presi
dent Johnson, his Special Commission, and
graduate education were softly retired from
the debate.
Gen. Clark's proposal to maintain under
graduate deferments was written into the com
mittee's Report of May 4. A continuing supply
of college graduates was important to the na
tion, and this overrode arguments of che in

equity for those who could not afford to go to
college.
Unremarked was the importance to the na
tion of the graduate students who would have
to take their places in the army, or the impor
tance of a supply of teachers for these impor
tant undergraduates.
The Senate, with nays from Wayne Morse
(D.-Ore.) and Ernest Gruening (D.-Alaska),
passed S 1432 on May 11. Hatfield's amend
ment was that "Whenever . . . reassessment
reveals that a system of involuntary inductions
can be replaced by a system based on the free
choice of individuals at an over-all cost the na
tion can reasonably afford, Congress should
act to facilitate the prompt termination of mili

tary inductions. . . It was defeated, 9-69.
Tlie Bill did not include the President's pro
posal to reverse induction priorities from the
oldest first to the youngest first, in ages 19-26.
It was, however, approved in the Armed Ser
vices Committee Report. The Marshall Com
mission had argued that the old law creatcd a
long period of painful uncertainty for many
young men. To this, Sen. Russell made the in
credible argument that it was only true "if one
begins with the idea that avoidance of service
is an objective." As though the Ph.D. candi
dates and young men starting their own busi
nesses waited for the draft as a stimulating
change of pace!
The House, with legislation against draft
card burners recently to its credit, was even
less kindly disposed. The House Armed Ser
vices Committee reported out a bill which
tightened restrictions for conscientious objec
tors and urged the Justice Department to pro
ceed quickly in prosecuting draft law violators.
Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D.-La.), third
ranking Democrat on the Committee, took up
the subject of draft protest: "Let's forget about
the first amendment. I know that will be the
refuge of the Supreme Court, I recognize that.
But at least the effort can be made and the
demonstration given the American people cer
tainly that the Department of Justice and most
assuredly the Congress is determined to elimi
nate this rat-infested area in this country."
But he was fulminating about a side issue.
Crucial provisions of the bill reported out of
committee barred the President's way, by di-

rective, to institute a lottery or to abolish un
dergraduate deferments, unless those changes
were "in the national interest." If they were
abolished, potential doctors, lawyers, and
other specialists would fulfill their military ob
ligation before completing their professional
training. So the committee argued.
No one from the universities was present to
suggest that, doctors aside, this argument
could be used to oppose what was being done
to graduate study.
The House version was debated on the floor
on May 25. An amendment by Otis G. Pike
(D.-N.Y.) to eliminate undergraduate defer
ments was rejected 77-160. As in the Senate,
arguments in favor were based solely on eq
uity. The pinch which devolved upon graduate
study never came to light.
Objection was raised that debate had been
scheduled on the night following action on
the controversial elementary and secondary
education bill, which dragged on until 1:40
a.m. But the Congressmen soldiered on to final
passage of S 1432 just before midnight. The
vote was 362-9.
House and Senate versions were broadly dif
ferent. In the conference to resolve the two,
House members held tenaciously to their ver
sion. At a crucial time, Sen. Russell switched
sides and gained an absolute ban on lottery,
instead of the House's request for 60-day noti
fication. The final bill, cleared by Congress on
June 20, left the President only two areas in
which to maneuver.
• He could move through the National Se
curity Council to defer some areas of graduate
study as "in the national interest."
• He could declare a prime age group, in
structing local boards to order for induction a
certain "mix" of ages.
Only one major administration - sponsored
provision survived: the President was still free
to take 19-year-olds first.
Sen. Russell, presiding in the ruins of a bill
which bore little affinity to the one he had in
troduced, gave credit to a mute, but kindred
spirit:
"It is significant to me, in reading these com
munications here today, that we have not had
anything from General Hershey objecting to
this bill. He has not expressed any displeasure
with it."

Why did Congress arrive at this version of
the new draft law? One has the impression that
irritat on and urgency were important. The
Senate was especially pressed, with Sen. Thom
as Dodd (D.-Conn.) up for scrutiny in a few
days.
A view of higher education was also mani
fest. Attempts selectively to defer undergrad
uates had met with strenuous complaints.
Some universities refused to disclose class
ranking. Others conducted "draft tests" to the
accompaniment of demonstrations and sit-ins.
The temptation to a washing of hands, with
respect to undergraduates, was powerful.
Secondly, the Eighty-ninth Congress had
been very generous to universities, in grant,
loan and gift. Draft-test protest, Vietnam pro
test, and general hostility seemed, at least, un
grateful.
Having forsaken the undergraduates, the
Congress needed men from somewhere. Lack
ing a sense of what graduate schools did, per
haps suspecting them, Congress took the ob
vious step.

Senate Bill 1432 and the Executive Order
putting it into effect were signed by President
Johnson on June 30, 1967. The next day, Burke
Marshall was quoted by The New York Times
as saying, "In my judgment, the new bill makes
the system worse than it was before."
The Executive Order set the demise of most
graduate deferments for next year. Universities
were about to get onto the scent.
According to provisions which remained in
effect with the new law, the oldest in the man
power pool were to be taken first. But anyone
who had had a student deferment at any time
went into the "most vulnerable" category.
The result would be to wipe out some areas
of graduate study and to debilitate others, un
less' the President made some change with a
new Executive Order. It is understandable that
the universities did not realize this at once. It
appears not to have dawned on the lawmakers
themselves.
But opposition began to be vocalized. John
F. Morse of the American Council on Educa
tion circulated memoranda. And the graduate

went into the "most vulnerable" category.
The result would be to wipe out some areas
of graduate study and to debilitate others, un
less' the President made some change with a
new Executive Order. It is understandable that
the universities did not realize this at once. It
appears not to have dawned on the lawmakers
themselves.
But opposition began to be vocalized. John
F. Morse of the American Council on Educa
tion circulated memoranda. And the graduate
deans started alerting people to the danger.
On August 8, the Council of Graduate
Schools held an emergency meeting of its Se
lective Service Committee. Two statements
later emerged with the support of the CGE
Executive Committee and the Association of
Graduate Schools.
One statement began, "The Military Selec
tive Service Act of 1967 and the President's Ex
ecutive Order 11360, ending deferments of
graduate students except those in health sci
ences and those in certain other, not yet desig
nated disciplines, will have immediate serious
consequences for all graduate education and
will produce an inevitable deterioration of all
higher education for an unpredictable number
of years."
The first task was to stop the President from
designating additional areas of exemption.

These, the Council said, would inevitably "im
pede the strength and warp the free intellec
tual development of the United States." While
the President is still free to do this, the cam
paign appears to have succeeded.
Other recommendations were similar to the
Marshall Commission: selection at an early
age; advance notice (perhaps a year); and free
dom to complete a degree program in prog
ress. The Commission had urged an end to all
student deferments. But with Congress cutting
off the supply of undergraduates for the army,
the CGS request for reconsideration of gradu
ate deferments was reasonable.

Will the draft law be changed again before it
has run its four-year course?
Walter Findeisen, National Service Officer
at Stanford, doubts it. The Army prefers 19-
year-olds. And Findeisen believes that draft
boards will show just enough favoritisn. to
graduate students to prevent Congress from re
opening the unpleasant debate.
He further doubts that the President will
designate a prime age, since to do so would be
to incur "the wrath of every local PTA mem
ber in the United States."
Meanwhile, the local boards, which the Mar
shall Commission wanted to replace with na
tional standards, will continue to do what Fin
deisen called their "agonizing, thankless, God
forsaken job."
And Cen. Lewis B. Hershey will join with
the Congress in avoiding discussion of substan
tive goals and consequences: "I'm as popular
as a bastard at a family reunion with the mili
tary because they don't want to run a correc
tional institution. But they have the know-how
to teach discipline. It's not a matter of author
ity for the sake of authority. Authority is just a
method of getting things done without being
reduced to chaos. . . . The question is, what
are you running? A force to garrison the world,
or a training school for citizens? 1 guess I
straddle that one."


Dean Whitaker warns that the new draft law
will cause "serious disruption of ad
vanced training."
Congress called the tune for a new draft
law last summer. Only by autumn did
somnolent universities realize that the
legislators were asking them to pay the piper.
The new law looks like siphoning off all eli
gible graduate students, leaving, in Nathan
Pusey's phrase, "the lame, the halt, the blind,
the female." Add "the foreign" and the Presi
dent of Harvard was not exaggerating.
Many people in Washington speculated that
the President would modify the law by Presi
dential directive this week. But at press time,
no one had heard a peep ; much less an Execu
tive Order.
Even with a Presidential directive, graduate
schools would be in trouble. Not that total en
rollment would plunge. The President can
still invalidate dire and reasonable warnings
that the number of graduate students might
be cut in half.
But for certain areas, curtailment and even
crippling are seriously discussed. Engineering,
with a high proportion of foreign students,
cannot assimilate them if their vulnerable do
mestic fellows must go to serve. A heavy call
would deny them the chance to get an "Ameri
can" education.
Departments which rely on teaching assist
ants to conduct classes and on lab assistants to
conduct research must hope for new men, new
methods, or more than their share of good
luck to carry on daily business. Laboratories
will be hit first. Because many TA's are third
and fourth-year men, the problem will lie hid
den for a couple of years, at which time short
ages are on the cards.
Finally, professional schools —law and busi
ness—stand to receive a body blow from the
new legislation. Unprotected by foreign and
female, looking altogether like healthy Ameri
cans, their students are going to dwindle. Even
under the best conditions, they could be
halved.
It is this list of expected consequences which
prompted Virgil K. Whitaker, Dean of the
Graduate Division, to warn: "The immediate
plight of the universities will be severe. But
what really matters in the long run is the seri
ous disruption of advanced training upon
which the United States must rely to maintain
intellectual leadership in world affairs and
technological and industrial progress at home."
How did this law, Senate Bill 1432, June 30,
1967, go through without a clamor from the
higher learning?
The full answer comes with a look at delib
erations in a frustrated Ninetieth Congress.
But three factors put universities off their
guard from the start.
No major revision of the Selective Service
Act had been made since 1951. Congress was
reluctant to address the statute at all, and hur
ried its alteration through. President Johnson
signed the bill hours before the old one was to
expire. There was no time to anticipate the
change, and no sign to anticipate the danger.
Second, a very able Presidential Advisory
Commission on Selective Service made its re
port in February, 1967. Chairman was former
Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall,
and its members included President Kingman
Brewster of Yale, John A. McCone, and John
Courtney Murray.
The Commission's recommendations were
thoughtful and reasonable. If they were not
especially daring, they contained nothing to
disrupt or distort the universities. And the
President, with Sen. Richard Russell (D.-Ga.)
floor managing, seemed a good bet to get them
written into law.
Finally, the draft is a circus of many rings.
Those who opposed it unconditionally, some
suggesting a voluntary service alternative, took
themselves out of the political process. To
most Congressmen, voluntary service is not
only pie-in-t he-sky, but it casts doubt on the
good intentions and patriotism of American
men who answer the draft call and serve.
Other rings, such as conscientious objection,

classification of protestors, and the legitimacy
of the draft in our present "peacetime," let out
emotion, and served to obscure the salient con
sequences of the new law. Kingman Brewster
was moved to action by Gen. Lewis B. Fer
shey's dictum on protestors Oct. 26, but not by
the repudiation in Congress of his Commis
sion's valuable recommendations.

On April 5, 1967, Sen. Russell introduced
the administration bill. A week later, hearings
were opened in the Senate Armed Services
Committee. The tone was set by Gen. Mark W.
Clark (USA-ret.), who inveighed against pro
test, draft-card burners, and Supreme Court
expansion of the criteria for conscientious ob
jection.
Gen. Clark said that he opposed the exemp
tion for someone who "can't prove belief in a
Supreme Being rather than in a tobacco plant
or "something." He confessed exasperation at
"a breed of cat running around" who did not
"want to fight... to go to war," who was "anti-
Vietnam all the time."
When a spokesman for the Nat'onal Federa
tion for the Blind requested that the blind be
allowed to join the army to perform some ad
ministrative jobs, Sen. Russell said that his tes
timony ought to bring a "blush of shame" to
those who had protested the draft.
Other witnesses represented the Chamber
of Commerce of the United States, American
Legion, United Church of Christ, and National
Guard Association. The Young Americans for
Freedom argued for voluntary service, in order

"There was no time to anticipate the change, and no
time to anticipate the danger."

that the youth might affirm their patriotism
without compulsion.
The university voice was significantly ab
sent from these hearings. And the cause was
not taken up. Marshall and Hershey explained
proposals for a lottery, but did not buck the
committee's evident hostility to ending under
graduate deferments.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.-Mass.) testified
that the Manpower Subcommittee, of which
he was acting chairman, favored induction of
19-year-olds first, lottery, and an end to grad
uate deferments.
On the crucial point of undergraduate de
ferments, Kennedy said he favored them in
peacetime, but not at war. The question be
came: "When is the country at war?" And the
Senator replied, under questioning, that Viet
nam should definitely be considered "war
time."
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R.-Ore.) proposed a vol
untary service. The suggestion, later to be hotly
debated and roundly defeated when he sub
mitted it as an amendment, completes the cata
logue of points of view. What was emotionally
felt in the Senate was to be liberalized and
sharpened in the House. In the process, Presi
dent Johnson, his Special Commission, and
graduate education were softly retired from
the debate.
Gen. Clark's proposal to maintain under
graduate deferments was written into the com
mittee's Report of May 4. A continuing supply
of college graduates was important to the na
tion, and this overrode arguments of che in

equity for those who could not afford to go to
college.
Unremarked was the importance to the na
tion of the graduate students who would have
to take their places in the army, or the impor
tance of a supply of teachers for these impor
tant undergraduates.
The Senate, with nays from Wayne Morse
(D.-Ore.) and Ernest Gruening (D.-Alaska),
passed S 1432 on May 11. Hatfield's amend
ment was that "Whenever . . . reassessment
reveals that a system of involuntary inductions
can be replaced by a system based on the free
choice of individuals at an over-all cost the na
tion can reasonably afford, Congress should
act to facilitate the prompt termination of mili

tary inductions. . . It was defeated, 9-69.
Tlie Bill did not include the President's pro
posal to reverse induction priorities from the
oldest first to the youngest first, in ages 19-26.
It was, however, approved in the Armed Ser
vices Committee Report. The Marshall Com
mission had argued that the old law creatcd a
long period of painful uncertainty for many
young men. To this, Sen. Russell made the in
credible argument that it was only true "if one
begins with the idea that avoidance of service
is an objective." As though the Ph.D. candi
dates and young men starting their own busi
nesses waited for the draft as a stimulating
change of pace!
The House, with legislation against draft
card burners recently to its credit, was even
less kindly disposed. The House Armed Ser
vices Committee reported out a bill which
tightened restrictions for conscientious objec
tors and urged the Justice Department to pro
ceed quickly in prosecuting draft law violators.
Rep. F. Edward Hebert (D.-La.), third
ranking Democrat on the Committee, took up
the subject of draft protest: "Let's forget about
the first amendment. I know that will be the
refuge of the Supreme Court, I recognize that.
But at least the effort can be made and the
demonstration given the American people cer
tainly that the Department of Justice and most
assuredly the Congress is determined to elimi
nate this rat-infested area in this country."
But he was fulminating about a side issue.
Crucial provisions of the bill reported out of
committee barred the President's way, by di-

rective, to institute a lottery or to abolish un
dergraduate deferments, unless those changes
were "in the national interest." If they were
abolished, potential doctors, lawyers, and
other specialists would fulfill their military ob
ligation before completing their professional
training. So the committee argued.
No one from the universities was present to
suggest that, doctors aside, this argument
could be used to oppose what was being done
to graduate study.
The House version was debated on the floor
on May 25. An amendment by Otis G. Pike
(D.-N.Y.) to eliminate undergraduate defer
ments was rejected 77-160. As in the Senate,
arguments in favor were based solely on eq
uity. The pinch which devolved upon graduate
study never came to light.
Objection was raised that debate had been
scheduled on the night following action on
the controversial elementary and secondary
education bill, which dragged on until 1:40
a.m. But the Congressmen soldiered on to final
passage of S 1432 just before midnight. The
vote was 362-9.
House and Senate versions were broadly dif
ferent. In the conference to resolve the two,
House members held tenaciously to their ver
sion. At a crucial time, Sen. Russell switched
sides and gained an absolute ban on lottery,
instead of the House's request for 60-day noti
fication. The final bill, cleared by Congress on
June 20, left the President only two areas in
which to maneuver.
• He could move through the National Se
curity Council to defer some areas of graduate
study as "in the national interest."
• He could declare a prime age group, in
structing local boards to order for induction a
certain "mix" of ages.
Only one major administration - sponsored
provision survived: the President was still free
to take 19-year-olds first.
Sen. Russell, presiding in the ruins of a bill
which bore little affinity to the one he had in
troduced, gave credit to a mute, but kindred
spirit:
"It is significant to me, in reading these com
munications here today, that we have not had
anything from General Hershey objecting to
this bill. He has not expressed any displeasure
with it."

Why did Congress arrive at this version of
the new draft law? One has the impression that
irritat on and urgency were important. The
Senate was especially pressed, with Sen. Thom
as Dodd (D.-Conn.) up for scrutiny in a few
days.
A view of higher education was also mani
fest. Attempts selectively to defer undergrad
uates had met with strenuous complaints.
Some universities refused to disclose class
ranking. Others conducted "draft tests" to the
accompaniment of demonstrations and sit-ins.
The temptation to a washing of hands, with
respect to undergraduates, was powerful.
Secondly, the Eighty-ninth Congress had
been very generous to universities, in grant,
loan and gift. Draft-test protest, Vietnam pro
test, and general hostility seemed, at least, un
grateful.
Having forsaken the undergraduates, the
Congress needed men from somewhere. Lack
ing a sense of what graduate schools did, per
haps suspecting them, Congress took the ob
vious step.
Four years of college has become enshrined
as an American value. Rut for most Americans,

Senate Bill 1432 and the Executive Order
putting it into effect were signed by President
Johnson on June 30, 1967. The next day, Burke
Marshall was quoted by The New York Times
as saying, "In my judgment, the new bill makes
the system worse than it was before."
The Executive Order set the demise of most
graduate deferments for next year. Universities
were about to get onto the scent.
According to provisions which remained in
effect with the new law, the oldest in the man
power pool were to be taken first. But anyone
who had had a student deferment at any time
went into the "most vulnerable" category.
