# Congress to colleges: evolution of the law

### michael couzens 
Congress called the tune for a new draft
law last summer. Only by autumn did
somnolent universities realize that the
legislators were asking them to pay the piper.
The new law looks like siphoning off all eli
gible graduate students, leaving, in Nathan
Pusey's phrase, "the lame, the halt, the blind,
the female." Add "the foreign" and the Presi
dent of Harvard was not exaggerating.
Many people in Washington speculated that
the President would modify the law by Presi
dential directive this week. But at press time,
no one had heard a peep ; much less an Execu
tive Order.
Even with a Presidential directive, graduate
schools would be in trouble. Not that total en
rollment would plunge. The President can
still invalidate dire and reasonable warnings
that the number of graduate students might
be cut in half.
But for certain areas, curtailment and even
crippling are seriously discussed. Engineering,
with a high proportion of foreign students,
cannot assimilate them if their vulnerable do
mestic fellows must go to serve. A heavy call
would deny them the chance to get an "Ameri
can" education.
Departments which rely on teaching assist
ants to conduct classes and on lab assistants to
conduct research must hope for new men, new
methods, or more than their share of good
luck to carry on daily business. Laboratories
will be hit first. Because many TA's are third
and fourth-year men, the problem will lie hid
den for a couple of years, at which time short
ages are on the cards.
Finally, professional schools —law and busi
ness—stand to receive a body blow from the
new legislation. Unprotected by foreign and
female, looking altogether like healthy Ameri
cans, their students are going to dwindle. Even
