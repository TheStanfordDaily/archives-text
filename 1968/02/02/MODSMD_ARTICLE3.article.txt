# Within the system: legal alternatives

Graduating seniors:
If you have torn up your draft card, or if you
intend to, read no farther. But if you don't
want to go to Vietnam and, on the other hand,
you don't want to go to jail or Canada, the fol
lowing information might interest you.
What is in store for the able-bodied young
man when he steps off the platform at com
mencement time?
The first problem one encounters trying to
answer this question is that the federal guide
lines for granting draft deferments are so gen
eral that local draft boards have almost com
plete discretion to decide who should get one
and who shouldn't.
Stanford's National Service Adviser Walter
Findeisen explains, "We don't know any more
today than we did when the (draft) act was
passed and became effective last July."
But he did feel it safe to say, "In the absence
of clarification or changes, I don't think we'll
be seeing many graduate deferments after
June."
This does not mean that every June gradu
ate is going to be drafted. By virtually elimi
nating deferments for new graduate students,
the draft law increases the pool of available
draftees to huge proportions. Findeisen points
out, "They're not going to be able to draft all
the people who graduate in June or are in
graduate schools today."
While this statement of fact may be small
comfort to someone who faces being drafted,
no matter how small the odds, even smaller
comfort may be found in the facts regarding
alternatives to the draft.
The only people who are completely safe
(besides undergraduates making "normal
progress") are men in the so-called critical
professions, those areas which suffer shortages
