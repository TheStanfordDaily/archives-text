# Within the system: legal alternatives
## 
### Christopher hargrove 
Graduating seniors:
If you have torn up your draft card, or if you
intend to, read no farther. But if you don't
want to go to Vietnam and, on the other hand,
you don't want to go to jail or Canada, the fol
lowing information might interest you.
What is in store for the able-bodied young
man when he steps off the platform at com
mencement time?
The first problem one encounters trying to
answer this question is that the federal guide
lines for granting draft deferments are so gen
eral that local draft boards have almost com
plete discretion to decide who should get one
and who shouldn't.
Stanford's National Service Adviser Walter
Findeisen explains, "We don't know any more
today than we did when the (draft) act was
passed and became effective last July."
But he did feel it safe to say, "In the absence
of clarification or changes, I don't think we'll
be seeing many graduate deferments after
June."
This does not mean that every June gradu
ate is going to be drafted. By virtually elimi
nating deferments for new graduate students,
the draft law increases the pool of available
draftees to huge proportions. Findeisen points
out, "They're not going to be able to draft all
the people who graduate in June or are in
graduate schools today."
While this statement of fact may be small
comfort to someone who faces being drafted,
no matter how small the odds, even smaller
comfort may be found in the facts regarding
alternatives to the draft.
The only people who are completely safe
(besides undergraduates making "normal
progress") are men in the so-called critical
professions, those areas which suffer shortages
of trained personnel and are in the "national
interest" for Selective Service to support.
The well-known examples are college teach
ers, scientists, engineers, doctors; but also in
cluded are such professions as jig and template
making, die setting and glassblowing.
We should quickly add it is not enough to
be merely qualified in one of these professions.
One must actually be employed as a teacher,
glassblower or what-have-you to be eligible
for a more or less automatic draft deferment.
We should also add here that government
work is not per se considered in the interests
of tlie national health, safety or welfare. A per
son working for a government agency may, of
course, be lucky enough to get a deferment
from his local board, but he is not by any means
s;ife from the draft, as is the glassblower.
Moreover, Findeisen emphasizes, "An agency
won't support a request for a deferment." In
other words, you're on your own when you ask
for one.
For a student who still wants to avoid the
Army at all costs, at least temporarily, there
are the volunteer organizations. The Peace
Corps and the International Voluntary Ser
vices have in the past been grounds for almost
automatic draft deferment, lint they may soon
be losing their havens-from-draft status.
A recent issue of the Peace Corps magazine
quoted Peace Corps Director Jack Vaughn as
saying, "The problem of induction notices to
overseas volunteers is becoming a major con
cern to us." Volunteers have always been eli
gible for the 11-A deferment, but many of them
go into the Corps without first getting this de
ferment. Then, when they get overseas, they
occasionally find their local draft boards have
rejected their requests for the 11-A. It is not,
that is, a question of volunteers losing their de
ferments, but rather of not getting the defer
ments in the first place.
The latest records on this matter are about
six months old, but they indicate a trend to
ward drafting volunteers that was increasing
even then. At that time, some 60 volunteers
bad had their appeals for deferment turned
down by the three-man national board which
hears all such appeals at the federal level. The
figure 60 included five years of the Peace
Corps' history, but Vaughn pointed out that
almost all of them had occurred in the last year.
The figure represented about one-half of one
per cent of the total Peace Corps enrollment
at the time, which amounted to almost 12,000.
The story is the same for International Vol
untary Services (IVS), which currently has
volunteers working in Vietnam and Laos. Very
few of them are drafted while serving, but
the number is sufficient to unnerve all the
other draft-eligible volunteers. About a fourth
of the IVS volunteers are classified conscien
tious objectors, and their service in IVS satis
fies Selective Service's requirements for alter
native service.
The other three-quarters, of course, have to
get by with 11-A's, and when they and the
Peace Corps volunteers get back after two
years, they can still be drafted—and many of
them are.
There is no national policy on deferments
for volunteers, whether in the Peace Corps,
IVS or Vista. Selective Service Director Lewis
Hershey has publicly stated he thinks they

should be deferred because their work is in
the national interest. Local boards, however,
can and often do depart from Hershey's public
recommendations. Here, as in so many cases,
the vague federal guidelines let the boards do
pretty much what they want.
The result (if we may digress a little fur
ther) is that no one can predict one board's
policies by looking at those of another. Some
boards have more draftable young men than
they know what to do with; but others do not
have enough and must draft people another
board might automatically defer. Sometimes
this variance can be noted from state to state.
But, as Findeisen and many others have
pointed out, it is impossible to generalize.
More to the point, what other possibilities
are open to young men in the class of '68? For
those who don't mind going into the Armed
Forces but just want to stay away from Viet
nam, the possibilities are numerous.
The three Reserve Officer Training Corps
have programs that allow any student with
two years left in school to take ROTC for those
two years and try for a deferment for the rest
of his graduate years. In other words, if you
don't mind being a lieutenant and if you think
the war might be over in five years or so, this
is a program worth looking into.
The two-year program is not limited to grad
uate students, and the deferment after two
years of ROTC is by no means automatic.
While the Air Force is liberal in giving "aca
demic delays" for graduate students, for ex
ample, the Navy is not, and a student planning
on three or more years of graduate study prob
ably would not get into the Navy program.
The active duty commitment varies for
ROTC officers from service to service. In the
Army, the minimum is two years; in the Navy
three years; and in the Air Force it's four years
for non-flyers and five years for flyers after
their flight training.
The only one of these programs still accept
ing applications for next year is the Navy. The
Air Force ROTC two-year program closed out
Wednesday with three times as many appli
cations as it had spaces to fill. The Army has
also stopped taking applications for next year.
There are other alternatives for a student
who wants to beat the system by joining it. Any
recruiting sergeant can guarantee an initial as
signment in Europe, for example. The Army
system is quite simple, and the only additional
price one pays is an extra year in the service.
The Army will guarantee either choice of train
ing or choice of first assignment. If it tries to
go back on the contract, the enlistee can raise
a stink with his congressman and almost al
ways get what he signed up for, or else get out
of the Army. (But then he may be drafted.)
The situation with the reserves is not so
certain. The reserve program, as it now exists,
provides that someone who joins a reserve unit
spends six months on active duty for training.
Then he is in the stand-by reserves for the rest
of his six-year obligation, and if he is lucky, his
unit is never called up and he spends those five
and one-half years going to weekly or monthly
meetings.
The program is perfect for someone who
doesn't want to fight the draft, but doesn't want
to spend two years in the army with maybe a
year in Vietnam.
That is one reason why reserve units are so

hard to get into these days. The National
Guard, for example, now has 17,000 more peo
ple in it than its allotted 400,000. Moreover,
the only men allowed to join the Guard are
prior servicemen. So the National Guard is out
of the picture for the class of '68, except per
haps if your father is the governor.
The Army, Navy and Air Force Reserves
are less predictable, though here again, the
chances for joining one of them cold are infini
tesimal. In the first place, the reserves were
recently ordered to fill all future vacancies with
18J2-year-olds. This doesn't mean that all new
members will be IBJ2 years old, but that the
youngest people will be given preference
wherever possible. Many units, of course, need
specialists in one field or another and have to
take those they can find, no matter how old.
These specialists usually have prior service,
or else are lucky enough to be skilled in some
thing a reserve unit needs at a particular mo
ment.
And here we get into the question of luck,
because even though nearly all reserve units
are full right now, they all have people drop
ping out from time to time when their six years
are up. The waiting lists to join, though fright
fully long, are sometimes overlooked. That is,
if you are an expert computer operator or win
dow washer, and if you happen to walk into a
reserve unit which has just lost its old expert
computer operator or window washer, and if
this reserve unit has no expert computer oper
ators or window washers already on its wait
ing list, they might accept you immediately.
There are no rules that say they can't.
Such things do happen from time to time,
and their occurrence gives rise to many fond
stories of a few very lucky men. But for the
average liberal arts college graduate, the odds
are high against such a thing happening.
A spokesman for a local Army reserve train
ing center, for example, said the reserves here
haven't taken any new enlistments in at least
two years. Part of this, he said, was because
there are too many people in the "control
group' category (i.e., those who have served
active duty but can't find room in an active
reserve unit). In addition, the Army reserves
are now IxMng reorganized across the nation;


Walter Findeison: "I doubt that
we'll be seeing many graduate de
ferments after June/'
many units are being deactivated and many re
servists are left over. Reserve units must fill
their vacancies first from this pool of men.
The local training center has even tempo
rarily discarded waiting lists.
The situation for conscientious objectors
varies from person to person and from draft
board to draft board. And the system is be
coming "less and less predictable," according
to Alan Strain, an associate field secretary with
the Central Committee for Conscientious Ob
jectors.
This year's seniors fall into two categories:
those who filed C.O. forms when they regis
tered with the draft at age 18, and those who
did not. A man filing his Form 150 just before
he graduates "is in a very difficult position in
establishing his credibility," Strain said. Draft
boards tend to regard skeptically a person
who has just recently decided to be a C.O. By
contrast, three-quarters of those who filed
Form 150's when they registered are being
classified C.O.'s.
The problem is now greater than ever,
and promises to get worse as graduation ap
proaches. Strain pointed out most students

used to relegate the draft to a corner of their
minds, thinking they would probably be in
school until they were 26 or had a family.
Today, however, with graduate students
suddenly eligible for the draft, many men are
forced to "sit down and think about just what
their position on the draft is," Strain said. The
stream of young men into Strain's office on the
third floor of the Clubhouse has been growing
steadily since October, his first month here. At
that time, he saw about 25 to 30 men per
month. This month he expects to see 80.
Draft boards, as we have said, tend not to
believe men who claim recent changes of
heart. The courts, however, aie beginning to
recognize the realities of the situation, Strain
said, namely that "people being what they are,
they often put off difficult decisions until they
are faced with a crisis in their own lives."
What is making the draft boards more and
more unpredictable? A little-noticed change
in the draft law, which became effective last
July, has resulted in big turnovers in many
boards. The members of all local boards are
now limited to 25-year terms, where before
they were appointed to lifetime terms. Also,

board members must now retire at 75, where
before there was no age limit and some local
boards had members in their 90's. It is too
early, Strain said, to say how these changes
will affect the boards' attitudes to conscien
tious objection.

The question for the class of '68 comes down
to figuring the odds. Right now, there is no
way of knowing even the percentage of June
graduates who will be drafted, let alone which
individuals. So there is no way to figure the
odds; no way to decide whether to sit and wait
for the draft or take a chance and go to grad
uate school; no way to tell a possible employer
whether someone he hires will be drafted the
next day or maybe never.
Those who will fight the draft, often ille
gally, are dedicated but few. But those whose
lives are torn between a reluctance to defy
authority and a deadening sense of uncertainty
mingled with futility—these tens of thousands
of young men are being driven up the wall.
They want to know what is in store for them
this June, and they want to know why, and
thev want to know now.
