# Anti-Draft Union: a chance to resist
## 
### 
For graduating seniors, and other inductable
young men, there are ways of avoiding all
forms of military service, according to Leon
ard Siegel, spokesman for the Stanford Anti-
Draft Union.
The Anti-Draft Union was formed last Feb
ruary to advise prospective "draft dodgers" of
possible alternatives and their consequences.
Siegel describes the Union as "a group of
young men and women who have banded to
gether to fight the draft. We do this not only
because it is becoming more difficult to dodge
the draft, but also to make young people an
effective political force."
The Selective Service System is governed by
a complex assortment of regulations. Accord
ing to Siegel, some individuals are hurt by
these technicalities and inconsistencies, but
others have been helped. The U*,ion maintains
a staff of volunteer researchers .vho "continu
ally delve into the intricacies of the Selective
Service System." The results of this research
are briefly reviewed in this article.
It is possible for one to delay his induction
and/or his physical examination. One way of
accomplishing this is to transfer the location of
the physical or induction, as Siegel explains:
"If you are living in Santa Clara County and
have been called for a physical or induction in
New York, you can present yourself at the San
Jose Draft Board a few days prior to your re
porting date. You will then be scheduled for
bussing to Oakland.
"Under normal circumstances, the red tape
takes up about a month. If you can then estab
lish residence in San Mateo County—requiring
that you report to the San Mateo induction
center — your appearance can be postponed
another month. Unfortunately, this cannot be
continued indefinitely."
Siegel noted that applying for conscientious
objection status, with the accompanying ap
peals circuit, can delay an inductee's process
ing for over a year. Refusal to sign security and
personal history forms may also postpone in
duction while the F. 8.1, investigates the indi
vidual's background. Shorter delays can be ob
tained, Siegel adds, if one is verifiably sick or
has an appointment which cannot be missed
(such as school registration).
Siegel emphasized that the best ways of
avoiding the draft are qualifying for either a
1-Y or a IV-F classification. IV-F means one is
not qualified for service. A 1-Y classification
means one is qualified only in the case of a de
clared war or a national emergency. These
classifications are usually awarded to men who
are physically, psychologically, or morally un
fit or politically unacceptable. Siegel adds that
a college student or graduate "will never be
considered mentally unfit."
A physical deferment might be granted for
a defect "even as small as chronic athlete's
foot or allergies," said Siegel. "You are required
by law to report anything which could result
in a change of status," he continued. "Letters
should be sent from a personal physician to the
local board verifying the problem. You can ask
to be examined by the local board medical ad
viser who can exempt you, but not determine
you fit."
Most medical deferments, however, are not
made until pre-induction physicals. Siegel ad
vises the inductee to "take medical records and
letters from your own doctor to the examina
tion and point out 'defects' to the examining
physician." lie warns that examiners are often
"wary of men obviously trying to get out. For
getting one's glasses on the examination day,
though, might at least delay classification."
The Anti-Draft Union sells copies of the
long list of medical conditions which can dis
qualify a registrant and offers limited medical
counseling. Siegel rioted that as a last resort,
after one has passed his induction physical, he
"can still get out at the brief examination upon
induction. But don't count on it because they
often don't make examinations unless re
quested to do so."

Psychological deferments are given "in
roughly the same way as physical deferments
with psychiatrists replacing the doctors," Sie
gel said. "A man may ask to see a psychiatrist
or act weird or disruptive at his physical. As
a result, the examination is often extended
through the next morning so that the individ
ual can be interviewed by a psychiatrist." He
added that chances of obtaining a psychologi
cal deferment increase if the man has a history
of psychological disorders.
Referring to the morally unfit category, Sie
gel mentioned the detailed explanation in
"Alice's Restaurant" recorded by Arlo Guthrie.
While it is well known, commented Siegel, that
homosexuals "are not wanted in the military,
it is not generally realized that most moral ex
emptions result from criminal prosecutions or
convictions. If someone has court proceedings
pending—excluding traffic violations—he can
not be drafted. This also means a man cannot
be inducted while in jail, out on bail, in court,
on probation, or evading or resisting arrest.
"Furthermore, if someone has a criminal rec
ord, his case is forwarded to the Waivers
Board in Washington. This group of men eval
uates the crime and decides if the man should
be permitted to join the military ranks." Siegel
added that in cases of habitual misdemeanor
convictions or a felony conviction waivers are
rare.
The system of deferments is used, says Sie
gel, "to channel young men into certain occu
pations. The political deferment is an excep
tion. If one works long and hard enough he can
probably convince the Selective Service Sys
tem that he is working against the national
interest. In spite of General Hershey's recent
directive, if a man can build up an apparent
history of radical political activity, he may be
rejected. Usually radicals threaten to organize
resistance within the military if drafted.
Enough have effectively done so that the army
is unwilling to increase their number."
Siegel continued, "Officially, no one is
granted a political exemption — except per
haps members of certain left-wing organiza
tions. Other reasons, like physical disabilities,
are used to cover up the obvious political ones.

If someone has had dealings with a 'subversive
organization,' then he should note this fact on
the questionnaire he receives at his physical or
induction. If no such background can be veri
fied, then a refusal to sign the security form
and all subsequent documents necessitates an
F. 8.1, investigation."
Siegel cited several men who had written
their draft boards of their intentions to organ
ize within the military — including notes and
articles detailing their political viewpoints.
"All materials sent to the board become part
of a registrant's permanent fi!e. One's political
stands can also be stated on a C.O. applica
tion."
Siegel noted that some deferments have
been given to men who "caused trouble at
their physicals—leafleting, shouting about the
war, speaking personally but obviously against
the war to other inductees, or trying to organ
ize the induction staff to oppose the war." He
emphasized that in this case, as in most of the
others discussed, there is a risk of arrest.
As a final alternative to the draft, Siegel
termed Canada "an excellent possibility if one
is willing to lose the chance to ever return to
this country. The new Canadian immigration
law favors men with college educations, al
though certain procedures must be followed
because there arc 'prohibited classes' of unac
ceptables."
The Anti-Draft Union has leaflets available
which were published by Canadian anti-draft
groups to explain problems of emigration.
Siegel emphasized the importance of seek
ing advice before taking any definite course
of action. "It is vital that one's knowledge of
a possible way to avoid the draft is supple
mented by awareness of one's chances of suc
cess and the possible implications of the al
ternative.
"Many of our friends know sure ways to
dodge the draft. Chances are that there is
someone in the army who tried that gimmick
and failed. The safest way to proceed is to talk
to many people about what you've heard and
then go to a qualified draft counselor," Siegel
concluded.
