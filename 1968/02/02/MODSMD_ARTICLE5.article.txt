"I plan to join the army. I would join even if the
draft were not facing me. I'm one of the few who
think the draft is not the end of the world, and I am
not a dove on Vietnam. I'm a year younger than most
of my colleagues, and I can use the three years in the
army to benefit me later in Foreign Service work. I
hope to go to Monterey Language School and study
Chinese. It's a difficult decision to make, and a lot of
the people faced with the draft never gave the military
much thought. But if someone has always figured he'd
go in and get the best out of the army, it isn't such a
problem."

"I want to continue my studies next year toward
a graduate degree in theology or a law degree. The
only way to insure that I will be able to complete this
study is to enroll in an ROTC program, and thereby
commit myself to several years of military service fol
lowing completion of graduate studies. In choosing
this course, 1 am hoping the Vietnam conflict will be
completed and that I will not be faced with service
in that war. If faced now with the choice whether to
fight in Vietnam, I don't know what my decision would
be. I only hope the Vietnam war is past when I serve."

studies. Conservatives have long favored a volunteer
army rather than the draft, but that doesn't mean we
do not support conscription in times of war. And I will
serve if I am drafted."

was 1-A until recently. I was working in Washington,
D.C. for a year. But my draft board has now given me
a 2-S until I graduate. At that time they suggest I
submit a further request. If I am drafted, the scholar
