# 'Graduate:' Holden Caulfield of the '60's
## 
### 
It would seem Mike Nichols can do no wrong. If a director's
first feature happens to be successful, the chances are ex
cellent his second will flop. But Nichols' first film is Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and his second is The Graduate.
Based on a slim, forgettable first novel of a few years back,
The Graduate is Benjamin Braddock who is successful beyond
belief: he has good grades, good organizations, good awards
and good looks. Benjamin arrives home to Los Angeles, rapidly
accustoms himself to the hometown milieu and begins brooding
his future. He also rapidly accustoms himself to an affair with
Mrs. Robinson, who happens to be the wife of his father's best
friend and business partner. To culminate his relationship with
the Robinsons, Benjamin falls in love with their daughter,
Elaine.
From here, the plot speeds up rapidly. Benjamin confesses
his affair to Elaine. Elaine runs back to Berkeley. Benjamin
follows her to Berkeley. The Robinsons accelerate Elaine's
plans to wed someone else. Benjamin drives from Berkeley to
L.A. to Berkeley to Santa Barbara—in time to successfully
disrupt the wedding ceremony and rescue Elaine.
Nichols has blown up this small beginning into a gigantic
cinematic goodie. Using the novel as a skeleton on which to
hang his fancy trappings, he elaborates and embellishes vir
tually every scene in the book—Benjamin's first encounter ses
sion with Mrs. Robinson ("Take me home!"), their first meet
ing at the Taft Hotel ("This is your first time, isn't it?"), their
Art-Alcohol-Backseats-Elaine discussion ("I do not think you
are an alcoholic wreck, Mrs. Robinson"), and his first date
with Elaine ("Are you having an affair, Benjamin?"). In addi
tion, the Sounds of Silence sequence (the interlude following
his first seduction) has been added and the ending has been
changed from inconclusive to happy. However, we still don't
know why Benjamin has come to brood so much about his sup
posedly rosy future.
To this base, Nichols applies a bravura cinematic technique
which is at once totally derivative and utterly convincing. It is
derivative because nothing is new. The sequence in which
Mrs. Robinson strips and Benjamin turns—and turns again and
again and again—is copied from The Knack which copied it
from Marienbad. The Sounds of Silence sequence was done
with more skill and greater success in the credits sequence of
Mickey One. Nonsynchronous sound and image was employed
first and most thoroughly in Hiroshima and as recently as
Bonnie and Clyde.
Yet, the technique of The Graduate is still convincing, be
cause Nichols has mastered the techniques he uses. Except for
a few lapses—Benjamin dives off the board and onto Mrs. Rob
inson, the monkeys mugging in the zoo—he succeeds in con
vincing us he has done the right thing at the right time.
Nichols has been aided in his endeavors by some excellent
acting. Newcomer Dust in Hoffman as Benjamin is the most
outstanding. His amazingly free, spontaneous performance is
punctuated by the doubt, the nervousness, the general uptight
ncss of a young man embarking on his first love affair. The
humor is so excruciating up to the Sounds of Silence sequence,
that as with Catcher in the Rye, you don't know whether to
laugh or to cry.
Anne Bancroft is superb as that stealthy, languid, experi
enced, and at times brutally cold quantity known as Mrs. Rob
inson. With her beautiful face and long hair, and good lines
(spoken as well as visual), Katherine Ross as Elaine proves to
be a strong rival of her mother for Benjamin's affection.
The others in the cast are obviously more caricatures than
people. They exist as so many Oldenburg soft sculptures, in

habiting a vibrating vinyl world symbolized by L.A.: good ol'
Mom and Pop Braddock with their swimming pool mentality
and the Berkeley boarding house owner, who had "Prevert!"
on the tip of his tongue but could never quite get it out.
But the vacuity of the minor players leads to the realization
that, although puffed up and glossed over, The Graduate
started out as a melodramatic novel and has ended up a melo
dramatic movie.
The characters, when not caricatures, are ideal types straight
out of romantic fiction—very rarely flesh and blood. The beauty
of youth as a romantic fiction is proclaimed throughout. Ben
jamin is the successful June Graduate who has succumbed to
the materialism, lethargy and ennui of Southern California,
symbolized by that most beautiful of alcoholic wrecks, Mrs.
Robinson. Elaine is pure and not to be sullied; she is young and
beautiful; and she even goes to Berkeley.
The mixture of styles and tones, of comedy and melodrama,
prevents The Graduate from being successful as a but
ensures that it will succeed in parts. And when these parts do
succeed, they exude a powerful feeling of contemporaneity.
The Graduate is modern in technique, representing (along
with Bonnie and Clyde) the successful introduction of recent
"art" film techniques in a film made for a mass audience. It
simply could not have been made five years ago.
The Graduate is also contemporary in content. Besides fea
turing the songs of Simon and Garfunkle, Elaine goes to Berke
ley; Benjamin is an anti-hero; his parents are stereotyped sub
urbanites; and much of the action takes place against a back
drop which includes the Sunset Strip, Berkeley, Moe's Books,
The Print Mint—even a Family Dog poster.
More than this, however, The Graduate is contemporary in
the sense that it's very much rooted in the '60's, while a work
like Catcher reflects more accurately the '50's. For, underneath
the gloss, underneath the katered kitsch, Nichols has caught
hold of something and that something is a way of feeling, a
sense of what it's like to be alive right now.

beautiful; and she even goes to Berkeley.
The mixture of styles and tones, of comedy and melodrama,
prevents The Graduate from being successful as a but
ensures that it will succeed in parts. And when these parts do
succeed, they exude a powerful feeling of contemporaneity.
The Graduate is modern in technique, representing (along
with Bonnie and Clyde) the successful introduction of recent
"art" film techniques in a film made for a mass audience. It
simply could not have been made five years ago.
The Graduate is also contemporary in content. Besides fea
turing the songs of Simon and Garfunkle, Elaine goes to Berke
ley; Benjamin is an anti-hero; his parents are stereotyped sub
urbanites; and much of the action takes place against a back
drop which includes the Sunset Strip, Berkeley, Moe's Books,
The Print Mint—even a Family Dog poster.
More than this, however, The Graduate is contemporary in
the sense that it's very much rooted in the '60's, while a work
like Catcher reflects more accurately the '50's. For, underneath
the gloss, underneath the katered kitsch, Nichols has caught
hold of something and that something is a way of feeling, a
sense of what it's like to be alive right now.

It would seem Mike Nichols can do no wrong. If a director's
first feature happens to be successful, the chances are ex
cellent his second will flop. But Nichols' first film is Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and his second is The Graduate.
Based on a slim, forgettable first novel of a few years back,
The Graduate is Benjamin Braddock who is successful beyond
belief: he has good grades, good organizations, good awards
and good looks. Benjamin arrives home to Los Angeles, rapidly
accustoms himself to the hometown milieu and begins brooding
his future. He also rapidly accustoms himself to an affair with
Mrs. Robinson, who happens to be the wife of his father's best
friend and business partner. To culminate his relationship with
the Robinsons, Benjamin falls in love with their daughter,
Elaine.
From here, the plot speeds up rapidly. Benjamin confesses
his affair to Elaine. Elaine runs back to Berkeley. Benjamin
follows her to Berkeley. The Robinsons accelerate Elaine's
plans to wed someone else. Benjamin drives from Berkeley to
L.A. to Berkeley to Santa Barbara—in time to successfully
disrupt the wedding ceremony and rescue Elaine.
Nichols has blown up this small beginning into a gigantic
cinematic goodie. Using the novel as a skeleton on which to
hang his fancy trappings, he elaborates and embellishes vir
tually every scene in the book—Benjamin's first encounter ses
sion with Mrs. Robinson ("Take me home!"), their first meet
ing at the Taft Hotel ("This is your first time, isn't it?"), their
Art-Alcohol-Backseats-Elaine discussion ("I do not think you
are an alcoholic wreck, Mrs. Robinson"), and his first date
with Elaine ("Are you having an affair, Benjamin?"). In addi
tion, the Sounds of Silence sequence (the interlude following
his first seduction) has been added and the ending has been
changed from inconclusive to happy. However, we still don't
know why Benjamin has come to brood so much about his sup
posedly rosy future.
To this base, Nichols applies a bravura cinematic technique
which is at once totally derivative and utterly convincing. It is
derivative because nothing is new. The sequence in which
Mrs. Robinson strips and Benjamin turns—and turns again and
again and again—is copied from The Knack which copied it
from Marienbad. The Sounds of Silence sequence was done
with more skill and greater success in the credits sequence of
Mickey One. Nonsynchronous sound and image was employed
first and most thoroughly in Hiroshima and as recently as
Bonnie and Clyde.
Yet, the technique of The Graduate is still convincing, be
cause Nichols has mastered the techniques he uses. Except for
a few lapses—Benjamin dives off the board and onto Mrs. Rob
inson, the monkeys mugging in the zoo—he succeeds in con
vincing us he has done the right thing at the right time.
Nichols has been aided in his endeavors by some excellent
acting. Newcomer Dust in Hoffman as Benjamin is the most
outstanding. His amazingly free, spontaneous performance is
punctuated by the doubt, the nervousness, the general uptight
ncss of a young man embarking on his first love affair. The
humor is so excruciating up to the Sounds of Silence sequence,
that as with Catcher in the Rye, you don't know whether to
laugh or to cry.
Anne Bancroft is superb as that stealthy, languid, experi
enced, and at times brutally cold quantity known as Mrs. Rob
inson. With her beautiful face and long hair, and good lines
(spoken as well as visual), Katherine Ross as Elaine proves to
be a strong rival of her mother for Benjamin's affection.
The others in the cast are obviously more caricatures than
people. They exist as so many Oldenburg soft sculptures, in

habiting a vibrating vinyl world symbolized by L.A.: good ol'
Mom and Pop Braddock with their swimming pool mentality
and the Berkeley boarding house owner, who had "Prevert!"
on the tip of his tongue but could never quite get it out.
But the vacuity of the minor players leads to the realization
that, although puffed up and glossed over, The Graduate
started out as a melodramatic novel and has ended up a melo
dramatic movie.
The characters, when not caricatures, are ideal types straight
out of romantic fiction—very rarely flesh and blood. The beauty
of youth as a romantic fiction is proclaimed throughout. Ben
jamin is the successful June Graduate who has succumbed to
the materialism, lethargy and ennui of Southern California,
symbolized by that most beautiful of alcoholic wrecks, Mrs.
Robinson. Elaine is pure and not to be sullied; she is young and
beautiful; and she even goes to Berkeley.

laugh or to cry.
Anne Bancroft is superb as that stealthy, languid, experi
enced, and at times brutally cold quantity known as Mrs. Rob
inson. With her beautiful face and long hair, and good lines
(spoken as well as visual), Katherine Ross as Elaine proves to
be a strong rival of her mother for Benjamin's affection.
The others in the cast are obviously more caricatures than
people. They exist as so many Oldenburg soft sculptures, in

habiting a vibrating vinyl world symbolized by L.A.: good ol'
Mom and Pop Braddock with their swimming pool mentality
and the Berkeley boarding house owner, who had "Prevert!"
on the tip of his tongue but could never quite get it out.
But the vacuity of the minor players leads to the realization
that, although puffed up and glossed over, The Graduate
started out as a melodramatic novel and has ended up a melo
dramatic movie.
The characters, when not caricatures, are ideal types straight
out of romantic fiction—very rarely flesh and blood. The beauty
of youth as a romantic fiction is proclaimed throughout. Ben
jamin is the successful June Graduate who has succumbed to
the materialism, lethargy and ennui of Southern California,
symbolized by that most beautiful of alcoholic wrecks, Mrs.
Robinson. Elaine is pure and not to be sullied; she is young and
beautiful; and she even goes to Berkeley.
The mixture of styles and tones, of comedy and melodrama,
prevents The Graduate from being successful as a but
ensures that it will succeed in parts. And when these parts do
succeed, they exude a powerful feeling of contemporaneity.
The Graduate is modern in technique, representing (along
with Bonnie and Clyde) the successful introduction of recent
"art" film techniques in a film made for a mass audience. It
simply could not have been made five years ago.
The Graduate is also contemporary in content. Besides fea
turing the songs of Simon and Garfunkle, Elaine goes to Berke
ley; Benjamin is an anti-hero; his parents are stereotyped sub
urbanites; and much of the action takes place against a back
drop which includes the Sunset Strip, Berkeley, Moe's Books,
The Print Mint—even a Family Dog poster.
More than this, however, The Graduate is contemporary in
the sense that it's very much rooted in the '60's, while a work
like Catcher reflects more accurately the '50's. For, underneath
the gloss, underneath the katered kitsch, Nichols has caught
hold of something and that something is a way of feeling, a
sense of what it's like to be alive right now.

It would seem Mike Nichols can do no wrong. If a director's
first feature happens to be successful, the chances are ex
cellent his second will flop. But Nichols' first film is Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and his second is The Graduate.
Based on a slim, forgettable first novel of a few years back,
The Graduate is Benjamin Braddock who is successful beyond
belief: he has good grades, good organizations, good awards
and good looks. Benjamin arrives home to Los Angeles, rapidly
accustoms himself to the hometown milieu and begins brooding
his future. He also rapidly accustoms himself to an affair with
Mrs. Robinson, who happens to be the wife of his father's best
friend and business partner. To culminate his relationship with
the Robinsons, Benjamin falls in love with their daughter,
Elaine.
From here, the plot speeds up rapidly. Benjamin confesses
his affair to Elaine. Elaine runs back to Berkeley. Benjamin
follows her to Berkeley. The Robinsons accelerate Elaine's
plans to wed someone else. Benjamin drives from Berkeley to
L.A. to Berkeley to Santa Barbara—in time to successfully
disrupt the wedding ceremony and rescue Elaine.
Nichols has blown up this small beginning into a gigantic
cinematic goodie. Using the novel as a skeleton on which to
hang his fancy trappings, he elaborates and embellishes vir
tually every scene in the book—Benjamin's first encounter ses
sion with Mrs. Robinson ("Take me home!"), their first meet
ing at the Taft Hotel ("This is your first time, isn't it?"), their
Art-Alcohol-Backseats-Elaine discussion ("I do not think you
are an alcoholic wreck, Mrs. Robinson"), and his first date
with Elaine ("Are you having an affair, Benjamin?"). In addi
tion, the Sounds of Silence sequence (the interlude following
his first seduction) has been added and the ending has been
changed from inconclusive to happy. However, we still don't
know why Benjamin has come to brood so much about his sup
posedly rosy future.
To this base, Nichols applies a bravura cinematic technique
which is at once totally derivative and utterly convincing. It is
derivative because nothing is new. The sequence in which
Mrs. Robinson strips and Benjamin turns—and turns again and
again and again—is copied from The Knack which copied it
from Marienbad. The Sounds of Silence sequence was done
with more skill and greater success in the credits sequence of
Mickey One. Nonsynchronous sound and image was employed
first and most thoroughly in Hiroshima and as recently as
Bonnie and Clyde.
Yet, the technique of The Graduate is still convincing, be
cause Nichols has mastered the techniques he uses. Except for
a few lapses—Benjamin dives off the board and onto Mrs. Rob
inson, the monkeys mugging in the zoo—he succeeds in con
vincing us he has done the right thing at the right time.
Nichols has been aided in his endeavors by some excellent
acting. Newcomer Dust in Hoffman as Benjamin is the most
outstanding. His amazingly free, spontaneous performance is
punctuated by the doubt, the nervousness, the general uptight
ncss of a young man embarking on his first love affair. The
humor is so excruciating up to the Sounds of Silence sequence,
that as with Catcher in the Rye, you don't know whether to
