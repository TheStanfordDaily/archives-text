# Renoir and Dreyer films come to Stanford
## 
### 
As the reigning grand old man of French
cinema, Jean Renoir was very nearly the only
older director who escaped the wrath of the
"new wave" filmmakers. In contrast to the
stuffy, stilted conservatism of the others, the
new wavers acclaimed Renoir's naturalness,
his improvisatory talents, and his non-perfec
tionist attitudes.
Renoir at last seemed to be vindicated.
Thirty years ago he was shooting outside door
ways, his actors walked in and out of frame,
their heads and feet sometimes cut off. For
Renoir, as well as Dreyer, life is more impor
tant than art. To plan and act out a scene is
to risk destroying its lifefulness.
Renoir's anti-art statements reach an ex
treme when he says: "Great art is made by
artisans and not by artists" and "Imagination
is the thing to be afraid of and"I believe cin
ema, and moreover every art, is made of happv
chances." While his works are often erratic and
imperfect in technique, he is often able to
catch life, to evoke the feeling of a person and
place.
Twenty years after his acknowledged mas
terpieces of the thirties, instead of falling back
on a mature style developed over the years,
Renoir can make a picture like "Picnic on

the Grass," a film heavily relying on improvi
sation ipr success.
"And I believe, I believe as firmly as anyone
can, that all the inferior aspects of our civili
zation—which has superior aspects, of course,
which has great beauties—l believe that all its
petty sides, all that is rotten in this civilization
of the twentieth century, come from the plan.
That is what is rotten —the plan."

The films of Carl Theodor Dreyer are more
talked about than looked at. He is invariably
ranked with Griffith, Eisenstein and Murnau
as a master of the medium, but he has made
only four films in the past 35 years. He has had
a script and production plans ready for his
proposed Jesus-film for twenty years, but is
still unable to obtain the necessary backing.
Born in 1890, Dreyer began by doing sub
titles for silent films. He graduated to writing
scenarios and, finally, to filming novels. Of this
period he writes, "I 'went to school' for five
years. Today, when I work, the film edits itself
in my head, gradually during the shooting."
Both Dreyer and Renoir desire to be true to
the moment; to create not recreate an action
on film. "This is something I really tried to do,"

says Dreyer, "to find a style that has value for
only a single film, for this milieu, this action,
this character, this subject."
For Dreyer, this entails an extensive and de
tailed examination of his actors, who are gen
erally amateurs. "What interests me—and this
comcs before technique—is to reproduce, as
sincerely as possible, the most sincere feelings
possible." This attention to his characters
reaches its logical culmination in Joan of Arc
where he never uses a long shot without an
accompanying closeup, resulting in an intense
feeling of intimacy.
The same attention to detail yields a slow,
stately, lingering movement, a style which
Dreyer insists is completely natural. "Every
one sets himself to look for a style — here,
there, and everywhere. But it is much more
simple, for, basically, everything in the film is
always natural. The actors act in a completely
natural way. They walk, they talk, in a natual
rhythm."
Frequently against the rules, passionately
dedicated, Dreyer patiently waits to make his
Jesus-film, based on his personal experience in
German - occupied Denmark during World
War 11.

sincerely as possible, the most sincere feelings
possible." This attention to his characters
reaches its logical culmination in Joan of Arc
where he never uses a long shot without an
accompanying closeup, resulting in an intense
feeling of intimacy.
The same attention to detail yields a slow,
stately, lingering movement, a style which
Dreyer insists is completely natural. "Every
one sets himself to look for a style — here,
there, and everywhere. But it is much more
simple, for, basically, everything in the film is
always natural. The actors act in a completely
natural way. They walk, they talk, in a natual
rhythm."

Jesus-film, based on his personal experience in
German - occupied Denmark during World

As the reigning grand old man of French
cinema, Jean Renoir was very nearly the only
older director who escaped the wrath of the
"new wave" filmmakers. In contrast to the
stuffy, stilted conservatism of the others, the
new wavers acclaimed Renoir's naturalness,
his improvisatory talents, and his non-perfec
tionist attitudes.
Renoir at last seemed to be vindicated.
Thirty years ago he was shooting outside door
ways, his actors walked in and out of frame,
their heads and feet sometimes cut off. For
Renoir, as well as Dreyer, life is more impor
tant than art. To plan and act out a scene is
to risk destroying its lifefulness.
Renoir's anti-art statements reach an ex
treme when he says: "Great art is made by
artisans and not by artists" and "Imagination
is the thing to be afraid of and"I believe cin
ema, and moreover every art, is made of happv
chances." While his works are often erratic and
imperfect in technique, he is often able to
catch life, to evoke the feeling of a person and
place.
Twenty years after his acknowledged mas
terpieces of the thirties, instead of falling back
on a mature style developed over the years,
Renoir can make a picture like "Picnic on

the Grass," a film heavily relying on improvi
sation ipr success.
"And I believe, I believe as firmly as anyone
can, that all the inferior aspects of our civili
zation—which has superior aspects, of course,
which has great beauties—l believe that all its
petty sides, all that is rotten in this civilization
of the twentieth century, come from the plan.
That is what is rotten —the plan."

The films of Carl Theodor Dreyer are more
talked about than looked at. He is invariably
ranked with Griffith, Eisenstein and Murnau
as a master of the medium, but he has made
only four films in the past 35 years. He has had
a script and production plans ready for his
proposed Jesus-film for twenty years, but is
still unable to obtain the necessary backing.
Born in 1890, Dreyer began by doing sub
titles for silent films. He graduated to writing
scenarios and, finally, to filming novels. Of this
period he writes, "I 'went to school' for five
years. Today, when I work, the film edits itself
in my head, gradually during the shooting."
Both Dreyer and Renoir desire to be true to
the moment; to create not recreate an action
on film. "This is something I really tried to do,"

says Dreyer, "to find a style that has value for
only a single film, for this milieu, this action,
this character, this subject."
For Dreyer, this entails an extensive and de
tailed examination of his actors, who are gen
erally amateurs. "What interests me—and this
comcs before technique—is to reproduce, as
sincerely as possible, the most sincere feelings
possible." This attention to his characters
