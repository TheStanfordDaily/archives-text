SAUVE DES EAUX") 1932. Only subtitled and released
now —35 years after it was made —Boudu (Michel Simon)

but his maid too.
• Feb B—"The Lower Depths" ("LES BAS FONDS")

proved this scenario before his death. Starring Jean Gabin,

Fresnay.
• Feb. 22—"Picnic on the Grass" ("LE DEJEUNER SUR
L'HERBE") 1959. Written, produced and directed by Re
noir, "Picnic" is Renoir's idea of the life fort* routing the
forces of the machine age. A good example of how erratic
he can be and how improvizational he still is.

established Renoir's reputation as a master by the end of
the 30's. A portrait of French society on the eve of World
