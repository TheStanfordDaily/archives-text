How To Find Yourself
College is an important time of life. Integrating ourselves into tho adult
community we must sever some umbilical ties with childhood and family
and deliberately examine the faith of our parents to get some of our own.
A man's time in school can be unforgettably wonderful, rich and rewarding
in spite of the stress, competition and shortness of funds. As we grow up,
most all of us come to a crisis of identity when the age-old question "who
am I" must be answered for oneself through a personal encounter with God.
In the Sinai desert about thirty-five hundred years ago a Jew named
Moses was sought out by God: "The angel of the Lord (Jesus Christ) appeared
to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and Moses looked, and
lo, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed. And Moses said, 'I will
turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.' When the
Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush,
Moses, Moses!' And Moses said, "Here am I.' Then God said, 'Do not come
near; put off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you are
standing is holy ground' In the ensuing discussion, God told Moses he was
to lead nearly two million Jews out of Egypt across a great wilderness to a
new, promised land. In response to this calling Moses said to God, "If I come
to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent
me to you', and they ask me What is his name?' what shall I say to them?"
God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM". "Say this to the people of Israel,
'I AM has sent me to you. . ".
The great name of God, "I AM WHO I AM" (Yahweh or Jehova), also
translatable from the Hebrew, "IWILL BE WHO I WILL BE" reveals God as
an all-sufficient Person, a great eternal Spirit Being, "the Father of spirits",
as the New Testament calls him. According to the Bible, we men on earth
are containers for God, vessels in which the God of Moses would like to
dwell. Without him we are nothing, like a light bulb without electricity, or
a plant uprooted from the soil. With him we are persons, drawing our life
from his endless Power, fulfilling ourselves through total, free-will depend
ence on him. This is what we've been made for. In God alone men find
themselves. Truth never changes.
Two thousand years ago Jesus of Nazareth outraged the religious hypo
crites of his day who asked about his age and identity. His answer was brief
and to the point, "Before Abraham was, I AM" (John 8:58). Those of us who
know Jesus Christ personally, because His Spirit lives in us, don't claim to
have all the answers; we're still learning, too. But we'd like you to meet our
Master who has helped us to find ourselves fully. Jesus said, "If anyone
thirsts let him come to me and drink. He who believes in me, as the Scripture
has said, Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water' "?

new, promised land. In response to this calling Moses said to God, "If I come
to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent
me to you', and they ask me What is his name?' what shall I say to them?"
God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM". "Say this to the people of Israel,
'I AM has sent me to you. . ".
The great name of God, "I AM WHO I AM" (Yahweh or Jehova), also
translatable from the Hebrew, "IWILL BE WHO I WILL BE" reveals God as
an all-sufficient Person, a great eternal Spirit Being, "the Father of spirits",
as the New Testament calls him. According to the Bible, we men on earth
are containers for God, vessels in which the God of Moses would like to
dwell. Without him we are nothing, like a light bulb without electricity, or
a plant uprooted from the soil. With him we are persons, drawing our life
from his endless Power, fulfilling ourselves through total, free-will depend
ence on him. This is what we've been made for. In God alone men find
themselves. Truth never changes.
Two thousand years ago Jesus of Nazareth outraged the religious hypo
crites of his day who asked about his age and identity. His answer was brief
and to the point, "Before Abraham was, I AM" (John 8:58). Those of us who
know Jesus Christ personally, because His Spirit lives in us, don't claim to
have all the answers; we're still learning, too. But we'd like you to meet our
Master who has helped us to find ourselves fully. Jesus said, "If anyone
thirsts let him come to me and drink. He who believes in me, as the Scripture
has said, Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water' "?

How To Find Yourself
College is an important time of life. Integrating ourselves into tho adult
community we must sever some umbilical ties with childhood and family
and deliberately examine the faith of our parents to get some of our own.
A man's time in school can be unforgettably wonderful, rich and rewarding
in spite of the stress, competition and shortness of funds. As we grow up,
most all of us come to a crisis of identity when the age-old question "who
am I" must be answered for oneself through a personal encounter with God.
In the Sinai desert about thirty-five hundred years ago a Jew named
Moses was sought out by God: "The angel of the Lord (Jesus Christ) appeared
to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush; and Moses looked, and
lo, the bush was burning, yet it was not consumed. And Moses said, 'I will
turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.' When the
Lord saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the bush,
Moses, Moses!' And Moses said, "Here am I.' Then God said, 'Do not come
near; put off your shoes from your feet, for the place on which you are
standing is holy ground' In the ensuing discussion, God told Moses he was
to lead nearly two million Jews out of Egypt across a great wilderness to a
new, promised land. In response to this calling Moses said to God, "If I come
to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God of your fathers has sent
me to you', and they ask me What is his name?' what shall I say to them?"
God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM". "Say this to the people of Israel,
'I AM has sent me to you. . ".
