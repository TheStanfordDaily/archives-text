# Khe Sanh Under Heavy Red Attack
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — The North
Vietnamese unleashed a heavy
artillery and ground attack
against U.S. Marines in the
northwest corner of South Viet
nam early Monday that could
signal the start of their long
predicted offensive at Khe Sanh.
U.S. military headquarters re
ported the U.S. Marines combat
base at Khe Sanh received heavy
rocket, artillery and mortar bar
rages and the nearby Marine
held hill 861 was hit by a fierce
ground attack which penetrated
Marine outer defenses.
Each member of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff has signed, at
President Johnson's request,
a paper that says he believes
Khe Sanh in South Vietnam
can be defended successfully,
according to TIME magazine.
The magazine quoted John
son as warning the joint
chiefs at a White House dis
cussion: "I don't want any
damned Dlen Blen Phu."
TIME said Johnson cross
examined the joint chiefs at
length about the wisdom of
defending Khe Sanh and then
Insisted that each put his af
firmative view In writing.
Elsewhere in the country, the
biggest Communist offensive of
tho war entered its seventh day
with savage house-to-house bat
tles in Hue and fresh fighting
in Saigon.
U.S. spokesmen have said the
country-wide offensive the Com
munists launched last Tuesday
may have been intended in part
to divert attention from the
DMZ, where four and possibly
five North Vietnamese divisions
were reported poised for inva
sion.
In Monday's first action the
U.S. command said the Marines
on Hill 861 pushed the attacking
North Vietnamese off the hill
and out of the barbed wire de
fensive perimeter in the initial
25 minutes of fighting.
However, headquarters repor
ted, the Communists resumed
their ground attack at 6:20
a.m., but by 7:25 "the contact
had terminated with the enemy's
withdrawal," the command add
ed.
During the period from 4 a.m.
to 6:45 a.m.. headquarters said,
the Marine base at Khe Sanh
was under heavy artillery .roc
ket and mortar attack. By 7:45,
headquarters said, "Khe Sanh

is reported as quiet and the
airfield remains open."
It was still too early to say for
certain whether the heavy at
tacks meant the beginning of
the major North Vietnamese of
fensive which Gen. William C.
Westmoreland has predicted
will be their "main effort" of
the war,.
The U.S. Command an
nounced, meanwhile, that al
lied forces killed 16,976 enemy
troops in the period from 6
p.m. last Monday to midnight
Sunday. The toll was nearly
2,000 higher than the 14,997
enemy dead announced a day
earlier. In the same period,
the command said, 1,477 allied
soldiers were killed, including
471 Americans and 993 South
Vietnamese. The command re
ported 6,075 allied wounded, in
cluding 2,744 Americans and
3,299 South Vietnamese.
Fighting Continues
In Hue And Saigon
SAIGON (AP) — South Viet
namese planes bombed the an
cient Citadel in Hue Sunday but
apparently failed to blast open
its thick walls for infantrymen
to assault Communist troops
holding out inside. U.S. Marines
fought from house to house out-

side the Citadel in battles rem
iniscent of World War 11.
As the biggest Communist
offensive of the war went Into
its sixth day, fresh fighting
broke out in and around em
battled Saigon and the gov
ernment ordered everyone off
the streets after 7 p.m. under
pain of being shot on sight.
Attention focused on Hue, the
old capital where Vietnamese
kings once reigned, on the coast
in South Vietnam's invasion
prone northern sector.
About three companies of
Viet Cong guerrillas and
North Vietnamese army reg
ulars are holed up Inside the
Citadel apparently determined
to fight to the end if neces
sary. South Vietnamese
ground troops have been try
ing to get into the Citadel
for days but the walls and
heavy enemy fire kept them
back.
Piston-engine Skyraiders of
the South Vietnamese air force
were called in Sunday to bomb
the walls in hopes of giving the
ground troops an entry way.
The raid apparently failed.
There was no visible evidence of
any breach and hours after the
bombing attack the Viet Cong
flag still flew from the Citadel.
Across Hue's Perfume River,
U.S. Marines gained two blocks
in a day of house-to-house com

bat in their effort to rout the
Communists who hold about
two-thirds of Hue, a city of
40,000 persons.
• Rusk: Restraint
Shourn In Bombing
WASHINGTON (AP)— Secre
retary of State Dean Rusk said
Sunday the United States re
cently "exercised some re
straint" in bombing North Viet
nam while exploring the possi
bility of peace talks with Hanoi.
At the same time, Secretary
of Defense Robert S. Mc-
Namara—appearing jointly with
Rusk on a television-radio pro
gram—pointedly left open the
possibility more troops might be
deployed to Vietnam.
Both McNamara and Rusk
conceded that they have no
way of knowing whether the
Pueblo ever entered North Ko
rean territorial waters on its
extended mission along that
country's coast. But they said
they are convinced that at the
time of the seizure the spy ship
was outside the 12-mile limit
which North Korea claims.
Rusk indicated that Admin
istration views last week's big
Commuunist offensive against
South Vietnamese cities as de
facto rejection of those peace
probes.

SNIPERS ATTACK — U.S. Marines take cover behind a tank at Hue, South Vietnam, during last
week's terrorist attacks on South Vietnamese urban centers. The Marines, along with Vietnamese
troops, were battling an estimated 2,000 Viet Cong who occupied parts of the ancient Imperial city.
"We have not had a pause in
the traditionally accepted sense,
but we have limited the bomb
ing at certain points in order to
make it somewhat easier to car
ry forward these explorations,
so that a particularly difficult
incident would not interrupt
them," Rusk said.
Rusk said the air attacks were
restricted "particularly in th?
immediate vicinity of Hanoi and
Haiphong" after North Vietnam
stated it would talk if the at
tacks and other acts of war were
halted.
The U.S. position is that the
raids will be suspended if there
is reasonable assurance that
prompt, productive discussions
would follow, and that Hanoi
would not try to take military
advantage.
"We have not gone into a
pause as that word is generally
understood," Rusk said.
"In the face of all these ele
ments, they participated in lay
ing on this major offensive.
"Now I think it would be fool
ish not to draw a political con
clusion from this, that they are
not seriousy interested at the
present time in talking about
peaceful settlements."
McNamara disclosed that
within the hour after the elec
tronics-laden Pueblo was cap
tured Jan. 22, top secret U.S.
codes used in international com
nmuications were changed.
McNamara said it was uncer
tain how much secret equip
ment or classified information
fell into enemy hands but said
messages from the crew showed
destruction was started.
McNamara said sending of
warplanes to aid the Pueblo
might have precipitated a
bloody air battle. And, anyway,
he said, "no reaction force could
have saved that ship and crew."
• Olympic Time Out?
GRENOBLE, France (AP) —
The International Olympic Com
mittee called Sunday for a truce
in all hostilities around the

world during the Olympic
games.
The committe adopted unani
mously a resolution proposed by
Gen. Vladimir Stoytchev of Bul
garia. Col. John Westerhoff,
committee secretary, said there
was no mention of the Vietnam
war*
The resolution noted that dur
ing the ancient Olympic games,
fighting ceased and truces were
announced between hostile
countries.
• iVo Executions
SAIGON (AP) — Six execu
tion stakes at Saigon's central
market were removed Sunday,
leading to speculation that the
U.S. Embassy had urged the
South Vietnamese government
to be less harsh in its handling
of captuned Viet Cong.
The posts had been put up af
ter the Viet Cong began nation
wide attacks and raids on Sai
gon six days ago. The stakes
were never used, but there have
been reports of on-the-spot exe
cutions of captured Viet Cong on
the city's streets, and even exe
cutions without trial of Viet
Cong in Saigon's prisons.
The Embassy apparently also
was aware of worldwide reac
tion to a photograph showing
the South Vietnamese national
police director, Gen. Nguyen
Ngec Loan, shooting a captur,ed
Viet Cong in the head at point
black range on a Saigon street.
