# My Typewriter Is Bugged
## More War, More Propaganda 
### Michael Sweeney 
The bloody fighting in Viet
nam kept the Daily staff clust
ered around Associated Press
teletype last week, trying to put
the startling events in perspec
tive.
Sometimes the only certain
fact we could glean from the
Associated Press reports was
that the Vietcong hadn't yet seiz
ed control of the AP transmitter
in Saigon. If they had, we would
have received a different brand
of propaganda.
AP was guilty of blatant mis
reporting — its stories were
clumsily slanted in the worst

journalistic tradition. While
North Vietnamese troops roam
ed almost unopposed through the
streets of Saigon, Hue and Da
Nang, AP was sending out Viet
nam leads trumpeting the latest
U.S. Command reports of enemy
casualties.
AP told no deliberate untruths
in its Vietnam reports — as far
as we know. The press service
did pass on the ludicrous mis
representations by U.S. officials,
particularly Gen. William West
moreland.
Heighth of Distortion
When the news was worst, AP
distorted it most, reaching a
nadit on Wednesday. The Viet
nam lead began,
"SAIGON — The U.S. Com
mand reported Thursday nearly
5,000 Communists have been kill
ed throughout South Vietnam in
this week's wave of attacks on
Saigon and other major cities."
The story went on to list more
of the notoriously inaccui&te
casualty figures collected by the
South Vietnamese. To further
our understanding of the situa
tion, AP quoted several author
ities:
The U.S. Command: "It is
felt that we now have the ini
tiative and that we are no long
er reacting to enemy-initiated ac
tions but are seeking out the
enemy."
President Nguyen Van Thieu:
"The Communists' general offen
sive attempt has been completely
foiled."
Everett M. Dirksen: "The at
tacks were acts of desperation."
But a careful reading of this
AP release gave a hint of the
magnitude of the allied disasters.
Part of Hue was under Viet Cong
control. Two other northern
cities were subjected to "ground
probes for the third straight

day." A Saigon power plant was
blown up by guerrillas.
The AP story presented the
complicated Vietnam situation as
if the Viet Cong had suffered a
defeat. All across the United
States, newspapers picked up
the AP release and ran it ver
batim. A hurried Daily staff
member did the same thing, and
our Feb. 1 issue was dominated
by the headline, "5,000 Commu
nists Left Dead After Big Drive
On Viet Cities."
That Vietnam article shows
one of the pitfalls of the Daily's
attempt to cover world news. It
is difficult to select the really
newsworthy items out of the de
luge of AP wire copy, and the
AP tendency to spoon feed us
Official Versions doesn't help
any.
My criticism of AP, however,
doesn't mean the Daily is looking
for news stories which will play
up the Hanoi line. We get that
stuff in releases from the Lib
eration News Service, and regu
larly throw them in the waste
basket. Propaganda from either
side is worthless.
What are the facts of the Tet
offensive? With the help of the
New York Times, we conclude:
• Since Monday, Jan. 29, more
than half of South Vietnam's 44
provincial capitals were entered
in force by communist troops.
• Saigon was raided by bat
talion-sized units which still con
test large sections of the city.
• A lar.ge North Vietnamese
force equipped with anti-aircraft
guns holds the center of Hue, a
key city.
• The U.S. Command admits
471 American dead since Mon
day .along with 993 South Viet
namese. The allies claim 16,976
Communist casualties in the
reckless, daring attacks.

What next? Apparently the at
tacks on the cities are coordin
ated with the confrontation at
Khe Sanh near the North Viet
namese border. Five thousand
marines are surrounded thene
by the enemy, which can close
down the vital airfield with
heavy artillery. The threat to
Khe Sanh drained American
troops from elsewhere In the
country, weakening the cities' de
fenses. Gen. Westmoreland ex
pects the enemy's next move to
be on Khe Sanh itself.
Unanswered Questions
These questions are unanswer
ed:
• Is this a last gasp by the
Viet Cong? Can the Communists
keep the initiative after, heavy
losses to their most dedicated
troops?
• Does the South Vietnamese
army retain any military value?
The Communist raiders succeed
ed in their Saigon attacks on the
U.S. Embassy and elsewhere be
cause of a total failure of South
Vietnamese troops to protect the
capital. Now Thieu's army has
lost 4,000 more killed and wound
ed. Headquarters and barracks
all over the country were bat
tered by the Viet Cong. Civilians
in Saigon and Hue showed favor
itism to the Communists.
American troops were needed
to secure most of the key cities.
Without U.S. helicopters and
bombers striking urban areas,
the Communists would never
have been driven out.
Perhaps the Tet offensive ex
hausted the Communists; per
haps it meant the death-knell of
the corrupt, demoralized South
Vietnamese ar,my. A careful
watch on Vietnam this month
— separating the facts from the
propaganda — may give ths
answers.
