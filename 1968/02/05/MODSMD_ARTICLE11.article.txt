# Another Attempt
## 'Military Man' Accepts Draft 
### Herbie Hinckes 
Milton Pallid had always want
ed to go to war.
As a young lad of seven or
eight he had already developed
a collection of war toys that was
the envy of every other boy on
the block.
By age 10, he had taught him
self to march and could execute
a snappy manual of arms with
a sharp stick anytime he wanted
to.
By the time he was 12, Milton
Pallid was studying the world's
greatest military strategists.
There was no doubt about it,
the neighbors told each other,

Milton was going to be a mili
tary man. He has what it takes,
they said.
Inspirations came to him in
bits and pieces. Once while
watching a John Wayne movie,
for, instance, he suddenly de
duced that Iwo Jima would still
be in Japanese hands had it
not been for the World War II
version of the Peace Corps —
the Marine Corps.
But as he approached age 18
and his first confrontation with
his draft board, Milton became
more and more hesitant about
enlisting right away.

"Perhaps I should go to col
lege first," he told himself, "with
a degree I'll be much more valu
able to any branch of the ser
vice."
So Milton applied to the South
em Pacific Institute for Intellec
tualism, named after a great
railroad tycoon of the 19th cen
tury.
But the forces of reason and
knowledge set in and after two
or three years, Milton Pallid was
again studying war, but from a
different view point — he was
trying to prevent it.
Yes, Milton reasoned, war is
evil and must be wiped off the
face of the globe — by force, if
necessary.
Gradually Milton embarked on
a course of non-cooperation with
the government because of its
foolish actions in Vietnam, Ko
rea, the Congo, Malaysia, etc.
At first he refused to put
stamps on his letters, then he
escalated his non-cooperation. He
refused to pay parking tickets,
dog license fees, his income tax
and his social security. As his
undeclared war. with the federal
government became more vio
lent, he would occasionally spit
on Army recruiting posters, or
make obscene phone calls to his
draft board.
But his campaign did little
good, the government barely
noticed him.
Then one day he sent back his
draft card.
The government swiftly and
unmercifully retaliated by call
ing him to a pre-induction phy
sical.
"They can't do this to me," Mil
ton muttered over, and over as
he stared at his induction notice.
In fact, he was so shocked that
he meekly submitted to being
drafted and before he knew what
was happening, he was a close
cropped recruit running around
Fort Ord.
And, strangely enough, he
liked it, because:
Milton Pallid had always want
ed to go to war.
