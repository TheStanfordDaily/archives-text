## Mem Chu Stays Aware, Open 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Harvey Hukari Jr,'s state
ment in the Friday Daily pro
longs the debate about the in
tegrity of the dean of the chapel
and the uses he makes of Memo
rial Church. It seems to me that
although the differing positions
have by now been drawn, that
two more things may be said.
First, it is not the responsibili
ty of any church to bring to its
congregation the spectrum of
Christian perspective. Rather it
is the responsibility of the min
ister to preach the gospel as he
sees it. One is free to choose
one's own church.
It certainly is important that
Memorial Church be conscious
of its place in the university
community, and the dean has
constantly spoken in apprecia
tion of this fact, and of the re
sponsibilities it entails.
Secondly, it strikes me as
ironic that those who, because
of their theological and political
views have criticized the dean of
the chapel, have not heard him
preach. At least the references
to his remarks in Arena and in
Friday's Daily have been mis
guided and out of context.
The dean has never advocated
any form of political activity
from the pulpit and his integ
rity lies in the very fact that
his words and acts do not con
tradict one another. And in nei
ther does he court the favor of
students of any persuasion.
If the discussion is to contin
ue it would seem to me that the
students concerned with Dean
Napier's views take the trouble
to speak with him. There is a
time for discussion, but to make
of Sunday morning a debate is
to deprive sincere people of wor
shiping as they see fit, and
makes of religious celebration
just the political arena they wish
to condemn.

Poor Movies Corrode
Sunday Flicks Policy
Editor, The Daily:
If Rich Ware, the ASSU stu
dent financial manager, and the
staff of student police wish to
seriously continue their policy
of silence at the Sunday Flicks,
the entire program might as
well be scrapped. Harlow, shown
last Sunday, was the film which
prompted this conclusion.
Certainly in all of cinema his
tory few movies could be more
successful at inducing nausea.
Only creative and well-warrant
ed comments saved it from a
mass walk-out. With virtually
no exceptions, the remarks
were in good taste, and what
would have been one of the most
depressed audiences in theater
history left with smiles on their
faces.
Closing the balcony in an at
tempt to discourage comments
on the otherwise scintillating
dialogue proved futile. No one
was able to bear the frustration
which silence would have meant.
For those Flick audiences who
fear the destruction of good
films with too many comments,
we have only to cite Alfie as an
example. This was certainly a
good movie and the capacity au
dience responded with virtually
uninterrupted silence. However,
during such Academy Award
winners as Experiment in Ter

ror and The Braineaters, censor
ship borders on the ridiculous.
We, the undersigned, feel that
the old Flicks policy should be
reinstated. The balcony should
be reopened, and the student po
lice should once again resume
their function as aids in the case
of disaster: fire, earthquake, or
a second showing of Harlow.

Daily Petition Coverage
Editor, The Daily:
We would like to extend our
appreciation to you and The
Daily staff for the frontpage
article on our petition to Presi
dent Sterling. We were all im
pressed with the accuracy of the
article.
We have received many com
pliments from Branner residents
on the fact that our letter-peti
tion was front page news and
that the article was a fair rep
resentation of the real Branner.
There was one point in the
article which we feel can not be
stressed enough. There should
be enough coeducational resi
dences so that everyone who ap
plies for a space in a co-ed house
will be assured admittance.

Stanford Band Urges
End To Athletic Apathy
Editor, The Daily:
A recent BAND study at ma
jor athletic events confirms the
low spirit of the Stanford com
munity. Stanford has sunk, in
fact, from the apathetic spirit
it once enjoyed to the depths of
a spirited apathy!
If you have never been to a
basketball game, you should go
even if you root for Cal
(Right, Cesare?). It might be
an exciting experience.
Lot's go, Stanford! Tho BAND
cheer, HNN-N OT-BLE AH em
phasizes our, disgust. You are in
the top 2% on verbalization â€”
USE those vocal chords! Come!
Join the Band!

SES Residence Study
Shows Frat Desirability
Editor, The Daily:
The results of the SES Resi
dence Committee's study are
v< ry interesting and hopefully
the administration will continue
to make efforts to grant the
students their wish. However, I
disagree with one of the pre
sumed implications of the study.
Either, The Daily or the Resi
dence Committee seems to feel
that coed living will serve as a

termination of fraternities. On
the contrary, it seems to add
support to the male students'
satisfaction with fraternity liv
ing.
To find that only 14% of the
men now living in fraternities
prefer the highly desirable coed
living to their present living
group seems to indicate that the
overwhelming majority of fra
ternity residences desire frater
nity living.
To add to this, the finding
that fraternities were selected
as a strong second for on-campus
living, would seem to indicate
that we had better worry about
the continued existence of Toy
on, Wilbur, and Stern, all of
which were scored much lower.
