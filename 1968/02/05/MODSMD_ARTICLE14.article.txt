# Instantism Abounds
## 
### Max Lerner 
You may have seen a quote
the other day by a Chicago
broker named Robert A. Podesto
on the feverish activity on the
Stock Exchange. "My custom
ers seem to be acting like there's
no tomorrow," he said.
If this is true, it represents
a basic change in the American
national character. Americans
have always been future-mind
ed: saving for the future, plan
ning for it, oriented toward it,
dreaming of it. The usual com
plaints of foreign critics have
been that America is all future
and no past, with no such sense
of sacred, tradition-laden history
as the Europeans have.
As if to belie them, the Amer
icans built a past out of their
heroes and legends, their his
toric memories, their experience
in wars abroad and civil war at
home, their encounters with new
and strange ideas, their wrestl
ing with the national conscience.
The American sense of the past,
along with the sense of place,
seemed on the point of becom
ing as much a reality as it was
in the countries that Americans
came from.
But new and tragic splits
have developed In the inner
city, on the campus, between
the generations. If you try to
bring the experience of the
past to bear on the urgencies
of today, you are brusquely
dismissed as a conservative or
— perhaps worse — as a lib
eral.
The conviction seems to be
that there is no yesterday, and
now we must add the speculator
mentality which feels there is
no tomorrow.
Must we say then that, with

past-unusable and future-dispos
able, Americans are trying to
get along only with a present?
There is some cone of truth in
this. Not only do the young
form a "now generation," but
for all the generations the only
standard of value seems to be
a Today Ethos, unlimited in
space, but one-dimensional in
time.
It is a kind of vulgar epicure
anism: let us haste, waste and
be merry, for the past is irrele
vant and the future filmsy and
incalculable. Some might call
it an American brand of exist
entialism. But existentialism has
always possessed an intent to
transcend the immediate by liv
ing in it and a sense of the
tr,agic, neither of which I find in
the surface todayness of our
time.
I suppose one term to apply
to it would be "instantism."
The millions of people who
pick up a newspaper and turn
to the stock market quotations
as soon as they have scanned
the headlines are harmless
enough: all they want is an
Instant treasure-trove to buy
that car or dress or pay for
that vacation.
Even if they fend off any un
pleasant turn in the future, they
have enough of a stake in it to
take a stock flier for it. Their
psychology is not that of des
pair about a blank future, but
the psychology of the limitless
frontier in which every day holds
its bonanza.
There are others whose urgen
cies are of a different quality.
They want instant victory over
the enemy, instant justice, in
stant vindication of ancient

wrongs, instant power. Few of
them recognize any yesterdays;
at best they recognize only se
lective yesterdays which fit into
their instant urgencies.
The black power leaders, for
example, remember only the hu
miliation of their people in the
past. Their yesterday is a bit
terly selective one, and so their
tomorrow — like their today —
is crowded with violence.
The instantism of our time
deals ruthlessly with our leaders.
We use up everything and every
one immediately, including our
political leaders — use them for
quick buildups and just as quick
collapses, use them for sport or
for targets and throw them away
when we are through. The lack
of an heroic sense always goes
with the lack of a tragic sense.
The cult of John F. Kennedy
would seem to belie this, yet note
that the American obsession
with him today is with how
many shots were fired and how
he died ,not with what great
things he did when he was alive.
To examine President Kennedy
alive would be to embrace a
past and confront a future,
which America is unready to do.
Heroes exist only as great lit
erature exists — if there is an
historic memory and a chance
to build legends on it, to mea
sure oneself against the past
and, therefore, to 100 kforward
to judgment and vindication by
the future. But if all our yester
days have been expunged and
if there is no tomorrow, how
can we measure a man — and
how can a man measure him
self — by instant whims of to
day?

frontier in which every day holds
its bonanza.
There are others whose urgen
cies are of a different quality.
They want instant victory over
the enemy, instant justice, in
stant vindication of ancient

wrongs, instant power. Few of
them recognize any yesterdays;
at best they recognize only se
lective yesterdays which fit into
their instant urgencies.
The black power leaders, for
example, remember only the hu
miliation of their people in the
past. Their yesterday is a bit
terly selective one, and so their
tomorrow — like their today —
is crowded with violence.
The instantism of our time
deals ruthlessly with our leaders.
We use up everything and every
one immediately, including our
political leaders — use them for
quick buildups and just as quick
collapses, use them for sport or
for targets and throw them away
when we are through. The lack
of an heroic sense always goes
with the lack of a tragic sense.
The cult of John F. Kennedy
would seem to belie this, yet note
that the American obsession
with him today is with how
many shots were fired and how
he died ,not with what great
things he did when he was alive.
To examine President Kennedy
alive would be to embrace a
past and confront a future,
which America is unready to do.
Heroes exist only as great lit
erature exists — if there is an
historic memory and a chance
to build legends on it, to mea
sure oneself against the past
and, therefore, to 100 kforward
to judgment and vindication by
the future. But if all our yester
days have been expunged and
if there is no tomorrow, how
can we measure a man — and
how can a man measure him
self — by instant whims of to
day?

You may have seen a quote
the other day by a Chicago
broker named Robert A. Podesto
on the feverish activity on the
Stock Exchange. "My custom
ers seem to be acting like there's
no tomorrow," he said.
If this is true, it represents
a basic change in the American
national character. Americans
have always been future-mind
ed: saving for the future, plan
ning for it, oriented toward it,
dreaming of it. The usual com
plaints of foreign critics have
been that America is all future
and no past, with no such sense
of sacred, tradition-laden history
as the Europeans have.
As if to belie them, the Amer
icans built a past out of their
heroes and legends, their his
toric memories, their experience
in wars abroad and civil war at
home, their encounters with new
and strange ideas, their wrestl
ing with the national conscience.
The American sense of the past,
along with the sense of place,
seemed on the point of becom
ing as much a reality as it was
in the countries that Americans
came from.
But new and tragic splits
have developed In the inner
city, on the campus, between
the generations. If you try to
bring the experience of the
past to bear on the urgencies
of today, you are brusquely
dismissed as a conservative or
— perhaps worse — as a lib
eral.
The conviction seems to be
that there is no yesterday, and
now we must add the speculator
mentality which feels there is
no tomorrow.
Must we say then that, with

past-unusable and future-dispos
able, Americans are trying to
get along only with a present?
There is some cone of truth in
this. Not only do the young
form a "now generation," but
for all the generations the only
standard of value seems to be
a Today Ethos, unlimited in
space, but one-dimensional in
time.
It is a kind of vulgar epicure
anism: let us haste, waste and
be merry, for the past is irrele
vant and the future filmsy and
incalculable. Some might call
it an American brand of exist
entialism. But existentialism has
always possessed an intent to
transcend the immediate by liv
ing in it and a sense of the
tr,agic, neither of which I find in
the surface todayness of our
time.
I suppose one term to apply
to it would be "instantism."
The millions of people who
pick up a newspaper and turn
to the stock market quotations
as soon as they have scanned
the headlines are harmless
enough: all they want is an
Instant treasure-trove to buy
that car or dress or pay for
that vacation.
Even if they fend off any un
pleasant turn in the future, they
have enough of a stake in it to
take a stock flier for it. Their
psychology is not that of des
pair about a blank future, but
the psychology of the limitless
frontier in which every day holds
its bonanza.

have developed In the inner
city, on the campus, between
the generations. If you try to
bring the experience of the
past to bear on the urgencies
of today, you are brusquely
dismissed as a conservative or
— perhaps worse — as a lib
eral.
The conviction seems to be
that there is no yesterday, and
now we must add the speculator
mentality which feels there is
no tomorrow.
Must we say then that, with

past-unusable and future-dispos
able, Americans are trying to
get along only with a present?
There is some cone of truth in
this. Not only do the young
form a "now generation," but
for all the generations the only
standard of value seems to be
a Today Ethos, unlimited in
space, but one-dimensional in
time.
It is a kind of vulgar epicure
anism: let us haste, waste and
be merry, for the past is irrele
vant and the future filmsy and
incalculable. Some might call
it an American brand of exist
entialism. But existentialism has
always possessed an intent to
transcend the immediate by liv
ing in it and a sense of the
tr,agic, neither of which I find in
the surface todayness of our
time.
I suppose one term to apply
to it would be "instantism."
The millions of people who
pick up a newspaper and turn
to the stock market quotations
as soon as they have scanned
the headlines are harmless
enough: all they want is an
Instant treasure-trove to buy
that car or dress or pay for
that vacation.
Even if they fend off any un
pleasant turn in the future, they
have enough of a stake in it to
take a stock flier for it. Their
psychology is not that of des
pair about a blank future, but
the psychology of the limitless
frontier in which every day holds
its bonanza.
There are others whose urgen
cies are of a different quality.
They want instant victory over
the enemy, instant justice, in
stant vindication of ancient

wrongs, instant power. Few of
them recognize any yesterdays;
at best they recognize only se
lective yesterdays which fit into
their instant urgencies.
The black power leaders, for
example, remember only the hu
miliation of their people in the
past. Their yesterday is a bit
terly selective one, and so their
tomorrow — like their today —
is crowded with violence.
The instantism of our time
deals ruthlessly with our leaders.
We use up everything and every
one immediately, including our
political leaders — use them for
quick buildups and just as quick
collapses, use them for sport or
for targets and throw them away
when we are through. The lack
of an heroic sense always goes
with the lack of a tragic sense.
The cult of John F. Kennedy
would seem to belie this, yet note
that the American obsession
with him today is with how
many shots were fired and how
he died ,not with what great
things he did when he was alive.
To examine President Kennedy
alive would be to embrace a
past and confront a future,
which America is unready to do.
Heroes exist only as great lit
erature exists — if there is an
historic memory and a chance
to build legends on it, to mea
sure oneself against the past
and, therefore, to 100 kforward
to judgment and vindication by
the future. But if all our yester
days have been expunged and
if there is no tomorrow, how
can we measure a man — and
how can a man measure him
self — by instant whims of to
day?

You may have seen a quote
the other day by a Chicago
broker named Robert A. Podesto
on the feverish activity on the
Stock Exchange. "My custom
ers seem to be acting like there's
no tomorrow," he said.
If this is true, it represents
a basic change in the American
national character. Americans
have always been future-mind
ed: saving for the future, plan
ning for it, oriented toward it,
dreaming of it. The usual com
plaints of foreign critics have
been that America is all future
and no past, with no such sense
of sacred, tradition-laden history
as the Europeans have.
As if to belie them, the Amer
icans built a past out of their
heroes and legends, their his
toric memories, their experience
in wars abroad and civil war at
home, their encounters with new
and strange ideas, their wrestl
ing with the national conscience.
The American sense of the past,
along with the sense of place,
seemed on the point of becom
ing as much a reality as it was
in the countries that Americans
came from.
But new and tragic splits
have developed In the inner
city, on the campus, between
the generations. If you try to
bring the experience of the
past to bear on the urgencies
of today, you are brusquely
