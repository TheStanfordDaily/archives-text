## Victory Stalls Vhtnng Peace 
### Art Hoppe 
It was in the 43rd year of our
lightning campaign to wipe the
dread Viet Narian guerillas out
of West Vhtnnng. (cq) Victory
was just around the corner. For
one side or the other.
For three years we had been
bombing the bejabbers out of
the neighboring nation of East
Vhtnnng in order, as we put it,
"to force them to the peace table"
—nobody else being much inter
ested in the subject.
The mood, then, in the East
Vhtnnngian capital was grim.
And the crafty old Premier, Ho
Ho Ho, (cq) was hard put to
keep up popular enthusiasm for
the war.
"We must honor our sacred
commitments to the brave leader
of our Viet Narian allies," he
told his people firmly, "good old
Whatshisname." (cq)
"Under the Chinese Checkers
Theory," he said, "as West Vht
nnng goes, so goes whatever else
goes."
"This is time to cut and run,"
he said. "And anybody who talks
like a Nervous Nellie is giving
aid and comfort to the enemy.
Don't worry, we'll have our boys
out of the trenches by Tet. Soon
er or later."

But as the American troops
continued to advance in West

Vhtnnng, Premier Ho grew in
creasingly interested in peace.
"Of course," he said with a
fatherly smile. "No one is more
desirous of peace than I."
"I will go anywhere at any
time to talk to anyone," he added
a bit plaintively as casualties
mounted, "about peace."
"My sensitive antennae," he
said hopefully as the cost of the
war soared, "are searching quiv
eringly for a genuine peace feel
er."
"In fact," he said desperately
as the East Wing of his residence
disappeared in a cloud of smoke,
"I call up Washington every day
to say, 'Knock off this infernal
bombing and set up the peace
table—a card table will do.' But
no one ever answers."
Indeed, Premier Ho was in the
middle of a frantic nationwide
address in which he was offering
"to swim across the Pacific to
my beloved American friends
with a peace treaty in my
mouth," when an aide rushed in.
"Sir," said the aide, "our troops
have entered the West Vhtnnng
ian capital of Sag On." (cq)
"Of course," continued Pre
mier Ho blandly into a micro
phone, "it must be a durable
peace."
"And they've captured the city
of Hooey," (cq) whispered the
aide.
"And the sneaky American
fascists," continued Premier Ho
smoothly into the microphone,
"must not use a cease-fire to sup

ply their soldiers in the field."
"Plus 27 other district capi
tals," said the aide excitedly.
"Moreover, the American Presi
dent is on the phone. He says he's
got a nice peace table all set up
ringside, the best in the house."
"Tell him" said Premier Ho,
happily rubbing his hands, "that
I'm out to lunch."

And so the war dragged on.
The propitious moment for peace
never seemed to arrive — prob
ably, historians later agreed, be
cause there was never a moment
when both sides were losing at
the same time.
