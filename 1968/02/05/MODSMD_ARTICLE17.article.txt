# The 						Capitol Scene
## France Faces Strong Boycott 
### Art Buchwald 
The boycott against France in
the United States is in full
force, and people are madder at
President De Gaulle than they
are at Ho Chi Minh, Mao Tse
tung, Premier Kosygin and even
President Johnson.
At first American friends an
nounced they wouldn't visit
France while De Gaulle was
president. Then they decided
they wouldn't drink French
wine. Some of my dearest lady
friends said they wouldn't buy
French perfume and their hus
bands said they wouldn't buy
French cars. One man I know

sent back a Roquefort cheese he
had received as a present for
Christmas, and so on.
Many Americans, who can't
afford to go abroad or drink
French wines or wear French
perfumes or drive French cars,
are in a dilemma. They would
like to show their displeasure
toward President De Gaulle, but
they don't know how.

My aunt Molly seems to have
the problem licked.
"I'm not cooking any more
French fried potatoes until De
Gaulle apologizes for insulting
the United States."

"That's awfully strong medi
cine, Aunt Molly," I said.
"And I'm not making any
more French toast, either. Un
cle Phil will have to eat eggs
like everybody else."
"You'rf hitting De Gaulle
where it hurts," I said.
"And 1 told Mrs. Muggins she
couldn't come back in the bridge
club until she got rid of her
French poodle."
"I'll bet that gave her some
thing to think about."
Aunt Molly shrugged her
shoulders. "You have to do the
best you can."
"What are you doing with Un
cle Phil's shirts?" I asked her.
"I'm cutting off his French
cuffs. When I get mad I go all
the way."
No Pastry
"I see you threw out all your
French dressing," I said.
"You bet your life I did, and
you won't see any French pastry
in this house any more, either."
"It's lucky Uncle Phil doesn't
play that French horn," I told
her. "Those things can get ex
pensive."
"Who cares about expense
when the American dollar is at
stake? I threw out all my shoes
with French heels."
"But you still have French
doors between the living room
and dining room," I pointed out.
"Macy's is aware of the prob
lem and they're coming out to
morrow."
"Boy, Aunt Molly, you've cov
ered almost all the bases."
"I haven't even started. I've
taken all the French seams out
of my clothes."
"C'est la guerre," I chuckled.

"What does that mean?" she
demanded.
"It's a Freneh phrase and it
means 'that's war.' "
"Why couldn't you say it in
your native tongue?"
"I'm sorry," I apologized. "It
was a slip of the tongue. Well,
I guess I'd better take my
French leave."
"What kind of leave?"
"French leave. It's when you
sneak out without saying good
by to the hostess."
"There will be no French
leaves in my house—at least not
while De Gaulle is alive."
"Well, I do have to go, any
way. Au revoir."
"Listen," she said, "if you're
going to talk dirty you don't
have to come back here again."

The boycott against France in
the United States is in full
force, and people are madder at
President De Gaulle than they
are at Ho Chi Minh, Mao Tse
tung, Premier Kosygin and even
President Johnson.
At first American friends an
nounced they wouldn't visit
France while De Gaulle was
president. Then they decided
they wouldn't drink French
wine. Some of my dearest lady
friends said they wouldn't buy
French perfume and their hus
bands said they wouldn't buy
French cars. One man I know

sent back a Roquefort cheese he
had received as a present for
Christmas, and so on.
Many Americans, who can't
afford to go abroad or drink
French wines or wear French
perfumes or drive French cars,
are in a dilemma. They would
like to show their displeasure
toward President De Gaulle, but
they don't know how.

My aunt Molly seems to have
the problem licked.
"I'm not cooking any more
French fried potatoes until De
Gaulle apologizes for insulting
the United States."

"That's awfully strong medi
cine, Aunt Molly," I said.
"And I'm not making any
more French toast, either. Un
cle Phil will have to eat eggs
like everybody else."
"You'rf hitting De Gaulle
where it hurts," I said.
"And 1 told Mrs. Muggins she
couldn't come back in the bridge
club until she got rid of her
French poodle."
"I'll bet that gave her some
thing to think about."
Aunt Molly shrugged her
shoulders. "You have to do the
best you can."
"What are you doing with Un
cle Phil's shirts?" I asked her.
"I'm cutting off his French
cuffs. When I get mad I go all
the way."
No Pastry
"I see you threw out all your
French dressing," I said.
"You bet your life I did, and
you won't see any French pastry
in this house any more, either."
"It's lucky Uncle Phil doesn't
play that French horn," I told
her. "Those things can get ex
pensive."
"Who cares about expense
when the American dollar is at
stake? I threw out all my shoes
with French heels."
"But you still have French
doors between the living room
and dining room," I pointed out.
"Macy's is aware of the prob
lem and they're coming out to
morrow."
"Boy, Aunt Molly, you've cov
ered almost all the bases."
"I haven't even started. I've
taken all the French seams out
of my clothes."
"C'est la guerre," I chuckled.

"What does that mean?" she
demanded.
"It's a Freneh phrase and it
means 'that's war.' "
"Why couldn't you say it in
your native tongue?"
"I'm sorry," I apologized. "It
was a slip of the tongue. Well,
I guess I'd better take my
French leave."
"What kind of leave?"
"French leave. It's when you
sneak out without saying good
by to the hostess."
"There will be no French
leaves in my house—at least not
while De Gaulle is alive."
