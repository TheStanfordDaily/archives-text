# Coed Houses May Cut Frat Pledges
## 
### NICK SELBY 
Fraternities are still the most
popular housing alternative for
freshmen, but competition from
coed housing may make this
year's pledge classes smaller
than the fraternities desire.
The January housing survey
(see story page one) showed
283 freshmen males, or 32 per
cent, consider fraternities their
first choice for 1968-69. Another
52, or six per cent, want to live
off-campus with fraternity affil
iation.
This compares to 20 per cent
who listed the new demonstra
tion houses as their first choice.
A DAILY survey of frater
nity rush plans for this spring:
shows that this number may
not satisfy each house's
pledge quota.
Nearly all of the 24 fraterni-

ties said they would like to see
at least 20 frosh in their pledge
classes. The total desired by
fraternities falls somewhere be
tween 400 and 450, or close to
100 more than those who list
fraternities first.
The fraternities which are
scheduled to move into new
cluster houses in the fall indi
cated they felt especially great
pressure to get large pledge
classes. "We had only 12
pledges last year, which was
fine for our old house, but this
year we need 25 to 30 pledges,"
says Jeff Rolfing, rush chair
man of the Chi Psi house.
"We'll have to take from oth
er fraternity pledge classes to
get enough. I predict that four
or five fraternities will fold in
the next five years because
there simply aren't going to be

enough people," Rolfing con
cludes.
The Dekes had 10 pledges
last spring, but hope for 30 this
year. They say they are opti
mistic about obtaining the num
ber, as are the ATO's who are
also moving into the new clus
ter.
The fraternities must have
at least 45 members living: in
the house to break even at
University room and l>oard
rates.
Other fraternities said they
felt pressure from the idea of
more university housing alter
natives, but added that only
rush would tell how freshmen
really felt.
Delt rush chairman John de la
Forest explained, "It's one thing
to put down something on a
questionnaire, but another to re-

act to open house and meeting
upperclassmen. Opinions can
alter."
D.U. rush chairman Bob Smith
predicted that the number of
pledges this year would drop,
but indicated he was glad the
university was thinking of more
alternatives. "We want people
to choose fraternities over some
thing else," Smith said.
The largest number of fresh
men choosing fraternities came
from Wilbur Hall residents,
where 40 per cent of the 528
said fraternities were their first
choice. Exactly 77 Wilbur resi
dents listed demonstration
houses first.
The percentage dropped to
32 per cent in coed Branner
Hall, where the number of
people choosing fraternities,
33, equaled the number choos
ing demonstration houses.

Only five per cent of the 57
freshmen in demonstration
houses chose fraternities
while 82 per cent said they
wanted to continue living: in
demonstration houses.
Other results of the survey
showed that 12 per cent of the
frosh males want to live in Stern
Hall next year. Ten per cent
indicated a preference for off
campus residences with no affil
iation.
Five per cent indicated a de
sire to live in Toyon, while an
other five per cent said they
wanted to live off campus with
eating club affiliation.
Nearly 60 frosh, about seven
per cent, said they wanted to
live in Durand, an independent
men's row house, next fall.
Eight freshmen said they
wanted to live off-campus with
Stern affiliation.
