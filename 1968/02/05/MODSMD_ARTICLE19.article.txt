# Spock Scorns Vietnam Policy In S.F. Speech
## 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
Dr. Benjamin Spock yesterday
delivered a ringing indictment
of American policy in Vietnam.
Speaking in Glide Memorial
Church in San Francisco, the
famed pediatrician said he had
joined the peace movement be
cause he realized "it is only the
people who can resist this proc
ess toward war before the
whole world is destroyed."
Asked whether he would be a
candidate for the Presidency, he
replied, "I would do anything
that would be useful. Nobody
has approached me."
The standing-room-only au
dience of more than 1300 gave
the war critic a standing ova
tion both at the beginning
and end of his talk during the
11 a.m. worship service.
Spock recalled that he had
supported President Johnson in
1964, thinking that he was "the
peace candidate." He said he felt
he and the American people had
been "betrayed" by the Presi
dent.
Enumerating his reasons for
opposition to the war, he said
the United States had first en
tered Vietnam "in a power grab
to try to fill a power vacuum
left by the defeat of the French."
He attributed the power grab,
in part, to the realization by the
U.S. that free elections would
have chosen Ho Chi Minh to
lead the country by an over
whelming majority. The author
of this intervention, according
to Spock, was the late John
Foster Dulles, then Secretary of
State.
The noted doctor called the
war "illegal, immoral, and a
detriment In every way to the
welfare of the United States."
He said the U.S. Ls commit
ting "crimes against humani
ty" In Its prosecution of the
war.
Specifically, he referred to the
deliberate killing of crops and
the use of what he called "poi
sonous gases." The deliberate
destruction of many homes and
residential areas in North Viet
nam and the use of "shredded
steel sliver bombs designed ...
to tear flesh off bones" were
other examples of the accused
crimes.
He charged the President and
the Secretaries of State and
Defense with "misleading the
American people right from the
beginning ... about the cause of
the war."
Spock said we are fighting
the war "for the absentee land
lords, the army officers and the
profiteers." He also said the
government has lied about its
desire for negotiations.
Spock noted that many of the
President's chief advisors on the
war are "academicians at a dis
tinguished level." He referred
to the "Rostow brothers and the
Bundy brothers" as such schol
ars.
Citing Plato's ideal of the in
tellectual elite, Spock said "God
deliver us from the intellectual
in America. I would prefer a
man who was a little bit stupid
and had the milk of human
kindness in him."
He attributed Great Brit
ain's support of our Vietnam
policy to the fact that "for
practical purposes the United
States has a mortgage on
Great Britain, and Lyndon
Johnson has indicated to
Prime Minister Wilson that if
he ever speaks up against our
policy that Lyndon Johnson
will pull the rug out from un
der him."
Spock's advice to other war
protestors was that "we go on

with the things we have done
in the past." He said that the
ineffectiveness thus far of the
peace movement is a reason
"for redoubling, quadroupling
our efforts."
He said "political activity is
particularly important," and
suggested that either Gen. Gav
in or Sen. Percy would be de
serving of Republican support.
As a note of encouragement
to Democrats disappointed that
"McCarthy has turned out not
to be a ball of fire," he said.
"McCarthy never was a ball of
fire. We must be thankful one
Senator dared to stand up and
defy Lyndon Johnson."
Spock commented, that the
reason he has encouraged
draft evasion is that '1 am
not sure that there is going
to be any United States by
the fall of 1968" when the nor
mal democratic process would
have a chance to act
He called the draft resisters
who endanger their future ca
reers "the greatest patriots in
the United States."
Spock said the recent indict
ment of seven Bay Area youths
for their part in anti-draft dem
onstrations was evidence that
the government "is trying with
increased vehemence to supress
resistance."
He concluded by saying that
he and the others indicted "do
not consider ourselves guilty.
We have already pleaded not
guilty because we believe that
the Johnson administration is
threatening destruction of the
United States by carrying on
this illegal, immoral and un
winnable war."
In a press conference after
wards, Spock was asked his
view on the Pueblo crisis.
He replied, "Before you could
make up your mind, you would
have to know the actual facts,
and I don't know whether we
ever will know the actual facts,
whether the Pueblo was inside
the territorial waters of North
Korea."
"Many of us in the peace
movement," he went on, "won
der whether our government
was being deliberately provoca
tive to have an episode that
would be a coverup to calling
up the air reserves."

I)R. BKNJAMIN SPOCK, speaking in San Francisco yesterday.
Dr. Benjamin Spock yesterday
delivered a ringing indictment
of American policy in Vietnam.
Speaking in Glide Memorial
Church in San Francisco, the
famed pediatrician said he had
joined the peace movement be
cause he realized "it is only the
people who can resist this proc
ess toward war before the
whole world is destroyed."
Asked whether he would be a
candidate for the Presidency, he
replied, "I would do anything
that would be useful. Nobody
has approached me."
The standing-room-only au
dience of more than 1300 gave
the war critic a standing ova
tion both at the beginning
and end of his talk during the
11 a.m. worship service.
Spock recalled that he had
supported President Johnson in
1964, thinking that he was "the
peace candidate." He said he felt
he and the American people had
been "betrayed" by the Presi
dent.
Enumerating his reasons for
opposition to the war, he said
the United States had first en
tered Vietnam "in a power grab
to try to fill a power vacuum
left by the defeat of the French."
He attributed the power grab,
in part, to the realization by the
U.S. that free elections would
have chosen Ho Chi Minh to
lead the country by an over
whelming majority. The author
of this intervention, according
to Spock, was the late John
Foster Dulles, then Secretary of
State.
The noted doctor called the
war "illegal, immoral, and a
detriment In every way to the
welfare of the United States."
He said the U.S. Ls commit
ting "crimes against humani
ty" In Its prosecution of the
war.
Specifically, he referred to the
deliberate killing of crops and
the use of what he called "poi
sonous gases." The deliberate
destruction of many homes and
residential areas in North Viet
nam and the use of "shredded
steel sliver bombs designed ...
to tear flesh off bones" were
other examples of the accused
crimes.
He charged the President and
the Secretaries of State and
Defense with "misleading the
American people right from the
beginning ... about the cause of
the war."
Spock said we are fighting
the war "for the absentee land
lords, the army officers and the
profiteers." He also said the
government has lied about its
desire for negotiations.
Spock noted that many of the
President's chief advisors on the
war are "academicians at a dis
tinguished level." He referred
to the "Rostow brothers and the
Bundy brothers" as such schol
ars.
Citing Plato's ideal of the in
tellectual elite, Spock said "God
deliver us from the intellectual
in America. I would prefer a
man who was a little bit stupid
and had the milk of human
kindness in him."
He attributed Great Brit
ain's support of our Vietnam
policy to the fact that "for
practical purposes the United
States has a mortgage on
Great Britain, and Lyndon
Johnson has indicated to
Prime Minister Wilson that if
he ever speaks up against our
policy that Lyndon Johnson
will pull the rug out from un
der him."
Spock's advice to other war
protestors was that "we go on

with the things we have done
in the past." He said that the
ineffectiveness thus far of the
peace movement is a reason
"for redoubling, quadroupling
our efforts."
He said "political activity is
particularly important," and
suggested that either Gen. Gav
in or Sen. Percy would be de
serving of Republican support.
As a note of encouragement
to Democrats disappointed that
"McCarthy has turned out not
to be a ball of fire," he said.
"McCarthy never was a ball of
fire. We must be thankful one
Senator dared to stand up and
defy Lyndon Johnson."
Spock commented, that the
reason he has encouraged
draft evasion is that '1 am
not sure that there is going
to be any United States by
the fall of 1968" when the nor
mal democratic process would
have a chance to act
He called the draft resisters
who endanger their future ca
reers "the greatest patriots in
the United States."
Spock said the recent indict
ment of seven Bay Area youths
for their part in anti-draft dem
onstrations was evidence that
the government "is trying with
increased vehemence to supress
resistance."
He concluded by saying that
he and the others indicted "do
not consider ourselves guilty.
We have already pleaded not
guilty because we believe that
the Johnson administration is
threatening destruction of the
United States by carrying on
this illegal, immoral and un
winnable war."
In a press conference after
wards, Spock was asked his
view on the Pueblo crisis.
He replied, "Before you could
make up your mind, you would
have to know the actual facts,
and I don't know whether we
ever will know the actual facts,
whether the Pueblo was inside
the territorial waters of North
Korea."
"Many of us in the peace
movement," he went on, "won
der whether our government
was being deliberately provoca
tive to have an episode that
would be a coverup to calling
up the air reserves."

have to know the actual facts,
and I don't know whether we
ever will know the actual facts,
whether the Pueblo was inside
the territorial waters of North
Korea."
"Many of us in the peace
movement," he went on, "won

I)R. BKNJAMIN SPOCK, speaking in San Francisco yesterday.
Dr. Benjamin Spock yesterday
delivered a ringing indictment
of American policy in Vietnam.
Speaking in Glide Memorial
Church in San Francisco, the
famed pediatrician said he had
joined the peace movement be
cause he realized "it is only the
people who can resist this proc
ess toward war before the
whole world is destroyed."
Asked whether he would be a
candidate for the Presidency, he
replied, "I would do anything
that would be useful. Nobody
has approached me."
The standing-room-only au
dience of more than 1300 gave
the war critic a standing ova
tion both at the beginning
and end of his talk during the
11 a.m. worship service.
Spock recalled that he had
supported President Johnson in
1964, thinking that he was "the
peace candidate." He said he felt
he and the American people had
been "betrayed" by the Presi
dent.
Enumerating his reasons for
opposition to the war, he said
the United States had first en
tered Vietnam "in a power grab
to try to fill a power vacuum
left by the defeat of the French."
He attributed the power grab,
in part, to the realization by the
U.S. that free elections would
have chosen Ho Chi Minh to
lead the country by an over
whelming majority. The author
of this intervention, according
to Spock, was the late John
Foster Dulles, then Secretary of
State.
The noted doctor called the
war "illegal, immoral, and a
detriment In every way to the
welfare of the United States."
He said the U.S. Ls commit
ting "crimes against humani
ty" In Its prosecution of the
war.
Specifically, he referred to the
deliberate killing of crops and
the use of what he called "poi
sonous gases." The deliberate
destruction of many homes and
residential areas in North Viet
nam and the use of "shredded
steel sliver bombs designed ...
to tear flesh off bones" were
other examples of the accused
crimes.
He charged the President and
the Secretaries of State and
Defense with "misleading the
American people right from the
beginning ... about the cause of
the war."
Spock said we are fighting
the war "for the absentee land
lords, the army officers and the
profiteers." He also said the
government has lied about its
desire for negotiations.
Spock noted that many of the
President's chief advisors on the
war are "academicians at a dis
tinguished level." He referred
to the "Rostow brothers and the
Bundy brothers" as such schol
ars.
Citing Plato's ideal of the in
tellectual elite, Spock said "God
deliver us from the intellectual
in America. I would prefer a
man who was a little bit stupid
and had the milk of human
kindness in him."
He attributed Great Brit
ain's support of our Vietnam
policy to the fact that "for
practical purposes the United
States has a mortgage on
Great Britain, and Lyndon
Johnson has indicated to
Prime Minister Wilson that if
he ever speaks up against our
policy that Lyndon Johnson
will pull the rug out from un
der him."
Spock's advice to other war
protestors was that "we go on

with the things we have done
in the past." He said that the
ineffectiveness thus far of the
peace movement is a reason
"for redoubling, quadroupling
our efforts."
He said "political activity is
particularly important," and
suggested that either Gen. Gav
in or Sen. Percy would be de
serving of Republican support.
As a note of encouragement
to Democrats disappointed that
"McCarthy has turned out not
to be a ball of fire," he said.
"McCarthy never was a ball of
fire. We must be thankful one
Senator dared to stand up and
defy Lyndon Johnson."
Spock commented, that the
reason he has encouraged
draft evasion is that '1 am
not sure that there is going
to be any United States by
the fall of 1968" when the nor
mal democratic process would
have a chance to act
He called the draft resisters
who endanger their future ca
reers "the greatest patriots in
the United States."
Spock said the recent indict
ment of seven Bay Area youths
for their part in anti-draft dem
onstrations was evidence that
the government "is trying with
increased vehemence to supress
resistance."
He concluded by saying that
he and the others indicted "do
not consider ourselves guilty.
We have already pleaded not
guilty because we believe that
the Johnson administration is
threatening destruction of the
United States by carrying on
this illegal, immoral and un
winnable war."
In a press conference after
wards, Spock was asked his
view on the Pueblo crisis.
He replied, "Before you could
make up your mind, you would
have to know the actual facts,
and I don't know whether we
ever will know the actual facts,
whether the Pueblo was inside
the territorial waters of North
Korea."
"Many of us in the peace
movement," he went on, "won
der whether our government
was being deliberately provoca
tive to have an episode that
would be a coverup to calling
up the air reserves."
