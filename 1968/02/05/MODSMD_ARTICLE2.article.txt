# Annual Greek Week Takes On New Image
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
From out of the clusters, from
houses on Lasuen and Mayfield
and elsewhere they will come.
It's Greek Week, and time for
the fraternities' annual round
of fun and games.
Only this year, it's more than
just fun and games.
"We're trying to have a
greater variety of things to
do," said Greek Week chair
man John Kidde, a Delta Up
silon member. "We're trying
to open it up more to get
more house participation, con
structive as well as just to
start off rush."
In trying to give Greek Week
a new image, projects such as
a book drive, guest speakers in
various houses, and having
former Supreme Court Justice
Tom Clark as guest-in-residence
have been added to the usual
fare of a chariot race, the
Queens' Games, and the IFC
Ball.
The first event on the sched
ule is the traditional chariot
race in White Plaza. This yearly
spectacular will take place to
morrow at 11:45 a.m.
Two men from each of the
fraternities competing in the
event will pull their house's

entry from the Bookstore to
Tresidder Union. And a coed
will grace each chariot as it
hurtles toward the finish line.
Points will be awarded to the
best three groups in two areas,
speed and humor. These points,
along with those given out for
other activities, will go toward
the selection of the Greek Week
Queen.
The fraternity which has
piled up the highest score in
the various competitions will
have the honor of having its
House Queen selected as
queen of Greek Week.
On Friday, the next major
event, the Queens' Games, will
be hold. Three-legged races, beer
chugging contest, and possibly
a dance contest will be featured.
Previously held at Searsville
Lake, the Queens' Games will
bo at Huddart Park in Woodside
this year, starting at 3:30 p.m.
The change was made because
the Searsville manager wanted
to charge $1.25 per person this
year. "Which is ridiculous,"
Kidde said.
While all this fun and frivol
ity is going on, Dennis Lock
hart of Zeta Psi will be running
a book drive. Old tomes will be
collected from the various

houses and distributed to wor
thy organizations.
This book collection is part of
the new look of Greek Week.
The idea, according to Kidde, is
to have "some houses who
would not like to participate ill
some facet of Greek Week but
would like to do something, like
community work" join in the
activity.
The traditional events con
clude with the IFC Ball Satur
day night In Longshoreman's
Hall in San Francisco.
More points toward the selec
tion of the Queen will be
awarded at the Ball. At 10:30,
a head count will be made, and
the fraternities ranked by the
percentage of members present,
with the top three gaining
points.
At 11:30, the Queen and the
two princesses of Greek Week
will be announced.
The Greek Week festivities
will continue for longer than
normal this year. Former Su
preme Court Justice Tom Clark
will be an IFC guest-in-residence
on Feb. 14 and 15.
He will speak at the Delta
Upsilon house after dinner on
Feb. 14 and at Sigma Alpha
Epsilon the following evening.
"His visit will actually be
part of the Greek Week pro
gram," Kidde said, "although
he will be here a week later.
It's unfortunate we couldn't
get him to come before."
Kidde also invited several U.S.
senators to be guests-in-resi
dence, but all of those asked
declined.
He said that having such
people here, in the fraternities,
during Greek Week "was an
other way we hoped to change
the atmosphere" of the week.
Several houses, in keeping
with the new spirit, are plan
ning special events. Some of
these are a speech by a former
Peace Corps member at Delta
Upsilon tomorrow night, a talk
by Dean of the Chapel B. Davie

Napier at Zeta Psi on Wednes
day evening, and a project by
Alpha Delta Phi to give a group
of crippled children an outing.
This is part of the diversity
that Kidde has pushed for this
year.
"In the past, Greek Week
has more or less been a couple
of fun and games projects
for fraternities," he said.
"This is why this year we're
placing a gTeater emphasis on
having more houses partici
pate in areas they would like
to."
He also noted that the IFC
had asked President Sterling to
have dinner with the house
presidents and IFC officers dur
ing the week but Sterling was
unable to attend.
They were told, however, that
an informal meeting some time
before Washington's Birthday
was highly likely.

a dance contest will be featured.
Previously held at Searsville
Lake, the Queens' Games will
bo at Huddart Park in Woodside
this year, starting at 3:30 p.m.
The change was made because
the Searsville manager wanted
to charge $1.25 per person this
year. "Which is ridiculous,"
Kidde said.
While all this fun and frivol
ity is going on, Dennis Lock
hart of Zeta Psi will be running
a book drive. Old tomes will be
collected from the various

houses and distributed to wor
thy organizations.
This book collection is part of
the new look of Greek Week.
The idea, according to Kidde, is
to have "some houses who
would not like to participate ill
some facet of Greek Week but
would like to do something, like
community work" join in the
activity.
The traditional events con
clude with the IFC Ball Satur
day night In Longshoreman's
Hall in San Francisco.
More points toward the selec
tion of the Queen will be
awarded at the Ball. At 10:30,
a head count will be made, and
the fraternities ranked by the
percentage of members present,
with the top three gaining
points.
At 11:30, the Queen and the
two princesses of Greek Week
will be announced.
The Greek Week festivities
will continue for longer than
normal this year. Former Su
preme Court Justice Tom Clark
will be an IFC guest-in-residence
on Feb. 14 and 15.
He will speak at the Delta
Upsilon house after dinner on
Feb. 14 and at Sigma Alpha
Epsilon the following evening.
"His visit will actually be
part of the Greek Week pro
gram," Kidde said, "although
he will be here a week later.
It's unfortunate we couldn't
get him to come before."
Kidde also invited several U.S.
senators to be guests-in-resi
dence, but all of those asked
declined.
He said that having such
people here, in the fraternities,
during Greek Week "was an
other way we hoped to change
the atmosphere" of the week.
Several houses, in keeping
with the new spirit, are plan
ning special events. Some of
these are a speech by a former
Peace Corps member at Delta
Upsilon tomorrow night, a talk
by Dean of the Chapel B. Davie

Napier at Zeta Psi on Wednes
day evening, and a project by
Alpha Delta Phi to give a group
of crippled children an outing.
This is part of the diversity
that Kidde has pushed for this
year.
"In the past, Greek Week
has more or less been a couple
of fun and games projects
for fraternities," he said.
"This is why this year we're
placing a gTeater emphasis on
having more houses partici
pate in areas they would like
to."
He also noted that the IFC
had asked President Sterling to
have dinner with the house
presidents and IFC officers dur
ing the week but Sterling was
unable to attend.
They were told, however, that
an informal meeting some time
before Washington's Birthday
was highly likely.
From out of the clusters, from
houses on Lasuen and Mayfield
and elsewhere they will come.
It's Greek Week, and time for
the fraternities' annual round
of fun and games.
Only this year, it's more than
just fun and games.
"We're trying to have a
greater variety of things to
do," said Greek Week chair
man John Kidde, a Delta Up
silon member. "We're trying
to open it up more to get
more house participation, con
structive as well as just to
start off rush."
In trying to give Greek Week
a new image, projects such as
a book drive, guest speakers in
various houses, and having
former Supreme Court Justice
Tom Clark as guest-in-residence
have been added to the usual
fare of a chariot race, the
Queens' Games, and the IFC
Ball.
The first event on the sched
ule is the traditional chariot
race in White Plaza. This yearly
spectacular will take place to
morrow at 11:45 a.m.
Two men from each of the
fraternities competing in the
event will pull their house's

entry from the Bookstore to
Tresidder Union. And a coed
will grace each chariot as it
hurtles toward the finish line.
Points will be awarded to the
best three groups in two areas,
speed and humor. These points,
along with those given out for
other activities, will go toward
the selection of the Greek Week
Queen.
The fraternity which has
piled up the highest score in
the various competitions will
have the honor of having its
House Queen selected as
queen of Greek Week.
On Friday, the next major
event, the Queens' Games, will
be hold. Three-legged races, beer
chugging contest, and possibly
a dance contest will be featured.

It's unfortunate we couldn't
get him to come before."
Kidde also invited several U.S.
senators to be guests-in-resi
dence, but all of those asked
declined.
He said that having such
people here, in the fraternities,
during Greek Week "was an
other way we hoped to change
the atmosphere" of the week.
Several houses, in keeping
with the new spirit, are plan
ning special events. Some of
these are a speech by a former
Peace Corps member at Delta
Upsilon tomorrow night, a talk
by Dean of the Chapel B. Davie

Napier at Zeta Psi on Wednes
day evening, and a project by
Alpha Delta Phi to give a group
of crippled children an outing.
This is part of the diversity
that Kidde has pushed for this
year.
"In the past, Greek Week
has more or less been a couple
of fun and games projects
for fraternities," he said.
"This is why this year we're
placing a gTeater emphasis on
having more houses partici
pate in areas they would like
to."
He also noted that the IFC
had asked President Sterling to
have dinner with the house
presidents and IFC officers dur
ing the week but Sterling was
unable to attend.
They were told, however, that
an informal meeting some time
before Washington's Birthday
was highly likely.
From out of the clusters, from
houses on Lasuen and Mayfield
and elsewhere they will come.
It's Greek Week, and time for
the fraternities' annual round
of fun and games.
Only this year, it's more than
just fun and games.
"We're trying to have a
greater variety of things to
do," said Greek Week chair
man John Kidde, a Delta Up
silon member. "We're trying
to open it up more to get
more house participation, con
structive as well as just to
start off rush."
In trying to give Greek Week
a new image, projects such as
a book drive, guest speakers in
various houses, and having
former Supreme Court Justice
Tom Clark as guest-in-residence
have been added to the usual
fare of a chariot race, the
Queens' Games, and the IFC
Ball.
The first event on the sched
ule is the traditional chariot
race in White Plaza. This yearly
spectacular will take place to
morrow at 11:45 a.m.
Two men from each of the
fraternities competing in the
event will pull their house's

entry from the Bookstore to
Tresidder Union. And a coed
will grace each chariot as it
hurtles toward the finish line.
Points will be awarded to the
best three groups in two areas,
speed and humor. These points,
along with those given out for
other activities, will go toward
the selection of the Greek Week
Queen.
The fraternity which has
piled up the highest score in
the various competitions will
have the honor of having its
House Queen selected as
queen of Greek Week.
On Friday, the next major
event, the Queens' Games, will
be hold. Three-legged races, beer
chugging contest, and possibly
a dance contest will be featured.
Previously held at Searsville
Lake, the Queens' Games will
bo at Huddart Park in Woodside
this year, starting at 3:30 p.m.
The change was made because
the Searsville manager wanted
to charge $1.25 per person this
year. "Which is ridiculous,"
Kidde said.
While all this fun and frivol
ity is going on, Dennis Lock
hart of Zeta Psi will be running
a book drive. Old tomes will be
collected from the various

houses and distributed to wor
thy organizations.
This book collection is part of
the new look of Greek Week.
The idea, according to Kidde, is
to have "some houses who
would not like to participate ill
some facet of Greek Week but
would like to do something, like
community work" join in the
activity.
The traditional events con
clude with the IFC Ball Satur
day night In Longshoreman's
Hall in San Francisco.
More points toward the selec
tion of the Queen will be
awarded at the Ball. At 10:30,
a head count will be made, and
the fraternities ranked by the
percentage of members present,
with the top three gaining
points.
At 11:30, the Queen and the
two princesses of Greek Week
will be announced.
The Greek Week festivities
will continue for longer than
normal this year. Former Su
preme Court Justice Tom Clark
will be an IFC guest-in-residence
on Feb. 14 and 15.
He will speak at the Delta
Upsilon house after dinner on
Feb. 14 and at Sigma Alpha
Epsilon the following evening.
"His visit will actually be
part of the Greek Week pro
gram," Kidde said, "although
he will be here a week later.
It's unfortunate we couldn't
get him to come before."
