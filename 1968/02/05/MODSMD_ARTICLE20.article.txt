### 
Professor Eric Voegelin, prom
inent philosopher and political
scientist, has been named the
first Henry Salvatori Distin
guished Scholar at Stanford's
Hoover Institution.
Voegelin currently holds the
Max Weber chair in political
science at the University of Mu
nich (Germany) and directs the
University's Institute of Polit
ical Science, which he founded
in 1958.
The noted scholar's new ap

made possible by a gift to the
Institution from Henry Salva
tori of Los Angeles, founder of
Western Geophysical Co. Salva
tori retired as chief executive
officer of the company, now a
division of Litton Industries, on
Oct. 1, 1967.
The grant by Mr. Salvatori
totals $250,000 over five years.
Announcing the appoint
ment, Institution director
Glenn Campbell said that
"Prof. Voegclin's profundity
and his erudition meet not
only the challenge of Mr. Sal
vatori's generous proposal
but also a prime concern of
the Institution's founder, Her
bert Hoover.
"In his address dedicating the

Hoover Tower in June of 1941,
Mr. Hoover declared that hu
manity must not 'abandon the
lessons of its own experience.'
"A teaching of Prof. Voegel
in's work and method is that we
must search history—the record
of our experiences as men— to
discover the foundations for a
well-oi,dered society.
"The government that springs
from such an order, he has
written, will then be founded in
reality and not upon desire or
imagination."
Dr. Voegelin received the
doctorate from the Univesity
of Vienna in 1922, and did
postgraduate work at Oxford,
Berlin, Heidelberg, the Sor
bonne, Columbia. Harvard,
Wisconsin, and Yale. He im
migrated to the U.S. in the
mid 1930'5, and taught at Har
vard before accepting an ap
pointment at Ixniisiana State,
where he subsequently be
came Boyd professor of gov
ernment.
During his nearly 20 years at
LSU, he served as visiting pro
fessor or lecturer at Harvard,
Yale, Northwestern, and the
University of Chicago.
In 1958 he was named Max i
Weber professor of political
science at Munich.
