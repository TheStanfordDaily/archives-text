# 12-0 Trouncing
## BART Hands Ruggers First Setback 
### 
The Stanford rugby team tast
ed defeat for the first time yes
terday, falling to the Bay Area
Rugby Team (BART) by the
score of 12-0.
BART, formerly known as the
Olympic Club, had just returned
from a fifteen game European
tour, and their, advantage in ex
perience was obvious. Stanford
was outplayed all the way
around, especially in the run
ning and kicking of the backs.
Coach Pete Kmetovic com
mented, "We got the ball from
the line-outs and scrums as often
as they did, but they played
much better when they got it."
Backs Overlap
BART backs were often able
to overlap on their Stanford
counterparts (i.e., get a one or
two-man advantage on the de
fense as they ran sweeps.)
BART ran up a 6-0 halftime
lead by virtue of two trjes. Tom
Blanchfield scored first for the
visitors as he hit paydirt after
a short kick and pass from a
teammate. However, the Olym
pians failed to convert, as they
did on the second try scored
later in the half.
Tribe Threatens
The Tribe treatened a couple
of times in the second half, but
just couldn't score against the
tough and experienced BART de
fense. The visitors added a third
try and a final penalty kick to
ice their convincing victory.
The personal duel between
Blaine Nye and Lauren Hawley
turned out about evenly. Neither
dominated the line-outs as much
as they have been used to, un
doubtedly due to the presence
of each other.
Stanford sorely missed the ser

vices of Dick Ragsdale and Ray
Wilson, both injured. And at
least four Indians had to race to
the game after taking their Biz
Boards, which ended just before
game time.
Leon Hartvickson and Mike
Forster played their usual solid
games.
Seconds, Thirds Triumph
Not all was lost, however, as
the second team trounced pre
viously undeveated Santa Clara
14-0, and the third team rolled
over the Santa Clara second
stringers, 6-0.
Kmetovic was pleased with the
play of John Huss and Bob Stahl,
each of whom scored tries. Mike
Bond added eight points with
two penalty kicks and a conver
sion.
The thirds were led by the
fine ball handling and r.unning
of Steve Bendick. Doug Logan
kept the fans alert with sev
eral sexy fakes from his full
back position.
Next weekend, Pacific Eight
action starts as Stanford meets
USC at Stanford.


FLY, HALF â€” Stanford scrum half Dave Evans picks up some yardage against the Bay Area Rug
by Team Saturday. Following the action are Gene MofTet (70), Eric SutclifTe (27), and Bernie
Bays (58).
The Tribe lost to the big and experienced BART 12-0. They had just returned from a 15 game
European tour, In which they won eight games against some of the best teams In the world. Next
Saturday the ruggers take on USC here at Stanford.
