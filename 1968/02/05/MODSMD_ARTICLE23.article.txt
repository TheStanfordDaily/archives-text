By DAVE NOLAND

Stanford wrestlers won four
individual championships Satur
day at the San Francisco State
Invitational Meet, but a lack of
team depth relegated the Tribe
to a third place finish behind
San Francisco State and Cal
Poly (San Luis Obispo).
Len Borchers, Bud Holling
bery, Ter,ry Crenshaw, and Ben
Shaver all won their weight divi
sions in the ten-team tourna
ment.
SFS Depth
SF State placed in every one
of the eleven classes to score its
winning 92-point total. Stanford

took only eight men to the meet,
and six finished in the final four.
The Tribe notched 66 points, to
Cal Poly's 74.
In the 160 lb. class, Len Bor
chers continued his winning ways
with a convincing 8-2 decision.
Holingberry took the 167 lb. divi
sion championship just as easily
with a 9-1 win in the finals.
Crenshaw Pins
Co-captain' Terry Crenshaw
was named the meet's outstand
ing wrestler for. his performance
in the 191 lb. class. Crenshaw,
who finished fourth in last year's
NCAA championships, waltzed
through the preliminary match

es and then pinned his man in
the final.
Heavyweight Ben Shaver re
venged Wednesday's loss to SF
State's Rupert Powell by beat
ing him in the finals to take the
heavyweight division. Shaver
wrenched the 310 pound Powell's
knee and won by default when
Powell withdrew. Shaver was
leading 3-0 at the time.
Bill Vogelpohl grabbed a sec
ond place finish in the 152 lb. divi
sion, losing 4-2 in the final. Vogel
pohl pulled a bicep in his arm
and his status for the next meet
is still questionable.
Tom Hazelton also earned
points in the meet with a fourth
place finish in the 123 lb. class.
