# Cagers Split A Pair

### GARY CAVALLI 
It was a weekend of both joy
and heartbreak for Stanford's
basketball team, as the Tribe
squeaked by Denver 84-82 Fri
day night, but dropped a 55-53
thriller to the Air Force Satur
day.
Had the Indians clipped the
Falcons Saturday, it would've
given them an 8-8 mark for the
year. As it was, they came
awfully close.
Steve Halligan's 15-foot jump
er knotted it at 53-53 with a
little more than two minutes
left. After forcing an Air Force
turnover with 1:41 to go, the
Indians stalled for what they
thought would be the final shot.
Tribe mentor Howie T)allmar
called time out with 14 seconds
left to set up a play. Five sec
onds showed on the clock when
Gary Petersmeyer put up a
jumper from the top of the key.
The ball bounded off the rim
and straight into Falcon Mark
Bean's waiting hands. Bean
turned and fired to teammate
Bert Spear, as the last seconds
ticked away.
Spear whirled and let loose a
35-foot desperation heave a sec
ond before the buzzer. The ball
arched high and swished
straight through the basket,
disturbing the cords. The Air
Force crowd exploded.
The game was an even contest

from start to finish, with the
lead changing hands over a
dozen times. The Air Force un
veiled a 1-3-1 zone defense, but
it didn't phase the Indians.
Sharp, quick passing enabled
Stanford to penetrate the zone,
and the team left the floor at
halftime deadlocked 32-32.
Throughout the final 20 min
utes of play, neither team led
by more than six points. By con
centrating on deliberately set
ting up their offensive patterns,
the Indian quintet held a four
point lead throughout much of
the second half.
A series of Stanford ball
handling miscues, plus some hot
shooting by Greg Thiessen and
Bean enabled the Falcons to
overtake the Tribe and grab a
53-51 lead. At that point Halli
gan hit his jumper, and two
minutes later Spear wafted in
his game-winner.
Harris Loads
Art Harris, Mai McElwain
and Petersmeyer provided the
offensive punch for Stanford.
Harris led the way with 21
points, matching his season's
average, while McElwain and
Petersmeyer had 10 apiece.
The Falcons got a 16-point
performance from 6-10 center
Cliff Parsons, who buried 34
against Cal the previous eve
ning, plus 15 from Thiessen and
10 from Bean.
Friday night the Tribe's bal

anced scoring turned the tide
in a foul-studded contest at Den
ver. Four starters hit in double
figures for Stanford to offset
a great 30-point performance by
Denver's Harry Hollines.
Hollines burried 20 in the first
half to keep Denver in the ball
game. The Indians threatened
to break it open several times,
but were hampered by their ex
cessive fouling. Pivotmen Mc-
Elwain and Kuchenbecker were
both forced to the bench with
four fouls, but Stanford took a
43-41 lead into the dressing
room at halftime.
The Tribe held the whip hand
throughout the second half, but
sporadic hot spells by Hollines,
Horace Kearney, and 6-10 pivot
man Brian Claire kept Denver
within striking distance.
Foul Trouble
Both McElwain and Kuchen
becker fouled out in the closing
minutes, and once again the
Pioneers attempted to narrow
the gap. Harris, Petersmeyer,
and Griffin all netted important
hoops for Stanford in the wan
ing minutes, as the Tribe held
on for an 84-82 win. Two bas
kets by Denver just before the
final horn made the final score
deceiving.
As usual, Harris led the scor
ing parade with 18. The speedy
Petersmeyer was one behind at
17, while McElwain and Griffin
meshed 14 each.
