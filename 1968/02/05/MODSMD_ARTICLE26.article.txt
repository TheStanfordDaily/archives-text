# Allen Paces Bruins' Victory Over Ailing Tribe Gymnasts
## 
### BOB RUND 
Stanford's injury-riddled gym
nastics team lost to an outstand
ing UCLA squad and beat the
University of Nevada Friday,
and was edged out by Sacramen
to State in a heartbreaker on
Saturday. The Tribe's Saturday
score of 150.65 was the highest
of the year.
An unusually large crowd
turned out to watch Kanati Allen
and his UCLA gymnastics team
scissor, somersault, vault, and
tumble their way to a smashing
179.00 to 143.35 victory over the
Indians Friday night.
The Tribe gymnasts, who were
hampered by injuries and colds,
still managed to defeat a Uni
versity of Nevada team that
scored only 103.05.
Dixon Hurt
Stanford probably would have
scored their highest total of the
year if Dickson had been able
to compete in all six of his reg
ular events. Dickson withdrew
from the Floor Exercise and
Long Horse because of a weak
ankle.
Allen, who was somewhat off
his best form, managed to score
52.10 for the match. He semed
to lack the strength needed to
execute the more difficult moves
in many of his routines.
However, any disappointment
one might have had about the
rest of Allen's performances was
overcome in the final event, the
horizontal bar. Allen, who finish
ed second in the world games in
this event, executed a fantastic
and beautiful series of front and
reverse giants, straddle in strad
dle outs, circle to casts, and an
excellent straddle off dismount.
His scor,e for the Horizontal
bar was a 9.4, by far the best
scoring performance of the meet.
Rochell Sparkles
The performance that sparked
the most response from the par
tisan audience was Stanford
frosh Steve Roehell's exhibi
tion on the rings. Although his
performance was not scored by
the judges, it was at least as
good if not better than the win
ning ring performance by
UCLA's Larry Basset who scor
ed 9.25.
The Tribe's Jim Snyder scor
ed a life-time best in the Long

Horse and a season best in the
parallfl bars with scores of 8.7
and 8.35 respectively.
Dickson also came through
with two season bests with im
provements in th * horizontal
and parallel bars. Other Indian
gymnasts besides Snyder and
Dickson who scored season bests
were Rich Guess on the trampo
line and John Marks on the par
allel bans.
The Bruins were strong in
every event and the sidehorse
was no exception with Richard
Muff executing an almost flaw
less routine for a 9.1 rating.
Honeymooner
Coach John Gilmore described
Saturday's 152.25 to 150.65 loss
to Sac State as "a battle of in
jured troops." Jim Snyder join
ed Dickson on the injured list
and was unable to perform.
Sac State's number, one all
arounder Steve Plean had just

gotten back from his honeymoon
and was not up to his usual
standard.
