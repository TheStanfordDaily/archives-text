### 
SEOUL (AP) — A secret
U.S.-North Korean meeting Sun
day may have made "substan
tial headway" toward release of
the USS Pueblo's crew, includ
ing agreement on returning the
dead and injured, South Korean
sources reported.
A Seoul radio station quoted
a South Korean government
source as speculating that "a
certain major agreement" might
have been reached.
According to one South Ko
rean account, the Communists
agreed Sunday to turn over a
body or bodies from the crew of
the captive intelligence ship.
Others said the North Koreans
planned to release the crew but
not the ship and had offered as
a first step to turn over the dead
and injured if the United States
would admit the vessel had in
truded into North Korean
waters.
At the same time, Korean offi
cials and legislators complained
that the United States were
showing too much concern
about the Pueblo incident and
not enough to the attempt last
month by North Korean infiltra
tors to kill President Chung Hee
Park or to South Korean re
quests for military moderniza
tion.
Park Choon-kyoo, chairman of
the National Assembly's For
eign Affairs Committee, de
clared Saturday that South Ko
rea should consider withdraw
ing its 48,000 troops from Viet

nam if the United States main
tains ias "lukewarm attitude."

world's 98 maritime nations, in
cluding the Soviet Union and
North Korea, have 12-mile lim
its. He noted less than 30 have
thnee-mile limits like the United
States.
"The Pueblo incident dramat

• LBJ Demo Choice
NEW YORK (AP) — A large
majority of the nation s Demo
cratic voters prefer President
Johnson to Sen. Eugene J. Mc-
Carthy, D-Minn., the Gallup

1 over McCarthy, a peace candi

Kennedy has said he won't op
pose Johnson in next fall's race.
The poll reported Kennedy is
far better known than Mc-
Carthy, who got 18 per cent of
the vote, compared to 71 per
cent for Johnson.
• I\eic Nixon Style
CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — As
a campaigner in his second bid
for the presidency, Richard M.
Nixon is giving a virtuoso per
formance in New Hampshire.
At one moment his facial ex
pressions mirror the image of
the thoughtful sattesman. In the
next, he is a quipping politician,

ing the laughs.
Eight years ago in his first
presidential campaign, Nixon
seldom resorted to humor, he
was usually deadly serious, a
young man in a hurry, Today,
he is making people laugh,
usually at his own expense.
Nixon confronts, head on, his
