# Controversial 'Ubu Rex'
## Politics Satirized 
### 
"Übu Rex", an absurd and
controversial play by Alfred
Jarry, will appear at the Little
Theatre on Fob. 710 at 8 p.m.
When the play first appeared
on the stage in 1896, a riot broke
out after Pere Übu uttered the
play's first word—an obscenity
never before spoken on the
stage. The play was reviewed as
"a revolutionary satire . . .
which began with a four-letter
word, defied all the traditions of
the stage, and ridiculed the es
tablished values of bourgeois so
ciety."
The play, directed by Roger
Pierce, centers around Father
Übu's ambition to become the
king of Poland, his success and
subsequent events. Übu is design
ed to bo "thr> stupidest and most
malicious dictator the world has
ever seen."
While Übu remains in the
great comic tradition of Fal
staff, he also appears to be a
tragic foreshadowing of the dis
astrous course taken by Nazi
Germany. The satire, a subjec
tive distortion of political change
around the century, develops a
tension of absurd despair.
The play, presented by the
Speech and Drama Dept., will
feature eight actors playing 34
parts. Paul Schneider and Jani
Brenn will fill the two leads, Fa
ther and Mother Übu. Joel Mills

will portray the entire Russian
Army, while William Clebsch
will represent the entire Polish
Gina Swain plays the
czar of Russia and John Pas
qualetti will appear as Queen
Rosamund.


"ÜBU REX" — Gina Swain, playing the czar of Russia, and Bill
Clebsch, representing the Polish army, engage in diplomatic rela
tions concerning the future of Poland in "ÜBU REX", to be staged
Feb. 7-10. In the play, characters in overupholstered costumes
satirize power politics in an unsual melange of the comic traditions
of FalstafT and Peanuts.
