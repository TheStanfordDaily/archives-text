## 
### 
Stanford's United Christian
Ministry (UCM) last night spon
sored a panel discussion in Tre
sidder Union on "Homosexual
ity and Ethical Choice."
One of the purposes of the
discussion was to determine in
terest in and reaction to a newly
formed campus group, the Stu
dent Homophile League of Stan
ford University.
The Stanford group, part of
a nationwide campus move
ment begun last >lay at Col
umbia University, will func
tion for a time under the
auspices of UCM.
In addition to four panel
members, 28 persons attended
the discussion, many of them
elderly men, several older male
students, and one woman.
Four men in the audience
were officers of San Francisco's
Society for Individual Rights
(SIR), the largest active homo
phile group in the country,
Presiding on the panel were
Jim Skaggs. chairman of relig
ious affairs of SIR; Phil Mass,
an associate of SIR; Mrs. Norma
Crockett, a clinical psychologist
at Stanford; and the Reverend
Richard Roe of Stanford's UCM.
Mrs. Crockett discussed the
personality characteristics of
the male college student who
is a homosexual and the thera

putic techniques involved in the
changing of such a persons's
sexual orientation.
She stated that homosexual
Ity Is not a hereditary trait
and that various environ
mental, situational, and cul
tural factors contribute to the
development of homosexual
tendencies in the male col
lege student.
Mass stated that a large num
ber of people who are now
homosexuals will choose to re
main as such. He believes that
every effort should be given
to modify or change an individ
ual's homosexual tendencies.
But Mass also feels that soci
ety should help people who
wish to remain homosexuals by
permitting them to be "con
structive citizens" without the
"subtle censure" they so often
receive.
Roe carried this point further,
stating that "the church has
been most responsible for the
condemnation society has placed
on the homosexual."
Roe believes that the church
should recognize that there can
be "fulfilling relationships" in
both heterosexuality and homo
sexuality. and should take "the
leadership in working for the
removal of the rejection and
harrassment of the homosex
ual."
