# Undergrad Housing Survey: Small, Coed Units Prefered
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Stanford's recent housing sur
vey showed how undergrad
uates will choose among the
existing kinds of residences. It

also asked them to describe
their ideal residence.
The 3,448 replies showed the
ideal Stanford residence to be:
1. Coeducational. Fifty-four
ppr c*>nt said they would be
"certain to include" this feature
in d' signing the pcrfect dormi
tory.
2. A Small, Separate House.
Women especially wanted a
residence with fewer than 90
people and separate dining facil
ities.
3. Integrated by Class. Fresh
men shouldn't be segregated in
to their own dormitories, 25 per
cent of the undergraduates
stressed.
4. Offering Voluntary Aca
demic Programs. Seminars were
widely favored, but all manda
tory activities—social or aca
demic—were condemned in 25
per cent of the questionnaires.

Not surprisingly, students
also want to live close to
campus, have a social program
and have "friendly, desirable,
considerate housemates" but
live in a single room. The per
fect dormitory would have a
lounge and study facilities. It
would be quiet, without social
regulations, open to all students
on a draw basis, and have a
faculty resident.
This residence profile was as
sembled with the aid of com
puters last month by the Fact-
Finding committee of the Dean's
office. Bill Leland, committee
chairman, presented the results
to the Study of Education (SES)
Thursday.
In Friday's Daily, an article
described how 1,500 undergrad
uates, 35 per cent, said they
wanted to live in some kind of
coeducational residence next
year. Even without changing
the status of Stanford's 24 fra
ternities, the survey showed it
was possible to reorganize
campus housing to satisfy 95
per cent of the students' first
choices.
A discrepancy was evident be
tween the students' conception
of an "ideal" residence and their
actual preferences among the
existing Stanford housing.
"Demonstration houses" were
listed as first choice by 21.2 per
cent of the men and 20.6 per
cent of the women, but far
greater numbers said they
wanted the features which dem
onstration houses offer—coedu
cation, integration of classes,
and optional seminars.
Leland blames this discrep
ancy on two disadvantages of
the four demonstration houses
—Grove, Serra, Otero and
Soto. With 90 or more stu
dents each, they are larger
than most students desire.
Two of the houses, Grove and
Serra, require enrollment In
house seminars.
Other students may not have
known what "demonstration
house" meant, Leland said. The
term was coined last spring.
Even though the survey may
underestimate the popularity of
coed, integrated housing, its re
sults are expected to help the
University design new dormi
tories in the future.
Students were hardly unani
mous in praising or criticizing
housing "factors." Men and wo
men as groups were in fairly
close agreement, but fraternity
men had sharply different pref
erences than men in coed
houses. The freshman class was
polarized into two groups, with
the residents of coed Branner
hall disagreeing on several is
sues with Wilbur men and Roble
women.
These differences were shown
by a section of the question
naire asking each student to
rate 40 "characteristics" of his
ideal residence on a scale from
5 ("extremely important") to 1
("extremely undesirable").
Fraternities gave "active so
cial program" an average rating
of 4.50, compared to demonstra
tion house men's 4.01 and off
campus men's 3.77. Conversely,
coeducation was rated lowest by
fraternity men at 3.77, and high
est by demonstration houses at
4.72. The average rating of co
education by all undergraduate
men was 4.09.
Seminars were most favored
by fraternity men who live off
campus, (4.18), followed by
demonstration house men (4.17),
fraternity residents (3.95) and
unaffiliated off - campus men
(3.91). Freshmen thought less
of seminars (Branner, 3.82; Wil
bur, 3.89).
Required seminars were uni
versally condemned, with
Stern men most opposed at
1.69 and demonstration house
men least unfavorable at 2.37.
Stern men most wanted to
live on campus (4.38), while off
campus, fraternity-affiliated men
thought this least important
(3.65).
The freshman class was dra
matically split into two camps.
The 250 men and women who
had selected a coeducational resi
dence last August (Branner or
a demonstration house) differed
on most preferences with the
776 men and women in single
sex, all-freshman Roble and Wil
bur. The 246 frosh men and wom
en in integrated, single-sex Stern
and Florence Moore stood in be
tween, tending toward the Bran
ner preferences.

Branner men, for instance,
rated coeducation 4.70 compared
to Wilbur's 3.96. Branner wom
en favored coed living with 4.80,
but Roble girls rated it only
3.75.
Branner men and women
thought a lounge was extreme
ly important, rating it 4.70 to
4.90, penhaps because it provides
a place where the opposite sexes
can meet informally. All-male
Wilbur rated a lounge only 4.51,
and all-female Roble 4.59.
Roble girls gave a strong en
dorsement to their present resi
dence. In the freshman draw
last August, 54 per cent of
Roble's women listed Roble as
their first choice. But in the Jan
uary questionnaire, 70 per cent
listed Roble first.
Wilbur men, however, decid
ed Wilbur wasn't as desirable
as they thought in August. At
that time 68 per cent selected
Wilbur| Now only 54 per cent
list it as their first preference.
The others now want to live
in Branner or a demonstration

house.
As for 1968-69, the freshmen
split on house lines over their
choice of where to live. Thirty
eight per cent of Wilbur chose
fraternities as first preference,
compared to only 34 per cent of
Branner freshmen, 23 per cent
of Stern freshmen, and five per
cent of freshmen in demonstra
tion houses.
What the survey provides is
a complex equation for. Univer
sity decision-makers. If more
women move off-campus, the fe
male enrollment at Stanford can
be increased by a certain
amount. If all sophomores are
guaranteed space on campus, a
certain number of transfer stu
dents will be excluded from Uni
versity residence.
The biggest question of all is
the true extent of undergradu
ates' enthusiasm for the recent
innovations in Stanford housing
— coeducation, integration, and
residence seminars.
A spring draw may give a
more definitive answer.

greater numbers said they
wanted the features which dem
onstration houses offer—coedu
cation, integration of classes,
and optional seminars.
Leland blames this discrep
ancy on two disadvantages of
the four demonstration houses
—Grove, Serra, Otero and
Soto. With 90 or more stu
dents each, they are larger
than most students desire.
Two of the houses, Grove and
Serra, require enrollment In
house seminars.
Other students may not have
known what "demonstration
house" meant, Leland said. The
term was coined last spring.
Even though the survey may
underestimate the popularity of
coed, integrated housing, its re
sults are expected to help the
University design new dormi
tories in the future.
Students were hardly unani
mous in praising or criticizing
housing "factors." Men and wo
men as groups were in fairly
close agreement, but fraternity
men had sharply different pref
erences than men in coed
houses. The freshman class was
polarized into two groups, with
the residents of coed Branner
hall disagreeing on several is
sues with Wilbur men and Roble
women.
These differences were shown
by a section of the question
naire asking each student to
rate 40 "characteristics" of his
ideal residence on a scale from
5 ("extremely important") to 1
("extremely undesirable").
Fraternities gave "active so
cial program" an average rating
of 4.50, compared to demonstra
tion house men's 4.01 and off
campus men's 3.77. Conversely,
coeducation was rated lowest by
fraternity men at 3.77, and high
est by demonstration houses at
4.72. The average rating of co
education by all undergraduate
men was 4.09.
Seminars were most favored
by fraternity men who live off
campus, (4.18), followed by
demonstration house men (4.17),
fraternity residents (3.95) and
unaffiliated off - campus men
(3.91). Freshmen thought less
of seminars (Branner, 3.82; Wil
bur, 3.89).
Required seminars were uni
versally condemned, with
Stern men most opposed at
1.69 and demonstration house
men least unfavorable at 2.37.
Stern men most wanted to
live on campus (4.38), while off
campus, fraternity-affiliated men
thought this least important
(3.65).
The freshman class was dra
matically split into two camps.
The 250 men and women who
had selected a coeducational resi
dence last August (Branner or
a demonstration house) differed
on most preferences with the
776 men and women in single
sex, all-freshman Roble and Wil
bur. The 246 frosh men and wom
en in integrated, single-sex Stern
and Florence Moore stood in be
tween, tending toward the Bran
ner preferences.

Branner men, for instance,
rated coeducation 4.70 compared
to Wilbur's 3.96. Branner wom
en favored coed living with 4.80,
but Roble girls rated it only
3.75.
Branner men and women
thought a lounge was extreme
ly important, rating it 4.70 to
4.90, penhaps because it provides
a place where the opposite sexes
can meet informally. All-male
Wilbur rated a lounge only 4.51,
and all-female Roble 4.59.
Roble girls gave a strong en
dorsement to their present resi
dence. In the freshman draw
last August, 54 per cent of
Roble's women listed Roble as
their first choice. But in the Jan
uary questionnaire, 70 per cent
listed Roble first.
Wilbur men, however, decid
ed Wilbur wasn't as desirable
as they thought in August. At
that time 68 per cent selected
Wilbur| Now only 54 per cent
list it as their first preference.
The others now want to live
in Branner or a demonstration

house.
As for 1968-69, the freshmen
split on house lines over their
choice of where to live. Thirty
eight per cent of Wilbur chose
fraternities as first preference,
compared to only 34 per cent of
Branner freshmen, 23 per cent
of Stern freshmen, and five per
cent of freshmen in demonstra
tion houses.
What the survey provides is
a complex equation for. Univer
sity decision-makers. If more
women move off-campus, the fe
male enrollment at Stanford can
be increased by a certain
amount. If all sophomores are
guaranteed space on campus, a
certain number of transfer stu
dents will be excluded from Uni
versity residence.
The biggest question of all is
the true extent of undergradu
ates' enthusiasm for the recent
innovations in Stanford housing
— coeducation, integration, and
residence seminars.
A spring draw may give a
more definitive answer.
Stanford's recent housing sur
vey showed how undergrad
uates will choose among the
existing kinds of residences. It

also asked them to describe
their ideal residence.
The 3,448 replies showed the
ideal Stanford residence to be:
1. Coeducational. Fifty-four
ppr c*>nt said they would be
"certain to include" this feature
in d' signing the pcrfect dormi
tory.
2. A Small, Separate House.
Women especially wanted a
residence with fewer than 90
people and separate dining facil
ities.
3. Integrated by Class. Fresh
men shouldn't be segregated in
to their own dormitories, 25 per
cent of the undergraduates
stressed.
4. Offering Voluntary Aca
demic Programs. Seminars were
widely favored, but all manda
tory activities—social or aca
demic—were condemned in 25
per cent of the questionnaires.

Not surprisingly, students
also want to live close to
campus, have a social program
and have "friendly, desirable,
considerate housemates" but
live in a single room. The per
fect dormitory would have a
lounge and study facilities. It
would be quiet, without social
regulations, open to all students
on a draw basis, and have a
faculty resident.
This residence profile was as
sembled with the aid of com
puters last month by the Fact-
Finding committee of the Dean's
office. Bill Leland, committee
chairman, presented the results
to the Study of Education (SES)
Thursday.
In Friday's Daily, an article
described how 1,500 undergrad
uates, 35 per cent, said they
wanted to live in some kind of
coeducational residence next
year. Even without changing
the status of Stanford's 24 fra
ternities, the survey showed it
was possible to reorganize
campus housing to satisfy 95
per cent of the students' first
choices.
A discrepancy was evident be
tween the students' conception
of an "ideal" residence and their
actual preferences among the
existing Stanford housing.
"Demonstration houses" were
listed as first choice by 21.2 per
cent of the men and 20.6 per
cent of the women, but far
greater numbers said they

men least unfavorable at 2.37.
Stern men most wanted to
live on campus (4.38), while off
campus, fraternity-affiliated men
thought this least important
(3.65).
The freshman class was dra
matically split into two camps.
The 250 men and women who
had selected a coeducational resi
dence last August (Branner or
a demonstration house) differed
on most preferences with the
776 men and women in single
sex, all-freshman Roble and Wil
bur. The 246 frosh men and wom
en in integrated, single-sex Stern
and Florence Moore stood in be
tween, tending toward the Bran
ner preferences.

Branner men, for instance,
rated coeducation 4.70 compared
to Wilbur's 3.96. Branner wom
en favored coed living with 4.80,
but Roble girls rated it only
3.75.
Branner men and women
thought a lounge was extreme
ly important, rating it 4.70 to
4.90, penhaps because it provides
a place where the opposite sexes
can meet informally. All-male
Wilbur rated a lounge only 4.51,
and all-female Roble 4.59.
Roble girls gave a strong en
dorsement to their present resi
dence. In the freshman draw
last August, 54 per cent of
Roble's women listed Roble as
their first choice. But in the Jan
uary questionnaire, 70 per cent
listed Roble first.
Wilbur men, however, decid
ed Wilbur wasn't as desirable
as they thought in August. At
that time 68 per cent selected
Wilbur| Now only 54 per cent
list it as their first preference.
The others now want to live
in Branner or a demonstration

house.
As for 1968-69, the freshmen
split on house lines over their
choice of where to live. Thirty
eight per cent of Wilbur chose
fraternities as first preference,
compared to only 34 per cent of
Branner freshmen, 23 per cent
of Stern freshmen, and five per
cent of freshmen in demonstra
tion houses.
What the survey provides is
a complex equation for. Univer
sity decision-makers. If more
women move off-campus, the fe
male enrollment at Stanford can
be increased by a certain
amount. If all sophomores are
guaranteed space on campus, a
certain number of transfer stu
dents will be excluded from Uni
versity residence.
The biggest question of all is
the true extent of undergradu
ates' enthusiasm for the recent
innovations in Stanford housing
— coeducation, integration, and
residence seminars.
A spring draw may give a
more definitive answer.
Stanford's recent housing sur
vey showed how undergrad
uates will choose among the
existing kinds of residences. It

also asked them to describe
their ideal residence.
The 3,448 replies showed the
ideal Stanford residence to be:
1. Coeducational. Fifty-four
ppr c*>nt said they would be
"certain to include" this feature
in d' signing the pcrfect dormi
tory.
2. A Small, Separate House.
Women especially wanted a
residence with fewer than 90
people and separate dining facil
ities.
3. Integrated by Class. Fresh
men shouldn't be segregated in
to their own dormitories, 25 per
cent of the undergraduates
stressed.
4. Offering Voluntary Aca
demic Programs. Seminars were
widely favored, but all manda
tory activities—social or aca
demic—were condemned in 25
per cent of the questionnaires.

Not surprisingly, students
also want to live close to
campus, have a social program
and have "friendly, desirable,
considerate housemates" but
live in a single room. The per
fect dormitory would have a
lounge and study facilities. It
would be quiet, without social
regulations, open to all students
on a draw basis, and have a
faculty resident.
This residence profile was as
sembled with the aid of com
puters last month by the Fact-
Finding committee of the Dean's
office. Bill Leland, committee
chairman, presented the results
to the Study of Education (SES)
Thursday.
In Friday's Daily, an article
described how 1,500 undergrad
uates, 35 per cent, said they
wanted to live in some kind of
coeducational residence next
year. Even without changing
the status of Stanford's 24 fra
ternities, the survey showed it
was possible to reorganize
campus housing to satisfy 95
per cent of the students' first
choices.
A discrepancy was evident be
tween the students' conception
of an "ideal" residence and their
actual preferences among the
existing Stanford housing.
"Demonstration houses" were
listed as first choice by 21.2 per
cent of the men and 20.6 per
cent of the women, but far
greater numbers said they
wanted the features which dem
onstration houses offer—coedu
cation, integration of classes,
and optional seminars.
Leland blames this discrep
ancy on two disadvantages of
the four demonstration houses
—Grove, Serra, Otero and
Soto. With 90 or more stu
dents each, they are larger
than most students desire.
Two of the houses, Grove and
Serra, require enrollment In
house seminars.
Other students may not have
known what "demonstration
house" meant, Leland said. The
term was coined last spring.
Even though the survey may
underestimate the popularity of
coed, integrated housing, its re
sults are expected to help the
University design new dormi
tories in the future.
Students were hardly unani
mous in praising or criticizing
housing "factors." Men and wo
men as groups were in fairly
close agreement, but fraternity
men had sharply different pref
erences than men in coed
houses. The freshman class was
polarized into two groups, with
the residents of coed Branner
hall disagreeing on several is
sues with Wilbur men and Roble
women.
These differences were shown
by a section of the question
naire asking each student to
rate 40 "characteristics" of his
ideal residence on a scale from
5 ("extremely important") to 1
("extremely undesirable").
Fraternities gave "active so
cial program" an average rating
of 4.50, compared to demonstra
tion house men's 4.01 and off
campus men's 3.77. Conversely,
coeducation was rated lowest by
fraternity men at 3.77, and high
est by demonstration houses at
4.72. The average rating of co
education by all undergraduate
men was 4.09.
Seminars were most favored
by fraternity men who live off
campus, (4.18), followed by
demonstration house men (4.17),
fraternity residents (3.95) and
unaffiliated off - campus men
(3.91). Freshmen thought less
of seminars (Branner, 3.82; Wil

sity decision-makers. If more
women move off-campus, the fe
male enrollment at Stanford can
be increased by a certain
amount. If all sophomores are
guaranteed space on campus, a
certain number of transfer stu
dents will be excluded from Uni
versity residence.
The biggest question of all is
the true extent of undergradu
ates' enthusiasm for the recent

— coeducation, integration, and
residence seminars.

more definitive answer.
Stanford's recent housing sur
vey showed how undergrad
uates will choose among the
existing kinds of residences. It

also asked them to describe
their ideal residence.
The 3,448 replies showed the
ideal Stanford residence to be:
1. Coeducational. Fifty-four
ppr c*>nt said they would be
"certain to include" this feature
in d' signing the pcrfect dormi
tory.
2. A Small, Separate House.
Women especially wanted a
residence with fewer than 90
people and separate dining facil
ities.
3. Integrated by Class. Fresh
men shouldn't be segregated in
to their own dormitories, 25 per
cent of the undergraduates
stressed.
4. Offering Voluntary Aca
demic Programs. Seminars were
widely favored, but all manda
tory activities—social or aca
demic—were condemned in 25
per cent of the questionnaires.

Not surprisingly, students
also want to live close to
campus, have a social program
and have "friendly, desirable,
considerate housemates" but
live in a single room. The per
fect dormitory would have a
lounge and study facilities. It
would be quiet, without social
regulations, open to all students
on a draw basis, and have a
faculty resident.
This residence profile was as
sembled with the aid of com
puters last month by the Fact-
Finding committee of the Dean's
office. Bill Leland, committee
chairman, presented the results
to the Study of Education (SES)
Thursday.
In Friday's Daily, an article
described how 1,500 undergrad
uates, 35 per cent, said they
wanted to live in some kind of
coeducational residence next
year. Even without changing
the status of Stanford's 24 fra
ternities, the survey showed it
was possible to reorganize
campus housing to satisfy 95
per cent of the students' first
choices.
A discrepancy was evident be
tween the students' conception
of an "ideal" residence and their
actual preferences among the
existing Stanford housing.
"Demonstration houses" were
listed as first choice by 21.2 per
cent of the men and 20.6 per
cent of the women, but far
greater numbers said they
wanted the features which dem
onstration houses offer—coedu
cation, integration of classes,
and optional seminars.
Leland blames this discrep
ancy on two disadvantages of
the four demonstration houses
—Grove, Serra, Otero and
Soto. With 90 or more stu
dents each, they are larger
than most students desire.
Two of the houses, Grove and
Serra, require enrollment In
house seminars.
Other students may not have
known what "demonstration
house" meant, Leland said. The
term was coined last spring.
Even though the survey may
underestimate the popularity of
coed, integrated housing, its re
sults are expected to help the
University design new dormi
tories in the future.
Students were hardly unani
mous in praising or criticizing
housing "factors." Men and wo
men as groups were in fairly
close agreement, but fraternity
men had sharply different pref
erences than men in coed
houses. The freshman class was
polarized into two groups, with
the residents of coed Branner
hall disagreeing on several is
sues with Wilbur men and Roble
women.
These differences were shown
by a section of the question
naire asking each student to
rate 40 "characteristics" of his
ideal residence on a scale from
5 ("extremely important") to 1
("extremely undesirable").
Fraternities gave "active so
cial program" an average rating
of 4.50, compared to demonstra
tion house men's 4.01 and off
campus men's 3.77. Conversely,
coeducation was rated lowest by
fraternity men at 3.77, and high
est by demonstration houses at
4.72. The average rating of co
education by all undergraduate
men was 4.09.
Seminars were most favored
by fraternity men who live off
campus, (4.18), followed by
demonstration house men (4.17),
fraternity residents (3.95) and
unaffiliated off - campus men
(3.91). Freshmen thought less
of seminars (Branner, 3.82; Wil
bur, 3.89).
Required seminars were uni
versally condemned, with
Stern men most opposed at
1.69 and demonstration house
men least unfavorable at 2.37.
Stern men most wanted to
live on campus (4.38), while off
campus, fraternity-affiliated men
thought this least important
(3.65).
The freshman class was dra
matically split into two camps.
The 250 men and women who
had selected a coeducational resi
dence last August (Branner or
a demonstration house) differed
on most preferences with the
776 men and women in single
sex, all-freshman Roble and Wil
bur. The 246 frosh men and wom
en in integrated, single-sex Stern
and Florence Moore stood in be
tween, tending toward the Bran
ner preferences.

Branner men, for instance,
rated coeducation 4.70 compared
to Wilbur's 3.96. Branner wom
en favored coed living with 4.80,
but Roble girls rated it only
3.75.
Branner men and women
thought a lounge was extreme
ly important, rating it 4.70 to
4.90, penhaps because it provides
a place where the opposite sexes
can meet informally. All-male
Wilbur rated a lounge only 4.51,
and all-female Roble 4.59.
Roble girls gave a strong en
dorsement to their present resi
dence. In the freshman draw
last August, 54 per cent of
Roble's women listed Roble as
their first choice. But in the Jan
uary questionnaire, 70 per cent
listed Roble first.
Wilbur men, however, decid
ed Wilbur wasn't as desirable
as they thought in August. At
that time 68 per cent selected
Wilbur| Now only 54 per cent
list it as their first preference.
The others now want to live
in Branner or a demonstration

house.
As for 1968-69, the freshmen
split on house lines over their
choice of where to live. Thirty
eight per cent of Wilbur chose
fraternities as first preference,
compared to only 34 per cent of
Branner freshmen, 23 per cent
of Stern freshmen, and five per
cent of freshmen in demonstra
tion houses.
