# Undergrad Housing Survey: Small, Coed Units Prefered
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Stanford's recent housing sur
vey showed how undergrad
uates will choose among the
existing kinds of residences. It

also asked them to describe
their ideal residence.
The 3,448 replies showed the
ideal Stanford residence to be:
1. Coeducational. Fifty-four
ppr c*>nt said they would be
"certain to include" this feature
in d' signing the pcrfect dormi
tory.
2. A Small, Separate House.
Women especially wanted a
residence with fewer than 90
people and separate dining facil
ities.
3. Integrated by Class. Fresh
men shouldn't be segregated in
to their own dormitories, 25 per
cent of the undergraduates
stressed.
4. Offering Voluntary Aca
demic Programs. Seminars were
widely favored, but all manda
tory activities—social or aca
demic—were condemned in 25
per cent of the questionnaires.

Not surprisingly, students
also want to live close to
campus, have a social program
and have "friendly, desirable,
considerate housemates" but
live in a single room. The per
fect dormitory would have a
lounge and study facilities. It
would be quiet, without social
regulations, open to all students
on a draw basis, and have a
faculty resident.
This residence profile was as
sembled with the aid of com
puters last month by the Fact-
Finding committee of the Dean's
office. Bill Leland, committee
chairman, presented the results
to the Study of Education (SES)
Thursday.
In Friday's Daily, an article
described how 1,500 undergrad
uates, 35 per cent, said they
wanted to live in some kind of
coeducational residence next
year. Even without changing
the status of Stanford's 24 fra
ternities, the survey showed it
was possible to reorganize
campus housing to satisfy 95
per cent of the students' first
choices.
A discrepancy was evident be
tween the students' conception
of an "ideal" residence and their
actual preferences among the
existing Stanford housing.
"Demonstration houses" were
listed as first choice by 21.2 per
cent of the men and 20.6 per
cent of the women, but far
greater numbers said they
wanted the features which dem
onstration houses offer—coedu
cation, integration of classes,
and optional seminars.
Leland blames this discrep
ancy on two disadvantages of
the four demonstration houses
—Grove, Serra, Otero and
Soto. With 90 or more stu
dents each, they are larger
than most students desire.
