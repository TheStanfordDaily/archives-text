# Two Minutes of Haight
## Whose God For CO? 
### Tim Haight 
Last Friday I accompanied a
good friend to his hearing at the
Federal Building. He was ap
pealing his draft board's rejec
tion of his application to become
a conscientious objector.
He had not had formal reli
gious training which would qual
ify him as religiously opposed
to war under the law. In fact, he
had left the Baptist Church of
his youth at about age 12. His
objection was based upon some
sense of God as an all-pervad
ing force in each of us and a
feeling that it was wrong for
any man to kill God in another
man.
He meant it. He was not put
ting on. He had come to this view
through reading, talking and
meditation. He would not kill.
If his I-O application were de
nied, he would not serve in the
Armed Forces, no matter what.
The examiner was not an ogre.
He was a fatherly type, the
father of three draft-age sons,
in fact. He was a Stanford grad
uate and a veteran of two wars.
Use of Articulateness
He told the applicant, my
friend, that he must be articu
late, having graduated from
Stanford, too. Since my friend
was articulate, then, could he
please explain this God and how
belief in him justified his appli
cation to be let out of his re
sponsibilities as a citizen?
My friend told him about his
belief in God and how he had
come to it through reading and
meditation (not drugs). His be
lief in God was sort of pantheis
tic. It just didn't seem right to
kill.
How, asked the examiner, does
this belief against killing quali
fy as a religious belief? How is
it different from a political so
ciological, philosophical, or mor

al belief, which, as you must
know, the Supreme Court hats
said do not qualify as grounds
for a conscientious objector clas
sification?
Well, my friend said, it's a
moral belief, too. It's not such a
separate thing. In my life, I al
ways try to avoid violence, to
avoid killing. I mean, it's not
like God came down to me and
said "Thou shall not kill." I just
feel that God is in everything
and that it's senseless to kill.
Conditions Allowing
The examiner, said that he
didn't want to kill, either, but
aren't there conditions when one
must kill? What if the nation
is attacked? How do you differ
entiate between not killing and
allowing someone to be killed
by your inaction?
The applicant got a little con
fused. He said that at least ho
wasn't doing the killing. If every
one felt that way, there would
be no wars. Can he be respon
sible for another person's killing,
when the only way to act "re
sponsibly" is to kili him?
The examiner called the appli
cant's attention to history. Peo
ple have been killing themselves
and others, with the support of
some religions, for centuries.
What is this God that won't
let you kill?
But the applicant couldn't
really describe God any better
than he already had. He didn't
know why his belief was in
sufficient. That was what he felt.
Basis Not Seen
The examiner told the appli
cant that he sounded confused,
which surprised him, since the
applicant was a Stanford gradu
ate, and supposed to be well vers
ed in the history and science of
man and all those other courses.
He told the applicant that he

couldn't see the basis for a con
scientious objectorship in what
he had said, since it sounded
just like his personal moral opi
nion, and not a religious convic
tion. He told the applicant to
write him a letter and try to put
down better what he felt.
The applicant said, what do
you want?
The examiner said, of course,
you can't understand why we
can't let you out of service on
account of your beliefs. To your
self, you are a conscientious ob
jector. But you've got to fit Con
gress' definition of it, as ampli
fied by the relevant Supreme
Court decision. Perhaps it would
help you to get a copy of that
decision.
The examiner said that when
he was young, he had question
ed, too. He had wondered about
killing. But then World War H
had come along, and he had
gone in the Navy and found that
religious faith had been a great
force in sustaining him in the
service of his country. Many re
ligions, he noted, emphasize
that part of a man's religious
duty is to serve his society.
Total Confusion
The applicant was totally con
fused. He couldn't be articulate.
He had tried to present what he
felt and failed. He hadn't re
alized that these were the terms
in which he would have to speak.
Now he'll write his letter, al
though he's not too sure about
what to say. And they'll prob
ably turn him down, and he'll
go to jail or maybe Canada. He
won't serve. And he'll still be
lieve what he belives.
But it doesn't matter. In the
eyes of the Justice Department,
it's only a personal belief, not
grounds for a conscientious ob
jection.
