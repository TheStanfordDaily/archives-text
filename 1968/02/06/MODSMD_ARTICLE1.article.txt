# Viet Street Fighting Continues; Communists Keep Hold On Hue
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — Intensified
fighting across South Vietnam
entered a second week Tuesday
with South Vietnamese troops
claiming the recapture of all
but one wall of the Citadel in
Hue, the ancient imperial capi
tal, while Communists still held
most of the city.
Toops pushing foot by foot
through Hue reported meeting
heavy resistance from Commu
nist soldiers holed up near the
Citadel's southeast wall. The
Viet Cong flag had been still
flying from the Citadel's ram
parts Monday.
U.S. Marines were reported
Monday in control of only 12
city blocks of Hue, 40 per cent
of their gtrnl. At that point,
the Communists still held two
thirds of the city, 400 miles
northeast of Saigon.
The thick-walled, moated Cit
adel, once the seat of Kings and
reecntly headquarters of the
South Vietnamese army's Ist In
fantry Division, has been re
duced to a two-mile-square pile
of ruins by allied ground at

tacids and shelling from the
ground, sea and air.
Four hundred miles to the
south, street fighting persisted
in parts of Saigon. Heavy action
was reported Tuesday morning
between South Vietnamese para
troopers and about a battalion
of the enemy less than a mile

north of Tan Son Nhut airport.
No fresh fighting was re
ported at Khe Sanh, along the
northern frontier, where U.S.
Marines are braced for a pos
sible invasion by North Vietna
mese divisions massed in the
area.
The U.S. Command an

nounced that 21,330 enemy were
killed up to midnight Monday,
seven days after the Commu
nist launched a countrywide of
fensive with attacks on 35 South
Vietnamese cities.
A U.S. spokesman said the
enemy dead represented more
than one-third of the total

force with which the Commu
nists began their widespread
attacks on 35 cities across
South Vietnam. That force
has been estimated by allied
intelligence officers at about
60,000.
U.S. headquarters said, 1,729
allied troops have been killed.
546 of them Americans and 1,169
South Vietnamese.
By U.S. count, the allies were
killing 12 enemy for every allied
soldier to die.
The casualty report covered
the first seven days of the f.gnt
ing, up to midnight Monday.
The enemy toll was up more
than 4,000 from the figure an
nounced a day earlier.
The toll of civilians killed,
wounded and made homeless by
the fighting was mounting into
the many thousands. In Saigon,
46,700 homeless civilians were
being sheltered in schools, hos
pitals, churches and Buddhist
pagodas.
Street fighting went through
a seventh day in Hue, with
U.S. Marines trying to rout

in Vietnamese cities.

namese holding two-thirds of

South Vietnamese forces bat
tled enemy troops Inside Hue's
ancient walled Citadel but the

At Khe Sanh, Marine com

Vietnamese assault on Hill 961 A
early Monday as just a probing
attack. Marines expressed con
fidence the odds are in their
favor if the North Vietnamese
launched the major offensive
U.S. commanders expect is com
ing. The United States bolstered
troop strength in the northern
area.
First dispatches began reach
ing Saigon of the Communist
attacks in the Mekong Delta
rice bowl south of the capital.
Fragmentary reports said the
Viet Cong attacked 11 of the
16 Mekong Delta provincial capi
tals but apaprently seized none
of them. In the delta fighting,
1,250 civilians were reported
killed, more than 3,000 wounded
and 80,000 to 120,000 left home
less.
Casualty figures for the whole
of the Communist offensive
launched throughout the coun
try a week ago still were lacking
but they threaten to number
many thousands of civilians.
Hundreds of thousands were
homeless.
The Viet Cong signaled
their strength In Saigon by
easily overrunning a police
substation after nightfall
Monday and the main precinct
headquarters for the district
an hour later. Ninety minutes
after the first Communist at
tack the precinct headquart
ers was in flames and police
had abandoned it.
The flames could be seen
from the center of Saigon,
where a 7 p.m. to daylight cur
few kept the streets clear but
for military forces.
U.S. intelligence reports indi
cate the Communists, although
apparently losing heavily in cas
ualties over the past week, still
are strong enough to launch a
second major offensive across
the nation and in Saigon.
The Viet Cong apparently re
mained in the vicinity of the
precinct after t;he attack. Air
activity over the area was visi
ble from the city's center. Both
the flames and flares dropped
from U.S. aircraft glowed over
the scene.

SAIGON (AP) — Intensified
fighting across South Vietnam
entered a second week Tuesday
with South Vietnamese troops
claiming the recapture of all
but one wall of the Citadel in
Hue, the ancient imperial capi
tal, while Communists still held
most of the city.
Toops pushing foot by foot
through Hue reported meeting
heavy resistance from Commu
nist soldiers holed up near the
Citadel's southeast wall. The
Viet Cong flag had been still
flying from the Citadel's ram
parts Monday.
U.S. Marines were reported
Monday in control of only 12
city blocks of Hue, 40 per cent
of their gtrnl. At that point,
the Communists still held two
thirds of the city, 400 miles
northeast of Saigon.
The thick-walled, moated Cit
adel, once the seat of Kings and
reecntly headquarters of the
South Vietnamese army's Ist In
fantry Division, has been re
duced to a two-mile-square pile
of ruins by allied ground at

tacids and shelling from the
ground, sea and air.
Four hundred miles to the
south, street fighting persisted
in parts of Saigon. Heavy action
was reported Tuesday morning
between South Vietnamese para
troopers and about a battalion
of the enemy less than a mile

north of Tan Son Nhut airport.
No fresh fighting was re
ported at Khe Sanh, along the
northern frontier, where U.S.
Marines are braced for a pos
sible invasion by North Vietna
mese divisions massed in the
area.
The U.S. Command an

nounced that 21,330 enemy were
killed up to midnight Monday,
seven days after the Commu
nist launched a countrywide of
fensive with attacks on 35 South
Vietnamese cities.
A U.S. spokesman said the
enemy dead represented more
than one-third of the total

force with which the Commu
nists began their widespread
attacks on 35 cities across
South Vietnam. That force
has been estimated by allied
intelligence officers at about
60,000.
U.S. headquarters said, 1,729
allied troops have been killed.
546 of them Americans and 1,169
South Vietnamese.
By U.S. count, the allies were
killing 12 enemy for every allied
soldier to die.
The casualty report covered
the first seven days of the f.gnt
ing, up to midnight Monday.
The enemy toll was up more
than 4,000 from the figure an
nounced a day earlier.
The toll of civilians killed,
wounded and made homeless by
the fighting was mounting into
the many thousands. In Saigon,
46,700 homeless civilians were
being sheltered in schools, hos
pitals, churches and Buddhist
pagodas.

SAIGON (AP) — Intensified
fighting across South Vietnam
entered a second week Tuesday
with South Vietnamese troops
claiming the recapture of all
but one wall of the Citadel in
Hue, the ancient imperial capi
tal, while Communists still held
most of the city.
Toops pushing foot by foot
through Hue reported meeting
heavy resistance from Commu
nist soldiers holed up near the
Citadel's southeast wall. The
Viet Cong flag had been still
flying from the Citadel's ram
parts Monday.
U.S. Marines were reported
Monday in control of only 12
city blocks of Hue, 40 per cent
of their gtrnl. At that point,
the Communists still held two
thirds of the city, 400 miles
northeast of Saigon.
The thick-walled, moated Cit
adel, once the seat of Kings and
reecntly headquarters of the
South Vietnamese army's Ist In
fantry Division, has been re
duced to a two-mile-square pile
of ruins by allied ground at

tacids and shelling from the
ground, sea and air.
Four hundred miles to the
south, street fighting persisted
in parts of Saigon. Heavy action
was reported Tuesday morning
between South Vietnamese para
troopers and about a battalion
of the enemy less than a mile

north of Tan Son Nhut airport.
No fresh fighting was re
ported at Khe Sanh, along the
northern frontier, where U.S.
Marines are braced for a pos
sible invasion by North Vietna
mese divisions massed in the
area.
