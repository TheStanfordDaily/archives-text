SAIGON (AP) — Intensified
fighting across South Vietnam
entered a second week Tuesday
with South Vietnamese troops
claiming the recapture of all
but one wall of the Citadel in
Hue, the ancient imperial capi
tal, while Communists still held
most of the city.
Toops pushing foot by foot
through Hue reported meeting
heavy resistance from Commu
nist soldiers holed up near the
Citadel's southeast wall. The
Viet Cong flag had been still
flying from the Citadel's ram
parts Monday.
U.S. Marines were reported
Monday in control of only 12
city blocks of Hue, 40 per cent
of their gtrnl. At that point,
the Communists still held two
thirds of the city, 400 miles
northeast of Saigon.
The thick-walled, moated Cit
adel, once the seat of Kings and
reecntly headquarters of the
South Vietnamese army's Ist In
fantry Division, has been re
duced to a two-mile-square pile
of ruins by allied ground at

tacids and shelling from the
ground, sea and air.
Four hundred miles to the
south, street fighting persisted
in parts of Saigon. Heavy action
was reported Tuesday morning
between South Vietnamese para
troopers and about a battalion
of the enemy less than a mile

north of Tan Son Nhut airport.
No fresh fighting was re
ported at Khe Sanh, along the
northern frontier, where U.S.
Marines are braced for a pos
sible invasion by North Vietna
mese divisions massed in the
area.
The U.S. Command an

nounced that 21,330 enemy were
killed up to midnight Monday,
seven days after the Commu
nist launched a countrywide of
fensive with attacks on 35 South
Vietnamese cities.
A U.S. spokesman said the
enemy dead represented more
than one-third of the total

force with which the Commu
nists began their widespread
attacks on 35 cities across
South Vietnam. That force
has been estimated by allied
intelligence officers at about
60,000.
U.S. headquarters said, 1,729
allied troops have been killed.
546 of them Americans and 1,169
South Vietnamese.
By U.S. count, the allies were
killing 12 enemy for every allied
soldier to die.
The casualty report covered
the first seven days of the f.gnt
ing, up to midnight Monday.
The enemy toll was up more
than 4,000 from the figure an
nounced a day earlier.
The toll of civilians killed,
wounded and made homeless by
the fighting was mounting into
the many thousands. In Saigon,
46,700 homeless civilians were
being sheltered in schools, hos
pitals, churches and Buddhist
pagodas.
Street fighting went through
a seventh day in Hue, with
U.S. Marines trying to rout

HOME, SWEET HOME: An unidentified American soldier found
time to add some humor to the gTim life at Khe Sanh, where North
Vietnamese troops in human waves Monday assaulted the sand
bagged trenches above. U.S. sources reported no new attacks on the
outpost Tuesday, but street fighting raged into the second week
in Vietnamese cities.
