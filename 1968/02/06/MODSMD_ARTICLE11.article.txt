# Competition For Frats
## 
### 
The popularity of Stanford fraternities is threatened.
Threats and criticism of frats are nothing new. Years ago ini
tiation rituals came under fire, and gradually the fraternities were
forced to tone down the ordeals. "Hell Week" became "help
week," with much fanfare.
More recently, Stanford frats ran into trouble over racial and
religious discrimination by their national organizations. Strong
pressure for reform came from within the fraternity ranks, and
Lambda Nu, Sigma Chi, ATO, and Beta Chi ended their na
tional affiliations.
The next pitfall was selective rush. Impatient, idealistic stu
dents were turned off by the "ding" system of selection, which
allowed any fraternity member to veto a rushee whom he dis
liked. Once again pressure for reform came from within the fra
ternities themselves, and Lambda Nu house modified its rush
procedure to a "positive vote" system. Beta Chi has abandoned
selectivity altogether.
Change has not been pleasant for some fraternities. Phi Kappa
Psi was broken and demoralized last quarter when a minority
of actives, supported by alumni, refused to move as fast or as
far as 30 sophomore pledges wanted. The pledges deserted the
house en masse.
Now fraternities face the most serious challenge of all — com
petition. Fewer men prefer fraternities as a place to live, despite
the beautiful new "cluster" buildings the University leases to a
majority of the 24 fraternities.
The recent housing survey, in fact, shows that the fraternities
would be unable to fill their 1100 beds next year if sufficient on
campus, coeducational housing were provided by Stanford.
A Daily survey showed fraternity rush chairmen want to pledge
about 100 more freshmen than the 283 who listed fraternities
as their first choice for 1968-69. This means freshmen excluded
from coed housing will "settle" for fraternities.
Otherwise the fraternities will fill their beds by taking in non
member boarders.
Already houses help pay the bills by renting beds to non
members. In one sense, these fraternities have already abandoned
selective living by force of necessity.
Lambda Nu has responded aggressively to the challenge of
coed living, with last month's proposal to bring in 20 women
residents. Other independent fraternities, seeing the handwriting
on the wall, will probably make similar suggestions.
But the University administration must give its approval to
any coed arrangements in fraternities. The upcoming position
paper of the Study of Education (SES) Residence committee
will probably indicate what the University wants.
And if further reforms help the fraternities meet their compe
tition, fraternity men should advocate reform without hesitation.

And if further reforms help the fraternities meet their compe
tition, fraternity men should advocate reform without hesitation.
The popularity of Stanford fraternities is threatened.
Threats and criticism of frats are nothing new. Years ago ini
tiation rituals came under fire, and gradually the fraternities were
forced to tone down the ordeals. "Hell Week" became "help
week," with much fanfare.
More recently, Stanford frats ran into trouble over racial and
religious discrimination by their national organizations. Strong
pressure for reform came from within the fraternity ranks, and
Lambda Nu, Sigma Chi, ATO, and Beta Chi ended their na
tional affiliations.
The next pitfall was selective rush. Impatient, idealistic stu
dents were turned off by the "ding" system of selection, which
allowed any fraternity member to veto a rushee whom he dis
liked. Once again pressure for reform came from within the fra
ternities themselves, and Lambda Nu house modified its rush
procedure to a "positive vote" system. Beta Chi has abandoned
selectivity altogether.
Change has not been pleasant for some fraternities. Phi Kappa
Psi was broken and demoralized last quarter when a minority
of actives, supported by alumni, refused to move as fast or as
far as 30 sophomore pledges wanted. The pledges deserted the
house en masse.
Now fraternities face the most serious challenge of all — com
petition. Fewer men prefer fraternities as a place to live, despite
the beautiful new "cluster" buildings the University leases to a
majority of the 24 fraternities.
The recent housing survey, in fact, shows that the fraternities
would be unable to fill their 1100 beds next year if sufficient on
campus, coeducational housing were provided by Stanford.
A Daily survey showed fraternity rush chairmen want to pledge
about 100 more freshmen than the 283 who listed fraternities
as their first choice for 1968-69. This means freshmen excluded
from coed housing will "settle" for fraternities.
Otherwise the fraternities will fill their beds by taking in non
member boarders.
Already houses help pay the bills by renting beds to non
members. In one sense, these fraternities have already abandoned
selective living by force of necessity.
Lambda Nu has responded aggressively to the challenge of
coed living, with last month's proposal to bring in 20 women
residents. Other independent fraternities, seeing the handwriting
on the wall, will probably make similar suggestions.
But the University administration must give its approval to
any coed arrangements in fraternities. The upcoming position
paper of the Study of Education (SES) Residence committee
will probably indicate what the University wants.
And if further reforms help the fraternities meet their compe
tition, fraternity men should advocate reform without hesitation.
