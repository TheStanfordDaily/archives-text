# Dedication To Truth
## 
### 
English professor Yvor Winters was a man who had enemies.
That is what the obituary did not say.
He had enemies because he was a man who believed passion
ately in what he taught; for him good poetry was an article of
faith. Winters was a proponent of what he called the "plain
style" â€” Ben Jonson, not Ernest Hemingway.
And he delighted in assaulting the Romantic views of poetry.
He set himself against T. S. Eliot and against Wallace Stevens.
Though he said he liked much of their work, he did not hesi
tate to assert that they were basically wrong in their approach
to poetry.
Winters said there was one proper way to write poems. He
arrived at this view through study and institution. In English
Winters believed that the best verse form was iambic pentameter,
though he himself frequently had experimented with other forms.
He believed that the poet should be completely in control of
his medium. He could not tolerate poems with imprecise mean
ings.
Winters believed in ideas; that they could change the course
of a man's life if he were honest in practicing what he believed.
In this vein he traced the poet Hart Crane's suicide to his ideas
of poetry.
Some critics thought Winters was deluded. Others thought
he was mad.
WTien Winter's student J. V. Cunningham, subsequently a great
poet in his own right, was a teaching assistant at Stanford, the
head of the English Department called Winters in on the car
pet. The executive told Winters that he despised his ideas of
poetry, "but we can't fire you since you've got tenure. We will
fire Cunningham, though."
Though some of his ideas and his personality offended people,
we believe Winters was in many ways an admirable teacher.
A university should allow men who believe passionately in
ideas come to try to convert disciples to their causes. And there
should be enough of these men so that the student has the chance
to hear many sides to the same question.
Winters wrote in "Quod Tegit Omnia,"
Adventurer in
living fact, the poet
mounts into the spring,
upon his tongue the taste of
air becoming body: is
embedded in this crystalline
precipitate of time.
Dead, Winters is embedded in the past. But we hope his at
titude of passionate dedication to truth as he perceived it does
not die at Stanford or in the rest of the world.
