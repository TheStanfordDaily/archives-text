# Today And Tomorrow
## Johnson Follows Asian Imperialist Course 
### Walter Lippmann 
That Britain is retiring as a
military power in the Persian
Gulf and the Far East cannot
have been a surprise to many.
It has long been discussed, and
It is a case of the inevitable com
ing to pass.
Though Britain carried on suc
cessfully in Malaya, It has not
been a Great Power in the Far
East since after the Korean war
of the Fifties. It has been too
hard-pressed financially and,
moreover, the British people
have been deeply opposed to
becoming engaged militarily in
Asia. The British government
could do no more for America
than give it rather reluctant ver
bal support.
It has so happened that at
the climax of the period of im
perial decline, the only two West
ern powers still active in Asia
have been led by men who have
refused to take seriously the his
toric transformation of the post
war. world.
Both Harold Wilson and Lyn
don Johnson came to power with
popular mandates to deal with
the internal problems of the
modern, urbanized, technological
society. Neither had, nor was
suppose to have, any special
competence in world affairs.
It has been a misfortune for
Britain and America and for
the world as well that, at this
climatic time of the liquidation
of Western imperialism In
Asia, the heads of government
In London and Washington
have been men bogged down

in the past. The times called
for active and positive states
manship in working out a new
relationship between the West
ern peoples and the Asia peo
ples.
But, until just the other day,
Prime Minister Wilson and Pres
ident Johnson had proceeded on
the notion that the power and
the influence exercised in Asian
affairs by Westerners could and
should continu 0 to be what it
once was in the bygone past.
This has meant that America
should impose a stable peace on
Asia from the Middle East to
the Siberian frontier.
This has been and is now more
than ever a preposterous "com
mitment." It is a greater com
mitment than has ever been un
dertaken by any nation in his
tory, and it was certain to
crumble when put to the test.
It has now crumbled from Aden
to Singapore.
Until the recent devaluation,
Prime Minister Wilson and his
foreign secretary have pretend
ed to be playing the role which
Britain played when Winston
Churchill was prime minister
and Frahklin D. Roosevelt was
President.
There has been, moreover, a
school of thought in Britain
which, though recognizing that
the British Empire was disap
pearing, has bemused itself with
th? idea that the Americans
could take over the 19th-century
role of Great Britain and carry
on the old Imperial mission.

These writers have given
much comfort to President
Johnson, who has been only
too ready to see America un
der his leadership playing the
part played by Britain In the
struggle against the Kaiser
and Adolf Hitler.
The two Western governments
are in the hands of men who
have misunderstood the radical
changes in international affairs
which have come about in the
postwar era. We are now living
through the tragic consequences
of being governed by men whose
minds have been formed and im
bedded in the past.
They have clung to the idea
that the central principle of
world politics in the 19th cen
tury ought to be and could be
continued into the second half
of the 20th century. This was
that the peace and order of all
the continents depended finally
on that military power and in
fluence of the British Empire.
There is a school of thinkers
in Britain and the United States
which takes it to be axiomatic
that there can be no order in
the world unless the old British
imperial power, or a substitute
for it, is operating on the globe.
Both Harold Wilson and Lyndon
Johnson have accepted this no
tion and have felt that it was
their national duty and interest
to appoint the United States,
with Britain advising and endors
ing its actions, as the master of
world order.

It was a plausible doctrine.
Having gone through two world
wars to defeat German and Jap
anese aggression, having spent
half a century convincing the
American people that they could
not isolate themselves from the
fate of Europe, it has seemed
quite obvious to many that what
had been so necessary and so
good in Europe should be neces
sary and good everywhere else.
What has been lacking in
the Wilson • Johnson view of
the world was the realization
that until this generation the
white man's position in the
Asian world was that of an
imperial master and that the
radical novelty of the world
today is that this imperial
relationship is gone forever.
It cannot be restored, for the
essence of the old Asian obe
dience to Western white men
was an acquiescing servility,
which, once reptured, can never
be put together again. When the
sleeper awakes, he cannot be
made to turn over, and resume
his dream.
The historic awakening of the
Asian peoples is a fact which
Prime Minister Wilson and Pres
ident Johnson have heard about,
but have ignored. They have not
been unaware of the Asian awak
ening, and they have courted the
anti-Communist nations of Asia.
But their attitude has in the
last analysis been dominated by
the assumption that peace and
order and the containment of

Chinese expansion required the
dedication of Western power for
the maintenance of order, in the
Asian world.
Believing that only a Western
power, formerly Britain and now
the United States, can establish
order in Asia, they have been at
tempting to do the impossible.
This has brought disaster to
their nations. Until the Novem
ber crisis, Prime Minister Wil
son has been unwilling to face
the realization that the British
Empire has come to its end.
Instead of making this historic
fact the premise of his policy, he
has attempted to resist and fight
the fact. A British statesman
might have turned the end of the
empire into the triumphant be
ginning of a new order of things.
But it has happened that by re
fusing to work with the inevit
able, the end of empire has not
been an orderly process and re
construction, but a cross.
The consequences of Presi
dent Johnson's misjudgment
of the postwar Asian world
have been masked, as they
could not be for "Prime Min
ister Wilson, by the enormous
wealth of the United States.
For about two years the Pres
ident was able to combine war
In Asia with affluence at home.
Moreover, so impressive is
American military power and
such is the obvious weakness of
the Vietnamese, that it has been
possible to mask the fact that
the United States, though fail

ing to win this one-sided war,
is isolated and alone, except for
a few reluctant satellites, in its
self-appointed mission as maker
and guardian of order in Asia.
What is no longer so well
masked is that the United States
is not able any longer to wage a
war in Asia and build a Great
Society at home. Indeed, the
very words "Great Society" have
disappeared from the President's
vocabulary, no doubt because
they might evoke satiric laugh
ter.
The distrust of Prime Minister
Wilson is, if anything, more bit
ter in Britain than is the distrust
of President Johnson in this
country. It is a striking fact that
the two English-speaking heads
of government should be suffer
ing from the same disability, not
merely that they are opposed by
their partisan adversaries, but
that in wide circles of their own
parties they are not believed to
be speaking the truth.
It is not unusual for heads
of government to be attacked
and disliked. But what Is very
special In the case of these two
men Is the disbelief in their
veracity.
This is due, I venture to sug
gest, to something significant,
to the special fact that both men
have been trying to make valid
a false view of the reality of
things. They have been profess
ing to play an historic role
which was valid in a different

continent and in a different gen
eration.
Prime Minister Wilson and
President Johnson are not Prime
Minister Churchill and Presi
dent Roosevelt, and the enor
mous masses of Asia are not the
national states of the Atlantic
community.
The Wilson - Johnson attempt
to perpetuate the English-speak
ing pre-eminence into the post
imperial age has entrapped them
in false promises and false re
ports. The penalty they are pac
ing for a policy which is false
to history is the savage dis
gust in which they are now en*
veloped.
In both countries the effect of
this distrust has been to jeopard
dize the political process itself*
It has created a disbelief, not
only in Harold Wilson and Lny
don Johnson, but in the political
institutions which they
sent.
We are suffering not from
communism and radicalism, but
from nihilism — a turning away
from the ancient Anglo-Ameri
can belief that public evils cari
be corrected by politics, by
votes and debates and parties
and representative assemblies
and elections. This is a threat to
the principle of our institutions,
and it is damage we have in
flicted upon ourselves, because
we have allowed our leaders to
pledge our lives, our fortunes
and our sacred honor to an his
toric illusion.
