Water Fluoridation—
A Communist Plot?
Editor, The Daily:
But Dr. Possony, how could
you fail to alert the American
people to the dirty communist
plot of fluoridation?

Editor, The Dally:
It's a pity that The Daily, in
reporting Mr. Possony's speech
on "Vietnam: Military Strat
egy," did not mention the evi
dence Mr. Possony must have
introduced in support of his
claim that "the Soviet Union
is responsible for the Vietnam
conflict, the Israeli-Arab war,
the devaluation of the British
pound, the attemtped military
coup in Greece, the recent
Cuban purge, and the newest
Korean crisis."
I for one would have liked to
see such evidence cited. Per
haps Mr. Possony would be good
enough to supply this missing
bit of information.

Editor, The Daily:
Since my husband is out of
town, he cannot, at present,
to the letter by Mr. L. J.

Rather (Dally of Feb. 1). How
ever, since I know my husband's
way of thinking and was pres
ent at his lecture, I would like
to state that the "summary"
as stated by Mr. Rather is a
complete distortion.
As to my husband's comments
on the article published in the
Daily (Jan. 30.), he told me that
he was asked by a member of
the Hoover Institution whether
he thought the author has been
unfair.
He replied that he did not
think the author was unfair but
that he had not been able to re
port, without mistakes, on a
very complicated analysis. My
husband did not talk to any
editor of The Stanford Daily.

University Christians
Have Own Movement
Editor, The Dally:
In last Friday's "Panel
Focuses on Homosexual Life,"
we noted one factual error in
the first sentence: UCM did in
fact sponsor the discussion.
However, this easily remem
bered abbreviation stands for
University Christian Movement,
not United Christian Ministry.
UCM is an ecumenically-orient
ed student movement, which
works in conjunction with the
Christain ministers and staff on
campus.
This is a small error, and yet

of importance for the commun
ity to understand in reading of
the University Christian Move
ment.

Two World Monoliths

Editor, The Daily:
If Ho Chi Minh and the Viet
namese people thought like Dr.
Possony, the U.S. would doubt
less have won the war a long
time ago. However, it is diffi
cult to make such a quasi-Marx
ian interpretation as "the war
itself is a great economic boom
for both North and South Viet
nam", etc. convincing.
The Western mentality is
awed by the placidity with
which the Easterner accepts
death in the name of Emperor
or Revolution or what have you.
It is the result of the com
munity being organic rather
than fragmented.
It would indeed be ludicrous
to classify Ho and Giap along
with the Renaissance mercen
aries who connived with their
enemies to prolong the wars
since fighting was really much
more fun, exciting and profit
able than farming.
If we are to grant Felix
Greene any degree of credibil
ity, it is the energy and ingenu
ity of the Vietnamese people
and their dedication to freedom
that prolongs Hanoi's resistance
to a far greater degree than the

aid she receives from various
interested friends. Arms are
only as effective as the people
who use them make them. It
is patently absurd to assert that
any other Vietnamese other
than a few with Swiss bank
accounts should want the . war
to be prolonged any longer than
the U.S. forces want it to be.
The wars of today are not
confrontations of U.S. vs.
U.S.S.R. Rather is is Vietnam
vs. U.S.A.; Israel vs. USS.R. The
question is not which of two
monoliths will control the world
but whether two monoliths will
control the world.

SRT Resignations Are
Irreplaceable Loss
Editor, The Daily:
The severance of Gerald
Hiken and Paul Richards from
Stanford is truly an irreplace
able loss to the University com
munity.
Having lived in New York for
years and been acquainted with
a number of professional actors,
we can testify that to find peo
ple of their experience and cali
ber as artists who are yet
genuine persons, who have not
been grotesquely distorted by
the Broadway-Hollywood scene,
who could relate as effectively
as they do to Stanford students,
is next to impossible to do. The
next step in theater affairs at
Stanford is bound to be down.

Water Fluoridation—

It's a pity that The Daily, in

on "Vietnam: Military Strat

dence Mr. Possony must have
introduced in support of his
claim that "the Soviet Union
is responsible for the Vietnam
conflict, the Israeli-Arab war,
the devaluation of the British
pound, the attemtped military
coup in Greece, the recent
Cuban purge, and the newest
Korean crisis."
I for one would have liked to

Rather (Dally of Feb. 1). How
ever, since I know my husband's

to state that the "summary"
as stated by Mr. Rather is a
complete distortion.
As to my husband's comments
on the article published in the

he was asked by a member of
the Hoover Institution whether
he thought the author has been

He replied that he did not

that he had not been able to re

very complicated analysis. My

University Christians
Have Own Movement
Editor, The Dally:
In last Friday's "Panel
Focuses on Homosexual Life,"
we noted one factual error in
the first sentence: UCM did in
fact sponsor the discussion.
However, this easily remem
bered abbreviation stands for
University Christian Movement,
not United Christian Ministry.
UCM is an ecumenically-orient
ed student movement, which
works in conjunction with the
Christain ministers and staff on
campus.
This is a small error, and yet

of importance for the commun
ity to understand in reading of
the University Christian Move
ment.

If Ho Chi Minh and the Viet
namese people thought like Dr.
Possony, the U.S. would doubt
less have won the war a long
time ago. However, it is diffi
cult to make such a quasi-Marx
ian interpretation as "the war
itself is a great economic boom
for both North and South Viet
nam", etc. convincing.
The Western mentality is
awed by the placidity with
which the Easterner accepts
death in the name of Emperor
or Revolution or what have you.
It is the result of the com
munity being organic rather
than fragmented.
It would indeed be ludicrous
to classify Ho and Giap along
with the Renaissance mercen
aries who connived with their
enemies to prolong the wars
since fighting was really much
more fun, exciting and profit
able than farming.
If we are to grant Felix
Greene any degree of credibil
ity, it is the energy and ingenu
ity of the Vietnamese people
and their dedication to freedom
that prolongs Hanoi's resistance
to a far greater degree than the

aid she receives from various
interested friends. Arms are
only as effective as the people
who use them make them. It
is patently absurd to assert that
any other Vietnamese other
than a few with Swiss bank
accounts should want the . war
to be prolonged any longer than
the U.S. forces want it to be.
The wars of today are not
confrontations of U.S. vs.
U.S.S.R. Rather is is Vietnam

Water Fluoridation—
A Communist Plot?
Editor, The Daily:
But Dr. Possony, how could
you fail to alert the American
people to the dirty communist
plot of fluoridation?

Editor, The Dally:
It's a pity that The Daily, in
reporting Mr. Possony's speech
on "Vietnam: Military Strat
egy," did not mention the evi
dence Mr. Possony must have
introduced in support of his
claim that "the Soviet Union
is responsible for the Vietnam
conflict, the Israeli-Arab war,
the devaluation of the British
pound, the attemtped military
coup in Greece, the recent
Cuban purge, and the newest
Korean crisis."
I for one would have liked to
see such evidence cited. Per
haps Mr. Possony would be good
enough to supply this missing
bit of information.

In Husband 9 s Place
Editor, The Daily:
Since my husband is out of
town, he cannot, at present,
to the letter by Mr. L. J.

Rather (Dally of Feb. 1). How
ever, since I know my husband's
way of thinking and was pres
ent at his lecture, I would like
to state that the "summary"
as stated by Mr. Rather is a
complete distortion.
As to my husband's comments
on the article published in the
Daily (Jan. 30.), he told me that
he was asked by a member of
the Hoover Institution whether
he thought the author has been
unfair.
He replied that he did not
think the author was unfair but
that he had not been able to re
port, without mistakes, on a
very complicated analysis. My
husband did not talk to any
editor of The Stanford Daily.

University Christians
Have Own Movement
Editor, The Dally:
In last Friday's "Panel
Focuses on Homosexual Life,"
we noted one factual error in
the first sentence: UCM did in
fact sponsor the discussion.
However, this easily remem
bered abbreviation stands for
University Christian Movement,
not United Christian Ministry.
UCM is an ecumenically-orient
ed student movement, which
works in conjunction with the
Christain ministers and staff on
campus.
This is a small error, and yet

of importance for the commun
ity to understand in reading of
the University Christian Move
ment.

Two World Monoliths
May Lose To Asians
Editor, The Daily:
If Ho Chi Minh and the Viet
namese people thought like Dr.
Possony, the U.S. would doubt
less have won the war a long
time ago. However, it is diffi
cult to make such a quasi-Marx
ian interpretation as "the war
itself is a great economic boom
for both North and South Viet
nam", etc. convincing.
The Western mentality is
awed by the placidity with
which the Easterner accepts
death in the name of Emperor
or Revolution or what have you.
It is the result of the com
munity being organic rather
than fragmented.
It would indeed be ludicrous
to classify Ho and Giap along
with the Renaissance mercen
aries who connived with their
enemies to prolong the wars
since fighting was really much
more fun, exciting and profit
able than farming.
If we are to grant Felix
Greene any degree of credibil
ity, it is the energy and ingenu
ity of the Vietnamese people
and their dedication to freedom
that prolongs Hanoi's resistance
to a far greater degree than the

aid she receives from various
interested friends. Arms are
only as effective as the people
who use them make them. It
is patently absurd to assert that
any other Vietnamese other
than a few with Swiss bank
accounts should want the . war
to be prolonged any longer than
the U.S. forces want it to be.
The wars of today are not
confrontations of U.S. vs.
U.S.S.R. Rather is is Vietnam
vs. U.S.A.; Israel vs. USS.R. The
question is not which of two
monoliths will control the world
but whether two monoliths will
control the world.

SRT Resignations Are
Irreplaceable Loss
Editor, The Daily:
The severance of Gerald
Hiken and Paul Richards from
Stanford is truly an irreplace
able loss to the University com
munity.
Having lived in New York for
years and been acquainted with
a number of professional actors,
we can testify that to find peo
ple of their experience and cali
ber as artists who are yet
genuine persons, who have not
been grotesquely distorted by
the Broadway-Hollywood scene,
who could relate as effectively
as they do to Stanford students,
is next to impossible to do. The
next step in theater affairs at
Stanford is bound to be down.
