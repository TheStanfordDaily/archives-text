# Punish Act, Not Actor
## Judge Claims Slums Cause Crimes 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
One of the country's most out
spoken and well-known judges
has been guest-in-residence of
the Eating Clubs and the Law
Forum for the past two days.
David L. Bazelon, chief judge
of the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Col
umbia circuit, ends his visit to
day with talks at the School of
Medicine, the Law School, and
an after-dinner discussion in
Toyon.
In an informal discussion Sun
day night, similar to that plan
ned for this evening, Bazelon ex
pounded on one of his favorite
topics, the punishment and
treatment of people from slum
backgrounds who have commit
ted crimes.
His views on this topic have
caused people to charge him
with condoning crime.
Bazelon believes in censur
ing the criminal act, "but not
the actor," If the social and
economic background of the
person who committed the
crime was a major contribu

tion to his actions, especially
criminal ones.
This attitude ties in with his
view on prosecuting those who
are mentally ill. In fact, Bazelon
feels the utter poverty and des
pair of many slums have caused
in some people who live there
a condition quite akin to what
is commonly termed mental ill
ness.
He cited the case of a 15-year
old girl from a Washington
slum who had repeatedly cut
her boyfriend with a piece of
broken glass after an argument.
The judge in the case was
asked to find the girl insane,
and have her committed for
treatment. He ruled, however,
that although the girl's back
ground was quite abnormal by
white society's standards (in
cluding such things as being
raped at age nine), such a back
ground was not uncommon in
her society, and very few people
who had gone through circum
stances similar to hers did what
she did.
"Whether she was right or

wrong," Bazelon said, "it's a
sad state." On one hand, we
must accept a completely
broken and disrupted child
hood as "normal" for part of
our citizens, or on the other
condone acts of violence such
as the girl commited, he
asserted.
Another instance Bazelon
mentioned was the case of a
man who had pleaded guilty to
stealing some food, and then

asked to change his plea to inno
cent, despite the fact he ad
mitted his guilt.
The judge in the case refused
to let him change his plea. The
decision was upheld on appeal,
with Bazelon dissenting.
He felt that a jury should
have been given the opportunity
to decide if the man's circum
stances —his wife was extremely
ill in a hospital and he had no
money for food—were enough

to excuse him; in Bazelon's
words, condemn the act but not
the actor.
He feels people should not
be stigmatized by society—
that Is, found guilty of a
crime and punished for It —
when their acts were caused
more by the society in which
they live than by themselves.
This general approach to the
law has often had him support
ing unpopular positions.

topics, the punishment and
treatment of people from slum
backgrounds who have commit
ted crimes.
His views on this topic have
caused people to charge him
with condoning crime.
Bazelon believes in censur
ing the criminal act, "but not
the actor," If the social and
economic background of the
person who committed the
crime was a major contribu

tion to his actions, especially
criminal ones.
This attitude ties in with his
view on prosecuting those who
are mentally ill. In fact, Bazelon
feels the utter poverty and des
pair of many slums have caused
in some people who live there
a condition quite akin to what
is commonly termed mental ill
ness.
He cited the case of a 15-year
old girl from a Washington
slum who had repeatedly cut
her boyfriend with a piece of
broken glass after an argument.
The judge in the case was
asked to find the girl insane,
and have her committed for
treatment. He ruled, however,
that although the girl's back
ground was quite abnormal by
white society's standards (in
cluding such things as being
raped at age nine), such a back
ground was not uncommon in
her society, and very few people
who had gone through circum
stances similar to hers did what
she did.
"Whether she was right or

wrong," Bazelon said, "it's a
sad state." On one hand, we
must accept a completely
broken and disrupted child
hood as "normal" for part of
our citizens, or on the other
condone acts of violence such
as the girl commited, he
asserted.
Another instance Bazelon
mentioned was the case of a
man who had pleaded guilty to
stealing some food, and then

asked to change his plea to inno
cent, despite the fact he ad
mitted his guilt.
The judge in the case refused
to let him change his plea. The
decision was upheld on appeal,
with Bazelon dissenting.
He felt that a jury should
have been given the opportunity
to decide if the man's circum
stances —his wife was extremely
ill in a hospital and he had no
money for food—were enough

to excuse him; in Bazelon's
words, condemn the act but not
the actor.
He feels people should not
be stigmatized by society—
that Is, found guilty of a
crime and punished for It —
when their acts were caused
more by the society in which
they live than by themselves.
This general approach to the
law has often had him support
ing unpopular positions.
