O WASHINGTON (CPS)—More

t " scientists to refuse to permit
; their discoveries to be used for
destructive purposes, the pro
fessors said a continuation of

1 campuses would "lead to the de
_ termination of an ever-growing

versities.
Among the 433 signers of the
statement are Nobel Prize win

J and Hideki Yukawa.
The statement specifically

"It is a matter of fundamental

"We know that many of you

would inevitably lead to the de
termination of an ever-growing
