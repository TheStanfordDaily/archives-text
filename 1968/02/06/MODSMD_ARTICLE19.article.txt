# New Yale Classes Examine City Ills
## 
### 
The city planning department
at Yale is offering a course on
New York City and one on Har
lem this semester in which the
students will "go down to the
city, walk the streets, get wet,
get their hands dirty, get the
feel of the place, and talk to
people."
The courses, both undergrad
uate seminars, are departures
from the customary method of
teaching urban studies in an ab
stract form to college students.
Each class will be assigned
reading from more than 30
books, but the students will
focus on solving problems for
specific clients in New York.
Alex Garvin, one of the In
structors, believes that "to
study cities in theory apart
from studying an actual city
Is nonsense."
The new classes, each contain
ing about 15 members, are for
students who have done intro
ductory work in the subject.
Three students in the New York
course are from the city they
are studying, but only one in
the class on Harlem is from
Harlem.

The students in the New York
class, taught by Mr. Macbeth
and Mr. Garvin together, will
work in four areas—the Park
Slope section of Brooklyn, the
Upper West Side, on Staten Is
land, and in Central Harlem.
Each student must solve a
fictional problem proposed by
real clients in one of the neigh
borhoods. Some of the problems
include building a cross-Harlem
expressway, attracting industry
to Staten Island for the Depart
ment of Commerce and Indus
trial Development, and building
new housing to accommodate
population pressures in Brook
lyn.
"The first thing the students
will learn," Mr. Garvin said, "is
how little we actually know
about individual cities. That's
why they'll have to go into New
York more than once. But by
studying something relatively
small in greater detail, you
learn more about the subject."
