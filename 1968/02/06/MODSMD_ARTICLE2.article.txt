# Graffitti On Leland's Farm: 'CIA: All You Need Is Loveâ€™
## 
### 
A person will often continue
or add to another's graffito,
changing the meaning or mes
sage with a twist of humor.
Perhaps a construction work
er started this graffito, and two
Stanford students might have
finished the job: (in green)
"They say sing while you slave
and i jest get bored; I ain't
gonna work on" (then under
neath in red) "... Wally's farm"
(and in black) "...no more."
Approaching the Poetic
One blurb was an obvious
poetical attempt, and, judging

from the grammar, was appar
antly written by the same per
son who started the last graffito:
"I try my best to be jest like I
am, but everybody wants ya to
be just like them."
And a university construction
fence wouldn't be complete
without its profound intellec
tual haikus. "And beauty is not
a need, but an ecstasy." Or
"When I look in my window
... so many things to BE."
The length of expression
grows: "So, I continue to con
tinue to pretend: My life will

never end, and classes never
end with the rainfall."
But most artistic of all is a
graffito which would probably
sell as a poem: "Rain makes a
man sad somehow ... painfilled
drops draw Special People out
to breathe the rain-smell... to
see their Sorrow rising from the
damp earth."
Then one political graffito
couldn't care less about Amer
ica's involvement in Viet Nam,
but instead orders, "U.S. get out
of California."
