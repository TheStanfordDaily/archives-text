# Rhodes Scholars Seldom Come From State Schools
## 
### RICHARD ANTHONY College Press Service 
Last December, when the
names of the winners of the
1967-68 Rhodes Scholarship com
petition were announced, it turn
ed out that half the 32 recipients
came from four schools — Har

vard, Yale, Dartmouth, and
Princeton.
These Ivy League schools
made a much stronger showing
than they had the year before,
but a study of the history of
the Scholarships shows that the
year before was an exception—
Ivy schools, particularly Har
vard, Yale, and Princeton, have
dominated the program since its
inception in 1903, with West
Point and Dartmouth College a
distant fourth and fifth. The
question is, why?
The regular, awarding of
Rhodes Scholarships began in
1904, with money going to stu
dents in America and in the
British colonies to study for two
years at Oxford College in En
gland. The U.S. is allotted 32 of
the awards. The country has
been divided into eight districts
for the purpose of making the
awards, with four recipients be
ing chosen from each district.
An applicant can use either the
location of his home or that of
his college in deciding which
district he will apply from.
The scholarships, which fi
nance two years of study at
Oxford College in England
for each of the recipients, are
the most prestigious by far of
the awards available to college
graduates in this country.
The head of the Rhodes Trust
in this country is Courtney
Smith, who is also the president
of Swarthmore College, a small
liberal arts school near Philadel
phia. In 1960 Smith wrote an
article for the American Oxon
ian, a bimonthly magazine for
American Rhodes Scholars, in
which he gave five reasons for
the dominance of certain Ivy
League schools.
The reasons Smith offered
were, 1) these schools are of

high quality; 2) they attract the
best students from all over thi
country, which means Ivy Lea
gue candidates often can go
back to win Scholarships from
districts outside of the East; 3)
they have close student-faculty
relations, which means that
Rhodes applicants are given aid
and encouragement, and also
that detailed, informative letters
of recommendation are written
about them; 4) these schools rely
to a large extent on seminars
and tutorials, which give stu
dents more "ability to talk and
to handle ideas" than they would
get from large lecture courses;
and 5) the schools have a "strong
tradition" of encouraging
Rhodes applications.
Whether or not Smith's rea
sons for, the Ivy dominance of
the Rhodes' program are valid,
it is clear that the state colleges
and universities have been at
the opposite end of the Rhodes'
spectrum from the Ivy League
schools. Although more than
60% of all college students now
graduate from state-supported
institutions, their share of the
Rhodes' Scholarships has been
and still is minimal.
Earnest Griffith, former dean
of American University's School
of International Service in Wash
ington, and a Rhodes Scholar
himself, estimated in 1960 that
a Rhodes' applicant from an Ivy
League School or one of the
service academices had a 1 in 250
chance of winning an award. A
candidate from a state univer
sity had 1 chance in 48,000.
This past year, when state uni
versity students won seven of
the 32 Scholarships, he says that
the chances for a student in a
state-supported school were no
better than in 1959-60.

question is, why?
The regular, awarding of
Rhodes Scholarships began in
1904, with money going to stu
dents in America and in the
British colonies to study for two
years at Oxford College in En
gland. The U.S. is allotted 32 of
the awards. The country has
been divided into eight districts
for the purpose of making the
awards, with four recipients be
ing chosen from each district.
An applicant can use either the
location of his home or that of
his college in deciding which
district he will apply from.
The scholarships, which fi
nance two years of study at
Oxford College in England
for each of the recipients, are
the most prestigious by far of
the awards available to college
graduates in this country.
The head of the Rhodes Trust
in this country is Courtney
Smith, who is also the president
of Swarthmore College, a small
liberal arts school near Philadel
phia. In 1960 Smith wrote an
article for the American Oxon
ian, a bimonthly magazine for
American Rhodes Scholars, in
which he gave five reasons for
the dominance of certain Ivy
League schools.
The reasons Smith offered
were, 1) these schools are of

high quality; 2) they attract the
best students from all over thi
country, which means Ivy Lea
gue candidates often can go
back to win Scholarships from
districts outside of the East; 3)
they have close student-faculty
relations, which means that
Rhodes applicants are given aid
and encouragement, and also
that detailed, informative letters
of recommendation are written
about them; 4) these schools rely
to a large extent on seminars
and tutorials, which give stu
dents more "ability to talk and
to handle ideas" than they would
get from large lecture courses;
and 5) the schools have a "strong
tradition" of encouraging
Rhodes applications.
Whether or not Smith's rea
sons for, the Ivy dominance of
the Rhodes' program are valid,
it is clear that the state colleges
and universities have been at
the opposite end of the Rhodes'
spectrum from the Ivy League
schools. Although more than
60% of all college students now
graduate from state-supported
institutions, their share of the
Rhodes' Scholarships has been
and still is minimal.
