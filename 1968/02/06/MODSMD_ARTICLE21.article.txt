# U.S. Losing ‘Other War’ In Vietnam
## 
### STEVE D'ABAZIEN College Press Service 
SAIGON (CPS)—The war in
Vietnam is really two wars: one
military and the other socio
economic, and the two must be
fought together, administration
officials explain.
But in truth Vietnam remains
overwhelmingly a military oper
ation with military brass calling
the shots. The excuse is often
made that the Other War can
not really be waged until the
military situation is under con
trol.
The Other War means the bat
tle against the poverty, disease,
and illiteracy which plague Viet
nam. The more sophisticated,
political science-oriented advi
sors here understand the causes
of the Vietnamese civil war.
They realize Vietnamese society
is divided between rich city
dwellers and rural peasants. But
their understanding has not
helped them win the war.
There are a number of fun
damental reasons why the Other
War cannot be won, reasons
which are not considered by the
men waging it. All of the rea
sons are tied up with the ques

tion of our motivation. In the
Administration's eyes helping
the Vietnamese, winning their
"hearts and minds" is a means,
not an end. Dean Rusk, in an
unusual display of candor, has
admitted as much.
Sometimes it seems our real
reason for being in Vietnam is
to deny the Chinese a tradition
al sphere of influence in Asia.
Or perhaps we seek a wider
purpose—to send a message to
revolutionaries throughout the
world—Asian, African, Latin
American; Maoist or Fidelista
—that we will zap them with
our counter-insurgency tech
niques. Underlying this is our
real intent: that the have-nots
will not get what we have with
out a fight, that they might as
well submit to U.S. domination,
enjoy the munificence of our
foreign aid program, and not
cause any trouble.
Simply put, America's idealogy
precludes winning the Other
War. We support the very ele
ments which profit from the
poverty of the Vietnamese peas
ants. Eisenhower and Dulles de
fended U.S. intervention in Viet
nam in the fifties because they

felt the U.S. couldn't afford to
lose valuable natural resources
in Vietnam to the communists.
In fact, only a small but power
ful group of Americans stood to
profit from U.S. involvement, the
major shareholders in the com
panies which process the raw
materials. The American public
was neither harmed nor helped
economically.
The Vietnamese civil war is
an example of class warfare.
Our anti-communist allies there
are the rich upper-class, French
trained element of Vietnamese
society, unrepresentative of the
whole. Their opponents, always
referred to as "Communists" in
our press, although few are

ideologically motivated and all
are nationalists, represent the
aspirations and needs of the
Vietnamese peasantry.
The fundamental contradic
tion of maiming people one day
and patching them up the next
disturbs many sincere, con
cerned Americans working in
Vietnam. These few Americans
like the Vietnamese people,
speak their language, wear Viet
namese dress and work for AID
or for voluntary agencies like
the International Volunteer Ser
vice (IVS). This group is deeply
disturbed about the war.
I met a local AID chief who
was sympathetic with the Viet
namese and who had been suc
cessful in pacifying his area be
cause he was trusted. He agreed
with me when I said our aid
was inauthentic. Vietnamese
also find our aid program an
exercise in duplicity. It is fraud
ulant to drop bombs, create ref
ugees, and expect gratitude
when you feed them.
The Pentagon would prefer
improved relations with the na
tives. The Army handbook
warns soldiers not to abuse Viet
namese women, talk loud, drive
recklessly, or wave their money
around. It says, "Join the peo
ple. Understand their life. Use
phrases from their language.
Honor their customs and laws."
But the racism is too deeply
rooted. Soldiers do insult the
women, run the men off the
road, and turn children into beg
gars.
In a land of poverty (relative
to the U.S., not India), Ameri
can influence causes resentment
and raises expectations beyond
the point at which they can be
fulfilled. American aid person
nel frequently live quite grand
ly, sometimes in former French
villas. Doctors in Quang Ngai
paid $30,000 to rennovate a villa,

then continued to pay $400 a
month rent. Almost any Viet
nam assignment is more lucra
tive than a similar stateside job.
Heavy equipment operators for
the RMK-BRG consortium make
around $2000 a month, far more
than the Vietnamese make in a
year. And Vietnamese doing a
similar job for a Vietnamese
firm get much less.
U.S. troops are not paid much
by American standards but by
local standards they have money
to burn. Soldiers, even in remote
outposts, frequently have Viet
namese cooks and servants.
While Vietnamese civilians with
near-fatal injuries must be
moved over the rough roads for,
I've heard, as long as nine
hours, U.S. helicopters are in
volved in keeping isolated U.S.
installations stocked with Amer
ican beer. A reporter can, on a
whim, get a helicopter to take
him just about anywhere. When
the Vietnamese minister of wel
fare wanted helicopters to move
rice to refugees threatened with
starvation, he was told they
were all busy fighting the war.
What is involved is America's
profoundly misplaced set of val
ues.
Our soldiers live well here.
Quarters are frequently aircon
ditioned. Booze is plentiful. The
Armed Forces Vietnam Network
operates am, fm, and television
stations throughout the country,
and so it is probable that a sol
dier could come off a patrol,
plop down in his easy chair, pop
a can of beer and watch his fa
vorite cowboy program on the
tube. It really happens. Com
pared with the fairly austere
French, our activity must look
chrome-plated and much more
permanent.
American hegemony in Viet
nam is maintained through con
trol of the Vietnamese govern

ment. Our relationship with the
Thieu-Ky regime is symbiotic.
They couldn't last a day with
out the half-million American
troops here giving them legi
timacy, nor would any other
government allow us to stay.
The election that "legitima
tized" the current regime was
criticized for the wrong reasons.
Sure, there was cheating. But
that was not the crucial element,
according to University of Mis
souri Professor David Wurfel,
who analyzed the election for a
coalition of moderate peace
groups including SANE. The
critical element, making the
election meaningless, was the
disqualification of the only two
candidates, General Minh and
Au Trang Thanh, who repre
sented an alternative and who
were well-enough known to pose
a threat to the incumbants. It
was an election without a choice
and the Constituent Assembly
almost had the courage to in
validate it.
The system of justice also
suffers. People disappear daily
without a trace. Over 5,000 po
litical prisoners languish in the
jails. Political expression is the
most dangerous offense. Last
week the government busted a
vicious 100-peasant-strong "anti-
U.S. whispering campaign." The
peasants were held for over 12
hours for saying unkind things
about America.
The repressive nature of the
regime has polarized Vietnam
ese politics. Wheras there was
once non-violent and diverse op
position to the government, now
there is the simple choice, the
government or the NLF. TTiose
who care about their country
either join the Front or wait un
til it takes over, believing there
will be more freedom then. The
repression has been a boon to
the NLF.

officials explain.
But in truth Vietnam remains
overwhelmingly a military oper
ation with military brass calling
the shots. The excuse is often
made that the Other War can
not really be waged until the
military situation is under con
trol.
The Other War means the bat
tle against the poverty, disease,
and illiteracy which plague Viet
nam. The more sophisticated,
political science-oriented advi
sors here understand the causes
of the Vietnamese civil war.
They realize Vietnamese society
is divided between rich city
dwellers and rural peasants. But
their understanding has not
helped them win the war.
There are a number of fun
damental reasons why the Other
War cannot be won, reasons
which are not considered by the
men waging it. All of the rea
sons are tied up with the ques

tion of our motivation. In the
Administration's eyes helping
the Vietnamese, winning their
"hearts and minds" is a means,
not an end. Dean Rusk, in an
unusual display of candor, has
admitted as much.
Sometimes it seems our real
reason for being in Vietnam is
to deny the Chinese a tradition
al sphere of influence in Asia.
Or perhaps we seek a wider
purpose—to send a message to
revolutionaries throughout the
world—Asian, African, Latin
American; Maoist or Fidelista
—that we will zap them with
our counter-insurgency tech
niques. Underlying this is our
real intent: that the have-nots
will not get what we have with
out a fight, that they might as
well submit to U.S. domination,
enjoy the munificence of our
foreign aid program, and not
cause any trouble.
Simply put, America's idealogy
precludes winning the Other
War. We support the very ele
ments which profit from the
poverty of the Vietnamese peas
ants. Eisenhower and Dulles de
fended U.S. intervention in Viet
nam in the fifties because they

felt the U.S. couldn't afford to
lose valuable natural resources
in Vietnam to the communists.
In fact, only a small but power
ful group of Americans stood to
profit from U.S. involvement, the
major shareholders in the com
panies which process the raw
materials. The American public
was neither harmed nor helped
economically.
The Vietnamese civil war is
an example of class warfare.
Our anti-communist allies there
are the rich upper-class, French
trained element of Vietnamese
society, unrepresentative of the
whole. Their opponents, always
referred to as "Communists" in
our press, although few are

ideologically motivated and all
are nationalists, represent the
aspirations and needs of the
Vietnamese peasantry.
The fundamental contradic
tion of maiming people one day
and patching them up the next
disturbs many sincere, con
cerned Americans working in
Vietnam. These few Americans
like the Vietnamese people,
speak their language, wear Viet
namese dress and work for AID
or for voluntary agencies like
the International Volunteer Ser
vice (IVS). This group is deeply
disturbed about the war.
I met a local AID chief who
was sympathetic with the Viet
namese and who had been suc
cessful in pacifying his area be
cause he was trusted. He agreed
with me when I said our aid
was inauthentic. Vietnamese
also find our aid program an
exercise in duplicity. It is fraud
ulant to drop bombs, create ref
ugees, and expect gratitude
when you feed them.
The Pentagon would prefer
improved relations with the na
tives. The Army handbook
warns soldiers not to abuse Viet
namese women, talk loud, drive
recklessly, or wave their money
around. It says, "Join the peo
ple. Understand their life. Use
phrases from their language.
Honor their customs and laws."
But the racism is too deeply
rooted. Soldiers do insult the
women, run the men off the
road, and turn children into beg
gars.
In a land of poverty (relative
to the U.S., not India), Ameri
can influence causes resentment
and raises expectations beyond
the point at which they can be
fulfilled. American aid person
nel frequently live quite grand
ly, sometimes in former French
villas. Doctors in Quang Ngai
paid $30,000 to rennovate a villa,

then continued to pay $400 a
month rent. Almost any Viet
nam assignment is more lucra
tive than a similar stateside job.
Heavy equipment operators for
the RMK-BRG consortium make
around $2000 a month, far more
than the Vietnamese make in a
year. And Vietnamese doing a
similar job for a Vietnamese
firm get much less.
U.S. troops are not paid much
by American standards but by
local standards they have money
to burn. Soldiers, even in remote
outposts, frequently have Viet
namese cooks and servants.
While Vietnamese civilians with
near-fatal injuries must be
moved over the rough roads for,
I've heard, as long as nine
hours, U.S. helicopters are in
volved in keeping isolated U.S.
installations stocked with Amer
ican beer. A reporter can, on a
whim, get a helicopter to take
him just about anywhere. When
the Vietnamese minister of wel
fare wanted helicopters to move
rice to refugees threatened with
starvation, he was told they
were all busy fighting the war.
What is involved is America's
profoundly misplaced set of val
ues.
Our soldiers live well here.
Quarters are frequently aircon
ditioned. Booze is plentiful. The
Armed Forces Vietnam Network
operates am, fm, and television
stations throughout the country,
and so it is probable that a sol
dier could come off a patrol,
plop down in his easy chair, pop
a can of beer and watch his fa
vorite cowboy program on the
tube. It really happens. Com
pared with the fairly austere
French, our activity must look
chrome-plated and much more
permanent.
American hegemony in Viet
nam is maintained through con
trol of the Vietnamese govern

ment. Our relationship with the
Thieu-Ky regime is symbiotic.
They couldn't last a day with

The election that "legitima

criticized for the wrong reasons.
Sure, there was cheating. But
that was not the crucial element,
according to University of Mis

who analyzed the election for a
coalition of moderate peace
groups including SANE. The
critical element, making the
election meaningless, was the
disqualification of the only two
candidates, General Minh and
Au Trang Thanh, who repre
sented an alternative and who
were well-enough known to pose
a threat to the incumbants. It
was an election without a choice
and the Constituent Assembly
almost had the courage to in
validate it.
The system of justice also
suffers. People disappear daily
without a trace. Over 5,000 po
litical prisoners languish in the
jails. Political expression is the
most dangerous offense. Last
week the government busted a
vicious 100-peasant-strong "anti-
U.S. whispering campaign." The

hours for saying unkind things
about America.

The Other War means the bat

and illiteracy which plague Viet

political science-oriented advi
sors here understand the causes
of the Vietnamese civil war.
They realize Vietnamese society
is divided between rich city
dwellers and rural peasants. But
their understanding has not

There are a number of fun
damental reasons why the Other
War cannot be won, reasons
which are not considered by the
men waging it. All of the rea
sons are tied up with the ques

tion of our motivation. In the
Administration's eyes helping
the Vietnamese, winning their
"hearts and minds" is a means,
not an end. Dean Rusk, in an
unusual display of candor, has
admitted as much.
Sometimes it seems our real
reason for being in Vietnam is
to deny the Chinese a tradition
al sphere of influence in Asia.
Or perhaps we seek a wider
purpose—to send a message to
revolutionaries throughout the
world—Asian, African, Latin
American; Maoist or Fidelista
—that we will zap them with
our counter-insurgency tech
niques. Underlying this is our
real intent: that the have-nots
will not get what we have with
out a fight, that they might as
well submit to U.S. domination,
enjoy the munificence of our
foreign aid program, and not
cause any trouble.
Simply put, America's idealogy
precludes winning the Other
War. We support the very ele
ments which profit from the
poverty of the Vietnamese peas
ants. Eisenhower and Dulles de
fended U.S. intervention in Viet
nam in the fifties because they

felt the U.S. couldn't afford to
lose valuable natural resources
in Vietnam to the communists.
In fact, only a small but power
ful group of Americans stood to
profit from U.S. involvement, the
major shareholders in the com
panies which process the raw
materials. The American public
was neither harmed nor helped
economically.
The Vietnamese civil war is
an example of class warfare.
Our anti-communist allies there
are the rich upper-class, French
trained element of Vietnamese
society, unrepresentative of the
whole. Their opponents, always
referred to as "Communists" in
our press, although few are

ideologically motivated and all
are nationalists, represent the
aspirations and needs of the
Vietnamese peasantry.
The fundamental contradic
tion of maiming people one day
and patching them up the next
disturbs many sincere, con
cerned Americans working in
Vietnam. These few Americans
like the Vietnamese people,
speak their language, wear Viet
namese dress and work for AID
or for voluntary agencies like
the International Volunteer Ser
vice (IVS). This group is deeply
disturbed about the war.
I met a local AID chief who
was sympathetic with the Viet
namese and who had been suc
cessful in pacifying his area be
cause he was trusted. He agreed
with me when I said our aid
was inauthentic. Vietnamese
also find our aid program an
exercise in duplicity. It is fraud
ulant to drop bombs, create ref
ugees, and expect gratitude
when you feed them.
The Pentagon would prefer
improved relations with the na
tives. The Army handbook
warns soldiers not to abuse Viet
namese women, talk loud, drive
recklessly, or wave their money
around. It says, "Join the peo
ple. Understand their life. Use
phrases from their language.
Honor their customs and laws."
But the racism is too deeply
rooted. Soldiers do insult the
women, run the men off the
road, and turn children into beg
gars.
In a land of poverty (relative
to the U.S., not India), Ameri
can influence causes resentment
and raises expectations beyond
the point at which they can be
fulfilled. American aid person
nel frequently live quite grand
ly, sometimes in former French
villas. Doctors in Quang Ngai
paid $30,000 to rennovate a villa,

then continued to pay $400 a
month rent. Almost any Viet
nam assignment is more lucra
tive than a similar stateside job.
Heavy equipment operators for
the RMK-BRG consortium make
around $2000 a month, far more
than the Vietnamese make in a
year. And Vietnamese doing a
similar job for a Vietnamese
firm get much less.
U.S. troops are not paid much
by American standards but by
local standards they have money
to burn. Soldiers, even in remote
outposts, frequently have Viet
namese cooks and servants.
While Vietnamese civilians with
near-fatal injuries must be
moved over the rough roads for,
I've heard, as long as nine
hours, U.S. helicopters are in
volved in keeping isolated U.S.
installations stocked with Amer
ican beer. A reporter can, on a
whim, get a helicopter to take
him just about anywhere. When
the Vietnamese minister of wel
fare wanted helicopters to move
rice to refugees threatened with
starvation, he was told they
were all busy fighting the war.
What is involved is America's
profoundly misplaced set of val
ues.
Our soldiers live well here.
Quarters are frequently aircon
ditioned. Booze is plentiful. The
Armed Forces Vietnam Network
operates am, fm, and television
stations throughout the country,
and so it is probable that a sol
dier could come off a patrol,
plop down in his easy chair, pop
a can of beer and watch his fa
vorite cowboy program on the
tube. It really happens. Com
pared with the fairly austere
French, our activity must look
chrome-plated and much more
permanent.
American hegemony in Viet
nam is maintained through con
trol of the Vietnamese govern

ment. Our relationship with the
Thieu-Ky regime is symbiotic.
They couldn't last a day with

The election that "legitima

criticized for the wrong reasons.
Sure, there was cheating. But
that was not the crucial element,
according to University of Mis

who analyzed the election for a
coalition of moderate peace
groups including SANE. The
critical element, making the
election meaningless, was the
disqualification of the only two
candidates, General Minh and
Au Trang Thanh, who repre
sented an alternative and who
were well-enough known to pose
a threat to the incumbants. It
was an election without a choice
and the Constituent Assembly
almost had the courage to in
validate it.
The system of justice also
suffers. People disappear daily
without a trace. Over 5,000 po
litical prisoners languish in the
jails. Political expression is the
most dangerous offense. Last
week the government busted a
vicious 100-peasant-strong "anti-
U.S. whispering campaign." The

hours for saying unkind things
about America.

They realize Vietnamese society
is divided between rich city
dwellers and rural peasants. But
their understanding has not
helped them win the war.
There are a number of fun
damental reasons why the Other
War cannot be won, reasons
which are not considered by the
men waging it. All of the rea
sons are tied up with the ques

tion of our motivation. In the
Administration's eyes helping
the Vietnamese, winning their
"hearts and minds" is a means,
not an end. Dean Rusk, in an
unusual display of candor, has
admitted as much.
Sometimes it seems our real
reason for being in Vietnam is
to deny the Chinese a tradition
al sphere of influence in Asia.
Or perhaps we seek a wider
purpose—to send a message to
revolutionaries throughout the
world—Asian, African, Latin
American; Maoist or Fidelista
—that we will zap them with
our counter-insurgency tech
niques. Underlying this is our
real intent: that the have-nots
will not get what we have with
out a fight, that they might as
well submit to U.S. domination,
enjoy the munificence of our
foreign aid program, and not
cause any trouble.
Simply put, America's idealogy
precludes winning the Other
War. We support the very ele
ments which profit from the
poverty of the Vietnamese peas
ants. Eisenhower and Dulles de
fended U.S. intervention in Viet
nam in the fifties because they

felt the U.S. couldn't afford to
lose valuable natural resources
in Vietnam to the communists.
In fact, only a small but power
ful group of Americans stood to
profit from U.S. involvement, the
major shareholders in the com
panies which process the raw
materials. The American public
was neither harmed nor helped
economically.
The Vietnamese civil war is
an example of class warfare.
Our anti-communist allies there
are the rich upper-class, French
trained element of Vietnamese
society, unrepresentative of the
whole. Their opponents, always
referred to as "Communists" in
our press, although few are

ideologically motivated and all
are nationalists, represent the
aspirations and needs of the
Vietnamese peasantry.
The fundamental contradic
tion of maiming people one day
and patching them up the next
disturbs many sincere, con
cerned Americans working in
Vietnam. These few Americans
like the Vietnamese people,
speak their language, wear Viet
namese dress and work for AID
or for voluntary agencies like
the International Volunteer Ser
vice (IVS). This group is deeply
disturbed about the war.
I met a local AID chief who
was sympathetic with the Viet
namese and who had been suc
cessful in pacifying his area be
cause he was trusted. He agreed
with me when I said our aid
was inauthentic. Vietnamese
also find our aid program an
exercise in duplicity. It is fraud
ulant to drop bombs, create ref
ugees, and expect gratitude
when you feed them.
The Pentagon would prefer
improved relations with the na
tives. The Army handbook
warns soldiers not to abuse Viet
namese women, talk loud, drive
recklessly, or wave their money
around. It says, "Join the peo
ple. Understand their life. Use
phrases from their language.
Honor their customs and laws."
But the racism is too deeply
rooted. Soldiers do insult the
women, run the men off the
road, and turn children into beg
gars.
In a land of poverty (relative
to the U.S., not India), Ameri
can influence causes resentment
and raises expectations beyond
the point at which they can be
fulfilled. American aid person
nel frequently live quite grand
ly, sometimes in former French
villas. Doctors in Quang Ngai
paid $30,000 to rennovate a villa,

then continued to pay $400 a
month rent. Almost any Viet
nam assignment is more lucra
tive than a similar stateside job.
Heavy equipment operators for
the RMK-BRG consortium make
around $2000 a month, far more
than the Vietnamese make in a
year. And Vietnamese doing a
similar job for a Vietnamese
firm get much less.
U.S. troops are not paid much
by American standards but by
local standards they have money
to burn. Soldiers, even in remote
outposts, frequently have Viet
namese cooks and servants.
While Vietnamese civilians with
near-fatal injuries must be
moved over the rough roads for,
I've heard, as long as nine
hours, U.S. helicopters are in
volved in keeping isolated U.S.
installations stocked with Amer
ican beer. A reporter can, on a
whim, get a helicopter to take
him just about anywhere. When
the Vietnamese minister of wel
fare wanted helicopters to move
rice to refugees threatened with
starvation, he was told they
were all busy fighting the war.
What is involved is America's
profoundly misplaced set of val
ues.
Our soldiers live well here.
Quarters are frequently aircon
ditioned. Booze is plentiful. The
Armed Forces Vietnam Network
operates am, fm, and television
stations throughout the country,
and so it is probable that a sol
dier could come off a patrol,
plop down in his easy chair, pop
a can of beer and watch his fa
vorite cowboy program on the
tube. It really happens. Com
pared with the fairly austere
French, our activity must look
chrome-plated and much more
permanent.
American hegemony in Viet
nam is maintained through con
trol of the Vietnamese govern

ment. Our relationship with the
Thieu-Ky regime is symbiotic.
They couldn't last a day with
out the half-million American
troops here giving them legi
timacy, nor would any other
government allow us to stay.
The election that "legitima
tized" the current regime was
criticized for the wrong reasons.
Sure, there was cheating. But
that was not the crucial element,
according to University of Mis
souri Professor David Wurfel,
who analyzed the election for a
coalition of moderate peace
groups including SANE. The
critical element, making the
election meaningless, was the
disqualification of the only two
candidates, General Minh and
Au Trang Thanh, who repre
sented an alternative and who
were well-enough known to pose
a threat to the incumbants. It
was an election without a choice
and the Constituent Assembly
almost had the courage to in
validate it.
The system of justice also
suffers. People disappear daily
without a trace. Over 5,000 po
litical prisoners languish in the
jails. Political expression is the
most dangerous offense. Last
week the government busted a
vicious 100-peasant-strong "anti-
U.S. whispering campaign." The
peasants were held for over 12
hours for saying unkind things
about America.
The repressive nature of the
regime has polarized Vietnam
ese politics. Wheras there was
once non-violent and diverse op
position to the government, now
there is the simple choice, the
government or the NLF. TTiose
who care about their country
either join the Front or wait un
til it takes over, believing there
will be more freedom then. The
repression has been a boon to
the NLF.
SAIGON (CPS)—The war in
Vietnam is really two wars: one
military and the other socio
economic, and the two must be
fought together, administration
officials explain.
But in truth Vietnam remains
overwhelmingly a military oper
ation with military brass calling
the shots. The excuse is often
made that the Other War can
not really be waged until the
military situation is under con
trol.
The Other War means the bat

and illiteracy which plague Viet
