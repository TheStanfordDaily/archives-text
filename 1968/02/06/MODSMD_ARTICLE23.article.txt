# Class Scheduling System Expands To National Use
## 
### 
The Stanford School of Sched
uling System (SSSS), better
known as flexible scheduling,
will be placed in the public do
main by the end of June this
year, Prof. Robert V. Oakford
told a convention of Illinois ed
ucators here.
Oakford, professor of indus
trial engineering here, told the
conference that the system has
already been translated into
"FORTRAN," a computer lan
guage suitable for the IBM
360-50 computer and that "test
ing and debugging" is in pro
cess.
This is because there Ls
widespread use of this type
of computer language, he ex
plained, adding that the
changeover has been assisted
by the University of lowa.
Additionally, the Oregon To
tal Information Service has
indicated it will also provide
the SSSS system to the
schools it serves.
Oakford played a key role in
the development four years ago
of the flexible scheduling sys
tem by translating it for use
after it was devised by Profs.
Robert N. Bush and Dwight W.
Allen of the Stanford School of
Education.
"Flexible scheduling" gets its
name from Bush and Allen's
method of tailoring class time
to the needs of the subject, the
students and the teachers â€”
"scheduling class meeting in
time and space so that the ed
ucational objectives of the
school can be achieved."
From building schedules for

four high schools in 1963, the
system has grown in popularity
and use until 200 schools in the
U.S. and overseas are now using
it, he revealed.
Oakford predicted that la
ter this year other universi
ties as well as commercial
data processing services will
adopt the SSSS system, mak
ing it available "on a rather
widespread basis."
"My personal guess is that the
educational process will main
tain the class as an important
instructional unit and efforts to
individualize the process will
make the scheduling more, rath
er than less, complicated."
