# Clerics Indict U.S. For â€˜War Crimes'
## 
### 
Twenty-nine prominent Prot
estant, Roman Catholic and
Jewish clergymen have re
leased a statement charging that
American conduct in Vietnam
has been marked by "consist
ent violation of almost every
international agreement relat
ing to the rules of warfare."
The 6,000-word document is
contained in a 420-page volume
published by Clergy and Lay
men Concerned About Vietnam,
a two-year-old interfaith organ
ization that is opposed to Amer
ican policies in Southeast Asia.
The volume, entitled "In the

Name of America"and bear
ing a red, white and blue
cover, contains 16 chapters re
lating to such subjects as the
treatment of prisoners of war,
the use of napalm, the destruc
tion of huts and villages and
the care of refugees.
At the head of each chapter
are citations from the Hague
and Geneva Convention on the
rules of modern warfare. These
are followed by excerpted re
ports from newspapers, wire
services, books and magazines
that describe or comment upon
alleged violations of these laws.
In the introductory commen
tary the 29 clergymen declare
that the documentation "does
not purport to be a legal brief."
They state, however: "There is
a legal case to be made against
our actions in Vietnam and it
is, we believe, a devastating
one."
At a news conference last
week, the Rev. Dr. John C. Ben
nett, president of Union Theol
ogical Seminary and one of the
signers, said that despite the
quasi-legal format of the book,
its primary purpose is "an ap
peal to conscience."
"I believe that our Govern
ment for the most part has good
intentions," he declared, "but
the weapons and technology
they have at their control have
gotten out of hand. The de
struction that we are causing
in South Vietnam is clearly dis
proportionate to our original
purpose of trying to help the
people of South Vietnam."
Officials at the Pentagon last
week deferred to the State De
partment for comment on the
book. In an interview, a State
Department spokesman who
had reviewed the volume said
that the allegations of war
crimes by American forces were
"absolutely unsupportable."
