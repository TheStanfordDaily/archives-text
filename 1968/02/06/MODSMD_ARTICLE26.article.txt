## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Eighteen members of a pro
fessional journalism fellowship
program at Stanford have
signed a letter agreeing to boy
cott a restaurant because of "of
fensive racist symbols in its
decorations, advertising and pro
motional material."
The letter was sent to John
Rickey, owner of the restaurant
"Dinah's Shack," in Palo Alto.
The signers of the letter had
used the restaurant for dinner
seminars. In the letter to Rickey
they also agreed "not to patron
ize your establishment individ
ually."
The letter objected to "the
use of the slave statuettes and
the bandanna-clad black "mam
my" as the perpetuation of a
stereotype that is extremely
offensive to both black and
white people who are interested
in promoting equality and har
mony."
Ringing' the parking lot of
the establishment are a group
of statues of black slave boys
holding lanterns. The symbol
of the restaurant Is a black
"mammy." Her Image Is pic
tured on a large sign above
the restaurant and on Its nap
kins and matchbooks.
Rickey defended the sign
and the statuary saying that
objecting to the symbols of
slavery does not solve what he
considers the main problem for
the Negroes, jobs.
He also said that the Na
tional Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People
(NAACP) had objected to his
restaurant's use of the "mam
my" image two years ago but
withdrew the objection.
According to Rickey, the ob
jection was withdrawn because
the national office of the
NAACP changed its policy, say
ing that it would not seek to
obliterate symbols of the slave
era because it is a legitimate
part of Negro history.
Nolan Davis, the only black
member of the group signing
the letter said that "slavery
Ls a part of black history but
the statues aren't." He said

that he also objected to the
"proliferation of the symbols"
on the restaurant's matches,
napkins, and advertising.
"When I signed that piece of
paper, I felt like I was signing
the Declaration of Indepen
dence," Davis concluded.
The letter followed another
letter written by the fellow
ship program's director Herbert
Brucker. He stated that the sym
bols of slavery were "an ana
chronism" because of "explosive
social changes."
Brucker said that he was not
demanding anything be done
about the symbols, but that he
was just informing Rickey why
he would no longer make use of
his establishment.
Malcolm Cross, one of the
drafters of the second letter
said that the boycott was under
taken because of "our personal
reaction to it."
There are twenty members of
the fellowship program who are
currently in residence in the
area.

that he also objected to the
"proliferation of the symbols"
on the restaurant's matches,
napkins, and advertising.
"When I signed that piece of
paper, I felt like I was signing
the Declaration of Indepen
dence," Davis concluded.
The letter followed another
letter written by the fellow
ship program's director Herbert
Brucker. He stated that the sym
bols of slavery were "an ana
chronism" because of "explosive
social changes."
Brucker said that he was not
demanding anything be done
about the symbols, but that he
was just informing Rickey why
he would no longer make use of
his establishment.
Malcolm Cross, one of the
drafters of the second letter
said that the boycott was under
taken because of "our personal
reaction to it."
There are twenty members of
the fellowship program who are
currently in residence in the

LITTLE BLACK WHO? The
man with the lantern above is
the cause for a professional
journalists' boycott of Dinah's
Shack. The journalists object to
the racial stereotype of the sta
tue.
Eighteen members of a pro
fessional journalism fellowship
program at Stanford have
signed a letter agreeing to boy
cott a restaurant because of "of
fensive racist symbols in its
decorations, advertising and pro
motional material."
The letter was sent to John
Rickey, owner of the restaurant
"Dinah's Shack," in Palo Alto.
The signers of the letter had
used the restaurant for dinner
seminars. In the letter to Rickey
they also agreed "not to patron
ize your establishment individ
ually."
The letter objected to "the
use of the slave statuettes and
the bandanna-clad black "mam
my" as the perpetuation of a
stereotype that is extremely
offensive to both black and
white people who are interested
in promoting equality and har
mony."
Ringing' the parking lot of
the establishment are a group
of statues of black slave boys
holding lanterns. The symbol
of the restaurant Is a black
"mammy." Her Image Is pic
tured on a large sign above
the restaurant and on Its nap
kins and matchbooks.
Rickey defended the sign
and the statuary saying that
objecting to the symbols of
slavery does not solve what he
considers the main problem for
the Negroes, jobs.
He also said that the Na
tional Association for the Ad
vancement of Colored People
(NAACP) had objected to his
restaurant's use of the "mam
my" image two years ago but
withdrew the objection.
According to Rickey, the ob
jection was withdrawn because
the national office of the
NAACP changed its policy, say
ing that it would not seek to
obliterate symbols of the slave
era because it is a legitimate
part of Negro history.
Nolan Davis, the only black
member of the group signing
the letter said that "slavery
Ls a part of black history but
the statues aren't." He said

that he also objected to the
"proliferation of the symbols"
on the restaurant's matches,
napkins, and advertising.
"When I signed that piece of
