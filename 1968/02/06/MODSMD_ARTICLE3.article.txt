# The 						Coffeehouse Movement
## Disjoint Seeks Home 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
coffeehouse (kofi-hous') n. a
place of public entertainment
where coffee and other refresh
ments are served: in the 17th
and 18th centuries coffeehouses
were gathering places of liter
ary men, etc.
That's what a coffeehouse is,
says Webster's, and that's what
Stanford needs but hasn't got,
according to many concerned
students, faculty and staff.
"A coffeehouse should be a
kind of informal meeting
place, with an atmosphere dif
ferent from classes or dorms,
where people can just come
and talk or listen to music,"
Greg Yahna says wistfully.
He is manager of "Disjoint,"
one of Stanford's assorted ap
proximations of the ideal coffee
house. Although Disjoint has had
some popularity, Yahna is the
first to admit that its location
in Memorial Union
presents insurmountable prob
lems.
Disjoint is secreted in a cor
ner of the Tersidder dining room
behind partitions. The entrance
in the r ar of Tresidder is har.i
to find, Yahna complains. Whon
he opens it Wednesday, Thurs
day and Friday night, Yahn l
must set up the chairs and stack
them again at closing. "That
takes about half an hour."

Without running water or
kitchen facilities, Yahna's Dis
joint can serve only coffee and
doughnuts. Despite the lure of
a piano, mystic lighting and
student entertainers, Disjoint
needs a $200 subsidy from the
dean of the chap 1 to pay its
costs.
Coffeehouse crusaders want to
dissociate Disjoint from Tresid
der, whose efficient plastic at
mosphere they find depressing.
As a result, a vigorous
search 1s underway to find a
better location for an all-night
meeting place where "Stanford
people can go and just be in a
situation where they can real
ly talk to one another," in the
words of Senior Janet Cox,
the movement's sparkplug
since 1966.
The search hasn't been easy.
Among competing demands for,
space, "There is no priority low
er than ours," Miss Cox laments.
Yahna's favorite site for his
coffeehouse would be in the
basement lounge of the Wom
en's Clubhouse, a sandstone
building on the northern side of
White Plaza. A Friday night
YWCA coffeehouse actually ex
isted there two years ago on a
trial basis, according to Mrs.
Harold Bacon, a member of the
Clubhouse advisory board, but
"eventually it was abandoned.

The problem was one of cleanup
and attendance," she explained.
"They said you had to have
a coffeehouse open every night."
And that is not possible, Mrs.
Bacon explains. "Our building
is in too constant use. "We're
scheduling so many clubs and
groups there." The spacious
lounge? and adjoining kitchen are
used every day for a luncheon
by a women's group or religious
organization, such as Hillel. Oc
casionally night suppers are pre
pared.
Perhaps the coffeehouse could
take over the lounge only at
night?
"A coffeehouse has prob
lems of sanitation and noise,"
Mrs. Bacon comments. "At the
moment these problems are
insurmountable."
The Dean of Students' office,
which technically owns the Club
house, sounded out the women's
advisory board last year about
using the lounge and received
these objections and others. The
unavailability of the Clubhouse
was particularly disappointing to
the coffeehouse advocates, be
cause the basement lounge has
everything the temporary site
in Tresidder lacks — atmos
phere, permanence, kitchen fa
cilities, and toilets.
A 1967 report by the Univer
sity Student Affairs and Services
Committee said the present site
"has practical disadvantages and
its future is uncertain." An al
ternative site deserving "serious
consideration," the committee
said, was the Clubhouse lounge.
Undaunted, the search for
a coffeehouse site continues
with the aid of B. Davie Na
pier, dean of the chapel, Bar
bara Dray, assistant to the
Dean of Students, Dwight
Clark, head of Volunteers in
Asia, and Ken Cooper, direc
tor of the International Center.
Among the sites which have
been considered are:
The basement of Meyer Li
brary (UGLY): This spacious,
two story cavern was investigat

ed but claimed by the library as
storage space for overflow books
from the Main Library.
The boathouse: Although sit
uated next to a picturesque dry
lake bed, this rickety wooden
structure would cost too much
to be renovated.
Harmony house: This attrac
tive yellow stucco house on Lo
mita Drive near Roble is Miss
Cox's favorite. "It's just really
fabulous," she says enthusiastic
ally. But Harmony house is pres
ently used by the music depart
ment for office space and student
practice. The tenants show no de
sire to move.
The basement of the Interna
tional Center: A coffeehouse
here would kill two birds with
one stone, to twist a metaphor.
Foreign students would have ex
cellent opportunities to mingle
with Americans. "Loyal donors
have realized there is a definite
need on campus for a coffee
house," says Cooper.
But the basement is undevel
oped. Unlike the Clubhouse or
UGLY basement, expensive ex
cavation and renovation would
be required. No plans for a cof
feehouse in the I-Center arje be
yond the talking stage, Cooper
says.
Without a permanet facility,
various groups are trying to
fill the coffeehouse gap. Be
sides Yahna's thrice-weekly
Disjoint, a coffeehouse thrives
in the basement of Wilbur hall.
Named the "Jester," this faci
lity is open 9 p.m. to midnight
every night except Sunday,
serving light refreshments.
The Jester is frequented most
ly by freshmen.
Although the UGLY basement
is unavailable, a proposal has

been made to conver.t the ground
floor into a snack-bar delica
tessen. Pete Hansen, resident
assistant in Durand house, hopes
to convert the vending machine
room into a food counter and
set up tables in the spacious
lobby. It wouldn't be a coffee
house, Hansen admits, but it
would provide a "place to get
away and have a little break.
We'd like to put in a little at
mosphere." Approval is still
needed from the library and Uni
versity food service.
But the adherants to the cof
feehouse movement will continue
their quest until they find an
attractive, conveniently located
site that can remain open all
night, every night.
A coffeehouse car't be any
where, Miss Cox emphasizes.
"It's a state of mind. It really
depends on a crowded room with
a low ceiling . . . it's a physical
thing. It depends on the lack of
empty air around you. You're
with the people in the room."

COFFEEHOUSE IN ACTION — Manager Greg Yahna talks with patron Jeff Browning (right)
and others recently at "Dis joint," the thrice-weekly coffeehouse in Tresidder. Every night Yahna and
helpers must stack up the tables and chairs In his cramped, isolated quarters. During the day the
area is part of Tresidder's main dining room.
