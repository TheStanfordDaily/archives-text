### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
coffeehouse (kofi-hous') n. a
place of public entertainment
where coffee and other refresh
ments are served: in the 17th
and 18th centuries coffeehouses
were gathering places of liter
ary men, etc.
That's what a coffeehouse is,
says Webster's, and that's what
Stanford needs but hasn't got,
according to many concerned
students, faculty and staff.
"A coffeehouse should be a
kind of informal meeting
place, with an atmosphere dif
ferent from classes or dorms,
where people can just come
and talk or listen to music,"
Greg Yahna says wistfully.
He is manager of "Disjoint,"
one of Stanford's assorted ap
proximations of the ideal coffee
house. Although Disjoint has had
some popularity, Yahna is the
first to admit that its location
in Memorial Union
presents insurmountable prob
lems.
Disjoint is secreted in a cor
ner of the Tersidder dining room
behind partitions. The entrance
in the r ar of Tresidder is har.i
to find, Yahna complains. Whon
he opens it Wednesday, Thurs
day and Friday night, Yahn l
must set up the chairs and stack
them again at closing. "That
takes about half an hour."

Without running water or
kitchen facilities, Yahna's Dis
joint can serve only coffee and
doughnuts. Despite the lure of
a piano, mystic lighting and
student entertainers, Disjoint
needs a $200 subsidy from the
dean of the chap 1 to pay its
costs.
Coffeehouse crusaders want to
dissociate Disjoint from Tresid
der, whose efficient plastic at
mosphere they find depressing.
As a result, a vigorous
search 1s underway to find a
better location for an all-night
meeting place where "Stanford
people can go and just be in a
situation where they can real
ly talk to one another," in the
words of Senior Janet Cox,
the movement's sparkplug
since 1966.
The search hasn't been easy.
Among competing demands for,
space, "There is no priority low
er than ours," Miss Cox laments.
Yahna's favorite site for his
coffeehouse would be in the
basement lounge of the Wom
en's Clubhouse, a sandstone
building on the northern side of
White Plaza. A Friday night
YWCA coffeehouse actually ex
isted there two years ago on a
trial basis, according to Mrs.
Harold Bacon, a member of the
Clubhouse advisory board, but
"eventually it was abandoned.

The problem was one of cleanup
and attendance," she explained.
"They said you had to have
a coffeehouse open every night."
And that is not possible, Mrs.
Bacon explains. "Our building
is in too constant use. "We're
scheduling so many clubs and
groups there." The spacious
lounge? and adjoining kitchen are
