# Political Satirist
## Art Hoppe Here This Week 
### 
Art Hoppe, famed political
pundit for the San Francisco
Chronicle, begins a three-day
visit to Stanford as a Stern
Guest-in-Residence this after
noon. His schedule includes a
talk on contemporary politics in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium tomor
row at 7:45 p.m. entitled, "The
Urgent Need for TOTAL Birth
Control."
Hoppe, who graduated cum
laude from Harvard, is perhaps
the most avidly read political
commentator in California jour
nalism.
His satire ranges across every
borndary, polite as well as polit
ical, from the tourist propensi
ties of Americans to their habit
of dropping bombs on towns
and villages where they explode
and kill and also on unpopulated
icebergs where they don't ex
plode.
For four hours a day, the time
it takes him to write a column,
Art Hoppe takes a verbal ad
venture, meant to prostrate as
well as please us. Hoppe pre
sents an approach to living, a
style, that lets us discover the
compromises, sometimes hypo
critical, sometimes not, around
which we have built our daily
lives. He goes about the daily
business of painting reality with
the mundane glibness of a flirt
ing male. He taunts, but never
teases.
His schedule is:
Tues., Feb. 6, 5:30 p.m., Recep
tion in Mr. Leland's apartment.
6:15, Dinner in Fremont. 7:00,
Informal Discussion in Holladay
Lounge.

p.m., Informal Discussion in

troduction by Prof Breitrose.
Thurs., Feb. 8, 11:00 Guest at
Prof. Rivers' class, "Forms of
Journalistic Writing," 3:15, In
formal Discussion in Mu i r
Lounge.

His satire ranges across every
borndary, polite as well as polit
ical, from the tourist propensi
ties of Americans to their habit
of dropping bombs on towns
and villages where they explode
and kill and also on unpopulated
icebergs where they don't ex
plode.
For four hours a day, the time
it takes him to write a column,
Art Hoppe takes a verbal ad
venture, meant to prostrate as
well as please us. Hoppe pre
sents an approach to living, a
style, that lets us discover the
compromises, sometimes hypo
critical, sometimes not, around
which we have built our daily
lives. He goes about the daily
business of painting reality with
the mundane glibness of a flirt
ing male. He taunts, but never
teases.
His schedule is:
Tues., Feb. 6, 5:30 p.m., Recep
tion in Mr. Leland's apartment.
6:15, Dinner in Fremont. 7:00,
