# Drastic Reductions
## Fellowship Grants Cutback 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
The war in Vietnam has cut
heavily into non-military gov
ernment spending, and one hard
hit area is government-sup
ported fellowships.
National Defense Education
Act (NDEA) and National
Aeronautics and Space Admini
stration (NASA) grants have
been drastically reduced, and
Stanford will not be left out of
the squeeze.
NASA fellowships, which
Stanford received at the rate
of six to ten new grants per
year, each award lasting for
a three-year period, will be
completely eliminated, except
for those presently in exist
ence.
Last year, about 750 new
NASA fellowships were award
ed. Only 75 will be issued this
September, however.
"The very few they have left
are going to be used in a special

new program for traineeships in
engineering design," according
to Larry Wise, associate dean
of engineering.
Wise said Stanford received
five new awards this past year
in this special field, "and the
clear implication is that we will
receive some for next year, per
haps five again,' 'he said.
New regular fellowships are
completely "wiped out," how
ever, Wise noted. "The ones we
had previously received are all
three-year awards, however, and
we will be able to continue them
for the last one or two years."
NDEA fellowships have
been cut almost in half to
slightly more than 3,000. Stan
ford will suffer a proportional
cut.
The school had been receiving
the maximum number of
awards, 85, and will be getting
the maximum under the new
system, according to Virgil

Whitaker, dean of the graduate
division.
But the new top is only 45.
NDEA awards had been used
with money from a $4 million
Ford Foundation grant for
fellowships in the humanities
and social sciences.
Whitaker said that he plans
to "gamble" that the cut will
be restored in the next year or
so, and continue support in
these areas at the same level as
before, using regular Univers
ity funds to make up the dif
ference.
None of the NDEA grants
go to physical science or en
gineering. According to Wise,
Harvard "Is the only other
premier engineering school"
without NDEA fellowships.
National Science Foundation
(NSF) fellowships are also be
ing reduced, from 1,200 awards
to 700, but the slack is more
than taken up by an increase in
traineeships.
A fellowship is awarded by

the foundation, while trainee
ships are given out by the
schools.
But, overall, the amount of
government monny will be much
reduced. "It's going to hurt,"
Wise said.
The effect on graduate stu
dents will not be very severe,
however. Only one-third of the
support for graduates here
comes from government coffers,
and another third of the stu
dents acting as research and
teaching assistants.
The remainder have indus
trial fellowships, have their edu
cation paid for by the company
for which they are working, or
pay their own way.
The loss of funds in itself will
not stop the recent rapid growth
of the graduate schools, Whit
aker said. The reason for this is
that it had previously been de
cided "not to increase graduate
enrollment, trying to keep a bal
ance between the number of
grads and undergrads," he said.
