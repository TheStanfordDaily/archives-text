# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Do Politics Save Westmoreland? 
### Drew Pearson 
Friends of Lyndon Johnson
have been concerned over the
possibility that personal loyalty
plus the experienced eye he
keeps on Capitol Hill will put
him in a position where he will
not relieve Gen. William West
moreland as commander in Viet
nam.
One reeison for the efficiency
of World War II was the fact
that Gen. George Marshall, mili
tary genius of that war, re
lieved or fired 19 generals, some
times even during battle.
Gen. George Patton, a great
combat soldier, was relieved for
slapping a sick soldier in Sicily.
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur was
abruptly fired by President Tru
man, and the war in Korea went
far better under Gen. Matt
Ridgeway who replaced him.

Gen. Walker Short and Ad
miral H. E. Kimmel were re
lieved and disciplined by Presi
dent Roosevelt for failure to be
on the alert at Pearl Harbor.
However, Gen. Westmoreland,
who was caught badly off base
last week in Saigon despite ad
vance notice of the exact day of
attack, seems likely to retain his
command.
McNamara Differs
This is not the first time the
handsome commander has been
under fire. Secretary of Defense
McNamara has had very defin
ite policy differences with him
over his use of troops and has
voiced criticism within the
White House and the Defense
Department. His points of dif
ference involved:
1. Failure to transfer Ameri

can troops from housekeeping
chores to the front lines. This
would obviate sending so many
U.S. troops to South Vietnam
McNamara argued.
2. Using more South Vietna
mese troops and requiring the
Vietnamese to arrest their draft
dodgers, of whom there are
about 90,000 roaming the streets
of Saigon.
3. Training South Vietnamese
troops in guerrilla warfare rath
er than in conventional warfare.
4. Swamping South Vietnam
with so many troops, which Mc-
Namara claimed upset the local
economy and increased resent
ment against the United States.
These differences, never
acrimonious, have been ex
pressed over more than a year.
On March 12 last year, Presi

dent Johnson flew to Guam for
a series of conferences with
Westmoreland, taking with him
Gen. Bruce Palmer, the com
mander who did such a brilliant
Job in the Dominican Republic.
It was planned to replace West
moreland with either Palmer or
Gen. Creighton Abrams, deputy
chief of staff, not because of the
above differences, but because
he had served more than two
years. It is routine to relieve a
commander after a two-year
hitch, and Westmoreland de
served a rest.
However, something changed
this transfer.
It's suspected that one reason
was politics. Westmoreland hap
pens to come from South Caro

lina. So does one of the most
powerful men on Capitol Hill,
Rep. Mendel Rivers, chairman
of the House Armed Services
Committee; so also does another
vocal and influential hawk, Sen.
Strom Thurmond, a major gen
eral in the Army Reserve. Both
are dedicated, determined de
fenders of their fellow South
Carolinian.
So, despite the fact that the
Viet Cong conquest of pockets
of Saigon including the Ameri
can embassy has become a sub
ject of snickering conversation
among even our allies, it's
likely that Gen. Westmoreland
will remain.
