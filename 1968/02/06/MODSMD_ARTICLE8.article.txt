## Stanford: An Emotional Void? 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
The findings of the Pace Stu
( dies on Stanford reported In
b last Wednesday's Daily suggest
that students in general here are
defeating themselves. The stu
dies indicate also there are
means by which the Administra
tion might help us to get out of
the mess.
That we should rank in the top
two per cent of the nation's stu
dents in the "search for per
sonal, poetic, and political mean
ing in life," while at the same
time striving for "isolated and
competitive achievement," points
to the unfortunate paradox of
? our lives.
There seems to be little to
which we all can relate. The
centralistic symbols of Stanford
more often than not incur our
* resentment or ridicule.
One thing we all can relate to
1 — the Honor Code — temporar-
I ily gives us an emotional charge
as we fulfill the trust involved.
But, while noble, the Code is
nothing more than that, honor—
and where is the love to be
found?
From the emotional void at
the center, most of us have
moved out — our attachements
are not to the abstract "Stan
ford" but to scattered individuals
— professors or classmates — or
a living group. While this "psy
chological regionalism" may be

said to be the "ethos" of Stan
ford, is this what we want?
What about "this relative lack
of paternalism at Stanford?" It's
clear that a majority of stu
dents reject traditional "in loco
parentis."
But do they reject as well the
personal, attentive, and cooper
ative guidance of the ideal par
ent?
I believe the Administration
has an obligation to find the
answer to this question. They
may be surprised at how much
they're wanted.

Homosexual Group—
An Allowable Activity?
Editor, The Dally:
(In regards to your article of
last Friday on the new homo
sexual group at Stanford): This
sort of CRAP is permissable on
a campus, such as Stanford's?
What the hell sort of a Univer
sity do you have guys have
there?
Cavorting in the aisles of our
Memorial Church is tough

enough on responsible and rea
sonable Church People, but
THIS sordid sort of thing is a
medical problem, as well as a
social problem.
These guys aggravate and ex
aggerate their personal import
ance, any many of us resent this.
Yes, we understand what's going
on with these two-sexed "mor
ons."
Each to his own, but it's not
up to SOCIETY to accept these
people who can't get it out of
their minds that a zipper has to
be open all the time.
OLD TIMER
Daily Opinion Column
Draws Sharp Criticism
Editor, The Daily:
I ask you to convey my sym
pathy to Jan Kerr Eckbo who
apparently suffered brain dam
age in his experience with the
"legalized killers" of our society.
I suggest he write no more
articles for The Daily until his
mind is better able to function.
