The Depravity of Man
It should be obvious to most of us today that people aren t all that good.
In spite of notable achievements in arts, science and industry human nature
seems never to really be changed. Better education, more freedom and leisure,
the advances of civilization are apparently accompanied by more riots, war,
suicide, divorce, crime and injustice. World crises today suggest the very real
possibility of thermonuclear holocaust. Experts have said the starvation of 500
millions in the next few years can not be forestalled.
The easy way out is to forget these problems which no one can solve and
to quietly live a self-centered existence in pursuit of pleasure or long-term
self gain. But even personally and individually no one avoids death, and we
never know when time will run out. Even when our own local macrocosm runs
smoothly all of us know deep down inside we aren't what we ought to be
and might actually be missing out on real life somehow.
The New Testament is a very upsetting book to read these days because
it so honestly tells men what they are like inside. If openly exposes the cause
of our problems which is our independence and rebellion against the Creator
who brought us into existence. The Bible says,"The Wrath of God is revealed
from heaven against all ungodliness and wickedness of men who by their
wickedness suppress the truth . . . although they knew God they did not honor
him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking and
their senseless minds were darkened . . . and since they did not see fit to
acknowledge God, God game them up to a base mind and to improper con
duct. They were filled with all manner of wickedness, evil, covetousness,
malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deciet, malignity, they are gossips, slander
ers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient
to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless . . (Romans 1)
Totally depraved? Yes, apparently we are. But God loves us anyway, in spite
of what we do and what we are. God's cure for our sin is Jesus Christ. In his
deep love for mankind, Christ fully identifies with each of us, and in fact has
already given his life in exchange for ours: "God shows his love for us in
that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8). The love,
forgiveness and fresh start which God offrs men today is available simply by
asking God directly. He accepts you as you are. God is in the business of re
building lives from the ground floor up. You owe it to yourself to check this
out not just in theory but in actual experience like the rest of us do.
