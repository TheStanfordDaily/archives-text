# SES Report Urges More Coeducational Dorms
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
More coeducational houses should be
created next year, the Residence com
mittee of the Study of Education (SES)
recommends in a preliminary report on
campus housing released today.
The committee says all fraternities
should eventually abandon selective rush
and women should be allowed to live
ofTcampus.
Some of the new coed residences
should be established in the existing
women's dormitories, the committee
proposes. As well as putting men and
women in the same houses, the report
urges the University to locate men's and
women's houses next to one another.
"A new comprehensive draw sys
tem" should be used this spring to
assign both men and women to resi
dences, giving priority to on-campus
and transfer students over those now
living off-campus, the report suggests.
Other recommendations for 1968-69
include making Toyon Hall coed, in
creasing on-campus space for under
graduate men, establishing an experi
mental cooperative residence, and in
tegrating a larger proportion of fresh
men with upperclassmen.
The committee says Stanford should
make some of the new coed houses "aca
demic" or "thematic," with seminars for
residents, like the present demonstration
houses — Grove, Serra, Otero and Soto.
Faculty residents are asked for all
women's residences.
This tentative "statement of general

intent" by the committee did not say
how many coed houses are desirable. A
survey completed last week showed 1,500
undergraduates want to move into coed
residences.
The 2,000-word residence report was
titled "Living and Learning at Stan
ford." History Prof. Lewis W. Spitz is
chairman of the 12-member SES Resi
dence committee. Dean of Students Joel
Smith is a member, along with five stu
dents.
"It is not an SES recommendation in
any sense," commented SES steering
committee chairman Herbert Packer.
Since "recommendations for next year
are outside the mandate of SES," the
committee acted on its own volition in
issuing the paper, Packer said. The
Study of Education will issue a final
report on all aspects of the University
in January, 1969.
Provost Richard Lyman released a
statement in conjunction with the Res
idence report, saying "there is no
chance whatever that all of the com
mittee's ideas could be put into effect
in 1968 69."
The report discussed long-range resi
dence goals as well as arrangements
for next year. Strong praise was given to
the demonstration houses as approach
ing the ideal Stanford residence, al
though the committee stressed that the
University shouldn't provide just one
kind of housing.
The demonstration houses are coed, in
tegrated by class, and offer seminars to

all residents. These features were strong
ly endorsed by students in the survey
of all undergraduates completed last
month
The Residence committee did not know
the results of the housing survey when
it drew up the report.
The report asserts "the values evi
dent in . . . integration, coeducation, and
programs of intellectual and cultural
substance seem to maximize the learn
ing potential of the residential setting."
As long-range goals, the University
should:
• Allow sophomore, junior and se
nior women to move off-campus. The
committee proposes this obliquely, by
suggesting "fully consistent housing re
quirements for men and women."
• Lower the male-female ratio. "The
Committee favors a more balanced ra
tio among undergraduate students . . .
at the same time, one important advan
tage of coeducation residences is that
they effectively reduce the undesirable
effects of the current ratio."
• Discourage selective rush. Again
the committee was vague, avoiding even
the use of the word "fraternity." The
recommendation reads:
"We must ask the university commu
nity if its ideals of openness and non
discrimination . . . are consistent with
any principle of housing selection other
than the applicant's choice in a draw
system. The judgment of the Com
mittee . . . suggests that movement to
ward such a universal draw system is

desirable and should be encouraged."
• Help fraternities break their na
tional affiliations. "We encourage every
effort to free university living groups
from dependence on or control by out
side organizations .including the offer
of university aid in achieving such in
dependence."
• Require at least three quarters' con
tinuous residence In a living group.
The committee suggested "some con
tinuity in the residence experience" is
necessary.
• Continue to require freshmen to
live on campus. First-year students need
"a real opportunity for intelligent choice
among various living alternatives."
Transfer students should be encouraged
to live on campus also, the committee
said.
• Provide on-campus space for all
undergraduates who want it.
Many of the committee's proposals
are similar to those made by the ASSU
Housing Commission a year ago. Mem
bers of the residence committee who
also worked on the ASSU report are
students John Trimbur, Rich Levin and
David Pugh, and Dean of the Chapel
B. Davie Napier. Other Residence com
mittee members are Spitz, Smith, Prof.
Donald Kennedy, Prof. Sidney Verba,
Susan Horst, Residence Manager Ed
Scoles and Michael Menke.
The committee outlines "certain gen
eral expectations of all University resi
dences." Among these are "a sense of
