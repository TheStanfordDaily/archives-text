# Monkey On My Back
## And Take That, Dean Napier! 
### Mike Couzens 
Harvey Hukari was right.
What the pestilential regions of
Memorial Church need is some
new blood.
We therefore challenge B.
Davie Napier to bring to the
campus for a Sunday morning
service an eminent theologian
and a great man, the Rev. Geo
rge Davis of Washington, D.C.
Rev. Davis' qualifications are
obvious, to anyone who reads
the newspapers:
• He is pastor of the Na
tional City Christian Church in
Washington.
• He includes in his congre
gation President Lyndon B.
Johnson.
• He is, God bless him, a
right winger.
We trust that it will not be
sentimental to recall some of
Rev. Davis'- shimmering mo
ments as a pulpiteer. There may,
indeed, be a few Daily readers
unaware of his reputation.
Sermon For LBJ
President Johnson responded
to his own call for a day of
prayer during the riots of last
summer by attending services
at the National City Christian
Church.
According to an AP dispatch,
this is what Rev. Davis said:
"America is basically sound
and does not deserve to be
caught up in a spirit of na
tional guilt."
"The guilt now of a small
minority of people, living in our
present crisis, cannot be fast
ened upon us all," Mr. Davis
said.
"There will be those here at
home and abroad who will try
to embarrass us, in our hours of
agonizing reappraisal. But those

abroad who try to embarrass us
will be men and nations who
do not have our freedoms, even
freedom to dissent, sometimes
foolishly and sometimes disas
trously."
"They will be men and nations
who do not have the courage
to wash their dirty linen as we
do, before the scrutiny of the en
tire world, because we are not
afraid of the truth, we are not
afraid of the light."
Evil Groups
"They will say our stand for
freedom around the world has
created the violence in the
United States and thus seek to
weaken our resolve and our pa
tience. We should not let them,
for they are wrong. These are
evil men and groups."
Declaring that there is room
at the alter for all people, the
pastor appealed to those who
have encouraged anarchy, civil
disobedience, lawlessness and
disregard for Constitutional au
thority to come to that altar.
"I doubt," he said, "if the
extremists will heed the call,
nor the destroyers, nor the
wreckers, nor the arsonists, nor
the rioters, nor the looters. But
let those who come, come in re
pentance ..."
Mr. Johnson sat with his
head bowed amid the standing
room-only congregation in the
big white limestone church.
How many "sophisticated"
Stanford students could use a
frank talking-to like that. Per
haps only so imposing a figure
as Rev. Davis has the fire-power
to give it to them.
Unswayable
Dean Napier, as Harvey Hu
kari acutely observed, only tells
the students what they want to

hear. But no one could claim for
a moment that Rev. Davis is
swayed by what one parishion
er, the President of the United
States, wants to hear.
When Eartha Kitt confronted
Mrs. Johnson at a luncheon a
few weeks ago, and told her that
the Vietnam war contributed to
riots and delinquency, Rev.
Davis sent the First Lady a
telegram.
On behalf of his parishioners,
and the nation, he apologized
for the actions of ignorant and
stupid Americans, of whatever
race. He closed by asking that
she congratulate her husband on
his fine State of the Union mes
sage.
One can overlook this foray
into politics when it is remem
bered that thousands, perhaps
millions of Americans, white and
Negro, felt relieved by this
tactful gesture.
A Fruit Stand?
Harvey Hukari suggested that
"a question and answer period
should be immediately follow
each sermon, speakers of di
verse viewpoints should be in
vited, political groups should set
up information tables in the
foyer ..."
We are all really rather tired
of Dean Napier's point of view,
and until a certified right-wing
er like Rev. Davis can be
sought, he might have said,
"information tables and a fruit
stand."
"Any pretense that we are in
Memorial Church to worship Al
mighty God should be dismiss
ed."
We have it on the authority of
Rev. Davis that the Great Com
mittee up in the Sky would win
with Johnson in '68.
