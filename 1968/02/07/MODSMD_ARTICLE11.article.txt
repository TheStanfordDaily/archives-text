## Custer's Last Press Release 
### Art Buchwald 
LITTLE BIGHORN, Dakota,
June 27, 1876 — Gen. George
Armstrong Custer said today in
an exclusive interview with this
correspondent that the Battle of
Little Bighorn had just turned
the corner and he could now see
the light at the end of the tun
nel.
"We have the Sioux on the
run," Gen. Custer told me. "Of
course, we still have some clean
ing up to do, but the redskins
are hurting badly and it will
only be a matter of time before
they give in."
"That's good news, General.
Of course, there are people who
are skeptical about the military
briefings on this war, and they
question if we're getting the en

tire truth as to what is really
happening here."
"I just would like to refer
you to these latest body counts.
The Sioux lost 5,000 men to our
100. They can't hope to keep up
this atrition much longer. We
know for a fact Sioux morale is
low, and they are ready to
throw in the towel."
Desperation Move
"Well, if they're hurting so
badly, Gen. Custer, how do you
explain this massive attack?"
"It's a desperation move on
the part of Sitting Bull and his
last death rattle. I have here
captured documents which show
that this is Phase II of Sitting
Bull's plan to wrest the Black
Hills from the Americans. All

he's going for is a psychological
victory, but the truth is that wo
expected this all the time and
we're not surprised by it."
"What about the fact that 19
Indians managed to penetrate
your headquarters? Doesn't that
look bad?"
"We knew all along they
planned to penetrate my head
quarters at the Indian Lunar
New Year. The fact that we re
pulsed them after they held on
for only six hours is another
example of how badly the Sioux
are fighting. Besides, they never
did get into the sleeping quar
ters of my tent, so I don't really
think they should be credited
with penetrating my headquar
ters."
Plans Foil
"You seem to be surrounded
at the moment, General."
"Obviously the enemy plans
have gone afoul," Gen. Custer
said. "The Sioux are hoping to
win a big victory so they'll be
able to have something to talk
about at the conference table.
Look at this latest body count.
We've just killed 3,000 more In
dians and lost 50 of our men."
"Then, according to my figur
ing. General, you have only 50
men left."
"Exactly. They can't keep up
this pressure much longer. The
truth of the matter is that their
hit-and-run guerrilla tactics
haven't worked, so they're now
resorting to mass attacks
against our positions. Thanks to
our interdiction of their supply
lines, they are not only short of
bows and arrows, but gunpow
der as well."
An aide came in and handed
Gen. Custer a sheet of paper.
"I knew it," The general said.
'The latest body count shows
they've lost 2,000 more Injuns
in the last hour. They should be
suing for peace at any time."
"How many did we lose, Gen
eral?"
"Our losses were light. We
only lost 45 men."
"But, General, that means
you have only five men left, in
cluding yourself."
"Look, we have to lose some
men, but we're taking all pre
cautions to keep our losses to
a minimum. Besides, we can al
ways count on the friendly
Indians in these hills to turn
against the Sioux for starting
hostilities during the Indian Lu
nar New Year.
The aide staggered back in,
an arrow in his chest. He handed
Gen. Custer the slip of paper
and dropped at his feet.
"Well, they just lost 500 more.
And we only lost four. It looks
as If they've had it."
"But, General, that means
you're the only one left."
"Boy," said the general, "would
I hate to be in the Sioux shoes
right now."
