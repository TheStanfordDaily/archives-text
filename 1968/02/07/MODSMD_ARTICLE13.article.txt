## Poll Finds Little Respect For Student Government 
### 
A recent poll at the University
of Kentucky has shown that
students there have little re
spect for, or confidence in, their
student government.
Well over half of those ex
pressing opinion felt that the
student government was not
adequately representing student
views to the administration,
while almost half of those
polled did not know where the
Student Government office was.
Only 13 percent had ever at
tended a student government
meeting, while three-fifths had
not voted in the last election.

Exception To Age Rule
Boston University officials
have decided to reconsider ap
pointing Herbert Marcuse, dis
tinguished and well-known phil
osopher, as a visiting professor
next year, after originally rul
ing out the appointment because
Marcuse was too old.
Marcuse is presently 69, and
the university has a policy pro
hibiting people over 70 from car
rying on teaching activities. An
administration official said that
the school was "ready to make
an exception" in Marcuse's case.

Freeze On Hiring
The University of Illinois has
put a freeze on most vacant
positions for next year because
of a substantial withdrawal of
federal grants.
The withdrawal is the result
of increased spending for the
Vietnam war. The immediate
effect of the shortage will be a
reduction in the number of visit
ing lecturers, and a reduction in
other non-recurring appoint
ments and projects.

Harvard Applications
The number of applications
for admission to four of Har
vard's graduate schools has
dropped this year, contrary to
the former annual upward
trend.
Admissions officers in the
Graduate School of Arts and
Sciences, the Law School, the
Business School, and the School
of Design have all attributed
the decline to the new Selective
Service law, which will end most
graduate deferments.
There were 500 fewer appli
cants for arts and sciences fel

lowships, and a similar decrease
is expected overall. Law School
applications were down by
almost 200, and the Business
School predicts an eight percent
decline in applicants.
There was a significant in
crease in Medical School appli
cants, however, Medical students
will be exempt from the draft
for the duration of their studies
under the new law.
Applications for the Bachelor
of Divinity program were also
up — by 60 percent.

Language Reqt. Change
Harvard has proposed reduc
ing its language requirement
from two years of study to one.
The faculty must still approve
the plan.
The change would affect those
who had not yet completed their
requirement. Harvard exempts
any student who had a 560 or
better on a College Board
achievement test from the re
quirement.
Two language departments
had previously decided to opnn
their courses to pass-fail to pre
vent such a move.
