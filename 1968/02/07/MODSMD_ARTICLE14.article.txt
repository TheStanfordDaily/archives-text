# Few Rhodes Scholars
## State Universities Left Out

Many of the state universities
that have high academic repu
tations still have had little suc
cess in producing Rhodes Schol
ars. The University of Michigan,
for example, has had p total of
21 Scholars since the program
was started (as compared with
Harvard's 139) and has had just
one in the past six years. Prof.
Otto Graf, who heads the
Rhodes' program at Michigan,
doesn't know why. He points
out that the university's stu
dents have been far more suc
cessful In winning Marshall
Scholarships for study in En
gland than Rhodes,' even though
only 24 Marshalls are given each
year.
"Frankly, I'm quite bewil
dered," he says."I don't know
what they're looking for." Graf
helps students who want to ap
ply but he doesn't actively en
courage them. "I tell students
that express an interest in the
Rhodes that they are going to
be put through a lot of paper
work ... and that they really
have very little chance," he ex
plains.
Kenneth Gint at the Uni
versity of Oregon, which has
no Rhodes' winners since before
1962, says he gets very few ap
plicants for. the Scholarships
even though the competition is
well advertised on campus. He
believes that many students shy
away from applying because
they believe the competition is

too hard, and that others who
might be otherwise eligible can't
apply because they're married.
James Roach, who handles the
Rhodes' program at Texas, says
that some students who have a
good academic background feel
that they lack the extra-curricu
lar accomplishments to win, and
therefore don't apply. He also
recalls that when some Texas
students have applied in the
past, they have "come back feel
ing that their, competition (re
ferring to Ivy League candi
dates) was no brighter but more
polished."
The Berkeley Rhodes' repre
sentative says that he is going
to make a strong effort to get
good applicants interested in ap
plying next year, but that his
experience in the past has made
him somewhat pessimistic. He
says he is "increasingly dis
turbed" over Berkeley's failure
to do better in the competition.
Whether, or not the bad show
ing made the state universities
is a result of deficiencies in the
Rhodes program, It doesn't ap
pear that the program is likely
to be revised. Griffith, who once
proposed that three of the four
winners from each district be
selected from schools in that
district, says his idea has no
chance of succeeding.
The selection system tends to
perpetuate itself, because all
members of the district selec
tion committies are Rhodes
Scholars except the chairman.

It would be surprising if the
committees did not lean to ap
plicants who were well-spoken
and poised, as the committee
members themselves presum
ably are. Since Ivy League ap
plicants, for reasons already
noted, tend to posess these qual
ities, they consistently make the
best impression on the selection
committees.
The Rhodes' system, however,
does have a tendency to reform
itself to some extent, if only
temporarily. After Harvard stu
dents won 10 of the Rhodes'
awards in 1965, the selection
committees apparently reacted
to the criticism of Harvard's
success by cutting back on Ivy
League awards the next year.
The Ivy League and the military
academies won a total of nine
Scholarships in 1966.
Yet this past year suggests
that reaction won't result in per
manent redistribution of the
awards. If the state universities
are going to win a greater share
of the Scholarships, more effort
on their part might help. At
Harvard, according to the head
of the pnogram there, each of
the 10 undergraduate houses
have a Rhodes' representative,
which obviously helps the uni
versity as a whole get the Schol
arships.
In the long run, though, it's
difficult to see how the Rhodes
Scholarships can be distributed
more widely unless the selection
method is reformed. A recom

mendation to selection commit
tee members to look for people
who really appear to have po
tential for, political leadership
would probably help, but a re
quirement that a certain number
of schools in each district be rep
resented seems to be the only
sure way of guaranteeing a
wider distribution of the Schol
arships.
