worldwide commitment.)
The end of the British Em
pire has finally arrived. In this
country the occasion has passed
virtually unnoticed.
The great expansion of Euro
pean, and particularly British,
values, institutions, cultures
and attitudes that originally
spawned the United States, had
reached its zenith by 1914. The
subsequent fifty years have
seen the continued contraction
of direct European influence.
Today that influence is more
imagined than real. The first
month of 1968 ends a period of
world history.
To understand what is in
volved in the British decision to
withdraw from all outposts east
of §uez, to grant independence
shortly to those few remaining
colonies, and to concentrate in
future on a European role, it
is necessary to realize the pres
ent extent of the British com
mitment.
Mainly this commitment is
concentrated In Malaysia.
Something over 100,000 ser
vicemen are stationed in this
port. The cost of maintaining
these forces is variously es
timated as being between $600-
$700 million annually.
In the Middle East the main
loss will be to the native rulers,
who depend on British treaties
for protection from Pan-Arab
nationalism. This arrangement
also protests British oil inter
ests: how these interests, vital
to an economy without natural
oil resources, are to be safe
guarded in the future, has yet
to be explained.

from Malaysia presents the U.S.
with an awkward decision —
should the vacuum be filled?
Ideally, the Australians would
take over. This is highly unlike
ly both because of Australia's
limited resources, and because of
her traditional isolation from
Asian politics. Only recently has
this attitude changed in the face
of Vietnam realities.
Another possibility is that the
Japanese might take a more
active interest in peace-keeping
in South-east Asia. However,
this ignores Japan's reluctance
to commit herself to an actively
pro-Western foreign policy. It
also forgets the emotional fac
tor involved in Japan's return
to an area of bitter memories
left over from World War 11.
If Malaysia, where elections
are actually held freely and
regularly, is not to go the way
of the rest of South East Asia,
consideration must be given
somewhere in the Western world
to its defense. The only viable
alternative to the British are
the Americans; it seems only
a matter of time before the
American commitment to this
area is logically extended.
Leaving aside the strategic
implications of Britain's with
drawal to her European fortress,
what other results will the end
of the Empire have on the
world?
The most important impond
erable is the future British
attitude to world affairs. At
present the mood of the coun
try appears to be one of re
luctance to accept the new
situation. Tradition dies hard
everywhere, but nowhere hard
er than in Britain. Witness
Mr. Wilson's 'folie de gran
deur' — a visit to the Soviet
Union the week after he had
abrogated Britain's world
role.

Undoubtedly the next decade
will be one of readjustment to
changed circumstances. From
an American point of view,
ties with Britain are likely to
become even more meaningless
than they are today. The
strength of NATO will be furth
reduced, and a solution to the
German problem is likely to be
come correspondingly more ur
gent.
But the hardest task of any
British government will be to
restore a sense of purpose to
national life. Prosperity and self
confidence of the type evident
in France under the General
are much needed.
The Wilson administration
hardly enjoys the necessary re
spect to produce such a change.
One political commentator re
cently described Mr. Wilson as
"the most blinkered Prime Min
ister since Neville Chamberlain,
the most dishonest since Lloyd
George, and the most ineffectual
since Goderich," who was leader
of the government in 1827.
Loss of confidence in the gov
ernment, and above all in the
Prime Minister, imminent in
creases in income tax, further
restrictions on public and pri
vate spending, continued eco
nomic deflation—this is the base
from which Britain must at
tempt to recover, outside the
Common Market, with recur
rent balance of payments crises,
and the looming spectre of fur
ther devaluation if everything
else fails.
In these circumstances the
British are apt to rely on the
unconventional to pull them
through. In 1940 it was Win
ston Churchill. In 1968 the
best that has been offered so
far is a spontaneous move
ment to "Back Britain." This
idea had Its origins in a tea
break during which five secre
taries discussed the economic
situation. Despite predictable

Union hostility, workers and
management all over the
country are actually volun
teering to work extra hours
without pay. Even the Church
of England Is Involved — one
clergyman Is offering cut
price weddings to couples
wearing 'Back Britain' badges.
Of course, the question arises,
what sort of Britain are the
British backing? Is it to be
some variant of introverted
Swedish socialism? Is it to be
a part of a dynamic European
community and Common Mar
ket, which is a real alternative
to the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R.?
Is it to be an offshore island
wallowing in the mists of his
tory? Is it to become less pa
ternalistic, more commercially
minded, less welfare oriented?
To be British today is to live
without the glorious certainty
of the Victorian age which ling
ered on well into this century.
No longer does the world stand
in awe of British achievement.
No longer does British influence
penetrate across the entire
globe. The Anglo-Saxon virtues
are not those to which the un
commited turn.
Fighting two world wars
within thirty years, surviving
depression and continual econo
mic crisis, watching a world em
pire disintegrate into the evas
sive concept of a Common
wealth, standing by as the world
became a bi polar confederation,
the twentieth century and its
lessons have hit Britain hard.
At last, Britain is in a position
to present herself to the world
psychologically unfettered by
the burden of colonialism. It is
possible now that her necessar
ily externally directed policy
will be freed from the postur
ing conscience that has typified
the last decade. For the ideals
of democracy and freedom this,
at least, is one benefit the West
ern world has gained from rec
ent events.
