# 'New' Geography Replaces Maps

### 
A Northwestern University
social scientist will direct a
program designed to introduce
the nation's colleges and uni
versities to the new geogra
phy—an academic soul brother
to the new math and new sci
ence programs that are mak
ing a deep impact in American
education.
He is Edward B. Espenshade
Jr., chairman of Northwestern's
geography department.
Geography, old style, is that
subject the student bumps into
in elementary school in order
to learn the capital of Arizona,
the annual rainfall in the Ama
zon basin and the duration of
the Laotian monsoons.
Analytical Approach
New geography, of the type
represented by the Northwest
ern department and Professor
Espenshade, is much less de
scriptive than traditional geog
raphy and much more analyti
cal. It is intimately involved
with the development of urban,
social and economic planning
programs, is concerned with
how man organizes; and uses
terrestrial space, and is experi
menting with exotic space pro
gram hardware as a tool for
collecting geographical data.
If the old geographer was

that fellow twirling the blue
brown-green globe representing
the earth, the new geographer
is the one standing by the com
puter, waiting for the rocket.
Geography is gaining rapidly
in prestige as an academic dis
cipline. At Cambridge Univer
sity, it recently replaced his
tory as the most popular sub
ject among the English under
graduates.
Prof. Kenneth Boulding of
the University of Michigan re
cently wrote:
"Of all the disciplines geog
graphy is the one that has
caught the vision of the study
of the earth as a total system,
and it has strong claims to be
the queen of the human sci
ences."
Study Guides Planned
Among Professor Espenshade's
plans as chairman of the goog
graphy commission is the prep
aration of study guides that
will introduce new geographi
cal research developments to
students. Such research devel
opments include:
New methods for determin
ing the systematic patterns in
agricultural and urban land
use, in the location of rotail
and service trade centers, and
in transportation networks. The
use of remote-sensing devices,
of the type equipping recon
naissance satellites, is a new
means for collecting informa
tion on such patterns.
The rise of the central place
theory, an approach to the
study of the spatial distribution
of towns and cities.
The development of mathe
matical techniques for predict
ing "diffusion of innovation" —
how and where new behavioral
characteristics or ideas may
spread among people. Ideally,
such mathematical models could
yield accurate predictions on
the spread of birth control meth
ods, the movement of racial
minority groups to white neigh
borhoods and other widely
varied events.
