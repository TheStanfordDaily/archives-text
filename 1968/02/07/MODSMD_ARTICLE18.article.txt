# Brown Condemns Viet Violations
## 
### 
American conduct in Vietnam
has involved "consistent viola
tion of almost every internation
al agreement relating to the
rules of warfare," charges re
ligion professor Robert McAfee
Brown.
The accusation was made In
the introduction to a book which
he has co-authored entitled "In
the Name of America."
The main portion of the book
consists of excerpts from 37
American and 6 foreign periodi
cals contrasted with citations of
The Hague and the Geneva Con
ventions on the conduct of war.
The book includes an intro
duction signed by 29 prominent
Jewish, Catholic and Protestant
clergymen.
Co-authoring the body of the
text are Rabbi Arthur Lelyveld,
president of the American Jew

ish Congress, and Father John
Sheerin, editor of The Catholic
World magazine.
Included in the list of men
who signed the introduction are
President John C. Bennett of
Union Theological Seminary,
Prof. Harvey Cox of Harvard,
Rabbi Abraham Heschel of the
Jewish Theological Seminary
and the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.
The clergymen maintain that
"American conduct in Vietnam
is condemned by the very stand
ards of conduct which we im
posed on a defeated enemy (Ger
many) in the Nuremburg
trials."
"In instance after instance,
the U.S. has far exceeded the
bounds of what is morally per
missable in Vietnam," they add.
"Our concept of what is allowed
seems to expand like a rubber
band."
"We acknowledge that our
government has shown con
straint on many levels. We have
resisted the plea that we bomb
Hanoi back into the Stone Age
. . . we have not bombed the
dikes in North Vietnam nor
have we used atomic weapons.
. . . Our tremendous military
power is held in check."
But they add that is not
enough to compare present re
straint with theoretical maxi
mums.
