# North Vietnamese Tanks Hit Special Forces Camp

### 
SAIGON (AP) — North Viet
namese infantrymen supported
by nine medium tanks and
assaults on the Lang Vei Spe
cial Forces in the northwest cor
ner of South Vietnam early
Wednesday and penetrated the
barbed wire perimeter.
The U.S. Command said radio
contact with the American
Green Beret troopers inside the
camp was lost for more than an
hour but was re-established and
it appeared the Montagnard
militiamen in the camp and
their American advisers were
still holding out.
The command said five of the
enemy's Russian - model T34
tanks were destroyed. It was
the first time the enemy has
been reported using tanks in the
Vietnam war.
South Vietnamese military
headquarters had reported ear
lier that the camp four miles
west of the Laotian border and

about 20 miles south of the de
militarized zone had been over
run.
A government spokesman
said a reconnaissance plane
flying over the camp at dawn
saw North Vietnamese troops
moving inside it. He added that
the pilot reported making radio
contact with members of the
camp's garrison who said they
had withdrawn from the camp.
Officials did not indicate hew
many Americans were at Lang
Vei, which normally would have
12 Green Beret troops. Condi
tions in the area have not been
considered normal for some
time and there was speculation
that as many as 40 or more
Americans were in the camp.
As the enemy pushed through
the camp's perimeter, the de
fenders, aided by artillery and
tactical air strikes, engaged in
close-quarter fighting from their
bunkers.

As the countrywide Commu
nist attacks went into their
ninth day, enemy forces con
tinued to hold out in Saigon
and Hue, the old imperial capi
tal 400 miles to the north. The
allies were girding for pos
sible second wave attacks.
A major fight that broke out
Tuesday one mile north of Tan
Son Nhut air base in the sub
urbs of Saigon was reported
still going on Wednesday morn
ing. The enemy, estimated at
battalion strength, was pulling
back under the pressure of re
inforced South Vietnamese
troops.
Several sharp firefights erupt
ed in suburban areas around
Saigon. Small-arms fire cracked
at times in the night within the
capital. American spokesman
estimated there are still about
900 Communist troops in the
city, with one 400-man battalion
as the largest organized unit.

A U.S. spokesman said allied
forces were on the track of ele
ments of three Communist regi
ments to the north and west of
Saigon. These apparently were
the same regiments that Vice
President Nguyen Cao Ky said
Monday were still uncommitted
and could menace the city.
Another outfit that might
be used in a second wave
attack was the North Vietna
mese 2nd Division, perhaps
10,000 men reported deployed
between Da Nang and Hoi An,
15 miles south of Da Nang.
A U.S. spokesman said this di
vision posed "a potential
threat of some magnitude,"
but for the moment the situa
tion was quiet
Communist holdings in Hue
constricted slowly under coordi
nated drives by U.S. Marines
and South Vietnamese troops.
The Marines recaptured the
province headquarters building
in that old imperial capital, 400
miles north of Saigon, hoisted
the American flag and inched
ahead in their campaign to clear
the section south of the Per
fume River.
Across the river, government
forces squeezed Communist
troops into the northwest and
southwest corners of the wall
surrounding the Citadel, the
two-mile-square former home of
emperors that makes up most of
the northern part of Hue.
American and Vietnamese
troops fought on at Dalat, a
mountain resort 140 miles
northeast of Saigon, where

Communist units that may
total 750 men clung to two
strong points.
"Dalat remains question

able," said Brig. Gen. Winant
Sidle, the U.S. Command's in
formation chief. 'There are six
enemy companies in town. Al
though it looks as if we would
be able to clear them out, the
town is not clear yet."
Sidel reported the situation
quiet along the demilitarized
zone and in northernmost Quang
Tri Province, where U.S. Ma
rines are braced for an expected
drive by four or five divisions
of North Vietnam's regulars.
The Mekong Delta below Sai
gon, the nation's populous rice
bowl, was officially described as
"a model of quietude" with the
allies again in control of the ma
jor cities.
Gen. William C. Westmore
land said allied forces have

turned the tables, "destroying
more of the enemy in seven
days than the United States has
lost in seven years of war since
January 1961."
"But we cannot relax for a
moment," the U.S. commander
said in a message to American
servicemen. "We must continue
to stand ready for the enemy's
possible second wave attack."
Westmoreland's reference on
casualties was to the 22,748 of
the enemy reported killed in the
seven days up to Tuesday mid
night. With 614 Americans lost
in that bloodiest fighting of the
war, the roll of U.S. combat
dead since 1961 approached
17,500. South Vietnamese dead
number 1,130.

SAIGON (AP) — North Viet
namese infantrymen supported
by nine medium tanks and
assaults on the Lang Vei Spe
cial Forces in the northwest cor
ner of South Vietnam early
Wednesday and penetrated the
barbed wire perimeter.
The U.S. Command said radio
contact with the American
Green Beret troopers inside the
camp was lost for more than an
hour but was re-established and
it appeared the Montagnard
militiamen in the camp and
their American advisers were
still holding out.
The command said five of the
enemy's Russian - model T34
tanks were destroyed. It was
the first time the enemy has
been reported using tanks in the
Vietnam war.
South Vietnamese military
headquarters had reported ear
lier that the camp four miles
west of the Laotian border and

about 20 miles south of the de
militarized zone had been over
run.
A government spokesman
said a reconnaissance plane
flying over the camp at dawn
saw North Vietnamese troops
moving inside it. He added that
the pilot reported making radio
contact with members of the
camp's garrison who said they
had withdrawn from the camp.
Officials did not indicate hew
many Americans were at Lang
Vei, which normally would have
12 Green Beret troops. Condi
tions in the area have not been
considered normal for some
time and there was speculation
that as many as 40 or more
Americans were in the camp.
As the enemy pushed through
the camp's perimeter, the de
fenders, aided by artillery and
tactical air strikes, engaged in
close-quarter fighting from their
bunkers.

As the countrywide Commu
nist attacks went into their
ninth day, enemy forces con
tinued to hold out in Saigon
and Hue, the old imperial capi
tal 400 miles to the north. The
allies were girding for pos
sible second wave attacks.
A major fight that broke out
Tuesday one mile north of Tan
Son Nhut air base in the sub
urbs of Saigon was reported
still going on Wednesday morn
ing. The enemy, estimated at
battalion strength, was pulling
back under the pressure of re
inforced South Vietnamese
troops.
Several sharp firefights erupt
ed in suburban areas around
Saigon. Small-arms fire cracked
at times in the night within the
capital. American spokesman
estimated there are still about
900 Communist troops in the
city, with one 400-man battalion
as the largest organized unit.

A U.S. spokesman said allied
forces were on the track of ele
ments of three Communist regi
ments to the north and west of
Saigon. These apparently were
the same regiments that Vice
President Nguyen Cao Ky said
Monday were still uncommitted
and could menace the city.
Another outfit that might
be used in a second wave
attack was the North Vietna

number 1,130.
SAIGON (AP) — North Viet
namese infantrymen supported
by nine medium tanks and
assaults on the Lang Vei Spe
cial Forces in the northwest cor
ner of South Vietnam early
Wednesday and penetrated the
barbed wire perimeter.
The U.S. Command said radio
contact with the American
Green Beret troopers inside the
camp was lost for more than an
hour but was re-established and
it appeared the Montagnard
militiamen in the camp and
their American advisers were
still holding out.
The command said five of the
enemy's Russian - model T34
tanks were destroyed. It was
the first time the enemy has
been reported using tanks in the
Vietnam war.
South Vietnamese military
headquarters had reported ear
lier that the camp four miles
west of the Laotian border and

about 20 miles south of the de
militarized zone had been over
run.
A government spokesman
said a reconnaissance plane
flying over the camp at dawn
saw North Vietnamese troops
moving inside it. He added that
the pilot reported making radio
contact with members of the
camp's garrison who said they
had withdrawn from the camp.
Officials did not indicate hew
many Americans were at Lang
Vei, which normally would have
12 Green Beret troops. Condi
tions in the area have not been
considered normal for some
time and there was speculation
that as many as 40 or more
Americans were in the camp.
As the enemy pushed through
the camp's perimeter, the de
fenders, aided by artillery and
tactical air strikes, engaged in
close-quarter fighting from their
bunkers.

As the countrywide Commu
nist attacks went into their
ninth day, enemy forces con
tinued to hold out in Saigon
and Hue, the old imperial capi
tal 400 miles to the north. The
allies were girding for pos
sible second wave attacks.
A major fight that broke out
Tuesday one mile north of Tan
Son Nhut air base in the sub
urbs of Saigon was reported
still going on Wednesday morn
ing. The enemy, estimated at
battalion strength, was pulling
back under the pressure of re
inforced South Vietnamese
troops.
Several sharp firefights erupt
ed in suburban areas around
Saigon. Small-arms fire cracked
at times in the night within the
capital. American spokesman
estimated there are still about
900 Communist troops in the
city, with one 400-man battalion
as the largest organized unit.

A U.S. spokesman said allied
forces were on the track of ele
ments of three Communist regi
ments to the north and west of
Saigon. These apparently were
the same regiments that Vice
President Nguyen Cao Ky said
Monday were still uncommitted
and could menace the city.
Another outfit that might
be used in a second wave
attack was the North Vietna
mese 2nd Division, perhaps
10,000 men reported deployed
between Da Nang and Hoi An,
15 miles south of Da Nang.
A U.S. spokesman said this di
vision posed "a potential
threat of some magnitude,"
but for the moment the situa
tion was quiet
Communist holdings in Hue
constricted slowly under coordi
nated drives by U.S. Marines
and South Vietnamese troops.
The Marines recaptured the
province headquarters building
in that old imperial capital, 400
miles north of Saigon, hoisted
the American flag and inched
ahead in their campaign to clear
the section south of the Per
fume River.
Across the river, government
forces squeezed Communist
troops into the northwest and
southwest corners of the wall
surrounding the Citadel, the
two-mile-square former home of
emperors that makes up most of
the northern part of Hue.
American and Vietnamese
troops fought on at Dalat, a
mountain resort 140 miles
northeast of Saigon, where

Communist units that may
total 750 men clung to two
strong points.
"Dalat remains question

able," said Brig. Gen. Winant
Sidle, the U.S. Command's in
formation chief. 'There are six
enemy companies in town. Al
though it looks as if we would
be able to clear them out, the
town is not clear yet."
Sidel reported the situation
quiet along the demilitarized
zone and in northernmost Quang
Tri Province, where U.S. Ma
rines are braced for an expected
drive by four or five divisions
of North Vietnam's regulars.
The Mekong Delta below Sai
gon, the nation's populous rice
bowl, was officially described as
"a model of quietude" with the
allies again in control of the ma
jor cities.
Gen. William C. Westmore
land said allied forces have

turned the tables, "destroying
more of the enemy in seven
days than the United States has
lost in seven years of war since
January 1961."
"But we cannot relax for a
moment," the U.S. commander
said in a message to American
servicemen. "We must continue
to stand ready for the enemy's
possible second wave attack."
Westmoreland's reference on
casualties was to the 22,748 of
the enemy reported killed in the
seven days up to Tuesday mid
night. With 614 Americans lost
in that bloodiest fighting of the
war, the roll of U.S. combat
dead since 1961 approached
17,500. South Vietnamese dead
number 1,130.
