# 'Fierce' Greeks Compete
## Chariots Vie In Race 
### JOHN ALCORN 
They wouldn't have lasted
long In Alexander's army, nor
would the spectacle of fierce
Greeks competing in a chariot
race yesterday at White Plaza
have inspired a Homer.
But the annual fraternity
chariot race did highlight the be
ginning of this year's Greek
Week.
Before a crowd consisting of
about four hundred plebians and
patricians, the competition was
held on an improvised course
that was about two hundred feet
long.
The contest was divided into
two divisions: chariots racing
for best time and chariots com
peting for the honored humor
category. Six fraternities en
tered the racing division.
In three preliminary elimin
ation heats, in which all char
iots were required to carry a
"vestal virgin" as a passenger,
Zeta Psi lost to the Phi Delts,
Delta Upsilon was trounced by
Kappa Alpha, and the Alpha
Sigs beat the Delts.
In humor competition a new
fraternity on the Stanford Cam
pus, Lambda Alpha Theta,
(rumored to have mysterious
connections with Lathrop
House) won after a valiant ef
fort. Their chariot was pre
ceded by four people—their sex
was not determined —wearing
commando suits. Behind these
followed the Greek maidens
who carpeted the path of Aphro

dite's chariot with leaves. Peri
cles would have been proud.
The Alpha Delts took second
in the humor category. Their
"chariot" consisted of a con
tainer vaguely resembling a cof
fin which was carried on the
shoulders of the frat's bravest
men. As they marched, water
shot out from the coffin onto
the crowd. The crowd didn't
mind this nearly so much as
they did trying to figure the

meaning of the words painted
on the coffin: "We have the big
gest box on campus."
While this was going on,
though, the real warriors read
ied their makeshift chariots, con
structed from junk and bicycle
wheels, for the final test. In
the end, it was the Alpha Sigs
who were destined to rule
Aechia, while Kappa Alpha and
the Phi Delts took second and
third place.
