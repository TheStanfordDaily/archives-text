# A 						Young Man's Fancy Turns To...

### 
It's spring time again, and for Stanford's baseballers that means warm afternoons of fungos,
shagging flies, pitching machines, batting cages, and running.
Daily photographer Bob Downey snapped these shots of Ray Young's charges getting ready
for this year's 55-game season. The Tribe will take on the Stanford Frosh this Saturday and then
open against the USF Dons at the Sunken Diamond next Tuesday.


COACH'S EYE VIEW — Here's
wluit Baseball Coach Ray Young
sees as he watches over hatting 1
practice from his favorite spot
behind the cage. Ron Shotts
and Greg Buck (23) await the
pitch.


HMMM — Sandy Vance regards Bob Gallagher as he warms up
for batting practice. Gallagher's normal haunt Is center field, but
his left arm was pressed into service to give batters a look at some
southpaw hurling before the season began. Vance, a right-hander,
was the staff ace last year.


GO, GO — Jeff Rohlfing legs out his last batting practice cut.
Coach Young has the entire team running hard this year, includ
ing himself. The Tribe plays a practice game today at 3:00 pjn.
against the Pittsburgh Pirates rookie team, and tomorrow takes
on the Philadelphia Rookies.


GOOD LOOK — Mark Marquess
lays off a low inside one as the
catcher makes a good grab to
pick it out of the dirt. Batters
yesterday were getting their first
looks at curve halls for the sea
son.
