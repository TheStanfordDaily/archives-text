### JOHN MERRILL

before almost 3,000 partisans at

"Most of the team members
fought their best matches of the
season, but this is by far the
toughest competition we have
faced this year."

in all the boxers, but we will
still have a good deal of work
to do before the Chico State
meet."
Three Forfeits
Stanford forfeited three
matches before the meet began,
in the vacant 132, 147, and 165
pound slots. However the In

his way to a decisive three-round
decision. This was the second
victory of the young season for

points. Bassett hung on gamely,

sharp three-round battle, before
losing the unanimous decision.

"I see a lot of improvement
in all the boxers, but we will
still have a good deal of work
to do before the Chico State
meet."
Three Forfeits
Stanford forfeited three
matches before the meet began,
in the vacant 132, 147, and 165
pound slots. However the In
dians won the first match on the
card.
George McFall, 125, punched
his way to a decisive three-round
decision. This was the second
victory of the young season for
the rapidly-improving McFall.
In the 139 pound division Stan
ford's Brant Bassett fell prey
to an early cut which cost him
points. Bassett hung on gamely,
losing a close decision.
Banney Adler, at 156, faced the
outstanding member of the Ne

vada squad, and gave him a
sharp three-round battle, before
losing the unanimous decision.
Frosh Nemec Wins
At 180 pounds, Neil Nemec,
a relative newcomer to the
squad, gained Stanford's only
other score of the evening. Ne
mec looked ragged in style at
times, but convincing punching
garnered a decision for the In
dian freshman.
Two heavyweights went for
Stanford. In the first bout,
Chuck Schembra tired at the
end of his three-round bout, and
the match was stopped midway
through the third round.
Moffett IJpset
Stanford's top heavyweight
Gene Moffett flew in to the meet,
after the varsity r.ugby match,
just before fight time.
However before Moffett, win
ner of his last three bouts on
TKO's, could unleash a punch,
his Nevada opponent delivered
a shot that put him down for the
count.
Moffett wanted to continue,
but the referee stopped the bout.
The next meet for the Indian
boxers will also be the last home
meet of the season. On February
17, the Tribe will face the Chico
State boxers at Encina, at 8:00.
The Stanford varsity boxing
team fell to the University of
Nevada Saturday night, 8%-1%,
before almost 3,000 partisans at
Reno.
After the meet, Coach Ray
Lunny of Stanford commented,
"Most of the team members
fought their best matches of the
season, but this is by far the
toughest competition we have
faced this year."
