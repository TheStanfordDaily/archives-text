# Soviets Call U.S. Publication 'Junk'

MOSCOW (AP) â€” This
month's issue of Amerika, a
U.S. government Russian-lan
guage magazine popular among
Soviet youth, was assailed by
a Soviet newspaper as full of
"verbal junk."
The issue, devoted to articles
on American youth, "tried to
mislead the Soviet reader with
the help of effective propagan
dists tricks," said Komsomols
kaya Pravada. voice of the So
viet Communist Youth League.
A long, angry article in the
paper said Amerika discussed
rebellious U.S. youngsters but
did not put enough emphasis on
what Communists consider the
social causes of dissent.
Writer V. Chervyakov said the
magazine, published by the U.S.
Information Agency, spoke of
rebelliousness in some cases as
being merely a stage young peo
ple were going through.
"In other words," he said,
"the reasons for rebelliousness
are merely biological, not at all
social ones." Chervyakov said
he disputed this view.
Different Forms
He said the magazine failed to
distinguish between different
forms of rebelliousness, lump
ing together "those who go to
Mississippi to register Negro
voters and those who achieve
only greater freedom of inti
mate relations, those who burn

their draft cards and those who
protest only against the law for
bidding the use of narcotics,
especially marijuana."
He said that if the magazine
was going to lump all young
rebels together, it should have
included the Hell's Angels mo
torcycle gang.
Chervyakov complained that
although the magazine referred
to draft card burning, it did not
once mention Vietnam.
The writer said the magazine
tried to look at U.S. life through
"rose colored glasses" but, he
added, its alleged attempt to
mislead Soviet readers "clearly
failed."
Until recently 60,000 copies of
Amerika were sent to subscrib
ers and newsstands each
month. They quickly sold out in
many cities but each month the
Soviet government returned
about 15,000 and claimed they
were "unsold."
Because of this, the press run
has been cut to 50,000. A U.S.
Embassy spokesman said "un
sold" copies have not yet been
returned for the new press run
but he expected the number to
be fewer.
