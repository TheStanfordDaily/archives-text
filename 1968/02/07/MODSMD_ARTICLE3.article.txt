# Decision Expected
## CIA Hearings End 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The student Judicial Council
late Monday night closed out
the last of its hearings on the
case of ten students charged
with illegally demonstrating
against Central Intelligence
Agency recruiting on campus.
At previous meetings, the
council had heard evidence from
Dean of Students Joel Smith
establishing the defendants'
presence at Encina Hall the
morning of Nov. 1.
Monday night the defendents
and several others spoke in
their defense before the council
and an audience of 100 in Tres
idder Union. All but two of the
defendents addressed the coun
cil and were questioned by it.
One of them, Yale Braunstein,
was represented by counsel.
Braunstein faces an additional
Fundamental Standard violation
charge.
Council Chairman Richard
Such said he did not know when
a verdict would be reached.
"This could take a long time,"
he said.
The speakers talked on differ
ent aspects of the case. Barry
Greenberg, graduate in political
science, led off with a "general
analysis" of the case.
"The question is, who in
this room has the right to
Judge and who In this room
ought to be judge*!," Green
berg said. Then he narrowed
his discussion to Smith and
his associate dean, Willard G.
Wyman, who were both in the
room.
Greenberg attacked what he
called the hypocrisy of the Fun
damental Standard (the general
code of student conduct) and
the University's policy on cam
pus demonstrations.
The Standard demands con
duct worthy of "good citizens."
Greenberg asked, "Who has the

right to define what is a good
citizen and what is demanded
of him?"
"If I were to call as witnesses
the people who really qualify as
witnesses, then I would have to
call on the people of Vietnam,
the people of the Dominican Re
public, the people of South Af
rica, and all the other people of
Asia, Latin America and Africa
who are being oppressed and
destroyed by this nation's and
this University's foreign policy,"
Greenberg said.
Then senior Michael Miller,
who is not a defendent, spoke
on specific points of evidence
and the hearing's procedure.
He charged the method of
picking the defendents out of
pictures taken at the demon
stration was "highly selective
and somewhat arbitrary.
"It seems these people were
indicted not for being in the
CIA demonstration alone but
because they happen to be
friends of Bill Wyman (associ
ate dean)," Miller said.
Wyman has testified earlier
he had picked the defendents
from photographs taken at the
demonstration.
Then Miller charged the Uni
versity's campus demonstration
policy is ill defined when it says
demonstrations should take
place in an orderly manner.
Miller said none of the dem
onstrators engaged in violent
acts. By contrast, he said, one
of the demonstrators, Associate
English Professor Bruce Frank
lin, was assaulted by the assis
tant chief of the campus police.
Compared with this action,
Miller said, the charge against
Yale Braunstein of "sticking a
picket sign through a door is
rather trivial."
Miller also accused the ad
ministration of not presenting
evidence showing the extent

of each individual's participa
tion in the demonstration.
Professor Charles Stein, the
noted prize-winning statistician,
spoke next, saying the demon
strators should be judged in
light of what they were oppos
ing.
Stein deplored that opponents
to the Vietnam war were "re
strained from opposing the war
because of the fear of interfer
ing in a very minor way with
some peripheral activity of the
University which is in fact part
of what we are struggling
against."
Then Franklin spoke. Frank
lin was active in the demonstra
tion himself, but since he is a
professor, he has not faced trial
before the Judicial Council.
He called the demonstrators'
trial an effort "to repress this
movement and to intimidate it.
It's not a local thing. It's some
thing which is part of a repres
sion that's going on all over the
country right now.
"These are crimes without
victims," Franklin said. "We
are told that the rights of cer
tain people were violated but
where are these people to tes
tify? Where is somebody to
come here and testify that
'My rights were violated by
these demonstrators. I am a
pedestrian who was interfered
with.* ?"
Sophomore Leonard Siegal, a
defendent, then talked about
"Stanford as a channeling agent
for the military and big busi
ness."
"According to an opinion cur
rently held by the Defense De
partment," the letter read, "U.S.
universities are not contributing
as much as they should to tech
nology.... It is doubtful that
this charge could be leveled at
Stanford."
Jeff Browning, junior, English
major and a defendent, said one
of the University's prime con
cerns is "controlling resources,"
whether students or professors.
Browning said the Associ
ated Students organization is
another method of controlling
students because students de
rive no real power from it but
are led to believe they do.
Defendent Jack Gerson said
"If you can see what is going on
(with U.S. foreign policy) and
you don't act to try to change
that, then I think you're morally
guilty and you're violating the
Fundamental Standard of Stan
ford University."
Defendent Guy Smythe, a
sophomore, said, "I don't know
how the rest of you feel here,
but I want to know the outrage
and the hate I have for what the
American nation does and to try
to understand how I feel. I can
do nothing."
He concluded, in a quiet voice,
"I also want Joel Smith and
Dick Lyman (provost) to know
that despite this, there is
nothing they can threaten me
with that is going to stop us
from trying to stop what the
American nation is doing."
Medical student Marc Sapir,
the last defendent to speak, said
"I think that everyone in this
room is on trial, is being put on
trial, by the administration. And
I think that includes the Judicial
Council and it includes everyone
who is here to watch."

was represented by counsel.
Braunstein faces an additional
Fundamental Standard violation
charge.
Council Chairman Richard
Such said he did not know when
a verdict would be reached.
"This could take a long time,"
he said.
The speakers talked on differ
ent aspects of the case. Barry
Greenberg, graduate in political
science, led off with a "general
analysis" of the case.
"The question is, who in
this room has the right to
Judge and who In this room
ought to be judge*!," Green
berg said. Then he narrowed
his discussion to Smith and
his associate dean, Willard G.
Wyman, who were both in the
room.
Greenberg attacked what he
called the hypocrisy of the Fun
damental Standard (the general
code of student conduct) and
the University's policy on cam
pus demonstrations.
The Standard demands con
duct worthy of "good citizens."
Greenberg asked, "Who has the

right to define what is a good
citizen and what is demanded
of him?"
"If I were to call as witnesses
the people who really qualify as
witnesses, then I would have to
call on the people of Vietnam,
the people of the Dominican Re
public, the people of South Af
rica, and all the other people of
Asia, Latin America and Africa
who are being oppressed and
destroyed by this nation's and
this University's foreign policy,"
Greenberg said.
Then senior Michael Miller,
who is not a defendent, spoke
on specific points of evidence
and the hearing's procedure.
He charged the method of
picking the defendents out of
pictures taken at the demon
stration was "highly selective
and somewhat arbitrary.
"It seems these people were
indicted not for being in the
CIA demonstration alone but
because they happen to be
friends of Bill Wyman (associ
ate dean)," Miller said.
Wyman has testified earlier
he had picked the defendents
from photographs taken at the
demonstration.
Then Miller charged the Uni
versity's campus demonstration
policy is ill defined when it says
demonstrations should take
place in an orderly manner.
Miller said none of the dem
onstrators engaged in violent
acts. By contrast, he said, one
of the demonstrators, Associate
English Professor Bruce Frank
lin, was assaulted by the assis
tant chief of the campus police.
Compared with this action,
Miller said, the charge against
Yale Braunstein of "sticking a
picket sign through a door is
rather trivial."
Miller also accused the ad
ministration of not presenting
evidence showing the extent

of each individual's participa
tion in the demonstration.
Professor Charles Stein, the
noted prize-winning statistician,
spoke next, saying the demon
strators should be judged in
light of what they were oppos
ing.
Stein deplored that opponents
to the Vietnam war were "re
strained from opposing the war
because of the fear of interfer
ing in a very minor way with
some peripheral activity of the
University which is in fact part
of what we are struggling
against."
Then Franklin spoke. Frank
lin was active in the demonstra
tion himself, but since he is a
professor, he has not faced trial
before the Judicial Council.
He called the demonstrators'
trial an effort "to repress this
movement and to intimidate it.
It's not a local thing. It's some
thing which is part of a repres
sion that's going on all over the
country right now.
"These are crimes without
victims," Franklin said. "We
are told that the rights of cer
tain people were violated but
where are these people to tes
tify? Where is somebody to
come here and testify that
'My rights were violated by
these demonstrators. I am a
pedestrian who was interfered
with.* ?"
Sophomore Leonard Siegal, a
defendent, then talked about
"Stanford as a channeling agent
for the military and big busi
ness."
"According to an opinion cur
rently held by the Defense De
partment," the letter read, "U.S.
universities are not contributing
as much as they should to tech
nology.... It is doubtful that
this charge could be leveled at
Stanford."
Jeff Browning, junior, English
major and a defendent, said one
of the University's prime con
cerns is "controlling resources,"
whether students or professors.
Browning said the Associ
ated Students organization is
another method of controlling
students because students de
rive no real power from it but
are led to believe they do.
Defendent Jack Gerson said
"If you can see what is going on
(with U.S. foreign policy) and
you don't act to try to change
that, then I think you're morally
guilty and you're violating the
Fundamental Standard of Stan
ford University."
Defendent Guy Smythe, a
sophomore, said, "I don't know
how the rest of you feel here,
but I want to know the outrage
and the hate I have for what the
American nation does and to try
to understand how I feel. I can
do nothing."
He concluded, in a quiet voice,
"I also want Joel Smith and
Dick Lyman (provost) to know
that despite this, there is
nothing they can threaten me
with that is going to stop us
from trying to stop what the
American nation is doing."
Medical student Marc Sapir,
the last defendent to speak, said
"I think that everyone in this
room is on trial, is being put on
trial, by the administration. And
I think that includes the Judicial
Council and it includes everyone
who is here to watch."
The student Judicial Council
late Monday night closed out
the last of its hearings on the
case of ten students charged

Wyman, who were both in the
room.
Greenberg attacked what he
called the hypocrisy of the Fun
damental Standard (the general
code of student conduct) and
the University's policy on cam
pus demonstrations.
The Standard demands con
duct worthy of "good citizens."
Greenberg asked, "Who has the

right to define what is a good
citizen and what is demanded
of him?"
"If I were to call as witnesses
the people who really qualify as
witnesses, then I would have to
call on the people of Vietnam,
the people of the Dominican Re
public, the people of South Af
rica, and all the other people of
Asia, Latin America and Africa
who are being oppressed and
destroyed by this nation's and
this University's foreign policy,"
Greenberg said.
Then senior Michael Miller,
who is not a defendent, spoke
on specific points of evidence
and the hearing's procedure.
He charged the method of
picking the defendents out of
pictures taken at the demon
stration was "highly selective
and somewhat arbitrary.
"It seems these people were
indicted not for being in the
CIA demonstration alone but
because they happen to be
friends of Bill Wyman (associ
ate dean)," Miller said.
Wyman has testified earlier
he had picked the defendents
from photographs taken at the
demonstration.
Then Miller charged the Uni
versity's campus demonstration
policy is ill defined when it says
demonstrations should take
place in an orderly manner.
Miller said none of the dem
onstrators engaged in violent
acts. By contrast, he said, one
of the demonstrators, Associate
English Professor Bruce Frank
lin, was assaulted by the assis
tant chief of the campus police.
Compared with this action,
Miller said, the charge against
Yale Braunstein of "sticking a
picket sign through a door is
rather trivial."
Miller also accused the ad
ministration of not presenting
evidence showing the extent

of each individual's participa
tion in the demonstration.
Professor Charles Stein, the
noted prize-winning statistician,
spoke next, saying the demon
strators should be judged in
light of what they were oppos
ing.
Stein deplored that opponents
to the Vietnam war were "re
strained from opposing the war
because of the fear of interfer
ing in a very minor way with
some peripheral activity of the
University which is in fact part
of what we are struggling
against."
Then Franklin spoke. Frank
lin was active in the demonstra
tion himself, but since he is a
professor, he has not faced trial
before the Judicial Council.
He called the demonstrators'
trial an effort "to repress this
movement and to intimidate it.
It's not a local thing. It's some
thing which is part of a repres
sion that's going on all over the
country right now.
"These are crimes without
victims," Franklin said. "We
are told that the rights of cer
tain people were violated but
where are these people to tes
tify? Where is somebody to
come here and testify that
'My rights were violated by
these demonstrators. I am a
pedestrian who was interfered
with.* ?"
Sophomore Leonard Siegal, a
defendent, then talked about
"Stanford as a channeling agent
for the military and big busi
ness."
"According to an opinion cur
rently held by the Defense De
partment," the letter read, "U.S.
universities are not contributing
as much as they should to tech
nology.... It is doubtful that
this charge could be leveled at
Stanford."
Jeff Browning, junior, English
major and a defendent, said one
of the University's prime con
cerns is "controlling resources,"
whether students or professors.
Browning said the Associ
ated Students organization is
another method of controlling
students because students de
rive no real power from it but
are led to believe they do.
Defendent Jack Gerson said
"If you can see what is going on
(with U.S. foreign policy) and
you don't act to try to change
that, then I think you're morally
guilty and you're violating the
Fundamental Standard of Stan
ford University."
Defendent Guy Smythe, a
sophomore, said, "I don't know
how the rest of you feel here,
but I want to know the outrage
and the hate I have for what the
American nation does and to try
to understand how I feel. I can
do nothing."
He concluded, in a quiet voice,
"I also want Joel Smith and
Dick Lyman (provost) to know
that despite this, there is
nothing they can threaten me
with that is going to stop us
from trying to stop what the
American nation is doing."
Medical student Marc Sapir,
the last defendent to speak, said
"I think that everyone in this
room is on trial, is being put on
trial, by the administration. And
I think that includes the Judicial
Council and it includes everyone
who is here to watch."
The student Judicial Council
late Monday night closed out
the last of its hearings on the
case of ten students charged
with illegally demonstrating
against Central Intelligence
Agency recruiting on campus.
At previous meetings, the
council had heard evidence from
Dean of Students Joel Smith
establishing the defendants'
presence at Encina Hall the
morning of Nov. 1.
Monday night the defendents
and several others spoke in
their defense before the council
and an audience of 100 in Tres
idder Union. All but two of the
defendents addressed the coun
cil and were questioned by it.
One of them, Yale Braunstein,
was represented by counsel.
Braunstein faces an additional
Fundamental Standard violation
charge.
Council Chairman Richard
Such said he did not know when
a verdict would be reached.
"This could take a long time,"
he said.
The speakers talked on differ

Greenberg, graduate in political
science, led off with a "general

"The question is, who in
