# Beta Chi To Offer Coed Plan To Dean
## 
### DAN SNELL 
In another move toward co
educational fraternities, Beta
Chi voted Tuesday night to pre
sent a proposal to the dean of
students to permit eight women
to live in the house.
The number represents the
capacity of the fraternity's third
floor, where tentative plans call
for the women to live. But the
proposal may change to include
more women if there is enough
interest.
Lambda Nu adopted a sim
ilar proposal January 23.
Twenty women chosen by draw
were to live on the first and sec
ond floors of the south wing of
the house, next to Lake La
gunita.
But as yet the dean of stu
dent's office has not approved
Lambda Nu's plan. House
President Fred Fudacz said
yesterday, "We are carrying
on negotiations this week with
the dean, but I can't say when
we'll have a definite decision."
Dean of Students Joel Smith
reportedly is unhappy that the
Lambda Nu women would not
be full voting members of the
fraternity under the proposal
and that the fraternity would
continue its policy of selective
rush.

Beta Chi voted in the fall of
1966 to go "non-selective". Its
members are chosen by a draw
system when there are more
pledges than room in the house.
But no draw has been necessary
yet.
The Beta Chi proposal calls
for women to share full mem
bership with male members,
to vote in house elections, and
to have house chores. If more
girls apply than places avail
able, there would be a draw.
But the draw would be separ
ate from any possible draw
for men.
House President Tom Amis
and Secretary Craig Wood were
delegated to present the pro
posal to Dean Smith. They were
to sec him this afternoon.
"Lambda Nu's proposal served
as a guideline for ours as far as
the Dean's reaction to it," Amis
said. "Basically we concur with
Lambda Nu's reasons for advo
cating co-educational living."
Lambda Nu's president has
said his house feels that lack of
co-educational living tends to
perpetuate "artificiality" in re
lations between the sexes.
Wood commented, "Beta Chi
is doing this in order to advance
the cause of natural association
between human beings."
One obstacle in Beta Chi's
way is its old building on San
Juan Street near the Lou Henry
Hoover House. About $2500
worth of fire-prevention main
tenance is scheduled for the
house, but it would probably
have to be done whether or
not women move in.
Another problem is finding a
suitable faculty resident to su
pervise the co-educational pro
gram since Beta Chi has none
now. Lambda Nu already has
George Hamrdla, assistant di
rector of overseas campuses, as
faculty resident.
Last February Beta Chi ac
cepted Its first women mem
bers. Three women joined and
were given full voting rights
although they did not live in
the house and took only some
of their meals there.
According to house treasurer

Dave Garvin, there are no such
women associates this quarter.
Beta Chi broke off affiliation
with the Sigma Nu national in
1962 after a "block pledge" of
freshmen objected to exclusion
of orientals and Negroes from
the fraternity. Lambda Nu left
its national, Alpha Kappa Lamb
da, in 1965 after a controversy
over pledge education programs
and financial responsibilities to
the national.
Beta Chi of Sigma Nu was
Stanford's first fraternity, estab
lished in 1891.

with the Sigma Nu national in
1962 after a "block pledge" of
freshmen objected to exclusion
of orientals and Negroes from
the fraternity. Lambda Nu left
its national, Alpha Kappa Lamb
da, in 1965 after a controversy
over pledge education programs
and financial responsibilities to
the national.
Beta Chi of Sigma Nu was
Stanford's first fraternity, estab
lished in 1891.
In another move toward co
educational fraternities, Beta
Chi voted Tuesday night to pre
sent a proposal to the dean of
students to permit eight women
to live in the house.
The number represents the
capacity of the fraternity's third
floor, where tentative plans call
for the women to live. But the
proposal may change to include
more women if there is enough
interest.
Lambda Nu adopted a sim
ilar proposal January 23.
Twenty women chosen by draw
were to live on the first and sec
ond floors of the south wing of
the house, next to Lake La
gunita.
But as yet the dean of stu
dent's office has not approved
Lambda Nu's plan. House
President Fred Fudacz said
yesterday, "We are carrying
on negotiations this week with
the dean, but I can't say when
we'll have a definite decision."
Dean of Students Joel Smith
reportedly is unhappy that the
Lambda Nu women would not
be full voting members of the
fraternity under the proposal
and that the fraternity would
continue its policy of selective
rush.

Beta Chi voted in the fall of
1966 to go "non-selective". Its
members are chosen by a draw
system when there are more
pledges than room in the house.
But no draw has been necessary
yet.
The Beta Chi proposal calls
for women to share full mem
bership with male members,
to vote in house elections, and
to have house chores. If more
girls apply than places avail
able, there would be a draw.
But the draw would be separ
ate from any possible draw
for men.
House President Tom Amis
and Secretary Craig Wood were
delegated to present the pro
posal to Dean Smith. They were
to sec him this afternoon.
"Lambda Nu's proposal served
as a guideline for ours as far as
the Dean's reaction to it," Amis
said. "Basically we concur with
Lambda Nu's reasons for advo
cating co-educational living."
Lambda Nu's president has
said his house feels that lack of
co-educational living tends to
perpetuate "artificiality" in re
lations between the sexes.
Wood commented, "Beta Chi
is doing this in order to advance
the cause of natural association
between human beings."
One obstacle in Beta Chi's
way is its old building on San
Juan Street near the Lou Henry
Hoover House. About $2500
worth of fire-prevention main
tenance is scheduled for the
house, but it would probably
have to be done whether or
not women move in.
Another problem is finding a
suitable faculty resident to su
pervise the co-educational pro
gram since Beta Chi has none
now. Lambda Nu already has
George Hamrdla, assistant di
rector of overseas campuses, as
faculty resident.
Last February Beta Chi ac
cepted Its first women mem
bers. Three women joined and
were given full voting rights
although they did not live in
the house and took only some
of their meals there.
According to house treasurer

Dave Garvin, there are no such
women associates this quarter.
