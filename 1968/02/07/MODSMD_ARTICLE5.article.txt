## South Koreans 'Indignant' Over Secret Negotiations 
### 
SEOUL (AP) — The tempo of
offical protest against socret
U.S. negotiations with the North
Koreans for the return of the
USS Pueblo increased Tuesday
night. The National Assembly
adopted a resolution expressing
"national indignation" at the
negotiations.
Park Choon-kyoo, chairman of
the Foreign Affairs Committee,
told the assembly that South Ko

rea was being shut out of the
talks at the armistice town of
Panmunjom on sublets of vital
concern to the country.
Park's remarks and the as
sembly's action reflected grow
ing government concern over
the U.S. handling of the current
crisis. They followed closely a
protest note Premier Chung ll
kwon handed U.S. Ambassador
William J. Porter on the secret
talks.
The assembly's resolution in
sisted that the recent attempt
by North Korean commandos to
assassinate President Chung
Hee Park was more important
to South Korea than North Ko
rea's seizure of the Pueblo.
One legislator explained that
South Korea feared the United
States might sacrifice this coun
try's interests for U.S. global in
terests.
Indignant South Koreans say
the United States did not react
forcefully when the attempt on
Park's life was made Jan. 21
but it alerted all South Korean
and U.S. forces when the Pueblo
was captured two days later.
• Reagan: JSo VP Bid
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Gov.
Reagon said yesterday he would
not accept the Republican vice
presidential nomination this
year, even if he was asked by
the GOP convention and its
presidential nominee to run.
"You would turn down the
head of the ticket.?" Reagan
was asked at his weekly news
conference.
"Yes," Reagan replied.
He had been asked specifically
about the ticket of New York
Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller as
the presidential nominee and
Reagan as his running mate.
"You're talking about two non
candidates," Reagan said.
Of the vice presidency, he
said, "I have no interest in that
job and I would not want it."
• IS etc Syria Attack?
MOSCOW (AP) — Soviet offi
cials are worried that Syria

might make a desperate try for
revenge on Israel this spring,
creating the danger of another
Middle East War.
April is being mentioned in in
formed Soviet circles as the
time Syria might be ready to
begin fresh attacks.
The high-ranking Soviet
sources who gave this informa
tion Tuesday indicated the So
viet Union wants to restrain
Syria. But the informants ex
pressed doubt Moscow has
enough leverage in Damascus.
Syria has refused repeatedly
to subscribe to the Soviet public
position that political means—
rather than military force—
should be used to eliminate the
results of last June's war. Syria
also has rejected U.N. efforts
for peace.
Leftist Syria, which is armed,
advised and aided by the Soviet
Union, follows Soviet sugges
tions on economic policy. It
echoes Kremlin views on most
aspects of world affairs.
But, one Soviet source said:
"When it comes to Israel, they
don't listen to us."

pany in Ford's absence.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—An
attorney for The Resistance sur
rendered two AWOL soldiers at
San Francisco Presidio Tuesday
in a confrontation with military
authorities over their refusal to
fight in Vietnam.

and Steve Mason, 19, San Fran
cisco, disclosed their decision at
a news conference conducted by
attorney Terrance Hallinan.
Campbell, who left the Oak
land Army Base without permis
sion a month ago, said he could
not kill even if the United States

temperated his objection to war
by telling newsmen he would
fight an invader.

ganization which has counseled
other young men to defy the

• Hitch Hits Budget
BERKELEY (AP) — Presi
dent Charles J. Hitch of the Uni
versity of California challenged
Gov. Reagan Tuesday on bud
get proposals that he said "vir
tually eliminated" improvement
and new programs for the vast
nine-campus system for the sec
ond year in a row.
Reminiscent of last year's
budget fight in the legislature,
the new president warned the
Board of Regents that another
austerity belt tightening would
jeopardize a "great university."
The regents proposed an over
all $408.6 million dollar budget
for 1968-69 against $339.2 mil
lion recommended to the legis
<ture by the governor—a dif
ference of $69.4 million.
The differences cut deeply in
every phase of the university—
operating expenses, salary in
creases and capital outlay.
Hitch complained that the
Reagan budget does not provide
enough funds for merit salary
increases and promotions.
He also said that for the sec
ond consecutive year provision
had not been made to meet in
flationary price increases.
In addition to deletion of
"many programs of great im
portance," Hitch said the gov
ernor had not authorized funds
for faculty expansion.
• Romney: 6 Bad Image'
MANCHESTER, N.H. CAP)
—Michigan Gov. George Rom
ney said Tuesday the U.S. im

age around the world is that of
"great big military aggressors
and imperialists." He said that
is a product of American policy
in Vietnam.
At the same time, Romney,
intensifying his campaign as
sault on President Johnson, said
it is self-delusion to pretend that
the Communists in Vietnam
have lost their "great capabili
ty, stamina and confidence."
"The facts are the enemy is
stronger now in South Vietnam
than he's been before," Romney
said. "We've got to get some
body down in Washington who'll
tell the truth. We've had the
wool pulled over our eyes. It's
about time we saw through it."
He told 60 people at a Merri
mack church hall that the United
States is not winning in Viet
nam, no matter what Johnson
says.
Romney said the U.S. should
go on a political offensive to win
popular support in Vietnam, in
sist that the Saigon government
move in that direction, and
press for peace on the basis of
neutralization of the entire area.
• 4 Revolution Needed 9
STEVENS POINT, Wis. (AP)
—Richard M. Nixon told a uni
versity audience Tuesday that
Latin America "needs radical
change, needs a revolution."
"I'm not saying we should go
out and blow up countries," the
former vice president said.
"I'm not talking about march
ing feet, I'm talking about help
ing hands. That's what we need
in Latin America today."
Nixon's comment came after
a student questioner at Stevens
Point University told him point
edly:
"You either want radical so
cial change or you're a liar."
The student, who did not iden
tify himself, said that unless
something is done about Latin
promises, the next American
president would again be "spit
upon" by Latin Americans.
Nixon, while vL-j president,
was jeered and spit upon during
a visit to South America.
