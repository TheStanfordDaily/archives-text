## South Koreans 'Indignant' Over Secret Negotiations 
### 
SEOUL (AP) — The tempo of
offical protest against socret
U.S. negotiations with the North
Koreans for the return of the
USS Pueblo increased Tuesday
night. The National Assembly
adopted a resolution expressing
"national indignation" at the
negotiations.
Park Choon-kyoo, chairman of
the Foreign Affairs Committee,
told the assembly that South Ko

rea was being shut out of the
talks at the armistice town of
Panmunjom on sublets of vital
concern to the country.
Park's remarks and the as
sembly's action reflected grow
ing government concern over
the U.S. handling of the current
crisis. They followed closely a
protest note Premier Chung ll
kwon handed U.S. Ambassador
William J. Porter on the secret
talks.
The assembly's resolution in
sisted that the recent attempt
by North Korean commandos to
assassinate President Chung
Hee Park was more important
to South Korea than North Ko
rea's seizure of the Pueblo.
One legislator explained that
South Korea feared the United
States might sacrifice this coun
try's interests for U.S. global in
terests.
Indignant South Koreans say
the United States did not react
forcefully when the attempt on
Park's life was made Jan. 21
but it alerted all South Korean
and U.S. forces when the Pueblo
was captured two days later.

head of the ticket.?" Reagan
was asked at his weekly news

Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller as

• IS etc Syria Attack?
MOSCOW (AP) — Soviet offi
cials are worried that Syria

might make a desperate try for
revenge on Israel this spring,
creating the danger of another
Middle East War.
April is being mentioned in in
formed Soviet circles as the
time Syria might be ready to
begin fresh attacks.
The high-ranking Soviet
sources who gave this informa
tion Tuesday indicated the So
viet Union wants to restrain
Syria. But the informants ex
pressed doubt Moscow has
enough leverage in Damascus.
Syria has refused repeatedly
to subscribe to the Soviet public
position that political means—
rather than military force—
should be used to eliminate the
results of last June's war. Syria
also has rejected U.N. efforts
for peace.
Leftist Syria, which is armed,
advised and aided by the Soviet
Union, follows Soviet sugges
tions on economic policy. It
echoes Kremlin views on most
aspects of world affairs.
But, one Soviet source said:
"When it comes to Israel, they
don't listen to us."
