# Would You Believe A Revolution?

Wonder of wonders! The philosophers have decided what's good
for the people, and the people agree. When an idea conforms to
both the logical scruples of idealists and popular demand, even the
most jaded observers must sit up and take notice.
We're referring to coeducational housing. In a position paper
released today, the Study of Education's Residence committee (the
philosophers) give an unqualified endorsement to a rapid expan
sion of coed residences next year.
The housing survey last month by Bill Leland's Fact-Finding
committee showed at least 1,500 students (the people) would draw
for coed residences if they were to be available next year. Stanford
undergraduates say the "ideal" residence would be coed, inte
grated with all four classes, and offer an academic program. The
SES committee says its ideal is exactly the same.
The philosophers and the people arrived at the same conclusion
independently—the SES committee had finished its paper before
it knew the results of the housing survey.
The philosophers suggest sophomore, junior and senior women
should be allowed to live off-campus. The survey shows 151 women
want to live off in 1968-69, a perfectly feasible number.
The philosophers say more freshmen should be "integrated" with
upperclassmen. Fine, answer the students in the survey, giving a
strong endorsement to integrated housing.
The philosophers say optional academic programs are desirable
in residences. We agree, say the students, and 22 per cent list aca
demics as a feature of their "ideal" residence.
Most important of all, the survey shows that student desires can
be satisfied by the existing dormitory buildings owned by Stanford.
The computers simply shuffled the numbers to arrive at the distri
bution satisfying the greatest number of first preferences listed by
students. The resulting model calls for demonstration houses, coed
freshmen dorms, and other residences in proportions which admir
ably satisfy the SES committee's suggestion that "residence ideals"
be compromised with a "variety of residence opportunities."
"Great," you reply enthusiastically. Convert those dormitories
and presto, the housing revolution has come to Stanford. Every
thing sounds perfect—the students know what they want, the
philosophers approve, the beds are available. . . .
What? You just can't believe Stanford's administration would
ever do something so daring and imaginative?
How did you guess....
Provost Richard Lyman issued the following statement to ac
company the committee's report:
"At the risk of playing the traditional bureaucrat's role, I think'
I must say—having regard for the amount of work that it took to
make the necessary arrangements for the demonstration houses
last spring—that there is no chance whatever that all of the com
mittee's ideas could be put into effect in 1968-69."
WhyP Why can't student desires be met by, for example, a con
version of Roble, Toyon, and several houses in Lagunita, Wilbur
and Stern to coeducation?
Mr. Lyman alludes to the time and work required to set up the
four demonstration houses last spring. That hectic process was
difficult only because the Dean's office started so late in the year.
The University had insufficient information to choose sites for the
new demonstration houses without precipitating a minor revolu
tion among displaced residents.
But now, this time, it is only February. The Fact-Finding com
mittee has almost completed its comprehensive survey of the possi
bilities of converting various campus residences to coeducation.
The information is available. The Dean's office has time to hammer
out a workable residence plan before spring quarter.
In other conversations we have heard complaints of the costs of
converting residences to house both sexes. But the Fact-Finding
committee's investigations show it costs only $3,000 to convert Ro
ble or a house in Wilbur or Stern and $2,000 to convert Toyon.
Conversion costs in Lagunita aren't yet known.
A lot of money? Not really, particularly when you consider the
fact that the University has $2,809,840 earmarked for new housing
but sitting idle because nobody's sure anymore just what kind of
dormitory we want to build.
Money is no barrier to coed living, nor is time. What is the prob
lem? We're not sure, but suspect that some kind of communications
break-down has occurred between SES, the Fact-Finding commit
tee, the Dean's office, and the Provost. When everyone gets their
signals straight again, we hope there will be no hesitation about
making Stanford a better place to live—now.

Provost Richard Lyman issued the following statement to ac
company the committee's report:
"At the risk of playing the traditional bureaucrat's role, I think'
I must say—having regard for the amount of work that it took to
make the necessary arrangements for the demonstration houses
last spring—that there is no chance whatever that all of the com
mittee's ideas could be put into effect in 1968-69."
WhyP Why can't student desires be met by, for example, a con
version of Roble, Toyon, and several houses in Lagunita, Wilbur
and Stern to coeducation?
Mr. Lyman alludes to the time and work required to set up the
four demonstration houses last spring. That hectic process was
difficult only because the Dean's office started so late in the year.
The University had insufficient information to choose sites for the
new demonstration houses without precipitating a minor revolu
tion among displaced residents.
But now, this time, it is only February. The Fact-Finding com
mittee has almost completed its comprehensive survey of the possi
bilities of converting various campus residences to coeducation.
The information is available. The Dean's office has time to hammer
out a workable residence plan before spring quarter.
In other conversations we have heard complaints of the costs of
converting residences to house both sexes. But the Fact-Finding
committee's investigations show it costs only $3,000 to convert Ro
ble or a house in Wilbur or Stern and $2,000 to convert Toyon.
Conversion costs in Lagunita aren't yet known.
A lot of money? Not really, particularly when you consider the
fact that the University has $2,809,840 earmarked for new housing
but sitting idle because nobody's sure anymore just what kind of
dormitory we want to build.
Money is no barrier to coed living, nor is time. What is the prob
lem? We're not sure, but suspect that some kind of communications
break-down has occurred between SES, the Fact-Finding commit
tee, the Dean's office, and the Provost. When everyone gets their
signals straight again, we hope there will be no hesitation about
making Stanford a better place to live—now.
Wonder of wonders! The philosophers have decided what's good
for the people, and the people agree. When an idea conforms to
both the logical scruples of idealists and popular demand, even the
most jaded observers must sit up and take notice.
We're referring to coeducational housing. In a position paper
released today, the Study of Education's Residence committee (the
philosophers) give an unqualified endorsement to a rapid expan
sion of coed residences next year.
The housing survey last month by Bill Leland's Fact-Finding
committee showed at least 1,500 students (the people) would draw
for coed residences if they were to be available next year. Stanford
undergraduates say the "ideal" residence would be coed, inte
grated with all four classes, and offer an academic program. The
SES committee says its ideal is exactly the same.
The philosophers and the people arrived at the same conclusion
independently—the SES committee had finished its paper before
it knew the results of the housing survey.
The philosophers suggest sophomore, junior and senior women
should be allowed to live off-campus. The survey shows 151 women
want to live off in 1968-69, a perfectly feasible number.
The philosophers say more freshmen should be "integrated" with
upperclassmen. Fine, answer the students in the survey, giving a
strong endorsement to integrated housing.
The philosophers say optional academic programs are desirable
in residences. We agree, say the students, and 22 per cent list aca
demics as a feature of their "ideal" residence.
Most important of all, the survey shows that student desires can
be satisfied by the existing dormitory buildings owned by Stanford.
The computers simply shuffled the numbers to arrive at the distri
bution satisfying the greatest number of first preferences listed by
students. The resulting model calls for demonstration houses, coed
freshmen dorms, and other residences in proportions which admir
ably satisfy the SES committee's suggestion that "residence ideals"
be compromised with a "variety of residence opportunities."

signals straight again, we hope there will be no hesitation about
making Stanford a better place to live—now.
