# Our Man Hoppe
## A 						Private Meets The Enemy 
### Art Hoppe 
Private Oliver Drab, 378 18-
4454, lost from his patrol, which
was often the case, rounded a
bend in the dusty road and came
face to face with a figure clad in
black pajamas and clutching an
automatic rifle.
"Hi! cried Private Drab. He
squeezed off a burst from his
M-16 which neatly defoliated the
topmost branch of a nearby tree
and dove head first into a drain
age ditch on the right of the
road.
The guerrilla, equally startled,
took similar evasive action into
a ditch on the left. Silence once
again slipped over the country
side.
A full minute passed. Private
Drab raised his head an inch or
two and, very tentatively, called
out, "Hi?"
There was a long pause. Fin
ally the guerrilla, equally ten
tatively, said, "Hi?"
Another pause. "Say, I've got
an idea," said Private Drab. "I'll
promise not to shoot at you, if
you promise not to shoot at me."
For a few moments the guer
rilla was silent. Then he said,
"Okay."
Very, very slowly each man
rose and warily climbed back
up on the road where they stood,
once again, face to face.

"My name's Oliver Drab," said
Private Drab, not knowing what
else to say. "Would you like a
cigarette?"
"Thank you," said the guer
rilla. "My name is Nguyen
Quon."
"Hi," said Private Drab, sling
ing his rifle over his shoulder to
light Quon's cigarette. "Sure is
a lousy war, isn't it?"
Quon nodded.
"What are you fighting for,
anyway?" asked Private Drab
curiously. And then, fearing he'd

been Impolite, he added, "My
captain says I'm fighting to
stem the tide of Communism."
"My cadre leader," said Quon,
"says I am fighting against the
foreign barbarians who are im
perialist lackeys of President
Johnson."
"Well, that lets me out," said
Private Drab with relief. "I
didn't even vote for him and I
don't think I would next time,
even if I were old enough. Be
sides, I'm not a foreigner. I'm
an American. Excuse me, but
are you a puppet of Ho Chi
Minh's?"
Quon shook his head. "I don't
even know him."
"Then why are you fighting?"
"Well, said Quon thoughtfully,
"these men with guns came to

my village and told me to go
and fight. They were very angry
and I was afraid. So I went."
"Gosh, we've sure got a lot
in common," said Private Drab
brightly. "You should seo my
draft board." He frowned. "I'm
sorry I shot a{ you, honest. But
I was afraid you were going to
shoot at me."
Quon nodded. "I was out of
ammunition."
"Oh, that's a terrible feeling,"
said Private Drab sympatheti
cally. "I got some to spare, but
I don't suppose it'd fit your
weapon." He paused. "Well,
maybe we ought to get back to
the war."
And, after, shaking hands,
they parted, each backing off
the way he'd come. Once the

bend separated them again, both
began to run.

"He was a nice guy," Private
Drab said later in recounting
his experience to his friend, Cor
poral Partz. "And I don't think
he'd of shot at me at the end
there, even if he had the ammo."
"Never underestimate the en
emy, Oliver," said Corporal
Par.tz, picking at a sliver in his
thumb with his trench knife.
"Don't forget, he's got a lot
more reason to fight than you
do."
"You mean like home and
country and stuff?"
"Nope, I mean if you don't
fight you get five years in Le
venworth," said Corporal Partz.
"And if he don't, he gets shot."
