I have just seen an article that appeared in Stanford daily magailiw
for Friday, January 26, concerned in part with a letter that t distributed to
students at Stanford: the article is somewhat inaccurate in its first-paragraph
statement that the letter attacks graduate education, which is a rather
general statement; the letter, written in what the journalist calls my turgid,
frustratingly implicative style, is by its manner of presentation critical of a
process that the letter intimates is a pervrsion of education. Also, from
the article it is possible for the reader to infer that I was dismissed from the
Department, or from the University, which is not trues I was fired orally by
the professor from his particular group. Since the article states that Paul
Saltman is a supporter of mine (rather than my views), it is probably relevant
to say that I doubt Mr. Saltman has ever heard of me.
