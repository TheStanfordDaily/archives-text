• Russian Fleet IS ears
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Russians have moved a force of
warships into Korean waters
where American fighting ships
have been concentrated in the
Pueblo crisis.
Government sources said
Wednesday there are 10 or 15
Soviet warships in the area, in
cluding cruisers, destroyers and
frigates. They are believed to
have come from Vladivostok,
Russia's main Far East naval
base.
Meanwhile, the United States
has withdrawn the giant 85,000-
ton aircraft carrier Enterprise
from the Sea of Japan, leaving
behind two other carriers, de
stroyers and support ships in a
force of about 20 U.S. vessels.
The sources, disclosing these
developments, said there was no
connection between the pres
ence of the Soviet ships and the
withdrawal of the Enterprise.
But they conceded the actions
could create the impression of a
partial American pullback in the
face of Soviet naval pressure.
Withdrawal of the Enterprise
to the southern fringe of the
Korean Strait was tied by some
U.S. sources to diplomatic moves
aimed at getting Communist
North Korea to return the in
telligence ship Pueblo and the
82 survivors of her crew.
• PFP Candidates Out
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
The State Supreme Court Wed
nesday refused a place on the
ballot to the Peace and Freedom
Party for candidates who have
not yet filed for the June pri
mary.
The party, which recently
gained a place on the ballot
through an initiative petition,
had asked for a writ of mandate
which would have required Sec
retary of State Frank M. Jor
dan to reserve places on the bal
lot for party candidates whether
they had filed for election or not.
The brief 5-2 opinion said
merely that "the relief request
ed is precluded by the elections
code."
Justices Mathew Tobriner and
Stanley Mosk dissented, stating

in their minority opinion that
they felt the elections code was
not intended to apply to anyone
in the position of the Peace and
Freedom Party.
• Air War In 4th Year
SAIGON (AP) — The bomb
ing campaign against North
Vietnam, a subject of interna
tional controversy, entered Its
fourth year Wednesday while al
lied forces battled in the South
to douse remaining flames of the
biggest Communist offensive of
the war.
U.S. squadrons have ham
mered North Vietnamese supply
lines and other targets with
more than a million tons of ex
plosives since 49 carrier-based
Navy jets launched the cam
paign against military barracks
and staging areas around Dong
Hoi, 40 miles north of the bor
der, Feb. 7, 1965.
Nearly 1,000 American airmen
have been killed or captured and
at least 797 planes, worth $1.6
billion, have been downed in the
execution of more than 200,000
sorties—single combat flights—
over the North from the demili
tarized zone to points within 10
miles of Red China's frontier.
• Belgian PM Quits
BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) —
Premier Paul Van Den Boeyants
told Parliament today his gov
ernment is resigning because of
a dispute between French-speak
ing and Flemish-speaking Bel
gians.
Van Den Boeynants told the
House of Representatives: "Sev
eral ministers have expressed
the wish to leave the govern
ment. Under these circumstan
ces, I have asked to be received
by King Baudouin to present the
resignation of the government."
The Belgian coalition govern
ment of Social Christians and
members of the Party for Liber
ty and Progress broke over the
issue of moving the French sec
tion of Louvain University to
Wallonia.
• Ask War On Crime
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson asked Congress

Wednesday to approve a mas
sive assault on crime, with spe
cial emphasis on tougher laws
to curb dangerous drugs—main
ly LSD and other hallucinogens.
The program also includes in
dividual efforts aimed against
organized crime, gambling, riot
ing and alcoholism.
The President linked a re
newed call for legislation to curb
firearms sales with a new pro
posal which would make it a
crime to cross state lines to in
cite riots. He said these are
aimed at "two causes of death
and destruction — the criminal
agitator and the gun."
Johnson called again for en
actment of his Safe Streets and
Crime Control legislation—and
doubled the first year's appro
priation request to $100 million.
Last year he asked for $50 mil
lion to help cities and states im
prove local law enforcement and
raise police salaries.

SAIGON (AP) — Radio mes
sages from a Special Forces
camp on the western flank of
U.S. Marine lines below the de

inroads on the camp Wednesday
by Hanoi regulars attacking for
the first known time with Rus
sian-made tanks.
Sporadic fighting persisted in
and around Saigon, much of it
in the Chinese sector, Cholon.
Jet bombers heavily attacked an
enemy detachment spotted short
ly after 2 a.m. Thursday five
miles south of the city limits.
Explosion of the bombs jarred

• Kuchel To Announce
LOS ANGELES (AP) — U.S.
Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel, R-Calif.,
is expected to announce today
that he is a candidate for anoth

Kuchel has called a news con

• Wall St. Summary
NEW YORK (AP) — A watch
ing-and-waiting stock market
mounted a small technical rally

Wednesday but whittled most of
it away before the close. Trad
ing diminished further as cau
tion continued.
Volume was 8.38 million
shares compared with 8.57 mil
lion Tuesday and, for the third
straight day, was the smallest
in the 2V* weeks of abbreviated
market sessions.
Advances outnumbered de
clines for the first time since
Jan. 26 and most market indi
cators were a little higher.
The Dow Jones average of 30
industrial blue chips, however,
erased an early gain of 2.65 and
ended with a loss of 1.33 at
859.92.
Wall Street was still preoccu

• Ask War On Crime
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi

Wednesday to approve a mas

The program also includes in
dividual efforts aimed against
organized crime, gambling, riot

The President linked a re

firearms sales with a new pro

aimed at "two causes of death

Johnson called again for en

NEW YORK (AP) — A watch

mounted a small technical rally

Wednesday but whittled most of
it away before the close. Trad

Volume was 8.38 million
shares compared with 8.57 mil

in the 2V* weeks of abbreviated

Advances outnumbered de

The Dow Jones average of 30

erased an early gain of 2.65 and

• Russian Fleet IS ears
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Russians have moved a force of
warships into Korean waters
where American fighting ships
have been concentrated in the
Pueblo crisis.
Government sources said
Wednesday there are 10 or 15
Soviet warships in the area, in
cluding cruisers, destroyers and
frigates. They are believed to
have come from Vladivostok,
Russia's main Far East naval
base.
Meanwhile, the United States
has withdrawn the giant 85,000-
ton aircraft carrier Enterprise
from the Sea of Japan, leaving
behind two other carriers, de
stroyers and support ships in a
force of about 20 U.S. vessels.
The sources, disclosing these
developments, said there was no
connection between the pres
ence of the Soviet ships and the
withdrawal of the Enterprise.
But they conceded the actions
could create the impression of a
partial American pullback in the
face of Soviet naval pressure.
Withdrawal of the Enterprise
to the southern fringe of the
Korean Strait was tied by some
U.S. sources to diplomatic moves
aimed at getting Communist
North Korea to return the in
telligence ship Pueblo and the
82 survivors of her crew.

• Wall St. Summary
NEW YORK (AP) — A watch
ing-and-waiting stock market
mounted a small technical rally

Wednesday but whittled most of
it away before the close. Trad
ing diminished further as cau
tion continued.
Volume was 8.38 million
shares compared with 8.57 mil
lion Tuesday and, for the third
straight day, was the smallest
in the 2V* weeks of abbreviated
market sessions.
Advances outnumbered de

Jan. 26 and most market indi

The Dow Jones average of 30
industrial blue chips, however,
erased an early gain of 2.65 and

• Russian Fleet IS ears
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Russians have moved a force of
warships into Korean waters
where American fighting ships
have been concentrated in the
Pueblo crisis.
Government sources said
Wednesday there are 10 or 15
Soviet warships in the area, in
cluding cruisers, destroyers and
frigates. They are believed to
have come from Vladivostok,
Russia's main Far East naval
base.
Meanwhile, the United States
has withdrawn the giant 85,000-
ton aircraft carrier Enterprise
from the Sea of Japan, leaving
behind two other carriers, de
stroyers and support ships in a
force of about 20 U.S. vessels.
The sources, disclosing these
developments, said there was no
connection between the pres
ence of the Soviet ships and the
withdrawal of the Enterprise.
But they conceded the actions
could create the impression of a
partial American pullback in the
face of Soviet naval pressure.
Withdrawal of the Enterprise
to the southern fringe of the
Korean Strait was tied by some
U.S. sources to diplomatic moves
aimed at getting Communist
North Korea to return the in
telligence ship Pueblo and the
82 survivors of her crew.
• PFP Candidates Out
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
The State Supreme Court Wed
nesday refused a place on the
ballot to the Peace and Freedom
Party for candidates who have
not yet filed for the June pri

The party, which recently
gained a place on the ballot
through an initiative petition,
had asked for a writ of mandate
which would have required Sec
retary of State Frank M. Jor
dan to reserve places on the bal
lot for party candidates whether
they had filed for election or not.
The brief 5-2 opinion said
merely that "the relief request
ed is precluded by the elections
code."
Justices Mathew Tobriner and
Stanley Mosk dissented, stating

in their minority opinion that
they felt the elections code was
not intended to apply to anyone
in the position of the Peace and
Freedom Party.

SAIGON (AP) — The bomb

to douse remaining flames of the
biggest Communist offensive of
the war.
U.S. squadrons have ham

Nearly 1,000 American airmen

WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi

Wednesday to approve a mas

The program also includes in

organized crime, gambling, riot

The President linked a re

Johnson called again for en

• Russian Fleet IS ears
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Russians have moved a force of
warships into Korean waters
where American fighting ships
have been concentrated in the
Pueblo crisis.
Government sources said
Wednesday there are 10 or 15
Soviet warships in the area, in
cluding cruisers, destroyers and
frigates. They are believed to
have come from Vladivostok,
Russia's main Far East naval
base.
Meanwhile, the United States
has withdrawn the giant 85,000-
ton aircraft carrier Enterprise
from the Sea of Japan, leaving
behind two other carriers, de
stroyers and support ships in a
force of about 20 U.S. vessels.
The sources, disclosing these
developments, said there was no
connection between the pres
ence of the Soviet ships and the
withdrawal of the Enterprise.
But they conceded the actions
could create the impression of a
partial American pullback in the
face of Soviet naval pressure.
Withdrawal of the Enterprise
to the southern fringe of the
Korean Strait was tied by some
U.S. sources to diplomatic moves
aimed at getting Communist
North Korea to return the in
telligence ship Pueblo and the
82 survivors of her crew.
• PFP Candidates Out
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
The State Supreme Court Wed
nesday refused a place on the
ballot to the Peace and Freedom
Party for candidates who have
not yet filed for the June pri
mary.
The party, which recently
gained a place on the ballot
through an initiative petition,
had asked for a writ of mandate
which would have required Sec
retary of State Frank M. Jor
dan to reserve places on the bal
lot for party candidates whether
they had filed for election or not.
The brief 5-2 opinion said
merely that "the relief request
ed is precluded by the elections
code."
Justices Mathew Tobriner and
Stanley Mosk dissented, stating

in their minority opinion that
they felt the elections code was
not intended to apply to anyone
in the position of the Peace and
Freedom Party.

ing campaign against North
Vietnam, a subject of interna
tional controversy, entered Its
fourth year Wednesday while al
lied forces battled in the South
to douse remaining flames of the
biggest Communist offensive of
the war.

Nearly 1,000 American airmen
have been killed or captured and
at least 797 planes, worth $1.6
billion, have been downed in the
execution of more than 200,000
sorties—single combat flights—
over the North from the demili
tarized zone to points within 10
miles of Red China's frontier.

by King Baudouin to present the

• Ask War On Crime
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson asked Congress

Wednesday to approve a mas
sive assault on crime, with spe
cial emphasis on tougher laws
to curb dangerous drugs—main
ly LSD and other hallucinogens.
The program also includes in
dividual efforts aimed against
organized crime, gambling, riot
ing and alcoholism.
The President linked a re
newed call for legislation to curb
firearms sales with a new pro
posal which would make it a
crime to cross state lines to in
cite riots. He said these are
aimed at "two causes of death
and destruction — the criminal
agitator and the gun."
Johnson called again for en
actment of his Safe Streets and
Crime Control legislation—and
doubled the first year's appro
priation request to $100 million.
Last year he asked for $50 mil
lion to help cities and states im
prove local law enforcement and
raise police salaries.

• Wall St. Summary
NEW YORK (AP) — A watch
ing-and-waiting stock market
mounted a small technical rally

Wednesday but whittled most of
it away before the close. Trad
ing diminished further as cau

Volume was 8.38 million
shares compared with 8.57 mil

straight day, was the smallest
in the 2V* weeks of abbreviated
market sessions.
Advances outnumbered de
clines for the first time since
Jan. 26 and most market indi

The Dow Jones average of 30
industrial blue chips, however,
erased an early gain of 2.65 and
