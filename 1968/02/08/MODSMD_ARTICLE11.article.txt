# Our Man Hoppe
## A 						Frat Is Not A Coed Home 
### Art Hopper 
Stanford University
You can't pick up a literate
magazine these days without
reading a piece entitled, "The
Crisis in American Universities"
or some such.
And it's true that our institu
tions of higher learning face
seemingly insoluable problems
that keep our campuses in con
stant turmoil. The worst, of
course, is parking.
But other seemingly-insolua
ble problems arise. After a
young gentleman has finally
found a parking place and reg
istered for his classes, what does
he want? He wants to live with
a young lady.
In the academic community
this is called "Coeducational Liv
ing." Which I'm sure it is. And
to meet this demand, Stanford
and other universities are inte
grating their dormitories with
young ladies living happily on
one floor, young gentlemen liv
ing happily on another, and stair
monitors growing gray before
their time.
This, naturally, has caused
problems. For example, applica
tions have fallen off to fraterni
ties, which believe only in

brotherhood. The question we
face today, then, is "Can Our
Fraternities Meet This Chal
lenge?"
They can. Here at Stanford,
both the Lambda Nu and Beta
Chi fraternites have applied to
the Dean's Office for permission
to take in young ladies as broth
ers.
• * »
Lambda Nu wants twenty
young ladies to come live with
them as brothers. The men of
Beta Chi, whose demands are
smaller, want eight.
Originally, Lambda Nu wished
to select its young ladies
through rushing. "I don't mind
taking a chance once in a while
on blind date," said one mem
ber. "But for a whole academic
year?"
But now both fraternites say
they will accept a lottery sys
tem. Or, to put it another way,
they will take any young ladies
they can get. This shows how
democratic fraternity men have
become. Or something.
Well, I don't wish to sound
like an old fogey, but I foresee
a grave problem here. I'm not

talking about stockings hanging
in the bathroom or alumni
bursting into their old frat bed
rooms during Homecoming
Week. I'm talking about a really
grave problem:
How does a young lady break
the news to her parents that
she's made a fraternity?
"Hi, Mom, Hi, Dad," says Miss
Daphne Darling, nervously
greeting her folks on the steps
of dear old Watsa Nu. "What a
marvie surprise."
"Oh, I can't wait to see your
room, dear," says Mrs. Darling.
"Tell me, have you met any
nice young boys?"
"Well, I was chosen 'Sweet
heart of Watsa Nu,"" says
Daphne, "but I think of them
as brothers. And my room's
such a mess. Wouldn't you like
to see the Hydraulic Pumping
Station instead?"
Just then a young man in
undershirt and shaving lather
bustles out the door shouting,
"Daphne, if you use my razor
once more without asking . .

But I suppose even this grave
problem can somehow be re

solved. And as the president of
Beta Chi said, "Beta Chi is do
ing this in order to advance the
cause of natural association be
tween human beings." Of oppo
site sexes.
This natural association being
what it is, we must envision our
young living for four
years with stockings in the bath
room. clogged razors nnri a lot
of chatter at breakfast. And
thus the next grave problem we
must face is:
"Can We Survive as a Nation
of Confirmed Batchelors?"

"Hi, Mom, Hi, Dad," says Miss
Daphne Darling, nervously
greeting her folks on the steps
of dear old Watsa Nu. "What a
marvie surprise."

room, dear," says Mrs. Darling.
"Tell me, have you met any
nice young boys?"
"Well, I was chosen 'Sweet
heart of Watsa Nu,"" says
Daphne, "but I think of them
as brothers. And my room's
such a mess. Wouldn't you like
to see the Hydraulic Pumping
Station instead?"

"Can We Survive as a Nation

Stanford University
You can't pick up a literate
magazine these days without
reading a piece entitled, "The
Crisis in American Universities"
or some such.
And it's true that our institu
tions of higher learning face
seemingly insoluable problems
that keep our campuses in con
stant turmoil. The worst, of
course, is parking.
But other seemingly-insolua
ble problems arise. After a
young gentleman has finally
found a parking place and reg
istered for his classes, what does
he want? He wants to live with
a young lady.
In the academic community
this is called "Coeducational Liv
ing." Which I'm sure it is. And
to meet this demand, Stanford
and other universities are inte
grating their dormitories with
young ladies living happily on
one floor, young gentlemen liv
ing happily on another, and stair
monitors growing gray before
their time.
This, naturally, has caused
problems. For example, applica
tions have fallen off to fraterni
ties, which believe only in

brotherhood. The question we
face today, then, is "Can Our
Fraternities Meet This Chal
lenge?"
They can. Here at Stanford,
both the Lambda Nu and Beta
Chi fraternites have applied to
the Dean's Office for permission
to take in young ladies as broth
ers.

Lambda Nu wants twenty
young ladies to come live with
them as brothers. The men of
Beta Chi, whose demands are
smaller, want eight.
Originally, Lambda Nu wished
to select its young ladies
through rushing. "I don't mind
taking a chance once in a while
on blind date," said one mem
ber. "But for a whole academic
year?"
But now both fraternites say
they will accept a lottery sys
tem. Or, to put it another way,
they will take any young ladies
they can get. This shows how
democratic fraternity men have
become. Or something.
Well, I don't wish to sound
like an old fogey, but I foresee
a grave problem here. I'm not

talking about stockings hanging
in the bathroom or alumni
bursting into their old frat bed
rooms during Homecoming
Week. I'm talking about a really
grave problem:
How does a young lady break
the news to her parents that
she's made a fraternity?
