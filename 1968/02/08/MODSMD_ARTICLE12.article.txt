# Richard Nixon's Cross
## 
### Max Lerner 
Every four years we hear
that the Republicans are mov
ing away from the Eastern Es
tablishment. This year they
have moved back, since the race
in the final stretch will doubt
less be between Richard Nixon
and Nelson Rockefeller, both of
them today New Yorkers, with
not a single non-New Yorker
around to dispute them.
V Nixon's formal decision to
run, which has been a surprise
free prediction for a year, hasn't
changed a thing. Rockefeller's
decision to contest Oregon in a
write-in campaign makes the
final confrontation between the
two men more certain than ever.
I don't rule out a possible
Nixon victory. He is strong in
the Midwest, the mountain
states, the South. The local and
state Republican leaders are po
litically in his debt for past fa
vors. He is someone they under
stand, while they feel vaguely
uncomfortable with Rockefeller.
If the country were composed
only of Republicans and South
ern Democrats, he would win
handily.
But it isn't, and he won't. The
reason is that even the Repub
licans, despite their long-stand
ing suicide drive, want to win
this year, and Nixon is an un
likely winner against President
Johnson.
Smell of Defeat
The best one can say about
Nixon's chances is that he has
largely managed to overcome
the smell of defeat that has
clung to him. But that isn't
enough, because it is only the
negative of a negative. What
Rockefeller has is something
positive; the knowledge of his
appeal to independents and to
Democrats, therefore the faint

but unmistakable start of the
smell of victory.
Thus, Nixon's cross is Rocke
feller. True, he may say and
even feel that he has borne and
survived worse ones. But I doubt
whether many Americans are
terribly interested in what they
now regard as ancient history.
Nixon sees his life as a suc
cession of crises: the Hiss-Cham
bers crisis, the Nixon fund, the
stoning in South America, the
kitchen debate with Khrush
chev, the TV disaster with John
Kennedy. But some of them hap
pened 15 or 20 years ago. The
world is different now.
In fact, the same quality of
remoteness which has made
many people forgive Nixon's
past image and trespasses has
also made them forget his past
crises and triumphs. The trauma
of President Kennedy's assassi
nation, of the war, of the big
city riots has erased many me
mories. There is a gulf between
our era and the era of Robert
Taft and Dwight Eisenhower in
which Nixon experienced his
grandeurs and miseries.
A sweeping imagination could
span the gulf, but Nixon — who
has brains and cleverness and
perhaps even some principle —
doesn't have the needed quality
of imagination. It isn't so much
that he is a loser, but that he
doesn't seem to belong to our
time, as Bobby Kennedy does
and, despite their age, Mr. John
son and Rockefeller do.
The "new Nixon" is unques
tionably more attractive than
the earlier one. He is low-keyed,
more relaxed, even capable of
laughing at his own past de
feats. There is still, of course, a
canned and tinny quality about
his speeches as he swings around
the circuit of local morale-build-

ing meetings, as with his inevit
able opening gambit at univer
sity speeches about being "a
dropout from the electoral col
lege."
But he stays clear of the hys
teria he showed in his outbreak
against the press after his de
feat for the California governor
ship. And he has shown, for bet
ter or wors?, a clinging to his
convictions about the Vietna
mese war in the face of pres
sures to adopt the more flexible
approach that George .Romney
has taken and that Rockefeller
will doubtless take.
The infuriating thing for
Nixon must be the sense that he
is fighting against ghosts. Al
though Romney is his opponent
in New Hampshire and Wiscon
sin and the other primaries, he
is not his real opponent.
Nor are Ronald Reagan and
Charles Percy. There is only
one ultimate opponent, and his
name is Nelson Rockefeller, and
what is galling is that he can't
be got at because he is ho'ed up
in his privileged New York sanc
tuary of being a nonrandidate.
Reluctant Candidate
Thus, Nixon's tactic will have
to be to smoke Rockefeller out
of his sanctuary and into the
open battlefield of ideas and pol
icies. The closest parallel is the
1952 struggle between Taft and
Gen. Eisenhower, when Taft was
the established fiance of the Re
publican Party, but Gen. Eisen
hower was the distant romantic
figure who seemingly had to be
wooed.
Let us face it: in politics, as
in love, it is better not to seem
too anxious. Every political
commentator who says that the
public wants to be wooed has
been wrong.
It doesn't want to be wooed.
It wants to be the wooer, and
it feels most triumphant when
it has overcome the seeming
shyness of the reluctant lover
who is being conquered con
quers.

Every four years we hear
that the Republicans are mov
ing away from the Eastern Es
tablishment. This year they
have moved back, since the race
in the final stretch will doubt
less be between Richard Nixon
and Nelson Rockefeller, both of
them today New Yorkers, with
not a single non-New Yorker
around to dispute them.
V Nixon's formal decision to
run, which has been a surprise
free prediction for a year, hasn't
changed a thing. Rockefeller's
decision to contest Oregon in a
write-in campaign makes the
final confrontation between the
two men more certain than ever.
I don't rule out a possible
Nixon victory. He is strong in
the Midwest, the mountain
states, the South. The local and
state Republican leaders are po
litically in his debt for past fa
vors. He is someone they under
stand, while they feel vaguely
uncomfortable with Rockefeller.
If the country were composed
only of Republicans and South
ern Democrats, he would win
handily.
But it isn't, and he won't. The
reason is that even the Repub
licans, despite their long-stand
ing suicide drive, want to win
this year, and Nixon is an un
likely winner against President
Johnson.
Smell of Defeat
The best one can say about
Nixon's chances is that he has
largely managed to overcome
the smell of defeat that has
clung to him. But that isn't
enough, because it is only the
negative of a negative. What
Rockefeller has is something
positive; the knowledge of his
appeal to independents and to
Democrats, therefore the faint

but unmistakable start of the
smell of victory.
Thus, Nixon's cross is Rocke
feller. True, he may say and
even feel that he has borne and
survived worse ones. But I doubt
whether many Americans are
terribly interested in what they
now regard as ancient history.
Nixon sees his life as a suc
cession of crises: the Hiss-Cham
bers crisis, the Nixon fund, the
stoning in South America, the
kitchen debate with Khrush
chev, the TV disaster with John
Kennedy. But some of them hap
pened 15 or 20 years ago. The
world is different now.
In fact, the same quality of
remoteness which has made
many people forgive Nixon's
past image and trespasses has
also made them forget his past
crises and triumphs. The trauma
of President Kennedy's assassi
nation, of the war, of the big
city riots has erased many me
mories. There is a gulf between
our era and the era of Robert
Taft and Dwight Eisenhower in
which Nixon experienced his
grandeurs and miseries.
A sweeping imagination could
span the gulf, but Nixon — who
has brains and cleverness and
perhaps even some principle —
doesn't have the needed quality
of imagination. It isn't so much
that he is a loser, but that he
doesn't seem to belong to our
time, as Bobby Kennedy does
and, despite their age, Mr. John
son and Rockefeller do.
The "new Nixon" is unques
tionably more attractive than
the earlier one. He is low-keyed,
more relaxed, even capable of
laughing at his own past de
feats. There is still, of course, a
canned and tinny quality about
his speeches as he swings around
the circuit of local morale-build-

ing meetings, as with his inevit
able opening gambit at univer
sity speeches about being "a
dropout from the electoral col
lege."
But he stays clear of the hys
teria he showed in his outbreak
against the press after his de
feat for the California governor
ship. And he has shown, for bet
ter or wors?, a clinging to his
convictions about the Vietna
mese war in the face of pres
sures to adopt the more flexible
approach that George .Romney
has taken and that Rockefeller
will doubtless take.
The infuriating thing for
Nixon must be the sense that he
is fighting against ghosts. Al
though Romney is his opponent
in New Hampshire and Wiscon
sin and the other primaries, he
is not his real opponent.
Nor are Ronald Reagan and
Charles Percy. There is only
one ultimate opponent, and his
name is Nelson Rockefeller, and
what is galling is that he can't
be got at because he is ho'ed up
in his privileged New York sanc
tuary of being a nonrandidate.
Reluctant Candidate
Thus, Nixon's tactic will have
to be to smoke Rockefeller out
of his sanctuary and into the
open battlefield of ideas and pol
icies. The closest parallel is the
1952 struggle between Taft and
Gen. Eisenhower, when Taft was
the established fiance of the Re
publican Party, but Gen. Eisen
hower was the distant romantic
figure who seemingly had to be
wooed.
Let us face it: in politics, as
in love, it is better not to seem
too anxious. Every political
commentator who says that the
public wants to be wooed has
been wrong.
It doesn't want to be wooed.
It wants to be the wooer, and
it feels most triumphant when
it has overcome the seeming
shyness of the reluctant lover
who is being conquered con
quers.

Every four years we hear
that the Republicans are mov
ing away from the Eastern Es
tablishment. This year they
have moved back, since the race
in the final stretch will doubt
less be between Richard Nixon
and Nelson Rockefeller, both of
them today New Yorkers, with
not a single non-New Yorker
around to dispute them.
V Nixon's formal decision to
run, which has been a surprise
free prediction for a year, hasn't
changed a thing. Rockefeller's
decision to contest Oregon in a
write-in campaign makes the
final confrontation between the
two men more certain than ever.
I don't rule out a possible
Nixon victory. He is strong in
the Midwest, the mountain
states, the South. The local and
state Republican leaders are po
litically in his debt for past fa
vors. He is someone they under
stand, while they feel vaguely
uncomfortable with Rockefeller.
If the country were composed
only of Republicans and South
ern Democrats, he would win
handily.
But it isn't, and he won't. The
reason is that even the Repub
licans, despite their long-stand
ing suicide drive, want to win
this year, and Nixon is an un
likely winner against President
Johnson.
Smell of Defeat
The best one can say about
Nixon's chances is that he has
largely managed to overcome
the smell of defeat that has
clung to him. But that isn't
enough, because it is only the
negative of a negative. What
Rockefeller has is something
positive; the knowledge of his
appeal to independents and to
Democrats, therefore the faint

but unmistakable start of the
smell of victory.
Thus, Nixon's cross is Rocke
feller. True, he may say and
even feel that he has borne and
survived worse ones. But I doubt
whether many Americans are
terribly interested in what they
now regard as ancient history.
Nixon sees his life as a suc
cession of crises: the Hiss-Cham
bers crisis, the Nixon fund, the
stoning in South America, the
kitchen debate with Khrush
chev, the TV disaster with John
Kennedy. But some of them hap
pened 15 or 20 years ago. The
world is different now.
In fact, the same quality of
remoteness which has made
many people forgive Nixon's
past image and trespasses has
also made them forget his past
crises and triumphs. The trauma
of President Kennedy's assassi
nation, of the war, of the big
city riots has erased many me
mories. There is a gulf between
our era and the era of Robert
Taft and Dwight Eisenhower in
which Nixon experienced his
grandeurs and miseries.
A sweeping imagination could
span the gulf, but Nixon — who
has brains and cleverness and
perhaps even some principle —
doesn't have the needed quality
of imagination. It isn't so much
that he is a loser, but that he
doesn't seem to belong to our
time, as Bobby Kennedy does
and, despite their age, Mr. John
son and Rockefeller do.
The "new Nixon" is unques
tionably more attractive than
the earlier one. He is low-keyed,
more relaxed, even capable of
laughing at his own past de
feats. There is still, of course, a
canned and tinny quality about
his speeches as he swings around
the circuit of local morale-build-

ing meetings, as with his inevit
able opening gambit at univer
sity speeches about being "a
dropout from the electoral col
lege."
But he stays clear of the hys
teria he showed in his outbreak
against the press after his de
feat for the California governor
ship. And he has shown, for bet
ter or wors?, a clinging to his
convictions about the Vietna
mese war in the face of pres
sures to adopt the more flexible
approach that George .Romney
has taken and that Rockefeller
will doubtless take.
The infuriating thing for
Nixon must be the sense that he
is fighting against ghosts. Al
though Romney is his opponent
in New Hampshire and Wiscon
sin and the other primaries, he
is not his real opponent.
Nor are Ronald Reagan and
Charles Percy. There is only
one ultimate opponent, and his
name is Nelson Rockefeller, and
what is galling is that he can't
be got at because he is ho'ed up
in his privileged New York sanc
tuary of being a nonrandidate.
Reluctant Candidate
Thus, Nixon's tactic will have
to be to smoke Rockefeller out
of his sanctuary and into the
open battlefield of ideas and pol
icies. The closest parallel is the
1952 struggle between Taft and
Gen. Eisenhower, when Taft was
the established fiance of the Re
publican Party, but Gen. Eisen
hower was the distant romantic
figure who seemingly had to be
wooed.
Let us face it: in politics, as
in love, it is better not to seem
too anxious. Every political
commentator who says that the
public wants to be wooed has
been wrong.
It doesn't want to be wooed.
It wants to be the wooer, and
it feels most triumphant when
it has overcome the seeming
shyness of the reluctant lover
who is being conquered con
quers.
