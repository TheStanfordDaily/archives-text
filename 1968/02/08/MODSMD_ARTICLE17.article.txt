## Packer: Residence Report To Recieve Careful Scrutiny 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
After talking to Mr. Sweeney
late last week about the release
of the SES Residence Commit
tee's report, I concluded that it
would be better to go on record
with a written statement than
to rely on the vagaries of the
Daily's reporting. How right I
was!
I did not say that, "the Com
mittee acted on its own volition
in issuing the paper." That
statement is ridiculous on its
face in view of the fact that the
paper was released by me as
Chairman of the Steering Com
mittee of SES.
The full text of my statement,
which Mr. Sweeney did not see
fit to print, was as follows:
"We are releasing the position
paper prepared by the SES
Comittee on Residence Policies
at this time because it is an im
portant contribution to an issue
of great current interest on
campus. The paper has not yet
been reviewed by the Steering
Committee of SES. To the ex
tent that it states lines of policy
development for the long run, it
will receive careful scrutiny and
will contribute to the formation
of eventual SES recommenda
tions on the improvement of the
residence situation. To the ex
tent that it advances proposals
for implementation in the next
academic year, we are confident
that it will receive the careful

consideration of the administra
tive officers of the University
who are charged with responsi
bility in this area."

Cavanaugh Picketers
Requested To Listen
Editor, The Daily:
The Honorable Jerome P.
Cavanaugh, Mayor of Detroit, is
coming today to speak on the
problems of race relations.
In anticipation of this event,
several unidentified individuals
have seen fit to express, through
a printed flyer distributed on
campus, disapproval of the May
or's policies and to urge that
students picket the lecture.
The sheet alleges that Cava
naugh is a racist of the most "in
sidious" sort. This would seem
to contradict a widely held
opinion that Detroit is a "mod
el" city in race relations, and
that Cavanaugh is among the
most progressive mayors in the
United States.
The last line of the flyer reads:
"Join us on the picket line."
While we cannot deny your
right to picket, may we suggest
that you join us inside, and pre
sent Mayor Cavanaugh with
these charges, in order that all
sides may learn the truth.
We do not consider that an

anonymous flyer, which cites no
sources for its information, is
the best method of arriving at
that truth with which we are
all so vitally concerned.

4 Ring Roads 9 Cause
Unnecessary Misery
Editor, The Daily:
Since I beeame a member of
the Stanford Community in 1961,
I have endured, with litt 1 e for
mal protest, the results of the
discretionary decisions of the
Administration.
In a dynamic and exnanding
university, somo dislocations are
inevitable. Ideally, the Admin
istration should attempt to re
duce these dislocations to a
minimum. With respect to traf
fic flow, the Administration has
failed.
The Planning Office, with its
firmly entrenched theology of
the "ring road," has succeeded
in making life unnecessarily
miserable for many members of
the Stanford Community, in
rluding students, faculty, and
staff.
Faced with "sneak-through"
traffic circumventing the posts
which bisect Galvez (causing
both inconvenience and a haz
ardous condition), the Planning
Office had two alternatives: 1)
recognize the existence of an
established traffic pattern and
open up Galvez or 2) stop the
traffic flow at all costs.
Unfortunately, theology pre
vailed over reason, and the lat
ter alternative was chosen: the
posts are to be moved to render
Galvez less useful and make
driving still more inconvenient.
The pernicious "ring road" is
still uncompleted, has numerous
stop signs, and is removed from
the central campus; it could nev
er adequately replace the conven
ient access roads like Galvez.

Toyon Resident Claims
Dorm Is A Non-Entity
Editor, The Daily
The article in the Feb. 5 Dally
on housing trends confirms what
we residents of Toyon have
known for a long time: Toyon
doesn't exist in the mind of the
Stanford community.
The article reported opinions
from other living groups on
campus: fraternities, Stern, Wil
bur, Branner, Roble, Florence
Moore, etc. â€”but none from Toy
on.
Toyon is a non-entity in this
jungle "on the edge of great
ness." A lot of you may say,
"So what?" It doesn't really
make any difference.
I just wanted you to know,
before I disappear into the re
mote recesses of Toyon, that we
inhabitants of Toyon do exist.
