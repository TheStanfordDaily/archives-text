# A 						Valid Love
## Homosexual: Isolated 
### 
(Name withheld on request.)
As a homosexual, I have some
comments to offer on the article
concerning the Homosexual Club
at Stanford University.
Firstly, what is resented by
the homosexual is not that the
spirituality of his love is doubt
ed by the heterosexual, but its
authenticity.
However, I think that the
average reaction to a knowledge
of homosexual love tends to be:
"Oh he'll get over that when
he meets the right woman."
Indeed, with a young man this
may be the case. But when a
man reaches his middle thirties
and has never emotionally
stirred by a woman, but has
experienced these feelings only
towards members of his own
sex, then it would appear more
realistic to recognize that this
is his mode of sexual self-ex
pression.
Valid Love
Secondly, heterosexuals doubt
the validity of homosexual love
because they think that it can
not in any way resemble the
feelings that they have for a
partner of the opposite sex.
This brings me to a third
point. I myself do not believe
that there is any such thing as
"homosexuality."
Personally, ever since the age
of seven, I have felt very strong
ly that I was a female who had,
by some horrible cosmic mis
take, been put into a male body,
and thus forced into certain con
ventions of dress and behavior
which I find alien.
What I do wish to emphasize
is that, being as I am, "homo
sexuality" would involve feel
ing emotional towards a female.
And to me it is more "natural"
to regard women simply as oth
er human beings, but to react

strongly towards certain types
of masculinity.
No reasonable person expects
to be an object of desire to
every member of the opposite
sex whom they meet. It is fair
also to assume that a homosex
ual man will also be selective,
and will be attracted to only a
small proportion of the men he
meets.
Of that small proportion there
will again be only a few from
whom he may hope to gain a
response, and far from leading
a life of uninhibited license, the
homosexual tends to be more
sexually restricted than his "nor
mal" friends.
I am speaking in this context
of the isolated homosexual who
is attempting to live his life in
the company of those who are
unaware of his true nature.
Social Aspect
What makes being a homo
sexual such a liability is entire
ly the social aspect.
A large and important part of
one's character has to be hid
den from all but a very few
tolerant and understanding
friends. My own attitude about
this secrecy is not that I am
ashamed, but I know that so
many feel so strongly about it
that it is better to protect them
from the shocked disgust that
knowledge might bring.
Finally, why do so many of
us not want to be cured. Because
we live so happily in society?
No, it is because our sexual
nature is part of our character
— our intrinsic selves. If I were
a man happily married to a nice
woman I wouldn't be me.
Nor would I be the person
my friends appear to quite like.
I might be happier, more con
tented, less frustrated, less sad
dened by the pain of unassaug
ed love — but I would be unrec
ognizable to myself.

to be an object of desire to
every member of the opposite
sex whom they meet. It is fair
also to assume that a homosex
ual man will also be selective,
and will be attracted to only a
small proportion of the men he
meets.
Of that small proportion there
will again be only a few from
whom he may hope to gain a
response, and far from leading
a life of uninhibited license, the
homosexual tends to be more
sexually restricted than his "nor
mal" friends.
I am speaking in this context
of the isolated homosexual who
is attempting to live his life in
the company of those who are
unaware of his true nature.
Social Aspect
What makes being a homo
sexual such a liability is entire
ly the social aspect.
A large and important part of
one's character has to be hid
den from all but a very few
tolerant and understanding
friends. My own attitude about
this secrecy is not that I am
ashamed, but I know that so
many feel so strongly about it
that it is better to protect them
from the shocked disgust that
knowledge might bring.
Finally, why do so many of
us not want to be cured. Because
we live so happily in society?
No, it is because our sexual
nature is part of our character
— our intrinsic selves. If I were
a man happily married to a nice
woman I wouldn't be me.
Nor would I be the person
my friends appear to quite like.
I might be happier, more con
tented, less frustrated, less sad
dened by the pain of unassaug
ed love — but I would be unrec
ognizable to myself.

As a homosexual, I have some
comments to offer on the article
concerning the Homosexual Club
at Stanford University.
Firstly, what is resented by
the homosexual is not that the
spirituality of his love is doubt
ed by the heterosexual, but its
authenticity.
However, I think that the
average reaction to a knowledge
of homosexual love tends to be:
"Oh he'll get over that when
he meets the right woman."
Indeed, with a young man this
may be the case. But when a
man reaches his middle thirties
and has never emotionally
stirred by a woman, but has
experienced these feelings only
towards members of his own
sex, then it would appear more
realistic to recognize that this
is his mode of sexual self-ex
pression.
Valid Love
Secondly, heterosexuals doubt
the validity of homosexual love
because they think that it can
not in any way resemble the
feelings that they have for a
partner of the opposite sex.
This brings me to a third
point. I myself do not believe
that there is any such thing as
"homosexuality."
Personally, ever since the age
of seven, I have felt very strong
ly that I was a female who had,
by some horrible cosmic mis
take, been put into a male body,
and thus forced into certain con
ventions of dress and behavior
which I find alien.
What I do wish to emphasize
is that, being as I am, "homo
sexuality" would involve feel
ing emotional towards a female.
And to me it is more "natural"
to regard women simply as oth
er human beings, but to react

strongly towards certain types
of masculinity.
No reasonable person expects
to be an object of desire to
every member of the opposite
sex whom they meet. It is fair
also to assume that a homosex
ual man will also be selective,
and will be attracted to only a
small proportion of the men he
