# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## LBJ Reveals Pueblo's Task 
### Drew Pearson 
President Johnson called a
group of Congressmen to the
White House recently for a sec
ret briefing on the seizure of the
USS Pueblo off the North Korean
coast. Invited were Democratic
members of the House and Sen
ate Foreign Relations Commit
tee and the House and Senate
Armed Services Committees.
The President presented Sec
retary of State Dean Rusk, Sec
retary of Defense Robert Mc-
Namara, the latter's successor,
Clark Clifford, Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Earle
Wheeler, and Gen. Maxwell Tay
lor. Strangely, no Navy man
spoke at the briefing though the
seizure of the Pueblo obvious
ly involved naval problems.
The President revealed that
the loss of the Pueblo had dealt
U.S. security a "severely dam
aging blow," since the ship had
the most sophisticated and mod
ern intelligence mechanism on
board. The equipment was 15
years ahead of anything Soviet
Russia possesses.
"Now that the Russians have
the model," the President re
marked grimly, "they may be
able to catch up with us within
a year."
"I've got all my top people
here," he told the Senators and
Congressmen. "We want your
questions, but it will be more
orderly if you ask the questions
after you've heard the briefings.
If anyone feels compelled to in
terrupt with a question which
makes a contribution, okay."
No Explanation
The briefings went smoothly
until Gen. Wheeler got up to ex
plain why Air Force planes in
Japan did not go to the Pueb
lo's rescue.
Suddenly Sen. Tom Dodd of
Connecticut began to pepper
Wheeler with antagonistic ques
tions.
"Why didn't you have some
protection for the ship?" Dodd
asked.
Wheeler explained that the
presence of a destroyer would
have revealed to the North Ko
reans what the vessel was and
ruined its mission.
Dodd continued peppering the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff about air cover, failure to
send rescue planes, and so on.
He was quite belligerent.
The President, who was sit

ting on the other side of the
room, craned his neck to see who
was talking. He couldn't see and
asked someone who it was. By
this time it was obvious that
Dodd had lifted a couple of
drinks before the briefing. The
President moved in firmly.
"That's enough," he said. "We
have to proceed."
"I thought you said we could
ask questions if they were im
portant," remonstrated Dodd.
"I said if they made a con
tribution, and yours are not
making a contribution. We'll
stay here as long as you want
to ask the questions â€” but
later," the President said.
Lack of Time
Gen. Wheeler then went on to
explain that it was impossible
to have planes constantly hover
ing over the Pueblo since that
would ruin its mission; also
that the Air Force commander
in Japan decided there wasn't
much he could do because his
planes could not stay in the air
very long and there were 75
MIGs stationed at Wonsan which
could get there quicker.
The Pueblo was also surround
ed by small ships that would i
sink it, Wheeler said, or if the

commander sank his own ship,
it would have taken two or three
hours for the vessel to settle in
the water and the enemy could
fiave boarded it during that
period.
The Congressmen and Sena
tors were informed that the
Pueblo was on a highly delicate
mission to ascertain whether
North Korea planned to launch
a second front.
Premier Kim had been talk
ing publicly about a diversion
ary effort to weaken American
strength in South Vietnam and
it was suspected Kim might be
planning an attack across the
38th parallel. The Pueblo was
hovering off the coast to pick
up any messages regarding such
an attack.
Twenty-seven men in the Pueb
lo's crew, incidentally, were the
most highly trained and skilled
experts in the cryptographic and
intelligence fields.
The briefing went smoothly
after Dood subsided. President
Johnson said that the United
States had a number of alter
natives to secure the return of
the crew and ship if diplomacy

did not work. One would be to
destroy the ship, though he
quickly added that this would
preclude the chance of getting
it back.
He also talked of strengthen
ing the entire American opera
tion in South Korea to prepare
for any showdown.
Several of the Congressmen
present expressed sympathy for
the President. They felt that he
was surrounded by what they
called "mediocrities."
During the briefing, pictures
were shown of Russian vessels
also equipped with electronic
listening devices stationed off
San Francisco, Guam, Catalina
Island and the East Coast.
Rep. Mendel Rivers, the silver
haired solon from South Caro
lina, was discussing a certain
newspaperman in the House
Democratic cloakroom recently.
"I never had any trouble with
Drew Pearson till I became
chairman of the Armed Services
Committee," said Rivers. "Even
then I didn't have any real
trouble with him until I ran
afoul of McNamara.
