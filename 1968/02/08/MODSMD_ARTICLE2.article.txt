# Free University Stresses Course Flexibility
## 
### (VICKI GRAHAM (First of two parts) 
The Mid Peninsula Free Uni
versity (M.F.U.) is a stump of
political activism with shoots of
Zen, bioenergetics, Gestalt work
shops, Japanese pottery-making,
Jungian astrology, advanced
group loving, and Mahler's sym
phonies.
The Free U. which began its
second year last Fall, was at one
time characterized by a radical
political minority. The seminar
pervaded by a quest for self
oriented organization is now
discovery, spiritual development
and a sense of community in
thing."
Tiring of the routine and ir
relevance of a $900-a-quarter
conventional education, a stu
dent can pay a $10 fee to the
Free U and enroll in any of its
130 courses and projects.
Offerings include meditation,
massage, candle-making, the Pla
tonic dialogues, draft resistance
workshop, camera and film
workshops, the art of giving
away bread, social theories of
constructive rebellion, and the

philosophy of the American In
dian.
A member of the Free U.
can live in a Harrad Experi
ment (as in the book by Rob
ert Rimmer), analyze racism
and neo-colonialism, taste the
wines of Burgundy and the
Rhone, help schizophrenic
children, or participate in spon
taneous dance.
And close to 1000 adults and
youths — most of Ihem from
Stanford — have done just that.
Enrollment last quarter was 600,
up more than 250 from previous
quarters. Over half the enroll
ment comes from the university
community.
The Free U. has an open cur
riculum: anyone can teach a
course on anything he wishes
and in any way he wishes to
teach it.
Only a half dozen regular pro
fessors teach courses: most are
led by grad students, TA's, and

interested members of the com
munity.
The MJF.U. is probably the
most successful Free Univer
sity in the nation, according
to Robb Crist, Executive Di
rector and Curriculum Co
ordinator. It has more mem
bers and more money than
other free universities.
"Most Free U.'s are politically
motivated and born of a resent
ful activist mentality. They fold
as fast as they rise," he said.
"M.F.U. is in the mainstream
of what people are vitally inter
ested in: sex, dope, ways to
change their lives and heighten
their awareness of others," he
added.
About two-thirds of the cour
ses in any one quarter are suc
cessful and are offered again.
Attendance is not mandatory,
so the success of a course de
pends upon the ability of its
leader to present interesting ma

terial, and to get them to relate
to and interact with each other.
The "other university," ac
cording to many In the Free
U. Is Incapable of meeting the
needs of a changing society,
because It is dedicated to the
preservation of the status quo.
The Free U. affirms that real
education aims at generality
rather than specialization and
"should supply the glue which
cements together our fragment
ed lives."
Established institutions are
slow to change, and"it is prob
ably impossible to change the
system of conventional educa
tion," said Vic Lovell, M.F.U. co
ordinator.
"You have to smuggle things
in, connive, persuade or con peo
ple into doing the new things
that ought to be done, like pass
fail, and new living arrange

ments. The results are small and
the reward is frustration. The
smart ones realize that the cards
are stacked against them from
the beginning, and they don't
even try any more," he said.
The Free U. sees itself as an
alternative, or at least a viable
supplement to conventional ed
ucation.
In terms of content, the Free
U. sees many shortcomings in
the "other university." Accord
ing to Vic Lovell, the philosophy
department, for example, makes
no serious effort to teach exis
tential, Eastern, or classical
thought before Plato.
He sees the English depart
ment grinding along as though
contemporary American litera
ture did not exist. "They are
still back in the 20's and 30's. No
one teaches or even regards
Ginsberg, Sneider, Burrows,
Miller, and others," said Lovell.
"The content of the Univer
sity is intellectual and verbal,"
he emphasizes. "No one teaches
you about sex. No one teaches
you to feel. There is no course
at Stanford to teach you to reach
out and touch another individual
with tenderness and respect."
Robb Crist sees no incompati
bility with the existing univer
sity and envisions the Free U.
as a community, a small col
lege which covers the ground
that the University does not.
He compared the Free U.
to a John Stuart Mill type of
organization, a market place of
people and ideas, where it does
not take long for people to
find what they want; what
they want lasts, and what they
don't want falls away.
Over 100 people have signed
up for a course "Sexual Moral
ity Now," taught by Robb Crist
and Vic Lovell. Over 100 have
signed up for human contact
courses.
Relatively few people have
signed up for political courses.
For example, "Politics and Eco
nomic Systems" has 10 students,
as does the "Role of the Ameri
can University in Revolution."
The Free University constant
ly emphasizes the importance
of self-awareness and a willing
ness to be totally honest and
to communicate with other hu
man beings. Community goals
include mutual trust and shar
ing of both material things and
spiritual experiences.
Certain courses, such as hu
man contact, attempt to help
participants rid themselves of
reservations about touching

others, the need to put up bar
riers and facades, and the need
to play games.
There are those who enroll
in human contact courses
merely for curiosity's sake and
come expecting to see a side
show. However, Lovell main
tains most are sincerely In
terested in exposing other lay
ers of their consciousness.
"Those who are willing to give
of themselves may have one
of the most meaningful ex
periences of their lives," he
added.
We are stuck in a mire of ar
tificiality, according to Robb
Crist. "We live in an arena of
cocktail parties, bridge parties,
and dirty playboy sexuality. We
don't know yet what is the re
sult of long-term group hon
esty," he said.
"There will probably be a
great release of emotion and alle

viation of much frustration. Peo
ple will be able to operate with
more consistency between their
inner and outer selves. There
will be a frequent exchange be
tween one's vital centers and
one's exterior. There may be
a surge of creativity, a period
of California sensuality, of
which we are now experiencing
only a part.
"There are moments of hu
man potency when you have «i
surplus of energy, confidence,
and compassion which enables
you to deal more effectively
with people, to overlook annoy
ing trivia, to handle unpleasant
situations," said Crist.
However, he recommended
that those who are hesistant
about taking a beginning human
contact course, join the Esalen
at Stanford program where all
the courses are handled by pro
fessionals.
