# Free University Stresses Course Flexibility
## 
### (VICKI GRAHAM (First of two parts) 
The Mid Peninsula Free Uni
versity (M.F.U.) is a stump of
political activism with shoots of
Zen, bioenergetics, Gestalt work
shops, Japanese pottery-making,
Jungian astrology, advanced
group loving, and Mahler's sym
phonies.
The Free U. which began its
second year last Fall, was at one
time characterized by a radical
political minority. The seminar
pervaded by a quest for self
oriented organization is now
discovery, spiritual development
and a sense of community in
thing."
Tiring of the routine and ir
relevance of a $900-a-quarter
conventional education, a stu
dent can pay a $10 fee to the
Free U and enroll in any of its
130 courses and projects.
Offerings include meditation,
massage, candle-making, the Pla
tonic dialogues, draft resistance
workshop, camera and film
workshops, the art of giving
away bread, social theories of
constructive rebellion, and the

philosophy of the American In
dian.
A member of the Free U.
can live in a Harrad Experi
ment (as in the book by Rob
ert Rimmer), analyze racism
and neo-colonialism, taste the
wines of Burgundy and the
Rhone, help schizophrenic
children, or participate in spon
taneous dance.
And close to 1000 adults and
youths — most of Ihem from
Stanford — have done just that.
Enrollment last quarter was 600,
up more than 250 from previous
quarters. Over half the enroll
ment comes from the university
community.
The Free U. has an open cur
riculum: anyone can teach a
course on anything he wishes
and in any way he wishes to
teach it.
Only a half dozen regular pro
fessors teach courses: most are
led by grad students, TA's, and

interested members of the com
munity.
The MJF.U. is probably the
most successful Free Univer
sity in the nation, according
to Robb Crist, Executive Di
rector and Curriculum Co
ordinator. It has more mem
bers and more money than
other free universities.
"Most Free U.'s are politically
motivated and born of a resent
ful activist mentality. They fold
as fast as they rise," he said.
"M.F.U. is in the mainstream
of what people are vitally inter
ested in: sex, dope, ways to
change their lives and heighten
their awareness of others," he
added.
About two-thirds of the cour
ses in any one quarter are suc
cessful and are offered again.
Attendance is not mandatory,
so the success of a course de
pends upon the ability of its
leader to present interesting ma

terial, and to get them to relate
to and interact with each other.
The "other university," ac
cording to many In the Free
U. Is Incapable of meeting the
needs of a changing society,
because It is dedicated to the
preservation of the status quo.
The Free U. affirms that real
education aims at generality
rather than specialization and
"should supply the glue which
cements together our fragment
ed lives."
Established institutions are
slow to change, and"it is prob
ably impossible to change the
system of conventional educa
tion," said Vic Lovell, M.F.U. co
ordinator.
"You have to smuggle things
in, connive, persuade or con peo
ple into doing the new things
that ought to be done, like pass
fail, and new living arrange
