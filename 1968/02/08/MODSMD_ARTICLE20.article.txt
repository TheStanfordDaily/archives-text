## Draft Opposition: Doomed To Fail 
### JOHN ALCORN 
It is rare when cancer can
be cured, but when a cure is
possible, every cancerous cell
must be removed if the patient
is to live. It is precisely lor
this reason that Benjamin Spock
and William Sloan Coffin and
everyone else participating in
the anti-draft movement can
ultimately achieve nothing but
failure.
If these men are ever to suc
ceed, they must not attack the
draft itself, for such an effort
is like trying to cure cancer
with an aspirin.
What they must cut out from
America's diseased body is the
principle which allows slavery
to exist in the United States in
1968: the principle which says
a man has an "obligation" to
society — the principle which
says that a man's life is not his
own.
In either totalitarian states
controlled by despots or in
"democracies" controlled by
sheep, the principle that any one
can be sacrificed for the com

mon good is never questioned
—or allowed to be questioned.
How can a nation whose most
sacred documents claim that
every individual has certain in
alienable rights justify taking
one man's life when he has com
mitted no crime greater than
trying to stay alive?
If Dr. Spock and Mr. Coffin
hope to succeed, they must
change from an anti-draft move
ment to a pro-human rights
movement.
When a government can ex
ceed its only right to exist —
the right to protect an indivi
dual from physical injury — it
is only a matter of time from
the first order regulating busi
ness to the order forcing a man
to give his life in the name of
human rights to the day when
ultimately every individual right
can be suspended arbitrarily in
the name of the common good.
If the draft is ever repealed,
but the principle behind it al
lowed to remain, America will
be curing a headache and dying
of cancer.
