# What Ever Happenened To Wilbur?
## STANFORD DAILY FOCUS ON RESIDENCES 
### HERBERT TERRY 
Upperclassmen who once lived
there may find it hard to be
lieve, but this year Wilbur Hall
has been strangely forgotten by
the rest of the University.
In this time of housing ex
perimentation, the Demonstra
tion Houses, Branner and acci
dents like Durand have captur
ed the attention of the campus
and few seem to remember that
for slightly over half of all
freshmen men, Wilbur, sans its
two Demonstrations Houses, at
least makes a stab at being
home.
What, then, is life like in Wil
bur this year? Almost nobody
holds it to be radically different
from prior years. According to
Wilbur Hall Director Joseph Hig
gins "it is not different here this
year from any of the four pre
vious years I've been associated

with Wilbur . . . even though
this is not to say that it
shouldn't be changed."
Skimming Effects Changes
Yet, there seem to be some
slight, but important, changes in
Wilbur life this year. Many of
these changes seem tied to the
establishment of the Demonstra
tion Houses, not only those
placed in Wilbur but those in
Stern as well.
Senior Dell Martin, now the
only remaining 2-year sponsor
in Wilbur, believes the Demon
stration Houses and Branner are
responsible for a "skimming ef
fect" which has changed Wilbur
life.
"Certain kinds of people ap
plied for the Demonstration
Houses, and certain kinds for
Branner," said Martin. "What
we seem to be faced with now
is an extreme amount of medio
cracy, and little exceptional per
formance," he continued.
"House GPA's stood about the
same this year, or in some cases
higher, than last year, but in
the houses there were few peo
ple with exceptionally high
GPA's. In some houses about
70 per cent of the freshmen had
3.1 or 3.2 GPA's, nothing fan
tastic if the Stanford Curve is
considered. Very few achieved
outstanding grades, and they
were for the most part disin
terested in doing anything ex
citing," concluded Martin.
The sources of this Wilbur
disinterest are difficult to pin
point. A concensus of opinion
seems to be that this disinterest
is related to Wilbur's all fresh
man male composition. Perhaps
the house with a concentration
of Wilbur's perennial problems
is Arroyo House, where damage
bills spiraled last quarter and
where Faculty Resident Ron
Hamoway, and two of Arroyo's
three original sponsors, resign
ed.
Atmosphere of Apathy
According to Ted Crooks, first
quarter Arroyo president, part
of that house's problems are
connected to "a sense of rejec
tion, by the University and by
the people with whom they're
living . . . there's an atmosphere
of apathy regarding everything
which happened in the house."
"Wilbur is a bad place to
live," he continued, "because the
all-male situation accentuates
ego problems and the non-suc
ceedors tend to overcompensate

by becoming radical in another
field â€” there is a reaction to
the feeling of being judged
closely by one's peers that might
not exist in an integrated or
coed situation."
New Arroyo Faculty Resident
David Gries admits that, by
chance, Arroyo has a "heavy
dosage of athletes," and accord
ing to Crooks "we certainly
have more former athletes who
are non-scholarship than any
other house I know of. This, of
course, has some bearing upon
what has gone on in the house."
Higgins, however, does not
think that either all-male com
position of the house or its high
percentage of athletes adequate
ly explains the problems that
have developed. According to
Higgins, "Freshmen this year
came to Stanford at about the
same level of social conscious

ness as this year's sophomore
class . . . and neither the ad
ministration, the faculty resi
dents, nor the sponsors and tu
tors were quite ready for this
increased energy and have not,
as yet, been particularly suc
cessful at channeling it."
Ruotolo Sees Improvement
In spite of the persistance of
apathy, food-fights and roudy
ism, some see Wilbur to be
significantly improved over its
state several years ago. Asso
ciate Professor of English Dr.
Lucio Ruotolo returned this
year as faculty resident at Rin
conada House, after a five year
absence from Wilbur. "The dorm
situation does have a good ef
fect on the students that can
be perceived," said Ruotolo.
"I see a real improvement
since I was here last, these stu
dents are more concerned about
matters that apply to a univer
sity community, they have ma
tured more and there's every
reason to believe that dorm ex
periences have had at least
something to do with this," he
said.
Ruotolo, however, is not will
ing to credit Wilbur life with
all the improvement. "For one
thing, given the crises of our
times and its central despair,
those who choose the life of the
mind, as here at Stanford, have
got to become more occupied
with tasks in the areas of the
arts, literature, music, political
discussions, etc.," he concluded.
Ruotolo claims that class-inte
grated living would accelerate
this maturing process, and said
that "the current situation as
treating the Freshman as a child
only, in a sense, creates that
child."
Good Through Proximity
During last year's discussions
of the Demonstration Houses,
University officials expressed a
hope that the presence of the
experimental houses in the Wil
bur complex would improve life
in the whole facility. Accord
ing to Higgins this has, to some
extent, been the case. "Both
Trancos and Rinconada have
benefitted greatly by being jux
taposed to the demonstration
houses . . . the manner in which
this is evident is not easy to pin
down, it is perhaps a natural
ness, a human relatedness, not
to be found in the other houses,"
he said.
Tom Goodwin, a Rinconada

sponsor, maintains that "Soto
has not affected Rinconada as
much as has Otero, but this is
primarily a result of the design
of the buildings. However, they
both affect Rinconada in the
sense of having served as ex
amples of types of activity which
can be done very easily."
According to Ruotolo, stu
dents in Rinconada "look about
them and see functioning ex
amples of exciting things to do,
and copy some of them. Food
fights, too, have become prac
tically extinct this year, a big
change from five years ago."
Goodwin says that Rinconada
does not have the "leaders" in
the terms used by Martin. In
stead he says "we have key per
sonalities, not really leaders, just
people doing things which are
satisfying to themselves. Rin
conada doesn't do much as Rin
conada, but within the house
there are people, independently,
doing good things, and this is
surely related to the proximity
of our house to Otero."
John Trimbur, however,
claims that the influence of the
Demonstration Houses is not as
significant as had been hoped.
Trimbur, a sponsor in Junipero
last year, said that "in a lot
of ways the demonstration
houses are isolated in the com
plex, and I think that that fact
is a good point for putting other
options in the Wilbur buildings.
It doesn't seem to me that the
interaction is nearly as good as
it should be." Trimbur eats lunch
every day in the Junipero din
ing room, on the East side of
the Wilbur complex, the side op
posite that of the Demonstra
tion Houses.
Mass Exodus of Sponsors
Wilbur, this year, has experi
enced a mass exodus of experi
enced sponsors. At the end of
the last academic year five spon
sors reapplied for another year,
and all were accepted. Over the
summer three of the five de
cided not to return to Wilbur,
one resigned last quarter and

"I figure Tm just biding my time here now, and next year Til get
into the real campus."

Martin remains the only two
year sponsor.
So far this year four spon
sors have left their positions,
citing reasons varying from their
disinterest in Stanford in gen
eral to the financial and scho
lastic burdens of a sponsor's
position. Jim Melmke, a Rincon
ada sponsor, resigned last week
saying that the academic de
mands were simply too great.
Trimbur places the blame for
the exodus on personal priori
ties of the individuals involved.
"After one year I decided it was
all I wanted," he said. "This year
I wanted to do something dif
ferent, to have a little time to
myself. In addition I had a very
good group last year and was
afraid of drawing comparisons
between a new group and then
being disappointed."
He also said, however, that
the world situation is in part
responsible for the departure of
experienced sponsors. "In Wil
bur everybody's generally up
tight about their concern about
the war, and other things, and
there just isn't time to make the
decisions demanded of a spon
sor ... all of a sudden, as a se
nior, you're confronted with a
lot of brutal facts that you have
to think out alone."
A constant Wilbur problem

seems to be its inability to es
tablish contact with the rest of
the University. According to
Crooks "we don't have very
good outside ties. Arroyo and
Roth had an exchange program
which collapsed quickly and
most activities here involve only
the people in the house . . .
there are not enough outside
connections and, given our cur
rent group of people and the
living situation, I don't see any
easy way of building them up."
New Houses and
Financial Prpblems
Some freshmen have charged
that Demonstration Houses are
able to run special projects be
cause they have easier access to
greater amounts of money. Ac
cording to Higgins such special
funds do exist, but he maintains
that there is plenty of money
available for all activities the
other houses want to undertake.
Dr. Ruotolo, however, said
that there are other more signi
ficant financial considerations
involved in the Wilbur-Demon
stration House relationships.
"With the experimental houses
you have a faculty, there, paid
more for putting in much more
time. Faculty residents are paid
for teaching the course in the
house, this ammounts to about
$1500.
"Here (in the other Wilbur
houses) we have tremendous
time demands made on an un
derstaffed and underpaid facul
ty, and the residents in the other
Wilbur houses can look at a
demonstration house and ask,
legitimately I think, why they
can't have all the same things,"
Ruotolo concluded.
Do Freshmen Want
To Live There?
The recent housing question
naire indicated that 358 Fresh
men men would like to live in
all-male houses like the existing
Wilbur Hall complox. Crooks is
unsure of the results of the sur
vey. "I don't think it was pre
cise," he said.
"There tends to be a tendency

that once people become adjust
ed to a new living situation they
become loyal, say they like it,
and perhaps convince them
selves that that is the case. When
the transition is as difficult as
from high school to college
there's not a great deal of de
sire to possibly go through such
a transition again, and thus you
get exaggerated but ill-consid
ered house loyalty," he said.
Wilbur, then, is still a place
where, according to Martin, "one
is all couped up in cell like rooms
without any reference point out
side oneself."
And at least one freshman
agrees completely with him. Said
Rinconada freshman Steve Law
ton, "I figure I'm just biding my
time here now, and next year
I'll get into the real campus."
