# Prof Predicts Computer Instruction
## 
### JACK KAPLAN 
Philosophy Professor Patrick
Suppes predicted Tuesday night
that computers will be used in
many phases of education if
they prove to be economically
feasible.
The "foremost" benefit of
computer-assisted instruction is
making the ancient ideal of in
dividualized instruction a reali
ty, he told a capacity crowd of
more than 400 attending a Cen
tury 21 lecture on "Computers
in Education," sponsored by
Tresidder Memorial Union.
"We are trying to imitate the
tutor-student interaction," he
said. "Since it is economically
and socially impractical to pro
vide enough human tutors, we

are turning to computers as a
possible substitute."
Suppes emphasized that one
of the basic problems involved
in individualized education is
that science has a limited knowl
edge of the qualities of a good
human tutor.
Suppes is director of the In
stitute for Mathematical Studies
in Social Science, an organiza
tion which runs experimental
computer instruction programs
in elementary schools in East
Palo Alto, Mississippi, and Ap
palachia, and a first-year Rus
sian course at Stanford.
Drill and Practice
Computers are very valuable,
said Suppes, in performing rou
tine functions of drill and prac

tice after the teacher has intro
duced the concepts and skills in
volved. The elementary school
programs run by the Institute
for Mathematical Studies In So
cial Science are of this kind.
The computer can individualize
instruction by responding im
mediately to each student's an
swer, by organizing the mate
rial according to the ability of
the student, and by forming
special review drills aimed at
the student's weakness.
For drill and practice, a tele
type terminal — a typewriter
linked to a central computer —
is satisfactory, and presents few
technical difficulties. If, how
ever, the computer is to be a
tutor, initially introducing and

explaining the subject as well
as conducting drills, a much
more complex system is needed,
according to Suppes.
Computer "Dialogue"
"Most people cannot learn ele
mentary skills through vision
alone," he explained. "A tutor
computer must use spoken lan
guage. Moreover, most children
are not satisfied with being
talked at — they want to talk
back as well. For this reason,
we are attempting to develop
computers which can carry on
a dialogue."
Computers can also provide
detailed information about the
progress of the students and the
success of the curriculum, and
collect data for revealing how
students learn and why they en
counter difficulties.
"It's very likely if we want to
optimize learning (of subject
matter), we'll do so by putting
some constraints on student
choice," Suppes hypothesized.
But this may conflict with an
other educational objective: de
veloping individual ability to
make decisions, live with the
consequences, and set life-long
learning goals.
"What should we do if a first
grader continually wants to do
story-book problems rather than
arithmetic?" Suppes asked. "Or
if he wants to sign off after two
minutes? Or if a somewhat old
er student wishes to concentrate
in certain subjects? Should our
first priority be encouraging
choice-making or aiding the
learning process? There are no

clear answers to these and oth
er questions."
Computers will also reduce or
eliminate the need for central
ized education, enabling us to
revert to home education.
"Should we continue to send our
children to school for baby-sit
ting and socializing?" demanded
Suppes.
Technological Problems
Part of the excitement in the
field of computers in education,
arises from the many existing
technological obstacles. Suppes
cited two of the problems In
developing a computer which
can carry on a dialogue.
• A device is needed to trans
form the student's oral response
into writing so that it can be
fed into the computer.
• The computer must be able
to respond orally to the student
with high intelligibility and with
a large quantity of possible re
sponses, and to do so with no
more than a IV2 second lapse
between the student's sentence
and the computer's response.
Experiments with first-y ear
Russian language classes at
Stanford have shown that stu
dents who learn from a compu
terized system of tape record
ings outperform those taught in
small, 15-man sections. The com
puter group also has a lower
drop-out rate.
"Even the most dedicated,
Puritanical student is turned off
about half the time in a small
class," Suppes said. "With a com
puter, every question is ad
dressed to you."

a large quantity of possible re
sponses, and to do so with no
more than a IV2 second lapse
between the student's sentence
and the computer's response.
Experiments with first-y ear
Russian language classes at
Stanford have shown that stu
dents who learn from a compu
terized system of tape record
ings outperform those taught in
small, 15-man sections. The com
puter group also has a lower
drop-out rate.
"Even the most dedicated,
Puritanical student is turned off
about half the time in a small
class," Suppes said. "With a com
puter, every question is ad
dressed to you."
Philosophy Professor Patrick
Suppes predicted Tuesday night
that computers will be used in
many phases of education if
they prove to be economically
feasible.
The "foremost" benefit of
computer-assisted instruction is
making the ancient ideal of in
dividualized instruction a reali
ty, he told a capacity crowd of
more than 400 attending a Cen
tury 21 lecture on "Computers
in Education," sponsored by
Tresidder Memorial Union.
"We are trying to imitate the
tutor-student interaction," he
said. "Since it is economically
and socially impractical to pro
vide enough human tutors, we

are turning to computers as a
possible substitute."
Suppes emphasized that one
of the basic problems involved
in individualized education is
that science has a limited knowl
edge of the qualities of a good
human tutor.
Suppes is director of the In
stitute for Mathematical Studies
in Social Science, an organiza
tion which runs experimental
computer instruction programs
in elementary schools in East
Palo Alto, Mississippi, and Ap
palachia, and a first-year Rus
sian course at Stanford.
Drill and Practice
Computers are very valuable,
said Suppes, in performing rou
tine functions of drill and prac

tice after the teacher has intro
duced the concepts and skills in
volved. The elementary school
programs run by the Institute
for Mathematical Studies In So
cial Science are of this kind.
The computer can individualize
instruction by responding im
mediately to each student's an
swer, by organizing the mate
rial according to the ability of
the student, and by forming
special review drills aimed at
the student's weakness.
For drill and practice, a tele
type terminal — a typewriter
linked to a central computer —
is satisfactory, and presents few
technical difficulties. If, how
ever, the computer is to be a
tutor, initially introducing and

explaining the subject as well
as conducting drills, a much
more complex system is needed,
according to Suppes.
Computer "Dialogue"
"Most people cannot learn ele
mentary skills through vision
alone," he explained. "A tutor
computer must use spoken lan
guage. Moreover, most children
are not satisfied with being
talked at — they want to talk
back as well. For this reason,
we are attempting to develop
computers which can carry on
a dialogue."
Computers can also provide
detailed information about the
progress of the students and the
success of the curriculum, and
collect data for revealing how
students learn and why they en
counter difficulties.
"It's very likely if we want to
optimize learning (of subject
matter), we'll do so by putting
some constraints on student
choice," Suppes hypothesized.
But this may conflict with an
other educational objective: de
veloping individual ability to
make decisions, live with the
consequences, and set life-long
learning goals.
"What should we do if a first
grader continually wants to do
story-book problems rather than
arithmetic?" Suppes asked. "Or
if he wants to sign off after two
minutes? Or if a somewhat old
er student wishes to concentrate
in certain subjects? Should our
first priority be encouraging
choice-making or aiding the
learning process? There are no

clear answers to these and oth
er questions."
Computers will also reduce or
eliminate the need for central
ized education, enabling us to
revert to home education.
"Should we continue to send our
children to school for baby-sit
ting and socializing?" demanded
Suppes.
Technological Problems
Part of the excitement in the
field of computers in education,
arises from the many existing
technological obstacles. Suppes
cited two of the problems In
developing a computer which
can carry on a dialogue.
• A device is needed to trans
form the student's oral response
into writing so that it can be
fed into the computer.
• The computer must be able
to respond orally to the student
with high intelligibility and with
a large quantity of possible re
sponses, and to do so with no
more than a IV2 second lapse

eliminate the need for central
ized education, enabling us to
revert to home education.

children to school for baby-sit

Suppes.
Technological Problems
Part of the excitement in the
field of computers in education,
arises from the many existing
technological obstacles. Suppes
cited two of the problems In
developing a computer which
can carry on a dialogue.
• A device is needed to trans
form the student's oral response
into writing so that it can be
fed into the computer.
• The computer must be able
to respond orally to the student
with high intelligibility and with
a large quantity of possible re
sponses, and to do so with no
more than a IV2 second lapse
between the student's sentence
and the computer's response.
Experiments with first-y ear
Russian language classes at
Stanford have shown that stu
dents who learn from a compu
terized system of tape record
ings outperform those taught in
small, 15-man sections. The com
puter group also has a lower
drop-out rate.
"Even the most dedicated,
Puritanical student is turned off
about half the time in a small
class," Suppes said. "With a com
puter, every question is ad
dressed to you."
Philosophy Professor Patrick
Suppes predicted Tuesday night
that computers will be used in
many phases of education if
they prove to be economically
feasible.
The "foremost" benefit of
computer-assisted instruction is
making the ancient ideal of in
dividualized instruction a reali
ty, he told a capacity crowd of
more than 400 attending a Cen
tury 21 lecture on "Computers
in Education," sponsored by
Tresidder Memorial Union.
"We are trying to imitate the
tutor-student interaction," he
said. "Since it is economically
and socially impractical to pro
vide enough human tutors, we

are turning to computers as a
possible substitute."
Suppes emphasized that one
of the basic problems involved
in individualized education is
that science has a limited knowl
edge of the qualities of a good
human tutor.
Suppes is director of the In
stitute for Mathematical Studies
in Social Science, an organiza
tion which runs experimental
computer instruction programs
in elementary schools in East
Palo Alto, Mississippi, and Ap
palachia, and a first-year Rus
sian course at Stanford.
Drill and Practice
Computers are very valuable,
said Suppes, in performing rou
tine functions of drill and prac

tice after the teacher has intro
duced the concepts and skills in
volved. The elementary school
programs run by the Institute
for Mathematical Studies In So
cial Science are of this kind.
The computer can individualize
instruction by responding im
mediately to each student's an
swer, by organizing the mate
rial according to the ability of
the student, and by forming
special review drills aimed at
the student's weakness.
For drill and practice, a tele
type terminal — a typewriter
linked to a central computer —
is satisfactory, and presents few
technical difficulties. If, how
ever, the computer is to be a
tutor, initially introducing and

explaining the subject as well
as conducting drills, a much
more complex system is needed,
according to Suppes.
Computer "Dialogue"
"Most people cannot learn ele
mentary skills through vision
alone," he explained. "A tutor
computer must use spoken lan
guage. Moreover, most children
are not satisfied with being
talked at — they want to talk
back as well. For this reason,
we are attempting to develop
computers which can carry on
a dialogue."
Computers can also provide
detailed information about the
progress of the students and the
success of the curriculum, and
collect data for revealing how
students learn and why they en
counter difficulties.
"It's very likely if we want to
optimize learning (of subject
matter), we'll do so by putting
some constraints on student
choice," Suppes hypothesized.
But this may conflict with an
other educational objective: de
veloping individual ability to
make decisions, live with the
consequences, and set life-long
learning goals.
"What should we do if a first
grader continually wants to do
story-book problems rather than
arithmetic?" Suppes asked. "Or
if he wants to sign off after two
minutes? Or if a somewhat old
er student wishes to concentrate
in certain subjects? Should our
first priority be encouraging
choice-making or aiding the
learning process? There are no

clear answers to these and oth
er questions."
Computers will also reduce or
eliminate the need for central
ized education, enabling us to
revert to home education.
