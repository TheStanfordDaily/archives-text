# Former S.F. State Professor Blasts American Imperialism
## 
### MARK LITTLE 
John Gerassi, former profes
sor at San Francisco State Col
lege, advised Stanford students
to "drop out of the great white
academia and go fight for the
resistance movement. Going to
class just perpetuates the sys
tem."
Gerassi addressed Stanford
students on "The Vietnamization
of Latin America"yesterday
in Tresidder Union. The speech
concentrated on the "American
imperialistic spirit," "the great
white image," the failure of
American imperialism, and the
rise of the "new left."
"If you are a middle class
white and all you can do to help
the resistance movement is to
demonstrate and get your head
bashed in — do it. If all you can
do is put a bomb in a napalm
factory — do it. If you don't

want to serve in the army —
don't," Gerassi recommended.
"We have always been an im
perialist nation. Our active pol
icy of imperialism began the
minute our national expansion
hit the west coast of the United
States." He went on to say that,
"American capitalism hasn't
payed off in rural areas of Viet
nam because there is no return
on the investment. We are at
war at the present because for
eign peoples don't want Ameri
can modernization. Our imper
ialist spirit is the desire to style
foreigners in our image."
He went on to criticize the
"WASPS", middle class whites
who stifle minority groups to
maintain the "great white im
age."
Responding to a question on
our position in Vietnam, he said,
"It is a class war, the poor re
belling against the rich. Since
we can't defeat a bunch of gooks

with peashooters in Vietnam,
there must be something awful
good about their system and
something bad about our sys
tem."
Exporting Fascism
Concerning the alleged rise of
fascism in America, he said,
"Let's face it; we don't have it
yet. We export our fascism."
Dappling his commentary
with expletives and "etc.'s",
Gerassi concluded that "if you
can't say you are free until the
Huey Newtons are free and we
are out of Vietnam, then you
are committed."
Gerassi, a former editor of
Time magazine and correspond
ent for Newsweek and the New
York Times was recently fired
from his post as professor at
San Francisco State College. The
dismissal was the result of his
breaking into the administration
building during a recent demon
stration.
