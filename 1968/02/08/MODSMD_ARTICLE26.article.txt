# Stanford Gives Accelerator To South American School
## 
### 
In a gesture of international
scientific friendship, Stanford
University has given its 70-mil
lion-volt Mark II linear electron

accelerator to the University of
Sao Paulo in Brazil.
Operation of the 20-foot-long
atom smasher at Stanford was
discontinued more than a year
and a half ago. Used in investi
gations of basic electromagnetic
processes and nuclear structure,
it contributed research results
for many doctoral degrees in
physics awarded by the Univer
sity.
It was also used in postdoc
toral research by a number of
visiting foreign scientists, in
cluding Professor Jose Goldem
berg of the University of Sao
Paulo. He became one of its
most expert users, and was the
key man in a later moderniza
tion of the machine and in in
strumenting its program for nu
clear structure studies.
When Stanford's operation of
the machine ended, Professor
Goldemberg's keen desire to in
stall it in a new laboratory at the
University of Sao Paulo was
honored.
Mark II was a forerunner of

the billion-volt Mark 111, which
in turn preceded the 20-billion
volt two-mile machine at Stan
ford, now the world's most
powerful electron accelerator.
The Mark II is a powerful
accelerator in comparison with
betatrons and synchrotrons, the
physicists said, but a rather mod
est machine in comparison with
some half-dozen powerful elec
-tron accelerators operating in
the U.S. It is, they suggested, a
very good research tool for an
institution which has no means
of obtaining a more powerful
machine.
Both the Mark II and Mark 111
were located in the High Energy
Physics Laboratory, where work
is now proceeding on a super
conducting linear electron accel
erator that physicists believe
will operate even more effective
ly in certain types of research.
Its design is based on the fact
that at temperatures near abso
lute zero (-459 degrees F.) cer
tain metals lose all apparent
resistance to the flow of elec
tric current.
