## 
### 
• A 30-yearold history profes
sor who received his doctorate
from Stanford in 1965 will not
swabbing floors in Kansas
JCity as his draft board ordered.
Professor Noel L. Brann was
: given an alternative service as
j signment as a janitor by his
board in Reno, Nevada af
ster he turned in his draft card.
?iHe has been a conscientious ob
jector since 1960.
Selective Service headquart
ers in Washington overruled the
board's assignment, simply
that his case is being re-
J processed.
Branr may still be assigned a
civilian job in lieu of induction
- but presumably it will be more
in line with his IQ of 175.
. "This doesn't solve the prob
lem of using the draft as a
« punitive measure," Brann said.
He said he thought the order
was overruled because "it was
• too much for people to swal
low."
