# 'Scratch Sheet'
## Questionnaire Circulation Set 
### 
An ambitious new "Scratch
Sheet", or course evaluation
booklet, will begin work tomor
row by distributing a trial ques
tionnaire to 300 students in sev
eral calculus, psychology, com
munications and philosophy
courses.
The results will be analyzed
by a computer early next week
and immediately made available
to the professors and classes in
volved.
The Associated Students' proj
ect is under the direction of
John Chatterton, a communica
tions graduate student. His com
mittee hopes to distribute as
many as five different types of
questionnaires and publish a
comprehensive course evaluation
booklet before June.
'The purpose of this booklet
will be to inform students of
the relative merits of various

courses they may take," Chatter
ton said.
The questionnaires will ask
students to rate on a 1 to 5 scale
such things as the professor's
knowledge of his subject, or
ganization, coherency of lectures,
and skill at entertaining and mo
tivating the student. Students
will be asked what grade they
expect to receive and whether
they would sign up for the
course if given a second chance.
Other questions will ask if
the course's description in the
Course and Degrees bulletin is
accurate, and if the course's
prerequisites were necessary.
Computers will analyze each
questionnaire on a "lie ladder"
and throw out those with con
tradictory answers.
Tomorrow's survey is a pilot
study. "We want to get the bugs
out of it," said Skip Tammany,

a member of the committee.
v The committee's next project
will be distributing a question
naire to every freshman English
class in two weeks. Later sur
veys will be made of graduating
seniors and majors in certain
departments.
The 1960 Scratch Sheet will
be published as a supplement
to The Daily in spring and mail
ed to incoming freshmen over
the summer.
To complete its work, the com
mittee will ask the legislature
for another $1,000 in addition
to its $900 budget.
