# U.S. Destroys City To Oust Viet Cong
## 
### 
BEN TRE, Vietnam (AP) —
"It became necessary to destroy
the town to save it," a U.S. ma
jor said Wednesday.
He was talking about the grim
decision that allied commanders
made when Viet Cong attackers
overran most of this Mekong
Delta city 45 miles southwest of
Saigon.
They decided that regardless
of civilian casualties they must
bomb and shell the once placid
river city of 35,000 to rout the
Viet Cong forces.
Heavy guns were turned on
the city's streets. Jet fighter
bombers carrying bombs, rock
ets and napalm were ordered
into the attack.
U.S. advisers said the Viet
Cong occupied the city so rapid
ly it was not possible to warn ci
vilians of the impending air
strikes or the artillery barrages,
particularly with the Viet Cong
in control of the radio station.
The decision was not taken
lightly, U.S. advisers asserted.
"They are our friends out
there," said one American,
pointing to the smoking city.
"We waited until we had no
choice. The Vietnamese chief of
staff had to bring in an air
strike on the house of his neigh
bor."
Ben Tre was one of the cities
attacked by the Viet Cong at the
height of last week's fighting.
Details of its destruction in the
three-day battle to oust the Viet
Cong became known Wednes
day.
Available casualty statistics
indicate that at least as many
Vietnamese civilians as combat
ants died in the battle.

U.S. advisers said the heavy
allied firepower hurled on the
city to drive out the Viet Cong
probably contributed largely to
the deaths of at least 500 civili
ans and possibly 1,000. South
Vietnamese officials say the en
emy dead totaled 451. About 50
Vietnamese soldiers died, along
with more than 20 Americans
from the U.S. 9th Infantry Divi
sion.
Lt. Col. James Dare of Chi
cago, commander of U.S. Advi
sory Team 93, said "we will
never know for sure" the num
ber of civilians who died.
"Many families are buried
permanently under the rubble,"
he said.
Americans say 45 per cent of
the city was destroyed. The
Vietnamese province chief said
that if the village environs are
considered, Ben Tre was 85 per
cent destroyed.
U.S. officers say the firepower
had to be used and that allied
casualties would have been far
higher if heavy firepower had
not been employed.
The battle opened when a
regimental-sized enemy force of
approximately 2,500 men invad
ed the city and the surrounding
villages, U.S. advisers said. The
decision to use jets and heavy
guns to dislodge the attackers
was made early in the battle
when the Viet Cong almost had
the city under its control.
The Ben Tre defenders said
the Viet Cong was containing
Vietnamese and U.S. forces try
ing to counterattack and that
the Viet Cong seized the radio
station and began broadcasting
to the population.

into the attack.
U.S. advisers said the Viet
Cong occupied the city so rapid
ly it was not possible to warn ci
vilians of the impending air
strikes or the artillery barrages,
particularly with the Viet Cong
in control of the radio station.
The decision was not taken
lightly, U.S. advisers asserted.
"They are our friends out
there," said one American,
pointing to the smoking city.
"We waited until we had no
choice. The Vietnamese chief of
staff had to bring in an air
strike on the house of his neigh
bor."
Ben Tre was one of the cities
attacked by the Viet Cong at the
height of last week's fighting.
Details of its destruction in the
three-day battle to oust the Viet
Cong became known Wednes
day.
Available casualty statistics
indicate that at least as many
Vietnamese civilians as combat
ants died in the battle.

U.S. advisers said the heavy
allied firepower hurled on the
city to drive out the Viet Cong
probably contributed largely to
the deaths of at least 500 civili
ans and possibly 1,000. South
Vietnamese officials say the en
emy dead totaled 451. About 50
Vietnamese soldiers died, along
with more than 20 Americans
from the U.S. 9th Infantry Divi
sion.
Lt. Col. James Dare of Chi
cago, commander of U.S. Advi
sory Team 93, said "we will
never know for sure" the num
ber of civilians who died.
"Many families are buried
permanently under the rubble,"
he said.
Americans say 45 per cent of
the city was destroyed. The
Vietnamese province chief said
that if the village environs are
considered, Ben Tre was 85 per
cent destroyed.
U.S. officers say the firepower
had to be used and that allied
casualties would have been far
higher if heavy firepower had
not been employed.
The battle opened when a
regimental-sized enemy force of
approximately 2,500 men invad
ed the city and the surrounding
villages, U.S. advisers said. The
decision to use jets and heavy
guns to dislodge the attackers
was made early in the battle
when the Viet Cong almost had
the city under its control.
The Ben Tre defenders said
the Viet Cong was containing
Vietnamese and U.S. forces try
ing to counterattack and that
the Viet Cong seized the radio
station and began broadcasting
to the population.
BEN TRE, Vietnam (AP) —
"It became necessary to destroy
the town to save it," a U.S. ma
jor said Wednesday.
He was talking about the grim
decision that allied commanders
made when Viet Cong attackers
overran most of this Mekong
Delta city 45 miles southwest of
Saigon.
They decided that regardless
of civilian casualties they must
bomb and shell the once placid
river city of 35,000 to rout the
Viet Cong forces.
Heavy guns were turned on
the city's streets. Jet fighter
bombers carrying bombs, rock
ets and napalm were ordered
into the attack.
