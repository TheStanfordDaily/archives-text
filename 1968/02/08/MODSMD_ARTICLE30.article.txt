# Tribe Diamond Hopes Sparkle
## 
### PETER DUFFY (First of Two Parts) 
It's not quite spring, but nev
ertheless it's time for baseball
at Stanford. The Indians, with
first year coach Ray Young at
the helm, are confident and en
ergetic as they begin a long 55-
game season against the Stan
ford Frosh at 2 p.m. Saturday.
Last year's ballclub finished
third at the Omaha College
World Series, and with all but
two players back from that
starting lineup, this year's team
could very well go all the way.
Ray Young, in his rookie year
as head coach, knows he has
the horses.
"This is a young, veteran
team made up of hard, talented
workers. We've got one of the
toughest schedules in the coun
try, but if we're good enough
we'll win.
"We're not playing for an un

blemished record, hut for four
goals: 1) the conference cham
pionship, 2) the district cham
pionship, 3) Ihe Omaha World
Series, and 4) the Number One
ranking in the country. These
are not unrealistic goals for this
year's team.
"We've got excellent pitching
and defense, and a fast and po
tent offense where every man
is capable of hitting a long ball.
There's no question about the
ability of these boys.
"Right now we are extremely
energetic and extremely confi
dent, and it is entirely conceiva
ble that we can have a better
year than last year, which was
the best in Stanford's history."
Just listening to Coach Young
is enough to be convinced, but
after looking at the team there
should be no doubt in anyone's
mind that it is of championship
quality.

latching is probably the
Tribe's strongest point. Rod Po
teete, Sandy Vance, Harvey
Schank, and Frank Klinger
head a staff that is deep in tal
ent.
The 6-7 Poteete — who fash
ioned a 5-1 record with a 1.33
E.R A. last season—is the ace
of the staff. With a herky-jerky
motion of arms and legs, excel
lent control, and a deceptive
fast ball, Poteete is hard to beat.
Vance (11-0 last season) has a
good fastball and an excellent
curve, but is bothered periodic
ally by control. Schank, at 6-5
and 210 lbs., can throw hard,
and has an excellent slider to
compliment his fastball.
Fireman Klinger
Klinger is the top reliever on
the staff. He's a senior who
throws a good slider and curve,

with excellent control, and han
dles himseLf with aplomb in
tight situations. His 4-0 record
and 1.41 E.R.A. attests to that.
Right with these four at the
top of the staff is junior Don
Rose. Rose is ineligible this
quarter, but should see action
in April.
Rose Blossoms
Young claims that Rose has
"the greatest variety of pitches
on our staff. He has great stuff
and is always moving the ball
around."
Behind these five are four
sophomores whom Young is
very high on.
One of them is Bob Moore,
who has the best fastball on the
team. Says Young, "Moore is a
power pitcher who will be great
once he learns control."
Phil Keller is another soph

who has good control and
throws hard.
Promising: Sophs
The other two sophomores are
Bob Sharpe and Ben Burch, who
specialize in control and excel
lent breaking pitches.
Rounding out the staff are
three more righthanders—Tony
Karlas, Jim Russel, and Lou
Wolcher—each of whom has
shown promise.
One quirk concerning the
hurlers is that every one is
righthanded. If the pitching staff
has any weakness at all, it's the
lack of a southpaw.
Young will probably carry
eight men on his staff. With a
55-game schedule, none of the
hurlers should be able to com
plain about idleness.

hitters will appear)

good fastball and an excellent

ally by control. Schank, at 6-5
and 210 lbs., can throw hard,
and has an excellent slider to
compliment his fastball.
Fireman Klinger
Klinger is the top reliever on
the staff. He's a senior who
throws a good slider and curve,

with excellent control, and han
dles himseLf with aplomb in
tight situations. His 4-0 record
and 1.41 E.R.A. attests to that.
Right with these four at the
top of the staff is junior Don
Rose. Rose is ineligible this
quarter, but should see action
in April.
Rose Blossoms
Young claims that Rose has
"the greatest variety of pitches
on our staff. He has great stuff
and is always moving the ball
around."
Behind these five are four
sophomores whom Young is
very high on.
One of them is Bob Moore,
who has the best fastball on the
team. Says Young, "Moore is a
power pitcher who will be great
once he learns control."
Phil Keller is another soph

who has good control and
throws hard.
Promising: Sophs
The other two sophomores are
Bob Sharpe and Ben Burch, who
specialize in control and excel
lent breaking pitches.
Rounding out the staff are
three more righthanders—Tony
Karlas, Jim Russel, and Lou
Wolcher—each of whom has
shown promise.
One quirk concerning the
hurlers is that every one is
righthanded. If the pitching staff
has any weakness at all, it's the
lack of a southpaw.
Young will probably carry
eight men on his staff. With a
55-game schedule, none of the
hurlers should be able to com
plain about idleness.
