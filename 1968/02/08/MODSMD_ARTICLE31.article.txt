TENNIS ANYONE? â€” Stanford's tennis team, paced by Dean
Schlobohm (pictured above), swings into action today at 2:30. The
varsity will be taking on San Fernando Valley, while the JV's
will host Cal Poly. Coach Jack Gould indicated that Schlobohm,
who has his sights set on being top man, will be playing number
two today due to a sore arm.
