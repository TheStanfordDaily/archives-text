# INTRAMURAL ROUNDUP
## Basketball 
### JERRY YOSHITOMI 
The Intramural Basketball
competition is presently in the
fourth round of play with many
undefeated teams still remain
ing. The Sigma Chi's still domi
nate their league with a 4-0 rec
ord, but there are some strong
teams in other leagues that
should give the Sigs some stiff
competition once the champion
ship tournament begins on Mon
day, February 26th.
The Chi Psi's, in league two,
have defeated a strong Theta
Delt team and have a 4-0 rec
ord. Tom Krause and Jim Eakin
lead the Chi Psi's with their
strong rebounding and shoot
ing. The Chi Psi's should be
considered to be the prime
threat to the Sigma Chi's at
tempt for a second straight in
tramural basketball champion
ship.
Potent Panthers
The Panthers, an off-campus
team with many good players,
have showed fine strength and
are also undefeated.
Also among the ranks of the
undefeated are Arroyo, Fremont,
Branner, Serra, Tigre, and the
Plainsmen, all of whom are pres
ently fighting for league cham
pionships.
Unbeaten Trio
In the graduate leagues, Beta
Biz, First-Year Med, and School
of Education II are also with
out a loss. The above trio, along
with the KA's, Theta Delta, and
the winners of league 3 (where
a tie exists between SAE, DU,
Delts.), should produce some
exciting games during the next

two weeks and also in the cham
pionship playoffs.
In the playoffs, Sigma Chi
should definitely be favored, but
with so many talented teams
in the tournament, an inspired
opponent could possibly spell de
feat for last year's champs.
