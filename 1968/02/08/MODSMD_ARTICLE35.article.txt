# Ehrlich Urges TV For Birth Control
## 
### 
Biology Professor Paul R.
Ehrlich proposed yesterday a
massive international education
campaign to help solve the
world population crisis, involv
ing $2 billion worth of giveaway
TV sets.
Family planning, along with
all other efforts to control world
population, has failed and the
"death rate solution is upon us,"
Ehrlich told a Planned Parent
hood of San Francisco fund
raising luncheon.
"Some 3.5 million people,
mostly children, will starve to
death this year," he said. "It is
not inconceivable that 500 mil
lion human beings will perish
from famine before the great
die-back ends."
Education Is Key
"Attitude change, not techno
logical advancement, is the key
to surviving the time of famines
and avoiding its repetition. Most
of our efforts must be directed
toward educating Americans.
The U.S. could be a powerful
force in shaping the attitudes
of all men.
"In his State of the Union
message President Johnson
spoke of using communications
satellites to educate people
world-wide. My guess is that the
government could procure small,
transitorized, limited channel
TV sets for $50 each. For the
relatively small investment of

perhaps $2 billion, some 20 to
40 million TV sets coulrl he
placed in villages in the under
developed world.
"This would be enough to
reach the vast majority of peo
ple if they could be distributed
properly and viewed communal

Two Proposal*
Two other proposals to coun
teract the effects of famine were
also presented by Prof. Ehrlich:
• Crash programs of popula
tion control and food production
to "ameliorate the time of fam
ines" and to preserve man's en
vironment.
• Immediate international
planning to minimize chances of
a thermonuclear war "as the
great famines heighten interna
tional tension."
Prof. Ehrlich said he Is im
pressed by how few people real
ize what population biologists
consider "the most elementary
facts of life." These, he said,
are:
(1) Populations cannot grow
forever; (2) population growth
must end, either through depres
sion of the birth rate or increase
of the death rate; (3) population
growth can outstrip any con
ceivable food supply; (4) popu
lation growth is a prime cause
of environmental deterioration;
(5) population pressure pro
motes war; and (6) availability
of contraceptives does not guar
antee population control.
Warn of Distractions
The Stanford biologist also
warned against "distractions we
should campaign against" in the
educational program.
"A whole array can be lumped
as the 'technological dream
world,' " he said, "populated by
'experts' pushing panaceas-hy
droponics, fish meal, food from
petroleum, harvesting the sea,
intrauterine devices, the pill,
and so forth.
Another group of distraction
ists he labeled the "slow and re
sponsible" who form committees
to "study the problem" and de
velop "research programs.
"Certainly we need more re
search and planning—but even
more we need action. Unless
people's attitudes are changed,
and changed fast, all research
and planning will be for noth
ing."
A third distraction he termed
the "quality problem"—concern
for the possible degeneration of
human intelligence due to "over
breeding of the 'less smart.'" It
is quantity, he said, not quality
of the population that requires
immediate attention.

Ehrlich proposed yesterday a
massive international education
campaign to help solve the
world population crisis, involv
ing $2 billion worth of giveaway
TV sets.
Family planning, along with
all other efforts to control world
population, has failed and the
"death rate solution is upon us,"
Ehrlich told a Planned Parent
hood of San Francisco fund
raising luncheon.
"Some 3.5 million people,
mostly children, will starve to
death this year," he said. "It is
not inconceivable that 500 mil
lion human beings will perish
from famine before the great
die-back ends."
Education Is Key
"Attitude change, not techno
logical advancement, is the key
to surviving the time of famines
and avoiding its repetition. Most
of our efforts must be directed
toward educating Americans.
The U.S. could be a powerful
force in shaping the attitudes
of all men.
"In his State of the Union
message President Johnson
spoke of using communications
satellites to educate people
world-wide. My guess is that the
government could procure small,
transitorized, limited channel
TV sets for $50 each. For the
relatively small investment of

perhaps $2 billion, some 20 to
40 million TV sets coulrl he
placed in villages in the under
developed world.

Two Proposal*
Two other proposals to coun
teract the effects of famine were
also presented by Prof. Ehrlich:
• Crash programs of popula
tion control and food production
to "ameliorate the time of fam
ines" and to preserve man's en
vironment.
• Immediate international
planning to minimize chances of
a thermonuclear war "as the
great famines heighten interna
tional tension."
Prof. Ehrlich said he Is im
pressed by how few people real
ize what population biologists
consider "the most elementary
facts of life." These, he said,
are:
(1) Populations cannot grow
forever; (2) population growth
must end, either through depres
sion of the birth rate or increase
of the death rate; (3) population
growth can outstrip any con
ceivable food supply; (4) popu
lation growth is a prime cause
of environmental deterioration;
(5) population pressure pro
motes war; and (6) availability
of contraceptives does not guar
antee population control.
Warn of Distractions
The Stanford biologist also
warned against "distractions we
should campaign against" in the
educational program.
"A whole array can be lumped
as the 'technological dream
world,' " he said, "populated by
'experts' pushing panaceas-hy
droponics, fish meal, food from
petroleum, harvesting the sea,
intrauterine devices, the pill,
and so forth.
Another group of distraction
ists he labeled the "slow and re
sponsible" who form committees
to "study the problem" and de
velop "research programs.
"Certainly we need more re
search and planning—but even
more we need action. Unless
people's attitudes are changed,
and changed fast, all research
and planning will be for noth
ing."
A third distraction he termed
the "quality problem"—concern
for the possible degeneration of
human intelligence due to "over
breeding of the 'less smart.'" It
is quantity, he said, not quality
of the population that requires
immediate attention.
