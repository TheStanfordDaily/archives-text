# Total Birth Control Urged (?) By Art Hoppe In Dink Speech
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
A startling new solution to
the Vietnam war was proposed
by Art Hoppe in his speech in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last
night.
"Total birth control will end
this war in a single generation,"
the noted columnist for The
Stanford Daily and other news
papers said.
Hoppe also claimed it would
end other problems of modern
man such as "urban sprawl,
pollution, Senator Eastland,
and people who cough during
the third act of 'Lohengrin'."
The key to the solutions of
the troubles of humanity, he
claimed, was that "the fewer
people we have the fewer prob
lems. Therefore, the only way
to eliminate all our problems is
obvious."
Claiming to be president of
the League for Total Birth Con
trol, Hoppe promoted two of the
group's slogans, "Ban the Mom"
and "Better Red Than Bred."
The second phrase was used
to boost a birth control pill for
men which was safe, harmless,
and cheap, but had "only one
tiny, little drawback. If you take
even one little drink while you
are on these pills, your eyeballs
turn bright red."
Hoppe said he was spurred
to speaking on this topic by the
recent proposals by Lambda Nu
and Beta Chi for coed fraterni
ties.
He said this will cause
grave questions for the girls
who will live in the fraterni
ties, like, "How should I tell
my parents I made a fratern
ity?"
In closing, Hoppe urged them
to seriously consider total birth
control, and "practice, practice,
practice."
He received a standing ova
tion.
Hoppe also discussed several

of the television serials he has
created, such as "The Real
Great Society," "Dick and Pat,"
"Barry Boldwater, Boy Ameri
can," "The Rocky Road to Hap
piness," and "Sir Ronald of
Holyroot."
"Real Great Society" concerns
the Jay family: it's head, Elbe;
his wife, Dirty Bird; his daugh
ters, Mynah and Birdie Bird;
and their, husbands, one of
whom went into television, and
the other to Vietnam, "the other
family business."
"Gary Boldwater," which has
been discontinued, dealt with a
man who was "faster than a
horseless carriage, able to leap
tall issues in a single bound,"
and who would often "jump into
his jet plane and turn on his
20-20 vision and 100 IQ."
And so on throughout the eve
ning.
