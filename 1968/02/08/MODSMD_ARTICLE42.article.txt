# 'Game Of Life'
## 'Greasepaint' To Open 
### 
Stephen Jay Book, formerly a
professional director in New
York, will direct "The Roar of
the Greasepaint — The Smell of
the Crowd," a Ram's Head pro
duction, opening February 14 in
the Nitery at Stanford.
Book, only twenty-two years
old, is an established New York
director and professional actor.
He has directed "Once Upon a
Mattress" and two productions

of "The Fantastiks." He has also
appeared in "Guys and Dolls",
"Li'l Abner", and"The Fantas
tiks."
Game of Life
Book has described the pro
duction as "A positive statement
about the game of life. The au
dience will recognize for them
selves certain familiar types in
the show, types that are in
charge of our society."

Glenn Cannon, professional
actor and a lecturer in the De
partment of Speech and Drama,
plays the lead role of Cocky,
and Carrillo Gantner, a Master
of Fine Arts candidate, plays
the other leading role of Sir.
In addition, "Roar of the
Greasepaint" features Heather
Ferguson, known to the Stan
ford community for her role as
Tweeny In the 1967 Gaities. Re
ba Waters and Larry Rosen
zweig have been cast in support
ing roles. Completing the cast
are the ten urchins: Polly Ad
ams, Teri Brown, Becky Dan
iels, Gretchen Grant, Susan Ray,
Wendy Weiner, Hilary Kelvin,
Stephanie Kelvin, and Terry
Tanner.
Small Theatre
Book was enthusiastic about
the diminutive size of the Nit
ery. "I think it is exciting," he
said. "A full size Broadway mu
sical in a 100-seat house. I
would never have produced it on
a larger stage; this involves the
audience a great deal more."
"The Roar of the Greasepaint
—The Smell of the Crowd"
opens Feb. 14 in the Nitery and
runs Feb. 14 and 15 at 8:30 p.m.
and Feb. 16 and 17 at 7:30 and
