# S. Viet Camp Falls To North
## 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — The Lang
Vei Special Forces camp has
fallen to North Vietnamese
troops supported by Soviet-built
tanks, South Vietnamese head
quarters reported Thursday.
But it said 76 defenders, includ
ing 12 Americans, escaped.
A government spokesman
said the camp, astride the inva
sion route from Laos in South
Vietnam's northwest corner,
was overrun about 6:40 p.m.,
Saigon time. The camp had
been under siege for 18 hours by
infantry, rockets, flame throw
ers and, for the first reported
time, Hussian-made tanks.
The spokesman said 316 de
fenders, most of them civilian
irregulars, were killed, wounded
or missing. He said the survi

vors escaped to the Marine
combat base at Khe Sanh, about
three miles to the east. They
were said to include 60 civilians,
four South Vietnamese Special
Forces troops and 12 U.S. Green
Berets.
Like all Special Forces
camps, Lang Vei was not ex
pected to be able to withstand
a massive enemy attack. The
camps are spotted in strate
gic areas, often near the bord
ers, where scouts can keep
watch for enemy troop move
ments and intelligence infor
mation.
The capabilities of air and ar
tillery to provide support often
has meant survival for the
camps, however, and relatively
few have been overrun.

As the focus of the latest Com
munist offensive shifted to the
northern frontier, the U.S. Com
mand said 24,662 of the enemy
had been killed in the last nine
days of fighting throughout the
country.
On the allied side, 2,043 troops
— including 703 Americans —
were reported killed since the
Communists opened the war's
biggest offensive against South
Vietnam's cities. The wounded
included 3,729 Americans, 4,493
South Vietnamese troops and
154 other allies.
There were other clashes
across the country, but in
many areas the fighting had
tapered off from the intensity
of last week and the people
were trying to begin a recov

ery from the destructive at
tacks that his 35 populated
centers. Sporadic fighting per
sisted in and around Saigon.
In the north, some of the ma
jor action also continued that
began with the enemy's lunar
new year offensive Jan. 30.
In Hue, the onetime imperial
capital 400 miles north of Sai
gon, U.S. Marines and South
Vietnamese troops still battled
to oust enemy forces along the
south bank of the Perfume Riv-

er and in the old walled Citadel.
Marines had taken about 45 per
cent of their objective on the
south and inched ahead in tough
street fighting. In the Citadel on
the north side of the river, South
Vietnamese troops were battling
to wrest control of the lower
third of the old walled city from
the enemy.
The flood of refugees mounted
in areas from Hue in the north
to Ben Tre in the Mekong Delta.

U.S. sources said 254,729 had
been registered, including 93,000
in the Saigon area.
Fragmentary reports show
11,000 civilians killed or wound
ed.
With UJS. help, South Viet
nam has launched a multimil
lion-dollar effort to take care
of civilian victims of the fight
ing. Called Operation Recov
ery, the major aim Is to con
vince South Vietnam's 17 mil
lion people that the Saigon
government cares more for
their welfare than the Com
munists do.
The U.S. government is pro
viding most of the funds and ad
visers.
Vice President Nguyen Cao
Ky heads the recovery commit
tee.
Reporting on the Lang Vei
siege, South Vietnamese head
quarters gave no breakdown on
the number killed, wounded or
missing. The total of 316 was
said to include, civilians, gov
ernment troops and American
advisers.
Some of the defenders were
reported lifted out of the camp
by U.S. helicopters when it was
decided to abandon it.
It was the second frontier
Special Forces camp to fall to
the Communists in the last
two years. A Shau, 80 miles
to the south, was seized In
March 1966, and was never re
taken.
The Vietnamese command
had announced Wednesday mor
ning that the Lang Vei camp
had been overrun and that an
aerial observer reported seeing
enemy soldiers swarming
through the perimeter.
The U.S. Command later re
ported, however, that defenders

were holding out in bunkers and
that they had received radio re
ports from the embattled de
fenders as late as 4 p.m.
Wednesday.
In a claim that didn't jibe
with American reports, Radio
Hanoi declared the camp was
overrun at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday
after a fight of little more than
two hours and the defenders
were annihilated or captured. It
said two outposts to the south
also fell.

country.
On the allied side, 2,043 troops
— including 703 Americans —
were reported killed since the
Communists opened the war's
biggest offensive against South
Vietnam's cities. The wounded
included 3,729 Americans, 4,493
South Vietnamese troops and
154 other allies.
There were other clashes
across the country, but in
many areas the fighting had
tapered off from the intensity
of last week and the people
were trying to begin a recov

In the north, some of the ma

new year offensive Jan. 30.
In Hue, the onetime imperial
capital 400 miles north of Sai
gon, U.S. Marines and South
Vietnamese troops still battled
to oust enemy forces along the
south bank of the Perfume Riv-

er and in the old walled Citadel.
Marines had taken about 45 per
cent of their objective on the
south and inched ahead in tough
street fighting. In the Citadel on
the north side of the river, South
Vietnamese troops were battling
to wrest control of the lower
third of the old walled city from
the enemy.
The flood of refugees mounted
in areas from Hue in the north
to Ben Tre in the Mekong Delta.

U.S. sources said 254,729 had
been registered, including 93,000
in the Saigon area.

Reporting on the Lang Vei
siege, South Vietnamese head
quarters gave no breakdown on
the number killed, wounded or
missing. The total of 316 was
said to include, civilians, gov
ernment troops and American
advisers.
Some of the defenders were
reported lifted out of the camp
by U.S. helicopters when it was
decided to abandon it.
It was the second frontier
Special Forces camp to fall to
the Communists in the last
two years. A Shau, 80 miles
to the south, was seized In
March 1966, and was never re
taken.
The Vietnamese command
had announced Wednesday mor
ning that the Lang Vei camp
had been overrun and that an
aerial observer reported seeing
enemy soldiers swarming
through the perimeter.
The U.S. Command later re
ported, however, that defenders

were holding out in bunkers and
that they had received radio re
ports from the embattled de
fenders as late as 4 p.m.
Wednesday.
In a claim that didn't jibe
with American reports, Radio
Hanoi declared the camp was
overrun at 2:30 a.m. Wednesday
after a fight of little more than
two hours and the defenders
were annihilated or captured. It
said two outposts to the south
also fell.
SAIGON (AP) — The Lang
Vei Special Forces camp has
fallen to North Vietnamese
troops supported by Soviet-built
tanks, South Vietnamese head
quarters reported Thursday.
But it said 76 defenders, includ
ing 12 Americans, escaped.
A government spokesman
said the camp, astride the inva
sion route from Laos in South
Vietnam's northwest corner,
was overrun about 6:40 p.m.,
Saigon time. The camp had
been under siege for 18 hours by
infantry, rockets, flame throw
ers and, for the first reported
time, Hussian-made tanks.
The spokesman said 316 de
fenders, most of them civilian
irregulars, were killed, wounded
or missing. He said the survi

vors escaped to the Marine
combat base at Khe Sanh, about
three miles to the east. They
were said to include 60 civilians,
four South Vietnamese Special
Forces troops and 12 U.S. Green
Berets.
Like all Special Forces
camps, Lang Vei was not ex
pected to be able to withstand
a massive enemy attack. The
camps are spotted in strate
gic areas, often near the bord
ers, where scouts can keep
watch for enemy troop move
ments and intelligence infor
mation.
The capabilities of air and ar
tillery to provide support often
has meant survival for the
camps, however, and relatively
few have been overrun.

As the focus of the latest Com
munist offensive shifted to the
northern frontier, the U.S. Com
mand said 24,662 of the enemy
had been killed in the last nine
days of fighting throughout the
country.
