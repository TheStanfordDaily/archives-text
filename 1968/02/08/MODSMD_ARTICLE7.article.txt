# Draft Law In Courts
## 
### 
A San Francisco judge agreed
Tuesday to consider a petition
for a three judge court to rule
on the constitutionality of using
the draft as punishment, and
halted the induction of two stu
dents who mailed in their draft
cards.
American Civil Liberties Un
ion attorney Marshall Krause
filed a suit on behalf of four
Californians who had mailed
their draft cards to their draft
boards. He said the suit will
test the power of boards to or r

der immediate induction in such
cases.
Two of the four students (not
the two who were scheduled for
induction) are from Stanford.
They were: student David R.
Alkire, 22, who was reclassified
to 1-A although he had served
his Army enlistment and is in
the active reserve. He has not
received an order for. induction;
and Stanford graduate Joel
Kugelmass, now at Brandeis
University.

Kugelmass was reclassified
from 2-S to 1-A, but has not
been ordered for induction from
his San Jose board.
The attorney charged in his
suit that the rights of his clients
are being invaded because the
use of the draft act as a punish
ment deprives them of their
right to due process as guaran
teed by the Constitution.
