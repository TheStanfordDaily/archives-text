A petition is now circu
lating on campus which
calls for a higher percent
age of Negroes to be ad
mitted to Stanford.
The petition demands an
"altered admissions policy,
such that racial composi
tion of this year's incom
ing Stanford freshman
class is proportionate to
that of the general popula
tion."
The statement asks a
goal of 132 Negroes in the
next freshman class. Larry
PischofT, senior, one of the
petitions backers, said
they would be turned in
Monday to the admissions
office.
PischofT said, "What I
want to emphasize is not
only the unfairness of
numbers but the cultural
narrowness of Stanford
now. We recognize the
problems of academics
standards and financial
aid, but other places have
worked out solutions, and
so can Stanford."
