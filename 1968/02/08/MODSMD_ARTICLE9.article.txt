# Campaign Manager Speaks
## 'McCarthy Win Possible' 
### 
Eugene McCarthy's California
campaign manager said yester
day the presidential candidate's
goal is to show party leaders
that "Johnson spells defeat" for
the Democrats.
Speaking before a crowd of
130 in White Plaza, Gerald Hill,
who is also president of the
California Democratic Council,
said McCarthy had a good
chance of winning the June pri
mary election in California.
The Johnson delegation to the
convention, he said, is being
composed in Washington. "I'm
told they are having difficulty
finding people who are anxious
to serve on that delegation."
"The McCarthy delegation,

which has an excellent chance
to win [the primary] in June ...,
will be absolutely dedicated to
seating integrated delegations
from Alabama, Louisiana, Mis
sissippi and Georgia."
McCarthy's stand on the Viet
nam war has become more dov
ish in recent months, Hill said.
He invited his audience to join
in a "meaningful effort to put
America's priorities back in or
der, to stop the war in Vietnam
. . . ~ to once again tell the
American people and tell the
world that America tells the
truth and that there are Ameri
cans who are willing to do some
thing about it."
Stanford senior Craig Schind
ler of the Stanford Committee

for McCarthy had earlier urged
listeners to work in McCarthy's
campaign.
"If you're anything like me,"
he said, "you sort of oscillate
between a kind of despair found
ed on futility and a kind of de
tachment from the political proc
ess.
"I suggest that this is no an
swer, and that when a man like
McCarthy steps out and puts his
whole political career on the
line, and in essence says he is
willing to sacrifice himself and
make himself a figure around
which this [antiwar] movement
can organize, then we have a
responsibility ... to make this
an effective protest and to build
on it.
