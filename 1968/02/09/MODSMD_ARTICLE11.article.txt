# An analysis of The Analyst'
## 
### 
James Coburn's latest film, The President's
Analyst, is a rare combination of entertain
ment and bold criticism of our society. The plot
is simple so as to provide the maximum room
for social commentary.
The film is essentially a satiric review, a
vehicle from which to attack the world around
us; we can either laugh or cry, but we are not
concerned with where we are going. Thus the
end of the movie is an abrupt stop rather than
the logical conclusion to a series of incidents.
The story concerns the need of the President
of the United States for an analyst to whom he
can confide the problems and pressures of his
office. However the chosen analyst, James Co
burn, soon learns that he himself is now in
need of an analyst. But because of the classi
fied information he has learned from the Presi
dent, he is allowed to talk to no one.
After a few weeks of constant calls to the
White House, Coburn breaks down and flees
from Washington and the world. The rest of
the movie deals with the attempts to capture
him by foreign powers, who want his top
secret information; the F.B.R. and C.R.A., who
want to kill him; and the T.P.C. (Telephone
Company), who want to use him.
The plot, however, is a mere skeleton. What
makes the film valuable and interesting are
the comments on the Negro, the New White
Liberalism, and Violence in our society. God
frey Cambridge, who plays a C.R.A. agent,
gives an eloquent and moving monologue on
growing up and learning the meaning of the
word nigger: "I ran down the street, like the
other kids, and yelled run, run here comes the
little nigger, just like they were, and then my
brother told me what a nigger was."
Later, when Coburn is trying to make his
escape, he moves in with a family whom he

met while they were touring the White House.
Coburn poses as a member of the President's
staff, concerned with finding out what the av
erage American thinks. While Coburn talks
with the husband, who thinks that "those damn
flag - waving, right - wing fascists next door
should be gassed, and the young son plays
with the car gun (not to be confused with the
house gun) and listens to phone conversations
with his junior spy kit.
The film also plays upon the C.I.A. and
F. 8.1. (C.R.A. and F.B.R. in the movie).
There is a beautiful caricature of J. Edgar Hoo
ver, who is upset about Coburn's living with a
young lady and all the added expenses that
have been laid upon the American taxpayer.
The C.R.A., meanwhile, is buying a home and
a car for the President's analyst.
The President's Analyst is typical of the
new genre of American film—the entertaining
morality play. Audiences must be appealed to
on all levels. There are those who simply view
movies as entertainment, while others seek a
slight bit more sophistication and art in the
cinema. The President's Analyst is unquestion
ably suited to serve as mere entertainment, but
it also represents an attempt to reach those
who want meaning and expression in film.
There are a few sections that do reach this
goal, though the film as a whole could not be
mistaken for Red Desert or any other Anton
nioni product.
Still the film shows that American pictures
are moving in the right direction. Hollywood
melodramas can be seen free on television; to
day's audience hopefully wants more than that.
The President's Analyst is currently playing
at the Fox in Burlingame, Cinema Hacienda
in Sunnyvale, and Carlos in San Carlos.

have been laid upon the American taxpayer.
The C.R.A., meanwhile, is buying a home and
a car for the President's analyst.
The President's Analyst is typical of the
new genre of American film—the entertaining
morality play. Audiences must be appealed to
on all levels. There are those who simply view
movies as entertainment, while others seek a
slight bit more sophistication and art in the
cinema. The President's Analyst is unquestion
ably suited to serve as mere entertainment, but
it also represents an attempt to reach those
who want meaning and expression in film.
There are a few sections that do reach this
goal, though the film as a whole could not be
mistaken for Red Desert or any other Anton
nioni product.
Still the film shows that American pictures
are moving in the right direction. Hollywood
melodramas can be seen free on television; to
day's audience hopefully wants more than that.
The President's Analyst is currently playing
at the Fox in Burlingame, Cinema Hacienda
in Sunnyvale, and Carlos in San Carlos.

James Coburn's latest film, The President's
Analyst, is a rare combination of entertain
ment and bold criticism of our society. The plot
is simple so as to provide the maximum room
for social commentary.
The film is essentially a satiric review, a
vehicle from which to attack the world around
us; we can either laugh or cry, but we are not
concerned with where we are going. Thus the
end of the movie is an abrupt stop rather than
the logical conclusion to a series of incidents.
The story concerns the need of the President
of the United States for an analyst to whom he
can confide the problems and pressures of his
office. However the chosen analyst, James Co
burn, soon learns that he himself is now in
need of an analyst. But because of the classi
fied information he has learned from the Presi
dent, he is allowed to talk to no one.
After a few weeks of constant calls to the
White House, Coburn breaks down and flees
from Washington and the world. The rest of
the movie deals with the attempts to capture
him by foreign powers, who want his top
secret information; the F.B.R. and C.R.A., who
want to kill him; and the T.P.C. (Telephone
Company), who want to use him.
The plot, however, is a mere skeleton. What
makes the film valuable and interesting are
the comments on the Negro, the New White
Liberalism, and Violence in our society. God
frey Cambridge, who plays a C.R.A. agent,
gives an eloquent and moving monologue on
growing up and learning the meaning of the
word nigger: "I ran down the street, like the
other kids, and yelled run, run here comes the
little nigger, just like they were, and then my
brother told me what a nigger was."
Later, when Coburn is trying to make his
escape, he moves in with a family whom he

met while they were touring the White House.
Coburn poses as a member of the President's
staff, concerned with finding out what the av
erage American thinks. While Coburn talks
with the husband, who thinks that "those damn
flag - waving, right - wing fascists next door
should be gassed, and the young son plays
with the car gun (not to be confused with the
house gun) and listens to phone conversations
with his junior spy kit.
The film also plays upon the C.I.A. and
F. 8.1. (C.R.A. and F.B.R. in the movie).
There is a beautiful caricature of J. Edgar Hoo
ver, who is upset about Coburn's living with a
young lady and all the added expenses that
have been laid upon the American taxpayer.
