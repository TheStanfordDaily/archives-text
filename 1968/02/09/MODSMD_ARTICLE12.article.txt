Tom Lehrer once remarked to the effect that if anything
newsworthy happens in the Bay Area during baseball season,
The Chronicle probably won't be able to cover the story. Now
that the newspaper strike is wearing on in weeks, the news-car
rying capacity of either San Francisco newspaper has been, to
say the least, noticeably abbreviated. Hence the problem (ever
pressing for us "farmers") of "where to go and what to see" has
became greatly intensified. But, rest assured, through rain and
sleet and newspaper strike, The Daily is at work.
Movie fans find a Soviet Film Festival playing at the Riche
lieu Theater in San Francisco. At the Alexandria: Guess Who's
Coming to Dinner. The "modernized" version of the pre-World
War II classic, Gone With the Wind, is playing at the Golden
Gate. An improvement in color and retracking of the sound in
stereo makes this movie a heart-rending spectacular even now.
In honor of the Shakespeare Quatracentenary Year, Soviet
filmmakers have produced an all-new Hamlet which opens at
the Surf Theater on February 14 for a limited two-week engage
ment.

On stage, the American Conservatory Theater reopened its
production of Arthur Miller's The Crucible last night. The play
is directed by Allen Fletcher and General Director William
Ball. The play alternates performances with other productions
in the ACT repertoire, and full information is available at Tres
idder.
Meanwhile You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown continues at
the Little Fox Theatre (Tuesday through Friday at 8:30 and
at 7:30 and 10:00 on Saturday and two Sunday matinees). One
shouldn't miss this; with touring companies in New York, Bos
ton, San Francisco, and now London, the musical has been
acclaimed by that European capital as one of America's best.

Back in the big city, the New York smash, Wait a Minim!
opened at the Curran last Monday for a three-week stay—per
formances at 8:30. The West Coast cast contains some of the
original South African troupe; the show is one of the funniest
spoofs of race relations in South Africa pointing out, at least
as far as the South Africans are concerned, that house cleaning
begins at home.
And finally, here on the Farm: Übu Rex by Alfred Jerry pre
sented by the Speech and Drama Department tonight and to
morrow at 8:30 at the Little Theater. The director is Roger
Pierce.

Musically, the San Francisco Symphony will present a Ros
sini Memorial Concert at the Opera House tomorrow night at
8:30. Next Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday finds Seiji Ozawa
directing the symphony, a trial run before he takes over the
baton from Maestro Krips in 1970.
The Juilliard String Quartet will offer a recital at the Uni
versity of Santa Clara on Monday evening at 8:30. Jos£ Greco
is at the San Jose Civic Auditorium one week from toni?* 1 * at
8:30.
Finally, a recording worth noting: London's new release of
Nicolai Ghiaurov in highlights of Boito's Mefistofele, recently
acclaimed as one of the finest examples of stereophonic sound
ever cut.
