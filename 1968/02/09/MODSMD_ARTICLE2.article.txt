Where is the political right at Stanford?
Sitting around the fire listening to
William Rusher of the National Re
view indulge in reminiscence over past ma
neuverings of The Syndicate which controls
the national YR's. Sponsoring speeches on the
cold war as Armageddon by Stefan Possony of
Hoover Tower. Attending ROTC drill.
Articles in the bogus issue of the Daily Work
er distributed last November on the occasion
of the 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revo
lution and in the new weekly Arena are indica
tive of the riuor mortis of the right. The same
kind of writing once provoked Richard Weaver
to say of obsession with the Red Menace: "It is
getting to be a bore to bring Communism into
every article that deals with topics of public
concern."
Despite it all, there are voices like Carl Og
lesby's which are pleading for a national reju
venation of the right. In Containment and
Change he writes, "Under one and the same
banner, joining the John Birch Society, out on
the rifle range with the Minutemen, chuck
ling through the pages of the National Re
view, the conservative right wing of imperial
ist, authoritarian, and even monarchist dispo
sition enjoys the fraternity of the libertarian
right wing of laissez faire, free market indi
vidualism. ... It would be a piece of good
fortune for America and the world if the lib
ertarian right could be reminded that besides
the debased Republicanism of the Knowlands
and the Judds there is another tradition avail
able to them—their own."
Compare Stanford's political drowsiness
with Berkeley's activism. When UC's M o is e
Tshombe Chapter of the Young Americans for
Freedom was expelled from the national or
ganization, among the "objectionable" activi
ties cited were picketing and leafleting at a
speech given by Robert Welch, opposing re
strictive laws on the use and possession of
psychedelic chemicals, and passing a resolu
tion favoring the legalization of prostitution
on free enterprise grounds. Dan Rosenthal of
Cal Conservatives for Political Action was ar
rested during the 1964 filthy speech contro
versy, held a fast protesting the "Selective
Slavery System" in the fall of 1966, and was a
member of the Strike Committee's seven-man
negotiating team during the December 1966
T.A. strike.
If some Stanford students can study the
economics of on-campus housing and teach
the administrative bureaucrats a thing or two
about the feasibility of co-educational living
groups, then some other students should study
the economics of the Bookstore, the Food Ser
vice, and the privileged status of fraternities.
The FCC
Questions could easily have been raised by
the right in conjunction with the Federal Com
munications Commission's threats to revoke
the license of KZSU. Here is another regula
tor}' agency which has been captured by those
vvas designed to regulate, in this case, by
tne radio and television networks. The works

of Gabriel Kolko, Robert Engler, and Bernard
Nossiter are full of evidence that governmen
tal activity is led by an invisible hand to pro
mote an end which was no part of its inten
tion —filling the coffers of the special interests.
What about the FCC's past efforts to impose
its standards of moral and political good
taste? (See the Center for the Study of Dem
ocratic Institutions pamphlet Trial by Battle,
by Edward Lamb.)
What about more economical ways of al
locating frequencies, ways which would be
less vulnerable to political interference? (See
R. H. Coase's article in the October 1959
Journal of Law & Economics and Robert M.
Hurt's article in the Spring 1963 New Indi
vidualist Review.)
Everyone knows the success story of Lady
Bird Johnson's radio and television stations.
The FCC's current effort to weed out the small
broadcasters benefits Big Business. As Pendle
ton Herring wrote at the conclusion of the
chapter on the Federal Radio Commission in
his Public Administration and the Public In
terest, 'Time and again our commissions have
been run by officials who are merely the pale
reflection of the very interests they are sup
posed to regulate."
American Imperialism
\Vnere are Stanford's right-wingers raising
questions about the Orwellian nightmare of
the war in Vietnam? The situation is such that
it is no wonder revisionist historian (and right
wirtger) Harry Elmer Barnes chose the book
title Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace.
In 1944, Charles E. Wilson of General Mo
tors Corporation saluted the advent of what
he called the "permanent war economy." Mili
tary expenditures were to continue after
World War II to take care of the unemploy
ment problem, which New Deal programs had
failed to solve.
The tendency of secrecy and technological
complexity to tie the Pentagon to certain "sole
source" producers led to a military-industrial
complex. The 1948 Universal Military Train
ing Act began the "channeling" of American
males into serving the "national interest" of
the Garrison State, and the classifications and
deferments of the Selective Service System are
intended to maximize utilization of manpower
resources.

Daniel Gerould's play Candaules, Commis
sioner has had a tremendous impact on the
Stanford community this winter. He calls it "a
fable for our times, a parable about what war
fare and official ideology do to human beings
—in Vietnam and other wars past and future
where great western powers forcibly defend
poor 'backward' peoples of different culture
and race in countries torn by civil war." The
good motives of "the Harvard-trained econo
mists, the hospital-builders, the decent, liberal
bureaucrats" can hardly counterbalance the
evil their welfare colonialism has done.
When America first explicitly accepted the
"white man's burden" at the close of the Span
ish-American War, right-winger William
Graham Sumner denounced it as "the con
quest of the United States by Spain": "We
have beaten Spain in a military conflict, but
we are submitting to be conquered by her on
the field of ideas and politics. Expansionism
and imperialism are nothing but the old philo
sophies which have brought Spain to where
she now is."
Now that America's youth have found the
etiology of the Vietnam war in American im
perialism, Murray Rothbard bids us recall that
"it was defeat or stalemate in imperialist war
that led directly to the Paris Commune of
1871, the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and
1917, and to the Chii.cse Revolution of the
1940'5."
Freedom of Speech
The right wing needs to question the curi
ous elitism of the New Left in deciding on be
half of the rest of the people that Dow Chemi
cal interviewers should be forcibly prevented
from recruiting on campus.
John Quirk and Dennis Hale recently of
fered these thoughts on the subject to their
fellow members of the New Left—"Those who
use Herbert Marcuse's notions of 'repressive
tolerance' to exorcise 'hang-ups about bour
geois civil liberties and middle class law and
order' do injustice to the other element of the
Marcusean dialectic: 'the closing of the uni
verse of discourse.' Speakers' bands and the
use of napalm are both by-products of a 'one
dimensional mentality.'"
It is high time for the right to offer Stan
ford and America its alternatives to corporate
liberalism and the Welfare-Warfare State.

American Imperialism
\Vnere are Stanford's right-wingers raising
questions about the Orwellian nightmare of
the war in Vietnam? The situation is such that
it is no wonder revisionist historian (and right
wirtger) Harry Elmer Barnes chose the book
title Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace.
In 1944, Charles E. Wilson of General Mo
tors Corporation saluted the advent of what
he called the "permanent war economy." Mili
tary expenditures were to continue after
World War II to take care of the unemploy
ment problem, which New Deal programs had
failed to solve.
The tendency of secrecy and technological
complexity to tie the Pentagon to certain "sole
source" producers led to a military-industrial
complex. The 1948 Universal Military Train
ing Act began the "channeling" of American
males into serving the "national interest" of
the Garrison State, and the classifications and
deferments of the Selective Service System are
intended to maximize utilization of manpower
resources.

Daniel Gerould's play Candaules, Commis
sioner has had a tremendous impact on the
Stanford community this winter. He calls it "a
fable for our times, a parable about what war
fare and official ideology do to human beings
—in Vietnam and other wars past and future
where great western powers forcibly defend
poor 'backward' peoples of different culture
and race in countries torn by civil war." The
good motives of "the Harvard-trained econo
mists, the hospital-builders, the decent, liberal
bureaucrats" can hardly counterbalance the
evil their welfare colonialism has done.
When America first explicitly accepted the
"white man's burden" at the close of the Span
ish-American War, right-winger William
Graham Sumner denounced it as "the con
quest of the United States by Spain": "We
have beaten Spain in a military conflict, but
we are submitting to be conquered by her on
the field of ideas and politics. Expansionism
and imperialism are nothing but the old philo
sophies which have brought Spain to where
she now is."
Now that America's youth have found the
etiology of the Vietnam war in American im
perialism, Murray Rothbard bids us recall that
"it was defeat or stalemate in imperialist war
that led directly to the Paris Commune of
1871, the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and
1917, and to the Chii.cse Revolution of the
1940'5."
Freedom of Speech
The right wing needs to question the curi
ous elitism of the New Left in deciding on be
half of the rest of the people that Dow Chemi
cal interviewers should be forcibly prevented
from recruiting on campus.
John Quirk and Dennis Hale recently of
fered these thoughts on the subject to their
fellow members of the New Left—"Those who
use Herbert Marcuse's notions of 'repressive
tolerance' to exorcise 'hang-ups about bour
geois civil liberties and middle class law and
order' do injustice to the other element of the
Marcusean dialectic: 'the closing of the uni
verse of discourse.' Speakers' bands and the
use of napalm are both by-products of a 'one
dimensional mentality.'"
It is high time for the right to offer Stan
ford and America its alternatives to corporate
liberalism and the Welfare-Warfare State.


Where is the political right at Stanford?
Sitting around the fire listening to
William Rusher of the National Re
view indulge in reminiscence over past ma
neuverings of The Syndicate which controls
the national YR's. Sponsoring speeches on the
cold war as Armageddon by Stefan Possony of
Hoover Tower. Attending ROTC drill.
Articles in the bogus issue of the Daily Work
er distributed last November on the occasion
of the 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revo
lution and in the new weekly Arena are indica
tive of the riuor mortis of the right. The same
kind of writing once provoked Richard Weaver
to say of obsession with the Red Menace: "It is
getting to be a bore to bring Communism into
every article that deals with topics of public
concern."
Despite it all, there are voices like Carl Og
lesby's which are pleading for a national reju
venation of the right. In Containment and
Change he writes, "Under one and the same
banner, joining the John Birch Society, out on
the rifle range with the Minutemen, chuck
ling through the pages of the National Re
view, the conservative right wing of imperial
ist, authoritarian, and even monarchist dispo
sition enjoys the fraternity of the libertarian
right wing of laissez faire, free market indi
vidualism. ... It would be a piece of good
fortune for America and the world if the lib
ertarian right could be reminded that besides
the debased Republicanism of the Knowlands
and the Judds there is another tradition avail
able to them—their own."
Compare Stanford's political drowsiness

Tshombe Chapter of the Young Americans for
Freedom was expelled from the national or

speech given by Robert Welch, opposing re
strictive laws on the use and possession of
psychedelic chemicals, and passing a resolu

on free enterprise grounds. Dan Rosenthal of
Cal Conservatives for Political Action was ar

Now that America's youth have found the

Freedom of Speech
The right wing needs to question the curi
ous elitism of the New Left in deciding on be
half of the rest of the people that Dow Chemi
cal interviewers should be forcibly prevented
from recruiting on campus.
John Quirk and Dennis Hale recently of
fered these thoughts on the subject to their
fellow members of the New Left—"Those who
use Herbert Marcuse's notions of 'repressive
tolerance' to exorcise 'hang-ups about bour
geois civil liberties and middle class law and
order' do injustice to the other element of the
Marcusean dialectic: 'the closing of the uni
verse of discourse.' Speakers' bands and the
use of napalm are both by-products of a 'one
dimensional mentality.'"
It is high time for the right to offer Stan

liberalism and the Welfare-Warfare State.


Where is the political right at Stanford?
Sitting around the fire listening to
William Rusher of the National Re
view indulge in reminiscence over past ma
neuverings of The Syndicate which controls
the national YR's. Sponsoring speeches on the
cold war as Armageddon by Stefan Possony of
Hoover Tower. Attending ROTC drill.
Articles in the bogus issue of the Daily Work
er distributed last November on the occasion
of the 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revo
lution and in the new weekly Arena are indica
tive of the riuor mortis of the right. The same
kind of writing once provoked Richard Weaver
to say of obsession with the Red Menace: "It is
getting to be a bore to bring Communism into
every article that deals with topics of public
concern."
Despite it all, there are voices like Carl Og
lesby's which are pleading for a national reju
venation of the right. In Containment and
Change he writes, "Under one and the same
banner, joining the John Birch Society, out on
the rifle range with the Minutemen, chuck
ling through the pages of the National Re
view, the conservative right wing of imperial
ist, authoritarian, and even monarchist dispo
sition enjoys the fraternity of the libertarian
right wing of laissez faire, free market indi
vidualism. ... It would be a piece of good
fortune for America and the world if the lib
ertarian right could be reminded that besides
the debased Republicanism of the Knowlands
and the Judds there is another tradition avail
able to them—their own."
Compare Stanford's political drowsiness
with Berkeley's activism. When UC's M o is e
Tshombe Chapter of the Young Americans for
Freedom was expelled from the national or
ganization, among the "objectionable" activi
ties cited were picketing and leafleting at a
speech given by Robert Welch, opposing re
strictive laws on the use and possession of
psychedelic chemicals, and passing a resolu
tion favoring the legalization of prostitution
on free enterprise grounds. Dan Rosenthal of
Cal Conservatives for Political Action was ar
rested during the 1964 filthy speech contro
versy, held a fast protesting the "Selective
Slavery System" in the fall of 1966, and was a
member of the Strike Committee's seven-man
negotiating team during the December 1966
T.A. strike.
If some Stanford students can study the

The FCC
Questions could easily have been raised by
the right in conjunction with the Federal Com

the license of KZSU. Here is another regula
tor}' agency which has been captured by those
vvas designed to regulate, in this case, by

Nossiter are full of evidence that governmen
tal activity is led by an invisible hand to pro

What about the FCC's past efforts to impose
its standards of moral and political good
taste? (See the Center for the Study of Dem

by Edward Lamb.)
What about more economical ways of al
locating frequencies, ways which would be
less vulnerable to political interference? (See
R. H. Coase's article in the October 1959
Journal of Law & Economics and Robert M.
Hurt's article in the Spring 1963 New Indi

Everyone knows the success story of Lady

The FCC's current effort to weed out the small

American Imperialism
\Vnere are Stanford's right-wingers raising

it is no wonder revisionist historian (and right

In 1944, Charles E. Wilson of General Mo

he called the "permanent war economy." Mili

World War II to take care of the unemploy

failed to solve.
The tendency of secrecy and technological
complexity to tie the Pentagon to certain "sole
source" producers led to a military-industrial
complex. The 1948 Universal Military Train
ing Act began the "channeling" of American
males into serving the "national interest" of
the Garrison State, and the classifications and
deferments of the Selective Service System are
intended to maximize utilization of manpower
resources.

Daniel Gerould's play Candaules, Commis

fable for our times, a parable about what war
fare and official ideology do to human beings

where great western powers forcibly defend
poor 'backward' peoples of different culture
and race in countries torn by civil war." The
good motives of "the Harvard-trained econo

bureaucrats" can hardly counterbalance the
evil their welfare colonialism has done.

the debased Republicanism of the Knowlands
and the Judds there is another tradition avail
able to them—their own."
Compare Stanford's political drowsiness
with Berkeley's activism. When UC's M o is e
Tshombe Chapter of the Young Americans for
Freedom was expelled from the national or
ganization, among the "objectionable" activi
ties cited were picketing and leafleting at a
speech given by Robert Welch, opposing re
strictive laws on the use and possession of
psychedelic chemicals, and passing a resolu
tion favoring the legalization of prostitution
on free enterprise grounds. Dan Rosenthal of
Cal Conservatives for Political Action was ar
rested during the 1964 filthy speech contro
versy, held a fast protesting the "Selective
Slavery System" in the fall of 1966, and was a
member of the Strike Committee's seven-man
negotiating team during the December 1966
T.A. strike.
If some Stanford students can study the
economics of on-campus housing and teach
the administrative bureaucrats a thing or two
about the feasibility of co-educational living
groups, then some other students should study
the economics of the Bookstore, the Food Ser
vice, and the privileged status of fraternities.
The FCC
Questions could easily have been raised by
the right in conjunction with the Federal Com
munications Commission's threats to revoke
the license of KZSU. Here is another regula
tor}' agency which has been captured by those
vvas designed to regulate, in this case, by
tne radio and television networks. The works

of Gabriel Kolko, Robert Engler, and Bernard
Nossiter are full of evidence that governmen
tal activity is led by an invisible hand to pro
mote an end which was no part of its inten
tion —filling the coffers of the special interests.
What about the FCC's past efforts to impose
its standards of moral and political good
taste? (See the Center for the Study of Dem
ocratic Institutions pamphlet Trial by Battle,
by Edward Lamb.)
What about more economical ways of al
locating frequencies, ways which would be
less vulnerable to political interference? (See
R. H. Coase's article in the October 1959
Journal of Law & Economics and Robert M.
Hurt's article in the Spring 1963 New Indi
vidualist Review.)
Everyone knows the success story of Lady
Bird Johnson's radio and television stations.
The FCC's current effort to weed out the small
broadcasters benefits Big Business. As Pendle
ton Herring wrote at the conclusion of the
chapter on the Federal Radio Commission in
his Public Administration and the Public In
terest, 'Time and again our commissions have
been run by officials who are merely the pale
reflection of the very interests they are sup
posed to regulate."
American Imperialism
\Vnere are Stanford's right-wingers raising
questions about the Orwellian nightmare of
the war in Vietnam? The situation is such that
it is no wonder revisionist historian (and right
wirtger) Harry Elmer Barnes chose the book
title Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace.
In 1944, Charles E. Wilson of General Mo
tors Corporation saluted the advent of what
he called the "permanent war economy." Mili
tary expenditures were to continue after
World War II to take care of the unemploy
ment problem, which New Deal programs had
failed to solve.
The tendency of secrecy and technological
complexity to tie the Pentagon to certain "sole
source" producers led to a military-industrial
complex. The 1948 Universal Military Train
ing Act began the "channeling" of American
males into serving the "national interest" of
the Garrison State, and the classifications and
deferments of the Selective Service System are
intended to maximize utilization of manpower
resources.

Daniel Gerould's play Candaules, Commis
sioner has had a tremendous impact on the
Stanford community this winter. He calls it "a
fable for our times, a parable about what war
fare and official ideology do to human beings
—in Vietnam and other wars past and future
where great western powers forcibly defend
poor 'backward' peoples of different culture
and race in countries torn by civil war." The
good motives of "the Harvard-trained econo
mists, the hospital-builders, the decent, liberal
bureaucrats" can hardly counterbalance the
evil their welfare colonialism has done.
When America first explicitly accepted the
"white man's burden" at the close of the Span
ish-American War, right-winger William
Graham Sumner denounced it as "the con
quest of the United States by Spain": "We
have beaten Spain in a military conflict, but
we are submitting to be conquered by her on
the field of ideas and politics. Expansionism
and imperialism are nothing but the old philo
sophies which have brought Spain to where
she now is."
Now that America's youth have found the
etiology of the Vietnam war in American im
perialism, Murray Rothbard bids us recall that
"it was defeat or stalemate in imperialist war
that led directly to the Paris Commune of
1871, the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and
1917, and to the Chii.cse Revolution of the
1940'5."
Freedom of Speech
The right wing needs to question the curi
ous elitism of the New Left in deciding on be
half of the rest of the people that Dow Chemi
cal interviewers should be forcibly prevented
from recruiting on campus.
John Quirk and Dennis Hale recently of
fered these thoughts on the subject to their
fellow members of the New Left—"Those who
use Herbert Marcuse's notions of 'repressive
tolerance' to exorcise 'hang-ups about bour
geois civil liberties and middle class law and
order' do injustice to the other element of the
Marcusean dialectic: 'the closing of the uni
verse of discourse.' Speakers' bands and the
use of napalm are both by-products of a 'one
dimensional mentality.'"
It is high time for the right to offer Stan
ford and America its alternatives to corporate
liberalism and the Welfare-Warfare State.


Where is the political right at Stanford?
Sitting around the fire listening to
William Rusher of the National Re
view indulge in reminiscence over past ma
neuverings of The Syndicate which controls
the national YR's. Sponsoring speeches on the
cold war as Armageddon by Stefan Possony of
Hoover Tower. Attending ROTC drill.
Articles in the bogus issue of the Daily Work
er distributed last November on the occasion
of the 50th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revo
lution and in the new weekly Arena are indica
tive of the riuor mortis of the right. The same
kind of writing once provoked Richard Weaver
to say of obsession with the Red Menace: "It is
getting to be a bore to bring Communism into
every article that deals with topics of public
concern."
Despite it all, there are voices like Carl Og
lesby's which are pleading for a national reju
venation of the right. In Containment and
Change he writes, "Under one and the same
banner, joining the John Birch Society, out on
the rifle range with the Minutemen, chuck
ling through the pages of the National Re
view, the conservative right wing of imperial
ist, authoritarian, and even monarchist dispo
sition enjoys the fraternity of the libertarian
right wing of laissez faire, free market indi
vidualism. ... It would be a piece of good
fortune for America and the world if the lib
ertarian right could be reminded that besides
the debased Republicanism of the Knowlands
and the Judds there is another tradition avail
able to them—their own."
