Two weeks ago, Paul E. Richards, a
Stanford Repertory Theater actor and
a lecturer in the Speech and Drama De
partment, learned he would not be retained
at Stanford after this June. This information
was contained in a letter from Wendell Cole,
acting executive head of the department.
Gerrdd Hiken, also a S.R.T. actor and de
p ii trnent lecturer, had previously told Cole
that he would not remain at Stanford after
June of R ; chards were released. Following the
notice to Richards, Hiken promptly resigned.
Subsequent reports of these matters and
discussions of their implications which ap
peared in The Daily and the Palo Alto Times
under such labels as "Controversy," "Crisis,"
and "Discord" have—as the cliche goes—
generated more heat than light. This is an
attempt to make a less impassioned statement
of the case.
o e o
There are two reasons why Richards was
released. One is artistic-curricular, the other
financial.
During the past quarter, there has been a
good deal of discussion among the depart
ment's faculty and students and Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences Robert Sears about pos
sible changes which could be made in the
curriculum. One of the things which students
in the Master of Fine Arts acting program
have suggested is that the department provide
additional instruction in acting approaches
other than the psychological one espoused by
both Richards and Hiken. Alternative meth
ods would presumably place far more empha
sis on the acquisition of "technical" skills, e.g.
vocal and bodily control, and possibly an
acquaintance with period acting styles.
Dr. Cole pointed out one of the main dif
ficulties attendant on the task of attempting
to establish an acting company in a university
situation. Acknowledging that "producing
companies are usually the product of one per
son, or at least one idea," he went on to note
that "the task of teaching is different than
that of establishing an ensemble.
"It doesn't seem to me," he remarked, "that
a single point of view has a place in a uni
versity," and that adhering to one "would
make for a bad department."
Certainly this is the case. Prospective actors,
like other graduate students, are generally
young and quite inexperienced, and it is not
possible for them to choose how to function
as artists—any more than it is possible for
students in other fields to decide how to func
tion as scholars or technicians until they have
been exposed to a variety of possibilities.
The main goal should be to equip actors to
handle the multiplicity of tasks which they
will be called upon to perform in their pro
fession. If an actor becomes convinced that

a certain approach to those tasks is best, he
can find ample opportunity to master it; but
he is entitled to no such conviction until he
has had adequate contact with alternatives.
Besides the foregoing artistic-curricular
considerations, the university and other de
partmental financing affected the decision to
terminate Richards. Due to a cutback in fed
oral funds, budget restraints will operate in
the entire university next year. In addition,
almost all of the Rockefeller grant which pro
vided a large part of the Repertory Theater's
capital has been expended. As a result, the
number of artist-teachers on the drama faculty
will be reduced, and those hired will carry
heavier, more diversified teaching loads.
In the Palo Alto Times Paul Emerson's cov
erage of this sequence of events placed un
warranted emphasis on the possibility that
these incidents will effectively conclude Stan
ford's efforts to bring professional and aca
demic theater into a mutually beneficial prox
imity.
In the February 2 Times Emerson quotes
Richards' description of his dismissal as "the
triumph of the tenures," implying that the de
partment's established faculty was opposed to
(or as Richards put it, "afraid" of) involve
ment with professional theater people. To pos
it such a dichotomy is a misrepresentation of
fact, since two of the department's tenured
faculty are, as members of the New York De
signer's Union, themselves professionals.
More importantly, such opposition and/or
fear is not really in evidence. Dr. Cole assures
that there has been "no change in the inten
tion of bringing academic and professional
theater together."
The repertory theater project is an experi
ment. As such, its outcome is an unknown,
and may well not conform to anyone's expec
tations. Those who would properly evaluate
the "data" it is gradually yielding, must, as
good researcher do, cultivate patience and
perspective.
Theater has been a curricular subject in uni
versities only for about fifty years, and its
place is not yet certain. The radical extension
of that curriculum to include professional pro
ductions, which was pioneered at Stanford
only three years ago, is deserving of a far
more extended hearing than it has thus far
received.
It now seems that S.R.T. began prematurely,
and that full-scale repertory will not be seen
on this campus again, if ever, until, among
other things, a new theater building is con
structed. If the university is willing to learn
by its mistakes, however, it quite possibly
could continue to lead in the area of educa
tional theater.
The idea of mingling professional and aca
demic theater remains a challenging one.
Challenging ideas are never easy to live with.
If the notion does not mature at Stanford, it
may do so at one of the other universities
which have followed Stanford's lead.
In any case, reports of its death are greatly
exaggerated.

many Stanford Repertory Theater's productions.

be leaving Stanford in June.
