A STARVING, toothless soldier crams mud and
stones into his mouth, and a little dog trots
smugly across the street with a human hand be
tween its jaws.
These are two scenes from this quarter's Japanese
Film Festival, sponsored by the Keio Committee of
Stanford. Featuring eight films by six leading directors,
the series displays the variety and vitality of contem
porary Japanese movies, ranging from fairy tale to doc
umentary and illustrating the major division of the
industry into modern and period films. Three films have
already been shown in this festival of Japanese film
masterpieces, with five remaining.
As in America, the majority of Japanese period films
cater to an audience that seeks nothing in art but its
own sentimental and pseudo-historical myths: the ori
ental equivalent to a Steve Reeves epic or a Gone With
the Wind (the latter a recent hit on the Tokyo stage),
or, of course, the samurai version of our Western shoot
'em-up.
Tonight's film, considered by some to be the ultimate
samurai movie, is at the same time a brilliant parody
of the cheap popular myth from which it springs. What
Bonnie and Clyde does for the gangster movie, Akira
Kurosawa's Yoj'imbo does to the traditional sword-fight
film, exploiting to the fullest all its violence and stock
thrills while deflating its romantic notions of heroism
and the simple-minded morality of good-guys versus
bad-guys.
Into the stock situation strolls the stock hero, a ruth
less sword-slinger for hire (played by Toshiro Mifune),
whose services are sought by the two hostile factions
seeking to ruin this worthless little town. But our hero
is different, a man completely devoid of idealism or
devotion to fair play—otherwise he wouldn't last long
in this comically corrupt village, where both sides are
equally detestable and where man's best friend is more
than glad to eat the hand that feeds him.
Master of the fast draw and the even faster double
cross, Mifune decides to amuse himself and earn a
few yen by helping both sets of bad guys to annihilate
each other, while he looks on from a safe distance. Yet
despite the movie's blatant anarchism, Mifune's cheer
ful amorality and the swaggering vitality with which
he goes about his bloody tasks enables the viewer to
adopt a comic attitude toward the corrupt world and
all that violence. Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, who are
destroyed because they cannot escape their own myth,
the hero of Yojimbo triumphs because he has no illu
sions about himself or the world.
Where Yojimbo explodes false myths by the comedy
of farce, The Bailiff (Jan. 19) and Ugetsu (Feb. 23),
two period films of Kenji Mizoguchi, use more subtle
means to reveal the gap between cruel reality and the
noble ambitions and illusory trimphs of mankind. Mizo
guchi's blend of dream-like atmospheres and brutal
realism, recalling his training as a painter, is perfectly
appropriate to the bitter-sweet tone of his films, in
which romantic legends of the past are ironically re
lated to the historical reality of the present.
The Bailiff explores a conflict between humanitarian




Toshiro Mifune (shown in top and center pictures) stars in tonight's classic
mmuri film, Yojimbo, directed by Akira Kurosawa. The Venice Film Festival
winner, Uactsu (bottom), will be shown February 23.
