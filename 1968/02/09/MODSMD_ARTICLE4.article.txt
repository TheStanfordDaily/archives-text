# JAPANESE FILM SERIES

A STARVING, toothless soldier crams mud and
stones into his mouth, and a little dog trots
smugly across the street with a human hand be
tween its jaws.
These are two scenes from this quarter's Japanese
Film Festival, sponsored by the Keio Committee of
Stanford. Featuring eight films by six leading directors,
the series displays the variety and vitality of contem
porary Japanese movies, ranging from fairy tale to doc
umentary and illustrating the major division of the
industry into modern and period films. Three films have
already been shown in this festival of Japanese film
masterpieces, with five remaining.
As in America, the majority of Japanese period films
cater to an audience that seeks nothing in art but its
own sentimental and pseudo-historical myths: the ori
ental equivalent to a Steve Reeves epic or a Gone With
the Wind (the latter a recent hit on the Tokyo stage),
or, of course, the samurai version of our Western shoot
'em-up.
Tonight's film, considered by some to be the ultimate
samurai movie, is at the same time a brilliant parody
of the cheap popular myth from which it springs. What
Bonnie and Clyde does for the gangster movie, Akira
Kurosawa's Yoj'imbo does to the traditional sword-fight
film, exploiting to the fullest all its violence and stock
thrills while deflating its romantic notions of heroism
and the simple-minded morality of good-guys versus
bad-guys.
Into the stock situation strolls the stock hero, a ruth
less sword-slinger for hire (played by Toshiro Mifune),
whose services are sought by the two hostile factions
seeking to ruin this worthless little town. But our hero
is different, a man completely devoid of idealism or
devotion to fair play—otherwise he wouldn't last long
in this comically corrupt village, where both sides are
equally detestable and where man's best friend is more
than glad to eat the hand that feeds him.
Master of the fast draw and the even faster double
cross, Mifune decides to amuse himself and earn a
few yen by helping both sets of bad guys to annihilate
each other, while he looks on from a safe distance. Yet
despite the movie's blatant anarchism, Mifune's cheer
ful amorality and the swaggering vitality with which
he goes about his bloody tasks enables the viewer to
adopt a comic attitude toward the corrupt world and
all that violence. Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, who are
destroyed because they cannot escape their own myth,
the hero of Yojimbo triumphs because he has no illu
sions about himself or the world.
Where Yojimbo explodes false myths by the comedy
of farce, The Bailiff (Jan. 19) and Ugetsu (Feb. 23),
two period films of Kenji Mizoguchi, use more subtle
means to reveal the gap between cruel reality and the
noble ambitions and illusory trimphs of mankind. Mizo
guchi's blend of dream-like atmospheres and brutal
realism, recalling his training as a painter, is perfectly
appropriate to the bitter-sweet tone of his films, in
which romantic legends of the past are ironically re
lated to the historical reality of the present.
The Bailiff explores a conflict between humanitarian

winner, Uactsu (bottom), will be shown February 23.
ethics and the old feudal order.
Virtue seems to triumph when the
young hero liberates the slaves and
quixotically resigns his post as gov
ernor, but the only result of these
acts is a slave rebellion which he is
powerless to control. Likewise, the
long - awaited reunion with his
mother at the film's end is undercut
by her blindness and refusal to rec
ognize him.
In Ugetsu, a beautiful film which
has been read as a fable of modern
Japan, two peasant neighbors aban
don family and tradition to go in
search of wealth and military glory.
Their triumphs are short-lived and
at great cost; the only answer, it
seems, is to return home and re
sume, with resignation, the old
tasks. In the morality play struggle
between phantom princess and the
potter's wife, Mizoguchi sides with
the redeeming love of the real
woman, though she too, we learn,
is a spirit returned from the dead.
Tadashi Imai in his
film, Portraits of Shame (March 1),
more popularly referred to as
Muddy Waters, departs from his
usual protest theme to depict in a
very warm humanistic fashion the
plight of women of feudal Japan.
The players of the Bungaku Za, dis
tinguished Tokyo repertory com
pany, enact three stories set in the
early 1800's.
The first is that of an unhappy
young woman enmeshed in the feu
dal family order. The next is an in
cident in the life of an impoverished
servant girl, taking place on the

last day of the year (traditional for
settling all debts in Japan). The
last, set in a brothel, recounts the
pitiful story of a geisha and ends in
tragic violence. So effective has
Imai been in his portrayal that the
Japanese Press Critics gave Por
traits of Shame their unanimous
vote as "Best Film of the Year" in
1956.

THE modern films focus on
different aspects of the limits
of man's existence. Ozu's
Drifting Weeds (Jan. 12) centers
on the relation between an individ
ual and his society; The Island
(Feb. 16) by Kaneto Shindo shows
man's intimate relation to nature;
Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain asks
how far man can push himself.
Drifting Weeds is the most tra
ditional of these films and the most
revealing of Japanese social insti
tutions: Ozu is considered by his
countrymen "the most Japanese of
all directors," probably because of
his direct and intentionally simple
style. There are no fades, no fast
cuts, very little plot development.
The camera stays put after it has
set the scene, which is usually an
interior with people talking, pho
tographed straight-in at eye level.
Not a manipulator or impresario,
Ozu's camera is a modest host, in
viting you to come in and be an ob
servant visitor of the ebb and flow
of life.
The Drifting Weeds of this film
are the lives of a troupe of actors.

Ozu's point is that life is too fragile
to hold on to. At the film's end, the
main character must resign himself
to his wandering life, to being alone
in the midst of troupes and audi
ence. He rejects conflict, accepts
chaos and the transience of his
happiness. This is a typical Ozu
ending; and it has also been a clas
sic Japanese aesthetic theme —
mono no aware, sensitivity to our
smallness, satisfaction in the natu
ral changes of life.
Shindo's masterpiece The Island
is also mono no aware. It shows
how nature flows into the lives of a
farming family, the sole inhabitants
of a small island, how it shapes and
molds them. What nature says to
man counts, not what man says:
here is no dialogue in the film. Nat
ural sounds, occasional sobbing or
laughing, a subtle musical score ac
company the rhythms of the fam
ily's labor for survival. When one of
her sons dies, the woman is immo
bilized with grief and frustration.
But this can only be short-lived;
work must go on for the oth
ers. This exquisitely photographed
movie shows nature gently and
beautifully; but we feel its power,
and our small dependence.
Fires on the Plain (Jan. 26) fo
cuses on the limits of human beha
vior and the questionable border
line between man and beast. The
main character, Tamura, is one of
the stragglers of the disintegrating
Japanese army in the Philippines.
Faced with starvation but afraid to
surrender, the soldiers march on

until they fall dead in the mud.
Reduced to nothing but their in
stinct for survival, they resort finally
to cannibalism.
Tamura alone refuses to become
a beast of prey. Even at the edge of
death, he clings to his humanity
and takes a moral stand: he will not
eat human flesh. But he owes his
own existence to a cruel irony. The
others do not eat him, for the simple
reason that he has tuberculosis. The
question thus becomes wnether, in
a world like this, morality is a sick
ness.
The distinguishing feature of
these Japanese films is what might
be called the honest camera. With
out resorting to overly sophisticated
or experimental photographic tech
niques, the best Japanese directors
have tried to examine their world
with a quiet intensity that tran
scends facile solutions. Neither op
timistic nor pessimitic, their films
have in common a peculiarly Japa
nese note of resignation —an ac
ceptance of man's small place in the
total scheme of nature, recalling
Hokusai's tiny, kimono-clad figures
hovering at the foot of a majestic,
snow-capped Mount Fuji.
(Tokyo Olympiad, scheduled
for March 8, may not be available
for showing on that date. If the dis
tributor is unable to supply it, an
other film will be shown as a re
placement—Akira Kurosawa's mas
terful and imaginative transposi
tion to early 19th century Japan of
Gorky's Russian classic, The Lower
Depths, starring Toshiro Mifune.)

The influence of nature on
mens lives is the theme of The
Island, directed by Kaneto Shindo.
Starring Nobuko Otowa and Taiji
Tonoyama (shown at right), the
film will be shown February 16.

THE modern films focus on
different aspects of the limits
of man's existence. Ozu's
Drifting Weeds (Jan. 12) centers
on the relation between an individ
ual and his society; The Island
(Feb. 16) by Kaneto Shindo shows
man's intimate relation to nature;
Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain asks
how far man can push himself.
Drifting Weeds is the most tra
ditional of these films and the most
revealing of Japanese social insti
tutions: Ozu is considered by his
countrymen "the most Japanese of
all directors," probably because of
his direct and intentionally simple
style. There are no fades, no fast
cuts, very little plot development.
The camera stays put after it has
set the scene, which is usually an
interior with people talking, pho
tographed straight-in at eye level.
Not a manipulator or impresario,
Ozu's camera is a modest host, in
viting you to come in and be an ob
servant visitor of the ebb and flow
of life.
The Drifting Weeds of this film
are the lives of a troupe of actors.

Ozu's point is that life is too fragile
to hold on to. At the film's end, the
main character must resign himself
to his wandering life, to being alone
in the midst of troupes and audi
ence. He rejects conflict, accepts
chaos and the transience of his
happiness. This is a typical Ozu
ending; and it has also been a clas
sic Japanese aesthetic theme —
mono no aware, sensitivity to our
smallness, satisfaction in the natu
ral changes of life.
Shindo's masterpiece The Island
is also mono no aware. It shows
how nature flows into the lives of a
farming family, the sole inhabitants
of a small island, how it shapes and
molds them. What nature says to
man counts, not what man says:
here is no dialogue in the film. Nat
ural sounds, occasional sobbing or
laughing, a subtle musical score ac
company the rhythms of the fam
ily's labor for survival. When one of
her sons dies, the woman is immo
bilized with grief and frustration.
But this can only be short-lived;
work must go on for the oth
ers. This exquisitely photographed
movie shows nature gently and
beautifully; but we feel its power,
and our small dependence.
Fires on the Plain (Jan. 26) fo
cuses on the limits of human beha
vior and the questionable border
line between man and beast. The
main character, Tamura, is one of
the stragglers of the disintegrating
Japanese army in the Philippines.
Faced with starvation but afraid to
surrender, the soldiers march on

until they fall dead in the mud.
Reduced to nothing but their in
stinct for survival, they resort finally
to cannibalism.
Tamura alone refuses to become
a beast of prey. Even at the edge of
death, he clings to his humanity
and takes a moral stand: he will not
eat human flesh. But he owes his
own existence to a cruel irony. The
others do not eat him, for the simple
reason that he has tuberculosis. The
question thus becomes wnether, in
a world like this, morality is a sick
ness.
The distinguishing feature of
these Japanese films is what might
be called the honest camera. With
out resorting to overly sophisticated
or experimental photographic tech
niques, the best Japanese directors
have tried to examine their world
with a quiet intensity that tran
scends facile solutions. Neither op
timistic nor pessimitic, their films
have in common a peculiarly Japa
nese note of resignation —an ac
ceptance of man's small place in the
total scheme of nature, recalling
Hokusai's tiny, kimono-clad figures
hovering at the foot of a majestic,
snow-capped Mount Fuji.

A STARVING, toothless soldier crams mud and
stones into his mouth, and a little dog trots
smugly across the street with a human hand be
tween its jaws.
These are two scenes from this quarter's Japanese
Film Festival, sponsored by the Keio Committee of
Stanford. Featuring eight films by six leading directors,
the series displays the variety and vitality of contem
porary Japanese movies, ranging from fairy tale to doc
umentary and illustrating the major division of the
industry into modern and period films. Three films have
already been shown in this festival of Japanese film
masterpieces, with five remaining.
As in America, the majority of Japanese period films
cater to an audience that seeks nothing in art but its
own sentimental and pseudo-historical myths: the ori
ental equivalent to a Steve Reeves epic or a Gone With
the Wind (the latter a recent hit on the Tokyo stage),
or, of course, the samurai version of our Western shoot
'em-up.
Tonight's film, considered by some to be the ultimate
samurai movie, is at the same time a brilliant parody
of the cheap popular myth from which it springs. What
Bonnie and Clyde does for the gangster movie, Akira
Kurosawa's Yoj'imbo does to the traditional sword-fight
film, exploiting to the fullest all its violence and stock
thrills while deflating its romantic notions of heroism
and the simple-minded morality of good-guys versus
bad-guys.
Into the stock situation strolls the stock hero, a ruth
less sword-slinger for hire (played by Toshiro Mifune),
whose services are sought by the two hostile factions
seeking to ruin this worthless little town. But our hero
is different, a man completely devoid of idealism or
devotion to fair play—otherwise he wouldn't last long
in this comically corrupt village, where both sides are
equally detestable and where man's best friend is more
than glad to eat the hand that feeds him.
Master of the fast draw and the even faster double
cross, Mifune decides to amuse himself and earn a
few yen by helping both sets of bad guys to annihilate
each other, while he looks on from a safe distance. Yet
despite the movie's blatant anarchism, Mifune's cheer
ful amorality and the swaggering vitality with which
he goes about his bloody tasks enables the viewer to
adopt a comic attitude toward the corrupt world and
all that violence. Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, who are
destroyed because they cannot escape their own myth,
the hero of Yojimbo triumphs because he has no illu
sions about himself or the world.
Where Yojimbo explodes false myths by the comedy
of farce, The Bailiff (Jan. 19) and Ugetsu (Feb. 23),
two period films of Kenji Mizoguchi, use more subtle
means to reveal the gap between cruel reality and the
noble ambitions and illusory trimphs of mankind. Mizo
guchi's blend of dream-like atmospheres and brutal
realism, recalling his training as a painter, is perfectly
appropriate to the bitter-sweet tone of his films, in
which romantic legends of the past are ironically re
lated to the historical reality of the present.

Ozu's camera is a modest host, in
viting you to come in and be an ob
servant visitor of the ebb and flow
of life.
The Drifting Weeds of this film
are the lives of a troupe of actors.

Ozu's point is that life is too fragile
to hold on to. At the film's end, the
main character must resign himself
to his wandering life, to being alone
in the midst of troupes and audi
ence. He rejects conflict, accepts
chaos and the transience of his
happiness. This is a typical Ozu
ending; and it has also been a clas
sic Japanese aesthetic theme —
mono no aware, sensitivity to our
smallness, satisfaction in the natu
ral changes of life.
Shindo's masterpiece The Island
is also mono no aware. It shows
how nature flows into the lives of a
farming family, the sole inhabitants
of a small island, how it shapes and
molds them. What nature says to
man counts, not what man says:
here is no dialogue in the film. Nat
ural sounds, occasional sobbing or
laughing, a subtle musical score ac
company the rhythms of the fam
ily's labor for survival. When one of
her sons dies, the woman is immo
bilized with grief and frustration.
But this can only be short-lived;
work must go on for the oth
ers. This exquisitely photographed
movie shows nature gently and
beautifully; but we feel its power,
and our small dependence.
Fires on the Plain (Jan. 26) fo
cuses on the limits of human beha
vior and the questionable border
line between man and beast. The
main character, Tamura, is one of
the stragglers of the disintegrating
Japanese army in the Philippines.
Faced with starvation but afraid to
surrender, the soldiers march on

until they fall dead in the mud.
Reduced to nothing but their in
stinct for survival, they resort finally
to cannibalism.
Tamura alone refuses to become
a beast of prey. Even at the edge of
death, he clings to his humanity
and takes a moral stand: he will not
eat human flesh. But he owes his
own existence to a cruel irony. The
others do not eat him, for the simple
reason that he has tuberculosis. The
question thus becomes wnether, in
a world like this, morality is a sick
ness.
The distinguishing feature of
these Japanese films is what might
be called the honest camera. With
out resorting to overly sophisticated
or experimental photographic tech
niques, the best Japanese directors
have tried to examine their world
with a quiet intensity that tran
scends facile solutions. Neither op
timistic nor pessimitic, their films
have in common a peculiarly Japa
nese note of resignation —an ac
ceptance of man's small place in the
total scheme of nature, recalling
Hokusai's tiny, kimono-clad figures
hovering at the foot of a majestic,
snow-capped Mount Fuji.

A STARVING, toothless soldier crams mud and

smugly across the street with a human hand be
tween its jaws.
These are two scenes from this quarter's Japanese
Film Festival, sponsored by the Keio Committee of
Stanford. Featuring eight films by six leading directors,
the series displays the variety and vitality of contem
porary Japanese movies, ranging from fairy tale to doc
umentary and illustrating the major division of the
industry into modern and period films. Three films have
already been shown in this festival of Japanese film
masterpieces, with five remaining.
As in America, the majority of Japanese period films
cater to an audience that seeks nothing in art but its
own sentimental and pseudo-historical myths: the ori
ental equivalent to a Steve Reeves epic or a Gone With
the Wind (the latter a recent hit on the Tokyo stage),
or, of course, the samurai version of our Western shoot
'em-up.
Tonight's film, considered by some to be the ultimate
samurai movie, is at the same time a brilliant parody
of the cheap popular myth from which it springs. What
Bonnie and Clyde does for the gangster movie, Akira
Kurosawa's Yoj'imbo does to the traditional sword-fight
film, exploiting to the fullest all its violence and stock
thrills while deflating its romantic notions of heroism
and the simple-minded morality of good-guys versus
bad-guys.
Into the stock situation strolls the stock hero, a ruth
less sword-slinger for hire (played by Toshiro Mifune),
whose services are sought by the two hostile factions
seeking to ruin this worthless little town. But our hero
is different, a man completely devoid of idealism or
devotion to fair play—otherwise he wouldn't last long
in this comically corrupt village, where both sides are
equally detestable and where man's best friend is more
than glad to eat the hand that feeds him.
Master of the fast draw and the even faster double
cross, Mifune decides to amuse himself and earn a
few yen by helping both sets of bad guys to annihilate
each other, while he looks on from a safe distance. Yet
despite the movie's blatant anarchism, Mifune's cheer
ful amorality and the swaggering vitality with which
he goes about his bloody tasks enables the viewer to
adopt a comic attitude toward the corrupt world and
all that violence. Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, who are
destroyed because they cannot escape their own myth,
the hero of Yojimbo triumphs because he has no illu
sions about himself or the world.
Where Yojimbo explodes false myths by the comedy
of farce, The Bailiff (Jan. 19) and Ugetsu (Feb. 23),
two period films of Kenji Mizoguchi, use more subtle
means to reveal the gap between cruel reality and the
noble ambitions and illusory trimphs of mankind. Mizo
guchi's blend of dream-like atmospheres and brutal
realism, recalling his training as a painter, is perfectly
appropriate to the bitter-sweet tone of his films, in
which romantic legends of the past are ironically re
lated to the historical reality of the present.
The Bailiff explores a conflict between humanitarian

ethics and the old feudal order.
Virtue seems to triumph when the
young hero liberates the slaves and
quixotically resigns his post as gov
ernor, but the only result of these
acts is a slave rebellion which he is
powerless to control. Likewise, the
long - awaited reunion with his
mother at the film's end is undercut
by her blindness and refusal to rec
ognize him.
In Ugetsu, a beautiful film which
has been read as a fable of modern
Japan, two peasant neighbors aban
don family and tradition to go in
search of wealth and military glory.
Their triumphs are short-lived and
at great cost; the only answer, it
seems, is to return home and re
sume, with resignation, the old
tasks. In the morality play struggle
between phantom princess and the
potter's wife, Mizoguchi sides with
the redeeming love of the real
woman, though she too, we learn,
is a spirit returned from the dead.
Tadashi Imai in his
film, Portraits of Shame (March 1),
more popularly referred to as
Muddy Waters, departs from his
usual protest theme to depict in a
very warm humanistic fashion the
plight of women of feudal Japan.
The players of the Bungaku Za, dis
tinguished Tokyo repertory com
pany, enact three stories set in the
early 1800's.
The first is that of an unhappy
young woman enmeshed in the feu
dal family order. The next is an in
cident in the life of an impoverished
servant girl, taking place on the

last day of the year (traditional for
settling all debts in Japan). The
last, set in a brothel, recounts the
pitiful story of a geisha and ends in
tragic violence. So effective has
Imai been in his portrayal that the
Japanese Press Critics gave Por
traits of Shame their unanimous
vote as "Best Film of the Year" in
1956.

THE modern films focus on
different aspects of the limits
of man's existence. Ozu's
Drifting Weeds (Jan. 12) centers
on the relation between an individ
ual and his society; The Island
(Feb. 16) by Kaneto Shindo shows
man's intimate relation to nature;
Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain asks
how far man can push himself.
Drifting Weeds is the most tra
ditional of these films and the most
revealing of Japanese social insti

countrymen "the most Japanese of
all directors," probably because of
his direct and intentionally simple
style. There are no fades, no fast

A STARVING, toothless soldier crams mud and
stones into his mouth, and a little dog trots
smugly across the street with a human hand be
tween its jaws.
These are two scenes from this quarter's Japanese
Film Festival, sponsored by the Keio Committee of
Stanford. Featuring eight films by six leading directors,
the series displays the variety and vitality of contem
porary Japanese movies, ranging from fairy tale to doc
umentary and illustrating the major division of the
industry into modern and period films. Three films have
already been shown in this festival of Japanese film
masterpieces, with five remaining.
As in America, the majority of Japanese period films
cater to an audience that seeks nothing in art but its
own sentimental and pseudo-historical myths: the ori
ental equivalent to a Steve Reeves epic or a Gone With
the Wind (the latter a recent hit on the Tokyo stage),
or, of course, the samurai version of our Western shoot
'em-up.
Tonight's film, considered by some to be the ultimate
samurai movie, is at the same time a brilliant parody
of the cheap popular myth from which it springs. What
Bonnie and Clyde does for the gangster movie, Akira
Kurosawa's Yoj'imbo does to the traditional sword-fight
film, exploiting to the fullest all its violence and stock
thrills while deflating its romantic notions of heroism
and the simple-minded morality of good-guys versus
bad-guys.
Into the stock situation strolls the stock hero, a ruth
less sword-slinger for hire (played by Toshiro Mifune),
whose services are sought by the two hostile factions
seeking to ruin this worthless little town. But our hero
is different, a man completely devoid of idealism or
devotion to fair play—otherwise he wouldn't last long
in this comically corrupt village, where both sides are
equally detestable and where man's best friend is more
than glad to eat the hand that feeds him.
Master of the fast draw and the even faster double
cross, Mifune decides to amuse himself and earn a
few yen by helping both sets of bad guys to annihilate
each other, while he looks on from a safe distance. Yet
despite the movie's blatant anarchism, Mifune's cheer
ful amorality and the swaggering vitality with which
he goes about his bloody tasks enables the viewer to
adopt a comic attitude toward the corrupt world and
all that violence. Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, who are
destroyed because they cannot escape their own myth,
the hero of Yojimbo triumphs because he has no illu
sions about himself or the world.
Where Yojimbo explodes false myths by the comedy
of farce, The Bailiff (Jan. 19) and Ugetsu (Feb. 23),
two period films of Kenji Mizoguchi, use more subtle
means to reveal the gap between cruel reality and the
noble ambitions and illusory trimphs of mankind. Mizo
guchi's blend of dream-like atmospheres and brutal
realism, recalling his training as a painter, is perfectly
appropriate to the bitter-sweet tone of his films, in
which romantic legends of the past are ironically re
lated to the historical reality of the present.
The Bailiff explores a conflict between humanitarian

ethics and the old feudal order.
Virtue seems to triumph when the
young hero liberates the slaves and
quixotically resigns his post as gov
ernor, but the only result of these
acts is a slave rebellion which he is
powerless to control. Likewise, the
long - awaited reunion with his
mother at the film's end is undercut
by her blindness and refusal to rec
ognize him.
In Ugetsu, a beautiful film which
has been read as a fable of modern
Japan, two peasant neighbors aban
don family and tradition to go in
search of wealth and military glory.
Their triumphs are short-lived and
at great cost; the only answer, it
seems, is to return home and re
sume, with resignation, the old
tasks. In the morality play struggle
between phantom princess and the
potter's wife, Mizoguchi sides with
the redeeming love of the real
woman, though she too, we learn,
is a spirit returned from the dead.
Tadashi Imai in his
film, Portraits of Shame (March 1),
more popularly referred to as
Muddy Waters, departs from his
usual protest theme to depict in a
very warm humanistic fashion the
plight of women of feudal Japan.
The players of the Bungaku Za, dis
tinguished Tokyo repertory com
pany, enact three stories set in the
early 1800's.
The first is that of an unhappy
young woman enmeshed in the feu
dal family order. The next is an in
cident in the life of an impoverished
servant girl, taking place on the

last day of the year (traditional for
settling all debts in Japan). The
last, set in a brothel, recounts the
pitiful story of a geisha and ends in
tragic violence. So effective has
Imai been in his portrayal that the
Japanese Press Critics gave Por
traits of Shame their unanimous
vote as "Best Film of the Year" in
1956.

THE modern films focus on
different aspects of the limits
of man's existence. Ozu's
Drifting Weeds (Jan. 12) centers
on the relation between an individ
ual and his society; The Island
(Feb. 16) by Kaneto Shindo shows
man's intimate relation to nature;
Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain asks
how far man can push himself.
Drifting Weeds is the most tra
ditional of these films and the most
revealing of Japanese social insti
tutions: Ozu is considered by his
countrymen "the most Japanese of
all directors," probably because of
his direct and intentionally simple
style. There are no fades, no fast
cuts, very little plot development.
The camera stays put after it has
set the scene, which is usually an
interior with people talking, pho
tographed straight-in at eye level.
Not a manipulator or impresario,
Ozu's camera is a modest host, in
viting you to come in and be an ob
servant visitor of the ebb and flow
of life.
The Drifting Weeds of this film
are the lives of a troupe of actors.

Ozu's point is that life is too fragile
to hold on to. At the film's end, the
main character must resign himself
to his wandering life, to being alone
in the midst of troupes and audi
ence. He rejects conflict, accepts
chaos and the transience of his
happiness. This is a typical Ozu
ending; and it has also been a clas
sic Japanese aesthetic theme —
mono no aware, sensitivity to our
smallness, satisfaction in the natu
ral changes of life.
Shindo's masterpiece The Island
is also mono no aware. It shows
how nature flows into the lives of a
farming family, the sole inhabitants
of a small island, how it shapes and
molds them. What nature says to
man counts, not what man says:
here is no dialogue in the film. Nat
ural sounds, occasional sobbing or
laughing, a subtle musical score ac
company the rhythms of the fam
ily's labor for survival. When one of
her sons dies, the woman is immo
bilized with grief and frustration.
But this can only be short-lived;
work must go on for the oth
ers. This exquisitely photographed
movie shows nature gently and
beautifully; but we feel its power,
and our small dependence.
Fires on the Plain (Jan. 26) fo
cuses on the limits of human beha
vior and the questionable border
line between man and beast. The
main character, Tamura, is one of
the stragglers of the disintegrating
Japanese army in the Philippines.
Faced with starvation but afraid to
surrender, the soldiers march on

until they fall dead in the mud.
Reduced to nothing but their in
stinct for survival, they resort finally
to cannibalism.
Tamura alone refuses to become
a beast of prey. Even at the edge of
death, he clings to his humanity
and takes a moral stand: he will not
eat human flesh. But he owes his
own existence to a cruel irony. The
others do not eat him, for the simple
reason that he has tuberculosis. The
question thus becomes wnether, in
a world like this, morality is a sick
ness.
The distinguishing feature of
these Japanese films is what might
be called the honest camera. With
out resorting to overly sophisticated
or experimental photographic tech
niques, the best Japanese directors
have tried to examine their world
with a quiet intensity that tran
scends facile solutions. Neither op
timistic nor pessimitic, their films
have in common a peculiarly Japa
nese note of resignation —an ac
ceptance of man's small place in the
total scheme of nature, recalling
Hokusai's tiny, kimono-clad figures
hovering at the foot of a majestic,
snow-capped Mount Fuji.

of farce, The Bailiff (Jan. 19) and Ugetsu (Feb. 23),
two period films of Kenji Mizoguchi, use more subtle
means to reveal the gap between cruel reality and the
noble ambitions and illusory trimphs of mankind. Mizo
guchi's blend of dream-like atmospheres and brutal
realism, recalling his training as a painter, is perfectly
appropriate to the bitter-sweet tone of his films, in
which romantic legends of the past are ironically re
lated to the historical reality of the present.
The Bailiff explores a conflict between humanitarian

ethics and the old feudal order.
Virtue seems to triumph when the
young hero liberates the slaves and
quixotically resigns his post as gov
ernor, but the only result of these
acts is a slave rebellion which he is
powerless to control. Likewise, the
long - awaited reunion with his
mother at the film's end is undercut
by her blindness and refusal to rec
ognize him.
In Ugetsu, a beautiful film which
has been read as a fable of modern
Japan, two peasant neighbors aban
don family and tradition to go in
search of wealth and military glory.
Their triumphs are short-lived and
at great cost; the only answer, it
seems, is to return home and re
sume, with resignation, the old
tasks. In the morality play struggle
between phantom princess and the
potter's wife, Mizoguchi sides with
the redeeming love of the real
woman, though she too, we learn,
is a spirit returned from the dead.
Tadashi Imai in his
film, Portraits of Shame (March 1),
more popularly referred to as
Muddy Waters, departs from his
usual protest theme to depict in a
very warm humanistic fashion the
plight of women of feudal Japan.
The players of the Bungaku Za, dis
tinguished Tokyo repertory com
pany, enact three stories set in the
early 1800's.
The first is that of an unhappy
young woman enmeshed in the feu
dal family order. The next is an in
cident in the life of an impoverished
servant girl, taking place on the

last day of the year (traditional for
settling all debts in Japan). The
last, set in a brothel, recounts the
pitiful story of a geisha and ends in
tragic violence. So effective has
Imai been in his portrayal that the
Japanese Press Critics gave Por
traits of Shame their unanimous
vote as "Best Film of the Year" in

THE modern films focus on
different aspects of the limits
of man's existence. Ozu's
Drifting Weeds (Jan. 12) centers
on the relation between an individ
ual and his society; The Island
(Feb. 16) by Kaneto Shindo shows
man's intimate relation to nature;
Ichikawa's Fires on the Plain asks
how far man can push himself.
Drifting Weeds is the most tra
ditional of these films and the most
revealing of Japanese social insti
tutions: Ozu is considered by his
countrymen "the most Japanese of
all directors," probably because of
his direct and intentionally simple
style. There are no fades, no fast
cuts, very little plot development.
The camera stays put after it has
set the scene, which is usually an
interior with people talking, pho
tographed straight-in at eye level.
Not a manipulator or impresario,
Ozu's camera is a modest host, in
viting you to come in and be an ob
servant visitor of the ebb and flow
of life.
The Drifting Weeds of this film
are the lives of a troupe of actors.

Ozu's point is that life is too fragile
to hold on to. At the film's end, the
main character must resign himself
to his wandering life, to being alone
in the midst of troupes and audi
ence. He rejects conflict, accepts
chaos and the transience of his
happiness. This is a typical Ozu
ending; and it has also been a clas
sic Japanese aesthetic theme —
mono no aware, sensitivity to our
smallness, satisfaction in the natu
ral changes of life.
Shindo's masterpiece The Island
is also mono no aware. It shows
how nature flows into the lives of a
farming family, the sole inhabitants
of a small island, how it shapes and
molds them. What nature says to
man counts, not what man says:
here is no dialogue in the film. Nat
ural sounds, occasional sobbing or
laughing, a subtle musical score ac
company the rhythms of the fam
ily's labor for survival. When one of
her sons dies, the woman is immo
bilized with grief and frustration.
But this can only be short-lived;
work must go on for the oth
ers. This exquisitely photographed
movie shows nature gently and
beautifully; but we feel its power,
and our small dependence.
Fires on the Plain (Jan. 26) fo
cuses on the limits of human beha
vior and the questionable border
line between man and beast. The
main character, Tamura, is one of
the stragglers of the disintegrating
Japanese army in the Philippines.
Faced with starvation but afraid to
surrender, the soldiers march on

until they fall dead in the mud.
Reduced to nothing but their in
stinct for survival, they resort finally
to cannibalism.
Tamura alone refuses to become
a beast of prey. Even at the edge of
death, he clings to his humanity
and takes a moral stand: he will not
eat human flesh. But he owes his
own existence to a cruel irony. The
others do not eat him, for the simple
reason that he has tuberculosis. The
question thus becomes wnether, in
a world like this, morality is a sick
ness.
The distinguishing feature of
these Japanese films is what might
be called the honest camera. With
out resorting to overly sophisticated
or experimental photographic tech
niques, the best Japanese directors
have tried to examine their world
with a quiet intensity that tran
scends facile solutions. Neither op
timistic nor pessimitic, their films
have in common a peculiarly Japa
nese note of resignation —an ac
ceptance of man's small place in the
total scheme of nature, recalling
Hokusai's tiny, kimono-clad figures
hovering at the foot of a majestic,
snow-capped Mount Fuji.

A STARVING, toothless soldier crams mud and
stones into his mouth, and a little dog trots
smugly across the street with a human hand be
tween its jaws.
These are two scenes from this quarter's Japanese
Film Festival, sponsored by the Keio Committee of
Stanford. Featuring eight films by six leading directors,
the series displays the variety and vitality of contem
porary Japanese movies, ranging from fairy tale to doc
umentary and illustrating the major division of the
industry into modern and period films. Three films have
already been shown in this festival of Japanese film
masterpieces, with five remaining.
As in America, the majority of Japanese period films
cater to an audience that seeks nothing in art but its
own sentimental and pseudo-historical myths: the ori
ental equivalent to a Steve Reeves epic or a Gone With
the Wind (the latter a recent hit on the Tokyo stage),
or, of course, the samurai version of our Western shoot
'em-up.
Tonight's film, considered by some to be the ultimate
samurai movie, is at the same time a brilliant parody
of the cheap popular myth from which it springs. What
Bonnie and Clyde does for the gangster movie, Akira
Kurosawa's Yoj'imbo does to the traditional sword-fight
film, exploiting to the fullest all its violence and stock
thrills while deflating its romantic notions of heroism
and the simple-minded morality of good-guys versus
bad-guys.
Into the stock situation strolls the stock hero, a ruth
less sword-slinger for hire (played by Toshiro Mifune),
whose services are sought by the two hostile factions
seeking to ruin this worthless little town. But our hero
is different, a man completely devoid of idealism or
devotion to fair play—otherwise he wouldn't last long
in this comically corrupt village, where both sides are
equally detestable and where man's best friend is more
than glad to eat the hand that feeds him.
Master of the fast draw and the even faster double
cross, Mifune decides to amuse himself and earn a
few yen by helping both sets of bad guys to annihilate
each other, while he looks on from a safe distance. Yet
despite the movie's blatant anarchism, Mifune's cheer
ful amorality and the swaggering vitality with which
he goes about his bloody tasks enables the viewer to
adopt a comic attitude toward the corrupt world and
all that violence. Unlike Bonnie and Clyde, who are
destroyed because they cannot escape their own myth,
the hero of Yojimbo triumphs because he has no illu
sions about himself or the world.
Where Yojimbo explodes false myths by the comedy
of farce, The Bailiff (Jan. 19) and Ugetsu (Feb. 23),
