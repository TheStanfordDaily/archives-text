CONTEMPORARY music is getting bet
ter all the time. Granted, the commer
cial face of folk and rock music has be
come increasingly grotesque with monotony
and pretentiousness firmly established as car
dinal virtues. But a small but influential group
of professionals is spearheading a revolution
which is only beginning to make itself evident.
Their own talent and creativity, along with
the solid and distinctive musicianship of the
artists with whom they work, are the vital force
behind today's "new sound."
Three important and often destructive ten
sions are present on the current scene. The
first and most frequently discussed is the con
flict between commercialism and "sincerity."
There is a tendency among performers, espe
cially those trying to be instant successes, to
invert the normal relationship of an artist to
his audience and allow his music to become a
function of his acceptance. Paul Simon, of
Simon and Garfunkel, a group which has be
come one of the best-known in the country,
once admitted openly that he and Art Gar
funkel have placcd themselves in the hands of
their record company (Columbia) and have
let the workings of commercial music take
their course. The result has been unfortunate,
with Simon's poetic talent only infrequently
rising above cliche-filled rock settings.
On the other hand, Capitol artist Fred Neil,
whose compositions evoke emotions much like
those in Simon's writing, has remained outside
of the popular mainstream, and although his
following is small, his work has been consist
ently outstanding. His latest album, Sessions,
which is simply a collection of unedited record
ing studio tapes, is one of the warmest, most
human recordings in years.
The second underlying problem in contem
porary music, similar but not identical to the

first, is the tension between popularity and
quality—the age-old question of whether an
artist creates for himself or for his audience.
There is doubt, for example, whether Bob
Dylan's most recent and best release, John
Wesley Harding, would have received any
recognition at all had not Dylan made an open
play for a broad market in earlier recordings.
English s : nger-composer Donovan Leitch is
a performer who seems to be playing both ends
against the middle. He is able to create one
image for the commercial rock world and an
other for those who appreciate subtler modes
of musical expression. And while significant
quality is almost universally abandoned in
commercial music in the search for a product
which will sell, there are many fine artists, such
as Takoma's John Fahey, who have sacrificed
numerous opportunities to achieve widespread
recognition in order to remain free of com
mercial influence.
Finally, there is a tension between the tend
ency on the part of established artists to ore
serve their own, identifiable sound (Peter, Paul
and Mary are a case in point), and the implied
imperative of a good performer to be constant
ly changing and exploring new means of ex
pression.
Lan and Sylvia Tyson, two Canadian folk
singers who have seven successful albums to
their credit, have been exemplary in experi
menting with different ideas. Their Vanguard
release, So Much for Dreaming, is notable in
this respect. The Tysons' sound is unfamiliar
yet effective, and the music, though rough in
places, is pleasant and original.
The Grateful Dead, perhaps this country's
leading instrumental rock group, has won its
reputation not by finding a convenient niche
and remaining there, but by repeatedly dem
onstrating superb musicianship and improvisa
tian in concerts and recording sessions. The
