considerable amount of

material for commercial country star Johnny
Cash, and some selections on this album are
quite commercial, but Langhorne's influence
and Elliott's personality make the recording
a good one.
Langhorne's most admirable accomplish
ment so far has been Reflections in a Crystal
Wind, which the late Richard Farina and his
wife Mimi recorded for Vanguard in 1965.
Though Farina more or less produced the
record himself, Langhorne contributed sev
eral memorial ensemble arrangements and
gathered together a fine group of accompan
ists to perform them.
One of those accompaniests, Felix Pappa
lardi, has also become a producer, and he is
perhaps the best around today. There is little
Pappalardi cannot do musically— he plays
bass, guitar, piano and organ expertly, has a
ringing, powerful voice, is a gifted, sensitive
arranger, and has a finely developed sense
of what constitutes good performance. His
current project is acting as manager for
Cream, an English blues group which has
achieved amazing popularity and respect in
less than a year of existence. Cream features
Eric Clapton, considered by many to be the
finest blues and rock guitarist in the world,
along with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist
Jack Bruce. Pappalardi is effectively the
group's fourth member, writing, arranging,
and directing recording sessions.
The group's two albums on Atco, Fresh
Cream and Disraeli Gears, have been excellent,
with Pappalardi carefully combining the in
dividual talents of Clapton, Baker, and Bruce
with solid, well-written material. Cream can
only improve as a gronp, and Pappalardi may
well be bringing Cream into a preeminent po
sition in the blues field.
Pappalardi has a much different talent to
deal with in Warner Brothers artist Hamilton

Camp. Camp is in his thirties but has been
in the business for a long time. He and folk
singer Bob Gibson performed together for
several years and collaborated on a number
of successful scngs. Since he and Gibson went
their separate ways, Camp has found new
vents for his creativity, especially in acting.
He has appeared on television with the
Smothers Brothers and as the janitor in the
weekly program "He and She," and recently
performed with the Committee Theater in
San Francisco. He mad an album for Elektra,
Paths of Victory, which was not particularly
impressive.
Pappalardi has worked wonders with
Camp's new Warners release, Here's To You.
Camp's composing ability and wry sense of
humor stand out sharply. The arrangements
are tasteful and frequently beautiful. One cut,
"Lonely Place," is exquisite. Camp's high, emo
tional voice echoes against a background of
woodwinds as the words paint a horrible pic
ture of the earth after a nuclear war. At one
point Camp sings about birds and the winds
imitate the fluttering of wings. The entire
album reflects an abundance of talent, with
Camp's questing lyrics and music perfectly
complemented by Pappalardi's arrangements.
Whether Court, Langhorne, and Pappalardi
will ultimately succeed in resolving the con
flicts which trouble contemporary music re
mains to be seen. Of the major performers
with whom the three are associated, only
Cream, and to a lesser extent Richie Havens,
are widely known. Many young artists will
continue to be tempted to turn to commerci
alism, where recognition is more easily gained
(and, as many discover, lost). But these three
influential, creative men, and others like them,
are laying the ground work from which bet
ter and more meaningful contemporary music
will grow. Talent and musicianship will re
place physical appearance and"the sound"
as basic standards, and a great number of
writers, singers, and instrumentalists who are
only frustrated now will find significant new
outlets for expression.
Tomorrow promises to be better than to
day. It's getting better all the time.
