# Euripides in Bay Area
## 
### 
This has been a good winter for Euripides.
Already we have seen his rarely produced Her
akles at the Hillbarn Theatre in Belmont and
perhaps his greatest play The Bacchae at San
Francisco State College. Both productions,
now closed, deserve high praise. With their
memory still vivid, we look forward now to
Euripides' Orestes to be produced at the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley on February
15-17 and 20-24 in the Durham Studio The
atre.
The director will be the influential and con
troversial Polish critic Jan Kott who has been
in residence at Yale, San Francisco State and
at Berkeley during this past year. Professor
Kott has made a far-reaching impact on Shake
spearean criticism and production since the
appearance of his book Shakespeare Our Con
temporary in 1964. His essay in that collection
"King Lear or Endgame?" not only inspired
the famous Peter Brook - Paul Scofield pro
duction of Lear, but also has pretty well de
fined pessimistic, existential, absurdist critical
approaches to Shakespeare.
What Professor Kott will do with Euripi
des' Orestes, a black play of a diseased and
self-defeating world, can be guessed at from
his work on Shakespeare and his startling and
powerful production of Witkiewicz's Madman
and the Nun at San Francisco State last sum
mer.
But, as I said, we've already had two good
performances of Euripides—effective and suc
cessful for very different reasons. At the Hill
barn Theatre, an extension of the College of
San Mateo into the Belmont-San Mateo com
munity, director Robert Brauns chose to fol
low the ancient practice where all speaking
roles were performed by three male actors,
doubling and, of course, masked. Brauns as
Herakles, supported by Bruce Hoard and Ed
ward Puniska, was powerful and convincing
both in body and spirit. His initial appearance
on an exostra was a moment of huge theatrical
excitement. Bruce Hoard in the simple and
beautiful mask of Herakles' wife Megara was
affecting and wonderfuly female without os
tensible womanish mannerisms. This produc
tion brought to mind again how amazingly ex
pressive good masks can be.
Some of the visual aspects of Brauns' pro
duction, however, were disappointing: the
lighting was generally bad, and the use of pro
jections was severely compromised by the 35-
mm. family-room format and noises. Any at
tempt at heroic scale is frustrated by the tiny
Hillbarn Theatre building.

Brauns' great success lay in his making mov
ing and real, man's experience with himself as
a creature whom he scarcely knows but still
must account for. Herakles' madness, for all
its divine visitation, became something that
we could understand; and when it led to his
killing of his wife and children, we knew what
was taking place and were genuinely terrified.
I think this is no small achievement.
At San Francisco State, Paul Rebillot's pro
duction of The Bacchae was a spectacular and
sensuous assault. Richly ornamented and lux
uriant, erotic and fleshy with a heavy female
muskiness about it, the production made dra
matic capital from the chorus of Bacchic wom
en and their ecstasy. Combining psychedelic
and Oriental as well as Greek themes, Rebillot
built the play into a quintessential drama about
man's problem with God and the horror that
lies potential in the destructive polarities of his
nature and consciousness. Where at Hillbarn
we were in sympathy with a particular man
trying to operate in a hostile world, at San
Francisco State we were among archetypes,
witnessing what it is that lies at the very heart
of us all, cruel, impersonal, implacable.
In addition to what was perhaps the best act
ing performance that I have seen in these parts
for some time by Miss B. J. Barsness as Agave,
the production was notable for choruses that
were compelling both for eye and ear. Miming
of the messengers' speeches was especially
good. The handsome young actors were cos
tumed in a wild array of original psychedelic
and art nouveau prints and body-paint. The
music, composed and played live on stage by
the Liberty Street rock group, was stirring and
definitive. The production overall was very
long, uncompromising and aggressive, domi
nated by a heated and informing passion that
must have come from Mr. Rabillot. I came
away feeling that today, having learned the
lessons of Haight-Ashbury, we have the visual
and audio imagery for penetrating Euripides'
mind and imagination. Perhaps we know what
it meant to the Greeks and especially to Euripi
des to be miarons—the polluted ones —and to
face the world of the mad Herakles and Pen
theus whose punishment was to be dismem
bered and eaten by his mother.
And there's yet more to come. It's exciting
to speculate on what Jan Kott will do with that
"sick" play Orestes. We shall shortly know and
undoubtedly be grateful. But the better part
of caution is to get our tickets early. There will
be an immense demand.
