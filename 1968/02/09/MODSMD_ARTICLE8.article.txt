## Sartre's version of 'Trojan Women' 
### 
JEAN-PAUL SARTRE's adaptation of Eu
ripides' Trojan Women was published in
France in 1965. It is a stinging and generic
assault on war with an allegory of the contem
porary woes of Vietnam which can hardly have
been unintentional.
Knopf of New York published an English
version of Sartre's version late last year. Trans
lated into vigorous and contemporary English
>y Ronald Duncan, it heightens the traumatic
sensation that history repeats itself—that the
Greek devastation of Troy was as fatuous and
barbaric as the destruction of Vietnam and Al
geria which have characterized the demise of
the French empire and caused the opposition
of men like Sartre and Camus.
Euripides' Trojan Women has always been
regarded by classical scholars as a succession
of sonorous female moans. The trick with the
wooden horse has worked. Troy is in flames.
King Priam is dead and his fifty sons are in
flight. "Alas" and "Aiai" cry the widows and
bereaved, and that is where the matter might
have rested.
But Sartre saw the play as a sensational in
dictment of war. The superficially naive wire
pulling of t'le Greek gods has, in fact, a much
deeper meaning. The only thing that unites the
gods—thos* who wield power —is that Troy
shall be obliterated. The play ends in total ni
hilism.
But Poseidon's v/ords as he presides over the
disaster have a plangent wisdom:
Idiots
We'll make you pay for this.
T You stupid bestial mortals
Making war, burning cities,
Violating tombs and temples,
Torturing your enemies,
Bringing suffering on yourselves.
Can't you see
War
Will kill you:
All of you?
An important feature of the modern version
is the contempt poured on the factotum, the
obeyer, the go-between who carries out odious
orders. In Greek the herald Talthybius is purely
a stock character and no guilt could be felt to
rest on his shoulders. But in the Trojan catas
trophe he cries out with the cowardly vehe
mence of the colonial administrator faced by
the embarrassment of Buddhist self-immola
tion:
What's that? The tent's all red.
Quick, stop any Trojan women
From burning themselves alive.
I can understand that a free people
Don't easily knuckle under to a catastrophe like
this,
But I don't want any embarrassing suicides on
my hands.
Do you understand?
And certainly no human torches.
King Menelaus is made to chatter like the
egregious head of the U.S.A.:
Some people at home criticize me:
They say I started this terrible war . . .
When Cassandra, the virgin prophetess who
is to go as a spoil of war to Menelaus brother
Agamemnon's bed, screams her hatred it is the
dire foreboding that the conqueror s triumph
will be a hollow one:
We who defended our native land arc glorified.
But they who conquered us shall be cursed.
They started this filthy war:
They will die as stupidly as they lived.
Sartre could not but be aware that the heroes
of Dien Bien Phu were the Viet Minh just as

the Trojan defenders became the symbol of re
sistance in Greek mythology and the inspira
tion for Homer's great epic cycle.
But the version is as rich in poetry as it is in
political allegory. When Hecuba, the ruined
queen, sings her Sic transit gloria mundi over
Troy, the lament is grandiose and eloquent:
this week we should be intoning it for the
devastation of the old imperial capital of Hue
in South Vietnam:
The greatest city the world has ever seen:
To be populated by rodents,
Decorated by brambles . . .
Now ash settles on what we were
And smoke describes what we've become.
Like patriots anywhere the Trojans ascribe
their defeat to irresistibly divine forces.
Troy wasn't conquered:
The Trojans weren't defeated.
They were betrayed by a Goddess:
It's always a mistake to worship a woman.
True, and Athena is not the only woman who
feels the sharp edge of Euripides' pen. An
dromeda, for whom the tragedian wrote an
other play, soars gigantically in her inspired
realistic view of the captive sex: she is uncer
tain that she will be able to preserve intact her
physical memory of Hector:
But I am a woman,
And a woman is only a woman.
They say it takes just one night of pleasure
to master her.
From a potential adulteress she becomes a
heroic mother. The welling of the maternal in
stinct in the face of military annihilation should
force on Sartre's reader the predicament of the
halt and maimed in Vietnam:
Here you are, take it: (her infant Astynax)
Kill it.
Hit it with an axe. Throw it on a fire:
It's yours.
I can't protest: I could only give life to it.
What are you waiting for?
Take it.
All they were was citizens, villagers, mothers
and fathers. They bore the children. Now our
soldiers toss them up and catch them on spears.
Might constitutes right. War, having been
declared, must be won. And with the American
in Vietnam comes chewing-gum, democracy
and penicillin:
They invaded us from Salamis.
They told us then that they were bringing
Creek culture and European enlightenment
To the backward people of Asia:
Our city burned with .progress,
Our young men had their limbs
Amputated by philosophy.
And the dreary withdrawal of the minion is
that of every taxpayer to the fiendish struggle
being fought out in old French Indochina:
All very distasteful. I feel quite sick.
That's the worst of war:
Those who give the orders
Seldom sec the mess it makes
When you hold a child by the feet
And bash its head in against a wall.
Sartre's play is brief, compelling, a latter-day
Euripides with a deliberately cosmic rhetoric.
To those professional politicians who have in
the last two years denied the right of artists
such as Sartre and Russell to sit in judgment of
U.S. foreign policy, we should perhaps reply,
with Orwell, that "the opinion that art should
have nothing to do with politics is itself a po
litical opinion."
