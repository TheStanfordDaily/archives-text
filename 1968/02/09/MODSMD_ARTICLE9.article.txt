## 
### 
Confirmation of the rumor circulating around San Francisco
for a number of weeks was released last week.The rising young
Japanese composer, Seiji Ozawa, 32, will replace Josef Krips as
conductor and music director of the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra.
Ozawa, who is currently in his third season as conductor of
the Toronto Symphony, will begin at the commencement of
the 1970-1971 season and has been appointed for a three-year
term. Maestro Krips will assume the title of "Conductor Emeri
tus" upon his retirement.
Leonard Bernstein has called Seiji Ozawa a genius. He ap
pointed him assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic
in 1961, when Ozawa was only 26. Ozawa launched his profes
sional career at the age of 23 in Besanson, France, where he
won a conducting competition. Since then, he has become one
of the most sought-after conductors in America. The end of the
summer marked the completion of his fourth year as music
director of Chicago's Ravinia Festival.
Ozawa is no newcomer to the San Francisco audience. He
conducted Berlioz' Requiem last season and judging from the
critics' response, it was the highlight of the season. For those
interested in seeing h'm at the helm of the symphony, he will
be conducting on February 14, 15, and 16 at the War Memorial
Opera House. Maestro Krips has noted that Ozawa is the man
who is best able to carry on his work in trying to achieve the
highest possible artistic goals for the San Francisco Symphony.
He termed Ozawa the "man of the future."
Those of us familiar with Maestro Krips know better than to
doubt his judgment.
