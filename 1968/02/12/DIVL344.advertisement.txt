All You Need Is Love
After all, it's what makes the world go 'round in
that wonderful, once-in-a-lifetime way. The en
gagement ring you choose says so much about
your love . . . and should it be a Keepsake, the
word is "perfect." A brilliant diamond of fine
color and modern cut guaranteed perfect (or
replacement assured). Just look for the name
Keepsake, in the ring and on the tag at your
Keepsake Jeweler's store. He's in the yellow pages
under "Jewelers."
