44 I wanted to work for a 1
small company. It may * Ja^K
sound crazy, but that's
why I went with IBM!'
"When I was in school, I dreaded the thought lH|k.
of working for some huge company where I'd j
be jusl another number," says IBM's Jim Hamil- il^gjM
ton. (Jim, who has a B.S. in Electrical Engineering,
is a Systems Engineering Manager in Marketing.)
"At the same time, I knew there were definite ad-
vantages in working for a large firm. So as I interviewed
each company, I checked into the degree of individuality y
I could expect there.
"One of the main reasons I picked IBM was their decentral
ization. They've got over 300 locations throughout the country.
Which to me means a big company with a small-company
atmosphere." Jj||| P'
IBM's small team concept
"Actually, there's plenty of decentralization even within each
location. For instance, in science and engineering, they use a
small team concept. It means, no matter how large the project,
you work individually or as part of a small team—about four
or live people.
"In marketing, I was pretty much my own boss even
before I became a manager. As a systems engineer, it's
up to you to find the solution to a customer's problem,
and then see it's carried out in the optimum way. You
work with the customer every step of the way."
There's a lot more to the IBM story than Jim has
mentioned. For more information, visit your campus
