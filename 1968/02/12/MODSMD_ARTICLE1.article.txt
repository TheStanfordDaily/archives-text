# Navy Jet Strikes Bay Bridge, Pilots Die, No Others Injured
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A
Navy jet carrying two men
crashed into the San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge's upper
deck in fog Sunday and fell in
flames into San Francisco Bay.
Both airmen vanished into the
bay's chilly waters but there

It was also reported that a
man whose car was waiting for
traffic to clear on the westbound
level of the bridge jumped from
the bridge. The man is believed
to be a Stanford senior, who
was returning from Berkeley.

was no casualty on the bridge,
where traffic was light.
The upper deck, which carries
westbound traffic into San Fran
cisco, was closed for 2 l fc hours
while engineers gave it a safety
check. During that time west
bound traffic was halted, then
diverted to the lower deck which
usually carries only eastbound
vehicles.
The traffic jam backed up
about 5,000 cars.
Coast guard rescue boats, a
Navy tug and a San Francisco
ffreboat, searching the bay for
the missing fliers, found only

scattered debris and an oil
slick.
The T33 jet trainer roared
away from nearby Alameda na
val air station at 10:40 a.m., and
struck the criss-cross steel grid
on the Oakland side of the bridge
just west of Yerba Buena Island.
One upright girder was bent.
The plane, shattered by the
impact, dropped flaming debris

onto the deck. The main section
of the northbound trainer shot
about 300 yards beyond the
bridge and dropped into the bay.
A witness said the plane dis
appeared at once.
Visibility on the bay was vir
tually zero at the time.
An hour and a half later, the
fog lifted sufficiently to reveal
an oil slick.

One witness, driving on the
upper deck, said he thought an
oil truck in front of him had ex
ploded. Then he saw the plane
through the fog.
From below the bridge, the
accident was witnessed by Ed
ward Mackey, captain of the tug
Napa River, who said the plane
plunged directly into the water.
He picked up bits of debris and
stood by until the Coast Guard
arrived.
The steel structure on the can
tilever section of the bridge was
blackened for 15 to 20 feet.
Mike Foley, bridge engineer,
reported damage to a vertical
girder in a truss span as he
and other engineers began a
safety check.
Foley said he was concerned
about what effect the heat from
the flaming plane could have on
bridge metal.
Ronald Terry, a trucker from
El Sobrante, Calif., said a
"streak of light went past me"
and that then he saw the plane
hit the bridge and plunge into
the water.
Many cars, trucks and buses
from the Oakland side were
required to turn about and
head back to the toll plaza.
The East Bay side of the
bridge is between 150 and 17S
feet above the water, which Ls
40 feet deep at the crash site.
Bridge authorities said this
was the first time the BV2-mile
span had been struck by a plane
since its opening in 1936.
