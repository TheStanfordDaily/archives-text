• Hue Citadel IS eared
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Ma
rines moved up the Perfume
River in assault boats Sunday
night and charged ashore to
flank entrenched North Viet
namese soldiers battling in the
old imperial Citadel of Hue.
About 400 Marines landed
above the Citadel and then
wheeled inland from the river
bank to aid South Vietnamese
troops who have been battling
from the fortress-like Citadel
since Jan. 31.
In the air war, the U.S. Com
mand announced Sunday that
U.S. Navy jets dodged antiair
craft fire and missiles 10 miles
south of Hanoi to bomb for the
first time an important radio
communications station in
North Vietnam's air defense
network.
• Why The Viet Raids
PARIS (AP) — The main aim
of the Viet Cong offensive in
South Vietnam is to eliminate or
discredit the existing adminis
trative machinery and keep the
Saigon government from even
tual negotiations, according to a
well-studied assessment here.
The theory, which comes from
neutral informants with close
contacts in the region, is pre

sented as a possible explanation
for the big Viet Cong push.
The informants, who asked
not to be identified, also said a
chance to start negotiations ap
parently was close recently, but
since the Viet Cong upsurge the
prospects for talks have faded.
The main goal of the Viet
Cong operation seems to be to
kill, kidnap or threaten so many
government officials and civil
servants that the Saigon regime
of President Nguyen Van Thieu
is no longer representative or
viable, the sources said.
Thus, the argument goes, any
effective peace talks — when
they take place — would be be
tween the Americans on one
side and the Viet Cong and
North Vietnamese on the other.
• Korean Talks Set
SEOUL (AP) — North Korea
has rejected a U.N. Command
proposal for a meeting Monday
to air claims of Communist
truce violations "in and through
the demilitarized zone," a com
mand spokesman said. It was in
dicated that the Communists
proposed a Wednesday meeting
and that this will be acceptable
to the U.N. side.
U.S. envoy Cyrus Vance mean
while headed into talks with

South Korean President Chung
Hee Park.
The U.N. Command an
nounced Sunday it had asked for
a full meeting of the joint Mili
tary Armistice Commission —
MAC — Monday at Panmunjom
— the second such session since
the U.S. intelligence ship Pueblo
was seized Jan. 28. There was
no word on why the Commu
nists objected to a Monday ses
sion.
• Thant, Kosygin Talk
MOSCOW (AP) — U.N. Sec
retary-General U Thant arrived
from India Sunday and inform
ants said he began discussions
with Premier Alexei N. Kosygin
on prospects for peace in Viet
nam.
The main discussion on the
war apparently took place at a
dinner given Sunday night by
Kosygin. Tass said a "friendly
conversation took place" but
gave no details. However, in
formants said the war was the
main topic.
Pravda, the official Commu

nist party newspaper greeted
Thant with front page backing
for Hanoi's peace terms.
Thant will fly to London Mon
day for talks with Prime Minis

• S.C. Boycott Planned
ORANGEBURG, S.C. (AP) —
Eight hundred Orangeburg Ne
groes called Sunday for the im
mediate removal of National
Guard troops from the city and
made plans for a boycott of
white businesses.
Reacting to last week's racial
violence that left three dead and
some 50 persons injured, the
Negroes met Sunday and voted
overwhelming approval of a
broad civil rights campaign. Rep
resented at the meeting was a
cross section of the city's Negro
community.
A statement adopted at the
meeting also called for "immedi
ate suspension of the law en
forcement officers responsible
for the police brutality" in the

Thursday night incident that re
sulted in the three deaths.
Following the Negro meeting
a dusk-to-dawn curfew went into
effect at 5 p.m. Sunday for the
third straight night. More than
600 National guardsmen re
sumed patrols.
• YDs Score Johnson
SACRAMENTO (AP)—Lead
ers of the California Young
Democrats adopted a resolution
Sunday urging President John
son not to run for re-nomination.
The organization's state cen
tral committee ended a two-day
meeting by declaring "the Dem
ocratic party is rife with fac
tionalism due to the machina
tions of ambitious men." It said
a candidate for president is
needed who can unify the party,
and declared Johnson should not
seek a second term but instead
stand aside for another candi
date.
The Young Democrats also
adopted a resolution finding it

"necessary to offer moral sup
port to those who have openly
aided and abetted those who
have refused conscription into
the armed forces of the United
States . .
• Garbage Strike Over
NEW YORK (AP) — Thou
sands of sanitation men pitched
into removing 100,000 tons of
garbage from the city's streets
Sunday, after a nine-day strike
was ended on terms Gov. Nel
son A. Rockefeller forced on a
protesting, angry Mayor John
V. Lindsay.
Under Rockefeller's unprece
dented formula, announced Sat
urday night, the state will take
over the city Sanitation Depart
ment and pay the workers with
city funds at a rate that Lindsay
had said amounted to "black
mail."
Lindsay told a Sunday news
conference that the Rockefeller
plan was "unsound" and "cor
rupts the fundamental rights of
the people of New York City and
their elected representatives."
Rockefeller refused to call out
the National Guard, as Lindsay,
a fellow Republican, requested.
The governor said the guards
men could not have done the

job, and that their use could
have led to "fighting in the
streets." Organized labor had
threatened a general strike if
troops were used.
• Another U.S. Medal
GRENOBLE, France (AP) —
The U.S. Olympic team .still ec
static over Peggy Fleming's
smashing triumph in figure
skating, got something else to
rave about Sunday when Dianne
Holum won her second medal of
the Winter Games by finishing
third in the 1,000-meter speed
skating race.
Miss Holum's achievement,
however, did not completely ov
ershadow the disappointing per
formance of Cynthia and Ronald
Kauffman in the compulsory
figures of the pairs skating and
the fourth loss by the winless
U.S. hockey team, this one a 3-2
decision to Canada.
At the same time, France's
Jean-Claude Killy took a half
step toward gaining a sweep of
the three men's Alpine skiing
races, posting the fastest time
in the first of two giant slalom
runs ,and Italy's Eugenio Monti,
nine-time world champion bob
sledder, ended years of frustra
tion by winning his first Olym
pic gold medal.
