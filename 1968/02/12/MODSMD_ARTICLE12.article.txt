Look who's concerned about its public image!
It's none other than your friendly neighborhood napalm
makers — the Dow Chemical Company, which has the distinc
tion of being No. 1 target for student demonstrators with a total
of 27 protests.
Only last week, The Daily and newspapers across the country
received packets of information about Dow with a letter from
Public Relations Director E. N. Brandt.
"In recent weeks," he began, "The Dow Chemical Company
has been the target of anti-war demonstrations on college cam
puses — aimed primarily at Dow recruiters — protesting Dow's
production of napalm for the Department of Defense.
"At present we know of no plans for such a demonstration in
your city. However, we believe it might be helpful to you to
have die enclosed material on file in case one develops."
The material is abundant — reprints, company reports, and
statements, all designed to inform the reader that their death
dispensing gasoline-jelly "accounts for slightly more than one
quarter of one per cent of our sales." Is this perhaps part of Dow
president H. D. Doan's expectation that, "Dow will direct its
efforts toward a better tomorrow"?
So, the literature implies, give Dow a break. Dow's company
statement says, "We as a company have made a moral judgement
on the goals of our government and we support them.
"We may not agree as individuals with every decision of every
military or governmental leader, but we regard these leaders as
men trying honestly and relentlessly to find the best possible solu
tions to very complex international problems."
My country, right or wrong?
Dow is concerned about what you are thinking and is asking
the mass media for help. In doing our part let us quote from the
last paragraph of Mr. Brandt's letter to editors:
"If you wish other facts or comment from Dow, please call
Dave Coslett or A 1 Wolf at (517 ) 636-0527 or 636-0508 collect.
We will be happy to help you in any way we can, not just in this
area, but in any area concerning our company."
We think Dow would be interested in hearing from private
citizens as well as newspaper editors. Why not give them a call?
