# Two Minutes of Haight
## Let's Find Ourselves 
### Tim Haight 
"As Tzu-Gung was traveling
through the regions north of the
river Han, he saw an old man
working in his vegetable garden.
He had dug an irrigation ditch.
The man would descend into a
well, fetch up a vessel of water
in his arms and pour it into the
ditch. While his efforts were
tremendous the results appeared
to be very meager.
"Tzu-Gung said, 'There Is a
way whereby you can irrigate a
hundred ditches in one day, and
whereby you can do much with
little effort. Would you not like
to hear of it?'
"Then the gardener stood up,
looked at him and said, 'And
what would that be?"
"Tsu-Gung replied, 'You take
a wooden lever, weighted at the
back and light in front. In this
way you can bring up water so
quickly that it just gushes out.
This is called a draw-well.'
"Then anger rose up in the
old man's face, and he said, 'I
have heard my teacher say that
whoever uses machines does all
his work like a machine. He
who does his work like a ma
chine grows a heart like a
machine, and he who carries the
heart of a machine in his breast
loses his simplicity. He who has
lost his simplicity becomes un
sure in the strivings of his soul.
Uncertainty in the strivings of
the soul is something which
does not agree with honest
sense. It is not that I do not
know of such things; I am
ashamed to use them., " —cited
in Werner Heisenberg's The
Physicist's Conception of Na
ture.
What a funny old man. If he
rebelled at such a trifle as a
draw-well (a machine about on
the level of a doorknob), what
would he do in 20th century
America? Who knows? The im
portant question is what the
hell are we doing in the 20th cen
tury America.

Our social structure is driven
by America's unprecedented ac
ceptance of technology and its
resulting endless rapid change.
As Kenneth Keniston notes in
his dated but valuable book,
The Uncommitted: Alienated
Youth in American Society, " . . .
though our own country is not
unique in the role technology
plays, it is distinguished by the
intensity of and the relative ab
sence of restraint of techno
logical change."
The Demands
The demands of this society
include: a priority to cognitive,
rather than emotional behavior
in any public situation, especially
those related to work; a separa
tion of work and play—requir
ing a fragmenting of the per
sonality, usually around work
vs.-family lines; tremendous
change, resulting in insecurity
about identity— with an empha
sis on adaptation.
Other factors that help tech
nology are the small, nucloar,
American family—[a building
block easily moved to the neces
sary area of production], in
creased specialization and de
mand for lengthy education, and
the need to defer gratification
in the name of achieving long
range, complex goals.
Alone
Because of thq small family,
adults feel more and more

alone. Because of the need to
constantly adapt, we live in the
present and yell, "Long live the
Eternal Now." Because of the
specialization, depersonalization,
and fragmentation, we drop
acid to achieve a fusion with the
Universe we can't achieve with
our fellow man.
We have seen our parents liv
ing in the patterns described
above. We don't dig it. If that is
what growing up means, forget
it. We become alienated. (Yes,
that out-of-style word is com
ing back, now that attempts
to banish it—the New Left and
hipness—are going out.)
Enter also, perhaps, the im
pact of the electronic media.
There we sit at the O, with a
full color television n wsstory
on a Da Nang hospital to go
with our hamburger and beer.
The alienated child rebels—
a reductionist explanation of our
generation's upheaval. Part of
it is so. But as much as it af
f cts us, it also determines other
actions of 01 r country—our for
eign policy, our structural un
employment, the neurosis of our
parents.
We cannot be Luddites, ma
chine-smashers. It's a little late
for that. But we can start giv
ing priority to studies of our
machine-dominated plight, get
things out of the saddle, and
got back in ourselves.
