# The 						Capitol Scene
## Why Wasn't The CIA Fishing? 
### Art Buchwald 
Everyone is second-guessing
what we should have done or
not done about the hijacking of
the USS Pueblo, which, depend
ing on whom you believe, had
been either on the high seas, or
in the territorial waters of North
Korea.
What everyone does agree on
is that the Pueblo was an elec
tronic snooper, spying on North
Korea, and that the operation
was pretty botched up.
I had no idea what we could
have done differently until I
bumped into my old friend, Dmi
tri, a Soviet Embassy employe,
whom I'm quite sure is a spy.
Strangely enough, Dmitri
seemed very upset about the
Pueblo's capture.
"Is making it hard on all spy
ships," Dmitri said. "Because of
Pueblo, now all spy ships are
looked on with suspicion."
Wrong Approach
"But what could we have done
differently?" I asked Dmitri.
"Is not my place to help Amer
icans in espionage, but you went
about spying on North Korea
all wrong."
"What would you have done?"
"Fish."
"What do you mean, 'fish'?" I
said angrily.
"Is well-known fact that all
Soviet spy ships are fishing
trawlers. They are manned by
civilians dressed as fisherman.
Every time they go somewhere,
three civilians throw their fish
ing lines over side of trawler
and fish. Then, if boat drifts Into
territorial waters, everyone Is
arested for illegal fishing."
"That did happen in Alaska,"
I admitted.
"Is happening all the time,"
Dmitri said. "Suppose instead of
U.S. Navy ship, the United
States sent in fishing trawler.
Everyone knows the fish off
North Korea are running good
at this time of year. So you show
up off Wonsan and throw nets
out.
Capitalistic Fisherman
"Torpedo boat comes out and
yells, 'Hey, you dirty capitalistic,
rotten, revisionist fisherman,
stop fishing in our waters.'
So your captain yells, 'Is free
waters for fish. Americans need
fish for to win hearts and minds
of people in the free world. Drop
dead, stupid torpedo boat.' "
"That's provocative," I said
"Is only stupid fishing captain
speaking â€” not voice of U.S.
Navy. Torpedo boat gets mad

and calls for fishing warden,
who boards trawler and arrests
captain for fishing in North Ko
rean waters. So what do head
lines read? Page 45 it says,
'American fishing boat arrested
by North Korean fishing war
den.'
"Two days later, story is now
on page 65 and says, 'American
fisherman pay fine. United
States promises to punish stu
pid captain.'
"Is no big incident, and the
next time we get caught spying
in your waters, you can get back
your money. Don't you see? No
one gets mad when fisherman
get arrested. Is happening all
the time."
"I'll have to admit you're
right, Dmitri. Even I wouldn't

have gotten angry if they had
arrested American fishermen.
After all, fishermen do have to
take risks."
"Not only that," Dmitri said.
"But is well-known fact even if
your boat doesn't get arrested,
CIA can always use fresh fish."
"Dmitri," I said, "I'm going to
pass on your suggestion to the
powers that be. But it's obvious
you've been ordered to make
this suggestion to me. Why?"
"Is true, what you say. Soviet
Secret Service is having money
problems. If American Secret
Service looks lousy, they'll cut
our budget. We have to make
you look good, or we won't get
any more rubles for our brand
new fishing trawlers."
