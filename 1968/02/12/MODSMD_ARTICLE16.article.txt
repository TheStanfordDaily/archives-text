## Committee Insists Hayes Is Realistic 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Several students who read the
first portion of last Friday's
Daily article on Denis Hayes
were left with the mistaken im
pression that Denis is a "negati
vist." We wish to publicly cor
rect that totally erroreous view.
While Denis is certainly cri
tical of the governmental sys
tem we presently have, he firm
ly believes that student govern
ment has a useful — indeed, a
vital — function to perform at
Stanford.
Everyone who is associated
with our present ASSU structure
will freely admit that it doesn't
work. For Denis to assert that
the decision-making capacity of
the present ASSU structure is
farcical is not to be a "negati
vist"; it is to be a realist.
The question is, can it be im
proved? Hayes emphatically
answers YES, and he has pro
duced concrete designs for mean
ingful reform.
The latter part of your article,
thought not well organized, gave
a useful skimming of some of
Denis' ideas concerning the legi
timate functions of student gov
ernment. Unfortunately, most
people we've surveyed seem to

have been so upset by the first
paragraph that they didn't both
er to read on.
We are, however, very pleased
that The Daily has seen fit to
give the vice presidential cam
paign some long-overdue cover
age.

'Impartial Coverage 9
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to compliment Mr. Mc-
Mahon on his impartial coverage
in the Feb. 1 Daily of the con
troversy surrounding the Com
munity Health course at the
Medical School.
Required courses are consid
ered to be part of a core curri
culum which covers material
every student must know. Such
material cannot therefore be of
fered only in elective courses
which few students will have
time to attend; adequate cover
age of these areas should be of
fered in the required course.
