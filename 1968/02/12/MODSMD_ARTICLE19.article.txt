# Where Lies Fraternities' Future?
## STANFORD DAILY FOCUS ON RESIDENCES 
### NICK SELBY 
What is the future of fraterni
ties at Stanford?
Only 14 people appeared in
the forum room of the Meyer
library Thursday night to find
out as two deans, a Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
residence committee member,
the Inter-Fraternity Council
(IFC) president, the head spon
sor at Wilbur, and a fraternity
president tried to answer the
question.
"Fraternities have a good
chance to be leaders in residen
tial reform," concluded Associ
ate Dean of Students Wlllard

Wyman at the end of the discus
sion. "Some of them will keep
pace with the more intellectual
student body and make
changes."
"But others won't shift their
policies and will get hurt," Wy
man said.
Creative Students Won't Pledge
"The fact which may be most
important to fraternities," Wy
man said earlier, "is that SES
will recommend the admissions
office not accept so many 'high
school leader' types and turn to
more creative students. These
new students may not be inter
ested in fraternities."
SES residence committee mem
ber Sidney Verba, a political sci
ence professor, described the re
lationship between fraternities
and the other living groups on
campus. "Are fraternities legiti
mate subjects of concern for the
university?" he asked.
"Fraternities are not equiva
lent to apartments In Palo Alto

because, although they are pri
vately owned, they are part of
the residence pattern at Stan
ford. We must then ask if they
are compatible with the rest of
the university as they now
stand," Verba said.
He answered that they were
not compatible for four reasons:
they are not easily made coed,
not easily integrated with fresh
men, and many academic de
partments are reluctant to teach
courses in frat houses.
Verba claimed that the fourth
reason was the most important
"Selective rush is the most in
compatible element of fraternl-

ties. Selection is based on vague
criteria and results in unfortu
nate, non-diverse living groups,"
he said.
Although selectivity Is the
crucial issue, Verba also said
that it wasn't very important.
"Ten years ago we would have
been arguing about discrimina
tion. Now we don't have to. It's
not worth disrupting the univer
sity if enough men want selec
tion."
"I think that four weeks after
selectivity ended, however, no
one would care it had," Verba
continued. "I wonder why every
one is so concerned. It's so triv
ial."
"My own feelings are that the
people who want selectivity are
somewhat pathetic. The 'ding' is
an ugly concept. If they feel se
lectivity is important to creat
ing community within a living
group, then I feel sorry for
them," Verba said.
Phi Kap president John Grube

said that the selection proce
dures should be changed, but
that selectivity should not dis
appear and that it probably
wouldn't as long as the off-cam
pus option remained.
"People want to guarantee
that they can communicate at
all levels about all things,"
Grube said. "They don't want to
see disagreement result in a
polarization of their residence
into two groups which won't
talk to each other. Selection
prevents this from happening."
IFC president Mike Quinn
added that if change were to
come, it must come from within
the fraternity system, and not
from without.
New Plan to End Selective Bush
Verba then described a plan
to end selective rush he sug
gested to the SES committee
last Thursday. He stated the mu
tual selection process of frosh
choosing a fraternity and fra
ternities choosing frosh might
be retained.
He said that the second ele
ment of rush, the strains and
psychological pressures, should
be removed.
To achieve this end, Verba
suggested that there be a ran
dom draw to reduce the number
of frosh wanting to live in frat
houses to the number of spaces
available. "Anyone unable to live
in fraternities would then know
it was because of a random
draw," Verba said.
The remainder of the frosh
would then rank their first ten
fraternity choices, and fraterni
ties would rank the frosh they
wanted. The rankings would be
fed to a computer, which would
be told to satisfy as many first
choices as possible, giving equal
weight to frosh and fraternity
rankings.
The few left over would be as
signed to fraternities. "I'm sure
there would be no problem for
either group after a few weeks,"
Verba said.
Verba's coup de grace lay in
the weighting of preferences.
Each year, he said, the com
puter would rank fraternity

preferences less and frosh pref
erences more. In a few years it
would be a complete draw sys
tem.
"It's a weak, middle-of-the
road alternative to ending selec
tivity outright," Verba said, "but
it would keep these four things
which are good about fraterni
ties: thpy are small, self-govern
ing, self-financed, and housed In
pretty buildings. No one on the
SES committee wants to destroy
these benefits."
Can Frats Be Part of System?
Should fraternities be part of
the residence system in the fu
ture? "I don't think anyone
starting a university today
would incorporate fraternities,"
answered Wyman. "If you had
discovered the residence situa

tion which was ideal for educa
tion and living, would you let
people live in fraternities?" Wy
man asked Quinn.
"Are you saying I'm not get
ting a good education because I
live in the D.U. (Delta Upsilon)
house?" Quinn countered. "Who
determines what residence gives
the best education for each per
son?" he asked.
Wyman answered that the fac
ulty should make the final deci
sion after receiving suggestions
from the students.
Steve Tipton, head sponsor at
Wilbur, explained that there was
need to fear the university im
posing one type of alternative.
"It must consider the different
views of students. As an ex
treme example, it can't ask the
people it brings here to play

football to necessarily live in a
demonstration house."
The answer. Qulnn concluded,
is that the university must pro
vide as many housing alterna
tives as possible.
Assistant Dean of Students
Dan Williams asked Tipton if
the freshmen would even con
tinue to go through rush. Tipton
said they would, but noted some
changes that had already taken
place in their attitudes toward
rush. "They have a better un
derstanding of what they're do
ing and are taking a more care
ful look," Tipton said.
"Frosh are less willing to take
the university, whether, it be its
policy toward residences or
courses, for granted. They are
more responsible individuals
now," he concluded.
