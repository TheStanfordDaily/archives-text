# Reasons For Rushing, Joining A Frat House
## 
### 
The alternatives for upper
class living at Stanford are
numerous and varied. The great
advantage of being able to make
such a choice, however, is lost
if one does not avail oneself of
all the opportunities presented

to explore each of the different
types of living groups. The op
portunity in the case of fraterni
ties is rush. Rush is a process of
mutual selection and a fra
ternity is eager to meet and to
know every freshman who indi
cates an interest in the house.
Beside the formal, evening open
house functions, provision is
made for informal rush activi
ties, such as open afternoons,

which allow the rushee to see a
house as it would be if he lived
there. It is up to the rushee,
however, to participate in these
functions.
Fraternities at Stanford are
unique. Almost all rushees find
that the chapters differ from
their conceptions of what fra
ternities are. The houses are not
all alike and among them exists
an atmosphere to suit any
rushee. Rush allows a man to
find this atmosphere and con
versely, a fraternity can determ
ine a rushee's desire to be a
particpating member of the
chapter. The culmination of
conscientious rushing by both
parties is an active, exciting
living unit.

Contribution
Having had close association
with only one fraternity, I am
in no way competent to speak
for them all. The houses are
as diverse as the entire Stan
ford community. There does,
however, appear to be one thing
which most fraternity men have
in common—an active commit
ment to participate in the activi
ties of their living group. This
is a direct result of one unique

feature which characterizes our
living system. Only a fraternity
faces the posibility of collaps
ing due to internal problems.
That fact makes it imperative
that members of the group
"stick together" and create an
"image" to provide the same
continuity which the University
provides for the dormitories.
Living in a fraternity is de
manding of time and effort.
Constant interaction with a
large number of people can be
frustrating and tiring as well
as exciting. There is pressure to
take part in all of the groups
activities, and, if things are as
they should be, there is an
eagerness to take part. The
comaradery which results from
group activity and unity is the
ultimate goal of the fraternity
system.
Some who join are not willing
to make the necessary sacrifices;
others give all they've got and
receive nothing in return. For
many, however, life in a fratern
ity is the most rewarding ex
perience of their college career.
If you are ever going to be part
of a close knit group, now is the
time to try it.

• A Home 9 Not A Hotel
One thing common to all fra
ternities is the feeling that the
fraternity is home—a place
where one can get a snack with
out confronting a vending ma
chine, a place where one can
talk to someone on another
floor without speaking to a
semi-stranger, a place where the
living room is not divorced from
the individual rooms.
There is a distinctly personal

atmosphere in a fraternity, a
great deal of ' interaction be
tween membe*L-Although it is
undoubtedly true that the ran
dom membership of a Wilbur
house is more diverse than that
of any fraternity, I would sug
gest that diversity is useless
unless there is interaction be
tween the diverse elements of a
house. All members must share
some common ground if such
interaction is often to take
place—in my experience an
active interest in people and in
sharing ideas and enthusiasm
provides this ground in fraterni
ties.
In addition to the informal,
personal atmosphere which the
fraternity offers. There are
additional advantages which re
sult from being a small, self
regulating living group. Fra
ternities have freedom to con
trol for better or worse their
environment — membership,
activities, goals, physical plant.
The smallness of the individ
ual fraternity makes it easy for
a single member to influence his
environment, but it also makes

it much more necessary for him
to do so if the fraternity is to
be more than a humdrum group
of casual friends.
How often this freedom of
self-control Is constructively
used is a moot question, but
personally I think it occurs
quite often for I have found
my three years in a fraternity
ones of general growth and
consequently extremely enjoy
able.

• ExploreThe
Possibilites
The members of any living
group have the opportunity to
participate in many campus ac
tivities. A fraternity member
can participate in the same ac
tivities available to a person in
any other living group.
A fraternity, however, offers
more to its members than dorms
or other living groups. It con
tributes to the community by
sponsoring such events as guest
speakers, house seminars, and
community service projects. In
addition, one finds within the
house not only spirit, but also
a sense of pride and loyalty.
Since the members alone are
responsible for their own hous
ing, meals, and perpetuation, in
dividual responsibility and pride
result, with each member hav

ing an equal voice in the de
cisions affecting his fraternity's
daily and long-range operations.
Because a fraternity member
spends three years in one house,
he can see his additions to the
group benefit himself and others
in an atmosphere of comarad
erie. For the ambitious person,
fraternity alumni can be an in
valuable source of advice and
assistance in matters pertain
ing to graduate schools and
jobs.
The social aspects of a fra-

ternity speak for themselves,
from casual mixers on Friday
afternoons to gala party events.

by the fraternity system.
