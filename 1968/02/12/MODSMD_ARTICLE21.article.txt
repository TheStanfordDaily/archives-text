# The 						Horseman Senator
## Red Barn: A Remnant Of The Farm 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Leland Stanford was a horse
man and a gambler, and al
though his money Is now all
squandered on education, his
stables still remain.
Off Junipeno Serra Boulevard,
on campus, there is a world
totally removed from the bustle
and activity which characterizes
Quad.
This world Is composed of a
big red barn, corrals, horses,
sawdust and mud. The entire
area goes by the name of the
Red Barn and encompasses fifty
four acres of land, not to be
confused with the modern res
taurant by the same name.
The history of the stables re
cords the development of a pas
sion for breeding the nation's
finest horses.
In 1879 Stanford built a min
iature track, and It soon be
came renowned as a kinder
garten of speed. His theories
of breeding and training
horses were soon adopted by
other progressive breeders.
The Senator stated, "I believe
in developing a colt's strength
with his growth. Judicious exer
cise in beneficial rather than
harmful ... My aim is to give
the greatest possible amount of
exercise without fatigue."
Today Jack Melville, who
looks much like the handsome,

weathered cowboys in Marlboro
Country has run the stable for.
two years. This means a six-day
work week. He teaches riding
classes with the aid of an assist
ant, Brooks Stephens, who is a
former Stamford coed. Seven
men are employed to maintain
the stables, and Melville owns
twenty-five of the stable's one
hundred horses himself.
Commenting on his past,
Melville said, "I have been In
terested in horses all my life.
I've worked with them all my
life, too. I had a stable In
Hyde Park, New York, for
twenty-five years. Then I
owned the Canada Stables In
Woodslde for ten years, and
now I'm here."
Melville says that the stable
facility, with its five rings and
three hunt fields, is probably

one of the best in the entire
state. The legal owner of the
Red Barn Is Stanford Univer
sity.
One of the major additions to
the stable area came about ten
years ago when John Galvin, a
Woodside resident who now lives
in Ireland, donated the money
to build a covered ring. The con
struction of this ring makes
Stanford P.E. riding classes pos
sible in the wet weather of the
winter and spring quarters.
There are four categories of
P.E. classes, beginning, interme
diate, advanced, and Jumping.
The fee for each of these classes
is $45 a quarter.
Classes meet three times a
week, and about seventy-five
Stanford students also take ad
vantage of the stable facilities
by boarding their horses there.

now I'm here."
Melville says that the stable
facility, with its five rings and
three hunt fields, is probably

one of the best in the entire
state. The legal owner of the
Red Barn Is Stanford Univer
sity.
One of the major additions to
the stable area came about ten
years ago when John Galvin, a
Woodside resident who now lives
in Ireland, donated the money
to build a covered ring. The con
struction of this ring makes
Stanford P.E. riding classes pos
sible in the wet weather of the
winter and spring quarters.
There are four categories of
P.E. classes, beginning, interme
diate, advanced, and Jumping.
The fee for each of these classes
is $45 a quarter.
Classes meet three times a
week, and about seventy-five
Stanford students also take ad
vantage of the stable facilities
by boarding their horses there.


PALO ALTO TROTTING STABLES—The red steepled barns of
Senator Stanford's breeding stables grace the background of this
early century photograph. The paddocks in the foreground were
used as grazing and trotting grounds.
Leland Stanford was a horse
man and a gambler, and al
though his money Is now all
squandered on education, his
stables still remain.
Off Junipeno Serra Boulevard,
on campus, there is a world
totally removed from the bustle
and activity which characterizes
Quad.
This world Is composed of a
big red barn, corrals, horses,
sawdust and mud. The entire
area goes by the name of the
Red Barn and encompasses fifty
four acres of land, not to be
confused with the modern res
taurant by the same name.
The history of the stables re
cords the development of a pas
sion for breeding the nation's
finest horses.
In 1879 Stanford built a min
iature track, and It soon be
came renowned as a kinder
garten of speed. His theories
of breeding and training
horses were soon adopted by
other progressive breeders.
The Senator stated, "I believe
in developing a colt's strength
with his growth. Judicious exer
cise in beneficial rather than
harmful ... My aim is to give
the greatest possible amount of
exercise without fatigue."
Today Jack Melville, who
looks much like the handsome,

weathered cowboys in Marlboro
Country has run the stable for.
two years. This means a six-day
work week. He teaches riding
classes with the aid of an assist
ant, Brooks Stephens, who is a
former Stamford coed. Seven
men are employed to maintain
the stables, and Melville owns
twenty-five of the stable's one
hundred horses himself.
Commenting on his past,
Melville said, "I have been In
terested in horses all my life.
I've worked with them all my
life, too. I had a stable In
Hyde Park, New York, for
twenty-five years. Then I
owned the Canada Stables In
Woodslde for ten years, and
now I'm here."
