# Expert Estimates Soviet VN Budget
## 
### 
The Soviet Union is pouring $5
to $6 billion a year into North
Vietnam, a senior staff mem
ber at Stanford's Hoover In
stitution estimated last Thurs
day at Grove House.
"The Soviets don't really have
an interest in stopping the Viet
nam war. It costs them relative
ly little," says Richard V. Al
len, editor of the Institution's
"Yearkbook on International
Communist Affairs."
America's deepening involve
ment in the war has caused dis
sension with our allies, divisive
ness at home, and "very serious"
lags in research and develop
ment for advanced weaponry,
Allen notes.
Following the Cuban missile
crisis, Russia realized it could
not pursue a more venturesome
foreign policy until its strate
gic power increased. It has used
the ensuing detente very well
for this purpose.
"They have not sat idly by,
and the challenge in its new
strategic expression is not be
nign."
In addition to securing an
American pledge not to invade
Cuba, the Russians benefited
from the quiet removal of U.S.
missiles based in Turkey fol
lowing the eyeball-to-eyeball con
frontation.
The Kennedy Administration
followed a "basically erroneous"
series of assumptions that 1)
the Soviet Union has as a result
of the crisis, given up it ration
ale for continuing what it calls
the "world revolutionary proc
ess," and had retreated to a pol
icy based on Realpolitik in which
'live and let live" would be the
motivating spirit; 2) consumer
demands would displace de
mands from the power sector in
the Soviet economy; and 3) a
grand alliance of the U.S. and
the U.S.S.R. could be forged to
maintain world peace and con
tain China.
This atitude toward detente
persists today, followed "half
heartedly" and "with no grand
design" by President Johnson,
Allen maintains.
"Detente — a genuine relax
ation of tensions — is to be
welcomed by everyone. But to
extrapolate the first events of
a detente and use them as the
basis for long-range policies is a
dangerous business, indeed. That
is why I hold the assumptions
to 'erroneous.' They do not fit
the events of the day.
"Although further fissures will
certainly develop within the com
munist movement, emphasis on
a bi-polar world will continue.
"There is every likelihood of
new 'wars of national libera
tion' into which the U.S. is go
ing to be drawn at times and
places not of its choosing.
"The U.S. probably will not
ever be able to devise a foreign

policy that marshals all the re
sources at its command. Hence,
the emphasis will have to be
maintaining and augmenting our
strategic power."
Allen sees "no new dyna
mism" in prospect. "Our bridges
to the East may well collapse for
lack of traffic," he predicts.
The U.S. should develop the
capacity to exploit differences
within the communist bloc,
which already has three dis
tinguishable centers — Moscow,
Peking, and Havana.
"More harm has been caused
by visceral, unreasoned, and
plain reactionary anti-oommu
nism than by the existence of
a Communist Party in this
country," he declares.
"Opposition to communism
and the strategic objectives of
communist countries is legiti
mate and justifiable on the basis
of historical experience. Rea
soned opposition to communism
is a legitimate function of our
foreign policy, because the com
munist system is one providing
for no future political change. It
is not in our national interest to
allow the expansion of such a
system."
