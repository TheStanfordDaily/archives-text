# Ail Interview At Foggy Bottom
## 'Prof' Johnson, 'Schoolboy' Rusk 
### WALTER GRANT College Press Service 
Editor's Note: Earlier this
month, Walter Grant of CPS had
a special Interview with Secre
tary of State Dean Rusk. Fol
lowing 1 Is Grant's account of the
Interview.

WASHINGTON (CPS) —
When Secretary of State Dean
Rusk talks about the war in
Vietnam, he sounds like a col
lege student who has memor
ized his professor's notes for
feedback on an exam.
Rusk reiterates the words of
his professor, Lyndon Johnson,
and he offers nothing new. If he
is asked a question for which
he either does not know the
answer, or does not want to give
it, he again plays the game of
the student; he beats around the
bush and answers something
else.
But Rusk has something go
ing for him which the average
student does not. He gets to
edit his exam after the 50 min
utes are up.
Rusk, in an interview last
week with CPS and three col
lege editors, discussed the war
in Vietnam, the role of the
United States in international af
fairs, the current conflict be
tween the U.S. and North Korea,
and how anti-war protests at
home give encouragement to
the enemy.
He said nothing he has not
said hundreds of times before.
It was impossible to pin him
down when he didn't answer a
question directly, and if a ques
tion which he had ignored was
repeated, he merely reiterated

the same old cliches which mem
bers of the Johnson Administra
tion have been repeating for
several years to justify the war.
Even so, Rusk reserved the
right to censor the text of the
interview before it was released
to the public. He did edit his
remarks, striking out the strong
est statement he made.
When the interview was over,
Rusk's aides commented that
it was wonderful. "He's an old
pro," one said. "He sure knows
how to handle himself." Another
asked, "Isn't he marvelous?"
Rusk is articulate and dedi
cated, as he would have to be to
hold the office of Secretary of
State for seven years. Complete
ly sold on the present U.S. poli
cies in Vietnam and elsewhere,
which he certainly was instru
mental in developing, Rusk
seems to enjoy defending poli
cies, but only as long as the
questions are not too pointed.
Columnist Walter Lippman
has said Rusk's "education stop
ped about 1944." Many other ex
perts also have said Rusk, as
well as the entire Johnson Ad
ministration, has a World War
II view of how to fight aggres
sion and win eternal peace for
the world.
Rusk's comments support
these analyses. The Vietnam
war, he says, is caused by North
Vietnam committing acts of ag
gression on South Vietnam, and
the only way to stop this aggres
sion is by military might. "If
they're going to fight a war...
we will be there to oppose
them," he emphasizes.
And despite the fact that the

United States is still bombing
North Vietnam, Rusk insists
that the Johnson Administration
has done all it can to encourage
negotiations to end the war.
"We're willing to negoiate,
without any conditions whatever.
We'll sit down with them, at
sundown today, to talk about
peace, without anybody doing
anything, except sit down at
the table and talk. Now they've
rejected that," he said.
"Now, the point is that Hanoi
has raised a major condition for
negotiations," Rusk said. "They
say there will be no talks until
we stop the bombing — they
usually say permanently, and
unconditionally." He emphasizes
that the United States did not
originally propose any condi
tions, but since Hanoi did, the
U.S. found it necessary to pro
pose a counter condition — that
North Vietnam not take advan
tage of the bombing pause.
In response to the suggestion
that the United States stop the
bombing without any conditions
to test Hanoi's sincerity, Rusk
said, "It's wholly irrational." He
said stopping the bombing with
out conditions could endanger
the lives of thousands of Amer
ican soldiers.
In the interview, Rusk com
mented further on the "irration
al" suggestion, but these re
marks were deleted from the

text, and the reporters, who had
agreed to abide by the edited
transcript, were unable to use
it.
Th&Secretary offers little hope
that the United States will ini
tiate more moves toward peace.
"Now, if everybody assumes
that when Hanoi says no, that's
the end of the matter, therefore
the United States must move
again, that we must somehow
take some new position, the end
of that trail is simply that we
abandon South Vietnam. We're
not going to do that."
On the question of dissent at
home against the Johnson Ad
ministration's policies, Rusk
says he has "no problem" with
free speech and free assembly,
but he emphasizes that the
"form of dissent which tries to

silence other people is something
to which I object very strongly
indeed."
Rusk also emphasizes that Ha
noi watches the debate in the
United States very closely, and
"there is no doubt that they are
encouraged by the dissent in
this country — no doubt about
it. Now, that doesn't mean that
you forget the First Amend
ment and that you try to stop
dissent, but those who are ex
pressing dissent ought to be a
ware of that."
He said he wishes anti-war
protesters "would at least try
to make it clear what it is they
want Hanoi to do to make peace.
If they will say that we want
Washington to do the following,
and we want Hanoi to do the
following, that might help."

ministration, has a World War
II view of how to fight aggres
sion and win eternal peace for
the world.
Rusk's comments support
these analyses. The Vietnam
war, he says, is caused by North
Vietnam committing acts of ag
gression on South Vietnam, and
the only way to stop this aggres
sion is by military might. "If
they're going to fight a war...
we will be there to oppose
them," he emphasizes.
And despite the fact that the

United States is still bombing
North Vietnam, Rusk insists
that the Johnson Administration
has done all it can to encourage
negotiations to end the war.
"We're willing to negoiate,
without any conditions whatever.
We'll sit down with them, at
sundown today, to talk about
peace, without anybody doing
anything, except sit down at
the table and talk. Now they've
rejected that," he said.
"Now, the point is that Hanoi
has raised a major condition for
negotiations," Rusk said. "They
say there will be no talks until
we stop the bombing — they
usually say permanently, and
unconditionally." He emphasizes
that the United States did not
originally propose any condi
tions, but since Hanoi did, the
U.S. found it necessary to pro
pose a counter condition — that
North Vietnam not take advan
tage of the bombing pause.
In response to the suggestion
that the United States stop the
bombing without any conditions
to test Hanoi's sincerity, Rusk
said, "It's wholly irrational." He
said stopping the bombing with
out conditions could endanger
the lives of thousands of Amer
ican soldiers.
In the interview, Rusk com
mented further on the "irration
al" suggestion, but these re
marks were deleted from the

text, and the reporters, who had
agreed to abide by the edited
transcript, were unable to use
it.
Th&Secretary offers little hope
that the United States will ini
tiate more moves toward peace.
"Now, if everybody assumes
that when Hanoi says no, that's
the end of the matter, therefore
the United States must move
again, that we must somehow
take some new position, the end
of that trail is simply that we
abandon South Vietnam. We're
not going to do that."
On the question of dissent at
home against the Johnson Ad
ministration's policies, Rusk
says he has "no problem" with
free speech and free assembly,
but he emphasizes that the
"form of dissent which tries to

silence other people is something
to which I object very strongly
indeed."
Rusk also emphasizes that Ha
noi watches the debate in the
United States very closely, and
"there is no doubt that they are
encouraged by the dissent in
this country — no doubt about
it. Now, that doesn't mean that
you forget the First Amend
ment and that you try to stop
dissent, but those who are ex
pressing dissent ought to be a
ware of that."
He said he wishes anti-war
protesters "would at least try
to make it clear what it is they
want Hanoi to do to make peace.
If they will say that we want
Washington to do the following,
and we want Hanoi to do the
following, that might help."
Editor's Note: Earlier this
month, Walter Grant of CPS had
a special Interview with Secre
tary of State Dean Rusk. Fol
lowing 1 Is Grant's account of the
Interview.

WASHINGTON (CPS) —
When Secretary of State Dean
Rusk talks about the war in
Vietnam, he sounds like a col
lege student who has memor
ized his professor's notes for
feedback on an exam.
Rusk reiterates the words of
his professor, Lyndon Johnson,
and he offers nothing new. If he
is asked a question for which
he either does not know the
answer, or does not want to give
it, he again plays the game of
the student; he beats around the
bush and answers something
else.
But Rusk has something go
ing for him which the average
student does not. He gets to
edit his exam after the 50 min
utes are up.
Rusk, in an interview last
week with CPS and three col
lege editors, discussed the war
in Vietnam, the role of the
United States in international af
fairs, the current conflict be
tween the U.S. and North Korea,
and how anti-war protests at
home give encouragement to
the enemy.
He said nothing he has not
said hundreds of times before.
It was impossible to pin him
down when he didn't answer a
question directly, and if a ques
tion which he had ignored was
repeated, he merely reiterated

the same old cliches which mem
bers of the Johnson Administra
tion have been repeating for
several years to justify the war.
Even so, Rusk reserved the
right to censor the text of the
interview before it was released
to the public. He did edit his
remarks, striking out the strong
est statement he made.
When the interview was over,
Rusk's aides commented that
it was wonderful. "He's an old
pro," one said. "He sure knows
how to handle himself." Another
asked, "Isn't he marvelous?"
Rusk is articulate and dedi
cated, as he would have to be to
hold the office of Secretary of
State for seven years. Complete
ly sold on the present U.S. poli
cies in Vietnam and elsewhere,
which he certainly was instru
mental in developing, Rusk
seems to enjoy defending poli
cies, but only as long as the
questions are not too pointed.
Columnist Walter Lippman
has said Rusk's "education stop
ped about 1944." Many other ex

noi watches the debate in the
United States very closely, and
"there is no doubt that they are
encouraged by the dissent in
this country — no doubt about
it. Now, that doesn't mean that
you forget the First Amend
ment and that you try to stop
dissent, but those who are ex
pressing dissent ought to be a
ware of that."
He said he wishes anti-war
protesters "would at least try
to make it clear what it is they
want Hanoi to do to make peace.
If they will say that we want
Washington to do the following,
and we want Hanoi to do the

Editor's Note: Earlier this
month, Walter Grant of CPS had
a special Interview with Secre
tary of State Dean Rusk. Fol
lowing 1 Is Grant's account of the
Interview.

WASHINGTON (CPS) —
When Secretary of State Dean
Rusk talks about the war in
Vietnam, he sounds like a col
lege student who has memor
ized his professor's notes for
feedback on an exam.
Rusk reiterates the words of
his professor, Lyndon Johnson,
and he offers nothing new. If he
is asked a question for which
he either does not know the
answer, or does not want to give
it, he again plays the game of
the student; he beats around the
bush and answers something
else.
But Rusk has something go
ing for him which the average
student does not. He gets to
edit his exam after the 50 min
utes are up.
Rusk, in an interview last
week with CPS and three col
lege editors, discussed the war
in Vietnam, the role of the
United States in international af
fairs, the current conflict be
tween the U.S. and North Korea,
and how anti-war protests at
home give encouragement to
the enemy.
He said nothing he has not
said hundreds of times before.
It was impossible to pin him
down when he didn't answer a
question directly, and if a ques
tion which he had ignored was
repeated, he merely reiterated

the same old cliches which mem
bers of the Johnson Administra
tion have been repeating for
several years to justify the war.
Even so, Rusk reserved the
right to censor the text of the
interview before it was released
to the public. He did edit his
remarks, striking out the strong
est statement he made.
When the interview was over,
Rusk's aides commented that
it was wonderful. "He's an old
pro," one said. "He sure knows
how to handle himself." Another
asked, "Isn't he marvelous?"
Rusk is articulate and dedi
cated, as he would have to be to
hold the office of Secretary of
State for seven years. Complete
ly sold on the present U.S. poli
cies in Vietnam and elsewhere,
which he certainly was instru
mental in developing, Rusk
seems to enjoy defending poli
cies, but only as long as the
questions are not too pointed.
Columnist Walter Lippman
has said Rusk's "education stop
ped about 1944." Many other ex
perts also have said Rusk, as
well as the entire Johnson Ad
ministration, has a World War
II view of how to fight aggres
sion and win eternal peace for
the world.
Rusk's comments support
these analyses. The Vietnam
war, he says, is caused by North
Vietnam committing acts of ag
gression on South Vietnam, and
the only way to stop this aggres
sion is by military might. "If
they're going to fight a war...
we will be there to oppose
them," he emphasizes.
And despite the fact that the

United States is still bombing
North Vietnam, Rusk insists
that the Johnson Administration
has done all it can to encourage
negotiations to end the war.
"We're willing to negoiate,
without any conditions whatever.
We'll sit down with them, at
sundown today, to talk about
peace, without anybody doing
anything, except sit down at
the table and talk. Now they've
rejected that," he said.
"Now, the point is that Hanoi
has raised a major condition for
negotiations," Rusk said. "They
say there will be no talks until
we stop the bombing — they
usually say permanently, and
unconditionally." He emphasizes
that the United States did not
originally propose any condi
tions, but since Hanoi did, the
U.S. found it necessary to pro
pose a counter condition — that
North Vietnam not take advan
tage of the bombing pause.
In response to the suggestion
that the United States stop the
bombing without any conditions
to test Hanoi's sincerity, Rusk
said, "It's wholly irrational." He
said stopping the bombing with
out conditions could endanger
the lives of thousands of Amer
ican soldiers.
In the interview, Rusk com
mented further on the "irration
al" suggestion, but these re
marks were deleted from the

text, and the reporters, who had
agreed to abide by the edited
transcript, were unable to use
it.
Th&Secretary offers little hope
that the United States will ini
tiate more moves toward peace.
"Now, if everybody assumes
that when Hanoi says no, that's
the end of the matter, therefore
the United States must move
again, that we must somehow
take some new position, the end
of that trail is simply that we
abandon South Vietnam. We're
not going to do that."
On the question of dissent at
home against the Johnson Ad
ministration's policies, Rusk
says he has "no problem" with
free speech and free assembly,
but he emphasizes that the
"form of dissent which tries to

silence other people is something
to which I object very strongly
indeed."
Rusk also emphasizes that Ha
noi watches the debate in the
United States very closely, and
"there is no doubt that they are
encouraged by the dissent in
this country — no doubt about
it. Now, that doesn't mean that
you forget the First Amend

dissent, but those who are ex
pressing dissent ought to be a
