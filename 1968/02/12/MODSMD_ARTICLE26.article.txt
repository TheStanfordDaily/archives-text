# Spring Fashions For Coeds Shown
## 
### 
Fashions for coeds this spring
will feature epaulettes and brass
trim, sophisticated Mao collars,
tunic coats, and pleats and
blouson gatherings of both skirts
and tops. Ostrich feathers and
lace will encircle hems for eve
ning wear.
Many of these trends were
seen in the Geoffry Beene spring
collection, recently shown at
Saks Fifth Avenue, in the Stan
ford Shopping Center.
Brief frosted taupe wool
dresses, with epaulettes and long
cuffed sleeves and buttons
descending half-way down the
front emanate verve and gusto.
More buttons trim the side
pockets where the skirt begins
to ease from unpressed inverted
pleats at the back.
Seam lines often fall into sup
ple inverted pleats in Beene's
collection. They are seen in pale,
sleeveless wool, ginger linen with
a half cap sleeve, navy or white
wool and for evening in black
silk with white crepe collar and
sleeves, the high pleats suggest
ing a raised waistline.
The waist reappears under
m silk blouson top, rippling
Into Infinite knife pleats com
plimented with full, cuffed
sleeves and a high neck. Short
versions are in pink with a
black belt, or in blue top,
taupe skirt and red suede belt,
the midi version replaces the
swishing pleats with a gentle
drlndl.
The bright yellow silk ends in
inch wide tiers at just mid-calf.

This new length suggests a
mood of a sweet old-fashioned
girl, innocent and covered up,
yet in a world of short skirts
only a woman of immagination
and poise to set trends will wear
It.
For daytime, pin stripes of
white on navy, done in a double
breasted suit, recall the fast,
free life of the ganster era.
Wide lapels, long jacket and re
laxed sleeves will be the fashion.
Beene uses green and white
plaid wool or brown-on-white
cotton squares.
A longer top, fuller sleeves,
wide Mao collar and patch pock
ets at the hip effect a tunic look
when put over fluid accordion
pleats. All in textured gray wool
or, for fun, in brisk red silk
over full white satin shorts, the
Beene shirt look has no trace of
masculinity.
A fluid look is maintained by
letting belts step in and out of
the dress, showing only an inch
at a time. In hardware Beene
often trades brass for rhine
stone chains, creating an old
fashioned watch chain image,
reminiscent of former eras when
delicate women were sheltered
from the world. This era is seen
in a cotton hostess suit of small
black and white checks, com
plete with watch chain and cut
away jacket.
The Christian Dior spring col
lection will be presented by
Saks all day Tuesday February
13, in the Gown Salon, and Don
ald Brooks will be shown on
February 22nd.
