# Cagers Smash Huskies For Weekend Split
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Rebounding from a tough loss
to Washington State Friday,
Stanford overwhelmed the
Washington Huskies 97-75 Satur
day night in a fantastic team ef
fort.
Washington State handed the
Indians their fourth straight
conference loss Friday night,
holding off an inspired second
half rally by the home club to
post a 74-71 triumph.
Stanford battled the much tall
er WSU quintet on even terms
for most of the game, but ex
cessive fouling and their own
inadequacy from the foul line
cost the Indians the game.
Both 6-5 junior Mai McElwain
and 6-6 soph Steve Kuchenbeck
er foulded out, while scoring ace
Art Harris was forced to sit out
eight minutes in foul trouble.
WSU hit 24 of 33 free throws,
while the Indians converted only
13 of 23.

The visitors pulled away
with a 10-1 blitz early In the
second half. Holding a slim
44-41 lead with three minutes
gone in the final stanza, the
heavily • favored Cougars
buried four straight jumpers
and two free-throws while
Stanford could manage only a
Steve Kuchenbecker free
throw. After that the Tribe
was forced to play catchup.
Coach Howie Dallmar's club
struggled gamely to close the
gap, but each time they got with
in striking distance, WSU would
pull away again. With big (6-
9%) Jim McKean threading
sweeping hooks and baseline
jumpers, and little (5-11) Ray
Stein hitting 20-foot jumpers
from the top of the key, the
Cougars held on for the win.
The closest Stanford got in
the final 10 minutes was at the
final buzzer, when Harris

canned a 30-foot jumper to make
it 74-71.
Harris, who tallied the Tribe's
first seven points and their last
four, led all scorers with 24. Mc-
Kean paced the winners with 18,
while Stein chipped in with 14.
Saturday night the Indians
(now 2-4 in Pacific-8 competi
tion) utilized a surprising re
bounding advantage and deadly
outside shooting to outclass the
favored Huskies.
The only time Stanford trailed
was in the oponing two minutes,
when Washington grabbed a
quick 4-0 lead. The Indians im
mediately erased it with seven
straight points, and were never
headed thereafter.
The Tribe advantage fluc
tuated between five and ten
throughout most of the half.
With Mai McEhvain dominat
ing the boards, Gary Peters
meyer hitting two three-point
plays off beautiful ehange-of

pace drives, and Harris, Chuck
Moore and Don Griffin all
scorching the nets from the
outside, the Indians took a 41-
34 edge Into the dressing
room.
The lead mushroomed to 13 in
the opening moments of the sec
ond half when Griffin funneled a
jumper and a layin, and Harris
converted two fnee-throws to
make it 47-34. Five minutes
later, the Indians widened the
gap to 19 on jumpers by Moore
and Petersmeyer and a Kuchen
becker tip-in.
Petersmeyer personally ac
counted for six straight points
midway through the final half
by turning two thefts and a
stolen rebound into three Stan
ford buckets. Over seven min
utes remained when Petersmey

er left the contest, having scored
18 points, made numerous steals,
and contributed some great as
sists. The crowd responded with
a standing ovation.
The Huskies never got closer
than 17 in the final 10 minutes
of play, as Griffin, Moore and
Harris continued their torrid
shooting. The Indians shot 55
per cent for the game, 60 per,
cent in the second half on 24 for
40.
Griffin, who appears to have
come out of a shooting slump
which plagued him through
out the first half of the season,
hit seven of his eight field
goal attempts In an amazing
display.
The 6-4 Harris again led all
scorers with 22 points, netting 8
of 12 shots from the floor. Soph

Moore played a great all-around
game, hitting 8 of his 12 field
goal attempts and hauling in 7
rebounds.
Stanford had a 56 32 rebound
ing edge, due largely to McEl
wain and Kuchenbecker. Despite
battling Husky foes of 6-9 and
6-5 on the boards, McElwain and
Kuchenbecker coralled 16 and 9
rebounds, respectively.

Rebounding from a tough loss
to Washington State Friday,
Stanford overwhelmed the
Washington Huskies 97-75 Satur
day night in a fantastic team ef
fort.
Washington State handed the
Indians their fourth straight
conference loss Friday night,
holding off an inspired second
half rally by the home club to
post a 74-71 triumph.
Stanford battled the much tall
er WSU quintet on even terms
for most of the game, but ex
cessive fouling and their own
inadequacy from the foul line
cost the Indians the game.
Both 6-5 junior Mai McElwain
and 6-6 soph Steve Kuchenbeck
er foulded out, while scoring ace
Art Harris was forced to sit out
eight minutes in foul trouble.
WSU hit 24 of 33 free throws,
while the Indians converted only
13 of 23.

The visitors pulled away
with a 10-1 blitz early In the
second half. Holding a slim
44-41 lead with three minutes
gone in the final stanza, the
heavily • favored Cougars
buried four straight jumpers
and two free-throws while
Stanford could manage only a
Steve Kuchenbecker free
throw. After that the Tribe
was forced to play catchup.
Coach Howie Dallmar's club
struggled gamely to close the
gap, but each time they got with
in striking distance, WSU would
pull away again. With big (6-
9%) Jim McKean threading
sweeping hooks and baseline
jumpers, and little (5-11) Ray
Stein hitting 20-foot jumpers
from the top of the key, the
Cougars held on for the win.
The closest Stanford got in
the final 10 minutes was at the
final buzzer, when Harris

canned a 30-foot jumper to make
it 74-71.
Harris, who tallied the Tribe's
first seven points and their last
four, led all scorers with 24. Mc-
Kean paced the winners with 18,
while Stein chipped in with 14.
Saturday night the Indians
(now 2-4 in Pacific-8 competi
tion) utilized a surprising re
bounding advantage and deadly
outside shooting to outclass the
favored Huskies.
The only time Stanford trailed
was in the oponing two minutes,
when Washington grabbed a
quick 4-0 lead. The Indians im
mediately erased it with seven
straight points, and were never
headed thereafter.
The Tribe advantage fluc
tuated between five and ten
throughout most of the half.
With Mai McEhvain dominat
ing the boards, Gary Peters
meyer hitting two three-point
plays off beautiful ehange-of

pace drives, and Harris, Chuck
Moore and Don Griffin all
scorching the nets from the
outside, the Indians took a 41-
34 edge Into the dressing
room.
The lead mushroomed to 13 in
the opening moments of the sec
ond half when Griffin funneled a
jumper and a layin, and Harris
converted two fnee-throws to

Rebounding from a tough loss
to Washington State Friday,
Stanford overwhelmed the
Washington Huskies 97-75 Satur
day night in a fantastic team ef
fort.
Washington State handed the
Indians their fourth straight
conference loss Friday night,
holding off an inspired second
half rally by the home club to
post a 74-71 triumph.
Stanford battled the much tall
er WSU quintet on even terms
for most of the game, but ex
cessive fouling and their own
inadequacy from the foul line
cost the Indians the game.
Both 6-5 junior Mai McElwain
and 6-6 soph Steve Kuchenbeck
er foulded out, while scoring ace
Art Harris was forced to sit out
eight minutes in foul trouble.
WSU hit 24 of 33 free throws,
while the Indians converted only
13 of 23.

The visitors pulled away
with a 10-1 blitz early In the
second half. Holding a slim
44-41 lead with three minutes
gone in the final stanza, the
heavily • favored Cougars
buried four straight jumpers
and two free-throws while
Stanford could manage only a
Steve Kuchenbecker free
throw. After that the Tribe
was forced to play catchup.
Coach Howie Dallmar's club
struggled gamely to close the
gap, but each time they got with
in striking distance, WSU would
pull away again. With big (6-
9%) Jim McKean threading
sweeping hooks and baseline
jumpers, and little (5-11) Ray
Stein hitting 20-foot jumpers
from the top of the key, the
Cougars held on for the win.
The closest Stanford got in
the final 10 minutes was at the
final buzzer, when Harris

canned a 30-foot jumper to make
it 74-71.
Harris, who tallied the Tribe's
first seven points and their last
four, led all scorers with 24. Mc-
Kean paced the winners with 18,
while Stein chipped in with 14.
Saturday night the Indians
(now 2-4 in Pacific-8 competi
tion) utilized a surprising re
bounding advantage and deadly
outside shooting to outclass the
favored Huskies.
The only time Stanford trailed
was in the oponing two minutes,
when Washington grabbed a
quick 4-0 lead. The Indians im
mediately erased it with seven
straight points, and were never
headed thereafter.
The Tribe advantage fluc
tuated between five and ten
throughout most of the half.
With Mai McEhvain dominat
ing the boards, Gary Peters
meyer hitting two three-point
plays off beautiful ehange-of

pace drives, and Harris, Chuck
Moore and Don Griffin all
scorching the nets from the
outside, the Indians took a 41-
34 edge Into the dressing
room.
The lead mushroomed to 13 in
the opening moments of the sec
ond half when Griffin funneled a
jumper and a layin, and Harris
converted two fnee-throws to
make it 47-34. Five minutes
later, the Indians widened the
gap to 19 on jumpers by Moore
and Petersmeyer and a Kuchen
becker tip-in.
Petersmeyer personally ac
counted for six straight points
midway through the final half
by turning two thefts and a
stolen rebound into three Stan
ford buckets. Over seven min
utes remained when Petersmey

er left the contest, having scored
18 points, made numerous steals,
and contributed some great as
sists. The crowd responded with
a standing ovation.
The Huskies never got closer
than 17 in the final 10 minutes
of play, as Griffin, Moore and
Harris continued their torrid
shooting. The Indians shot 55
per cent for the game, 60 per,
cent in the second half on 24 for
40.
Griffin, who appears to have
come out of a shooting slump
which plagued him through
out the first half of the season,
hit seven of his eight field
goal attempts In an amazing
display.
The 6-4 Harris again led all
scorers with 22 points, netting 8
of 12 shots from the floor. Soph

Moore played a great all-around
game, hitting 8 of his 12 field
goal attempts and hauling in 7
rebounds.
Stanford had a 56 32 rebound
ing edge, due largely to McEl
wain and Kuchenbecker. Despite
battling Husky foes of 6-9 and
6-5 on the boards, McElwain and
Kuchenbecker coralled 16 and 9
rebounds, respectively.

Saturday night the Indians
(now 2-4 in Pacific-8 competi
tion) utilized a surprising re
bounding advantage and deadly
outside shooting to outclass the
favored Huskies.

was in the oponing two minutes,
when Washington grabbed a
quick 4-0 lead. The Indians im
mediately erased it with seven
straight points, and were never
headed thereafter.

tuated between five and ten
throughout most of the half.
With Mai McEhvain dominat
ing the boards, Gary Peters
meyer hitting two three-point
plays off beautiful ehange-of

pace drives, and Harris, Chuck

gap to 19 on jumpers by Moore
and Petersmeyer and a Kuchen
becker tip-in.

er left the contest, having scored
18 points, made numerous steals,
and contributed some great as
sists. The crowd responded with
a standing ovation.

of play, as Griffin, Moore and
Harris continued their torrid
shooting. The Indians shot 55
per cent for the game, 60 per,
cent in the second half on 24 for

come out of a shooting slump
which plagued him through
out the first half of the season,
hit seven of his eight field
goal attempts In an amazing
display.

scorers with 22 points, netting 8
of 12 shots from the floor. Soph

Moore played a great all-around

Rebounding from a tough loss
to Washington State Friday,
Stanford overwhelmed the
Washington Huskies 97-75 Satur
day night in a fantastic team ef
fort.
Washington State handed the
Indians their fourth straight
conference loss Friday night,
holding off an inspired second
half rally by the home club to
post a 74-71 triumph.
Stanford battled the much tall
er WSU quintet on even terms
for most of the game, but ex
cessive fouling and their own
inadequacy from the foul line
cost the Indians the game.
Both 6-5 junior Mai McElwain
and 6-6 soph Steve Kuchenbeck
er foulded out, while scoring ace
Art Harris was forced to sit out
eight minutes in foul trouble.
WSU hit 24 of 33 free throws,
while the Indians converted only
13 of 23.

The visitors pulled away
with a 10-1 blitz early In the
second half. Holding a slim
44-41 lead with three minutes
gone in the final stanza, the
heavily • favored Cougars
buried four straight jumpers
and two free-throws while
Stanford could manage only a
Steve Kuchenbecker free
throw. After that the Tribe
was forced to play catchup.
Coach Howie Dallmar's club
struggled gamely to close the
gap, but each time they got with
in striking distance, WSU would
pull away again. With big (6-
9%) Jim McKean threading
sweeping hooks and baseline
jumpers, and little (5-11) Ray
Stein hitting 20-foot jumpers
from the top of the key, the
Cougars held on for the win.
The closest Stanford got in
the final 10 minutes was at the
final buzzer, when Harris

canned a 30-foot jumper to make
it 74-71.
Harris, who tallied the Tribe's
first seven points and their last
four, led all scorers with 24. Mc-
Kean paced the winners with 18,
while Stein chipped in with 14.
