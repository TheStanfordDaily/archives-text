# Stern Residences Host Industrialist
## 
### 
Arnold H. Maremont, presi
dent of Maremont Corporation
of Chicago and outspoken advo
cate of the position that busi
ness' main function is creating a
profit for its shareholders, will
be at Stanford today, Tuesday

and Wednesday as a Stern-
Guest-in-Residence.
The Midwestern industrialist
—who has participated in an im
pressive number of public social
actions in his private life—
speaks today at 12-noon in the
business school Auditorium on
the subject, "Le Defi Americain"
("The American Challenge," a
widely discussed book on U.S.
technological and financial in
roads in Europe).
Maremont will debate Califor
nia financier Bart Lytton on the
topic, "The Social Responsibility
of Business—Vice or Virtue?" at
12-noon on Wednnsday in Dink
elspiel Auditorium.
Maremont, whose corporation
is an automotive parts and
equipment supplier, has long
been active in planned parent
hood, fair, employment legisla
tion, mental health, problems of
the aged, art, music and drama.
However, he sees his active so
cial role as distinct from his
business pursuits.
"Let business stick to making
money . . . government to regu
lating business . . . and manage
ment, as private citizens ... to
contributing their time, talent,
and abilities in areas of social
action," he maintains.
"It is to me the sheerest hypo
crisy for the man in business to
try to create an image of corpo
rate responsibility for the well
being of society . . . while at
the same time, as a private citi
zen, to completely ignore these
responsibilities," Maremont con
tinued.
Maremont is wary of the mo
tives behind corporations which
undertake broad social pro
grams. "The business manage
ment that wants to improve its
corporate image in the area of
social responsibility is, at the
level of the private citizen, hard
ly ever found in the ranks of
those concerned with and active
in these areas such as civil
rights, welfare, public housing,
and similar activities," he point
ed out in a recent speech.
Lytton, president of Lytton
Savings and Loan Association,
is well known as a forwarder of
cultural and social concerns both
as a private citizen and through
his corporation. He established
the Lytton Centers of the Visual
Arts in connection with his
buildings in Los Angeles, Palo
Alto, Pomona, and Oakland.
