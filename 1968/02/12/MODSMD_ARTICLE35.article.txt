# Grapplers Crush San Jose State As Borchers, Suttle Score Falls
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
The Indian grapplers crushed
Sari Jose State Saturday night
in Encina Gym by the impres
sive score of 27-8. Even at that,
the Spartans were lucky to ac
quire eight points — Stanford
gave San Jose five points by
forfeiting the 130 pound weight
class.
Standout athletes for the tribe
were John Suttle in the 152
pound class and Len Borchers
at 160—both won their victor
ies by unmercifully pinning
their opponents from the South
to the mat.
Borchers, co-captain of the
Stanford team, displayed a

profound knowledge of holds
and the ability to react quick
ly. Suttle also had llghtenlng
quick reactions and a great
deal of strength.
Early in the match Stanford's
John Hazelton wasted no time
in showing his adversary who
was boss. He won the 123 pound
class by a commanding score of
9-3. An extremely interesting
match was between Stanford's
Jerry Beaudoin and Steve Voll
mer of San Jose. Beaodoin won
the match 8-5, but that almost
could have been predicted when
early in the first period he
picked Vollmer off the mat and

held him in mid air lor over
twenty seconds.
At 145 pounds the Cards
suffered a slight setback when
Brian Smith lost to John Wall
brink in a close match, 3-1.
Bert Ambler succeeded in
dominating his San Jose rival
to the extent of another well
earned 8-5 victory. At 177
pounds, Indian Bud Holling
berry consistently ground
Roger McClaurhy of San Jose
into the mat, achievelng an
8-3 triumph.
Both teams had previously
been pitted against relatively
strong teams. Stanford's dual
meet record before Saturday's
match was 2-8; San Jose's was

1-6. The Indians will have one
final chance to prepare for the
AAWU conference meet when
they confront Cal at Berkeley
next Friday night at 8:30 p.m.
