# Practicality Sought In ASSU Leaders
## 
### 
Roy Weatherup, ASSU candi
date for vice president, last
night called for an end to stu
dent leaders who "talk in ab
stractions." Speaking in the
Branner lounge, he also called
for several constitutional
amendments that would re
shape the student legislature
(LASSU).
Weatherup criticized activists
who "by wanting to do so much,
forget the limited things that
ASSU can do." Many students,
he said, fail to attend committee
meetings or become frustrated
with the slow governmental
processes. As a result, "many
leaders like Harris and Lyman
quit."
In addition to these problems,
Weatherup maintains that the
administration has lost confi
dence in ASSU because of its
handling of the CIA demonstra
tions. In this case the Judicial
Committee had originally re
fused to try the students ac
cused of demonstrating.
He also criticized Peter Ly
man's appointees to the Com
mittee of 15. All five, said
Weatherup, were too radical
to accurately reflect the stu
dent body. "If we ever want
to get concessions from the
administrations, we have to
reason with them as we did
before Harris," he stated.
Weatherup insists solutions to
many of ASSU's problems could
be provided if several constitu
tional amendments were made.

First, "all candidates for ASSU
offices should have held prev
ious offices in student govern
ment." This would prevent
"radicals without any exper
ience from coming in out of the
blue."
Second, LASSU representa
tives should send substitutes if
they cannot attend a session.
Weatherup also advocated "kick
ing anyone out who misses two
straight meetings." The present
rule provides for expulsion in
the event of three missed meet
ings.
Third, he proposed that
LASSU be reduced from its
present size of around 160 to
near 70. The number of off
campus representatives should
be more proportionate to the
number of offcampus students
that vote.
"However, my main reason
for running is to expose
what's going on, which is
nothing. The vice-president
has two functions: to succeed
the president and to be an ex
offioio member of all boards.
"It's not a very inspiring job
to sit at all these meetings. And
none of my opponents seem
aware of the limitations of the
post. They have a lot of ideas
which they will have little
power to accomplish."
Weatherup will speak again
Wednesday night at 7 in Cedro
lounge, Wilbur. His topic will
be "The Student Government
Farce: New Myths and Old
Realities."
