## 
### 
Last Friday 52 Stanford bio
chemists sent a telegram to
Sen. Thomas Kuchel (R.-Calif.)
protesting U.S. demolition of
the Vietnamese city of Ben Tre.
"We wish to register our hor
ror at the destruction of the
city of Ben Tre," the message
said. It was signed by faculty,
research personnel, and gradu
ate students in the University's
biochemistry department.
"We consider this senseless
loss of civilian life completely
unjustifiable," the statement
continued.
The Associated Press reported
Wednesday that U.S. jets and
artillery, intent on driving out
Viet Cong raiders, destroyed 85
per cent of the city and its en
virons. U.S. advisers said as
many as 1,000 civilians may
have been killed, along with 451
Viet Cong.
"We urge you to intervene to
prevent continuation of such
military tactics, which can only
lead to the ultimate destruction
of the Vietnamese people," the
biochemists requested Kuchel.
The entire department faculty
signed the telegram, including
Prof. Arthur Kornberg, the
Nobel Laureate who announced
the synthesis of biologically ac
tive DNA last December. Eigh

teen of the signatories are for
eign citizens.
The biochemists urged Kuchel
to "seek a political solution to
the war in Vietnam by negotia
tion." Kuchel is a candidate for
re-election to the Senate this
year.
The telegram's signers are:

Last Friday 52 Stanford bio
chemists sent a telegram to
Sen. Thomas Kuchel (R.-Calif.)
protesting U.S. demolition of
the Vietnamese city of Ben Tre.
"We wish to register our hor
ror at the destruction of the
city of Ben Tre," the message
said. It was signed by faculty,
research personnel, and gradu
ate students in the University's
biochemistry department.
"We consider this senseless
loss of civilian life completely
unjustifiable," the statement
continued.
The Associated Press reported
Wednesday that U.S. jets and
artillery, intent on driving out
Viet Cong raiders, destroyed 85
per cent of the city and its en
virons. U.S. advisers said as
many as 1,000 civilians may
have been killed, along with 451
Viet Cong.
"We urge you to intervene to
prevent continuation of such
military tactics, which can only
lead to the ultimate destruction
of the Vietnamese people," the
biochemists requested Kuchel.
The entire department faculty
signed the telegram, including
Prof. Arthur Kornberg, the
Nobel Laureate who announced
the synthesis of biologically ac
tive DNA last December. Eigh

teen of the signatories are for
eign citizens.
The biochemists urged Kuchel
to "seek a political solution to
the war in Vietnam by negotia
tion." Kuchel is a candidate for
re-election to the Senate this
year.
The telegram's signers are:
Mr. and Mrs. Vasuhiro Anraku, Rich
ard Atkinson, Robert L. Baldwin, Prter
