# ASSU's Problems Blamed On Apathy
## 
### 
The root of student govern
ment's problems today is not
its structure but the student's
own apathy, according to an
ASSU vice presidential candi
date.
Senior biology major Skip
Tammany, speaking in White
Plaza Friday, said, "A new
ASSU constitrtion isn't any bet
ter than an old one when it's
the students themselves who are
going to make or break that
system.
"We should work on trying
to change ideas or we should
work to try and instill excite
ment in people, rather than
spend our time for the next
two or three months changing
the constitution," Tammany
said.
Tammany noted, as an index
of student apathy, the size of
his White Plaza audience—about
25 persons.
He said there were two main
points in his platform, which
would concentrate "on a few
key changes that can be imple
mented before we leave."
The first is to revise the Gen
eral Studies program to allow
students more freedom of
choice, a project already being
considered by SES.
The second is "to try to re
vise and revamp the advisor
program at Stanford," Tam
many said. He said the stated
purpose of faculty advisors is

to provide "friendly and reliable
counsel," but added, "Now I
personally have experience on
neither of these points."
Tammany also attacked what
he called the hypocrisy of the
Fundamental Standard, the gen
eral code of student conduct. "I
think that the Fundamental
Standard, as it is stated, is some
thing that is demanded of every
body in this country, be they
students or be they workers,"
he said.
In his campaign literature,
Tammany has called for abol
ishing the student Judicial
Council, dropping academic
crodit for the military sciences
(ROTC), reducing the size of
the student legislature, admit
ting more Negroes to Stanford
and installing a "Centrex" tele
phone system in student resi
dences on campus.
Tammany was also highly
critical of SES ("Purpose of
University education poorly de
fined, if at all."), Stanford's for
eign campuses ("American
ghettoes"), Tresidder Union
("cold and impersonal"), the
present grading system "a form
of coercion") and Stanford in
general ("basically a trade
school").
He said he thinks ASSU is
"an extension of the administra
tion's in loco parentis role. The
administration has students en
forcing their regulations and
their rules," he said.

thing that is demanded of every
body in this country, be they
students or be they workers,"
he said.
In his campaign literature,
Tammany has called for abol
ishing the student Judicial
Council, dropping academic
crodit for the military sciences
(ROTC), reducing the size of
the student legislature, admit
ting more Negroes to Stanford
and installing a "Centrex" tele
phone system in student resi
dences on campus.
Tammany was also highly
critical of SES ("Purpose of
University education poorly de
fined, if at all."), Stanford's for
eign campuses ("American
ghettoes"), Tresidder Union
("cold and impersonal"), the
present grading system "a form
of coercion") and Stanford in
general ("basically a trade
school").
He said he thinks ASSU is
"an extension of the administra
tion's in loco parentis role. The
administration has students en
forcing their regulations and
their rules," he said.
The root of student govern
ment's problems today is not
its structure but the student's
own apathy, according to an
ASSU vice presidential candi
date.
Senior biology major Skip
Tammany, speaking in White
Plaza Friday, said, "A new
ASSU constitrtion isn't any bet
ter than an old one when it's
the students themselves who are
going to make or break that
system.
"We should work on trying
to change ideas or we should
work to try and instill excite
ment in people, rather than
spend our time for the next
two or three months changing
the constitution," Tammany
said.
Tammany noted, as an index
of student apathy, the size of
his White Plaza audience—about
25 persons.
He said there were two main
points in his platform, which
would concentrate "on a few
key changes that can be imple
mented before we leave."
The first is to revise the Gen
eral Studies program to allow
students more freedom of
choice, a project already being
considered by SES.
The second is "to try to re
vise and revamp the advisor
program at Stanford," Tam
many said. He said the stated
purpose of faculty advisors is

to provide "friendly and reliable
counsel," but added, "Now I
personally have experience on
neither of these points."
Tammany also attacked what
he called the hypocrisy of the
Fundamental Standard, the gen
eral code of student conduct. "I
think that the Fundamental
Standard, as it is stated, is some
thing that is demanded of every
body in this country, be they
students or be they workers,"
he said.
