"Movies are belter than ever."
When Hollywood coined that promotional phrase some
years ago. television was just coming into its own. movie
audiences had dwindled, and films themselves seemed
sillier than ever. The slogan, regarded in some quarters
as wishful thinking, occasioned no little merriment. But
nowadays, nobody's laughing.
For while the theatre is declared moribund (again),
and television is not regarded as worthy of considera
tion. movies are better than ever. At least, more people
than ever before go to them, talk about them and take
them seriously. Public interest extends to all kinds of
movies — underground, overground, homemade, foreign,
new wave, old ripple, The Sound of Music, and liloic-Up.
It has been said of everyone, from Shakespeare to
Brecht: "If he were working today, he'd be working in
movies."
On the theory that, Marshall McLuhan notwithstand
ing, people who enjoy seeing and talking about movies
would also enjoy reading and knowing more about them,
an international publishing venture called ('.inertia
World h been launched. The plan is for a series of
definitive, lively, copiously-illustrated, .jargon-free crit
ical studies of individual directors and actors, discus
sions of national cinemas and kinds of movies, and ex
planations of the movie-making process. The first three
volumes in the series, published in paperback at $2.!).")
each (and in hard covers at $4,051 are:
Jean-Luc (lodard, by Richard Roud. A study of the
connecting themes and ideas in the work of the contro
versial French director whose Rreathlcss led the "new
wave."
Losey on Losey\ edited and introduced by Tom Milne.
The American director comments on his own work,
from The Boy with Green Hair to The Serrant and
Accident.
Luchino Visconti, by Geoffrey Nowell-Smith. An
analysis of the director whose products extend from the
neo-realism of Rocco and His Brothers to the rococo of
The Leopard.
Other books to be published in the series this year
include Robin Wood on Howard llaicks, John Ward on
Alain liesnais, and The Mew Wave, edited by Peter
Graham. Always, we hope Cinema World will till the
gap between the heavy technical tomes and the fantasy
of movie fan magazines. The latter, incidentally, are
responsible for a satire called Mmmm . . . It's Jnicii
which appears, along with hundreds of other pieces, in
Max Shulman's (,uided Tour of ('.ampus Humor (,$4.05,
hardbound). This is a king-size collection of the best
stories, articles, jokes, poems, and nonsense compiled
from 65 college humor magazines over half a century. If
this hilarious book proves anything, it's that college
humor is as funny as ever.
