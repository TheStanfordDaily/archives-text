# Candidate Calls S. U. Apathetic
## 
### 
Students have to learn again
"that we can have an effect on
our environment," according to
an ASSU vice presidential can
didate.
Sociology graduate Barry As
kinas said yesterday the main
problem facing student govern
ment is student apathy. And he
blamed this directly on the Viet
nam war.
"Long-term issues fade in com
parison," he said. "It's hard to
be concerned about academic re
form and student housing, and
things like napalm at the same
time."
How would he deal with this
apathy as vice president? Aski
nas said the task would be to
"present students with issues
and realistic programs and dem
onstrate a certain amount of
leadership.
"There isn't very much we
can do about the Vietnam war.
But there is a great deal we
can do about the quality of our
lives at Stanford," Askinas said.
Specific goals in his platform
include making the Study of
Education at Stanford a perma
nent committee, developing a
new ASSU Constitution (with a
long-term goal of having a com
munity government), setting up
more co-ed housing, and secur
ing student control of the ASSU
office.
Askinas Is presently chairman
of an ASSU committee to look
into setting up a cooperative
store on campus. He envisions
it as a combined book store,
clothing store — "like a small
department store."
"Probably 20.000 people live
and work at Stanford. And I
see no reason why we can't have
a successful co-op, where the
profits are re-allocated to the
people who purchase in the
store," he said.
Speaking of the points raised
in his mimeographed platform,
Askinas said, "All of these
things are realizable. I don't see
anything here that is unreason
able, and I don't see anything
here that couldn't be accom
plished."
Askinas is currently serving
as a graduate representative in
the ASSU legislature and is also
a tutor in Wilbur Hall.
He said yesterday some of his
goals are already being taken
up by the legislature. "I'm los
ing issues," he smiled, "because
several of my issues have now
been taken up by LASSU, partly
because of me.
"We are investigating the Food
Service, we are negotiating with
the dean of students to get back
control of the ASSU office, I
have been appointed chairman
of a committee to set up a stu
dent co-op," he remarked.

Education at Stanford a perma
nent committee, developing a
new ASSU Constitution (with a
long-term goal of having a com
munity government), setting up
more co-ed housing, and secur
ing student control of the ASSU
office.
Askinas Is presently chairman
of an ASSU committee to look
into setting up a cooperative
store on campus. He envisions
it as a combined book store,
clothing store — "like a small
department store."
"Probably 20.000 people live
and work at Stanford. And I
see no reason why we can't have
a successful co-op, where the
profits are re-allocated to the
people who purchase in the
store," he said.
Speaking of the points raised
in his mimeographed platform,
Askinas said, "All of these
things are realizable. I don't see
anything here that is unreason
able, and I don't see anything
here that couldn't be accom
plished."
Askinas is currently serving
as a graduate representative in
the ASSU legislature and is also
a tutor in Wilbur Hall.
He said yesterday some of his
goals are already being taken
up by the legislature. "I'm los
ing issues," he smiled, "because
several of my issues have now
been taken up by LASSU, partly
because of me.
"We are investigating the Food
Service, we are negotiating with
the dean of students to get back
control of the ASSU office, I
have been appointed chairman
of a committee to set up a stu
dent co-op," he remarked.
Students have to learn again
"that we can have an effect on
our environment," according to
an ASSU vice presidential can
didate.
Sociology graduate Barry As
kinas said yesterday the main
problem facing student govern
ment is student apathy. And he
blamed this directly on the Viet
nam war.
"Long-term issues fade in com
parison," he said. "It's hard to
be concerned about academic re
form and student housing, and
things like napalm at the same
time."
How would he deal with this
apathy as vice president? Aski
nas said the task would be to
"present students with issues
and realistic programs and dem
onstrate a certain amount of
leadership.
"There isn't very much we
can do about the Vietnam war.
But there is a great deal we
can do about the quality of our
lives at Stanford," Askinas said.
Specific goals in his platform
include making the Study of
Education at Stanford a perma
nent committee, developing a
new ASSU Constitution (with a
long-term goal of having a com
munity government), setting up
more co-ed housing, and secur
ing student control of the ASSU
