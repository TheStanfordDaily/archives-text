## TV For Total Birth Control 
### Art Hopper 
The League for Total Birth
Control pauses today in its busy
do-good work to salute Profes
sor Paul R. Ehrlich of Stanford
University for his imaginative
and warm-hearted proposal to
help 3.5 million people abroad
who are starving to death.
Dr. Ehrlich proposes sending
them $2 billion worth of free
television sets.
"Attitude change, not techno
logical advancement, is the key
to surviving the time of fam
ines and avoiding its repetition,"
the noted population biologist
told a Planned Parenthood meet
ing.
He said he figured that if we
could install maybe 40 million
communal television sets in
backward villages abroad, we
could change the attitudes of
the vast majority of uneducated
people and thus snuff out the
population explosion.
The League for Total Birth
Control heartily applauds Dr r
Ehrlich's proposal, for we pio
neered the theory that television
is the greatest force for birth
control that man has ever de
vised. And he's quite right that
the reason backward, television
less nations are undergoing a
population explosion is that they
don't have television.

"That was a great dinner, of
three fried caterpillers and a

boiled lotus leaf," says the back
ward husband to his backward
wife. "Now what'll we do?"
"Why don't we watch televi
sion?" she says.
"What's a television?" he says.
Not having a television, they
have nothing to do in the eve
nings. And, having nothing to
do, he looks at her sort of re
signedly and she looks at him
and they . . . Well, statistics
show that where there is no
television, the birth rate soars.
So television is clearly the an
swer. But like all technological
advances, it must be used wisely
or it may do far more harm than
good.
Programming is the key. And
the League views with grave
alarm hints by Dr. Ehrlich that
what he envisions for backward
peoples abroad is educational
television.
"Now what'll we do?" says
the backward husband after din
ner.
"Why don't we watch televi
sion?" she says.
So they turn it on and there's
two Jewish doctors arguing with
each other. And after 20 min
utes he looks at her sort of re
signedly and s*he looks at him
and they . . . Well, it's no wond
er studies show educational tele
vision ranks second only to
drive-in movies as a factor in
the ever-rising birth rate.

Better, of course, would be a
nighttime variety show with
Johnny Carson. But with the
ever-increasing length of com
mercials, perjl lurks here.
So after much thought, the
League urges that in addition
to sending starving people
abroad 40 million free television
sets, we also send them 16 pro
fessional football teams. Oh,
what a boon this would be!
"Dear, you've been glued to
that set for 14 hours and 32 min
utes. Please come to bed."

"Shhh! Brodie is fading to
pass ..."

The League's plan was adopt
ed 8-1 by its Board of Directors.
A minority report was issued by
Dr, Homer T. Pettibone.
Ho said he felt a steady diet
of Peyton Place and the late
news round-up would be a more
humane way to change the at
titudes of television viewers
abroad who were starving to
death.
"That way," h said, "they
wouldn't mind it as much."
