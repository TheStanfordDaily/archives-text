# From A Soldier In Vietnam
## 
### 
(Editor's note: The following
letter was obtained by a Stan
ford student from a girl who
had corresponded with a soldier
In Vietnam.
The student describes the boy
as good looking and a good
enough baseball pitcher to be
considered by the pros. But two
years of college bugged him, so
he quit
He was drafted, and last week
he died in Vietnam.)
Dear Alice,
Good to hear from you again.
Thought the wealthy brain child
had forgotten about her, war
cnongrel boy friend. As you
might be thinking, I'm nearing
insanity.
Well how is school and your
self coming along? Passed my 3
month mark Thanksgiving—only
9 more to go. (Christ — I
shouldn't have reminded my
self.)
I still don't have anything to
say of that much importance or
interest as usual. We have mov
ed from the rice paddies up
north to the jungle. Besides that
the only note of interest is that
my last pen just ran out of ink.
Grass Scene
The grass scene around here
is pretty good. It comes already
rolled and about 20 joints cost
a couple of dollars. The quality
is exceptional, too.

If this year ever terminates
I hope to bring home about a
ton.
I hope you don't want me to
write my impressions of Nam. It
seems that everyone wants me
to reply with my novel opinions
concerning the mess we've got
ten into.
I think they all expected
my anti-American policy attitude
to change upon my arrival —
tell me — is there anyone you
know of who can truthfully say
thr>y believe we're doing the
right thing?
It seems that a lot of GI take
a sort of self-righteous attitude
to the extent that they want
to go home and murder all the

people involved in any type of
peace movement. That can be
rationalized in a way if one tries
to understand the situation of
the soldier getting his ass shot
at.
It simply seems to me that
theory dominates the whole
scene, since there are so few
people directly involved. If the
actual realism was felt at home,
possibly many thing would be
different.
Hell, so much for, Kilmer's
Korner . . . Try to keep in touch
whenever you can . . . Merry
Christmas and happy new year
and everything.
LOVE,
G.

Dear Alice,
Good to hear from you again.
Thought the wealthy brain child
had forgotten about her, war
cnongrel boy friend. As you
might be thinking, I'm nearing
insanity.
Well how is school and your
self coming along? Passed my 3
month mark Thanksgiving—only
9 more to go. (Christ — I
shouldn't have reminded my
self.)
I still don't have anything to
say of that much importance or
interest as usual. We have mov
ed from the rice paddies up
north to the jungle. Besides that
the only note of interest is that
my last pen just ran out of ink.
Grass Scene
The grass scene around here
is pretty good. It comes already
rolled and about 20 joints cost
a couple of dollars. The quality
is exceptional, too.

If this year ever terminates
I hope to bring home about a
ton.
I hope you don't want me to
write my impressions of Nam. It
seems that everyone wants me
to reply with my novel opinions
concerning the mess we've got
ten into.
I think they all expected
my anti-American policy attitude
to change upon my arrival —
tell me — is there anyone you
know of who can truthfully say
thr>y believe we're doing the
right thing?
It seems that a lot of GI take
a sort of self-righteous attitude
to the extent that they want
to go home and murder all the

people involved in any type of
peace movement. That can be
rationalized in a way if one tries
to understand the situation of
the soldier getting his ass shot
at.
It simply seems to me that
theory dominates the whole
scene, since there are so few
people directly involved. If the
actual realism was felt at home,
possibly many thing would be
different.
Hell, so much for, Kilmer's
Korner . . . Try to keep in touch
whenever you can . . . Merry
Christmas and happy new year
and everything.
LOVE,
G.
(Editor's note: The following
letter was obtained by a Stan
ford student from a girl who
had corresponded with a soldier
In Vietnam.
The student describes the boy
as good looking and a good
enough baseball pitcher to be
considered by the pros. But two
years of college bugged him, so
he quit
