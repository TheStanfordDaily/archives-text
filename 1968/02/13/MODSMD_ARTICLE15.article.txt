# Chinese Catholics Face Brutal Death
## 
### Henry J. Taylor 
The Communits' horrible mur
der recently of six American
missionaries, three of whom
were women, at the remote
South Vietnamese leprosarium
has prompted me to ask my for
mer diplomatic colleagues of
the Vatican in Rome about the
treatment of the priests atid
nuns in Red China.
Here are the facts. They echo
Czechoslovakian Bishop Paul
Hnilica: "I have seen and felt
the persecution." They echo

what I heard Bishop Michael
Klepacz of Lodz, Poland, say at
the final session of the Ecumen
ical Council in Rome: "Peace,
yes, but not at any price."
And they also echo my experi
ence at the American Embassy
in Budapest where Joseph Car
dinal Mindszenty sought sanc
tuary and remains protected on
the third floor. Cardinal Minds
zenty, now 76, from the first day
of his elevation to Cardinal has
spent more than 85 percent of
his life in confinement.
Early Church Support
There are about three million
Catholics in Red China. Mao
Tse-tung first gave his support
to the Catholic Church. But this
was merely a wily propaganda
move, employed to build up a
pretext that the Communists
had tried conciliation but it
failed.
China had 120 bishops. Only
30 were Chinese. Today all for
eign bishops have been ex
pelled, the majority after first
being imprisoned. Of the 30 Chi
nese bishops, 15 are in prison
or have been killed.
There were more than 3,000
priests, 2,300 nuns, and nearly
800 friars who were foreigners.
All 6,100 have been killed, im
prisoned or expelled. Only the
native clergy and members of
religious orders are left. So few
clergy remain that many Catho

lics die without being able to
receive extreme unction.
No priest or nun can give re
ligious instruction. The penalty
is death. This is the Communist
party's throat-hold on the fu
ture. Religious instruction per
petrates the faith in God. Even
teaching sacred organ music is
prohibited.
All priests of every rank,
friars and nus are forced, in ad
dition, to work at menial labor.
Mao's Communist Central Labor
Bureau in each province assigns
the additional jobs and exerts
control this way.
Several bishops are working
as peasants; others as carpen
ters, textile factory roustabouts,
etc., with public announcement
to all other workers to humili
ate them. All must wear civilian
clothes.
No priest can celebrate Mass
after 8 a.m. Some churches are
open but (again typical) are also
used by the Communist party
as dance halls, party festivities
headquarters and other dese
crating activities.
Complete Disruption
Apparently the church's dis
ruption has been more complete
in Red China than in Western
European Sino-Soviet satellites
where the roots are older and
broader. In Czechoslovakia, for
example, traditionally about 70
percent of the Czechs are Cath
olics. Mao's party has created

an association of "patriot
priests" whose actual back
ground in many cases is totally
obscure.
The party has announced that
these "patriot priests" have de
clared that while th r, y "remain
faithful" to Rome for all thit
concerns Catholic dogma they
"consider themselves" indepen
dent from the political and ad
ministrative point of view.
They have started to elect
their own bishops. The Vatican
has excommunicated these des
ignates unless they accepted un
der duress.
The first high so af
fectod wore the Archbishop of
Siangyang. Msgr. Pu Ciu-ce; the
Bishop of Chungking, Msgr.
Paul Wang; the vicar general
of Nanking, Msgr. Li Wei-wang;
and the vicar capitular of
Shanghai, Msgr. Francis Xavier
Chang.
Booby-Trapped
The assassinations of prelates
and nuns are invariably public,
as occurred at the leprosarium
in South Vietnam. The bodies of
five of the missionaries of the
Christian and Missionary Alli
ance, the largest Protestant mis
sionary force (138) in the coun
try, were reportedly booby
trapped in an effort to kill the
rescuers of our country's dead.
This is the face of our enemy.

the persecution." They echo

what I heard Bishop Michael
Klepacz of Lodz, Poland, say at
the final session of the Ecumen
ical Council in Rome: "Peace,
yes, but not at any price."
And they also echo my experi
ence at the American Embassy
in Budapest where Joseph Car
dinal Mindszenty sought sanc
tuary and remains protected on
the third floor. Cardinal Minds
zenty, now 76, from the first day
of his elevation to Cardinal has
spent more than 85 percent of
his life in confinement.
Early Church Support
There are about three million
Catholics in Red China. Mao
Tse-tung first gave his support
to the Catholic Church. But this
was merely a wily propaganda
move, employed to build up a
pretext that the Communists
had tried conciliation but it
failed.
China had 120 bishops. Only
30 were Chinese. Today all for
eign bishops have been ex
pelled, the majority after first
being imprisoned. Of the 30 Chi
nese bishops, 15 are in prison
or have been killed.
There were more than 3,000
priests, 2,300 nuns, and nearly
800 friars who were foreigners.
All 6,100 have been killed, im
prisoned or expelled. Only the
native clergy and members of
religious orders are left. So few
clergy remain that many Catho

lics die without being able to
receive extreme unction.
No priest or nun can give re
ligious instruction. The penalty
is death. This is the Communist
party's throat-hold on the fu
ture. Religious instruction per
petrates the faith in God. Even
teaching sacred organ music is
prohibited.
All priests of every rank,
friars and nus are forced, in ad
dition, to work at menial labor.
Mao's Communist Central Labor
Bureau in each province assigns
the additional jobs and exerts
control this way.
Several bishops are working
as peasants; others as carpen
ters, textile factory roustabouts,
etc., with public announcement
to all other workers to humili
ate them. All must wear civilian
clothes.
No priest can celebrate Mass
after 8 a.m. Some churches are
open but (again typical) are also
used by the Communist party
as dance halls, party festivities
headquarters and other dese
crating activities.
Complete Disruption
Apparently the church's dis
ruption has been more complete
in Red China than in Western
European Sino-Soviet satellites
where the roots are older and
broader. In Czechoslovakia, for
example, traditionally about 70
percent of the Czechs are Cath
olics. Mao's party has created

an association of "patriot
priests" whose actual back
ground in many cases is totally
obscure.
The party has announced that
these "patriot priests" have de
clared that while th r, y "remain
faithful" to Rome for all thit
concerns Catholic dogma they
"consider themselves" indepen
dent from the political and ad
ministrative point of view.
They have started to elect
their own bishops. The Vatican
has excommunicated these des
ignates unless they accepted un
der duress.
The first high so af
fectod wore the Archbishop of
Siangyang. Msgr. Pu Ciu-ce; the
Bishop of Chungking, Msgr.
Paul Wang; the vicar general
of Nanking, Msgr. Li Wei-wang;
and the vicar capitular of
Shanghai, Msgr. Francis Xavier
Chang.
Booby-Trapped
The assassinations of prelates
and nuns are invariably public,
as occurred at the leprosarium
in South Vietnam. The bodies of
five of the missionaries of the
Christian and Missionary Alli
ance, the largest Protestant mis
sionary force (138) in the coun
try, were reportedly booby
trapped in an effort to kill the
rescuers of our country's dead.
This is the face of our enemy.

zenty, now 76, from the first day
of his elevation to Cardinal has
spent more than 85 percent of
his life in confinement.
Early Church Support
There are about three million
Catholics in Red China. Mao
Tse-tung first gave his support
to the Catholic Church. But this
was merely a wily propaganda
move, employed to build up a
pretext that the Communists
had tried conciliation but it
failed.
China had 120 bishops. Only
30 were Chinese. Today all for
eign bishops have been ex
pelled, the majority after first
being imprisoned. Of the 30 Chi
nese bishops, 15 are in prison
or have been killed.
There were more than 3,000
priests, 2,300 nuns, and nearly
800 friars who were foreigners.
All 6,100 have been killed, im
prisoned or expelled. Only the
native clergy and members of
religious orders are left. So few
clergy remain that many Catho

lics die without being able to
receive extreme unction.
No priest or nun can give re
ligious instruction. The penalty
is death. This is the Communist
party's throat-hold on the fu
ture. Religious instruction per
petrates the faith in God. Even
teaching sacred organ music is
prohibited.
All priests of every rank,
friars and nus are forced, in ad
dition, to work at menial labor.
Mao's Communist Central Labor
Bureau in each province assigns
the additional jobs and exerts
control this way.
Several bishops are working
as peasants; others as carpen
ters, textile factory roustabouts,
etc., with public announcement
to all other workers to humili
ate them. All must wear civilian
clothes.
No priest can celebrate Mass
after 8 a.m. Some churches are
open but (again typical) are also
used by the Communist party
as dance halls, party festivities
headquarters and other dese
crating activities.
Complete Disruption
Apparently the church's dis
ruption has been more complete
in Red China than in Western
European Sino-Soviet satellites
where the roots are older and
broader. In Czechoslovakia, for
example, traditionally about 70
percent of the Czechs are Cath
olics. Mao's party has created

an association of "patriot
priests" whose actual back
ground in many cases is totally
obscure.
The party has announced that
these "patriot priests" have de
clared that while th r, y "remain
faithful" to Rome for all thit
concerns Catholic dogma they
"consider themselves" indepen
dent from the political and ad
ministrative point of view.
They have started to elect
their own bishops. The Vatican
has excommunicated these des
ignates unless they accepted un
der duress.
The first high so af
fectod wore the Archbishop of
Siangyang. Msgr. Pu Ciu-ce; the
Bishop of Chungking, Msgr.
Paul Wang; the vicar general
of Nanking, Msgr. Li Wei-wang;
and the vicar capitular of
Shanghai, Msgr. Francis Xavier
Chang.
Booby-Trapped
The assassinations of prelates
and nuns are invariably public,
as occurred at the leprosarium
in South Vietnam. The bodies of
five of the missionaries of the
Christian and Missionary Alli
ance, the largest Protestant mis
sionary force (138) in the coun
try, were reportedly booby
trapped in an effort to kill the
rescuers of our country's dead.
This is the face of our enemy.
