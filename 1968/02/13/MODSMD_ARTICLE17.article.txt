## Hiken Explains Resignations 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
In response to Mr. Stockfisch's
article of Feb. 9 in the dally
magazine about the reason be
hind the recent change of per
sonnel at SRT, I feel it neces
sary to add the following infor
mation.
There is an assumption that
Mr. Richards and I teach a
"psychological" approach to act
ing and that we teach the same
way. At no time was that as
sumption investigated by ex
amination of what was taught
or questions asked of people
who have taken and taught both
courses.
There is a serious misunder
standing of our views on the
teaching of acting, which we
have never been allowed to clari
fy. And anyone teaching grad
uates at Stanford knows them
to be brighter, tougher and
more resistant to unproven
theories than Mr. Stockfisch
suggests.
Furthermore, there was no
effort given to find another solu
tion to the budgetary problems
that are being faced. My posi
tion is that the reduction of the
staff would seriously hamper an
effective program.
I have no doubt that, if my
feelings were taken seriously,
we could have made an attempt
to find funds other than the
existing allocated budget. This
was not done.
I have not resigned out of a
misguided sense of loyalty or in
a fit of pique. I would like this
to be made clear to all interested
parties.

The garbled version of my re

comments on the vagaries of
your reporting.
The patchwork of misquota

In printing the AP release
"New Syria Attack?", The Daily
has shown that it has learned
nothing from its latest editorial,
exposing lies put out by the
AP.
The release does not mention
the name of the Russian dip
lomat, how or when Syria fol
lowed Soviet suggestions on eco
nomic policy, nor any proof on
Syria "echoing Kremlin views."
In short it sounds very much
like the blank statements the
AP was making about the se
curity in Saigon last week.
The release, besides being ab
surd and contradictory, consti
tutes a continuation of the war
that the western imperialists are
waging against the revolutionary
leadership of the Arab nation.
Having failed in toppling tho
progressive regimes of Syria and
Egypt in the June war, the Is
raeli mercenaries and their im
perialist bosses are attempting
to achieve the same by defam
ing these regimes and creating
new pretexes for a new aggres
sive war, against the Arab na
tion. While the Arab people have
all the right to continue their
war of self-defense, the real
danger to peace in the middle
east remains to be the aggres
sive base of imperialism in the
area, Israel.

Report Is Misleading
On Homophile Meeting
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily atricle reporting the
meeting Feb. 4 (forming a stu
dent homophile league) did a
good job of reporting represen
tative statements made by mem

bers of the panel. However, one
unfortunate paragraph gave a
completely misleading image of
the nature of the meeting and
is an example of the way in
which harmful stereotypes are
perpetuated about homosexuals.
The paragraph in question is
the one which states, "In addi
tion to four panel members, 28
persons attended the discussion,
many of elderly men, sev
eral older male students and one
woman."
The fact is that in addition to
the panel members the audience
included four members of the
Society for Individual Rights in
San Francisco who came with
two of the panel members to
help in the discussion, the hus
band of the clinical psycholo
gist who was a member of the
panel, a psychiatrist on the staff
of the Cowell Health Center, a
reporter from the Palo Alto
Times, an older man who con
demned homosexuals and the
meeting with moral indignation,
and one truly elderly man who
is a retired biologist interested
in the possible biological factors
in homosexuality. The remaind
er of the audience was com
posed of students.
Unfortunately, the manner in
which your reporter attempted
to describe the audience perpet
uates the stereotype that those
primarily interested in this sub
ject are elderly men with de
vious motives.
The purpose of the student
homophile league is to sponsor
public discussion to dispel just
such stereotypes and to sharpen
community awareness of the in
human discrimination and ha
rassment often directed toward
homosexuals in our society. Such
a league is not a homosexual
group but includes both homo
sexuals and heterosexuals and
both men and women who share
a concern about this problem.
A student homophile league
has not been formed at Stanford
yet, but will organize if a siffi
cient number, of persons indicate
an interest.

Unfortunately, the manner in

primarily interested in this sub

The purpose of the student
homophile league is to sponsor
public discussion to dispel just
such stereotypes and to sharpen
community awareness of the in
human discrimination and ha
rassment often directed toward
homosexuals in our society. Such
a league is not a homosexual
group but includes both homo
sexuals and heterosexuals and
both men and women who share
a concern about this problem.
A student homophile league
has not been formed at Stanford

an interest.

In response to Mr. Stockfisch's
article of Feb. 9 in the dally
magazine about the reason be
hind the recent change of per
sonnel at SRT, I feel it neces
sary to add the following infor
mation.
There is an assumption that
Mr. Richards and I teach a
"psychological" approach to act
ing and that we teach the same
way. At no time was that as
sumption investigated by ex
amination of what was taught
or questions asked of people
who have taken and taught both
courses.
There is a serious misunder
standing of our views on the
teaching of acting, which we
have never been allowed to clari
fy. And anyone teaching grad
uates at Stanford knows them
to be brighter, tougher and
more resistant to unproven
theories than Mr. Stockfisch
suggests.
Furthermore, there was no
effort given to find another solu
tion to the budgetary problems
that are being faced. My posi
tion is that the reduction of the
staff would seriously hamper an
effective program.
I have no doubt that, if my
feelings were taken seriously,
we could have made an attempt
to find funds other than the
existing allocated budget. This
was not done.
I have not resigned out of a
misguided sense of loyalty or in
a fit of pique. I would like this
to be made clear to all interested

In printing the AP release
"New Syria Attack?", The Daily
has shown that it has learned
nothing from its latest editorial,
exposing lies put out by the
AP.
The release does not mention
the name of the Russian dip
lomat, how or when Syria fol
lowed Soviet suggestions on eco
nomic policy, nor any proof on
Syria "echoing Kremlin views."
In short it sounds very much
like the blank statements the
AP was making about the se
curity in Saigon last week.
The release, besides being ab
surd and contradictory, consti
tutes a continuation of the war
that the western imperialists are
waging against the revolutionary
leadership of the Arab nation.
Having failed in toppling tho
progressive regimes of Syria and
Egypt in the June war, the Is
raeli mercenaries and their im
perialist bosses are attempting
to achieve the same by defam
ing these regimes and creating
new pretexes for a new aggres
sive war, against the Arab na
tion. While the Arab people have
all the right to continue their
war of self-defense, the real
danger to peace in the middle
east remains to be the aggres
sive base of imperialism in the

Report Is Misleading
On Homophile Meeting
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily atricle reporting the
meeting Feb. 4 (forming a stu
dent homophile league) did a
good job of reporting represen
tative statements made by mem

bers of the panel. However, one
unfortunate paragraph gave a
completely misleading image of
the nature of the meeting and
is an example of the way in
which harmful stereotypes are
perpetuated about homosexuals.
The paragraph in question is
the one which states, "In addi
tion to four panel members, 28
persons attended the discussion,
many of elderly men, sev
eral older male students and one
woman."
The fact is that in addition to
the panel members the audience
included four members of the
Society for Individual Rights in
San Francisco who came with
two of the panel members to
help in the discussion, the hus
band of the clinical psycholo
gist who was a member of the
panel, a psychiatrist on the staff
of the Cowell Health Center, a
reporter from the Palo Alto
Times, an older man who con
demned homosexuals and the
meeting with moral indignation,
and one truly elderly man who
is a retired biologist interested
in the possible biological factors
in homosexuality. The remaind

persons attended the discussion,
many of elderly men, sev
eral older male students and one
woman."
The fact is that in addition to
the panel members the audience
included four members of the
Society for Individual Rights in
San Francisco who came with
two of the panel members to
help in the discussion, the hus
band of the clinical psycholo
gist who was a member of the
panel, a psychiatrist on the staff
of the Cowell Health Center, a
reporter from the Palo Alto
Times, an older man who con
demned homosexuals and the
meeting with moral indignation,
and one truly elderly man who
is a retired biologist interested
in the possible biological factors
in homosexuality. The remaind
er of the audience was com
posed of students.
Unfortunately, the manner in
which your reporter attempted
to describe the audience perpet
uates the stereotype that those
primarily interested in this sub
ject are elderly men with de
vious motives.
The purpose of the student
homophile league is to sponsor
public discussion to dispel just
such stereotypes and to sharpen
community awareness of the in
human discrimination and ha
rassment often directed toward
homosexuals in our society. Such
a league is not a homosexual
group but includes both homo
sexuals and heterosexuals and
both men and women who share
a concern about this problem.
A student homophile league
has not been formed at Stanford
yet, but will organize if a siffi
cient number, of persons indicate
an interest.

In response to Mr. Stockfisch's
article of Feb. 9 in the dally
magazine about the reason be
hind the recent change of per
sonnel at SRT, I feel it neces
sary to add the following infor
mation.
There is an assumption that
Mr. Richards and I teach a
"psychological" approach to act
ing and that we teach the same
way. At no time was that as
sumption investigated by ex
amination of what was taught
or questions asked of people
who have taken and taught both
courses.
There is a serious misunder
standing of our views on the
teaching of acting, which we
have never been allowed to clari
fy. And anyone teaching grad
uates at Stanford knows them
to be brighter, tougher and
more resistant to unproven
theories than Mr. Stockfisch
suggests.
Furthermore, there was no
effort given to find another solu
tion to the budgetary problems
that are being faced. My posi
tion is that the reduction of the
staff would seriously hamper an
effective program.
I have no doubt that, if my
feelings were taken seriously,
we could have made an attempt
to find funds other than the
existing allocated budget. This
was not done.
I have not resigned out of a
misguided sense of loyalty or in
a fit of pique. I would like this
to be made clear to all interested
parties.

Vagaries Twist Points
Editor, The Daily:
The garbled version of my re
marks to your reporter that ap
peared in Thursday's Daily fur
ther illustrates Herbert Packer's
comments on the vagaries of
your reporting.
The patchwork of misquota
tions regarding my experience
as a faculty resident at Wilbur

wanted to convey, namely, that
the integration of classes is
more relevant to a university
community than coeducational
housing.

Editor, The Daily:
In printing the AP release
"New Syria Attack?", The Daily
has shown that it has learned
nothing from its latest editorial,
exposing lies put out by the
AP.
The release does not mention
the name of the Russian dip
lomat, how or when Syria fol
lowed Soviet suggestions on eco
nomic policy, nor any proof on
Syria "echoing Kremlin views."
In short it sounds very much
like the blank statements the
AP was making about the se
curity in Saigon last week.
The release, besides being ab
surd and contradictory, consti
tutes a continuation of the war
that the western imperialists are
waging against the revolutionary
leadership of the Arab nation.
Having failed in toppling tho
progressive regimes of Syria and
Egypt in the June war, the Is
raeli mercenaries and their im
perialist bosses are attempting
to achieve the same by defam
ing these regimes and creating
new pretexes for a new aggres
sive war, against the Arab na
tion. While the Arab people have
all the right to continue their
war of self-defense, the real
danger to peace in the middle
east remains to be the aggres
sive base of imperialism in the
area, Israel.

Report Is Misleading
On Homophile Meeting
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily atricle reporting the
meeting Feb. 4 (forming a stu

good job of reporting represen

bers of the panel. However, one
unfortunate paragraph gave a
completely misleading image of
the nature of the meeting and
is an example of the way in
which harmful stereotypes are
perpetuated about homosexuals.
The paragraph in question is
the one which states, "In addi
