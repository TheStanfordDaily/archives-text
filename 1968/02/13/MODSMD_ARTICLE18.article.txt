# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Shriver To Quit Poverty Post 
### Drew Pearson 
Sargent Shriver, organizer of
the Peace Corps and pioneer of
the antipoverty administration,
will shortly bow out as its ad
ministrator.
Shriver, is unique in the John
son administration in that he is
the only member of the Ken
nedy family to remain working
for LBJ. In view of the Ken
nedy-Johnson feud, this has not
been easy.
However, Shriver has always
been completely loyal to the
President, and Johnson in turn
has been both cordial and sym
pathetic in his relations with
him.
Shriver is married to Eunice
Kennedy, the most vigorous of
the Kennedy sisters. Eunice, like
all the Kennedys, is loyal to the
faculty. But she is also married
to a top member of the Johnson
administration.
Eunice's Ideas
Mrs. Shriver has her own
ideas regarding LBJ. Arriving
a little late at a women's party,
she explained that she had just
been to the White House for the
signing of the Mental Health
Act.
"I got a pen," she exclaimed,
holding up one of the souvenir
pens which the President gives
to honored guests at these cere
monies. "I also got kissed. Just
two of us got kissed."
Eunice said this in a mimick
ing voice with a slight Texas
drawl.
"Who else got kissed?" she
was asked.
"A little gnayhaired lady
named Muriel," said Mrs. Shri
ver, referring, of course, to the
wife of the Vice President.
Shriver's Loyalty
Sargent Shriver is a courag
eous man. At one time, a week
or so after Johnson became Pres
dent, he stepped into the feud
between LBJ and Bobby and
tried to patch things up. He got
caught in a bitter buzz saw and
stepped abruptly out. He has not
got caught in that buzz saw
again.

Shriver even wanted to attend
the memorial services for his
late brother-in-law, the President,
at the Lincoln Memorial Dec. 22,
1963, where the new President
spoke but which all the mem
bers of the Kennedy family boy
cotted.
At the last minute other mem
bers of the family prevailed on
Shriver not to attend. His seat
alongside the President was va
cant at the ceremony.
Meanwhile Shriver has con
tinued to serve President John
son loyally and efficiently, and
Johnson for the most part has
seemed grateful. He even con
sidered drafting Shriver to run
as his Vice Presidential running
mate in the 1964 elections.
Only Bobby Runs
When this report got back to
Bobby Kennedy, he sent word by
Ken O'Donnell that if any mem
ber of the Kennedy family was
going to run for Vice President,
it would be himself, Bobby, not
a man who was only "half a
Kennedy."
When President Johnson set
up the antipoverty administra
tion (Office of Economic Op
portunity) three years ago, he
drafted Shriver from the Peace
Corps to take over this difficult
job. It has been the most con
troversial branch of government.
Like the Works Progress Ad
ministration, thrown up in a
hurry by President Roosevelt
under Harry Hopkins in the days
of the great depression, OEO
drew a lot of criticism. But like
Hopkins, Shriver did get people
working.
Criticism Crescendo
Criticism reached a crescendo
last summer when antipoverty
enemies in Congress held up
OEO's appropriation for nine
months, even cut its personnel's
pay checks.
Whereupon Shriver won a
notable victory. From all over
the country the heat began to
pour, in on Congress. Twenty
mayors flew to Washington to
protest the curtailment of OEO.

The public reaction was so
great that the House of Repre
sentatives reversed itself and
gave Shriver more money than
allotted by the Johnson budget.
It was a great victory.
However, when it earning to
signing the Antipoverty Act, re
trieved from defeat by Shriver,
there was no Presidential cere
mony, no pens were given away
to honored guests. The Act was
signed while the President was
flying over Cam Ranh Bay in
South Vietnam in a manner
which it seemed was calculated
not to call public attention to
Shriver's victory.
The Switch Over
Shortly after he returned from
his Christmas holiday, the Pres
ident began switching Shriver's
hard-earned money over to the
new "Urban Coalition," a part
nership between business and
government to train unemploy
able adults. It is an important
project.
However, it has two draw
backs.
First, the $135,000,000 to op
erate it is being siphoned awav
from youth training under OEO.
It is youth training which ha?
helped to ke~p young Negroe c '
off the streets and helped pre
vent race riots in New York,
Philadelphia and Chicago.
Second, the Urban Coalition
program has to get underway in
time to be effective before the
summer, when race problems
flare again. The time is short,
and it will be a miracle, even un
der the skillful direction of
Henry Ford, if private business
can get going in this period of
time.
Despite the current nicking of
Shriver's hard-won poverty mon
ey, he and the President remain
on cordial personal terms. Some
friends say that Shriver is prob
ably more cordial with LBJ than
with his brother-in-law Bobby.
However, he is convinced the
time has come to bow out.

months, even cut its personnel's
pay checks.
Whereupon Shriver won a
notable victory. From all over
the country the heat began to
pour, in on Congress. Twenty
mayors flew to Washington to
protest the curtailment of OEO.

The public reaction was so
great that the House of Repre
sentatives reversed itself and
gave Shriver more money than
allotted by the Johnson budget.
It was a great victory.
However, when it earning to
signing the Antipoverty Act, re
trieved from defeat by Shriver,
there was no Presidential cere
mony, no pens were given away
to honored guests. The Act was
signed while the President was
flying over Cam Ranh Bay in
South Vietnam in a manner
which it seemed was calculated
not to call public attention to
Shriver's victory.
The Switch Over
Shortly after he returned from
his Christmas holiday, the Pres
ident began switching Shriver's
hard-earned money over to the
new "Urban Coalition," a part
nership between business and
government to train unemploy
able adults. It is an important
project.
However, it has two draw
backs.
First, the $135,000,000 to op
erate it is being siphoned awav
from youth training under OEO.
It is youth training which ha?
helped to ke~p young Negroe c '
off the streets and helped pre
vent race riots in New York,
Philadelphia and Chicago.
Second, the Urban Coalition
program has to get underway in
time to be effective before the
summer, when race problems
flare again. The time is short,
and it will be a miracle, even un
der the skillful direction of
Henry Ford, if private business
can get going in this period of
time.
Despite the current nicking of
Shriver's hard-won poverty mon
ey, he and the President remain
on cordial personal terms. Some
friends say that Shriver is prob
ably more cordial with LBJ than
with his brother-in-law Bobby.
However, he is convinced the
time has come to bow out.

Sargent Shriver, organizer of
the Peace Corps and pioneer of
the antipoverty administration,
will shortly bow out as its ad
ministrator.
Shriver, is unique in the John
son administration in that he is
the only member of the Ken
nedy family to remain working
for LBJ. In view of the Ken
nedy-Johnson feud, this has not
been easy.
However, Shriver has always
been completely loyal to the
President, and Johnson in turn
has been both cordial and sym
pathetic in his relations with
him.
Shriver is married to Eunice
Kennedy, the most vigorous of
the Kennedy sisters. Eunice, like
all the Kennedys, is loyal to the
faculty. But she is also married
to a top member of the Johnson
administration.
Eunice's Ideas
Mrs. Shriver has her own
ideas regarding LBJ. Arriving
a little late at a women's party,
she explained that she had just
been to the White House for the
signing of the Mental Health
Act.
"I got a pen," she exclaimed,
holding up one of the souvenir
pens which the President gives
to honored guests at these cere
monies. "I also got kissed. Just
two of us got kissed."
Eunice said this in a mimick
ing voice with a slight Texas
drawl.
"Who else got kissed?" she
was asked.
"A little gnayhaired lady
named Muriel," said Mrs. Shri
ver, referring, of course, to the
wife of the Vice President.
Shriver's Loyalty
Sargent Shriver is a courag
eous man. At one time, a week
or so after Johnson became Pres
dent, he stepped into the feud
between LBJ and Bobby and
tried to patch things up. He got
caught in a bitter buzz saw and
stepped abruptly out. He has not
got caught in that buzz saw
again.

Shriver even wanted to attend
the memorial services for his
late brother-in-law, the President,
at the Lincoln Memorial Dec. 22,
1963, where the new President
spoke but which all the mem
bers of the Kennedy family boy
cotted.
At the last minute other mem
bers of the family prevailed on
Shriver not to attend. His seat
alongside the President was va
cant at the ceremony.
Meanwhile Shriver has con
tinued to serve President John
son loyally and efficiently, and
Johnson for the most part has
seemed grateful. He even con
sidered drafting Shriver to run
as his Vice Presidential running
mate in the 1964 elections.
Only Bobby Runs
When this report got back to
Bobby Kennedy, he sent word by
Ken O'Donnell that if any mem
ber of the Kennedy family was
going to run for Vice President,
it would be himself, Bobby, not
a man who was only "half a
Kennedy."
When President Johnson set
up the antipoverty administra
tion (Office of Economic Op
portunity) three years ago, he
drafted Shriver from the Peace
Corps to take over this difficult
job. It has been the most con
troversial branch of government.
Like the Works Progress Ad
ministration, thrown up in a
hurry by President Roosevelt
under Harry Hopkins in the days
of the great depression, OEO
drew a lot of criticism. But like
Hopkins, Shriver did get people
working.
Criticism Crescendo
Criticism reached a crescendo
last summer when antipoverty
enemies in Congress held up
OEO's appropriation for nine
months, even cut its personnel's
pay checks.

"A little gnayhaired lady
named Muriel," said Mrs. Shri
ver, referring, of course, to the
wife of the Vice President.
Shriver's Loyalty
Sargent Shriver is a courag
eous man. At one time, a week
or so after Johnson became Pres
dent, he stepped into the feud
between LBJ and Bobby and
tried to patch things up. He got
caught in a bitter buzz saw and
stepped abruptly out. He has not
got caught in that buzz saw
again.

Shriver even wanted to attend
the memorial services for his
late brother-in-law, the President,
at the Lincoln Memorial Dec. 22,
1963, where the new President
spoke but which all the mem
bers of the Kennedy family boy
cotted.
At the last minute other mem
bers of the family prevailed on
Shriver not to attend. His seat
alongside the President was va
cant at the ceremony.
Meanwhile Shriver has con
tinued to serve President John
son loyally and efficiently, and
Johnson for the most part has
seemed grateful. He even con
sidered drafting Shriver to run
as his Vice Presidential running
mate in the 1964 elections.
Only Bobby Runs
When this report got back to
Bobby Kennedy, he sent word by
Ken O'Donnell that if any mem
ber of the Kennedy family was
going to run for Vice President,
it would be himself, Bobby, not
a man who was only "half a
Kennedy."
When President Johnson set
up the antipoverty administra
tion (Office of Economic Op
portunity) three years ago, he
drafted Shriver from the Peace
Corps to take over this difficult
job. It has been the most con
troversial branch of government.
Like the Works Progress Ad
ministration, thrown up in a
hurry by President Roosevelt
under Harry Hopkins in the days
of the great depression, OEO
drew a lot of criticism. But like
Hopkins, Shriver did get people
working.
Criticism Crescendo
Criticism reached a crescendo
last summer when antipoverty
enemies in Congress held up
OEO's appropriation for nine
months, even cut its personnel's
pay checks.
Whereupon Shriver won a
notable victory. From all over
the country the heat began to
pour, in on Congress. Twenty
mayors flew to Washington to
protest the curtailment of OEO.

The public reaction was so
great that the House of Repre
sentatives reversed itself and
gave Shriver more money than
allotted by the Johnson budget.
It was a great victory.
However, when it earning to
signing the Antipoverty Act, re
trieved from defeat by Shriver,
there was no Presidential cere
mony, no pens were given away
to honored guests. The Act was
signed while the President was
flying over Cam Ranh Bay in
South Vietnam in a manner
which it seemed was calculated
not to call public attention to
Shriver's victory.
The Switch Over
Shortly after he returned from
his Christmas holiday, the Pres
ident began switching Shriver's
hard-earned money over to the
new "Urban Coalition," a part
nership between business and
government to train unemploy
able adults. It is an important
project.
However, it has two draw
backs.
First, the $135,000,000 to op
erate it is being siphoned awav
from youth training under OEO.
It is youth training which ha?
helped to ke~p young Negroe c '
off the streets and helped pre
vent race riots in New York,
Philadelphia and Chicago.
Second, the Urban Coalition
program has to get underway in
time to be effective before the
summer, when race problems
flare again. The time is short,
and it will be a miracle, even un
der the skillful direction of
Henry Ford, if private business
can get going in this period of
time.
Despite the current nicking of
Shriver's hard-won poverty mon
ey, he and the President remain
on cordial personal terms. Some
friends say that Shriver is prob
ably more cordial with LBJ than
with his brother-in-law Bobby.
However, he is convinced the
time has come to bow out.
Copyright, 1968,

Sargent Shriver, organizer of
the Peace Corps and pioneer of
the antipoverty administration,
will shortly bow out as its ad
ministrator.
Shriver, is unique in the John
son administration in that he is
the only member of the Ken
nedy family to remain working
for LBJ. In view of the Ken
nedy-Johnson feud, this has not
been easy.
However, Shriver has always
been completely loyal to the
President, and Johnson in turn
has been both cordial and sym
pathetic in his relations with
him.
Shriver is married to Eunice
Kennedy, the most vigorous of
the Kennedy sisters. Eunice, like
all the Kennedys, is loyal to the
faculty. But she is also married
to a top member of the Johnson
administration.
Eunice's Ideas
Mrs. Shriver has her own
ideas regarding LBJ. Arriving
a little late at a women's party,
she explained that she had just
been to the White House for the
signing of the Mental Health
Act.
"I got a pen," she exclaimed,
holding up one of the souvenir
pens which the President gives
to honored guests at these cere
monies. "I also got kissed. Just
two of us got kissed."
Eunice said this in a mimick
ing voice with a slight Texas
drawl.
"Who else got kissed?" she
was asked.
"A little gnayhaired lady
named Muriel," said Mrs. Shri
ver, referring, of course, to the
wife of the Vice President.
