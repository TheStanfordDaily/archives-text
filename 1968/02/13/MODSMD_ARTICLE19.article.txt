# A
						War For Minds

### Max Lerner 
The "last desperate effort"
theory has been repeatedly ad
vanced to explain the persist
ing fighting strength of Hanoi
and the Viet Cong. In the light
of the concerted terrorist break
throughs into South Vietnamese
cities, I doubt it strongly.
Despite Gen. William West
moreland's continued optimism
that the terrorists are only a
diversionary move to distract
attention from the "last big
push" at Khe Sanh, and despite
my colleague Joe Alsop's devot
ed conviction that the Viet Cong
have been promised victory just
around the corner to maintain
their morale, my own reading
is more pessimistic.
Let us agree that one imme
diate aim of the terrorist raids
has been to establish a better
bargaining position for Hanoi
and the Viet Cong and to force
America to the negotiating
table on terms closer to their
own than to the American terms.
But from a long-range view,
there is only one interpretation
that will explain the course of
the Vietnamese war, including
this latest phase of it.
Political Interpretation
It is the political war interpre
tation. The war has been, for
Hanoi and the Viet Cong, politi
cal from the start, in the sense
that it has been a war directed
to the mind — to nationalist rev
olutionary passions on their
own side, to the doubts and fears
and the agony over the draft
and the casualty figures and the
sharp sense of guilt that have
split the American domestic
front.
Once we take this overall view,
the various phases of Commu
nist strategy and tactics fall into
place better than they do under
any other theory.
Americans, and Westerners in
general, draw a distinction be
tween the military and the pol

itical, and even the Russians do
sometimes. But Mao Tse-tung
and his disciples do not, and I
include here among his disciples
Castro's Cuba and North Korea
and North Vietnam.
He has, of course, a whole
array of advantages in this kind
of warfare. He has an interior
line of supplies and men, where
America must endure a logis
tical burden that extends half
way around the world.
Hanoi and the Viet Cong fight
a war on their own soil of Viet
nam, which they call a civil war
or a war of defense at their
choice, while America must con
stantly answer the question:
"What are you doing in Viet
nam?"
Ho Chi Minh can use the wea
pons of terrorism, both in the
cities and the villages, to create
the image of a Vietnam where
no soldier or civilian is safe and
to break up the pacification of
the villages.
But when Americans use ex
treme weapons, like napalm,
they are denounced abroad and
at home; when they mount
search-and-destroy operations in
the South they create more
refugees, and when they bomb
in the North they must pay
the price of making the Hanoi
home front cohesive.
American Frustration
This is another case history
of today's world in which the
small nations are not helpless
nor the big nations omnipotent.
When you add to the weapons
of nationalism and terror the
weapon of Communist faith, it
should be clear that Ho Chi
Minh's armory is political and
military at the same time, while
the Americans are frustrated in
every political phase of the war.
For even in the face of war
weariness and mounting defec
tions Ho Chi Minh seems to be
able to whip up hatred of the

enemy, fear of opposing the re
gime and the promise of a fu
ture in which the Viet Cong will
rule in Saigon while their allies
rule in Hanoi.
There is no similar hatred or
fear or promise that Lyndon
Johnson can use—only the con
viction that American power
cannot be dislodged, that Amer
ica cannot abandon the South
Vietnamese to their enemies and
that to withdraw now would be
fatal to future American politi
cal credibility anywhere in the
world.
Alternate Action
Is the American cupboard then
wholly bare of political weapons
other than these? I don't think
so. America can do something
about the draft and the students,
it can do something about the
Vietnamese villages and refu
gees, it can do something about
the overall war strategy, it can
do something about relations
with the Saigon regime, it can
do something about the image
of America in the minds of the
other Asian nations.
One might note that the
healthy traditional American
division between civilian and
military authority has also had
a crippling side-effect of making
Americans believe that there are
military actions and political ac
tions and that the two are sepa
rate. They are not.
President Johnson—and each
of the current presidential candi
dates also—should begin and end
every speech with the sentence:
"The war is political."
