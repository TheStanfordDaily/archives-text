## MORNINGS AT SEVEN...AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT

Any man who says morning is the best time of day is
either a liar or a meadow lark.
There is only one way to make morning' enjoyable:
sleep till noon. Failing that, the very best you can do is to
make morning tolerable. This, I am pleased to report, is
possible if you will follow three simple rules:
1. Shave properly.
By shaving properly I mean shaving quietly. Don't use
a blade that whines and complains. Morning being a time
of clanger and anger, use a blade that neither clangs nor
angs. Use a blade that makes no din on your chin, no
squeak on your cheek, no howl on your jowl, no rip on
your lip, no waves while it shaves. Use, in short, Personna
Super Stainless Steel Blades.
I have been shaving for 71 years (not too impressive
until one considers that I am 40 years old ) and I am here
to tell you that the quietest blade I know is Personna. I not
only shave with Personna, but I also admire it. Old vir
tues reappear in Personna; old values are reborn. Per
sonna is a modest blade, an undemanding blade. Personna
does not rasp and tug, yelling, "Hey, lookit me!" No, sir,
not Personna! Silently, respectfully, unobtrusively, Per
sonna whisks your whiskers with nary a whisper. It
shucks your soil and stubble without toil and trouble.
Why, you hardly know it's there, this well-bred Personna
blade, this paragon of punctilio.
Moreover, this crown of the blade-maker's art, this
epitome of epidermal efficacy, is available both in Double
edge style and Injector style. Do your kisser a favor: get
some.
2. Breakfast properly.
I assert that a Personna shave is the best of all possible
shaves. But I do not assert that a Personna shave, brac
ing though it may be, is enough to prepare you for t he
hideous forenoon ahead. After shaving you must eat an
ample breakfast.
Take, for example, the case of Basil Metabolism, a soph
omore at VM.I. Basil, knowing there was to be an inspec
tion by the Commandant one morning, prepared by stor
ing up energy. He recognized that coffee and juice would
not sustain him, so he had a flitch of bacon, a clutch of
eggs, a batch of bagels, a notch of ham, a bunch of butter,
a swatch of grits, a hutch of honey, a patch of jelly, a
thatch of jam, a twitch of pepper, and a pinch of salt.

The idea was right; the quantities, alas, were not. When
the Commandant arrived, Basil, alas, was so torpid that
he could not raise his bloated arm in a proper salute. He
was, of course, immediately shot by a firing squad. Today,
a perforated man, he earns a meagre living as a collander
in Cleveland.
S. Read properly.
Always read the paper at breakfast. It inhibits bolting.
But do not read the front page. That is full of bad, acid
making news. Read a more pleasant part of the paper
the Home and Garden section, for example.
For instance, in my local paper, The West.port Peasant,
there is a delightful column called "Ask Harry Home
spun" which fairly bristles with bucolic wisdom and
many an earthy chuckle. I quote some questions and
answers:
Q: I am thinking of buying some power tools. What
should / get first?
A: Hospitalization.
Q: How do you get rid of moles ?
A : Pave the lawn.
Q: What is the best way to put a wide car in a narrow
garage?
A: Butter it.
Q: What do you do for elm blight ?
A : Salt water gargle and bed rest.
Q: What can I do for dry hair?
A: Get a wet hat.

Any man who says morning is the best time of day is
either a liar or a meadow lark.
There is only one way to make morning' enjoyable:
sleep till noon. Failing that, the very best you can do is to
make morning tolerable. This, I am pleased to report, is
possible if you will follow three simple rules:
1. Shave properly.
By shaving properly I mean shaving quietly. Don't use
a blade that whines and complains. Morning being a time
of clanger and anger, use a blade that neither clangs nor
angs. Use a blade that makes no din on your chin, no
squeak on your cheek, no howl on your jowl, no rip on
your lip, no waves while it shaves. Use, in short, Personna
Super Stainless Steel Blades.
I have been shaving for 71 years (not too impressive
until one considers that I am 40 years old ) and I am here
to tell you that the quietest blade I know is Personna. I not
only shave with Personna, but I also admire it. Old vir
tues reappear in Personna; old values are reborn. Per
sonna is a modest blade, an undemanding blade. Personna
does not rasp and tug, yelling, "Hey, lookit me!" No, sir,
not Personna! Silently, respectfully, unobtrusively, Per
sonna whisks your whiskers with nary a whisper. It
shucks your soil and stubble without toil and trouble.
Why, you hardly know it's there, this well-bred Personna
blade, this paragon of punctilio.
Moreover, this crown of the blade-maker's art, this
epitome of epidermal efficacy, is available both in Double
edge style and Injector style. Do your kisser a favor: get
some.
2. Breakfast properly.
I assert that a Personna shave is the best of all possible
shaves. But I do not assert that a Personna shave, brac
ing though it may be, is enough to prepare you for t he
hideous forenoon ahead. After shaving you must eat an
ample breakfast.
Take, for example, the case of Basil Metabolism, a soph
omore at VM.I. Basil, knowing there was to be an inspec
tion by the Commandant one morning, prepared by stor
ing up energy. He recognized that coffee and juice would
not sustain him, so he had a flitch of bacon, a clutch of
eggs, a batch of bagels, a notch of ham, a bunch of butter,
a swatch of grits, a hutch of honey, a patch of jelly, a
thatch of jam, a twitch of pepper, and a pinch of salt.

The idea was right; the quantities, alas, were not. When
the Commandant arrived, Basil, alas, was so torpid that
he could not raise his bloated arm in a proper salute. He
was, of course, immediately shot by a firing squad. Today,
a perforated man, he earns a meagre living as a collander
in Cleveland.
S. Read properly.
Always read the paper at breakfast. It inhibits bolting.
But do not read the front page. That is full of bad, acid
making news. Read a more pleasant part of the paper
the Home and Garden section, for example.
For instance, in my local paper, The West.port Peasant,
there is a delightful column called "Ask Harry Home
spun" which fairly bristles with bucolic wisdom and
many an earthy chuckle. I quote some questions and
answers:
Q: I am thinking of buying some power tools. What
should / get first?
A: Hospitalization.
Q: How do you get rid of moles ?
A : Pave the lawn.
Q: What is the best way to put a wide car in a narrow
garage?
A: Butter it.
Q: What do you do for elm blight ?
A : Salt water gargle and bed rest.
Q: What can I do for dry hair?
A: Get a wet hat.
