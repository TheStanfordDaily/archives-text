# Harris Faces Arraignment
## 
### 
David Harris, former ASSU
president, will be arraigned to
day at 10 a.m. before Judge Vir
poli on the 17th floor of the U.S.
District Court in San Francisco.
The arraignment stems out of
a federal grand jury indictment
for violating section 41844 of the
military service act by refusing
induction into the armed forces.
Harris defied authorities at
the Oakland Induction Center on
January 18, while other mem
bers of the Resistance, an anti
draft organization, staged a ral
ly.
