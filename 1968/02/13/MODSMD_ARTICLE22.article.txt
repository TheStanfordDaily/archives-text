# Law Prof Likens New Left, Fascists
## 
### 
The New Left has rejected
God, rationality, and the basic
tenets of our culture said Stan
ford Law School professor Jo
seph T. Sneed at a Lutheran
Community Movement luncheon
last Friday.
Sneed's attack on the New
Left was based on the conten
tion that members of this move
ment have forsaken the tradi
tional principles of bourgeoise
society and replaced them with
"a curious Utopian dream." He
called his talk "In Defense of
the Bourgeoisie."
Sneed compared the New Left
movement with the fascists of
thirty and forty years ago. Both
groups, he claimed, place an
"emphasis on the irrational"
and "Utopian" dreams of to
morrow.
That "honesty in public and
private dealings is best" has al
ways been a basic part of bour
geois philosophy, Sneed said.
He added that today the New
Left apparently emphasizes hon
esty not for its intrinsic value,
but "as a technique to be em
ployed to reach an end."
That "society is best governed
by rules based on a large con
sensus and consistently ap
plied," has been transposed by
the New Left to read: "society
is best governed when it con
forms to my wishes without re
gard to its consistency or the
rules upon which it is based."
Sneed said the Left proclaims
that political activity is a means
to augment its power rather
than an activity which is "con
sistent with the end of reaching
a rational conclusion after seri
ous debate."

The Law professor attributed
this transposition of principles
to a loss of faith in God and re
ligion, a loss of faith in man
as a rational being, and a mis
understanding of how our basic
principles evolved through his
tory.
