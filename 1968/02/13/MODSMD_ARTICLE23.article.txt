praised film, will be shown to

mission to the film, sponsored
by The Midpeninsula Observer,
is $1.50. Tickets are on sale to
day at Tresidder Box Office and
will be available at the Memorial
Auditorium Box Office this eve
ning.
According to Cue Magazine,
"Inside North Vietnam" is "the
most jolting film in town for
anyone who gives a damn about
what is being done in his name.
This is a film about an atrocity.
Scenes fill one with shame. The
film's over-all power comes from
detailing, often exquisitely, the
heroism of a beautiful, courag
eous people. Thanks to Felix
Greene we can never say we did
not know what our country was
doing."
Jessica Mitford, author of
"The American Way of Death,"
says,"The film is shattering. I
cried, raged, cheered . . . This
film if seen by enough Ameri
cans could end the war."
