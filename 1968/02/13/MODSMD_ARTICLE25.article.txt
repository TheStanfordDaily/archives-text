now all the fingers of this tree (darling) have
hands, and all the hands have people; and
more each particular person is (my love)
alive than every world can understand

our then shall be some darkness during which
fingers are without hands; and i have no
you; and all trees are (any more than each
leafless) its silent in forevering snow

-but never fear (my own, my beautiful
my blossoming) for also then's until

e. e. cummings

and now you are and i am now and we're
a mystery which will never happen again,
a miracle which has never happened before
and shining this our now must come to then
