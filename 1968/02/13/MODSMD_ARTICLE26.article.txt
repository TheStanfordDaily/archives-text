## Guthrie Sings Of Roaches And War 
### PENNY HILL MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Lean, pale Arlo Guthrie stands
somewhat stiffly, his tired eyes
focusing on the empty space be
tween him and his audience. On
stage Friday evening he sound
ed as gentle as one imagines
when listening to his record, but
he came across with a confident
air in the electronically-super
charged Fillmore Auditorium.
searching, tenor voice
could have enraptured the Fill
more audience throughout both
sets. But rather than singing
full sets of melodic numbers,
like those on the second side of
his album, he did what he likes
—playing games on his guitar.
Some of it was good and some
of it wasn't.
Arlo's games consist of revi
sions of the "Alice" chords, im
provisations on the melody, and
complete re - writing of the
script. One may wonder what
"Jack the Indians or "Multi-col
ored Rainbow Roaches" have to
do with Alice's Restaurant, or
what Alice's Restaurant has to
do with anything, for that mat
ter. But according to Arlo, it

can be anything you want. He
shows that in his songs.
Arlo's deadpan wit reached
Its heights In the spy-tingling
"Alice's Restaurant Multi-col
ored Rainbow Roach Affair."
With some polishing this
monologue could be another
album, satirizing the atomic
war-making importance of
roaches which dissolve into a'-
gas which gets everybody
stoned. Everybody except the
cops, for whom Arlo has the
casual warning, "Being stored
in a straight world isn't near
ly as bad as being straight in
a stoned world."
Arlo also introduced cops into
an explanation of his popular
"Motorcycle Song". It seems
that he was coming down a
mountain road on his motorcy
cle at 150 mph while playing his
acoustic guitar. On one side of
the road there was a mountain
(bein' a mountain road) and on
the other side there was noth
ing. As can be expected, he went
over the cliff and wrote the
mournful motorcycle song on
the way down.
But Arlo didn't die. He landed
on a "cop car at the bottom of
the cliff," and the cop died.

Between sets Arlo was asked
if he had any qualms about
arousing audiences against po
lice in general. "There are good
cops and bad cops," he answered
readily. "The good ones are the
peace officers and the bad ones
are police officers." Officer Obie
from Stockbridge, Mass., is one
of the good ones. Arlo has no
hard feelings.
What would Arlo do if there
were peace, for then his anti
draft songs would lose their ur
gency. Arlo, smiling, said he
would "jump up and down for
three days."
Arlo, incidentally, still has
personal reasons for writing
anti-draft songs. He had to fly
from Los Angeles to New York
for a physical last week—and he
still doesn't know the results.
Arlo Guthrie's fantastical life
view dates back 20 years. That's
when Arlo, Woody Guthrie's
son, was born. Something must
have frozen during his childhood
development, because he never
lost the ability to fantasize. To
Arlo and other kids his tales are
completely true, and he leaves it
up to his audience whether to
believe them.

Some of Arlo's Inspira
tion comes from \lsions, like
the vision of Jack the In
cyan and General Custard on
Market St. This vision came
during; an aocident caused by
running: into the secret cave
of Jack the Indians (the
tribe), into which Jack the
Indian was running- at the
time of the accident while try
ing to remember the secret
pass word to get himself and
his descendents and ancestors
Into the cave to escape Gen
eral Custard.
Of course the Jack the Indians
Secret Song will get you in the
cave too, so all you have to do
is to wait until it comes around
on the Jack the Indian's secret
guitar and sing it with feelin'
and you'll save your ancestors
and descendants, because if you
don't get in, no one else can.
Whether Arlo has rehabili
tated himself from litterin' (his
crime in Alice's Restaurant)
may never be answered, and it
is questionable whether he'll
ever be rehabilitated from story
telling.
Arlo's original tale, Alice's
Restaurant Massacree, was in
vestigated recently by a report
er for the New York Post who
discovered the existence of
Stockbridge, Mass., Alice, and
Officer Obie.
Chief of the Stockbridge Po
lice William Obanheim thinks
Arlo "is a slob." About Alice's,
he says,"I hear the food was
good, but all night long she
(Alice) had these hippy guys
with long hair strumming gui
tars."
Officer Obie says the Alice's
Restaurant Massacre is a
"misrepresentation" and re
sents the fact that "the jpiy is
making a million bucks at my
expense."
Alice (remember Alice?) still
lives with Ray in the church.
Arlo just bought a house in
Stockbridge.
Although Arlo is used to
smaller clubs than the Fillmore,
he seemed to enjoy himself
thoroughly on stage. Today he
leaves the Bay Area to do a
short gig at the Golden Bear in
Huntington Beach, and then is
off for Cleveland before return
ing to Stockbridge.
