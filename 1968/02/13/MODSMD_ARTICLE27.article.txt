## Frosh Cool To Greek Week 
### CLAUDIA WILKEN 
As some fraternity spokesmen
put it, the purpose of the an
nual Greek Week is to publicize
fraternities in order to interest
freshmen in fraternity life. Does
Greek Week accomplish this?
We asked about 50 Branner
and Wilbur freshman men their
opinions on Greek Week. "What
is it?" was the reaction of sev
eral. Most of those who were
aware of Greek Week were not
affected by it.
A Wilbur freshman's com
ment was typical, "I didn't go.
Greek Week is totally irrelevant
to me. It has no bearing on my
decision whether or not to join
a fraternity." Or, in the words
of a Branner freshman, "I'm
pretty ignorant about Greek
Week, but I didn't get all hop
ped up about it."

"I think Greek Week is
more for the fraternity's own
sake, not to turn anyone else
on to fraternities," said an
other Branner freshman.
One freshman we talked to,
who had already decided to join
a fraternity had not been in
fluenced by Greek Week. "I al
ready wanted to join a fratern
ity, but Greek Week had noth
ing to do with it," said a Wil
bur freshman.
An undecided freshman said,
"Greek Week won't affect my
decision. I think the way to de
cide is to go up there next
week." Another said "I don't
think I'd want to join a fra
ternity just because it won the
chariot race."
A few freshmen were influ

enced positively by Greek Week.
One Branner man said, "It makes
me want to join—for a little
break in the academic pressure."
Another said, "I looked in the
paper to see who won the char
iot race—if I'm going to join a
fraternity, it might as well be
one with a lot of activities and
spirit."
Finally, about a third of the
freshmen interviewed were af
fected negatively by Greek
Week, although none cited Greek
Week as the major reason for
their decisions not to join a
fraternity.
"If Greek Week presents a
picture of what fraternity life
is like, I wouldn't want to join
a fraternity," was a Branner
man's reaction. A Wilbur man
thought it was "A waste of
time."
