# Swimmers Down Berkeley, To Meet Trojans Thursday
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford swimmers trekked to
the ice-encrusted Berkeley tun
dra to chip out a pair of wins
last weekend. The Indian varsity
cut down the polar Bears 77-31
Friday and the Papooses skated
past the Cal frosh, 71-40.
Fifty degree temperatures left
something to be desired in the
times over the weekend, but the
Cards are concentrating on what
lies ahead.
USC, dragging a undefeated
string of 94 straight dual
meets, hosts Stanford Thurs
day night at Beverly Hills
High School. Peter Daland's
Trojans had a skein of five
consecutive NCAA champion
ships running until Stanford
snatched away the crown last
year.
Southern Cal had to win the
last relay two years ago to beat
the Indians. Last year, before
more than 2000 fans in the En
cina Pool, USC and Stanford bat
tled to a 52-52 tie. The Trojans
swam away with the conference

title, but Stanford bounded back
to grab the big one at East Lan
sing.
USC boasts world record
freestyler Greg Charlton, Pan
Am sprint champ Don Havens,
former national champion Phil
Houser, AAU 200 backstroke
victory Mark Mader, and a
large number of returning let
termen from last year's NCAA
runner-up squad.
Following the USC meet, the
Cards hit UCLA's pool in hopes
of avenging two water polo
losses to the Bruins last fall.
Dick Roth won his specialty,
the 200 IM, and also took the
200 backstroke against Cal. Bill
Main aced both diving events.

John Ferris hit 1:59.9 in the
200 IM to highlight a shivery
freshman victory.
