# Impressions From L.A.
## Alumni A Different Breed 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
"All we cared about was hav
ing good times —sex, booze and
sports."
A 1956 Stanford graduate
mused over a drink at the
alumni conference Sunday amid
the gaudy splendor of the Cen
tury Plaza hotel in Los Angeles.
"We were like sheep," his
wife added. "We just followed
along." She expressed admira
tion for the interest of today's
students in the Peace Corps.
These two alumni sensed the
growing gulf between them
selves and the University.
Very few recent graduates at
tended Sunday's conference.
Only a handful of students
were present. Most of the
overflow crowd belonged to
Stanford classes of the 1930'5,
1940*9 and 1950'5.
Their Stanford was a differ
ent place, and their impressions
of Stanford today seemed to
focus on "unhealthy" changes.
Alumni asked about David
Harris, who quit as student body
president a year ago. One fac
ulty member who spoke at the
conference was questioned about
the Dean Allen affair of early
1965. A 1947 graduate criticized
"violence" on campus and spoke
bitterly of "giving blood to
North Vietnam," referring to an
incident two years ago.
During the luncheon, speeches
and recepition, the strong politi
cal conservatism of Southern
California was evident. In con

trast, President Wallace Sterling
sounded vaguely radical in his
farewell speech to the Los An
geles alumni.
Sterling mentioned "equal ed
ucational opportunity" and "hu
man capital" in his discussion
of the enduring problems of uni
versities and their coming fi
nancial "crisis."
He did not compromise his
liberal views. There were quick,
silent glances in the audience
when Sterling spoke of the
problems of ghettos, urban re
newal, pollution and civil rights
impinging "so forcefully on the
American dream of 'liberty and
justice for all'."
An ironical reference to Am
erica once being described as
a "reluctant giant" in interna
tional affairs brought no re
action from the alumni. At Stan
ford the response would be
laughter.
The theme of Sterling's
speech was the need for a
"national policy clearly under
stood and stated" for financ
ing of higher education. Ex
penditures for education have
soared. Sterling said, but gov
ernment support has been
fragmented and uncertain.
But Sterling also had some
fun "teasing the alums," as he
said afterwards. He quoted a
"student editorial" stating, ". . .
by all that is holy in the Declar
ation of Independence we are
masters here. . . . What we need
is student control."

The alumni burst out laugh
ing. Then Sterling identified the
editorial as an opinion of Stan
ford students in 1908.
In general Sterling expressed
a modern view of the Univer
sity — an institution which must
"respond effectively to society's
increasing demands." But many
of the almuni, who have chil
dren of college age, seemed to
be more in agreement with the
'47 grad who believes "the Uni
versity should keep students on
the right track."

The mood of the 1000 different
people at the conference can
not be described by a few ex
amples. But the audience re
sponse to a panel on "Politics &
'68" showed the majority feeling.
Panelist W. Glenn Campbell,
director of the Hoover Institu
tion, received intense applause
when he said: "Yes, I actively
supported the Republican presi
dential candidate in 1964 (Gold
water). I supported the Repub
lican candidate for governor in
1966 (Reagan). . . . And I would
do it again."
Other panel members were
economics Prof. John Gurley,
political science Prof. Robert
Horn, and emeritus political sci
ence Prof. Thomas S. Barclay,
who taught at Stanford from
1927 to 1957.
Gurley came across as the
most radical of the professors
addressing the alumni. He
called the Vietnam war "im
moral." A few tense mo
ments later, Campbell Identi
fied him as a member of the
Peace and Freedom party.
A Vietnam war veteran ques
tioned Gurley from the floor
about the use of two r,ooms in
Tresidder by the anti-draft un
ion. The veteran pointed out that
this organization was planning
protests at the Oakland induc
tion center. "Do you think this
is proper use of University
space?" he demanded.
Gurley said he approved of
giving Tresidder space to the
anti-draft group. When the vet
eran shouted, "If I wanted two
rooms to support Adolph Hitler

would I rate space or what?" he
was ruled out of order.
Campbell pleased the audience
most. He was interrupted with
applause when he said, "If they'd
elected our man (Goldwater) in
1964 the war would have been
over a year ago." And again af
ter the assertion, "Private en
terprise has done more to end
poverty than all the government
programs in the world laid end
to end."
Campbell also questioned
the Importance Sterling:
placed on federal aid to edu
cation. "If the federal govern
ment will keep its hands off,
the Income from private
sources will exceed the needs
of universities over the next
decade."
Did Sterling's remarks on fed
eral aid discourage conservative
alumni from contributing money
to Stanford? Sterling himself
feels it "cuts both ways." Some
alumni will feel their gifts are
unnecessary, but others will give
money to "head off" federal con
trol, Sterling believes. Vice Pres
ident for Finance Kenneth Cuth
bertson gave the same answer.

The alumni burst out laugh
ing. Then Sterling identified the
editorial as an opinion of Stan
ford students in 1908.
In general Sterling expressed
a modern view of the Univer
sity — an institution which must
"respond effectively to society's
increasing demands." But many
of the almuni, who have chil
dren of college age, seemed to
be more in agreement with the
'47 grad who believes "the Uni
versity should keep students on
the right track."

The mood of the 1000 different
people at the conference can
not be described by a few ex
amples. But the audience re
sponse to a panel on "Politics &
'68" showed the majority feeling.
Panelist W. Glenn Campbell,
director of the Hoover Institu
tion, received intense applause
when he said: "Yes, I actively
supported the Republican presi
dential candidate in 1964 (Gold
water). I supported the Repub
lican candidate for governor in
1966 (Reagan). . . . And I would
do it again."
Other panel members were
economics Prof. John Gurley,
political science Prof. Robert
Horn, and emeritus political sci
ence Prof. Thomas S. Barclay,
who taught at Stanford from
1927 to 1957.
Gurley came across as the
most radical of the professors
addressing the alumni. He
called the Vietnam war "im
moral." A few tense mo
ments later, Campbell Identi
fied him as a member of the
Peace and Freedom party.
A Vietnam war veteran ques
tioned Gurley from the floor
about the use of two r,ooms in
Tresidder by the anti-draft un
ion. The veteran pointed out that
this organization was planning
protests at the Oakland induc
tion center. "Do you think this
is proper use of University
space?" he demanded.
Gurley said he approved of
giving Tresidder space to the
anti-draft group. When the vet
eran shouted, "If I wanted two
rooms to support Adolph Hitler

would I rate space or what?" he
was ruled out of order.
Campbell pleased the audience
most. He was interrupted with
applause when he said, "If they'd
elected our man (Goldwater) in
1964 the war would have been
over a year ago." And again af
ter the assertion, "Private en
terprise has done more to end
poverty than all the government
programs in the world laid end
to end."
Campbell also questioned
the Importance Sterling:
placed on federal aid to edu
cation. "If the federal govern
ment will keep its hands off,
the Income from private
sources will exceed the needs
of universities over the next
decade."
Did Sterling's remarks on fed
eral aid discourage conservative
alumni from contributing money
to Stanford? Sterling himself
feels it "cuts both ways." Some
alumni will feel their gifts are
unnecessary, but others will give
money to "head off" federal con
trol, Sterling believes. Vice Pres
ident for Finance Kenneth Cuth
bertson gave the same answer.
"All we cared about was hav
ing good times —sex, booze and
sports."
A 1956 Stanford graduate
mused over a drink at the
alumni conference Sunday amid
the gaudy splendor of the Cen
tury Plaza hotel in Los Angeles.
"We were like sheep," his
wife added. "We just followed
along." She expressed admira
tion for the interest of today's
students in the Peace Corps.
These two alumni sensed the
growing gulf between them
selves and the University.
Very few recent graduates at
tended Sunday's conference.
Only a handful of students
were present. Most of the
overflow crowd belonged to
Stanford classes of the 1930'5,
1940*9 and 1950'5.
Their Stanford was a differ
ent place, and their impressions
of Stanford today seemed to
focus on "unhealthy" changes.
Alumni asked about David
Harris, who quit as student body
president a year ago. One fac
ulty member who spoke at the
conference was questioned about
the Dean Allen affair of early
1965. A 1947 graduate criticized
"violence" on campus and spoke
bitterly of "giving blood to
North Vietnam," referring to an
incident two years ago.
During the luncheon, speeches
and recepition, the strong politi
cal conservatism of Southern
California was evident. In con

trast, President Wallace Sterling
sounded vaguely radical in his
farewell speech to the Los An
geles alumni.
Sterling mentioned "equal ed
ucational opportunity" and "hu
man capital" in his discussion
of the enduring problems of uni
versities and their coming fi
nancial "crisis."
He did not compromise his
liberal views. There were quick,
silent glances in the audience
when Sterling spoke of the
problems of ghettos, urban re
newal, pollution and civil rights
impinging "so forcefully on the
American dream of 'liberty and
justice for all'."
An ironical reference to Am
erica once being described as
a "reluctant giant" in interna
tional affairs brought no re
action from the alumni. At Stan
ford the response would be
laughter.
The theme of Sterling's
speech was the need for a
"national policy clearly under
stood and stated" for financ
ing of higher education. Ex
penditures for education have
soared. Sterling said, but gov
ernment support has been
fragmented and uncertain.
But Sterling also had some
fun "teasing the alums," as he
said afterwards. He quoted a
"student editorial" stating, ". . .
by all that is holy in the Declar
ation of Independence we are
masters here. . . . What we need
is student control."

The alumni burst out laugh

to Stanford? Sterling himself

"All we cared about was hav

A 1956 Stanford graduate
mused over a drink at the
alumni conference Sunday amid
the gaudy splendor of the Cen
tury Plaza hotel in Los Angeles.
"We were like sheep," his
wife added. "We just followed
along." She expressed admira
tion for the interest of today's
students in the Peace Corps.
These two alumni sensed the
growing gulf between them
selves and the University.
Very few recent graduates at
tended Sunday's conference.
Only a handful of students
were present. Most of the
overflow crowd belonged to
Stanford classes of the 1930'5,
1940*9 and 1950'5.
Their Stanford was a differ
ent place, and their impressions
of Stanford today seemed to
focus on "unhealthy" changes.
Alumni asked about David
Harris, who quit as student body
president a year ago. One fac
ulty member who spoke at the
conference was questioned about
the Dean Allen affair of early
1965. A 1947 graduate criticized
"violence" on campus and spoke
bitterly of "giving blood to
North Vietnam," referring to an
incident two years ago.
During the luncheon, speeches
and recepition, the strong politi
cal conservatism of Southern
California was evident. In con

trast, President Wallace Sterling
sounded vaguely radical in his
farewell speech to the Los An
geles alumni.
Sterling mentioned "equal ed
ucational opportunity" and "hu
man capital" in his discussion
of the enduring problems of uni
versities and their coming fi
nancial "crisis."
He did not compromise his
liberal views. There were quick,
silent glances in the audience
when Sterling spoke of the
problems of ghettos, urban re
newal, pollution and civil rights
impinging "so forcefully on the
American dream of 'liberty and
justice for all'."
An ironical reference to Am
erica once being described as
a "reluctant giant" in interna
tional affairs brought no re
action from the alumni. At Stan
ford the response would be
laughter.
The theme of Sterling's
speech was the need for a
"national policy clearly under
stood and stated" for financ
ing of higher education. Ex
penditures for education have
soared. Sterling said, but gov
ernment support has been
fragmented and uncertain.
But Sterling also had some
fun "teasing the alums," as he
said afterwards. He quoted a
"student editorial" stating, ". . .
by all that is holy in the Declar
ation of Independence we are
masters here. . . . What we need
is student control."

The alumni burst out laugh
ing. Then Sterling identified the
editorial as an opinion of Stan
ford students in 1908.
In general Sterling expressed
a modern view of the Univer
sity — an institution which must
"respond effectively to society's
increasing demands." But many
of the almuni, who have chil
dren of college age, seemed to
be more in agreement with the
'47 grad who believes "the Uni
versity should keep students on
the right track."

The mood of the 1000 different
people at the conference can
not be described by a few ex
amples. But the audience re
sponse to a panel on "Politics &
'68" showed the majority feeling.
Panelist W. Glenn Campbell,
director of the Hoover Institu
tion, received intense applause
when he said: "Yes, I actively
supported the Republican presi
dential candidate in 1964 (Gold
water). I supported the Repub
lican candidate for governor in
1966 (Reagan). . . . And I would
do it again."
Other panel members were
economics Prof. John Gurley,
political science Prof. Robert
Horn, and emeritus political sci
ence Prof. Thomas S. Barclay,
who taught at Stanford from
1927 to 1957.
Gurley came across as the
most radical of the professors
addressing the alumni. He
called the Vietnam war "im
moral." A few tense mo
ments later, Campbell Identi
fied him as a member of the
Peace and Freedom party.
A Vietnam war veteran ques
tioned Gurley from the floor
about the use of two r,ooms in
Tresidder by the anti-draft un
ion. The veteran pointed out that
this organization was planning
protests at the Oakland induc
tion center. "Do you think this
is proper use of University
space?" he demanded.
Gurley said he approved of
giving Tresidder space to the
anti-draft group. When the vet
eran shouted, "If I wanted two
rooms to support Adolph Hitler

would I rate space or what?" he
was ruled out of order.
Campbell pleased the audience
most. He was interrupted with
applause when he said, "If they'd
elected our man (Goldwater) in
1964 the war would have been
over a year ago." And again af
ter the assertion, "Private en
terprise has done more to end
poverty than all the government
programs in the world laid end
to end."
Campbell also questioned
the Importance Sterling:
placed on federal aid to edu
cation. "If the federal govern
ment will keep its hands off,
the Income from private
sources will exceed the needs
of universities over the next
decade."
Did Sterling's remarks on fed
eral aid discourage conservative
alumni from contributing money
to Stanford? Sterling himself
feels it "cuts both ways." Some

unnecessary, but others will give
