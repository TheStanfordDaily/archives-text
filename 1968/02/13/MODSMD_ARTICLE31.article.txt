## 
### 
At a conference meeting last
week the Pacific Eight turned
thumbs down on freshman parti
cipation on varsity teams during
both regular season play and
in NCAA championship events.
However, freshman participa
tion in NCAA championships
will be allowed during the aca
demic year, 1968-69.
The proposals for this year
were both voted down by deci
sive 7-1 margins. The third pro
posal passed by what Stanford
Representative Dr. Rixford K.
Snyder called "a close margin."
Dr. Snyder voted with the ma
jority against freshman par
ticipation this year. "The fresh
man year is a period of ad
justment. The athlete should
not be subjected to the ad
ditional pressures of varsity
competition until his second
year," commented Dr. Snyder.
Stanford's swimming team
will be most affected by the de
cision. Coach Jim Gaughran had
hoped to boLster his lineup for
the NCAA championships with
many talented freshmen. It will
now take a super effort by the
varsity to repeat as national
champs.
