# Ruggers Top USC With Good 1st Half
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
A strong first half effort car
ried the Stanford rugby team
to an 8-6 victory over USC Sat
urday. The Tribe chalked up all
their points early and held on
for a somewhat sloppy but
nonetheless satisfying victory.
The USC squad was very big
and fast, but it was apparent
that they thought like football
players rather than ruggers.
Their ball handling was
sloppy, and two of the backs
had the rather distressing habit
of kicking the ball backwards.
One of these amazing kicks
led directly to Stanford's first
score. Standoff Ray Wilson
broke through and stole the
ball away from the USC full
back, who was unbelievingly
trying to field the wrong-way
boot from his own man.
Wilson's try equalized an
early USC penalty kick, and
Leon Hartvickson's conversion
put the Tribe ahead 5-3.
The Tribe's final tallies
came on a penalty kick. Hart

vlckson's talented toe more
than made up for a blatent
offside maneuver by the USC
scrum half.
Dick Ragsdale, still bothered
somewhat by injuries, sat out
the second half.
His presence was apparently
sorely missed, for the Tribe
played a sloppy second half, and
spent a lot of time bogged down
in its own territory.
Despite the good performance
of Steve McConnel, USC could
manage only one second period
penalty kick, and the whistle
ended the match at 8-6, Stan
ford.
The second team continued
its Impressive play with a
31-0 pulverizing of San Fran
cisco State. The seconds have
now beaten every college team
they have faced.
The thirds made it a clean
sweep by getting past the Penin
sula Ramblers second team, 14-
10.
Next Saturday the Ruggers
will meet UCLA at Los An
geles.
