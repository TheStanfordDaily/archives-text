# Century 21 Tonight:
## Katz Will Investigate Student Needs, Growth 
### 
"Student Development and
Higher Education" will be the
topic of tonight's Century 21
lecture by Joseph Katz at 7:30
p.m. in the Tresidder Large
Lounge.
Katz, as the former research
director of the Student Develop
ment Study and present associ
ate director of the Stanford In
stitute for the Study of Human
Problems, has been involved in
a comprehensive survey of the
problems of the college student
and his relationship to the uni
versity establishment.
Among his special concerns
have been students' attitudes to
ward teachers and curriculum,
their relationships with parents
and fellow students, and their
development of personal values
in college. In a recently pub
lished report, the result of a five
year study of students at Stan
ford and the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley. Dr. Katz
observes:

"The asumption that the col
lege student role as presently
conceived is appropriate for
everyone between 17 and 21 de
serves challenge either in order
to enlarge the programs of pres
ent institutions or to devise new
institutions, so that academic
and developmental objectives
can be brought in greater har
mony with each other."
Possible areas of reform rec
ommended by the report include
further modification of grading
systems, earlier opportunities
for student teaching, independ
ent study and research, and
greater freedom of choice in uni
versity housing arrangements.
Dr. Katz has also been in
volved in a recent study of stu
dent activism, focused especially
on the Berkeley riots of 1965.
In a published report of his find
ings he notes:
"In spite of the jolt that insti
tutions have received in the last
few years, there has not been

enough effort to search out the
underlying causes of student
protest. There has been even
less attempt to modify substan
tially the relevant educational
arrangements. Until this hap
pens, one may safely predict
continued clashes, or as an alter
native, a fresh retreat to
apathy."
In these and other related
studies, Dr. Katz continues to
voice the need for reform and
continued evaluation of the uni
versity system and its relevance
to the student it is trying to
educate.
