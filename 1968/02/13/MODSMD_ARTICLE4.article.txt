## Thieu: More GI's Needed 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — South Viet
nam's president said Monday
allied forces can hold the line in
Vietnam but more U.S. troops
will be needed to bring the war
to a quick end.
President Nguyen Van Thieu
spoke while U.S. Marines and
South Vietnamese fought togeth
er in Hue in an effor.t to wipe
out the last major pocket of
Comumnist resistance in the
walled Citadel. South Viet
namese warplanes pounded the
fortress.
"We can hold the Commu
nists," Thieu said, "but to end
the war faster is another mat
ter." He said the series of Com
munist attacks showed that one
Viet Cong battalion in a city "de
mands at least five times as
many troops on our side to de
stroy them."
The United States now has
more than 500,000 troops in
South Vietnam.
The Vietnamese air force took
advantage of clearing weather,
to bomb and strafe the die-hard
Communist forces that have
held the Citadel for two weeks
despite South Vietnamese ef
forts to drive them out. U.S.
Marine reinforcements were
called in and entered the Citadel
for the first time.
There were other actions
around the country in the sec
ond week of the Communist of
fensive, including some fighting
(n the outskirts of Saigon.
The Marine base at Khe Sanh,
anticipating a major Commu
nist attack, received the usual
sporadic enemy shelling.
In Saigon, there was little sig
nificant street fighting Monday
for the first time in two weeks,
although several sharp clashes
erupted along the edges of the
capital.

• U.S., S. Korea Talk
SEOUL (AP) — U.S. special
envoy Cyrus R. Vance had a
three-hour talk Monday with
President Chung Hee Park and
other Korean officials aimed at
shoring up a rift between the
two allies.
The Americans and North
Koreans have held a series of
five talks at Panmunjom truce
village on the Pueblo incident
from which both the South Ko
reans and the Communist Chi
nese allies of North Korea were
barred.
The South Korean public,
press and political leaders did
not like the secrecy. It was felt
that the Americans were paying
attention to the Pueblo and its
crew at the expense of the
North Korean threat to South
Korea, that the United States

might appease the North Ko
reans and thus threaten South
Korean security.
The U.S. Embassy said only
that the talks included a "free,
friendly and candid exchange of
views." A spokesman for Park
said the meeting was conducted
in a "sincere atmosphere" but
he to say if there wore
any differences between the two
groups or whether any progress
was made.

minute question and answer ses

gone just as far as decent and
honorable people can go."
But he said he stands behind

ing of North Vietnam and talk
promptly if the Communists in
dicated this would be produc
tive.
But. addressing the Commu
nists in effect, he added: "We
don't want you to take advan
tage like you did during the

change a "could" to a "will" or
indulge in any other semantical
niceties in stating its position.

Abel, president of the United
Steelworkers Union, resigned
yesterday from the board of the
Americans for Democratic Ac
tion ADA over, the group's en
dorsement of peace candidate
Sen. Eugene McCarthy for pres
ident.
"The board's repudiation of
President Johnson on the basis
of a single issue in a time of na
tional concern and committ
ment, while ignoring the Presi

concern to ADA, is unwarrant
ed, unrealistic, shortsighted and
ignores the realities of the
present political situation," said
Abel's resignation.
The ADA endorsed the Minne

its national board Saturday in
Washington.
It was the first time in 20
years that the ADA has failed to
