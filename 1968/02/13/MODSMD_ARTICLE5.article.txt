# Keep Frosh Excited, Panel Tells Stanford
## 
### MARGARET MoGAUGHEY 
Freshman education programs
need to sustain the curiosity
and excitement freshmen have
when they arrive at Stanford, a
panel decided in Junipero
Lounge last night.
Dr. Joseph Katz of the Social
Sciences Research Study, Math
ematics Prof. Halsay Royden,
freshman English director Rob
ert Polhemus, Chemistry Prof.
Richard Eastman, and History
Prof. Gordon Craig joined stu
dents Norman Batkin and Hugh
West to discuss the problems of
freshman year.
Freshman year ought to be a
time in which imagination and
intellectual curiosity can "grow
as best it might, according to
Polhemus.
"It should be an opportunity
for exposure to competent

scholars who can ask and an
swer questions the freshmen
can't," Polhemus said.
Batkin, a member of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES) steering committee,
suggested freshman year be
a period of shelter from "ob
ligations that make it hard to
solve individual problems, a
psycho-social moratorium."
Other crucial problems the
panel discussed included bore
dom with the curriculum, poor
high school preparation, and the
inflexible ideas of discipline en
forced by some professors.
Katz suggested that the basic
fallacy in Stanford's freshman
program is its unified curricu
lum. He claimed it does not
meet the differing needs of in
dividuals. He pointed out that
some students still need the
incentive of letter grades when
they arrive at Stanford.
But he added that some stu
dents would learn more without
grade pressures and are in fact
fettered by the present system.
The panel agreed the university
must diversify its approach.
Several panelists suggested
that the whole of freshman year
might be an extended orienta
tion period. One student in the
audience advised that freshmen
tak ) no courses for credit, but
audit a number of them before
choosing a major field.
Some audience members
feared, however, that in giv
ing freshmen such specialized
treatment, the university was
fostering a "fantastic pater
nalism."
West, a freshman spon
sor,, pointed out that all trauma
is not necessarily bad. A stu
dent in the audience concur

red that everyone is involved in
identity crisis, and said that it
is not the job of the academic
community to solve them.
"The role of the university cur
riculum is not to solve personal
problems, but to take advantage
of unique resources," added Roy
den.
The panelists and the audi
ence agreed, however, that cer
tain concrete improvements
could be made. Economic incen
tives might lure top calibre
Ph.D. candidates to Stanford to
increase the possibility of in
dividual attention for freshmen
in large lecture courses.
Professors, they also agreed,
could be more generous in re
alizing that freshman year is,
to a large extent, a period of
adjustment, and ease the aca
demic pressures accordingly.
Craig suggested that a change
in the physical arrangement of
classrooms might stimulate not
only freshmen, but all students.
"A simple matter of furniture,"
he said, "can make the difference
in stimulating learning."
