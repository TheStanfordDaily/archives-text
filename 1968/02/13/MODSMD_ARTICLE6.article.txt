# Industrialist Denies U.S. Reign Over European Businesses
## 
### 
The penetration of American
management in European busi
ness will not create another
U.S.A. abroad, Arnold H. Mare
mont told the Graduate School
of Business here yesterday,
yesterday.
The Chicago business execu
tive, who heads Maremont Corp.,
flatly disputed the central thesis
of "Le Defi Americain" ('The
American Challenge"), a now
book by Jean Jacques Servan
Schriber which has sold 400,000
copies on the Continent.
"Europe will develop it own
kind of managerial skills,"
Maremont said. "Many will be

borrowed from the U.S., but
they will be modified. They will
be Continental.
"It is inconceivable to me that
American business, regardless
of its investment abroad, will
create de facto American col
onies.
"There is an empiricism that
prevails. The cloth will be cut to
fit local conditions. Neither now
nor in the near future will one
stereotyped business executive
dominate the world's concerns."
He cited sports cars and films
as indicative of European man
agement's ability to prosper in
specialty markets.
"When we send our own ex
ecutives abroad they quickly,
sometimes too quickly, modify
their decisions to meet what

they call local conditions," he
said. In Spain and France, he
noted, companies are considered
responsible for continuing their
employees' jobs. "Legislation in
hibits the free-wheeling kind of
tough management we have
here," Maremont said.
Among the significant ele
ments which American man
agement enjoys and Europe still
lacks, he listed:
Maremont criticized the trend
to create a "president's office"
group to head large American
firms.
