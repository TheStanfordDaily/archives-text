# Senior Believed Dead
## 
### 
John C. Morgan, 21, a senior
political science major at Stan
ford, was tentatively identified
yesterday as the man who fell
to his death Sunday after a
Navy plane crash stalled traffic
on the San Francisco-Oakland
bay bridge.
Although the California High
way Patrol quoted a motorist as
saying he saw Morgan get out
of his car, run to the bridge
railing and leap, radio reports
yesterday said other motorists
saw him slip off the side of the
bridge.
John Kidde, president of the
Delta Upsilon fraternity, of
which Morgan was a member,
said yesterday,"I can't imagine
John doing anything like com
mitting suicide. He was the type

who used to talk about his prob
lems, rather than keep them to
himself."
Kidde also said Morgan had
been accepted for law school at
George Washington University,
Washington, D.C. "He didn't
seem to have a care in the
world," Kidde said.
Morgan, a member of a so
cially prominent New York fam
ily, lived with several other fra
ternity brothers at 903 Paradise
Way, Barron Park.
The D.U. house cancelled its
open house last night, but will
hold rush Thursday night.
House members are trying to
arrange funeral services in Me
morial church. Searchers are
still trying to find Morgan's
body.
