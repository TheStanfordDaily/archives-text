NOV DODGE CORONET "SUPER BEE
Scat Pack performance at a new low price. i
Punching a Super Bee is like dropping a bowling ball down an elevator shaft. It starts rather J A
suddenly and improves from there. Owning a Super Bee is discovering that Piper-Heidsieck ■vs.
is selling at beer prices. Let's face it. When you put a hot cammed 383 V8 in a light coupe body, H
hang all the good stuff underneath, and price it below anything as quick, something's got to H
happen. The good stuff is listed below. The kicks are waiting at your nearby Dodge Dealer's. I
Let it happen to you.
