The Way to World Peace
Famed and eminent British historian Arnold J. Toynbee de
clared recently that civilization has reached the point where
the very continuity of the human race depends upon the forma
tion of world government. 'It is the mutual interest of the
nations to subordinate their national sovereignty to world
authorities," he said, "This is the only condition on which the
nations can survive in an atomic age".
In the light of world developments it is interesting to con
sider the words of Jesus Christ. About two thousand years ago
the Prince of Peace told his followers: "You will hear of wars
and rumors of wars,- see that you are not alarmed; for this
must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise
against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will
be famines and earthquakes in various places; all this is but
the beginning of sufferings. . (Matthew 24:1-8).
According to the Bible, history's darkest hour lies ahead, a
period of destruction and death far exceeding the toll and
travail of two world wars. From this holocaust only a few
will be saved.
Those who seek to bring about peace on earth should
acquaint themselves with God's way and methods, for His
great purpose in present times is to call, out of a lost and
dying world, a group of people to Himself (Acts 15:13-18).
The Kingdom of God begins with changed human hearts
through personally receiving Jesus Christ as Lord. Jesus
Christ, who came to bring peace to men, also made it clear
He was on earth to divide and to separate men (Matthew
10:33-34, 25=31-46).
God's solution to the problem of world peace is to silently
and invisibly change men's lives by transforming them from
within. Those who meet and receive Jesus Christ have not
only the peace of God here and now, but look expectantly
and condently to the day when His program for world peace
has fully come.
There is only one effective way you can work for world
peace and that is by accepting God's plans and methods.
Commit your life to Jesus Christ and become His instrument
of righteousness and His avenue of expression in a warring
world whose rebellion is basically against God alone.
