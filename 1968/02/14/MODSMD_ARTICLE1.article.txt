# McGee: Power Balance Key To Asian Stability
## 
### 
American presence in Vietnam
is aimed at stabilization of the
entire area so that the large
vacuum left from the "old, out
moded structure of white man's
colonialism is filled," Sen. Gale
McGee claimed yesterday.
Halting Communist aggression
in Southeast Asia "will move
us toward a higher level of se
curity in the world," since a new
balance of power may even bring
Red China "into the mainstream
of world events," the Wyoming
Democrat told an audience in
half-filled Dinkelspiel Auditor
ium.
McGee sees a balance of
power with a permanently
divided Vietnam as the only
substitute for war yet devised.
Wars, however, "are things
that sometimes allow us to do
things better the second time
around."
A self-professed liberal who
nevertheless strongly supports

President Johnson's Vietnam pol
icy, McGee claimed that the bal
ance of power concept has work
ed quite well to reduce tensions
in two divided areas — Germany
and Korea.
McGee cited support fiom
former United Nations Ambassa
dor Adlai Stevenson who said,
"We want one world, not a
divided world. But a divided
world is better than none at all."
His personal tours of Asian
areas have convinced him, he
said, that the nations surround
ing Red China are all grateful
that the U.S. has stepped in to
aid South Vietnam.
Political leaders in countries
ranging from India to Japan,
McGee feels, think U.S. interven
tion and preservation of a bal
ance has made the difference.
"They can say, *We have a
chance now,' where before they
would have certainly fallen be
fore a 'wave of the future,' " —
meaning a series of Chinese
Communist-inspired revolutins.
McGee asserted that the dom
ino theory is not a theory, but a
"domino fact." He cited evidence
that Hanoi-trained troops have
infiltrated, not only South Viet
nam, but Cambodia, Laos, and
other surrounding countries as
well.
"What would have happened
in Southeast Asia if we had not
stood? Would they all have fal
len?" According to McGee, all
conclusions show that a "skill
fully planned intervention" is
underway throughout the area
that "we must restrain. That
kind of a role must be blocked."
America's committment to the
area stem from the political void
left after World War 11, McGee
claimed. Because of our large
previous committment, "we have
a deep obligation for our times
of putting those pieces back to
gether."
"It is irresponsible liberal
ism to run away from this.
It is positive liberal philosophy
to take on the costly, but mean
ingful committment."
He said that the United States
is the only country that could
meet the demand and help bring
stability. "Only the United States
has the resources and capabili

ties to do something about this.
What we have done for the large
part has been positive."
In an after dinner informal
discussion with 40 students and
faculty mebmers in the Larkin
lounge the senator made the
"safe prediction that if a Nixon,
Romney, Rockefeller or Robert
Kennedy were president prob
ably the same compelling nation
al interests would govern them
as President Johnson now must
contend with."
Questioned by a student about
"dissent on the college campus"
McGee remarked that his "cru
sading for the campuses" has
been rewarding because of the
"pointed questions raised by the
students."
Defending the U.S. policy of
"using force to stop force" in

Southeast Asia, he stated, "If
Southeast Asia would go, all
of the Impulses from Peking
would be enhanced."
"We must restrain or contain
Communist aggression because
not to do so would be to invite
uncontrollable events in the fu
ture," he continued. "So we
must continue 'playing the odds
with a goal in mind.'"
According to McGee there
doesn't seem to be any substitute
for the bi polar structure within
the next generation. "There Is
no other viable method to avoid
another world war except with
this 'balance of terror.' "
He cited Pakistan, India and
Afghanistan as examples where
the two "great powers" were
able to keep things from "get
ting out of hand."

CONFRONTATION — Chicago Industrialist Arnold H. Maremont yesterday visited the Peace and
Freedom Commune In East Palo Alto to talk with former student body president Dave Harris. "In
the Graduate School of Business, almost everywhere I turn," said Maremont, "people say business lias
all the answers. I've been In business a long 1 time and I don't believe that."
Maremont generally asked questions of Harris about the New Left, Christianity, capitalism, and
Harris' conception of "a community of brotherhood utilizing a whole new kind of power — human
love." Harris said that he tells others "to try to begin to realize this in your own life, and parti
cipate in activities that will help others come to realize it also."
Maremont debates banker Bart Lytton at noon today in Dinkelspiel auditorium on buslness's

aid South Vietnam.
Political leaders in countries
ranging from India to Japan,
McGee feels, think U.S. interven
tion and preservation of a bal
ance has made the difference.
"They can say, *We have a
chance now,' where before they
would have certainly fallen be
fore a 'wave of the future,' " —
meaning a series of Chinese
Communist-inspired revolutins.
McGee asserted that the dom
ino theory is not a theory, but a
"domino fact." He cited evidence
that Hanoi-trained troops have
infiltrated, not only South Viet
nam, but Cambodia, Laos, and
other surrounding countries as
well.
"What would have happened
in Southeast Asia if we had not
stood? Would they all have fal
len?" According to McGee, all
conclusions show that a "skill
fully planned intervention" is
underway throughout the area
that "we must restrain. That
kind of a role must be blocked."
America's committment to the
area stem from the political void
left after World War 11, McGee
claimed. Because of our large
previous committment, "we have
a deep obligation for our times
of putting those pieces back to
gether."
"It is irresponsible liberal
ism to run away from this.
It is positive liberal philosophy
to take on the costly, but mean
ingful committment."
He said that the United States
is the only country that could
meet the demand and help bring
stability. "Only the United States
has the resources and capabili

ties to do something about this.
What we have done for the large
part has been positive."
In an after dinner informal
discussion with 40 students and
faculty mebmers in the Larkin
lounge the senator made the
"safe prediction that if a Nixon,
Romney, Rockefeller or Robert
Kennedy were president prob
ably the same compelling nation
al interests would govern them
as President Johnson now must
contend with."
Questioned by a student about
"dissent on the college campus"
McGee remarked that his "cru
sading for the campuses" has
been rewarding because of the
"pointed questions raised by the
students."
Defending the U.S. policy of
"using force to stop force" in

Southeast Asia, he stated, "If
Southeast Asia would go, all
of the Impulses from Peking
would be enhanced."
"We must restrain or contain
Communist aggression because
not to do so would be to invite
uncontrollable events in the fu
ture," he continued. "So we
must continue 'playing the odds
with a goal in mind.'"
According to McGee there
doesn't seem to be any substitute
for the bi polar structure within
the next generation. "There Is
no other viable method to avoid
another world war except with
this 'balance of terror.' "
He cited Pakistan, India and
Afghanistan as examples where
the two "great powers" were
able to keep things from "get
ting out of hand."

CONFRONTATION — Chicago Industrialist Arnold H. Maremont yesterday visited the Peace and
Freedom Commune In East Palo Alto to talk with former student body president Dave Harris. "In
the Graduate School of Business, almost everywhere I turn," said Maremont, "people say business lias
all the answers. I've been In business a long 1 time and I don't believe that."
Maremont generally asked questions of Harris about the New Left, Christianity, capitalism, and
Harris' conception of "a community of brotherhood utilizing a whole new kind of power — human
love." Harris said that he tells others "to try to begin to realize this in your own life, and parti
cipate in activities that will help others come to realize it also."
Maremont debates banker Bart Lytton at noon today in Dinkelspiel auditorium on buslness's
social responsibility.
American presence in Vietnam
is aimed at stabilization of the
entire area so that the large
vacuum left from the "old, out
moded structure of white man's
colonialism is filled," Sen. Gale
McGee claimed yesterday.
Halting Communist aggression
in Southeast Asia "will move
us toward a higher level of se
curity in the world," since a new
balance of power may even bring
Red China "into the mainstream
of world events," the Wyoming
Democrat told an audience in
half-filled Dinkelspiel Auditor
ium.
McGee sees a balance of
power with a permanently
divided Vietnam as the only
substitute for war yet devised.
Wars, however, "are things
that sometimes allow us to do
things better the second time
around."
A self-professed liberal who
nevertheless strongly supports

President Johnson's Vietnam pol
icy, McGee claimed that the bal
ance of power concept has work
ed quite well to reduce tensions
in two divided areas — Germany
and Korea.
McGee cited support fiom
former United Nations Ambassa
dor Adlai Stevenson who said,
"We want one world, not a
divided world. But a divided
world is better than none at all."
His personal tours of Asian
areas have convinced him, he
said, that the nations surround

ingful committment."
He said that the United States
is the only country that could
meet the demand and help bring
stability. "Only the United States
has the resources and capabili

ties to do something about this.
What we have done for the large
part has been positive."
In an after dinner informal
discussion with 40 students and
faculty mebmers in the Larkin
lounge the senator made the
"safe prediction that if a Nixon,
Romney, Rockefeller or Robert
Kennedy were president prob
ably the same compelling nation
al interests would govern them
as President Johnson now must
contend with."
Questioned by a student about
"dissent on the college campus"
McGee remarked that his "cru
sading for the campuses" has
been rewarding because of the
"pointed questions raised by the
students."
Defending the U.S. policy of
"using force to stop force" in

Southeast Asia, he stated, "If
Southeast Asia would go, all
of the Impulses from Peking
would be enhanced."
"We must restrain or contain
Communist aggression because
not to do so would be to invite
uncontrollable events in the fu
ture," he continued. "So we
must continue 'playing the odds
with a goal in mind.'"
According to McGee there
doesn't seem to be any substitute
for the bi polar structure within
the next generation. "There Is
no other viable method to avoid
another world war except with
this 'balance of terror.' "
He cited Pakistan, India and
Afghanistan as examples where
the two "great powers" were
able to keep things from "get
ting out of hand."

CONFRONTATION — Chicago Industrialist Arnold H. Maremont yesterday visited the Peace and
Freedom Commune In East Palo Alto to talk with former student body president Dave Harris. "In
the Graduate School of Business, almost everywhere I turn," said Maremont, "people say business lias
all the answers. I've been In business a long 1 time and I don't believe that."
Maremont generally asked questions of Harris about the New Left, Christianity, capitalism, and
Harris' conception of "a community of brotherhood utilizing a whole new kind of power — human
love." Harris said that he tells others "to try to begin to realize this in your own life, and parti
cipate in activities that will help others come to realize it also."
Maremont debates banker Bart Lytton at noon today in Dinkelspiel auditorium on buslness's
social responsibility.
American presence in Vietnam
is aimed at stabilization of the
entire area so that the large
vacuum left from the "old, out
moded structure of white man's
colonialism is filled," Sen. Gale
McGee claimed yesterday.
Halting Communist aggression
in Southeast Asia "will move
us toward a higher level of se
curity in the world," since a new
balance of power may even bring
Red China "into the mainstream
of world events," the Wyoming
Democrat told an audience in
half-filled Dinkelspiel Auditor
ium.
McGee sees a balance of
power with a permanently
divided Vietnam as the only
substitute for war yet devised.
Wars, however, "are things
that sometimes allow us to do
things better the second time
around."
A self-professed liberal who
nevertheless strongly supports

President Johnson's Vietnam pol
icy, McGee claimed that the bal
ance of power concept has work
ed quite well to reduce tensions
in two divided areas — Germany
and Korea.
McGee cited support fiom
former United Nations Ambassa
dor Adlai Stevenson who said,
"We want one world, not a
divided world. But a divided
world is better than none at all."
His personal tours of Asian
areas have convinced him, he
said, that the nations surround
ing Red China are all grateful
that the U.S. has stepped in to
aid South Vietnam.
Political leaders in countries
ranging from India to Japan,
McGee feels, think U.S. interven
tion and preservation of a bal
ance has made the difference.
"They can say, *We have a
chance now,' where before they
would have certainly fallen be
fore a 'wave of the future,' " —
meaning a series of Chinese
Communist-inspired revolutins.
McGee asserted that the dom
ino theory is not a theory, but a
"domino fact." He cited evidence
that Hanoi-trained troops have
infiltrated, not only South Viet
nam, but Cambodia, Laos, and
other surrounding countries as
well.
"What would have happened
in Southeast Asia if we had not
stood? Would they all have fal
len?" According to McGee, all
conclusions show that a "skill
fully planned intervention" is
underway throughout the area
that "we must restrain. That
kind of a role must be blocked."
America's committment to the
area stem from the political void
left after World War 11, McGee
claimed. Because of our large
previous committment, "we have
a deep obligation for our times
of putting those pieces back to
gether."
"It is irresponsible liberal
ism to run away from this.
It is positive liberal philosophy
to take on the costly, but mean
ingful committment."
He said that the United States
is the only country that could
meet the demand and help bring
stability. "Only the United States
