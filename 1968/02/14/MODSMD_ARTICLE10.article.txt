# The
						Letter We Refused
## 
### 
Mr. Roy Weatherup, a candidate for ASSU vice president, is
circulating a piece of campaign literature titled, "The Letter The
Stanford Daily Refused to Print."
Presumably Mr. Weatherup thinks this erroneous title will
make the document more interesting to read. Maybe.
He might also start a fad. People could send us photographs,
which, if not published, they could advertise and sell as "Photo
graphs The Stanford Daily Refused to Print."
Or if The Daily neglects to print the publicity for a meeting or
lecture, it could be advertised as "The Event The Stanford Daily
Refused to Mention."
This could be contagious. How about "The Wedding Engage
ment The Stanford Daily Refused to Announce"? Or "The Ad
ministrator The Stanford Daily Was Afraid to Chastise"?
Would you believe "The Cause The Stanford Daily Refused
to Espouse"?
The philosophical implications alone are staggering. "The
Editorial The Stanford Daily Refused to Write."
"The Man The Stanford Daily Refused to Libel."
Will we ever again have the nerve not to do something?
