## NLF Baffles Other Warriors 
### LEONARD SIEGEL 
The popularity of the Nation
al Liberation Front of South
Vietnam has always perplexed
the American government. The
overwhelming strength recently
demonstrated by the NLF in
South Vietnam's major cities
poses a difficult problem for
those men who are entrusted
with what is absurdly known as
the "Other War."
The purpose of the Other War
riors is to convince the people
of South Vietnam that the
Americans and the American
supported Saigon regime have
the best interests of the people
at heart. Clearly, for some
strange reason, they have failed.
The major battle front of the
Other War has been the pacifi
cation program. The original
impetus of this program was
the fact that the NLF had been
serving Vietnamese peasants
since its formation in 1960.
Our program to convince the
Vietnamese that we wanted to
help them was to mimic a pro
gram of the enemy. Of course,
we often had to herd these peo
ple into refugee camps because
the War (as opposed to the Oth
er War) necessitated our bomb
ing their villages. And we had
to protect them behind barbed
wire from their brothers and
sisters.
Land Reform
A month or so ago a few con
gressmen pointed out to the
American public that the NLF
had an effective land reform
program, whereas the Saigon
government did not. Objectively,

this seems to be a reason for
supporting the guerillas. But no,
the congressmen were interested
in making sure that Saigon dis
tributed land so the people
would know that Saigon cared,
and in exposing the fact that
NLF land reform was Commu
nist, not genuine.
It's strange to hear such pro
ponents of the Other War. They
make no pretense to actually
caring whether the Vietnamese
get land. Their goal is merely
to win them over.
There are two major reasons
why most Americans do not con
sider the NLF a sincere politi
cal force.
The first is traditional. They
have been our enemy for years.
They are shooting our friends
and brothers—indeed, the chief
justification for the war for the
past three years is the belief
that we can't get out.
False Information
The other reason that Ameri
cans condemn the NLF if be
cause the information we re
ceive about the "enemy" is both
false and incomplete. The Na
tional Liberation Front has al
ways claimed to be exactly what
its name implies, a coalition of
nationalist groups.
While admittedly Communists
of one persuasion or another

have always played an impor
tant role—possibly because all
overt foreign support the NLF
receives is from the Socialist
world—the NLF from the start
has always been made up of
various political, labor, and re
ligious organizations.
Now, as the pressure of war
continually polarizes a political
polarization, most of the "loyal
opposition" of the past has
joined the NLF. In summer
1966, the Buddhists of Hue were
put down by the forces of the
Ky regime.
Now, apparently, these insur
gent forces are fighting with the
NLF. Yet the American mass
media continues to call the
Armed Forces of the National
Liberation Front the "Viet
Cong," or communists.
Another misconception of the
NLF is that it is composed
merely of armies. This is false,
for the NLF has a large bureau
cracy governing much of South
Vietnam, including, they claim,
some areas militarily controlled
by the U.S. The outbreak of
fighting in Saigon is not so much
of a surprise for those who read
the literature of the NLF or
North Vietnam. The NLF has
been governing in many ways,
two districts of Saigon for over
a year.

cal force.
The first is traditional. They
have been our enemy for years.
They are shooting our friends
and brothers—indeed, the chief
justification for the war for the
past three years is the belief
that we can't get out.
False Information
The other reason that Ameri
cans condemn the NLF if be
cause the information we re
ceive about the "enemy" is both
false and incomplete. The Na
tional Liberation Front has al
ways claimed to be exactly what
its name implies, a coalition of
nationalist groups.
While admittedly Communists
of one persuasion or another

have always played an impor
tant role—possibly because all
overt foreign support the NLF
receives is from the Socialist
world—the NLF from the start
has always been made up of
various political, labor, and re
ligious organizations.
Now, as the pressure of war
continually polarizes a political
polarization, most of the "loyal
opposition" of the past has
joined the NLF. In summer
1966, the Buddhists of Hue were
put down by the forces of the
Ky regime.
Now, apparently, these insur
gent forces are fighting with the
NLF. Yet the American mass
media continues to call the
Armed Forces of the National
Liberation Front the "Viet
Cong," or communists.
Another misconception of the
NLF is that it is composed
merely of armies. This is false,
for the NLF has a large bureau
cracy governing much of South
Vietnam, including, they claim,
some areas militarily controlled
by the U.S. The outbreak of
fighting in Saigon is not so much
of a surprise for those who read
the literature of the NLF or
North Vietnam. The NLF has
been governing in many ways,
two districts of Saigon for over
a year.
The popularity of the Nation
al Liberation Front of South
Vietnam has always perplexed
the American government. The
overwhelming strength recently
demonstrated by the NLF in
South Vietnam's major cities
poses a difficult problem for
those men who are entrusted
with what is absurdly known as
the "Other War."
The purpose of the Other War
riors is to convince the people
of South Vietnam that the
Americans and the American
supported Saigon regime have
the best interests of the people
at heart. Clearly, for some
strange reason, they have failed.
The major battle front of the
Other War has been the pacifi
cation program. The original
impetus of this program was
the fact that the NLF had been
serving Vietnamese peasants
since its formation in 1960.
Our program to convince the
Vietnamese that we wanted to
help them was to mimic a pro
gram of the enemy. Of course,
we often had to herd these peo
ple into refugee camps because
the War (as opposed to the Oth
er War) necessitated our bomb
ing their villages. And we had
to protect them behind barbed
wire from their brothers and
sisters.
Land Reform
A month or so ago a few con
gressmen pointed out to the
American public that the NLF
had an effective land reform
program, whereas the Saigon
government did not. Objectively,

this seems to be a reason for
supporting the guerillas. But no,
the congressmen were interested
in making sure that Saigon dis
tributed land so the people
would know that Saigon cared,
and in exposing the fact that
NLF land reform was Commu
nist, not genuine.
It's strange to hear such pro
ponents of the Other War. They
make no pretense to actually
caring whether the Vietnamese
get land. Their goal is merely
to win them over.
There are two major reasons
why most Americans do not con
sider the NLF a sincere politi
cal force.
The first is traditional. They
have been our enemy for years.
They are shooting our friends
and brothers—indeed, the chief
justification for the war for the
