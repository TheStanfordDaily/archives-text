# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Why The Viet Cong Failed 
### Art Buchwald 
One of the many discussions
still raging in the nation's capi
tal is whether the Viet Cong
did or, did not get into the Amer
ican Embassy in Saigon. The
official government position is
that they did not.
One of our public servants
told me, "You newspaper peo
ple went overboard on the story.
The truth is that although the
Viet Cong penetrated the em
bassy grounds, they never did
get into the chancery. Since they
did not achieve their objective,
we consider this one of the worst
defeats the Communists have
ever suffered in the downtown
district of Saigon."
"That may be true," I said,
"but there are some people who
feel that penetration of the em
bassy grounds by the Viet Cong
gave the American effort in
Vietnam a black eye."
"Balderdash," my friend said.
"The question was never in
doubt. Even if the Viet Cong
had captured the embassy, we
weren't worried.
"Of course not. Everyone
knows the Viet Cong don't know
how to operate an American Em
bassy."
I guess I must have looked
stunned.
He continued: "Let us sup
pose the worst happened and
the Viet Cong did get into the
embassy. Do you think they
have any notion of how to issue
visas or passpor.ts or handle
the fantastic amount of paper
work that an embassy of this size
requires?"
"Well, they aren't trained for
it," I had to admit.
"Of course they're not. Our
intelligence showed that not one
of the 19 Viet Cong who invaded
the embassy grounds had any
foreign service experience at all."
"Then why would the Viet
Cong try to take over the Amer
ican Embassy?"
"Because they're smug, and
it's this smugness that's going
to defeat them in the long run.
They think they can just walk
into one of our embassies and
have it running smoothly in six
hours."
"Well, they found out they
couldn't. It wasn't just a case
of not knowing how to issue
passports. Do you know not one _
of those guerrillas was capable
of writing a report to Washing-

ton that anyone could have un
derstood?"
"I forgot about writing re
ports to Washington."
"It's obvious they did, too, or
they would have sent a much
higher caliber man. Any idiot
knows that one of the most im
portant functions of an Ameri
can Embassy is to cable back
clear, precise, reliable reports on
the conditions of then n
"In the case of Vietnam, they
would have had to supply re
ports on the pacification pro
gram, the military assistance
program, the AID program, as
well as transmit daily body
counts to the White House. How
they ever expected to do these

reports with only 19 men, I'll
never know."
"Maybe they were going to
bring in more people after they
captured the embassy," I sug
gested.
"It isn't just a question of
paperwork and reports," my
friend continued. "An American
Embassy has to keep up rela
tions with the government as
well as other embassies. Do you
think anybody in a prominent
position in Saigon would come
to an American Embassy recep
tion if he knew it was being ca
tered by the Viet Cong?"
"Socially, they'd be cut dead,"
I agreed.
"It wouldn't have taken more
than a week before the Viet

Cong realized the disastrous
mistake they had made," my
source said. "Bogged down in
paperwork, besieged by requests
from Washington for optimistic
reports on how the war was go
ing, faced with the prospect of
dealing with President Thieu
and Marshal Ky, it would have
just been a matter of time be
fore the Communists came to
us on their hands and knees and
begged us to take back the
American Embassy."
"Would you?"
"Only if they indicated by
some sign or action that they
really wanted peace in South
Vietnam."

I agreed.

One of the many discussions
still raging in the nation's capi
tal is whether the Viet Cong
did or, did not get into the Amer
ican Embassy in Saigon. The
official government position is
that they did not.
One of our public servants
told me, "You newspaper peo
ple went overboard on the story.
The truth is that although the
Viet Cong penetrated the em
bassy grounds, they never did
get into the chancery. Since they
did not achieve their objective,
we consider this one of the worst
defeats the Communists have
ever suffered in the downtown
district of Saigon."
"That may be true," I said,
"but there are some people who
feel that penetration of the em
bassy grounds by the Viet Cong
gave the American effort in
Vietnam a black eye."
"Balderdash," my friend said.
"The question was never in
doubt. Even if the Viet Cong
had captured the embassy, we
weren't worried.
"Of course not. Everyone
knows the Viet Cong don't know
how to operate an American Em
bassy."
I guess I must have looked
stunned.
He continued: "Let us sup
pose the worst happened and
the Viet Cong did get into the
embassy. Do you think they
have any notion of how to issue
visas or passpor.ts or handle
the fantastic amount of paper
work that an embassy of this size
requires?"
"Well, they aren't trained for
it," I had to admit.
"Of course they're not. Our
intelligence showed that not one
of the 19 Viet Cong who invaded
the embassy grounds had any
foreign service experience at all."
"Then why would the Viet
Cong try to take over the Amer
ican Embassy?"
"Because they're smug, and
it's this smugness that's going
to defeat them in the long run.
They think they can just walk
into one of our embassies and
have it running smoothly in six
hours."
"Well, they found out they
couldn't. It wasn't just a case
of not knowing how to issue
passports. Do you know not one _
of those guerrillas was capable
of writing a report to Washing-

ton that anyone could have un
derstood?"
"I forgot about writing re
ports to Washington."
"It's obvious they did, too, or
they would have sent a much
higher caliber man. Any idiot
knows that one of the most im
portant functions of an Ameri
can Embassy is to cable back
clear, precise, reliable reports on
the conditions of then n
"In the case of Vietnam, they
would have had to supply re
ports on the pacification pro
gram, the military assistance
program, the AID program, as
well as transmit daily body
counts to the White House. How
they ever expected to do these

reports with only 19 men, I'll
never know."
"Maybe they were going to
bring in more people after they
captured the embassy," I sug
gested.
"It isn't just a question of
paperwork and reports," my
friend continued. "An American
Embassy has to keep up rela
tions with the government as
