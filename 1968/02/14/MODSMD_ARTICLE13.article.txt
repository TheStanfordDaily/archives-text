## The 						People Couldn't Believe 
### Art Hoppe 
Once upon a time, a long, long
time ago, there was a wonder
ful land called Wonderfuland. It
was ruled by a mighty king
named King Mighty, who had
all that a king could ask for.
He had all the power a king
might need and all the wealth
a king might need and he was
the most popular king Wonder
fuland ever had.
This last made him happiest
of all, for he dearly wanted to
be loved.
"The only thing I really care
about," he said humbly, "is that
my people believe in me."
And, as this was the truth,
they did.
* » •
Unfortunately, however, when
King Mighty became king Won
derfuland was engaged in a
gritty little war in another coun
try far, far away.
"Frankly, Sire," said his ad
visers, "it seems we can't win
it, we can't lose it, we can't af
ford it, and we can't end it.
Maybe you'd better tell the peo
ple that it looks like a long one."
"What!" cried the king. "Why,
if I told my people I was lead
ing them into a long, grueling,
gritty, meaningless war, they
wouldn't believe in me any

more."
So he told them, instead, that
it was going to be a short,
happy, meaningful little war.
"Victory," he said, "is just
around the corner." The people
all cried, "Huzzah!" and sailed
their caps up in the air.
"See?" said the king proudly.
"I was right. Because I said
this, they still believe in me."
The years passed. The war
dragged on. The king worried
that his people might stop be
lieving in him. So he said the
magic phrase again: "Victory
is just around the corner," he
said.
This time, the people said,
"Huzzah." And 62.8 per cent
threw their caps in the air.
So he said it again. This time,
the people said, "Hmmm." And
32.4 per cent lifted their caps
languidly. So he said it again
and again and again—with sim
ilar results.
Desperate to have his people
believe in him once more, he
made up glowing reports from
the warfront—just as the en
emy captured 26 cities and
towns. "This is a great victory
for our side," he said desperate
ly, "believe you me."
And this time nobody did.

In fact, nobody believed any
thing he said any more. They
didn't believe anything he said
about spies or ships or budgets
or appointments or any single,
solitary thing at all.
A miasma of doubt and dis
trust and confusion and sus
picion had settled over Wonder
fuland and it wasn't even such
a wonderful land any more.
No one was sadder than the
king. "I can't understand it,"
he said sadly. "Everything I
have done, I have done so that
my people would believe in me.
Oh, I would give up my entire
kingdom if only I could some
how make them believe me
just once more."
Happily, a Good Fairy, over
hearing this, took pity on him
and granted his wish. "This is
what you must do ..said the
Good Fairy, whispering into his
ear.
So the king went out on the
palace balcony, bowed his head
and told his people: "I tell lies."
And would you believe it?—
this time every single, solitary
person in the land believed him.

is just around the corner," he
said.
This time, the people said,
"Huzzah." And 62.8 per cent
threw their caps in the air.
So he said it again. This time,
the people said, "Hmmm." And
32.4 per cent lifted their caps
languidly. So he said it again
and again and again—with sim
ilar results.
Desperate to have his people
believe in him once more, he
made up glowing reports from
the warfront—just as the en
emy captured 26 cities and
towns. "This is a great victory
for our side," he said desperate
ly, "believe you me."
And this time nobody did.

In fact, nobody believed any
thing he said any more. They
didn't believe anything he said
about spies or ships or budgets
or appointments or any single,
solitary thing at all.
A miasma of doubt and dis
trust and confusion and sus
picion had settled over Wonder
fuland and it wasn't even such
a wonderful land any more.
No one was sadder than the
king. "I can't understand it,"
he said sadly. "Everything I
have done, I have done so that
my people would believe in me.
Oh, I would give up my entire
kingdom if only I could some
how make them believe me
just once more."
Happily, a Good Fairy, over
hearing this, took pity on him
and granted his wish. "This is
what you must do ..said the
Good Fairy, whispering into his
ear.
So the king went out on the
palace balcony, bowed his head
and told his people: "I tell lies."
And would you believe it?—
this time every single, solitary
person in the land believed him.

Once upon a time, a long, long
time ago, there was a wonder
ful land called Wonderfuland. It
was ruled by a mighty king
named King Mighty, who had
all that a king could ask for.
He had all the power a king
might need and all the wealth
a king might need and he was
the most popular king Wonder
fuland ever had.
This last made him happiest
of all, for he dearly wanted to
be loved.
"The only thing I really care
about," he said humbly, "is that
my people believe in me."
And, as this was the truth,
they did.
* » •
Unfortunately, however, when
King Mighty became king Won
derfuland was engaged in a
gritty little war in another coun
try far, far away.
"Frankly, Sire," said his ad
visers, "it seems we can't win
it, we can't lose it, we can't af
ford it, and we can't end it.
Maybe you'd better tell the peo
ple that it looks like a long one."
"What!" cried the king. "Why,
if I told my people I was lead
ing them into a long, grueling,
gritty, meaningless war, they
wouldn't believe in me any

more."
So he told them, instead, that
it was going to be a short,
happy, meaningful little war.
"Victory," he said, "is just
around the corner." The people
all cried, "Huzzah!" and sailed
their caps up in the air.
"See?" said the king proudly.
"I was right. Because I said
this, they still believe in me."
The years passed. The war
dragged on. The king worried
that his people might stop be
lieving in him. So he said the
magic phrase again: "Victory
is just around the corner," he
said.
This time, the people said,
"Huzzah." And 62.8 per cent
threw their caps in the air.
So he said it again. This time,
