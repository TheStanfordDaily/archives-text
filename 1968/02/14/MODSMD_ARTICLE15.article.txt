# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Park Urges Resolute US Retaliation 
### Drew Pearson 
(Note: The following Inter
view with the President of South
Korea was held by Pearson's
associate Jack Anderson.)
South Korea's President
Chung Hee Park, who has been
smoldering in silence over the
attempt on his life by a North
Korean assassination squad last
month, today called for "pru
dent retaliation."
In an exclusive interview with
this column, he said the U.S.
government has asked him not
to retalliate and he had agreed
"to wait and watch." But he
indicated that he was a little
weary of waiting.
He called the attempt on his
life and the seizure of the Pueb
lo "clear acts of aggression."
"Every time we have been
stjjuck by North Korea," he
said, "we have done nothing. So
what good is it to have forces
to check aggression? There is
little significance to the pres
ence of U.N. troops in Korea if
no action is taken."
U.S. Responsible
He charged that the U.S. pol
icy of turning the other cheek
was responsible for North Ko
rea's boldness.
Speaking through an interpre
ter, President Park declared:
"During the 15 years since the
armistice, the agreement has
been completely disregarded by
the North Korean communists.
There have been frequent viola
tions. Casualities have been in
flicted; sabotage has been com
mitted; agents have been infil
trated into the Republic of Ko
rea.
"As long as we have an ar
mistice agreement, both sides
should abide by it. We have faith
fully observed the agreement,
but they have violated it a num
ber of times. No retaliatory ac
tion has been exercised. This
has made it possible for them
to attack the presidential man
sion and to seize the Pueblo.
"If Kim II Sung (the North
Korean dictator) had realized
that he would suffer retaliatory
action, he would scarcely have
attempted these unspeakable
acts."
Counter Measures
President Park believes it is
still not too late to retaliate

against North Korea for these
latest "outrages." If the com
munists don't make the proper
amends at Panmunjom, he urg
ed: "We should be ready to take
prudent counter measures.
"Firm determination and reso
lute action," he said, "would not
escalate the crisis but would dis
courage dangerous incidents in
the future."
The tough, little South Korean
leader, spoke softly, but he slash
ed the air with a white-tipped, sil
ver pointer to emphasize his
meaning. As he groped for the
right words, he would lean back
in his brown leather chair an
wiggle his foot against a heavy,
mahogany coffee table.
He insisted that appropriate
action could be taken against
North Korea, as punishment for
the assassination attempt and
ship seizure, "without inducing
an outbreak of the war."
Limited Retaliation
Hie suggested the U.S. an
nounce that the action was pure
ly retaliatory and would be
limited.
"If we make this clear," he
predicted, "the North Korean
communists will not renew the
war. This is self-defense in na
ture.
"But if we don't take any ac
tion at this time," he warned,
"the communists will feel free
to continue their inhuman and
brutal provocations."
President Park chain-smoked
as he talked, pausing during the
translations to light up. He
smokes only Korean cigarettes
and forbids government em
ployees to smoke anything else,
in order to build up the Korean
economy.
For the present, he said he
would abide by the U.S. request
not to retaliate.
U.N. Actions
'The defense of the Republic
of Korea," he said, "is the re
sponsibility of the U.N. com
mander. Our forces are under
his operational control. I have
pledged that I would respect and
honor his authority.
"But," he added, "I am watch-

Ing very closely the actions that
the U.N. commander may or
may not take in these cases."
South Korean officials are
seething over the bold attempted
commando raid on the Blue
House, their country's counter
part of the White House. They
are also dismayed over the
seeming unconcern in the U.S.
about the incident. In contrast
to the outcry over the Pueblo's

seizure, they feel that Ameri
cans have shown little indigna
tion over the attempt on Presi
dent Park's life.
The South Koreans were so
outraged that U.S. Ambassador
William Porter hurried over to
the Blue House with an urgent
request that no retaliation be at
tempted.
Kim complained that Presi
dent Johnson had requested

50,000 South Korean troops to
kill communists in Vietnam but
had intervened to keep the
South Koreans from killing com
munists in their own country.
If President Johnson is re
garded by some as a hawk in
Vietnam, the South Koreans
definitely consider him to be a
dove in Korea.

There have been frequent viola

flicted; sabotage has been com
mitted; agents have been infil
trated into the Republic of Ko

"As long as we have an ar

to attack the presidential man
sion and to seize the Pueblo.
"If Kim II Sung (the North
Korean dictator) had realized
that he would suffer retaliatory
action, he would scarcely have
attempted these unspeakable

Counter Measures
President Park believes it is
still not too late to retaliate

against North Korea for these
latest "outrages." If the com
munists don't make the proper
amends at Panmunjom, he urg
ed: "We should be ready to take
prudent counter measures.
"Firm determination and reso
lute action," he said, "would not
escalate the crisis but would dis
courage dangerous incidents in
the future."
The tough, little South Korean
leader, spoke softly, but he slash
ed the air with a white-tipped, sil
ver pointer to emphasize his
meaning. As he groped for the
right words, he would lean back
in his brown leather chair an
wiggle his foot against a heavy,
mahogany coffee table.
He insisted that appropriate
action could be taken against
North Korea, as punishment for
the assassination attempt and
ship seizure, "without inducing
an outbreak of the war."
Limited Retaliation
Hie suggested the U.S. an
nounce that the action was pure
ly retaliatory and would be
limited.
"If we make this clear," he
predicted, "the North Korean
communists will not renew the
war. This is self-defense in na
ture.
"But if we don't take any ac
tion at this time," he warned,
"the communists will feel free
to continue their inhuman and
brutal provocations."
President Park chain-smoked
as he talked, pausing during the
translations to light up. He
smokes only Korean cigarettes
and forbids government em
ployees to smoke anything else,
in order to build up the Korean
economy.
For the present, he said he
would abide by the U.S. request
not to retaliate.
U.N. Actions
'The defense of the Republic
of Korea," he said, "is the re
sponsibility of the U.N. com
mander. Our forces are under
his operational control. I have
pledged that I would respect and
honor his authority.
"But," he added, "I am watch-

Ing very closely the actions that
the U.N. commander may or
may not take in these cases."
South Korean officials are
seething over the bold attempted
commando raid on the Blue
House, their country's counter
part of the White House. They
are also dismayed over the
seeming unconcern in the U.S.
about the incident. In contrast
to the outcry over the Pueblo's

seizure, they feel that Ameri
cans have shown little indigna
tion over the attempt on Presi
dent Park's life.
The South Koreans were so
outraged that U.S. Ambassador
William Porter hurried over to
the Blue House with an urgent
request that no retaliation be at
tempted.
Kim complained that Presi
dent Johnson had requested

50,000 South Korean troops to
kill communists in Vietnam but
had intervened to keep the
South Koreans from killing com
munists in their own country.
If President Johnson is re
garded by some as a hawk in
Vietnam, the South Koreans
definitely consider him to be a
dove in Korea.

South Korea's President
Chung Hee Park, who has been
smoldering in silence over the
attempt on his life by a North
Korean assassination squad last
month, today called for "pru
dent retaliation."
In an exclusive interview with
this column, he said the U.S.
government has asked him not
to retalliate and he had agreed
"to wait and watch." But he
indicated that he was a little
weary of waiting.
He called the attempt on his
life and the seizure of the Pueb
lo "clear acts of aggression."
"Every time we have been
stjjuck by North Korea," he
said, "we have done nothing. So
what good is it to have forces
to check aggression? There is
little significance to the pres
ence of U.N. troops in Korea if
no action is taken."
U.S. Responsible
He charged that the U.S. pol
icy of turning the other cheek
was responsible for North Ko
rea's boldness.
Speaking through an interpre
ter, President Park declared:

wiggle his foot against a heavy,
mahogany coffee table.
He insisted that appropriate
action could be taken against
North Korea, as punishment for
the assassination attempt and
ship seizure, "without inducing
an outbreak of the war."
Limited Retaliation
Hie suggested the U.S. an
nounce that the action was pure
ly retaliatory and would be
limited.
"If we make this clear," he
predicted, "the North Korean
communists will not renew the
war. This is self-defense in na
ture.
"But if we don't take any ac
tion at this time," he warned,
"the communists will feel free
to continue their inhuman and
brutal provocations."
President Park chain-smoked
as he talked, pausing during the
translations to light up. He
smokes only Korean cigarettes
and forbids government em
ployees to smoke anything else,
in order to build up the Korean
economy.
For the present, he said he
would abide by the U.S. request
not to retaliate.
U.N. Actions
'The defense of the Republic
of Korea," he said, "is the re
sponsibility of the U.N. com
mander. Our forces are under
his operational control. I have
pledged that I would respect and
honor his authority.
"But," he added, "I am watch-

Ing very closely the actions that
the U.N. commander may or
may not take in these cases."
South Korean officials are
seething over the bold attempted
commando raid on the Blue
House, their country's counter
part of the White House. They
are also dismayed over the
seeming unconcern in the U.S.
about the incident. In contrast
to the outcry over the Pueblo's

seizure, they feel that Ameri
cans have shown little indigna
tion over the attempt on Presi
dent Park's life.
The South Koreans were so
outraged that U.S. Ambassador
William Porter hurried over to
the Blue House with an urgent
request that no retaliation be at
tempted.
Kim complained that Presi
dent Johnson had requested

50,000 South Korean troops to
kill communists in Vietnam but
had intervened to keep the
South Koreans from killing com
munists in their own country.
If President Johnson is re
garded by some as a hawk in
Vietnam, the South Koreans
definitely consider him to be a
dove in Korea.

view with the President of South
Korea was held by Pearson's
associate Jack Anderson.)
South Korea's President
Chung Hee Park, who has been
smoldering in silence over the
attempt on his life by a North
Korean assassination squad last
month, today called for "pru
dent retaliation."
In an exclusive interview with
this column, he said the U.S.
government has asked him not
to retalliate and he had agreed
"to wait and watch." But he
indicated that he was a little
weary of waiting.
He called the attempt on his
life and the seizure of the Pueb
lo "clear acts of aggression."
"Every time we have been
stjjuck by North Korea," he
said, "we have done nothing. So
what good is it to have forces
to check aggression? There is
little significance to the pres
ence of U.N. troops in Korea if
no action is taken."
U.S. Responsible
He charged that the U.S. pol
icy of turning the other cheek
was responsible for North Ko
rea's boldness.
Speaking through an interpre
ter, President Park declared:
"During the 15 years since the
armistice, the agreement has
been completely disregarded by
the North Korean communists.
There have been frequent viola
tions. Casualities have been in
flicted; sabotage has been com
mitted; agents have been infil
trated into the Republic of Ko
rea.
"As long as we have an ar
mistice agreement, both sides
should abide by it. We have faith
fully observed the agreement,
but they have violated it a num
ber of times. No retaliatory ac
tion has been exercised. This
has made it possible for them
to attack the presidential man
sion and to seize the Pueblo.
"If Kim II Sung (the North
Korean dictator) had realized
that he would suffer retaliatory
action, he would scarcely have
attempted these unspeakable
acts."
Counter Measures
President Park believes it is
still not too late to retaliate

against North Korea for these
latest "outrages." If the com
munists don't make the proper
amends at Panmunjom, he urg
ed: "We should be ready to take
prudent counter measures.
"Firm determination and reso
lute action," he said, "would not
escalate the crisis but would dis
courage dangerous incidents in
the future."
The tough, little South Korean
leader, spoke softly, but he slash
ed the air with a white-tipped, sil
ver pointer to emphasize his
meaning. As he groped for the
right words, he would lean back
in his brown leather chair an
wiggle his foot against a heavy,
mahogany coffee table.
He insisted that appropriate
action could be taken against
