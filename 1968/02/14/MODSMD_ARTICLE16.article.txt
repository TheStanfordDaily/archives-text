# Death And Faith
## 
### Max Lerner 
If you argue (as I have done)
that fighting the Vietnamese
war as a war for the mind in
volves the need to develop a
fighting faith, then the question
is: how is it to be done?
Certainly the Viet Cong be
have as if they had a fighting
faith: how else explain the
mounds of dead bodies piled up
in the streets of Saigon, Cholon,
Hue, the desperate attack on the
American Embassy, the suicidal
waves of infiltrators turned ter
rorists?
This doesn't mean that the
Communist regime in Hanoi is
freer or better than the Saigon
regime, as some senators argue,
but only that it uses nationalist
pride and the image of the en
emy more shrewdly and has
managed to turn a dictatorship's
war into a Holy War.
Common Element
The common element in these
cases is not freedom or social
reform, important as both of
them have been in authentic
freedom wars, from the Ameri
can Minutemen to the Haganah.
The common element is the in
teraction between weapons and
ideas, between military and po
litical warfare.
The Thieu-Ky regime has not
learned this, nor has the Lyn
don Johnson regime. The re
gime of Ho Chi Minh and Gen.
Vo Nguyen Giap has.
There is just a chance that
the Viet Cong may have over

reached themselves by the scale
and ferocity of their attacks. If
your life is made dangerous
enough by terrorism, you may
fight back simply because, as a
civilian, you might as well die
with a gun in your hand as die
without one.
But this means distributing
weapons to a "People's Army"
—weapons which may easily
end in the hands of infiltrators.
The effective antiguerrilla wars,
in the Philippines and Malaya,
used selective arming of deter
mined civilians and rewarded
resistance. In Vietnam it may
be too late for such a policy.
Reforms Needed
In theory at least I agree with
Sen, Edward Kennedy who
came back from Vietnam with
a list of demands for reform we
should make of the Saigon re
gime. In practice it is not so
clear, because a government en
gaged in a struggle for sheer
survival against a ruthless and
brilliant enemy is unlikely to
muster the time, energy or
leadership for major reforms.
The basic problem is one of
political resolve and skill by a
leadership group. If a man of
the people could be found in
Vietnam, as the Filipinos found
President Ramon Magsaysay,
who was at once reformer, real
ist and incorruptible, half the
problem of a fighting faith
would be met.
Until then the Vietnamese

themselves will have to under
stand that unless they learn
how to develop their own fight
ing faith, little that America
can do will be a substitute for
it. If they fail entirely, America
may well have to withdraw.
The Answers
One answer being advanced is
to cut through the whole prob
lem of a fighting faith and to
say that for Americans in this
war it is unachievable, since no
military victory is possible.
Its logical corollary should
also be noted. It is to seek from
Hanoi and the Viet Cong the
best terms they will offer, using
military power only to keep
the terms from being too harsh
and the take-over too abrupt.
On this level of reasoning,
the best fighting faith is one
that forswears wars of any kind
abroad and focuses on the so
cial struggle at home.
I doubt whether this will meet
the mood of most Americans.
War-weary as they are, they may
tend to draw together at home
as the danger increases on the
battlefields.
America does not have and
will not develop a fighting faith
for the Vietnamese war. But it
has shown the animal faith of
sheer, survival.
I hope America will in time
add a faith in the goals and
means that give survival mean
ing.

If you argue (as I have done)
that fighting the Vietnamese
war as a war for the mind in
volves the need to develop a
fighting faith, then the question
is: how is it to be done?
Certainly the Viet Cong be
have as if they had a fighting
faith: how else explain the
mounds of dead bodies piled up
in the streets of Saigon, Cholon,
Hue, the desperate attack on the
American Embassy, the suicidal
waves of infiltrators turned ter
rorists?
This doesn't mean that the
Communist regime in Hanoi is
freer or better than the Saigon
regime, as some senators argue,
but only that it uses nationalist
pride and the image of the en
emy more shrewdly and has
managed to turn a dictatorship's
war into a Holy War.
Common Element
The common element in these
cases is not freedom or social
reform, important as both of
them have been in authentic
freedom wars, from the Ameri
can Minutemen to the Haganah.
The common element is the in
teraction between weapons and
ideas, between military and po
litical warfare.
The Thieu-Ky regime has not
learned this, nor has the Lyn
don Johnson regime. The re
gime of Ho Chi Minh and Gen.
Vo Nguyen Giap has.
There is just a chance that
the Viet Cong may have over

reached themselves by the scale
and ferocity of their attacks. If
your life is made dangerous
enough by terrorism, you may
fight back simply because, as a
civilian, you might as well die
with a gun in your hand as die
without one.
But this means distributing
weapons to a "People's Army"
—weapons which may easily
end in the hands of infiltrators.
The effective antiguerrilla wars,
in the Philippines and Malaya,
used selective arming of deter
mined civilians and rewarded
resistance. In Vietnam it may
be too late for such a policy.
Reforms Needed
In theory at least I agree with
Sen, Edward Kennedy who
came back from Vietnam with
a list of demands for reform we
should make of the Saigon re
gime. In practice it is not so
clear, because a government en
gaged in a struggle for sheer
survival against a ruthless and
brilliant enemy is unlikely to
muster the time, energy or
leadership for major reforms.
The basic problem is one of
political resolve and skill by a
leadership group. If a man of
the people could be found in
Vietnam, as the Filipinos found
President Ramon Magsaysay,
who was at once reformer, real
ist and incorruptible, half the
problem of a fighting faith
would be met.
Until then the Vietnamese

themselves will have to under
stand that unless they learn
how to develop their own fight
ing faith, little that America
can do will be a substitute for
it. If they fail entirely, America
may well have to withdraw.
The Answers
One answer being advanced is
to cut through the whole prob
lem of a fighting faith and to
say that for Americans in this
war it is unachievable, since no
military victory is possible.
Its logical corollary should
also be noted. It is to seek from
Hanoi and the Viet Cong the
best terms they will offer, using
military power only to keep
the terms from being too harsh
and the take-over too abrupt.
On this level of reasoning,
the best fighting faith is one
that forswears wars of any kind
abroad and focuses on the so
cial struggle at home.
I doubt whether this will meet
the mood of most Americans.
War-weary as they are, they may
tend to draw together at home
as the danger increases on the
battlefields.
America does not have and
will not develop a fighting faith
for the Vietnamese war. But it
has shown the animal faith of
sheer, survival.
I hope America will in time
add a faith in the goals and
means that give survival mean
ing.
