# Faculty Panel
## General Studies Debated 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Qualified criticisms and sup
port of the general studies pro
gram came from a faculty panel
in Cedro lounge last night.
Professors F. W. Strothmann,
Patrick Suppes, Walter Meyer
hof, Edwin Good, Charles Drek
meier, Leo Weinstein, instructor
Bruce Merry, graduate student
Mike Menke, and moderator
Dean Robert Funk served as
panel members.
Meyerhof began the discus
sion by stating, "If the gen
eral studies program is to pro
vide certain guidelines or a

general cultural background,
then I think the Idea is a good
one. Of course, then one can
argue about the guidelines."
The guidelines of the program
were the major topic of dis
cussion during the evening.
Merry noted, "My criticism is
with the technique.
"My feeling is that a lot of
general studies classes could be
printed up as digests to be read.
Then general studies classes
wouldn't have to be attended."
Strothmann discussed the dis
crepancy between the committee
on general studies' intentions

and the actual results of those
intentions. He said that certain
courses in the program had
been intended for non-majors,
but the faculty did not like to
teach such courses. Menke sec
onded this point.
Suppes agreed with Merry's
comment that students should
be allowed to take exams in gen
eral studies without requiring
attendance to lectures.
He added, don't know
what's really wrong with the
general studies program. It's
difficult to get evidence re
garding the program In the
form In which we can assess
It"
Weinstein listed several rea
sons he considered behind the
general studies program. He
stated that high schools haven't
prepared students; that the pro
gram could provide the student
with certain basic tools; finally,
that there is no substitute for
experience.
Drekmeier touched on the role
of education in society today
wh?n he said, "In this country
education is more an l more a
vehicle for social mobility.
"A general studies program is
a necessity to save us from over
powering specialization."
After the panel members had
concluded their individual esti
mates of the program, students
in the audience made several
critical comments of the panel's
observations.
One student emphasized the
short-comings of the Biology
4 and 5 series. He said that a

more general outline of the
field of biology would be more
beneficial to the student than
the highly technical form of
the course as it now stood.
The student sighted Darwin's
Voyage of the Beagle as possible
reading for a more generalized
approach to biology.
The majority of students'
questions centered around fail
ings of the general studies pro
gram. The technicality and rigid
ity of the program were men
tioned repeatedly by students in
the audience.
Edwin Good replied that he
thought students liked to have
their courses "sugar-coated" and
that they did not like to apply
themselves to a course as rigor
ous as biology.
He did admit that he thought
faculties were lazy, too, in that
they allowed the green sheet to
do the advising of students that
the faculty should be doing.
