# Varied Jobs
## Working Through Stanford 
### LETA ZUCKERMAN 
Ingenuity has become the key
word in job-hunting at Stanford.
The common jobs are snatched
immediately. For the rest, stu
dents are left to use their im
agination to find opportunities,
everything from cat-sitters to
Swahili tutors.
One of the major sources for
ideas is the Student Employ
ment Service. It has offered
such diverse possibilities as in
come tax checking, and guinea
pig feeding, which pays, by the
way, two dollars an hour.
The Service generally places
five to seven bartenders a
week and has even had an
opening for a singing guitar
ist, who was so appreciated
that he has now been hired on
a permanent basis. He makes
$15-$2O an evening plus a
steak dinner. Cat and dog sit
ters, and even phone sitters
are always wanted and if you
speak fluent Singalese there
have also been tutoring re
quests here.
Some enterprising students
have set off on their own: into
the laundry business for in
stance. Mark Fogelman, who
runs the laundry in Stern, is a
good example.
He works for Austen's Fre
mont Laundry, taking in the
items from the Stern men,
bundling them up and sending
them off to the company for
cleaning. He gets the clientele,
the company does the job, and

he is paid a commission from
the profits.
Another such businessman is
Terry Murphy. He and his part
ner, Bill Stone, put out the Stan
ford desk blotter, which is dis
tributed free of charge to the
students.
Appointed for one year by the
ASSU Publications Board, their
job is to convince local mer
chants to advertise on the blot
ter. From the profits obtained
in this way two-thirds goes to
the Board and the other third is
split between the partners. An
enterprising team can make as
much as $600 for each partner
over the year!
Henry Muller has one of the
most interesting jobs around.
He is a stringer for TIME
magazine. He is, In effect, an
information gatherer. The edi
tors send him the basic ideas
for a new story and Henry's
job is to investigate all Its
angles at Stanford.
For example, the magazifte
ran a large story on computer
education. Their stringers in
universities throughout the
country compiled all the infor
mation available at their schools
and submitted about 2000 words
each.
From these papers a new
story was compiled. Perhaps out
of the 2000 words Henry sub
mitted, only ten sentences ap
peared in the final product.
Henry is also asked to re
search opinions. He is given the
subject of a planned editorial

and he surveys different stand
points.
The opinions he gathers will
not appear in the editorial as
the opinions of members of the
Stanford community, but they
may, and probably will, influ
ence the content of the editorial
produced. In a job like this,
Henry's hours may vary from
none in one week to twenty in
the next.
Many Stanford students
work directly for the Univers
ity. About 60, for example,
are in the guide service. Half
of these are given the Job
by the University as a scholar
ship and are paid by the Fed
eral government; the other
half are regular guides paid
by the University.
Their jobs are varied: There
are guides stationed at Hoover
Tower, at the information booth
at the front of Quad, at the of
fice for foreign visitors in the
International Center, at the
Church, and at the Museum.
They run one campus tour per
day, and (in principle), they
clear the kiosks.
Sixteen Stanford men work on
the Toyon switchboard. They
are paid anywhere from $1.65
to $2.20 an hour, depending on
their experience. According to
Larry Nicholas, chief operator,
the board is old and therefore
often has mechanical problems,
making such experience neces
sary.

day, and (in principle), they
clear the kiosks.
Sixteen Stanford men work on
the Toyon switchboard. They
are paid anywhere from $1.65
to $2.20 an hour, depending on
their experience. According to
Larry Nicholas, chief operator,
the board is old and therefore
often has mechanical problems,
making such experience neces
sary.
Ingenuity has become the key
word in job-hunting at Stanford.
The common jobs are snatched
immediately. For the rest, stu

everything from cat-sitters to
Swahili tutors.
One of the major sources for
ideas is the Student Employ
ment Service. It has offered
such diverse possibilities as in
come tax checking, and guinea
pig feeding, which pays, by the
way, two dollars an hour.
The Service generally places
five to seven bartenders a
week and has even had an
opening for a singing guitar
ist, who was so appreciated
that he has now been hired on
a permanent basis. He makes
$15-$2O an evening plus a
steak dinner. Cat and dog sit
ters, and even phone sitters
are always wanted and if you
speak fluent Singalese there
have also been tutoring re
quests here.
Some enterprising students
have set off on their own: into
the laundry business for in
stance. Mark Fogelman, who
runs the laundry in Stern, is a
good example.
He works for Austen's Fre
mont Laundry, taking in the
items from the Stern men,
bundling them up and sending
them off to the company for
cleaning. He gets the clientele,
the company does the job, and

he is paid a commission from
the profits.
Another such businessman is
Terry Murphy. He and his part
ner, Bill Stone, put out the Stan
ford desk blotter, which is dis
tributed free of charge to the
students.
Appointed for one year by the
ASSU Publications Board, their
job is to convince local mer
chants to advertise on the blot
ter. From the profits obtained
in this way two-thirds goes to
the Board and the other third is
split between the partners. An
enterprising team can make as
much as $600 for each partner
over the year!
Henry Muller has one of the
most interesting jobs around.
He is a stringer for TIME
magazine. He is, In effect, an
information gatherer. The edi
tors send him the basic ideas
for a new story and Henry's
job is to investigate all Its
angles at Stanford.
For example, the magazifte
ran a large story on computer
education. Their stringers in
universities throughout the
country compiled all the infor
mation available at their schools
and submitted about 2000 words
each.
From these papers a new
story was compiled. Perhaps out
of the 2000 words Henry sub
mitted, only ten sentences ap
peared in the final product.
Henry is also asked to re
search opinions. He is given the
subject of a planned editorial

and he surveys different stand
points.
The opinions he gathers will
not appear in the editorial as
the opinions of members of the
Stanford community, but they
may, and probably will, influ
ence the content of the editorial
produced. In a job like this,
Henry's hours may vary from
none in one week to twenty in
the next.
Many Stanford students
work directly for the Univers
ity. About 60, for example,
are in the guide service. Half
of these are given the Job
by the University as a scholar
ship and are paid by the Fed
eral government; the other
half are regular guides paid
by the University.
Their jobs are varied: There
are guides stationed at Hoover
Tower, at the information booth
at the front of Quad, at the of

International Center, at the
Church, and at the Museum.
