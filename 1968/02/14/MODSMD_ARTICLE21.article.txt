# Hayes: Constitution Reform
## 
### DENIS HAYES 
All my opponents in this cam
paign have portrayed themselves
to the voters as so many won
drous pep pills. They all freely
admit that our present student
government isn't functioning.
"But," they say, "Just inject me
into the old ox and she'll snort
to life."
Anyone with a sense of per
spective realizes this is patent
nonsense. Our last two ASSU
presidents have resigned in frus
tration because they found the
Stanford student political sys
tem to be unworkable; our legi
slature has done virtually noth
ing in the past five months ex
cept bemoan its impotence.

Now, suddenly, are we to be
lieve that a new V.P. will be able
to install a Centrex telephone
system, establish a student co
op, reorient the advisor program,
build a new dormitory, restruc
ture the General Studies require
ments, and guarantee a four
year ceiling on tuition?
This "election formula" has an
enormous appeal to a great
many students, myself among
them. But it has been chanted
so frequently over the past few
years that it has lost much of
its immediacy. I submit that we
ought to cool our ardor for the
moment and switch our atten
tion from ends to m<*ans.
We have only three months

left this year; we can best use
that time to design and con
struct a student organization
capable of doing something. The
natural instrument for this proc
ess would bo the coming Con
stitutional Convention.
A group of us have conducted
a detailed, informal study of the
deffk'ienccs in our present gov
ernmental system. Out of that
study has evolved a tentative
design for a new typ*' of politi
cal system. This is not advanced
as a Utopian end-product. Rather
it is an interim organization, con
ceived to meet student needs and
to focus student energies today
and tomorrow.
Its flexible structure would
be able to naturally evolve to
meet future changes within the
institution.
I have eschewed more sensa
tional issues and confined my
campaign to realistic designs for
Constitutional roform. This has
been partly due to a belief that
as long as we lack a viable form
of government, all other issues
relating to student government
are without meaning.
It has also been due to a de
sire to have an unambiguous stu
dent mandate for my basic con
cepts (the only workable con
cepts which have been suggest
ed) at next term's Constitutional
Convention.
I refuse to promise pie-in-the
sky, a chicken in every pot, or a
telephone for every student. I'm
very aware of the limits of the
vice presidency, and I won't
promise what I can't deliver.
But I do promise, if elected,
to lead the coming Constitution
al Convention to create a viable
form of student government, one
which will be relevant to Stan
ford and to you.
Only then can we begin to
realistically assay our long-range
goals.
