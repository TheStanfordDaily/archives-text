# Askinas: 'Revive Apathetic Students'
## 
### BARRY ASKINAS 
With Vietnam and Korea on
the one hand, and the explosive
situation in our cities on the
other, it is hard to see the rele
vance of student politics. Should
women live off campus? Should
a science course be required?
Should pass-fail grading be ex
tended to the whole freshman
year?
All this fades in comparison
with napalm and starvation and
violence. But students have
seen that all their petitions, all
their demonstrations have been
totally disregarded by the poli
ticians, if not scorned by the gen
eral public.
And finally we have become
apathetic. If nothing we do is
going to have an effect, then
we will do nothing. We have
been living down the reputation
of the "Silent Generation." Are
we to become silent again?
This year I have been living
as a tutor in a freshman dorm.
Freshmen are dissatisfied with
the kind of living conditions im
posed upon them. They wonder
about the relevance of their
course work to their lives. Such
frustrations are common to
most students.
Graduate students have with
drawn into their books and their
departments. They feel it is a
condition for their success. Many
are afraid to join the new union
of graduate students, for, fear
that the administration or their
departments will cut off their fel
lowships.
It will make a difference a
decade from now what SES de
cides about the education proc
ess here and now. What we de
cide about campus living is go
ing to decide in what kind of

environment those who come
after us will spend four or mow
years of their lives.
I expect to make this an issue
oriented campaign. As a gradu
ate representative in LASSU,
it has become clear to me that
students have lost interest and
faith in student government and
politics. LASSU needs to be dras
tically reorganized. Students
need to be shown that the fac
ulty and the administration will
listen to student opinion.
I am running because I want
us to come back into the Stan
ford Community, because it is
four years of our lives now.
These are the main issues:
1. SES to be a permanent com
mittee. Academic reform is a
continuous process, not a "once
every decade or so" affair.
2. A new ASSU constitution,
working toward a community
government of faculty, admini
strators, and students.
3. More Co-ed housing.
4. A student co-op that will
be operated for OUR profit.
5. A referendum on campus
recruiting by the CIA. Do we
actually want them here?
6. An investigation of Univer
sity food services. Small por
tions! High prices! A restau
rant run like that would soon
go out of business.
7. More university involve
ment in the surrounding com
munity. A campus office to co
ordinate and encourage tutorial
projects, work projects, and com
munity development.
8. A guaranteed ceiling on tui
tion for your four years.
9. More University - subsidized
graduate student housing.
10. Student control of the
ASSU office. Who's in charge
here, anyhow???

9. More University - subsidized
graduate student housing.
10. Student control of the
ASSU office. Who's in charge
here, anyhow???
With Vietnam and Korea on
the one hand, and the explosive
situation in our cities on the
other, it is hard to see the rele
vance of student politics. Should
women live off campus? Should
a science course be required?
Should pass-fail grading be ex
tended to the whole freshman
year?
All this fades in comparison
with napalm and starvation and
violence. But students have
seen that all their petitions, all
their demonstrations have been
totally disregarded by the poli
ticians, if not scorned by the gen
eral public.
And finally we have become
apathetic. If nothing we do is
going to have an effect, then
we will do nothing. We have
been living down the reputation
of the "Silent Generation." Are
we to become silent again?
This year I have been living
as a tutor in a freshman dorm.
Freshmen are dissatisfied with
the kind of living conditions im
posed upon them. They wonder
about the relevance of their
course work to their lives. Such
frustrations are common to
most students.
Graduate students have with
drawn into their books and their
departments. They feel it is a
condition for their success. Many
are afraid to join the new union
of graduate students, for, fear
that the administration or their
departments will cut off their fel
lowships.
It will make a difference a
decade from now what SES de
cides about the education proc
ess here and now. What we de
cide about campus living is go
ing to decide in what kind of

environment those who come
after us will spend four or mow
years of their lives.
I expect to make this an issue
oriented campaign. As a gradu
ate representative in LASSU,
it has become clear to me that
students have lost interest and
faith in student government and
politics. LASSU needs to be dras
tically reorganized. Students
need to be shown that the fac
ulty and the administration will
listen to student opinion.
I am running because I want
us to come back into the Stan
ford Community, because it is
four years of our lives now.
These are the main issues:
1. SES to be a permanent com
mittee. Academic reform is a
continuous process, not a "once
every decade or so" affair.
2. A new ASSU constitution,
working toward a community
government of faculty, admini
strators, and students.
3. More Co-ed housing.
4. A student co-op that will
be operated for OUR profit.
5. A referendum on campus
recruiting by the CIA. Do we
actually want them here?
6. An investigation of Univer
sity food services. Small por
tions! High prices! A restau
rant run like that would soon
go out of business.
7. More university involve
ment in the surrounding com
munity. A campus office to co
ordinate and encourage tutorial
projects, work projects, and com
munity development.
8. A guaranteed ceiling on tui
tion for your four years.
