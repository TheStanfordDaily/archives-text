# Weatherup Hits 'Radical Activists'
## 
### ROY WEATHERUP 
All of us agree that student
government Is a farce. I believe
that we should examine the
cause of the farce before pre
senting a cure-all.
The problem is basically this:
the preachers and prophets of
the Far Left have dominated
student politics at Stanford for
two years. They have preached,
but have not worked. The com
plex problems that stare them
in the face after each election
have clouded their visions of a
perfect society and have often
caused them to quit. (Harris,
Lyman, etc.) I am running for
ASSU V.P. in order to provide
an alternative to this nonsense.
The New Left visionaries can
think only in terms of cliches
such as "community govern
ment," "the System," and"the
trade school." Having no con
cept of the role of student gov
ernment, they vaguely promise
to make education "meaning
ful" (who could be against
that?). Thy want a new tele
phone system, abolition of
ROTC, and other changes which
ASSU does not have the ability
to provide.
Countless committees have
been established; few of them
have met and none of them have
reported back to the Legislature.
The activists are too lazy to
work, even on their own pro
jects such as the appointment
of a professor to be sponsored
by ASSU.
There are many things AS
SU could do, such as providing
legal and consumer aid for stu
dents. But the activists have
shown that they are too bored
to explore the complex details
of policy. As ASSU vice presi
dent, I would be willing to sit

on committees, however tedious
the work.
There are several structural
changes in ASSU which would
help prevent domination by ac
tivists who are theorists but not
workers.
1) No one should be allowed
to run for ASSU president or
vice president without having
served a year in LASSU or
some other branch of student
government. This would prevent
flamers such as Dave Harris
from talking their way into
office without any knowledge of
the responsibilities and limita
tions of ASSU.
2) LASSU should be reduced
in size by eliminating some of
the nonrepresentative members
from departments.
3) Attendance rules of LAS
SU should be stricter and more
strictly enforced.
The problem boils down to
this: ASSU is presently domi
nated by a bunch of irrespon
sible, fanatical, unreasoning, un
compromising visionary radical
activitists who have done nothing
except make their presence
known.
If I am elected I will deliver
no grand, inspiring orations. I
will not have the insolence to
claim that I speak for all of the
students of Stanford University,
nor will I address threats to the
Administration if they fail to
bow before the wisdom and
power of ASSU. I will only try
to do a good job fulfilling the
limited resopnsibilities assigned
to ASSU.
