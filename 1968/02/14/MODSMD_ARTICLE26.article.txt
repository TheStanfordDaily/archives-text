# Tammany Seeks Immediate Goals
## 
### SKIP TAMMANY The Platform 
As vice president I intend to
concentrate ori short-term goals.
These include the revision of
section B-2 of General Studies
to allow students more freedom
of choice (already being con
sidered by Academic Council),
revamping the inadequate Ad
visor program, as well as con
tinuing to work on SES Review
Board and the Academic Affairs
Committee.
I'm not running for vice
president just to have a few
changes implemented. I want to
see the establishment of credi
bility for student proposals. This
necessitates long-term objec
tives involving basic institution
al changes.
Obviously, the vice president
cannot effect an immediate
change in University policy re
garding Black Students, the CIA
Demonstrators, Grades, TMU,
Housing, Centrex or the For
eign Campuses.
The vice-president can't afford
to neglect these problems, be
cause education is much more
than academic achievement —
achievement measured by
grades based on exams. Educa
tion encompasses the totality of
our "Stanford experience."
People—Not Papers
Since last spring, active stu
dents in government have been
seriously considering the adop
tion of a new ASSU Constitu
tion. Our present Constitution
is largely based upon the an
achronous concept which im
pedes the development of a
truly responsible individual—
the concept of in loco parentis.
However, a new Constitution
will not mean a new Stanford;
it will merely mean a new Con
stitution.
Student Power
In recent times it has become
fashionable to criticize student
government at Stanford as

BUREAUCRATIC and oven IM
POTENT. But are such state
ments justifiable? Is the bur
eaucracy responsible for the fail
ure of a student government, or
are the students themselves at
fault?
At the legislature meeting of
Nov. 21, Jeff Kane proposed the
formation of nine committees
open to "all interested members
of the Stanford Community."
Here are two examples.
One of the committees was
described as follows:
"ASSU Constitution and By-
Laws — An intensive examina
tion of the Constitution, per
haps rewriting it. The structure
of LASSU will be considered
specifically, but not exclusively."
This committee was publi
cized in The Daily, and notices
were posted in the dorms. Not
one student volunteered.
Another committee proposed
was referred to as "Course Eval
uation Booklet" Four students
volunteered. The committee
now has thirteen members.
Their "pilot" questionnaire is
now being analyzed at the com
putation center; they plan a
complete evaluation of Fresh
man English which will begin
in two weeks.
Why did the former fail and
the latter succeed? Is it that we
lack the means to bring about
change, or de we lack the moti
vation?
