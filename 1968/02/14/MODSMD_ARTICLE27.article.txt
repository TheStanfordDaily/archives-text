# Undergraduate Special
## Human Sexuality Course Planned 
### DAVE LOMBARDI 
*'Human Sexuality" will be
one of three new undergraduate
special courses available next
quarter.
*The two other courses are en
tiAod "Risk and Insurance" and
"Progress in Medicine."
J The new courses, says Rob
<*t Hind of the Committee on
Undergraduate Education
(CUE), are designed "to per
ifiit the undergraduate to take
did vantage of the resources
Offered by our professional
/graduate schools."

The course in human sexual
ity is unique both in its origin
and its previous absence from
university curriculums at Stan
ford and elsewhere.
The idea for the course was
an unexpected by-product of the
University Health Committee,
formed last year to evaluate the
overall university health pic
ture.
Asst. Prof, of Psychiatry
Hernat Katchadourian has
agreed to teach the course and
has formulated a tentative out
line.

The three unit course will
meet at 9 a.m. on Mondays and
Wednesdays for lecture and
with teaching assistants a third
day of the week. Much reading
will bo included.
Enrollment in the course will
be limited due to the unweildi
ness of large discussion groups.
The course will approach
human sexuality In four
phases. The Introductory ses
sions will focus on anatomy,
physical and psychological as
pects of sex, pregnancy, and
childbirth. These sessions will
be handled by Dr. Katcha
dourian.
Dr. Katchadourian will be
assisted on the remaining
phases by other specialists from
the university and community.
Representatives from the de
partment of art, department of
English, department of biology,
department of anthropology,
from the Dean of the Chapel's
office and from the legal pro
fession will concentrate on their
specific aspect of the subject.
These visiting specialists will
discuss the ontogeny and phylo
geny of sex, the pathology of
sex, and the cultural aspects of
sex after Dr. Katchadourian has
established the technical ground
work necessary for a frank eval
uation of the attitudes that will
be examined.
During the weeks of lectures,
the material will be regarded as
objectively as is possible and
moral judgments will be
avoided.
The final phase of the
course will be a panel discus
sion with students on the

moral issues that the course
will uncover, such as premari
tal sex, pregnancy outside
marriage and birth control
from the religious, legal, hu
manistic, and hedonistic points
of view.
Dr. Katchadourian enumer
ated his aims for the course: to

provide the students with basic,
reliable data; to present frank
appraisals of issues; and finally,
to provide the student with a
basis for a systematic examin
ation of his own opinions and
beliefs. He emphasized the fact
that the student will not be ad
vised or preached to.
