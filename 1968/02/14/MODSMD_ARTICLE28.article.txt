## Musical 'Minim' Misses Its Mark 
### JOSEPH OKPAKU 
Anyone out for an evening of
light entertainment that neither
tasks the emotion nor tickles the
intellect will probably find "Wait
a Minim" worth his while.
The musical show, which the
producer prefers not to call a
revue, is a string of minor the
atrical, musical skits that make
little jokes out of trifles.
The series ranges from the
half-minute pantomine of Ken
drew Lascelles carrying his
dirty old tuba across the stage
with a cute wink for the rath
er peculiar Saturday night's
audience, to Nigel Pegram
singing the "Black White
Calypso" to his own guitar ac
companiment
Whites rub ointments to get
a tan, blacks rub bleach creams
for lighter skin. If whites want
to look black and blacks white,
why not marry? Get a little bit
of black at night and a little
bit of white God knows when.
All in all, the group is highly
skilled, and possibly talented.
Andrew Tracey can play some
sixteen musical instruments, and
his brother, Paul, twelve.
As for the leading female in
the group, Anglo • American
Award winning April Olrich, she
is, in the words of producer Leon
Gluckman, "the only talented
lady (he) personally (knows)
who is actually born in Zanzi
bar."

Besides that, she has a pair
of large eyes which actually
work, and help accent her recur
rent role as a silly little blond
girl caught, rose in hand, in the
pseudo-ballet of a garden ro
mance.
Michael Martel, the stubby
Frenchman in the group, has
a mastery of his rather ap
pealing voice which he uses
to theatrical rather than musi
cal advantage, a pre-occupa
tion which had Its own charm.
As for the pieces of folk-songs,
they were at their best in Peg
ram's solos, though the general
efficiency of presentation, in the
group numbers earned its own
applause. The neat cleverness
of the stage business and skill
ful use of light and sound yielded
some of the best echoes of dra
matic quality of the evening at
the Curran, and the visual effect
of two-dimensionality was rath
er appealing.
Not much that is serious or
meaningful can be said about
"Wait a Minim." The voices are
not the best for singing, the
actions not the best for drama,
and the music not the best for
concert or show-business. As for
the little political cracks, they
were sufficiently nebulous, am
biguous and balanced (fair per
haps?) that they lost all impact
and meaning.
It will be at the Curran The
ater in San Francisco for the
next couple of weeks.

of two-dimensionality was rath
er appealing.
Not much that is serious or
meaningful can be said about
"Wait a Minim." The voices are
not the best for singing, the
actions not the best for drama,
and the music not the best for
concert or show-business. As for
the little political cracks, they
were sufficiently nebulous, am
biguous and balanced (fair per
haps?) that they lost all impact
and meaning.
It will be at the Curran The
ater in San Francisco for the
next couple of weeks.
Anyone out for an evening of
light entertainment that neither
tasks the emotion nor tickles the
intellect will probably find "Wait
a Minim" worth his while.
The musical show, which the
producer prefers not to call a
revue, is a string of minor the
atrical, musical skits that make
little jokes out of trifles.
The series ranges from the
half-minute pantomine of Ken
drew Lascelles carrying his
dirty old tuba across the stage
with a cute wink for the rath
er peculiar Saturday night's
audience, to Nigel Pegram
singing the "Black White
Calypso" to his own guitar ac
companiment
Whites rub ointments to get
a tan, blacks rub bleach creams
for lighter skin. If whites want
to look black and blacks white,
why not marry? Get a little bit
of black at night and a little
bit of white God knows when.
All in all, the group is highly
skilled, and possibly talented.
Andrew Tracey can play some
sixteen musical instruments, and
his brother, Paul, twelve.
As for the leading female in
the group, Anglo • American
Award winning April Olrich, she
is, in the words of producer Leon
Gluckman, "the only talented
lady (he) personally (knows)
who is actually born in Zanzi
bar."

Besides that, she has a pair
of large eyes which actually
work, and help accent her recur
rent role as a silly little blond
girl caught, rose in hand, in the
pseudo-ballet of a garden ro
mance.
Michael Martel, the stubby
Frenchman in the group, has
a mastery of his rather ap
pealing voice which he uses
to theatrical rather than musi
cal advantage, a pre-occupa
tion which had Its own charm.
As for the pieces of folk-songs,
they were at their best in Peg
ram's solos, though the general
efficiency of presentation, in the
group numbers earned its own
applause. The neat cleverness
of the stage business and skill
ful use of light and sound yielded
some of the best echoes of dra
matic quality of the evening at
the Curran, and the visual effect
of two-dimensionality was rath
er appealing.
