# Clark Outlines Role Of Supreme Court
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
The Supreme Court probably
never will rule on the morality
of the Vietnam War, although
the Spock and Coffin cases
might well reach the high bench,
according to ex-Supreme Court
Justice Tom Clark, who spoke
at Delta Upsilon last night.
Tonight Clark will speak
In Tresidder's large lounge at
7:30 p.m. on "Individual
Rights and The Supreme
Court." All members of the
Stanford community are in
vited to attend.
A guest of the Inter-Fratern
ity Council, Clark spoke last
night before an informal group
of about forty-five people.
Early in the discussion, Clark
told of the formal procedures
of the Supreme Court and how
cases are handled.
He said that many people
have the mistaken notion that
the Court can rule on anything
it wishes, but in reality the
Court "can only take cases in
volving federal laws or the Con
stitution," and such a case
would have "to effect a substan
tial number of people before
we would take it."

Many people, Clark added,
have leveled the charge that the
Court thinks it is its own self
appointed "Constitutional Con
vention" or else tries to infringe
upon the rights of Congress.
He refuted this and empha
sized that the Supreme Court
does not try to "legislate" any
statute, "but we try to resolve
ourselves to interpret" federal
laws and the Constitution.
Commenting on the Warren
Commission, Clark said his
main contention was that a
member of the judiciary
"should not take part In exec
utlve actions." He cited a sim
ilar commission set up to in
vestigate the Pearl Harbor
attack and criticized it for the
same reason.
On segregation, the ex-justice
asserted, "We can't wipe out
segregation overnight." Al
though he declared himself for
civil rights, he indicated that "a
state like Mississippi, which
may be 65 per cent Negro,
(should have) more time than
a state like Delaware which is
about 5 per cent Negro" to
solve its racial problems.
One question was directed to
ward political pressure that
might be put on Supreme Court
judges. Clark told of several
threats against him and his
family, including a phone call
in which a man said, "I saw ya
walking across the street. I had
a gun an I was gonna shoot
ya, but I decided not ta."
When asked whether Presi
dent Johnson's travel tax pro
posal might violate the Consti
tution, Clark replied, "Certain
ly (the right to travel) is one
of our precious rights, but we
(the Supreme Court) don't look
into taxes too much. So long as
it's not manifestly unconstitu
tional, we don't bother with it."
Clark is the national president
of Delta Tau Delta. As a guest

in residence of the Inter-Fra
ternity Council, his visit is part
of the fraternities' annual Greek
Week activities.
The guest program was de
devloped to bring national fig
ures to the Stanford campus
under the fraternities' sponsor
ship.
Before being appointed Su
preme Court Justice by Presi
dent Truman, Clark served four
years as Attorney General.
