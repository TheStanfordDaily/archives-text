# Fifteen Proposals
## Engineering Report Favors Change 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
The Study of Engineering Ed
ucation (SEE) has issued its
"midterm" report. SEE is the
engineering school's counter
part to the Study of Education
at Stanford.
In its report, SEE lists 15
"propositions" which are intend
ed to "catalyze the thinking" of
the engineering students. Tau
Beta Pi, the engineering honors
society, is sponsoring a student
forum next Monday to discuss
the propositions. The meeting
will be at 7:30 in the Forum
Room of the Undergraduate Li
brary.
The faculty group empha
sizes that they are not en
dorsing' any of the proposals,
but are just throwing them
out in the hope of getting
feedback from the students.
Members of the committee in
clude Professors Ralph Smith,
electrical engineering; Perry
McCarty, civil engineering; Wil
liam Reynolds, mechanical en
gineering; and James Adams,
mechanical engineering.
Nine seminars are being con
ducted in conjunction with the
SEE. Seven of these have also
Issued mid-term reports which
will serve as a further basis for
the Tau Beta Pi discussion Mon
day night.
Several of the discussions
deal with the liberalization of
the "core" and degree require
ments. For example, the estab
lishment of a B.A. in engineer
ing is one of the discussion top
ics.
Another topic is the forma
tion of a tightly integrated
math-physics-engineering core of

75 units. Completion of the 75
units, along with the University
B.A. requirements would entitle
the student to the B.A. in engi
neering. If, on the other hand,
the student wanted a 8.5., he
would take an additional 45
units of "courses with a high
professional content."
The abandonment of under
graduate education at Stan
ford is another discussion top
ic proposed by the committee.
Establishment of a work-study
program for engineering un
dergraduates is listed as a
possible method for bringing
"reality" into basic engineer
ing.

One proposal is that the stu
dent "be better appraised of the
relationship between engineer
ing and society.... He must be
allowed to work on problems of
contemporary importance." One
of the SEE seminars deals with
this problem.
In contradiction to the pro
posal for the abandonment of
the undergraduate program is a
proposal for the establishment
of a separate undergraduate en
gineering department which
would emphasize teaching rath
er than research.
Other discussion topics pro
posed by the SEE commiTtee in
clude the establishment of an

introductory course for non
majors which would make them
"aware of the capabilities and
limitations of technology if they
are to properly influence the fu
ture." Also, the total abandon
ment of the core program will
be a topic of discussion.
Increased emphasis on cre
ativity and imagination and a
change in the manner of grad
ing to allow for this emphasis
form a final topic of discussion.
The Interim reports of the
seminars point out the lack of
concensus as to the precise
nature of the reform needed.
Most of the groups seem to
agree that substantial change

is needed, but the scope and
extent of the change is sub
ject to much controversy.
Some seminar proposals in
clude the formation of "small
informal" seminars on "Why
Engineering?" for students in
the freshman year.
The seminar on the "core"
curriculum concedes that core
curriculums are, by nature, re
strictive. One suggestion is for
each department to decide what
core requirements are appli
cable to its area. Those courses
whose relevance is tenuous
would then be dropped by the
individual departments for their
majors.
One seminar deals with "So
cial Content In Stanford Engi
neering Education."
