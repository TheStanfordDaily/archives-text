# Draft Boards Toughen Line; CO Status Harder To Obtain
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
two national organisations that
counsel conscientious objectors
to military service say draft
boards are taking a harder line
toward such young men.
"War psychology has made it
more difficult to get a C-O clas
sification," says Arlo Tatum,
executive secretary of the Cen
tral Committee for Conscien
tious Objectors.
"Very lately we've been get
ting some eases that seem to
Indicate a growing hard line,"
adds J. Harold Sherk, execu
tive secretary of the National
Service Board for Religious
Objectors.
Selective Service says there
has been no increase in the pro
portion of draft registrants hold
ing C-O exemptions.
But it has no figures to show
how many such exemptions are
granted in any given year or
how many men apply for one
and are refused.
Tatum's organization, based
in Philadelphia, has become
linked to some Vietnam protests
because it will help selective ob
jectors—young men opposed
specifically to the Vietnam war.
The National Service Board,
operating a block from the
White House, is more religion
oriented than the Central Com
mittee and does not accept the
principle of selective objection.
The Central Committee is
spending $150,000 this year to
counsel objectors, the Service
Board $53,000.
Both organizations mail out
thousands of pieces of literature

to inquiring young men, but
each says it doesn't try to tell
anyone what to say to his draft
board.
Selective Service uses two
classifications for C-Os. It can
give a 1-0 classification to a
man who for religious reasons
opposes any induction into mili
tary service.
The man can be drafted for
two years of civilian national
service work, however, for ex
ample as a hospital orderly.
A man with a I-A-0 classifica
tion can be inducted into mili
tary service but not required to
bear arms. These men often

serve as medics.
Selective Service says there
are 1.7 conscientious objectors
per 1,000 registrants, the same
as during the Korean War. At
the end of the year, 11,041 men
were classified I-O.
An additional 6,367 were
working in national-service jobs
in lieu of induction and 6,830
had completed such work. The
Pentagon says about 4,000 men
now in service hold I-A-O classi
fications.
Tatum says the Central Com
mittee has 3.000 active cases
and has tripled its counseling
caseload since 1963.

The Jaguars, a San Jose
group specializing in soul-rock
music, will play at a Branner
Hall dance next Saturday night
from 9 to 12:30.
Branner residents, their dates,
and all girls will be admitted
to the dance free. All others
must pay $1.50 at the door.
The Jaguars, who have been
playing together for three years,
have won the "Combo of the
Year" title in the Santa Clara
Valley. "St. James Infirmary" is
their latest recording for Dot
records.
