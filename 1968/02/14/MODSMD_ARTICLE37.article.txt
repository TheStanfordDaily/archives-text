# To Replace Leland Jr.
## $15 Million For New Son 
### 
Sen. Stanford felt the loss of
his son Leland Jr. so deeply that
he once offered $15 million for
the adoption of another young
ster who resembled him.
The strange story came to
light here with a gift from the
widow of the man who once
caught Sen. Stanford's eye, Mrs.
Cyrus A. Dolph of San Mateo.
Her husband attended Stan
ford University for a year in
1897-98, then made the Army
his career. Col. Dolph was the
son of Sen. Joseph Norton
Dolph of Oregon, a contem
porary of Sen. Stanford. The
colonel died In 1945.

The Dolphs and the Stanfords
were neighbors in Washington
when both men were serving in
the Senate, 1884 to 1888.
According to the reminis
cences of the late Col. Dolph, he
was invited in 1885 as a young
man to the Stanford home. Sen.
Stanford commented on his re
semblance to Leland Jr., who
had died in 1884 of typhoid fever
in Florence.
Sen. Stanford, apparently in
earnest, asked young Dolph if
he would like to be adopted and
in fact offered the boy's father
$15 million if he would consent
to the adoption.
The closeness of the two fami
lies can be seen in the copy of
a portrait of herself painted by
Bonnat which Mrs. Stanford
gave the Dolphs, and which has
just been turned over to the
University by Col. Dolph's
widow.
Mrs. Dolph, now in her late

80's, still has some jewelry also
given her by Mrs. Stanford.
The portrait copy now
hangs in the Hopkins Room
of the main library at Stan
ford. The $15 million later
went into the University's en
dowment, according to Ralph
Hansen, University archivist
The original portrait and the
white lace dress in which Mrs.
Stanford posed are on display
in the Stanford Museum.
All three of the Stanford fam
ily portraits were painted at the
same time in 1879 by the three
most celebrated French artists
of the time: Meisonnier for Sen.
Stanford, Carlos Duran for Ice
land Jr., and Bonnat for Mrs.
Stanford.
It was Bonnat who suggested
the white satin dress adorned
with heavy white lace. The lace
was specially ordered from
Brussels for the occasion, ac
cording to the records of Bertha
Berner, Mrs. Stanford's long
time private secretary.

of Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stanford, a copy of which has been given to

hangs in the Hopkins Room
of the main library at Stan
ford. The $15 million later
went into the University's en
dowment, according to Ralph
Hansen, University archivist
The original portrait and the
white lace dress in which Mrs.
Stanford posed are on display
in the Stanford Museum.
All three of the Stanford fam
ily portraits were painted at the
same time in 1879 by the three
most celebrated French artists
of the time: Meisonnier for Sen.
Stanford, Carlos Duran for Ice
land Jr., and Bonnat for Mrs.
Stanford.
It was Bonnat who suggested
the white satin dress adorned
with heavy white lace. The lace
was specially ordered from
Brussels for the occasion, ac
cording to the records of Bertha
Berner, Mrs. Stanford's long
time private secretary.


FROM OUT OF THE PAST — This Is the famous Bonn at painting
of Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stanford, a copy of which has been given to
the Stanford Library by Mrs. Cyrus Dolph of San Mateo.
Sen. Stanford felt the loss of
his son Leland Jr. so deeply that
he once offered $15 million for
the adoption of another young
ster who resembled him.
The strange story came to
light here with a gift from the
widow of the man who once
caught Sen. Stanford's eye, Mrs.
Cyrus A. Dolph of San Mateo.
Her husband attended Stan
ford University for a year in
1897-98, then made the Army
his career. Col. Dolph was the
son of Sen. Joseph Norton
Dolph of Oregon, a contem
porary of Sen. Stanford. The
colonel died In 1945.

The Dolphs and the Stanfords
were neighbors in Washington
when both men were serving in
the Senate, 1884 to 1888.
According to the reminis
cences of the late Col. Dolph, he
was invited in 1885 as a young
man to the Stanford home. Sen.
Stanford commented on his re
semblance to Leland Jr., who
had died in 1884 of typhoid fever
in Florence.
Sen. Stanford, apparently in
earnest, asked young Dolph if
he would like to be adopted and
in fact offered the boy's father
$15 million if he would consent
to the adoption.
The closeness of the two fami
lies can be seen in the copy of
a portrait of herself painted by
Bonnat which Mrs. Stanford
gave the Dolphs, and which has
just been turned over to the
University by Col. Dolph's
widow.
Mrs. Dolph, now in her late

80's, still has some jewelry also
given her by Mrs. Stanford.
