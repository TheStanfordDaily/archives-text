# Gavin Will Present Other Side Of War

### 
Vietmm war critic General
James Gavin will speak today at
4:30 in Memorial Auditorium.
Gavin's speech is sponsored by
the Political Union in an effort
to balance the opinions on Viet
nam expressed yesterday by the
comparatively hawkish Senator
Gale McGee (D.-Wyoming).
In reaction to the recent Com

munist drive in South Vietnam,
Gavin said last week that if the
U.S. had adopted his strategy
of using troops to hold firmly
fortified positions in the coun
try, the offensive would have
been stopped cold.
He charged American forces
were "spread too thin, doing
the job the South Vietnamese
forces should be doing."
Gavin retired in 1958 from
33 years in the Army partly be
cause his disagreement with
President Eisenhower's policy of
massive retaliation for any nu
clear attack.
A lieutenant general, he com
manded an airborne division at
the end of World War 11. At 38
he was the youngest man ever
to hold such a post.
After the war Gavin continued
to serve in staff positions In the
Army, and after his retirement
was named U.S. Ambassador to
France by President Kennedy.
He is now head of a Massa
chusetts industrial research com
pany.
Gavin graduated in 1929 from
West Point and has written four
books.
