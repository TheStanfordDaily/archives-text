• More Troops To Viet
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
United States is speeding an ad
ditional 10,500 Army and Marine
ground fighters to South Viet
nam as insurance against a
"second round" Communist city
offensive and assault on the Khe
Sanh bastion.
The Pentagon announced
Tuesday that "in compliance
with Gen. William C. Westmore
land's request we are deploying
approximately 10,500 additional
troops to South Vietnam."
The action raised the possibil
ity that the United States may
increase its planned troop ceil
ing in Vietnam beyond 525,000
and that National Guard and
Reserve ground forces may be
called to active duty.
Asst. Secretary of Defense
Phil G. Goulding told newsmen
the rapid shipment of the addi
tional 10,000 ground troops is in
response to a Westmoreland re
quest received in "the last few
days," and that they are being
shipped for "insurance pur
poses."
• Fighting Continues
SAIGON (AP) — Allied forces
fought Communist holdouts at

Saigon and Hue Wednesday and
braced for a new Red offensive
with the prospect of swift rein
forcement by 10.500 fresh U.S.
Army and Marine combat
troops.
Allied batteries heavily shell
ed suspect Communist troop con
centrations and routes of enemy
movement around Saigon early
Wednesday in which artillery
men call "Hand I," harassment
and interdiction fire. Explosions
rattled windows.
The predawn barrages fol
lowed up the closest strike of
the war to Saigon by U.S. 852
Stratofortresses. The eight-en
gine jets, each of which can car
ry 30 tons of explosives, staged
a saturation raid on a suspected
enemy gathering only seven
miles north-northwest of the
capital.
While shooting incidents per
sisted in and around Saigon, the
main battle action centered at
Hue, the only one of the 35 cities
in which the Communists main
tained organized resistance to
the allied counterattacks against
their lunar new year offensive.
Advices from Khe Sanh, the
embattled base of 5,000 U.S. Ma
rines in the northwest corner of
the country said North Viet

namese gunners kept up their
sporadic shelling, but no signifi
cant ground action developed.
Khe Sanh is expected to be
the target of the next big enemy
offensive.
• Higher Student Fees
SACRAMENTO (AP)— Gov.
Reagan declared yesterday he
will press for acceptance of
higher student fees when the
University of California Board
of Regents meets Saturday.
The governor told his weekly
news conference that he is de
termined to push for the in
crease even though three re
gents reportedly are unhappy
with his decision to give UC
only $280 million in his pro
posed budget. The university
had asked for $311 million in
the coming fiscal year.
Reagan charged that regents
who have served on the board
for a number of years are un
derstandably devotrd to the uni-

versity but this sometimes
"makes them forget they have
a responsibility to the people of
California."
• U.S., S. Korea Talk
SEOUL (AP) — President
Johnson's trouble shooter, Cy
rus R. Vance, had "rough
going" Tuesday in talks with
South Korean leaders toward
eliminating differences between
the United States and its close
Asian ally, Korean sources re
ported.
Vance met for almost three
hours with Premier Chung ll
kwon and top Cabinet ministers
on problems raised by the crisis
involving South Korea's worries
over its defense posture in the
face of Communist North Ko
rean threats. The sources re
ported little progress was made.
Vance planned yet another
meeting with Chung Wednes
day and was expected later in
the day to pay his second visit

to President Chung Hee Park.
Whether that would be
Vance's final conference here
nobody in authority was willing
to say, but the presidential en
voy already has extend d his
visit one day beyond his sched
ule.
As preparations were made
for the meeting, there were all
manner of rumors, one of which
was that there might be a break
in the deadlock over the ship
and crew. There was no way of
getting any hard information on
what the Communists had in
mind however. They might re
lease the body of the one dead
crew member and turn over
three injured crewmen.
• War Widow Mail
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
federal government began an
investigation Tuesday of inci
dents in which bitter antiwar
propaganda was sent anony
mously through the mail to a

woman whose husband was
killed in Vietnam.
Some of the material said
American servicemen fighting
in Vietnam are worse than can
nibals. The young widow re
ceived it twice within a month
after her husband died.
Pentagon sources said the
Army's Criminal Investigations
Division would take charge of
the case and would call in the
FBI to investigate the source of
the mailings.
"Wh°n women are contacted
in this manner we're encourag
ing them to let us know about
it," a Pentagon spokesman said.
"This junk is all objectionable
from a moral and ethical sense,
but lr-gally there is often little
we can do except appeal to the
sender to stop It."
• Stassen: Out To Win
WASHINGTON (AP)—Harold
E. Stassen described himself yes
terday as the peace candidate of
th" Republicans in the New
Hampshire and Wisconsin pres
idential primaries. He said he
is out to win.
Stassen, former governor of
Minnesota, is making his fourth
try for the GOP presidential

nomination. He told a news con
ference there is an increasing
movement nationally for him.
Asked if he hoped to win or
to affect Republican policy, he
replied: "Both — we are out to
win."
• Reservists To Viet?
NEW YORK (AP) — Many of
the Reserve airmen summoned
to active duty in the first flush
of the USS Pueblo crisis are be
ginning to wonder when, where
and whether they will be sent to
a combat zone.
Some of the 14,600 suspect
now that if they engage in any
fighting it will be in Vietnam,
not North Korea.
There is speculation that a
main reason for the Jan. 25
call-up was to free home-based
active duty units for use over
seas.
The Pentagon declines to pro
vide any hint of what is to
come.
A survey of the bases where
the Reservists are serving indi
cated, however, that so far none
has received foreign shipping
orders.
In general, the units appear
