HOW TO
STAY OF
THE ARMY
A GUIDE TO YOUR RIGHTS
UNDER THE DRAFT LAW
BY CONIIAD .I.LYNN
Conrad Lynn is one of the most experienced draft latvyers
in the L nited States. He has specitdized in draft cases since
World War 11.
His hook is based upon two beliefs:
• That it is every young man's patriotic duty to stay
out of the army, in order to help save America
from the greatest shame in its history.
• 1 hat every young man should have access to the
same information used by the rich — who spend
thousands of dollars on legal advice to get
deferments and exemption.
In this book, he puts his knowledge and experience at
the service of the young men of America who refuse
to cooperate in the crime of Vietnam.
