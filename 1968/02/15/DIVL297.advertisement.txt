The Idolatry of Knowledge
Half of all the books which have ever been written have been written
within the past fifty years,- ninety percent of all the scientists who have ever
been on earth are living today; ninety-five percent of all discoveries and in
ventions have taken place in the past ten to fifteen years. These amazing
facts demonstrate the rapid expansion of human knowledge in recent years,
just as Daniel once phrophesied in the Old Ttestament, "Many shall run to
and fro, and knowledge shall increase".
The transmission of human knowledge to young people now occurs at such
a stepped-up, accelerated pace that a phenomenon known as "future shock"
is occurring among many fine young people who simply can not assimilate
all the knowledge being fed into them, especially under the pressure of fierce
competition from fellow students and rapid emotional changes associated with
the teen-age years. "Future shock" causes some to rebel and become hippies
others to join the army, and many to react strongly against a meaingless
Establishmnt. Those who endure often repress their frustration, but thus be
come open to the challenge of a liberating, revolutionary leader or anarchist
should one appear on the scene at the right time.
Unfortunately much of the knowledge communicated to young people today
is useless, worldly knowledge. While Moses was eloquent and learned in the
knowledge of Egypt, and Daniel wise in the knowledge of Babylon, both these
men were taught by the Spirit of God, and both had deeper, spiritual lessons
of higher priority to learn about life from their Creator.
God intends man to walk by faith. Paul writes in Romans and Galatians,
The just shall live by faith". Hebrews rcords, "Without faith it is impossible
to please God". Faith, which is action based on belief, properly begins with
instruction of the mind.
The instructions which are fed into the mind are the knowledge of God
from the revelation God has given to us in the Bible. Unless we obey what
we are given in a step by step pattern, we gain no new knowledge of God.
That is, God teaches not only in the head, but also in experience, first the one
then the other.. Obedience to what we know about God is rewarded by further
knowledge and instruction. This is what is meant by the expression, "We walk
by faith, for the things which are visible are temporary, but the things which
are unseen are eternal."
It is a very dangerous thing to have knowledge without experience. Paul
writes, "Knowledge puffs up, but love edifies." The Pharisees were men of
knowledge, thoroughly educated and trained in the best seminaries and schools
Jesus called them "white washed sepulchres, outwardly appearing righteous
to men, but inwardly filled with dead men's bones and all uncleanness."
In our western world we have too long worshipped knowledge and science.
Bibical speaking this is the idolatrous worship of Minerva, the goddess of
science and knowledge. The Bible says, Let no one deceive himself. If any one
among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may
become wise. For the wisdom of this world is fully with God. For it is
written, 'he catches the wise in their craftiness', and again, 'the Lord knows
that the thoughts of the wise are futile'. So let no one boast of men."
The mind of Christ, access to the thought life of God and the hidden secrets
of God is by faith, that is, trust, reliance, obedience and actions in complete
and daily surrender to Jesus Christ as Lord and Master. The sterile barrenness
of the church today, its inability to meet the intellectual, academic world
today is not due to intellectual neglect and poor scholarship, but is due to
spiritual apathy and lack of discipleship. Time will show that only those
experientially deep with God will stand in the days of coming stress.
