# Pediatricians Will Refuse To Report LSD Patients
## 
### 
Pediatricians at the Stanford
School of Medicine announced
yesterday they wil refuse to re
port to the police cases result
ing from the use of LSD and
other hallucinatory dr.ugs.
The doctors said their concern
was with the medical welfare of
drug patients, not with the le
gal ramifications of drug use.
The author of the statement,
Dr. Normal Sissman, associate
professor of pediatrics, denied
press reports that any "employee
of the hospital or, member of
the faculty" reported the recent
San Mateo incident involving the
two pre school children of Stan
ford professor Jerome Feldman
(see story this page).
The two boys were accidental
ly given LSD last December. The
case eventually led the trial
and conviction of their father
on misdemeanor charges of pos
session of LSD.

"More Important than this in
accuracy," Sissman added, "is
the fear which the incident ap
pears to have engendered in the
minds of many Bay Area citi
zens as to the consequences of
seeking medical help for the
treatment of adverse reactions
following the ingestion of drugs
with 'mind-altering' properties."
Many people have concluded
that calling a physician under
such circumstances can re
sult In notoriety, legal prose
cution, and even imprison
ment. Pediatricians at the Med
ical Center feel strongly that
this is an unfounded fear and
are concerned about the pos
sible results of such an atti
tude."
The physicians' statement
went on to say that from a legal
viewpoint that although LSD is
included in the list of danger
ous drugs whose possession is
a misdemeanor, physicians are
under no obligation to report vio
lations of this or any other drug
law. Such action or lack of it
is entirely up to the discretion
of the doctor.
Dr. Joseph Davis, head of th"
clinic pediatrics department, em
phasized this is the position of
the Medical Center's policy. He
pointed out that the Feldman
incident was reported by the
family pediatrician, Dr. Marga
ret Kosek, who is a member of
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic.
District attorneys in both San
Mateo and Santa Clara counties
have stated physicians have a
legal obligation to report LSD
cases in at least some instances
— depending on the circum
stances.
Keith Sorenson, San Mateo
County district attorney, added
that there is a moral responsi
bility, if not a legal one.
Physicians Argument
The physicians' statement,
however, argues, "with strong
conviction that the great major
ity of physicians take the view
that the welfare of their patients
demands assurance to the pa
tients that their doctors' sole
concern will be with the medical
problem.
The ' "atemont, prompted by
the Feiuman incident, said that
the caso had "highlight d a med
ical problem of growing concern.
It is fervently hoped that . . .
those faced with arute problems

of this type will seek whatever,
professional help may be neces
sary free from fear that their
requests to help will be more
baneful than beneficial."
Child Abuse
In noting that the Feldman
case might be one of child abuse
it was explained that present
state laws require that physi
cians report cases of child beat
ings or cases in which the in
juries inflicted are in direct vio
lation of the penal code. Evi
dence of possible assault cases
must also be reported.

Robert Webb, Santa Clara
County assistant district attor
ney, said that he could not en
tirely exclude LSD from the sec
tion on general reporting of
crimes.
He added that the legality of
reporting a case would depend
strongly on circumstances of the
case.
The statement issued by the
pediatricians, however, stressed
that the physicians' comments
"in no way imply any judgment
on the justice or desirability of
the law."

DEMONSTRATION — Fifty persons gathered in front of the Oakland Induction Center yesterday in
support of four men who said they refused to be drafted. Timothy English, 23, spokesman for the
group, commented that after turning in his papers, a Marine officer questioned him "apparently
to see if I was in my right mind." Others were identified as Jeff Browning and Mark Riley, who like
English are from the Palo Alto Peace and Liberation Commune, and Robert Abernathy, 21, of San
Francisco. Lt. Col. Clyde Cortex, commanding officer of the induction center, said everything pro

and conviction of their father
on misdemeanor charges of pos
session of LSD.

"More Important than this in
accuracy," Sissman added, "is
the fear which the incident ap
pears to have engendered in the
minds of many Bay Area citi
zens as to the consequences of
seeking medical help for the
treatment of adverse reactions
following the ingestion of drugs
with 'mind-altering' properties."
Many people have concluded
that calling a physician under
such circumstances can re
sult In notoriety, legal prose
cution, and even imprison
ment. Pediatricians at the Med
ical Center feel strongly that
this is an unfounded fear and
are concerned about the pos
sible results of such an atti
tude."
The physicians' statement
went on to say that from a legal
viewpoint that although LSD is
included in the list of danger
ous drugs whose possession is
a misdemeanor, physicians are
under no obligation to report vio
lations of this or any other drug
law. Such action or lack of it
is entirely up to the discretion
of the doctor.
Dr. Joseph Davis, head of th"
clinic pediatrics department, em
phasized this is the position of
the Medical Center's policy. He
pointed out that the Feldman
incident was reported by the
family pediatrician, Dr. Marga
ret Kosek, who is a member of
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic.
District attorneys in both San
Mateo and Santa Clara counties
have stated physicians have a
legal obligation to report LSD
cases in at least some instances
— depending on the circum
stances.
Keith Sorenson, San Mateo
County district attorney, added
that there is a moral responsi
bility, if not a legal one.
Physicians Argument
The physicians' statement,
however, argues, "with strong
conviction that the great major
ity of physicians take the view
that the welfare of their patients
demands assurance to the pa
tients that their doctors' sole
concern will be with the medical
problem.
The ' "atemont, prompted by
the Feiuman incident, said that
the caso had "highlight d a med
ical problem of growing concern.
It is fervently hoped that . . .
those faced with arute problems

of this type will seek whatever,
professional help may be neces
sary free from fear that their
requests to help will be more
baneful than beneficial."
Child Abuse
In noting that the Feldman
case might be one of child abuse
it was explained that present
state laws require that physi
cians report cases of child beat
ings or cases in which the in
juries inflicted are in direct vio
lation of the penal code. Evi
dence of possible assault cases
must also be reported.

Robert Webb, Santa Clara
County assistant district attor
ney, said that he could not en
tirely exclude LSD from the sec
tion on general reporting of
crimes.
He added that the legality of
reporting a case would depend
strongly on circumstances of the
case.
The statement issued by the
pediatricians, however, stressed
that the physicians' comments
"in no way imply any judgment
on the justice or desirability of
the law."

DEMONSTRATION — Fifty persons gathered in front of the Oakland Induction Center yesterday in
support of four men who said they refused to be drafted. Timothy English, 23, spokesman for the
group, commented that after turning in his papers, a Marine officer questioned him "apparently
to see if I was in my right mind." Others were identified as Jeff Browning and Mark Riley, who like
English are from the Palo Alto Peace and Liberation Commune, and Robert Abernathy, 21, of San
Francisco. Lt. Col. Clyde Cortex, commanding officer of the induction center, said everything pro
ceeded normally, and he was unaware of any refusals.
Pediatricians at the Stanford
School of Medicine announced
yesterday they wil refuse to re

ing from the use of LSD and
other hallucinatory dr.ugs.
The doctors said their concern
was with the medical welfare of
drug patients, not with the le
gal ramifications of drug use.
The author of the statement,
Dr. Normal Sissman, associate
professor of pediatrics, denied
press reports that any "employee
of the hospital or, member of
the faculty" reported the recent
San Mateo incident involving the
two pre school children of Stan
ford professor Jerome Feldman
(see story this page).
The two boys were accidental

case eventually led the trial

on misdemeanor charges of pos

The physicians' statement
went on to say that from a legal
viewpoint that although LSD is
included in the list of danger
ous drugs whose possession is
a misdemeanor, physicians are
under no obligation to report vio
lations of this or any other drug
law. Such action or lack of it
is entirely up to the discretion
of the doctor.
Dr. Joseph Davis, head of th"
clinic pediatrics department, em
phasized this is the position of
the Medical Center's policy. He
pointed out that the Feldman
incident was reported by the
family pediatrician, Dr. Marga
ret Kosek, who is a member of
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic.
District attorneys in both San
Mateo and Santa Clara counties
have stated physicians have a
legal obligation to report LSD
cases in at least some instances
— depending on the circum
stances.
Keith Sorenson, San Mateo
County district attorney, added
that there is a moral responsi
bility, if not a legal one.
Physicians Argument
The physicians' statement,
however, argues, "with strong
conviction that the great major
ity of physicians take the view
that the welfare of their patients
demands assurance to the pa
tients that their doctors' sole
concern will be with the medical
problem.
The ' "atemont, prompted by
the Feiuman incident, said that
the caso had "highlight d a med
ical problem of growing concern.
It is fervently hoped that . . .
those faced with arute problems

of this type will seek whatever,
professional help may be neces
sary free from fear that their
requests to help will be more
baneful than beneficial."
Child Abuse
In noting that the Feldman
case might be one of child abuse
it was explained that present
state laws require that physi
cians report cases of child beat
ings or cases in which the in
juries inflicted are in direct vio
lation of the penal code. Evi
dence of possible assault cases
must also be reported.

Robert Webb, Santa Clara
County assistant district attor
ney, said that he could not en
tirely exclude LSD from the sec
tion on general reporting of
crimes.
He added that the legality of
reporting a case would depend
strongly on circumstances of the
case.
The statement issued by the
pediatricians, however, stressed
that the physicians' comments
"in no way imply any judgment
on the justice or desirability of
the law."

DEMONSTRATION — Fifty persons gathered in front of the Oakland Induction Center yesterday in
support of four men who said they refused to be drafted. Timothy English, 23, spokesman for the
group, commented that after turning in his papers, a Marine officer questioned him "apparently
to see if I was in my right mind." Others were identified as Jeff Browning and Mark Riley, who like
English are from the Palo Alto Peace and Liberation Commune, and Robert Abernathy, 21, of San
Francisco. Lt. Col. Clyde Cortex, commanding officer of the induction center, said everything pro
ceeded normally, and he was unaware of any refusals.
