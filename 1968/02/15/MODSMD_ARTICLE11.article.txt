# Let Students Hear Student Petitions
## 
### 
The members of the powerful General Studies Committee are
considering a request by their two student "consultants" to be
allowed to attend the committee meetings which hear student pe
titions.
The committee's student members are now excluded from
these sessions, although they are active, non-voting participants
in the committee's other business.
The students' request includes the stipulation that they would
withdraw if the petitioner asks not to have other students present
when his petition for change in some individual course require
ment is considered. The student members are not asking for a
vote on the petitions, but merely to be present.
We believe this is a step that should have been taken long ago.
It will add another dimension to the deliberations of the com
mittee and its subcommittees with student members. Many of
the petitions concern General Studies requirements, and student
opinions on this subject badly need to be heard.
To let the student members sit in on the petitioning would be
a firm step toward community at Stanford.
We urge the faculty members of the General Studies Commit
tee to accept the student proposal.
