of the city of Ben Tre last week

and thunder, in the name of
freedom, in the name of peace,
in the name of the most advanc
ed, humanitarian, peace-loving
nation of all time (if you don't
believe me ask her) the United
States of America and all for
which she stands.
The Other America
And, more to the point, in the
name of you-I. Because that is
what America, in basic terms is,
you-I, not "they," not "the gov
ernment," not "the power struc
ture," not "the military-industri
al complex" or anything like
that. At least that is what the
civics courses-books, politicians,
and newspapers tell me.
Did anybody ask you if you
wanted that city "saved"? (Yes,
that's what the newspaper said,
SAVED). Nobody asked me. Did
anybody ask the thirty some
thousand souls who lived, loved,
slept, ate, worked, made love,
raised cain and families in that
city if they wanted it "saved"?
Of course it's too late to ask
the dead ones so just for the
record let's assume that, yes,
they did want their city "saved"
and then let's take a vote (bar
ring communists, deviationists,
queers, radical Buddhists, and
other unstable anti-American,
Thieu, Ky types) and see if the
inhabitants of an average Viet
namese city of thirty thousand

souls want it to be "savrd." Be
cause if they do then I will stop
being a Vietnik, beatnik, hippie,
peacenik commie-symp Nervous
Nellie and shut up. I will stop
wondering if I am a man gone
mad in a sane society or vice
versa.
Bothered Before
Right now I am sick, deep
down in my soul I am sick, be
cause "saving" cities bothers me.
It bothered me when the Ger
man armies saved the Warsaw
Ghetto, it bothered me when
Japan saved the old walled city
of Manila but of course that
isn't quite the same because the
United States (you-I) save the
cities of our ally.
Anyhow until a vote is taken
to prove something one way or
another, I object to this being
done in the name of the United
States of America because it is
you-I. I object most strenuous
ly-
I am over, age and therefore
it is easy for me to say it but
I object so much that if I had
a draft card I would burn it and
go to jail rather than be a
city "saver" unless someone can
show me how this is a logical,
constructive, life - enhancing
thing to do. If you want cities
"saved" in your name that is
your business. I don't want any
more "saved" in mine.

The Other America
And, more to the point, in the
name of you-I. Because that is
what America, in basic terms is,
you-I, not "they," not "the gov
ernment," not "the power struc
ture," not "the military-industri
al complex" or anything like
that. At least that is what the
civics courses-books, politicians,
and newspapers tell me.
Did anybody ask you if you
wanted that city "saved"? (Yes,
that's what the newspaper said,
SAVED). Nobody asked me. Did
anybody ask the thirty some
thousand souls who lived, loved,
slept, ate, worked, made love,
raised cain and families in that
city if they wanted it "saved"?
Of course it's too late to ask
the dead ones so just for the
record let's assume that, yes,
they did want their city "saved"
and then let's take a vote (bar
ring communists, deviationists,
queers, radical Buddhists, and
other unstable anti-American,
Thieu, Ky types) and see if the
inhabitants of an average Viet
namese city of thirty thousand

souls want it to be "savrd." Be
cause if they do then I will stop
being a Vietnik, beatnik, hippie,
peacenik commie-symp Nervous

wondering if I am a man gone
mad in a sane society or vice
versa.

It bothered me when the Ger

Ghetto, it bothered me when
Japan saved the old walled city
of Manila but of course that
isn't quite the same because the
United States (you-I) save the
cities of our ally.
Anyhow until a vote is taken
to prove something one way or

you-I. I object most strenuous

thing to do. If you want cities
"saved" in your name that is
your business. I don't want any
more "saved" in mine.

Of course it's too late to ask
the dead ones so just for the
record let's assume that, yes,
they did want their city "saved"
and then let's take a vote (bar
ring communists, deviationists,
queers, radical Buddhists, and
other unstable anti-American,
Thieu, Ky types) and see if the
inhabitants of an average Viet
namese city of thirty thousand

souls want it to be "savrd." Be
cause if they do then I will stop
being a Vietnik, beatnik, hippie,
peacenik commie-symp Nervous
Nellie and shut up. I will stop
wondering if I am a man gone
mad in a sane society or vice
versa.
Bothered Before
Right now I am sick, deep
down in my soul I am sick, be
cause "saving" cities bothers me.
It bothered me when the Ger
man armies saved the Warsaw
Ghetto, it bothered me when
Japan saved the old walled city
of Manila but of course that
isn't quite the same because the
United States (you-I) save the
cities of our ally.
Anyhow until a vote is taken
to prove something one way or
another, I object to this being
done in the name of the United
States of America because it is
you-I. I object most strenuous
ly-
I am over, age and therefore
it is easy for me to say it but
I object so much that if I had
a draft card I would burn it and
go to jail rather than be a
city "saver" unless someone can
show me how this is a logical,
constructive, life - enhancing
thing to do. If you want cities
"saved" in your name that is
your business. I don't want any
more "saved" in mine.
