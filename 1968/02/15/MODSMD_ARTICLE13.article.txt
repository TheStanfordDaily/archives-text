# No Impending Defeat
## Vietnam War Shows US Role In Asia

While I do not foresee an im
pending military catastrophe in
Vietnam, it is useful to open dis
cussion of the matter, if only
because the formulation of pol
icy and strategy demands con
sideration of a range of options.
A nation deeply involved in mili
tary conflict must of necessity
be prepared to assess simultan
eously the consequences of vic
tory, stalemate, and defeat.
Coalition Government
Assuming, then, that the
United States were to suffer a
military defeat in Vietnam, one
can foresee the following conse
quences. The negotiated settle
ment would accept the partici
pation of the National Libera
tion Front in a coalition govern
ment, as advocated in the Na
tional Liberation Front's politi
cal program made public in
September of last year.
United States and allied forces
would withdraw from Vietnam
and the bulk of them would re
deploy to nearby areas.
Using a classical pattern of
coup d'etat within the frame
work of a "broad based" govern
ment, the communists would
gradually eliminate from all po
sitions of authority their tem
porary, tactical allies. They
would count on the world press
to sanctify the superficially "le
gal" means used.
At this point, it is to be ex
pected that public opinion would
be sufficiently conditioned and
anxious to accept these events
and, in judging the situation in
Vietnam, would not recall the
numerous prior applications of
"coalition government" tech
niques in, say, Eastern Europe.

The effects of a U.S. defeat
and withdrawal on Vietnam's
immediate neighbors would be
profound. Thailand would al
most certainly seek a massive
and specific U.S. commitment.
Laos, by now well-versed in the
lessons of communist tactics in
a coalition government, would
undoubtedly seek assistance
from the United Nations in
guaranteeing its neutrality and,
failing that, would be put in a
position of choosing between ac
commodation with China and a
communist controlled Vietnam
on the one hand, and a substan
tial allied presence on the other.
Should the United States find
itself forced to act on behalf of
Laos, it is to be expected that
the North Vietnamese, with Chi
nese (and probably Soviet)
backing, would charge the U.S.
with violating the 1962 Geneva
agreements, and would subse
quently intensify the "popular
struggle." Cambodia, always un
predictable under Prince Sihan
ouk, might well surprise every
one by declaring itself on the
non-Communist side. Sihanouk
is under no illusions concerning
his staying power in the face of
a totally hostile neighbor, and
in order to survive would be
given only the chance to throw
in his lot with a revamped alli
ance structure.
Just how long these new ar
rangements would last—if, in
deed, they would last at all—is
a matter of speculation. In any
event, moves toward realign
ment in either direction would
be made quickly, and could pro
duce tensions of the first magni
tude.
The governments of Malaysia,
Singapore, Australia, New Zea
land, the Philippines, states
which have enormous stakes in
the U.S. presence in Vietnam,

and which unanimously support
that presence, would be faced
with a destabilized situation re
quiring them to request further
direct guarantees and commit
ments from the United States.
These they would quickly re
ceive.
Threat in Korea
As I see it, the most profound
threat to world peace would then
arise in Korea, primarily as a
result of a North Korean mis
calculation of U.S. resolve to dis
charge its obligations. Recent
words and deeds emanating
from Pyongyang clearly support
this view. The "second front"
opened by the seizure of the USS
Pueblo, the attempt to assassi
nate President Park Chung Hee,
the rapid increase in border in
cidents, the stepped-up guerrilla
infiltration into South Korea,
and the total militarization of
North Korea and dramatic and
dangerous indicators that Kim
II Sung feels the time has come
to "liberate" South Korea. If
these actions have taken place
while the United States is still
in Vietnam, what can one as
sume will happen with allied
forces gone?
In short, with respect to Asia,
United States commitments
would not decrease but increase.
Defense spending would rise or,
at a minimum, remain at pres
ent levels, and as the number
of potential flashpoints in
creased, present personnel in
Vietnam would merely be rede
ployed to other areas and per
haps augmented.
New Defense Measures
Now, even if this gloomy pic
ture should not come to pass,
there is little reason to believe
that funds released by defusing
Vietnam would "come home" to
be spent for domestic purposes.
Pressing as our internal prob
lems are, any Administration

would be forced to make the cal
culation that the United States,
having proven itself unable to
meet a conventional military
challenge, must necessarily seek
security by other means.
That is to say, it would real
locate funds now being spent in
Vietnam for the purpose of
strengthening strategic offensive
and defensive capabilities. Un
der such circumstances, one
could predict with confidence
that we would, among other
measures, embark on a crash
program to deploy an ABM sys
tem, increase - the deliverable
megatonnage tn our nuclear
stockpiles, and* expand the capa
bilities of the fleet (including, of
course, undersea warfare capa
bilities).
Expanded Commitments
In the final analysis, a mili
tary defeat of the United States
in Vietnam and its subsequent
withdrawal will not turn the
country toward a course of iso
lationism, but will underscore
the enormous commitments it
has made to defend the world
from aggression.
Such a setback—indeed, catas
trophe—would bring into sharp
er focus the overriding issue of
our security and its relation to
America's role as a world power.
One stinging defeat, with its
concomitant blow to the image
which this country maintains of
itself and that which others
maintain, would not dispose the
American people to suffer fur
ther indignities.
A few years ago one eloquent
spokesman put it this way:
"I believe that there can be
only one possible defense pol
icy for the United States. It
can be expressed in one word.
That word is 'first' I do not
mean first, BUT. I do not

mean first, WHEN. I do not
mean first, IF. I mean first—
PERIOD. I mean first across
the board."
"Only then can we stop the
next war before it starts. Only
then can we prevent war by pre
paring for it. . . . The real ques
tion now is whether we are up
to the task—whether each and
every one of us is willing to
face the facts, to bear the bur
dens, to meet our dangers—and
to provide for them. . . . For we
are proud of our country and
we know what it can do with a
little leadership. But when you
are proud of something, you
don't let it deteriorate. You don't
let it stand still so others can
run over it."
The rhetoric of an unrecon
structed Cold Warrior? Talis
manic incantations of a Bible
Belt jingoist? The man was not
known as such. His name was
John F. Kennedy.

would withdraw from Vietnam
and the bulk of them would re
deploy to nearby areas.
Using a classical pattern of
coup d'etat within the frame
work of a "broad based" govern
ment, the communists would
gradually eliminate from all po
sitions of authority their tem
porary, tactical allies. They
would count on the world press
to sanctify the superficially "le
gal" means used.
At this point, it is to be ex
pected that public opinion would
be sufficiently conditioned and
anxious to accept these events
and, in judging the situation in
Vietnam, would not recall the
numerous prior applications of
"coalition government" tech
niques in, say, Eastern Europe.

The effects of a U.S. defeat
and withdrawal on Vietnam's
immediate neighbors would be
profound. Thailand would al
most certainly seek a massive
and specific U.S. commitment.
Laos, by now well-versed in the
lessons of communist tactics in
a coalition government, would
undoubtedly seek assistance
from the United Nations in
guaranteeing its neutrality and,
failing that, would be put in a
position of choosing between ac
commodation with China and a
communist controlled Vietnam
on the one hand, and a substan
tial allied presence on the other.
Should the United States find
itself forced to act on behalf of
Laos, it is to be expected that
the North Vietnamese, with Chi
nese (and probably Soviet)
backing, would charge the U.S.
with violating the 1962 Geneva
agreements, and would subse
quently intensify the "popular
struggle." Cambodia, always un
predictable under Prince Sihan
ouk, might well surprise every
one by declaring itself on the
non-Communist side. Sihanouk
is under no illusions concerning
his staying power in the face of
a totally hostile neighbor, and
in order to survive would be
given only the chance to throw
in his lot with a revamped alli
ance structure.
Just how long these new ar
rangements would last—if, in
deed, they would last at all—is
a matter of speculation. In any
event, moves toward realign
ment in either direction would
be made quickly, and could pro
duce tensions of the first magni
tude.
The governments of Malaysia,
Singapore, Australia, New Zea
land, the Philippines, states
which have enormous stakes in
the U.S. presence in Vietnam,

and which unanimously support
that presence, would be faced
with a destabilized situation re
quiring them to request further
direct guarantees and commit
ments from the United States.
These they would quickly re
ceive.
Threat in Korea
As I see it, the most profound
threat to world peace would then
arise in Korea, primarily as a
result of a North Korean mis
calculation of U.S. resolve to dis
charge its obligations. Recent
words and deeds emanating
from Pyongyang clearly support
this view. The "second front"
opened by the seizure of the USS
Pueblo, the attempt to assassi
nate President Park Chung Hee,
the rapid increase in border in
cidents, the stepped-up guerrilla
infiltration into South Korea,
and the total militarization of
North Korea and dramatic and
dangerous indicators that Kim
II Sung feels the time has come
to "liberate" South Korea. If
these actions have taken place
while the United States is still
in Vietnam, what can one as
sume will happen with allied
forces gone?
In short, with respect to Asia,
United States commitments
would not decrease but increase.
Defense spending would rise or,
at a minimum, remain at pres
ent levels, and as the number
of potential flashpoints in
creased, present personnel in
Vietnam would merely be rede
ployed to other areas and per
haps augmented.
New Defense Measures
Now, even if this gloomy pic
ture should not come to pass,
there is little reason to believe
that funds released by defusing
Vietnam would "come home" to
be spent for domestic purposes.
Pressing as our internal prob
lems are, any Administration

would be forced to make the cal
culation that the United States,
having proven itself unable to
meet a conventional military
challenge, must necessarily seek
security by other means.
That is to say, it would real
locate funds now being spent in
Vietnam for the purpose of
strengthening strategic offensive
and defensive capabilities. Un
der such circumstances, one
could predict with confidence
that we would, among other
measures, embark on a crash
program to deploy an ABM sys
tem, increase - the deliverable
megatonnage tn our nuclear
stockpiles, and* expand the capa
bilities of the fleet (including, of
course, undersea warfare capa
bilities).
Expanded Commitments
In the final analysis, a mili
tary defeat of the United States
in Vietnam and its subsequent
withdrawal will not turn the
country toward a course of iso
lationism, but will underscore
the enormous commitments it
has made to defend the world
from aggression.
Such a setback—indeed, catas
trophe—would bring into sharp
er focus the overriding issue of
our security and its relation to
America's role as a world power.
One stinging defeat, with its
concomitant blow to the image
which this country maintains of
itself and that which others
maintain, would not dispose the
American people to suffer fur
ther indignities.
A few years ago one eloquent
spokesman put it this way:
"I believe that there can be
only one possible defense pol
icy for the United States. It
can be expressed in one word.
That word is 'first' I do not
mean first, BUT. I do not

mean first, WHEN. I do not
mean first, IF. I mean first—
PERIOD. I mean first across
the board."
"Only then can we stop the
next war before it starts. Only
then can we prevent war by pre
paring for it. . . . The real ques
tion now is whether we are up
to the task—whether each and
every one of us is willing to
face the facts, to bear the bur
dens, to meet our dangers—and
to provide for them. . . . For we
are proud of our country and
we know what it can do with a
little leadership. But when you
are proud of something, you
don't let it deteriorate. You don't
let it stand still so others can
run over it."

structed Cold Warrior? Talis

While I do not foresee an im
pending military catastrophe in
Vietnam, it is useful to open dis
cussion of the matter, if only
because the formulation of pol

be prepared to assess simultan

commodation with China and a
communist controlled Vietnam
on the one hand, and a substan
tial allied presence on the other.
Should the United States find
itself forced to act on behalf of
Laos, it is to be expected that
the North Vietnamese, with Chi
nese (and probably Soviet)
backing, would charge the U.S.
with violating the 1962 Geneva
agreements, and would subse
quently intensify the "popular
struggle." Cambodia, always un
predictable under Prince Sihan
ouk, might well surprise every
one by declaring itself on the
non-Communist side. Sihanouk
is under no illusions concerning
his staying power in the face of
a totally hostile neighbor, and
in order to survive would be
given only the chance to throw
in his lot with a revamped alli
ance structure.
Just how long these new ar
rangements would last—if, in
deed, they would last at all—is
a matter of speculation. In any
event, moves toward realign
ment in either direction would
be made quickly, and could pro
duce tensions of the first magni
tude.
The governments of Malaysia,
Singapore, Australia, New Zea
land, the Philippines, states
which have enormous stakes in
the U.S. presence in Vietnam,

and which unanimously support
that presence, would be faced
with a destabilized situation re
quiring them to request further
direct guarantees and commit
ments from the United States.
These they would quickly re
ceive.
Threat in Korea
As I see it, the most profound
threat to world peace would then
arise in Korea, primarily as a
result of a North Korean mis
calculation of U.S. resolve to dis
charge its obligations. Recent
words and deeds emanating
from Pyongyang clearly support
this view. The "second front"
opened by the seizure of the USS
Pueblo, the attempt to assassi
nate President Park Chung Hee,
the rapid increase in border in
cidents, the stepped-up guerrilla
infiltration into South Korea,
and the total militarization of
North Korea and dramatic and
dangerous indicators that Kim
II Sung feels the time has come
to "liberate" South Korea. If
these actions have taken place
while the United States is still
in Vietnam, what can one as
sume will happen with allied
forces gone?
In short, with respect to Asia,
United States commitments
would not decrease but increase.
Defense spending would rise or,
at a minimum, remain at pres
ent levels, and as the number
of potential flashpoints in
creased, present personnel in
Vietnam would merely be rede
ployed to other areas and per
haps augmented.
New Defense Measures
Now, even if this gloomy pic
ture should not come to pass,
there is little reason to believe
that funds released by defusing
Vietnam would "come home" to
be spent for domestic purposes.
Pressing as our internal prob
lems are, any Administration

would be forced to make the cal
culation that the United States,
having proven itself unable to
meet a conventional military
challenge, must necessarily seek
security by other means.
That is to say, it would real
locate funds now being spent in
Vietnam for the purpose of
strengthening strategic offensive
and defensive capabilities. Un
der such circumstances, one
could predict with confidence
that we would, among other
measures, embark on a crash
program to deploy an ABM sys
tem, increase - the deliverable
megatonnage tn our nuclear
stockpiles, and* expand the capa
bilities of the fleet (including, of
course, undersea warfare capa
bilities).
Expanded Commitments
In the final analysis, a mili
tary defeat of the United States
in Vietnam and its subsequent
withdrawal will not turn the
country toward a course of iso
lationism, but will underscore
the enormous commitments it
has made to defend the world
from aggression.
Such a setback—indeed, catas
trophe—would bring into sharp
er focus the overriding issue of
our security and its relation to
America's role as a world power.
One stinging defeat, with its
concomitant blow to the image
which this country maintains of
itself and that which others
maintain, would not dispose the
American people to suffer fur
ther indignities.
A few years ago one eloquent
spokesman put it this way:
"I believe that there can be
only one possible defense pol
icy for the United States. It
can be expressed in one word.
That word is 'first' I do not
mean first, BUT. I do not

mean first, WHEN. I do not
mean first, IF. I mean first—
PERIOD. I mean first across
the board."
"Only then can we stop the
next war before it starts. Only
then can we prevent war by pre
paring for it. . . . The real ques
tion now is whether we are up
to the task—whether each and
every one of us is willing to
face the facts, to bear the bur
dens, to meet our dangers—and
to provide for them. . . . For we
are proud of our country and
we know what it can do with a
little leadership. But when you
are proud of something, you
don't let it deteriorate. You don't
let it stand still so others can
run over it."

While I do not foresee an im
pending military catastrophe in
Vietnam, it is useful to open dis
cussion of the matter, if only
because the formulation of pol
icy and strategy demands con
sideration of a range of options.
A nation deeply involved in mili
tary conflict must of necessity
be prepared to assess simultan
eously the consequences of vic
tory, stalemate, and defeat.
Coalition Government
Assuming, then, that the
United States were to suffer a
military defeat in Vietnam, one
can foresee the following conse
quences. The negotiated settle
ment would accept the partici
pation of the National Libera
tion Front in a coalition govern
ment, as advocated in the Na
tional Liberation Front's politi
cal program made public in
September of last year.
United States and allied forces
would withdraw from Vietnam
and the bulk of them would re
deploy to nearby areas.
Using a classical pattern of
coup d'etat within the frame
work of a "broad based" govern
ment, the communists would
gradually eliminate from all po
sitions of authority their tem
porary, tactical allies. They
would count on the world press
to sanctify the superficially "le
gal" means used.
At this point, it is to be ex
pected that public opinion would
be sufficiently conditioned and
anxious to accept these events
and, in judging the situation in
Vietnam, would not recall the
numerous prior applications of
"coalition government" tech
niques in, say, Eastern Europe.

The effects of a U.S. defeat
and withdrawal on Vietnam's
immediate neighbors would be
profound. Thailand would al
most certainly seek a massive
and specific U.S. commitment.
Laos, by now well-versed in the
lessons of communist tactics in
a coalition government, would
undoubtedly seek assistance
from the United Nations in
guaranteeing its neutrality and,
failing that, would be put in a
position of choosing between ac
commodation with China and a
communist controlled Vietnam
on the one hand, and a substan

The governments of Malaysia,
Singapore, Australia, New Zea
land, the Philippines, states
which have enormous stakes in
the U.S. presence in Vietnam,

and which unanimously support
that presence, would be faced
with a destabilized situation re
quiring them to request further
direct guarantees and commit
ments from the United States.
These they would quickly re
ceive.
Threat in Korea
As I see it, the most profound
threat to world peace would then
arise in Korea, primarily as a
result of a North Korean mis
calculation of U.S. resolve to dis
charge its obligations. Recent
words and deeds emanating
from Pyongyang clearly support
this view. The "second front"
opened by the seizure of the USS
Pueblo, the attempt to assassi
nate President Park Chung Hee,
the rapid increase in border in
cidents, the stepped-up guerrilla
infiltration into South Korea,
and the total militarization of
North Korea and dramatic and
dangerous indicators that Kim
II Sung feels the time has come
to "liberate" South Korea. If
these actions have taken place
while the United States is still
in Vietnam, what can one as
sume will happen with allied
forces gone?
In short, with respect to Asia,
United States commitments
would not decrease but increase.
Defense spending would rise or,
at a minimum, remain at pres
ent levels, and as the number
of potential flashpoints in
creased, present personnel in
Vietnam would merely be rede
ployed to other areas and per
haps augmented.
New Defense Measures
Now, even if this gloomy pic
ture should not come to pass,
there is little reason to believe
that funds released by defusing
Vietnam would "come home" to
be spent for domestic purposes.
Pressing as our internal prob
lems are, any Administration

would be forced to make the cal
culation that the United States,
having proven itself unable to
meet a conventional military
challenge, must necessarily seek
security by other means.
That is to say, it would real
locate funds now being spent in
Vietnam for the purpose of
strengthening strategic offensive
and defensive capabilities. Un
der such circumstances, one
could predict with confidence
that we would, among other
measures, embark on a crash
program to deploy an ABM sys
tem, increase - the deliverable
megatonnage tn our nuclear
stockpiles, and* expand the capa
bilities of the fleet (including, of
course, undersea warfare capa
bilities).
Expanded Commitments
In the final analysis, a mili
tary defeat of the United States
in Vietnam and its subsequent
withdrawal will not turn the
country toward a course of iso
lationism, but will underscore
the enormous commitments it
has made to defend the world
from aggression.
Such a setback—indeed, catas
trophe—would bring into sharp
er focus the overriding issue of
our security and its relation to
America's role as a world power.
One stinging defeat, with its
concomitant blow to the image
which this country maintains of
itself and that which others
maintain, would not dispose the
American people to suffer fur
ther indignities.
A few years ago one eloquent
spokesman put it this way:
"I believe that there can be
only one possible defense pol
icy for the United States. It
can be expressed in one word.
That word is 'first' I do not
mean first, BUT. I do not

mean first, WHEN. I do not
mean first, IF. I mean first—
PERIOD. I mean first across
the board."
"Only then can we stop the
next war before it starts. Only
then can we prevent war by pre
paring for it. . . . The real ques
tion now is whether we are up
to the task—whether each and
every one of us is willing to
face the facts, to bear the bur
dens, to meet our dangers—and
to provide for them. . . . For we
are proud of our country and
we know what it can do with a
little leadership. But when you
are proud of something, you
don't let it deteriorate. You don't
let it stand still so others can
run over it."

structed Cold Warrior? Talis

While I do not foresee an im
pending military catastrophe in
Vietnam, it is useful to open dis
cussion of the matter, if only
because the formulation of pol
icy and strategy demands con
sideration of a range of options.
A nation deeply involved in mili
tary conflict must of necessity
be prepared to assess simultan
eously the consequences of vic
tory, stalemate, and defeat.
Coalition Government
Assuming, then, that the
United States were to suffer a
military defeat in Vietnam, one
can foresee the following conse
quences. The negotiated settle
ment would accept the partici
pation of the National Libera
tion Front in a coalition govern
ment, as advocated in the Na
tional Liberation Front's politi
cal program made public in
September of last year.
United States and allied forces
would withdraw from Vietnam
and the bulk of them would re
deploy to nearby areas.
Using a classical pattern of
coup d'etat within the frame
work of a "broad based" govern
ment, the communists would
gradually eliminate from all po
sitions of authority their tem
porary, tactical allies. They
would count on the world press
to sanctify the superficially "le
gal" means used.
At this point, it is to be ex
pected that public opinion would
be sufficiently conditioned and
anxious to accept these events
and, in judging the situation in
Vietnam, would not recall the
numerous prior applications of
"coalition government" tech
niques in, say, Eastern Europe.

The effects of a U.S. defeat
and withdrawal on Vietnam's
immediate neighbors would be
profound. Thailand would al
most certainly seek a massive
and specific U.S. commitment.
Laos, by now well-versed in the
lessons of communist tactics in
a coalition government, would
undoubtedly seek assistance
from the United Nations in
guaranteeing its neutrality and,
failing that, would be put in a
position of choosing between ac
commodation with China and a
communist controlled Vietnam
on the one hand, and a substan
tial allied presence on the other.
Should the United States find
itself forced to act on behalf of
Laos, it is to be expected that
the North Vietnamese, with Chi
nese (and probably Soviet)
backing, would charge the U.S.
with violating the 1962 Geneva
agreements, and would subse
quently intensify the "popular
struggle." Cambodia, always un
predictable under Prince Sihan
ouk, might well surprise every
one by declaring itself on the
non-Communist side. Sihanouk
is under no illusions concerning
his staying power in the face of
a totally hostile neighbor, and
in order to survive would be
given only the chance to throw
in his lot with a revamped alli
ance structure.
Just how long these new ar
rangements would last—if, in
deed, they would last at all—is
a matter of speculation. In any
event, moves toward realign
ment in either direction would
be made quickly, and could pro
duce tensions of the first magni
tude.
