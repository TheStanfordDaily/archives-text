# The 						Cities' Revolt
## 
### Max Lerner 
Ordinarily the question of who
does what to the garbage in
American cities would be a lo
cal issue. But two facts about
the nine-day strike of the New
York sanitation workers made it
a national issue.
One is the fact that the men
chiefly involved — Mayor John
Lindsay and Gov. Nelson Rocke
feller — are major Republican
contenders for national power.
The other is the fact that strikes
by public employes, including
teachers, transit workers, police,
firemen, hospital workers, sani
tation workers ,have strained not
only the treasuries of various
big American cities but also the
patience of the citizens.
Lindsay Recog^uzes
Of the two men, Lindsay came
closer than Rockefeller to recog
nizing the sense of outrage of
most Americans at being made
a patsy by groups who felt they
had them in power. Rockefeller
only repeated the weary formu
la of a behind-the-scenes deal
with the union and of letting
a no-strike law he had sponsored
(the Taylor Act) die of inaction.
But while Lindsay recognized
the mood of the people, he failed
to grasp its true meaning. By
asking in vain for the National
Guard to be called out, he in
voked against the sanitation
workers the one symbol of tra
ditional strong-anm strikebreak
ing which was bound to bring a

united labor movement to their
side, with the threat of a gener
al strike.
While Rockefeller can boast
that he got the garbage trucks
rolling again, there is a smell of
accommodation about the whole
episode that will not endear
Rockefeller to those who want
militant action on the problems
of the city. Lindsay, on the oth
er hand, emerges as the man
who wanted to stand up to the
unions.
Thus, the winner in the Rocke
feller-Lindsay maneuver, may
paradoxiaclly discover that he
has lost more than he won, the
loser that he was won more
than he lost.
In the end, the cities will find
these work-stoppages intolerable
when they break the fabric of
transport, communication, edu
cation or, health and, thus, leave
the city helpless. In the end,
there will have to be some sys
tem of labor - management
courts, with procedures for re
view, in the place of the current
system of anarchy-by-combat.
Passive, Inert
There is nothing a city hates
as much as to be passive and in
ert, a dead object acted upon
by forces outside. Lindsay miss
ed his real chance for leadership,
which was not to not to ask for
the National Guard, but to call
for brigades of voluntary citi
zens to organize the people in

every block and neighborhood
and get the garbage out.
There was every sign that they
were ready for such a call. They
could have recruited a whole ar
mada of vehicles to free the city
from its bondage of surplus
refuse until the strike could be
settled.
Instead of invoking the out
worn symbol of Calvin Coolidge
and the Boston police strike,
Lindsay could have invoked the
volunteer rescue operation at
Dunkirk or Gandhi's salt march
to the sea.
The people were eager for a
spark of leadership. They want
ed to form themselves into face
to-face units and get a sense of
their relation to the whole city
as an organism. They don't want
the city to become a dead arti
fact: they want it to be a living
community.
Someday a politician will
emerge who understands this.
When he does, the nation will
know it and embrace him.
