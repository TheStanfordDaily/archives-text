## Student Refutes Verba's Frat Analysis 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It is astounding that a Stan
ford political science professor
who apparently subscribes to
the ideals of logic and objectiv
ity in his critical studies should
make such an asinine analysis of
the compatibility of Stanford
fraternities with the University
as Sidney Verba did in his re
marks which appeared in Mon
day's Daily.
Professor Verba explains that
fraternities are not compatible
with the rest of the university
for four reasons: they are not
easily made coed; they are not
easily integrated with freshmen;
many academic departments
are reluctant to teach courses
in frat houses; and, most im
portantly, fraternities have sel
ective rush. Expounding on the
crucial last reason, Verba ex
plains, "Selection is based on
vague criteria and results in un
fortunate, non-diverse living
groups."
Even if these four observa
tions were valid, that they dem
onstrate the incompatibility of
fraternities with the rest of the
university is one of the most
blatant non-sequiturs The Daily
has printed all year.
Coed Argument
It is probably very arguable
that the fraternities are not
easily made coed (though frat
coed proposals have been made)
and that they are not easily
integrated with freshmen (In
deed, I can't imagine any fra
ternity baiter willing to expose
untutored freshmen to the seduc
tions of fraternity living.), but
that either coeducation or fresh
man integration represents
somehow an incontrovertible
ideal against which any resi
dence must justify its "com
patibility" for some administra
tor's or faculty-member's ap
proval is a totally absurd and
groundless contention.
By their own expression—rec-
ently recorded by Mr. Leland's
poll—a very large portion of the
student body desires precisely
the combination of coeducation
and freshman-integration afford
ed by fraternities.
That "many academic depart
ments are reluctant to teach
courses in frat houses" (a con
testable assertion) is an artifact

of pure bigotry, intolerance, and
narrow-mindedness; and to of
fer it as support for an attack
on fraternities is about like
holding the prejudices of South
ern racists against Negroes.
Vague Criteria ,
The criteria for selection by
most fraternities are necessarily
vague. Professor Verba objects
that they produce "unforunate,
nondiverse living groups."
The first point to be made
about that is that it's the fra
ternity's fortune and not Pro
fessor Verba's or anyone else's
— and it's not one damn bit
of their business. (Talk about
in loco parentis! Where're the
likes of Dave Harris?!)
Professor Verba himself con
cedes, "It's not worth disrupting
the university if enough men
want selection." If he can grasp
that notion, why can't the dis
tinguished liberal professor rec
ognize the right of fraternities
to live as they choose? It's
strange that values generally
granted the entire student body
aren't seen to extend to frater
nities. But what's good for the
goose just isn't always good
for the gander — especially at
Stanford.
On the essentially irrelevant
question of living-group diver
sity, I can speak only for, my
fraternity — Phi Sigma Kappa
— but I can honestly avow that
I cannot easily imagine a more
diverse group of people living
together than we have in this
house (and I was in integrated
Stern last year). I'm sure that
Phi Sigma Kappa isn't unique
with respect to house diversity.
I can only regret the grossly
distorted view of Stanford fra
ternities that Professor Verba
appears to accept.
The fraternities at Stanford
are at least as compatible with
the rest of the university as the
residential alternatives favored
by any other group of students.
In fact, the fraternities' ideal
of brotherhood, along with the
many lesser advantages of their
living situations, is a very posi
tive contribution to the process
of education and self-develop
ment in this university.

Selectivity Means Life
Continues On Campus
Editor, The Daily:
So many things of late have
filled my mind with questions re
garding the future of our Uni
versity and the paths which we
are presently following.
First, it's a study which
shows our campus to be "lone
ly' and devoid of "spirit." Then
it's a finding that selective rush
should be abandoned and that
fraternities should break their
national affiliations.
That same day in the San
Jose Mercury we see a photo of
a chariot race on the campus
and read of Greek Week being
hailed by the 24 Stanford fra
ternities.
On the one hand we are told
that the campus has become a
serious and somber place. On
the other we see that our selec
tive living groups still manage
to have a little fun once in a
while in spite of a tense world
situation and a society which ob
viously needs some recamping.
But, why eliminate selective
rush? Why eliminate that one
competitive element that will
confront a student the rest of
his life? Why not choose those
with whom you wish to live?
You certainly choose one and
other for off campus living....
why different on the campus?
Sanctuaries
Why should college campuses
become sanctuaries from com
petition and free choice, as long
as that choice is not based on
race, creed or color? Is it be
cause many of our liberal fac
ulty people live in cloister which
does not truly represent the ty
pical American way of life with
all of its competitive factors?
Have such things as tenure,
endowed chairs and vast fac
ulty benefits given some of those
who teach a stilted view of what
it is like in "the outside world."
From my standpoint as a
former Stanford fraternity man,
I hesistate to see the competi
tive factor of personal choice
removed from the system. Later
a student must compete for a
job, for membership in a club,
for acceptance in his neighbor
hood . . . yes, even, perhaps for
a mate!
In all competitive situations,

someone must be disappointed
and suffer damaged feelings.
This country was built on that
kind of spirit and determination
which gives a person strength
to rebound from such misfor
tune, to compete again and, very
likely to be successful. Let's
have a few disappointments.
Let's have more competition.
Then let's have a study showing
that spirit, friendliness, and per
haps, even a little sense of hu
mor has returned to the Stan
ford campus.

Coverage Is Unbiased
Editor, The Daily:
It has come to my attention
that the statement explaining
my reasons for seeking the
ASSU vice presidency, distribut
ed under the title "The Letter

has been interpreted as an accu
sation that The Daily is trying
to defeat my candidacy.
The Daily obviously has no
reason to oppose me. But at the
time the statement was mimeo
graphed there was almost no
coverage of any candidate and
I had no reason to believe that
any was forthcoming. I chose
the title to point to this fact and
to create interest in the vice
presidential race.
I believe that The Daily cov

fair and that my positions have
been reported accurately and ob
jectively. I want to thank The

garding the future of our Uni
versity and the paths which we
are presently following.
First, it's a study which
shows our campus to be "lone
ly' and devoid of "spirit." Then
it's a finding that selective rush
should be abandoned and that
fraternities should break their
national affiliations.
That same day in the San
Jose Mercury we see a photo of
a chariot race on the campus
and read of Greek Week being
hailed by the 24 Stanford fra
ternities.
On the one hand we are told
that the campus has become a
serious and somber place. On
the other we see that our selec
tive living groups still manage
to have a little fun once in a
while in spite of a tense world
situation and a society which ob
viously needs some recamping.
But, why eliminate selective
rush? Why eliminate that one
competitive element that will
confront a student the rest of
his life? Why not choose those
with whom you wish to live?
You certainly choose one and
other for off campus living....
why different on the campus?
Sanctuaries
Why should college campuses
become sanctuaries from com
petition and free choice, as long
as that choice is not based on
race, creed or color? Is it be
cause many of our liberal fac
ulty people live in cloister which
does not truly represent the ty
pical American way of life with
all of its competitive factors?
Have such things as tenure,
endowed chairs and vast fac
ulty benefits given some of those
who teach a stilted view of what
it is like in "the outside world."
From my standpoint as a
former Stanford fraternity man,
I hesistate to see the competi
tive factor of personal choice
removed from the system. Later
a student must compete for a
job, for membership in a club,
for acceptance in his neighbor
hood . . . yes, even, perhaps for
a mate!
In all competitive situations,

someone must be disappointed
and suffer damaged feelings.
This country was built on that

SCOTT P. KEENEY

Editor, The Daily:
It is astounding that a Stan
ford political science professor
who apparently subscribes to
the ideals of logic and objectiv
ity in his critical studies should
make such an asinine analysis of
the compatibility of Stanford
fraternities with the University
as Sidney Verba did in his re
marks which appeared in Mon
day's Daily.
Professor Verba explains that
fraternities are not compatible
with the rest of the university
for four reasons: they are not
easily made coed; they are not
easily integrated with freshmen;
many academic departments
are reluctant to teach courses
in frat houses; and, most im
portantly, fraternities have sel
ective rush. Expounding on the
crucial last reason, Verba ex
plains, "Selection is based on
vague criteria and results in un
fortunate, non-diverse living
groups."
Even if these four observa
tions were valid, that they dem
onstrate the incompatibility of
fraternities with the rest of the
university is one of the most
blatant non-sequiturs The Daily
has printed all year.
Coed Argument
It is probably very arguable
that the fraternities are not
easily made coed (though frat
coed proposals have been made)
and that they are not easily
integrated with freshmen (In
deed, I can't imagine any fra
ternity baiter willing to expose
untutored freshmen to the seduc
tions of fraternity living.), but
that either coeducation or fresh
man integration represents
somehow an incontrovertible
ideal against which any resi
dence must justify its "com
patibility" for some administra
tor's or faculty-member's ap
proval is a totally absurd and
groundless contention.
By their own expression—rec-
ently recorded by Mr. Leland's
poll—a very large portion of the
student body desires precisely
the combination of coeducation
and freshman-integration afford
ed by fraternities.
That "many academic depart
ments are reluctant to teach
courses in frat houses" (a con
testable assertion) is an artifact

of pure bigotry, intolerance, and
narrow-mindedness; and to of
fer it as support for an attack
on fraternities is about like
holding the prejudices of South
ern racists against Negroes.
Vague Criteria ,
The criteria for selection by
most fraternities are necessarily
vague. Professor Verba objects
that they produce "unforunate,
nondiverse living groups."
The first point to be made
about that is that it's the fra
ternity's fortune and not Pro
fessor Verba's or anyone else's
— and it's not one damn bit
of their business. (Talk about
in loco parentis! Where're the
likes of Dave Harris?!)
Professor Verba himself con
cedes, "It's not worth disrupting
the university if enough men
want selection." If he can grasp
that notion, why can't the dis
tinguished liberal professor rec
ognize the right of fraternities
to live as they choose? It's
strange that values generally
granted the entire student body
aren't seen to extend to frater
nities. But what's good for the
goose just isn't always good
for the gander — especially at
Stanford.
On the essentially irrelevant
question of living-group diver
sity, I can speak only for, my
fraternity — Phi Sigma Kappa
— but I can honestly avow that
I cannot easily imagine a more
diverse group of people living
together than we have in this
house (and I was in integrated
Stern last year). I'm sure that
Phi Sigma Kappa isn't unique
with respect to house diversity.
I can only regret the grossly
distorted view of Stanford fra
ternities that Professor Verba
appears to accept.
The fraternities at Stanford
are at least as compatible with
the rest of the university as the
residential alternatives favored
by any other group of students.
In fact, the fraternities' ideal
of brotherhood, along with the
many lesser advantages of their
living situations, is a very posi
tive contribution to the process
of education and self-develop
ment in this university.

Editor, The Daily:
It is astounding that a Stan
ford political science professor
who apparently subscribes to
the ideals of logic and objectiv
ity in his critical studies should
make such an asinine analysis of
the compatibility of Stanford
fraternities with the University
as Sidney Verba did in his re
marks which appeared in Mon
day's Daily.
Professor Verba explains that
fraternities are not compatible
with the rest of the university
for four reasons: they are not
easily made coed; they are not
easily integrated with freshmen;
many academic departments
are reluctant to teach courses
in frat houses; and, most im
portantly, fraternities have sel
ective rush. Expounding on the
crucial last reason, Verba ex
plains, "Selection is based on
vague criteria and results in un
fortunate, non-diverse living
groups."
Even if these four observa
tions were valid, that they dem
onstrate the incompatibility of
fraternities with the rest of the
university is one of the most
blatant non-sequiturs The Daily
has printed all year.
Coed Argument
It is probably very arguable
that the fraternities are not
easily made coed (though frat
coed proposals have been made)
and that they are not easily
integrated with freshmen (In
deed, I can't imagine any fra
ternity baiter willing to expose
untutored freshmen to the seduc
tions of fraternity living.), but
that either coeducation or fresh
man integration represents
somehow an incontrovertible
ideal against which any resi
dence must justify its "com
patibility" for some administra
tor's or faculty-member's ap
proval is a totally absurd and
groundless contention.
By their own expression—rec-
ently recorded by Mr. Leland's
poll—a very large portion of the
student body desires precisely
the combination of coeducation
and freshman-integration afford
ed by fraternities.
That "many academic depart
ments are reluctant to teach
courses in frat houses" (a con
testable assertion) is an artifact

of pure bigotry, intolerance, and
narrow-mindedness; and to of
fer it as support for an attack
on fraternities is about like
holding the prejudices of South
ern racists against Negroes.
Vague Criteria ,
The criteria for selection by
most fraternities are necessarily
vague. Professor Verba objects
that they produce "unforunate,
nondiverse living groups."
The first point to be made
about that is that it's the fra
ternity's fortune and not Pro
fessor Verba's or anyone else's
— and it's not one damn bit
of their business. (Talk about
in loco parentis! Where're the
likes of Dave Harris?!)
Professor Verba himself con
cedes, "It's not worth disrupting
the university if enough men
want selection." If he can grasp
that notion, why can't the dis
tinguished liberal professor rec
ognize the right of fraternities
to live as they choose? It's
strange that values generally
granted the entire student body
aren't seen to extend to frater
nities. But what's good for the
goose just isn't always good
for the gander — especially at
Stanford.
On the essentially irrelevant
question of living-group diver
sity, I can speak only for, my
fraternity — Phi Sigma Kappa
— but I can honestly avow that
I cannot easily imagine a more
diverse group of people living
together than we have in this
house (and I was in integrated
Stern last year). I'm sure that
Phi Sigma Kappa isn't unique
with respect to house diversity.
I can only regret the grossly
distorted view of Stanford fra
ternities that Professor Verba
appears to accept.
The fraternities at Stanford
are at least as compatible with
the rest of the university as the
residential alternatives favored
by any other group of students.
In fact, the fraternities' ideal
of brotherhood, along with the
many lesser advantages of their
living situations, is a very posi
tive contribution to the process
of education and self-develop
ment in this university.

Selectivity Means Life
Continues On Campus
Editor, The Daily:
So many things of late have
filled my mind with questions re
garding the future of our Uni
versity and the paths which we
are presently following.
First, it's a study which
shows our campus to be "lone
ly' and devoid of "spirit." Then
it's a finding that selective rush
should be abandoned and that
fraternities should break their
national affiliations.
That same day in the San
Jose Mercury we see a photo of
a chariot race on the campus
and read of Greek Week being
hailed by the 24 Stanford fra
ternities.
On the one hand we are told
that the campus has become a
serious and somber place. On
the other we see that our selec
tive living groups still manage
to have a little fun once in a
while in spite of a tense world
situation and a society which ob
viously needs some recamping.
But, why eliminate selective
rush? Why eliminate that one
competitive element that will
confront a student the rest of
his life? Why not choose those
with whom you wish to live?
You certainly choose one and
other for off campus living....
why different on the campus?
Sanctuaries
Why should college campuses
become sanctuaries from com
petition and free choice, as long
as that choice is not based on
race, creed or color? Is it be
cause many of our liberal fac
ulty people live in cloister which
does not truly represent the ty
pical American way of life with
all of its competitive factors?
Have such things as tenure,
endowed chairs and vast fac
ulty benefits given some of those
who teach a stilted view of what
it is like in "the outside world."
From my standpoint as a
former Stanford fraternity man,
I hesistate to see the competi
tive factor of personal choice
removed from the system. Later
a student must compete for a
job, for membership in a club,
for acceptance in his neighbor
hood . . . yes, even, perhaps for
a mate!
In all competitive situations,

someone must be disappointed
and suffer damaged feelings.
This country was built on that
kind of spirit and determination
which gives a person strength
to rebound from such misfor
tune, to compete again and, very
likely to be successful. Let's
have a few disappointments.
Let's have more competition.
Then let's have a study showing
that spirit, friendliness, and per
haps, even a little sense of hu
mor has returned to the Stan
ford campus.

The fraternities at Stanford
are at least as compatible with
the rest of the university as the
residential alternatives favored
by any other group of students.
In fact, the fraternities' ideal
of brotherhood, along with the

Selectivity Means Life
Continues On Campus
Editor, The Daily:
So many things of late have
filled my mind with questions re
garding the future of our Uni
versity and the paths which we
are presently following.
First, it's a study which
shows our campus to be "lone
ly' and devoid of "spirit." Then
it's a finding that selective rush
should be abandoned and that
fraternities should break their
national affiliations.
That same day in the San
Jose Mercury we see a photo of
a chariot race on the campus
and read of Greek Week being
hailed by the 24 Stanford fra
ternities.
On the one hand we are told
that the campus has become a
serious and somber place. On
the other we see that our selec
tive living groups still manage
to have a little fun once in a
while in spite of a tense world
situation and a society which ob
viously needs some recamping.
But, why eliminate selective
rush? Why eliminate that one
competitive element that will
confront a student the rest of
his life? Why not choose those
with whom you wish to live?
You certainly choose one and
other for off campus living....
why different on the campus?
Sanctuaries
Why should college campuses
become sanctuaries from com
petition and free choice, as long
as that choice is not based on
race, creed or color? Is it be
cause many of our liberal fac
ulty people live in cloister which
does not truly represent the ty
pical American way of life with
all of its competitive factors?
Have such things as tenure,
endowed chairs and vast fac
ulty benefits given some of those
who teach a stilted view of what
it is like in "the outside world."
From my standpoint as a
former Stanford fraternity man,
I hesistate to see the competi
tive factor of personal choice
removed from the system. Later
a student must compete for a
job, for membership in a club,
for acceptance in his neighbor
hood . . . yes, even, perhaps for
a mate!
In all competitive situations,

someone must be disappointed
and suffer damaged feelings.
This country was built on that
kind of spirit and determination
which gives a person strength
to rebound from such misfor
tune, to compete again and, very
likely to be successful. Let's
have a few disappointments.
Let's have more competition.
Then let's have a study showing
that spirit, friendliness, and per
haps, even a little sense of hu
mor has returned to the Stan

SCOTT P. KEENEY
Sophomore
Editor, The Daily:
It is astounding that a Stan
ford political science professor
who apparently subscribes to
the ideals of logic and objectiv
ity in his critical studies should
make such an asinine analysis of
the compatibility of Stanford
fraternities with the University
as Sidney Verba did in his re
marks which appeared in Mon
day's Daily.
Professor Verba explains that
fraternities are not compatible
with the rest of the university
for four reasons: they are not
easily made coed; they are not
easily integrated with freshmen;
many academic departments
are reluctant to teach courses
in frat houses; and, most im
portantly, fraternities have sel
ective rush. Expounding on the
crucial last reason, Verba ex
plains, "Selection is based on
vague criteria and results in un
fortunate, non-diverse living
groups."
Even if these four observa
tions were valid, that they dem
onstrate the incompatibility of
fraternities with the rest of the
university is one of the most
blatant non-sequiturs The Daily
has printed all year.
Coed Argument
It is probably very arguable
that the fraternities are not
easily made coed (though frat
coed proposals have been made)
and that they are not easily
integrated with freshmen (In
deed, I can't imagine any fra
ternity baiter willing to expose
untutored freshmen to the seduc
tions of fraternity living.), but
that either coeducation or fresh
man integration represents
somehow an incontrovertible
ideal against which any resi
dence must justify its "com
patibility" for some administra
tor's or faculty-member's ap
proval is a totally absurd and
groundless contention.
By their own expression—rec-
ently recorded by Mr. Leland's
poll—a very large portion of the
student body desires precisely
the combination of coeducation
and freshman-integration afford
ed by fraternities.
That "many academic depart
ments are reluctant to teach
courses in frat houses" (a con
testable assertion) is an artifact

of pure bigotry, intolerance, and
narrow-mindedness; and to of
fer it as support for an attack
on fraternities is about like
holding the prejudices of South
ern racists against Negroes.
Vague Criteria ,
The criteria for selection by
most fraternities are necessarily
vague. Professor Verba objects
that they produce "unforunate,
nondiverse living groups."
The first point to be made
about that is that it's the fra
ternity's fortune and not Pro
fessor Verba's or anyone else's
— and it's not one damn bit
of their business. (Talk about
in loco parentis! Where're the
likes of Dave Harris?!)
Professor Verba himself con
cedes, "It's not worth disrupting
the university if enough men
want selection." If he can grasp
that notion, why can't the dis
tinguished liberal professor rec
ognize the right of fraternities
to live as they choose? It's
strange that values generally
granted the entire student body
aren't seen to extend to frater
nities. But what's good for the
goose just isn't always good
for the gander — especially at
Stanford.
On the essentially irrelevant
question of living-group diver
sity, I can speak only for, my
fraternity — Phi Sigma Kappa
— but I can honestly avow that
I cannot easily imagine a more
diverse group of people living
together than we have in this
house (and I was in integrated
Stern last year). I'm sure that
Phi Sigma Kappa isn't unique
with respect to house diversity.
I can only regret the grossly
distorted view of Stanford fra
ternities that Professor Verba
appears to accept.
The fraternities at Stanford
are at least as compatible with
the rest of the university as the
residential alternatives favored
by any other group of students.

SCOTT P. KEENEY
Sophomore
Editor, The Daily:
It is astounding that a Stan
ford political science professor
who apparently subscribes to
the ideals of logic and objectiv
ity in his critical studies should
make such an asinine analysis of
the compatibility of Stanford
fraternities with the University
as Sidney Verba did in his re
marks which appeared in Mon
day's Daily.
Professor Verba explains that
fraternities are not compatible
with the rest of the university
for four reasons: they are not
easily made coed; they are not
easily integrated with freshmen;
many academic departments
are reluctant to teach courses
in frat houses; and, most im
portantly, fraternities have sel
ective rush. Expounding on the
crucial last reason, Verba ex
plains, "Selection is based on
vague criteria and results in un
fortunate, non-diverse living
groups."
Even if these four observa
tions were valid, that they dem
onstrate the incompatibility of
fraternities with the rest of the
university is one of the most
blatant non-sequiturs The Daily
has printed all year.
Coed Argument
It is probably very arguable
that the fraternities are not
easily made coed (though frat
coed proposals have been made)
and that they are not easily
integrated with freshmen (In
deed, I can't imagine any fra
ternity baiter willing to expose
untutored freshmen to the seduc
tions of fraternity living.), but
that either coeducation or fresh
man integration represents
somehow an incontrovertible
ideal against which any resi
dence must justify its "com
patibility" for some administra
tor's or faculty-member's ap
proval is a totally absurd and
groundless contention.
By their own expression—rec-
ently recorded by Mr. Leland's
poll—a very large portion of the
student body desires precisely
the combination of coeducation
and freshman-integration afford
ed by fraternities.
That "many academic depart
ments are reluctant to teach
courses in frat houses" (a con
testable assertion) is an artifact

of pure bigotry, intolerance, and
narrow-mindedness; and to of
fer it as support for an attack
on fraternities is about like
holding the prejudices of South
ern racists against Negroes.
Vague Criteria ,
The criteria for selection by
most fraternities are necessarily
vague. Professor Verba objects
that they produce "unforunate,
nondiverse living groups."
The first point to be made
about that is that it's the fra
ternity's fortune and not Pro
fessor Verba's or anyone else's
— and it's not one damn bit
of their business. (Talk about
in loco parentis! Where're the
likes of Dave Harris?!)
Professor Verba himself con
cedes, "It's not worth disrupting
the university if enough men
want selection." If he can grasp
that notion, why can't the dis
tinguished liberal professor rec
ognize the right of fraternities
to live as they choose? It's
strange that values generally
granted the entire student body
aren't seen to extend to frater
nities. But what's good for the
goose just isn't always good
for the gander — especially at
Stanford.
On the essentially irrelevant
question of living-group diver
sity, I can speak only for, my
fraternity — Phi Sigma Kappa
— but I can honestly avow that
I cannot easily imagine a more
diverse group of people living
together than we have in this
house (and I was in integrated
Stern last year). I'm sure that
Phi Sigma Kappa isn't unique
with respect to house diversity.
I can only regret the grossly
distorted view of Stanford fra
ternities that Professor Verba
appears to accept.
The fraternities at Stanford
are at least as compatible with
the rest of the university as the
residential alternatives favored
by any other group of students.
In fact, the fraternities' ideal
of brotherhood, along with the
many lesser advantages of their
living situations, is a very posi
tive contribution to the process
of education and self-develop
ment in this university.

Selectivity Means Life
Continues On Campus
Editor, The Daily:
So many things of late have
filled my mind with questions re
garding the future of our Uni
versity and the paths which we
are presently following.
First, it's a study which
shows our campus to be "lone
ly' and devoid of "spirit." Then
it's a finding that selective rush
should be abandoned and that
fraternities should break their
national affiliations.
That same day in the San
Jose Mercury we see a photo of
a chariot race on the campus
and read of Greek Week being
hailed by the 24 Stanford fra
ternities.
On the one hand we are told
that the campus has become a
serious and somber place. On
the other we see that our selec
tive living groups still manage
to have a little fun once in a
while in spite of a tense world
situation and a society which ob
viously needs some recamping.
But, why eliminate selective
rush? Why eliminate that one
competitive element that will
confront a student the rest of
his life? Why not choose those
with whom you wish to live?
You certainly choose one and
other for off campus living....
why different on the campus?
Sanctuaries
Why should college campuses
become sanctuaries from com
petition and free choice, as long
as that choice is not based on
race, creed or color? Is it be
cause many of our liberal fac
ulty people live in cloister which
does not truly represent the ty
pical American way of life with
all of its competitive factors?
Have such things as tenure,
endowed chairs and vast fac
ulty benefits given some of those
who teach a stilted view of what
it is like in "the outside world."
From my standpoint as a
former Stanford fraternity man,
I hesistate to see the competi
tive factor of personal choice
removed from the system. Later
a student must compete for a
job, for membership in a club,
for acceptance in his neighbor
hood . . . yes, even, perhaps for
a mate!
In all competitive situations,

someone must be disappointed
and suffer damaged feelings.
This country was built on that
kind of spirit and determination
which gives a person strength
to rebound from such misfor
tune, to compete again and, very
likely to be successful. Let's
have a few disappointments.
Let's have more competition.
Then let's have a study showing
that spirit, friendliness, and per
haps, even a little sense of hu
mor has returned to the Stan
ford campus.

Weatherup Maintains
Coverage Is Unbiased
Editor, The Daily:
It has come to my attention
that the statement explaining
my reasons for seeking the
ASSU vice presidency, distribut
ed under the title "The Letter
The Daily Refused to Print,"
has been interpreted as an accu
sation that The Daily is trying
to defeat my candidacy.
The Daily obviously has no
reason to oppose me. But at the
time the statement was mimeo
graphed there was almost no
coverage of any candidate and
I had no reason to believe that
any was forthcoming. I chose
the title to point to this fact and
to create interest in the vice
presidential race.
I believe that The Daily cov
erage of the campaign has been
fair and that my positions have
been reported accurately and ob
jectively. I want to thank The
Daily reporters and to apologize
for any misunderstandings.
