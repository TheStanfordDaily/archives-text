# Why Men Grow Them
## Beard Psychology 
### JEFF ROBISON 
With all the cosmetic accou
terments used by women these
days, man seems naked by com
parison. Until recently, in fact,
the self-respecting male could
do little more than brush his
teeth with "sex appeal" and
hope for the best.
Now, though, with women lib
erated and men babbling in awe
at what they have wrought, ema
sculation is the order of the day.
It has become fashionable, for
example, for a man to have his
hair sculptured, sprayed, and
scented in special beauty par
lors that promise to soothe and
smooth even the roughest mas
culine egos. And should ever the
latest Paris sartorial styles
spread west, it is a foregone con
clusion Finocchio's would be
taken over by Saturday night
professional wrestling.
Fortunately, there is still hope.
But, as is so often the case with
social problems of particular im
port, the solution lies within the
concerned man: it is his beard.
Anyone contemplating such
drastic inaction, however,
should be advised of the poten
tial hazards as well as the ad
vantages. To that end I've
gathered the experiences of
several veterans, among
them bearded Stanford psy
chology graduate student Wil
liam Newman.
Concerning the history of
beards, Newman notes that "At
one time not to have a beard
was really a special thing. But
I think as society got more ad
vanced, people began shaving
for two reasons: first, for health
purposes. Beards infested with
parasites and other stuff were
not uncommon."
"Secondly,' 'he continued, "as
man fell more and more under
the influence of his religion, he
felt it increasingly urgent and
important to distinguish himself
from the lower animals."
Newman observes that differ
ent segments of American so
ciety view beards in different
ways: 'T'he University commu
nity fosters in some sense the
growth of hair and beards —
they're more likely to judge you
on what you have to say."
"On the other hand," he said,
"when I worked in the Credit
Bureau of The New York Times
it was insufferable. Everybody
had a cute remark."
Addressing himself to the
ancient problem of facial irri
tation during the first weeks
of beard growth, Newman of
ers a tip. "I've found that any
canned aerosol medication, like
Johnson's Medi-Quick, has a
pain killer In it. If you spray
It on, it gives you up to four
hours of wonderful relief."
After a thoughtful pause, the
psychologist said "People get
very defensive about beards, be
cause they're such a big invest
ment in time. There's a lot of
dissonance to be overcome.
"But once you have it grown,
it gives you something to play
around with besides combing
your hair. It's a great ritual for
men — it's the only thing we
have left."
Newman's experiences are not
unique. So universal are they,
in fact, that several principles of
beard growing may be confident
ly stated:
First, beards are not the re
sult of some abstruse atavistic
impulse; rather they are most
often the consequence of a few
day's sloth and an ensuing curio
sity.
David Heil, a red-bearded se
nior, speaks in effect for the ma
jority: "I just forgot to shave
for three or four days. Then I
decided to see what I looked
like with one. There was no ideo
logical commitment."
Secondly, a fully • grown
beard opens new social vistas.
"I was much more accepted

in non-conformist circles," ex
claims Bruce Benton, a senior
in political science. "One week
I went skiing and got invited
to three pot parties. People
found it very easy to talk to
me all of a sudden."
Comments on girls' reactions
to beards, it should be added,
range from "extremely positive"
to "Girls? They go crazy most
of them. Have you ever had your
beard nibbled by an excited wom
an?"
Third, a new beard can have
adverse effects on family har
mony. Parental harassment, for
instance, usually takes the form
of a subtle but incessant per
secution. Benton tells of one
such episode. "My father abso
lutely abhors beards. He con
nects them with delinquents and
rebellion. One Christmas I went
home only to be introduced to
all his friends as 'my son Abe
Lincoln Benton.' "
Dan Hirschberg's confronta
tion was less subtle. "One year
ago at a New Year's Eve party
the parents of a girl I knew told
me what a fine and decent guy
they thought I was," the fero
ciously black-bearded senior
said. "They told me to be sure
to come by and see her some
time. The next summer, after
I'd grown my beard, they refus
de to let her go out with me."
And fourth, it is as impossible
to find anyone who has kept his

beard for more than a few
months at a time as it is to dis
cover one who has regretted it.
Excuses cover mental anguish
at home, senior pictures, and
employment prejudice, but as to
the actual shaving most seem to
agree with psychologist New
man.
"It was an accident," he pro
tested, "a process of erosion.
One morning I started to trim
the right side of my face. Then
I had to even up the left side.
Finally I was down to a Van
Dyke, then a handle bar mus
tache. That lasted a little while,
but my wife refused to be seen
in public with me. Then I cut
it all off."
The revelation of seeing
one's face again, adds Ben
ton, can be startling: "I looked
12 years younger. I felt naked,
and my face looked whiter
and rounder than I'd ever
imagined it."
But if it is true that shaving
is inevitable, it is equally cer
tain that, once experienced, the
beard is not easily forgotten.
Confides one senior, "You
struggle through it for a month,
and when it finally gets to look
good you have to shave it off
for some reason. I did it for
fun, and it was fun. I think I'll
do it again."
Therein may lie man's salva
tion as a distince breed, for no
woman can say as much.

Dyke, then a handle bar mus
tache. That lasted a little while,
but my wife refused to be seen
in public with me. Then I cut
it all off."
The revelation of seeing
one's face again, adds Ben
ton, can be startling: "I looked
12 years younger. I felt naked,
and my face looked whiter
and rounder than I'd ever
imagined it."
But if it is true that shaving
is inevitable, it is equally cer
tain that, once experienced, the
beard is not easily forgotten.
Confides one senior, "You
struggle through it for a month,
and when it finally gets to look
good you have to shave it off
for some reason. I did it for
fun, and it was fun. I think I'll
do it again."
Therein may lie man's salva
tion as a distince breed, for no
woman can say as much.

WHY is this man wearing a beard? See story below.
With all the cosmetic accou
terments used by women these
days, man seems naked by com
parison. Until recently, in fact,
the self-respecting male could
do little more than brush his
teeth with "sex appeal" and
hope for the best.
Now, though, with women lib
erated and men babbling in awe
at what they have wrought, ema
sculation is the order of the day.
It has become fashionable, for
example, for a man to have his
hair sculptured, sprayed, and
scented in special beauty par
lors that promise to soothe and
smooth even the roughest mas
culine egos. And should ever the
latest Paris sartorial styles
spread west, it is a foregone con
clusion Finocchio's would be
taken over by Saturday night
professional wrestling.
Fortunately, there is still hope.
But, as is so often the case with
social problems of particular im
port, the solution lies within the
concerned man: it is his beard.
Anyone contemplating such
drastic inaction, however,
should be advised of the poten
tial hazards as well as the ad
vantages. To that end I've
gathered the experiences of
several veterans, among
them bearded Stanford psy
chology graduate student Wil
liam Newman.
Concerning the history of
beards, Newman notes that "At
one time not to have a beard
was really a special thing. But
I think as society got more ad
vanced, people began shaving
for two reasons: first, for health
purposes. Beards infested with
parasites and other stuff were
not uncommon."
"Secondly,' 'he continued, "as
man fell more and more under
the influence of his religion, he
felt it increasingly urgent and
important to distinguish himself
from the lower animals."
Newman observes that differ
ent segments of American so
ciety view beards in different
ways: 'T'he University commu
nity fosters in some sense the
growth of hair and beards —
they're more likely to judge you
on what you have to say."
"On the other hand," he said,
"when I worked in the Credit
Bureau of The New York Times
it was insufferable. Everybody
had a cute remark."
Addressing himself to the
ancient problem of facial irri
tation during the first weeks
of beard growth, Newman of
ers a tip. "I've found that any
canned aerosol medication, like
Johnson's Medi-Quick, has a
pain killer In it. If you spray
It on, it gives you up to four
hours of wonderful relief."
After a thoughtful pause, the
psychologist said "People get
very defensive about beards, be
cause they're such a big invest
ment in time. There's a lot of
dissonance to be overcome.
"But once you have it grown,
it gives you something to play
around with besides combing
your hair. It's a great ritual for
men — it's the only thing we
have left."
Newman's experiences are not
unique. So universal are they,
in fact, that several principles of
beard growing may be confident
ly stated:
First, beards are not the re
sult of some abstruse atavistic
impulse; rather they are most
often the consequence of a few
day's sloth and an ensuing curio
sity.
David Heil, a red-bearded se
nior, speaks in effect for the ma
jority: "I just forgot to shave
for three or four days. Then I
decided to see what I looked
like with one. There was no ideo
logical commitment."
Secondly, a fully • grown
beard opens new social vistas.
"I was much more accepted

in non-conformist circles," ex
claims Bruce Benton, a senior
in political science. "One week
I went skiing and got invited
to three pot parties. People
found it very easy to talk to
me all of a sudden."
Comments on girls' reactions
to beards, it should be added,
range from "extremely positive"
to "Girls? They go crazy most
of them. Have you ever had your
beard nibbled by an excited wom
an?"
Third, a new beard can have
adverse effects on family har
mony. Parental harassment, for
instance, usually takes the form
of a subtle but incessant per
secution. Benton tells of one
such episode. "My father abso
lutely abhors beards. He con
nects them with delinquents and
rebellion. One Christmas I went
home only to be introduced to
all his friends as 'my son Abe
Lincoln Benton.' "
Dan Hirschberg's confronta
tion was less subtle. "One year
ago at a New Year's Eve party
the parents of a girl I knew told
me what a fine and decent guy
they thought I was," the fero
ciously black-bearded senior
said. "They told me to be sure
to come by and see her some
time. The next summer, after
I'd grown my beard, they refus
de to let her go out with me."
And fourth, it is as impossible
to find anyone who has kept his

beard for more than a few
months at a time as it is to dis
cover one who has regretted it.
Excuses cover mental anguish
at home, senior pictures, and
employment prejudice, but as to
the actual shaving most seem to
agree with psychologist New
man.
"It was an accident," he pro
tested, "a process of erosion.
One morning I started to trim
the right side of my face. Then
I had to even up the left side.
Finally I was down to a Van
Dyke, then a handle bar mus
tache. That lasted a little while,
but my wife refused to be seen

tion was less subtle. "One year
ago at a New Year's Eve party
the parents of a girl I knew told
me what a fine and decent guy
they thought I was," the fero
ciously black-bearded senior
said. "They told me to be sure
to come by and see her some
time. The next summer, after
I'd grown my beard, they refus
de to let her go out with me."
And fourth, it is as impossible
to find anyone who has kept his

beard for more than a few
months at a time as it is to dis
cover one who has regretted it.
Excuses cover mental anguish
at home, senior pictures, and
employment prejudice, but as to
the actual shaving most seem to
agree with psychologist New
man.
"It was an accident," he pro
tested, "a process of erosion.
One morning I started to trim
the right side of my face. Then
I had to even up the left side.
Finally I was down to a Van
Dyke, then a handle bar mus
tache. That lasted a little while,
but my wife refused to be seen
in public with me. Then I cut
it all off."
The revelation of seeing
one's face again, adds Ben
ton, can be startling: "I looked
12 years younger. I felt naked,
and my face looked whiter
and rounder than I'd ever
imagined it."
But if it is true that shaving
is inevitable, it is equally cer
tain that, once experienced, the
beard is not easily forgotten.
Confides one senior, "You
struggle through it for a month,
and when it finally gets to look
good you have to shave it off
for some reason. I did it for
fun, and it was fun. I think I'll
do it again."
Therein may lie man's salva
tion as a distince breed, for no
woman can say as much.

WHY is this man wearing a beard? See story below.
With all the cosmetic accou
terments used by women these
days, man seems naked by com
parison. Until recently, in fact,
the self-respecting male could
do little more than brush his
teeth with "sex appeal" and
hope for the best.
Now, though, with women lib
erated and men babbling in awe
at what they have wrought, ema
sculation is the order of the day.
It has become fashionable, for
example, for a man to have his
hair sculptured, sprayed, and
scented in special beauty par
lors that promise to soothe and
smooth even the roughest mas
culine egos. And should ever the
latest Paris sartorial styles
spread west, it is a foregone con
clusion Finocchio's would be
taken over by Saturday night
professional wrestling.
Fortunately, there is still hope.
But, as is so often the case with
social problems of particular im
port, the solution lies within the
concerned man: it is his beard.
Anyone contemplating such
drastic inaction, however,
should be advised of the poten
tial hazards as well as the ad
vantages. To that end I've
gathered the experiences of
several veterans, among
them bearded Stanford psy
chology graduate student Wil
liam Newman.
Concerning the history of
beards, Newman notes that "At
one time not to have a beard
was really a special thing. But
I think as society got more ad
vanced, people began shaving
for two reasons: first, for health
purposes. Beards infested with
parasites and other stuff were
not uncommon."
"Secondly,' 'he continued, "as
man fell more and more under
the influence of his religion, he
felt it increasingly urgent and
important to distinguish himself
from the lower animals."
Newman observes that differ
ent segments of American so
ciety view beards in different
ways: 'T'he University commu
nity fosters in some sense the
growth of hair and beards —
they're more likely to judge you
on what you have to say."
"On the other hand," he said,
"when I worked in the Credit
Bureau of The New York Times
it was insufferable. Everybody
had a cute remark."
Addressing himself to the
ancient problem of facial irri
tation during the first weeks
of beard growth, Newman of
ers a tip. "I've found that any
canned aerosol medication, like
Johnson's Medi-Quick, has a
pain killer In it. If you spray
It on, it gives you up to four
hours of wonderful relief."
After a thoughtful pause, the
psychologist said "People get
very defensive about beards, be
cause they're such a big invest
ment in time. There's a lot of
dissonance to be overcome.
"But once you have it grown,
it gives you something to play
around with besides combing
your hair. It's a great ritual for
men — it's the only thing we
have left."
Newman's experiences are not
unique. So universal are they,
in fact, that several principles of
beard growing may be confident
ly stated:
First, beards are not the re
sult of some abstruse atavistic
impulse; rather they are most
often the consequence of a few
day's sloth and an ensuing curio
sity.
David Heil, a red-bearded se
nior, speaks in effect for the ma
jority: "I just forgot to shave
for three or four days. Then I
decided to see what I looked
like with one. There was no ideo
logical commitment."
Secondly, a fully • grown
beard opens new social vistas.
"I was much more accepted

in non-conformist circles," ex
claims Bruce Benton, a senior
in political science. "One week
I went skiing and got invited
to three pot parties. People
found it very easy to talk to
me all of a sudden."
Comments on girls' reactions
to beards, it should be added,
range from "extremely positive"
to "Girls? They go crazy most
of them. Have you ever had your
beard nibbled by an excited wom
an?"
Third, a new beard can have
adverse effects on family har
mony. Parental harassment, for
instance, usually takes the form
of a subtle but incessant per
secution. Benton tells of one
such episode. "My father abso
lutely abhors beards. He con
nects them with delinquents and
rebellion. One Christmas I went
home only to be introduced to
all his friends as 'my son Abe
Lincoln Benton.' "
Dan Hirschberg's confronta

"I was much more accepted

in non-conformist circles," ex
claims Bruce Benton, a senior
in political science. "One week
I went skiing and got invited
to three pot parties. People
found it very easy to talk to
me all of a sudden."
Comments on girls' reactions
to beards, it should be added,
range from "extremely positive"
to "Girls? They go crazy most
of them. Have you ever had your
beard nibbled by an excited wom
an?"
Third, a new beard can have
adverse effects on family har
mony. Parental harassment, for
instance, usually takes the form
of a subtle but incessant per
secution. Benton tells of one
such episode. "My father abso
lutely abhors beards. He con
nects them with delinquents and
rebellion. One Christmas I went
home only to be introduced to
all his friends as 'my son Abe
Lincoln Benton.' "
Dan Hirschberg's confronta
tion was less subtle. "One year
ago at a New Year's Eve party
the parents of a girl I knew told
me what a fine and decent guy
they thought I was," the fero
ciously black-bearded senior
said. "They told me to be sure
to come by and see her some
time. The next summer, after
I'd grown my beard, they refus
de to let her go out with me."
And fourth, it is as impossible
to find anyone who has kept his

beard for more than a few
months at a time as it is to dis
cover one who has regretted it.
Excuses cover mental anguish
at home, senior pictures, and
employment prejudice, but as to
the actual shaving most seem to
agree with psychologist New
man.
"It was an accident," he pro
tested, "a process of erosion.
One morning I started to trim
the right side of my face. Then
I had to even up the left side.
Finally I was down to a Van
Dyke, then a handle bar mus
tache. That lasted a little while,
but my wife refused to be seen
in public with me. Then I cut
it all off."
The revelation of seeing
one's face again, adds Ben
ton, can be startling: "I looked
12 years younger. I felt naked,
and my face looked whiter
and rounder than I'd ever
imagined it."
But if it is true that shaving
is inevitable, it is equally cer
tain that, once experienced, the
beard is not easily forgotten.
Confides one senior, "You
struggle through it for a month,
and when it finally gets to look
good you have to shave it off
for some reason. I did it for
fun, and it was fun. I think I'll
do it again."
Therein may lie man's salva
tion as a distince breed, for no
woman can say as much.
