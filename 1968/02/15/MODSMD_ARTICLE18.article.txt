# Industry Is Social Role
## Businessmen Debate 
### NICK SELBY 
The business of business, ac
cording to Arnold Maremont,
president of Maremont Corp. of
Chicago, is to make money, and
not to assume responsibility for
the social welfare of the coun
try.
This viewpoint, according to
Bart Lytton, president of Lytton
Savings, shows Maremont to be
"the missing link between the
Cro-Magnon and modern man,
. . . the link between the robber
barons of the nineteenth cen
tury and today's businessman."
Lytton's comments, delivered
in jest, highlighted a debate be
tween the two men in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium yesterday.
Maremont stressed the idea
that corporations are not in
dividuals, and exist under
legal statutes to make money
for shareholders. "The citizen

ry and/or their government
should concern themselves
with social welfare," he said.
Maremont said he was upset
by the current tendency of Presi
dent Johnson to call in business
leaders to solve social problems.
Endowing business leaders, who
may have no competence to
spend large sums of money to
help society, is a mistake," he
said.
Lytton, on the other hand,
stressed that modern corpora
tions were citizens which had
to contribute to social welfare
if they wanted to survive.
Self-regulation of business to
ward the public good is a mere
extension of self-regulation of
the individual working for soci
ety," Lytton said. Business will
find itself being totally regu
lated by the government if cor
porations don't show themselves
to be mature individuals."
Maremont characterized self
regulation as a subterfuge
which simply does not work. Ex
ploiters will always take ad
vantage of self-regulation and
force public involvement." He
cited the self-regulation of cig
arette companies in changing
their advertisements as one ex
ample of the failure of self
regulation.

Lytton counted that the
United States Is not only on
the brink of a revolution, but
Is in one already. We are com
peting with militant black na
tionalists for the rest of Negro
society. We either Improve
their life, without token prom
ises, or we lose them to the
black nationalists," Lytton
claimed.
Lytton emphatically pounded
his fist as he said, "The big ques
tion, right here at home, is
whether the United States can
be saved. If we lose the Negro
community to the black nation
alists, we lose democracy and
become a police state."
In answer to a question, Mare
mont claimed Ford Motor Com
pany's decision to hire 6,000 De
troit ghetto residents and adopt
new hiring procedures within
the ghetto, was not an act of
social welfare.
Lytton agreed that making
money was obviously the major
concern of business. 'But," he
questioned, "are we making
money for this quarter or for
years to come?"
"The job of the speculator is
to make money quickly. But I
think you will find that those
companies who have done most
for their community prosper the
most," he concluded.
