# Expert Says
## Coed Housing Alters Dating Games 
### 
Coeducational housing will
transform the traditional rating
mating game on campus, a Stan
ford expert predicted Tuesday.
"If this new pattern persists
and spreads, it could lead to pro
found alterations in marital pat
terns," Joseph Katz of the Insti
tute for the Study of Human
Problems told a Century 21 lec
ture series audience of 100.
It may already have led to
"at least a partial moratorium
on sex," he hypothesized. Pro
viding men and women students
with shared dining and social fa
cilities and common academic
programs may lead them to re
gard each other "more like
brothers and sisters."
A major contributor to a
study on "Sex and the College
Student," published by the
Group for the Advancement of
Psychiatry, Katz recently com
pleted a four-year study of stu
dent development at Stanford
and the University of California
at Berkeley.
By placing more emphasis
on acquaintances and shared
activities, he explained, coed
ucational housing avoids "over
idealization" of the opposite

sex and a good deal of the
"mutual teasing and destruc
tive behavior" characteristic
of campus dating.
The long-range result may be
a "prpfound modification" —
and strengthening — of mar
riage.
New life styles now apparent
among students "hold the prom
ise of a psychologically more
abundant life in the future,"
Katz added.
Both the organization man and
the drugged social drop-out are
falling out of style.
"Drugs will pretty soon phase
out for students, especially at
places like Stanford, because
they have failed to fulfill their
promise," he explained.
"This year there's more talk
about encounter groups than
drugs. There's a searching and
a shift.
"My confidence on making
this prediction stems from stu
dies of the motivations for drug
taking," he told a predominant
ly undergraduate audi nee. "But
you could prove me wrong in
another couple of years."
Overall, assuming man sur
vives, the outlook for college
education is "much more hope
ful" than the dire predictions
made for other fields in the
next century, Katz maintained.

Through social science, "we're
learning the art of reporting our
own society to ourselves," even
within college, he explained. The
growth of psychiatry and other
social services reflects the need
for developing a more human
ized society.
"I look forward to the day
when we can have a community
project not only in East Palo
Alto but also in Atherton," he
said.
College students are in "an
ideal position to take a detached
view of society" — and serve
as its critics, he said. Students
rank high in idealism, are near
the peak of their intellectual
power, and ane free from family
or occupational commitments.
Instead of trying to "explain
|away" the idealism and rebel
liousness of youth — as has
been done since the days of
Plato — society should help
students fulfill their desire to
have "more face-to-face con
tact with the 'mpulsive side
of life" and relate their per
sonal interests to events in
the outside world.

Students want to travel —
"to see strange people and
places," to explore and express
their personal feelings and to
relate these concenns to their
studies, he added.
The assumption of greater per
sonal autonomy by college stu
dents parallels the earlier phy
sical onset of puberty in our
society, Katz noted. "Students
are taking on much more in
dependence in their personal
lives."
When they're placed in control
of tutoring projects or other

activities, "they often do very
much better than adults," h
added.
Today's students tend to re
ject authority that is imposed
on them simply through hier
archal status. "They're looking
for more natural authority,
where people are listened to for
what they have to offer stu
dents," he said.
This search for greater per
sonal independence comes in
sharp contrast to the conformist
"organization man" of a decade
ago.

The assumption of greater per

are taking on much more in

of tutoring projects or other

activities, "they often do very
much better than adults," h
added.
Today's students tend to re

"If this new pattern persists

It may already have led to
"at least a partial moratorium
on sex," he hypothesized. Pro
viding men and women students
with shared dining and social fa

A major contributor to a

Student," published by the

pleted a four-year study of stu

and the University of California

By placing more emphasis
on acquaintances and shared
activities, he explained, coed
ucational housing avoids "over
idealization" of the opposite

sex and a good deal of the
"mutual teasing and destruc

of campus dating.
The long-range result may be
a "prpfound modification" —
and strengthening — of mar
riage.
New life styles now apparent
among students "hold the prom

abundant life in the future,"
Katz added.
Both the organization man and
the drugged social drop-out are

out for students, especially at

they have failed to fulfill their

"My confidence on making

Overall, assuming man sur

education is "much more hope
ful" than the dire predictions
made for other fields in the
next century, Katz maintained.

College students are in "an
ideal position to take a detached

rank high in idealism, are near
the peak of their intellectual

Instead of trying to "explain

liousness of youth — as has
been done since the days of
