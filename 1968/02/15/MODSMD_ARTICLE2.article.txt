# 'Old Men's War'
## Gavin Criticizes Viet Policy 
### DAN SNELL 
In a folksy, freewheeling
speech Vietnam critic James
Gavin left aside his prepared
text and called for the student
generation to support his ef
forts to change U.S. policy in
Southeast Asia.
Refusing to condone resis
tance to the draft in his speech
yesterday afternoon in Memorial
Auditorium, the former Army
general said, "If asked to go
into the service, you should go.
"But for heaven's sake sup
port me in what I'm doing. I'm
trying to do all I can in Wash
ington for change, change in
management, to get this coun
try turned around," he said to
the 1,000 students and faculty.
Gavin called the conflict in
Vietnam "an old men's war,"
fought on premises that are out
moded. He cited the concept of a
monolithic Communist menace
as an example of "old men's"
premises.
Gavin pointed out that he re
signed from the Army in 1958
because of his disagreement
with President Eisenhower's con
cept of massive retaliation with
nuclear, weapons.
The former general, who said
he was "not a politician," as
serted that the President should
appoint a cabinet-level post to
look into possibilities for a ces
sation of hostilities in Vietnam.
He also called for an end to the
bombing of the North.
Gavin stressed that the U.S.
has many other problems that
are being ignored because of
the Vietnam situation.
He cited as examples the dras
tic cuts in foreign aid to under
developed nations. These cuts,
he said, are letting the Russians
"move in" economically and
militarily in these areas.
"As well, we talk about NATO
(North Atlantic Treaty Organi
zation) as though it were moth
erhood, not to be mentioned,"
Gavin said. He called for a com
plete reorganization.

Gavin said, "We worry about
taxing tourists when we have
an army in Europe that we need
like a hole in the head."
In his text Gavin called for
having NATO's commander be a
European.
Gavin also called for giving
the vote to persons 18-years-old
and above on the argument that
if they are required to die for
the country, they "ought also to

be allowed to vote for its lead
ers.
Gavin said, "There are now 12
million young people who'd have
the vote if it were given to 18-
year-old. But I wish there were
24 million of them, because only
the young people can bring
about the change" which the
general advocates.
The former ambassador to
France under President Kennedy

said in the question-and-answer
period that Charles de Gaulle
has a "marvellous sense of his
tory." He said he feared what
might happen when de Gaulle
dies because the French consti
tution would allow the takeover
of a powerful man as president."
"And that man who takes over
might well be a dictator less
benevolent than de Gaulle," he
said.
