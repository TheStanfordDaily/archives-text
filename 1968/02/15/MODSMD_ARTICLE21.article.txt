# Cards Face USC In Swim Titanic
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The giants of the college
swimming world square off to
night in the Beverly Hills High
School pool. USC, proud owners
of an undefeated string of 94
dual meets long, puts 11 years
of winning swimming on the
line against Stanford, defending
NCAA champions and undefeat
ed in two years.
Friday afternoon, the Cards
face NCAA champions Mike
Burton and Zac Zom and the
rest of the Bruins at UCLA's
pool.
The Stanford frosh host Long
Beach City College Friday at
3:00 p.m. and Santa Ana JC Sat
urday at 2:00 p.m.
Stanford broke one USC
string last year. The Cards came
from behind to knock off the
Trojans and crush Southern
Cal's bid for a sixth consecutive
NCAA championship.
Dual Duels
USC-Stanford dual meets have
been rugged affairs over the last
few years. Two years ago Roy
Saari pulled out f he last relay to
beat the Indians. Last year, 2000
fans in the Encina pool watched
the two powers battle to a 52-52
stalemate.
USC hasn't lost a conference
championship since the confer
ence began 8 years ago, and last
year was no exception. Stanford
rebounded from the healthy
AAWU loss to cop the big one.
USC is loaded from last year's
spectacular freshman team and
a fleet of returning lettermen.

Pan Am 100 freestyle champion
Don Havens, world record dis
tance freestyler Greg Charlton,
AAU 200 backstroke champ
Mark Mader, and former nation
al champion butterflier Phil
Houser make the Trojan front
line a formidable one.
Southern Cal has always had
depth to burn, and this year the
Trojan distance freestyle dele
gation is an awesome one. To
gether with Charlton, Steve Dan
ielson, Greg Fink, and George
Watson leave little room in the
pool. Bill Johnson and Mike SJie
bert can swim in any number of
places in the lineup.
Stanford has lost Greg Buck
ingham who took a superhuman
three first places in last year's
USC meet. But the Cards return
stronger in other places.
Both Returns
Dick Roth, world record hold
er and winner of three NCAA
gold medals last year, uses his
versatility as his greatest weap
on. Pete Siebert is a threat in
the individual medley, butterfly,
or most anywhere else.
Luis Nicolao in the butterfly
and sprint freestyle is an intimi
dating reality. Mike Wall, in the
best shape ever at this stage of
the season, will be gunning for
upsets in the distance freestyle
with Gary Sheerer and Tom
Jamison.
Team captain Bob Momsen,
silver medalist breaststroker at
the Pan Ams, doesn't consider
losing. Sophomore diver Bill
Main has dominated the confer

ence diving statistics so far, and
with John Parker should slow
down the Trojans in the two
springboard events.
Sprints Decisive
Last year, USC took 1-2 in the
50, 100, and 200 freestyle on
judges' decision finishes, and tied
the meet by winning the sprint
relay. Hoping to turn the tables
in 1968, Stanford coach Jim
Gaughran says, "This year our
sprinters could win it for us."
Morgan Manning, Ken Ham
mer, Jeff Hammett, and Bill
Meyer have "sprinted down," or
tapered the workout load, to ap
proach season-end speed.
In the inevitable place-predict
ing that goes on before a big
meet, neither team comes out
much more than a few points
ahead. The squad that wins both
medley and freestyle relays will
probably go home with its win
streak intact.
USC coach Peter Daland ex
plained his profound objections
to the NCAA freshman-eligible
rule in a recent article in the
L. A. Times. The article ended
with the quote, "I hope the only
Indians we meet Thursday night
are the ones we've been expect
ing."
Daland won't have to worry,
since the AAWU decided last
week to postpone acceptance of
the NCAA rule for at least one
year. But, as one Stanford team
member noted, "Maybe we'll
show them the ones they ex
pected won't be quite the gra
cious guests they anticipate."
