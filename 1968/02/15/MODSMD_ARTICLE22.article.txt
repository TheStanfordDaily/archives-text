# Club Sports Interest Grows At Stanford
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Club sports at Stanford—far
detached from primitive times
when all games were "club"
sports—are quietly thriving.
Independent to formulate
their own organizations and
schedules, the 15 clubs are
loosely tied to the athletic de
partment under W. P. Fehring,
director of club sports, a post
created last September.
And a glance at just five of
the clubs indicates the vitality
of the program.
George Pegelow, president
of the Kenpo karate club, said
a photographer from Look
spent four days with the club
last quarter preparing a story
tentatively set for publication
this spring.
"We encourage broad discus
sion of all aspects of karate,"
Pegelow said, noting the philo
sophical as well as the physical
and competitive phases.
Presently the 80 member, co
ed club is attempting to organ
ize a collegiate league and Pege
low has been asked by the In
ternational Kenpo Karate Assn.
to help.

Robert Mardian, Larry Butler
and Jeff Lucas are members
holding current titles in varied
west coast competition.
Meanwhile, the Judo club Is
selecting a six-man team for
the NCAA finals March 30.
Stanford tied for fourth last
year.
"The team is in a complete
rebuilding process, but we're
rather hopeful this year," said
Don Ryujin, last year's captain
who is sidelined with an injured
shoulder.
The six who figure to go to
Fort Collins for the NCAA are
Brian Koch, Rich Warp, Henry
Shishido, Reese Cutler, Robert
Hossley and Keiji Muranga.
Coach Tamo Kitaura, himself
a fifth-dan black belt holder and
official at the World Judo cham
pionships last summer, has five
tournaments scheduled for his
team this quarter and more
planned for spring.
The sailing club, largest of
the 15 with membership swell
ing to 300, is also girding for
national competition.
Skipper Tom McCarthy will
take a 44-foot yawl and crew
members Craig McCabe, Larry
Rosenzweig, Ray Wilde, John
Landon, Jergen Gramckow,
Bruce Howard and Steve Rich

ard to Annapolis, Md., April 20
to defend Stanford's title at the
John F. Kennedy Races.
The club competes intercol
legiately with two leagues com
bining 17 California teams and
offers instruction and club sail
ing to its members each week
end on Lake Lag.
Coach Wilson Condon's crew
team, shaping up since
September, is continuing its
preparation for its Pacific
Eight schedule which opens
April 18.
Condon, hesitant to make
early predictions, still ventured
"I think we'll have a good crew,"
and quickly tabbed UCLA as the
league's top team.
Seven returnees from last
year's first boat "obviously give
us a fair amount of experience,"
he added.
Regarding Stanford's crick
et club which finished its sea
son in December, Fehring said
"They won about everything
they could win in northern
California."
The team captured the North
ern California Cricket League
championship and also won the
Price Elimination Cup and the
Seven-a-Side tournament.
