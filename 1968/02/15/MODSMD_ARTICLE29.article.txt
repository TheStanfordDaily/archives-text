# Esalen President To Speak Tonight
## 
### 
Michael Murphy, co-founder
and President of Esalen Insti
tute, will speak for Century 21
tonight at 7:30 p.m. in Tresid
der Large Lounge.
His topic is "The Scope of the
Human Potential â€” Some Ex
perimental Approaches to Esa
len Institute."
Murphy, 37, is a Stanford
graduate in psychology and a
student of Indian Philosophy.
He and the rest of Esalen devo
tees believe that vast areas of
human potential are generally
neglected in today's culture.
The 5-year-old Esalen Insti
tute is located near Big Sur. Its
staff of social scientists are en
gaged in the new techniques of
"sensitivity training," designed
to make people more aware of
themselves and of their "authen
tic" relations with others. They
employ sensual and physical,
rather than verbal experience to
achieve this end.
Sensitivity training is very
big across the country. Business
executives, doctors, lawyers,
clergymen, peacecorpsmen, and
even 350 state department offi
cials are using the techniques
to improve their "interpersonal
relations."
"We have to learn to listen
to our bodies if we are ever to
enrich and expand our life of
feeling," says Murphy. He feels
that modern man loses the
wholeness of his being by smoth
ering his feelings under layers
of intellectual abstraction.

"In one of Esalen's body
awareness exercises, a student
lies lace-down on a sheet on the
grass. Two others kneel beside
him and pound his legs, buttocks
and back with their hands. The
three then stretch out and cling
to each other.
The work of Esalen has at
tracted such academic psycholo
gists as Abraham Maslow of
Brandeis, president of the Amer
ican Psychological Association,
and Harvard's B. F. Skinner.
