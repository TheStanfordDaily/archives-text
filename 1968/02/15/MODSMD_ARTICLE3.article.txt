# Negro Increase Will Not Be Rapid
## 
### 
"Changes of the order of mag
nitude which you urge simply
can't be accomplished over
night," Vice Provost Herbert
Packer has told the students de
manding a large increase in Ne
gro enrollment at Stanford.
Packer was replying to Law
rence Pischoff's letter to Asso
ciate Provost Robert Rosen
zweig which proposed that a
much greater percentage of next
year's freshman class be Negro.
Rosenzweig is head of a Study
of Education at Stanford sub
committee investigating minor
ity recruitment policy.
Pischoff's proposal was that
Negroes "who seem to have at
least minimal ability to com
plete a Stanford education,"
should be admitted and given
transitional and tutoring pro
grams to help them stay in Stan
ford.

Rosenzweig also wrote a reply
to Pischoff's letter. He said, "the
hard questions come not at the
level of general objectives but
at the level of how, how fast,
with what money and other sim
ilarly unpleasant but unavoid
able matters."
Packer was more specific
about the obstacles; "to cite just
one example, there is no possi
bility whatever that the addi
tional financial aid required by
the terms of the proposal be ob
tained for next year. It is going
to take more time than that to
work out this problem."
"This is the type of gradual
ists attitude which will keep
Stanford the way it is — a whits
liberal institution. It will not get
at the problem where it really
is, the problem of the institu
tion and the self-determination
of the ghetto," Pischoff told The
Daily referring to Packer's let
ter.
Pischof wrote the letter as one
of the co-chairmen of the Com
mittee for Increased Black Ad
missions, a group which is cir
culating a petition asking in
creased Negro enrollment.
