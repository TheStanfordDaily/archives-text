# Grads Still Face Uncertainty About Draft; Johnson Silent
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
"If nothing changes . . . ."
Today University officials al
ways begin a discussion of the
draft with that remark. More
and more they are starting to
think the unthinkable — that
President Johnson or Congress
will make no changes in the
present draft regulations.
As now written, the Selective
Service Act of 1967 ends the
deferments for all first year
graduate students in September.
No new 11-S deferments will be
given to graduating seniors.
Medical students and graduate
students already in their second
year of study would continue to
be deferred.
To make matters worse, the
draft rules instruct local
boards to induct the "oldest
first" out of the pool of eligi
ble men. Graduate students
and seniors, most of them be
tween 22 and 26 years old,
would go before the younger
men.
This means the 1968 national
draft call of 302,000 will be filled
first by 162,000 senior men and
90,000 able-bodied first-year grad
uate students, according to esti
mates of the Scientific Man

power Commission. Conceivably
every eligible man in these two
groups could be inducted.
"If the law is rigidly enforced,"
says Virgil Whitaker, dean of
the graduate division, "my guess
is that 25 to 30 per cent of the
students we accept for graduate
study next fall could be draft
ed."
Women, foreign students, vet
erans, and IV-F's would remain
—if draft boards follow the let
ter of the law.
Ever since the 1967 law was
passed by Congress June 30,
universities have expected
Johnson to make modifications
permitted by the law which
would greatly soften the im
pact on higher education.
But Johnson has been silent.
Last November university of
ficials across the country said
they expected the National Se
curity Council to announce the
continuation of deferments for
science and engineering gradu
ate students because their stud
ies were "necessary to the na
tional . . . interest." But the
Council apparently decided not
to act, heeding the warnings of
college officials that such a pol
icy would cripple the humanities
and social sciences.

Instead Stanford and other
universities started lobbying
vigorously for a Presidential di
rective setting up a "prime age
group" permitted under the
1967 law. This would abrogate
the "oldest-first" provision and
make 19-year-olds equally vul
nerable as the older seniors and
graduate students. Some method
of random selection, such as
birth-dates, would be used by
draft boards to select out of this
enlarged pool. A smaller per
centage of graduate students
would be inducted.
Late last month university of
ficials were sure they had won
their battle for a prime age
group. Berkeley's Dean of Engi
neering George Maslach predict
ed an announcement by the
White House Jan. 23. Stanford
Provost Richard W. Lyman said
the prime age group was "the
strongest possibility."
But their hopes were shat
tered. The White House kept
its silence. Walter Findeisen,
Stanford's national service ad
viser, believes the political ex
plosiveness of the draft has
convinced Johnson he should
let Congress and the local
draft boards decide the fate of
graduate students.
Even if the letter of the law
stays unchanged, Whitaker feels
enormous uncertainties will ex
ist about its application. "The
real intangible is the basic atti
tude of the local draft boards,"
he continues.
Whitaker believes "the draft
boards will reflect the climate of
opinion, which will be affected
by military events. The outcome
of those events we simply can
not predict."
Despite "hostility" toward
graduate study as a means of
draft evasion, Whitaker and Fin
deisen think some draft boards
will continue to defer graduate
students under certain condi
tions.
By "stretching the regulations
somewhat," Whitaker points out,
a draft board could give 11-A
occupational deferments to re
search and teaching assistants
and others. "Any registrant who
is preparing for critical skills
and other essential occupations"
is eligible according to the regu
lation. But Findeisen doubts the
11-A deferment will substitute
much for the 11-S classification
that now protects graduate stu
dents.
Another imponderable Is
whether all local boards will
actually Induct a I-A actively
engaged In graduate study
when they could Instead take
a 19-year-old I-A who is not In
college. The 1967 law leaves
the 4,100 local boards with
great discretion in such cases.
Stanford's attempts to predict
the impact of the draft on grad
uate study is complicated fur
ther by a lack of knowledge
about the percentage of men
who will be classified IV-F. The
American Council on Education
advises that as many as 25 per
cent could be deferred as physi
cally unfit for the Army.
The rest face compile uncer
tainty when their 11-S defer
ments expire between June and
October. Lyman fears a "serious
morale" impact of this uncer
tainty on seniors. "It's hard to
make plans and seriously believe
in what you're doing," he com
mented.
"If I were advising a senior,"
Whitaker says,"I would tell him
to face the fact that if he is
draft eligible there is consider
able chance he will be drafted.
"But I'd tell him he should
go ahead with the normal
course of his life," Whitaker
adds. "It's the only rational
thing to do in this kind of
world."
But the University can't be
sanguine when a large but un
known percentage of its enter
ing graduate students may be
inducted in the middle of their
studies. To fill the 2,000 open
ings for graduate students in all

schools except medicine, the
University sends out accept
ances to about twice that num
ber.
Whitaker has advised depart
ments to take these steps:
• Arrange all applications for
graduate study in "order of
priority" so they can quickly in
crease the number of accep
tances.
•Send out more offers of fi
nancial aid than the department
actually expects to grant.
Some of Stanford's depart
ments will be hit much harder
than others. Education, with
only 18 draft-eligible students,
has little to fear. But the law
school "could be decimated,"
according to Assistant Dean
Thomas E. Robinson.
Eighty per cent of the school's
first year class hold 11-S defer
ments. "If they draft the oldest
first, it's conceivable we could
lose them all prior to their
expected graduation date—ex
cept for the women, veterans
and IV-F's who comprise the

remaining 20 per cent," Robin
son said.
The law school also has no
way to predict how many of next
fall's entering class of 155 will
be drafted. The law school has
been sending out acceptances
since Jan. 1, and will have the
"bulk" out by April 15. Last
year, ten students applied for
every vacancy in the school's
entering class.
Robinson says the law school
will make its waiting list much
larger as a precaution. Another
action the school could consider
would be to "increase the size
of the entering class to balance
attrition."
Most departments are putting
off decisions about the number
of acceptances to send, accord
ing to Whitaker. An Executive
Order from the White House
could still change the outlook
drastically. But Whitaker con
siders the financial aid offering
date—April I—as a deadline in
the University's response to the
draft.
