# Grads Still Face Uncertainty About Draft; Johnson Silent
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
"If nothing changes . . . ."
Today University officials al
ways begin a discussion of the
draft with that remark. More
and more they are starting to
think the unthinkable — that
President Johnson or Congress
will make no changes in the
present draft regulations.
As now written, the Selective
Service Act of 1967 ends the
deferments for all first year
graduate students in September.
No new 11-S deferments will be
given to graduating seniors.
Medical students and graduate
students already in their second
year of study would continue to
be deferred.
To make matters worse, the
draft rules instruct local
boards to induct the "oldest
first" out of the pool of eligi
ble men. Graduate students
and seniors, most of them be
tween 22 and 26 years old,
would go before the younger
men.
This means the 1968 national
draft call of 302,000 will be filled
first by 162,000 senior men and
90,000 able-bodied first-year grad
uate students, according to esti
mates of the Scientific Man

power Commission. Conceivably
every eligible man in these two
groups could be inducted.
"If the law is rigidly enforced,"
says Virgil Whitaker, dean of
the graduate division, "my guess
is that 25 to 30 per cent of the
students we accept for graduate
study next fall could be draft
ed."
Women, foreign students, vet
erans, and IV-F's would remain
—if draft boards follow the let
ter of the law.
Ever since the 1967 law was
passed by Congress June 30,
universities have expected
Johnson to make modifications
permitted by the law which
would greatly soften the im
pact on higher education.
But Johnson has been silent.
Last November university of
ficials across the country said
they expected the National Se
curity Council to announce the
continuation of deferments for
science and engineering gradu
ate students because their stud
ies were "necessary to the na
tional . . . interest." But the
Council apparently decided not
to act, heeding the warnings of
college officials that such a pol
icy would cripple the humanities
and social sciences.

Instead Stanford and other
universities started lobbying
vigorously for a Presidential di
rective setting up a "prime age
group" permitted under the
1967 law. This would abrogate
the "oldest-first" provision and
make 19-year-olds equally vul
nerable as the older seniors and
graduate students. Some method
of random selection, such as
birth-dates, would be used by
draft boards to select out of this
enlarged pool. A smaller per
centage of graduate students
would be inducted.
Late last month university of
ficials were sure they had won
their battle for a prime age
group. Berkeley's Dean of Engi
neering George Maslach predict
ed an announcement by the
White House Jan. 23. Stanford
Provost Richard W. Lyman said
the prime age group was "the
strongest possibility."
But their hopes were shat
tered. The White House kept
its silence. Walter Findeisen,
Stanford's national service ad
viser, believes the political ex
plosiveness of the draft has
convinced Johnson he should
let Congress and the local
draft boards decide the fate of
