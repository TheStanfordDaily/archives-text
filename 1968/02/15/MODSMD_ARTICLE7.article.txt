# Clark Commends Rights Progress
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
Recent decisions by the Su
preme Court have re-emphasized
the basic individual rights of
every American, claimed ex-Su
preme Court Justice Tom Clark
here yesterday.
Clark spoke informally with
about forty-five persons last
night in Crother's Barrister's
Pub. He explained how the evo
lution of individual rights in the
United States has been a gradual
process.
Time after time, he said, the
Court refused to hold that the
guarantees of the Bill of Rights
were included among "the privi
leges and immunities of citizens
of the United States," a phrase
contained in the 14th Amend
ment.
Clark asserted that in the past
few years, however, the 14th
Amendment's clause guarantee
ing "to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws" has been interpret
ed to be the very basis of indi
vidual rights by the Supreme
Court.
Relating these principles to
specific cases, Clark told of the
relationship of the state of Ten
nessee and the Court ruling of
"one man, one vote." Some dis
tricts in Tennessee outnumbered
others 60 to 1 in population, and
in the Court's opinion, "the most
important power that an indi

vidual can possess—the right to
vote," had clearly been violated.
Clark dissented however, be
cause he believed in the "federal
analogy" between the U.S. Sen
ate and the upper houses of the
states.
Clar! devoted timp to
explaining the evo tio
rights in regard to the criminal
ly accused. He pointed out how,
starting with the Griffen v. Illi
nois case, a defendant was given
the right to a record of his trial.
In another case, children and
"morons" were granted the
right to a lawyer. Eventually,
everyone was granted the right
to counsel.
As a concluding prediction,
Clark postulated "you'll live to
see a power shift to the urban
areas which might possibly be
worse (than the rural areas dom
inating) because some people
who live in rural areas seem to
understand city people better
than city people understand
them."

vote," had clearly been violated.

Clar! devoted timp to
explaining the evo tio
rights in regard to the criminal

Clark postulated "you'll live to
see a power shift to the urban
areas which might possibly be
worse (than the rural areas dom
inating) because some people
who live in rural areas seem to
understand city people better
than city people understand
them."
