• Hue Citadel Attacked
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Marine
jets poured rockets, napalm and
tear gas Wednesday against
North Vietnamese troops holed
up in Hue's walled Citadel in
one phase of an American air
campaign intensified on both
sides of the border.
Explosives chipped at massive
stonework of the Citadel, once
the imperial grounds of Viet
nam's emperors, in an attempt
to cut a path for American
Leathernecks trying to root out
the remnants of a Hanoi regi
ment. But it was slow work.
Field reports said almost no
progress was made through the
15th day of Vietnamese and
American operations against the
enemy force, though the rest of
the city is largely cleared of the
Communists who claimed it at
the outset of their lunar new
year offensive.
• China Downs Plane
WASHINGTON (AP) — Two
unarmed American planes which
strayed near Communist Chi
nese Hainan Island came under
Communist gunfire last night.
One was shot down, the other
fled to Da Nang. South Vietnam.
The Pentagon, announcing
this Wednesday, said the two
U.S. Navy propeller-driven A 1
Skyraiders inadvertently stray-

Ed into Hainan's airspace be
cause of navigational difficulties.
Peking Radio, in a broadcast
monitored in Tokyo, charged
the United States with carrying
out "war provocations."
"Navy pilots of the People's
Liberation Army immediately
dealt a heavy blow and shot
down one of and damaged
the other," Peking said.
At the Pentagon, Asst. Secre
tary of Defense Phil G. Gould
ing said he did not know wheth
er the second plane which es
caped had been damaged or
whether its pilot was injured.
Goulding said this pilot "re
ports he last saw the other
plane in a vertical dive and
smoking."
• Abortion Reprimand
SACRAMENTO (AP) — The
State Board of Medical Exami
ners disciplined two doctors
Wednesday for violating Califor
nia's old abortion law, but the
penalties imposed were far less
severe than were possible.
In a long awaited decision,
the board of doctors which over
sees professional conduct of Cal

ifornia physicians publicly repri
manded both men involved in
the highly controversial mat
ter.
In addition, one was given
the added penalty of a 90-day
suspension of his license to prac
tice. But the suspension was not
put into effect. Instead, the doc
tor was placed on probation for
a year. The license lifting will
take place if any further "un
professional conduct" on his
part comes to the attention of
the boar.d.
The president of the board,
Dr. Genest D. de L'Arbre, pre
dicted the ruling would be "an
opinion widely read in medical
circles." He added that the opin
ion undoubtedly would be cited
in medical schools as an exam
ple of just what types of abor
tions are considered legal in
California.
Dr. Joseph P. Shively of St.
Luke's Hospital in San Francis
co was handed both the public
reprimand and the stayed li
cense suspension. Dr. Seymour
Smith of St. Francis Hospital in
San Francisco got only the rep
rimand.

• Vance Optimistic
SEOUL (AP) — White House
envoy Cyrus Vance emerged
early Thursday from a 10-hour
meeting with South Korea's for
eign minister and an informed
source said they had reached
agreement on all but one or two
issues that have strained U.S.-
South Korean relations.
The overnight meeting with
Foreign Minister Choi Kyu-hah
was Vance's fourth session since
arriving Sunday with orders to
reassure South Koreans who
claim threats to their country's
security are being forgotten in
U.S. efforts to free the intelli
gence ship Pueblo and its crew
from North Korean captivity.
Vance originally had been
scheduled to leave Tuesday. An
informed Korean source said
Vance and Choi agreed on a
draft communique to be released
after the presidential trouble
shooter's final meeting with
South Korean President Chung
Hee Park on Thursday morning.
• Peace Bids Rejected
WASHINGTON (AP) — Secre

tary of State Dean Rusk said
Wednesday that Communist
North Vietnam has thus far re
jected President Johnson's San
Antonio formula for a peaceful
settlement of the Vietnam war.
In a statement Rusk said that
"I must report that all explora
tions to date have resulted in a
rejection."
The United States, Rusk con
tinued, is "not interested in
propaganda gestures whose pur
pose is to mislead and confuse;
we will be interested in a seri
ous move toward peace when
Hanoi comes to the conclusion
that it is ready to move in that
direction."
"Hanoi knows how to get in
touch with us," the statement
noted.
Robert J. McCloskey, press
officer for the State Department,
read the secretary's statement
to reporters.
Ask' d whether the statement
was drafted with Rusk knowing
what was in the most recent
peace feelers through U.S. Sec
retary General U Thant and
Italian foreign minister Amin
tore Fanfani, McCloskey replied
that the statement "takes into
account everything we know."
• Slum Aid Expected
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) —
President Johnson is preparing
program to clear slums and
build low-income housing to
help ease the threat of rioting in
the nation's cities, informed la
bor sources said today.
Johnson will send the housing
message to Congress by the end
of the month at the latest, the
source said.
AFL-CIO leaders, including
President George Meany, had
knowledge of the President's
housing proposal in pledging la
bor's cooperation in the federal
model cities program, it was
learned, and to actively recruit
more Negroes into the building
trades unions.
• Khe Sanh Bombarded
DA NANG, Vietnam (AP) —
History's most concentrated
aerial bombing campaign is un
der way around the U.S. Marine
base at Khe Sanh in an effort to
break the Communist siege
ring, a qualified U.S. Air Force
source said Wednesday.
Although large numbers of
North Vietnamese troops and
supply and ammunition dumps
have been presumably de
stroyed, Communist pressure on
the base 14 miles south of the
demilitarized zone builds steadi
ly-
Some Marine officers believe
that without the mighty bomb
ing campaign, Khe Sanh al
ready would be untenable. Only
5,000 Marines face a force of
perhaps 20,000 North Viet
namese regulars.
• Riot Force Proposed
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
President's Commission on Civil
Disorders is considering recom
mending creation of a specially
trained federal force to deal
with urban riots.
Sources close to the commis
sion said the proposal reflects
dissatisfaction with the perform
ance of National Guard units in
trying to quell riots last sum
mer.
President Johnson appointed
the 11-member panel last July
29 to investigate the causes of
riots that erupted in Detroit,
Newark and other cities and to
recommend preventive action.
• Paris Peace Feeler
PARIS (AP) — U.N. Secre
tary-General U Thant came to

Paris today and called on a top
North Vietnamese diplomat, pre
sumably to get a message from
Hanoi on peace negotiations.
Thant talked for 75 minutes
with Mai Van 80, North Vietna
mese general delegate in Paris.
No information was disclosed,
but a U.N. statement said the
conversation was held in a
"friendly atmosphere."
Thant called on Mai Van Bo
on a "personal basis" and not
formally as U.N. secretary-gen
eral, the statement said.
After lunch, Thant drove to
the Elysee and met with Presi
dent Charles de Gaulle, a critic
of U.S. policy in Vietnam.

ket Wednesday snapped back to

some doleful news. Trading was
heavy.

erage rose 5.61 to 837.38.
