THE SPREAD-EAGLE OF TECHNOLOGY
AT GRUMMAN
Ranges from inner to outer space
Grumman has special interest for the graduating engineer and scientist seeking the widest spread of technology for his
skills. At Grumman, engineers are involved in deep ocean technology...engineers see their advanced aircraft designs
proven daily in the air over Vietnam, and soon., .in outer space, the Grumman L\l (Lunar Module) will land the astro
nauts on the lunar surface. Grumman, situated in Bethpage, L.I. (30 miles from N.Y.C.), is in the cultural center of
activity. Universities are close at hand for those who wish to continue their studies. C.C.N.Y., Manhattan College, New
York University, Pratt Institute. Columbia University, State University at Stony Brook, Polytechnic Institute of Brook
lyn, Hofstra University and Adelphi College are all within easy distance. The surroundings are not hard to take. Five
beautiful public golf courses are in Bethpage-two minutes from the plant. White sand beaches stretch for miles along
the Atlantic (12 minutes drive). The famed sailing reaches of Long Island Sound are only eleven miles away.
The informal atmosphere is a Grumman tradition, matched by an equally hard-nosed one of turning out some of the
free world's highest performance aircraft systems and space vehicles.To name a few ...
