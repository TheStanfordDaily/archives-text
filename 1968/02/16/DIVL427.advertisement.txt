EXCLUSIVE BAY AREA SHOWING!
"'HAMLET' is a vast and regal show of strong
cinematographic values. It is a spectacle-a large,
mobile, realistic rendering of the melodramatic
action of the play-that depends entirely for its
impact upon its striking scenery, the physical
sweep of its performance and the grand effects
that the camera achieves.
A splendid and stirring musical score by
Dmitri Shostakovich has great dignity and depth,
and an appropriate wildness or becoming levity.
The director-who may be remembered, by the
way. for his direction of the brilliant 'Don Quixote'
-is not dependent 011 aural stimulation. He is
concerned with engrossing the eye. And this lie
does with a fine achievement of pictorial power.
His Hamlet is straight from the shoulder, a strong,
literal-minded young man who is angry more
often than moody.
The actors are excellent-all of them—in their
movements, expressions and passionate moods.
