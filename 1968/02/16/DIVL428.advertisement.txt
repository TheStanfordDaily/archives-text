The Qualifications of Jesus
We all want to have happy, abundant, meaningful lives. We want to b
complete human beings.
Very little of our thinking about lif originates within ourselves. Most of what
we are and what we do and think has come or is reaction against, our parents,
our teachers, our friends. We add, and embellish, disagree and experience,
but we all need to b led and to have an example to identify with, whether
we are willing to admit the fact or not.
Christians are those who have given their lives to a man named Jesus.
They are firmly convinced no better qualified man has ever existed. Subjec
tively they experience His ever-present love for them, which he has proved to
them. Objectively they point to His amazing life and achievements.
Jesus was born in an unusual way. His home and family were humble, yet
His arrival on earth exactly fulfills Old Testament prophecies. His birth in
Bethlehem, the son of a virgin, His childhood in Eqypt, the lineage of his
parents, his preexistent life were all predicted in detail by men who knew God.
Jesus conformed to the law. It is better to say "he fulfilled the law". Not
contenting himself with outward oenformity to rules and regulations he dem
onstrated inner freedom from lust, hatred, envy and greed. His example
shames the self-righteous, exposes the corrupt, encourages the honest and vin
dicates the just. After his Sermon on the Mount, Matthew records, "the crowds
were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority,
and not as their scribes".
Jesus is a leader who never compromises in any situation, His teachings
are hard, and he demands obedience. When he spoke to his men about his
flesh and his blood which would be broken and shed for them, John records,
"After this many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him.
Jesus said to the twelve, 'Will you also go away?' Simon Peter answered him.
Lord to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life,- and we have
believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God' ".
Jesus is a man of tender compassion. He has displayed infinite concern for
the individual, tender concern for children and for prostitutes. "And he went
about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of
the kingdom and healing every disease and infirmity among the people. So his
fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those
afflicted with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, and para
lytics, and he healed them. . ."
Jesus is a servant of men. When the mother of James and John asked Jesus
to give special favor to her sons, Jesus answered, "You know that the rulers
of the gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over
them. If shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you
must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your
slave,- even as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give
his life as a ransom for many."
Jesus Christ is free from hang-ups. He owned no property, amassed no
wealth, left no estate, wrote no books, travelled on foot and slept on the beach.
Though he never married, he loved men, women, mother and brothers. He
spoke authoritatively about sex, but was perfectly chaste. He had no oedipus
complex, no exploitative, lustful, or incestuous desires, no secret habits or inner
guilt.
Jesus forgave men of their sin. When a paralytic was lowered through the
roof of the home where he was speaking Jesus said, "My son your sins are
forgiven". To this the scribes replied, "Why does this man speak blasphemy!
Who can forgive sins but God alone?" Jesus then responded, ". . . that you
may know that the Son of man has authority of earth to forgive sins", he said
to the paralytic—"l say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home".
Jesus Christ overcame temptation. He wrestled with evil. He fought harmful
desire. He suffered, He endured, He trusted in God, His Father. "He had to
be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful
and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sins
of the people. For because he himself has suffered and been tempted, he is able
to help those who are tempted".
Jesus conquered death. What deeper problem do men face, what greater
fear? Jesus said, For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my
life, that I may take it again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of
my own accord I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again;
this charge I have received from my Father." Paul the Apostle records, "Jesus
Christ has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through
the gospel (good news)". The letter to the Hebrews says, "Since therefore the
children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same
nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death,
that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject
to lifelong bondage".

dicates the just. After his Sermon on the Mount, Matthew records, "the crowds
were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority,
and not as their scribes".
Jesus is a leader who never compromises in any situation, His teachings
are hard, and he demands obedience. When he spoke to his men about his
flesh and his blood which would be broken and shed for them, John records,
"After this many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him.
Jesus said to the twelve, 'Will you also go away?' Simon Peter answered him.
Lord to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life,- and we have
believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God' ".
Jesus is a man of tender compassion. He has displayed infinite concern for
the individual, tender concern for children and for prostitutes. "And he went
about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of
the kingdom and healing every disease and infirmity among the people. So his
fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those
afflicted with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, and para
lytics, and he healed them. . ."
Jesus is a servant of men. When the mother of James and John asked Jesus
to give special favor to her sons, Jesus answered, "You know that the rulers
of the gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over
them. If shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you
must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your
slave,- even as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give
his life as a ransom for many."
Jesus Christ is free from hang-ups. He owned no property, amassed no
wealth, left no estate, wrote no books, travelled on foot and slept on the beach.
Though he never married, he loved men, women, mother and brothers. He
spoke authoritatively about sex, but was perfectly chaste. He had no oedipus
complex, no exploitative, lustful, or incestuous desires, no secret habits or inner
guilt.
Jesus forgave men of their sin. When a paralytic was lowered through the
roof of the home where he was speaking Jesus said, "My son your sins are
forgiven". To this the scribes replied, "Why does this man speak blasphemy!
Who can forgive sins but God alone?" Jesus then responded, ". . . that you
may know that the Son of man has authority of earth to forgive sins", he said
to the paralytic—"l say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home".
Jesus Christ overcame temptation. He wrestled with evil. He fought harmful
desire. He suffered, He endured, He trusted in God, His Father. "He had to
be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful
and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sins
of the people. For because he himself has suffered and been tempted, he is able
to help those who are tempted".
Jesus conquered death. What deeper problem do men face, what greater
fear? Jesus said, For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my
life, that I may take it again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of
my own accord I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again;
this charge I have received from my Father." Paul the Apostle records, "Jesus
Christ has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through
the gospel (good news)". The letter to the Hebrews says, "Since therefore the
children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same
nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death,
that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject
to lifelong bondage".

The Qualifications of Jesus
We all want to have happy, abundant, meaningful lives. We want to b
complete human beings.
Very little of our thinking about lif originates within ourselves. Most of what
we are and what we do and think has come or is reaction against, our parents,
our teachers, our friends. We add, and embellish, disagree and experience,
but we all need to b led and to have an example to identify with, whether
we are willing to admit the fact or not.
Christians are those who have given their lives to a man named Jesus.
They are firmly convinced no better qualified man has ever existed. Subjec
tively they experience His ever-present love for them, which he has proved to
them. Objectively they point to His amazing life and achievements.
Jesus was born in an unusual way. His home and family were humble, yet
His arrival on earth exactly fulfills Old Testament prophecies. His birth in
Bethlehem, the son of a virgin, His childhood in Eqypt, the lineage of his
parents, his preexistent life were all predicted in detail by men who knew God.
Jesus conformed to the law. It is better to say "he fulfilled the law". Not
contenting himself with outward oenformity to rules and regulations he dem
onstrated inner freedom from lust, hatred, envy and greed. His example
shames the self-righteous, exposes the corrupt, encourages the honest and vin

to give special favor to her sons, Jesus answered, "You know that the rulers
of the gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over
them. If shall not be so among you; but whoever would be great among you
must be your servant, and whoever would be first among you must be your
slave,- even as the Son of man came not to be served but to serve and to give
his life as a ransom for many."
Jesus Christ is free from hang-ups. He owned no property, amassed no
wealth, left no estate, wrote no books, travelled on foot and slept on the beach.
Though he never married, he loved men, women, mother and brothers. He
spoke authoritatively about sex, but was perfectly chaste. He had no oedipus
complex, no exploitative, lustful, or incestuous desires, no secret habits or inner
guilt.
Jesus forgave men of their sin. When a paralytic was lowered through the
roof of the home where he was speaking Jesus said, "My son your sins are
forgiven". To this the scribes replied, "Why does this man speak blasphemy!
Who can forgive sins but God alone?" Jesus then responded, ". . . that you
may know that the Son of man has authority of earth to forgive sins", he said
to the paralytic—"l say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home".
Jesus Christ overcame temptation. He wrestled with evil. He fought harmful
desire. He suffered, He endured, He trusted in God, His Father. "He had to
be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful
and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sins
of the people. For because he himself has suffered and been tempted, he is able
to help those who are tempted".
Jesus conquered death. What deeper problem do men face, what greater
fear? Jesus said, For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my
life, that I may take it again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of
my own accord I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again;
this charge I have received from my Father." Paul the Apostle records, "Jesus
Christ has abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through
the gospel (good news)". The letter to the Hebrews says, "Since therefore the
children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same
nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death,
that is, the devil, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject
to lifelong bondage".

The Qualifications of Jesus
We all want to have happy, abundant, meaningful lives. We want to b
complete human beings.
Very little of our thinking about lif originates within ourselves. Most of what
we are and what we do and think has come or is reaction against, our parents,
our teachers, our friends. We add, and embellish, disagree and experience,
but we all need to b led and to have an example to identify with, whether
we are willing to admit the fact or not.
Christians are those who have given their lives to a man named Jesus.
They are firmly convinced no better qualified man has ever existed. Subjec
tively they experience His ever-present love for them, which he has proved to
them. Objectively they point to His amazing life and achievements.
Jesus was born in an unusual way. His home and family were humble, yet
His arrival on earth exactly fulfills Old Testament prophecies. His birth in
Bethlehem, the son of a virgin, His childhood in Eqypt, the lineage of his
parents, his preexistent life were all predicted in detail by men who knew God.
Jesus conformed to the law. It is better to say "he fulfilled the law". Not
contenting himself with outward oenformity to rules and regulations he dem
onstrated inner freedom from lust, hatred, envy and greed. His example
shames the self-righteous, exposes the corrupt, encourages the honest and vin
dicates the just. After his Sermon on the Mount, Matthew records, "the crowds
were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority,
and not as their scribes".
Jesus is a leader who never compromises in any situation, His teachings
are hard, and he demands obedience. When he spoke to his men about his
flesh and his blood which would be broken and shed for them, John records,
"After this many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him.
Jesus said to the twelve, 'Will you also go away?' Simon Peter answered him.
Lord to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life,- and we have
believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God' ".
Jesus is a man of tender compassion. He has displayed infinite concern for
the individual, tender concern for children and for prostitutes. "And he went
about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of
the kingdom and healing every disease and infirmity among the people. So his
fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those
afflicted with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, and para
lytics, and he healed them. . ."
