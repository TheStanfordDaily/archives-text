# LASSU Confirns TGRs May Vote
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The student legislature re
solved that terminal graduate
students (TGRs) were members
of ASSU and have the right to
vote and hold office, at its meet
ing last night.
Since TGRs have not been
allowed to vote in the current
vice presidential election, the
legislature decided to open the
polls for one hour today to let
them vote.
A polling place will be open
at the post office from 11:30 to
12:30. The final count will not
be complete until results are
in from overseas campuses.
The legislature passed an
emergency $200 appropriation
for the Judicial Council to run,
in full, its decision on the CIA
demonstrators case in The Daily
next week. It was announced at
last night's session that the
council has reached a decision
but will not make it public un
til Monday.
The legislature also resolved
that Stanford "make every ef
fort to increase the number of
black students at Stanford for
the next academic year."
The resolution passed with
few dissenting votes. It offered
several guidelines for admitting
more black students, including:
• to admit all black applicants
who meet minimal standards
and could get additional tutoring
here;
• to step up recruiting of mi
nority groups by publicity and
the employment of black re
cruiters;
• setting up a summer pro
gram "with courses to develop
verbal and mathematical skills;
• hiring a full-time supervi
sor for tutoring and counseling
programs with students from
minority groups; and
• having courses in black cul
ture taught in the history de
partment.
The resolution was worded to
express the "sense of the legis
lature" and does not have the
force of law. It pointed out that
the number of black students at

Stanford is very small compared
to the black population of the
country.
A bill to appropriate $3,000 for
an ASSU Professor Commission
was referred to the finance com
mittee. The ASSU Professor pro
gram, as explained by ASSU
President Cesare Massarenti,
one of its main sponsors, would
bring an outstanding professor
to Stanford for a period of up
to a year. His expenses would
be paid in large part by this
appropriation.
Also referred to committee
was a bill to set up a "student
lobby" to "give students a great
er voice in changing general
studies requirements and other
academic regulations."
