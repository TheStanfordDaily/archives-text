# What Future For ASSU?
## 
### 
It's time to ask some blunt questions about the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University.
For the past two years, the ASSU president and legislature
have spent most of their time fighting with the University ad
ministration over the powers and perrogatives of the ASSU.
Two presidents have resigned — partly in protest against the
status of ASSU, partly in protest against the apathy of students
toward the association.
Cesare Massarenti, the current president, speaks publicly of
"abolishing" ASSU. The legislature has called a convention April
6 and 13 to prepare an entirely new constitution for student con
sideration.
Why are so many prepared to disband student government?
What are the real functions of the ASSU, anyway?
ASSU's actual functions are limited to supervising other stu
dent organizations — Political Union, Cardinals Board, lIR, pub
lications, Ram's Head, and so on. In actual fact these organiza
tions are self-governing. Each May the legislature divides up a
$132,000 budget among the various organizations, with compara
tively little change from year to year. Most of the money comes
from a University appropriation.
Once the various student activities are provided for, ASSU's
imposing political superstructure has nothing else it must do.
The legislature can parcel out a $10,000 contingency fund among
miscellaneous purposes. It can pass resolutions demanding all
sorts of things. The president can use his title to make all sorts
of proposals for change in the name of the student body. And if
his enthusiasm wanes, he can resign.
o o o
As the only official campus-wide political organization, ASSU
attracts students eager to exert political power to achieve various
reforms in student life and education. When elected, they dis
cover ASSU is actually a mirage, with no significant financial
freedom, no control over student regulations, and no power to
appoint student members to University committees.
Astute radicals have realized that ASSU is worthless as an
instrument of raw political pressure on the University administra
tion. Only a legally and financially independent student union,
with real popular support, would be useful in this antagonist
role.
Other concerned students question the value of any isolated,
all-student organization like ASSU. They recognize that students
have exerted influence on important questions only by working
with like-minded faculty and administration. The 1966 liquor
regulation reform, 1967 ASSU Housing commission report, and
current Study of Education are examples.
In his campaign for ASSU presidency, Peter Lyman rejected
confining students to their own "government" organization. He
asked for "community government": student participation within
the decision-making machinery of the University.
IS ASSU at all relevant to this kind of student involvement?
Will ASSU help students secure voting membership on the
committees of the planned Academic Senate? Will ASSU help
achieve a strong student voice on the successor body to SES?
Will Stanford's next President see the ASSU as a promising
source of student members for his advisory committees?
Or will faculty, administration and a majority of the student
body continue to reject ASSU as the playground of political radi
cals who can't even find a president who'll serve out his entire
term?
Clearly a drastic re-evaluation of student government is neces
sary. The present structure is a hindrance to student participa
tion in education.

ministration over the powers and perrogatives of the ASSU.
Two presidents have resigned — partly in protest against the
status of ASSU, partly in protest against the apathy of students
toward the association.
Cesare Massarenti, the current president, speaks publicly of
"abolishing" ASSU. The legislature has called a convention April
6 and 13 to prepare an entirely new constitution for student con
sideration.
Why are so many prepared to disband student government?
What are the real functions of the ASSU, anyway?
ASSU's actual functions are limited to supervising other stu
dent organizations — Political Union, Cardinals Board, lIR, pub
lications, Ram's Head, and so on. In actual fact these organiza
tions are self-governing. Each May the legislature divides up a
$132,000 budget among the various organizations, with compara
tively little change from year to year. Most of the money comes
from a University appropriation.
Once the various student activities are provided for, ASSU's
imposing political superstructure has nothing else it must do.
The legislature can parcel out a $10,000 contingency fund among
miscellaneous purposes. It can pass resolutions demanding all
sorts of things. The president can use his title to make all sorts
of proposals for change in the name of the student body. And if
his enthusiasm wanes, he can resign.

As the only official campus-wide political organization, ASSU
attracts students eager to exert political power to achieve various
reforms in student life and education. When elected, they dis
cover ASSU is actually a mirage, with no significant financial
freedom, no control over student regulations, and no power to
appoint student members to University committees.
Astute radicals have realized that ASSU is worthless as an
instrument of raw political pressure on the University administra
tion. Only a legally and financially independent student union,
with real popular support, would be useful in this antagonist
role.
Other concerned students question the value of any isolated,
all-student organization like ASSU. They recognize that students
have exerted influence on important questions only by working
with like-minded faculty and administration. The 1966 liquor
regulation reform, 1967 ASSU Housing commission report, and
current Study of Education are examples.
In his campaign for ASSU presidency, Peter Lyman rejected
confining students to their own "government" organization. He
asked for "community government": student participation within
the decision-making machinery of the University.
IS ASSU at all relevant to this kind of student involvement?
Will ASSU help students secure voting membership on the
committees of the planned Academic Senate? Will ASSU help
achieve a strong student voice on the successor body to SES?
Will Stanford's next President see the ASSU as a promising
source of student members for his advisory committees?
Or will faculty, administration and a majority of the student
body continue to reject ASSU as the playground of political radi
cals who can't even find a president who'll serve out his entire
term?
Clearly a drastic re-evaluation of student government is neces
sary. The present structure is a hindrance to student participa
tion in education.
It's time to ask some blunt questions about the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University.
For the past two years, the ASSU president and legislature
have spent most of their time fighting with the University ad
ministration over the powers and perrogatives of the ASSU.
