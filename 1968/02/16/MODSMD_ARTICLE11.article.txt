## Dow Deserves Consideration 
### MARTIN E. HELLMAN 
Dow Chemical is in the news
again. In a recent editorial The
Daily attacked our "friendly
neighborhood napalm makers."
Since the editorial board has
seen fit to revive this topic I
feel it necessary to examine this
issue and point out some incon
sistencies in their, line of
thought.
First of all, the impetus for
digging out this ghost of a topic
was an effort on the part of
Dow to inform The Daily and
other college papers of Dow's
varied activities, so that the
staff would be better informed
when discussing the company.
Dow even asked that the staff
feel free to call them collect to
answer any questions. Does the
editorial board thank Dow for
attempting to provide correct
information? No.
Misrepresentation
Rather like little kids they
decide they can play a trick on
big bad Dow by printing Its
telephone number and suggest
ing that we call in, collect. The
Daily carries Stanford's name
and as such can be quoted as
representing the Stanford com
munity. . . .

I feel that the editorial board
has acted irresponsibly and has
betrayed that trust.
When Dean Rusk canceled his
engagement to speak at Stan
ford last volume's Daily ran an
editorial which said that it was
no great loss since Rusk would
not have discussed things, but
rather given us his "same old
line." Isn't this exactly what
The Daily is doing?
Dow is trying to discuss
things on an intelligent level.
More basic than questioning
the methods used in dealing
with Dow is the question: Why
Dow?
Granted napalm isn't fun
stuff, but then again neither are
regular bombs, guns, etc. Why
not pick on all defense contrac
tors? The reason is simply that
it is easier, and more effective
to make an example of one com
pany—to harass it.
If the police were to use such
harassfnent I could well see The
Daily's headlines.
Above Their Mentality
None of the students who
would have interviewed Dow at
Stanford would have had any
thing to do with napalm. I im

agine that the manufacture of
napalm is a rather simple proc
ess requiring mostly unskilled
or semi-skilled workers. . . .
So, even if we assume it is a
crime for Dow to make napalm
does this give us the right to
harass its other activities? If a
criminal were given such treat
ment liberal Americans would
be outraged. Yet again, the sup
posed liberals compromise their
principles.
Even if napalm is immoral, is
Dow immoral for producing it?
The majority of people in this
country are in support of the
American presence in Viet Nam.
(Proposition P was defeated in
San Francisco, one of the coun
try's most liberal cities.)
So, if the blame for the war
and its use of napalm is to fall
anywhere it must fall on the
American people as a whole, not
Dow alone.
The basis for democracy is
rule of the majority. Which
means that attempts to harass
the war effort are tyrannical
acts. But then again I assume
that The Dally and the SDS
(Students for a Democratic?)
Society) have a direct pipeline
to the god of truth.

and its use of napalm is to fall
anywhere it must fall on the
American people as a whole, not
Dow alone.
The basis for democracy is
rule of the majority. Which
means that attempts to harass
the war effort are tyrannical
acts. But then again I assume
that The Dally and the SDS
(Students for a Democratic?)
Society) have a direct pipeline
to the god of truth.
Dow Chemical is in the news
again. In a recent editorial The
Daily attacked our "friendly
neighborhood napalm makers."
Since the editorial board has
seen fit to revive this topic I
feel it necessary to examine this
issue and point out some incon
sistencies in their, line of
thought.
First of all, the impetus for
digging out this ghost of a topic
was an effort on the part of
Dow to inform The Daily and
other college papers of Dow's
varied activities, so that the
staff would be better informed
when discussing the company.
Dow even asked that the staff
feel free to call them collect to
answer any questions. Does the
editorial board thank Dow for
attempting to provide correct
information? No.
Misrepresentation
Rather like little kids they
decide they can play a trick on
big bad Dow by printing Its
telephone number and suggest
ing that we call in, collect. The
Daily carries Stanford's name
and as such can be quoted as
representing the Stanford com
munity. . . .

I feel that the editorial board
has acted irresponsibly and has
betrayed that trust.
When Dean Rusk canceled his
engagement to speak at Stan
ford last volume's Daily ran an
editorial which said that it was
no great loss since Rusk would
not have discussed things, but
rather given us his "same old
line." Isn't this exactly what
The Daily is doing?
Dow is trying to discuss
things on an intelligent level.
More basic than questioning
the methods used in dealing
with Dow is the question: Why
Dow?
Granted napalm isn't fun
stuff, but then again neither are
regular bombs, guns, etc. Why
not pick on all defense contrac
tors? The reason is simply that
it is easier, and more effective
to make an example of one com
pany—to harass it.
If the police were to use such
harassfnent I could well see The
Daily's headlines.
Above Their Mentality
None of the students who
would have interviewed Dow at
Stanford would have had any
thing to do with napalm. I im

agine that the manufacture of
napalm is a rather simple proc
ess requiring mostly unskilled
or semi-skilled workers. . . .
So, even if we assume it is a
crime for Dow to make napalm
does this give us the right to
harass its other activities? If a
criminal were given such treat
ment liberal Americans would
be outraged. Yet again, the sup
posed liberals compromise their
principles.
Even if napalm is immoral, is
Dow immoral for producing it?
The majority of people in this
country are in support of the
American presence in Viet Nam.
(Proposition P was defeated in
San Francisco, one of the coun
try's most liberal cities.)
So, if the blame for the war
and its use of napalm is to fall
anywhere it must fall on the
American people as a whole, not
Dow alone.
