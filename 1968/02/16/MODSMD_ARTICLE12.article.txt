## Ribicoff: What Price Safety? 
### Drew Pearson 
An unpublished boycott on
selling cars to the United States
government, by Ford, General
Motors and Chrysler, is sched
uled for investigation by Sen.
Abe RibicofT, D-Conn., today
(Feb. 16).
The undeclared but neverthe
less effective boycott was re
vealed two weeks ago, in Ribi
coffs investigation of new auto
mobile safety standards and
how much they cost the auto
mobile buyer.
Much to the amazement of
Senators, the General Services
Administration, big buying and
housekeeping agency for Uncle
Sam, revealed that neither Gen
eral Motors, Ford nor Chrysler
had submitted bids on any gov
ernment oars last year.
Had it not been for American
Motors, which did bid, the
United States government would
not have been able to buy cars
for either its critical or routine
operations.
Juiciest Sale
Reason the Big Three didn't
want to bid for what hitherto
has been considered the juiciest
sale in the United States was
that they didn't want to disclose
detailed facts regarding safety
which General Services now
asks for. By not bidding, the
Big Three wanted to force GSA
to drop its safety standard de
mands. This has already been
accomplished to some degree.
Sen. Ribicoff has introduced a

bill requiring automobile com
panies to itemize the cost of
new safety features on cars
they sell to the government. Last
fall the automobile companies
upped the prices and attributed
the increase to new safety addi
tions required by the govern
ment.
Sen. Warren Magnuson, D-
Wash., blasting the auto indus
try, pointed out that it had
charged $23 to $33 for a pair of
shoulder harnesses which cost
the manufacturer only $3.
Sen. Ribicoff, also critical, and
backed by Sen. Robert Kennedy,
D-N.Y., now proposes to find
out exactly how much safety
additions to cars did cost and
how much should be passed on
to the auto buyer.
Big Auto Bonanza
Already, General Services has
bowed to the Big Three's pres
sure and modified its safety
standards program. GSA also
opposes the Ribicoff bill for fear
the Big Three will continue
their ban on selling cars to the
government.
But the auto industry is not
satisfied. It wants GSA to go
further and drop its tire safety
standards, which are much
tougher than the weak Depart
ment of Transportation stan
dards for tires.
The Senators are interested
in the fact that the Big Three
motor moguls, while refusing
to bid on civilian vehicles, are

waxing fat on government mili
tary contracts. They also re
ceive handsome contributions of
cash for research and develop
ment. General Motors had de
fense contracts in 1967 totaling
$625 million; Ford got $87.4 mil
lion; Chrysler $164.7 million.
In addition the three got out
right gifts for research totaling
$53,166,000 for General Motors,
$2,989,000 for Chrysler, and
$5,099,000 for Ford. They can
keep many of the patents de
veloped from this research.
Monopoly Prosecution
Finally, the Senators are in
terested in antitrust angles
which may be involved.
General Motors appears to
lead a charmed life as far as
antitrust prosecution is con
cerned. The big case brought
against it in the Truman ad
ministration has now been com
promised. The criminal aspects
were dropped and the civil phase
was kissed off with a consent
decree.
More recently, antitrust law
yers have prepared a tentative
case against GM for monopolis
tic practices in its relations with
dealers. Some antitrust attor
neys urge the Justice Depart
ment to force GM to sell Chev
rolet, on the ground that Chevys
dominate the market. So far no
final decision has been made by
Attorney General Ramsey Clark
as to whether such a suit will
be brought.

However, the industry obvi
ously is worried. For the hear
ing room two weeks ago was
jammed with auto and tire in
dustry lobbyists who fear the
consequences of RibicofT's inves
tigation.
Ernest Barcella of General
Motors and Wayne Smithie of
Ford are hopeful that Sen. Jacob
Javits, R-N.Y., will help defend
the industry at today's session.
They are not sure of Javits. But
they know they can count on
Sen. Clifford Hansen, R-Wyo.
Hansen Performs
At the last hearing they had
the Automobile Manufacturers
Association, headed by LBJ's
old Texas friend, ex-Ambassa
dor Thomas Mann, prepare neat
ly typed questions for Sen. Han
sen. Hansen performed beauti
fully, asked the right questions
of the leading witnesses, Sen.
Walter Mondale and Lowell
Bridwell of the Transportation
Department.
Mondale has been a vigorous
critic of the padded prices
charged by the industry for
safety devices. He agrees with
RibicofT that the industry is
trying to make safety devices
unpopular with the public by
making them expensive.
Bridwell, who aspires to be
governor of Ohio and is sup
posed to protect the public re
garding auto safety, was vague
and evasive. He dodged ques
tions, refused to say anything
about the auto industry. He
even refused to say that the
cost of $23 to $33 to the public
for one pair of shoulder har
nesses was excessive. He
claimed he was not equipped to
answer the questions.
Last September Gardner Ack
ley, then president of the Presi
dent's Council of Economic Ad
visers, blasted the auto indus
try's price increases as excessive
and unnecessary. This set the
official policy for the Johnson
administration. Despite this,
Bridwell, a member of the ad
ministration, welched about sup
porting it.
