## Bobby, The Supporter Of All 
### Art Hoppe 
Good morning, friends in tele
visionland. It's time for another
chapter in that rollicking situa
tion comedy, "I Love Ethel."
As we join Bobby and Ethel
today, we find Ethel happily pre
paring an intimate little break
fast for their intimate little fam
ily.

Ethel: Let's see, 24 pieces of
toast, two dozen eggs, a gallon
and half of milk. . . . Please,
children, never punt on third
down. Not in the kitchen.
Bobby (soliloquizing above
the din): To run or not to run,
that is the question. Whether
'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
the slings and arrows of a hope
less campaign ... (as a football
hits him in the left ear) or to
hang around the house. . . .
Ethel: Please, dear, your eggs
are getting cold. Oh, by the way,
Eugene callcd.
Bobby: Ah, now there's a
Senator I admire. He has all the
qualities I cherish in myself—
courage, integrity, decency and
the guts to run a high moral
campaign on the high moral is
sues of the day. Oh, I couldn't
agree more with the high moral
stand he has taken.
Ethel: You're going to sup
port him then, dear?
Bobby: Yes, I'm giving him
my all-out moral support. More
over, I told him to call up any
time he needs it, night or day.
(Nervously) he did call on the
scrambler phone, didn't he?
Ethel: Yes, dear, at 3:04 a.m.
from a phone booth in George
town, as per instructions.
Bobby (with relief): That
proves his integrity. Too bad
he's a loser. But as I told him,
I must put loyalty above all.
There is no higher quality than
loyalty. And thus, to prove my
loyalty, I must publicly support
our President to the bitter end,
come what may. Unless, of
course, I decide to run myself.
Ethel: You're going to sup
port the President then, dear,?

Bobby: Certainly. I am plan
ning a nationwide speaking tour
in his behalf, concentrating on
the states where dissident Dem
ocrats are talking disloyally. In
my speech, I will pledge my un
qualified support for the Presi
dent. In a phrase somewhere
near the end.
Ethel: That's nice, dear.
Bobby (waxing enthusiastic):
And that's not all. To demon
strate my loyalty further, I'm
going to do all I can to make
him a better President. In his
behalf, I'm loyally going to enu
merate all the terrible blunders
and stupid mistakes he's been
making. "He may be a devious,
mad, underhanded megalomani
ac," I'll say, "but he's our Presi
dent. And loyalty demands that
we support his policies which
are leading us all straight to
hell in a handbasket."
Ethel: I'm sure he's grateful.
Bobby: Grateful? Why just
the other day he called up and
said, "Kid, how'd you like an

appointment to the Supreme
Court?"
Ethel: How nice. Did you ac
cept?
Bobby: No, I thanked him for
his generous offer, but I told him
flatly I was going to keep right
on supporting him anyway. I
know he doesn't like me, Ethel,
but I think he's growing to ad
mire me.
Ethel: I guess It's because
you are such an energetic sup
porter, dear. Who else could
support Eugene's stand on the
issues and the President's stand
for re-election? Which reminds
me, the music stand got
smashed to smithereens in an
off-tackle play. I hate to ask you
for money, but . . .
Bobby (expansively): Don't
worry, dear. I vow to support
you and the children till death
do us part.
Ethel (breaking into tears):
Oh, that you should say that to
me. I'm seeing my lawyer in the
morning.
