## Gls Support The Travel Ban 
### Art Buchwald 
I received an inspired letter
from a young draftee friend of
mine who is soon slated to go to
Vietnam:
Dear Art,
"I notice that President John
son wants to put a head tax on
tourists traveling outside the
Western Hemisphere. As a loyal
soldier who supports my Com
mander-in-Chief, I believe that
not only should this tax be
placed on tourists, but also on
Gls to discourage them from
going to Vietnam.
"Now it's true that many Gls
I have talked to had their hearts
set on going to Vietnam, but I'm
sure that a majority of them
could be persuaded to postpone
their trip if it were explained to
them that our balance-of-pay
ments situation was at stake.
"Everyone knows one of the
reasons for the U.S. gold outflow
is that so much money is being
spent in Vietnam. If every
American soldier, sailor and ma
rine who had planned to go to
Southeast Asia this year would
stay home, we could save mil
lions and millions of dollars,
which could go toward building
President Johnson's Great So
ciety.
True Sacrifice
"I have talked to all the guys
in my outfit and you would be
amazed and proud of how they
reacted to my suggestion. Tony
Morelli, who sleeps in the bunk
on top of me, said, 'I had my
heart set on going to Vietnam,
but I think we have to put our
country's economic plight ahead
of our personal pleasure. I'm
willing to make the sacrifice and
stay here if it will help the U.S.
Treasury Dept. to get straight
ened out."
"Rory Schwartz said, 'Nobody
likes to pay taxes, but if taxing
Gls so they won't go to Vietnam
is in the national interest, then
I have to go along with it. Hell,
there are more important things
in my life than visiting Viet
nam'
"Charley O'Brien also said
that he would prefer to stay in
the Western Hemisphere for the

next few years. 'I say if you've
seen one Vietnam, you've seen
them all, and I don't want people
pointing at me someday and say
ing I was the cause of the gold
drain.'
"A few of the noncoms don't
seem to have the patriotic spirit.
When I suggested our outfit
stay at home, my sergeant blew
up and said we were going
abroad whether President John
son liked it or not.
"He said 'A guy dreams of
going to Vietnam all his life. He
scrimps and saves to make it
possible, and then someone
comes along and says he can't
go because it's going to cost the
United States too much money.
Well, I might not have the
American spirit, but I'm taking
all of you with me whether you
want to go or not.'
Promotion Aspect
"I got the same reaction from
the captain who doesn't think
he can make major until he gets
some Vietnam under his belt. I
asked him if I could write to
President Johnson suggesting
my tax plan for GIs, and he
practically threw me out of the
office. He just didn't want to
save the taxpayers any money.
"Since I can't write to the
President directly without being
court-martialed, will you make
the suggestion? The tax could
be based on rank. Enlisted men
would be taxed $7 a day for
ovory day they spent In Vietnam
and officers $15 a day. Even
those who could afford it might
hesitate to pay that kind of
money to go to Southeast Asia
when there is so much more to
see here at home.

"There will probably be some
squawks from Congress, but the
way to get around that is to say
the head tax on Gls is only a
temporary measure, and as soon
as the balance of payments pic
ture gets straightened out, it
will be lifted. Then any GI who
wants to go to that part of the
world will be able to do so.
"I hope you think this is as
good an idea as the guys In the
barracks do.
"Please tell President Johnson
we support him almost 100 per
cent in his request that Ameri
cans not go abroad at this cru
cial time."
