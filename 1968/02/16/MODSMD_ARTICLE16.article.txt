## Arroyo Freshmen Disclaim House Problems' Existence 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
On Feb. 8 The Daily ran an
article "What Ever Happened to
Wilbur?" in which Arroyo
House was slandered by state
ments of our ex-president, Ted
Crooks. Perhaps, if Mr. Crooks
could refrain from his grandilo
quently phrased statements mo
mentarily and drop his pompous
airs, and above all his pipe, he
could more accurately evaluate
the situation in Arroyo.
As far as we are able to ascer
tain the situations and maladies
described by Crooks, (I.e. "sense
of rejection," "atmosphere of
apathy," "ego problems," and
"problems of the nonsucceed
ers") exist not in Arroyo, but
only in the mind and certainly
in the body of Ted Crooks.
We of Arroyo feel we have
been sorely misrepresented by
Crooks' statements and are any
thing but apathetic. We feel we
are a closely knit living situa
tion with an excellent (though
sporadically boisterous) rela
tionship between residents.
The problems of Arroyo, and
perhaps all Wilbur residencies,
are centered around inadequate
outside activities and outlets
rather than ego problems
(much, we assume, to the dis
may of our self-appointed house
psychologist.)

Integrating Freshmen
Disregards Transfers
Editor, The Dally:
While concern is high over
integrating freshmen into the
Stanford community, Stanford
has virtually ignored another
group of over 300 new students
— the transfers.
Initially, Stanford insults its
transfers by attaching part of
the transfer orientation onto the
frosh orientation. Many of the
transfers are beyond playing
games, having picnic dinners,
and listening to introductory
speeches on college life with the
frosh. They need an orientation
of their own.
The orientation this year
wasn't even adequate to prepare
the students for a tight housing
situation or to inform them of
the various eating arrangements
on campus. Since most of the
male transfers must live off
campus at first, such prepara
tion becomes important.
Unlike the many freshmen se
minars, such as the recent one
in Junipero, there Is no follow
up on the transfer orientation
to air problems and suggest fu
ture solutions.
Isolation
As a result of the situation,
the transfers begin the year in
social and academic Isolation.
The off-campus males never get
the community spirit which
many students build as frosh in
the dorms.
At the first of the year the
transfers also have little chance
to meet and talk with faculty
and administration people on a
personal basis. There is only the
possibility of attending several
"academic hostels" along with
a number of other transfers.
Joining eating clubs or fra
ternities isn't a complete solu
tion — especially for, those who
want to be within the commu
nity and not just a small so
cial group.
But apparently little has been
or is being done to correct the
problems of the transfer stu
dents.

Czechoslavokian Coup
Proves Possony Stand
Editor, The Dally:
Let me refer those who ridi
cule Mr. Possony's beliefs about
the Communist role in the
United States to their role In
"liberating" Czechoslavokia. In
the name of peace and freedom
(and of course, of the "people")
the Communists subverted one
organization after another until
they were porweful enough to
pull off a coup.
They tried the same thing in
Finland, but the Finns weren't
afraid of being "chauvinistic"
enough to recognize and to
check this subversion. As a re

sult, the Finns are today a free
people.
Our nation thrives on differ
ences of opinion and on basic
freedoms. However, I do not feel
I need to be "liberated" by the
varied front groups for the Com
munists in this country. Per
haps the real leaders who are
behind the scenes, in accordance
with classical communist tech
nique, in certain local "peace"
clubs, some violent racial ex
tremist groups, and various stu
dent organizations pretending to
favor "freedom" and "democ
racy", wish to take issue with
me.
How much real freedom would
those who condone our "libera
tion" enjoy if they were to live
in a "liberated" country? Mr.
Possnoy is, in my opinion, an
accurate and honest scholar of
Communist strategy.

Rather Repeats Desire
For Possony Lucidity
Editor, The Dally:
Since my letter to The Daily
did no more than repeat Mr.
Possony's conclusions and rec
ommendations as they were di
rectly quoted in The Dally, I
fail to see how I can possibly be
guilty of "complete distortion"
as Mrs. Possony alleges. The
more so since I specifically
asked whether he had Deen
quoted out of context by The
Daily's reporter. Was he or was
he not?
The answer is no longer clear.
Perhaps the alarmingly simplis
tic conclusions given in The
Daily were the result of a "very
complicated analysis," as Mrs.
Possony says.
In view of the doubts that
have arisen—the letters to The
Daily, in addition to numerous
conversations with others, have
shown me that I am not alone—
it seems important that The
Daily should print a statement
from Mr. Possony in the form
of an analysis (however com
plicated) supported by concrete
evidence justifying his remarks.

Confirmed ISecrophile
Explains Secret Desire
Editor, The Dally:
I am writing in the hopes that
at last I will find some vent to
my long suppressed emotions.
It is my hope that your unique
interest in, and publication of
the most intimate thoughts of
social variants is not limited to
the more conventional "perver
sions."
My correspondence has so far
been disregarded by even the
most eminent journals of sordid
prose and poetry, and I now
turn to The Daily in desperate
frustration. As a confirmed nec
rophile I find myself a lonely
pariah in a world of conform
ists.
There is no room for individ
ual development in the narrow
crevasse into which people of
the straight world fling them
selves. Heterosexuals, homosex
uals, and everyone else in this
prison of Victorian morality are
confining the cosmic growth of
their soul.
Your eyes are blinded by your
maniacal preoccupation with the
living. What a lovely world it
would be if you all dropped
dead!

Free U Administrator
Stresses Enrollment
Editor, The Dally:
In your recent series on the
Midpeninsula Free University,
both critics and some leaders of
the Free University were quoted
as believing that political
courses in the Free University
don't succeed in drawing and
keeping students.
TTiis strikes me as a myth
which is perpetuated by the un
successful. This quarter Roy
Kepler's course on the "Non-
Violent Persuasion" enrolled and
has kept between 60 and 70 stu
dents. The registration in Dave
Harris' course on draft resis
tance included over 50 students.
(Dave had to drop his course
due to his impending encounter
with the law.)
This represents substantial

evidence that a teacher who has
something original to say about
political action and can say it
without preaching will find a
ready and attentive audience
within the Free University.
Those political revolutionaries
who love the Masses and fail to
communicate with the people
around them may find it difficult
to stomach the appeal of the
Free University. But the rest of
us find the Free University an
exciting milieu within which to
combine the search for an ac
ceptable personal ethic with our
growing and changing political
awareness.

Greek Week Convinces
Student Frats Survive
Editor, The Dally:
I was gratified to read The
Daily article on the changing na
ture of Greek Week. On top of
developments this year, it seems
to show that the fraternities are
working to improve their image
in the Stanford community, and
to demonstrate that they aren't
the prankish musclebound adol
escents the campus radicals
think they are.
Last year I was convinced that
frats were doomed at Stanford;
now I feel they have a chance
to survive, by making them
selves attractive to the new in
volved student who demands
not just a residence house, but
a living group in a much fuller
sense.
Any group which does not
move out of the traditional pat
terns will eventually be unable
to find enough members to stay
in business; any group which
takes constructive action to fit
the new patterns of university
life can survive. Hopefully, the
fraternities will.

Stanford-ln-Franoe
Frosh Urged To Rush
By Fraternity Member
Editor, The Daily:
Once again The Daily's wrath
has fallen upon the fraternities.
Although by now most of the
freshmen realize that The Dally
is a waste of paper, time, and
ink, some may still be affected
by your annu il barrage of gar
bage criticizing fraternities. . . .
Think of the poor freshman
guy placed in a hole like Wil
bur. . . .
About winter, quarter he be
gins to understand what Stan
ford is really all about—nega
tive school spirit, ugly girls, in
tellectual monsters, and the
peace army. If this is his bag,
he came to the right place. If
not, he needs a quick change of
environment.
Fraternities aren't right for
every Stanford man, but those
who are tired of intellectual is
lands, like living among guys
with common interests, and
think that the dollies are basi
cally dogs, should give the
Greeks a try.

'Old Timer 9 Reminded
Of Christ 9 s Sacrifice
Editor, The Dally:
"Old Timer" (whose letter ap
peared in The Dally) seems to
have missed the point that the
Church exists for sinners and
that Jesus died for, sinners, not
for "responsible and reasonable
Church People," whatever that
may mean.
If we offer just a little of
Jesus' compassion Instead of re
sentment and bitterness, then
we shall start to be construc
tive about problems like homo
sexuality. Compassion doesn't
mean approval.
And if Mike Couzens and Har
vey Hukari were to adopt the
same tactics while ventilating
their little disagreement with
Dean Napier instead of being
rather rude, I, for one, would
find it easier to listen to what
they have to say.
