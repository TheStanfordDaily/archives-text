# Doctors Protest Budget Cut
## 
### 
Eighteen Stanford psychia
trists and psychologists, in a
letter to Gov. Ronald Reagan,
claimed financial cuts have caus
ed "extensive, unfortunate re
sults" in six Northern California
state mental hospitals.
The signers, all full-time fac
ulty of the Department of Psy
chiatry, concur that physical
conditions and morale have de
clined. Their comments rely up
on obeservations made since
1961.
A spokesman for Dr .James
V. Lowry, director of the De
partment of Mental Hygiene,
which received the budget cut,
said in refutation, "They have
a right to their opinion, but
the record speaks for itself.
We have maintained the same
number of employees per pa
tient"
More help could be used, he
added, but hospitals are closer
to reaching staffing standards
now than before.
Northern California state men
tal hospitals are located in Atas
cadero, DeWitt, Mendocino, Mo
desto, Napa, Porterville and
Stockton.
The letter states at one hos
pital the number of techni
cians dropped from 75 to 65.
Two nurses left and were not
replaced, the part-time social
worker was no longer avail
able, and the physician was
there only part time.
Ward size increased from 30
to 35 females and from 30 to 38
males. "Treatment has distress

ingly worsened,' 'the letter con
cludes.
In another hospital school
teachers were laid off, "depriving
adolescents of educational ex
periences which are crucial," the
doctors noted.
Another hospital lacks a
trained psychiatrist for the
acutely disturbed and admis
sion ward, they said. "Obvious
ly the patients at this hospital
are relying 1 primarily on non
trained, non-professional, or
nursing personnel for their
treatment, a function which it
self is being vitally cut back
by decreasing the numbers of
these personnel."
The group charges that "cut
backs have been ill conceived
and that a thorough review is
needed before any further chang
es are made."
"Upgrading of professional
skills has been seriously im
paired/ 'the letter asserts. At

tendance at staff training sem
inars has decreased because
the staff is 'so burdened.'"
In some cases, "the doctors
are doing a great many things
which they should not because
they do not have the necessary
ancillary and nursing personnel
to assist them."
The group urges "clearly
thought • out modifications"
rather than "indiscriminate
cutbacks,' 'in changes from a
state to a community-oriented
program.
The doctors involved are John
M. Kuldau, David N. Daniels,

The signers, all full-time fac
ulty of the Department of Psy
chiatry, concur that physical
conditions and morale have de
clined. Their comments rely up
on obeservations made since
1961.
A spokesman for Dr .James
V. Lowry, director of the De
partment of Mental Hygiene,
which received the budget cut,
said in refutation, "They have
a right to their opinion, but
the record speaks for itself.
We have maintained the same
number of employees per pa
tient"
More help could be used, he
added, but hospitals are closer
to reaching staffing standards
now than before.
Northern California state men
tal hospitals are located in Atas
cadero, DeWitt, Mendocino, Mo

The letter states at one hos
pital the number of techni
cians dropped from 75 to 65.
Two nurses left and were not
replaced, the part-time social
worker was no longer avail
able, and the physician was
there only part time.
Ward size increased from 30
to 35 females and from 30 to 38
males. "Treatment has distress

ingly worsened,' 'the letter con
cludes.
In another hospital school
teachers were laid off, "depriving
adolescents of educational ex
periences which are crucial," the
doctors noted.
Another hospital lacks a
trained psychiatrist for the
acutely disturbed and admis
sion ward, they said. "Obvious
ly the patients at this hospital
are relying 1 primarily on non
trained, non-professional, or
nursing personnel for their
treatment, a function which it
self is being vitally cut back
by decreasing the numbers of
these personnel."
The group charges that "cut
backs have been ill conceived
and that a thorough review is
needed before any further chang
es are made."
"Upgrading of professional
skills has been seriously im
paired/ 'the letter asserts. At

tendance at staff training sem
inars has decreased because
the staff is 'so burdened.'"
In some cases, "the doctors
are doing a great many things
which they should not because
they do not have the necessary
ancillary and nursing personnel
to assist them."
The group urges "clearly
thought • out modifications"
rather than "indiscriminate
cutbacks,' 'in changes from a
state to a community-oriented
program.
