# Guesswork Helps Figure War Casualty Statistics
## 
### 
American spokesmen in Viet
nam claim the U.S. command in
Saigon arrives at its figures on
enemy dead by body count, but
the Pentagon concedes that
these are sometimes just esti
mates.
Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara has suggested that
the figures of Communist cas
ualties are as apt to be under
statements as exaggerations,
and should be "used with a great
deal of caution."

Brig. Gen. Winant Sidle, U.S.
information chief in Saigon, said
the U.S. casualty reports, begun
in 1962 as a measurable indi
cator of progress in the war, are
issued every six hours by Am
erican divisions.
Body counts are made by
squad, or platoon-size units, and
never more than company-size.
This indicates the figures are
not the result of "estimates or
guesstimates." These counts are
relayed to battalion levels, Sidle
said, and then up the chain of
command to division, which re
leases its situation report to the
force headquarters. He added
that casualties from bombings,
strafings by planes and heli
copters, as well as those by ar
tillery fire are not included un
less someone actually "gets in
there and counts the bodies."
Correspondents, however, re
fute the accuracy of such counts.
After a battle, the field com
mander has plenty to do secur
ing his perimeter, and taking
care of the wounded; the job of
counting the dead bodies is
usually delegated to a subordin
ate. If the situation is critical,
no attempt is made to get an
accurate count, and a field esti
mate is made.
More ambiguity results in
cases where enemy units are
caught by an artillery barrage
or air strike and only pieces of
bodies litter the area. Also
counts made by relatively slow,
low flying planes cannot tell
whether a Viet Cong is actually
dead, faking, or perhaps just
wounded.
