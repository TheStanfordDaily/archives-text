### 
Gov. Ronald Reagan told the
Stanford Business Conference
yesterday the need for business
to help solve pressing social
problems is "the most . . . chal
lenging task which is before
us."
At a San Francisco luncheon
attended by 800 leading Califor
nia business executives, Reagan
said at no time in history have
so many Americans been "so
suspicious and apprehensive"
over a federal administration.
Reagan alluded to "a fear
afloat in the land . . . partly
due to a feeling of helpless
ness among the people." He
said a task force of business
men has shown how to gTeat
ly Increase the efficiency of
California government while
saving millions of dollars.
RAND Corporation president
Henry S. Rowen said at the con
ference "the seriously disadvan
taged members of our society
form a small enough minority"
that concerted efforts by busi

ness can make a "significant dif
ference" in their lives.
Rowan, who is also Lockheed
Aircraft Corp. board chairman,
said, "If business and industry
are to help solve them [the prob
lems], they must help within
the framework of the market
place in ways in which they will
be motivated by the hope of
profit. Continuing he said,
"In the long run, we must
remain profitable. I make no
apology for this. It is simply
the way we are."
"I know that we must assume
social obligations. But I also
know that society looks upon us
as economic institutions, not so
cial ones, and we cannot and
should not assume social jobs
that will jeopardize our econom
ic functions. If we do so, we will
not survive to undertake any
jobs at all."
Assistant Secretary of Com
merce Lawrence C. McQuade
suggested that government
agencies identify and locate the
unemployed, while business
firms provide training and jobs.
