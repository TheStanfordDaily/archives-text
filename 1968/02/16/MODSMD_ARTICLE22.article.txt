# Biz School Offers Summer Program
## 
### 
There is more than one way
to become an alumnus of the
Stanford Graduate School of
Business.
The modern businessman may
become the "professional" busi
nessman by enrolling in the aus

piciously named Stanford Execu
tive Program, a division of the
Stanford business school.
This program consists of a
summer, school designed to stim
ulate ingenuity and creativity in
the well experienced business
man who decides to go back to
school.
Each of the 50 businessmen
enrolled takes seven required
courses and one elective. These
classes stress developing the im
age of leadership and acquir
ing the "Dale Carnegie Syn
rome" â€” how to make friends
and influence people.
The average participating bus
inessman is 45 years old, well
qualified, though slightly staid
after his fifteen or thirty years
of experience. His company or
some foundation pays his ex
penses. His background includes
experience in general manage
ment, marketing, engineering or
finance. His previous education
may have ended at high school
or he may even have a doctor
ate.
An interesting aspect of the
program is that recently these
prospective alumni are study
ing "top management jobs" rath
er than the problems of "middle
management" studied in the pro
gram in earlier years. Although
there are no educational pre
requisites for the program, ac
ceptance of participants depends
on the importance of their posi
tion and the size of the corpora
tion with which they are asso
ciated.
In recent years the business
school has accepted an increas
ing number of applicants from
foreign countries. Approximately
one quarter of the participants
are from abroad. Denmark and
Sweden especially have supplied
a large number of the applicants.
This is felt to be a result of the
intense publicity of the Stanford
Research Institute in Stockholm.
In the last sixteen years the
Stanford Executive Program has
contributed 950 members to the
Stanford business school Alum
ni Association.
