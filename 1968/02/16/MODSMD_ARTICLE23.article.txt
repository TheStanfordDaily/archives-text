# Will Improvements Be Made?
## Discontent Stirs Among Toyon Men STANFORD DAILY FOCUS ON RESIDENCES 
### ROBERT BRODY 
It is in an excellent location
on campus, but many people
don't really know where it is.
It has $25,000 of new lounge
furniture, but only five or six
students use the lounge each
evening. It is the second oldest
dormitory on campus, but is one
of the last to receive renova
tions.
Two hundred of the members
of Stanford's eating clubs will
tell you that the building de
scribed above is Toyon Hall,
which first housed students in
1923.
To find Toyon, you look be
hind Branner Hall toward quad.
To find discontent with the ad
ministration's treatment of Toy
on, you merely find Toyon and
ask anyone living there what
they feel University officials
have done for it.
Where to Spend Money?
Item —last year the adminis
tration finally decided to im
prove the living situation In
Toyon. $25,000 was appropriated
to improve Toyon's large and
beautiful, but seldom used,
lounge. Toyon residents signed
a petition saying the money
could be better spent elsewhere
in Toyon, but the administra
tion continued its plans for the
lounge.
Students were informed that
it was too late to reappropriate
the money, and that if it was
not used it would be placed in
the general reserve for all uni
versity residences. The students
decided not to contest the appro
priation.
The new furniture changed
nothing. "I'm disappointed," said
William Friedrichs, manager of
men's residences, "it was
thought that the new furniture
would increase the lounge's
use."
Because virtually all Toyon
residents are affiliated with eat
ing clubs, each of which has its
own social facilities and a com
mon recreation room, there has
been relatively little need for
the lounge.
This year, however, an effort
has been made to hold inter
club functions there. A dance

and light show and speech and
drama department productions
have taken place in the lounge
in the last few weeks.
Recommend Improvements
Item—As a result of the dis
appointment over the lounge,
Toyon residents this fall formed
an Improvements Committee.
The committee polled over half
the residents and found carpet
ing to be the item of highest
priority for room improve
ments.
The recommendations even in
cluded a time schedule for when
the work could be done. Other
items listed by the committee
were bookcases, closets, new
desks and chairs, and plumbing.
Despite the eating clubs' ini
tiative, the administration has
not made an official response to
the study. Gary Blank, president
of the Stanford Eating Clubs
(SEC), stated recently, "Al
though discussions and negotia
tions in the past have often been
less than fruitful, it appears this
year . . . definite improvements
and renovations will be made."
Blank said, however, they were
still waiting for a final commit
ment.
Administration Answers
William Friedrichs, manager
of men's residences, and Assis
tant Dean of Students Dan Wil
liams control decisions to im
prove Toyon.
Although Friedrichs stated, "I
am in agreement with the de
mands that students have
made," and "carpeting has been
my recommendation since 1965
for both common facilities and
rooms in University housing,"
he intimated that Toyon rooms
would probably not be carpeted
until the linoleum cracked.
Four houses with cracked
floors in Stern Hall, 18 years
old, were completely carpeted
this year. Toyon floors, 21 years
old, seem to be holding up.
Friedrichs conceded however,
that, although intact, "Toyon
floors are aesthetically not very
pretty." Edward Scoles, assist
ant business manager for uni
versity housing, concurred with
Friedrichs' statement. He also

said he thought the bed frames,
desks and chairs were as old as
the building itself.
Friedrichs said these items
were "near the top of the list
of priorities."
Students Comment
When asked to evaluate the
administration's attitude toward
Toyon, junior Bill Landreth
commented, "Considering that
Toyon is the only all-male dorm,
I don't think they have planned
very well. You feel ignored here,
but I'm not sure what they (the
administration) could do about
it. I'm more concerned with the
clubs.
"It's the university's job to
provide a reasonable alternative
to Wilbur-like dorms and fra
ternities. By ignoring clubs, they
will expire and Toyon will be
hurt," Landreth said.
Bob Besse, a junior on the
Toyon Improvements Commit
tee, commented, "It seems
they've forgotten about us. I
think that if we make a big
enough stink about things,
they'll do something about
them."
Besse pointed out that at
Stern Hall house presidents bear
the responsibility for keeping in

contact with the administration,
while Toyon has no one dele
gated to this task.
"Toyon Is Adequate"
Despite disenchantment with
the administration's failure to
act in Toyon, most Toyon resi
dents are basically satisfied with
the facilities in the building.
While Stanford's other four
men's dormitories were designed
as cement blocks in which two
students usually share one room,
Toyon's architecture is a com
bination of Spanish mission and
Romanesque styles. Three stu
dents share two rooms.
Sophomore Rick Bowers com
mented, "Considering Wilbur,
this place is adequate. He ob
jected, though, to the present
floors as "horrible, ugly, and
cold." He also said the rooms
could use central water faucets
for hot and ,csld water in the
"inks in each room.
Bowers criticized, however,
the proposal for built-in book
cases, which would render room
arrangements such as his (one
bed in one room, two in the
other) less feasible.
Forrest Holly and Pete Waser,
both seniors who have spent
three years in Toyon, like it very
much, but believe that several
improvements, such as the in
stallation of carpeting, must be
made.
Having a second room allows
one roommate to go to sleep
while the other one stays up,
they pointed out. In terms of
location, it is close to the eating
clubs, the men's gym and tennis
courts, and the Quad, said Hol
ly.
Unlimited Hot Water
Waser cited unlimited hot wa

ter in the showers as a strong
point. "I came back here drunk
one evening and fell asleep in
the shower. The water was still
hot when I woke up at 6 a.m.
the next morning." he testified.
They also like Toyon because
"it gives you a small group of
people to do things with in the
club, yet you have a larger
group of people you can get to
know."
Sophomore Neil Golden re
marked, "It is adequate for a
dorm." However, he favored car
peting the rooms, stating, "Car
peting is easier to keep clean,
quieter, and better looking."
Rich Douglass, a junior in his
second year at Toyon, favored
putting drapes in the room be
fore carpeting. He found the
double room set-up better than
that in other men's dorms, but
criticized the inadequate closet
space.
Coed Plans Will Speed
Improvements
Toyon residents have present
ed a plan to the administration
asking that Toyon be made a
coed dorm next year, thereby al
lowing women members of four
clubs to take meals with other
members without paying for
them twice.
Daily sources indicate that the
dorm will, barring unforseen
circumstances, be made coed. No
official statement has come from
the administration.
If the dorm is made coed, it's
almost certain that along with
the renovations to accommodate
women, the improvements de
manded by the committee will
be made. And so the wheels of
progress begin to turn slowly
for Toyon—maybe.

A TO VON ROOM — The desks and chairs, bookcases, and bed
frames in Toyon rooms are as old as the building Itself, says As
sistant Men's residence manager Edward Scales. Toyon first housed
students in 1923. Toyon residents also complain about their floors,
which haven't received repairs in 21 years. Somewhere close to this
room is the Toyon Lounge, which sports $25,000 in new furniture.
Only five or six students use the lounge each night.
