# 'The Crucible' Improves, But Coherence Is Lacking
## 
### ROBERT EGAN 
ACT's production of Arthur
Miller's The Crucible, which ap
peared at Stanford this summer
under Allen Fletcher's direction,
has reopened, revised by Wil
liam Ball, at the Geary. Ameri
ca's only significant historical
drama, the play is an important
one. This production is interest
ing and at times effective, but
it contains a number of flaws
and unsolved problems.
That it should is not surpris
ing in view of the formidable
challenges the play presents to
any production. Briefly, it is
the tragedy of John Proctor, a
farmer who falls victim to the
Salem witch trials and Is hung
for refusing to confess. But it is
far more than simply a chron
icle of that period, or even a
veiled parable of the McCarthy
era (which several of the play's
critics have mistaken for its
basic intent). As tragedy, it is
the ultimately timeless portray
al of a man's struggle for integ
rity and identity in a society
swept by hysteria.
It is a big play with a large
number of characters (repre
senting, in effect, an entire com
munity), and its four scenes
cover a time span of almost a
year. Thus it requires the co
herence of a strong directorial
concept and several complex,
consistent characterizations to
keep it from becoming a succes

sion of of loosely related epi
sodes. The present production
never quite achieves that co
herence.
However, there are several
outstanding features. Stuart
Wurtzel has designed a versa
tile, meaningful set, consisting
entirely of rough wooden
planks and beams, which serves
with adjustments for all four
scenes. John McLain's lighting
is occasionally distracting in its
intricacy, but on the whole pro
vides an articulate commentary
on the action.
The set • changes between
scenes are performed by the
cast in a murky half-light to
eerie, Charles Ives music. This
is a fine director's touch: it cre
ates a powerful image of the
tiny Puritan community—build
ing against a background of
fear and uncertainty.
Jay Doyle is excellent as Dan
forth, the presiding judge of the
trials. Effete and smugly self
satisfied, he creates at the same
time a hypnotic aura of power
and absolute authority: the tow
ering stature of a Grand In
quisitor.
Angela Paton gives a sensi
tive, moving performance as
Elizabeth, Proctor's wife. Her.
transition from nervous suspi
cion in the early scenes to pure
womanhood when she confronts
her husband in prison is com
pellingly rendered.
Ken Ruta gives a fine and ori
ginal performance as Reverend
Hale, the well - meaning zealot
who triggers the witch - hunt.
His inventive interpretation of
Hale as a bookish paranoid is
particularly effective in the first
two scenes, though it leaves him
a bit shorthanded in the play's
second half, when Hale realizes
his folly and attempts, too late,
to stop the proceedings and save
Proctor. Such a clearing of
moral vision is somewhat incon
sistent with the manic personal
ity he has created. But this is
more a reservation than an
objection; Ruta provides the
production with considerable
strength.
Also noteworthy for their per
formances are Kitty Winn as
Mary Warren, George Ede as
Giles Corey, Ann Weldon as Ti
tuba and Michael Lerner as
Judge Hawthorne.
The two most obvious short
comings, uncertain pacing and

a lack of distinct relationships,
were largely due, I think, to
opening night stiffness and
should clear up. A few prob
lems, however, run somewhat
deeper.
Ramon Bieri is a strong actor
with considerable presence, but
he has either been miscast or
misdirected. His Proctor simply
doesn't work. John Proctor's
tragic course culminates in a
distinct victory; the crucible of
chaotic events burns away the
alloys of his guilt and self-doubt
to reveal the essence of his be
ing: a goodness and a dignity
that are worth dying for. Bie
ri's Proctor never rises in stat
ure above the Common Man,
a John Doe caught up and
crushed by forces he never, real
ly understands or comes to
grips with. There seems to be
no significance to his tearing the
confession but only a kind
of desperation, and his death
comes almost as an anticlimax.
One aspect of the direction,
an elaborately precise and cho
reographic blocking with an em
phasis on tableaux, constitutes
another shortcoming. This
trademark of Ball's direction,
which suits his TartufTe so bril
liantly and makes it the flawless
masterpiece it is, is distinctly at
odds with the harsh realism
Miller's play demands. Particu
larly in the second scene's erup
tion of violence and the girls'
courtroom hysteria, the tension
and electricity on stage are vis
ibly dissipated by lapses into
stylized movement and pre
formed, artificial groupings.
Finally, the production is mar
red by mediocre penformances
in two or three key secondary
roles. Unenergetic, one * dimen
sional acting verging on carica
ture threatens several times to
undermine whole scenes.
I have not seen the earlier
version of this production, but
I understand this to be a much
improved rendition. Clearly, it
has elements of excellence, but
it requires a great deal more
work—and thought.


THE CRUCIBLE — Angela Paton, as Proctor's wife Elizabeth, is
captured in the hysteria of the Salem witch trials.
