# Film Cannot Claim To Be Art-Shock Value, But No Insight
## 
### 
It is debatable whether or not
a film version of Truman Ca
pote's novel, In Cold Blood,
should have been made, or what,
for that matter, was the value
of the book.
The film is both interesting
and shocking in many ways.
Like the book, it is a recreation
of the event, from the initial
planning to the inevitable cap
ture and execution of the two
killers, Perry Smith and Dick
Hickock.
What could be more appeal
ing to an audience than vio
lence, sex, and the eventual tri
umph of good over evil? The
film is a commercial product de
signed to sell, rather than a
piece of artistic creativity. But
no matter what is said about
this film, people are going to
see It, just as people read the
book.
But one has to question the
value and purpose of simply
presenting horror on the screen.
The only result is mass shock,
but at what? We are horrified
that such a thing could happen
in our, society, that we our
selves are partially to blame,
and that we might someday kill
people ourselves.
The shock effect of the movie
will come from its documentary
style; the movie is filled with
facts. Yet there is little insight
into the characters who brutally
murder a family of four. And
there are, it seems, only two
actors in the film—the two kill
ers. The remaining characters
are basic stereotypes. There are
"common folks" from the town
to give us the homey country
feeling, and policemen straight
from Dick Tracy. At times, even
the killers seem to be rather lu
dicrous, for much of what Ca
pote was able to carry off ver
bally could not be directly trans
lated into the film, as was some
times attempted.
The movie is not giving visual
insight into our lives, rather it
is merely a replay of what hap
pens, perhaps less dramatically,
every day. Just as we sit and
watch this movie, we sit and
watch human lives being taken.
Capote has posed a fundamental
question and done absolutely
nothing with it, except present
it to us. There is value in that,
but all of us can at least do as
much as Capote has done. The
film tends to remind one of the

early silents that were simply
moments from life presented on
a silver screen.
In Cold Blood inadvertently
raises the questions of what be
longs on the screen, what is art,
and is film an art form? Death,
presented in such realistic terms
that it seems abstract, has be
come entertainment. Not in the
usual sense of westerns or even
Bonnie and Clyde, but your
death, and the world you live in.
We are so alienated from our
own lives that In Cold Blood is
merely a pleasant way to spend
an evening. For, this "alienation
as our present destiny is

achieved only by outrageous vio
lence perpetrated by human be
ings on human beings." (R. D.
Laing, The Politics of Experi
ence, p. xv.)
If we judge film for what it
makes us do, then In Cold
is justifiable, for we are forced
to think of this horrible prob
lem that our society has created.
But the film cannot claim to be
art. Art not only makes us re
act, but does so creatively.
The movie is currently being
shown at the Cinema 21, Chest
nut and Steiner, in San Fran
cisco.
