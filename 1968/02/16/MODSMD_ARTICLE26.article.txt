### DAVE PROCHASKA 
Large scale, hard-edge acry
lics by Keith Boyle are now at
the Hansen Gallery, 228 Grant
St., San Francisco. The effect of
Boyle's big linear forms is
heightened by his bold color con
trasts. In earlier works such as
High Street Steps and Joy
Spring, he utilized curvilinear
ribbons of color and areas only
slightly different in hue to
achieve his effect. But in later
works like Green Dolphin Street,
the color is richer, bolder and
there is a sense of dynamic
movement.
Marvin Lipofsky suggests
what can be done to ordinary
bottles with his marvelously
flowing glass sculptures. The
glass shapes have been pulled,
pressed, squeezed, rolled,
pinched and otherwise trans
formed into exquisite postures
of exhausted glass.
Standing in a room full of Ro
land Petersen's paintings at the
De Young Museum, one is im
pressed first by their shrillness.
One of the "Figurative Four",
along with Elmer Bischoff, Jean
Brown, and David Park, Peter

sen almost always paints picnic
scenes with garden tables, para
sols, the same flagpole and pic
nickers. The tables and parasols
are arranged so closely together
that the paintings resemble al
ternating grids of bright sun
light and dark shadow. The
thick paint, bright light, and pas
sive figures suggest the work
of Wayne Thiebaud.
Also at the De Young are pho
tos by Joanne Leonard. They
were taken in the predominant
ly black neighboorhood of West
Oakland where she lives. They
are interesting because they look
like photos from a technically
fine family album. Children pose
on backyard fences, betrothed
couples in family living rooms,
and neighborhood events are
stressed. The feeling of a family
album is heightened by the oval
frames of many of the portraits.
We see here a facet of a neigh
borhood which we don't ordi
narily see, one which is revealed
only after trust and respect have
been established on both sides.
Luis Arias Vera is a Peruvian
artist who paints 3'xs' airmail
envelopes in oil. Although he

copies airmail envelope designs
from all over the world, the
stamps are still more interesting
whether pretty girls or a por
trait of the artist himself. He
currently has a show at the
Moore Gallery, 535 Sutter.

Perhaps the most exciting cur
rent exhibit is the one closest to
campus. On the second and third
floors of the Palo Alto Medical
Clinic, 300 Homer, are works by
Louisa Jenkins which she calls
Accretions. And these they lit
erally are. Her technique is es
sentially collage—she builds up
layer upon layer of Oriental pa
pers which she then paints,
sprays, imprints and stencils.
The result is a complexity and
variety which is truly extraordi
nary. Works like these must be
examined closely and carefully
to fully appreciate them. There
is a richness and attention to
detail which convinces the view
er that these works, like those
of Mark Tobey, are genuine la
bors of love.
I liked Obellia, Coral Tree of
Life, and Involving best. These
seem to undulate in a never-end
ing expansion, eruption and con
traction. She has also created
some highly imaginative beasts
in Medussa, The Deeps, (a Rou
ault-like head), and especially
Inertia, a heavy-jowled and cav
ernous-mouthed creature about
to collapse from sheer boredom.
Inertia, is a good example of
how Miss Jenkins builds a mul
tilayered painting with pieces of
paper. She builds the back
ground behind and around this
creature in such a way that he
seems to be in the midst of a
number of reflecting and shift
ing planes. Only the outline of
the figure has been sketched in
so that as you move closer, the
pattern and richness of the de
tail emerges, not the figure it
self. Standing directly in front,
the creature seems to float free
ly in a multidimensional swirl of
color and shapes.
By contrast works like Tradi
tion and Transforming No. 1 are
less interesting because detail
has been sacrificed for larger
and more uniform shapes which
are constantly repeated. This
tendency is especially apparent
in Transforming No. 1, which is
all oil except for a few pieces
of paper glued on.
Her more obviously religious
pictures, Crucifixion and Black
Madonna, also sacrifice a subtle
ty for a more obvious clarity.
Although the background tex
ture and design of Black Ma
donna is beautifully done, I can
not stop feeling that Keane did
the huge, perfectly round, sor
rowful eyes.
Miss Jenkins was first known
as a mosaicist and there are four
in the current show. Virgin of

the Sea indicates again the
wealth of detail she can create
by using in this case stones,
glass, tile, sticks and shells.
Viewed up close it also reveals a
tendency towards a decorative
abstraction (fully seen in Blue
Crystal), a superficial prettiness
which she lapses into in such
collages as Fruit of the Womb
and Pot of Meal. But once again
the static, abstract pattern can
give way to the graceful, un
dulating movement of the Virgin
of the Day, in which the sections
of the mosaic seem to be mov
ing in broad arcs and the rich
ness of the background detail
serves only to augment the over
all effect.

Other current exhibits include
45 contemporary prints by art
ists in a show assembled by the
Museum of Modern Art in New
York and now at the Foothill
College Library in Los Altos. At
the San Francisco Museum of
Art, Civic Center: A 1 Held:
Paintings (1961-1967), through
Feb. 25; Sosaku-Hanga: Modern
Japanese Prints, through Feb.
25; and the Vienna School of
Fantastic Realism, an exhibit of
the most important movement
in postwar Austria, through
March 3. The Triumph of Real
ism, 100 paintings from Euro
pean and American museums
from the second half of the
nineteenth century, will open
Feb. 17 at the Legion of Honor
in Lincoln Park. And Treasures
of the Lowie Museum at the

Lowie Museum of Anthropology,
Cal Berkeley.
An exhibit entitled "Sculpture
in Today's Environment" is be
ing shown at the San Jose Art
Gallery. The works utilize new
ly developed industrial materials
and are planned to involve ali
the senses of the viewer — sight,
touch, and sound.
The pieces involved were de
signed and constructed by ad
vanced students of Henry Pow
ers, who has created a number
of architectural works in the
San Francisco Bay Area. In this
exhibit, which runs through Feb
ruary 23, strong lightweight ma
terials form permanent, durable
works which can be integrated
into an architectural environ
ment with great economy of
means.
The works were designed for
placement in such places as
lobbies, courtyards, and foyers,
and they can even act as part
of the structure of columns, wall
sections, and pilasters. They are
made of materials provided by
technology — foamed plastics,
epoxy adhesives, surface coat
ings, and casting and laminating
resins.
Group Show #2 opens today
at the Capper's Gallery, 554 Mis
sion St., San Francisco. This ex
hibit will feature original prints
by H. Breger, Kadish, Kasten,
Leveton, March, and Oliveira.
Also, Pesl, Schroeder, Takal,
Tamkin, and Yunkers. Group
Show #2 will be open through
March 20.
