Leafing through the moun
tains of paraphanalia that some
how seem to descend upon our
shoulders, it appears that this
week will be more sedate, en
tertainment-wise, than previous
ones. However, the highlight of
the week will undoubtedly be the
West Bay Opera Company's am
bitious undertaking, The Flying
Dutchman, by Richard Wagner.
The West Bay has been known
to produce good quality shows,
last quarter's Madame Butterfly,
for example. It will be playing
at the Community Theatre in
Palo Alto this evening and to
morrow evening at 8:15 and on
Sunday at 2:00 and 7:30. For
students, tickets are a dollar and
a half and can be purchased
at the West Bay Box Office.
If you have enough gas in
your car, we suggest this eve
ning's performance at War Me
morial Opera House. The inter
nationally acclaimed conductor,
Hans Schmidt - Isserstedt, will
be at the helm of the San Fran
cisco Symphony's concert fea
turing Haydn's Symphony #102,
Henze's Second Suite from On
dlne, and concluding with Sibe
lius' Symphony #1. It starts at
8:30 and would be well worth the
trek to the City.
ACT announces the West
Coast premiere of An Evening's
Frost, a play by the poet Donald
Hall which is based upon the
conversations, correspondence,
and poems of Frost. It will join
the repertory on February 20,
Tuesday, at the Marine's Me
morial Theatre. This evening at
the Geary Theatre is The Cru
cible, by Arthur Miller and to
morrow also at the Geary The
atre is Molidre's Tartuffe, both
starting at the usual 8:30.
As long as you are in the
City, the talented Group Show
#2 is now featuring recent orig
inal prints by a motley group
ranging from Kadish to Yunk
ers at Capper's Gallery, 544 Mis
sion Street through March 20.
Nine to five daily, except Sun
day.
More locally, there is much
for the adventurer. Take, for
instance. The Stepping Sisters, a
three-act comedy tonight and
tomorrow at 8:15 in Los Gatos
at the Old Town Theatre. Or,
in Saratoga, Under the Yum-
Yum Tree is playing at the
King Dodo Theatre, starting at
8:30. At the San Jose State Col
lege Art Gallery, (9th and San
Carlos Sts.) an exhibition called
"Sculpture in Today's Environ
ment" will be shown through
February 23rd.
One more point of interest.
She's called Yukiko and she's a
popular Japanese songstress.
She will be singing in the Rick
shaw Lounge in Miyako Hotel
in San Francisco's Japanese Cul
tural Trade Center (Post and La
guna). Three shows between
9:15 and 1:45 for the next two
weeks. Hope you can find it. If
you can't, don't forget the West
Bay.

"Youth of America," of Ex
po '67 fame, will be presenting
a benefit show at The Circle
Star Theater Monday night. Pro
ceeds from the variety show go
to the S.F. Children's Hospital.
Tickets may be purchased at
Tresidder for special student
rates of $2.50, 3.75, 5.00, and 7.50.

The coming week is filled with
good movies, on campus, so that
none of us have to leave this

happy home of ours. At Cub
berley Saturday and Sunday
(from 8-11 p.m. and 3-11 p.m.)
THE FLICK is showing Peter
Watkins' The War Game, the
most powerful anti-war film we
have seen. Filmed in a pseudo
documentary style., it deals with
the breakdown of society after
the catastrophe of World War
111.
The Keio Committee is pre
senting The Island (Cubberley
7:30 and 10:00) by Kaneto Shi
do. The film tells the story of
a family that is struggling to
exist on a small hilly island that
is their home.
Passion of Joan of Arc, a
silent classic directed by Carl
Dreyer is at Tresidder Saturday
at 7:30, 8:30, 9:30 p.m.
The Stanford India Associa
tion is sponsoring Munna (Little
Boy) at Tresidder at 2:30 and
4:30, Sunday afternoon. Munna,
directed by K. A. Abbas, is in
Hindu dialog with English sub
titles.
And for comic relief there is
Woody Allen's What's Up Tiger
Lilly. The movie is a Japanese
James Bond thrill, r with an En
glish sound track of Mr. Allen's
creation, plus songs by the Lovin'
Spoonful, all combined for a
rather humorous film.

trek to the City.
ACT announces the West
Coast premiere of An Evening's

in Saratoga, Under the Yum-
Yum Tree is playing at the
King Dodo Theatre, starting at

"Youth of America," of Ex
po '67 fame, will be presenting
a benefit show at The Circle
Star Theater Monday night. Pro
ceeds from the variety show go
to the S.F. Children's Hospital.
Tickets may be purchased at
Tresidder for special student
rates of $2.50, 3.75, 5.00, and 7.50.

The coming week is filled with
good movies, on campus, so that
none of us have to leave this

happy home of ours. At Cub
berley Saturday and Sunday
(from 8-11 p.m. and 3-11 p.m.)
THE FLICK is showing Peter
Watkins' The War Game, the
most powerful anti-war film we
have seen. Filmed in a pseudo
documentary style., it deals with
the breakdown of society after
the catastrophe of World War
111.
The Keio Committee is pre
senting The Island (Cubberley
7:30 and 10:00) by Kaneto Shi
do. The film tells the story of
a family that is struggling to
exist on a small hilly island that
is their home.
Passion of Joan of Arc, a
silent classic directed by Carl
Dreyer is at Tresidder Saturday
at 7:30, 8:30, 9:30 p.m.
The Stanford India Associa
tion is sponsoring Munna (Little
Boy) at Tresidder at 2:30 and
4:30, Sunday afternoon. Munna,
directed by K. A. Abbas, is in
Hindu dialog with English sub
titles.
And for comic relief there is
Woody Allen's What's Up Tiger
Lilly. The movie is a Japanese
James Bond thrill, r with an En
glish sound track of Mr. Allen's
creation, plus songs by the Lovin'
Spoonful, all combined for a
rather humorous film.
Leafing through the moun
tains of paraphanalia that some
how seem to descend upon our
shoulders, it appears that this
week will be more sedate, en
tertainment-wise, than previous
ones. However, the highlight of
the week will undoubtedly be the
West Bay Opera Company's am
bitious undertaking, The Flying
Dutchman, by Richard Wagner.
The West Bay has been known
to produce good quality shows,
last quarter's Madame Butterfly,
for example. It will be playing
at the Community Theatre in
Palo Alto this evening and to
morrow evening at 8:15 and on
Sunday at 2:00 and 7:30. For
students, tickets are a dollar and
a half and can be purchased
at the West Bay Box Office.
If you have enough gas in
your car, we suggest this eve
ning's performance at War Me
morial Opera House. The inter
nationally acclaimed conductor,
Hans Schmidt - Isserstedt, will
be at the helm of the San Fran
cisco Symphony's concert fea
turing Haydn's Symphony #102,
Henze's Second Suite from On
dlne, and concluding with Sibe
lius' Symphony #1. It starts at

lege Art Gallery, (9th and San

ceeds from the variety show go

The coming week is filled with
good movies, on campus, so that
none of us have to leave this

happy home of ours. At Cub
berley Saturday and Sunday
(from 8-11 p.m. and 3-11 p.m.)
THE FLICK is showing Peter
Watkins' The War Game, the
most powerful anti-war film we
have seen. Filmed in a pseudo
documentary style., it deals with
the breakdown of society after
the catastrophe of World War
111.
The Keio Committee is pre
senting The Island (Cubberley
7:30 and 10:00) by Kaneto Shi
do. The film tells the story of
a family that is struggling to
exist on a small hilly island that
is their home.
Passion of Joan of Arc, a
silent classic directed by Carl
Dreyer is at Tresidder Saturday
at 7:30, 8:30, 9:30 p.m.
The Stanford India Associa
tion is sponsoring Munna (Little
Boy) at Tresidder at 2:30 and
4:30, Sunday afternoon. Munna,
directed by K. A. Abbas, is in
Hindu dialog with English sub
titles.
And for comic relief there is
Woody Allen's What's Up Tiger
Lilly. The movie is a Japanese
James Bond thrill, r with an En
glish sound track of Mr. Allen's
creation, plus songs by the Lovin'
Spoonful, all combined for a
rather humorous film.
Leafing through the moun
tains of paraphanalia that some
how seem to descend upon our
shoulders, it appears that this
week will be more sedate, en
tertainment-wise, than previous
ones. However, the highlight of
the week will undoubtedly be the
West Bay Opera Company's am
bitious undertaking, The Flying
Dutchman, by Richard Wagner.
The West Bay has been known
to produce good quality shows,
last quarter's Madame Butterfly,
for example. It will be playing
at the Community Theatre in
Palo Alto this evening and to
morrow evening at 8:15 and on
Sunday at 2:00 and 7:30. For
students, tickets are a dollar and
a half and can be purchased
at the West Bay Box Office.
If you have enough gas in
your car, we suggest this eve
ning's performance at War Me
morial Opera House. The inter
nationally acclaimed conductor,
Hans Schmidt - Isserstedt, will
be at the helm of the San Fran
cisco Symphony's concert fea
turing Haydn's Symphony #102,
Henze's Second Suite from On
dlne, and concluding with Sibe
lius' Symphony #1. It starts at
8:30 and would be well worth the
trek to the City.
ACT announces the West
Coast premiere of An Evening's
Frost, a play by the poet Donald
Hall which is based upon the
conversations, correspondence,
and poems of Frost. It will join
the repertory on February 20,
Tuesday, at the Marine's Me
morial Theatre. This evening at
the Geary Theatre is The Cru
cible, by Arthur Miller and to
morrow also at the Geary The
atre is Molidre's Tartuffe, both
starting at the usual 8:30.
As long as you are in the
City, the talented Group Show
#2 is now featuring recent orig
inal prints by a motley group
ranging from Kadish to Yunk
ers at Capper's Gallery, 544 Mis
sion Street through March 20.
Nine to five daily, except Sun
day.
More locally, there is much
for the adventurer. Take, for
instance. The Stepping Sisters, a
three-act comedy tonight and
tomorrow at 8:15 in Los Gatos
at the Old Town Theatre. Or,
in Saratoga, Under the Yum-
Yum Tree is playing at the
King Dodo Theatre, starting at
8:30. At the San Jose State Col
lege Art Gallery, (9th and San
