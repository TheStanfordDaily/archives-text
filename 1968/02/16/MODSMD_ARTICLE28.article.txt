# Placement Service Evolves
## 
### GENIE KREYCHE 
Evolving into a career plan
ning service from a "mail order
house" is the current goal of
the University Placement Ser
vice and its director, Ralph W.
Keller.
The first step must be a
change in operation methods.
Keller has recommended con
version of the present "basically
inefficient" system to an elec
tronic operation that would al
low more time for counseling
and career planning.
The current program offered
to Stanford students and alumni
focuses on coordinating inter
views between students and
prospective employers as well
as handling student employ
ment on campus. Keller feels
that his staff's effectiveness is
severely limited by large
amounts of paperwork.
"The size of our job here
Is Indicated by the 30,000 no
tices of position vacancies we
receive, 15,000 placement pa
pers to file, some 750 organ
izations who send representa
tives here and the 8,000 sets
of papers we prepare for in
terviews each year," explained
Keller.
"Our. basic problem is the
limited budget. The University
supports our plans to expand
the planning aspect of our ser
vice as far as it is financially
able," the director said.
There are other problems to
be overcome before the Place
ment Service can become an
"integral part of the education
al process," according to Keller.
One is the fact that most stu
dents do not come to the ser
vice before their senior year.
"Ideally we would like to
make contact with incoming
freshmen during pre-registra
tion," Keller said. "Although
there does seem to be a growing
number of students who are
learning about the Placement
Service, they generally don't
come early enough."
Many students have assumed
that the Placement Service
works closely with the Counsel
ing and Testing Office. How
ever, according to Keller, his
office in essence takes up where
Counseling and Testing leaves
off.
"Their job is to identify to
the student his interests and

abilities. We expand on this by
considering a student's aptitude,
interest and curiousity in pre
senting career suggestions. Stan
ford students tend to have a
wide variety of interests and
our staff encourages a student
to be adventuresome in choos
ing a career."
Only seniors and graduate
students are eligible to sign
up for interviews for permanent
positions. The average senior
goes to 15 interviews. "If there
is a mutual interest between the
representative and the inter
viewee they usually arrange for
subsequent meetings generally
at the place of employment," he
said.
According to the director,
Stanford students have gained
insights the careers in
their respective fields from con
tact with their professors and
are capable of building "good
rapport" during interviews. "We
make a point to collect student
feedback about particular in
terviewers," he said.
Keller feels that his office is
successful in assisting students.
However, Ralph Kimball, engi
neering graduate student, spoke
for other students saying, "I
think the Placement Service is
more helpful for students who
haven't decided on a career. I
think I have a better chance
for employment if I seek out
the companies on my own."
Commenting on the contro
versial recruitment by Dow
Chemical Company and the
CIA, Keller emphasized that
the Placement Service "exist 9
to provide a service for stu

dents" and "adheres to the
University's policy by feeling
a responsibility to see that
students have the right to seek
out employment opportuni
ties with any organization.
"Besides, Dow Chemical is
such a big operation that chances
are that an employee would be
involved with something bene
ficial to humanity," he continued.
"We aren't here to decide is
sues or to question motives.
There were students who signed
interview schedule lists who
didn't appear to be interested in
employment with the CIA but
we didn't keep them from hav
ing an interview," he stated.
Keller heads a staff of 17
counselors and office workers.
The counseling staff consists of
William Whitsett, director of
engineering and science place
ment; Edmond Mantani, director
of college and university place
ment; Mrs. Ellen Schneider, di
rector of teacher placement;
Mrs. Barbara Cochran, director
of student employment; and
Miss Carroll A. Rudy, secretary
for summer employment.
"Our counselors, while not
trained psychologists, are ex
perts in terms of their knowl
edge of opportunities and
trends. We are here to be help
ful and not to win arguments,"
Keller explained.
To aid in analysis, the ser
vice personnel talk with the com
pany interviewers and keep up
with information in business
publications.
Other divisions of the Place
ment Service are designed for
summer employment and st

dent part-time positions. General
information and specific listings
of opportunities, as well as
schedules for interviews, are
provided for students, student
wives, and other dependents.
Additional placement services
are also available on campus.
The School of Law operates a
separate placement office for its
students and alumni. The Gra
duate School of Business also
offers placement service to those
who hold or are candidates for
the Master of Business Admini
stration.
