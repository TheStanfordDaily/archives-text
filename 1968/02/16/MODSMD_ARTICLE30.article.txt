## 'Greasepaint': Ram's Head Hit 
### THOMAS STOCKFISCH 
An enjoyable evening is avail
able at the Nitery, where Ram's
Head is presenting "The Roar of
the Greasepaint — The Smell
of the Crowd."
This Leslie Bricusse-Anthony
Newley musical is concerned
with the games played by Sir,
a tattered remnant of the aris
tocracy, and Cocky, a pitiful
groveler. The stakes range from
bread to love. Since Sir is mak
ing up the rules as he goes
along, Cocky is the guaranteed
loser.
While Cocky Is forced to trans
cribe the newly-invented rules
in a huge notebook, Sir lectures
his partisan, Kid, on the les
sons to be learned from these
games. A chorus of grimy fe
male urchins observes the
events.
In the second act, Cocky sees
through the game, loses faith
in Sir, wins the sympathy of
Kid and the urchins, and even
tually resolves to seek a new be
ginning. The play is unduly long.
The humor is strained at times,
but provides for both good mu
sic and good fun.
Stanford Repertory Theater
actor Glenn Cannon is well cast
as the underdog Cocky. Al
though his accent is inconsis
tent and his voice is not ade

quate for the singing demands
of the role, Cannon has numer
ous moments which can only
be described as honest. His rend
ering of "The Joker," "Who Can
I Turn To", and "Sweet Begin
ning" are convincing and mov
ing.
Director Stephen Jay Book, a
Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.)
has drawn from Cannon a far
better performance than any I
have seen this actor turn in at
SRT.
In contrast Carrillo Gantner,
also an M.F.A. student, is too
much the poseur as Sir. He con
veys the character's cruelty
well, but does not succeed in
winning much sympathy.
As Kid, Heather Ferguson is
absolutely lovable. With a
bright-eyed, open-face, rem|ini
scent of prelapsarian Judy Gar
land, Miss Ferguson has a capti
vating presence. Her scurrying
about is a joy to watch.
Stuart Ockman sings well as
the Negro. The set by Robert
Morgan and choreography by
Susan Gay serve well, as does
the orchestra directed by Errol
Gay .although it is at times too
loud for both the Nitery and
the voices in the cast.
Remaining performances are
at 7:30 and 10:30 tonight and to
morrow.

ous moments which can only
be described as honest. His rend
ering of "The Joker," "Who Can
I Turn To", and "Sweet Begin
ning" are convincing and mov
ing.
Director Stephen Jay Book, a
Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.)
has drawn from Cannon a far
better performance than any I
have seen this actor turn in at
SRT.
In contrast Carrillo Gantner,
also an M.F.A. student, is too
much the poseur as Sir. He con
veys the character's cruelty
well, but does not succeed in
winning much sympathy.
As Kid, Heather Ferguson is
absolutely lovable. With a
bright-eyed, open-face, rem|ini
scent of prelapsarian Judy Gar
land, Miss Ferguson has a capti
vating presence. Her scurrying
about is a joy to watch.
Stuart Ockman sings well as
the Negro. The set by Robert
Morgan and choreography by
Susan Gay serve well, as does
the orchestra directed by Errol
Gay .although it is at times too
loud for both the Nitery and
the voices in the cast.
Remaining performances are
at 7:30 and 10:30 tonight and to
morrow.
An enjoyable evening is avail
able at the Nitery, where Ram's
Head is presenting "The Roar of
the Greasepaint — The Smell
of the Crowd."
This Leslie Bricusse-Anthony
Newley musical is concerned
with the games played by Sir,
a tattered remnant of the aris
tocracy, and Cocky, a pitiful
groveler. The stakes range from
bread to love. Since Sir is mak
ing up the rules as he goes
along, Cocky is the guaranteed
loser.
While Cocky Is forced to trans
cribe the newly-invented rules
in a huge notebook, Sir lectures
his partisan, Kid, on the les
sons to be learned from these
games. A chorus of grimy fe
male urchins observes the
events.
In the second act, Cocky sees
through the game, loses faith
in Sir, wins the sympathy of
Kid and the urchins, and even
tually resolves to seek a new be
ginning. The play is unduly long.
The humor is strained at times,
but provides for both good mu
sic and good fun.
Stanford Repertory Theater
actor Glenn Cannon is well cast
as the underdog Cocky. Al
though his accent is inconsis
tent and his voice is not ade

quate for the singing demands
of the role, Cannon has numer
ous moments which can only
be described as honest. His rend
ering of "The Joker," "Who Can
I Turn To", and "Sweet Begin
ning" are convincing and mov
ing.
