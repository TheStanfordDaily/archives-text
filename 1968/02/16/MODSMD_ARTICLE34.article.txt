### JERRY FOGEL 
The Juilliard String Quartet,
one of the finest chamber music
groups in this country, since
1946, demonstrated uncommon
emotional sensitivity and tech
nical finesse in an outstanding
concert before a capacity audi
ence i"n Dinkelspiel Auditorium
Wednesday night.
Using a varied program of
Haydn, Bartok, and Beethoven
to showcase their talents, the
four musicians were able to
achieve a smooth, mellow blend
while retaining their individual
identities. First violinist Robert
Mann captivated his listeners
with dramatic gestures and in
tense physical involvement with
his music. Cellist Claus Adam
was even more notable for his
serene, understated appearance
during slower movements.
The highlight of the pro
gram was a remarkable ren

dering of Bartok's "Fourth
Quartet." Many In the audi
ence reacted Instinctively to
the dissonant, often Incongru
ous feeling 1 created by the mu
sic, but the group's technical
skill and the zeal with which
all four artists attacked the
piece brought even the most
confirmed foes of Bar to k
around. The fourth movement,
an allegretto played Pizzicato
In its entirety, was superb.
Alter intermission the Quar
tet performed Beethoven's com
plex "Opus 131" in C sharp mi
nor. First violinist Mann was
inspired and inspiring. The
group again demonstrated its
rare sensitivity, treating the
searching themes almost reli
giously. The audience, visibly
moved, refused to let the Quar
tet leave the stage, calling the
four back repeatedly as more
and more listeners rose to ex
press their admiration.
