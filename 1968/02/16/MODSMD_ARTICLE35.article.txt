Commenting on the publish
or-perish debate of universities,
Prof. Nevitt Sanford, a Stanford
psychologist, suggests colleges
need a new form of birth con
trolâ€”for. books.
Endorsing the "birth-of-the
book" control, humorously ad
vanced by others, Sanford sees
this as an action necessary soon
to "limit the outpouring of spe
cialized and often trivial publi
cations that, even now, all but
inundate the offices of every ac
ademic man."
Sanford prophesies the crea
tion of a campus attitude which
considers publishing in bad
form. "The most prestigeful col
leges will begin by making r.ules
forbidding their professors to
publish until they have been on
the faculty five to ten years," he
said. An exception, which San
ford predicts, is the case of TV
appearances. Through this me
dium, a scientist or scholar
would come directly before the
public with something he be
lieves to be important.
Sanfor.d's speculations were
made at a Notre Dame sympo
sium on "The University in a
Developing World Society." San
ford received an honorary doc
tor of laws degree from Notre
Dame for his contributions to
American higher education.
Sanford is an editor, and author
of six books and over 100 pro
fessional articles.
