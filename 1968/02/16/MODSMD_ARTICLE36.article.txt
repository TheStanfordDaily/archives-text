Tonight's Japanese Festival Film, THE ISLAND, by Kancto Shin
do, is highlighted by a lack of dialog. The only sounds are natural
movements, occasional laughs or sobs, and background music.
This example of the "modern school" of Japanese cinema portrays
a single family's struggles for survival as the sole inhabitants of
a small island. Father and son, pictured above, are two of the
four principal characters. The film will be shown in Cubberley
Auditorium at 7:30 and 10.
