# Will History Repeat Itself? Dallmar, Indians Hope So
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford's Indians will be
hoping to make it two stiaight
over Washington University to
morrow night, when they take
on the Huskies at 8 p.m. in Se
attle. Monday the Indians jour
ney to Washington State to bat
tle the rugged Cougars.
The Tribe (8-10 overall) uti
lized a great outside shooting
and a pronounced rebounding
advantage in routing Washing
ton 97-75 last Saturday in the
Stanford Pavilion. The previous
evening Coach Howie Dallmar's
club dropped a tough 74-71 de
cision to a much taller WSU op
ponent.
The split last weekend en
abled Stanford to climb into
fifth place in Pacific-8 standings
with a 2-4 mark. Victories over
Washington (2-5) Saturday and
a WSU (4-3) Monday would
even both the Tribe's conference
and overall record.
Tomorrow night Coach Dall
mar will be hoping for the
same type of performance
that tamed the Huskies last
week. The Indians shot 55 per
cent from the floor and out
rebounded Washington 56-32

in scoring their highest point
total of the season.
"It was our best second half
of the year," Dallmar noted, re
ferring to the 58-point output
against the Huskies. "Chuck
Moore played a great game,"
the Tribe mentor continued. "He
scored well (16 points) and did
a great job on Dave Carr, their
leading scorer." Dallmar indi
cated that while Moore will not
start tomorrow night, "he'll see
plenty of action."
With ace guard Don Griffin
finally out of his shooting
slump, Moore showing signs of
realizing his excellent potential,
Ar,t Harris and Gary Peters
meyer continuing their fine all
around play, and Mai McElwain
and Steve Kuchenbecker re
bounding aggressively, the
Tribe will go into tomorrow
night's game as the favorite.
Washington coach Mac
Duckworth, disappointed with
his team's losses to Stanford
and Cal last week, may make
some changes in his sopho
more-studded lineup when the
Huskies host the same Cali
fornia opponents this week
end.

"We have to enhance our
board strength and our de
fense," Duckworth commented
after the Huskies' winless road
trip, "and in order to do that
we're going to have to change
the lineup." The Washington
mentor failed to elaborate on
where the changes would occur.
One of the switches may be
at the guard position, where
sophomores Rafael Stone and
Doug West failed to produce
last weekend. Sophomore Pat
Woolcock, who played well de
fensively and scored 13 points
in 17 minutes of action against
Stanford, may get the starting
nod tomorrow.
Forwards Carr and George
Irvine, the Huskies' two leading
scorers, will probably retain
their starting assignments.
There may be a change at cen
ter, since 6-9, 220-pound sopho
more Jay Bond was outmuscled
on the boards last weekend by
Stanford's McElwain and Ku
chonbeckor„ Despite having a
substantial height and weight
advantage, Bond coralled only
five rebounds to 16 for McEl
wain and 9 for Kuchenbecker.

board strength and our de
fense," Duckworth commented
after the Huskies' winless road
trip, "and in order to do that
we're going to have to change
the lineup." The Washington
mentor failed to elaborate on
where the changes would occur.
One of the switches may be
at the guard position, where
sophomores Rafael Stone and
Doug West failed to produce
last weekend. Sophomore Pat
Woolcock, who played well de
fensively and scored 13 points
in 17 minutes of action against
Stanford, may get the starting
nod tomorrow.
Forwards Carr and George
Irvine, the Huskies' two leading
scorers, will probably retain
their starting assignments.
There may be a change at cen
ter, since 6-9, 220-pound sopho
more Jay Bond was outmuscled
on the boards last weekend by
Stanford's McElwain and Ku
chonbeckor„ Despite having a
substantial height and weight
advantage, Bond coralled only
five rebounds to 16 for McEl
wain and 9 for Kuchenbecker.
Stanford's Indians will be
hoping to make it two stiaight
over Washington University to
morrow night, when they take
on the Huskies at 8 p.m. in Se
attle. Monday the Indians jour
ney to Washington State to bat
tle the rugged Cougars.
The Tribe (8-10 overall) uti
lized a great outside shooting
and a pronounced rebounding
advantage in routing Washing
ton 97-75 last Saturday in the
Stanford Pavilion. The previous
evening Coach Howie Dallmar's
club dropped a tough 74-71 de
cision to a much taller WSU op
ponent.
The split last weekend en
abled Stanford to climb into
fifth place in Pacific-8 standings
with a 2-4 mark. Victories over
Washington (2-5) Saturday and
a WSU (4-3) Monday would
even both the Tribe's conference
and overall record.
Tomorrow night Coach Dall
mar will be hoping for the
same type of performance
that tamed the Huskies last
week. The Indians shot 55 per
cent from the floor and out
rebounded Washington 56-32

in scoring their highest point
total of the season.
"It was our best second half
of the year," Dallmar noted, re
ferring to the 58-point output
against the Huskies. "Chuck
Moore played a great game,"
the Tribe mentor continued. "He
scored well (16 points) and did
a great job on Dave Carr, their
leading scorer." Dallmar indi
cated that while Moore will not
start tomorrow night, "he'll see
plenty of action."
With ace guard Don Griffin
finally out of his shooting
slump, Moore showing signs of
realizing his excellent potential,
Ar,t Harris and Gary Peters
meyer continuing their fine all
around play, and Mai McElwain
and Steve Kuchenbecker re
bounding aggressively, the
Tribe will go into tomorrow
night's game as the favorite.
Washington coach Mac
Duckworth, disappointed with
his team's losses to Stanford
and Cal last week, may make
some changes in his sopho
more-studded lineup when the
Huskies host the same Cali
fornia opponents this week
end.
