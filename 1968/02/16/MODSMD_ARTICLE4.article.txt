# Esalen Head Urges 'Effective Education'
## 
### VICKI GRAHAM 
A Department of Effective Ed
uation should be instituted at
Stanford to explore the scope of
the non-intellectual human po
tential, said Michael Murphy, co
founder and president of Esa
len Institute, last night.
Murphy, a 1952 Stanford grad
uate in psychology, spoke as
part of the Century 21 series. He
addressed a Cubberley Auditor
ium crowd, which he said looked
like "Old Home Week."
The focus of his talk was a
domain of the human func
tion, the domain of effective
feeling and emotion beyond
that considered by religion and
psychotherapy.
He said that the domain, vari
ously called "humanic arts" or
"the non-verbal humanities," can
be educated "in a free flow of
Eastern wisdom and sophisti

cated Western research with a
flexible empirical method."
Education in the West, he said,
has trained the intellect and ne
glected interpersonal communi
cation which has traditionally
been left to the family and to
religion.
"The psychological specificity
which is the aim of conventional
education, may actually swindle
us out of our vital but untrained
capacities to feel and to control
our mental states," said Mur
phy.
He said the time is ripe for
the inclusion of personal and
interpersonal education at all ed
ucational levels, from grade
school to the university.
The education of this effec
tive domain, the work of Esa
len Institute, would bring to
bear clinical research and psy
chology as well as physical
exercise and the arts.
Murphy sketched out the field
of the effective domain and em
phasized the great number of
new and independent research
projects in this pioneer area.
He divided the domain into
roughly three areas: the senses
and physiological responses; in
terpersonal relations; and the
internal personal state of emo
tion, dreams, and fantasies.
Much work is being done in
the area of sensory awareness,
he said. Some researchers feel
that there is actually a "bodily
spontaneity," a poise which any
one can achieve by recognizing
its points of strain and tension.
Certain exercises can help one
to reach this equilibrium, Mur
phy claimed.
Others, he said, believe in a
correlation between physical pos
ture and personality. In some
positions people are more recep

tive to certain emotions than to
others.
Esalen Institute uses many
exercises to breAk down the
character armor that many
people have built up, and to
release a richness of emotion.
"A stranger, stumbling into
Esalen was shocked by what ap
peared to be Heronimous Bosch's
Garden of Earthly Delights,"
said Murphy. He quickly stumb
led out again.
Payton Jordan, Stanford's
track coach, is also interested in
sensory awareness techniques,
and has done some very crea
tive work, said Murphy.
In the area of interpersonal
relations, said Murphy, research
ers have been able to identify
those with natural capacities as
therapists.
Sensivity training and encount
er groups are used by many
people to get away from intel
lectual entanglement and to help
them perceive things about each
other. Businessmen and State
Department officials are also in
terested in these groups.
In researching internal states
of mind, Murphy said that re
searchers have trained people to
meditate effectively, something
yogis have been doing for thou
sands of years. Meditation is
something that is usually only
achieved through years of prac
tice, he commented.

domain of the human func
tion, the domain of effective
feeling and emotion beyond
that considered by religion and
psychotherapy.
He said that the domain, vari
ously called "humanic arts" or
"the non-verbal humanities," can
be educated "in a free flow of
Eastern wisdom and sophisti

cated Western research with a
flexible empirical method."
Education in the West, he said,
has trained the intellect and ne
glected interpersonal communi
cation which has traditionally
been left to the family and to
religion.
"The psychological specificity
which is the aim of conventional
education, may actually swindle
us out of our vital but untrained
capacities to feel and to control
our mental states," said Mur
phy.
He said the time is ripe for
the inclusion of personal and
interpersonal education at all ed
ucational levels, from grade
school to the university.
The education of this effec
tive domain, the work of Esa
len Institute, would bring to
bear clinical research and psy
chology as well as physical
exercise and the arts.
Murphy sketched out the field
of the effective domain and em
phasized the great number of
new and independent research
projects in this pioneer area.
He divided the domain into
roughly three areas: the senses
and physiological responses; in
terpersonal relations; and the
internal personal state of emo
tion, dreams, and fantasies.
Much work is being done in
the area of sensory awareness,
he said. Some researchers feel
that there is actually a "bodily
spontaneity," a poise which any
one can achieve by recognizing
its points of strain and tension.
Certain exercises can help one
to reach this equilibrium, Mur
phy claimed.
Others, he said, believe in a
correlation between physical pos
ture and personality. In some
positions people are more recep

tive to certain emotions than to
others.
Esalen Institute uses many
exercises to breAk down the
character armor that many
people have built up, and to
release a richness of emotion.
"A stranger, stumbling into
Esalen was shocked by what ap
peared to be Heronimous Bosch's
Garden of Earthly Delights,"
said Murphy. He quickly stumb
led out again.
Payton Jordan, Stanford's
track coach, is also interested in
sensory awareness techniques,
and has done some very crea
tive work, said Murphy.
In the area of interpersonal
relations, said Murphy, research
ers have been able to identify
those with natural capacities as
therapists.
Sensivity training and encount
er groups are used by many
people to get away from intel
lectual entanglement and to help
them perceive things about each
other. Businessmen and State
Department officials are also in
terested in these groups.
In researching internal states
of mind, Murphy said that re
searchers have trained people to
meditate effectively, something
yogis have been doing for thou
sands of years. Meditation is
something that is usually only
achieved through years of prac
tice, he commented.
A Department of Effective Ed
uation should be instituted at
Stanford to explore the scope of
the non-intellectual human po
tential, said Michael Murphy, co
founder and president of Esa
len Institute, last night.
Murphy, a 1952 Stanford grad
uate in psychology, spoke as
part of the Century 21 series. He
addressed a Cubberley Auditor
ium crowd, which he said looked
like "Old Home Week."
The focus of his talk was a
domain of the human func
tion, the domain of effective
feeling and emotion beyond
that considered by religion and
psychotherapy.
