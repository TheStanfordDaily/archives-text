# Varsity-Frosh Track Runoff
## 
### BOB RUND 
"I'll take the varsity and give
you eleven."
"A buck says the freshmen
wipe up."
No, it's not a bookie joint, but
Angell Field, the practice area
for the Stanford track team.
The proposition in question
is tomorrow's annual varsity
frosh track meet. The event will
get under way at 10 a.m. in the
stadium.
Normally the elder varsity
members would pass off such
brashness as merely the over-in
flated egos of green freshmen,
but to make things interesting
Coach Pay ton Jordan has de
cided to add to the highly-tal
ented frosh some other newcom
ers to the Stanford teamâ€”foot
bailers Tom Massey, Gene
Washington, and Tom Colby.
Massey, who has high-jumped
6 ft. 8 in. and triple jumped
48 ft. 11 in., is expected to vie
with Peter Boyce, Stanford rec
ord holder at 7 ft., and lan Ar
nold, seventh - place finisher in
the triple jump in the Pan-Am
games.
The two jumps would prob
ably be sufficient to keep most
athletes busy, but not Massey
who will probably compete for
places in the long jump, high
hurdles, and javelin as well as
running a leg on one of the
relays for. the frosh team.
Speedy Gene Washington,
Stanford's all - conference end,
should give varsity team mem
bers Roger Cox, Russ Taplin,
and Andy Sears all the compe
tition they can handle in the
sprints.
Backing up Washington in the
sprints for the frosh will be 9.6
Canadian freshman sprinter.
Charles Francis and Kevin Mc-
Nair, a 9.8 sprinter.
In the hurdles the frosh
should have their own way with
freshman star Rick Tipton, who
has already beaten one of the
nation's best indoor hurdlers in
the highs and Randy White in
the intermediates.
In the weight events things
look much brighter, for the var
sity with Big Dave Harrington,
boxer Chuck Schembra, and
Dick Warwick leading the way.
The outcome of the meet will

come down to the distance
events where the two teams ap
pear to be equal.
Greg Brock, Stanford's top
harrier, will have an easy time
with the two-mile, but will prob
ably be followed across the line
by two freshmen, Don Kardong
and Mark Jones.
Hawaiian State mile and 880
champ Duncan Mac Donald
should win the mile for the
frosh, but varsity runners
Brook Thomas and Chuck Menz
could make this one of the tight
est races of the meet.
In the 880-yard race froshman
Pete Fairchild, who was the

runner - up in the California
State high school meet, will
challenge senior Mike Jacobs
Jacobs, who is expecting a
tough race, has been trying to
psych out Fairchild all week.
Tuesday Jacobs informed Fair
child that he would be easy on
him because he was probablv
going through the deep psycho
social trauma generally associ
ated with freshman identity
crises.
On paper the relays will be
split, with the frosh winning the
440-yard race and the varsity
the mile relay.
Do I hear any bets?
