# Black Nationalist Asks 'Cultural Revolution'
## 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
Black nationalism came to
campus yesterday in the form
of Ron Karenga, who spoke on
the need of a separate culture
for blacks, and the form such
a culture should take.
"You must have a cultural
revolution before the violent rev
olution," the director of the "Us
Cultural Center" in Watts and
black power leader told a Dink
elspiel Auditorium audience in
a talk sponsored by the Black
Student Union and Tresidder Me
morial Union's program divi
sion.
Karenga made a distinction
between "black people" and
Negroes. To be a black per
son, according to Karenga, one
must have "color, culture, and
consciousness."
Color is simply the possession
of "the genetic heritage that is
black, like Africa. That is where
it all start d. It is necessary but
not sufficient," Karenga contin
ued "that black people are black
by color."
The second prerequisite, cul
ture, is seen "by the way we
look at things, by the food we
eat and the music we dig," he
said.
Consciousness, the other nec
essary quality, was defined by
Karenga as "the acceptance of
the fact that you are a distinct
people."
Karenga asserted that blacks
should have a "complete culture,
including their own value sys

tem." He said that the view of
the Negro culture as a sub-cul
ture of white American culture
implied that the Negro culture
was inferior.
Part of this black culture
would Involve the rejection of
Christianity, according to Ka
renga, because "Black people
can't believe a white man can
come to save them when he
did not have the strength to
pull himself off the cross."
Karenga called the 1965 riot
in Watts "not a riot, but a re
volt" because it had psycho
logical and political bases. Fur
thermore, he stated that such re
volts could be justified because
they are "pre-emptive self-defen
sive."
He used, as an analogy, the
Israeli action in the 1967 Arab-
Israoli war, where the Israelis
struck first.
Asked what the role of whites
should be in the black nation
alist movement, the UCLA grad
uate said their role, especially
that of students, "is three-fold:
non-intervention, foreign aid,
and the establishment of civiliz
ing committees."
Non-intervention, in Karenga's
terms, consists of a'lowing the
blacks to develop their own cul
ture. Foreign aid consists of
providing financial and technical
assistance "without strings."
Karenga said the Students
for a Democratic Society were
an example of a white group
that provided such assistance.

The "civilizing committees"
would devote their efforts to the
education of the whites as to the
natures of the black nationalist
movement and their goals, he
said.
In a press conference before
the talk, Karenga said that black
students at Stanford and other
universities "have a very im
portant role to play, that they
return to the community and
build the community up and not
have that escapist attitude that
they have had in the past, going
into the white community. Once
they get knowledge they should
communicate it to the black
community."
The Us Cultural Center was
created after the Watts riots in
1965 and is dedicated to the
development of black pride
through the study of Afro-Amer
ican history and Swahili. It is
open only to blacks.
Karenga formerly was asso
ciated with the Social Action
Training Center in Watts, which
prepared organizers for the
black and Spanish - American
communities. Now in his late
20's, Karenga majored in Swa
hili and sociology at UCLA.
Karenga listed seven qualities
inherent in a distinct black cul
ture. They are mythology, his
tory, social, economic and poli
tical organization, a creative mo
tif and ethos. The key, accord
ing to Karenga, is that the
blacks define for themselves a
separate frame of reference,
thus rmoving any dependence
on the white man.
