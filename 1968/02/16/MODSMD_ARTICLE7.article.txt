# To Increase Faculty Function
## New 'Senate' Proposal Ready 
### 
The constitution for a new
faculty legislature will be ready
for consideration by the Aca
demic Courier, "hopefully in two
weeks," according to Prof. Ken
neth J. Arrow, chairman of the
Council's Executive Committee.
"We're in the final stages of
drafting," Arrow said.
A special meeting of the Aca
demic Council will be called to
act upon the Executive Com
mittee's proposal for an "Aca
demic Senate" to supplant both
the Executive Committee and
the Council itself.
Arrow hopes the vote on
the Academic Senate constitu
tion will come before spring
quarter. Final approval would
have to come from the Board
of Trustees.
The Academic Senate idea
dates back to 1966. In a memor
andum sent to all faculty last
June, the Executive Committee

said "The essential motive for
the proposed change is that the
Executive Committee is too
small, the Academic Council too
large, to carry on effectively the
functions of faculty deliberation
and decision-making."
The Executive Committee
has nine elected memb rs. The
Academic Council, consisting of
all faculty with the rank of as
sistant professor or above, has
more than 940 members. Nor
mally it meets just three times
a year.
Instead the Executive Com
mittee is proposing that "an
intermediate sized institution,
referred to the Senate,
assume the basic functions of
the Academic Council, always
subject, however, to the ulti
mate control of the Academic
Council," according to the
memorandum.
The Academic Council ap

proved the idea in principle on
Sopt. 29.
A major issue in the drafting
of the Academic Senate consti
tution has been the method of
representation of various de
partments, according to Arrow.
The Senate will have about 60
members. Many departments
will have just one representa
tive.
Another question has been the
rrlationship between the Senate
and the Academic Council. Some
powers will remain with the
Council, but the Executive Com
mittee will be disbanded, accord
ing to the June memorandum.
Arrow believes a smaller, rep
resentative Academic Senate
would enable the faculty to ex
ert much greater power in Uni
versity decisions. Ho comments
that the unwieldy size of the
Academic Council prevents it
from carrying out effectively
the authority it now has.

A special meeting of the Aca
demic Council will be called to
act upon the Executive Com
mittee's proposal for an "Aca
demic Senate" to supplant both
the Executive Committee and
the Council itself.
Arrow hopes the vote on
the Academic Senate constitu
tion will come before spring
quarter. Final approval would
have to come from the Board
of Trustees.
The Academic Senate idea
dates back to 1966. In a memor
andum sent to all faculty last
June, the Executive Committee

said "The essential motive for
the proposed change is that the
Executive Committee is too
small, the Academic Council too
large, to carry on effectively the
functions of faculty deliberation
and decision-making."
The Executive Committee
has nine elected memb rs. The
Academic Council, consisting of
all faculty with the rank of as
sistant professor or above, has
more than 940 members. Nor
mally it meets just three times
a year.
Instead the Executive Com
mittee is proposing that "an
intermediate sized institution,
referred to the Senate,
assume the basic functions of
the Academic Council, always
subject, however, to the ulti
mate control of the Academic
Council," according to the
memorandum.
The Academic Council ap

proved the idea in principle on
Sopt. 29.
A major issue in the drafting
of the Academic Senate consti
tution has been the method of
representation of various de
partments, according to Arrow.
The Senate will have about 60
members. Many departments
will have just one representa
tive.
Another question has been the
rrlationship between the Senate
and the Academic Council. Some
powers will remain with the
Council, but the Executive Com
mittee will be disbanded, accord
ing to the June memorandum.
Arrow believes a smaller, rep
resentative Academic Senate
would enable the faculty to ex
ert much greater power in Uni
versity decisions. Ho comments
that the unwieldy size of the
Academic Council prevents it
from carrying out effectively
the authority it now has.


THOMAS V. JONES, president
and chief executive officer of
Northrup Corporation, Beverly
Hills, was elected to the Stan
ford Board of Trustees yester
day. Jones received an engineer
ing' degree from Stanford in
1942, and has been a director
of Stanford Research Institute
and member of the School of
Engineering Advisory. He Is a
California Institute of Techno
logy trustee, member of the
UCLA Art Council, and has been
a Stanford Associate since 1965.
The constitution for a new
faculty legislature will be ready
for consideration by the Aca
demic Courier, "hopefully in two
weeks," according to Prof. Ken
neth J. Arrow, chairman of the
Council's Executive Committee.
"We're in the final stages of
drafting," Arrow said.
