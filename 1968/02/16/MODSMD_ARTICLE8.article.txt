## New Israel-Jordan Clash 
### 
Israeli jet fighter - bombers
roared along the Jordan River
truce line, bombing and strafing
Jordanian positions for seven
hours Thursday night, before a
cease-fire ended the fiercest
fighting in the Middle East since
the six-day war in June. Kol Is
rael, the Tel Aviv radio, said
fighting stopped after Jordan
requested a cease-fire at 11 p.m.
A Jordanian military spokes
man announced later that Israe
li firing halted at 11:20 p.m. At
the fighting's height, an Israeli
spokesman said: "Both sides are
using everything they have."
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe
Dayan later told the nation in a
broadcast he hoped the fighting
would "teach Jordan that a
cease-fire is a cease-fire and it
applies to both Israel and Jor
dan."
Dayan Thursday cancelled a
scheduled trip to the United
States because of the outbreak.
Small Coin In Hue
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. Ma
rines edged about 200 yards
closer to Communist positions
within Hue's walled Citadel
Thursday behind a curtain of
bombs and shells laid down by
land-based artillery.
"It was a relatively good
pace," a Marine officer said,
though their immediate objec
tive was still 500 yards away.
South Vietnamese troops ma
neuvered at about the same
pace in coordination with the
American Leathernecks against
remnants of a North Viet
namese regiment which clung
for the 16th day to palace
grounds and some wall fortifica
tions in Hue, the old imperial

capital 400 miles north of Sai
gon.
Marine Corps fighter-bombers
struck at the Citadel's massive
brownstone walls with bombs of
250, 500 and 750 pounds, employ
ing heavy explosives in this ac
tion for the first time. They had
used lighter rockets, fiery na
palm and nauseant tear gas in
efforts Wednesday to root the
enemy from historic architec
tural treasures in the Citadel.
Stockpile For Riots
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Army is stockpiling riot control
equipment in strategically locat
ed depots across the country, of
ficials said today, and is ready
to airlift it to any city if civil
disorders break out next sum
mer.
Details of the military estab
listment's riot duty prepara
tions were disclosed after
sources reported the President's
Commission on Civil Disorders
is dissatisfied with the National
Guard's performance in quell
ing last summer's violence, and
is considering recommending
creation of a specially trained
foderal riot-control force.
A commission source said the
National Guard's effectiveness
is limited by lack of proper
training and by "the fact most
of the Guard is lily-white." He
said discussion of a special
force has centered on whether it
would amount to a national po
lice force; whether it would be
a regular Army unit; and at
what point li would step into a
disorder.
S. Africa Ban Lifted
GRENOBLE. France (AP) —

South Africa, barred from the
1964 Olympics for its racial poli
cies, was readmitted into the
1968 Olympics at Mexico City by
a vote of an "aboslute majority"
of members of the International
Olympic Committee.
The announcement here
Thursday night immediately
raised the possibility that sev
eral other African nations, and
possibly the Soviet Union, might
boycott the summer Games
starting Oct. 12.
Russian sports officials at the
Winter Olympics here had indi
cated earlier in the week that
if South Africa competes in the
Mexico City Games the Soviet
Union won't.
Soviet officials, however, had
no immediate reaction Thursday
to the announcement by the lOC,
ending the suspension which had
kept South Africa out of the
1964 Summer and Winter Games
and the current Winter Games
in Grenoble.
UCLA Head Quits
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Dr.
Franklin Murphy will resign
Friday as chancellor of the Uni
versity of California at Los An
geles, the Sacramento Bee said
today.
In a story by education report
er Ron Blubaugh, the newspaper
said it had learned from unim
peachable sources that the an
nouncement is expected to be
made at the university regents
meeting in Riverside.
The paper said Murphy de
clined to accept telephone calls
and that his public affairs of
ficer, Andrew Hamilton, said
"we have no comment at this
time."

U.S. Bombs Kill 40
SAIGON (AP)—More than 40
persons were killed Tuesday
when high-flying 852 Stratofor
tresses mistakenly dropped 50
tons of bombs outside a target
zone only 10.5 miles north of
Saigon, the U.S. Air Force an
nounced Thursday.
The spokesman said 42 to 44
persons died and from 57 to 59
were injured in the raid that
was the closest to Saigon in the
war. It was the first such error
attributed to the 852s that
usually execute their high-alti
tude saturation raids in less
populous areas.
Surtax Supported
WASHINGTON (AP)—A con
gressional alternative to the ad
ministration's 10 per cent tax
surcharge got a cold shoulder
Thursday from Secretary of the
Treasury Henry H. Fowler.
Fowler said higher taxes are
needed now to halt inflation and
prevent an eventual recession.
The Treasury chief testified
before the Senate-House Eco
nomic Committee as the govern
ment reported the first decline
in industrial output in four
months during January and a
slowdown in personal income
gains.
Fowler, however, said the
economy is in "grave danger of
excessive overheating."
Labor Hits Politicos
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) —
Millions of public workers rang
ing from garbage men to school
teachers are at the mercy of
"bungling bureaucrats" and
"antilabor" politicians because
of punitive state labor laws, un
ion leaders charged Thursday.
"In cities and states across
the nation, tensions between
public officials and public em
ployes are mounting at an
alarming rate," said AFL-CIO
leaders meeting here.
They cited as examples New
York City's garbage men's dis
pute, another garbage collec
tors' strike in Memphis, Tenn.,
a recent nine-day strike of
teachers in the Washington, D C.
suburb of Montgomery County,
Md„ and a threatened Florida
Teachers' strike.
Swiss Act On War
BERN, Switzerland (AP) —
Switzerland, acting on its own
initiative, has dispatched a dip
lomat to Hanoi in an attempt to
mediate in the Vietnam war, re
liable sources said Thursday.
They identified him as Oscar
Rossetti, the Swiss ambassador
to Peking, and said he was in
structed to tell North Vietnam
that Switzerland is ready and
willing to lend its good offices to
mediation.
The new attempt was made
despite U.N. Secretary-General
U Thant's apparent lack of pro
gress in a peace mission that
took him to India, the Soviet Un
ion, London and Paris.
Race Tension High
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
President's Commission on Civil
Disorders has found that many
cities, including those hit hard
est by violence last summer,
have done little to ease tension,
and commission members doubt
that much can be done to pre
vent another summer of rioting.
A source close to the commis
sion said Thursday that in many
riot-torn communities visited by
commission members the only
change they found was even
greater bitterness and hostility.
The same pessimistic view
was expressed Monday by Pres
ident Johnson.
"I don't think you can avert a

bad summer. We'll have a bad
summer. We'll have several bad
summers," the President told a
student group at the White
House.
Dollar Drain Up
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Commerce Department today
pinpointed the U.S. dollar drain
last year at $3.57 billion — the
largest since 1960—and blamed
a deteriorating trade picture and
devaluation of the British pound
for most of worsening.
It said the deficit between
money spent in other countries
by Americans and what foreign
ers spent here reached $1.83 bil
lion in the fourth quarter of
last year—more than the first
three quarters combined.
Foreign Aid To VC?
WASHINGTON (AP)—A Viet
nam businessman tried to get
U.S. foreign aid money with
which to buy howitzers and an
tiaircraft guns for th > Viet
Cong, a report from the State
Department said today.
Steps were taken to scotch
that deal, it said. But in another
case, the U.S. Agency for Inter
national Development (AID)
was disclosed to have paid $100,-
000 for water in Saigon, without
ever getting any.
The report came from J. Ken
neth Mansfield, inspector gen
eral of foreign assistance. It
covered irregularities and laxity
in U.S. assistance programs in
30 countries.
Stocks Up Again
NEW YORK (AP)—The stock
market's technical rebound
managed to survive some profit
taking Thursday and the result
was the second straight ad
vance. Trading slowed.
Volume dropped to 9.77 mil
lion shares from 11.39 million
Wednesday when stocks re
bounded sharply from a three
day battering under the impact
of disquieting news from Asia.
The Dow Jones industrial av
erage rose 1.85 at 839.23.
