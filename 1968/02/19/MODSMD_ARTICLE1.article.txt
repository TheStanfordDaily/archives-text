# Draft Policy Confirmed: Graduates Worst Hit
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The Johnson administration
confirmed Friday that no draft
deferments will be given for
graduate study next Fall, except
for medical students and gradu
ate students already in their
second year.
In effect the government said
"no" to the universities and pro
fessional organizations which
had complained that the draft
would reduce graduate school
enrollment next year and en
danger the nation's supply of
college teachers.
The National Security Coun
cil announced the decision in
a memorandum to the Selec
tive Service, advising that "it
is not essential for the main
tenance of the national health,
safety and interest to extend
student deferments for gradu
ate study. . .
Logan Wilson, president of the
American Council on Education,
called the decision a "short
sighted" one.
"Its implications for the long

range trained manpower-needs
of the nation are alarming," Wil
son said. "The decision means
that most college graduates in
1968 will be drafted in the near
future."
Selective Service Director
Lewis B. Hershey also squelched
hopes for a "prime age group"
ruling which would ease the
impact of the draft on college
graduates and graduate stu
dents.
"The sequence of selection in
filling calls will remain un
changed," Hershey said in a
telegram Friday to state selec
tive service directors. "A change
in the order of call is not justi
fied at this time."
The present order of call takes
the oldest men under 26 first.
Students losing their 2-S defer
ments upon graduation will
therefore be near the top of this
"order of call."
Virgil K. Whitaker, dean of
Stanford's graduate division,
said the directive "essentially
confirms that there will be no

change. They have no intention
of further categorical defer
ments and will continue to take
the oldest first."
The decision means no
special student deferments for
science and engin<*ering will
be given.
Walter Findeisen, Stanford
national service adviser, called
it a "reaffirmation of what the
law originally stated and pro
vided."
On Feb. 9 a House special sub
committee asked President
Johnson for immediate action to
end the uncertainty over draft
policy toward graduate stu
dents. Friday's announcement
was a reply.
Nathan M. Pusey, president
of Harvard University, told the
House committee that a decision
on graduate deferments along
the lines announced Friday
"would be a disaster."
Shortly after the National
Security Council's decision
was revealed, Gustave O. Arlt,
president of the Council of

Graduate Schools, said "The
council is appalled at the new
draft regulations. ... It is
obvious that the decisions
were based purely on political
considerations and bear no re
lation to the realities of the
national interests."
Nationwide, enrollment in the
first two years of graduate
school wil fall by 40 to 50 per
cent if draft boards take all
available candidates, according
to university officials.
A representative of the U.S.
Office of Education said more
than 150,000 prospective gradu
ate students probably would be
drafted, and another 75,000
would enlist under threat of the
draft.
At Stanford 25 to 30 per
cent of the entire entering
graduate class next fall could
be drafted, according to Whit
aker.
The National Security Coun
cil, which consists of President
Johnson and other top officials,
also told Hershey to suspend

the list of critical occupations
and essential activities used by
draft boards to grant 2-A occu
pational deferments. These lists
included various industrial spe
cialties, scientific work and
some teaching jobs.
The council said that neither
the armed forces nor the civil
ian economy require these oc
cupational deferments. The
council also pointed out the "in
herent inequity, at a time when
men are called upon to risk their
lives for the nation, in any such
occupational deferments from
military service which may in
practice turn into permanent
exemptions."
But local boards will con
tinue to have the "discretion
to grant, in individual cases,
occupational deferments based
on a showing of essential com
munity need, Hershey said in
his telegram to state directors.
Currently more than half the
339,474 occupational deferments
fall outside the list of essential
activities. "Draft boards have

discretion anyway to grant occu
pational deferments in special
cases, Findeisen explained.
The action on occupational
deferments does not rule out
the possibility that graduate
students in engineering and
sciences could receive occupa
tional deferments by action of
local boards. The National Se
curity Council, however, has
come out against deferments
for any graduate students ex
cept those in medicine or
allied fields and divinity stu
dents.
The National Security Coun
cils action Friday left the 1967
draft regulations unchanged.
They allow a 2-S deferment to
"any registrant who is entering
his second or subsequent year
of post-baccalaureate study with
interruption on Oct. 1, 1967,"
provided he doesn't take more
than five years in total to earn a
PhD.
Students who began graduate
study last fall "shall be deferred
for one academic year only," ac

cording to the 1967 law. These
students lose their 21-S defer
ments in June, along with all
graduating seniors.
Undergraduates are guaran
teed deferments "until such
registrant completes the re
quirements for his baccalau
reate degree, fails to pursue
satisfactorily a fuM-tlme
course of instruction, or at
tains the 24th anniversary of
the date of his birth."
The National Security Council
said its decision to eliminate all
deferments except medical stu
dents' was "based on the follow
ing considerations:
" —graduate deferments are
not now required in the national
interest.
unfairness would result
from exempting men in some
fields of graduate study and not
in others ....
'The inequities that result
from graduate deferments be
cause many of those deferments
can be pyramided into exemp
tion from military service."

fessional organizations which
had complained that the draft
would reduce graduate school
enrollment next year and en
danger the nation's supply of
college teachers.
The National Security Coun
cil announced the decision in
a memorandum to the Selec

is not essential for the main
tenance of the national health,
safety and interest to extend
student deferments for gradu

Logan Wilson, president of the
American Council on Education,
called the decision a "short
sighted" one.
"Its implications for the long

range trained manpower-needs
of the nation are alarming," Wil
son said. "The decision means
that most college graduates in
1968 will be drafted in the near
future."
Selective Service Director
Lewis B. Hershey also squelched
hopes for a "prime age group"
ruling which would ease the
impact of the draft on college
graduates and graduate stu
dents.
"The sequence of selection in
filling calls will remain un
changed," Hershey said in a
telegram Friday to state selec
tive service directors. "A change
in the order of call is not justi
fied at this time."
The present order of call takes
the oldest men under 26 first.
Students losing their 2-S defer
ments upon graduation will
therefore be near the top of this
"order of call."
Virgil K. Whitaker, dean of
Stanford's graduate division,
said the directive "essentially
confirms that there will be no

change. They have no intention
of further categorical defer
ments and will continue to take
the oldest first."
The decision means no
special student deferments for
science and engin<*ering will
be given.
Walter Findeisen, Stanford
national service adviser, called
it a "reaffirmation of what the
law originally stated and pro
vided."
On Feb. 9 a House special sub
committee asked President
Johnson for immediate action to
end the uncertainty over draft
policy toward graduate stu
dents. Friday's announcement
was a reply.
Nathan M. Pusey, president
of Harvard University, told the
House committee that a decision
on graduate deferments along
the lines announced Friday
"would be a disaster."
Shortly after the National
Security Council's decision
was revealed, Gustave O. Arlt,
president of the Council of

Graduate Schools, said "The
council is appalled at the new
draft regulations. ... It is
obvious that the decisions
were based purely on political
considerations and bear no re
lation to the realities of the
national interests."
Nationwide, enrollment in the
first two years of graduate
school wil fall by 40 to 50 per
cent if draft boards take all
available candidates, according
to university officials.
A representative of the U.S.
Office of Education said more
than 150,000 prospective gradu
ate students probably would be
drafted, and another 75,000
would enlist under threat of the
draft.
At Stanford 25 to 30 per
cent of the entire entering
graduate class next fall could
be drafted, according to Whit
aker.
The National Security Coun
cil, which consists of President
Johnson and other top officials,
also told Hershey to suspend

the list of critical occupations
and essential activities used by
draft boards to grant 2-A occu
pational deferments. These lists
included various industrial spe
cialties, scientific work and
some teaching jobs.
The council said that neither
the armed forces nor the civil
ian economy require these oc
cupational deferments. The
council also pointed out the "in
herent inequity, at a time when
men are called upon to risk their
lives for the nation, in any such
occupational deferments from
military service which may in
practice turn into permanent
exemptions."
But local boards will con
tinue to have the "discretion
to grant, in individual cases,
occupational deferments based
on a showing of essential com
munity need, Hershey said in
his telegram to state directors.
Currently more than half the
339,474 occupational deferments
fall outside the list of essential
activities. "Draft boards have

discretion anyway to grant occu
pational deferments in special
cases, Findeisen explained.
The action on occupational
deferments does not rule out
the possibility that graduate
students in engineering and
sciences could receive occupa
tional deferments by action of
local boards. The National Se
curity Council, however, has
come out against deferments
for any graduate students ex
cept those in medicine or
allied fields and divinity stu
dents.
The National Security Coun
cils action Friday left the 1967
draft regulations unchanged.
They allow a 2-S deferment to
"any registrant who is entering
his second or subsequent year
of post-baccalaureate study with
interruption on Oct. 1, 1967,"
provided he doesn't take more
than five years in total to earn a
PhD.
Students who began graduate
study last fall "shall be deferred
for one academic year only," ac

cording to the 1967 law. These
students lose their 21-S defer
ments in June, along with all
graduating seniors.
Undergraduates are guaran
teed deferments "until such
registrant completes the re
quirements for his baccalau
reate degree, fails to pursue
satisfactorily a fuM-tlme
course of instruction, or at
tains the 24th anniversary of
the date of his birth."
The National Security Council
said its decision to eliminate all
deferments except medical stu
dents' was "based on the follow
ing considerations:
" —graduate deferments are
not now required in the national
interest.
unfairness would result
from exempting men in some
fields of graduate study and not

'The inequities that result

is not essential for the main
tenance of the national health,
safety and interest to extend
student deferments for gradu
ate study. . .
Logan Wilson, president of the
American Council on Education,
called the decision a "short
sighted" one.
"Its implications for the long

range trained manpower-needs
of the nation are alarming," Wil
son said. "The decision means
that most college graduates in
1968 will be drafted in the near
future."
Selective Service Director
Lewis B. Hershey also squelched
hopes for a "prime age group"
ruling which would ease the
impact of the draft on college
graduates and graduate stu
dents.
"The sequence of selection in
filling calls will remain un
changed," Hershey said in a
telegram Friday to state selec
tive service directors. "A change
in the order of call is not justi
fied at this time."
The present order of call takes
the oldest men under 26 first.
Students losing their 2-S defer
ments upon graduation will
therefore be near the top of this
"order of call."
Virgil K. Whitaker, dean of
Stanford's graduate division,
said the directive "essentially
confirms that there will be no

change. They have no intention
of further categorical defer
ments and will continue to take
the oldest first."
The decision means no
special student deferments for
science and engin<*ering will
be given.
Walter Findeisen, Stanford
national service adviser, called
it a "reaffirmation of what the
law originally stated and pro
vided."
On Feb. 9 a House special sub
committee asked President
Johnson for immediate action to
end the uncertainty over draft
policy toward graduate stu
dents. Friday's announcement
was a reply.
Nathan M. Pusey, president
of Harvard University, told the
House committee that a decision
on graduate deferments along
the lines announced Friday
"would be a disaster."
Shortly after the National
Security Council's decision
was revealed, Gustave O. Arlt,
president of the Council of

Graduate Schools, said "The
council is appalled at the new
draft regulations. ... It is
obvious that the decisions
were based purely on political
considerations and bear no re
lation to the realities of the
national interests."
Nationwide, enrollment in the
first two years of graduate
school wil fall by 40 to 50 per
cent if draft boards take all
available candidates, according
to university officials.
A representative of the U.S.
Office of Education said more
than 150,000 prospective gradu
ate students probably would be
drafted, and another 75,000
would enlist under threat of the
draft.
At Stanford 25 to 30 per
cent of the entire entering
graduate class next fall could
be drafted, according to Whit
aker.
The National Security Coun
cil, which consists of President
Johnson and other top officials,
also told Hershey to suspend

the list of critical occupations
and essential activities used by
draft boards to grant 2-A occu
pational deferments. These lists
included various industrial spe
cialties, scientific work and
some teaching jobs.
The council said that neither
the armed forces nor the civil
ian economy require these oc
cupational deferments. The
council also pointed out the "in
herent inequity, at a time when
men are called upon to risk their
lives for the nation, in any such
occupational deferments from
military service which may in
practice turn into permanent
exemptions."
But local boards will con
tinue to have the "discretion
to grant, in individual cases,
occupational deferments based
on a showing of essential com
munity need, Hershey said in
his telegram to state directors.
Currently more than half the
339,474 occupational deferments
fall outside the list of essential
activities. "Draft boards have

discretion anyway to grant occu
pational deferments in special
cases, Findeisen explained.
The action on occupational
deferments does not rule out
the possibility that graduate
students in engineering and
sciences could receive occupa
tional deferments by action of
local boards. The National Se
curity Council, however, has
come out against deferments
for any graduate students ex
cept those in medicine or
allied fields and divinity stu
dents.
The National Security Coun
cils action Friday left the 1967
draft regulations unchanged.
They allow a 2-S deferment to
"any registrant who is entering
his second or subsequent year
of post-baccalaureate study with
interruption on Oct. 1, 1967,"
provided he doesn't take more
than five years in total to earn a
PhD.
Students who began graduate
study last fall "shall be deferred
for one academic year only," ac

cording to the 1967 law. These
students lose their 21-S defer
ments in June, along with all
graduating seniors.
Undergraduates are guaran
teed deferments "until such
registrant completes the re
quirements for his baccalau
reate degree, fails to pursue
satisfactorily a fuM-tlme
course of instruction, or at
tains the 24th anniversary of
the date of his birth."
The National Security Council
said its decision to eliminate all
deferments except medical stu
dents' was "based on the follow
ing considerations:
" —graduate deferments are
not now required in the national
interest.
unfairness would result
from exempting men in some
fields of graduate study and not
in others ....
'The inequities that result
from graduate deferments be
cause many of those deferments
can be pyramided into exemp
tion from military service."
The Johnson administration
confirmed Friday that no draft
deferments will be given for
graduate study next Fall, except
for medical students and gradu
ate students already in their
second year.
In effect the government said
"no" to the universities and pro
fessional organizations which
had complained that the draft
would reduce graduate school
enrollment next year and en
danger the nation's supply of
college teachers.
The National Security Coun
