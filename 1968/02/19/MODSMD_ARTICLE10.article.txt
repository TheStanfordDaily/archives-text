## Happiness Is Sharing A State 
### Art Hopper 
Once upon a time there was
a Little White Knight named
George. He was married to a
million-dollar baby he found in
a five-and-ten-cent store. Her
name was Lurleen. They were
very happy.
They were very happy because
they had learned to share. They
shared their bed, they shared
their board, they shared their
spray deodorant.
In fact, they shared all the
joys and all the heartaches of
their happy state. Its name was
Alabama.
Sometimes George had it. And
sometimes he let Lurleen have
it. But when she had it, she was
very careful not to do anything
with it that George wouldn't
do.
And anyway, like a very good
husband, he watched over her
shoulder, saying things like,
"Don't go so fast. Don't turn
left. Watch out for that there
interfering Federal bureaucracy
there."
But, like any husband, the
Little White Knight got bored
with his happy State. So he de
cided to sally forth on a quest.

"I am going to slay the Soodo-
Intellectuals and drag them
home by the hair on their chin
ny-chin-chins," said the Little
White Knight, buckling on his
armor-plated vest.
"And maybe I'll even capture

the Big White House," said the
Little White Knight, buckling
on his armor-plated undershorts.
"Leastwise, I'll make sure no
body else can have it."
"Have yourself a real nice
time, George," said Lurleen.
"And don't you worry none
about our State. I'll take real
good care of it while your gone."
So the Little White Knight
mounted his armor-plated ros
trum and, accompanied by a
troop of heavily-armed guards,
he galloped off to give battle
to the Soodo-Intellectuals.
And everywhere he went, he
slayed them.
Of course, each time he came
home, he found things a little
different.
"Who hung them fool orange
curtains up on my favorite free
way?" he'd say angrily. Or:
"Whose plumb-daffy idea was
it to string them picayune Jap
anese lanterns across my favor
ite bridge?"
"I was just trying to make
a comfy State for you to come
home to," Lurleen would say
tearfully. "And besides," she
would add like any good wife,
"there's a lot of chores around
the State need doing. Why, no
body's stood in the schoolhouse
door for months. And they're
leaking something awful."
Naturally ,this led to their
very first quarrel. To defend
himself, like any good husband,

George attacked. He said what
kind of a helpmate was she?
Didn't she want him to be a
success and capture the Big
White House?
Lurleen said she sure enough
did. She said she could hardly
wait until he was in that Big
White House far away and not
poking his interfering Federal
nose into her State, because
she'd just gotten this dandy new
decorating book and the sewage
plant was sure going to look
a sight nicer in mauve with a
fuschia trim and . . .
Well, the world was a bit sur
prised when the Little White
Knight renounced his quest.
"I just want to stay home with
my beloved Lurleen and enjoy
together our happy State," he
modestly explained to the pub
lic. "Which," he muttered in
private, "she'd better give back.
Or there's going to be one lolla
paloozer of a custody fight."

Moral: Sharing is indeed the
key to a happy marriage. Take
your share and when your wife
wants hers, let her have it. Let
her have it good.
