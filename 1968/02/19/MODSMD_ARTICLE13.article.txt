# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Police Chiefs Fear FBI Training Monopoly 
### Drew Pearson 
It hasn't made headlines, but
a bitter feud is smoldering be
tween J. Edgar Hoover and the
former No. 3 man in the FBI,
Quinn Tamm.
Mr. Tamm is now executive
director of the International As
sociation of Chiefs of Police,
and, in view of the government
drive to clean up crime, the feud
is important. It has contributed
to Hoover's clandestine efforts
to undermine his boss, Attorney
General Ramsey Clark.
Mr. Tamm grew up in the
FBI, as did his brother, Judge
Edward Tamm. Both became
assistant directors, and Edward
Tamm was promoted to the U.S.
district court, then to the U.S.
court of appeals, where he has
served with distinction.
Many considered his brother
Quinn as the probable heir to
J. Edgar Hoover when Hoover
retired. Hoover is now 73 and
past the mandatory retirement
age, but has been retained by
executive order of President
Johnson.
Liaison Job
One of Tamm's jobs in the
FBI was to act as liaison be
tween it and the International
Association of Chiefs of Police,

for which the FBI does a certain
amount of police training.
In 1960 the International
Chiefs of Police offered Tamm
the job of executive director,
and Tamm accepted. Before do
ing so, however, he asked the
police chiefs whether in his new
job he would be under the
thumb of the FBI. The answer
was no.
Tamm has taken this literally.
Not only is he not under the
thumb of the FBI, but he has
been battling the FBI regarding
certain of its policies, especially
its political operations.
He has been so vigorous that
the FBI has ruefully branded
Tamm as replacing Pat Mur
phy as the FBl's No. 1 enemy.
Murphy, formerly in the Justice
Department, is now public safe
ty director of the District of
Columbia and considered one of
the top crime experts in the na
tion.
FBI And Politics
Tamm's chief row with his
old boss came when the FBI
went over the head of Hoover's
boss, the Attorney General to
lobby on Capitol Hill to amend
the safe-streets bill. Hoover
wanted the safe-streets bill to

provide that the FBI do all
police training for American
city police.
Attorney General Clark
argued that the FBI was already
overloaded with work; second,
that police training by the FBI
would create a national police
force contrary to American tra
dition. Clark wanted the FBI
to do some specialized training
of city police, but not all.
Despite this, and despite the
fact that the FBI is supposed
to keep out of politics, Hoover
sent two of his special agents
to Capitol Hill to make the
rounds of key Senators.
When Quinn Tamm heard of
this, he not only spoke out pub
licly against his old FBI boss,
but sent a letter to Sen. John
McClellan, D-Ark., chairman of
the subcommittee drafting the
anticrime legislation.
National Police
Tamm put the International
Association of Chiefs of Police
officially on record as against
Hoover's plan to "centralize
police training in the hands of
the director of the FBI," which,
Tamm said, "could become the
first step toward a national
police."

Hoover reacted vigorously. He
sent out an air-telegram on the
FBI Telex to all special agents
asking them to contact board
members of the International
Association of Chiefs of Police
and line them up against Tamm
in order to oust him at the next
lACP board meeting. Simultan
eously Hoover began suggesting
other police chiefs to replace
Tamm as executive director.
At this point, Leonard Law
rence of Hamilton, Ontario,
president of the lACP, came to
Washington. He called on Hoo

ver's alleged boss, Attorney
General Clark, and informed
him of the efforts to undermine
Tamm.
Lawrence asked Clark if he
cou'd attend the next board
meeting of the chiefs of police.
Clark's Warning
Attorney General Clark then
called Hoover's right-hand man,
Deak DoLoach, a member of the
lACP board, and told him: "If
you say anything against Tamm
at the next board meeting, I
shall be compelled to speak out
myself."
Clark was as good as his

word. Two days later he did
attend the board meeting of the
chiefs of police. He was not re
quired to speak out, however.
Deak DeLoach had heeded his
warning and did not urge
Tamm's removal. The question
of support for Tamm was
raised, however, and he received
an overwhelming vote of con
fidence from the police chiefs.
J. Edgar Hoover lost this
round in the bitter battle be
tween him and the former No.
3 man in the FBI. However, the
battle is continuing.

tion.
FBI And Politics
Tamm's chief row with his
old boss came when the FBI
went over the head of Hoover's
boss, the Attorney General to
lobby on Capitol Hill to amend
the safe-streets bill. Hoover
wanted the safe-streets bill to

provide that the FBI do all
police training for American
city police.
Attorney General Clark
argued that the FBI was already
overloaded with work; second,
that police training by the FBI
would create a national police
force contrary to American tra
dition. Clark wanted the FBI
to do some specialized training
of city police, but not all.
Despite this, and despite the
fact that the FBI is supposed
to keep out of politics, Hoover
sent two of his special agents
to Capitol Hill to make the
rounds of key Senators.
When Quinn Tamm heard of
this, he not only spoke out pub
licly against his old FBI boss,
but sent a letter to Sen. John
McClellan, D-Ark., chairman of
the subcommittee drafting the
anticrime legislation.
National Police
Tamm put the International
Association of Chiefs of Police
officially on record as against
Hoover's plan to "centralize
police training in the hands of
the director of the FBI," which,
Tamm said, "could become the
first step toward a national
police."

Hoover reacted vigorously. He
sent out an air-telegram on the
FBI Telex to all special agents
asking them to contact board
members of the International
Association of Chiefs of Police
and line them up against Tamm
in order to oust him at the next
lACP board meeting. Simultan
eously Hoover began suggesting
other police chiefs to replace
Tamm as executive director.
At this point, Leonard Law
rence of Hamilton, Ontario,
president of the lACP, came to
Washington. He called on Hoo

ver's alleged boss, Attorney
General Clark, and informed
him of the efforts to undermine
Tamm.
Lawrence asked Clark if he
cou'd attend the next board
meeting of the chiefs of police.
Clark's Warning
Attorney General Clark then
called Hoover's right-hand man,
Deak DoLoach, a member of the
lACP board, and told him: "If
you say anything against Tamm
at the next board meeting, I
shall be compelled to speak out
myself."
Clark was as good as his

word. Two days later he did
attend the board meeting of the
chiefs of police. He was not re
quired to speak out, however.
Deak DeLoach had heeded his
warning and did not urge
Tamm's removal. The question
of support for Tamm was
raised, however, and he received
an overwhelming vote of con
fidence from the police chiefs.
J. Edgar Hoover lost this
round in the bitter battle be
tween him and the former No.
3 man in the FBI. However, the
battle is continuing.
(c) 1968, Bell-McClure Syndicate
It hasn't made headlines, but
a bitter feud is smoldering be
tween J. Edgar Hoover and the
former No. 3 man in the FBI,
Quinn Tamm.
Mr. Tamm is now executive
director of the International As
sociation of Chiefs of Police,
and, in view of the government
drive to clean up crime, the feud
is important. It has contributed
to Hoover's clandestine efforts
to undermine his boss, Attorney
General Ramsey Clark.
Mr. Tamm grew up in the
FBI, as did his brother, Judge
Edward Tamm. Both became
assistant directors, and Edward
Tamm was promoted to the U.S.
district court, then to the U.S.
court of appeals, where he has
served with distinction.
Many considered his brother
Quinn as the probable heir to
J. Edgar Hoover when Hoover
retired. Hoover is now 73 and
past the mandatory retirement
age, but has been retained by
executive order of President
Johnson.
Liaison Job
One of Tamm's jobs in the
FBI was to act as liaison be
tween it and the International
Association of Chiefs of Police,

for which the FBI does a certain
amount of police training.
In 1960 the International
Chiefs of Police offered Tamm
the job of executive director,
and Tamm accepted. Before do
ing so, however, he asked the
police chiefs whether in his new
job he would be under the
thumb of the FBI. The answer
was no.
Tamm has taken this literally.
Not only is he not under the
thumb of the FBI, but he has
been battling the FBI regarding
certain of its policies, especially
its political operations.
He has been so vigorous that
the FBI has ruefully branded
Tamm as replacing Pat Mur
phy as the FBl's No. 1 enemy.

meeting of the chiefs of police.
Clark's Warning
Attorney General Clark then
called Hoover's right-hand man,
Deak DoLoach, a member of the
lACP board, and told him: "If
you say anything against Tamm
at the next board meeting, I
shall be compelled to speak out
myself."
Clark was as good as his

word. Two days later he did
attend the board meeting of the
chiefs of police. He was not re
quired to speak out, however.
Deak DeLoach had heeded his
warning and did not urge
Tamm's removal. The question
of support for Tamm was
raised, however, and he received
an overwhelming vote of con
fidence from the police chiefs.
J. Edgar Hoover lost this
round in the bitter battle be
tween him and the former No.
3 man in the FBI. However, the
battle is continuing.

It hasn't made headlines, but
a bitter feud is smoldering be
tween J. Edgar Hoover and the
former No. 3 man in the FBI,
Quinn Tamm.
Mr. Tamm is now executive
director of the International As
sociation of Chiefs of Police,
and, in view of the government
drive to clean up crime, the feud
is important. It has contributed
to Hoover's clandestine efforts
to undermine his boss, Attorney
General Ramsey Clark.
Mr. Tamm grew up in the
FBI, as did his brother, Judge
Edward Tamm. Both became
assistant directors, and Edward
Tamm was promoted to the U.S.
district court, then to the U.S.
court of appeals, where he has
served with distinction.
Many considered his brother
Quinn as the probable heir to
J. Edgar Hoover when Hoover
retired. Hoover is now 73 and
past the mandatory retirement
age, but has been retained by
executive order of President
Johnson.
Liaison Job
One of Tamm's jobs in the
FBI was to act as liaison be
tween it and the International
Association of Chiefs of Police,

for which the FBI does a certain
amount of police training.
In 1960 the International
Chiefs of Police offered Tamm
the job of executive director,
and Tamm accepted. Before do
ing so, however, he asked the
police chiefs whether in his new
job he would be under the
thumb of the FBI. The answer
was no.
Tamm has taken this literally.
Not only is he not under the
thumb of the FBI, but he has
been battling the FBI regarding
certain of its policies, especially
its political operations.
He has been so vigorous that
the FBI has ruefully branded
Tamm as replacing Pat Mur
phy as the FBl's No. 1 enemy.
Murphy, formerly in the Justice
Department, is now public safe
ty director of the District of
Columbia and considered one of
the top crime experts in the na
tion.
FBI And Politics
Tamm's chief row with his
old boss came when the FBI
went over the head of Hoover's
boss, the Attorney General to
lobby on Capitol Hill to amend
the safe-streets bill. Hoover
wanted the safe-streets bill to

provide that the FBI do all
police training for American
city police.
Attorney General Clark
argued that the FBI was already
overloaded with work; second,
that police training by the FBI
would create a national police
force contrary to American tra
dition. Clark wanted the FBI
to do some specialized training
of city police, but not all.
Despite this, and despite the
fact that the FBI is supposed
to keep out of politics, Hoover
sent two of his special agents
to Capitol Hill to make the
rounds of key Senators.
When Quinn Tamm heard of
this, he not only spoke out pub
licly against his old FBI boss,
but sent a letter to Sen. John
McClellan, D-Ark., chairman of
the subcommittee drafting the
anticrime legislation.
National Police
Tamm put the International
Association of Chiefs of Police
officially on record as against
Hoover's plan to "centralize
police training in the hands of
the director of the FBI," which,
Tamm said, "could become the
first step toward a national
police."

Hoover reacted vigorously. He
sent out an air-telegram on the
FBI Telex to all special agents
asking them to contact board
members of the International
Association of Chiefs of Police
and line them up against Tamm
in order to oust him at the next
lACP board meeting. Simultan
eously Hoover began suggesting
other police chiefs to replace
Tamm as executive director.
At this point, Leonard Law
rence of Hamilton, Ontario,
president of the lACP, came to
Washington. He called on Hoo

ver's alleged boss, Attorney
General Clark, and informed
him of the efforts to undermine
Tamm.
Lawrence asked Clark if he
cou'd attend the next board
