# From A Reporter's Notebook
## Selectivity Doesn't Build Men 
### NICHOLAS SELBY 
In all the conferences and in
numerable discussions with fra
ternity advocates that I have
covered for The Daily, I have
never heard a more unbelieve
able argument than that advanc
ed by Bob Murphy in a letter to
The Daily Thursday.
Mr. Murphy, who is in charge
of public relations for Stanford's
athletic department, said that
selective rush is typical of the
competition an individual faces
throughout his life. He said, in
effect, that competition for a
job, membership in a club, and
obviously, a wife, in the world
outside the university is based
on the element of personal
choice.
No one can dispute the fact
the world outside the university
is extremely competitive, at
times almost cutthroat, and that
many people suffer setbacks
when rejected in this cruel
world.
Selective Training
But Mr. Murphy advances the

argument that selective rush for
a fraternity trains man for this
mean, cruel world by forcing
him to rebound from the set
back of not receiving a bid card.
The fault in this argument is
that it implies that rush for a
spot in fraternities is as cruel
and cold as fighting for a job in
business. It therefore can hard
ly be consistent with the idea
lism of the University, which
hopes that someday we won't
have a cold, cruel world that re
jects people for personal lack
ings, instead of lacking skill.
I doubt it impresses many fra
ternity men here now, and I
don't see how this argument can
impress the freshman who gets,
as Prof. Verba joked, "dung."
No one can dispute the need
to teach college students that
when faced with despair, one
does not give up but rebounds
from misfortune and competes
again. However, I hope we can
think of other ways to teach
this principle than enduring the
vagaries of selective rush.

Mr. Murphy's argument prob
ably rings very true to his Zete
brothers of the early 1950'5. But
in case he hasn't noticed it, h?
should realize that the student
body here has changed quite
radically in the last few
as has the faculty.
His argument will impress no
one "now. If he wants to argue
for selective rush, which is al
most impossible and something
I wouldn't attempt, he ought to
think of other arguments.
I live in a fraternity and enjoy
the way of life there. But I
don't think selective rush really
has anything to do with how we
live. And finally, to argue an
end to selective rush is not neces
sarily to argue should be
an end to fraternities.
When more people realize this
last truth, then Stanford will be
free of at least one part of the
cold, cruel, competitive world
outside.

business. It therefore can hard
ly be consistent with the idea
lism of the University, which
hopes that someday we won't
have a cold, cruel world that re
jects people for personal lack
ings, instead of lacking skill.
I doubt it impresses many fra
ternity men here now, and I
don't see how this argument can
impress the freshman who gets,
as Prof. Verba joked, "dung."
No one can dispute the need
to teach college students that
when faced with despair, one
does not give up but rebounds
from misfortune and competes
again. However, I hope we can
think of other ways to teach
this principle than enduring the
vagaries of selective rush.

Mr. Murphy's argument prob
ably rings very true to his Zete
brothers of the early 1950'5. But
in case he hasn't noticed it, h?
should realize that the student
body here has changed quite
radically in the last few
as has the faculty.
His argument will impress no
one "now. If he wants to argue
for selective rush, which is al
most impossible and something
I wouldn't attempt, he ought to
think of other arguments.
I live in a fraternity and enjoy
the way of life there. But I
don't think selective rush really
has anything to do with how we
live. And finally, to argue an
end to selective rush is not neces
sarily to argue should be
an end to fraternities.
When more people realize this
last truth, then Stanford will be
free of at least one part of the
cold, cruel, competitive world
outside.
In all the conferences and in
numerable discussions with fra
ternity advocates that I have
covered for The Daily, I have
never heard a more unbelieve
able argument than that advanc
ed by Bob Murphy in a letter to
The Daily Thursday.
Mr. Murphy, who is in charge
of public relations for Stanford's
athletic department, said that
selective rush is typical of the
competition an individual faces
throughout his life. He said, in
effect, that competition for a
job, membership in a club, and
obviously, a wife, in the world
outside the university is based
on the element of personal
choice.
No one can dispute the fact
the world outside the university
is extremely competitive, at
times almost cutthroat, and that
many people suffer setbacks
when rejected in this cruel
world.
Selective Training
But Mr. Murphy advances the

argument that selective rush for
a fraternity trains man for this
mean, cruel world by forcing
him to rebound from the set
back of not receiving a bid card.
The fault in this argument is
that it implies that rush for a
spot in fraternities is as cruel
and cold as fighting for a job in
business. It therefore can hard
ly be consistent with the idea
lism of the University, which
hopes that someday we won't
have a cold, cruel world that re
jects people for personal lack
ings, instead of lacking skill.
