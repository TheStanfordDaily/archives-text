## The 						Teabag Flurry 
### 
Editor, Th<» Daily:
It was interesting and annoy
ing to learn that certain cashiers
at Tresidder's food service be
come positively indignant when
someone, myself in particular,
attempts to use one teabag
twice. (This is done by keeping
your teabag and refilling your
cup with hot water.)
"Cold water is given out free.
Does it cost a dime to heat a
coffee-cup of cold water?" I
asked.
"The rules are specifically de
signed to prevent people from
doing just what you're doing!"
he replied.
"Well, obviously,' 'I countered,
"but, doesn't it seem a little
silly to charge me again for the
same tea bag if I'm willing to
drink a cup of weak tea?"
"No! The rules are specifical
ly designed to prevent people
from doing just what you're do
ing." he replied again.
And so, I wondering if maybe
you buy the water and get the
tea free? And if this is so, is
it true for coffee also, and hot
chocolate? Is it actually the
water you are buying and not
the little bit of brown powder
that drops down into it?

Champaign Intrudes On
Individual 9 8 Privacy
Editor, The Daily:
It is with deep concern over
the limits of the outside world
over individual privacy that I
write this short note expressing
my indignance over the intru
sion of political leaflets in the
most private of affairs.
During the course of this and
previous election campaigns I
have found a surprising amount
of campaign literature taped on

the walls of bathrooms and
toilets in campus residences.
Is there no place where one
can be left alone? Let's keen our
toilets and bathrooms inviolate!

Editorial Recognizes
True Cause Of Farce
Editor, The Daily:
Your recent editorial on stu- 1
dent government was excellent J
and I want to compliment you !
on it. It is true that ASSU is |
nothing but "the playground of
political radicals who can't even
find a president who'll serve out
his entire term."
It is gratifying to see such
recognition of the true cause of
the student government farce.

Improve Reviewers
Or Don't Review At All
Editor, The Daily:
After reading Tom Stockfisch's 1
review of "The Roar of the
Greasepaint — Tho Smell of the
Crowd," in Friday's Daily, two
appalling facts becamo evident. :
First. Stockfisch has little if anv
knowledge of the theater and,
second, he cannot write one com- !
plote sentence in English.
If Stockfisch is the best The
Daily has to offer in the way |
of reviewers, and I know for a |
fact that better reviewers hav j
been told that they are not ne r, d
ed on the staff, perhaps The
Daily ought not print any re- ;
views at all. When your review- |
ers consistently disagree with
every major critic in the Bay 1
Area, something is obviously '
wrong.
