# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Is Rockefeller A Litterbug? 
### Art Buchwald 
If anyone had told me a few
weeks ago that garbage would
play a major part in the 1968
presidential campaign, I would
have said he was crazy. But it
turns out, by going over Mayor
John Lindsay's head to settle
New York City's garbage strike,
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller slipped
on a bannana peel and wound
up with eggshells all over his
face.
The question people in Wash
ington are asking is, why did
Gov. Rockefeller take such a
calculated risk when he has
built up so much good will by
repeatedly announcing that he
was not a candidate for Presi
dent of the United States?
It is believed by some political
observers that Rockefeller wont
after New York's garbage to
show the rest of the country
that if he could clean up the
moss in New York City, he could
certainly clean it up in Wash
ington.
Stand On Trash
These observers believe that
Rocky has been sensitive to crit
icism and that he hasn't spoken
out on the great issues of the
day. By taking a strong stand
against the trash in New York
City, Rocky was serving notice
that he was willing to speak
out loud and clear on any issue,
at any place, at any time.
While Rockefeller is not a
candidate at the moment, he has
been following the polls very

close'y. and it is no coincidence
that the last poll on garbage
showed 87 per cent of a ] l people
interviewed said they were
against garbage, 4 per cent said
they were for garbage and 9
per cent said they "didn't know."
Gov. Rockefeller announced
his solution to the garbage
strike the same day the figures
on the polls were released.
Rocky supporters deny that
the governor was politically
motivated when he off Ted to
settle the garbage strike on
terms that Mayor Lindsay said
were "blackmail."
Lindsay's Walk
One Rockefeller man said,
"The governor was going to stay
out of it until he saw pictures
of Mayor Lindsay walking
through the mountains of rub
bish, lost and lonely, and prob
ably not smelling too good,
either.
"Rockefeller was so moved by
what he saw that he decided he
had to do something. His first
idea was to pass a law making
it obligatory for every com
muter who worked in New York
City, but lived in the suburbs,
to take 25 lbs. of garbage home
at night, either in a paper bag
or his brief case.
"Once home, the garbage
couM be dumped in the subur
banite's ash can. The governor
figured out that there are 750,-
000 commuters going home
every night and if each of th -m
took 25 lbs. of garbage, New

York would have gotten rid of
9,375 tons of refuse a day.
"But Lindsay rejected the
plan because he was afraid the
commuters wouldn't come to
work until the strike was over.
Lindsay's solution was to have
RockefeHer call out the Na
tional Guard.
Training Problem
"Rockefeller turned down
Lindsay's request since the
guards had not received 'gar
bage removal training,' and they
might start throwing the cans
around reckl< ssly, causing in
jury to innocent people. Besides,
once you use the guards to re
move garbage, they may not
want to go back to soldiering
again.
"So, Rockefeller had only
Lindsay's best interests at heart
when he made a settlement with
the garbage union."
Lindsay supporters are skep
tical ov°r Rockefeller's reasons
for trying to get him out of a
bind. They feel that Rockefeller
had used the strike as part of
a Dump Lindsay campaign,
since Lindsay is also not run
ning for the Presidency in 1968.
The only one who has seeme«l
to benefit from the controversy
is former Gov. George Wallace
who is running for the Presi
dency on an independent ticket.
Wallace, when questioned about
New York's garbage strike,
said: "They wouldn't have had
all this trouble if they only had
picked up the white trash."
