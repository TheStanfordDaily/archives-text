# Vista Letter Flauts War, Aid To Poor
## 
### 
Spokesmen for 140 VISTA
Volunteers across the nation
Wednesday denounced the war
on poverty as a "pacification
campaign to keep the poor
quiet." They called for President
Johnson to "end the war in Viet
nam now."
VISTA is the volunteer pro
gram of the Office of Economic
Opportunity. Its workers serve
in poor communities across the
country, living at the same eco
nomic level as the neighborhood
in which they live.
In their letter, the Vista volun
teers asserted that they "must
speak out on the war in Viet
nam ... if we are to truly serve
the people of our communities.
Our national policy must not in
clude destroying another coun
try for in doing so we are de
stroying ourselves."

All of the VISTAs who signed
the letter may be terminated for
speaking out on political issues.
As Federal employees, VISTA
Volunteers are subject to both
formal and informal pressures
to remain silent on political is
sues.
It is the sentiment of Volun
teers who signed the statement,
however, that despite possible
termination from VISTA, "we
must speak out ... if we are to
truly serve the people of our
communities."
Included in the letter to Pres
ident Johnson was a criticism of
our present use of resources.
"Our manpower and money do
not belong in Vietnam. They be
long in the poor areas of Amer
ica. The true war is here at
home, the war to free America
of poverty and racism, to free
the poor of needless suffering."
