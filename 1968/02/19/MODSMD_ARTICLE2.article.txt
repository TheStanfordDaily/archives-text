# Conflict In Engineering School Grows Over 'Core' Program
## 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
Controversy is growing in the
engineering school over a pro
posed new, "liberal" core curri
culum. The Study of Engineer
ing Education (SEE) committee
has advanced for "discussion" a
"common core curriculum,"
which all engineering students
would take as a basis for their
studies.
The SEE committee submitted
the core curriculum to "inter
ested parties" for comments. At
least three of the "interest par
ties" have responded in less than
enthusiastic terms. One member
of the committee has also re
sponded to the criticisms put
forth.
Criticism of the old core
curriculum has mounted in re
cent months, giving- impetus
to the present study aimed, In
part, at modifying the core to
provide a more logical and
functional list of required
courses.
The new core program is
based on the assumption that
there are "foundations of engi
neering" essential to all engi
neers. Some of the critics are
not prepared to concede even
this statement which is the basis
for the existence of the core.
Furthermore, the new SEE
core would allow a major in the
engineering school to take just
three units of elective courses in
his freshman year. The new
core would require freshman en
gineers to take 15 units of cal
culus, six units of physics,
twelve units of engineering as
well as nine units of english in
fulfillment of the General Stud
ies requirement. For a student
taking 15 units a quarter this
would leave just three units free
for. electives.
This apparently assumes that
the History of Western Civiliza
tion requirement will be abol
ished concurrently with the
adoption of the new engineering
program.
The assu mpt ion of the neces
sity of a common core and the
restrictive freshman year are
the basis for much of the crit
icism addressed to the com
mittee.

Professor James Gibbons of
the electrical engineering de
partment has attacked the very
necessity of any core curricu
lum. In a memorandum distrib
uted to members of the SEE
committee and other interested
parties Gibbons points out thnt
"in most institutions of our cali
bre there is either no engineer
ing core or a drastically reduced
one, compared to ours."
Gibbons has compared Stan
ford's present engineering pro
gram to that of seven other
schools including MIT, Cal Tech,
Berkeley and Princeton. Only
one of these schools has a core
program, Berkeley, and it takes
up five per. cent of the students
academic load, compared to 19.5
per cont at Stanford.
The electrical engineering
professor further notes that
under the present program "if
an engineering student wants
to graduate in 4 years he must
'take the pledge' upon arrival
and never break it." This sit
uation, Gibbons notes, makes
it difficult for transfer stu
dents and late entrants into
engineering to finish school in
four years.
What Gibbons proposes in this
area is to "permit people to
switch into engineering at the
latest possible moment with the
least possible loss of time toward
graduation."
In reply to Gibbons charges,
Ralph Smith, chairman of the
SEE committee and professor of
electrical engineering, com
mented, "I think he is absolutely
wrong in denying the existence
of a common foundation essen
tial for all engineers. To deny
this would be to imply that there
should be no general content in
the Bachelor's program at Stan
ford. Even though SES is pro
posing more flexibility in the
General Studies program, I have
seen no suggestion that it would
be abandoned."
David Tuttle, professor of
electrical engineering, has also
attacked both the present and
proposed core curriculums.
Tuttle proposes that "a good
undergraduate engineering ed
ucation for engineers" could

consist of 45 units each of
General Studies requirements,
Physics and Math, Engineer
ing and electives.
Tuttle criticizes the SEE mem
orandum because it "doesn't
take account of the SES paper
and seems to me far. too rigid."
His proposal assumes "that no
engineering as such is taken
outside of the department of ma
jor interest. I feel this could be
arranged to provide satisfactory
preparation for graduate school
—at least it is certainly true in
electrical engineering."
Eckhard Schulz, president of
Tau Beta Pi, the engineering

honors society, strongly sup
ports Tuttle's ideas. "I feel Pro
fessor Tuttle's idea is the best
I've heard. It allows the student
to educate himself and still al
lows the individual departments
to give the student the informa
tion that he needs," Schulz said.
There will be a meeting to
night to discuss the interim re
port of the SEE committee.
Sponsored by Tau Beta Pi, the
meeting will be held in the For
um Room of the Undergraduate
Library at 7:30 p.m. The core
curriculum will be just one of
several topics under discussion.


CRACKDOWN — After months of bumper to bumper traffic through the main library lot, Stan
ford officials have finally taken action to remedy the situation. Workmen are shown here digging
up the posts that blocked Galvez Street between Esoondido Road and Serra Street. But can traffic
now proceed straight down Galvez Street in a sensible way? Not a chance. The posts are back in
the street at the intersection of Galvez and Esoondido. Now, to get to Stern Hall, one is forced to
take the scenic route — Campus Drive — around the south end of the campus.
