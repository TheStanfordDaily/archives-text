# Canadians Prepare Anti-Draft Manual
## 
### 
TORONTO — In a major bid
to encourage Americans to evade
military conscription, the Toron
to Anti-Draft Programme plans
to put into the mail this week
about 5,000 copies of a "manual
for draft-age immigrants to Can
ada."
The book contains detailed ad
vice about how to qualify as a
Canadian immigrant and infor
mation about Canadian jobs and
school opportunities, housing,
politics, culture and climate.

The book is one of the mani
festations of the growing or
ganizational apparatus and fi
nancial strength of the Anti-
Draft Programme.
ProgTam Outline
Other such signs, as reported
by Mark I. Satin, the 21-year-old
director of the "Programme,"
are:
• A plan to rent a house, at
$250 to $350 a month, as a sec
ond hostel for draft dodgers. It
would sleep about 35 persons
and serve meals. The present
hostel, with a sleeping capacity
of 17, would continue to be used.
• A list of 200 Torontonians
who have offered to shelter and
feed draft dodgers until they can
get jobs and find their own
lodging.
• A list of earlier draft dodg
ers, whom newcomers may call
for advice and companionship.
• Establishment of an employ
ment service to help the youths
find jobs.
Job Situation Tight
The job situation now was de
scribed by several draft dodgers
as tight.
In general, interviews indi
cated draft dodgers can find
work by persistent hunting, but
may initially have to take jobs
for which they are over qual
ified.
Many draft dodgers with col
lege educations eventually get

teaching or other white-collar
jobs. The Canadian dollar is
worth 92 cents in American mon
ey.
Mr. Satin's office gives cash
grants to draft resisters who are
without funds.
Mr. Satin said his organization
was not short of funds. He said
that he did not know how much
it had spent last year because

books were not kept then. This
year's outlays will depend on
how much money comes in from
contributions, he said.
There is also an intimation
that an American youth who ac
cepts conscriptton is shirking a
moral responsibility. "The tough
est problem a draft resister faces
is not how to immigrate, but
whether, he really wants to," the

manual says."And only you can
answer that question, for your
self. That's what Nuremberg
was all about."
That evidently is a reference
to the World War II war crimes
trials at Nuremberg, Germany,
at which some accused Germans
pleaded that they were only fol
lowing orders. The tribunal gen
erally rejected that defense.

Job Situation Tight
The job situation now was de
scribed by several draft dodgers
as tight.
In general, interviews indi
cated draft dodgers can find
work by persistent hunting, but
may initially have to take jobs
for which they are over qual
ified.
Many draft dodgers with col
lege educations eventually get

teaching or other white-collar
jobs. The Canadian dollar is
worth 92 cents in American mon
ey.
Mr. Satin's office gives cash
grants to draft resisters who are
without funds.
Mr. Satin said his organization
was not short of funds. He said
that he did not know how much
it had spent last year because

books were not kept then. This
year's outlays will depend on
how much money comes in from
contributions, he said.
There is also an intimation
that an American youth who ac
cepts conscriptton is shirking a
moral responsibility. "The tough
est problem a draft resister faces
is not how to immigrate, but
whether, he really wants to," the

manual says."And only you can
answer that question, for your
self. That's what Nuremberg
was all about."
That evidently is a reference
to the World War II war crimes
trials at Nuremberg, Germany,
at which some accused Germans
pleaded that they were only fol
lowing orders. The tribunal gen
erally rejected that defense.

to encourage Americans to evade
military conscription, the Toron

Canadian immigrant and infor
mation about Canadian jobs and

festations of the growing or
ganizational apparatus and fi
nancial strength of the Anti-
Draft Programme.

Other such signs, as reported
by Mark I. Satin, the 21-year-old
director of the "Programme,"

• A plan to rent a house, at
$250 to $350 a month, as a sec
ond hostel for draft dodgers. It
would sleep about 35 persons

hostel, with a sleeping capacity
of 17, would continue to be used.
