# Transplant Heart Valves Show Bright Future Here
## 
### 
Surgeons at the Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine have
replaced defective aortic heart
valves in 40 patients with trans
plants from human donors who
have died.
Thirty-five patients have re
ceived the new valves success
fully. There were five postoper
ative deaths, none of which was
related to valve dysfunction. Of
the 40 patients, 28 were men
and 12 women. All patients were
severely limited by their valve
disease and four of them were
near death prior to the valve
replacement operation. The pa
tients are now leading normal
lives.

The aortic valve controls the
flow of blood from the heart
into the body's main artery.
For some time researchers
Have been seeking a way to use
human heart valves in replace
ment surgery instead of plastic
ones. Surgeons have known that
if a heart valve is removed from
a donor soon after death, and
transplanted into a patient
within five days, it will function
effectively.
"We believe," the surgeons
said, "that the experience re
ported here and other published
reports justify the current en
thusiasm over the use of aortic

valve homografts. That these
valves may function satisfactor
ily over long periods of time, up
to eight years . . . has been
proven."
The main advantages of the
graft technique is that patients
are not required to take anti
coagulant drugs to prevent clot
ting and the danger of late in
fection is minimized, the sur
geons reported.
The surgeons said "no in
stance of deterioration of the im
planted valves has appeared in
up to 10 months of observation"
in their patients and immune
rejection of the transplanted
valves has not been a problem.
