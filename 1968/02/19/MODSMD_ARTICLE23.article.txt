# Chinese Students' Problem: Isolation
## 
### SUE GASIORKIEWICZ 
Isolation is the chief problem
of the Chinese student at Stan
ford today.
But this isolation takes con
flicting forms. This is due to the
division in the three factions of
Chinese: the American-born sec
ond generation Chinese, those
who come directly from Hong
Kong, and those who come from
Taiwan.
One student, who came to
Stanford three years ago as a
freshman from Hong Kong, ex
pressed the first form of isola
tion, "My entire freshman year
I had no contact with other stu
dents from Taiwan and Hong
Kong."
He feels that because the
Hong Kong students are more
westernized and try to blend
in, they tend to follow the
"Ivory Tower image" of the
Stanford student and try not
to Identify with any group.
According to this student, the
American-born Chinese isolates
himself from the other Chinese
in much the same way, by "try
ing to conform to the Stanford
stereotype and trying to avoid
being associated with any par
ticular group."
There are 47 students from
Taiwan at Stanford, only one of
whom is an undergraduate.
These students exhibit a second
form of isolation. Thirteen of
them belong to the Stanford Chi
nese Club, the rest live by them
selves.
As Gary Fan, a second year
graduate student from Taiwan
and a member of the Chinese
Club, said, "I just cannot feel
that I'm in the United States."
Almost any evening, several
Chinese students can be found
in the Clubhouse playing Chi
nese chess or reading Chinese
newspapers. They have an eat
ing club consisting of 18 mem
bers who cook their own Chinese
food and Chinese is spoken at
every meal.
Although the Chinese Club
has been in existence for over
40 years, it has not been able
to unite the Chinese students
on campus.

Fan says,"It is hard to organ
ize Chinese students, especially
those from Taiwan. If student
comes here on his own support,
he studies hard because it is ex
pensive. If he gets scholarship
aid, he works hard to keep it.
They don't want to participate
in any activities, Chinese or
American. Most of them live
alone."
The Chinese Clubhouse is lo
cated directly behind the book
store. Chinese Club members be
ing from Taiwan find that the
language problem is their great
est difficulty.
They feel, however, that their
Chinese educational background
is better than most American
graduate students,' and this
helps compensate for their lan
guage difficulty.
Last year, the Chinese Club
attempted unsuccessfully to uni
fy the Chinese students at Stan
ford. They sent notices to stu
dents from Taiwan and Hong
Konk, but missed the Chinese-
American students, who were
offended.
Last quarter it was decided
that more drastic action would
have to be taken to unite the
students, and a Chinese Stu
dent Association (C.S.A.)
would be formed. This would
be modeled after the C.S.A. at
Berkeley which has been in
existence for ten years, al
though it has only been in the
last three years that it has be
come a workable organization.
Student organizers felt that
the C.S.A. would be possible
because of the success of the
"Funds For Refugees In Hong
Kong" campaigns at Stanford.
In 1966, the campaign netted
$6,000, in 1967, $7,000, and the
campaign was an opportunity
for students to work together.
Right now the C.S.A. is in the
process of writing a constitu
tion which they hope to have
finished by the begining of
next quarter so they can become
registered with the ASSU.
Chairman of the group, Billy
Wong, emphasized that the club
will have no political affiliations,

but will be open to anyone.
There may not be a formal mem
bership as such, but the group
may continue with its present
ten man steering committee.
The vice-chairman of the com
mittee will also be the chairman
of the Chinese Club.
Wong pointed out that the
club will be open to any nation
ality, and that club members
are not trying to create an im
age as a racial group. Anyone
who is interested is invited to
attend the functions.
In addition to solving the
problem of isolation of Chinese
students by having them get to
gether to talk and work, the
purpose of the C.S.A. will be to
increase interest in East-Asian
studies. Another purpose would
be to help the Volunteers in
Asia program.
Programs presented thus far
have been the refugee campaign,
informal talks, and the Chinese
New Year dinner-dance which
drew close to 200 people. More
informal talks with guest speak
ers have been planned, and next
quarter the C.S.A. hopes to pre
sent films which won awards at
the Asian Film Festival.

whom is an undergraduate.
These students exhibit a second
form of isolation. Thirteen of
them belong to the Stanford Chi
nese Club, the rest live by them
selves.
As Gary Fan, a second year
graduate student from Taiwan
and a member of the Chinese
Club, said, "I just cannot feel
that I'm in the United States."
Almost any evening, several
Chinese students can be found
in the Clubhouse playing Chi
nese chess or reading Chinese
newspapers. They have an eat
ing club consisting of 18 mem
bers who cook their own Chinese
food and Chinese is spoken at
every meal.
Although the Chinese Club
has been in existence for over
40 years, it has not been able
to unite the Chinese students
on campus.

Fan says,"It is hard to organ
ize Chinese students, especially
those from Taiwan. If student
comes here on his own support,
he studies hard because it is ex
pensive. If he gets scholarship
aid, he works hard to keep it.
They don't want to participate
in any activities, Chinese or
American. Most of them live
alone."
The Chinese Clubhouse is lo
cated directly behind the book
store. Chinese Club members be
ing from Taiwan find that the
language problem is their great
est difficulty.
They feel, however, that their
Chinese educational background
is better than most American
graduate students,' and this
helps compensate for their lan
guage difficulty.
Last year, the Chinese Club
attempted unsuccessfully to uni
fy the Chinese students at Stan
ford. They sent notices to stu
dents from Taiwan and Hong
Konk, but missed the Chinese-
American students, who were
offended.
Last quarter it was decided
that more drastic action would
have to be taken to unite the
students, and a Chinese Stu
dent Association (C.S.A.)
would be formed. This would
be modeled after the C.S.A. at
Berkeley which has been in
existence for ten years, al
though it has only been in the
last three years that it has be
come a workable organization.
Student organizers felt that
the C.S.A. would be possible
because of the success of the
"Funds For Refugees In Hong
Kong" campaigns at Stanford.
In 1966, the campaign netted
$6,000, in 1967, $7,000, and the
campaign was an opportunity
for students to work together.
Right now the C.S.A. is in the
process of writing a constitu
tion which they hope to have
finished by the begining of
next quarter so they can become
registered with the ASSU.
Chairman of the group, Billy
Wong, emphasized that the club
will have no political affiliations,

but will be open to anyone.
There may not be a formal mem
bership as such, but the group
may continue with its present
ten man steering committee.
The vice-chairman of the com
mittee will also be the chairman
of the Chinese Club.
Wong pointed out that the
club will be open to any nation
ality, and that club members
are not trying to create an im
age as a racial group. Anyone
who is interested is invited to
attend the functions.
In addition to solving the
problem of isolation of Chinese
students by having them get to
gether to talk and work, the
purpose of the C.S.A. will be to
increase interest in East-Asian
studies. Another purpose would
be to help the Volunteers in
Asia program.
Programs presented thus far
have been the refugee campaign,
informal talks, and the Chinese
New Year dinner-dance which
drew close to 200 people. More
informal talks with guest speak
ers have been planned, and next
quarter the C.S.A. hopes to pre
sent films which won awards at
the Asian Film Festival.


CHINESE CLUB — Set behind the Post Offlse on Sa'.vatierra
Street, this small, out-of-the-way cottage houses the Chinese Stu
dent Association and graphically testifies to its inhabitants' isola
tion.
Isolation is the chief problem
of the Chinese student at Stan
ford today.
But this isolation takes con
flicting forms. This is due to the
division in the three factions of
Chinese: the American-born sec
ond generation Chinese, those
who come directly from Hong
Kong, and those who come from
Taiwan.
One student, who came to
Stanford three years ago as a
freshman from Hong Kong, ex
pressed the first form of isola
tion, "My entire freshman year
I had no contact with other stu
dents from Taiwan and Hong
Kong."
He feels that because the
Hong Kong students are more
westernized and try to blend
in, they tend to follow the
"Ivory Tower image" of the
Stanford student and try not
to Identify with any group.
According to this student, the
American-born Chinese isolates
himself from the other Chinese
in much the same way, by "try
ing to conform to the Stanford
stereotype and trying to avoid
being associated with any par
ticular group."

The Chinese Clubhouse is lo
cated directly behind the book
store. Chinese Club members be
ing from Taiwan find that the
language problem is their great
est difficulty.
They feel, however, that their
Chinese educational background
is better than most American
graduate students,' and this
helps compensate for their lan
guage difficulty.
Last year, the Chinese Club
attempted unsuccessfully to uni
fy the Chinese students at Stan
ford. They sent notices to stu
dents from Taiwan and Hong
Konk, but missed the Chinese-
American students, who were
offended.
Last quarter it was decided
that more drastic action would
have to be taken to unite the
students, and a Chinese Stu
dent Association (C.S.A.)
would be formed. This would
be modeled after the C.S.A. at
Berkeley which has been in
existence for ten years, al
though it has only been in the
last three years that it has be
come a workable organization.
Student organizers felt that
the C.S.A. would be possible
because of the success of the
"Funds For Refugees In Hong
Kong" campaigns at Stanford.
In 1966, the campaign netted
$6,000, in 1967, $7,000, and the
campaign was an opportunity
for students to work together.
Right now the C.S.A. is in the
process of writing a constitu
tion which they hope to have
finished by the begining of
next quarter so they can become
registered with the ASSU.
Chairman of the group, Billy
Wong, emphasized that the club
will have no political affiliations,

but will be open to anyone.
There may not be a formal mem
bership as such, but the group
may continue with its present
ten man steering committee.
The vice-chairman of the com
mittee will also be the chairman
of the Chinese Club.
Wong pointed out that the
club will be open to any nation
ality, and that club members
are not trying to create an im
age as a racial group. Anyone
who is interested is invited to
attend the functions.
In addition to solving the
problem of isolation of Chinese
students by having them get to
gether to talk and work, the
purpose of the C.S.A. will be to
increase interest in East-Asian
studies. Another purpose would
be to help the Volunteers in
Asia program.
Programs presented thus far
have been the refugee campaign,
informal talks, and the Chinese
New Year dinner-dance which
drew close to 200 people. More
informal talks with guest speak
ers have been planned, and next
quarter the C.S.A. hopes to pre
sent films which won awards at
the Asian Film Festival.


CHINESE CLUB — Set behind the Post Offlse on Sa'.vatierra
Street, this small, out-of-the-way cottage houses the Chinese Stu
dent Association and graphically testifies to its inhabitants' isola
tion.
Isolation is the chief problem
of the Chinese student at Stan
ford today.
But this isolation takes con
flicting forms. This is due to the
division in the three factions of
Chinese: the American-born sec
ond generation Chinese, those
who come directly from Hong
Kong, and those who come from
Taiwan.
One student, who came to
Stanford three years ago as a
freshman from Hong Kong, ex
pressed the first form of isola
tion, "My entire freshman year
I had no contact with other stu
dents from Taiwan and Hong
Kong."
He feels that because the
Hong Kong students are more
westernized and try to blend
in, they tend to follow the
"Ivory Tower image" of the
Stanford student and try not
to Identify with any group.
According to this student, the
American-born Chinese isolates
himself from the other Chinese
in much the same way, by "try
ing to conform to the Stanford
stereotype and trying to avoid
being associated with any par
ticular group."
There are 47 students from
Taiwan at Stanford, only one of
whom is an undergraduate.
These students exhibit a second
form of isolation. Thirteen of
them belong to the Stanford Chi
nese Club, the rest live by them
selves.
As Gary Fan, a second year
graduate student from Taiwan
and a member of the Chinese
Club, said, "I just cannot feel
that I'm in the United States."
Almost any evening, several
Chinese students can be found
in the Clubhouse playing Chi
nese chess or reading Chinese
newspapers. They have an eat
ing club consisting of 18 mem
bers who cook their own Chinese
food and Chinese is spoken at
every meal.
Although the Chinese Club
has been in existence for over
40 years, it has not been able
to unite the Chinese students
on campus.

Fan says,"It is hard to organ
ize Chinese students, especially
those from Taiwan. If student
comes here on his own support,
he studies hard because it is ex
pensive. If he gets scholarship
aid, he works hard to keep it.
They don't want to participate
in any activities, Chinese or
American. Most of them live
alone."
