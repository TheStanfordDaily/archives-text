# More War Predicted
## Arab Scholar Hits U.S. Policy 
### 
Dr. Misham B. Sharabi predict
ed in a Tresidder Union speech
last Thursday night that unless
Israel accepts a political settle
ment or the United States en
forces its policy of territorial
integrity in the Middle East,
there will be "no way of escap
ing more violence."
Sharabi, a native of Lebanon
and professor of history and
government at Georgetown Uni
versity, advised the mostly fa
vorable audience from the start
that "I am speaking from the
Arab point of view, and I make
no apologies about it."
The goal of American policy
in the region, he said, seemed
to be to keep Russia out of the
area, "but the present govern
ment seems almost determined

to push the Arab states into the
arms of the Soviet Union."
"This makes a mockery of
American ideals," Sharabi de
clared. "Those Arabs who want
ed to be firmly linked to the
United States are now in des
pair."
"If there is no solution to the
crisis," he warned, "it will bring
a dangerous confrontation be
tween the U.S. and the Soviet
Union."
Arab Setback
Sharabi then listed the con
sequences of the June War: So
cial revolution in the Arab
World "has suffered a serious
setback."
"Much money continues to go
to defense at the cost of social
reform," he said.

Army rule has been reinforc
ed, and conservative regimes
now have "a new lease on life,"
Sharabi continued.
Most important, he observed,
is that the June War "has left
an indelible experience on the
younger generation. Arab hosti
lity to Zionism has never been
as deop or profound as it is
now."
Calling Zionism a "19th Cen
tury doctrine of racism," Shara
bi asserted that for the Arabs
"Zionism is an evil principle —
in its doctrines, methods, and
goals."
Anti-Colonial Struggle
Sharabi callnd the Arabs in
Palestine "a colonializod peo
ple," and compared their strug
gle to those of the Algerians and
Vietnamese:
"Has not every anti-colonial
revolution succeeded? The Arab
has "nothing else to lose. He has
learned that resistance is pos
sible even against an overwhelm
ingly superior force."
"But power has its own logic
and refuses to listen to reason
or history," he concluded, "and
if peace between Arabs and Zion
ism is never possible, peace be
tween Arabs and Jews is always
possible.' '

Sharabi, a native of Lebanon
and professor of history and
government at Georgetown Uni
versity, advised the mostly fa
vorable audience from the start
that "I am speaking from the
Arab point of view, and I make
no apologies about it."
The goal of American policy
in the region, he said, seemed
to be to keep Russia out of the
area, "but the present govern
ment seems almost determined

to push the Arab states into the
arms of the Soviet Union."
"This makes a mockery of
American ideals," Sharabi de
clared. "Those Arabs who want
ed to be firmly linked to the
United States are now in des
pair."
"If there is no solution to the
crisis," he warned, "it will bring
a dangerous confrontation be
tween the U.S. and the Soviet
Union."
Arab Setback
Sharabi then listed the con
sequences of the June War: So
cial revolution in the Arab
World "has suffered a serious
setback."
"Much money continues to go
to defense at the cost of social
reform," he said.

Army rule has been reinforc
ed, and conservative regimes
now have "a new lease on life,"
Sharabi continued.
Most important, he observed,
is that the June War "has left
an indelible experience on the
younger generation. Arab hosti
lity to Zionism has never been
as deop or profound as it is
now."
Calling Zionism a "19th Cen
tury doctrine of racism," Shara
bi asserted that for the Arabs
"Zionism is an evil principle —
in its doctrines, methods, and
goals."
Anti-Colonial Struggle
Sharabi callnd the Arabs in
Palestine "a colonializod peo
ple," and compared their strug
gle to those of the Algerians and
Vietnamese:
"Has not every anti-colonial
revolution succeeded? The Arab
has "nothing else to lose. He has
learned that resistance is pos
sible even against an overwhelm
ingly superior force."
"But power has its own logic
and refuses to listen to reason
or history," he concluded, "and
if peace between Arabs and Zion
ism is never possible, peace be
tween Arabs and Jews is always
possible.' '

Institute for International Rela

Dr. Misham B. Sharabi predict

Israel accepts a political settle
