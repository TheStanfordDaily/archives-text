# Reagan's Politics Reviewed
## 
### ROBIN KNIGHT Analysis 
In an article in the February
issue of 'Atlantic', it is written
that Gov. Ronald Reagan's polit
ical philosophy is based on a
book by R. C. Cornuelle, pub
lished in 1965, Reclaiming the
American Dream.
This book, it turns out, is a
classical example of laissez-faire
conservative theory. "Leave it
all to the good people, and they
will respond" runs the message.
"Unlimited government need
lessly compromises the Ameri
can dream," Cornuelle claims.
"There is a better way to do
most of its work."
That way is the 'independent
sector,' a collusion of institu
tions neither commercial nor
governmental, which meet hu
man needs without adding to
the power of government. But
what is the American dream,
one might well ask. It is, Corn
uelle confidently asserts, that
"the free society and the good
society can be realized together
. . . and for a hundred years and
more, it worked." "We were
free because we limited the pow
er of government."
This idyllic state was ended
by the Depression. The need for
governmental intervention at
that time led to the acceptance,
described by Galbraith, of the
need for functions to accrue to
the state "because, as a purely
technical matter, there is no
alternative to public manage
ment."
But They Disagree
In fact, Galbraith in the Af
fluent Society, and Cornuelle
could not be further apart. The
central theme of Galbraith's
book is the contrast between an
economy whose public sector,
starved of funds, is pathetic in
performance, and whose private
sector, bloated with riches, pours
out a mass of trivial products.
Cornuelle agrees that gov
ernment's welfare programs re
sult in little but frusrtation and
waste. So, one presumes, he
welcomed Reagan's $210 million
cut in California's Medicaid, and
a $17.7 million reduction of the

state's mental care program.
Similarly, pay increases for the
blind, which were stopped, and
dental care for schoolchildren on
welfare, which was ended, will
be justified on the grounds that
those needs can be met from the
long-forgotten and abused 'in
dependent sector'. So far there
seems to be a gap between
theory and practice.
The 'independent sector' is
that part of society which
should deal with public business
without governmental help. It
is not the same as the 'private
sector,' which Cornuelle says is
"profit-seeking commerce." The
"independent sector" should ac
tively compete with government.
At present it obviously is not:
in fact it is "corrupted" today
by too much financial depend
ence on government. Thus the
government "grows immune to
popular control."
There seems little that Corn
uelle, and presumably Reagan,
believes the 'independent sector'
cannot achieve. One gathers it
can end unemployment, poverty,
juvenile crime, air and water
pollution, and racial segrega
tion. It can also solve the farm
problem, give medical care to
all, renew towns and cities, and
obliterate slums.
Business Can Do Anything
It can, so the argument goes,
pay 'reasonable' pensions, han
dle the entire U.S. science pro
gram, and turn American for
eign policy into a world crusade
for human welfare. Reagan rec
ently applied this latter philoso
phy with regard to the Pueblo
incident.
At root, this theory revives
the notion of man's inherent
goodness. It is this motive that

Cornuelle believes will get the
fat, rich businessman off his
bottom, and into the ghettoes,
slums, and rural poverty areas.
When he gets there he will pro
duce the energy, dynamism, and
drive he shows daily in pursuit
of profit—but now he will be
satisfying his innate "desire for
meaningful service."
Cornuelle is aware that, to
date, the 'independent sector'
has rather let him down in
terms of actual performance.
This does not perturb him. He
explains this failure as a result
of the insidious, undermining
encroachment of government in
to private life which encourages,
and results in, dependence. The
desire to serve, which is char
acterised as the 'motive force'
of the 'independent sector,' has
not been destroyed completely.
It is on a revival of this energy
source that the conservative
message is based.
Shows Reagan's Approach
All this thinking shows in
Reagan's approach to govern
ment. It is to private charity he
invariably turns when he wishes
to switch off public welfare.
Business, not government, is
seen as the means through
which the racial problem can be
solved. "Make a man pay for

what he gets," might be the new
state motto Budget cuts, adver
tised as the hallmark of Rea
gan's regime, artti ' the largest
tax increase "this or any other
state ever contrived," not so
widely trumpeted, are seen as
the way to cure the ills of soci
ety.
The power of this theory is
its facilism and simplism. The
answer to all our problems is
readily and cheaply available to
us if only we would realize it.
The world's little men can now
get up and defy Uncle Sam,
John Bull, General deGaulle and
anyone else representing the
strength of central government.
This is a message which
points the way to the promised
land, whilst not forgetting to
emphasize the disasters that will
occur if we ignore the prophets
—'1984 and Brave New World'.
Technology is all right, so long
as you keep it strapped to the
laboratory table, and see that
scientists are strictly controlled
by ... . well, the government
has to do something. Otherwise
we wouldn't have movie actors
in Sacramento, would we?

"profit-seeking commerce." The
"independent sector" should ac
tively compete with government.
At present it obviously is not:
in fact it is "corrupted" today
by too much financial depend
ence on government. Thus the
government "grows immune to
popular control."
There seems little that Corn
uelle, and presumably Reagan,
believes the 'independent sector'
cannot achieve. One gathers it
can end unemployment, poverty,
juvenile crime, air and water
pollution, and racial segrega
tion. It can also solve the farm
problem, give medical care to
all, renew towns and cities, and
obliterate slums.
Business Can Do Anything
It can, so the argument goes,
pay 'reasonable' pensions, han
dle the entire U.S. science pro
gram, and turn American for
eign policy into a world crusade
for human welfare. Reagan rec
ently applied this latter philoso
phy with regard to the Pueblo
incident.
At root, this theory revives
the notion of man's inherent
goodness. It is this motive that

Cornuelle believes will get the
fat, rich businessman off his
bottom, and into the ghettoes,
slums, and rural poverty areas.
When he gets there he will pro
duce the energy, dynamism, and
drive he shows daily in pursuit
of profit—but now he will be
satisfying his innate "desire for
meaningful service."
Cornuelle is aware that, to
date, the 'independent sector'
has rather let him down in
terms of actual performance.
This does not perturb him. He
explains this failure as a result
of the insidious, undermining
encroachment of government in
to private life which encourages,
and results in, dependence. The
desire to serve, which is char
acterised as the 'motive force'
of the 'independent sector,' has
not been destroyed completely.
It is on a revival of this energy
source that the conservative
message is based.
Shows Reagan's Approach
All this thinking shows in
Reagan's approach to govern
ment. It is to private charity he
invariably turns when he wishes
to switch off public welfare.
Business, not government, is
seen as the means through
which the racial problem can be
solved. "Make a man pay for

what he gets," might be the new
state motto Budget cuts, adver
tised as the hallmark of Rea
gan's regime, artti ' the largest
tax increase "this or any other
state ever contrived," not so
widely trumpeted, are seen as
the way to cure the ills of soci
ety.
The power of this theory is
its facilism and simplism. The
answer to all our problems is
readily and cheaply available to
us if only we would realize it.
The world's little men can now
get up and defy Uncle Sam,
John Bull, General deGaulle and
anyone else representing the
strength of central government.
This is a message which
points the way to the promised
land, whilst not forgetting to
emphasize the disasters that will
occur if we ignore the prophets
—'1984 and Brave New World'.
Technology is all right, so long
as you keep it strapped to the
laboratory table, and see that
scientists are strictly controlled
by ... . well, the government
has to do something. Otherwise
we wouldn't have movie actors
in Sacramento, would we?
In an article in the February
issue of 'Atlantic', it is written
that Gov. Ronald Reagan's polit
ical philosophy is based on a
book by R. C. Cornuelle, pub
lished in 1965, Reclaiming the
American Dream.
This book, it turns out, is a
classical example of laissez-faire
conservative theory. "Leave it
all to the good people, and they
will respond" runs the message.
"Unlimited government need
lessly compromises the Ameri
can dream," Cornuelle claims.
"There is a better way to do
most of its work."
That way is the 'independent
sector,' a collusion of institu
tions neither commercial nor
governmental, which meet hu
man needs without adding to
the power of government. But
what is the American dream,
one might well ask. It is, Corn
uelle confidently asserts, that
"the free society and the good
society can be realized together
. . . and for a hundred years and
more, it worked." "We were
free because we limited the pow
er of government."
This idyllic state was ended
by the Depression. The need for
governmental intervention at
that time led to the acceptance,
described by Galbraith, of the
need for functions to accrue to
the state "because, as a purely
technical matter, there is no
alternative to public manage
ment."
But They Disagree
In fact, Galbraith in the Af
fluent Society, and Cornuelle
could not be further apart. The
central theme of Galbraith's
book is the contrast between an
economy whose public sector,
starved of funds, is pathetic in
performance, and whose private
sector, bloated with riches, pours
out a mass of trivial products.
Cornuelle agrees that gov
ernment's welfare programs re
sult in little but frusrtation and
waste. So, one presumes, he
welcomed Reagan's $210 million
cut in California's Medicaid, and
a $17.7 million reduction of the

state's mental care program.
Similarly, pay increases for the
blind, which were stopped, and
dental care for schoolchildren on
welfare, which was ended, will
be justified on the grounds that
those needs can be met from the
long-forgotten and abused 'in
dependent sector'. So far there
seems to be a gap between
theory and practice.
The 'independent sector' is
that part of society which
should deal with public business
without governmental help. It
is not the same as the 'private
sector,' which Cornuelle says is

The power of this theory is

answer to all our problems is
readily and cheaply available to
us if only we would realize it.
The world's little men can now
get up and defy Uncle Sam,

anyone else representing the
strength of central government.

In an article in the February
issue of 'Atlantic', it is written
that Gov. Ronald Reagan's polit
ical philosophy is based on a
book by R. C. Cornuelle, pub
lished in 1965, Reclaiming the
American Dream.
This book, it turns out, is a
classical example of laissez-faire
conservative theory. "Leave it
all to the good people, and they
will respond" runs the message.
"Unlimited government need
lessly compromises the Ameri
can dream," Cornuelle claims.
"There is a better way to do
most of its work."
That way is the 'independent
sector,' a collusion of institu
tions neither commercial nor
governmental, which meet hu
man needs without adding to
the power of government. But
what is the American dream,
one might well ask. It is, Corn
uelle confidently asserts, that
"the free society and the good
society can be realized together
. . . and for a hundred years and
more, it worked." "We were
free because we limited the pow
er of government."
This idyllic state was ended
by the Depression. The need for
governmental intervention at
that time led to the acceptance,
described by Galbraith, of the
need for functions to accrue to
the state "because, as a purely
technical matter, there is no
alternative to public manage
ment."
But They Disagree
In fact, Galbraith in the Af
fluent Society, and Cornuelle
could not be further apart. The
central theme of Galbraith's
book is the contrast between an
economy whose public sector,
starved of funds, is pathetic in
performance, and whose private
sector, bloated with riches, pours
out a mass of trivial products.
Cornuelle agrees that gov
ernment's welfare programs re
sult in little but frusrtation and
waste. So, one presumes, he
welcomed Reagan's $210 million
cut in California's Medicaid, and
a $17.7 million reduction of the

state's mental care program.
Similarly, pay increases for the
blind, which were stopped, and
dental care for schoolchildren on
welfare, which was ended, will
be justified on the grounds that
those needs can be met from the
long-forgotten and abused 'in
dependent sector'. So far there
seems to be a gap between
theory and practice.
The 'independent sector' is
that part of society which
should deal with public business
without governmental help. It
is not the same as the 'private
sector,' which Cornuelle says is
"profit-seeking commerce." The
"independent sector" should ac
tively compete with government.
At present it obviously is not:
in fact it is "corrupted" today
by too much financial depend
ence on government. Thus the
government "grows immune to
popular control."
There seems little that Corn
uelle, and presumably Reagan,
believes the 'independent sector'
cannot achieve. One gathers it
can end unemployment, poverty,
juvenile crime, air and water
pollution, and racial segrega
tion. It can also solve the farm
problem, give medical care to
all, renew towns and cities, and
obliterate slums.
Business Can Do Anything
It can, so the argument goes,
pay 'reasonable' pensions, han
dle the entire U.S. science pro
gram, and turn American for
eign policy into a world crusade
for human welfare. Reagan rec
ently applied this latter philoso
phy with regard to the Pueblo
incident.
At root, this theory revives
the notion of man's inherent
goodness. It is this motive that

Cornuelle believes will get the
fat, rich businessman off his
bottom, and into the ghettoes,
slums, and rural poverty areas.
When he gets there he will pro
duce the energy, dynamism, and
drive he shows daily in pursuit
of profit—but now he will be
satisfying his innate "desire for
meaningful service."
Cornuelle is aware that, to
date, the 'independent sector'
has rather let him down in
terms of actual performance.
This does not perturb him. He
explains this failure as a result
of the insidious, undermining
encroachment of government in
to private life which encourages,
and results in, dependence. The
desire to serve, which is char
acterised as the 'motive force'
of the 'independent sector,' has
not been destroyed completely.
It is on a revival of this energy
source that the conservative
message is based.
Shows Reagan's Approach
All this thinking shows in
Reagan's approach to govern
ment. It is to private charity he
invariably turns when he wishes
to switch off public welfare.
Business, not government, is
seen as the means through
which the racial problem can be
solved. "Make a man pay for

what he gets," might be the new
state motto Budget cuts, adver
tised as the hallmark of Rea
gan's regime, artti ' the largest
tax increase "this or any other
state ever contrived," not so
widely trumpeted, are seen as
the way to cure the ills of soci
ety.
