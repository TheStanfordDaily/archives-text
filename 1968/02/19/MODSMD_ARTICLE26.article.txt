# Salvage UCLA Win
## USC Swims Past Cards 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
USC tenaciously preserved a
97 meet undefeated string, beat
ing Stanford swimmers 64-49
Thursday in Los Angeles. Fri
day, the Indians held on to turn
back an inspired UCLA squad,
57-56.
USC clinched the meet with
57 points in the next-to-last
event. The Trojans won the free
style relay by a touch to keep
the Cards from closing the gap
to 57-56.
UCLA geared their season
toward knocking off Stanford.
The Bruins got off slow, but
nearly caught the Indians.
Stanford, like USC the night
before, won the meet before
the last relay.
USC's strength in distance
freestyle was a telling factor
in the Trojans' victory. World
record holder Greg Charlton
won both 200 and 500 freestyles,
and Greg Fink took the 1000.
Stanford sprinter Ken Ham
mer upset USC's Pan Am cham
pion Don Havens, winning the
100 free in 47.2. Hammer also
tied for first in the 50 at 22.0.
Indian Bill Main aced both
low board and high board events
in a diving competition where
the judging brought more
laughs than the announcer's hu
mor.
The Cards may have put
themselves at a disadvantage
asking several individuals to
swim brutal "doubles" to
counterbalance the Trojans'
longer bench-
Dick Roth won the 200 IM and
then took second behind South
ern Cal's AAU champion back
stroker Mark Mader in the 200
back. Five minutes later, Roth
hit the 200 breaststroke.
Captain Bob Momsen swam
the 200 free after a brief pause
after the medley relay and later
won the 200 breaststroke. Pete
Siebert led off the medley re
lay, picked up second in the 200
IM, and barged back in the 200
butterfly.
Mike Wall, second in the 1000
behind Fink, kept Stanford's
hopes alive late in the meet,
beating Fink in the 500 with
Wall's midseason best effort,
4:49.4.
In retrospect, Stanford coach,
Jim Gaughran notes that load
ing the medley relay with top
personnel was "an expensive
gamble." USC won it.
As in any close meet, there
are always a number of "if's."
A missed turn dropped Mor
gan Manning from a solid sec
ond to fourth in the 100 free,
a judges' decision tie in the
50 —a break the other way
would have laid the meet on
the last relay. More ifs.
UCLA, fifth in the NCAA's
last year, was ready and wait
ing for an upset. The time was
ripe, for Stanford's Luis Nicolao
left for the South American
Championships after the USC
meet. Bruin NCAA champions
Zac Zorn and Mike Burton put
muscle behind the threat.
Zorn overshadowed some

speedy Stanford sprint perform
ances as he skimmed to a 20.9
in the 50 free to tie the Ameri
can record. Zorn also burned up
the 100 free in 46.1 and led off
UCLA's winning free relay.
Burton took on perhaps the
most rugged triple in a dual
meet, the 1000 and 500 free
styles and the 200 fly—and won
every one.
Bruin breaststroker Paul Lot
man upset Stanford's Bob Mom
sen in the 200 breaststroke.
Momsen's 10:10 1000 freestyle
earlier in the meet may have
proved a costly adventure.
Bill Main won both diving
events, beating UCLA's Gor
don Creed, former Australian
national chamipon. Dick Roth
won both the IM and the
backstroke, and Mike Wall
captured the 200 free in a
brisk 1:45.8. But it was the
second and third men that
turned the tide in the medley
relay and the individual
events.
Bob Hart came from behind
to pick up second in the 200
back and Richie Williams churn
ed to his best 200 IM in college,
2:04.6, for second place.
John Parker, after losing to
UCLA's second diver in the low
board, came back to pick up a
golden point by beating him in
the high board.
Stanford sprinters put spark
into the Stanford lineup. Ken
Hammer dropped his 50 time to
21.7 and later boiled to an in
credible 45.9 anchor leg on the
free relay. Jeff Hammett put a
46.8 on the end of the medley
relay to seal a solid Stanford
7 points.
Morgan Manning led off the
free relay in 47.7 and also gob
bled up the breaststroke leg of
the medley relay in 1:00.7.
UCLA (3:08.3) and Stanford
(3:08.8) hit the two fastest free
relays in the country.
Quoth Pete Siebert after the
freestyle relay, "Happiness is 57
points."
The varsity has no more dual
meets this season. The Indians
will swim hard without peaking
for the conference meet, except
those swimmers who have to
meet NCAA qualifying stan
dards. It will be another under
dog role at the NCAA's five
weeks from now, which didn't
cramp the Card's style last year.

1000 meter freestyle event but Wall came back to win the 500 to keep Indian hopes alive late in the
meet.
