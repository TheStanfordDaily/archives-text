# Husky Surge Sinks Tribe
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
After falling 91-80 to a great
second-half rally by Washing
ton Saturday night, Stanford's
Indians will try to salvage a
split from their northern road
trip tonight when they meet a
rugged Washington State five at
8 p.m.
The loss dropped Stanford's
Pacific-8 record to 2-5, while
Washington's Huskies won their
third game in eight outings.
The Huskies, seeking revenge
for a 97-75 drubbing at the hands
of the Indians last week, trail
ed 36-35 at halftime. But a tor
rid shooting exhibition by for

wards Dave Carr and George
Irvine, each of whom scored 19
second-half points, turned the
tide for the home club.
Washington coach Mac
Duckworth, disappointed with
his team's showing last week
end, made four changes in the
starting lineup. Senior captain
Carr was the only regular who
started Saturday. He was Join
ed by sophs Larry Bullock at
forward, Gary Larson at cen
ter and Pat Wool cock at
guard ,plus junior guard Rick
Slettedahl.
Don Griffin scored Stanford's
first five points as the visitors

grabbed a quick 5-2 lead. Min
utes later it was 9-5, and Duck
worth began to insert his regu
lars.
Sophomore Irvine came on to
score four quick points, and reg
ular center Jay Bond hit a three
point play to give the Huskies
an 18-15 edge.
Free throws by Gary Peters
meyer and Art Harris, plus a
breakaway layup by Chuck
Moore following a steal put Stan
ford back on top 19-18. With
Griffin scoring well from the
field and Harris hitting from the
foul line, the Tribe held onto the
lead for the rest of the half.

Stanford's biggest lead was
five points, at 27-22. But numer
ous travelling violations by the
Indians, plus a tip-in and a 28-
foot fallaway enabled the Hus
kies to creep to within one at
halftime, 36-35.
Carr hit a six-foot banker
at the outset of the second half
to give Washington a 37-36
edge, and the Huskies never
trailed after that. Carr and Ir
vine buried Washington's first
16 points between them while
Stanford could manage only
seven markers, as the lead
mushroomed to 51-43.
Mai McElwain and Harris
combined for nine points to four
for Washington, as Stanford
surged to within three, at 61-58.
But that was the closest the
Tribe was to come, as the Hus
kies tanked 15 points to four for
Stanford in the following five
minutes to break the gamp open.
Irvine netted seven and Carr
six during that span, and Wash
ington grabbed a 76-62 advan
tage. After that the visitors wore
forced to play catchup.
The Huskies exploited a no
ticeable rebounding edge in the
second half, constantly limiting
the Indians to one shot. The 6-9
Bond, a soph who grabbed only
five rebounds in an uninspired
effort last weekend, combined
with Carr and Irvine to control
the boards. McElwain, Stanford's
leading reboundor, fouled out
with 10:56 left to go and his
team trailing by only six, and
this proved a serious jolt to the
Tribe's hopes.
Washington's biggest lead
was 20 points, at 89-69, but
Stanford cut to 11 by out
scoring the winners 11-2 In the
waning minutes of the game.
A tip-in by sub Greg Osborn
just before the buzzer closed
out the scoring at 91-80.
Irvine led all scorers with 27,
his high game for the season.
He was closely followed by
Carr, who funneled 25 in a great
all-around performance. Bond
chipped in with 12.
Harris led the losers with 24
points, while Griffin added 17.
Tonight the Indians face a
strong WSU quintet which rout
ed Cal 87-66 Saturday. Last Fri
day the Cougars edged Stanford
74-71 by utilizing a great height
advantage.
Jim McKean ,star 6-9 center,
anchors a front line that also
includes 6-8 Ted Wierman and
6-6 Gary Elliot. To upset the
Cougars, Stanford will have to
substitute speed -and shooting
accuracy for height.
Stanford coach Howie Dall

mar sees the game hinging on
his club's ability to hit from the
perimeter.
"WSU will play the same type
of zone they used last week,
with those three redwood trees
underneath," the Tribe mentor
commented.
"We'll have to hit from the
outside to open it up." Last night
the Indians shot in the neighbor
hood of 35 per cent from the
floor.
