# Varsity Humbles Frosh In Opening Red-White Contest
## 
### BOB BUND 
On Angell Field, still heavy
with rain from the advent of the
local Monsoon season which an
nually ushers in Stanford Track,
a proud Varsity outran a highly
touted, but humbled Frosh team
96-54 in Saturday's Red versus
White meet.
The meet, which Coach Pay
ton Jordan called, "Our best
early season performances in
the last two or three years,"
was typlified by the 888 yard
run. Jordan said the race, in
which Frosh star Pete Fairchild
held off a fast closing senior
Mike Jacobs to win by a tenth
in 1:54.0 was "a classic that cap
tured the whole spirit of the
meet."
Jacobs, who let Fairchild set
the pace early in the race, tried
to pass him on the backstretch
of the second lap, but Fairchild
accelerated forcing Jacobs to
the outside causing him to lose
his momentum.
Jacobs, who was disappointed
but not discouraged, quipped
jokingly ,"I guess I was too easy
on him, I was trying to help

him build up confidence."
Greg Brock captured both the
mile and two mile races in an
unusually strong show of early
season stamina. In the mile he
left the field after trailing fresh
men Duncan Mac Donald, who
finished second, through the half
to finish in 4:15.3. In the longer
race he pulled away from Don
Kardong after the first mile, to
break through the tape in 9:15.1.
Another strong double was
turned in by Dave Harrington,
who threw the discus 170'3" for
a seasons best and putted the
shot 5Y4V2".
The two teams seemed to fit
together like a jigsaw puzzle
with the Frosh being strong in
the events that the Varsity were
weak and vis-versa. The frosh,
lead by Rick Tipton slammed
the high hurdle places, but the
Varsity, led by NCAA veteran
Jim Ward took all three places
in the quarter.
Andy Sears and freshman
Charlie Francis dominated the
sprints. Francis won the hun
dred in 10.1 with Sears second.
In the 200 the order was re

versed with Sears winning in
the unusually fast 220 turn time
of 20.9.
Varsity Takes Relays
The Varsity took both the 440
and Mile relays. Sears made up
five yards on Massey on the
third leg in the 440 relay and in
the mile relay Tom Kommers
teamed with quarter-milers
Ward, Dan Woodruff, and Larry
Larson to win easily in 3:24.6.
Coach Jordan said the meet
was "a very good indication of
just where we're at right now."
The Long Jump was the best
example of what the coaches
learned. Although Craig Vaughn
won it with a leap of 23-3%, he
and two other jumpers barely
fouled on jumps of over 24 feet!
It could be a very interesting
year.
