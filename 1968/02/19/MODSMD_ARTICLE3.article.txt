# Cong Prisoner Shot, 'Common Practice'

ZINH LOI BRIDGE, Vietnam
(AP)â€” His leg shattered, Ngo
Van Tranh crouched in the
wreckage of a wooden hut on
the edge of Saigon. The first
Vietnamese marines to capture
him gave him water.
The next marines to pass by
questioned Tranh suspiciously.
The third group did not hesi
tate. One Vietnamese marine
killed him with a burst of Ml 6
fire in the chest.
The killing of wounded by
both sides has b<*come com
mon practice in recent weeks.
An American Ranger ad
viser told a newsman matter
of-factly last week, "We us
ually kill the seriously wound
ed Viet Cong for two reasons.
One is that the hospitals are
so full of our own soldiers and
civilians there is no room for
the enemy.
"The second is that
you've seen five-year-old girls
with their eyes blindfolded,
their arms tied behind thoir
backs, and bullets in their brain,
you look for revenge. I saw two
little girls that dead yesterday.
One hour ago I shot a wounded
Viet Cong."

The death of Tranh, 28, who
claimed he was forced to carry
ammunition for the Viet Cong in
the Sunday morning second
wave attack against this strate
gic bridge in the northern out
skirts of Saigon, was another
macabre incident in the contin
uing battles of the cities.
With the death toll mounting
daily, human life is being
snuffed out as casually as can
dlelight.
In the case of the wounded
prisoner killed by the Vietna
mese marines, an officer had
earlier instructed that Tranh be
kept alive and given medical
treatment.
His death one hour later came
at the hands of a marine private
who had glared at the prisoner
and cocked his weapon when the
wounded man asked for a ciga
rette.
An Associated Press photogra
pher, standing nearby heard the
marine cry, "I'll give you
death," and lunge forward with
a knife which he plunged into
the man's shoulder. Then he
stood back and fired three
bursts from his Ml 6 into the
prisoner.
