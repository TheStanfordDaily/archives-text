# Tribe Trounces Alums With Aid Of Walks And Errors
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
Although held to two hits, the
Stanford Indians combined ten
walks and four opposition er
rors to down the Stanford
Alumni 8-1. Managed by Jack
Shepard, '53, and Bob Murphy,
'53, 16 alumni showed up to
battle the Tribe, but it was a
battle only for the first three in
nings.
Darrel Sutherland, '63, and a
member of the Cleveland In
dian Roster picthod the first 3
innings for the Alums. The only
man to reach safely against
Sutherland was Phil Keller when
hit by pitch in the third. Dar
rel looked sharp as he fanned
three and allowed only one ball
hit out of the infield.
The Alumni even managed to
go ahead 1-0 in the top of the
fourth when Ray Swarts, '56,
scored on Jack Hibbs, '66, sac
rifice fly.
Swarts had reached first on
a base on balls issued by the
second Tribe pitcher Bob Moore.
Marty Erck, '67, then singled
Swarts to third to set up the
Alumni's only score.
But in the bottom of the fourth
the Tribe took the lead 2-1 off
of pitcher Jim Blaschke with

out the benefit of a hit. Walks
to Mark Marquess and Bob Gal
lagher plus three wild pitches
by Blaschke enabled the Tribe
to score 2 easy runs, which
proved to be all the scoring they
needed.
Moore ,who worked the 3rd
and 4th innings, was given cre
dit for the win, while Blaschke
suffered the loss.
Rod Poteete started for the
Tribe. Poteete allowed only a
single to the seven men he faced
and struck out four.
Bob Sharp worked the fifth
and sixth innings and didn't al
low a hit. Harvey Shank follow
ed Sharp and allowed only a
double to Hy Lewis, '68, in his
two innings. Frank Klinger
finished up in the ninth. Alto
gether, Tribe pitchers fanned 12
and walked only two as they
continue to shine in the early
season.
Schomaker's and Keller's
doubles were the only hits for
the Indians as they still cannot
get untracked at the plate.
They were even set down
1-2-3 by their own coach Ray
Coung, '56, who pitched the
ninth for the Alumni.
The S.F. State game was rain-

Ed out Friday so Stanford still
has not played a varsity team.
Their first varsity competition is
scheduled for Tuesday against
University of California at
Davis, at the Sunken Diamond,
weather permitting of course.
