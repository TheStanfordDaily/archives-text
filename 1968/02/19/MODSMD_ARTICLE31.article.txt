# Gymnasts Attain Highest Point Total In Losing Performance
## 
### BOB RUND 
An anemic performance on the
sidohorse again proved to be
the Achilles Heel of the Stan
ford Gymnastics team in their
loss to San Jose State and
UCSB Friday.
The Indians scored their high
total of the season with 151.88,
but they never were able to
make up the 12.5 points they
gave up in the side horse to San
Jose or the 10.15 to UCSB.
After losing the side horse
and floor exercise routine to
San Jose, Stanford's gymnasts
gallantly beat out the Spar
tan gymnasts in ring, tram
poline, long horse, parallel
bars, and horizontal bars com
petition, but they still finished
over eleven points behind San
Jose's 163.30.
Tribe gymnasts had eroded
UCSB's lead down to seven
tenths of a point with only the
horizontal bar remaining, but
even with Craig Dickson's 9.1
performance the Indians failed
to overcome Santa Barbara's bal

ance in this event. USCB finish
ed with 153.75.
Little Tony Coppola of San
Jose won the all-around com
petition with a score of 51.50
followed by Haven Sliver with

45.20 and Dickson with 43.88.
Dickson would have scored
much higher, but a weak ankle
prevented him from dismount
ing: properly in any of his rou
tines.
