# Linguists To Codify Universals
## 
### 
A research team headed by
two Stanford linguists will at
tempt the first steps in codify
ing the world's "language uni
versals" â€” features common to
all of the 4-to-5,000 languages in
the world.
Chief investigators fon the
project are Prof. Charles A. Rer
guson of linguistics and Prof.
Joseph H. Greenberg of anthro
pology.
The researchers will first
tackle some preliminary prob
lems in various samples of lan
guages, including American In
dian, Ethiopian, and some of the
principal world languages.
During the two-year period
they will determine the size and
nature of the sample of langu
ages to be examined in the full
project,
The research is an outgrowth
of 10 years of discussions be
tween linguists and psycholo
gists on the relationships be
tween languages and the basic
principles of human behavior.
