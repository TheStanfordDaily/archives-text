styles of music ranging from
old blues to James Brown. John
Siscoe, a Breakers member who
helped sponsor Guy said, "Bud
dy has been one of the three
main influences helping to de

blues guitar playing. Buddy
plays in an extremely intense
urban blues style which is a
significant transformation from
old-time, country blues. I really
dig him."
Admission is $1.50 per person.
Tickets are on sale on White
Plaza at noon and will be sold

John Galgiani, another Break

soul."

years.
Guy's style of playing blues
guitar has been one of the main
influences of such guitarists as
Eric Clapton of the "Cream"
and Mike Bloomfield of the
"Electric Flag."
Guy and his band appeared at
Stanford last autumn; right af
ter that appearance Guy left
for a three month jazz tour of
Europe playing with musicians
such as trumpeter Miles Davis
and others.
Guy and his group are now
starting on a tour of the United
States and very soon will be
releasing an album on the Van
guard label.
The versatile band of five mu
sicians, (two saxophones, two
guitars and a drummer) plays
styles of music ranging from
old blues to James Brown. John
Siscoe, a Breakers member who
helped sponsor Guy said, "Bud
dy has been one of the three
main influences helping to de

velop the character of Chicago
blues guitar playing. Buddy
plays in an extremely intense
urban blues style which is a
significant transformation from
old-time, country blues. I really
dig him."
Admission is $1.50 per person.
Tickets are on sale on White
Plaza at noon and will be sold
at the door.
John Galgiani, another Break
er's member commented, "Buddy
gives a real great show. People
here will get twice the show
given at the Avalon for half the
price. If you don't like Buddy
Guy, you have a hole in your
soul."
