## 
### 
"The McCarthy Issue: a panel
to critically assess McCarthy's
candidacy" will be held on Mon
day, February 19, in Tresidder
room 274-5, at 8:45 p.m.
Stanford Community of the
Left asked Stanford Committee
for McCarthy to co-sponsor the
debate in order to get the basic
issues, pro and con, aired. The
panelists will be outlining what

they feel to be the basic cri
teria that need to be met be
fore a candidacy, such as Mc-
Carthy's, can be evaluated as a
positive alternative to the status
quo.
Two of the panelists, Mark
Mancall (Far Eastern History
professor) and Rick Levin (for
mer sponsor and history stu
dent) will argue in support of
McCarthy's candidacy. The oth
er two, Steve Weissman (Latin
Americanist and radical jour
nalist) and David Ransom (Mid
peninsula editor and "muck
raker" of Stanford war indus
try) will basically criticize it.
The panelists will not be team
debating, but will rather have
a four-way dialogue, which will
extend to the audience after
initial speeches and questions
among the panelists.
All members of the Stanford
community are encouraged to at
tend and participate in the dis
cussion. It will be moved to
Room 320-Quad if the group is
large.
