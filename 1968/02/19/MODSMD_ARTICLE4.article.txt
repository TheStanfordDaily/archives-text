# Rep. Gubser Speaks
## Use Of A-Bomb Supported 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Stanford's Congressman said
Friday he approves the use of
low yield, tactical nuclear wea
pons by American forces in
Vietnam.
Decisions to use nuclear wea
pons should be left to the mili
tary, especially since low yield
weapons "are not at all as dan
gerous as some Americans
think," according to Charles S.
jGubser, Republican Represen
tative for Santa Clara County.
However, Gubser indicated
that his general position on the
Vietnam conflict has shifted to
a more dovish stand over the
past few months.
He indicated that he no
longer advocates further es
calation of American ground
forces in Vietnam. "VVe should
maintain our military presence
there at the present level of
commitment," he said, refer
ring to the current limit of
525,000 troops.
Instead, we should direct the
thrust of our efforts to "social,
economic, and political progress.
A military victory is not pos
sible. We should provide secur
ity for the area we now control."
A shift in emphasis to econ
omic and social effort would
mean "a new outlook, a new
slant" that "any prominent Re
publican" could bring to the
presidency. "They would all be
better than what we have now."
he said.
Gubser was very critical of
President Johnson's handling of

the war effort. "We have been
consistently misled regarding
the progress of the war," he
said.
"Throughout the war, we have
held back and have given the
North Vietnamese the chance to
build air defenses. We lost the
chance two years ago to win it.
"We must not again involve
ourselves in a military confron
tation that we are not willing to
win. We can't be the police force
for the entire world."
However, continued presence
of U.S. troops in Vietnam is es
sential, according to Gubser. "I
still think the domino theory
is valid. Laos, Cambodia, an-*
Thailand would probably fall if
we withdraw."
Although continued military
pressure is imperative, Gubser
indicated that he has not reject
ed the idea of withdrawal of
American troops from Southeast
Asia. "We may someday hav<->
to look at the possibility of uni
lateral withdrawal. But first we
have to search out other means
to bring this thing to an end."
On the subject of the draft,
Gibser stated that recent draft
developments "are going to
create a crisis for graduate
schools." lie estimated that
Stanford's graduate enroll
ment may Im> cut by one-third
to one-half.
In a Daily interview after the
press conference, Gubser claim
ed that he keeps close contact
with Stanford's problems. He
telephones University admini

strators weekly and maintains
close correspondence with sev
eral Stanford faculty members.
He attended a campus briefing
on the draft with Stanford ad
ministrators last week.
To avert a "serious blow to
graduate education," Gubser
said he has asked the chairman
of the House Armed Services
Committee, of which he is a
member, "to begin hearings so
we can look at the facts and
figures to see if we need
changes."
Gubser sees the possibility
of greater use of reserve forces
as a solution to larger future
draft calls. "If there are ready
and able reserve units available,
we should be able to use them
and lower our draft callups," he
feels.
He indicated that there haven't
been earlier callups because
"Secretary McNamara was ada
mant about building up there
â€¢serves and refused to admit
that we are being worn thin
militarily."
