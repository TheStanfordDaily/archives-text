SAIGON (AP) — A Commu

bound American serviceman and
wounded 21 others at Saigon's
Tan Son Nhut air base Monday
as the busy field continued un

the reds second-wave assaults
across Vietnam on Sunday.
Thn Americans had been wait

Vietnam tours.
A U.S. spokesman said the
rocket exploded at 6:04 a.m. in
the lobby of Tan Son Nhut's ci

traveling American soldiers. He
said the missile was a 3-foot
long, Soviet-designed 122 mm
rocket of a type the enemy used
in the Saigon area for the first

"intentions are not elear at this
point."
Guerrilla gunners were active
in at least two other areas in
Saigon late Sunday. A police
spokesman said three civilians
were killed and 20 wounded by
20 mortar rounds that hit a
slum block and the Ministry of
Labor courtyard in the center
of the capital.

as the busy field continued un

Thn Americans had been wait

A U.S. spokesman said the

• Tan Son JSlmt Hit
SAIGON (AP) — A Commu
nist rocket killed one homeward
bound American serviceman and
wounded 21 others at Saigon's
Tan Son Nhut air base Monday
as the busy field continued un
der sporadic shell fire following
the reds second-wave assaults
across Vietnam on Sunday.
Thn Americans had been wait
ing for flights back to the Unit
ed States after completing their
Vietnam tours.
A U.S. spokesman said the
rocket exploded at 6:04 a.m. in
the lobby of Tan Son Nhut's ci
vilian terminal, a two-story
building usually crowded with
traveling American soldiers. He
said the missile was a 3-foot
long, Soviet-designed 122 mm
rocket of a type the enemy used
in the Saigon area for the first
time Sunday.
Three South Vietnamese po
licemen also were wounded.
Field reports indicated the
second-wave rocket and mortar
barrages on Saigon and 46 other
cities and military installations
lacked the punch of the Tet's
Jan. 30 lunar new year offen
sive.
The shelling was followed by
ground attacks in a few places
and the oeprations chief at Gen.
William C. Westmoreland's
headquarters said the enemy's

"intentions are not elear at this
point."
Guerrilla gunners were active
in at least two other areas in
Saigon late Sunday. A police
spokesman said three civilians
were killed and 20 wounded by
20 mortar rounds that hit a
slum block and the Ministry of
Labor courtyard in the center
of the capital.
