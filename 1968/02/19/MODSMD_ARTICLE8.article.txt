# Don't Underrate Your Draft Board
## 
### 
To the hundreds of Stanford men about to lose their student
deferments, we have this advice:
Don't lose faith in the inefficiency and equity of your local draft
board. The System's ineptness will probably give you a long breath
ing spell before you must make a final decision on how to cope
with compulsion, the military, and the war.
The letter of the law says abolish graduate deferments and draft
the oldest men under 26 first. But there is no central bureaucracy
enforcing this rule. Instead America has 4,100 local boards, each
granted considerable freedom to draft or defer whom they please.
In the past these boards have shown glacial slowness in adjust
ing to changes in the regulations. In other words, they became
swamped in their own paperwork. By the time your case comes
up for consideration, the draft law might be changed.
The draft boards have many ways to fill their monthy quotas
from the Selective Service headquarters. Each board has a pool
of 1-A's—college drop-outs, 19-year-olds just out of high school,
and men who once had occupational deferments or 1-Y deferments,
as well as graduate students. Whom the board actually orders for
induction depends frequently on its subjective evaluation of the
importance of his present activity. Many draft boards will hesitate
to induct a serious student when other men are available. Law or
no law.
Furthermore, draft boards aren't blind to the preferences of the
Army. It's easier to "mold" the behavior of a 19-year-old than a
23-year-old college graduate. The Army wants younger men.
And the draft boards themselves prefer the docile type. College
graduates are more apt to refuse flaty to have anything to do with
Selective Service. In a survey of Harvard seniors, 28 per cent said
they would go to jail, leave the country, or fight induction in the
courts rather than submit to the draft.
What all this means is that a June graduate may be several
months into his first year of graduate study before he is even re
classified 1-A. His actual chances of being drafted are unknown.
Men sometimes stay 1-A for years while their draft boards shuffle
paper.
The Selective Service Act of 1967 cannot endure. Its mandatory
deferments for undergraduates and total jeopardy for graduates
displease everyone—the Army and the universities alike. Univer
sity officials have learned the penalty for political inactivity, and
hopefully will step up their lobbying for quick repeal of the 1967
law.
So the senior or first-year graduate student shouldn't jump to
any conclusions about his certainty of being drafted. We sub
scribe to the advice Dean Virgil Whitaker has for the graduate:
"I would tell him he should go ahead with the normal course
of his life. It's the only rational thing to do in this kind of world."
