# From A Reporter's Notebook
## The 						Bicycle Brigade 
### DIARMUID McGUIRE 
It has become obvious to
American military strategists
that the air war against North
Vietnam has not successfully in
terdicted the flow of supplies to
Communist troops in the South.
Most Pentagon theorists blame
our failure on the insidious use
of preindustrial means of trans
portation by the enemy.
In fact, it is the bicycle that
is ruining us. One North Viet
namese bicycle can carry 400
pounds of ammunition or food
to Red units south of the DMZ.
Five can carry a ton.
The bikes and their cargoes
are easily concealed and, if de
stroyed, they can be replaced at
low cost.
Hard to Persuade
Moreover, it has become in
creasingly difficult to persuade
American pilots to attack bi
cycles.
"I just feel silly," said one F-4
Phantom jockey, "zooming down
at 700 miles per hour in a two
million dollar ship to shoot at
a Chinese Schwinn."
"I can handle a Volkswagen
Microbus, but I draw the line
at bikes," another pilot said.
"That pedal-pusher down there
might just mess my plane with

his $17.98 Czechoslovakian
rifle.' '
We recently visited Air Force
general Sam "Sockitouem" Drop
pit at the Fort Void Proving
Grounds to ask him what the
military-industrial complex is go
ing to do about this situation.
"I'm glad ya stopped by, son,"
said General Droppit. "We have
just perfected a weapon design
ed to nullify the enemy's bi
cycle-borne transoort capability."
The GULP
The general led us to a large
hanger. "There it is," he said.
"We call it GULP, the Gobble
Up Little Pismires."
We were looking at a fat heli
copter with big claws attached
to its belly. Droppit suggested
that we take GULP out for a
spin.
"The viewscreen here on the
dashboard," he said when we
were airborne, "is connected to
an infra-red scanner and a chem
ical sniffer. It is designed to
home in on the armpits of sweat
ing Communist bicycle opera
tors. Let's see if we can pick
up a target."
As we passed over the test
range, a blip appeared on the
screen. We looked down and saw
a figure in black pajamas pump
ing furiously along a dirt road.

"Tally-ho," shouted Droppit.
and we swooped down toward
the bicyclist. The man looked
up, leaped from his vehicle, and
cowered beneath a nearby bush.
As we passed over the scene,
our machine snatched up the
abandoned bike with its claws.
I heard a crunching sound as
GULP gobbled it up.
"There is a plant in the belly
of this little beauty which will
process the captured vehicle
into thumbtacks and evacuate
them back on to the road," Drop
pit said proudly.
"We figure that we can knock
out five gook bikes for every
one that we actually gobble. Of
course, we probably are being
a bit conservative, but 5:1 is the
factor that we plan to use in
figuring the bike-count."
We left Fort Void as fast as
we could, by car.
A few weeks later we called
General Droppit to ask how the
anti-bike campaign was coming
"Real swell, son," he told us
"We have already gobbled up
thousands of bikes in Nam.
We are running into one hitch,
though. Charlie has taken to
carrying loads of stuff on his
head. But don't worry. We are
working on a device right now

The GULP
The general led us to a large
hanger. "There it is," he said.
"We call it GULP, the Gobble
Up Little Pismires."
We were looking at a fat heli
copter with big claws attached
to its belly. Droppit suggested
that we take GULP out for a
spin.
"The viewscreen here on the
dashboard," he said when we
were airborne, "is connected to
an infra-red scanner and a chem
ical sniffer. It is designed to
home in on the armpits of sweat
ing Communist bicycle opera
tors. Let's see if we can pick
up a target."
As we passed over the test

screen. We looked down and saw
a figure in black pajamas pump

the bicyclist. The man looked
up, leaped from his vehicle, and

As we passed over the scene,

I heard a crunching sound as
GULP gobbled it up.
"There is a plant in the belly
of this little beauty which will
process the captured vehicle

them back on to the road," Drop

"We figure that we can knock
out five gook bikes for every

course, we probably are being
a bit conservative, but 5:1 is the
factor that we plan to use in

We left Fort Void as fast as
we could, by car.
A few weeks later we called
General Droppit to ask how the
anti-bike campaign was coming
"Real swell, son," he told us
"We have already gobbled up

hanger. "There it is," he said.
"We call it GULP, the Gobble
Up Little Pismires."
We were looking at a fat heli
copter with big claws attached
to its belly. Droppit suggested
that we take GULP out for a
spin.
"The viewscreen here on the
dashboard," he said when we
were airborne, "is connected to
an infra-red scanner and a chem
ical sniffer. It is designed to
home in on the armpits of sweat
ing Communist bicycle opera
tors. Let's see if we can pick
up a target."
As we passed over the test
range, a blip appeared on the
screen. We looked down and saw
a figure in black pajamas pump
ing furiously along a dirt road.

"Tally-ho," shouted Droppit.
and we swooped down toward
the bicyclist. The man looked
up, leaped from his vehicle, and
cowered beneath a nearby bush.
As we passed over the scene,
our machine snatched up the
abandoned bike with its claws.
I heard a crunching sound as
GULP gobbled it up.
"There is a plant in the belly
of this little beauty which will
process the captured vehicle
into thumbtacks and evacuate
them back on to the road," Drop
pit said proudly.
"We figure that we can knock
out five gook bikes for every
one that we actually gobble. Of
course, we probably are being
a bit conservative, but 5:1 is the
factor that we plan to use in
figuring the bike-count."
We left Fort Void as fast as
we could, by car.
A few weeks later we called
General Droppit to ask how the
anti-bike campaign was coming
"Real swell, son," he told us
"We have already gobbled up
thousands of bikes in Nam.
We are running into one hitch,
though. Charlie has taken to
carrying loads of stuff on his
head. But don't worry. We are
working on a device right now
