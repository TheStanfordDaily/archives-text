# Arson Suspected In Navy ROTC Blaze
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Stanford's Naval ROTC an
nex was badly damaged by a
deliberately set blaze early Mon
day morning.
Marine Col. Robert L. Thom
as, head of Stanford's NROTC,
said the fire "certainly has the
implications" of being the work
of someone strongly opposed to
the military.
The NROTC building: at Cal
was also victimized by arson
last Wednesday morning:, in
another pre-dawn raid.
According to Santa Clara
County Fire Marshal Bruce Wig
gins, a flammable liquid was
poured and ignited on half of
the porch along the east side of
the one-story wooden frame
building.
The Cal fire was started with
Molotqv cocktails.
Yesterday's fire was discover
ed at 1:26 a.m. by Tony Roma
les, Stanford police officer, who
immediately radioed the fire de
partment.
Romales had previously spot
checked the building at 12:45.
At that time all was in order.
Some students were in the an
nex until approximately 12:30.
The police department has
been checking 1 the building

every hour or two at night
since the Cal incident.
When the firemen arrived,
most of the east wall and roof
were in flames. The fire was
brought under control fairly
quickly, but hot spots were still
being sprayed at 10 a.m.
Fire Chief John Marston esti
mated the damage at $6,000, but
said that replacement cost would
be about $25,000.
Roy Masterson, NROTC pub
lic information officer, said the
structure would probably be
torn down within two weeks,
although parts of the building
were untouched by the flames.
Assistant Police Chief Thomas
Bell said he thought the inci
dent at Cal and the fire here
were related, but could not say
whether the sam person start*
both or the Cal blaze gave som
one the idea to start one here
Col. Thomas believes th«
fires were not aimed speciflcal
ly at the Navy, but rather a
the military. He noted tha
both the NROTC building hen
and the one at Cal are re mob
and Isolated, unlike othe
ROTC buildings at botl
schools.
Damage in the Cal blaze w;
estimated at $2,000.

The sections of the Stanford
building which suffered the most
damage were the porch, roof, at
tic ,and a large lounge in the
center of the annex.
Classrooms, offices for one Ma
rine and four Navy officers, a
library and kitchen were not
damaged in the blaze, although
the floors were soaked with
water.
None of the documents and
records kept in the building
were destroyed. Other items
were ruined, however, includ
ing trophies kept in the lounge
and parade rifles stored in the
attic, which "will have to be
refurbished," according to
Thomas.
Meanwhile, NROTC classes
were rescheduled for various

rooms around campus. Univer
sity officials are trying to find a
central location for offices and
classrooms.
Marston was pleased with the
way the fire was controlled and
most of the building saved. This
was done despite several difficul
ties.
The first problem was that
the nearest hydrant was a quar
ter of a mile from the annex,
and hoses had to be laid all the
way.
This took some time, but did
not delay the fire fighting since
the first truck on the scene car
ried a 500 gallon supply of water.
Part of this was used until the
hoses were hooked up.
