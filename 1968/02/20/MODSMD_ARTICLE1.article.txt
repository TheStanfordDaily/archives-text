# Arson Suspected In Navy ROTC Blaze
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Stanford's Naval ROTC an
nex was badly damaged by a
deliberately set blaze early Mon
day morning.
Marine Col. Robert L. Thom
as, head of Stanford's NROTC,
said the fire "certainly has the
implications" of being the work
of someone strongly opposed to
the military.
The NROTC building: at Cal
was also victimized by arson
last Wednesday morning:, in
another pre-dawn raid.
According to Santa Clara
County Fire Marshal Bruce Wig
gins, a flammable liquid was
poured and ignited on half of
the porch along the east side of
the one-story wooden frame
building.
The Cal fire was started with
Molotqv cocktails.
Yesterday's fire was discover
ed at 1:26 a.m. by Tony Roma
les, Stanford police officer, who
immediately radioed the fire de
partment.
Romales had previously spot
checked the building at 12:45.
At that time all was in order.
Some students were in the an
nex until approximately 12:30.
The police department has
been checking 1 the building

every hour or two at night
since the Cal incident.
When the firemen arrived,
most of the east wall and roof
were in flames. The fire was
brought under control fairly
quickly, but hot spots were still
being sprayed at 10 a.m.
Fire Chief John Marston esti
mated the damage at $6,000, but
said that replacement cost would
be about $25,000.
Roy Masterson, NROTC pub
lic information officer, said the
structure would probably be
torn down within two weeks,
although parts of the building
were untouched by the flames.
Assistant Police Chief Thomas
Bell said he thought the inci
dent at Cal and the fire here
were related, but could not say
whether the sam person start*
both or the Cal blaze gave som
one the idea to start one here
Col. Thomas believes th«
fires were not aimed speciflcal
ly at the Navy, but rather a
the military. He noted tha
both the NROTC building hen
and the one at Cal are re mob
and Isolated, unlike othe
ROTC buildings at botl
schools.
Damage in the Cal blaze w;
estimated at $2,000.

The sections of the Stanford
building which suffered the most
damage were the porch, roof, at
tic ,and a large lounge in the
center of the annex.
Classrooms, offices for one Ma
rine and four Navy officers, a
library and kitchen were not
damaged in the blaze, although
the floors were soaked with
water.
None of the documents and
records kept in the building
were destroyed. Other items
were ruined, however, includ
ing trophies kept in the lounge
and parade rifles stored in the
attic, which "will have to be
refurbished," according to
Thomas.
Meanwhile, NROTC classes
were rescheduled for various

rooms around campus. Univer
sity officials are trying to find a
central location for offices and
classrooms.
Marston was pleased with the
way the fire was controlled and
most of the building saved. This
was done despite several difficul
ties.
The first problem was that
the nearest hydrant was a quar
ter of a mile from the annex,
and hoses had to be laid all the
way.
This took some time, but did
not delay the fire fighting since
the first truck on the scene car
ried a 500 gallon supply of water.
Part of this was used until the
hoses were hooked up.

ply and that of the other
trucks came In handy later in
the morning 1 , when the main
hose sprung a leak and pres
sure dropped suddenly.
But by this time, the fire was
under control, with only occa
sional small flare-ups keeping
the firemen busy.
Investigations are being made
by the laboratory of the San
Jose district attorney's office to
determine the liquid used to set
off the blaze.
Bell reported Romales said
that when he approached the
building, the fire was burning
only along the north end of the
porch, but suddenly flared up in
the doorway.
This, Bell said, indicated
that a liquid was poured along

the entire north end of the
porch.
But he also felt that it was
not gasoliine, because it "would
have gone quicker."
The annex is about fifty years
old. Also known as Mahon Hall,
it was the original faculty club.
The investigation as to who
started the fire is being carried
out by the Santa Clara County
Fire Marshal's office and the
district attorney's office. Persons
in the building that night and
those who arrived shortly after
the fire was reported are being
questioned.
Last night, a false alarm oc
curred as an aftermath of the
fire. Some of the items taken
from the annex were stored next
to the rifle range, and the smoky
odor caused the range attendant
to call out the fire department.

to call out the fire department.
Stanford's Naval ROTC an
nex was badly damaged by a
deliberately set blaze early Mon
day morning.
Marine Col. Robert L. Thom
as, head of Stanford's NROTC,
said the fire "certainly has the
implications" of being the work
of someone strongly opposed to
the military.
The NROTC building: at Cal
was also victimized by arson
last Wednesday morning:, in
another pre-dawn raid.
According to Santa Clara
County Fire Marshal Bruce Wig
gins, a flammable liquid was
poured and ignited on half of
the porch along the east side of
the one-story wooden frame
building.
The Cal fire was started with
Molotqv cocktails.
Yesterday's fire was discover
ed at 1:26 a.m. by Tony Roma
les, Stanford police officer, who
immediately radioed the fire de
partment.
Romales had previously spot
checked the building at 12:45.
At that time all was in order.
Some students were in the an
nex until approximately 12:30.
The police department has
been checking 1 the building

every hour or two at night
since the Cal incident.
When the firemen arrived,
most of the east wall and roof
were in flames. The fire was
brought under control fairly
quickly, but hot spots were still
being sprayed at 10 a.m.
Fire Chief John Marston esti
mated the damage at $6,000, but
said that replacement cost would
be about $25,000.
Roy Masterson, NROTC pub
lic information officer, said the
structure would probably be
torn down within two weeks,
although parts of the building
were untouched by the flames.
Assistant Police Chief Thomas
Bell said he thought the inci
dent at Cal and the fire here
were related, but could not say
whether the sam person start*
both or the Cal blaze gave som
one the idea to start one here
Col. Thomas believes th«
fires were not aimed speciflcal
ly at the Navy, but rather a
the military. He noted tha
both the NROTC building hen
and the one at Cal are re mob
and Isolated, unlike othe
ROTC buildings at botl
schools.
Damage in the Cal blaze w;
estimated at $2,000.

The sections of the Stanford
building which suffered the most
damage were the porch, roof, at
tic ,and a large lounge in the
center of the annex.
Classrooms, offices for one Ma
rine and four Navy officers, a
library and kitchen were not
damaged in the blaze, although
the floors were soaked with
water.
None of the documents and
records kept in the building
were destroyed. Other items
were ruined, however, includ
ing trophies kept in the lounge
and parade rifles stored in the
attic, which "will have to be
refurbished," according to
Thomas.
Meanwhile, NROTC classes
were rescheduled for various

rooms around campus. Univer
sity officials are trying to find a
central location for offices and
classrooms.
Marston was pleased with the
way the fire was controlled and
most of the building saved. This
was done despite several difficul
ties.
The first problem was that
the nearest hydrant was a quar
ter of a mile from the annex,
and hoses had to be laid all the
way.
This took some time, but did
not delay the fire fighting since
the first truck on the scene car
ried a 500 gallon supply of water.
Part of this was used until the
hoses were hooked up.

trucks came In handy later in
the morning 1 , when the main
hose sprung a leak and pres
sure dropped suddenly.
But by this time, the fire was
under control, with only occa
sional small flare-ups keeping
the firemen busy.
Investigations are being made
by the laboratory of the San
Jose district attorney's office to
determine the liquid used to set
off the blaze.
Bell reported Romales said
that when he approached the
building, the fire was burning
only along the north end of the
porch, but suddenly flared up in
the doorway.
This, Bell said, indicated
that a liquid was poured along

the entire north end of the
porch.
But he also felt that it was
not gasoliine, because it "would
have gone quicker."
The annex is about fifty years
old. Also known as Mahon Hall,
it was the original faculty club.
The investigation as to who
started the fire is being carried
out by the Santa Clara County
Fire Marshal's office and the
district attorney's office. Persons
in the building that night and
those who arrived shortly after
the fire was reported are being
questioned.
Last night, a false alarm oc
curred as an aftermath of the
fire. Some of the items taken

to call out the fire department.
Stanford's Naval ROTC an
nex was badly damaged by a
deliberately set blaze early Mon
day morning.
Marine Col. Robert L. Thom
as, head of Stanford's NROTC,
said the fire "certainly has the
implications" of being the work
of someone strongly opposed to
the military.
The NROTC building: at Cal
was also victimized by arson
last Wednesday morning:, in
another pre-dawn raid.
According to Santa Clara
County Fire Marshal Bruce Wig
gins, a flammable liquid was
poured and ignited on half of
the porch along the east side of
the one-story wooden frame
building.
The Cal fire was started with
Molotqv cocktails.
Yesterday's fire was discover
ed at 1:26 a.m. by Tony Roma
les, Stanford police officer, who
immediately radioed the fire de
partment.
Romales had previously spot
checked the building at 12:45.
At that time all was in order.
Some students were in the an
nex until approximately 12:30.
The police department has
been checking 1 the building

every hour or two at night
since the Cal incident.
When the firemen arrived,
most of the east wall and roof
were in flames. The fire was
brought under control fairly
quickly, but hot spots were still
being sprayed at 10 a.m.
Fire Chief John Marston esti
mated the damage at $6,000, but
said that replacement cost would
be about $25,000.
Roy Masterson, NROTC pub
lic information officer, said the
structure would probably be
torn down within two weeks,
although parts of the building
were untouched by the flames.
Assistant Police Chief Thomas
Bell said he thought the inci
dent at Cal and the fire here
were related, but could not say
whether the sam person start*
both or the Cal blaze gave som
one the idea to start one here
Col. Thomas believes th«
fires were not aimed speciflcal
ly at the Navy, but rather a
the military. He noted tha
both the NROTC building hen
and the one at Cal are re mob
and Isolated, unlike othe
ROTC buildings at botl
schools.
Damage in the Cal blaze w;
estimated at $2,000.

The sections of the Stanford
building which suffered the most
damage were the porch, roof, at
tic ,and a large lounge in the
center of the annex.
Classrooms, offices for one Ma
rine and four Navy officers, a
library and kitchen were not
damaged in the blaze, although
the floors were soaked with
water.
None of the documents and
records kept in the building
were destroyed. Other items
were ruined, however, includ
ing trophies kept in the lounge
and parade rifles stored in the
attic, which "will have to be
refurbished," according to
Thomas.
Meanwhile, NROTC classes
were rescheduled for various

rooms around campus. Univer
sity officials are trying to find a
central location for offices and
classrooms.
Marston was pleased with the
way the fire was controlled and
most of the building saved. This
was done despite several difficul
ties.
The first problem was that
the nearest hydrant was a quar
ter of a mile from the annex,
and hoses had to be laid all the
way.
This took some time, but did
not delay the fire fighting since
the first truck on the scene car
ried a 500 gallon supply of water.
Part of this was used until the
hoses were hooked up.

ply and that of the other
trucks came In handy later in
the morning 1 , when the main
hose sprung a leak and pres
sure dropped suddenly.
But by this time, the fire was
under control, with only occa
sional small flare-ups keeping
the firemen busy.
Investigations are being made
by the laboratory of the San
Jose district attorney's office to
determine the liquid used to set
off the blaze.
Bell reported Romales said
that when he approached the
building, the fire was burning
only along the north end of the
porch, but suddenly flared up in
the doorway.
This, Bell said, indicated
that a liquid was poured along

the entire north end of the
porch.
But he also felt that it was
not gasoliine, because it "would
have gone quicker."
The annex is about fifty years
old. Also known as Mahon Hall,
it was the original faculty club.
The investigation as to who
started the fire is being carried
out by the Santa Clara County
Fire Marshal's office and the
district attorney's office. Persons
in the building that night and
those who arrived shortly after
the fire was reported are being
questioned.
Last night, a false alarm oc
curred as an aftermath of the
fire. Some of the items taken
from the annex were stored next
to the rifle range, and the smoky
odor caused the range attendant
to call out the fire department.
