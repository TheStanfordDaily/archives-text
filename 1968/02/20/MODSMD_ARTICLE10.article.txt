## 'The Students' Are Destroying ASSU 
### Tim Haight 
The current "issue" around
campus, the restructuring of the
ASSU, is utter nonsense.
It would be understandable if
the hot air was blowing from
the orifices of those worthies
who publish The Arena, but sad
to say the high pressure zone
extends to The Daily, and, yea,
even into the ASSU itself.
To put it simply, people are
blaming the structure of ASSU
for their own failures. The main
problem of ASSU is not its size
or bulkiness. The problem is not
even, the organization of LASSU.
Its problem is that it has not
become a focus for unified stu
dent action for reform, educa
tional or otherwise.
And the reason it has not be
come such a center is not its
structure. It is the failure of
sufficient students to unite be
hind any issue, or even for an
interested minority to do the
work needed to convince the Ad
ministration to change.
Where Size Is
The size of ASSU is mostly In
the various boards and commis
sions, who function relatively
autonomously from the ASSU
President's office or LASSU.
The only time the boards and
commissions contact the execu
tive or the legislature is when

they need some minor financial
adjustment, or when some spe
cial program comes up.
Moving for educational reform
has nothing to do with these
bureaucracies, except that mon
ey for educational research may
have to be allotted from a con
tingency fund that might other
wise go to them.
As for the organization of
LASSU, it is perhaps not totally
representative. As it turns out,
Row houses and fraternites are
overrepresented. So are the
houses in Flo Mo and Lag. These
living groups do not on the aver
age have the 75 people needed
to allocate an off-campus or
graduate representative.
High Potential
But the Legislature has the
widest potential for representa
tion, nonetheless. Every resident
student on campus should not
have to leave his dorm to feed
his input into LASSU. Off-cam
pus people are more Isolated,
but the liberal regulations for
seating new representatives has
helped this a little.
In fact, this flexibility In
LASSU has been the source of
most of the criticism. On occa
sion, graduate representatives
and off-campus reps have "flood
ed" LASSU with "radicals".

This has resulted in changes
in judicial proceedings, social
regulations, and much attention
to education. It also made the
more conservative students
squirm, because the "left"
would also try to pass resolu
tions supporting Berkeley
events, etc.
'Middle' Protest
But this is not the source of
the present discontent, except
that now the former squirming
conservatives have become the
dynamic "aroused middle" of
The Arena. The thing that
makes us want to blame the
structure is that Harris and Ly
man promised us all those
things and then quit, leaving us
turned on but unsatisfied.
What hogwash! In the usual,
alienated, passive way you peo
ple thought that all there was
to making significant changes in
education was voting for Har
ris or Lyman, much in the same
way many demonstrators
thought that a single demonstra
tion might make Johnson "re

pent." You voted for the reform
candidate and then went back
to your cozy private world.
And Harris found out (I know,
I was his administrative assist
ant) that the administration has
many committees to sponge up
reform and spit out petty propo
sals.
And Harris found out that
without a committed student
body behind his proposals the
administration wouldn't feel im
pelled to make all that change.
And when Harris started look
ing for that support, he couldn't
even get enough people to do
research on proposals, let alone
enough to be of significant num
ber to mean need for change.
With Lyman, it was the same
way. People graduated after the
campaign, and new people did
not fill their places. True, he was
isolated and hard to reach, but
even so interested students could
have moved in and done their
thing. But they didn't.
So now we can sit back and
say the ASSU is the "play-

ground of political radicals who
can't even find a president who'll
serve out his entire term . .
Bully.
The truth is these "radicals"
thought that you were listening
to what they said in the cam
paigns and that you would
realize the magnitude of the
problem, given a liberal, but
frighteningly bureaucratic ad
ministration.
But you didn't. And now, to
avoid the blame, and since you
don't care about anything but
having girls in the frat while
keeping rush anyway, you turn
on the ASSU structure for
pseudo-political kicks.
Grow up. The political radicals
don't need this playground. They
came into ASSU because they
thought you dug what they were
saying.
But it turned out the elections
were more TV-ratings than com
mitment. Too bad. Now you get
what you deserve.

tive or the legislature is when

they need some minor financial
adjustment, or when some spe
cial program comes up.
Moving for educational reform
has nothing to do with these
bureaucracies, except that mon
ey for educational research may
have to be allotted from a con
tingency fund that might other
wise go to them.
As for the organization of
LASSU, it is perhaps not totally
representative. As it turns out,
Row houses and fraternites are
overrepresented. So are the
houses in Flo Mo and Lag. These
living groups do not on the aver
age have the 75 people needed
to allocate an off-campus or
graduate representative.
High Potential
But the Legislature has the
widest potential for representa
tion, nonetheless. Every resident
student on campus should not
have to leave his dorm to feed
his input into LASSU. Off-cam
pus people are more Isolated,
but the liberal regulations for
seating new representatives has
helped this a little.
In fact, this flexibility In
LASSU has been the source of
most of the criticism. On occa
sion, graduate representatives
and off-campus reps have "flood
ed" LASSU with "radicals".

This has resulted in changes
in judicial proceedings, social
regulations, and much attention
to education. It also made the
more conservative students
squirm, because the "left"
would also try to pass resolu
tions supporting Berkeley
events, etc.
'Middle' Protest
But this is not the source of
the present discontent, except
that now the former squirming
conservatives have become the
dynamic "aroused middle" of
The Arena. The thing that
makes us want to blame the
structure is that Harris and Ly
man promised us all those
things and then quit, leaving us
turned on but unsatisfied.
What hogwash! In the usual,
alienated, passive way you peo
ple thought that all there was
to making significant changes in
education was voting for Har
ris or Lyman, much in the same
way many demonstrators
thought that a single demonstra
tion might make Johnson "re

pent." You voted for the reform
candidate and then went back
to your cozy private world.
And Harris found out (I know,
I was his administrative assist
ant) that the administration has
many committees to sponge up
reform and spit out petty propo
sals.
And Harris found out that
without a committed student
body behind his proposals the
administration wouldn't feel im
pelled to make all that change.
And when Harris started look
ing for that support, he couldn't
even get enough people to do
research on proposals, let alone
enough to be of significant num
ber to mean need for change.
With Lyman, it was the same
way. People graduated after the
campaign, and new people did
not fill their places. True, he was
isolated and hard to reach, but
even so interested students could
have moved in and done their
thing. But they didn't.
So now we can sit back and
say the ASSU is the "play-

ground of political radicals who
can't even find a president who'll
serve out his entire term . .
Bully.
The truth is these "radicals"
thought that you were listening
to what they said in the cam
paigns and that you would
realize the magnitude of the
problem, given a liberal, but
frighteningly bureaucratic ad
ministration.
But you didn't. And now, to
avoid the blame, and since you
don't care about anything but
having girls in the frat while
keeping rush anyway, you turn
on the ASSU structure for
pseudo-political kicks.
Grow up. The political radicals
don't need this playground. They
came into ASSU because they
thought you dug what they were
saying.
But it turned out the elections
were more TV-ratings than com
mitment. Too bad. Now you get
what you deserve.
The current "issue" around
campus, the restructuring of the
ASSU, is utter nonsense.
It would be understandable if
the hot air was blowing from
the orifices of those worthies
who publish The Arena, but sad
to say the high pressure zone
extends to The Daily, and, yea,
even into the ASSU itself.
To put it simply, people are
blaming the structure of ASSU
for their own failures. The main
problem of ASSU is not its size
or bulkiness. The problem is not
even, the organization of LASSU.
Its problem is that it has not
become a focus for unified stu
dent action for reform, educa
tional or otherwise.
And the reason it has not be
come such a center is not its
structure. It is the failure of
sufficient students to unite be
hind any issue, or even for an
interested minority to do the
work needed to convince the Ad
ministration to change.
Where Size Is
The size of ASSU is mostly In
the various boards and commis
sions, who function relatively
autonomously from the ASSU
President's office or LASSU.
The only time the boards and
commissions contact the execu
tive or the legislature is when

they need some minor financial
adjustment, or when some spe
cial program comes up.

regulations, and much attention
to education. It also made the
more conservative students
squirm, because the "left"
would also try to pass resolu
tions supporting Berkeley
events, etc.
'Middle' Protest
But this is not the source of
the present discontent, except
that now the former squirming
conservatives have become the
dynamic "aroused middle" of
The Arena. The thing that
makes us want to blame the
structure is that Harris and Ly
man promised us all those
things and then quit, leaving us
turned on but unsatisfied.
What hogwash! In the usual,
alienated, passive way you peo
ple thought that all there was
to making significant changes in
education was voting for Har
ris or Lyman, much in the same
way many demonstrators
thought that a single demonstra
tion might make Johnson "re

pent." You voted for the reform
candidate and then went back
to your cozy private world.
And Harris found out (I know,
I was his administrative assist
ant) that the administration has
many committees to sponge up
reform and spit out petty propo
sals.
And Harris found out that
without a committed student
body behind his proposals the
administration wouldn't feel im
pelled to make all that change.
And when Harris started look
ing for that support, he couldn't
even get enough people to do
research on proposals, let alone
enough to be of significant num
ber to mean need for change.
With Lyman, it was the same
way. People graduated after the
campaign, and new people did
not fill their places. True, he was
isolated and hard to reach, but
even so interested students could
have moved in and done their
thing. But they didn't.
So now we can sit back and
say the ASSU is the "play-

ground of political radicals who
can't even find a president who'll
serve out his entire term . .
Bully.
The truth is these "radicals"
thought that you were listening
to what they said in the cam
paigns and that you would
realize the magnitude of the
problem, given a liberal, but
frighteningly bureaucratic ad
ministration.
But you didn't. And now, to
avoid the blame, and since you
don't care about anything but
having girls in the frat while
keeping rush anyway, you turn
on the ASSU structure for
pseudo-political kicks.
Grow up. The political radicals
don't need this playground. They
came into ASSU because they
thought you dug what they were
saying.
But it turned out the elections
were more TV-ratings than com
mitment. Too bad. Now you get
what you deserve.
The current "issue" around
campus, the restructuring of the
ASSU, is utter nonsense.
It would be understandable if
the hot air was blowing from
the orifices of those worthies
who publish The Arena, but sad
to say the high pressure zone
extends to The Daily, and, yea,
even into the ASSU itself.
To put it simply, people are
blaming the structure of ASSU
for their own failures. The main
problem of ASSU is not its size
or bulkiness. The problem is not
even, the organization of LASSU.
Its problem is that it has not
become a focus for unified stu
dent action for reform, educa
tional or otherwise.
And the reason it has not be
come such a center is not its
structure. It is the failure of
sufficient students to unite be
hind any issue, or even for an
interested minority to do the
work needed to convince the Ad
ministration to change.
Where Size Is
The size of ASSU is mostly In
the various boards and commis
sions, who function relatively
autonomously from the ASSU
President's office or LASSU.
The only time the boards and
commissions contact the execu
tive or the legislature is when

they need some minor financial
adjustment, or when some spe
cial program comes up.
Moving for educational reform
has nothing to do with these
bureaucracies, except that mon
ey for educational research may
have to be allotted from a con
tingency fund that might other
wise go to them.
As for the organization of
LASSU, it is perhaps not totally
representative. As it turns out,
Row houses and fraternites are
overrepresented. So are the
houses in Flo Mo and Lag. These
living groups do not on the aver
age have the 75 people needed
to allocate an off-campus or
graduate representative.
High Potential
But the Legislature has the
widest potential for representa
tion, nonetheless. Every resident
student on campus should not
have to leave his dorm to feed
his input into LASSU. Off-cam
pus people are more Isolated,
but the liberal regulations for
seating new representatives has
helped this a little.
In fact, this flexibility In
LASSU has been the source of
most of the criticism. On occa
sion, graduate representatives
and off-campus reps have "flood
ed" LASSU with "radicals".

This has resulted in changes
in judicial proceedings, social
regulations, and much attention
to education. It also made the
