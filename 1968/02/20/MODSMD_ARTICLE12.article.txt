## Ram's Head Replaces SRT? 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
A flickering orb slowly as
cends -the murky skies and
bursts fiery at its apogee, fill
ing forth with dazzling radiance
the heavens all 'round, out to
the furthest cosmic bounds ...
and beyond. The celestial host
dims in awe of this blaze, newest
and brightest of all. A light is
born, and hereafter may all the
world know that horizons be
fore yet imagined now lay un
clouded and charted before the
glory of Ram's Head.
The spectacle, preoccasioned
by little of note in past efforts

by Ram's Head, "Roar of the
Grease Paint, Smell of the
Crowd" was the best entertain
ment to pass by way of Stan
ford in a long time. A critic, I
must think, would be heartily
caned by an irate audience
should he have the slightest as
persion in the face of so magni
ficent a production.
SRT Dies
Now that SRT has finally suc
cumbed to its death wish in re
leasing Richards and Hiken from
the Company ,the old, acadcmic
pros sit patiently back contem
plating that day, one or perhaps

two years off, when the final
logistics of the program to phase
out professional theater at Stan
ford will have been carried out.
On that day the eulogies will
be officially short, and the good
old days of yore — when the
roar of the crowd and the smell
of the greasepaint filled Mem
Aud — will be bedded casually
in a dust crusted casket and
lowered into the grave which
so long will have lagnuished
agape.
I suppose a few old friends,
including myself, will be on hand
to witness the solemnities. As
black veils flutter in the misty
dusk breeze and as men clasp
together the collars of their
mourning coats, a tear or two
may sodden the earth of the
well-packed mound that marks
the otherwise unheralded grave.
"Here today and gone tomor
row,/ There are no pockets in
a shroud." It appears as if SRT,
heeding the wisdom of this re
frain, had engaged in more than
token philanthropy by bestow
ing some of its thespian virtu
osity (Carrillo Gantner, Glenn
Cannon, and Director Stephen
Book) on the undergraduate
drama sector.
The result, as witnessed in
"Roar of the Greasepaint," was
a union of grad and undergrad
that defied the bad taste and
stogginess of the former and
the inexperience and bad taste
of the latter. One saw in this
union a benefit mutual to both
parties — superb theater.
The Roar' That Was
Anyone who enjoys the the
ater — in fact, anyone who has
ever laughed or tapped his foot
to music or anyone who has
ever done any of the perversi
ties to which human beings have
been attributed — and who miss
ed "Roar of the Greasepaint",
should kick his wretched, tur
pritudinous self in the shin three
times daily for the rest of the
quarter.
At the buck-fifty saved on the
price of admission, one would
marvel at the expense of so sore
a shin.
Of course, should prevailing
trends in Rams Head warrant
another such venture — combin
ing the bounty of witicism, song
and dance, and so exhilerant a
directional style and acting tal
ent as displayed last week — en
lightenment may yet await all
of you skinless shinned sloths.
