# Chicago Showdown
## 
### Max Lerner 
On a few days' to Chicago
visit I have been thinking about
next summer here, when the
Democrats meet in convention
the last week of August. What
ever the weather is like, the
social and emotional climate
will be hot.
Every crackpot group, protest
group, every disruptive, violent
force in American society that
thinks it has a pipeline to abso
lute truth will be converging on
the Chicago convention. Think
of the target it offers: a Presi
dent seeking vindication before
the delegates and the nation.
Think of the chance it offers
to those who want to get total
exposure for their position and
perhaps grab some free pub
licity.
Zany Side
There is, of course, a zany side
to the prospect. There is a le
galize-pot-and-make-love organi
zation that promises to bring
half a million followers to Chi
cago, and there is Timothy
Leary, LSD religious cultist,
who says he will lead a mass of
hippies to the convention for a
love-in.
There are black power fana
tics who talk of bringing another
million to Chicago for what is
bound to be a hate-in. There is
Dick Gregory, who has a chance
as a comedian to stage a laugh
in but talks darkly of the con
vention taking place "only over
my dead body."
No one knows what the real
ity is behind the paper threats,
promises and predictions by New

Left and black power forces.
There is some talk that Chicago
was spared a violent riot last
summer exactly because some of
the potential organizers figured
on concentrating on the fire next
time, in the coming summer.
As in all rumor-filled cities,
there is talk about weapons be
ing bought and stored away by
tense whites as well as blacks.
Psychological Aspect
This is the psychology of a
city preparing for a possible
siege. Mayor Daley is playing
things cool. He makes the sen
sible distinction between allow
ing demonstrations and dissent
but drawing the line at violence
and plans for it.
He sounds confident that he
will be able to keep both the con
vention and city under control
on those fateful five days in
August.
As everyone knows, Daley has
lines to the Negro power struc
ture in Chicago, which has thus
far not only refused any ties
with the Stokely Carmichael
forces a^so cu *
ground uu,.f whatever popular
Negro support Martin Luther
King thought he could develop.
The Negro power structure,
which doesn't get played up
much, has deep stakes in a "nor
mal" Chicago, just as the Daley
power structure has. That is
how a pro plays the game in a
time of racial tension, and
Daley is very much a pro.
Alternate Plan
An example of Daley's cool is
his strong rejection of a bizarre

plan by Joe Woods, sheriff of
Cook County, for recruiting a
riot posse of a thousand volun
teers (half of them Negro) who
would form a "quasi-military or
ganization" and would be equip
ped with their own or donated
guns ("We prefer a four-inch
barrel," says Woods).
Every schoolboy knows that
this kind of frontier vigilantism
could be exactly the spark that
would set off a racial conflaga
ration if nothing else did. The
more serious question is how
well Daley and his allies in the
Negro community have gauged
the temper of the people in the
inner city.
But the police will be ready,
and either the National Glard or
Army units (or both, as with
the march on the Pentagon) will
be available to reinforce them.
One aspect isn't discussed
much — the impact of all this
on Lyndon Johnson's own pros
pects. If there is any real op
position to him inside the Dem
ocratic Party in August, the New
Left and black power demon
strations will dissipate it.
Every major demonstration
thus far has had a boomerang
effect. As for his election pros
pects, real racial violence di
rected against him in Chicago
by small groups would be likely
to shore up his election, by
strengthening him in the South
em states and giving him the
hard line support of the lower
middle class — whites and even
Negroes — everywhere else.

Left and black power forces.
There is some talk that Chicago
was spared a violent riot last
summer exactly because some of
the potential organizers figured
on concentrating on the fire next
time, in the coming summer.
As in all rumor-filled cities,
there is talk about weapons be
ing bought and stored away by
tense whites as well as blacks.
Psychological Aspect
This is the psychology of a
city preparing for a possible
siege. Mayor Daley is playing
things cool. He makes the sen
sible distinction between allow
ing demonstrations and dissent
but drawing the line at violence
and plans for it.
He sounds confident that he
will be able to keep both the con
vention and city under control
on those fateful five days in
August.
As everyone knows, Daley has
lines to the Negro power struc
ture in Chicago, which has thus
far not only refused any ties
with the Stokely Carmichael
forces a^so cu *
ground uu,.f whatever popular
Negro support Martin Luther
King thought he could develop.
The Negro power structure,
which doesn't get played up
much, has deep stakes in a "nor
mal" Chicago, just as the Daley
power structure has. That is
how a pro plays the game in a
time of racial tension, and
Daley is very much a pro.
Alternate Plan
An example of Daley's cool is
his strong rejection of a bizarre

plan by Joe Woods, sheriff of
Cook County, for recruiting a
riot posse of a thousand volun
teers (half of them Negro) who
would form a "quasi-military or
ganization" and would be equip
ped with their own or donated
guns ("We prefer a four-inch
barrel," says Woods).
Every schoolboy knows that
this kind of frontier vigilantism
could be exactly the spark that
would set off a racial conflaga
ration if nothing else did. The
more serious question is how
well Daley and his allies in the
Negro community have gauged
the temper of the people in the
inner city.
But the police will be ready,
and either the National Glard or
Army units (or both, as with
the march on the Pentagon) will
be available to reinforce them.
One aspect isn't discussed
much — the impact of all this
on Lyndon Johnson's own pros
pects. If there is any real op
position to him inside the Dem
ocratic Party in August, the New
Left and black power demon
strations will dissipate it.
Every major demonstration
thus far has had a boomerang
effect. As for his election pros
pects, real racial violence di
rected against him in Chicago
by small groups would be likely
to shore up his election, by
strengthening him in the South
em states and giving him the
hard line support of the lower
middle class — whites and even
Negroes — everywhere else.

On a few days' to Chicago
visit I have been thinking about
next summer here, when the
Democrats meet in convention
the last week of August. What
ever the weather is like, the
social and emotional climate
will be hot.
Every crackpot group, protest
group, every disruptive, violent
force in American society that
thinks it has a pipeline to abso
lute truth will be converging on
the Chicago convention. Think
of the target it offers: a Presi
dent seeking vindication before
the delegates and the nation.
Think of the chance it offers
to those who want to get total
exposure for their position and
perhaps grab some free pub
licity.
Zany Side
There is, of course, a zany side
to the prospect. There is a le
galize-pot-and-make-love organi
zation that promises to bring
half a million followers to Chi
cago, and there is Timothy
Leary, LSD religious cultist,
who says he will lead a mass of
hippies to the convention for a
love-in.
There are black power fana
tics who talk of bringing another
million to Chicago for what is
bound to be a hate-in. There is
Dick Gregory, who has a chance
as a comedian to stage a laugh
in but talks darkly of the con
vention taking place "only over
my dead body."

riot posse of a thousand volun
teers (half of them Negro) who
would form a "quasi-military or
ganization" and would be equip
ped with their own or donated
guns ("We prefer a four-inch
barrel," says Woods).
Every schoolboy knows that
this kind of frontier vigilantism
could be exactly the spark that
would set off a racial conflaga
ration if nothing else did. The
more serious question is how
well Daley and his allies in the
Negro community have gauged
the temper of the people in the
inner city.
But the police will be ready,
and either the National Glard or
Army units (or both, as with
the march on the Pentagon) will
be available to reinforce them.
One aspect isn't discussed
much — the impact of all this
on Lyndon Johnson's own pros
pects. If there is any real op
position to him inside the Dem
ocratic Party in August, the New
Left and black power demon
strations will dissipate it.
Every major demonstration
thus far has had a boomerang
effect. As for his election pros
pects, real racial violence di
rected against him in Chicago
by small groups would be likely
to shore up his election, by
strengthening him in the South
em states and giving him the
hard line support of the lower
middle class — whites and even
Negroes — everywhere else.
