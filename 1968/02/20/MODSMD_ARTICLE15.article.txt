# War, Riot Referendum Also
## Collegiate Presidential Primary Set 
### 
College students will vote
April 24 on 14 Presidential can
didates and three referenda
questions on the Vietnam war
and the urban crisis.
The 11 student leaders who
make up the board of directors
of Choice '68, the national col
legiate presidential primary
funded by Time magazine, have
announced the candidates and
issues to appear on the April 24
ballot.
Choice '68 will hold its first
organizational meeting at Stan
ford Wednesday, February 21, at
7:00 p.m. in room 267-268 of
Tresidder Memorial Union. Staff
workers to man the campaign,
polling, publicity, and speakers
bureau committees are needed,
and any interested students are
urged to attend the meeting.
Representatives of the various
candidate groups on campus
should also attend.
Some 1000 colleges and uni
versities in every state have thus
far agreed to participate, indi
cating a possible voter turnout
of over five million students, or
about 75 per cent of the total
student electorate. Meeting in
Washington February 10
through 13, student leaders from
across the nation decided on the
format of the ballot. Not only
the self-declared candidates for

President will be listed, but also
many other men whom the
Board felt would give a broad
choice of ideology and style to
the student electorate.
Each of the active candidate
groups on campus, such as Stu
dents for McCarthy, Students
for Romney, etc., will be urged
to campaign vigorously for their
candidates between now and
election time. Rallys, speeches,
and demonstrations will take
place to support the various
Presidential nominees.
After the election, the Stan
ford vote will be tabulated here
as well as for the national vote
count, which, in the opinion of
the New York Times' James
Reston, can be "potentially a
very powerful political force in
this country." Reston continued,
by saying that students' "intelli
gence and energy could be criti
cal, and in many places decisive,
if they really got down to the
hard work of helping the best
candidates available. It all de
pends, however, on whether they
want to dream or work."
Listed on the ballot for Presi
dent will be Democrats Lyndon
Johnson, Robert Kennedy, and
Eugene McCarthy, Republicans
Richard Nixon, George Romney,
Nelson Rockefeller, Ronald Rea
gan, Mark Hatfield, John Lind
say, Charles Percy, and Harold

Stassen, plus former Alabama
Gov. George Wallace (American
Independent Party), Dr. Martin
Luther King, and Fred Halstead
of the Socialist Workers Party.
The candidates will all be list
ed together in alphabetical or
der. Students will pick their
first, second, and third choices.
The first choices will be used to
determine the winner, while the
second and third choices will be
used for analysis. Write-ins will
be permitted.
Also on the ballot are two
questions on Vietnam and one
on urban problems. They are:
"What course of military ac
tion should the United States
pursue in Vietnam: immediate
withdrawal of American forces,
phased reduction of American
military activity, maintain cur
rent level of American military
activity, increase the level of
American military activity, all
out American military effort."
"What course of action should
the United States pursue in re
gard to the bombing of North
Vietnam: permanent cessation
of bombing, temporary suspen
sion of bombing, maintain cur
rent level of bombing, intensify
bombing, use of nuclear, weap
ons."
"In confronting the 'urban
crisis' which of the following
should receive highest priority

in governmental spending: edu
cation, job training and employ
ment opportunities, housing, in
come subsidy, riot control and
stricter law enforcement."
Sophomore Neil Golden has
been named Campus Coordina
tor of Choice '68, the Presiden
tial primary election to be held
at Stanford in April, Tim Vidal
of the Political Union announced
Thursday. Golden commented,
"We are quite excited about the
possibilities presented in this
election to express student opin
ion not only for the campus but
for the nation as a whole."
Choice '68 is the idea of Bob
Harris, a former Michigan State
University student body presi
dent. It occurred to him last
summer that, instead of a hap
hazard group of local primaries,
college students ought to vote
at the same time in one national
primary.
He then started going to vari
ous companies to see if he could

get money to finance the pro
gram. The first place he went
was Time magazine mainly "be
cause I could get In to see the
publisher."
After that trip, Time decided
it could be done and gave Har
ris $100,000 for the project "as
a public service." He picked 11
student leaders to make policy
and determine the ballot.
But being funded by Time is a
problem for. Choice '68. Time's
editorial treatment of students,
education, and Vietnam has not
exactly made it credible to many
college students and some of
that lack of credibility may rub
off on Choice '68.
The student body presidents
and college editors who make
up the board were skeptical of
Time when they first met last
October, but they say that they
have been given complete free
dom to determine which candi
dates and issues go on the bal
lot, as well as other policies.
