# Rusk: Bomb Halt 'Almost Obscene'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (CPS) â€” Sec
retary of State Dean Rusk told a
group of college editors a week
ago that stopping the bomb
ing of North Vietnam as a step
toward peace negotiations is "al
most an obscene proposal."
But Rusk went back and edit
ed the remark out of the ap
proved text of the Feb. 2 inter
view with three college editors
and the College Press Service.
Three of the four writers
stuck to their agreement to use
only comments in the prepared
text, but the fourth, Dan Ok
rent of the Michigan Daily, re
leased the statement in an edi

torial page column about the
interview.
Walter Grant of CPS wrote a
letter to Rusk on behalf of the
four editors, objecting to the
deletion.
In releasing the censored re
mark, Okrent questioned in an
editorial page column whether
Rusk's statement would affect
the nation security. "I suppose
. . . it isn't stretching the imagi
nation too far to concede that
if the Secretary of State of our
country actually thinks a sug
gestion to stop the bombing is
'obscene,' then this in itself ex
poses a dire threat to effective
State Department operations
and, thus, to national security,"
he said.
