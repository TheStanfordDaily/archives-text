# Was Economic Council Head
## Former Presidential Adviser Here 
### SUE CRIBARI 
Teaching and research will be
the main activities of noted
economist Arthur F. Burns, who
has accepted a position as visit
inf professor here through June.
"I thrive best when I do some
of each," the former Chairman
-of President Eisenhower's Coun
cil of Economic Advisres said.
Professor Burns, who was
granted leave from Columbia
University where he holds the
John Bates Clark professorship
in economics, arrived at Stan
ford two weeks ago. This quar
ter, he will participate in stu
dent seminars "in an informal
way," but Spring quarter, he
plans to teach a seminar of his
own on economic policy.
His research work will center
around "business cycles," a topic
which he has explored from
many different angles "for more
years than I like to remember."
Burns serves as Chairman of
the Board of the National Bu
reau of Economic Research Ir
the leading private economic re
search institute.
"I've always taught in the
East, and I was attracted by the
opportunity of visiting an out
standing western university," he
said. "This was my main reason
for coming to Stanford."
His stay in California will also
enable him to see one of his
sons, Joseph Burns, who is an
assistant professor of economics
at UCLA, more frequently.
Discussing his work on the
Council of Economic Advisers,
he said that the amount of in
fluence any economic council
will have "depends a great deal
on who is President." Burns esti
mated that of the last four
Pr idents, Truman paid least
aft> ntion to the council, that
Ei. 1 nhower and Kennedy "lean
ed very heavily" on it, and that
President Johnson also "leaned
heavily" on the council, but "not
as much as his two prede
cessors."
In determining policy, how
ever "No President has ever
boon guided exclusively, nor
should he be, by the thinking
of economists around him," he
said.
Another consideration, for ex
ample, would "very clearly" be
politics. The President "is not
only head of state, but also head
of a political party."
Before serving on the Coun
cil of Economic Advisers, Burns
acted as consultant to the U.S.

Treasury, the Security Council,
the State, Defense and Labor
Departments, and the Federal
Reserve Board. He is now pres
ident of the Academy of Politi
cal Science, and a member of
the Council on Foreign Rela
tions.
Throughout his varied career,
he feels his basic economic views
have not changed. "But on
specific details, yes, my views
have changed, because the world
doesn't stand still."
Though comparisons are dif
ficult in the short time he has
been at Stanford, Professor
Burns commented, "I believe
Stanford is more strongly
oriented toward mathematical
approaches to economics than is
Columbia. This, he emphasized,
is an idea he had formed be
fore arriving at Stanford, and re
has not yet had the opportunity
to verify it.
When asked how his views
differ from those of other mem
bers of the departments, he re
plied, "I'm not really sure of
the answer to your question.
However, I believe that I'm
more conservatively inclined in
my economic and political views
than are most members of the
Stanford economics depart
ment."
He expressed some of these
views on national economic
problems.
He favors the removal of the
gold backing of the dollar do
mestically because "if we don't

remove the present requirement
for holding gold as a reserve
against our currency, it will
soon become impossible for our
nation's money supply to con
tinue to grow. Some increase in
the money supply is essential
to the continuance of economic
expansion in our country and
elsewhere."
He discussed devaluation of
the dollar in two different re
spectsâ€”against other currencies
and against gold.
"Devaluation of the dollar
against other currencies would
lead to retaliatory measures by
other nations. If we followed
such a course, I would expect
world trade to shrink, and I
would also expect political
troubles."
"On the other hand," he con
tinued, "devaluation of the dol
lar against gold would be likely
to leave the existing system of
foreign exchange rates intact.
Since the dollar value of our
gold reserves in the latter case
would be larger, our country
would have more elbow room
for an independent domestic
economic policy.
"However, a prudent fiscal
and monetary policy would still
be essential. If we devalued the
dollar against gold, and contin
ued to pursue a highly expan
sionist economic policy such as
we have had since 1914, specu
lation against the dollar would
be likely to set in once again,
and serious financial and eco
nomic trouble would follow," he
said.
Burns feels "balance of pay
ments," which is foreign spend
ing on U.S. products versus U.S.
spending on foreign products, is
a serious American problem.
"Our balance of payments has
deteriorated very seriously dur
ing the past year," he said,
"partly because of the war in
Vietnam; partly because of the
sluggishness of the European
economy; partly because of the
rapid increase in our domestic
price level; partly also because
of the diminished confidence in
the dollar that has been released
by all these forces. Needless to
say, the devaluation of the (En
glish) pound has also served
to stimulate hoarding of gold
and speculation against the dol
lar."
He offered some concrete sug
gestions for improving the bal
ance of payments situation.
"By far, the most important

single thing that we can do to
improve our balance of pay
ments is to bring the present
inflation to a halt. This can only
be accomplished by restricting
the rate of growth of the money
supply and by reducing the fed
eral budget deficit," he said.
Foreign aid cuts would also
help, "though only to a minor
degree." "Beyond that," he add
ed, "I think that much of our
foreign aid has been wasteful.
This is particularly true of our
widespread military assistance
programs."
In discussing the necessity
for a surtax he remarked, "A
tax increase is desirable in my
judgment. However, such an in
crease should, in the first place,
be accompaned by a substan

tial cutback in projected federal
expenditure."
"In the second place, the tax
increase should be limited to one
year," he said. "Ours is already
a heavily taxed nation and we
must be very careful not to in
crease taxes to a point where
economic incentives to enter
prise and innovation will be sig
nificantly impaired."
Burns does not see the"cost"
of the Vietnam war only in eco
nomic terms. "The Vietnamese
war has become a great divisive
influence in our national life,"
he said. "There is less unity in
our nation today than at any
time since the Civil War. To
my mind, this is by far the lar
gest part of the cost of the un
happy Vietnam war."
