# Budget Worries Just Beginning
## Research Profs, Projects In Trouble 
### WALTER GRANT College Press Service 
WASHINGTON — Troubles
may be just beginning for uni
versity graduate students and
professors who depend on the
Defense Department and the
space agency for fellowships and
funding of research projects.
The Federal Government's
budget problems have forced
both the Pentagon and the Na
tional Aeronautics and Space
Administration to reduce sup
port to universities during the
current fiscal year. And the out
look for Fiscal 1969 is not much
brighter.
Although some universities
are already feeling the pinch,
most will not feel the full im
pact of the decrease in finan
cial support until April or May,
accor ling to an official in the
Pentagon's office of research and
engineering.
The budget cuts are having a
wide variety of effects on univer
sities. Some graduate schools

may be forced to accept fewer
students next fall due to the
lack of fellowships and research
opportunities. Faculty hiring at
some graduate schools is at a
standstill, and many more
schools will be unable to sup
port faculty and student re
search projects this summer.
Private schools with little or
no endowments will be hurt
more than some large state uni
versities, like the Universities of
Michigan and California, which
are heavily endowed. Some of
the major private universities
like Stanford and Harvard also
have large endowments which
will help offset the loss of fed
eral support.
Overall, University-based re
search in the Defense Depart
ment has been reduced to $238
million for 1968, compared to
$261 million in Fiscal 1967 and
$299 in 1966. Of the $23 million
reduction this year, about $20
million will come from the area
of basic research, defined by the

Pentagon as projects "seeking
to develop new knowledge." The
smaller amount — about $3
million — will come from ap
plied research, which includes
most of the classified research
projects in universities sponsor
ed by the Defense Department.
In the space agency, the spend
ing reductions will have more
effect on graduate fellowships
than on research. NASA gave
750 predoctoral three-year fel
lowships in 1967, but will be
able to give only 75 this year.
The overall NASA program of
support to universities has been
cut from about $117 million in
1967 to less than $100 million
this year, a space agency offi
cial said. NASA's sustaining uni
versity program was cut from
$30 million to $10 million.
The budget cuts have been
caused primarily by the Vietnam
war, which is eating up a large
portion of the federal budget.
Since the war is expected to con
tinue at least at the present

level during Fiscal 1969, and pos
sibly at an escalated level, uni
versities are not expecting any
relief when the new fiscal year
begins this coming July.
If Congress accepts the John
son Administration's budget rec
ommendation for NASA, the
amount of university support in
1969 will be comparable to the
reduced level of this year. NASA
would again be able to offer only
about 75 predoctoral fellow
ships, and the sustaining univer
sity program would receive only
$10 million.
Pentagon officials say they
cannot give specific figures about
how the proposed 1969 budget
will affect university-based re
search. However, the Admini
stration is requesting an in
crease of about $90 million for
the entire research program in
the Defense Department. One
Pntagon official predicted about
one-third of this amount, of $30
million, would go to universities.
In this case, university-based
research for the Pentagon would
be increased to about the 1967
level. But costs have been go
ing up, and a dollar in 1969 will
not go as far as a dollar in 1967.
Thus, even if universities receive
a $30 million increase, the over
all program level still will be
down.
Congress, however, is in a fis
cally conservative mood, and
most observers expect signi
ficant reductions in the Admini
stration's budget requests. Re
search funds frequently are cut
by Congress, because many Con

gressmen think some research
projects are duplicated and are
irrelevant.
Arwin A. Dougal, assistant di
rector of the Pentagon's office
for research and engineering,
said the Defense Department
surveyed universities to deter
mine what effect the budget cuts
would have. In terms of priori
ties, Dougal said, most univer
sities will first reduce the num
ber of new post-doctoral re
search fellowships.
Then, universities will defer
purchases of major pieces of
equipment, and the number of
graduate students admitted will
be reduced, he said. Dougal said
summer faculty research ap
pointments generally were low
on the list of priorities for cuts,
but he added that many faculty
members across the country
still will be unable to find sup
port for summer projects.
Dougal said the budget cuts
have hurt the Defense Depart
ment as well as universities.
"We believe many qualified fac
ulty members have been forced
to pass up studies that could
help the national security," he
said. Dougal also said he fears
faculty members may start
steering away from Pentagon
sponsored projects "if they can
do other things," because the
Defense Department cannot
guarantee that support for a
project will not be decreased.
