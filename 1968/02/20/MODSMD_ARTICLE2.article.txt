# Nine Anti-CIA Demonstrators Found Not Guilty On All Counts
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The student Judicial Council
last night read a verdict of not
guilty to nine students charged
with illegally demonstrating last
November against campus re
cruiting by the Central Intelli
gence Agency.
The council, unanmiously, de
cided the students were not
guilty of violating the Univer
sity's Policy on Campus Demon
strations, which they termed
"overboard and vague," "unen
forceable" and in violation of the
First Amendment.
It also unanmiously decided
five of the defendants were not
guilty of violating the Funda
mental Standard, the general
code of student conduct. It split
4-4 on whether the other four
demonstrators were guilty, but
this was enough to find them
not guilty.
The four who voted "not guil
ty" of Fundamental Standard
violation were split 3-1 on their

reasons for the verdict, though
not on the verdict itself.
The three held that although
the 4 demonstrators had "inter
ferred with the rights" of one
student who want to be inter
viewed by the CIA, their right
of political expression in this
case had greater "social utility"
than this individual's "private
interest in speech."
This part of the opinion, writ
ten by Eric Treisman, pointed
out the demonstration "in this
case did not approach violence,"
and"the interference itself was
slight."
The demonstrators had been
charged with blocking the west
entrance of Encina Hall, thus
supposedly interfering with one
student's rights to talk to a CIA
recruiter inside.
The fourth council member
who voted "not guilty" on the
Fundamental Standard charge,
Chairman Richard Such, added
some points of his own. First,
he said, the intentions or motives

of the accused violator must be
considered because of how the
Standard is phrased.
"Whether the defendants vio
lated the Standard depends upon
their purpose in engaging in the
dmonstration," he said. More
over, an evaluation of motives
raised questions the Judicial
Council should not try to ans
wer, he added.
In the dissenting opinion on
four of the defendants, it was
asserted their behavior was not
protected by the First Amend
ment
The opinion said the defen
dants had tried to coerce the
CIA recruiter to speak with
them publicly, and also tried to
coerce the University not to
sponsor such interviews.
"Such coercion," it said, "is
antithetical to the idea of an
University and not entitled to
the protection of the First
Amendment."
The dissenting opinion also
said the Council should not try

to consider whether these four
demonstrators were morally jus
tified in "interfering with the
rights of others."
"We would soon be in the busi
ness of constantly deciding if the
defendants before us are in the
morally superior position," it
said.
The author of the dissenting
opinion, Geoffrey Smith, said he
and the other three dissenters
felt in any case that none of the
demonstrators should be pun
ished, because they considered
the offense minimal.
Dean of Students Joel Smith,
prosecuting the case on behalf
of the Administration, said he
would not comment on the de
cision until he had had a chance
to study it carefully.
Ten students were originally
involved in the case, but one has
since graduated and his name
was not mentioned in the deci
sion.
If past practice is repeated,
an appeal would go to the all

faculty Interim Judicial Body
(IJB), which is not currently
recognized by the Associated
Students (nor, therefore, by the
Judicial Council.)
In a separate opinion, four
members of the council said the
IJB's existence is "in clear
breach of the Tri-Partite Com
pact." This was a compromise
reached in 1965 which was sup
posed to create a joint student
faculty appeals board over the
Judicial Council. This board,
however, has never been set
up.
