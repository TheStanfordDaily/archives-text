RIVERSIDE (AP) â€”Student
body presidents at five Univer
sity of California campuses say
they support persons who refuse
to be drafted.
In a statement issued Sunday (
at UC Riverside, the student'
leaders said: "We believe that
compulsory military service is

unconstitutional under the 13th
Amendment, is a loss of person
al liberty without due process of
law and is a means of procuring
labor for government purposes
at less than the market wage."
They said they do not advo
cate any illegal act, but they
added: "We support the action

of all young Americans who,
standing in the American tradi
tion of individual conscience, ex
ercise their right to life and
liberty by refusing induction
into the armed services."
The statement was signed by
Denis J. Michaud, University
Medical Center in San Francis
co; David B. Durand, Davis;
Michael J. Krisman, Irvine; Carl
Wood, Riverside, and Russell
Smith, Santa Cruz.
Their statement was promted
they said, by the government's
ruling Friday that first year
graduate students were no long
er eligible for draft deforments.
After a Board of Regents
meeting at the Riverside cam
pus Sunday, University Presi
dent Charles Hitch called the
gowrnment's decision "very
short-sighted," stating it would
have "a serious effect" on the
supply of "skilled talent."
"I hope the decision is not a
final one," Hitch said. "I will
do everything I can to get it
changed."
