# Expert Raps SST's Risks

A Stanford instructor, warned
against allowing technology to
become the God of those respon
sible for developing supersonic
transports (SST).
In remarks at the Caltech
Management Club, Karl M. Rup
perthal, TWA pilot and program
director in the Graduate School
of Business, said that if 175
SSTs were allowed to fly trans
continental routes "people living
In their wake would have the
joy of being boomed 700 times
a day."
In addition to the noise, he
said that there is "mounting evi
dence" that the joint British-
French effort to develop what
he dubbed the "Abominable"
Concord will result in a plane
that "will be underpowered, in
efficient and expensive."
Hopes for an American SST
don't look much brighter. "Even
to the sophisticated investor
with risk capital to invest, the
financial prospects don't look so
good." The financial assump
tions on the SST are very tenu
ous since a change of one per.
cent in certain elements could
change a profit into a loss.
