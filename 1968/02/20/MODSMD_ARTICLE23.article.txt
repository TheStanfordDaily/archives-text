# Six Coeds Chosen By 'Mademoiselle'
## 
### 
Six Stanford coeds have been
named to Mademoiselle maga
zine's "College Board", a special
group of 1000 young women
who will have the chance to con
tribute to the magazine during
the year and if selected, work
full time for a month in the
summer.
Those chosen were Janie Ar
ies, senior, Jane Ciabattari, sen
ior, Barbara Packer, senior, Nat
alie Strombeck, senior, Wendy
Sue Weiner, senior, and Holly
Ann Wheeler, junior.
The purpose of the program
is to provide college students
with experience in publishing
while still in school. Each mem

ber will have an opportunity to
contribute to Mademoiselle and
help the magazine keep abreast
of campus trends.
At the end of the year, the
magazine editors elect 20 from
the board to become "Guest Edi
tors." They will spent the month
of June as salaried employees
in Mademoiselle's New York of
fices helping the staff putting
out the August college issue.
In addition they are photo
graphed for the August issue
and receive special consideration
for future staff positions with
Mademoiselle. The 1967 guest
editors had a special bonusâ€”a
week's trip to Peru.
