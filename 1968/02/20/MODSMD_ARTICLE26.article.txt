# Stanford Crushed By Chico State Boxers
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
A stubborn Indian boxing
team succumbed to a superior
squad from Chico State Satur
day night in Encina Gym before
an overflow crowd of about 200
people. All four of the meet's
bouts were action-packed and
grueling, but Stanford only man
aged to win one during the con
frontation.
Lanky George McFall at 125
pounds lead the Indians in the
night's first match. McFall put
in a good performance despite
being knocked down once by
Chico State's aggressive Mike
Maxwell.
Stanford's Brant Bassett, box
ing at 139, took consistent left
jabs to the face from State's
Sam Simmons. Surviving a cut
nose, Bassett stubbornly stayed

on his feet through all three
rounds. Although Simmons, who
won the decision, was very
quick, Bassett, a freshman, dis
played real potential.
"Sluggish" is how the Indians'
156er, Barney Adler, described
his style after losing to Jasper
Schuering of Chico State. Adler
fought in a hunched style, and
couldn't quite get moving. Schu
ering won a referee's TKO de
cision in the third round.
Stanford's outstanding per
former of the match was hard
hitting Gene Moffett in the
heavyweight division. Moffett
mercilessly pounded State's Rich
Penaluna into the ropes, where
he then decided to grind Pena
luna into the mat. Before he
could, however, the referee de
cided to award Moffett the vic-

Tory after less than forty sec
onds in the first round.
After the meet Coach Lunny
of Stanford commented, "Of
course, Moffett looked very
good. McFall and Bassett are
beginners and will have better
records next year. Bassett is a
real good puncher, but lacks
experience."
The last boxing meet of the
year against Cal next Thursday
night at Berkeley has been can
celed.
