# Two Teams Still Boast Unblemished Records
## 
### 
Houston, with a winning
streak of 21 games, leads the
nation in the won-lost percent
age category of the latest statis
tics released by the National
Collegiate Sports Service. Hous
ton also is number one in re
bounds, but falls to fourth in
team offense.
St. Bonaventure, with 17 vic
tories and no loses, is the only
other team beside Houston to
still possess a perfect record.
This squad also has the third
highest field goal percentage
in the country, following St.
Peter's and Bradley.
UCLA's 18-1 record places the
AAWU Conference leader as
fourth ranking percentage team
in number of victories through

out the country. UCLA is second
in total offense, but ranks a poor
ninth in rebounds.
A surprisingly tough team
this season, St. Peter's is first
in total offense, first in field goad
percentages, and possesses the
fifth highest won-lost percent
age record in the nation.
