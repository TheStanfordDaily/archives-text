# Forfeits Help Cal To Top Wrestlers
## 
### 
The Stanford wrestling squad
put in a good but futile effort
as they bit the mat before Cal's
team Friday night. Of the 31
points Cal obtained, the Indians
sacrificed 15 points because of
forfeits.
Len Bore hers once again
displayed tremendous ability,
pinning Cat's Heter at 4:18
in the match. John Suttle, Bill
Vogelpohl and Bud Rolling
bery also achieved victory for
the Tribe.
The grapplers are now pre
paring for the AAWU Confer
ence meet, which will be held
here at Stanford on March 2.
