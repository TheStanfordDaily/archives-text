# Imitates Mao Book
## 'Chairman LBJ' Out Soon 
### CICELY BATES 
"Don't spit on the soup.
We've all got to eat"
Chairman Johnson.
This bit of wisdom comes from
the President of the United
States, Lyndon Baines Johnson,
and is the introductory remark
in a forthcoming book, "Quota
tations From Chairman LBJ."
The small red book contains
inspirational, heroic, and other
related sayings of the leader of
our country. Divided into thirty
topics to give an idea of John
son's pattern of thought, the
quotes cover such things of in
terest as Statesmanship and Cri

sis Diplomacy, War and Peace,
The Long March Toward the
Great Society, and Sincerity.
Christopher Wren and Jack
Shepherd, senior editors of
Look magazine compiled the
quotes from speeches, press con
ferences, T.V. interviews, and
fund raising dinners.
Wren is one of twenty jour
nalists presently studying at
Stanford under the Professional
Journalism Fellowship program.
The program is financed by the
Ford Foundation and allows
each journalist to study in a
special field for three, six, or

nine months. Wren will be here
until June and is studying Asian
affairs, especially Mandarin
Chinese.
The quotes run from John
son's years in the Texas Senate
when he said, "I'm not smart
enough to make a President," to
the Ultimate Reflection, "I'm the
only President you've got," made
on April 27, 1964.
Although the book is mod
eled after "Quotations from
Chairman Mao Tse-tung in size
and color, Johnson made the
cover dressed in a Mao-style tu
nic whereas Mao was delegated
to an inside page of his volume.
Wren stated that the book
was originally planned as a "sa
tire" but as the material gather
ed, the President was found to
have said:
• About Bobby Baker in a
Speech on the Senate Floor on
August 23, 1958, "He is a young
man who has already gone very
far and who is going much
farther. I believe he will reach
much greater heights."
• About war in his unsuccess
ful campaign for U.S. Senate in
1941, "I hate war. And if the
day comes when my vote must
be cast to send your boy to war,
that day Lyndon Johnson will
leave his seat in Congress to
go with him."
• About his feeling toward
civil rights as expressed in an
Anti-Negro covenant inserted in
deed for Austin, Texas property
sold by Johnson in 1945, "No
part of the above described
premises shall ever be conveyed
or in any way transferred, de
mised, leased or rented to any
person or persons of African de
scent; provided that this clause
shall not prevent the employ
ment of such persons as domes
tic servants and providing cus
tomary accommodation for
them."
A general "frustration with
the political processes of the

American Presidency" was the
result of these findings, said
Wren. "People are getting tired
of Johnson and what he repre
sents. Too often now the Presi
dent is presented as a packaged
commodity .. . rather like a cake
of soap," added Wren. It seems
now that the "bigger the deci
sions, the less discussion about
them." This book.will allow peo
ple to see through the "cult of
personality" that surrounds the
President, and they will see the
way the President really thinks,
stated Wren.
"Sloppy research' 'is the cri
ticism that the editors believe
could be leveled at their book.
However, great caution was
taken to ensure that all com
ments were neither distorted nor
innaecurate. Each comment can
stand alone, Wren asserts. A pro
fessional researcher was hired
by the two men to check each
quote for any possible errors.
"Quotations from Chairman
LBJ" is not an anti-war book,
explains Wren. But Wren did
add that he had "serious reser
vations" about the war in Viet
nam.
Mar. 15 marks the original in
tended date of release of the
book to the public, but publish
ers Simon and Schuster, may
up the date due to the intense
response the book has received.
The book is now in its fifth
printing and has sold 160,000
copies. The White House Press
Corps has ordered 20 copies and
reviews have been written in nu
merous journals including Time
magazine and the New York
Times.
A Read-in at Stanford is un
der consideration. However,
Wren concluded that the su
preme test of the book's worth
would be to have 100,000 people
surrounding the White House
all reading (he inspirational
thoughts of Chairman LBJ to
the Leader of the people.

result of these findings, said
Wren. "People are getting tired
of Johnson and what he repre
sents. Too often now the Presi
dent is presented as a packaged
commodity .. . rather like a cake
of soap," added Wren. It seems
now that the "bigger the deci
sions, the less discussion about
them." This book.will allow peo
ple to see through the "cult of
personality" that surrounds the
President, and they will see the
way the President really thinks,
stated Wren.
"Sloppy research' 'is the cri
ticism that the editors believe
could be leveled at their book.
However, great caution was
taken to ensure that all com
ments were neither distorted nor
innaecurate. Each comment can
stand alone, Wren asserts. A pro
fessional researcher was hired
by the two men to check each
quote for any possible errors.
"Quotations from Chairman
LBJ" is not an anti-war book,
explains Wren. But Wren did
add that he had "serious reser
vations" about the war in Viet
nam.
Mar. 15 marks the original in
tended date of release of the
book to the public, but publish
ers Simon and Schuster, may
up the date due to the intense
response the book has received.
The book is now in its fifth
printing and has sold 160,000
copies. The White House Press
Corps has ordered 20 copies and
reviews have been written in nu
merous journals including Time
magazine and the New York
Times.
A Read-in at Stanford is un
der consideration. However,
Wren concluded that the su
preme test of the book's worth
would be to have 100,000 people
surrounding the White House
all reading (he inspirational
thoughts of Chairman LBJ to
the Leader of the people.
"Don't spit on the soup.
We've all got to eat"
Chairman Johnson.
This bit of wisdom comes from
the President of the United
States, Lyndon Baines Johnson,
and is the introductory remark
in a forthcoming book, "Quota
tations From Chairman LBJ."
The small red book contains
inspirational, heroic, and other
related sayings of the leader of
our country. Divided into thirty
topics to give an idea of John
son's pattern of thought, the
quotes cover such things of in
terest as Statesmanship and Cri

sis Diplomacy, War and Peace,
The Long March Toward the
Great Society, and Sincerity.
Christopher Wren and Jack
Shepherd, senior editors of
Look magazine compiled the
quotes from speeches, press con
ferences, T.V. interviews, and
fund raising dinners.
Wren is one of twenty jour
nalists presently studying at
Stanford under the Professional
Journalism Fellowship program.
The program is financed by the
Ford Foundation and allows
each journalist to study in a
special field for three, six, or

nine months. Wren will be here
until June and is studying Asian
affairs, especially Mandarin
Chinese.
The quotes run from John
son's years in the Texas Senate
when he said, "I'm not smart
enough to make a President," to
the Ultimate Reflection, "I'm the
only President you've got," made
on April 27, 1964.
Although the book is mod
eled after "Quotations from
Chairman Mao Tse-tung in size
and color, Johnson made the
cover dressed in a Mao-style tu
nic whereas Mao was delegated
to an inside page of his volume.
Wren stated that the book
was originally planned as a "sa
tire" but as the material gather
ed, the President was found to
have said:
• About Bobby Baker in a
Speech on the Senate Floor on
August 23, 1958, "He is a young
man who has already gone very
far and who is going much
farther. I believe he will reach
much greater heights."
• About war in his unsuccess
ful campaign for U.S. Senate in
1941, "I hate war. And if the
day comes when my vote must
be cast to send your boy to war,
that day Lyndon Johnson will
leave his seat in Congress to
go with him."
• About his feeling toward
civil rights as expressed in an
Anti-Negro covenant inserted in
deed for Austin, Texas property
sold by Johnson in 1945, "No
part of the above described
premises shall ever be conveyed
or in any way transferred, de
mised, leased or rented to any
person or persons of African de
scent; provided that this clause
shall not prevent the employ
ment of such persons as domes
tic servants and providing cus
tomary accommodation for
them."
A general "frustration with
the political processes of the

American Presidency" was the
result of these findings, said
Wren. "People are getting tired

The quotes run from John
son's years in the Texas Senate

Although the book is mod
eled after "Quotations from
Chairman Mao Tse-tung in size
and color, Johnson made the
cover dressed in a Mao-style tu

to an inside page of his volume.
Wren stated that the book
was originally planned as a "sa
tire" but as the material gather
ed, the President was found to
have said:
• About Bobby Baker in a
Speech on the Senate Floor on
August 23, 1958, "He is a young
man who has already gone very
far and who is going much
farther. I believe he will reach
much greater heights."
• About war in his unsuccess
ful campaign for U.S. Senate in
1941, "I hate war. And if the
day comes when my vote must
be cast to send your boy to war,
that day Lyndon Johnson will
leave his seat in Congress to
go with him."
• About his feeling toward
civil rights as expressed in an
Anti-Negro covenant inserted in
deed for Austin, Texas property
sold by Johnson in 1945, "No
part of the above described
premises shall ever be conveyed
or in any way transferred, de
mised, leased or rented to any
person or persons of African de
scent; provided that this clause
shall not prevent the employ
ment of such persons as domes
tic servants and providing cus
tomary accommodation for
them."
A general "frustration with
the political processes of the

American Presidency" was the
result of these findings, said
Wren. "People are getting tired
of Johnson and what he repre
sents. Too often now the Presi
dent is presented as a packaged
commodity .. . rather like a cake
of soap," added Wren. It seems
now that the "bigger the deci
sions, the less discussion about
them." This book.will allow peo
ple to see through the "cult of
personality" that surrounds the
President, and they will see the
way the President really thinks,
stated Wren.
"Sloppy research' 'is the cri
ticism that the editors believe
could be leveled at their book.
However, great caution was
taken to ensure that all com
ments were neither distorted nor
innaecurate. Each comment can
stand alone, Wren asserts. A pro
fessional researcher was hired
by the two men to check each
quote for any possible errors.
"Quotations from Chairman
LBJ" is not an anti-war book,
explains Wren. But Wren did
add that he had "serious reser
vations" about the war in Viet
nam.
Mar. 15 marks the original in
tended date of release of the
book to the public, but publish
ers Simon and Schuster, may
up the date due to the intense
response the book has received.
The book is now in its fifth
printing and has sold 160,000
copies. The White House Press
Corps has ordered 20 copies and
reviews have been written in nu
merous journals including Time
magazine and the New York
Times.
A Read-in at Stanford is un
der consideration. However,
Wren concluded that the su
preme test of the book's worth
would be to have 100,000 people
surrounding the White House
all reading (he inspirational
thoughts of Chairman LBJ to
the Leader of the people.
"Don't spit on the soup.
We've all got to eat"
Chairman Johnson.
This bit of wisdom comes from
the President of the United
States, Lyndon Baines Johnson,
and is the introductory remark
in a forthcoming book, "Quota
tations From Chairman LBJ."
The small red book contains
inspirational, heroic, and other
related sayings of the leader of
our country. Divided into thirty
topics to give an idea of John
son's pattern of thought, the
quotes cover such things of in
terest as Statesmanship and Cri

sis Diplomacy, War and Peace,
The Long March Toward the
Great Society, and Sincerity.
Christopher Wren and Jack
Shepherd, senior editors of
Look magazine compiled the
quotes from speeches, press con
ferences, T.V. interviews, and
fund raising dinners.
Wren is one of twenty jour
nalists presently studying at
Stanford under the Professional
Journalism Fellowship program.
The program is financed by the
Ford Foundation and allows
each journalist to study in a
special field for three, six, or

nine months. Wren will be here
until June and is studying Asian
affairs, especially Mandarin
Chinese.
