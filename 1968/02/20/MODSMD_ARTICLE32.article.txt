# Professor Probes Higher Education
## 
### 
This week's Century 21 speak
er is Professor Marvin B. Freed
man. Trained in psychology, he
has spent much time involved
in education and education re
search. (He was assistant dean
of undergraduate education at
Stanford from 1963-1965.)
Professor Freedman will
speak tonight at 7:30 in Tresid
der lounge on "New Concepts in
Higher Education."
Very sharp in his criticism of
the educational structure, he
castigated the University hier
archy following the Free Speech
Movement at Berkeley. "Under
lying all protest is the feeling
among students that they are
being swindled by their educa
tion.
"A new era is hard upon us.
. . . Students are restless and
dissatisfied because they recog
nize, not always consciously,
that the education they are re
ceiving is not functional to the
world they will inhabit in ten
or twenty years time."
He has criticized parents and
citizens for displaying no under
standing of the college youth of
today. Pointing to the lack of
a sense of community or com
munity action at the University,
he calls turmoil on campus an
attempt to reestablish this sense
of community, as part of direct
ing that community toward de
veloping the personality of the
individual.
But Freedman criticized the

majority of students for being
"humorless, leisureless, guilt
ridden drudges" who have ac
cepted "a slave mentality." Aca
demic, business and professional
success have become the sole
standards by which middle class
youths assure their worth and
self esteem Freedman contends.
He concludes that "students,
colleges, and society are moving
in a lock-step that all but rules
out the possibility of producing
the rational protesting man.
Given the current educational
trends, the best that one can
hope for is the preservation of
the Status Quo in American
Society."
