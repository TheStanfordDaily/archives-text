# Hoover Inst. Research Fellow Is Member Of Anti-War Group
## 
### 
A recently formed anti-war
group, Business Executives for
Vietnam Peace, has organized its
military advisory committee to
include five retired Generals and
an Admiral. This committee has
called for an end of the bombing
in North Vietnam and de-escala
tion in the South,
Included in this group of dis
senting military men is one of
the foremost U.S. military ex
perts on Communist China, Brig.
Gen. Samuel B. Griffith, a re
tired Marine who recently trans
lated Mao Tse-tung's treatise on
guerilla warfare. Gen. Griffith is
now a research fellow at Stan
ford's Hoover Institute.
U.S. hawks like to quote Mao's
remark about power coming out
of the mouth of a gun. Gen. Grif
fith put this in truer perspective

by stressing Mao's precept that
"politics should control the gun."
The retired Marine said that
our war effort in South Vietnam
should have been 70 per cent
political and only 30 per cent
military, but was instead "about
90 per cent military."
He said the bombing of the
North had "no decisive effect
whatever" on the fighting in the
South, that it was to Peking's
advantage to bog the U.S. down
in Vietnam and that the war
wasn't worth the commitment
required to win it.
Gen. Griffith said he estimated
more than two years ago that
victory would require 750,000
men "and now it is probably
more."
The co-chairman of the busi
ness-for-p eace group, Harold

Willens, accused the Administra
tion of "a mindless paralysis."
The other military members
of the committee are: Gen. Da
vid Shoup, Brig. Gen. Robert L.
Hughes, Brig. Gen. W. W. Ford,
and Rear Admiral Arnold E.
True.
The new military committee
might perform a valuable func
tion if it invited confidential
communications from soldier
critics serving in Vietnam.
