# Nobel Laureate Finds Tiny Hidden Momentum
## 
### 
A tiny, "lost" quantity of mo
mentum within an electron spin
ning in an electric field has been
"found" mathematically by Stan
ford Nobel laureate William
Shockley.
Prof. Shockley reported his re
search in the current issue of
Physical Review Letters, a sci
entific journal. It is a mathemat
ical confirmation of the elec
tron's "hidden momentum"
which he and his doctoral stu
dent, Robert P. James, reported
in the same publication nearly a
year ago.
The new conclusion results
from theoretical analysis of the
Dirac equation formulated in
1928, a foundation stone of mod
ern elementary particle theory.

The theory described the be
havior of the electron, including
its spin. It took several years for
scientists to recognize that it
also predicted the first anti-par
ticle, the positron or anti-elec
tron, which was discovered ex
perimentally a few years later.
Discrepancies in calculating
momentum produced in matter
by electric and magnetic fields
have plagued scientists dealing
with relativity theory since early
in this century.
The hidden momentum is so
small that its presence can be
detected only by the most deli
cate experiment—the next step
in proving its existence. This is
now being undertaken by Rob
ert James, the student studying
under Prof. Shockley.
