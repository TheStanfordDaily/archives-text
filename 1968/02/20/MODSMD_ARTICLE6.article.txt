# General Studies Revisions Sought
## 
### 
Alternatives to freshman En
glish and Western Civilization
will be available to future Stan
for undergraduates if recom
mendations passed by the sci
ience-humanities faculty yester
day are adopted by the Univer
sity.
The four resolutions passed
by the faculty of the School of
Humanities and Sciences outline
a series of general requirements
to replace the specific courses
now requinxi for graduation.
Students would have to take
an undetermined number of
courses in English and history.
Composition would be included
in the English requirement.
Students would also be re
quired to take courses in each
of three areas: humanities (ex
cluding elementary language),
social science and natural sci
ence (excluding mathematics).
In fulfilling the science re
quirements, students would not
be required to take laboratories
but would be encouraged to do
so.
Students would have to fulfill
requirements in mathematics
foreign languages, but achieve
ment tests would be set up as
a possible alternative to a spe
cific number of units in these
areas.
The faculty recommendations
were drawn up by a five-man ad
hoc committee on general stu
dies headed by mathematics pro
fessor Halsey Royden. The other

members of the group were pro
fessors Charles Drekmeir, poli
tical science; Gavin Langmuir,
history; Lucio Ruotolo, English;
and Mason Yearian, physics.
In their report, the committee
stated that 'the general studies
requirements . . . were based on
the premise that there was a
standard body of information
necessary for a liberal education.
. . . This premise is no longer
valid. It is neither possible nor
desirable to prescribe courses
covering all material worth
learning."
The memorization of facts
ehould be subordinated to
"learning methods of inquiry
and exposure to sources of
knowledge," the committee said.
The faculty also said that
there should be "no restriction
to particular courses or sub
areas" in meeting the distribu
tion requirements.
The faculty recommendations
will now be submitted to the
SES and other appropriate Uni
versity groups.
The faculty's Committee on
Undergraduate Education has
asked to specify courses
which would fulfill the English
and history requirements.
The ad hoc committee stated
that the present general studies
requirements were "unduly pre
scriptive," but added that all re
quirements should not be eli
minated because this could lead
to narrow, specialized programs.

Students would have to take
an undetermined number of
courses in English and history.
Composition would be included
in the English requirement.
Students would also be re
quired to take courses in each
of three areas: humanities (ex
cluding elementary language),
social science and natural sci
ence (excluding mathematics).
In fulfilling the science re
quirements, students would not
be required to take laboratories
but would be encouraged to do
so.
Students would have to fulfill
requirements in mathematics
foreign languages, but achieve
ment tests would be set up as
a possible alternative to a spe
cific number of units in these
areas.
The faculty recommendations
were drawn up by a five-man ad
hoc committee on general stu
dies headed by mathematics pro
fessor Halsey Royden. The other

members of the group were pro
fessors Charles Drekmeir, poli
tical science; Gavin Langmuir,
history; Lucio Ruotolo, English;
and Mason Yearian, physics.
In their report, the committee
stated that 'the general studies
requirements . . . were based on
the premise that there was a
standard body of information
necessary for a liberal education.
. . . This premise is no longer
valid. It is neither possible nor
desirable to prescribe courses
covering all material worth
learning."
The memorization of facts
ehould be subordinated to
"learning methods of inquiry
and exposure to sources of
knowledge," the committee said.
The faculty also said that
there should be "no restriction
to particular courses or sub
areas" in meeting the distribu
tion requirements.
The faculty recommendations
will now be submitted to the
SES and other appropriate Uni
versity groups.
The faculty's Committee on
Undergraduate Education has
asked to specify courses
which would fulfill the English
and history requirements.
The ad hoc committee stated
that the present general studies
requirements were "unduly pre
scriptive," but added that all re
quirements should not be eli
minated because this could lead
to narrow, specialized programs.
Alternatives to freshman En
glish and Western Civilization
will be available to future Stan
for undergraduates if recom
mendations passed by the sci
ience-humanities faculty yester
day are adopted by the Univer
sity.
The four resolutions passed
by the faculty of the School of
Humanities and Sciences outline
a series of general requirements
to replace the specific courses
now requinxi for graduation.
