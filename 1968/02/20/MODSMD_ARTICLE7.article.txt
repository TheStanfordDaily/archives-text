• Soviet Missiles
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sec
retary of Defense Robert S. Mc-
Namara says the Soviet Union
may have as many land-based
nuclear missiles as the United
States by mid-1969.
Sources said Monday that
word was passed to Congress in
McNamara's annual military
posture statement. The point
was not included in the version
publicly released in late Janu

McNamara's disclosure of lat

He estimated they had 720 as

produce new ones which will
carry not one but three war
