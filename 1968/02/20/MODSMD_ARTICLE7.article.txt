• LBJ, LSD Report
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Johnson administration was re
ported Monday to have blocked
congressional testimony by
James L. Goddard, food and
drug commissioner, because he
is opposed to part of the Presi

• Soviet Missiles
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sec
retary of Defense Robert S. Mc-
Namara says the Soviet Union
may have as many land-based
nuclear missiles as the United
States by mid-1969.
Sources said Monday that
word was passed to Congress in
McNamara's annual military
posture statement. The point
was not included in the version
publicly released in late Janu
ary after heavy censoring.
McNamara's disclosure of lat
est intelligence projections—
based largely on reconnaissance
photography — means Russia is
expected to have over 1,000
ICBM's in underground firing
silos in about 18 months.
He estimated they had 720 as
of last Oct. 1.
The United States has reached
Its planned peak of 1,054 land
based missiles. But it plans to
produce new ones which will
carry not one but three war
heads capable of striking differ
ent targets.
