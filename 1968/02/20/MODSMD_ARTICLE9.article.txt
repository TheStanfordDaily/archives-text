# Ends And Means

Arson is a vicious act.
Destruction of property at Stanford is worthless as a protest
against anything, let alone destruction of property in Vietnam.
Presumably the attempts to bum ROTC facilities at Berkeley
and Stanford were conceived as protests against the military.
Evidently the arsonists believe their end (peace) justifies
their means (violence). Sounds just like the U.S. government.
