Long range goals of higher
education should be directed
toward the evolution of an "edu
cation of freedom and sponta
neity that would develop the
personality of the student and
teacher to the fullest extent,"
according to Century 21 speaker
Professor Mervin B. Freedman.
Presenting his speech "New
Concepts in Higher Education"
to a near-capacity audience in
Tresidder lounge last night, the
San Francisco State College
educator said that present
trends in education reflect what's
happening to young people.
"The college student of to
day is more In tune with
change and is preparing for a
life of something like a resur
gence of primitive Christiani
ty. He finds business a less
attractive prospect and prefers
the Peace Corps," the former
Stanford dean of undergradu
ate education stated.
Freedman considers the "root
of current difficulties on college
campuses" to be a "system that
denies and frustrates students."
He further blamed campus tur
moil on an "exhaustion of tradi
tion."
Critical of current education
structures, Freedman suggests

an "ideal college designed to de
velop faculty members because
they are the most ground down
by bureaucracy. If we could help
the faculty, we wouldn't have to
worry about the students."
This ideal college would elimi
nate the competition of "pub
lish-or-perish" and be designed
to overcome the "professional
ism of graduate education by
tempering scholarship with the
importance of preserving indivi
dual integrity." "We must es
tablish a human context to
house knowledge," the psychol
ogy professor explained.
He doubts that the leadership
for the emergence of a "new
education" will come from col
lege administrations and facul
ties.
"There hw been an erosion
of morality among adminis
trators with their Increased
concern for programs, activi
ties and research for outside
agencies. The administrators
must be teachers by way of
their example."
Freedman offered experimen
tal colleges and free universities
as initial movements toward
flexible higher education. "These
colleges are on the periphery
of the bigger institution and can
have interchange without invol
vement."
He cited courses "Field Tech
niques in Establishing Rapport,"
"The College and War" and
"Topless Dancing" offered at
San Francisco State as the re
sults from "dissatisfaction with
the conventional structure.
"The characteristics of the ex
perimental college are involve
ment, subjectivity and concern.
I believe that we have been suc
cessful at San Francisco State
in presenting a flexible grading
program and credit offerings,"
Freedman continued.
Freedman cited other success
es of this new concept of edu
cation. He pointed to a special
teacher-learner relationship that
"halts depersonalization" and to
incorporation of student opinion
about the curriculum to be of
fered.
"In this way the structure
of education is entwined with
its implementation — the cur
riculum combines the rele
vance of human problems and
the classroom," he asserted.

to overcome the "professional
ism of graduate education by
tempering scholarship with the
importance of preserving indivi
dual integrity." "We must es
tablish a human context to
house knowledge," the psychol
ogy professor explained.
He doubts that the leadership
for the emergence of a "new
education" will come from col
lege administrations and facul
ties.
"There hw been an erosion
of morality among adminis
trators with their Increased
concern for programs, activi
ties and research for outside
agencies. The administrators
must be teachers by way of
their example."
Freedman offered experimen
tal colleges and free universities
as initial movements toward
flexible higher education. "These
colleges are on the periphery
of the bigger institution and can
have interchange without invol
vement."
He cited courses "Field Tech
niques in Establishing Rapport,"
"The College and War" and
"Topless Dancing" offered at
San Francisco State as the re
sults from "dissatisfaction with
the conventional structure.
"The characteristics of the ex
perimental college are involve
ment, subjectivity and concern.
I believe that we have been suc
cessful at San Francisco State
in presenting a flexible grading
program and credit offerings,"
Freedman continued.
Freedman cited other success
es of this new concept of edu
cation. He pointed to a special
teacher-learner relationship that
"halts depersonalization" and to
incorporation of student opinion
about the curriculum to be of
fered.
"In this way the structure
of education is entwined with
its implementation — the cur
riculum combines the rele
vance of human problems and
the classroom," he asserted.
Long range goals of higher
education should be directed
toward the evolution of an "edu
cation of freedom and sponta
neity that would develop the
personality of the student and
teacher to the fullest extent,"
according to Century 21 speaker
Professor Mervin B. Freedman.
Presenting his speech "New
Concepts in Higher Education"
to a near-capacity audience in
Tresidder lounge last night, the
San Francisco State College
educator said that present
trends in education reflect what's
happening to young people.
"The college student of to
day is more In tune with
change and is preparing for a
life of something like a resur
gence of primitive Christiani
ty. He finds business a less
attractive prospect and prefers
the Peace Corps," the former
Stanford dean of undergradu
ate education stated.
Freedman considers the "root
of current difficulties on college
campuses" to be a "system that
denies and frustrates students."
He further blamed campus tur
moil on an "exhaustion of tradi
tion."
Critical of current education
structures, Freedman suggests

an "ideal college designed to de
velop faculty members because
they are the most ground down
by bureaucracy. If we could help
the faculty, we wouldn't have to
worry about the students."
This ideal college would elimi
nate the competition of "pub
lish-or-perish" and be designed
to overcome the "professional
ism of graduate education by
tempering scholarship with the
importance of preserving indivi
dual integrity." "We must es
