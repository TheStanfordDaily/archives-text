# The 						Capitol Scenes
## Charlie Eludes Saigon House Search 
### Art Buchwald 
My friend Kober doesn't seem
to identify too much with what
is going on in the cities of
South Vietnam these days; so
my friend Schultz had to ex
plain it to him.
"Suppose," said Schultz, "you
came home one night and found
the police surrounding your
house, and suppose you said to
the chief:
" 'Hey, what are you shooting
in my house for?'
" 'Don't worry, Sir. Charlie's
in there, but we'll get him out.'
" 'That's fine, but do you have
to shoot at every window to do
it?'
" 'It's the only way. If we
don't rout out Charlie, there
will never be any peace in this
neighborhood.'
" 'That's just great, but in the
meantime, would you stop using

that flame thrower on my
house?'
" 'Charlie's dug in and we
have to use everything we've
got. It's for your benefit, Sir.
The sooner we get him out of
there, the better it will be for
everybody.'
Housing Problem
" 'I'm sympathetic with your
problem, and I'd like to get
Charlie out, too, but where am
I going to live if you keep fir
ing mortars into the roof?'
" 'Good heavens, man, don't be
unreasonable. There's more at
stake than your house. If we
don't get Charlie out of there,
we'll lose the respect of every
body in this city.'
" 'Why did you just blow off
my chimney?'
" 'We thought he might be up

there. Look, you can always get
a new chimney.'
" 'Sure, but what am I going
to do for a new garage, since
you just blasted mine away?'
" 'You can't fight crime and
lawlessness without doing some
damage. Now, be a good guy,
and just stand back so we can
move this artillery piece up
here.'
The Ultimatum
" 'Now wait a minute, you're
going too far. I forbid you to
use artillery against my house.'
. "'You are in no position to
forbid us to use anything. Char
lie has to pay for his crimes.'
" 'That's all right with me,
but who's going to pay for my
house?'
" 'I'm sure somebody will take
care of it. Besides, that's not our
department.'
" 'I don't want to be a bore

about this, and I know I can't
see the big picture, but that
happens to be my dwelling and
I worked 25 years to pay for it.
By the way, you know you just
wrecked my kitchen, don't you?'
" 'Sorry about that. I guess
he must be in the bedroom.'
" 'What are you doing with
that tank?'
" We can hit the second floor
better with a tank.'
Where Next?
" 'I'll bet you can. Let me ask
you a question: suppose he's not
in the bedroom?'
" 'Then we'll have to knock
out your living room.'
" 'It figures. I guess one last
appeal to spare my house would
fall on deaf ears, wouldn't it?'
'"What did you say? I can't
hear you because of the dive
bombers.'
" 'Are you going to dive bomb
my house?'
44 'It seems to be the only way.
Listen, this hurts us more than
it hurts you.'
" 'There they go. Holy smoke,
the whole house is falling down!
The whole house! My house is
gone!'
" 'There don't seem to be any
bodies in the rubble. I wonder
if Charlie's in the next house?' "
