## Story On Trial Questioned 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
While your story on the CIA
decision conveyed quite well the
positions expressed in the opin
ions, I believe that it did not
deal with the central thesis of
the dissent in which half the
Council joined.
We stated that in Fundamen
tal Standard cases it was ex
tremely important to consider
any possible justification, but
that it was not necessary to de
cide whether the defendant's al
legation about the CIA were
true. It was enough for us to
decide that in a University com
munity it is never justifiable for
one group of people to attempt
to supress an opinion or be
lief, repugnant to their point of
view, by any means other than
persuasion.
I think it should also be made
clear that we would have found
four of the defendants guilty
of a Fundamental Standard vio
lation on the basis of their at
tempts to force their way into
the west wing of Encina. With
out such overt threatening con
duct, we would not have found
and did not find a violation of
the Fundamental Standard.

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to comment upon
Mr. Hellman's guest column of
last Thursday.
After WW II the Allied gov
ernments decided, in the light
of the Judeo-Christian ethic, that
the butchery of Jews and Christ
ians by the Nazi was contrary
to any civilized man's idea of
morality.
Since premeditation is a key
point in most codes of jurispru
dence, it was judged that the

crimes perpetrated by the Nazis
were particularly heinous.
It was felt that the immoral
ity of the Nazi acts were proven
beyond any reasonable doubt.
But, Mr. Hellman, upon estab
lishment of the immorality of
these crimes against humanity,
the eyes of the Nurenberg
court turned towards those who
built the crematoria, the gas
shower, chambers, the mattress
makers (who used the hair cut
from the bodies) and the gas
manf uaeturers.
Why? Because premeditation
was obvious. For what purpose
could all of these deadly gases
be used? They were not used
in warfare.
Actual Complicity
The Allied court rightly held
that the manufacture of these
gases constituted complicity in
the "final solution."
I hold that if the use of na
palm is particularly heinous and
grossly immonal, then it follows
that its manufacture is immor
al. I hold their view, since it
seems fairly obvious that na
palm is to be used against peo
ple. And I also believe that the
South Vietnamese, the NLF, the
Viet Cong, and the North Viet
namese are people.
Given that I and others feel
strongly that the use of napalm
is immoral, it is necessary that
we take action against its use.
After all, the Nurenberg court
indicted all Germans who knew
but acquiesed.
Would you have us hide our
heads like ostriches? Should we
abandon ourselves to the politi
cal ethic that morality is sus
pended when fighting commu
nism? Does political expedience
supersede all other considera
tions?

Editor, The Daily:
I feel very personally compel
led to oppose Dean Whitaker's
dictum of pursuing the "nor
mal course" as "the only ra
tional thing to do in this kind
of world" (and supported by a
Daily editorial of Feb. 19).
If it is the kind of world in
which a Senator Gubser would
remark that low-yield nuclear
weapons are "not at all as dan
gerous as some Americans
think;" if it is the kind of world
in which the BBC would refuse
to show an impeccably realistic
war flick "The War Game" (Has
Senator, Gubser seen it?); if it is
the kind of world in which the
day by day, hour, by hour suffer
ing and destruction of a people
would be called "normal," then
it is time to alter the "normal
course" of our lives.
I have applied to graduate
school. Why? The "normal
course" of my life leads where?
"This kind of world" presents
us with an undeniable reality,
it cries out for attention; it
compels us to take notice of it,
and to respond accordingly. In
its way, this war, as it contin
ues relentlessly and with ever
more increasing vigor, offers
us the opportunity and the chal
lenge to welcome its responsi
bilities and consequences full
faced, open-eyed, and in a to
totally committed fashion.
Our rational minds alone tell
us this. Then what of our emo
tions, Mr. Whitaker?

I hold that if the use of na
palm is particularly heinous and
grossly immonal, then it follows
that its manufacture is immor
al. I hold their view, since it
seems fairly obvious that na
palm is to be used against peo

South Vietnamese, the NLF, the
Viet Cong, and the North Viet

Given that I and others feel
strongly that the use of napalm
is immoral, it is necessary that
we take action against its use.
After all, the Nurenberg court
indicted all Germans who knew

Would you have us hide our

While your story on the CIA
decision conveyed quite well the
positions expressed in the opin

deal with the central thesis of
the dissent in which half the
Council joined.
We stated that in Fundamen
tal Standard cases it was ex
tremely important to consider
any possible justification, but
that it was not necessary to de
cide whether the defendant's al
legation about the CIA were
true. It was enough for us to
decide that in a University com
munity it is never justifiable for
one group of people to attempt
to supress an opinion or be
lief, repugnant to their point of
view, by any means other than
persuasion.
I think it should also be made
clear that we would have found
four of the defendants guilty
of a Fundamental Standard vio
lation on the basis of their at
tempts to force their way into
the west wing of Encina. With
out such overt threatening con
duct, we would not have found

Napalm Is Immoral
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to comment upon
Mr. Hellman's guest column of
last Thursday.
After WW II the Allied gov
ernments decided, in the light
of the Judeo-Christian ethic, that
the butchery of Jews and Christ
ians by the Nazi was contrary
to any civilized man's idea of
morality.
Since premeditation is a key
point in most codes of jurispru
dence, it was judged that the

crimes perpetrated by the Nazis
were particularly heinous.
It was felt that the immoral
ity of the Nazi acts were proven
beyond any reasonable doubt.
But, Mr. Hellman, upon estab
lishment of the immorality of
these crimes against humanity,
the eyes of the Nurenberg
court turned towards those who
built the crematoria, the gas
shower, chambers, the mattress
makers (who used the hair cut
from the bodies) and the gas
manf uaeturers.
Why? Because premeditation
was obvious. For what purpose
could all of these deadly gases
be used? They were not used
in warfare.
Actual Complicity
The Allied court rightly held
that the manufacture of these
gases constituted complicity in
the "final solution."
I hold that if the use of na
palm is particularly heinous and
grossly immonal, then it follows
that its manufacture is immor
al. I hold their view, since it
seems fairly obvious that na

ple. And I also believe that the

Editor, The Daily:
While your story on the CIA
decision conveyed quite well the
positions expressed in the opin
ions, I believe that it did not
deal with the central thesis of
the dissent in which half the
Council joined.
We stated that in Fundamen
tal Standard cases it was ex
tremely important to consider
any possible justification, but
that it was not necessary to de
cide whether the defendant's al
legation about the CIA were
true. It was enough for us to
decide that in a University com
munity it is never justifiable for
one group of people to attempt
to supress an opinion or be
lief, repugnant to their point of
view, by any means other than
persuasion.
I think it should also be made
clear that we would have found
four of the defendants guilty
of a Fundamental Standard vio
lation on the basis of their at
tempts to force their way into
the west wing of Encina. With
out such overt threatening con
duct, we would not have found
and did not find a violation of
the Fundamental Standard.

Napalm Is Immoral
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to comment upon
Mr. Hellman's guest column of
last Thursday.
After WW II the Allied gov
ernments decided, in the light
of the Judeo-Christian ethic, that
the butchery of Jews and Christ
ians by the Nazi was contrary
to any civilized man's idea of
morality.
Since premeditation is a key
point in most codes of jurispru
dence, it was judged that the

crimes perpetrated by the Nazis
were particularly heinous.
It was felt that the immoral
ity of the Nazi acts were proven
beyond any reasonable doubt.
But, Mr. Hellman, upon estab
lishment of the immorality of
these crimes against humanity,
the eyes of the Nurenberg
court turned towards those who
built the crematoria, the gas
shower, chambers, the mattress
makers (who used the hair cut
from the bodies) and the gas
manf uaeturers.
Why? Because premeditation
was obvious. For what purpose
could all of these deadly gases
be used? They were not used
in warfare.
Actual Complicity
The Allied court rightly held
that the manufacture of these
gases constituted complicity in
the "final solution."
I hold that if the use of na
palm is particularly heinous and
grossly immonal, then it follows
that its manufacture is immor
al. I hold their view, since it
seems fairly obvious that na
palm is to be used against peo
ple. And I also believe that the
South Vietnamese, the NLF, the
Viet Cong, and the North Viet
namese are people.
Given that I and others feel
strongly that the use of napalm
is immoral, it is necessary that
we take action against its use.
After all, the Nurenberg court
indicted all Germans who knew
but acquiesed.
Would you have us hide our
heads like ostriches? Should we
abandon ourselves to the politi
cal ethic that morality is sus
pended when fighting commu
nism? Does political expedience
supersede all other considera
tions?

Editor, The Daily:
I feel very personally compel
led to oppose Dean Whitaker's
dictum of pursuing the "nor
mal course" as "the only ra
tional thing to do in this kind
of world" (and supported by a
Daily editorial of Feb. 19).
If it is the kind of world in
which a Senator Gubser would
remark that low-yield nuclear
weapons are "not at all as dan
gerous as some Americans
think;" if it is the kind of world
in which the BBC would refuse
to show an impeccably realistic
war flick "The War Game" (Has
Senator, Gubser seen it?); if it is
the kind of world in which the
day by day, hour, by hour suffer
ing and destruction of a people
would be called "normal," then
it is time to alter the "normal
course" of our lives.
I have applied to graduate
school. Why? The "normal
course" of my life leads where?
"This kind of world" presents
us with an undeniable reality,
it cries out for attention; it
compels us to take notice of it,
and to respond accordingly. In
its way, this war, as it contin
ues relentlessly and with ever
more increasing vigor, offers
us the opportunity and the chal
lenge to welcome its responsi
bilities and consequences full
faced, open-eyed, and in a to
totally committed fashion.
Our rational minds alone tell
us this. Then what of our emo
tions, Mr. Whitaker?
