# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Pentagon Slights Korean GIs 
### Drew Pearson 
(Note: Drew Pearson's ool
league Jaek Anderson reports
from the 38th parallel between
North and South Korea.)
America's most forlorn and
forgotten soldiers crouch at
night behind sandbags in the
lonely outposts along the demili
tarized zone, waiting for a si
lent, elusive enemy to strike.
A long history of maehinegun
and grenade attacks began on
Nov. 2, 1966, the very day Presi
dent Johnson ended a triumph

ant visit to Seoul. On that day,
the North Koreans bushwhacked
an American patrol and killed
six soldiers. They have been
sniping and marauding ever
since.
In the months that have fol
lowed, hit-and-run North Korean
patrols have killed 25 Gls and
wounded 78. The figures will be
even higher by the time this re
port is printed.
For hardly a night goes by
that the eerie darkness of the
38th parallel isn't shattered by

the sudden crash and flash of a
firefight.
Limiting Orders
Yet the Gls are forbidden to
strike back at the enemy out
posts across the DMZ 4,000
yards away. Their orders are to
watch and wait in the severe,
Arctic-like cold for "Joe" to hit
first.
Joe is the name they have
given the North Korean enemy
and, after dark, ambush patrols
crawl out of the bunkers, belly
through the ice-crusted brush
and lie on the frozen ground,
numb fingers on the triggers,
hoping to intercept "Joe."
For this bleak, bitter duty, the
soldiers of the second (Indian
head) division not only collect
no combat pay and receive no
combat ribbons, they also must
make out with the left-overs
from Vietnam.
I dropped in on these boys in
their bunkers on a savagely cold
night, moving from outpost to
outpost in a blacked-out jeep,
GI Gripes
In cramped, dingy rooms be
hind or below the observation
posts, around hot charcoal burn
ers, the Gls exercised their
constitutional American right to
gripe a little.
"This is the end of the supply
line," grumped one sergeant.
"We get what nobody else
wants." He spoke of shortages
of ammunition, fuel and spare
parts.
"Why don't you find out how
many vehicles are deadheaded?"
suggested another. He referred
to the jeeps, trucks and person
nel carriers that are laid up for
lack of spare parts.
Tank Stopped
"I tried to start up a tank,"
said a sergeant. "No fuel."
Another found the emergency
brake missing from a new jeep.
Others had heard about vehicles
arriving without vital parts.
Several griped about the ra
tioning of fuel oil in their bar
racks. They would come down,
after four of five days on the
demarcation line, to cold bar
racks.
"The guys in the rear don't

suffer none from the cold,"
griped a GI with four days'
stubble on his chin. "After they
take what they need, there
ain't enough left for us guys."
Critical Shortages
The soldiers in the bunkers
and trenches also hadn't re
ceived any of the M-16 rifles
now used in Vietnam, but they
seemed satisfied with their M
-14s.
There had also been ammuni
tion and helicopter shortages,
they said, but new shipments
had now arrived.
I took up their complaints
with Gen. Charles Bonesteel, the
United Nations commander in
Korea. He acknowledged there
had been shortages and prom
ised to investigate the specific
complaints.
My own investigation
confirmed that Vietnam priori
ties and Secretary of Defense
McNamara's economies had left
our 50,000 troops in Korea criti
cally short of the ammunition,
helicopters, spare parts and oth
er equipment they would need
in case of an attack from the
North. Furthermore, the sup
plies that reach this remote
area, as the Gls had complained,
are often deficient.
Rationing' Discouraged
In a few instances, individual
officers had rationed fuel oil for
the barracks; but they have now
been informed this is carrying
economy too far.
The shortages have not de
prived the Gls of the essentials
they need. But in case of an
emergency the Eighth Army in
Korea would be caught short.
The fact is inescapable, how
ever, that the American boys
who endure cold and risk death
every night in the harsh moun
tains facing North Korea have
been neglected by their govern
ment.
The brass hats in their Pen
tagon easy chairs might give a
thought to providing these sol
diers with the combat pay, sup
plies and recognition they de
serve.
