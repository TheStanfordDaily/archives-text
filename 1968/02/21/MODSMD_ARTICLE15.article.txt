ism."
• • *
In order to keep America free,
President Johnson decided early
in 1968 to restrict travel abrpad.
"This is a free country," said
the President, "so stay home and
enjoy it. Or else."
The complicated tax system
the President proposed was a
brilliant Governmental measure
designed to prevent American
tourists from going to Europe
or anywhere else. For it was so
complicated that no one could
figure out how to get there.
Unfortunately, it was so com
plicated that Congress couldn't
understand it either. And as
the confused debate sputtered
on through the spring it ap
peared Congress would junk the
entire proposal out of sheer frus
tration.
It was at this point that an
Administration aide named Al
bert Lipseal came up with an
ingenious alternative:
"Let us," he said, "allow any
American to travel anywhere
he wishes for as long as he likes
and spend as much as he wants.
The only restrictions will be
that when he gets home from

his trip, he can't talk about
it."
Congress, which was sick and
tired of hearing from constitu
ents who had spent a week
abroad and thereby qualified as
foreign policy experts, passed
the Lipseal Law by unanimous
voice vote. This, of course, spell
ed the end of American tourism.
That first summer, to be sure,
a few unwary tourists, not for
seeing the difficulties, still brav
ely took the trips they had long
planned. Typical, perhaps, was
Mr. and Mrs. Homer T. Petti
bone.
"After all," said Mr. Pettibone
righteously, "we are only going
for own enjoyment. What do we
care if we can't tell people about
it afterward."
So the Pettibones did such
spas as Gstaad, Obergurgle and
Ste. Crayon Sur-la-Tabl-\ return
ing home exuberant and refresh
ed — only to run into Mr. and
Mrs. Claude Dropper at their
first dinner party.
"Hear you've been to Ste.
Crayon," said Mr. Dropper.
"Mmmm," said Mr. Pettibone
with a smile, for he wasn't to
be trapped that easily into vio
lating the Lipseal Law.
"The Missus and I were there
in *63," said Mr. Dropper. "Mar
velous place. Remember that
wonderful chocolate-covered ba
gle shop, dear, on the left side
of the Strandbundstrasse?"

"Oh, no, it's on the right... "
cried Mrs. Pettibone b fore
catching herself.
"And that lovely flea market
where we bought those hand
woven fleas for only six pias
ters," said Mrs. Dropper.
. "Six piasters! Why today ... "
interrupted Mr. Pettibone, be
fore suddenly getting a cough
ing fit.
And so it went — the Drop
pers telling the Pettibones all
about Ste. Crayon, interminably
and inaccurately.
After an hour and 37 min?
utes, the Pettibones, who had
each been growing ever more
purple, simultaneously exploded
and poured forth a glowing, de
tailed up-to-the-minute account
of what Ste. Crayon was really
like.
They were, of course, imme
diately arnested by the F. 8.1,
and sentenced to one-to-three
years as violators of the Lipseal
Law. But as Mr. Pettibone said
at his trial: "I don't care. It was
worth it."
• • •
For as Mr. Lipseal had so
cleverly foreseen, when you re
turn from abroad, you neven
get to tell about your trip any
way. All you ever get to do is
listen to your friends tell about
how it was when they were
there.
And no man, no matter how
noble, can suffer this in silence.

In order to keep America free,
President Johnson decided early
in 1968 to restrict travel abrpad.
"This is a free country," said
the President, "so stay home and
enjoy it. Or else."
The complicated tax system
the President proposed was a
brilliant Governmental measure
designed to prevent American
tourists from going to Europe
or anywhere else. For it was so
complicated that no one could
figure out how to get there.
Unfortunately, it was so com
plicated that Congress couldn't
understand it either. And as
the confused debate sputtered
on through the spring it ap
peared Congress would junk the
entire proposal out of sheer frus
tration.
It was at this point that an
Administration aide named Al
bert Lipseal came up with an
ingenious alternative:
"Let us," he said, "allow any
American to travel anywhere
he wishes for as long as he likes
and spend as much as he wants.
The only restrictions will be
that when he gets home from

his trip, he can't talk about
it."
Congress, which was sick and
tired of hearing from constitu
ents who had spent a week
abroad and thereby qualified as
foreign policy experts, passed
the Lipseal Law by unanimous
voice vote. This, of course, spell
ed the end of American tourism.
That first summer, to be sure,
a few unwary tourists, not for
seeing the difficulties, still brav
ely took the trips they had long
planned. Typical, perhaps, was
Mr. and Mrs. Homer T. Petti
bone.
"After all," said Mr. Pettibone
righteously, "we are only going
for own enjoyment. What do we
care if we can't tell people about
it afterward."
So the Pettibones did such
spas as Gstaad, Obergurgle and
Ste. Crayon Sur-la-Tabl-\ return
ing home exuberant and refresh
ed — only to run into Mr. and
Mrs. Claude Dropper at their
first dinner party.
"Hear you've been to Ste.
Crayon," said Mr. Dropper.
"Mmmm," said Mr. Pettibone
with a smile, for he wasn't to
