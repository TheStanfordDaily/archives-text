## Terminal Graduate Student Conflict 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
On one of my infrequent visits
to LASSU this past Thursday,
I had the opportunity of wit
nessing LASSU in action, and,
parenthetically, Dally coverage
as well.
A memo from the elections
commissioner was presented to
LASSU. The memo related to
a resolution passed by LASSU
in May, 1961, regarding the
status of Terminal Graduate
Students. From the memo we
find that the University allows
TGR's the use of department
facilities, athletic facilities and
coverage under the Health Ser
vice—but not the privileges of a
fully registered student.
This is supported by the fact
that TGR's do not have a regu
lar student body card (Certifi
cate of Registration) and that
they pay only $45 per quarter.
In May, 1961, LASSU passed
a resolution stating:
"Be it resolved: that the Leg
islature defines the status of
Terminal Graduate Students
that they may hc\: office if
they were elected o that of
fice while they were regular
registered students, but that
they may not assume office
while they are Terminal Grad
uate Students.
"Be it further resolved: that
Terminal Graduate Students
may not be allowed to vote
in ASSU elections."
Former Action
A 1 Rosencrantz, ASSU presi
dent in '62-'63, was a Terminal
Graduate Student when he
wanted to run for election but
under the force of this resolu
tion paid tuition to become a
registered student before he
stood for election.
As the situation stood in
LASSU on Febraury 15, 1968, we
had several TGR's as LASSU
members, and it turned out that
Cesare Massarenti is currently
a TGR and was a TGR when he
and Peter Lyman (also a TGR)
ran for election and subsequent
ly held office.
We are dealing here with
negligence on the part of the
election commissioner when
Peter Lyman and Cesare Mas
sarenti stood for office, but fur
thermore we had an illegal stu
dent government in power until
February 15th when LASSU
with a minimum of fuss decided

to ignore the whole question of
legality by reversing the status
of TGR's to that of full stu
dents with the right to vote and
hold office.
My question is what kind of
student government do we have
now? Why was this sweeping
issue of the legality of the pres
ent ASSU president not brought
before the student body?

TGR Student Protests
Disenf ranch ised Voters
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to publicly pro
test the conduction of the ASSU
vice presidential election last
week. I attempted to vote on
Friday as a TGR student and
found that the polling place had
left before the stated closing
time.
I was informed at another
table by the post office that two
or three other students had also
wanted to vote and found the
polling place gone.
It appears that potential vot
ers were denied the chance to
cast their ballots; a clear sub
version of the democratic pro
cess.
I feel that the election should
be rerun, or the polls opened
again to allow disenfranchised
voters the opportunity to ex
press their preference for ASSU
vice president.

Greene's Documentary
Editor, The Daily:
The recent Felix Greene docu
mentary "Inside North Viet
nam" is a picture that not only
warrants its broadcast, but war
rants its compulsory viewing by
every man, woman, child, pilot,
and bombardier in this country.
What the film does show is
that bombs don't just destroy
governments, but cultures as
well; that bombs don't just de
stroy enemy ammunition depots
and air bases—as President
Lyndon B. Johnson, Secretary
of State Dean Rusk, or the U.S.
State Department wants us to
believe—but houses and hos
pitals, and at times almost en
tire cities as well; that bombs

don't just kill soldiers, but wo
men and children as well; and
that soldiers are not just "ene
mies" or "Charlies," but human
beings endowed with the same
right to live, and believe in an
ideology as everyone else.
AH Are Bombed
Furthermore—as Felix Greene
well shows—bombs don't make
a conscious discrimination be
tween civilians and soldiers . . .
When, in the name of peace
and liberty, the United States
feels justified in destroying 85
per cent of a town "in order to
save it,"it is about time that
someone examines the concrete
values of the words "peace" and
"liberty." Humanity has not pro
gressed very far from the dark
ages when in the name of Chris
tian orthodoxy many violated
the principle of Christian char
ity to burn at the stakes the
heterodox thinkers. . . .
Unfortunately, it seems that
the degree of civilization of a
country is measured by its citi
zens' ability to destroy and kill.
No Escape
No matter how innocent the
people of North or South Viet
nam may be in this stupid con
flict, they can't escape American
napalm by sprinkling lambs'
blood over their doors.
If by seeing the atrocities of
the Vietnam war, as depicted by
Felix Greene, every man, wo
man, child, pilot, or bombardier
in this country is shocked and

feels uncomfortable, then good,
for they all ought to feel uncom
fortable.
Perhaps if they realized that
it is wrong to call aggression
defense, to objectify human be
ings and degrade them, as it is
wrong to euphemize murder,
wars would not occur so fre
quently and would not find such
minor opposition as they do in
this country. . . .

ROTC Demonstration
Has No Anti-Draft Ties
Editor, The Daily:
The skits and parade held
Tuesday afternoon to dramatize
ROTC's presence on campus was
in no way connected with Wed
nesday's Anti-Draft Rally, and
in itself is incorrectly called an
anti draft rally.
Tuesday's event was designed
to call attention to the fact that
the ROTC curriculum, which re
ceives academic credit, is incom
patible with the principles of
the university. The nature of
military training conflicts with
the goal of educating thinking
citizens and furthering intellec
tual development and criticism.
The ROTC staff are responsi
ble not, as with other Stanford
faculty, to the academic commu
nity, but to military superiors
and the' Pentagon.
These issues are concerned

with the extent to which this
university community lives up
to the ideals it proclaims. Con
fusion of these issues with the
draft shows a failure to perceive
the effects of the new draft pol
icy on the entire academic com
munity and the nation.

Sneed's Speech Draws
Another Student Reply
Editor, Tlie Daily:
In the Feb. 13 Daily, there is
an article entitled "Law Prof
Likens New Left, Fascists". The
article begins "The New Left
has rejected God, rationality,
and the basic tenets of our cul
ture said Stanford Law School
professor Joseph T. Sneed at a
Lutheran Community Move
ment luncheon last Friday."
I would like to point out to
the Stanford community that at
the University Mr. Sneed also
wears another hat. He is pres
ently the Chairman of the In
terim Judicial Body which is the
Administration's Kangaroo
Court for political trials.
Mr. Sneed was appointed by
Mr. Sterling, as are all the mem
bers of the IJB. The ASSU Con
stitution by-laws as amended
do not recognize the authority
of the IJB over student conduct.
