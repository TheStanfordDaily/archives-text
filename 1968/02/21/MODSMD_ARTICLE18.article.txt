## Theta Xi Cook Anti-Darwin 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Mrs. Dorthea Hall, the red
haired, freckle-faced cook at the
Theta Xi house, does not be
lieve in evolution. "Darwin was
misguided," she says.

The two rush chairmen of the
house, Mike Parker and Frank
Petterson, have capitalized on
Mrs. Hall's belief by running
notices in the personal column
of The Daily. The two notices
which have been run so far read
"Evolution is a communist plot.
Our cook thinks so" and "Pala
din tried it. Why don't you?"
The fraternity has a list of
other quotes it plans to run in
The Daily during: the next ten
weeks to advertise its rush
progTam.
Mike Lindsay, the house pres
ident, commented on one of the
major reasons Theta Xi feels it
needs an extra sales pitch.
Theta Xi is so far away from
the center of campus that it
needs to make a bit of noise
to be noticed by freshmen in
terested in rushing.
The quote "Paladin tried it.
Why don't you?" has a relative
ly clcar-cut explanation behind
it. Richard Boone, star of the
TV serial "Have Gun, Will
Travel," was initiated as mem

ber No. 238 of Theta Xi when
he attended Stanford.
The quote "Evolution is a
communist plot. Our cook thinks
so" has a more intricate story
behind it. Mrs. Hall, the cook,
remarked, "I thought it was sort
of a sneaky way to get publicity
myself." She does adm i+ to the
fact, however, that she does not
believe in evolution.
Mrs. Hall said, "I think peo
ple who teach evolution in the
schools are misinformed. Some
people think science proves
everything out. There are a lot
of intangibles we can't prove in
black and white. There are some
things we should accept with
out proof. It would be a pretty
cynical world if we didnt."
She went on to hold forth
before her audience of Theta
Xi members clustered in the
kitchen. She was making what
she called the dinner's dessert
as she spoke about the Divine
Creation. "God created us in
his image. God is a being with
hands, feet, and a brain, like
we are. He didn't create us
from tadpoles, apes or
chimps."
Mrs. Hall is cooking for her
first year at the Theta Xi house.
Last year she was a relief cook
on the Row. Before that time,
cooking was only her hobby,
and she was a hairdresser for
25 years.

cooking was only her hobby,
and she was a hairdresser for
25 years.


ANTI-DARWIN — Mrs. Doro
thea Hall, Theta XI cook, does
not believe in evolution.
Mrs. Dorthea Hall, the red
haired, freckle-faced cook at the
Theta Xi house, does not be
lieve in evolution. "Darwin was
misguided," she says.

The two rush chairmen of the
house, Mike Parker and Frank
Petterson, have capitalized on
Mrs. Hall's belief by running
notices in the personal column
of The Daily. The two notices
which have been run so far read
"Evolution is a communist plot.
Our cook thinks so" and "Pala
din tried it. Why don't you?"
The fraternity has a list of
other quotes it plans to run in
The Daily during: the next ten
weeks to advertise its rush
progTam.
Mike Lindsay, the house pres
ident, commented on one of the
major reasons Theta Xi feels it
needs an extra sales pitch.
Theta Xi is so far away from
the center of campus that it
needs to make a bit of noise
to be noticed by freshmen in
terested in rushing.
The quote "Paladin tried it.
Why don't you?" has a relative
ly clcar-cut explanation behind
it. Richard Boone, star of the
TV serial "Have Gun, Will
Travel," was initiated as mem

ber No. 238 of Theta Xi when
he attended Stanford.
The quote "Evolution is a
communist plot. Our cook thinks
so" has a more intricate story
behind it. Mrs. Hall, the cook,
remarked, "I thought it was sort
of a sneaky way to get publicity
myself." She does adm i+ to the
fact, however, that she does not
believe in evolution.
Mrs. Hall said, "I think peo
ple who teach evolution in the
schools are misinformed. Some
people think science proves
everything out. There are a lot
of intangibles we can't prove in
black and white. There are some
things we should accept with
out proof. It would be a pretty
cynical world if we didnt."
She went on to hold forth
before her audience of Theta
Xi members clustered in the
kitchen. She was making what
she called the dinner's dessert
as she spoke about the Divine
Creation. "God created us in
his image. God is a being with
hands, feet, and a brain, like
we are. He didn't create us
from tadpoles, apes or
chimps."
Mrs. Hall is cooking for her
first year at the Theta Xi house.
Last year she was a relief cook
on the Row. Before that time,
cooking was only her hobby,
and she was a hairdresser for
25 years.
