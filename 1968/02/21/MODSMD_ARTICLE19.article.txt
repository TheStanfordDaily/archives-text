# Engineers Debate Core Curriculum
## 
### 
A proposed core curriculum
for the engineering school was
the subject of much controversy
at an "Open Forum" Monday
night. Sponsored by Tau Beta
Pi, the engineering honors so
ciety, the meeting had been
called to discuss the interim re
port of the Study of Engineer
ing Education at Stanford com
mittee.
Prior to the meeting, how
ever, the committee had made
public a revised core program
which it advanced "for discus
sion." The core program is a
selection of courses that all en
gineering students are required
to take. The courses mainly lie
in the fields of math and phys
ics.
At Monday's meeting Pro
fessor Ralph Smith, chairman
of the SEES committee, out
lined the work of the commit
tee which is midway through
its study of all aspects of en
gineering education.
One of the main criticisms of
the core program raised at the
meeting was the "heavy dose" of
courses required in the fresh
man year.
One student at the meeting
said that he had examined the
proposed core and couldn't "see

how it is any better than the
core we have presently ... in
fact it may even be a little worse
in that it loads tremendously the
first two years."
Asked his opinion of the pres
ent core, Ralph Smith replied,
"The present core needs a care
ful overhaul."
One student pointed out that
when a revision of any core-type
program is undertaken the goals
of the students and faculty must
be kept in mind.
Another student voiced the
opinion that Sociology 1 might
be a more socially valuable
course than "a course taught in
the engineering department."
A bachelor of arts program
in engineering was suggested
as one way to increase social
awareness. However, it was
pointed out that students con
templating graduate work in
engineering would almost
have to take the B.S. pro
gram and sacrifice "socially
broadening" courses.
The consensus of the meeting
was that more flexibility was,
indeed, needed. At one point in
the discussion Ralph Smith
threw up his arms and said,
"All right, you've made your
point."
