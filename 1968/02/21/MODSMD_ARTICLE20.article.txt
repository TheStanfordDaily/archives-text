# S.C. Controversy: Three Blacks Shot
## 
### RICHARD ANTHONY College Press Service 
ORANGEBURG, S. C. (CPS)
— On Thursday, February 8,
three black students were shot
to death when police opened fire
on an assemblage of students
near the entrance to South Col
lege here. Thirty-seven students
were wounded.
Most of the early press cov
erage of the event was a restate
ment of the police view of what
had happened. It was reported,
therefore, that the three died in
an exchange of gunfire with the
police, that sniper, fire from the
students started the exchange,
that "black power militants"
had incited a student riot, that
students had stolen ROTC tar
get rifles for use in the battle,
that the presence of 600 Guards
men and several hundred po
licemen had averted further vi
lence, etc.
Next day, the first public dis
pute about what happened
Thursday night began. NBC Cor
respondent Sidney Lazard, who
was on the scene that night,
said in a morning broadcast that
the other newsmen on the scene
agreed that the police gunfire
wasn't provoked by sniper fire
from the students. State offi
cials, including Gov. Robert E.
McNalr, emphatically denied
Lazard's conclusion.
In his evening broadcast La
zard omitted any reference to
the question of who fired first,
because, he explained later, the
situation that night was too con
fused for him to be sure what
had happened, and because he
didn't think the issue was worth
the controversy it had aroused.
But controversy continued,
nonetheless, and spread to . in
clude a number of questions
about what happened that night.
Some of the questions have been
more or less resolved — others
probably never will be.
Investigative work by two re
porters from out of town has
revealed that one of the dead
students — Sam Hammond —
was definitely shot in the back.
The evidence Is not as conclu
sive in the case of one of the
other students — Delano Middle
ton — but is still strong.
Gov. McNair has told the press
that one of the reasons the
troopers opened up was that
they thought one of their own
men had been shot. Two news
men who were there however —
Lazard and Dozier Mobley, an
Associated Press photographer
— say that the trooper, who was
hit In the face by a piece of

wood thrown by one of the stu
dents, had been put in an ambu
lance before the police bar
rage began, so that the other
police had plei.ty of time to find
out he wasn't shot.
Police officials, explaining why
the troopers used shotguns load
ed with the b'"ivy shot used by
deer-hunters, as well as carbine
rifles, told the press the wind
was blowing away from the stu
dents so that they couldn't use
tear-gas.
Lazard says he can't remem
ber any wind. "We were out
there a long time," he says,"and
we would have been a lot cold
er if there had been a wind."
Two S.C. State faculty members,
who were on campus Thursday,
also can recall no wind.
A photo taken just after the
police barrage shows smoke ris
ing from a fire the students had
set earlier. The smoke is rising
straight up. Another photo,
taken before the police moved
in, shows smoke drifting in the
direction of the students.
Gov. McNair indicated last
week that one of the reasons the
police had to resort to gunfire
was that ROTC target rifles had
been stolen by students. This
week, the governor's represen
tative in Orangeburg, Henry
Lake, admitted that the rifles
had been stolen after the police
barrage.
There are other, questions
that bear on the Orangeburg
shootings, but they are of a
kind that can't be readily re
searched in a two or three-day
visit to a town that looks and
feels like an armed camp. Some
of them:
• To what extent Is Orange
burg a segregated community?
Several residents said that the
bowling alley, which was the tar
get of student integration ef
forts early last week, was real
ly a symbol of a widespread pat
tern of discrimination in Orange
burg. They cited the city hos
pital, the movie theaters, the
schools and the news media as
the most discriminatory institu
tions.
• Were "black power mili
tants'" responsible for the stu
dent demonstrations? One re
port, unconfirmed, is that the
Orangeburg SNCC representa
tive, Cleveland Sellers, opposed
both the demonstration at the
bowling alley Thursday and the
demonstration on campus Thurs
day night. (At this writing Sell
ers is still in the state peniten
tiary in Columbia, S. G. on $50,-
000 bond).
