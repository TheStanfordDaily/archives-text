## D'Hooge Superb 
### 
For organ enthusiasts, last
Friday night's recital was a tan
talizing disappointment. Guest
Organist Kamiel D'Hooghe of
Belgium was superb, and the or
gan itself is unquestionably
beautiful, but the evening's per
formance never quite reached
their, level.
It was a case of "almost,
but . . . as steady, almost
droning, high notes dominated
one selection after another. Per
haps a single-composer (i.e., all
Bach) program necessarily limit
ed the variety of the program,
but one can't help but feel (and
hope) that the magnificent Hrad
tsky organ was not allowed to
demonstrate its full potential
Friday night.
In fairness, it must be said
that several selections were a
delight that well redeemed the
generally undistinguished pro
gram.
The first full selection, "Kyrle,
Gott Vater In Ewigkeit," import
ed a promising start to the eve
ning, and despite a number of
unfortunate near-misses, Mr.
D'Hooghes fulfilled that promise
fully after the intermission.
Masterfully interweaving the
quiet, floating notes of "Vater
Unser in Himmelreich "to build
a peacefully contemplative
mood, he followed, two selec
tions later, with "Aus tlfer
schrel-lch zu dir" ("From deep

distress, I cry to Thee"), dem
onstrating beautifully what the
other selections could have been.
A startling opening was pene
trating without being shrill, and
he blended a ribbon of bass into
the rising tempo to fashion a
full, satisfying highlight to the
evening.
Hopefully, the third recital
In this dedication series will
fulfill the promise of the Hrad
tsky organ which Mr. D'Hooghe
revealed so well.
