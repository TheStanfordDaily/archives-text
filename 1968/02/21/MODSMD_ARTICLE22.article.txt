## West Bay's 'Dutchman' Imaginative, Creditable 
### RICHARD N. ATKINS PIERCE A. McNALLY 
One does not attend the pro
ductions of the West Bay Opera
Association to enjoy profession
al renditions. The West Bay is
an exciting, community organi
zation which brings opera of
adequate quality to the area.
More often than not, the per
formances are entertaining ra
ther than moving.
Given the limited scope of the
group, this is as it should be;
it is highly commendable that
the association does not attempt
to project a professional air.
Saturday evening's produc
tion of one of Wagner's earli
est works, "The Flying Dutch
man", was Imaginative and
creditable. The opera, as be
came manifest during the
overture (orchestrated by two
pianos), is well-suited to the
capabilities of the West Bay.
It was written before Wagner
had completely broken away
from the traditional Italian
school and hence he had "not yet
developed his overwhelming or
chestral genius. The two pianos,
then served as satisfactory or
chestration. Also, the work Is
considerably shorter than his
later operas and does not con
tain as many complicated leit
motifs.
The first act was the weakest
of the performance. The major
drawback of the whole produc
tion was the stilted and wooden
acting, which was most acute
during the first act.
Daland, played by Anthony
Cuevas, sang such quips as
"What amazement!" with the
gusto of one of Cassius Clay's
opponents in the tenth round.
As the act and the opera pro
gressed, he gained assurance
and poise and gave ever more
convincing portrayals of a fa
ther trying to arrange the mar
riage of his daughter to a hand
some suitor.
Along with stage poise, he
gained a more solid confidence
in his voice and although
throughout the performance
he had difficulty with higher
notes, It never cracked as it
did once during the first act.

The Dutchman enters after
Daland's scene wtih his sailors
and the steersman, a bold, mas
culine part played unconvincing
ly by Ray Kidder, largely due
to his somewhat raspy voice
which lacked the authority de
manded by the role.
George Baker, as the Dutch
man, seemed unsure at first but
gradually acquired the presence
and verve needed to bring the
part across effectively. The high
light of the act was the closing
scene between the Dutchman
and Daland during which they
sang an inspiring duet, against
the backdrop of their two ships,
about Daland's Senta and how
they will each profit from the
impending marriage.
The second act was exception
ally well done. Senta, imagina
tively played by Edith Zitelli,
was introduced during the open
ing spinning scene amidst a
chorus of colorfully-costumed
Norwegian maidens.
She sang what is known as
"Senta's Song," which is about
the Dutchman's imminent arri
val, effectively, using her power
ful, yet mellow soprano voice to
its fullest extent. 3
Senta's nurse, played by the
round, buxom Jane Hopper,
sang her small role commend
ably and punctuated the scene
delightfully with sharp, quick
movements and gesticulations.
Senta seemed to Inspire the
rest of the cast, for after her
introduction the production be
came progressively better.
Notably, the scene between
Senta and the Dutchman was
musically and dramatically su

perior to anything preceding it
during the op°ra. The Dutch
man, though somewhat over
shadowed by Senta's power and
tonality, acted and sang well the
part of a man 'ailing in love.
The situation was complicated
by Erik, Senta's childhood boy
friend played by Aivars Osis. He
gave a mediocre rendition of an
infuriated lover and although he
tended to bellow and became a
bit hoarse, he came across as
the peasant-type huntsman that
Wagner envisaged.
The most impressive facet of
the third act was the relative
ease with which the chorus of
maidens and sailors sang. The
chorus of sailors had previously
sung not as a unit, but as ten
individual men.
In closing the act, they pulled
together and brought the opera
to a credible conclusion. The
Dutchman, doubting Senta's vow
of eternal love sailed off only
to sink while the impassioned
Senta jumps into the sea.
A word should be said about
the engaging sets, and espe
cially the use of the scrim,
onto which was colorfully pro
jected the Dutchman's ship.
Costumes, too, were realistic
and generally appropriate.
Mention should also be made
concerning Henry Holt and Ruth
Spector who played the pianos.
Sometimes the sweet, dulcet
theme associated with Senta was
played with the vivacity of the
gale theme, but the demanding
job was admirably accomplished.
And to all at the West Bay,
hefty congratulations for a suc
cessful performance.

the backdrop of their two ships,
about Daland's Senta and how
they will each profit from the
impending marriage.
The second act was exception
ally well done. Senta, imagina
tively played by Edith Zitelli,
was introduced during the open
ing spinning scene amidst a
chorus of colorfully-costumed
Norwegian maidens.
She sang what is known as
"Senta's Song," which is about
the Dutchman's imminent arri
val, effectively, using her power
ful, yet mellow soprano voice to
its fullest extent. 3
Senta's nurse, played by the
round, buxom Jane Hopper,
sang her small role commend
ably and punctuated the scene
delightfully with sharp, quick
movements and gesticulations.
Senta seemed to Inspire the
rest of the cast, for after her
introduction the production be
came progressively better.
Notably, the scene between
Senta and the Dutchman was
musically and dramatically su

perior to anything preceding it
during the op°ra. The Dutch
man, though somewhat over
shadowed by Senta's power and
tonality, acted and sang well the
part of a man 'ailing in love.
The situation was complicated
by Erik, Senta's childhood boy
friend played by Aivars Osis. He
gave a mediocre rendition of an
infuriated lover and although he
tended to bellow and became a
bit hoarse, he came across as
the peasant-type huntsman that
Wagner envisaged.
The most impressive facet of
the third act was the relative
ease with which the chorus of
maidens and sailors sang. The
chorus of sailors had previously
sung not as a unit, but as ten
individual men.
In closing the act, they pulled
together and brought the opera
to a credible conclusion. The
Dutchman, doubting Senta's vow
of eternal love sailed off only
to sink while the impassioned
Senta jumps into the sea.
A word should be said about
the engaging sets, and espe
cially the use of the scrim,
onto which was colorfully pro
jected the Dutchman's ship.
Costumes, too, were realistic
and generally appropriate.
Mention should also be made
concerning Henry Holt and Ruth
Spector who played the pianos.
Sometimes the sweet, dulcet
theme associated with Senta was
played with the vivacity of the
gale theme, but the demanding
job was admirably accomplished.
And to all at the West Bay,
hefty congratulations for a suc
cessful performance.
One does not attend the pro
ductions of the West Bay Opera
Association to enjoy profession
al renditions. The West Bay is
an exciting, community organi
zation which brings opera of
adequate quality to the area.
More often than not, the per
formances are entertaining ra
ther than moving.
Given the limited scope of the
group, this is as it should be;
it is highly commendable that
the association does not attempt
to project a professional air.
Saturday evening's produc
tion of one of Wagner's earli
est works, "The Flying Dutch
man", was Imaginative and
creditable. The opera, as be
came manifest during the
overture (orchestrated by two
pianos), is well-suited to the
capabilities of the West Bay.
It was written before Wagner
had completely broken away
from the traditional Italian
school and hence he had "not yet
developed his overwhelming or
chestral genius. The two pianos,
then served as satisfactory or
chestration. Also, the work Is
considerably shorter than his
later operas and does not con
tain as many complicated leit
motifs.
The first act was the weakest
of the performance. The major
drawback of the whole produc
tion was the stilted and wooden
acting, which was most acute
during the first act.
Daland, played by Anthony
Cuevas, sang such quips as
"What amazement!" with the
gusto of one of Cassius Clay's
opponents in the tenth round.
As the act and the opera pro
gressed, he gained assurance
and poise and gave ever more
convincing portrayals of a fa
ther trying to arrange the mar
riage of his daughter to a hand
some suitor.
Along with stage poise, he
gained a more solid confidence
in his voice and although
throughout the performance
he had difficulty with higher
notes, It never cracked as it
did once during the first act.

The Dutchman enters after
Daland's scene wtih his sailors
and the steersman, a bold, mas
culine part played unconvincing
ly by Ray Kidder, largely due
to his somewhat raspy voice
which lacked the authority de
manded by the role.
George Baker, as the Dutch
man, seemed unsure at first but
gradually acquired the presence
and verve needed to bring the
part across effectively. The high
light of the act was the closing
scene between the Dutchman
and Daland during which they
sang an inspiring duet, against

Association to enjoy profession
al renditions. The West Bay is
an exciting, community organi
zation which brings opera of
adequate quality to the area.
More often than not, the per
formances are entertaining ra
ther than moving.
Given the limited scope of the
group, this is as it should be;
it is highly commendable that
the association does not attempt
to project a professional air.
Saturday evening's produc
tion of one of Wagner's earli
est works, "The Flying Dutch
man", was Imaginative and
creditable. The opera, as be
came manifest during the
overture (orchestrated by two
pianos), is well-suited to the
capabilities of the West Bay.
It was written before Wagner
had completely broken away
from the traditional Italian
school and hence he had "not yet
developed his overwhelming or
chestral genius. The two pianos,
then served as satisfactory or
chestration. Also, the work Is
considerably shorter than his
later operas and does not con
tain as many complicated leit
motifs.
The first act was the weakest
of the performance. The major
drawback of the whole produc
tion was the stilted and wooden
acting, which was most acute
during the first act.
Daland, played by Anthony
Cuevas, sang such quips as
"What amazement!" with the
gusto of one of Cassius Clay's
opponents in the tenth round.
As the act and the opera pro
gressed, he gained assurance
and poise and gave ever more
convincing portrayals of a fa
ther trying to arrange the mar
riage of his daughter to a hand
some suitor.
Along with stage poise, he
gained a more solid confidence
in his voice and although
throughout the performance
he had difficulty with higher
notes, It never cracked as it
did once during the first act.

The Dutchman enters after
Daland's scene wtih his sailors
and the steersman, a bold, mas
culine part played unconvincing
ly by Ray Kidder, largely due
to his somewhat raspy voice
which lacked the authority de
manded by the role.
George Baker, as the Dutch
man, seemed unsure at first but
gradually acquired the presence
and verve needed to bring the
part across effectively. The high
light of the act was the closing
scene between the Dutchman
and Daland during which they
sang an inspiring duet, against
the backdrop of their two ships,
about Daland's Senta and how
they will each profit from the
impending marriage.
The second act was exception
ally well done. Senta, imagina
tively played by Edith Zitelli,
was introduced during the open
ing spinning scene amidst a
chorus of colorfully-costumed
Norwegian maidens.
She sang what is known as
"Senta's Song," which is about
the Dutchman's imminent arri
val, effectively, using her power
ful, yet mellow soprano voice to
its fullest extent. 3
Senta's nurse, played by the
round, buxom Jane Hopper,
sang her small role commend
ably and punctuated the scene
delightfully with sharp, quick
movements and gesticulations.
Senta seemed to Inspire the
rest of the cast, for after her
introduction the production be
came progressively better.
Notably, the scene between
Senta and the Dutchman was
musically and dramatically su

perior to anything preceding it
during the op°ra. The Dutch
man, though somewhat over
shadowed by Senta's power and
tonality, acted and sang well the
part of a man 'ailing in love.
The situation was complicated
by Erik, Senta's childhood boy
friend played by Aivars Osis. He
gave a mediocre rendition of an
infuriated lover and although he
tended to bellow and became a
bit hoarse, he came across as
the peasant-type huntsman that
Wagner envisaged.
The most impressive facet of
the third act was the relative
ease with which the chorus of
maidens and sailors sang. The
chorus of sailors had previously
sung not as a unit, but as ten
individual men.
In closing the act, they pulled
together and brought the opera
to a credible conclusion. The
Dutchman, doubting Senta's vow
of eternal love sailed off only
to sink while the impassioned
Senta jumps into the sea.
A word should be said about
the engaging sets, and espe
cially the use of the scrim,
onto which was colorfully pro
jected the Dutchman's ship.
Costumes, too, were realistic
and generally appropriate.
Mention should also be made
concerning Henry Holt and Ruth
Spector who played the pianos.
Sometimes the sweet, dulcet
theme associated with Senta was
played with the vivacity of the
gale theme, but the demanding
job was admirably accomplished.
And to all at the West Bay,
hefty congratulations for a suc
cessful performance.
