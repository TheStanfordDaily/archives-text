# Frosh Burns Meal Ticket
## 
### 
A Branner freshman burned
his meal ticket at dinner last
night as a protest against the
food service.
James Perloff stood up and
burned his ticket after being
served a dish containing what
he described as "sick looking
imitation French stew."
Another Branner freshman,
Doug Heuser, announced over
the dining room's public ad
dress system that Perloff was
burning his ticket "because of
the crummy food.
Perloff said that the main
complaint of the students eat
ing at Branner is "insufficient
quantity." He claimed that stu
dents in Stern, Wilbur, and
Florence Moore are all fed more.
