## ACT's' Under Milkwood' Hailed As 'Monumental' 
### PETER JAN VAN NIEL 
The American Conservatory
Theatre's production of Dylan
Thomas' Under Milkwood is one
of the best productions in the
ACT repertoire. It is a shame
It will not be kept in the reper
toire for the season's duration.
This prose poem of a day in
a Welsh village presents par
ticular problems to the director,
the most basic of which is the
fact that primary attention must
be accorded to the words them
selves.
The poetry of the play, the
words, arouse constant asso
ciations, and define both the
poetic movements and the
meaningful structure given
the poem by the poet Listen
to the "scene painting" which
Informs us sensorlly and Ima
ginatively:
The sunny slow lulling after
noon yawns
and moons through the dozy
town. The
sea lolls, laps, and idles in,
with fishes
sleeping in its lap
Not only are the words evoca
tive, but the patterns which they
form function dynamically to
reveal and define the action of
the work. The action of the play
rises to the daydream of Cap
tain Cat — here all the images
of darkness, night, sea, dreams,
and voyage are fused, and one
Is aware that the patterns
which emerge in connecting
these words together, through
out the play help to qualify and
identify the central action.
Within the dream occurs most
basically a kind of reversal: the
Milkwood "day" — incomplete
because of a general lack of
creative union, filled with the
sort of grotesque energy which
causes Mrs. Ogmore-Pritchard's
double-widowing (or motivates
Mr. Pugh to dream of different
ways to poison his wife), indic

atively missing a strong father
figure (the cruelty of the chil
dren stems from, in one sense,
the absence of patriarchal au
thority) — is exchanged for the
night, for the dream world.
In his dream Captain Cat can
find completeness with the dead
Rosie Probert, his one true love.
Indeed, after the daydream of
Cat, at which time Rosie drifts
away, the play moves toward
the night, wher.e the blind Cap
tain can "see" in the darkness,
in the "voyage of his tears"
as he "sails to see the dead."
Completeness is attained only
in the imagination, or in dreams,
or finally, in death.
The movements of the poem
define the rising and falling
action of the play, and the
production must realize these
movements; moreover, the dlf
erence between the reality of
the Milkwood day and the im
aginative night must be care
fully developed and projected.
Mr. Ball has accomplished ex
actly this type of realization.
The production relies on the
qualities of the spoken word to
evoke the mood, and connote the
complexity of the Milkwood day
and dream worlds. The stage is
bare; the platforms are arrang
ed in a V-form, the mouth of it
inviting you into the world of
Milkwood, into the minds of the
characters.
The costumes are basic — a
couple of scarves suggest the
Welsh fisherman, a jacket, a
print dress, a grey shirt all let
you focus on the words. Atten
tion has been paid to exactly
what is going on in the play,
and nothing is to detract from
what the words have to tell us.
The various movements in the
poetry are carefully punctuated
by the physical movement of the
actors, or by music, or by the
narrative build. The narrative,
spoken by the First and Second

Voices, becomes more and more
intense as a scene builds in ten
sion: as MyFwanny Price and
Mog Edwards rush together, the
narration grows faster and fast
er, until they rush by each oth
er and clasp their arms around
themselves — at that moment a
sardonic and humorous line cap
sules the whole cooperating ver
bal and physical build.
The end of a particular build
is thus defined, and you are
ready for the next scene. Polly
holds a baby while she sings
a song of her one true love,
Willy Feazel (who Is dead) —
the script calls for Polly to be
scrubbing floors while she
sings, but by giving Polly a
baby to hold, Mr. Ball height
ens the Imaginative father
hood of Willy to all of Polly's
Illegitimate children, though
he Is the father of none.
We are then reminded of the
lack in Milkwood and the fulfill
ment which is possible in the
imagination. Willy functions in
Polly's imagination as a hus
band and father of her children;
Rose Probert functions to give
Cat similar completeness in his
dreams, as a love for all eter
nity.
Each vignette builds Into the
next like a series of steps, until
the recognition scene (the day
dream) is reached. I felt in the
production that the tremendous
neurological tension which has
accrued (one build to a scene cli
max after another, more and
more energy held in check, point
ing toward the recognition
scene) was not realized as in
tensely as it might have been.
Captain Cat's crying as Rosie
drifts away and ho wakes up in
the cry of all mankind, for a
very basic need, love.
Barry Kraft as the Reverend
Eli Jenkins has developed a fine
character role, though at times
I had real difficulty in under
standing him; Gil Turner plays
Captain Cat very well; Michael
Learned is a tender Polly Gar
ter; the First and Second Voices
are extremely exocative (Robert
Gerringer and Mark Bramhall).
What appealed to me the most,
however, was the fine ensemble
playing. The result is a point
ed. well-integrated, meaningful
production that deals with the
core, the life-force, of Under
Milkwood.
The last performance will be
given this Thursday, February
22, at the Geary — matinee at
two o'clock only. See it if you
can as the production is a mon
ument in repertory theater.
