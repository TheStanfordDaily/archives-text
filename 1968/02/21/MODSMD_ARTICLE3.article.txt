# Smith Plans Appeal Of Judiciary Ruling
## 
### 
Dean of Students Joel Smith
said yesterday he will appeal the
student Judicial Council's "not
guilty" finding in the case of
nine students charged with ille
gally demonstrating against the
Central Intelligence Agency.
Smith said he will file a notice
of appeal today with the all-fac
ulty Interim Judicial Body
(IJB), set up by the University
to hear appeals from the Judi
cial Council.
The Council had declared the
University policy on campus
demonstrations is "vague and
overbroad," "unenforceable" and
in violation of the First amend
ment.
Since the Council said it could
not enforce the University's
demonstrations policy, Smith

said he would take all such cases
in the future directly to the IJB.
In a statement yesterday,
Smith said, "This assumption by
the council of law-making
powers emphasizes . . . that the
judicial system at Stanford is
unworkable."
He added, "However that sit
uation is remedied, it must be
clear that we cannot allow the
Council's action to result in a
suspension of law on this cam
pus."
The case arose following a
demonstration Nov. 1 against
CIA recruiting in Encina Hall.
Originally, ten students were
charged, but one has since grad
uated. More than 50 persons had
taken part in the demonstra
tion.
