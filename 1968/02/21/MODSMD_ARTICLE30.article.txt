# Sets Gymnasium Record
## WSU Tops Tribe, Harris Hits 37 
### DAVE NOLAND 
(Pullman, Wash.) One of these
days, the Stanford basketball
team is going to play some rea
sonable basketball in the first
half, and maybe beat somebody.
Monday was not one of those
days. The Tribe put on an amaz
ing display of first-half inepti
tude and lost very convincingly
to somebody, namely the Wash
ington State Cougars, by the
score of 87-75.

A magnificent 37 point effort
by Art Harris was all that saved
Stanford from total humiliation.
One WSU observer commented,
"Harris's performance was the
best we'll see around here for
quite a while." (The Cougars
host UCLA next weekend.)
WSU hit their first four
shots, the Indians missed their
first four and Stanford was
playing catchup after two
minutes.

Cheered on madly by an en
thusiastic crowd, WSU's Lenny
Allen snaked his way past Pet
ersmeyer and Kuchenbecker
twice for layups, and with just
over four minutes gone, thr»
overwhelmed visitors found
themselves behind 17-5.
A time-out helped not at all.
• Allen continued to make stum
ble-footed clods out of the Stan
ford defenders. He hit 8 of 11
in the first half, and dazzled the
crowd with two beautiful behind
the-back assists.
Inside, the Coug's 6-10 Jim
McKean hooked and tipped his
way to 16 first half points, and
gathered in 9 rebounds.
Meanwhile, Stanford was
shooting 35 per cent from the
field, throwing away rebounds,
and stepping all over each oth
er's feet. The gun mercifully
ended the first-half debacle at
47-31.
Incredibly, WSU charged out
of the dressing room and hit

their first three shots, one by
the super-slippery 5-10 Allen and
two by 6-8 Ted Wierman.
The Indians steadied, how
ever, and riding Harris's supple
shoulders, they traded WSU bas
ket for basket for the next
twelve minutes.
Then, with about eight min
utes left, Griffin started to hit,
and the Tribe reeled off nine
straight points. But it was simp
ly too little too late.
Stanford was a totally dif
ferent team in the last ten
minutes, outscoring WSU 29-
13, and closing the gap to 84-
75 with 30 seconds left But the
Boston Celtics couldn't have
made up a 31 point deficit on
WSU in eighteen minutes.
Allen finished with 21, and
McKean quietly poured in 31,
including 13 for, 17 from the
free throw line.
Griffin led the Tribe's ane
mic supporting cast with 13.
Two of the starters, Petersmey
er and Kuchenbecker failed to
score a single field goal.
The Tribe's Pac-8 record is
now a dismal 2-6. A third win

against patsy Oregon this week
end is entirely possible, but un
less Harris starts getting some
help, this dismal season can be
come nothing but more dismal.


RECORD BREAKER —Art Harris muscles his way to two points
against Washington. Harris used inside shots like this, long jump

37 points Monday night, breaking the all-time Bolder Gym single
game scoring record. All was In vain, however, as WSU rolled over
the Tribe 87-75.

RECORD BREAKER —Art Harris muscles his way to two points
against Washington. Harris used inside shots like this, long jump
ers, short jumpers, and a good eye from the foul line to rack up
37 points Monday night, breaking the all-time Bolder Gym single
game scoring record. All was In vain, however, as WSU rolled over
the Tribe 87-75.
(Pullman, Wash.) One of these
days, the Stanford basketball
team is going to play some rea
sonable basketball in the first
half, and maybe beat somebody.
Monday was not one of those
days. The Tribe put on an amaz
ing display of first-half inepti
tude and lost very convincingly
to somebody, namely the Wash
ington State Cougars, by the
score of 87-75.

A magnificent 37 point effort
by Art Harris was all that saved
Stanford from total humiliation.
One WSU observer commented,
"Harris's performance was the
best we'll see around here for
quite a while." (The Cougars
host UCLA next weekend.)
WSU hit their first four
shots, the Indians missed their
first four and Stanford was
playing catchup after two
minutes.

Cheered on madly by an en
thusiastic crowd, WSU's Lenny
Allen snaked his way past Pet
ersmeyer and Kuchenbecker
twice for layups, and with just
over four minutes gone, thr»
overwhelmed visitors found
themselves behind 17-5.
A time-out helped not at all.
• Allen continued to make stum
ble-footed clods out of the Stan
ford defenders. He hit 8 of 11
in the first half, and dazzled the
crowd with two beautiful behind
the-back assists.
Inside, the Coug's 6-10 Jim
McKean hooked and tipped his
way to 16 first half points, and
gathered in 9 rebounds.
Meanwhile, Stanford was
shooting 35 per cent from the
field, throwing away rebounds,
and stepping all over each oth
er's feet. The gun mercifully
ended the first-half debacle at
47-31.
Incredibly, WSU charged out

The Indians steadied, how
ever, and riding Harris's supple
shoulders, they traded WSU bas
ket for basket for the next
twelve minutes.
Then, with about eight min
utes left, Griffin started to hit,
and the Tribe reeled off nine
straight points. But it was simp
ly too little too late.
Stanford was a totally dif
ferent team in the last ten
minutes, outscoring WSU 29-
13, and closing the gap to 84-
75 with 30 seconds left But the
Boston Celtics couldn't have
made up a 31 point deficit on
WSU in eighteen minutes.
Allen finished with 21, and
McKean quietly poured in 31,
including 13 for, 17 from the
free throw line.
Griffin led the Tribe's ane
mic supporting cast with 13.
Two of the starters, Petersmey
er and Kuchenbecker failed to
score a single field goal.
The Tribe's Pac-8 record is
now a dismal 2-6. A third win

against patsy Oregon this week
end is entirely possible, but un
less Harris starts getting some
help, this dismal season can be
come nothing but more dismal.


RECORD BREAKER —Art Harris muscles his way to two points
against Washington. Harris used inside shots like this, long jump
ers, short jumpers, and a good eye from the foul line to rack up
37 points Monday night, breaking the all-time Bolder Gym single
game scoring record. All was In vain, however, as WSU rolled over
the Tribe 87-75.
(Pullman, Wash.) One of these
days, the Stanford basketball
team is going to play some rea
sonable basketball in the first
half, and maybe beat somebody.
Monday was not one of those
days. The Tribe put on an amaz
ing display of first-half inepti
tude and lost very convincingly
to somebody, namely the Wash
ington State Cougars, by the
score of 87-75.

A magnificent 37 point effort
by Art Harris was all that saved
Stanford from total humiliation.
One WSU observer commented,
"Harris's performance was the
best we'll see around here for
quite a while." (The Cougars
host UCLA next weekend.)
WSU hit their first four
shots, the Indians missed their
first four and Stanford was
playing catchup after two
minutes.

Cheered on madly by an en
thusiastic crowd, WSU's Lenny
Allen snaked his way past Pet
ersmeyer and Kuchenbecker
twice for layups, and with just
over four minutes gone, thr»
overwhelmed visitors found
themselves behind 17-5.
A time-out helped not at all.
• Allen continued to make stum
ble-footed clods out of the Stan
ford defenders. He hit 8 of 11
in the first half, and dazzled the
crowd with two beautiful behind
the-back assists.
Inside, the Coug's 6-10 Jim
McKean hooked and tipped his
way to 16 first half points, and
gathered in 9 rebounds.
Meanwhile, Stanford was
shooting 35 per cent from the
field, throwing away rebounds,
and stepping all over each oth
er's feet. The gun mercifully
ended the first-half debacle at
47-31.
Incredibly, WSU charged out
of the dressing room and hit
