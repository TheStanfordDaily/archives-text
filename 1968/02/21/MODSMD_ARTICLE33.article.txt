# West Germany Called Steady Despite Right-Wing Influence
## 
### 
Despite the rise of right-wing
nationalists, West Germany is
doing a "steady, dependable,
clearsighted job" of building a
democracy, Dr. Eleanor Lansing
Dulles told the Stanford Faculty
Women's Club Monday.
A senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution, Dr. Dulles is
the sister of John Foster Dulles,
the late Secretary of State, and
Allen Dulles, former director of
the Central Intelligence Agen
cy.
Author of "Berlin: The Wall
Is Not Forever," she studied
problems of post-war Ger
many from 1952 to 1962 with
the U.S. State Department,

then visited East Germany
last summer and West Ger
many last month as a private
citizen.
Neither the East nor West ex
pects German reunification "in
the foreseeable future," she told
an audience of 130 in Tresidder
Memorial Union. However hi
two, "possibly three" decades,
"the whole situation will
change" with the gradual unifi
cation of Europe. "Only in that
context is it reasonable to ex
pect reunification" of Germany,
she said.
West Germany is now the
strongest nation in Europe eco
nomically, including Britain,
and "we need her as a partner,"
Dr. Dulles emphasized. West
Germany is in the vanguard of
European integration and unifi
cation and "will do the most for
us" in meeting the current in
ternational financial crisis.
West Germany "probably will
buy $250 to $300 million in U.S.
government bonds," she said.
Already the West Germans have
a "gentleman's agreement" with
the U.S. not to add to the cur
rent drain on the gold reserves.
"Germany wants our troops
and will finance most or all of
their expense," she added. While
West Germany has "a tremen
dous desire to be Independent
of America," its leaders recog
nize the value of cooperation and
partnership with the U.S.
Recent gains by the right
wing National Demokratische
Parte! Deutschlands (NPD) do
not mark a "revival of Na
zism," she said. "Don't let it
upset you if they gain in the
next election."
The NPD probably represents
eight to 15 per cent of the West
German population, but lacks a
positive program. It is "very

amateurish . . . not very clever,"
she added.
Dr. Dulles predicted that the
Christian Democratic and Social
Democratic Parties, the coali
tion now in power, will continue
with "a very uneasy partner
ship" until next year at least.
"The socialist wing of this
coalition can't develop any very
leftist program. There is no
room for it. That's one reason
some young people go (over) to
the NPD," she said.
In her eight-day private trip
to East Germany she reported,
"we were followed everywhere"
by government agents. In pri
vate talks with 40 individuals,
she found:
• East Germany "doesn't want
a head-on clash" with the church,
but seeks to erode religious life
through indirect persecution;
• Heavy industrial production
is "extremely active," while pro
duction of optical instruments
and lighter goods is going "fair
ly well;"
• Consumer goods are "rough,
unattractive, and extremely ex
pensive," while apartments are
"terrible."
Overall, East Germany's
production is about 60 per
cent of its prewar total. Its
people are "extremely cynical
in attitude," feeling that the
Free World is 'living fat and
comfortable," not caring about
them. Youths reared In the
rubble of World War II "now
see things as better," and are
less critical.
Dr. Dulles strongly endorsed
the current West German policy
of increased diplomatic contact
with the satellite countries of
Eastern Europe, which contrib
utes to East Germany's isola
tion.

A senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution, Dr. Dulles is
the sister of John Foster Dulles,
the late Secretary of State, and
Allen Dulles, former director of
the Central Intelligence Agen
cy.
Author of "Berlin: The Wall
Is Not Forever," she studied
problems of post-war Ger
many from 1952 to 1962 with
the U.S. State Department,

then visited East Germany
last summer and West Ger
many last month as a private
citizen.
Neither the East nor West ex
pects German reunification "in
the foreseeable future," she told
an audience of 130 in Tresidder
Memorial Union. However hi
two, "possibly three" decades,
"the whole situation will
change" with the gradual unifi
cation of Europe. "Only in that
context is it reasonable to ex
pect reunification" of Germany,
she said.
West Germany is now the
strongest nation in Europe eco
nomically, including Britain,
and "we need her as a partner,"
Dr. Dulles emphasized. West
Germany is in the vanguard of
European integration and unifi
cation and "will do the most for
us" in meeting the current in
ternational financial crisis.
West Germany "probably will
buy $250 to $300 million in U.S.
government bonds," she said.
Already the West Germans have
a "gentleman's agreement" with
the U.S. not to add to the cur
rent drain on the gold reserves.
"Germany wants our troops
and will finance most or all of
their expense," she added. While
West Germany has "a tremen
dous desire to be Independent
of America," its leaders recog
nize the value of cooperation and
partnership with the U.S.
Recent gains by the right
wing National Demokratische
Parte! Deutschlands (NPD) do
not mark a "revival of Na
zism," she said. "Don't let it
upset you if they gain in the
next election."
The NPD probably represents
eight to 15 per cent of the West
German population, but lacks a
positive program. It is "very

amateurish . . . not very clever,"
she added.
Dr. Dulles predicted that the
Christian Democratic and Social
Democratic Parties, the coali
tion now in power, will continue
with "a very uneasy partner
ship" until next year at least.
"The socialist wing of this
coalition can't develop any very
leftist program. There is no
room for it. That's one reason
some young people go (over) to
the NPD," she said.
In her eight-day private trip
to East Germany she reported,
"we were followed everywhere"
by government agents. In pri
vate talks with 40 individuals,
she found:
• East Germany "doesn't want
a head-on clash" with the church,
but seeks to erode religious life
through indirect persecution;
• Heavy industrial production
is "extremely active," while pro
duction of optical instruments
and lighter goods is going "fair
ly well;"
• Consumer goods are "rough,
unattractive, and extremely ex
pensive," while apartments are
"terrible."
Overall, East Germany's
production is about 60 per
cent of its prewar total. Its
people are "extremely cynical
in attitude," feeling that the
Free World is 'living fat and
comfortable," not caring about
them. Youths reared In the
rubble of World War II "now
see things as better," and are
less critical.
Dr. Dulles strongly endorsed
the current West German policy
of increased diplomatic contact
with the satellite countries of
Eastern Europe, which contrib
utes to East Germany's isola
tion.
Despite the rise of right-wing
nationalists, West Germany is
doing a "steady, dependable,
clearsighted job" of building a
democracy, Dr. Eleanor Lansing
Dulles told the Stanford Faculty
