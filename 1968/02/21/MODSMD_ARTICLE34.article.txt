## 
### 
Lloyd McFarlane, Vice-Consul
of the Canadian Consulate Gen
eral, and Fred Norman, Officer
in-Charge of the Canadian Immi
gration Service in San Francis
co, will be on campus today
from 4:30 to about 8:30 p.m.
McFarlane will speak on "Can
ada's Foreign Policy Regarding
Vietnam" in Tresidder 270-271,
at 4:30 p.m., and will be fol
lowed by Norman speaking on
"Professional Opportunities in
Canada â€” Emmigration and
Draft-dodgers."
There will be plenty of time
for questions following the for
mal presentations. Both speak
ers will be outlining their coun
try's official views on the Viet
nam war and on emigration to
Canada by young Americans,
who might, among other things,
be seeking escape from the U.S.
draft laws.

Following the speeches and
questions, at 7:00 in the lounge
of Otero house, there will be in
formal discussion by these two
men of the topics brought out in
their speeches and by the ques
tions.
Although the 4:30 meeting
will cover very thoroughly the
ins and outs of emigration to
Canada, job-finding, living con
ditions, professional possibili
ties, and so forth, it is expected
that, more personal views of
these two Canadian representa
tives will come out in the Otero
discussions.
The Canadian officials are
sponsored by the lIR and are the
first consular representatives to
participate in a series of infor
mal foreign policy discussions
which will continue throughout
this and spring quarters.
