# Guilty Even If Innocent
## 
### 
PROVO, Utah (CPS) â€” When
a student at Brigham Young
University is arrested on a nar
cotics charge, he is automatical
ly suspended from the univer
sity, before his case even gets
to court.
If he is found not guilty of
the charge in court, that's his
tough luck. He should never
have been arrested.
Dean of Students J. Elliot
Cameron says arrests are not
made without cause. "There
must be evidence," he says.
Brigham Young University ac
cepts the "evidence" leading to
the arrest of a student as suffi
cient proof of guilt for suspen
sion.
