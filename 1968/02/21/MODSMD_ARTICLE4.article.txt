# Lyman Blasts Draft
## 
### 
Stanford Provost Richard W.
Lyman called the Johnson Ad
ministration's withdrawal of
graduate draft deferments "a
catastrophe" on a CBS televi
sion news program last night.
"It represents a swing from
one extreme to another," he
said in a taped interview on the
Walter Cronkite news program.
The draft policy, reaffirmed
Friday by the National Security
Council, abolishes student defer
ments for all graduating seniors
and first year graduate students
except for those in medicine and
allied fields.
As many as 150,000 of these
men could be inducted next
year, according to government
estimates, ten times last year's
amount.

Lyman said "all we're asking
for is a fair shake—a random
selection among the men aged
19 to 26." This plan was rejected
by the Administration.
Statements by Lyman were
juxtaposed during the program
with conflicting remarks by Se
lective Service Director General
Lewis B. Hershey. Hershey's
statements were taped separate
ly.
"This is going to do terrible
damage to the emergence of
trained manpower in this coun
try," Lyman said.
CBS quoted Stanford officials
as estimating that 85 per cent of
next year's first and second year
law students here could be in
ducted.
