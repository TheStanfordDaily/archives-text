# Arbuckle Claims Draft Will Hurt Biz School
## 
### THOMAS DAWSON 
The Graduate School of Busi
ness may lose half of its second
year students as a result of the
new draft policy, according to
Ernest Arbuckle, dean of the
school.
Speaking to the Stanford
Mothers' Club yesterday after
noon, Arbuckle said the Stan
ford Business School was in a
better condition than most oth
er business schools. He said that
slightly more than half of the
business students have either
discharged their military obliga
tion or are overage for the draft.
Of this year's first year
class of 275, more than 125
will be liable for induction un
der the new guidelines.
Arbuckle's speech, entitled
"Graduate Business at Stan
ford," dealt mainly with the role
of business in the future, and
the position of young people in
business and government.
Calling this "the age of the
young people," Arbuckle predict
ed that "capable young people
will be given more responsibility
faster in the few years."
He pointed out that in two years
more than half the people in th">
United States will be under 25
years of age.
He also said that the labor

force would increase by 33 per
cent in the next ten years while
the over age 45 work force, in
which most upper-management
personnel are found, will remain
constant.
It is inevitable, Arbuckle said,
that young people will take up
the slack.
Responding to criticism that
today's business school grad
uates are overpaid, Arbuckle
said that the $$11,400 median
starting salary last year's
business grads received may,
at first glance, seem high.
He pointed out, however, that
today's students are trained in
skills that did not even exist ten
or fifteen years ago. Further
more, Arbuckle continued, the
business firms are giving the
new employees responsibilities
commensurate with their pay.
He said that this was an econo
mic necessity as a firm cannot
afford to pay high salaries with
out getting something in return.
One further reason Arbuckle
advanced for the high salaries
given by the corporations was
the increased competition from
government. said that many
government jobs appealed
strongly to the increased social
awareness of today's business
students.
Arbuckle said that returning

Peace Corps volunteers provid
ed some of the "most outstand
ing students" in the school.
Addressing himself to the role
of business in society, Arbuckle
said, "If free enterprise is to
remain, the corporation must in
volve itself in the problems of
the society," rather than just
"profit maximization."
He cited the need for busi
ness to solve the problems of
air and water polution "be
fore the federal government
steps in and does It."
The tasks of government and
corporations are becoming inter
mingled, Arbuckle noted. The
many-faceted roles of multi-na
tional corporations was given as
an example of such intermingl
ing.
Arbuckle concluded his talk
by emphasizing the need for
continuing education, saying,
"No man with 15 years until re
tirement can expect to live on
his present intellectual capital.
He'll lose the race between ob
solescence and retirement." He
cited the extensive "middle man
agement" program at business
school as an example of this con
tinuing education.
In this program businessmen
return to school for refresher
courses to bring them up to date
in management techniques.

class of 275, more than 125
will be liable for induction un
der the new guidelines.
Arbuckle's speech, entitled
"Graduate Business at Stan
ford," dealt mainly with the role
of business in the future, and
the position of young people in
business and government.
Calling this "the age of the
young people," Arbuckle predict
ed that "capable young people
will be given more responsibility
faster in the few years."
He pointed out that in two years
more than half the people in th">
United States will be under 25
years of age.
He also said that the labor

force would increase by 33 per
cent in the next ten years while
the over age 45 work force, in
which most upper-management
personnel are found, will remain
constant.
It is inevitable, Arbuckle said,
that young people will take up
the slack.
Responding to criticism that
today's business school grad
uates are overpaid, Arbuckle
said that the $$11,400 median
starting salary last year's
business grads received may,
at first glance, seem high.
He pointed out, however, that
today's students are trained in
skills that did not even exist ten
or fifteen years ago. Further
more, Arbuckle continued, the
business firms are giving the
new employees responsibilities
commensurate with their pay.
He said that this was an econo
mic necessity as a firm cannot
afford to pay high salaries with
out getting something in return.
One further reason Arbuckle
advanced for the high salaries
given by the corporations was
the increased competition from
government. said that many
government jobs appealed
strongly to the increased social
awareness of today's business
students.
Arbuckle said that returning

Peace Corps volunteers provid
ed some of the "most outstand
ing students" in the school.
Addressing himself to the role
of business in society, Arbuckle
said, "If free enterprise is to
remain, the corporation must in
volve itself in the problems of
the society," rather than just
"profit maximization."
He cited the need for busi
ness to solve the problems of
air and water polution "be
fore the federal government
steps in and does It."
The tasks of government and
corporations are becoming inter
mingled, Arbuckle noted. The
many-faceted roles of multi-na
tional corporations was given as
an example of such intermingl
ing.
Arbuckle concluded his talk
by emphasizing the need for
continuing education, saying,
"No man with 15 years until re
tirement can expect to live on
his present intellectual capital.
He'll lose the race between ob
solescence and retirement." He
cited the extensive "middle man
agement" program at business
school as an example of this con
tinuing education.
In this program businessmen
return to school for refresher
courses to bring them up to date
in management techniques.
The Graduate School of Busi
ness may lose half of its second
year students as a result of the
new draft policy, according to
Ernest Arbuckle, dean of the
school.
Speaking to the Stanford
Mothers' Club yesterday after
noon, Arbuckle said the Stan
ford Business School was in a
better condition than most oth
er business schools. He said that
slightly more than half of the
business students have either
discharged their military obliga
tion or are overage for the draft.
Of this year's first year
class of 275, more than 125
will be liable for induction un
