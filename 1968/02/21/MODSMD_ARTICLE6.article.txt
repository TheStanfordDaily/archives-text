# Anti-War Protest
## Guerilla Theater At ROTC Parade 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Martha Raye it wasn't.
But then, entertaining our
boys in uniform wasn't exactly
the purpose of forty anti-war
demonstrators who staged a bit
of guerrilla theater yesterday
while 235 ROTC cadets stood in
ranks for inspection on the soc
cer field.
They may have succeeded any
way. As one cadet put it,"It
was a lot better than standing
around doing nothing."
While a lieutenant colonel
from Sixth Army headquarters
scrutinized one cadet after an
other, demonstrators dressed in
motley uniforms fought with
others dressed in dark outfits
and coolie hats.
One, wearing a Lyndon John
son mask, tried coaxing others

to fight the Vietcong, without
success. Other characters repre
sented a scientist, a housewife,
businessmen and other assorted
stereotypes.
The group began by marching
from the ASSU loft in Tresidder
Union to White Plaza, where a
number of spectators had
already gathered. There, the
LBJ figure, with a wind-up key
sticking from his back, was
wound up to push the "soldiers"
in front of him.
LBJ and some of the others
tried to get the soldiers to fight
some Viet Cong, but the soldiers
ran away. So did the housewife,
the scientist and the others.
Then the group began march
ing down to the soccer field, fol
lowing the drum beat of David
Ransom, editor of the Midpenin
sula Observer. Along the way,
Viet Cong snipers harassed the
group from among the columns
along the outer edge of the
Quad.
The ROTC cadets had not yet
formed ranks when the group
reached the soccer field, but
soon they grouped in for

mation as if nothing unusual
were happening.
Death, dressed in a flowing
black cloak, his face covered,
paced up and down the ranks.
At one point, the demonstrat
ors formed in ranks among the
cadets, but they moved back
when asked by Associate Dean
of Students Willard Wyman.
Later they moved to the other
side of the field, where the
cadets could see them.
Forr Santa Clara county sher
iff's deputies stood by, out of
sight behind a large hedge.
Three unmarked student police
were on the scene a 1 so, but no
disturbances occurred.
A large American flag, with
a dollar sign instead of 50 stars
on the field of blue, was carried
—and periodically captured by
th" boqus Viet Cong.
Finally, the demonstrators
marrhed away from the field,
chanting "Bring the boys home"
and "Keep the boys home."
One bystanding Army major
jokingly said he was glad the
inspecting officer was a lieuten
ant colonel, because the ROTC

commander whose troops he
was inspecting is a full colonel
and thus outranks him.
The cadets represented not

only Stanford but also De Anza,
Foothill and San Mateo col
leges, which use Stanford's
ROTC facilities.

About forty demonstrators pantomimed mock battles and scenes
of alleged moral crises which America faces.

was a lot better than standing
around doing nothing."
While a lieutenant colonel
from Sixth Army headquarters
scrutinized one cadet after an
other, demonstrators dressed in
motley uniforms fought with
others dressed in dark outfits
and coolie hats.
One, wearing a Lyndon John
son mask, tried coaxing others

to fight the Vietcong, without
success. Other characters repre
sented a scientist, a housewife,
businessmen and other assorted
stereotypes.
The group began by marching
from the ASSU loft in Tresidder
Union to White Plaza, where a
number of spectators had
already gathered. There, the
LBJ figure, with a wind-up key
sticking from his back, was
wound up to push the "soldiers"
in front of him.
LBJ and some of the others
tried to get the soldiers to fight
some Viet Cong, but the soldiers
ran away. So did the housewife,
the scientist and the others.
Then the group began march
ing down to the soccer field, fol
lowing the drum beat of David
Ransom, editor of the Midpenin
sula Observer. Along the way,
Viet Cong snipers harassed the
group from among the columns
along the outer edge of the
Quad.
The ROTC cadets had not yet
formed ranks when the group
reached the soccer field, but
soon they grouped in for

mation as if nothing unusual
were happening.
Death, dressed in a flowing
black cloak, his face covered,
paced up and down the ranks.
At one point, the demonstrat
ors formed in ranks among the
cadets, but they moved back
when asked by Associate Dean
of Students Willard Wyman.
Later they moved to the other
side of the field, where the
cadets could see them.

Three unmarked student police
were on the scene a 1 so, but no
disturbances occurred.
A large American flag, with
a dollar sign instead of 50 stars
on the field of blue, was carried
—and periodically captured by

Finally, the demonstrators
marrhed away from the field,
chanting "Bring the boys home"
and "Keep the boys home."
One bystanding Army major
jokingly said he was glad the
inspecting officer was a lieuten

commander whose troops he
was inspecting is a full colonel
and thus outranks him.
The cadets represented not

Foothill and San Mateo col

ROTC facilities.

About forty demonstrators pantomimed mock battles and scenes
