## V.C. Vows: Destroy Saigon 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — The Com
munist high command, thwarted
in efforts in its opening offen
sive to seize Saigon, is reported
to have called for leveling of
South Vietnam's capital in sec
ond wave attacks before the
month is out.
Rumors raced through Saigon
of an impending Viet Cong as
sault in the early morning hours
Wednesday as artillery bar
rages and air strikes rumbled in
outlying areas. Flares lighted
the sky and explosions could be
heard clearly in the heart of the
city.
Private sources said they
heard that up to two battalions
of Viet Cong—perhaps 800 men
—were in action west of the
city.
Saigon police and allied troops
were already on full alert for
developments in the second
wave, which dwindled after its
opening with rocket and mortar
attacks on 47 centers and a few
ground assaults across the coun
try Sunday.
In ground action, American
infantrymen caught up with a
band of Viet Cong storming
through Saigon's northeastern
suburbs Tuesday and killed 123
in a blazing, four-hour battle.
And northwest of the capital,
government rangers said they
killed 32 guerrillas in a gun bat
tle near, the Phu Tho cemetery.
The fighting was coupled with
a light rocket attack on Tan
Son Nhut air base.
• McNamara Testifies
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sec

retary of nse Robert S. Mc-
Namara said today the United
States has intelligence reports
of a "highly classified and un
impeachable nature" establish
ing without question North Viet
namese naval attacks on two
U.S. destroyers in August 1964.
McNamara's statement came
in testimony before the Senat"
Foreign Relations Committee
investigating circumstances of
the Gulf of Tonkin incident that
marked a turning point in the
Vietnam war.
McNamara did not specify
what the intelligence informa
tion was.
McNamara revealed for the
first time that both destroyers
had been conducting patrols de
signed to gather intelligence in
formation, among other things.
At no time did either violate
North Vietnam's three-mile ter
ritorial waters, he said.
The defense chief also dis
closed the United States re
ceived advance word of the at
tacks Aug. 2 and Aug. 4, 1964
from intelligence sources.
• Rights Bill Blocked
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate refused by seven votes
Tuesday to invoke a time limit
on debate so that a civil rights
bill could be brought to a vote.
Backers of the measure called
the outcome "a significant vic
tory," however, and said they
are within shooting distance of
their goal.
Senate Democratic Leader
Mike Mansfield of Montana
moved for a test vote Wednes
day on an open housing section,
and announced he will try again

next Monday to bring the basic
bill to a showdown.
In Tuesday's test, supporters
of the bill were able to muster
only 55 votes, or 7 short of the
two-thirds majority needed to
invoke cloture.
Arrayed against the debate
closing rules were 37 senators,
mainly Southern Democrats and
Republican conservatives.
The setback for civil rights
forces came in the face of an
appeal by President Johnson for
passage of the bill and a tele
gram from Gov. George Romney
urging all Republican senators
to vote for cloture.
The legislation, which has held
the Senate in listless debate
since Congress reconvened Jan.
15, is designed to protect Ne
groes and civil rights workers
against racial violence.
The housing amendment that
will be voted on Wednesday
would outlaw any discrimination
in the sale or rental of housing.
• Pearson In Trouble
OTTAWA (AP) — Prime Min
ister Lester B. Pearson said
Tuesday night he will seek a
confidence vote Wednesday to
try to reverse a major parlia
mentary upset suffered by his
Liberal government while he
was on a Caribbean holiday.
Returning to Ottawa on Tues
day, Pearson announced the
government will bring a motion
to the House of Commons to es
tablish "without doubt" whether
it has the confidence of Parlia
ment.
The prime minister met with
his Cabinet and Liberal mem
bers of Parliament who were

called urgently back to Ottawa.
Forty-seven of them had been
absent Monday night when a
government income tax sur
charge bill was voted down 84-82
by the House.
The bill's defeat was consid
ered an expression of nonconfl
dence in the government—a sit
uation that requires it to resign
or win an immediate pledge of
faith in Commons.
• Looters To Be Shot
HUE, Vietnam (AP) — The
South Vietnamese military chief
of war-devastated Hue ordered
today that looters be shot on
sight and announced there
would be public executions with
in two days of some Communist
agents arrested recently.
Lt. Col. Pham Van Khoa, who
heads the government machin
ery of Thua Thien Province and
Hue, its capital, issued the or
ders even as the battle raged on
for control of the walled Citadel,
which makes up most of the

American officials in Hue ex
pressed approval.
Khoa said Communist agents
to die were those guilty of as
sassinations or involvement in
the Viet Cong plot to wrest the
city from the government.
