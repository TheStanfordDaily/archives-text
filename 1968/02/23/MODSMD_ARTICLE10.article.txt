# INTRODUCING SEIJI OZAWA

THE END of the last move
ment of Tschaikovsky's
Fourth Symphony: an almost
inaudible warlike cry, and then,
poised, the baton fell silently, swift
ly, accurately — like a Samurai
Sword—and it was over.
Upstairs the press joked: "One
day that final karate chop of his
will wind up just a little too close
to concert master Jacob Krachmal
nick, and—well, right through him
—violin and all." Seiji Ozawa had
finished with his first full rehearsal
of the San Francisco Symphony
this season.
This dynamic and popular young
maestro will inherit the "throne" of
the San Francisco Symphony two
seasons from now. Early last week
Josef Krips, the distinguished con
ductor and music director of the
Orchestra, confirmed his retirement
from that post at the end of the
1969-1970 concert season. Immedi
ately thereafter, Philip S. Boone,
president of the San Francisco Sym
phony Association, announced the
appointment of the young Japanese
conductor, Seiji Ozawa, as Krips'
successor.
Maestro Krips, who has discussed
his eventual retirement on several
occasions since 1966, stated: "It is
my wish to retire as Music Director
of the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra at the conclusion of the
1969-1970 season; it was also my
wish that Mr. Seiji Ozawa should
succeed me as Music Director. He
is the man of the future, who will
continue my work to achieve the
highest artistic goals possible for
the San Francisco Symphony."
Krips, 65, concluded: "I shall look
forward to returning to San Fran
cisco often to work with the Orches
tra as its Conductor Emeritus."
In gaining Ozawa, the San Fran
cisco Symphony will become the
first major American orchestra in
history with a Japanese music direc
tor. This brilliant and affable maes
tro has had great successes with
major orchestras throughout the
world; his previous performances in
San Francisco have been hailed by
both critics and audiences and have
sold out the Opera House.
Krips' "man of the future" is pres

Symphony Orchestra and the Ra
