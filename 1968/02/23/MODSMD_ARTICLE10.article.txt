# INTRODUCING SEIJI OZAWA
## 
### richard n. Atkins 
THE END of the last move
ment of Tschaikovsky's
Fourth Symphony: an almost
inaudible warlike cry, and then,
poised, the baton fell silently, swift
ly, accurately — like a Samurai
Sword—and it was over.
Upstairs the press joked: "One
day that final karate chop of his
will wind up just a little too close
to concert master Jacob Krachmal
nick, and—well, right through him
—violin and all." Seiji Ozawa had
finished with his first full rehearsal
of the San Francisco Symphony
this season.
This dynamic and popular young
maestro will inherit the "throne" of
the San Francisco Symphony two
seasons from now. Early last week
Josef Krips, the distinguished con
ductor and music director of the
Orchestra, confirmed his retirement
from that post at the end of the
1969-1970 concert season. Immedi
ately thereafter, Philip S. Boone,
president of the San Francisco Sym
phony Association, announced the
appointment of the young Japanese
conductor, Seiji Ozawa, as Krips'
successor.
Maestro Krips, who has discussed
his eventual retirement on several
occasions since 1966, stated: "It is
my wish to retire as Music Director
of the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra at the conclusion of the
1969-1970 season; it was also my
wish that Mr. Seiji Ozawa should
succeed me as Music Director. He
is the man of the future, who will
continue my work to achieve the
highest artistic goals possible for
the San Francisco Symphony."
Krips, 65, concluded: "I shall look
forward to returning to San Fran
cisco often to work with the Orches
tra as its Conductor Emeritus."
In gaining Ozawa, the San Fran
cisco Symphony will become the
first major American orchestra in
history with a Japanese music direc
tor. This brilliant and affable maes
tro has had great successes with
major orchestras throughout the
world; his previous performances in
San Francisco have been hailed by
both critics and audiences and have
sold out the Opera House.

was born in Hoten, Japan, on Sep
tember 1, 1935. He is a graduate of
the Toho School of Music in Tokyo
where he won first prizes in compo
sition and conducting. He has con
ducted various orchestras in Japan,
including the Japan Radio Orches
tra and the Japan Philharmonic.
Before leaving Japan for Europe
in January of 1959, he was chosen
by the Radio Orchestra and the
music magazine, Friends of Music,
as the outstanding talent of the
year. That same year he was the re
cipient of the First Prize at the In
ternational Competition of Orches
tral Conductors at Besan9on, and in
1960, he received the Koussevitsky
Memorial Scholarship as the most
outstanding among the young com
posers of the Berkshire Music Cen
ter.
Last year, Mr. Ozawa guest-con
ducted the Philadelphia Orchestra
in concerts in Philadelphia, Wash
ington, Baltimore and New York
City. After his New York concert
the New York Times' music critic
Harold Schonberg said that his per
formance was "a testimony to the
flair of a conductor destined for
greatness."

DESTINY does as it will; Seiji
Ozawa arrived in San Fran
cisco two weeks ago and
The Daily was on hand to greet
him. Wearing a fleecelined suede
overcoat and a six-button double
breasted blue blazer, Ozawa was
guided to the American Airlines In
ternational Lounge where the press
was permitted a brief interview.
Ozawa noted his concern for the re
cent labor troubles with the Sym
phony, and added the following
comment in his soft - spoken man
ner: "You know, that trouble (la
bor-management disputes) has be
come so popular in this country." It
merited a laugh from his audience.
I asked him if he planned to con
tinue with the Stanford Concerts:
"I know your tradition for making
good music. I hope to come to Stan
ford University often."
After Ozawa ran the Orchestra
through its paces on Saturday, se
lected members of the press were
invited to a luncheon in the maes
tro's honor. There were about 20
people present, radio and publish
ing and non - publishing newspa
pers, including a delegate from the
Toronto Press. But it was The Stan
ford Daily which wound up with
the seat of honor next to the young
conductor.
Ozawa chatted freely. An avid
opera fan, I couldn't resist asking
him if he planned to conduct many
operas during the interim period
between leaving Toronto and as
suming his duties in San Francisco.
"Yes," he replied, "I like it too.
Hopefully I will conduct in Europe.
I would like to conduct in Berlin."
We talked at length about young
musicians; Maestro Ozawa asked
about Stanford's Music Depart
ment. I told him although I had no
first-hand experience, we were re

sponsible for helping to launch Jess
Thomas' career, the now world-fa
famous Wagnerian tenor. This
pleased Ozawa greatly. "Ah, it must
be quite good," he concluded.
One of the most sought-after con
ductors today, Ozawa has received
the following commendation from
the New York Philharmonic's Leon
ard Bernstein: "Seiji is a genius, and
I don't throw that word around
lightly." He was named one of the
New York Philharmonic's assistant
conductors in March of 1961; his
appointment extending throughout
that season included many sub
scription concerts and one of the
now famous Young People's Con
certs.
During the Philharmonic's tour
of Japan in April 1961, he directed
Mayuzumi's Baccanale at the
East-West Music Encounter. This
performance was videotaped and
shown later that season as one of the
New York Philharmonic's television
programs. In the summer of 1961,
he conducted 25 concerts in Tokyo
and Osaka with his old Japan Radio
Orchestra and Japan Philharmonic,
including three concerts at the Con
temporary Music Festival in Osaka
and three at the Twentieth Century
Music Festival in Tokyo.
Ozawa's formal European con
ducting debut took place in the
winter of 1965 with the Lamoureux
Orchestra; he received one of the
most enthusiastic ovations ever
awarded a conductor at his debut.
Since that time he has guest-con
ducted such major European or
chestras as the London Symphony
and the Vienna Symphony, in addi
tion to guest appearances at the
Salzburg Festival, the Berlin Festi
val, the Besan9on Festival, and in
concerts with La Scala in Milan.
His engagements in the United
States include appearances with the
Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chi
cago Symphony, the San Francisco
Symphony, the Detroit Symphony,
the Pittsburgh Symphony and the
Minneapolis Symphony, as well as
his work in New York. In addition
he has guest conducted at the Tan
glewood Festival (summer home of
the Boston Symphony) and at the
Hollywood Bowl.
When he began to talk about his
plans for the San Francisco Sym
phony, I asked Ozawa what he
planned to achieve for the orches
tra. He replied: "This is very much
like a marriage." The conductor can
learn a lot from his orchestra, and,
in turn, hopes that he can teach
them something and accomplish
something outstanding for them.
What can Ozawa accomplish?
The two new semi-circular build
ings making up Toronto's City Hall
complex were the site of one of
Ozawa's concerts with his present
symphony. As the orchestra played
from one building, the sound
echoed and reverberated from the
other, an innovation in the world of
music, even if somewhat peculiar.
Says British-born Stanford student
lan Arnold, presently from Toronto,
who witnessed this event:"lt was
just that—outstanding."

planned to achieve for the orches
tra. He replied: "This is very much
like a marriage." The conductor can
learn a lot from his orchestra, and,
in turn, hopes that he can teach
them something and accomplish
something outstanding for them.
What can Ozawa accomplish?
The two new semi-circular build
ings making up Toronto's City Hall
complex were the site of one of
Ozawa's concerts with his present
symphony. As the orchestra played
from one building, the sound
echoed and reverberated from the
other, an innovation in the world of
music, even if somewhat peculiar.
Says British-born Stanford student
lan Arnold, presently from Toronto,
who witnessed this event:"lt was
just that—outstanding."
THE END of the last move
ment of Tschaikovsky's
Fourth Symphony: an almost
inaudible warlike cry, and then,
poised, the baton fell silently, swift
ly, accurately — like a Samurai
Sword—and it was over.
Upstairs the press joked: "One
day that final karate chop of his
will wind up just a little too close
to concert master Jacob Krachmal
nick, and—well, right through him
—violin and all." Seiji Ozawa had
finished with his first full rehearsal
of the San Francisco Symphony
this season.
This dynamic and popular young
maestro will inherit the "throne" of
the San Francisco Symphony two
seasons from now. Early last week
Josef Krips, the distinguished con
ductor and music director of the
Orchestra, confirmed his retirement
from that post at the end of the
1969-1970 concert season. Immedi
ately thereafter, Philip S. Boone,
president of the San Francisco Sym
phony Association, announced the
appointment of the young Japanese
conductor, Seiji Ozawa, as Krips'
successor.
Maestro Krips, who has discussed
his eventual retirement on several
occasions since 1966, stated: "It is
my wish to retire as Music Director
of the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra at the conclusion of the
1969-1970 season; it was also my
wish that Mr. Seiji Ozawa should
succeed me as Music Director. He
is the man of the future, who will
continue my work to achieve the
highest artistic goals possible for
the San Francisco Symphony."
Krips, 65, concluded: "I shall look
forward to returning to San Fran
cisco often to work with the Orches
tra as its Conductor Emeritus."
In gaining Ozawa, the San Fran
cisco Symphony will become the
first major American orchestra in
history with a Japanese music direc
tor. This brilliant and affable maes
tro has had great successes with
major orchestras throughout the
world; his previous performances in
San Francisco have been hailed by
both critics and audiences and have
sold out the Opera House.

where he won first prizes in compo

Before leaving Japan for Europe
in January of 1959, he was chosen

Ozawa arrived in San Fran
cisco two weeks ago and
The Daily was on hand to greet
him. Wearing a fleecelined suede
overcoat and a six-button double
breasted blue blazer, Ozawa was
guided to the American Airlines In
ternational Lounge where the press
was permitted a brief interview.
Ozawa noted his concern for the re
cent labor troubles with the Sym
phony, and added the following
comment in his soft - spoken man
ner: "You know, that trouble (la
bor-management disputes) has be
come so popular in this country." It
merited a laugh from his audience.
I asked him if he planned to con
tinue with the Stanford Concerts:
"I know your tradition for making
good music. I hope to come to Stan
ford University often."
After Ozawa ran the Orchestra
through its paces on Saturday, se
lected members of the press were
invited to a luncheon in the maes
tro's honor. There were about 20
people present, radio and publish
ing and non - publishing newspa
pers, including a delegate from the
Toronto Press. But it was The Stan
ford Daily which wound up with
the seat of honor next to the young
conductor.
Ozawa chatted freely. An avid
opera fan, I couldn't resist asking
him if he planned to conduct many
operas during the interim period
between leaving Toronto and as
suming his duties in San Francisco.
"Yes," he replied, "I like it too.
Hopefully I will conduct in Europe.
I would like to conduct in Berlin."
We talked at length about young
musicians; Maestro Ozawa asked
about Stanford's Music Depart
ment. I told him although I had no
first-hand experience, we were re

sponsible for helping to launch Jess
Thomas' career, the now world-fa
famous Wagnerian tenor. This
pleased Ozawa greatly. "Ah, it must
be quite good," he concluded.
One of the most sought-after con
ductors today, Ozawa has received
the following commendation from
the New York Philharmonic's Leon
ard Bernstein: "Seiji is a genius, and
I don't throw that word around
lightly." He was named one of the
New York Philharmonic's assistant
conductors in March of 1961; his
appointment extending throughout
that season included many sub
scription concerts and one of the
now famous Young People's Con
certs.
During the Philharmonic's tour
of Japan in April 1961, he directed
Mayuzumi's Baccanale at the
East-West Music Encounter. This
performance was videotaped and
shown later that season as one of the
New York Philharmonic's television
programs. In the summer of 1961,
he conducted 25 concerts in Tokyo
and Osaka with his old Japan Radio
Orchestra and Japan Philharmonic,
including three concerts at the Con
temporary Music Festival in Osaka
and three at the Twentieth Century
Music Festival in Tokyo.
Ozawa's formal European con
ducting debut took place in the
winter of 1965 with the Lamoureux
Orchestra; he received one of the
most enthusiastic ovations ever
awarded a conductor at his debut.
Since that time he has guest-con
ducted such major European or
chestras as the London Symphony
and the Vienna Symphony, in addi
tion to guest appearances at the
Salzburg Festival, the Berlin Festi
val, the Besan9on Festival, and in
concerts with La Scala in Milan.
His engagements in the United
States include appearances with the
Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chi
cago Symphony, the San Francisco
Symphony, the Detroit Symphony,
the Pittsburgh Symphony and the
Minneapolis Symphony, as well as
his work in New York. In addition
he has guest conducted at the Tan
glewood Festival (summer home of
the Boston Symphony) and at the
Hollywood Bowl.

awarded a conductor at his debut.
Since that time he has guest-con
ducted such major European or
chestras as the London Symphony
and the Vienna Symphony, in addi
tion to guest appearances at the
Salzburg Festival, the Berlin Festi

concerts with La Scala in Milan.
His engagements in the United
States include appearances with the
Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chi

Symphony, the Detroit Symphony,
the Pittsburgh Symphony and the
Minneapolis Symphony, as well as
his work in New York. In addition
he has guest conducted at the Tan
glewood Festival (summer home of
the Boston Symphony) and at the
Hollywood Bowl.
When he began to talk about his
plans for the San Francisco Sym
phony, I asked Ozawa what he
planned to achieve for the orches
tra. He replied: "This is very much
like a marriage." The conductor can
learn a lot from his orchestra, and,
in turn, hopes that he can teach
them something and accomplish
something outstanding for them.
What can Ozawa accomplish?
The two new semi-circular build
ings making up Toronto's City Hall
complex were the site of one of
Ozawa's concerts with his present
symphony. As the orchestra played
from one building, the sound
echoed and reverberated from the
other, an innovation in the world of
music, even if somewhat peculiar.
Says British-born Stanford student
lan Arnold, presently from Toronto,
who witnessed this event:"lt was
just that—outstanding."
THE END of the last move
ment of Tschaikovsky's
Fourth Symphony: an almost
inaudible warlike cry, and then,
poised, the baton fell silently, swift
ly, accurately — like a Samurai
Sword—and it was over.
Upstairs the press joked: "One
day that final karate chop of his
will wind up just a little too close
to concert master Jacob Krachmal
nick, and—well, right through him
—violin and all." Seiji Ozawa had
finished with his first full rehearsal
of the San Francisco Symphony
this season.
This dynamic and popular young
maestro will inherit the "throne" of
the San Francisco Symphony two
seasons from now. Early last week
Josef Krips, the distinguished con
ductor and music director of the
Orchestra, confirmed his retirement
from that post at the end of the
1969-1970 concert season. Immedi
ately thereafter, Philip S. Boone,
president of the San Francisco Sym
phony Association, announced the
appointment of the young Japanese
conductor, Seiji Ozawa, as Krips'
successor.
Maestro Krips, who has discussed
his eventual retirement on several
occasions since 1966, stated: "It is
my wish to retire as Music Director
of the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra at the conclusion of the
1969-1970 season; it was also my
wish that Mr. Seiji Ozawa should
succeed me as Music Director. He
is the man of the future, who will
continue my work to achieve the
highest artistic goals possible for
the San Francisco Symphony."
Krips, 65, concluded: "I shall look
forward to returning to San Fran
cisco often to work with the Orches
tra as its Conductor Emeritus."
In gaining Ozawa, the San Fran
cisco Symphony will become the
first major American orchestra in
history with a Japanese music direc
tor. This brilliant and affable maes
tro has had great successes with
major orchestras throughout the
world; his previous performances in
San Francisco have been hailed by
both critics and audiences and have
sold out the Opera House.

Before leaving Japan for Europe

Ozawa arrived in San Fran

The Daily was on hand to greet
him. Wearing a fleecelined suede
overcoat and a six-button double
breasted blue blazer, Ozawa was
guided to the American Airlines In
ternational Lounge where the press
was permitted a brief interview.
Ozawa noted his concern for the re
cent labor troubles with the Sym
phony, and added the following
comment in his soft - spoken man
ner: "You know, that trouble (la
bor-management disputes) has be
come so popular in this country." It
merited a laugh from his audience.
I asked him if he planned to con
tinue with the Stanford Concerts:
"I know your tradition for making
good music. I hope to come to Stan
ford University often."
After Ozawa ran the Orchestra
through its paces on Saturday, se
lected members of the press were
invited to a luncheon in the maes
tro's honor. There were about 20
people present, radio and publish
ing and non - publishing newspa
pers, including a delegate from the
Toronto Press. But it was The Stan
ford Daily which wound up with
the seat of honor next to the young
conductor.
Ozawa chatted freely. An avid
opera fan, I couldn't resist asking
him if he planned to conduct many
operas during the interim period
between leaving Toronto and as
suming his duties in San Francisco.
"Yes," he replied, "I like it too.
Hopefully I will conduct in Europe.
I would like to conduct in Berlin."
We talked at length about young
musicians; Maestro Ozawa asked
about Stanford's Music Depart
ment. I told him although I had no
first-hand experience, we were re

sponsible for helping to launch Jess
Thomas' career, the now world-fa
famous Wagnerian tenor. This
pleased Ozawa greatly. "Ah, it must
be quite good," he concluded.
One of the most sought-after con
ductors today, Ozawa has received
the following commendation from
the New York Philharmonic's Leon
ard Bernstein: "Seiji is a genius, and
I don't throw that word around
lightly." He was named one of the
New York Philharmonic's assistant
conductors in March of 1961; his
appointment extending throughout
that season included many sub
scription concerts and one of the
now famous Young People's Con
certs.
During the Philharmonic's tour
of Japan in April 1961, he directed
Mayuzumi's Baccanale at the
East-West Music Encounter. This
performance was videotaped and
shown later that season as one of the
New York Philharmonic's television
programs. In the summer of 1961,
he conducted 25 concerts in Tokyo
and Osaka with his old Japan Radio
Orchestra and Japan Philharmonic,
including three concerts at the Con
temporary Music Festival in Osaka
and three at the Twentieth Century
Music Festival in Tokyo.
Ozawa's formal European con
ducting debut took place in the
winter of 1965 with the Lamoureux
Orchestra; he received one of the
most enthusiastic ovations ever
awarded a conductor at his debut.
Since that time he has guest-con

During the Philharmonic's tour
of Japan in April 1961, he directed
Mayuzumi's Baccanale at the
East-West Music Encounter. This
performance was videotaped and
shown later that season as one of the
New York Philharmonic's television
programs. In the summer of 1961,
he conducted 25 concerts in Tokyo
and Osaka with his old Japan Radio
Orchestra and Japan Philharmonic,
including three concerts at the Con
temporary Music Festival in Osaka
and three at the Twentieth Century
Music Festival in Tokyo.
Ozawa's formal European con
ducting debut took place in the
winter of 1965 with the Lamoureux
Orchestra; he received one of the
most enthusiastic ovations ever
awarded a conductor at his debut.
Since that time he has guest-con
ducted such major European or
chestras as the London Symphony
and the Vienna Symphony, in addi
tion to guest appearances at the
Salzburg Festival, the Berlin Festi
val, the Besan9on Festival, and in
concerts with La Scala in Milan.
His engagements in the United
States include appearances with the
Philadelphia Orchestra, the Chi
cago Symphony, the San Francisco
Symphony, the Detroit Symphony,
the Pittsburgh Symphony and the
Minneapolis Symphony, as well as
his work in New York. In addition
he has guest conducted at the Tan
glewood Festival (summer home of
the Boston Symphony) and at the
Hollywood Bowl.
When he began to talk about his
plans for the San Francisco Sym
phony, I asked Ozawa what he
planned to achieve for the orches
tra. He replied: "This is very much
like a marriage." The conductor can
learn a lot from his orchestra, and,
in turn, hopes that he can teach
them something and accomplish
something outstanding for them.
What can Ozawa accomplish?
The two new semi-circular build
ings making up Toronto's City Hall
complex were the site of one of
Ozawa's concerts with his present
symphony. As the orchestra played
from one building, the sound
echoed and reverberated from the
other, an innovation in the world of
music, even if somewhat peculiar.
Says British-born Stanford student
lan Arnold, presently from Toronto,
who witnessed this event:"lt was
just that—outstanding."
THE END of the last move
ment of Tschaikovsky's
Fourth Symphony: an almost
inaudible warlike cry, and then,
poised, the baton fell silently, swift
ly, accurately — like a Samurai
Sword—and it was over.
Upstairs the press joked: "One
day that final karate chop of his
will wind up just a little too close
to concert master Jacob Krachmal
nick, and—well, right through him
—violin and all." Seiji Ozawa had
finished with his first full rehearsal
of the San Francisco Symphony
this season.
This dynamic and popular young
maestro will inherit the "throne" of
the San Francisco Symphony two
seasons from now. Early last week
Josef Krips, the distinguished con
ductor and music director of the
Orchestra, confirmed his retirement
from that post at the end of the
1969-1970 concert season. Immedi
ately thereafter, Philip S. Boone,
president of the San Francisco Sym
phony Association, announced the
appointment of the young Japanese
conductor, Seiji Ozawa, as Krips'
successor.
Maestro Krips, who has discussed
his eventual retirement on several
occasions since 1966, stated: "It is
my wish to retire as Music Director
of the San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra at the conclusion of the
1969-1970 season; it was also my
wish that Mr. Seiji Ozawa should
succeed me as Music Director. He
is the man of the future, who will
continue my work to achieve the
highest artistic goals possible for
the San Francisco Symphony."
Krips, 65, concluded: "I shall look
forward to returning to San Fran
cisco often to work with the Orches
tra as its Conductor Emeritus."
In gaining Ozawa, the San Fran
cisco Symphony will become the
first major American orchestra in
history with a Japanese music direc
tor. This brilliant and affable maes
tro has had great successes with
major orchestras throughout the
world; his previous performances in
San Francisco have been hailed by
both critics and audiences and have
sold out the Opera House.

was born in Hoten, Japan, on Sep
tember 1, 1935. He is a graduate of
the Toho School of Music in Tokyo
where he won first prizes in compo
sition and conducting. He has con
ducted various orchestras in Japan,
including the Japan Radio Orches
tra and the Japan Philharmonic.
Before leaving Japan for Europe
in January of 1959, he was chosen
by the Radio Orchestra and the
music magazine, Friends of Music,
as the outstanding talent of the
year. That same year he was the re
cipient of the First Prize at the In
ternational Competition of Orches
tral Conductors at Besan9on, and in
1960, he received the Koussevitsky
Memorial Scholarship as the most
outstanding among the young com
posers of the Berkshire Music Cen
ter.
Last year, Mr. Ozawa guest-con
ducted the Philadelphia Orchestra
in concerts in Philadelphia, Wash
ington, Baltimore and New York
City. After his New York concert
the New York Times' music critic
Harold Schonberg said that his per
formance was "a testimony to the
flair of a conductor destined for
greatness."

DESTINY does as it will; Seiji
Ozawa arrived in San Fran
cisco two weeks ago and
The Daily was on hand to greet
him. Wearing a fleecelined suede
overcoat and a six-button double
breasted blue blazer, Ozawa was
guided to the American Airlines In
ternational Lounge where the press
was permitted a brief interview.
Ozawa noted his concern for the re
cent labor troubles with the Sym
phony, and added the following
comment in his soft - spoken man
ner: "You know, that trouble (la
bor-management disputes) has be
come so popular in this country." It
merited a laugh from his audience.
I asked him if he planned to con
tinue with the Stanford Concerts:
"I know your tradition for making
good music. I hope to come to Stan
ford University often."
After Ozawa ran the Orchestra
through its paces on Saturday, se
lected members of the press were
invited to a luncheon in the maes
tro's honor. There were about 20
people present, radio and publish
ing and non - publishing newspa
pers, including a delegate from the
Toronto Press. But it was The Stan
ford Daily which wound up with
the seat of honor next to the young
conductor.
Ozawa chatted freely. An avid
opera fan, I couldn't resist asking
him if he planned to conduct many
operas during the interim period
between leaving Toronto and as
suming his duties in San Francisco.
"Yes," he replied, "I like it too.
Hopefully I will conduct in Europe.
I would like to conduct in Berlin."
We talked at length about young
musicians; Maestro Ozawa asked
about Stanford's Music Depart
ment. I told him although I had no
first-hand experience, we were re

sponsible for helping to launch Jess
Thomas' career, the now world-fa
famous Wagnerian tenor. This
pleased Ozawa greatly. "Ah, it must
be quite good," he concluded.
One of the most sought-after con
ductors today, Ozawa has received
the following commendation from
the New York Philharmonic's Leon
ard Bernstein: "Seiji is a genius, and
I don't throw that word around
lightly." He was named one of the
New York Philharmonic's assistant
conductors in March of 1961; his
appointment extending throughout
that season included many sub
scription concerts and one of the
now famous Young People's Con
certs.
During the Philharmonic's tour
