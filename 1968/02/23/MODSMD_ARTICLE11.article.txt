# Ramblin' Jack rare artist

### 
Good contemporary music is a synthesis
of several elements. A performer may
have significant instrumental skill, may
possess a rich or expressive voice, and may
have a distinctive personality which is evi
dent in his performances. Few artists are
blessed with all these talents. Even fewer are
able to evidence them on record because of
the rarefied conditions of the recording studio.
Ramblin' Jack Elliott is one of the truly
great performers who have seemingly limit
less ability and creativity and can communi
cate with a listener whether in live concerv
or through a record album. His latest release
on Reprise, Young Brigham, is a light-hearted,
brilliantly produced encapsulation of the hu
mor, feeling, and simplicity which have be
come his trademarks.
Elliott named the album for his horse, who
shares the cover with him. Outwardly the rec
ord has the appearance of a collection of cow
boy songs, and indeed, several selections are
twangy vestiges of the Old West. But Elliott,
a native of Brooklyn, merely uses this theme
to humorous and artistic advantage, retain
ing a wide range of musical moods. There is
talking blues, folk song, Guthrie and Dylan.
All are done superbly and uniquely.
The instrumentation on the album is han
dled by producer Bruce Langhome, who fore
goes his normal guitar chores in deference to
Elliott and three others, including Mark Spoel
stra, a fine singer and songwriter in his own
right. As usual, Langhorne's arrangements are
tasteful and well-balanced, with Elliott's own
lead guitar work quite excellent.
While Elliotts voice can hardly be called
lyric or even particularly good by most stan

dards, it is almost perfectly suited to his in
terpretation and style. Bob Dylan was so im
pressed when he heard Elliott sing "Don't
Think Twice, It's Alright", one of the cuts on
Young Brigham, that he publicly turned over
performing rights for the song to Elliott, say
ing at the time that he had never heard it
sung better by anyone, including himself.
Elliott's personality is the key to his great
ness as an artist. His honesty and earthiness
speak directly to anyone who half-tries to lis
ten. The loneliness or happiness or excitement
that one of his songs or stories can convey
frequently moves entire audiences. Two of
the selections on Young Brigham, Tim Har
din's "If I Were a Carpenter" and Elliott's
"912 Greens" have an emotional sense about
them which the most expressive words are
inadequate to describe. His version of Mick
Jagger's "Connection' 'is remarkable for its
funny yet wistful treatment, and Woody
Guthrie's bedtime song for his son, "Good
night, Little Arlo", comes ecstatically to life
with the whole instrumental ensemble joining
Elliott on the choruses.
Young Brigham is an unforgettable blend
of the three important elements in contempor
ary music. Langhorne and Elliott have seen to
instrumentation, Elliott has turned the poten
tial handicap of his voice into an outstanding
asset, and the beauty of Elliott's warmth and
humanity has given the product of a large re
cording studio an almost unreal dimension of
presence and immediacy. The year is young,
like Brigham, but this album named after a
horse will surely number among this year's
finest and one of the best of anytime. Listen
to it; laugh, cry, and feel good all over.
