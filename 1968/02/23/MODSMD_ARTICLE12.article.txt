# 'Our Town'—any town U.S.A.— gives illusion of universality
## 
### 
If you haven't read Our Town by Thornton
Wilder, the title might lead you to expect a
sleepy little drama about the typical birth,
marriage and death intrigues of an intimate
community where everyone keeps tabs on
everyone else. But the surprise of ACTs pro
duction is the effect of these seemingly mun
dane activities on the audience.
The narrator walks onto the bare stage and
begins creating in words the scenery of the
town, drawing the audience deeper and deep
er into the story until the Webb and the
Gibbs families are introduced and we watch
the mothers call the children to breakfast, re
living our own childhood mornings.
Next thing you know, Emily Webb (the
smartest girl in the history of Grovers Corners
High School) is helping George G bbs with
his algebra one night when the moon shines
into both their windows "something terrible."
And so the first act, Birth is followed by Mar
riage, and finally the third act Death, ends
the play but does not finish it off.
Our Town is given a continuity by the tra
dition of its people. They don't go in much
for culture but they like to watch the seasons
change. Mrs. Gibbs keeps asking Dr. Gibbs to
take her on a vacation because he is working
too hard. There is nothing very remarkable
about Our Town except that each interchange
is so familiar that we are drawn to identify
with the timelessness of the characters' prob
lems and their solutions. Though we may have
different solutions today, the play gives the
illusion of universality. The characters are as
familiar as our own families or the families on
TV.
That people were meant to live two by two
is an example of town philosophy which re
flects the completeness of this little universe.
Because of the success of the actors who have
injected the right spirit into the play, you
leave the play with a vaguely good feeling.
Good because you were sure you knew what
the people were saying and doing; good be
cause you are seeing an image of life renew
ing itself on stage, not the hopelessly isolated

man of Samuel Beckett, not man diseased and
sick. If man was alone in Our Town it was
just until his family returned home; if man
was sick the Doctor would cure him. If a man
died he was buried in his family's graveyard
where he belonged next to the rest of his an
cestors. Good because you recognized your
self.
Our Town had an order and a unity which
let one view it as an outsider, detached and
yet feeling you belonged right in it, or at least
that a part of you did.
Before the performance, ACTs general di
rector William Ball walked on stage and an
nounced: "Without newspapers, theaters can
die. Be our newspaper. Bemind the Bay Area
that we are performing six days a week in two
theaters."
