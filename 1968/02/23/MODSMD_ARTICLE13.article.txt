# 'Tell Me Lies' choppy portrait of protest and frustration
## 
### 
Tell Me Lies, directed by Peter Brook, is
perhaps one of the strongest attempts to con
front us with the horror of Vietnam. The film
is frustrating to both the actors and the audi
ence, for it is trying to represent the futility
of individual action, and it does so almost too
successfully.
The film is the story of Mark, a young man
living in London, who suddenly becomes
aware of the horror facing the civilians in
Vietnam. Mark, in his desire to initiate action,
draws several of his friends together and they
try to become "concerned" by marching and
protesting. However Mark finds himself being
led in a circle, and at the end of the film he
realizes that he has been able to do nothing;
and worse, he has come to see the falseness
in the desire which is guiding him.
At the conclusion of the movie, a young
eirl, Clenda Jackson, who has inspired Mark
throughout, reveals her true feelings of frus
tration and selfishness.
Brook has done much more than show
futility on the screen. For Tell Me Lies is not
a slick Hollywood type production. The film
is choppy and it is difficult for the viewer to
become involved with the story, and yet one
can sense the intense feelings of the actors and
their desire to make a statement, quite sim
i'o»- Mark's desire to do something.
The audience must stop and think about
what it had seen, and carefully place all the
pieces together. When this is accomplished
one realizes the extent of Brook's movie. Not
only with Vietnam, which is the focus of the
movie, but in all problems involving nations
man is in a position of helplessness. There
exist avenues of protest, but they lead no
where. Mark realizes how the wills of a few
mon are the determining forces of his life. The
feelings of a member of government can de
termine whether one will live or die.
The film ends with Mark facing ultimate
frustration. For he is sitting in the same chair
looking at the same picture that started him
on his quest. Only the desire to find an answer
has increased, yet will it lead to this same
end?
Brooks has included several rather inter
esting comments by such leading power fig
ures as Stokely Carmichael, and several repre
sentatives of established government. For this
film is not related only to Vietnam, though it
is a very powerful indictment of our present

policy, but to man surrounded by a world of
violence which he cannot cope with or com
prehend.
Tell Me Lies presents the viewer with an
interesting combination of documentary and
fiction. Within the fictionalized world of Mark,
the viewer is presented with documentary
accounts of the actions of protestors from all
over the world, including the self-immolations
of a monk in Saigon, and Norman Morrison in
front of the Pentagon.
Peter Brook has made Tell Me Lies so
superficially blunt in its basic concept and
strong in its language, while retaining a sub
tlety of thought that transcends Vietnam, that
one cannot avoid being struck by the film.
There is no immediate catharsis but rather a
slow assimilation of the film as one puts it
together in his own mind, and realizes the
connotations of Brook's statement. Behind a
facade of amateurness and poor technique
Brook has made a film that depicts a problem
of man living in modern society, and then
places the unsuspecting viewer in the same
predicament.
Tell Me Lies is currently being shown at
the Clay Theatre, in S.F., Filmore and Clay
Street, evenings at 6, 8, and 10.
