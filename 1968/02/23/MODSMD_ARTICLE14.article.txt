# 'Chusingura': powerful retelling of Japanese revenge epic
## 
### 
"With the slayer of his father a man may
not live under the same heaven; against
the slayer of his brother a man must never
have to go home to fetch a weapon; with
the slayer of his friend a man may not live
in the same State."
—Second Book of le Ke
The above Confucian doctrine, explicitly de
manding revenge, and the Samurai Code of
eighteenth century Japan which embodies this
dictum provide the essential dramatic force
which moves Hiroshi Inagaki's monumental
movie Chushingura, the cinematic retelling of
the Japanese epic of Samurai revenge.
The story of Chushingura is as much a part
of the Japanese national heritage as the Ar
thurian legends are a part of English heritage.
The magnificence of the film is not restricted
to its content, however. It also provides a form
suited to the epic qualities of the plot.
The genesis of the story comcs when Lord
Asano, a country noble of low official rank, is
required to receive the emissaries of the Sho
gun. In order to do this properly, he must re
ceive instruction in court etiquette from the
corrupt but powerful Lord Kira. Lord Asano is
courageous and honorable. Tn contrast. Lord
Kira is thoroughly despicable, a man who dis
honors himself and the regime by his overpow
ering lust for money and women.
Lord Asano refuses to bribe Lord Kira in
return for the necessary instruction in proce
dure; therefore, Lord Kira humiliates Lord
Asano again and again. Finally Lord Asano can
no longer honorably accept this treatment and
attempts to kill Lord Kira. For this rash act,
Lord Asano must commit scpptiku (hara kiri).
When the news of Lord Asano's death
reaches Chamberlain Oishi at the Asano castle,
he summons all the vassals most loyal to his
late lord and exacts a blood pledge from them.
The story of their revenge is a masterpiece of
honorable loyalty. The courageous Samurai,
called the Forty-seven Ronin, must dissemble
their plans against Lord Kira. The castle is
surrendered without a fight so that Lord Kira

will believe himself safe. Chamberlain Oishi
leads a life of debauchery to convince Kira that
he is now safe from the Ronin. In choosing this
life, Oishi sacrifices his marriage. In a similar
fashion, the lives of a handful of the Forty
seven are seen as they fight their temptation
to reveal their noble plan for revenge too soon.
The epic of the Samurai revenge is given
epic cinematic expression. Chusingura is three
and one-half hours long. For one who is caught
by the artistry of the film, time is suspended
by the careful pacing of the movie as a whole.
Throughout, special carc is taken to preserve
the beauty of the setting and the depth of
human emotion. Inagaki does not allow the
story to run out of his control. Each scene, each
moment, takes on an almost ritual significance.
The ceremony of seppuku is performed in
the midst of fading cherry blossoms and there
is a moment to catch breath before the scene
shifts to a screaming Lord Kira. The ritual na
ture of the revenge is captured as the Ronin
notify Lord Kira's neighbors that they are at
tacking him. This symbolic motif is present
throughout, impressing one with the solemnity
and beauty of the film.
Performances of individual actors must be
especially praised. Chusha Ichikawa plays the
daemon, Lord Kira, with masterful fidelity. It
is possible to believe that Lord Kira is totally
despicable only because of Ichikawa's atten
tion to consistent behavior.
The outstanding performance of the film is
that of Koshiro Matsumoto who plays Cham
berlain Oishi. Matsumoto brings the difficult
and demanding role to consummation by living
each moment of the film as a man who finds
himself moved by a noble ideal which is great
er than himself. Matsumoto convinces one that
honor is not a mask for Oishi but instead the
very certain principle of his life.
Chushingura is currently playing at the
Cateway Theater in San Francisco.

required to receive the emissaries of the Sho
gun. In order to do this properly, he must re
ceive instruction in court etiquette from the
corrupt but powerful Lord Kira. Lord Asano is
courageous and honorable. Tn contrast. Lord
Kira is thoroughly despicable, a man who dis
honors himself and the regime by his overpow
ering lust for money and women.
Lord Asano refuses to bribe Lord Kira in
return for the necessary instruction in proce
dure; therefore, Lord Kira humiliates Lord
Asano again and again. Finally Lord Asano can
no longer honorably accept this treatment and
attempts to kill Lord Kira. For this rash act,
Lord Asano must commit scpptiku (hara kiri).
When the news of Lord Asano's death
reaches Chamberlain Oishi at the Asano castle,
he summons all the vassals most loyal to his
late lord and exacts a blood pledge from them.
The story of their revenge is a masterpiece of
honorable loyalty. The courageous Samurai,
called the Forty-seven Ronin, must dissemble
their plans against Lord Kira. The castle is
surrendered without a fight so that Lord Kira

will believe himself safe. Chamberlain Oishi
leads a life of debauchery to convince Kira that
he is now safe from the Ronin. In choosing this
life, Oishi sacrifices his marriage. In a similar
fashion, the lives of a handful of the Forty
seven are seen as they fight their temptation
to reveal their noble plan for revenge too soon.
The epic of the Samurai revenge is given
epic cinematic expression. Chusingura is three
and one-half hours long. For one who is caught
by the artistry of the film, time is suspended
by the careful pacing of the movie as a whole.
Throughout, special carc is taken to preserve
the beauty of the setting and the depth of
human emotion. Inagaki does not allow the
story to run out of his control. Each scene, each
moment, takes on an almost ritual significance.
The ceremony of seppuku is performed in
the midst of fading cherry blossoms and there
is a moment to catch breath before the scene
shifts to a screaming Lord Kira. The ritual na
ture of the revenge is captured as the Ronin
notify Lord Kira's neighbors that they are at
tacking him. This symbolic motif is present
throughout, impressing one with the solemnity
and beauty of the film.
Performances of individual actors must be
especially praised. Chusha Ichikawa plays the
daemon, Lord Kira, with masterful fidelity. It
is possible to believe that Lord Kira is totally
despicable only because of Ichikawa's atten
tion to consistent behavior.
The outstanding performance of the film is
that of Koshiro Matsumoto who plays Cham
berlain Oishi. Matsumoto brings the difficult
and demanding role to consummation by living
each moment of the film as a man who finds
himself moved by a noble ideal which is great
er than himself. Matsumoto convinces one that
honor is not a mask for Oishi but instead the
very certain principle of his life.
Chushingura is currently playing at the
Cateway Theater in San Francisco.

The above Confucian doctrine, explicitly de
manding revenge, and the Samurai Code of
eighteenth century Japan which embodies this
dictum provide the essential dramatic force
which moves Hiroshi Inagaki's monumental
movie Chushingura, the cinematic retelling of
the Japanese epic of Samurai revenge.
The story of Chushingura is as much a part
of the Japanese national heritage as the Ar
thurian legends are a part of English heritage.
The magnificence of the film is not restricted
to its content, however. It also provides a form
suited to the epic qualities of the plot.

Asano, a country noble of low official rank, is
