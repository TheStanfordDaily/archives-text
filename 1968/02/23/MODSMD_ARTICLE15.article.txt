John Galgiani, an illustrious member of Breaker's Eating
Club, was quoted as saying in Monday's Daily that, "If you
don't like Buddy Guy, you have a hole in your soul." To those
of you that don't have holes in your souls, we recommend the
free BIG AFRO-AMERICAN THING, an all-black performing
arts happening complete with soul band and singers, Afro
dancers, a black poet, and a theatre group. It's at Hunter's
Point Rec Center Auditorium, 195 Kiska Road, starting at 7:30
tonight. On Sunday, the THING moves to Farragut School
Auditorium, 625 Holloway Avenue (in The City) beginning
at 3:30. Who needs Esalen?
There are some other appealing attractions in the area. To
night at the City's Civic Center, Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt will
guest conduct The San Francisco Symphony, featuring
Haydn't Symphony #102, Henze's Second Suite from Ondine,
and concluding with Sibelius' Symphony #1. This same pro
gram will be repeated tomorrow night at 8:15 in the gym of
Foothill College in Los Altos Hills.
The San Francisco Conservatory Artist's Ensemble concert
will take place tonight at the Conservatory, 1201 Ortega, be
ginning at 8:30. The group features new works from com
posers ranging in style from Jepson to Winsor.
ACT presents Tartuffe tonight and The Crucible tomorrow
night, both at 8:30 and at the Geary Theatre. At the same
time, at the Marines' Memorial Theatre, Charley's Aunt will
be playing tonight and Don't Shoot Mable tomorrow night,
both at 8:30.
If you didn't catch Buddy Guy down here on Wednesday,
he'll be at the Avalon tonight and tomorrow along with
Quicksilver and the Sunhouse, taking off at (you guessed it)
8:30. Meanwhile at Winterland, The Who, Cannonball Adder
ly, The Vagrants (from New York), and The Nice will board
their flight tonight and tomorrow evening at a similar time.
Two more items of interest. The first is the Russian film ver
sion of Hamlet, reputedly excellent. It's at the Surf Theatre
in the City. Tonight, there will be two performances, 7:00
and 9:40, and tomorrow three are scheduled, 4:00, 7:00, and
9:40. They say it's much better in the original Russian. In Bel
mont, at the Hillbarn Theatre (Alameda de las Pulgas and
Ralston Avenue), modern life is given a new slant in the form
of a comedy about a drop-out in a pre-historic setting. It's
called, The Boy Who Changed the World tonight and to
morrow evening at 8:30.
Again this week Stanford is blessed with a number of out
standing films. The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,
based on the short story by Alan Sillitoe, is showing at Tresid
der this Friday. This is the best film in the entire Tresidder
series, and should not be missed. Saturday TMU presents Day
of Wrath by Dreyer, both films being shown at 7:30, 8:30 and
9:30.
Two Japanese films are also being presented this weekend.
On Friday the Keio Committee continues its outstanding se
ries of films with Ugetsu (7:30 and 10:00 at Cubberley). Sat
urday SDS is showing Woman in the Dunes at Memorial Au
ditorium, no time has been given as yet.
During the following week Henry V with Laurence Olivier
will be shown at Cubberley on Tuesday and Wednesday, at
4:30 and 7:30. Also the I-Center will be presenting Renoir's
Rules of the Game, on Thursday at 8:00 at TMU.
