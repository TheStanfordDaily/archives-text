# Introduction
## The 						new determinism 
### michael 1. schwartz 
President johnson has said, "In the next thirty-five years
we must literally build a second America —putting in as
many houses, schools, apartments, parks, and offices as
we have built through all the time since the Pilgrims arrived
on these shores." Moreover, statisticians predict that between
now and the year 2000 the urban population in the United
States will more than double, constituting 75% of the national
population. How are we to meet this challenge?
Are we to respond with vast complexes of sterile highrise
apartments, with continued centralization in already over
crowded regions, and with many million more automobiles?
That is to say, will we continue to meet tomorrow's problems
with yesterday's solutions?
Furthermore, what would be the consequences of such an
expanded megalopolis on our culture and way of life? Today
the urban problems of ghettos, prejudice, crime, mediocre
education, the dissolution of the family unit, and generally
the problems of people living in close contact with one an
other make some cities intolerable. If this is the present, what
are the prospects for the future?
Eleil Saarinen, a prominent figure in modern architecture,
made a noteworthy point in his book The City. "It is essential
that the city's physical 'form-order' be developed into such a
quality as can foster culturally constructive aspirations . . . the
city's 'form-order' and 'social-order' cannot be separated;
they must be developed hand-in-hand, reciprocally, inspiring
one another."
The purpose of the following articles is to examine and dis
cuss the possible means of directing and focusing future
change in The City of The Future. The four authors in this
issue approach the subject from the perspectives of the artist,
the inventor, the engineer and the architect.
Though the topics and points of view differ somewhat in
each article, they nevertheless share a common belief in a
new determinism. Theodore Gordon referred to this idea at
Stanford last spring as, "The forming of our current work to
produce the world which we choose to make for ourselves and
the people who come after ... an outlook which says that
man has control and responsibility for his future."
