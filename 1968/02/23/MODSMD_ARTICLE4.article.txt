# Total environmental art—or:
## How to get through the future in (one) peace 
### excerpted from an article by robert friemark 
l was once sitting with Eliel Saarinen, the
old man, as he described what architecture is.
You start with the spoon, he said.
Consider the spoon: it must convey liquids
and solids; it must easily enter and retract from
the mouth. It must fit the bowl or the cup; the
edge must be able to scoop or cut, but not in
the mouth. It must balance nicely in the fin
gers, full or empty. It has these characteristics
in common with every spoon, but if it is truly
to be individual, it must remind the beholder
instantly that he has never seen a spoon like it
before. Once the spoon is perfect, we have
somewhere to begin.
The spoon must relate well to the knife and
fork. These in turn must be suited to and com
pliment the plate between them. Then there
is the matter of the saucer and cup, the bowls,
all the other dishes of the set. And then the
place mat upon which it sits, and this in rela
tion, not only to them, but to the tablecloth,
and the tablecloth to the table.
Next come the chairs, and then the other
furniture of the room, including the interior
of the room itself. Then comes the relationship
of this room to its adjoining room, until you
have bedrooms, library, parlors, halls, lavato
ries—a whole house. And then the outbuild
ings: the garage, the sheds, the pools, the
hedges, the walks, drives, grass, trees, flowers,
a whole home and grounds to make a family
complete.
Next door you will have a second family,
with some similarities — but different. And
next door another, with connecting sidewalks
and streets, and ample open spaces for aes
thetics or the flow of air or for relaxation. And
soon you will have a whole community, with
its places to work, its places to live, to entertain,
to worship—whatever it needs; and all of it
planned by man to coincide with the highest
attainment available. Modern man has the
means and the affluence to be able to accept no
less.
Saarinen had described architecture per
fectly in a way that all could comprehend. He
had simultaneously described a total environ
ment. Obviously to him they were one and the
same. I looked around me and everything in
the room had been designed and executed by
this single great man. I realized instantly that
whether or not we had the sense to preserve it,
this was a real national monument: an endur
ing example he had provided for the future.
In the past people were a little more expan
sive because they had more expanses, and
could indulge in a complex of buildings, gar
dens, walks, pools, fountains, baths, and courts
that established their peculiar approach to or
ganization and beauty. With enough time such
a place—supplied with the proper amount of
shade or warming sun and a few birds stately
enough to keep their distance—could be a
wonderful spot for contemplation, making

love, or napping (depending on how old you
were and whether or not you were alone). A
similar place could provide the same today if
it were available and not too crowded, if the
streams were unpolluted and you could find a
parking place.
In other words, I am submitting—in fact I
am screaming along with a lot of other voices—
that these retreats are going, go ng, going. The
government has already bought up every nice
view in the country, fenced it in, put up a mark
er, paved it, and created a public park. The
clear sand beaches are filling up with broken
glass faster than the rangers can rake. And it
is too damned smoggy to go any place anyway.
THEBE was a time when the proportion
of natural environment to the population
satisfied man's needs and desires. Now
this has changed, simultaneously ruining that
pristine relationship. New technology is not
helping. It only provides us with more free
ways, rockets, and contraceptives —which only
serve to complicate not to solve the problem.
In order to straighten himself out, man must
create a new environment. He may wish to in
clude nature, but a larger proportion than be
fore will be manmade. This part will
have to be well organized. It is at this level that
it becomes art, and by planned coincidence,
total environment.
I have not meant to suggest that the artist
will or can solve all of society's ills. I do main
tain that if the artist can create in a given space
a microcosm of what it takes to exist fortui
tously, then that very ideal state will of itself
begin once more to influence him in a positive
way to reject the ugly and inane direction that
has so many times previously bogged him
down. The artist must now devote his energies
to a larger problem: genuinely making his
world better, rather than merely redecorat
ing it.
From the earliest planning stages the new

total environment must have ingredients suffi
cient to keep us from jumping out the win
dows. Hopefully, the place may even be pleas
ant; it should at least be realistic.
When I say realistic, Brasilia comes to mind.
It is about as realistic as living in Atlantis under
the sea. The great cities of the world grew
where they did simply because the people
needed a city there. Anc' if the peolple had
liked where Brasilia is, A would have been
there sooner. So much for site.
How functional is this capital for the mil
lions of poor in an agrarian nation where the
necessity for contact between the government
and the people is so imperative. Clearly, this
city is a perpetuation of that kind of shangri-la
provided for the elite in certain countries. It is
difficult to convince one's self that the vast
majority of Brazilians, who shun the place like
it had gringos, could in their wildest moments
have participated in making their government
so remote. So much for function.
Aesthetically Brasilia is another case of
heavy-handed modernism. Oh, one is instantly
remorseful that New York has gotten so
chintzy, and that Chicago has always been
squalid; that Los Angeles has been blighted
imaginatively, and that San Francisco has the
curse of pollution in more ways than one. The
central fact is that these cities have a diversity
not found in Brasilia. The age of the buildings
in other cities is of course a help, as well as
the great variety of construction materials.
The splendid outpouring of differences in their
conception is by its very nature a rich and
varying labyrinth of delight. All of which
proves what we knew all the time: variety is
what we savor, and poor Brazilia started out
being proud of its sameness.
The world has too much of the ersatz, for
the time being at least. I feel as though I have
seen enough so that from now on some of it
ought to be real. It has to be meaningful. They
