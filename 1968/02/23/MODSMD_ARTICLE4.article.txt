# Total environmental art—or:
## How to get through the future in (one) peace 
### excerpted from an article by robert friemark 
l was once sitting with Eliel Saarinen, the
old man, as he described what architecture is.
You start with the spoon, he said.
Consider the spoon: it must convey liquids
and solids; it must easily enter and retract from
the mouth. It must fit the bowl or the cup; the
edge must be able to scoop or cut, but not in
the mouth. It must balance nicely in the fin
gers, full or empty. It has these characteristics
in common with every spoon, but if it is truly
to be individual, it must remind the beholder
instantly that he has never seen a spoon like it
before. Once the spoon is perfect, we have
somewhere to begin.
The spoon must relate well to the knife and
fork. These in turn must be suited to and com
pliment the plate between them. Then there
is the matter of the saucer and cup, the bowls,
all the other dishes of the set. And then the
place mat upon which it sits, and this in rela
tion, not only to them, but to the tablecloth,
and the tablecloth to the table.
Next come the chairs, and then the other
furniture of the room, including the interior
of the room itself. Then comes the relationship
of this room to its adjoining room, until you
have bedrooms, library, parlors, halls, lavato
ries—a whole house. And then the outbuild
ings: the garage, the sheds, the pools, the
hedges, the walks, drives, grass, trees, flowers,
a whole home and grounds to make a family
complete.
Next door you will have a second family,
with some similarities — but different. And
next door another, with connecting sidewalks
and streets, and ample open spaces for aes
thetics or the flow of air or for relaxation. And
soon you will have a whole community, with
its places to work, its places to live, to entertain,
to worship—whatever it needs; and all of it
planned by man to coincide with the highest
attainment available. Modern man has the
means and the affluence to be able to accept no
less.
Saarinen had described architecture per
fectly in a way that all could comprehend. He
had simultaneously described a total environ
ment. Obviously to him they were one and the
same. I looked around me and everything in
the room had been designed and executed by
this single great man. I realized instantly that
whether or not we had the sense to preserve it,
this was a real national monument: an endur
ing example he had provided for the future.
In the past people were a little more expan
sive because they had more expanses, and
could indulge in a complex of buildings, gar
dens, walks, pools, fountains, baths, and courts
that established their peculiar approach to or
ganization and beauty. With enough time such
a place—supplied with the proper amount of
shade or warming sun and a few birds stately
enough to keep their distance—could be a
wonderful spot for contemplation, making

love, or napping (depending on how old you
were and whether or not you were alone). A
similar place could provide the same today if
it were available and not too crowded, if the
streams were unpolluted and you could find a
parking place.
In other words, I am submitting—in fact I
am screaming along with a lot of other voices—
that these retreats are going, go ng, going. The
government has already bought up every nice
view in the country, fenced it in, put up a mark
er, paved it, and created a public park. The
clear sand beaches are filling up with broken
glass faster than the rangers can rake. And it
is too damned smoggy to go any place anyway.
THEBE was a time when the proportion
of natural environment to the population
satisfied man's needs and desires. Now
this has changed, simultaneously ruining that
pristine relationship. New technology is not
helping. It only provides us with more free
ways, rockets, and contraceptives —which only
serve to complicate not to solve the problem.
In order to straighten himself out, man must
create a new environment. He may wish to in
clude nature, but a larger proportion than be
fore will be manmade. This part will
have to be well organized. It is at this level that
it becomes art, and by planned coincidence,
total environment.
I have not meant to suggest that the artist
will or can solve all of society's ills. I do main
tain that if the artist can create in a given space
a microcosm of what it takes to exist fortui
tously, then that very ideal state will of itself
begin once more to influence him in a positive
way to reject the ugly and inane direction that
has so many times previously bogged him
down. The artist must now devote his energies
to a larger problem: genuinely making his
world better, rather than merely redecorat
ing it.
From the earliest planning stages the new

total environment must have ingredients suffi
cient to keep us from jumping out the win
dows. Hopefully, the place may even be pleas
ant; it should at least be realistic.
When I say realistic, Brasilia comes to mind.
It is about as realistic as living in Atlantis under
the sea. The great cities of the world grew
where they did simply because the people
needed a city there. Anc' if the peolple had
liked where Brasilia is, A would have been
there sooner. So much for site.
How functional is this capital for the mil
lions of poor in an agrarian nation where the
necessity for contact between the government
and the people is so imperative. Clearly, this
city is a perpetuation of that kind of shangri-la
provided for the elite in certain countries. It is
difficult to convince one's self that the vast
majority of Brazilians, who shun the place like
it had gringos, could in their wildest moments
have participated in making their government
so remote. So much for function.
Aesthetically Brasilia is another case of
heavy-handed modernism. Oh, one is instantly
remorseful that New York has gotten so
chintzy, and that Chicago has always been
squalid; that Los Angeles has been blighted
imaginatively, and that San Francisco has the
curse of pollution in more ways than one. The
central fact is that these cities have a diversity
not found in Brasilia. The age of the buildings
in other cities is of course a help, as well as
the great variety of construction materials.
The splendid outpouring of differences in their
conception is by its very nature a rich and
varying labyrinth of delight. All of which
proves what we knew all the time: variety is
what we savor, and poor Brazilia started out
being proud of its sameness.
The world has too much of the ersatz, for
the time being at least. I feel as though I have
seen enough so that from now on some of it
ought to be real. It has to be meaningful. They

took the good German sausage of my youth,
with its savory aroma of hickory, and gave me
back a paste in a plastic tube. I am sick of
falsies, no matter what size. I want to spit on
your bread and throw it to the fish. Wonder
bread, indeed. I, who have had sour, crusty
French. That is what it is all about. We have
had one joy in life after another replaced with
something cheap and tawdry, like soup in cans,
till it is just too much; till the human spirit is
gagging and if it is going to survive at all, can
not take one more lick.
7 have a movie star for governor, and smug
Easterners telling me it is just what I deserve:
it is enough to make one hate plastic. Of course
man's world is what he deserves, hut the hell
of it all is that this is the first generation since
the beginning of time which ran out of room
in which man could keep just ahead of his
just deserts, and it's just my luck that it's my
generation.
APPRISED of the debilitating aspects, let
us survey the horizon for indications of
hope. If you feel boxed in, there are
ways out. I have seen some total environments
that worked.
In 1922 Saarinen built Cranbrook, an archi
tectural school in Michigan. Today it seems
just as contemporary, functional, beautiful,
and farsighted as it did then. It provided for
countless fountains, pools and sculptures in
more profusion, scale and grandeur than any
other school or other complex in the U.S. It
has more fountains than most places have toi
lets. It is a total environment.
A fountain is a very important thing in build
ing. Its aesthetic is not merely visual, although
splashing water is surely one of the simplest
and most satisfying of man's delights. Water is
also tugging, surging and running through us,
and perhaps our own soul performs like some
divining fork that bends toward its source.
Man has the satisfaction that water will always
cleanse him, while the soft plosh of its cascade
fixes its position of fond sound firmly in the
midst of his total music.
It must have been with this realization that
Saarinen collaborated with Carl Milles, the

foremost fountain sculptor of this century, to
produce this place which so perfectly reflects
their insight. Here it is obvious that a student
senses an unbroken line between himself and
those enlightened Greeks who sat around the
Acropolis, in an environment suitable for his
thoughts. This is something I know is true.
Simon Roddia came with another choice
gift for his fellow man. For 30 backbreaking
years he sweat to build his towers in the bar
barous town of Watts. This, of course, is ex
actly where they should be, and where they
are needed. But the spectacle of such a sin
cerity locked in art was almost too much for
L.A., and it fought viciously for years to have
the wonder torn down. All this in the name of
progress, when it was the only visible beauty
in the whole of Watts—the only cultural attri
bute in a deprived community. Fortunately the
crass and unsympathetic element finally gave
up. Now, until the next menace, the towers be
long to history and the guardians of our heir
looms.
Being influenced by these artists, I find my
self working and teaching—if not around and
toward, at least with a more acute awareness
of total environment. This forces me to recon
sider my own efforts, as well as those of others.
At times I must consider why I made a piece,
which is one step beyond what does it all
mean?
I recently completed, for example, a suite of
serigraphs depicting the 50 U.S. States, and
called the Fifty States. Although taken indi
vidually a picture is just an item and not an
environment, it may well be a contribution to
one. From another point of view, the U.S. is
my environment, and all these works or sym
bols are direct expressions of this influence.
But while the natural environment may at
times be inhospitable to humans, the man
made environment can be tailored to fit their
needs.
One way of performing this function is to
plant a stimulus in the symbol that will evoke
a response in the beholder. One might make a
comparison with the wallet-pictures of loved
ones, which, wherever they are pulled out and

considered, produce the desired effect. This is
the same reason churches must have a supply
of saints, gods and their mothers, which evoke
the proper piety, goodness, solace or suste
nance, depending on the supplicant's wants.
In the case of my work, I felt it was just pos
sible that a viewer, seeing and grasping and
accepting some vestige of his origins, is at
once more secure and confident of his direc
tion. These are some of the reasons why man
has had pictures around all this time. They not
only evoke environment, they become environ
ment.
Exterior art is also an important aspect of
total environment. Being familiar with Mexi
can and Japanese art, I am embarrassed by the
poverty of our own—the drab condition of our
buildings, our grounds, our parks. It is some
what surprising that the Puritan tradition was
so dominant and widespread that it was able
to crush almost all the Spanish and Oriental
architectural instincts brought into this coun
try.
Such was the nature, however, of this socio
political - religious conservatism that it de
manded all other instincts suppressed, ab
sorbed, or remolded into standard American
models. The whole idea of individual freedom
had to give way for democracy—which I guess
is some kind of stew in which everything is
boiled alive until the toughest is done (in).
I COULD tell you that the city of tomorrow
will be a beautiful place in which to live;
but you would have to be pretty gullible
to believe it. Pick up any paper and read about
our urban problems; reflect on how easily and
rapidly they are being solved. Project this into
tomorrow, and you will have a fairly accurate
picture of the future city.
The closer people get to each other, the
more hate becomes a problem. When I was a
kid, we built tree houses. It was a sanctuary
from the buffeting world. When I grew up I
became aware that people were buying two
homes—one to live in and one to-get-away
from-it-all in. Man can sit in his tree house
and think his way into a better future with his
big brain, but until he gets off his fat cot ana
devotes himself to realism, there will be little
relation between his dream and the world as
it is. Man should put his ideals into effect be
fore they are worn out.
The idea of a total environment is intrig
uing — a capsule of everything the outside
world once provided in such abundance. Man
is going to have to drag into this lair enough
materials to sustain his life: food, drink, vents,
anti-radiation devices, and enough intelligence
and equipment to keep occupied so that ht
doesn't want out. (As soon as he wants out it
becomes a prison and no longer functional. II
the place is over indulgent, then he will go sofl
and be unable to encounter the outside world.)
One thing is evident: total environmer'
could provide the place to recuperate from the
frenzy of life, as well as supplying the condi
tioning which will enable man to reconfronl
the outside world.
In the middle of this search for the ideal en
vironment ought to be the artist —if he's sin
allowed—recording, interpreting, and making
his nasty comments. That's his thing.
