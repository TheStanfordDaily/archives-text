# Environmental qualities of tomorrow's cities

At the beginning of the 21st
Century the United States
will be an overwhelmingly
urbanized society, with over 75 per
cent of its population of 340 million
living in metropolitan areas. Hous
ing, transportation, land-use plan
ning, recreational facilities, water
supplies, waste disposal, and air pol
lution control—all of the environ
mental factors affecting the health
and welfare of man should be under
consideration by the decision-mak
ers who will guide the destinies of
the cities of the future.
Engineers, planners, and archi
tects are debating whether the hous
ing structures in these areas should
be vertical—the 200-story residen
tial cities of Buckminster Fuller; or
horizontal —the "new towns" con
cept of Finland, the United King
dom, and Reston, Virginia, all built
on the periphery of existing metro
politan areas; or whether entirely
"new cities" should be built in areas
remote from the congestion of the
present megalopolitan regions. Re
gardless of location or structure, this
country has the power and econom
ic resources to develop or maintain
the air, land and water environment
man may want for his health and
welfare in the 21st Century. The
slogan of the New York State De
partment of Health is appropriate:
"Public health is purchasable at a
price."
Demographers are predicting that
four immense metropolitan regions
will exist by the year 2000, the out
growth and coalescense of cities
along the north Atlantic seaboard,
the lower Great Lakes, Florida, and
California. It is further predicted
that although these regions will oc
cupy only 7 to 8 percent of the land
area of the United States, 60 percent
of the population—about 200 mil
lion people—will be living in these
megalopolitan areas.
Professor Kevin A. Lynch, the re
nowned M.I.T. planner, has written:
"If you ask anyone to imagine a City
of 50,000 square miles, 600 miles
long (as the California megalopolis
is projected to be), he feels desper
ate because he imagines a mechan
ical enlargement of the present city.
But one need not feel lost in a re
gion, simply because it is encompas
sing. Setting limits is only one way
of structuring. Such a region could
be a very diverse place, it could be
clean and open, the quality of its
life could be pleasant and challeng
ing. It could be a homeland, a be
loved landscape. The sense of being
at home depends neither on size
nor on traditional form, but on an
active relation between men and
their landscape, a landscape which
they made and which speeks to
them. How can we achieve this
in such vast areas?
"All large developing areas at the

metropolitan fringe should pass
through the hands of capable public
authorities but not through a single
central authority. It should be a
public responsibility to see that an
adequate supply of land for de
velopment is constantly available
throughout the metropolitan region
and that it is well planned, well ser
viced, and free of speculative sur
charge.
"In these new fringe areas, we
can channel high density housing,
services, and concentrated employ
ment into a galaxy of metropolitan
centers, each large enough to pro
vide substantial diversity and to
support a local transit system, pro
vided with structures linked at
many levels, pedestrian carriers, and
climate control. To the extent that
these centers have a special charac
ter of activity and form, they can
stand for differentiated areas of the
region and might encourage social
interactions over a broader geogra
phic base, less tied to class and
race."
Some pertinent questions about
megalopoli have been asked by Ed
gardo Contini, a prominent Los An
geles planning consultant: "If the
projection of growth cannot be chal
lenged and the trend toward urban
ization is not reversible, are there
alternatives to the predicted image
of the United States of tomorrow —
two-thirds of its population concen
trated in a dozen clusters of urban
ization of 15 to 20 million each? Are
our children destined to have no
other choice than Megalopolis?
His answers make a great deal of

sense, particularly in the spacious
West: "The alternative consists of
undertaking as a matter of national
policy the creation of New Cities—
new in that they must be viewed
as urban organizations responsive
to human needs and aspirations;
"cities" in that (unlike the "new
towns" dependent upon the adja
cent metropolis) they must from the
beginning be complete urban struc
tures; New Cities in that their self
sufficiency, independence of exist
ing political forces and interests
will permit experimentation with
techniques that are not possible in
the existing cities.
"The New Cities must be large
enough to support a full range of
cultural and educational facilities.
The optimum size will have to be
determined by regional character
istics, the local economic base and
other factors. Indefinite expansion
beyond optimum size should be
discouraged. New political and
economic devices and incentives
should initially encourage and, at
later stages, limit their growth."
As one flies from San Francisco
to Chicago he observes very little
habitation for 2000 miles. Vast areas
are available for the potential de
velopment of new cities. Cities on
the desert are more than a remote
possibility. Look at Las Vegas—a
small railroad town only thirty years
ago! The civil engineer can provide
water anywhere—at a price—and
also transportation and other neces
sities for urban development. Many
political, economic, and land plan
ning problems would arise but

these are possible of solution by
modern decision-malang principles.
It would be necessary for the state
and federal government to aid in
the conception, planning, financing
and construction of these new
cities, and in providing for water,
transportation and other utilities.
Private industry would be encour
aged to establish research, pro
duction and commercial facilities in
order to create employment for the
residents. Many other problems of
providing for education, cultural
centers, recreation, and those intan
gibles which make up the "good
life" must be included in the urban
planning projects.
What about the environ
ment of the new cities?
This must be considered
in three categories: land, air and
water. Land has been discussed
above. The control of air pollution
must be one of the «lominent factors
in the location and the design of
each new city. Extensive meteorolo
gical studies must precede any plan
ning. The ideal location would be
where the winds would be gentle,
but strong enough to sweep out air
pollutants. It would be foolhardy to
select an area which was subject
to severe temperature inversions
which in effect place a lid on the
city. Such is the case in the Los An
geles Metropolitan area.
The locations of many of the ex
isting large cities of the country
were determined by transportation
facilities such as bodies of water,
railroads, and highways. Hence the
predominent valley site for so many
eastern cities. These valleys com
pound the problems of air pollution
by not being self-cleansing at all
times. The air resources of many
other cities, including Los Angeles
and New York, are limited. Further
population growth should not be en
couraged. There are so many areas
in the United States that would be
far more ideal from the meteorolo
gical standpoint, places that can
support large populations blessed
with plentiful air resources, a fun
damental factor of environmental
quality.
Every effort would be made in
these new cities, as in the older
cities, to control all sources of air
pollution — from industry, com
merce, transportation, municipal
and residential activities. Air pol
lution control will be feasible from
the engineering and economic
standpoints, again if the populace
is willing to pay the price and if the
political realm can be persuaded to
enact and enforce restricting legisla
tion.
Transportation presents a major
air pollution problem. In 1966 auto
mobiles contributed 86,000,000 tons
per year to the gross pollutants of
the atmosphere of the United States.
This represents 60 percent of the to
