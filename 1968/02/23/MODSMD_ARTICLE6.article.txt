I have been asked many times: "What would
you do if you were building commissioner
of the United States or even the entire
world?"
I would resign. I am an inventor and so have
far vaster prerogatives than any politician.
Edison, Bell, Marconi and the Wrights needed
no licenses from anyone to light the night, to
shrink the earth and to interlink all humanity.
So I will pass up any hypothetical political ap
pointment, but will accept the housing chal
lenge as an inventor.
The drawings of the tetrahedral city on
these pages represent an entirely feasible and
practical new way for men to live together eco
nomically. The drawings cannot be under
stood, however, without knowing the trends in
housing and cities that lead up to them. And
their full appreciation requires knowledge, too,
of the importance of technology—and there
fore of the inventor —in human affairs.
Yesterday's capitalists disliked inventors,
who made the capitalists' machines obsolete.
Businessmen were powerful enough to per
suade society that inventors were screwballs.
All that is changing; businessmen now find
change profitable and inventors are becoming
respectable. Inventors pay attention only to
physical laws—which alone govern what man
ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often
lethal biases of politics.
Our higher potentials are unrealized because
environmental conditions have frustrated
man's potentials. We have learned much, how
ever, through recent behavioral - science re
search. For instance, we know that environ
mental conditions determine how much of the
child's total brain potential will blossom into
effectiveness.
Politics undertakes to reform only man, not
his environment. For decades, society has tried
to reduce automobile accidents by reforming
drivers—with arrests, fines, behavioral exhor
tations and laws. I always thought that, in
stead, it is physically possible to prevent acci
dents: by split-level crossings, banked turns
and divided highways. Society has at last un
dertaken to reform the driving environment.
Take away all the inventions from humanity
and, within six months, half of us would die of
starvation and disease. Take away all the poli
ticians and all political ideologies and leave all
the inventions and more would eat and prosper
than do now.
My task as an inventor is to employ the
earth's resources in such a way as to support
all humanity while also enabling all people to
enjoy the whole earth—all of its historical arti
facts and its beautiful places — without one

man interfering with another and without any
man enjoying life at the cost of another.
The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of
great countries.
Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus

systems ... to do so, science must understand man

to accomplish this will be contained in a little
black box weighing about 500 pounds and
measuring about 20 cubic feet. With the little
black box, a man in space will be able to re
generate his many organic processes, needing
only small annual additions to the recirculating
chemistry. The first men living comfortably in
space will be watched on TV by billions on
earth. Humanity will be swiftly educated in an
entirely new set of environmental-control me
chanics.
Though the first black box will probably
cost the United States and Russia well over
seven billion dollars, it will be mass-reprodu
cible on earth at around two dollars per pound.
A $1000 box could rent profitably at $200 a
year. An individual or family could take a
black box (costing approximately $18 a
month) and go to any wilderness—mountain
top or island —and enjoy essential services su
perior to those now available in any city com
plex. The black box will constitute the first di
rect application of science to making man a
physical and economic success anywhere in
the universe—which, of course, includes on
earth.
The history of cities points to the same con
clusions as the history of the home (which we
can confidently predict will reach its logical
conclusion with the perfection of the little
black box). Cities developed entirely before
the thought of electricity or automobiles or be
fore any of the millions of inventions registered
in the United States Patent Office. Cities de
veloped as warehouse trading posts. All ware
housing has gone out of the modern city. Ware
housing has become dynamic and now is most
ly done on wheels, wings or in ships. Cities
were later used to house vast hordes of immi
grants to work in the factories, which were also
centered in the cities. Now the factories have
also left the cities obsolete in terms of yester
day's functions. Trying to rebuild them to ac
commodate the new needs of world man is like
trying to reconstruct and improve a wrecked
ship impaled on a reef pounded by surf. The
surf of technical obsolescence is invisible but
much more powerful than the waves of the real
ocean.
A few elementary engineering concepts
point clearly, I believe, to what the new cities
will be like. For example, when we double the
length of an airplane fuselage, we increase its
surface area by four and increase its volume
by eight. The surface area of a ship—rather
than the volume—governs its friction and drag.
The larger the ship, the more economically its
cargo may be carried. Yesterday's airplanes
were limited in size because they required ex
tremely long landing strips. The emerging gen
eration of large airplanes—which will carry
700 to 1000 passengers or more —is being de
signed for vertical take-off and landing, which
does away with the necessity for prepared
landing strips.
To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.
The new Queen Elizabeth is a luxuriously
comfortable abode either at sea or in port. She
is a mobile city. She is shaped to get passengers
across oceans in a hurry. If such floating cities
didn't have to speed, they might have an effi
ciently symmetrical shape. It is eminently
feasible and economical to develop floatable
organic cities of immense size. To visualize the
various design - controlling conditions under
which such cities could be constructed, imag
ine pinching a camera tripod's legs together,
taking hold of the bottom of the tripod in one
hand and trying to hold it vertically on the top
of an automobile going 70 miles an hour, over
rough terrain. As you opened the legs of the
tripod—each time you spread them—the tri
pod would get steadier and steadier. This is
the stabilizing effect obtained when tension
stays are rigged from top to bottom on three

sides of a mast, as with radio towers. It is
equally effective to have the legs spread out
wardly, as in the Eiffel Tower. When the three
legs are spread apart so that the length of the
edges of their base triangle equals the length
of each of the legs themselves, the tripod at
tains its maximum stability. This conformation
is that of the regular, or equilateral, tetrahe
dron. As the tripod's legs go farther apart than
the regular tetrahedron, its lop can support
less and less load. Thus we learn that the most
stable structure is the regular, equiedged tetra
hedron.
Following this design science clue, we find
that a tetrahedral city to house 1,000,000 peo
ple is both technologically and economically
feasible. Such a hollow tetrahedral city can be
constructed with each of its 300,000 families
having terraced "outside" apartments of 2000
square feet each. The terraces would permit

the storage of mobile trailers, houseboats and
other mobile homes, leaving an additional 1000
square feet for a garden. The living units
would be weatherproofed and would require
no additional "walls," or external skins, to be
fastened onto the tetrahedral city. Such a city
would consist of an open-truss-framework
"structural mountain," whose sides are covered
with parked mobile homes. At night, it would
be ablaze with lights, as are the great petro
leum refineries. All of the organic machinery
necessary to its operation would be housed be
hind the three principal "walls" of the tetra
hedron.
Tetrahedrons are also geometrically unique
in that they grow symmetrically by additions
to any one of their faces. Tetrahedral cities
may start with 1000 occupants and grow to
hold millions without changing their over-all
shape and always providing each family with
2000 square feet of floor space. (The city illus
trating this article, for example, while much
smaller than the model discussed here, is tech
nically identical.) Such a city would be so
structurally efficient and therefore so relatively
light that, together with its foundation —of
of hollow sections of reinforced concrete — it
could float. The model floating city would
measure two miles to an edge. Its foundation
would be 200. feet or more in depth and sev
eral hundred feet wide. On land, the structure
could float in a three-sided moat, which would
make the whole city earthquake-proof. Or the
structure could be floated out into the ocean
to any point and anchored. The depth of its
foundation would go below the turbulent level
of the seas, so that it would be, in effect, a float
ing triangular atoll. Its two-mile base would
provide landing strips for jet airplanes. Its in
terior, two-mile harbor would provide refuge
for the largest ocean vessels.
The total structural and mechanical mate
rials involved in production of a number of
such 1,000,000 - inhabitant tetrahedral cities
are within the capabilities of several compa
nies in the major industrial nations. Withdraw-

ities of several companies in the major industrial nations."

al of materials from obsolete buildings on the
land will permit the production of enough of
these floating cities to dot the oceans of the
earth, at distances negotiable by relatively
small boats. Because their foundations would
be below wave turbulence, such cities would
also permit mid-ocean cargo transfers, extraor
dinarily increasing the efficiency of material
and passenger traffic. The cities would gener
ate their own energy with atomic reactors,
whose by-product heat would be used to de
salinate sea water for the city's water supply.
In short, these habitats would greatly facilitate
both travel of all sorts and the coming large
scale exploitation of the oceans.
In 1954, the United States Marine Corps hel
icopter-lifted a geodesic dome large enough to
house an American family. The latest helicop
ters being built for Vietnam can air-deliver
geodesic domes large enough to cover a foot
ball field, including the end zones, the quarter
mile running track and side bleachers. By 1975,
it will be possible to air-deliver geodesic domes
large enough to cover small cities. (It is now
possible to cover a large city in three months
by delivering large subassemblies of a dome.)
There are already 5000 geodesic domes in 50
countries around the world, many so light and
strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu
larly where antiquities need to be protected.
The domes over our cities will be so high
and their structural members so delicate as to
be nearly invisible. They will bring shadow
when shadow is desirable and sun when sun
is desirable, always keeping out rain, snow and
storms as well as exterior industrial fumes,
while collecting rain water in reservoirs. The
temperature inside the domes will be so sta
bilized that a semitropical atmosphere will ex
ist. Inasmuch as there will be no rain or snow,
people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half
mile in diameter, the weight of the air enclosed
is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a
ratio of 1000 to 1. When the sun shines on an
open-frame aluminum geodesic sphere of one
half-mile diameter, sunlight is reflected by the
concave ininer surface back into the sphere and
gradually heats the interior atmosphere. When
the interior temperature of the sphere rises
only one degree Fahrenheit, the weight of air
pushed out of the sphere is greater than the
weight of the spherical-frame geodesic struc
ture. This means that the total weight of the
interior air, plus the weight of the structure, is

much less than the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con
trol facilities. Nowadays, at international air
port hotels, people with one - to - eight - hour
flight stopovers follow one another in rooms
and beds that are made up as soon as each oc
cupant leaves.. The rooms are occupied, not on
a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation
schedule. Such frequency - modulated occu
pancy of rented space in mobile hotels or in
dwelling machines will become man's funda
mental life pattern.
The great world housing problem is an edu
cational problem. By and large, man's inertias
are overcome only by virtue of his own per
sonal discoveries and his understanding of
what is happening to him. There will be no
instant world housing solutions. There are
fundamental rates at which the educational
gestation takes place. Publishers who try to ex
ploit man's imagination by giving him only the
end-product concepts, without showing how
man will get from here to there, postpone the
opportunities for helping man educate himself
as to how these events may come to pass. I, for
one, am unwilling to allow anyone to be
amused by startling concepts of tetrahedral
cities and air-deliverable Empire State Build
ings while keeping from society the opportu
nity to understand the complex of factors that
lead to such tangible results.
The comprehensive introduction of automa
tion everywhere around the earth will free man
from being an automaton and will generate so
rapid a mastery and multiplication of energy
wealth that we will be able to support all of
humanity in ever greater physical and eco-

earth. Quite clearly, man free to enjoy all of his
planet, free to research the bottom of his ocean
and to re-explore earlier patterns of man's life
on earth, will also be swiftly outward-bound to
occupy ever greater ranges of the universe.
Within decades, we will know whether man is
going to be a physical success here or is going
to frustrate his own success with his negatively
conditioned reflexes of yesterday — bringing
about his own extinction. My intuitions sense

intuitions will mean nothing unless man learns
to understand and control the forces shaping
him and the new patterns of living available
to him.

To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.
The new Queen Elizabeth is a luxuriously
comfortable abode either at sea or in port. She
is a mobile city. She is shaped to get passengers
across oceans in a hurry. If such floating cities
didn't have to speed, they might have an effi
ciently symmetrical shape. It is eminently
feasible and economical to develop floatable
organic cities of immense size. To visualize the
various design - controlling conditions under
which such cities could be constructed, imag
ine pinching a camera tripod's legs together,
taking hold of the bottom of the tripod in one
hand and trying to hold it vertically on the top
of an automobile going 70 miles an hour, over
rough terrain. As you opened the legs of the
tripod—each time you spread them—the tri
pod would get steadier and steadier. This is
the stabilizing effect obtained when tension
stays are rigged from top to bottom on three

sides of a mast, as with radio towers. It is
equally effective to have the legs spread out
wardly, as in the Eiffel Tower. When the three
legs are spread apart so that the length of the
edges of their base triangle equals the length
of each of the legs themselves, the tripod at
tains its maximum stability. This conformation
is that of the regular, or equilateral, tetrahe
dron. As the tripod's legs go farther apart than
the regular tetrahedron, its lop can support
less and less load. Thus we learn that the most
stable structure is the regular, equiedged tetra
hedron.
Following this design science clue, we find
that a tetrahedral city to house 1,000,000 peo
ple is both technologically and economically
feasible. Such a hollow tetrahedral city can be
constructed with each of its 300,000 families
having terraced "outside" apartments of 2000
square feet each. The terraces would permit

the storage of mobile trailers, houseboats and
other mobile homes, leaving an additional 1000
square feet for a garden. The living units
would be weatherproofed and would require
no additional "walls," or external skins, to be
fastened onto the tetrahedral city. Such a city
would consist of an open-truss-framework
"structural mountain," whose sides are covered
with parked mobile homes. At night, it would
be ablaze with lights, as are the great petro
leum refineries. All of the organic machinery
necessary to its operation would be housed be
hind the three principal "walls" of the tetra
hedron.
Tetrahedrons are also geometrically unique
in that they grow symmetrically by additions
to any one of their faces. Tetrahedral cities
may start with 1000 occupants and grow to
hold millions without changing their over-all
shape and always providing each family with
2000 square feet of floor space. (The city illus
trating this article, for example, while much
smaller than the model discussed here, is tech
nically identical.) Such a city would be so
structurally efficient and therefore so relatively
light that, together with its foundation —of
of hollow sections of reinforced concrete — it
could float. The model floating city would
measure two miles to an edge. Its foundation
would be 200. feet or more in depth and sev
eral hundred feet wide. On land, the structure
could float in a three-sided moat, which would
make the whole city earthquake-proof. Or the
structure could be floated out into the ocean
to any point and anchored. The depth of its
foundation would go below the turbulent level
of the seas, so that it would be, in effect, a float
ing triangular atoll. Its two-mile base would
provide landing strips for jet airplanes. Its in
terior, two-mile harbor would provide refuge
for the largest ocean vessels.

al of materials from obsolete buildings on the
land will permit the production of enough of
these floating cities to dot the oceans of the
earth, at distances negotiable by relatively
small boats. Because their foundations would
be below wave turbulence, such cities would
also permit mid-ocean cargo transfers, extraor
dinarily increasing the efficiency of material
and passenger traffic. The cities would gener
ate their own energy with atomic reactors,
whose by-product heat would be used to de
salinate sea water for the city's water supply.
In short, these habitats would greatly facilitate
both travel of all sorts and the coming large
scale exploitation of the oceans.
In 1954, the United States Marine Corps hel
icopter-lifted a geodesic dome large enough to
house an American family. The latest helicop
ters being built for Vietnam can air-deliver
geodesic domes large enough to cover a foot
ball field, including the end zones, the quarter
mile running track and side bleachers. By 1975,
it will be possible to air-deliver geodesic domes
large enough to cover small cities. (It is now
possible to cover a large city in three months
by delivering large subassemblies of a dome.)
There are already 5000 geodesic domes in 50
countries around the world, many so light and
strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu
larly where antiquities need to be protected.
The domes over our cities will be so high
and their structural members so delicate as to
be nearly invisible. They will bring shadow
when shadow is desirable and sun when sun
is desirable, always keeping out rain, snow and
storms as well as exterior industrial fumes,
while collecting rain water in reservoirs. The
temperature inside the domes will be so sta
bilized that a semitropical atmosphere will ex
ist. Inasmuch as there will be no rain or snow,
people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half
mile in diameter, the weight of the air enclosed
is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a
ratio of 1000 to 1. When the sun shines on an
open-frame aluminum geodesic sphere of one
half-mile diameter, sunlight is reflected by the
concave ininer surface back into the sphere and
gradually heats the interior atmosphere. When
the interior temperature of the sphere rises
only one degree Fahrenheit, the weight of air
pushed out of the sphere is greater than the
weight of the spherical-frame geodesic struc
ture. This means that the total weight of the
interior air, plus the weight of the structure, is

much less than the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con
trol facilities. Nowadays, at international air
port hotels, people with one - to - eight - hour
flight stopovers follow one another in rooms
and beds that are made up as soon as each oc
cupant leaves.. The rooms are occupied, not on
a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation
schedule. Such frequency - modulated occu
pancy of rented space in mobile hotels or in
dwelling machines will become man's funda
mental life pattern.
The great world housing problem is an edu
cational problem. By and large, man's inertias
are overcome only by virtue of his own per
sonal discoveries and his understanding of
what is happening to him. There will be no
instant world housing solutions. There are
fundamental rates at which the educational
gestation takes place. Publishers who try to ex
ploit man's imagination by giving him only the
end-product concepts, without showing how
man will get from here to there, postpone the
opportunities for helping man educate himself
as to how these events may come to pass. I, for
one, am unwilling to allow anyone to be
amused by startling concepts of tetrahedral
cities and air-deliverable Empire State Build
ings while keeping from society the opportu
nity to understand the complex of factors that
lead to such tangible results.

and to re-explore earlier patterns of man's life
on earth, will also be swiftly outward-bound to

Within decades, we will know whether man is
going to be a physical success here or is going
to frustrate his own success with his negatively
conditioned reflexes of yesterday — bringing
about his own extinction. My intuitions sense

intuitions will mean nothing unless man learns
to understand and control the forces shaping
him and the new patterns of living available
to him.

I have been asked many times: "What would
you do if you were building commissioner
of the United States or even the entire
world?"
I would resign. I am an inventor and so have
far vaster prerogatives than any politician.
Edison, Bell, Marconi and the Wrights needed
no licenses from anyone to light the night, to
shrink the earth and to interlink all humanity.
So I will pass up any hypothetical political ap
pointment, but will accept the housing chal
lenge as an inventor.
The drawings of the tetrahedral city on
these pages represent an entirely feasible and
practical new way for men to live together eco
nomically. The drawings cannot be under
stood, however, without knowing the trends in
housing and cities that lead up to them. And
their full appreciation requires knowledge, too,
of the importance of technology—and there
fore of the inventor —in human affairs.
Yesterday's capitalists disliked inventors,
who made the capitalists' machines obsolete.
Businessmen were powerful enough to per
suade society that inventors were screwballs.
All that is changing; businessmen now find
change profitable and inventors are becoming
respectable. Inventors pay attention only to
physical laws—which alone govern what man
ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often
lethal biases of politics.
Our higher potentials are unrealized because
environmental conditions have frustrated
man's potentials. We have learned much, how
ever, through recent behavioral - science re
search. For instance, we know that environ
mental conditions determine how much of the
child's total brain potential will blossom into
effectiveness.
Politics undertakes to reform only man, not
his environment. For decades, society has tried
to reduce automobile accidents by reforming
drivers—with arrests, fines, behavioral exhor
tations and laws. I always thought that, in
stead, it is physically possible to prevent acci
dents: by split-level crossings, banked turns
and divided highways. Society has at last un
dertaken to reform the driving environment.
Take away all the inventions from humanity
and, within six months, half of us would die of
starvation and disease. Take away all the poli
ticians and all political ideologies and leave all
the inventions and more would eat and prosper
than do now.
My task as an inventor is to employ the
earth's resources in such a way as to support
all humanity while also enabling all people to
enjoy the whole earth—all of its historical arti
facts and its beautiful places — without one

man interfering with another and without any
man enjoying life at the cost of another.
The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of
great countries.
Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus


A drawing of the 200-story city superimposed
on a photo of the outskirts of Tokyo vies for
attention with Mount Fuji. This structure
would include transport systems, community
parks, shopping centers in geodesic domes,
and maintenance facilities.

human environmental and metabolic-regeneration
systems ... to do so, science must understand man
as a process."

to accomplish this will be contained in a little
black box weighing about 500 pounds and
measuring about 20 cubic feet. With the little
black box, a man in space will be able to re
generate his many organic processes, needing
only small annual additions to the recirculating
chemistry. The first men living comfortably in
space will be watched on TV by billions on
earth. Humanity will be swiftly educated in an
entirely new set of environmental-control me
chanics.
Though the first black box will probably
cost the United States and Russia well over
seven billion dollars, it will be mass-reprodu
cible on earth at around two dollars per pound.
A $1000 box could rent profitably at $200 a
year. An individual or family could take a
black box (costing approximately $18 a
month) and go to any wilderness—mountain
top or island —and enjoy essential services su
perior to those now available in any city com
plex. The black box will constitute the first di
rect application of science to making man a
physical and economic success anywhere in
the universe—which, of course, includes on
earth.
The history of cities points to the same con
clusions as the history of the home (which we
can confidently predict will reach its logical
conclusion with the perfection of the little
black box). Cities developed entirely before
the thought of electricity or automobiles or be
fore any of the millions of inventions registered
in the United States Patent Office. Cities de
veloped as warehouse trading posts. All ware
housing has gone out of the modern city. Ware
housing has become dynamic and now is most
ly done on wheels, wings or in ships. Cities
were later used to house vast hordes of immi
grants to work in the factories, which were also
centered in the cities. Now the factories have
also left the cities obsolete in terms of yester
day's functions. Trying to rebuild them to ac
commodate the new needs of world man is like
trying to reconstruct and improve a wrecked
ship impaled on a reef pounded by surf. The
surf of technical obsolescence is invisible but
much more powerful than the waves of the real
ocean.
A few elementary engineering concepts
point clearly, I believe, to what the new cities
will be like. For example, when we double the
length of an airplane fuselage, we increase its
surface area by four and increase its volume
by eight. The surface area of a ship—rather
than the volume—governs its friction and drag.
The larger the ship, the more economically its
cargo may be carried. Yesterday's airplanes
were limited in size because they required ex
tremely long landing strips. The emerging gen
eration of large airplanes—which will carry
700 to 1000 passengers or more —is being de
signed for vertical take-off and landing, which
does away with the necessity for prepared
landing strips.
To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered

In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev

inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to

atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con
trol facilities. Nowadays, at international air
port hotels, people with one - to - eight - hour
flight stopovers follow one another in rooms
and beds that are made up as soon as each oc
cupant leaves.. The rooms are occupied, not on
a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation
schedule. Such frequency - modulated occu
pancy of rented space in mobile hotels or in
dwelling machines will become man's funda
mental life pattern.
The great world housing problem is an edu
cational problem. By and large, man's inertias
are overcome only by virtue of his own per
sonal discoveries and his understanding of
what is happening to him. There will be no
instant world housing solutions. There are
fundamental rates at which the educational
gestation takes place. Publishers who try to ex

end-product concepts, without showing how
man will get from here to there, postpone the
opportunities for helping man educate himself

I have been asked many times: "What would
you do if you were building commissioner
of the United States or even the entire
world?"
I would resign. I am an inventor and so have
far vaster prerogatives than any politician.
Edison, Bell, Marconi and the Wrights needed
no licenses from anyone to light the night, to
shrink the earth and to interlink all humanity.
So I will pass up any hypothetical political ap
pointment, but will accept the housing chal
lenge as an inventor.
The drawings of the tetrahedral city on
these pages represent an entirely feasible and
practical new way for men to live together eco
nomically. The drawings cannot be under
stood, however, without knowing the trends in
housing and cities that lead up to them. And
their full appreciation requires knowledge, too,
of the importance of technology—and there
fore of the inventor —in human affairs.
Yesterday's capitalists disliked inventors,
who made the capitalists' machines obsolete.
Businessmen were powerful enough to per
suade society that inventors were screwballs.
All that is changing; businessmen now find
change profitable and inventors are becoming
respectable. Inventors pay attention only to
physical laws—which alone govern what man
ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often
lethal biases of politics.
Our higher potentials are unrealized because
environmental conditions have frustrated
man's potentials. We have learned much, how
ever, through recent behavioral - science re
search. For instance, we know that environ
mental conditions determine how much of the
child's total brain potential will blossom into
effectiveness.
Politics undertakes to reform only man, not
his environment. For decades, society has tried
to reduce automobile accidents by reforming
drivers—with arrests, fines, behavioral exhor
tations and laws. I always thought that, in
stead, it is physically possible to prevent acci
dents: by split-level crossings, banked turns
and divided highways. Society has at last un
dertaken to reform the driving environment.
Take away all the inventions from humanity
and, within six months, half of us would die of
starvation and disease. Take away all the poli
ticians and all political ideologies and leave all
the inventions and more would eat and prosper
than do now.
My task as an inventor is to employ the
earth's resources in such a way as to support
all humanity while also enabling all people to
enjoy the whole earth—all of its historical arti
facts and its beautiful places — without one

man interfering with another and without any
man enjoying life at the cost of another.
The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of
great countries.
Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus


A drawing of the 200-story city superimposed
on a photo of the outskirts of Tokyo vies for
attention with Mount Fuji. This structure
would include transport systems, community
parks, shopping centers in geodesic domes,
and maintenance facilities.
" .. it has been necessary for science to package
human environmental and metabolic-regeneration
systems ... to do so, science must understand man
as a process."

to accomplish this will be contained in a little
black box weighing about 500 pounds and
measuring about 20 cubic feet. With the little
black box, a man in space will be able to re
generate his many organic processes, needing
only small annual additions to the recirculating
chemistry. The first men living comfortably in
space will be watched on TV by billions on
earth. Humanity will be swiftly educated in an
entirely new set of environmental-control me
chanics.
Though the first black box will probably
cost the United States and Russia well over
seven billion dollars, it will be mass-reprodu
cible on earth at around two dollars per pound.
A $1000 box could rent profitably at $200 a
year. An individual or family could take a
black box (costing approximately $18 a
month) and go to any wilderness—mountain
top or island —and enjoy essential services su
perior to those now available in any city com
plex. The black box will constitute the first di
rect application of science to making man a
physical and economic success anywhere in
the universe—which, of course, includes on
earth.
The history of cities points to the same con
clusions as the history of the home (which we
can confidently predict will reach its logical
conclusion with the perfection of the little
black box). Cities developed entirely before
the thought of electricity or automobiles or be
fore any of the millions of inventions registered
in the United States Patent Office. Cities de
veloped as warehouse trading posts. All ware
housing has gone out of the modern city. Ware
housing has become dynamic and now is most
ly done on wheels, wings or in ships. Cities
were later used to house vast hordes of immi
grants to work in the factories, which were also
centered in the cities. Now the factories have
also left the cities obsolete in terms of yester
day's functions. Trying to rebuild them to ac
commodate the new needs of world man is like
trying to reconstruct and improve a wrecked
ship impaled on a reef pounded by surf. The
surf of technical obsolescence is invisible but
much more powerful than the waves of the real
ocean.
A few elementary engineering concepts
point clearly, I believe, to what the new cities
will be like. For example, when we double the
length of an airplane fuselage, we increase its
surface area by four and increase its volume
by eight. The surface area of a ship—rather
than the volume—governs its friction and drag.
The larger the ship, the more economically its
cargo may be carried. Yesterday's airplanes
were limited in size because they required ex
tremely long landing strips. The emerging gen
eration of large airplanes—which will carry
700 to 1000 passengers or more —is being de
signed for vertical take-off and landing, which
does away with the necessity for prepared
landing strips.
To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.
The new Queen Elizabeth is a luxuriously
comfortable abode either at sea or in port. She
is a mobile city. She is shaped to get passengers
across oceans in a hurry. If such floating cities
didn't have to speed, they might have an effi
ciently symmetrical shape. It is eminently
feasible and economical to develop floatable
organic cities of immense size. To visualize the
various design - controlling conditions under
which such cities could be constructed, imag
ine pinching a camera tripod's legs together,
taking hold of the bottom of the tripod in one
hand and trying to hold it vertically on the top
of an automobile going 70 miles an hour, over
rough terrain. As you opened the legs of the
tripod—each time you spread them—the tri
pod would get steadier and steadier. This is
the stabilizing effect obtained when tension
stays are rigged from top to bottom on three

sides of a mast, as with radio towers. It is
equally effective to have the legs spread out
wardly, as in the Eiffel Tower. When the three
legs are spread apart so that the length of the
edges of their base triangle equals the length
of each of the legs themselves, the tripod at
tains its maximum stability. This conformation
is that of the regular, or equilateral, tetrahe
dron. As the tripod's legs go farther apart than
the regular tetrahedron, its lop can support
less and less load. Thus we learn that the most
stable structure is the regular, equiedged tetra
hedron.
Following this design science clue, we find
that a tetrahedral city to house 1,000,000 peo
ple is both technologically and economically
feasible. Such a hollow tetrahedral city can be
constructed with each of its 300,000 families
having terraced "outside" apartments of 2000
square feet each. The terraces would permit

the storage of mobile trailers, houseboats and
other mobile homes, leaving an additional 1000
square feet for a garden. The living units
would be weatherproofed and would require
no additional "walls," or external skins, to be
fastened onto the tetrahedral city. Such a city
would consist of an open-truss-framework
"structural mountain," whose sides are covered
with parked mobile homes. At night, it would
be ablaze with lights, as are the great petro
leum refineries. All of the organic machinery
necessary to its operation would be housed be
hind the three principal "walls" of the tetra
hedron.
Tetrahedrons are also geometrically unique
in that they grow symmetrically by additions
to any one of their faces. Tetrahedral cities
may start with 1000 occupants and grow to
hold millions without changing their over-all
shape and always providing each family with
2000 square feet of floor space. (The city illus
trating this article, for example, while much
smaller than the model discussed here, is tech
nically identical.) Such a city would be so
structurally efficient and therefore so relatively
light that, together with its foundation —of
of hollow sections of reinforced concrete — it
could float. The model floating city would
measure two miles to an edge. Its foundation
would be 200. feet or more in depth and sev
eral hundred feet wide. On land, the structure
could float in a three-sided moat, which would
make the whole city earthquake-proof. Or the
structure could be floated out into the ocean
to any point and anchored. The depth of its
foundation would go below the turbulent level
of the seas, so that it would be, in effect, a float
ing triangular atoll. Its two-mile base would
provide landing strips for jet airplanes. Its in
terior, two-mile harbor would provide refuge
for the largest ocean vessels.
The total structural and mechanical mate
rials involved in production of a number of
such 1,000,000 - inhabitant tetrahedral cities
are within the capabilities of several compa
nies in the major industrial nations. Withdraw-

"The total structural and mechanical materials involved in production of a
number of such million-inhabitant tetrahedral cities are within the capabil
ities of several companies in the major industrial nations."

al of materials from obsolete buildings on the
land will permit the production of enough of
these floating cities to dot the oceans of the
earth, at distances negotiable by relatively
small boats. Because their foundations would
be below wave turbulence, such cities would
also permit mid-ocean cargo transfers, extraor
dinarily increasing the efficiency of material
and passenger traffic. The cities would gener
ate their own energy with atomic reactors,
whose by-product heat would be used to de
salinate sea water for the city's water supply.
In short, these habitats would greatly facilitate
both travel of all sorts and the coming large
scale exploitation of the oceans.
In 1954, the United States Marine Corps hel
icopter-lifted a geodesic dome large enough to
house an American family. The latest helicop
ters being built for Vietnam can air-deliver
geodesic domes large enough to cover a foot
ball field, including the end zones, the quarter
mile running track and side bleachers. By 1975,
it will be possible to air-deliver geodesic domes
large enough to cover small cities. (It is now
possible to cover a large city in three months
by delivering large subassemblies of a dome.)
There are already 5000 geodesic domes in 50
countries around the world, many so light and
strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu
larly where antiquities need to be protected.
The domes over our cities will be so high
and their structural members so delicate as to
be nearly invisible. They will bring shadow
when shadow is desirable and sun when sun
is desirable, always keeping out rain, snow and
storms as well as exterior industrial fumes,
while collecting rain water in reservoirs. The
temperature inside the domes will be so sta
bilized that a semitropical atmosphere will ex
ist. Inasmuch as there will be no rain or snow,
people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half
mile in diameter, the weight of the air enclosed
is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a
ratio of 1000 to 1. When the sun shines on an
open-frame aluminum geodesic sphere of one
half-mile diameter, sunlight is reflected by the
concave ininer surface back into the sphere and
gradually heats the interior atmosphere. When
the interior temperature of the sphere rises
only one degree Fahrenheit, the weight of air
pushed out of the sphere is greater than the
weight of the spherical-frame geodesic struc
ture. This means that the total weight of the
interior air, plus the weight of the structure, is

much less than the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,

Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus

to accomplish this will be contained in a little
black box weighing about 500 pounds and
measuring about 20 cubic feet. With the little
black box, a man in space will be able to re
generate his many organic processes, needing
only small annual additions to the recirculating
chemistry. The first men living comfortably in
space will be watched on TV by billions on
earth. Humanity will be swiftly educated in an
entirely new set of environmental-control me
chanics.
Though the first black box will probably
cost the United States and Russia well over
seven billion dollars, it will be mass-reprodu
cible on earth at around two dollars per pound.
A $1000 box could rent profitably at $200 a
year. An individual or family could take a
black box (costing approximately $18 a
month) and go to any wilderness—mountain
top or island —and enjoy essential services su
perior to those now available in any city com
plex. The black box will constitute the first di
rect application of science to making man a
physical and economic success anywhere in
the universe—which, of course, includes on
earth.
The history of cities points to the same con
clusions as the history of the home (which we
can confidently predict will reach its logical
conclusion with the perfection of the little
black box). Cities developed entirely before
the thought of electricity or automobiles or be
fore any of the millions of inventions registered
in the United States Patent Office. Cities de
veloped as warehouse trading posts. All ware
housing has gone out of the modern city. Ware
housing has become dynamic and now is most
ly done on wheels, wings or in ships. Cities
were later used to house vast hordes of immi
grants to work in the factories, which were also
centered in the cities. Now the factories have
also left the cities obsolete in terms of yester
day's functions. Trying to rebuild them to ac
commodate the new needs of world man is like
trying to reconstruct and improve a wrecked
ship impaled on a reef pounded by surf. The
surf of technical obsolescence is invisible but
much more powerful than the waves of the real
ocean.
A few elementary engineering concepts
point clearly, I believe, to what the new cities
will be like. For example, when we double the
length of an airplane fuselage, we increase its
surface area by four and increase its volume
by eight. The surface area of a ship—rather
than the volume—governs its friction and drag.
The larger the ship, the more economically its
cargo may be carried. Yesterday's airplanes
were limited in size because they required ex
tremely long landing strips. The emerging gen
eration of large airplanes—which will carry
700 to 1000 passengers or more —is being de
signed for vertical take-off and landing, which
does away with the necessity for prepared
landing strips.
To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.
The new Queen Elizabeth is a luxuriously
comfortable abode either at sea or in port. She
is a mobile city. She is shaped to get passengers
across oceans in a hurry. If such floating cities
didn't have to speed, they might have an effi
ciently symmetrical shape. It is eminently
feasible and economical to develop floatable
organic cities of immense size. To visualize the
various design - controlling conditions under
which such cities could be constructed, imag
ine pinching a camera tripod's legs together,
taking hold of the bottom of the tripod in one
hand and trying to hold it vertically on the top
of an automobile going 70 miles an hour, over
rough terrain. As you opened the legs of the
tripod—each time you spread them—the tri
pod would get steadier and steadier. This is
the stabilizing effect obtained when tension
stays are rigged from top to bottom on three

sides of a mast, as with radio towers. It is
equally effective to have the legs spread out
wardly, as in the Eiffel Tower. When the three
legs are spread apart so that the length of the
edges of their base triangle equals the length
of each of the legs themselves, the tripod at
tains its maximum stability. This conformation
is that of the regular, or equilateral, tetrahe
dron. As the tripod's legs go farther apart than
the regular tetrahedron, its lop can support
less and less load. Thus we learn that the most
stable structure is the regular, equiedged tetra
hedron.
Following this design science clue, we find
that a tetrahedral city to house 1,000,000 peo
ple is both technologically and economically
feasible. Such a hollow tetrahedral city can be
constructed with each of its 300,000 families
having terraced "outside" apartments of 2000
square feet each. The terraces would permit

the storage of mobile trailers, houseboats and
other mobile homes, leaving an additional 1000
square feet for a garden. The living units
would be weatherproofed and would require
no additional "walls," or external skins, to be
fastened onto the tetrahedral city. Such a city
would consist of an open-truss-framework
"structural mountain," whose sides are covered
with parked mobile homes. At night, it would
be ablaze with lights, as are the great petro
leum refineries. All of the organic machinery
necessary to its operation would be housed be
hind the three principal "walls" of the tetra
hedron.
Tetrahedrons are also geometrically unique
in that they grow symmetrically by additions
to any one of their faces. Tetrahedral cities
may start with 1000 occupants and grow to
hold millions without changing their over-all
shape and always providing each family with
2000 square feet of floor space. (The city illus
trating this article, for example, while much
smaller than the model discussed here, is tech
nically identical.) Such a city would be so
structurally efficient and therefore so relatively
light that, together with its foundation —of
of hollow sections of reinforced concrete — it
could float. The model floating city would
measure two miles to an edge. Its foundation
would be 200. feet or more in depth and sev
eral hundred feet wide. On land, the structure
could float in a three-sided moat, which would
make the whole city earthquake-proof. Or the
structure could be floated out into the ocean
to any point and anchored. The depth of its
foundation would go below the turbulent level
of the seas, so that it would be, in effect, a float
ing triangular atoll. Its two-mile base would
provide landing strips for jet airplanes. Its in
terior, two-mile harbor would provide refuge
for the largest ocean vessels.

such 1,000,000 - inhabitant tetrahedral cities

al of materials from obsolete buildings on the
land will permit the production of enough of
these floating cities to dot the oceans of the
earth, at distances negotiable by relatively
small boats. Because their foundations would
be below wave turbulence, such cities would
also permit mid-ocean cargo transfers, extraor
dinarily increasing the efficiency of material
and passenger traffic. The cities would gener
ate their own energy with atomic reactors,
whose by-product heat would be used to de
salinate sea water for the city's water supply.
In short, these habitats would greatly facilitate
both travel of all sorts and the coming large
scale exploitation of the oceans.
In 1954, the United States Marine Corps hel
icopter-lifted a geodesic dome large enough to
house an American family. The latest helicop
ters being built for Vietnam can air-deliver
geodesic domes large enough to cover a foot
ball field, including the end zones, the quarter
mile running track and side bleachers. By 1975,
it will be possible to air-deliver geodesic domes
large enough to cover small cities. (It is now
possible to cover a large city in three months
by delivering large subassemblies of a dome.)
There are already 5000 geodesic domes in 50
countries around the world, many so light and
strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu
larly where antiquities need to be protected.
The domes over our cities will be so high
and their structural members so delicate as to
be nearly invisible. They will bring shadow
when shadow is desirable and sun when sun
is desirable, always keeping out rain, snow and
storms as well as exterior industrial fumes,
while collecting rain water in reservoirs. The
temperature inside the domes will be so sta
bilized that a semitropical atmosphere will ex
ist. Inasmuch as there will be no rain or snow,
people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half
mile in diameter, the weight of the air enclosed
is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a
ratio of 1000 to 1. When the sun shines on an
open-frame aluminum geodesic sphere of one
half-mile diameter, sunlight is reflected by the
concave ininer surface back into the sphere and
gradually heats the interior atmosphere. When
the interior temperature of the sphere rises
only one degree Fahrenheit, the weight of air
pushed out of the sphere is greater than the
weight of the spherical-frame geodesic struc
ture. This means that the total weight of the
interior air, plus the weight of the structure, is

much less than the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con
trol facilities. Nowadays, at international air
port hotels, people with one - to - eight - hour
flight stopovers follow one another in rooms
and beds that are made up as soon as each oc
cupant leaves.. The rooms are occupied, not on
a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation
schedule. Such frequency - modulated occu
pancy of rented space in mobile hotels or in
dwelling machines will become man's funda
mental life pattern.
The great world housing problem is an edu
cational problem. By and large, man's inertias
are overcome only by virtue of his own per
sonal discoveries and his understanding of
what is happening to him. There will be no
instant world housing solutions. There are
fundamental rates at which the educational
gestation takes place. Publishers who try to ex
ploit man's imagination by giving him only the
end-product concepts, without showing how
man will get from here to there, postpone the
opportunities for helping man educate himself
as to how these events may come to pass. I, for
one, am unwilling to allow anyone to be
amused by startling concepts of tetrahedral
cities and air-deliverable Empire State Build
ings while keeping from society the opportu
nity to understand the complex of factors that
lead to such tangible results.
The comprehensive introduction of automa

from being an automaton and will generate so

planet, free to research the bottom of his ocean
and to re-explore earlier patterns of man's life
on earth, will also be swiftly outward-bound to

Within decades, we will know whether man is
going to be a physical success here or is going
to frustrate his own success with his negatively
conditioned reflexes of yesterday — bringing
about his own extinction. My intuitions sense

intuitions will mean nothing unless man learns
to understand and control the forces shaping
him and the new patterns of living available
to him.

I have been asked many times: "What would
you do if you were building commissioner
of the United States or even the entire
world?"
I would resign. I am an inventor and so have
far vaster prerogatives than any politician.
Edison, Bell, Marconi and the Wrights needed
no licenses from anyone to light the night, to
shrink the earth and to interlink all humanity.
So I will pass up any hypothetical political ap
pointment, but will accept the housing chal
lenge as an inventor.
The drawings of the tetrahedral city on
these pages represent an entirely feasible and
practical new way for men to live together eco
nomically. The drawings cannot be under
stood, however, without knowing the trends in
housing and cities that lead up to them. And
their full appreciation requires knowledge, too,
of the importance of technology—and there
fore of the inventor —in human affairs.
Yesterday's capitalists disliked inventors,
who made the capitalists' machines obsolete.
Businessmen were powerful enough to per
suade society that inventors were screwballs.
All that is changing; businessmen now find
change profitable and inventors are becoming
respectable. Inventors pay attention only to
physical laws—which alone govern what man
ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often
lethal biases of politics.
Our higher potentials are unrealized because
environmental conditions have frustrated
man's potentials. We have learned much, how
ever, through recent behavioral - science re
search. For instance, we know that environ
mental conditions determine how much of the
child's total brain potential will blossom into
effectiveness.
Politics undertakes to reform only man, not
his environment. For decades, society has tried
to reduce automobile accidents by reforming
drivers—with arrests, fines, behavioral exhor
tations and laws. I always thought that, in
stead, it is physically possible to prevent acci
dents: by split-level crossings, banked turns
and divided highways. Society has at last un
dertaken to reform the driving environment.
Take away all the inventions from humanity
and, within six months, half of us would die of
starvation and disease. Take away all the poli
ticians and all political ideologies and leave all
the inventions and more would eat and prosper
than do now.
My task as an inventor is to employ the
earth's resources in such a way as to support
all humanity while also enabling all people to
enjoy the whole earth—all of its historical arti
facts and its beautiful places — without one

man interfering with another and without any
man enjoying life at the cost of another.
The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of

these floating cities to dot the oceans of the

and passenger traffic. The cities would gener

whose by-product heat would be used to de
salinate sea water for the city's water supply.
In short, these habitats would greatly facilitate
both travel of all sorts and the coming large
scale exploitation of the oceans.
In 1954, the United States Marine Corps hel
icopter-lifted a geodesic dome large enough to
house an American family. The latest helicop
ters being built for Vietnam can air-deliver
geodesic domes large enough to cover a foot
ball field, including the end zones, the quarter
mile running track and side bleachers. By 1975,
it will be possible to air-deliver geodesic domes
large enough to cover small cities. (It is now
possible to cover a large city in three months
by delivering large subassemblies of a dome.)
There are already 5000 geodesic domes in 50
countries around the world, many so light and
strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu
larly where antiquities need to be protected.
The domes over our cities will be so high
and their structural members so delicate as to
be nearly invisible. They will bring shadow
when shadow is desirable and sun when sun
is desirable, always keeping out rain, snow and
storms as well as exterior industrial fumes,
while collecting rain water in reservoirs. The
temperature inside the domes will be so sta
bilized that a semitropical atmosphere will ex
ist. Inasmuch as there will be no rain or snow,
people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half
mile in diameter, the weight of the air enclosed
is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a
ratio of 1000 to 1. When the sun shines on an
open-frame aluminum geodesic sphere of one
half-mile diameter, sunlight is reflected by the
concave ininer surface back into the sphere and
gradually heats the interior atmosphere. When
the interior temperature of the sphere rises
only one degree Fahrenheit, the weight of air
pushed out of the sphere is greater than the
weight of the spherical-frame geodesic struc
ture. This means that the total weight of the
interior air, plus the weight of the structure, is

much less than the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con
trol facilities. Nowadays, at international air
port hotels, people with one - to - eight - hour
flight stopovers follow one another in rooms
and beds that are made up as soon as each oc
cupant leaves.. The rooms are occupied, not on
a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation
schedule. Such frequency - modulated occu
pancy of rented space in mobile hotels or in
dwelling machines will become man's funda
mental life pattern.
The great world housing problem is an edu
cational problem. By and large, man's inertias
are overcome only by virtue of his own per
sonal discoveries and his understanding of
what is happening to him. There will be no

fundamental rates at which the educational

I have been asked many times: "What would
you do if you were building commissioner
of the United States or even the entire
world?"
I would resign. I am an inventor and so have
far vaster prerogatives than any politician.
Edison, Bell, Marconi and the Wrights needed
no licenses from anyone to light the night, to
shrink the earth and to interlink all humanity.
So I will pass up any hypothetical political ap
pointment, but will accept the housing chal
lenge as an inventor.
The drawings of the tetrahedral city on
these pages represent an entirely feasible and
practical new way for men to live together eco
nomically. The drawings cannot be under
stood, however, without knowing the trends in
housing and cities that lead up to them. And
their full appreciation requires knowledge, too,
of the importance of technology—and there
fore of the inventor —in human affairs.
Yesterday's capitalists disliked inventors,
who made the capitalists' machines obsolete.
Businessmen were powerful enough to per
suade society that inventors were screwballs.
All that is changing; businessmen now find
change profitable and inventors are becoming
respectable. Inventors pay attention only to
physical laws—which alone govern what man
ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often
lethal biases of politics.
Our higher potentials are unrealized because
environmental conditions have frustrated
man's potentials. We have learned much, how
ever, through recent behavioral - science re
search. For instance, we know that environ
mental conditions determine how much of the
child's total brain potential will blossom into
effectiveness.
Politics undertakes to reform only man, not
his environment. For decades, society has tried
to reduce automobile accidents by reforming
drivers—with arrests, fines, behavioral exhor
tations and laws. I always thought that, in
stead, it is physically possible to prevent acci
dents: by split-level crossings, banked turns
and divided highways. Society has at last un
dertaken to reform the driving environment.
Take away all the inventions from humanity
and, within six months, half of us would die of
starvation and disease. Take away all the poli
ticians and all political ideologies and leave all
the inventions and more would eat and prosper
than do now.
My task as an inventor is to employ the
earth's resources in such a way as to support
all humanity while also enabling all people to
enjoy the whole earth—all of its historical arti
facts and its beautiful places — without one

man interfering with another and without any
man enjoying life at the cost of another.
The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of
great countries.
Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus


A drawing of the 200-story city superimposed
on a photo of the outskirts of Tokyo vies for
attention with Mount Fuji. This structure
would include transport systems, community
parks, shopping centers in geodesic domes,
and maintenance facilities.
" .. it has been necessary for science to package
human environmental and metabolic-regeneration
systems ... to do so, science must understand man
as a process."

to accomplish this will be contained in a little
black box weighing about 500 pounds and
measuring about 20 cubic feet. With the little
black box, a man in space will be able to re
generate his many organic processes, needing
only small annual additions to the recirculating
chemistry. The first men living comfortably in
space will be watched on TV by billions on
earth. Humanity will be swiftly educated in an
entirely new set of environmental-control me
chanics.
Though the first black box will probably
cost the United States and Russia well over
seven billion dollars, it will be mass-reprodu
cible on earth at around two dollars per pound.
A $1000 box could rent profitably at $200 a
year. An individual or family could take a
black box (costing approximately $18 a
month) and go to any wilderness—mountain
top or island —and enjoy essential services su
perior to those now available in any city com
plex. The black box will constitute the first di
rect application of science to making man a
physical and economic success anywhere in
the universe—which, of course, includes on
earth.
The history of cities points to the same con
clusions as the history of the home (which we
can confidently predict will reach its logical
conclusion with the perfection of the little
black box). Cities developed entirely before
the thought of electricity or automobiles or be
fore any of the millions of inventions registered
in the United States Patent Office. Cities de
veloped as warehouse trading posts. All ware
housing has gone out of the modern city. Ware
housing has become dynamic and now is most
ly done on wheels, wings or in ships. Cities
were later used to house vast hordes of immi
grants to work in the factories, which were also
centered in the cities. Now the factories have
also left the cities obsolete in terms of yester
day's functions. Trying to rebuild them to ac
commodate the new needs of world man is like
trying to reconstruct and improve a wrecked
ship impaled on a reef pounded by surf. The
surf of technical obsolescence is invisible but
much more powerful than the waves of the real
ocean.
A few elementary engineering concepts
point clearly, I believe, to what the new cities
will be like. For example, when we double the
length of an airplane fuselage, we increase its
surface area by four and increase its volume
by eight. The surface area of a ship—rather
than the volume—governs its friction and drag.
The larger the ship, the more economically its
cargo may be carried. Yesterday's airplanes
were limited in size because they required ex
tremely long landing strips. The emerging gen
eration of large airplanes—which will carry
700 to 1000 passengers or more —is being de
signed for vertical take-off and landing, which
does away with the necessity for prepared
landing strips.
To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.
The new Queen Elizabeth is a luxuriously
comfortable abode either at sea or in port. She
is a mobile city. She is shaped to get passengers
across oceans in a hurry. If such floating cities
didn't have to speed, they might have an effi
ciently symmetrical shape. It is eminently
feasible and economical to develop floatable
organic cities of immense size. To visualize the
various design - controlling conditions under
which such cities could be constructed, imag
ine pinching a camera tripod's legs together,
taking hold of the bottom of the tripod in one
hand and trying to hold it vertically on the top
of an automobile going 70 miles an hour, over
rough terrain. As you opened the legs of the
tripod—each time you spread them—the tri
pod would get steadier and steadier. This is
the stabilizing effect obtained when tension
stays are rigged from top to bottom on three

sides of a mast, as with radio towers. It is
equally effective to have the legs spread out
wardly, as in the Eiffel Tower. When the three
legs are spread apart so that the length of the
edges of their base triangle equals the length
of each of the legs themselves, the tripod at
tains its maximum stability. This conformation
is that of the regular, or equilateral, tetrahe
dron. As the tripod's legs go farther apart than
the regular tetrahedron, its lop can support
less and less load. Thus we learn that the most
stable structure is the regular, equiedged tetra
hedron.
Following this design science clue, we find
that a tetrahedral city to house 1,000,000 peo
ple is both technologically and economically
feasible. Such a hollow tetrahedral city can be
constructed with each of its 300,000 families
having terraced "outside" apartments of 2000
square feet each. The terraces would permit

the storage of mobile trailers, houseboats and
other mobile homes, leaving an additional 1000
square feet for a garden. The living units
would be weatherproofed and would require
no additional "walls," or external skins, to be
fastened onto the tetrahedral city. Such a city
would consist of an open-truss-framework
"structural mountain," whose sides are covered
with parked mobile homes. At night, it would
be ablaze with lights, as are the great petro
leum refineries. All of the organic machinery
necessary to its operation would be housed be
hind the three principal "walls" of the tetra
hedron.
Tetrahedrons are also geometrically unique
in that they grow symmetrically by additions
to any one of their faces. Tetrahedral cities
may start with 1000 occupants and grow to
hold millions without changing their over-all
shape and always providing each family with
2000 square feet of floor space. (The city illus
trating this article, for example, while much
smaller than the model discussed here, is tech
nically identical.) Such a city would be so
structurally efficient and therefore so relatively
light that, together with its foundation —of
of hollow sections of reinforced concrete — it
could float. The model floating city would
measure two miles to an edge. Its foundation
would be 200. feet or more in depth and sev
eral hundred feet wide. On land, the structure
could float in a three-sided moat, which would
make the whole city earthquake-proof. Or the
structure could be floated out into the ocean
to any point and anchored. The depth of its
foundation would go below the turbulent level
of the seas, so that it would be, in effect, a float
ing triangular atoll. Its two-mile base would
provide landing strips for jet airplanes. Its in
terior, two-mile harbor would provide refuge
for the largest ocean vessels.
The total structural and mechanical mate
rials involved in production of a number of
such 1,000,000 - inhabitant tetrahedral cities
are within the capabilities of several compa
nies in the major industrial nations. Withdraw-

ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often
lethal biases of politics.
Our higher potentials are unrealized because
environmental conditions have frustrated
man's potentials. We have learned much, how
ever, through recent behavioral - science re
search. For instance, we know that environ
mental conditions determine how much of the
child's total brain potential will blossom into
effectiveness.
Politics undertakes to reform only man, not
his environment. For decades, society has tried
to reduce automobile accidents by reforming
drivers—with arrests, fines, behavioral exhor
tations and laws. I always thought that, in
stead, it is physically possible to prevent acci
dents: by split-level crossings, banked turns
and divided highways. Society has at last un
dertaken to reform the driving environment.
Take away all the inventions from humanity
and, within six months, half of us would die of
starvation and disease. Take away all the poli
ticians and all political ideologies and leave all
the inventions and more would eat and prosper
than do now.
My task as an inventor is to employ the
earth's resources in such a way as to support
all humanity while also enabling all people to
enjoy the whole earth—all of its historical arti
facts and its beautiful places — without one

man interfering with another and without any
man enjoying life at the cost of another.
The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of
great countries.
Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus

to accomplish this will be contained in a little
black box weighing about 500 pounds and
measuring about 20 cubic feet. With the little
black box, a man in space will be able to re
generate his many organic processes, needing
only small annual additions to the recirculating
chemistry. The first men living comfortably in
space will be watched on TV by billions on
earth. Humanity will be swiftly educated in an
entirely new set of environmental-control me
chanics.
Though the first black box will probably
cost the United States and Russia well over
seven billion dollars, it will be mass-reprodu
cible on earth at around two dollars per pound.
A $1000 box could rent profitably at $200 a
year. An individual or family could take a
black box (costing approximately $18 a
month) and go to any wilderness—mountain
top or island —and enjoy essential services su
perior to those now available in any city com
plex. The black box will constitute the first di
rect application of science to making man a
physical and economic success anywhere in
the universe—which, of course, includes on
earth.
The history of cities points to the same con
clusions as the history of the home (which we
can confidently predict will reach its logical
conclusion with the perfection of the little
black box). Cities developed entirely before
the thought of electricity or automobiles or be
fore any of the millions of inventions registered
in the United States Patent Office. Cities de
veloped as warehouse trading posts. All ware
housing has gone out of the modern city. Ware
housing has become dynamic and now is most
ly done on wheels, wings or in ships. Cities
were later used to house vast hordes of immi
grants to work in the factories, which were also
centered in the cities. Now the factories have
also left the cities obsolete in terms of yester
day's functions. Trying to rebuild them to ac
commodate the new needs of world man is like
trying to reconstruct and improve a wrecked
ship impaled on a reef pounded by surf. The
surf of technical obsolescence is invisible but
much more powerful than the waves of the real
ocean.
A few elementary engineering concepts
point clearly, I believe, to what the new cities
will be like. For example, when we double the
length of an airplane fuselage, we increase its
surface area by four and increase its volume
by eight. The surface area of a ship—rather
than the volume—governs its friction and drag.
The larger the ship, the more economically its
cargo may be carried. Yesterday's airplanes
were limited in size because they required ex
tremely long landing strips. The emerging gen
eration of large airplanes—which will carry
700 to 1000 passengers or more —is being de
signed for vertical take-off and landing, which
does away with the necessity for prepared
landing strips.
To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.
The new Queen Elizabeth is a luxuriously
comfortable abode either at sea or in port. She
is a mobile city. She is shaped to get passengers
across oceans in a hurry. If such floating cities
didn't have to speed, they might have an effi
ciently symmetrical shape. It is eminently
feasible and economical to develop floatable
organic cities of immense size. To visualize the
various design - controlling conditions under
which such cities could be constructed, imag
ine pinching a camera tripod's legs together,
taking hold of the bottom of the tripod in one
hand and trying to hold it vertically on the top
of an automobile going 70 miles an hour, over
rough terrain. As you opened the legs of the
tripod—each time you spread them—the tri
pod would get steadier and steadier. This is
the stabilizing effect obtained when tension
stays are rigged from top to bottom on three

sides of a mast, as with radio towers. It is
equally effective to have the legs spread out
wardly, as in the Eiffel Tower. When the three
legs are spread apart so that the length of the
edges of their base triangle equals the length
of each of the legs themselves, the tripod at
tains its maximum stability. This conformation
is that of the regular, or equilateral, tetrahe
dron. As the tripod's legs go farther apart than
the regular tetrahedron, its lop can support
less and less load. Thus we learn that the most
stable structure is the regular, equiedged tetra
hedron.
Following this design science clue, we find
that a tetrahedral city to house 1,000,000 peo
ple is both technologically and economically
feasible. Such a hollow tetrahedral city can be
constructed with each of its 300,000 families
having terraced "outside" apartments of 2000
square feet each. The terraces would permit

the storage of mobile trailers, houseboats and
other mobile homes, leaving an additional 1000
square feet for a garden. The living units
would be weatherproofed and would require
no additional "walls," or external skins, to be
fastened onto the tetrahedral city. Such a city
would consist of an open-truss-framework
"structural mountain," whose sides are covered
with parked mobile homes. At night, it would
be ablaze with lights, as are the great petro
leum refineries. All of the organic machinery
necessary to its operation would be housed be
hind the three principal "walls" of the tetra
hedron.
Tetrahedrons are also geometrically unique
in that they grow symmetrically by additions
to any one of their faces. Tetrahedral cities
may start with 1000 occupants and grow to
hold millions without changing their over-all
shape and always providing each family with
2000 square feet of floor space. (The city illus
trating this article, for example, while much
smaller than the model discussed here, is tech
nically identical.) Such a city would be so
structurally efficient and therefore so relatively
light that, together with its foundation —of
of hollow sections of reinforced concrete — it
could float. The model floating city would
measure two miles to an edge. Its foundation
would be 200. feet or more in depth and sev
eral hundred feet wide. On land, the structure
could float in a three-sided moat, which would
make the whole city earthquake-proof. Or the
structure could be floated out into the ocean
to any point and anchored. The depth of its
foundation would go below the turbulent level
of the seas, so that it would be, in effect, a float
ing triangular atoll. Its two-mile base would
provide landing strips for jet airplanes. Its in
terior, two-mile harbor would provide refuge
for the largest ocean vessels.
The total structural and mechanical mate
rials involved in production of a number of
such 1,000,000 - inhabitant tetrahedral cities
are within the capabilities of several compa
nies in the major industrial nations. Withdraw-

al of materials from obsolete buildings on the
land will permit the production of enough of
these floating cities to dot the oceans of the
earth, at distances negotiable by relatively
small boats. Because their foundations would
be below wave turbulence, such cities would
also permit mid-ocean cargo transfers, extraor
dinarily increasing the efficiency of material
and passenger traffic. The cities would gener
ate their own energy with atomic reactors,
whose by-product heat would be used to de
salinate sea water for the city's water supply.
In short, these habitats would greatly facilitate
both travel of all sorts and the coming large
scale exploitation of the oceans.
In 1954, the United States Marine Corps hel
icopter-lifted a geodesic dome large enough to
house an American family. The latest helicop
ters being built for Vietnam can air-deliver
geodesic domes large enough to cover a foot
ball field, including the end zones, the quarter
mile running track and side bleachers. By 1975,
it will be possible to air-deliver geodesic domes
large enough to cover small cities. (It is now
possible to cover a large city in three months
by delivering large subassemblies of a dome.)
There are already 5000 geodesic domes in 50
countries around the world, many so light and
strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu
larly where antiquities need to be protected.
The domes over our cities will be so high
and their structural members so delicate as to
be nearly invisible. They will bring shadow
when shadow is desirable and sun when sun
is desirable, always keeping out rain, snow and
storms as well as exterior industrial fumes,
while collecting rain water in reservoirs. The
temperature inside the domes will be so sta
bilized that a semitropical atmosphere will ex
ist. Inasmuch as there will be no rain or snow,
people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half
mile in diameter, the weight of the air enclosed
is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a
ratio of 1000 to 1. When the sun shines on an
open-frame aluminum geodesic sphere of one
half-mile diameter, sunlight is reflected by the
concave ininer surface back into the sphere and
gradually heats the interior atmosphere. When
the interior temperature of the sphere rises
only one degree Fahrenheit, the weight of air
pushed out of the sphere is greater than the
weight of the spherical-frame geodesic struc
ture. This means that the total weight of the
interior air, plus the weight of the structure, is

much less than the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con
trol facilities. Nowadays, at international air
port hotels, people with one - to - eight - hour
flight stopovers follow one another in rooms
and beds that are made up as soon as each oc
cupant leaves.. The rooms are occupied, not on
a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation
schedule. Such frequency - modulated occu
pancy of rented space in mobile hotels or in
dwelling machines will become man's funda
mental life pattern.
The great world housing problem is an edu
cational problem. By and large, man's inertias
are overcome only by virtue of his own per
sonal discoveries and his understanding of
what is happening to him. There will be no
instant world housing solutions. There are
fundamental rates at which the educational
gestation takes place. Publishers who try to ex
ploit man's imagination by giving him only the
end-product concepts, without showing how
man will get from here to there, postpone the
opportunities for helping man educate himself
as to how these events may come to pass. I, for
one, am unwilling to allow anyone to be
amused by startling concepts of tetrahedral
cities and air-deliverable Empire State Build
ings while keeping from society the opportu
nity to understand the complex of factors that
lead to such tangible results.
The comprehensive introduction of automa
tion everywhere around the earth will free man
from being an automaton and will generate so
rapid a mastery and multiplication of energy

planet, free to research the bottom of his ocean
and to re-explore earlier patterns of man's life
on earth, will also be swiftly outward-bound to

Within decades, we will know whether man is
going to be a physical success here or is going
to frustrate his own success with his negatively
conditioned reflexes of yesterday — bringing
about his own extinction. My intuitions sense

intuitions will mean nothing unless man learns
to understand and control the forces shaping

I have been asked many times: "What would
you do if you were building commissioner
of the United States or even the entire
world?"
I would resign. I am an inventor and so have
far vaster prerogatives than any politician.
Edison, Bell, Marconi and the Wrights needed
no licenses from anyone to light the night, to
shrink the earth and to interlink all humanity.
So I will pass up any hypothetical political ap
pointment, but will accept the housing chal
lenge as an inventor.
The drawings of the tetrahedral city on
these pages represent an entirely feasible and
practical new way for men to live together eco
nomically. The drawings cannot be under
stood, however, without knowing the trends in
housing and cities that lead up to them. And
their full appreciation requires knowledge, too,
of the importance of technology—and there
fore of the inventor —in human affairs.
Yesterday's capitalists disliked inventors,
who made the capitalists' machines obsolete.
Businessmen were powerful enough to per
suade society that inventors were screwballs.
All that is changing; businessmen now find
change profitable and inventors are becoming
respectable. Inventors pay attention only to
physical laws—which alone govern what man
ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often

can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.
The new Queen Elizabeth is a luxuriously
comfortable abode either at sea or in port. She
is a mobile city. She is shaped to get passengers
across oceans in a hurry. If such floating cities
didn't have to speed, they might have an effi
ciently symmetrical shape. It is eminently
feasible and economical to develop floatable
organic cities of immense size. To visualize the
various design - controlling conditions under
which such cities could be constructed, imag
ine pinching a camera tripod's legs together,
taking hold of the bottom of the tripod in one
hand and trying to hold it vertically on the top
of an automobile going 70 miles an hour, over
rough terrain. As you opened the legs of the
tripod—each time you spread them—the tri
pod would get steadier and steadier. This is
the stabilizing effect obtained when tension
stays are rigged from top to bottom on three

sides of a mast, as with radio towers. It is
equally effective to have the legs spread out
wardly, as in the Eiffel Tower. When the three
legs are spread apart so that the length of the
edges of their base triangle equals the length
of each of the legs themselves, the tripod at
tains its maximum stability. This conformation
is that of the regular, or equilateral, tetrahe
dron. As the tripod's legs go farther apart than
the regular tetrahedron, its lop can support
less and less load. Thus we learn that the most
stable structure is the regular, equiedged tetra
hedron.
Following this design science clue, we find
that a tetrahedral city to house 1,000,000 peo
ple is both technologically and economically
feasible. Such a hollow tetrahedral city can be
constructed with each of its 300,000 families
having terraced "outside" apartments of 2000
square feet each. The terraces would permit

the storage of mobile trailers, houseboats and
other mobile homes, leaving an additional 1000
square feet for a garden. The living units
would be weatherproofed and would require
no additional "walls," or external skins, to be
fastened onto the tetrahedral city. Such a city
would consist of an open-truss-framework
"structural mountain," whose sides are covered
with parked mobile homes. At night, it would
be ablaze with lights, as are the great petro
leum refineries. All of the organic machinery
necessary to its operation would be housed be
hind the three principal "walls" of the tetra
hedron.
Tetrahedrons are also geometrically unique
in that they grow symmetrically by additions
to any one of their faces. Tetrahedral cities
may start with 1000 occupants and grow to
hold millions without changing their over-all
shape and always providing each family with
2000 square feet of floor space. (The city illus
trating this article, for example, while much
smaller than the model discussed here, is tech
nically identical.) Such a city would be so
structurally efficient and therefore so relatively
light that, together with its foundation —of
of hollow sections of reinforced concrete — it
could float. The model floating city would
measure two miles to an edge. Its foundation
would be 200. feet or more in depth and sev
eral hundred feet wide. On land, the structure
could float in a three-sided moat, which would
make the whole city earthquake-proof. Or the
structure could be floated out into the ocean
to any point and anchored. The depth of its
foundation would go below the turbulent level
of the seas, so that it would be, in effect, a float
ing triangular atoll. Its two-mile base would
provide landing strips for jet airplanes. Its in
terior, two-mile harbor would provide refuge
for the largest ocean vessels.

al of materials from obsolete buildings on the
land will permit the production of enough of
these floating cities to dot the oceans of the
earth, at distances negotiable by relatively
small boats. Because their foundations would
be below wave turbulence, such cities would
also permit mid-ocean cargo transfers, extraor
dinarily increasing the efficiency of material
and passenger traffic. The cities would gener
ate their own energy with atomic reactors,
whose by-product heat would be used to de
salinate sea water for the city's water supply.
In short, these habitats would greatly facilitate
both travel of all sorts and the coming large
scale exploitation of the oceans.
In 1954, the United States Marine Corps hel
icopter-lifted a geodesic dome large enough to
house an American family. The latest helicop
ters being built for Vietnam can air-deliver
geodesic domes large enough to cover a foot
ball field, including the end zones, the quarter
mile running track and side bleachers. By 1975,
it will be possible to air-deliver geodesic domes
large enough to cover small cities. (It is now
possible to cover a large city in three months
by delivering large subassemblies of a dome.)
There are already 5000 geodesic domes in 50
countries around the world, many so light and
strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu
larly where antiquities need to be protected.
The domes over our cities will be so high
and their structural members so delicate as to
be nearly invisible. They will bring shadow
when shadow is desirable and sun when sun
is desirable, always keeping out rain, snow and
storms as well as exterior industrial fumes,
while collecting rain water in reservoirs. The
temperature inside the domes will be so sta
bilized that a semitropical atmosphere will ex
ist. Inasmuch as there will be no rain or snow,
people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half
mile in diameter, the weight of the air enclosed
is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a
ratio of 1000 to 1. When the sun shines on an
open-frame aluminum geodesic sphere of one
half-mile diameter, sunlight is reflected by the
concave ininer surface back into the sphere and
gradually heats the interior atmosphere. When
the interior temperature of the sphere rises
only one degree Fahrenheit, the weight of air
pushed out of the sphere is greater than the
weight of the spherical-frame geodesic struc
ture. This means that the total weight of the
interior air, plus the weight of the structure, is

much less than the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con
trol facilities. Nowadays, at international air
port hotels, people with one - to - eight - hour
flight stopovers follow one another in rooms
and beds that are made up as soon as each oc
cupant leaves.. The rooms are occupied, not on
a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation
schedule. Such frequency - modulated occu
pancy of rented space in mobile hotels or in
dwelling machines will become man's funda
mental life pattern.
The great world housing problem is an edu
cational problem. By and large, man's inertias
are overcome only by virtue of his own per
sonal discoveries and his understanding of
what is happening to him. There will be no
instant world housing solutions. There are
fundamental rates at which the educational
gestation takes place. Publishers who try to ex
ploit man's imagination by giving him only the
end-product concepts, without showing how
man will get from here to there, postpone the
opportunities for helping man educate himself
as to how these events may come to pass. I, for
one, am unwilling to allow anyone to be
amused by startling concepts of tetrahedral
cities and air-deliverable Empire State Build
ings while keeping from society the opportu
nity to understand the complex of factors that
lead to such tangible results.

planet, free to research the bottom of his ocean
and to re-explore earlier patterns of man's life
on earth, will also be swiftly outward-bound to

Within decades, we will know whether man is
going to be a physical success here or is going
to frustrate his own success with his negatively
conditioned reflexes of yesterday — bringing
about his own extinction. My intuitions sense

intuitions will mean nothing unless man learns
to understand and control the forces shaping
him and the new patterns of living available
to him.

I have been asked many times: "What would
you do if you were building commissioner
of the United States or even the entire
world?"
I would resign. I am an inventor and so have
far vaster prerogatives than any politician.
Edison, Bell, Marconi and the Wrights needed
no licenses from anyone to light the night, to
shrink the earth and to interlink all humanity.
So I will pass up any hypothetical political ap
pointment, but will accept the housing chal
lenge as an inventor.
The drawings of the tetrahedral city on
these pages represent an entirely feasible and
practical new way for men to live together eco
nomically. The drawings cannot be under
stood, however, without knowing the trends in
housing and cities that lead up to them. And
their full appreciation requires knowledge, too,
of the importance of technology—and there
fore of the inventor —in human affairs.
Yesterday's capitalists disliked inventors,
who made the capitalists' machines obsolete.
Businessmen were powerful enough to per
suade society that inventors were screwballs.
All that is changing; businessmen now find
change profitable and inventors are becoming
respectable. Inventors pay attention only to
physical laws—which alone govern what man
ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often
lethal biases of politics.
Our higher potentials are unrealized because
environmental conditions have frustrated
man's potentials. We have learned much, how
ever, through recent behavioral - science re
search. For instance, we know that environ
mental conditions determine how much of the
child's total brain potential will blossom into
effectiveness.
Politics undertakes to reform only man, not
his environment. For decades, society has tried
to reduce automobile accidents by reforming
drivers—with arrests, fines, behavioral exhor
tations and laws. I always thought that, in
stead, it is physically possible to prevent acci
dents: by split-level crossings, banked turns
and divided highways. Society has at last un
dertaken to reform the driving environment.
Take away all the inventions from humanity
and, within six months, half of us would die of
starvation and disease. Take away all the poli
ticians and all political ideologies and leave all
the inventions and more would eat and prosper
than do now.
My task as an inventor is to employ the
earth's resources in such a way as to support
all humanity while also enabling all people to
enjoy the whole earth—all of its historical arti
facts and its beautiful places — without one

man interfering with another and without any
man enjoying life at the cost of another.
The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of
great countries.
Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus


A drawing of the 200-story city superimposed
on a photo of the outskirts of Tokyo vies for
attention with Mount Fuji. This structure
would include transport systems, community
parks, shopping centers in geodesic domes,
and maintenance facilities.

human environmental and metabolic-regeneration
systems ... to do so, science must understand man
as a process."

to accomplish this will be contained in a little
black box weighing about 500 pounds and
measuring about 20 cubic feet. With the little
black box, a man in space will be able to re
generate his many organic processes, needing
only small annual additions to the recirculating
chemistry. The first men living comfortably in
space will be watched on TV by billions on
earth. Humanity will be swiftly educated in an
entirely new set of environmental-control me
chanics.
Though the first black box will probably
cost the United States and Russia well over
seven billion dollars, it will be mass-reprodu
cible on earth at around two dollars per pound.
A $1000 box could rent profitably at $200 a
year. An individual or family could take a
black box (costing approximately $18 a
month) and go to any wilderness—mountain
top or island —and enjoy essential services su
perior to those now available in any city com
plex. The black box will constitute the first di
rect application of science to making man a
physical and economic success anywhere in
the universe—which, of course, includes on
earth.
The history of cities points to the same con
clusions as the history of the home (which we
can confidently predict will reach its logical
conclusion with the perfection of the little
black box). Cities developed entirely before
the thought of electricity or automobiles or be
fore any of the millions of inventions registered
in the United States Patent Office. Cities de
veloped as warehouse trading posts. All ware
housing has gone out of the modern city. Ware
housing has become dynamic and now is most
ly done on wheels, wings or in ships. Cities
were later used to house vast hordes of immi
grants to work in the factories, which were also
centered in the cities. Now the factories have
also left the cities obsolete in terms of yester
day's functions. Trying to rebuild them to ac
commodate the new needs of world man is like
trying to reconstruct and improve a wrecked
ship impaled on a reef pounded by surf. The
surf of technical obsolescence is invisible but
much more powerful than the waves of the real
ocean.
A few elementary engineering concepts
point clearly, I believe, to what the new cities
will be like. For example, when we double the
length of an airplane fuselage, we increase its
surface area by four and increase its volume
by eight. The surface area of a ship—rather
than the volume—governs its friction and drag.
The larger the ship, the more economically its
cargo may be carried. Yesterday's airplanes
were limited in size because they required ex
tremely long landing strips. The emerging gen
eration of large airplanes—which will carry
700 to 1000 passengers or more —is being de
signed for vertical take-off and landing, which
does away with the necessity for prepared
landing strips.
To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.

"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con
trol facilities. Nowadays, at international air
port hotels, people with one - to - eight - hour
flight stopovers follow one another in rooms
and beds that are made up as soon as each oc
cupant leaves.. The rooms are occupied, not on
a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation
schedule. Such frequency - modulated occu
pancy of rented space in mobile hotels or in
dwelling machines will become man's funda
mental life pattern.
The great world housing problem is an edu
cational problem. By and large, man's inertias
are overcome only by virtue of his own per
sonal discoveries and his understanding of
what is happening to him. There will be no
instant world housing solutions. There are
fundamental rates at which the educational
gestation takes place. Publishers who try to ex
ploit man's imagination by giving him only the
end-product concepts, without showing how
man will get from here to there, postpone the
opportunities for helping man educate himself
as to how these events may come to pass. I, for
one, am unwilling to allow anyone to be
amused by startling concepts of tetrahedral
cities and air-deliverable Empire State Build

lead to such tangible results.

I have been asked many times: "What would
you do if you were building commissioner
of the United States or even the entire
world?"
I would resign. I am an inventor and so have
far vaster prerogatives than any politician.
Edison, Bell, Marconi and the Wrights needed
no licenses from anyone to light the night, to
shrink the earth and to interlink all humanity.
So I will pass up any hypothetical political ap
pointment, but will accept the housing chal
lenge as an inventor.
The drawings of the tetrahedral city on
these pages represent an entirely feasible and
practical new way for men to live together eco
nomically. The drawings cannot be under
stood, however, without knowing the trends in
housing and cities that lead up to them. And
their full appreciation requires knowledge, too,
of the importance of technology—and there
fore of the inventor —in human affairs.
Yesterday's capitalists disliked inventors,
who made the capitalists' machines obsolete.
Businessmen were powerful enough to per
suade society that inventors were screwballs.
All that is changing; businessmen now find
change profitable and inventors are becoming
respectable. Inventors pay attention only to
physical laws—which alone govern what man
ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often
lethal biases of politics.
Our higher potentials are unrealized because
environmental conditions have frustrated
man's potentials. We have learned much, how
ever, through recent behavioral - science re
search. For instance, we know that environ
mental conditions determine how much of the
child's total brain potential will blossom into
effectiveness.
Politics undertakes to reform only man, not
his environment. For decades, society has tried
to reduce automobile accidents by reforming
drivers—with arrests, fines, behavioral exhor
tations and laws. I always thought that, in
stead, it is physically possible to prevent acci
dents: by split-level crossings, banked turns
and divided highways. Society has at last un
dertaken to reform the driving environment.
Take away all the inventions from humanity
and, within six months, half of us would die of
starvation and disease. Take away all the poli
ticians and all political ideologies and leave all
the inventions and more would eat and prosper
than do now.
My task as an inventor is to employ the
earth's resources in such a way as to support
all humanity while also enabling all people to
enjoy the whole earth—all of its historical arti
facts and its beautiful places — without one

man interfering with another and without any
man enjoying life at the cost of another.
The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of
great countries.
Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus

systems ... to do so, science must understand man

to accomplish this will be contained in a little
black box weighing about 500 pounds and
measuring about 20 cubic feet. With the little
black box, a man in space will be able to re
generate his many organic processes, needing
only small annual additions to the recirculating
chemistry. The first men living comfortably in
space will be watched on TV by billions on
earth. Humanity will be swiftly educated in an
entirely new set of environmental-control me
chanics.
Though the first black box will probably
cost the United States and Russia well over
seven billion dollars, it will be mass-reprodu
cible on earth at around two dollars per pound.
A $1000 box could rent profitably at $200 a
year. An individual or family could take a
black box (costing approximately $18 a
month) and go to any wilderness—mountain
top or island —and enjoy essential services su
perior to those now available in any city com
plex. The black box will constitute the first di
rect application of science to making man a
physical and economic success anywhere in
the universe—which, of course, includes on
earth.
The history of cities points to the same con
clusions as the history of the home (which we
can confidently predict will reach its logical
conclusion with the perfection of the little
black box). Cities developed entirely before
the thought of electricity or automobiles or be
fore any of the millions of inventions registered
in the United States Patent Office. Cities de
veloped as warehouse trading posts. All ware
housing has gone out of the modern city. Ware
housing has become dynamic and now is most
ly done on wheels, wings or in ships. Cities
were later used to house vast hordes of immi
grants to work in the factories, which were also
centered in the cities. Now the factories have
also left the cities obsolete in terms of yester
day's functions. Trying to rebuild them to ac
commodate the new needs of world man is like
trying to reconstruct and improve a wrecked
ship impaled on a reef pounded by surf. The
surf of technical obsolescence is invisible but
much more powerful than the waves of the real
ocean.
A few elementary engineering concepts
point clearly, I believe, to what the new cities
will be like. For example, when we double the
length of an airplane fuselage, we increase its
surface area by four and increase its volume
by eight. The surface area of a ship—rather
than the volume—governs its friction and drag.
The larger the ship, the more economically its
cargo may be carried. Yesterday's airplanes
were limited in size because they required ex
tremely long landing strips. The emerging gen
eration of large airplanes—which will carry
700 to 1000 passengers or more —is being de
signed for vertical take-off and landing, which
does away with the necessity for prepared
landing strips.
To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.
The new Queen Elizabeth is a luxuriously
comfortable abode either at sea or in port. She
is a mobile city. She is shaped to get passengers
across oceans in a hurry. If such floating cities
didn't have to speed, they might have an effi
ciently symmetrical shape. It is eminently
feasible and economical to develop floatable
organic cities of immense size. To visualize the
various design - controlling conditions under
which such cities could be constructed, imag
ine pinching a camera tripod's legs together,
taking hold of the bottom of the tripod in one
hand and trying to hold it vertically on the top
of an automobile going 70 miles an hour, over
rough terrain. As you opened the legs of the
tripod—each time you spread them—the tri
pod would get steadier and steadier. This is
the stabilizing effect obtained when tension
stays are rigged from top to bottom on three

sides of a mast, as with radio towers. It is
equally effective to have the legs spread out
wardly, as in the Eiffel Tower. When the three
legs are spread apart so that the length of the
edges of their base triangle equals the length
of each of the legs themselves, the tripod at
tains its maximum stability. This conformation
is that of the regular, or equilateral, tetrahe
dron. As the tripod's legs go farther apart than
the regular tetrahedron, its lop can support
less and less load. Thus we learn that the most
stable structure is the regular, equiedged tetra
hedron.
Following this design science clue, we find
that a tetrahedral city to house 1,000,000 peo
ple is both technologically and economically
feasible. Such a hollow tetrahedral city can be
constructed with each of its 300,000 families
having terraced "outside" apartments of 2000
square feet each. The terraces would permit

the storage of mobile trailers, houseboats and
other mobile homes, leaving an additional 1000
square feet for a garden. The living units
would be weatherproofed and would require
no additional "walls," or external skins, to be
fastened onto the tetrahedral city. Such a city
would consist of an open-truss-framework
"structural mountain," whose sides are covered
with parked mobile homes. At night, it would
be ablaze with lights, as are the great petro
leum refineries. All of the organic machinery
necessary to its operation would be housed be
hind the three principal "walls" of the tetra
hedron.
Tetrahedrons are also geometrically unique
in that they grow symmetrically by additions
to any one of their faces. Tetrahedral cities
may start with 1000 occupants and grow to
hold millions without changing their over-all
shape and always providing each family with
2000 square feet of floor space. (The city illus
trating this article, for example, while much
smaller than the model discussed here, is tech
nically identical.) Such a city would be so
structurally efficient and therefore so relatively
light that, together with its foundation —of
of hollow sections of reinforced concrete — it
could float. The model floating city would
measure two miles to an edge. Its foundation
would be 200. feet or more in depth and sev
eral hundred feet wide. On land, the structure
could float in a three-sided moat, which would
make the whole city earthquake-proof. Or the
structure could be floated out into the ocean
to any point and anchored. The depth of its
foundation would go below the turbulent level
of the seas, so that it would be, in effect, a float
ing triangular atoll. Its two-mile base would
provide landing strips for jet airplanes. Its in
terior, two-mile harbor would provide refuge
for the largest ocean vessels.
The total structural and mechanical mate
rials involved in production of a number of
such 1,000,000 - inhabitant tetrahedral cities
are within the capabilities of several compa
nies in the major industrial nations. Withdraw-

"The total structural and mechanical materials involved in production of a
number of such million-inhabitant tetrahedral cities are within the capabil
ities of several companies in the major industrial nations."

al of materials from obsolete buildings on the
land will permit the production of enough of
these floating cities to dot the oceans of the
earth, at distances negotiable by relatively
small boats. Because their foundations would
be below wave turbulence, such cities would
also permit mid-ocean cargo transfers, extraor
dinarily increasing the efficiency of material
and passenger traffic. The cities would gener
ate their own energy with atomic reactors,
whose by-product heat would be used to de
salinate sea water for the city's water supply.
In short, these habitats would greatly facilitate
both travel of all sorts and the coming large
scale exploitation of the oceans.
In 1954, the United States Marine Corps hel
icopter-lifted a geodesic dome large enough to
house an American family. The latest helicop
ters being built for Vietnam can air-deliver
geodesic domes large enough to cover a foot
ball field, including the end zones, the quarter
mile running track and side bleachers. By 1975,
it will be possible to air-deliver geodesic domes
large enough to cover small cities. (It is now
possible to cover a large city in three months
by delivering large subassemblies of a dome.)
There are already 5000 geodesic domes in 50
countries around the world, many so light and
strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu
larly where antiquities need to be protected.
The domes over our cities will be so high
and their structural members so delicate as to
be nearly invisible. They will bring shadow
when shadow is desirable and sun when sun
is desirable, always keeping out rain, snow and
storms as well as exterior industrial fumes,
while collecting rain water in reservoirs. The
temperature inside the domes will be so sta
bilized that a semitropical atmosphere will ex
ist. Inasmuch as there will be no rain or snow,
people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half
mile in diameter, the weight of the air enclosed
is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a
ratio of 1000 to 1. When the sun shines on an
open-frame aluminum geodesic sphere of one
half-mile diameter, sunlight is reflected by the
concave ininer surface back into the sphere and
gradually heats the interior atmosphere. When
the interior temperature of the sphere rises
only one degree Fahrenheit, the weight of air
pushed out of the sphere is greater than the
weight of the spherical-frame geodesic struc
ture. This means that the total weight of the
interior air, plus the weight of the structure, is

much less than the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con

a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation

measuring about 20 cubic feet. With the little
black box, a man in space will be able to re
generate his many organic processes, needing
only small annual additions to the recirculating
chemistry. The first men living comfortably in
space will be watched on TV by billions on
earth. Humanity will be swiftly educated in an
entirely new set of environmental-control me
chanics.
Though the first black box will probably
cost the United States and Russia well over
seven billion dollars, it will be mass-reprodu
cible on earth at around two dollars per pound.
A $1000 box could rent profitably at $200 a
year. An individual or family could take a
black box (costing approximately $18 a
month) and go to any wilderness—mountain
top or island —and enjoy essential services su
perior to those now available in any city com
plex. The black box will constitute the first di
rect application of science to making man a
physical and economic success anywhere in
the universe—which, of course, includes on
earth.
The history of cities points to the same con
clusions as the history of the home (which we
can confidently predict will reach its logical
conclusion with the perfection of the little
black box). Cities developed entirely before
the thought of electricity or automobiles or be
fore any of the millions of inventions registered
in the United States Patent Office. Cities de
veloped as warehouse trading posts. All ware
housing has gone out of the modern city. Ware
housing has become dynamic and now is most
ly done on wheels, wings or in ships. Cities
were later used to house vast hordes of immi
grants to work in the factories, which were also
centered in the cities. Now the factories have
also left the cities obsolete in terms of yester
day's functions. Trying to rebuild them to ac
commodate the new needs of world man is like
trying to reconstruct and improve a wrecked
ship impaled on a reef pounded by surf. The
surf of technical obsolescence is invisible but
much more powerful than the waves of the real
ocean.
A few elementary engineering concepts
point clearly, I believe, to what the new cities
will be like. For example, when we double the
length of an airplane fuselage, we increase its
surface area by four and increase its volume
by eight. The surface area of a ship—rather
than the volume—governs its friction and drag.
The larger the ship, the more economically its
cargo may be carried. Yesterday's airplanes
were limited in size because they required ex
tremely long landing strips. The emerging gen
eration of large airplanes—which will carry
700 to 1000 passengers or more —is being de
signed for vertical take-off and landing, which
does away with the necessity for prepared
landing strips.
To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.
The new Queen Elizabeth is a luxuriously
comfortable abode either at sea or in port. She
is a mobile city. She is shaped to get passengers
across oceans in a hurry. If such floating cities
didn't have to speed, they might have an effi
ciently symmetrical shape. It is eminently
feasible and economical to develop floatable
organic cities of immense size. To visualize the
various design - controlling conditions under
which such cities could be constructed, imag
ine pinching a camera tripod's legs together,
taking hold of the bottom of the tripod in one
hand and trying to hold it vertically on the top
of an automobile going 70 miles an hour, over
rough terrain. As you opened the legs of the
tripod—each time you spread them—the tri
pod would get steadier and steadier. This is
the stabilizing effect obtained when tension
stays are rigged from top to bottom on three

sides of a mast, as with radio towers. It is
equally effective to have the legs spread out
wardly, as in the Eiffel Tower. When the three
legs are spread apart so that the length of the
edges of their base triangle equals the length
of each of the legs themselves, the tripod at
tains its maximum stability. This conformation
is that of the regular, or equilateral, tetrahe
dron. As the tripod's legs go farther apart than
the regular tetrahedron, its lop can support
less and less load. Thus we learn that the most
stable structure is the regular, equiedged tetra
hedron.
Following this design science clue, we find
that a tetrahedral city to house 1,000,000 peo
ple is both technologically and economically
feasible. Such a hollow tetrahedral city can be
constructed with each of its 300,000 families
having terraced "outside" apartments of 2000
square feet each. The terraces would permit

the storage of mobile trailers, houseboats and
other mobile homes, leaving an additional 1000
square feet for a garden. The living units
would be weatherproofed and would require
no additional "walls," or external skins, to be
fastened onto the tetrahedral city. Such a city
would consist of an open-truss-framework
"structural mountain," whose sides are covered
with parked mobile homes. At night, it would
be ablaze with lights, as are the great petro
leum refineries. All of the organic machinery
necessary to its operation would be housed be
hind the three principal "walls" of the tetra
hedron.
Tetrahedrons are also geometrically unique
in that they grow symmetrically by additions
to any one of their faces. Tetrahedral cities
may start with 1000 occupants and grow to
hold millions without changing their over-all
shape and always providing each family with
2000 square feet of floor space. (The city illus
trating this article, for example, while much
smaller than the model discussed here, is tech
nically identical.) Such a city would be so
structurally efficient and therefore so relatively
light that, together with its foundation —of
of hollow sections of reinforced concrete — it
could float. The model floating city would
measure two miles to an edge. Its foundation
would be 200. feet or more in depth and sev
eral hundred feet wide. On land, the structure
could float in a three-sided moat, which would
make the whole city earthquake-proof. Or the
structure could be floated out into the ocean
to any point and anchored. The depth of its
foundation would go below the turbulent level
of the seas, so that it would be, in effect, a float
ing triangular atoll. Its two-mile base would
provide landing strips for jet airplanes. Its in
terior, two-mile harbor would provide refuge
for the largest ocean vessels.

al of materials from obsolete buildings on the
land will permit the production of enough of
these floating cities to dot the oceans of the
earth, at distances negotiable by relatively
small boats. Because their foundations would
be below wave turbulence, such cities would
also permit mid-ocean cargo transfers, extraor
dinarily increasing the efficiency of material
and passenger traffic. The cities would gener
ate their own energy with atomic reactors,
whose by-product heat would be used to de
salinate sea water for the city's water supply.
In short, these habitats would greatly facilitate
both travel of all sorts and the coming large
scale exploitation of the oceans.
In 1954, the United States Marine Corps hel
icopter-lifted a geodesic dome large enough to
house an American family. The latest helicop
ters being built for Vietnam can air-deliver
geodesic domes large enough to cover a foot
ball field, including the end zones, the quarter
mile running track and side bleachers. By 1975,
it will be possible to air-deliver geodesic domes
large enough to cover small cities. (It is now
possible to cover a large city in three months
by delivering large subassemblies of a dome.)
There are already 5000 geodesic domes in 50
countries around the world, many so light and
strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu
larly where antiquities need to be protected.
The domes over our cities will be so high
and their structural members so delicate as to
be nearly invisible. They will bring shadow
when shadow is desirable and sun when sun
is desirable, always keeping out rain, snow and
storms as well as exterior industrial fumes,
while collecting rain water in reservoirs. The
temperature inside the domes will be so sta
bilized that a semitropical atmosphere will ex
ist. Inasmuch as there will be no rain or snow,
people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half
mile in diameter, the weight of the air enclosed
is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a
ratio of 1000 to 1. When the sun shines on an
open-frame aluminum geodesic sphere of one
half-mile diameter, sunlight is reflected by the
concave ininer surface back into the sphere and
gradually heats the interior atmosphere. When
the interior temperature of the sphere rises
only one degree Fahrenheit, the weight of air
pushed out of the sphere is greater than the
weight of the spherical-frame geodesic struc
ture. This means that the total weight of the
interior air, plus the weight of the structure, is

much less than the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con
trol facilities. Nowadays, at international air
port hotels, people with one - to - eight - hour
flight stopovers follow one another in rooms
and beds that are made up as soon as each oc
cupant leaves.. The rooms are occupied, not on
a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation
schedule. Such frequency - modulated occu
pancy of rented space in mobile hotels or in
dwelling machines will become man's funda
mental life pattern.
The great world housing problem is an edu
cational problem. By and large, man's inertias
are overcome only by virtue of his own per
sonal discoveries and his understanding of
what is happening to him. There will be no
instant world housing solutions. There are
fundamental rates at which the educational
gestation takes place. Publishers who try to ex
ploit man's imagination by giving him only the
end-product concepts, without showing how
man will get from here to there, postpone the
opportunities for helping man educate himself
as to how these events may come to pass. I, for
one, am unwilling to allow anyone to be
amused by startling concepts of tetrahedral
cities and air-deliverable Empire State Build
ings while keeping from society the opportu
nity to understand the complex of factors that
lead to such tangible results.

and to re-explore earlier patterns of man's life

Within decades, we will know whether man is
going to be a physical success here or is going
to frustrate his own success with his negatively
conditioned reflexes of yesterday — bringing
about his own extinction. My intuitions sense

intuitions will mean nothing unless man learns
to understand and control the forces shaping
him and the new patterns of living available
to him.

I have been asked many times: "What would
you do if you were building commissioner
of the United States or even the entire
world?"
I would resign. I am an inventor and so have
far vaster prerogatives than any politician.
Edison, Bell, Marconi and the Wrights needed
no licenses from anyone to light the night, to
shrink the earth and to interlink all humanity.
So I will pass up any hypothetical political ap
pointment, but will accept the housing chal
lenge as an inventor.
The drawings of the tetrahedral city on
these pages represent an entirely feasible and
practical new way for men to live together eco
nomically. The drawings cannot be under
stood, however, without knowing the trends in
housing and cities that lead up to them. And
their full appreciation requires knowledge, too,
of the importance of technology—and there
fore of the inventor —in human affairs.
Yesterday's capitalists disliked inventors,
who made the capitalists' machines obsolete.
Businessmen were powerful enough to per
suade society that inventors were screwballs.
All that is changing; businessmen now find
change profitable and inventors are becoming
respectable. Inventors pay attention only to
physical laws—which alone govern what man
ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often
lethal biases of politics.
Our higher potentials are unrealized because
environmental conditions have frustrated
man's potentials. We have learned much, how
ever, through recent behavioral - science re
search. For instance, we know that environ
mental conditions determine how much of the
child's total brain potential will blossom into
effectiveness.
Politics undertakes to reform only man, not
his environment. For decades, society has tried
to reduce automobile accidents by reforming
drivers—with arrests, fines, behavioral exhor
tations and laws. I always thought that, in
stead, it is physically possible to prevent acci
dents: by split-level crossings, banked turns
and divided highways. Society has at last un
dertaken to reform the driving environment.
Take away all the inventions from humanity
and, within six months, half of us would die of
starvation and disease. Take away all the poli
ticians and all political ideologies and leave all
the inventions and more would eat and prosper
than do now.
My task as an inventor is to employ the
earth's resources in such a way as to support
all humanity while also enabling all people to
enjoy the whole earth—all of its historical arti
facts and its beautiful places — without one

man interfering with another and without any
man enjoying life at the cost of another.
The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of
great countries.
Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus

strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu
larly where antiquities need to be protected.
The domes over our cities will be so high
and their structural members so delicate as to
be nearly invisible. They will bring shadow
when shadow is desirable and sun when sun
is desirable, always keeping out rain, snow and
storms as well as exterior industrial fumes,
while collecting rain water in reservoirs. The
temperature inside the domes will be so sta
bilized that a semitropical atmosphere will ex
ist. Inasmuch as there will be no rain or snow,
people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half
mile in diameter, the weight of the air enclosed
is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a
ratio of 1000 to 1. When the sun shines on an
open-frame aluminum geodesic sphere of one
half-mile diameter, sunlight is reflected by the
concave ininer surface back into the sphere and
gradually heats the interior atmosphere. When
the interior temperature of the sphere rises
only one degree Fahrenheit, the weight of air
pushed out of the sphere is greater than the
weight of the spherical-frame geodesic struc
ture. This means that the total weight of the
interior air, plus the weight of the structure, is

much less than the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con
trol facilities. Nowadays, at international air
port hotels, people with one - to - eight - hour
flight stopovers follow one another in rooms
and beds that are made up as soon as each oc
cupant leaves.. The rooms are occupied, not on
a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation
schedule. Such frequency - modulated occu
pancy of rented space in mobile hotels or in
dwelling machines will become man's funda
mental life pattern.
The great world housing problem is an edu
cational problem. By and large, man's inertias
are overcome only by virtue of his own per
sonal discoveries and his understanding of
what is happening to him. There will be no
instant world housing solutions. There are
fundamental rates at which the educational
gestation takes place. Publishers who try to ex
ploit man's imagination by giving him only the
end-product concepts, without showing how
man will get from here to there, postpone the
opportunities for helping man educate himself

cities and air-deliverable Empire State Build

lead to such tangible results.

I have been asked many times: "What would
you do if you were building commissioner
of the United States or even the entire
world?"
I would resign. I am an inventor and so have
far vaster prerogatives than any politician.
Edison, Bell, Marconi and the Wrights needed
no licenses from anyone to light the night, to
shrink the earth and to interlink all humanity.
So I will pass up any hypothetical political ap
pointment, but will accept the housing chal
lenge as an inventor.
The drawings of the tetrahedral city on
these pages represent an entirely feasible and
practical new way for men to live together eco
nomically. The drawings cannot be under
stood, however, without knowing the trends in
housing and cities that lead up to them. And
their full appreciation requires knowledge, too,
of the importance of technology—and there
fore of the inventor —in human affairs.
Yesterday's capitalists disliked inventors,
who made the capitalists' machines obsolete.
Businessmen were powerful enough to per
suade society that inventors were screwballs.
All that is changing; businessmen now find
change profitable and inventors are becoming
respectable. Inventors pay attention only to
physical laws—which alone govern what man
ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often
lethal biases of politics.
Our higher potentials are unrealized because
environmental conditions have frustrated
man's potentials. We have learned much, how
ever, through recent behavioral - science re
search. For instance, we know that environ
mental conditions determine how much of the
child's total brain potential will blossom into
effectiveness.
Politics undertakes to reform only man, not
his environment. For decades, society has tried
to reduce automobile accidents by reforming
drivers—with arrests, fines, behavioral exhor
tations and laws. I always thought that, in
stead, it is physically possible to prevent acci
dents: by split-level crossings, banked turns
and divided highways. Society has at last un
dertaken to reform the driving environment.
Take away all the inventions from humanity
and, within six months, half of us would die of
starvation and disease. Take away all the poli
ticians and all political ideologies and leave all
the inventions and more would eat and prosper
than do now.
My task as an inventor is to employ the
earth's resources in such a way as to support
all humanity while also enabling all people to
enjoy the whole earth—all of its historical arti
facts and its beautiful places — without one

man interfering with another and without any
man enjoying life at the cost of another.
The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of
great countries.
Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus


A drawing of the 200-story city superimposed
on a photo of the outskirts of Tokyo vies for
attention with Mount Fuji. This structure
would include transport systems, community
parks, shopping centers in geodesic domes,
and maintenance facilities.
" .. it has been necessary for science to package
human environmental and metabolic-regeneration
systems ... to do so, science must understand man
as a process."

to accomplish this will be contained in a little
black box weighing about 500 pounds and
measuring about 20 cubic feet. With the little
black box, a man in space will be able to re
generate his many organic processes, needing
only small annual additions to the recirculating
chemistry. The first men living comfortably in
space will be watched on TV by billions on
earth. Humanity will be swiftly educated in an
entirely new set of environmental-control me
chanics.
Though the first black box will probably
cost the United States and Russia well over
seven billion dollars, it will be mass-reprodu
cible on earth at around two dollars per pound.
A $1000 box could rent profitably at $200 a
year. An individual or family could take a
black box (costing approximately $18 a
month) and go to any wilderness—mountain
top or island —and enjoy essential services su
perior to those now available in any city com
plex. The black box will constitute the first di
rect application of science to making man a
physical and economic success anywhere in
the universe—which, of course, includes on
earth.
The history of cities points to the same con
clusions as the history of the home (which we
can confidently predict will reach its logical
conclusion with the perfection of the little
black box). Cities developed entirely before
the thought of electricity or automobiles or be
fore any of the millions of inventions registered
in the United States Patent Office. Cities de
veloped as warehouse trading posts. All ware
housing has gone out of the modern city. Ware
housing has become dynamic and now is most
ly done on wheels, wings or in ships. Cities
were later used to house vast hordes of immi
grants to work in the factories, which were also
centered in the cities. Now the factories have
also left the cities obsolete in terms of yester
day's functions. Trying to rebuild them to ac
commodate the new needs of world man is like
trying to reconstruct and improve a wrecked
ship impaled on a reef pounded by surf. The
surf of technical obsolescence is invisible but
much more powerful than the waves of the real
ocean.
A few elementary engineering concepts
point clearly, I believe, to what the new cities
will be like. For example, when we double the
length of an airplane fuselage, we increase its
surface area by four and increase its volume
by eight. The surface area of a ship—rather
than the volume—governs its friction and drag.
The larger the ship, the more economically its
cargo may be carried. Yesterday's airplanes
were limited in size because they required ex
tremely long landing strips. The emerging gen
eration of large airplanes—which will carry
700 to 1000 passengers or more —is being de
signed for vertical take-off and landing, which
does away with the necessity for prepared
landing strips.
To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.
The new Queen Elizabeth is a luxuriously
comfortable abode either at sea or in port. She
is a mobile city. She is shaped to get passengers
across oceans in a hurry. If such floating cities
didn't have to speed, they might have an effi
ciently symmetrical shape. It is eminently
feasible and economical to develop floatable
organic cities of immense size. To visualize the
various design - controlling conditions under
which such cities could be constructed, imag
ine pinching a camera tripod's legs together,
taking hold of the bottom of the tripod in one
hand and trying to hold it vertically on the top
of an automobile going 70 miles an hour, over
rough terrain. As you opened the legs of the
tripod—each time you spread them—the tri
pod would get steadier and steadier. This is
the stabilizing effect obtained when tension
stays are rigged from top to bottom on three

sides of a mast, as with radio towers. It is
equally effective to have the legs spread out
wardly, as in the Eiffel Tower. When the three
legs are spread apart so that the length of the
edges of their base triangle equals the length
of each of the legs themselves, the tripod at
tains its maximum stability. This conformation
is that of the regular, or equilateral, tetrahe
dron. As the tripod's legs go farther apart than
the regular tetrahedron, its lop can support
less and less load. Thus we learn that the most
stable structure is the regular, equiedged tetra
hedron.
Following this design science clue, we find
that a tetrahedral city to house 1,000,000 peo
ple is both technologically and economically
feasible. Such a hollow tetrahedral city can be
constructed with each of its 300,000 families
having terraced "outside" apartments of 2000
square feet each. The terraces would permit

the storage of mobile trailers, houseboats and
other mobile homes, leaving an additional 1000
square feet for a garden. The living units
would be weatherproofed and would require
no additional "walls," or external skins, to be
fastened onto the tetrahedral city. Such a city
would consist of an open-truss-framework
"structural mountain," whose sides are covered
with parked mobile homes. At night, it would
be ablaze with lights, as are the great petro
leum refineries. All of the organic machinery
necessary to its operation would be housed be
hind the three principal "walls" of the tetra
hedron.
Tetrahedrons are also geometrically unique
in that they grow symmetrically by additions
to any one of their faces. Tetrahedral cities
may start with 1000 occupants and grow to
hold millions without changing their over-all
shape and always providing each family with
2000 square feet of floor space. (The city illus
trating this article, for example, while much
smaller than the model discussed here, is tech
nically identical.) Such a city would be so
structurally efficient and therefore so relatively
light that, together with its foundation —of
of hollow sections of reinforced concrete — it
could float. The model floating city would
measure two miles to an edge. Its foundation
would be 200. feet or more in depth and sev
eral hundred feet wide. On land, the structure
could float in a three-sided moat, which would
make the whole city earthquake-proof. Or the
structure could be floated out into the ocean
to any point and anchored. The depth of its
foundation would go below the turbulent level
of the seas, so that it would be, in effect, a float
ing triangular atoll. Its two-mile base would
provide landing strips for jet airplanes. Its in
terior, two-mile harbor would provide refuge
for the largest ocean vessels.
The total structural and mechanical mate
rials involved in production of a number of
such 1,000,000 - inhabitant tetrahedral cities
are within the capabilities of several compa
nies in the major industrial nations. Withdraw-

"The total structural and mechanical materials involved in production of a
number of such million-inhabitant tetrahedral cities are within the capabil
ities of several companies in the major industrial nations."

al of materials from obsolete buildings on the
land will permit the production of enough of
these floating cities to dot the oceans of the
earth, at distances negotiable by relatively
small boats. Because their foundations would
be below wave turbulence, such cities would
also permit mid-ocean cargo transfers, extraor
dinarily increasing the efficiency of material
and passenger traffic. The cities would gener
ate their own energy with atomic reactors,
whose by-product heat would be used to de
salinate sea water for the city's water supply.
In short, these habitats would greatly facilitate
both travel of all sorts and the coming large
scale exploitation of the oceans.
In 1954, the United States Marine Corps hel
icopter-lifted a geodesic dome large enough to
house an American family. The latest helicop
ters being built for Vietnam can air-deliver
geodesic domes large enough to cover a foot
ball field, including the end zones, the quarter
mile running track and side bleachers. By 1975,
it will be possible to air-deliver geodesic domes
large enough to cover small cities. (It is now
possible to cover a large city in three months
by delivering large subassemblies of a dome.)
There are already 5000 geodesic domes in 50
countries around the world, many so light and
strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu

when shadow is desirable and sun when sun

people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half

is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a

As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half

The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of
great countries.
Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus


A drawing of the 200-story city superimposed
on a photo of the outskirts of Tokyo vies for
attention with Mount Fuji. This structure
would include transport systems, community
parks, shopping centers in geodesic domes,
and maintenance facilities.
" .. it has been necessary for science to package
human environmental and metabolic-regeneration
systems ... to do so, science must understand man
as a process."

to accomplish this will be contained in a little
black box weighing about 500 pounds and
measuring about 20 cubic feet. With the little
black box, a man in space will be able to re
generate his many organic processes, needing
only small annual additions to the recirculating
chemistry. The first men living comfortably in
space will be watched on TV by billions on
earth. Humanity will be swiftly educated in an
entirely new set of environmental-control me
chanics.
Though the first black box will probably
cost the United States and Russia well over
seven billion dollars, it will be mass-reprodu
cible on earth at around two dollars per pound.
A $1000 box could rent profitably at $200 a
year. An individual or family could take a
black box (costing approximately $18 a
month) and go to any wilderness—mountain
top or island —and enjoy essential services su
perior to those now available in any city com
plex. The black box will constitute the first di
rect application of science to making man a
physical and economic success anywhere in
the universe—which, of course, includes on
earth.
The history of cities points to the same con
clusions as the history of the home (which we
can confidently predict will reach its logical
conclusion with the perfection of the little
black box). Cities developed entirely before
the thought of electricity or automobiles or be
fore any of the millions of inventions registered
in the United States Patent Office. Cities de
veloped as warehouse trading posts. All ware
housing has gone out of the modern city. Ware
housing has become dynamic and now is most
ly done on wheels, wings or in ships. Cities
were later used to house vast hordes of immi
grants to work in the factories, which were also
centered in the cities. Now the factories have
also left the cities obsolete in terms of yester
day's functions. Trying to rebuild them to ac
commodate the new needs of world man is like
trying to reconstruct and improve a wrecked
ship impaled on a reef pounded by surf. The
surf of technical obsolescence is invisible but
much more powerful than the waves of the real
ocean.
A few elementary engineering concepts
point clearly, I believe, to what the new cities
will be like. For example, when we double the
length of an airplane fuselage, we increase its
surface area by four and increase its volume
by eight. The surface area of a ship—rather
than the volume—governs its friction and drag.
The larger the ship, the more economically its
cargo may be carried. Yesterday's airplanes
were limited in size because they required ex
tremely long landing strips. The emerging gen
eration of large airplanes—which will carry
700 to 1000 passengers or more —is being de
signed for vertical take-off and landing, which
does away with the necessity for prepared
landing strips.
To take advantage of the progressive econ
omy gains of increasing size, leading airplane
manufacturers already have planes on their en
gineering boards big enough to carry 10,000
passengers or their equivalent in cargo. The
10,000-passenger ship has a length equivalent
to that of the Empire State Building. The lead

ing aircraft manufacturers realize that it will
be possible to produce Empire State Building
size skyscrapers in a horizontal position under
factory-controlled conditions in mass produc
tion.
The Empire State Building was erected
under conditions of wind, rain, heat and cold
in the heart of New York City's traffic. One
man was killed for every floor of the building.
No men should be killed in the production of
the horizontal skyscraper in the airplane fac
tory. Such skyscraper-size airplanes may then
be taken from their factory and—with vertical
take-offs and temporary wings—flown horizon
tally to any position around the world. Using
their vertical take-off equipment, they will be
upended, anchored and braced to serve as
skyscrapers. Thus we see that whole cities can
be flown to any location in the world and also
removed in one day, just as fleets of ships enter
and leave ports.
If we build vertically, both out from and into
the earth's surface, we may use less land and
return good soil to metabolic productivity. We
can also install vertical habitations upon and
within the three quarters of the earth covered
by water.
The new Queen Elizabeth is a luxuriously
comfortable abode either at sea or in port. She
is a mobile city. She is shaped to get passengers
across oceans in a hurry. If such floating cities
didn't have to speed, they might have an effi
ciently symmetrical shape. It is eminently
feasible and economical to develop floatable
organic cities of immense size. To visualize the
various design - controlling conditions under
which such cities could be constructed, imag
ine pinching a camera tripod's legs together,
taking hold of the bottom of the tripod in one
hand and trying to hold it vertically on the top
of an automobile going 70 miles an hour, over
rough terrain. As you opened the legs of the
tripod—each time you spread them—the tri
pod would get steadier and steadier. This is
the stabilizing effect obtained when tension
stays are rigged from top to bottom on three

sides of a mast, as with radio towers. It is
equally effective to have the legs spread out
wardly, as in the Eiffel Tower. When the three
legs are spread apart so that the length of the
edges of their base triangle equals the length
of each of the legs themselves, the tripod at
tains its maximum stability. This conformation
is that of the regular, or equilateral, tetrahe
dron. As the tripod's legs go farther apart than
the regular tetrahedron, its lop can support
less and less load. Thus we learn that the most
stable structure is the regular, equiedged tetra
hedron.
Following this design science clue, we find
that a tetrahedral city to house 1,000,000 peo
ple is both technologically and economically
feasible. Such a hollow tetrahedral city can be
constructed with each of its 300,000 families
having terraced "outside" apartments of 2000
square feet each. The terraces would permit

the storage of mobile trailers, houseboats and
other mobile homes, leaving an additional 1000
square feet for a garden. The living units
would be weatherproofed and would require
no additional "walls," or external skins, to be
fastened onto the tetrahedral city. Such a city
would consist of an open-truss-framework
"structural mountain," whose sides are covered
with parked mobile homes. At night, it would
be ablaze with lights, as are the great petro
leum refineries. All of the organic machinery
necessary to its operation would be housed be
hind the three principal "walls" of the tetra
hedron.
Tetrahedrons are also geometrically unique
in that they grow symmetrically by additions
to any one of their faces. Tetrahedral cities
may start with 1000 occupants and grow to
hold millions without changing their over-all
shape and always providing each family with
2000 square feet of floor space. (The city illus
trating this article, for example, while much
smaller than the model discussed here, is tech
nically identical.) Such a city would be so
structurally efficient and therefore so relatively
light that, together with its foundation —of
of hollow sections of reinforced concrete — it
could float. The model floating city would
measure two miles to an edge. Its foundation
would be 200. feet or more in depth and sev
eral hundred feet wide. On land, the structure
could float in a three-sided moat, which would
make the whole city earthquake-proof. Or the
structure could be floated out into the ocean
to any point and anchored. The depth of its
foundation would go below the turbulent level
of the seas, so that it would be, in effect, a float
ing triangular atoll. Its two-mile base would
provide landing strips for jet airplanes. Its in
terior, two-mile harbor would provide refuge
for the largest ocean vessels.
The total structural and mechanical mate
rials involved in production of a number of
such 1,000,000 - inhabitant tetrahedral cities
are within the capabilities of several compa
nies in the major industrial nations. Withdraw-

al of materials from obsolete buildings on the
land will permit the production of enough of
these floating cities to dot the oceans of the
earth, at distances negotiable by relatively
small boats. Because their foundations would
be below wave turbulence, such cities would
also permit mid-ocean cargo transfers, extraor
dinarily increasing the efficiency of material
and passenger traffic. The cities would gener
ate their own energy with atomic reactors,
whose by-product heat would be used to de
salinate sea water for the city's water supply.
In short, these habitats would greatly facilitate
both travel of all sorts and the coming large
scale exploitation of the oceans.
In 1954, the United States Marine Corps hel
icopter-lifted a geodesic dome large enough to
house an American family. The latest helicop
ters being built for Vietnam can air-deliver
geodesic domes large enough to cover a foot
ball field, including the end zones, the quarter
mile running track and side bleachers. By 1975,
it will be possible to air-deliver geodesic domes
large enough to cover small cities. (It is now
possible to cover a large city in three months
by delivering large subassemblies of a dome.)
There are already 5000 geodesic domes in 50
countries around the world, many so light and
strong as to have been air-delivered.
Domed-over cities have extraordinary eco
nomic advantage. A dome calculated for mid-
Manhattan has a surface that is only 1/85 the
total area of the buildings that it would cover.
It would reduce energy losses—either in win
ter heating or summer cooling—to 1/85 of the
present level. It would obviate snow removal.
The savings in ten years would pay for the
dome.
Domed cities are going to be essential to
the occupation of the Arctic and the Antarctic.
The Russians are already experimenting with
them in the Arctic. They will be used in desert
areas to shield new growth from the sun, while
preventing wasteful evaporation of piped-in,
desalinized water. Gradually, the success of
new domed cities in remote places will bring
about their use in covering old cities, particu
larly where antiquities need to be protected.
The domes over our cities will be so high
and their structural members so delicate as to
be nearly invisible. They will bring shadow
when shadow is desirable and sun when sun
is desirable, always keeping out rain, snow and
storms as well as exterior industrial fumes,
while collecting rain water in reservoirs. The
temperature inside the domes will be so sta
bilized that a semitropical atmosphere will ex
ist. Inasmuch as there will be no rain or snow,
people will live in garden-terrace skyscrapers,
with screening only for privacy.
Because of the geodesic domes, the increas
ing trend toward mobility will find expression
not only in individual "homes" but also in en

tire cities. A 100-foot-diameter geodesic sphere
weighing three tons encloses seven tons of air.
In a 400-foot geodesic sphere—the size of sev
eral domes now operating —the weight of air
inside goes to about 500 tons, while the weight
of the air inside goes to about 500 tons, while
the weight of the structure is only 15 tons.
Here, the air-to-structure weight ratio is 33 to
1. When we get to a geodesic sphere one-half
mile in diameter, the weight of the air enclosed
is so great that the weight of the structure itself
becomes of relatively negligible magnitude, a
ratio of 1000 to 1. When the sun shines on an
open-frame aluminum geodesic sphere of one
half-mile diameter, sunlight is reflected by the
concave ininer surface back into the sphere and
gradually heats the interior atmosphere. When
the interior temperature of the sphere rises
only one degree Fahrenheit, the weight of air
pushed out of the sphere is greater than the
weight of the spherical-frame geodesic struc
ture. This means that the total weight of the
interior air, plus the weight of the structure, is

much less than the weight of the surrounding
atmosphere. The entire assemblage would then
float into the sky.
As geodesic spheres get larger than one-half
mile in diameter, they become floatable cloud
structures. If their surfaces were draped with
outwardly hung polyethylene curtains to re
tard the rate at which air comes back in a
night, the sphere and its internal atmosphere
would continue to be so light as to remain aloft.
Such sky-floating geodesic spheres may be de
signed for altitudes of thousands of feet. The
weight of human beings added to such prefab
ricated "cloud nines" would be negligible.
Many thousands of passengers could be housed
aboard a mile-diameter cloud structure. The

passengers could come and go from cloud to
cloud, or cloud to ground, as the clouds floated
around the earth or were anchored to moun
taintops. While the building of such floating
clouds is several decades hence, we may fore
see that—along with the floating tetrahedral
cities, air-deliverable skyscrapers, submarine
islands, subsurface dwellings, domed-over cit
ies, flyable dwelling machines and rentable,
autonomous-living black boxes—man may well
be able to converge and deploy at will around
the earth, in great numbers, without further
depiction of our planet's productive surface.
As people live and move more completely
around the earth, changing from "summer" to
"winter" in hours, the old concept of man as a
cold-area or warm-area dweller—or as a fixed,
static dweller anywhere—and all the old con
cepts of seasons and of work related to only
daylight hours will gradually be eradicated
from our conditioned reflexes. This will mean
more efficient occupancy of environment-con
trol facilities. Nowadays, at international air
port hotels, people with one - to - eight - hour
flight stopovers follow one another in rooms
and beds that are made up as soon as each oc
cupant leaves.. The rooms are occupied, not on
a noon-to-noon schedule but on a use schedule,
which we may call a frequency - modulation
schedule. Such frequency - modulated occu
pancy of rented space in mobile hotels or in
dwelling machines will become man's funda
mental life pattern.
The great world housing problem is an edu
cational problem. By and large, man's inertias
are overcome only by virtue of his own per
sonal discoveries and his understanding of
what is happening to him. There will be no
instant world housing solutions. There are
fundamental rates at which the educational
gestation takes place. Publishers who try to ex
ploit man's imagination by giving him only the
end-product concepts, without showing how
man will get from here to there, postpone the
opportunities for helping man educate himself
as to how these events may come to pass. I, for
one, am unwilling to allow anyone to be
amused by startling concepts of tetrahedral
cities and air-deliverable Empire State Build
ings while keeping from society the opportu
nity to understand the complex of factors that
lead to such tangible results.
The comprehensive introduction of automa

from being an automaton and will generate so
