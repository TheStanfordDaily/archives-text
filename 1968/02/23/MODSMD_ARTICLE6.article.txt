I have been asked many times: "What would
you do if you were building commissioner
of the United States or even the entire
world?"
I would resign. I am an inventor and so have
far vaster prerogatives than any politician.
Edison, Bell, Marconi and the Wrights needed
no licenses from anyone to light the night, to
shrink the earth and to interlink all humanity.
So I will pass up any hypothetical political ap
pointment, but will accept the housing chal
lenge as an inventor.
The drawings of the tetrahedral city on
these pages represent an entirely feasible and
practical new way for men to live together eco
nomically. The drawings cannot be under
stood, however, without knowing the trends in
housing and cities that lead up to them. And
their full appreciation requires knowledge, too,
of the importance of technology—and there
fore of the inventor —in human affairs.
Yesterday's capitalists disliked inventors,
who made the capitalists' machines obsolete.
Businessmen were powerful enough to per
suade society that inventors were screwballs.
All that is changing; businessmen now find
change profitable and inventors are becoming
respectable. Inventors pay attention only to
physical laws—which alone govern what man
ultimately may do in the universe. If humanity
succeeds, its success will have been initiated
by inventions and not by the debilitating, often
lethal biases of politics.
Our higher potentials are unrealized because
environmental conditions have frustrated
man's potentials. We have learned much, how
ever, through recent behavioral - science re
search. For instance, we know that environ
mental conditions determine how much of the
child's total brain potential will blossom into
effectiveness.
Politics undertakes to reform only man, not
his environment. For decades, society has tried
to reduce automobile accidents by reforming
drivers—with arrests, fines, behavioral exhor
tations and laws. I always thought that, in
stead, it is physically possible to prevent acci
dents: by split-level crossings, banked turns
and divided highways. Society has at last un
dertaken to reform the driving environment.
Take away all the inventions from humanity
and, within six months, half of us would die of
starvation and disease. Take away all the poli
ticians and all political ideologies and leave all
the inventions and more would eat and prosper
than do now.
My task as an inventor is to employ the
earth's resources in such a way as to support
all humanity while also enabling all people to
enjoy the whole earth—all of its historical arti
facts and its beautiful places — without one

man interfering with another and without any
man enjoying life at the cost of another.
The first thing I must understand in order
to undertake this task is the history of man's
dispersal around the globe. In chapter one,
humanity lived in huts on rafts beside the riv
ers, lakes, bays and oceans. In the second chap
ter of history, men learned to sail to windward,
following the sun, to which they intuitively
attributed their metabolic regeneration. Al
most all of the past 6000 years of recorded his
tory took place during chapter two's west
bound movement.
In California, at the mid-p«'i?t of the west
ern shores of America, crossbreeding man has
become so genetically integrated that he fre
quently is unidentifiable with any of the ear
lier inbred national characteristics of Eurasia.
Chapter two climaxes in the emergence of
world man, who is poised on an epochal spring
board. He will fly both skyward and into the
seas' depths and thus open chapter three of
history—that of universe man, who will enjoy
free, four-dimensional occupancy of thr uni
verse. Man will free himself from local time
and geographical bases and will progressively
discard encumbrances, giving all heavy, static
and economically nontransportable properties
to libraries, museums and universities, scrap
ping them as he is able to rent superior devices
and services everywhere around the earth.
Before envisioning the way this new and
eminently mobile man will live, we must have
a clear idea of the development of the home
and of the city. On the old farmstead, there
were a great many buildings. All these build
ings and many others on the farms are disap
pearing or have disappeared, because machin
ery in the house has displaced the functions
the buildings performed. Still, the layman fails

to understand what Corbusier meant when he
said, "A house is a machine to live in."
Then came the automobile, which, in effect,
put wheels under his glassed-in front porch, so
that instead of waiting for people to pass by,
he could drive down the street to look for them.
Because we are conditioned to think of the
house as static, we fail to realize that the auto
mobile is as much a part of the house as was
the addition of a woodshed.
Man was designed with legs — not roots.
Over 10,000,000 humans have now traveled
more than 3,000,000 miles around their spin
ning spaceship, the earth's surface, in contrast
with the 30,000 miles per lifetime averaged by
all humanity prior to the year 1900. So igno
rantly, myopically and statically conceived —
and so obsolete—is the whole housing art that
its death led to the crash of 1929. Since then, its
ghostscript has been kept in rehearsal by the
U.S. Government, at a total underwriting cost
to date of 200 billion dollars.
But the reactionary bias of real-estate agents
and land developers is really trivial in the face
of the technological advances we are about to
make. The advances, as usual, will find much
of their impetus in the weapons systems of
great countries.
Now that scientific warfare has gone into
space, it has been necessary for science to pack
age human environmental and metabolic-re
generation systems for economic delivery by
rocket. To do so, science must understand man
as a process. When astronauts go beyond the
vacuum-bottle-and-sandwich excursion limits,
all the regenerative conditions provided natu
rally by the great biological interactions within
the biosphere around the earth's surface will
have to be reproduced—in a miniaturized and
capsulized human ecology. All the apparatus


A drawing of the 200-story city superimposed
on a photo of the outskirts of Tokyo vies for
attention with Mount Fuji. This structure
would include transport systems, community
parks, shopping centers in geodesic domes,
and maintenance facilities.
