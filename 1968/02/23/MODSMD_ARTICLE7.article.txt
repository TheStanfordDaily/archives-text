"The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep."
Robert Frost
There is a growing consciousness that we
are not solving the problems that con
cern us most: a recognition that the
more we manipulate the more manipulation is
required. There is an increasing awareness that
we cannot separate human events into parts,
that there is an interdependence between acts.
In general, this consciousness and this aware
ness have not yet extended to the architects of
our time, nor has it been expressed in our archi
tecture.
Architecture is defined as the art and science
of building. There are certain aspects of our
life and activity to which it seems clearly re
lated, even in a traditional sense. Architecture
seems directly involved with the planning and
development of new cities, problems of land
use and land conservation, the restoration and
improvement of existing city centers that have
decayed. Certainly the architect would like to
be more involved in these activities.
The words "prospects in architecture" have
several meanings. One is that of forecast and
prophecy: what will buildings look like, what
forms and shapes will cities take in the future?
Another meaning is that of a view: what do we
see and feel when we look at and experience
the world today and compare it with the past?
There are those who profess to be prophets,
who see a grand pattern, a kind of inevitible
unfolding of the future. Some of these prophets
are architects. Based on our problems and our
abilities, as they understand them, they would
prepare and design the world of the future.
This type of future-planning has become
good business as well as big business. Often
these prophesies do not reflect clear concerns
for our world and its changing nature, but rath
er a concern for established vested interests and
ways in which these established conditions may
be perpetuated—even if destructive to those
qualities of human life that we have come to
cherish most. This corporate self-interest in the
future extends to, and corrupts, the attitude of
architects in our time and the work with which
they are charged.
This attitude is illustrated by a recent ad in
Time. It is a four page ad in full color, artfully
prepared with handsome typography, layout

and photography. On the first page is a near
life-sized photograph of an archaic sculpture
of a man's head. The form and expression of
the head is noble, dignified and serious; the
lighting is sombre, the background, dark. Be
low the head, in restrained white lettering on
the dark ground is the legend: "We have about
thirty years to decide if man can stay on earth."
Below this, in small lettering is the following
text:
Experts figure that by the year 2,000 there will
be three hundred million Americans. That's about
one hundred million more of us than there are
today. It could be a problem. As you know, we're
running a little low on water. And houses keep
popping up where corn used to grow. Even the
earth is getting a little stingy with her fossil fuels.
As big as these problems are, we think they can
be solved. Because people are getting smarter
faster than they are having babies. (Every 10 to
15 years our store of technical knowledge
doubles.) The real solution is putting this knowl
edge to work at the right time, in the right direc
tion, against the right problem. One way to do it
is with a company that can command and man
age almost unlimited technologies. A company
that can perform the whole range of industrial
work, from basic research to mass production. A
company that markets individual products or en
tire systems, here or all over the world. North
American Rockwell is that land of a company.
Along the bottom of the inside pages are some
juxtaposed photographs: smoggy sky over a
big city, a traffic jam on a freeway, a NASA jet,
etc. Across the top of these pages is a dramatic
photograph of two small children, a boy and
girl (white) playing in a landscape.
On these pages the legend states: "We want

your children to have a better life than you
did." The text explains that North American
Rockwell with 114,000 employees will help
"keep raising the living standard of more and
more people with fewer and fewer natural re
sources to go around. The company proposes
to do this "with skills and experience that cover
the entire spectrum of defense and space tech
nologies, program and systems management
techniques, and the mass production and sale
of a large variety of components."
Finally, there is an offer to send you a copy
of the Annual Report. The last page contains
more handsome graphics and a list and de
scription of the many divisions of North Amer
ican Rockwell.
This ad has been described and quoted at
considerable length because it exemplifies the
position of the most influential future-planners
in architecture. The large corporations of the
"defense" and "aero-space" industries, their
techniques and facilities, have become the
models for architectural excellence. These fu
ture-planners see the problems in terms of tech
nical skills available and are eager to put their
machinery into motion for the "good of the
children growing up." They see our problems
becoming larger, and therefore propose larger
solutions for the future.
The fashionable phrases for future planning
in architecture are "mega-structure," "perfor
mance design," and "systems analysis." Hie
ideal prototype for the architecture of tomor


by alberto giocometti
The Palace at 4 A.M. 1923-33. Wood, glass, wire, string, 25" high. The Museum of A,
row is a mega-tetrahedron floating in the bay
(or below the sea, or in space), controlled
(fully programmed) air and light, happiness
and joy inside; smog, darkness, (death and vio
lence) outside; linked, or course, with other
"mega-units," in a clean and quiet way.
This ad, then, presents three aspects of
prophecy (and aspiration) current in architec
ture.
• First: an eagerness to use current and pro
jected technology to solve the very problems
caused by existing technology; a desire to join
the attendant power and affluence; and, above
all, to control the environment —to subdue
those forces considered hostile in nature.
• Second: the development of a literature
of rhetoric which uses euphemisms to hide and
mask rather than to clarify those issues with
which they deal. The fashionable literature of
future planning in architecture is laced with
references to ecology, sociology, anthropology
—but it is never clear what precise part these
various concepts will play in giving form to
projects under question.
• Third: the artist's abdication from a posi
tion of responsibility. The talents and sensi
bility of individuals were called upon to give
form and substance to the content of this ad.
Some one wrote it, some one prepared the
poignant photographs. Each of these people
acquiesced, thereby giving quiet consent to
this prophecy. This abdication of the artist
from those common problems racking man is

central to this issue of destructive prophecy—
especially to the position of our architecture.
An alternative meaning of the words
"prospects in architecture," is that of a
view: as man on earth, at this time. If
we really look at and experience the forms and
spaces around us, and the city they make up,
it will be clear that an awareness of the nature
of human events has only slightly touched our
architecture.
For the most part the architecture that we
are making today is still canonical. We look at
the buildings of the past, not with compassion,
understanding, and care but with the eye of a
consumer—what to take and use as sufficiently
"modern;" what to reject as "out of style." The
buildings we are making today are still the
castles and churches of the Quatrocento, with
out their redeeming features. We have stripped
away profound ornament, sealed and papered
over poetic space, and replaced many materi
als of austerity and durability with those
which are guaranteed to decay quickly.
Most architects have also abdicated their
position of responsibility. They have been con
ditioned to do so because they have not been
educated to understand or to perceive the
course of human events. Those architects who
do grasp their position wring their hands,
blaming patrons and the times for their humil
iating position—and then rush to take part,
discounting their own responsibility.
The problems we face are serious. We can

build on a large scale, but we can't manage
these buildings, or their impact on the land
scape and on the lives of the people who use
them. Our capacity to construct exceeds our
ability to understand. Our architecture, by ac
quiescence, gives form to the plight of the city
which is the plight of society. This condition
of distress is above all the condition of collec
tivism: the denial of individual responsibility
and the failure to provide for individual op
tions. Impressive fa£ades of fragility and rigid
ity give form to power and efficiency.
The architect is in a position to alter direc
tions, to exercise options, and to change the
course of events. He may deal with spaces at
the level of human scale. If he is willing to sac
rifice efficiency and expertise in order to pro
vide for some human needs, he may assist peo
ple and share in shaping their fates. Human
needs which especially concern the architect
are a sense of dignity and purpose—a sense
of individual place, marked out and separate
on one hand, unified and connected on the
other.
The architect may do these things by letting
go—by perceiving what the world wants to
be and allowing himself to become a link in this
continuity. Letting go means giving up con
trol, abandoning power and forsaking a cer
tain self-interest in order to allow the nature
of our time to extend into ourselves and to
form us.
When the architect respects, nurtures and
hallows the natural quality of every day of
life, he becomes an artist (artists, of course,
can become architects). An artist first discov
ers his own self. He does this by means of self
discipline and perception. The reason for self
discipline is to learn how to cope—how to face
the new and unimagined. The reason for per
ception is to learn from nature and tradition
how to escape the tyranny of the past and to
allow options for the future.
Art is a shaping spirit. The architect, by be
coming an artist, brings this spirit to his work.
In an imperfect world, characterized by cor
ruption, greed and slothfulness, in a time when
most buildings are sponsored for profit or pres
tige, the artist by being himself enlightened
and free, can still bring a humanizing and in
forming quality to a project. The artist presents
himself, his perceptions —"to bring to life in
others all that lives in himself... His world
and his true self can be had only in the shape
which he gives them " 1
One prospect for architecture then, is to be
come the deep and serious art which intrin
sically it is. When true artists can work to
gether with respect, architecture will open up,
extend wings and roots into the natural land
scape and become a place for man.
