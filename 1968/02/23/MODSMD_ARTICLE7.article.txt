# Prospects in
## A
						critical look at future architectural trends reveals that future-planning has become a big, impersonal business. architecture

"The woods are lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,
And miles to go before I sleep."
Robert Frost
There is a growing consciousness that we
are not solving the problems that con
cern us most: a recognition that the
more we manipulate the more manipulation is
required. There is an increasing awareness that
we cannot separate human events into parts,
that there is an interdependence between acts.
In general, this consciousness and this aware
ness have not yet extended to the architects of
our time, nor has it been expressed in our archi
tecture.
Architecture is defined as the art and science
of building. There are certain aspects of our
life and activity to which it seems clearly re
lated, even in a traditional sense. Architecture
seems directly involved with the planning and
development of new cities, problems of land
use and land conservation, the restoration and
improvement of existing city centers that have
decayed. Certainly the architect would like to
be more involved in these activities.
The words "prospects in architecture" have
several meanings. One is that of forecast and
prophecy: what will buildings look like, what
forms and shapes will cities take in the future?
Another meaning is that of a view: what do we
see and feel when we look at and experience
the world today and compare it with the past?
There are those who profess to be prophets,
who see a grand pattern, a kind of inevitible
unfolding of the future. Some of these prophets
are architects. Based on our problems and our
abilities, as they understand them, they would
prepare and design the world of the future.
This type of future-planning has become
good business as well as big business. Often
these prophesies do not reflect clear concerns
for our world and its changing nature, but rath
er a concern for established vested interests and
ways in which these established conditions may
be perpetuated—even if destructive to those
qualities of human life that we have come to
cherish most. This corporate self-interest in the
future extends to, and corrupts, the attitude of
architects in our time and the work with which
they are charged.
This attitude is illustrated by a recent ad in
Time. It is a four page ad in full color, artfully
prepared with handsome typography, layout

and photography. On the first page is a near
life-sized photograph of an archaic sculpture
of a man's head. The form and expression of
the head is noble, dignified and serious; the
lighting is sombre, the background, dark. Be
low the head, in restrained white lettering on
the dark ground is the legend: "We have about
thirty years to decide if man can stay on earth."
Below this, in small lettering is the following
text:
Experts figure that by the year 2,000 there will
be three hundred million Americans. That's about
one hundred million more of us than there are
today. It could be a problem. As you know, we're
running a little low on water. And houses keep
popping up where corn used to grow. Even the
earth is getting a little stingy with her fossil fuels.
As big as these problems are, we think they can
be solved. Because people are getting smarter
faster than they are having babies. (Every 10 to
15 years our store of technical knowledge
doubles.) The real solution is putting this knowl
edge to work at the right time, in the right direc
tion, against the right problem. One way to do it
is with a company that can command and man
age almost unlimited technologies. A company
that can perform the whole range of industrial
work, from basic research to mass production. A
company that markets individual products or en
tire systems, here or all over the world. North
American Rockwell is that land of a company.
Along the bottom of the inside pages are some
juxtaposed photographs: smoggy sky over a
big city, a traffic jam on a freeway, a NASA jet,
etc. Across the top of these pages is a dramatic
photograph of two small children, a boy and
girl (white) playing in a landscape.
On these pages the legend states: "We want

your children to have a better life than you
did." The text explains that North American
Rockwell with 114,000 employees will help
"keep raising the living standard of more and
more people with fewer and fewer natural re
sources to go around. The company proposes
to do this "with skills and experience that cover
the entire spectrum of defense and space tech
nologies, program and systems management
techniques, and the mass production and sale
of a large variety of components."
Finally, there is an offer to send you a copy
of the Annual Report. The last page contains
more handsome graphics and a list and de
scription of the many divisions of North Amer
ican Rockwell.
This ad has been described and quoted at
considerable length because it exemplifies the
position of the most influential future-planners
in architecture. The large corporations of the
"defense" and "aero-space" industries, their
techniques and facilities, have become the
models for architectural excellence. These fu
ture-planners see the problems in terms of tech
nical skills available and are eager to put their
machinery into motion for the "good of the
children growing up." They see our problems
becoming larger, and therefore propose larger
solutions for the future.
The fashionable phrases for future planning
in architecture are "mega-structure," "perfor
mance design," and "systems analysis." Hie
