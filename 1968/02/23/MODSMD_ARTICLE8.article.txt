# Toward century 21—technology and human value
## 
### 
Frequently in the past man has taken
part in the flux of physical and social
forces around him with only a modicum
of foresight. The inertia of the institutions
thus created has often restricted his choices.
The pace of change in the past centuries
has permitted man to observe ex post facto
these institutions and to adjust to these as best
he could. This pace of change is now increas
ing exponentially. Advance in technology in
the last sixty-seven years has been greater than
in the previous sixty-seven hundred. Myopic
foresight with merely ad hoc solutions will no
longer suffice. A perceptive exploration of the
emerging image of man and his values as he
views himself and—by the same act of obser
vation—views the entire biosphere in the rap
idly approaching technocracy is a sine qua
non.
Predictions based on trend lines is one ap
proach. Recognizing the interrelation of var
ious parts is another type of approach viz.
predictions by models. Emphasizing values
and including these into models leads to pre
dictions by normative models. What normative
models for the future do we want to invent?
Only nominal efforts so far have been made
to recognize the growing interdependence of
the human species. Contemporary man must
above all develop a supranational outlook. The
social-psychological forces that reinforce eth
nocentrism must be clearly comprehended and
checked. Radical changes in existing value
systems will be necessary if man is to avert
total catastrophe, nuclear or otherwise.
Population expansion at the present rate is
the second pressing problem. It is freely pre
dicted that if present trends are extrapolated
there will be famine of serious proportions in
most Asian, African, and Latin American
countries by 1980. Population control and con
comitant explorations of new sources of food
are urgent necessities.
On longer range the implications and pos
sibilities of burgeoning molecular biology are
profound. Before long it will be feasible to
alter the information content of human DNA.
Recent heart transplants raise a number of
ethical-legal questions. Professor Robert

White of Western Reserve Medical School
states that an isolated human head could be
kept alive using exis'ing techniques. Drugs
capable of changing human personality are
already in wide use; further advances in
psycho-pharmacology may enable intelligence
enhancement and also raise basic questions
of human values.
The impact of new communication technol
ogy has permeated many aspects of human
behavior, both at the interpersonal and at the
mass level. The time is not far off when im
promptu meetings amongst widely scattered
participants can be effected via three-dimen
sional holographs. Mass media with capabili
ties of instant communication will tend to
bring increasing conformity. Electronic eaves
dropping is a serious threat to the individual's
right to privacy. A computerized national data
center also poses this threat. The nature and
the role of the individual in a mass techno
logical society needs to be re-assessed.
One of the effects of cybernetics and auto
mation will be to release man from monot
onous work. Many institutions in western
society are based on a work ethic derived
from an economics of scarcity. How will man
use his growing leisure time toward creative
ends?
A symbiosis of brain with computer can
make quite obsolete our existing educational
methods that emphasize information transfer
ence from teacher to student with a periodical
regurgitation of this information. John Wilk
inson observes in The Quantitative Society:

The director of Tresidder Union's CENTURY 21
Project writes a guest column proposing the con
tinuation of programs focusing on the impact of
new technology.

One information-processing device that cannot
easily accomodate itself to the universal accelera
tion of change is the human brain . . . Educa
tors are always instructing the last generation.
. . . The average college student is a very badly
programmed computer.
Clearly this pattern of educating "the last
generation" is dysfunctional. A future orienta
tion needs to be inculcated. Universities must
serve as centers for intellectual innovators
and create a science of human potentialities.
An ecological viewpoint with the entire hu
man race as a unit needs to be developed.
Social thought needs to be advanced to the
level of transcending man's short range needs.
It is a truism of our time that concomitantly
we face the possibilities of unprecedented dis
aster and potentialities of remarkable fulfill
ment. The choice is ours.
During the academic year 1967-68, Stan
ford University funded the setting up
of some forty lectures in the CENTURY
21 Project. Additionally several undergraduate
seminars were set up during winter quarter.
A film series on this theme was also exhibited.
Some proposals for continuing this project
are: establishing of weekend seminars on
specific topic areas such as population, elec
tronic eavesdropping and law, organ trans
plants and ethics, etc., could be organized by
ASSU or Student-Faculty Board or Tresidder
Union or perhaps jointly by these groups.
Some articles emerging from these seminars
could be included in journals such as the pro
posed journal Science and Human Values or
The Stanford Daily. Lectures, course-seminars
and films could be continued on this theme.

As part of the CENTURY 21 Project, the Union has featured displays such as this proposed resi
dential area in the Santa Monica Mountains, Los Angeles. This project was designed by Caesar
Pelli of Daniel, Mann, Johnson, and Mendenhall Architects.
