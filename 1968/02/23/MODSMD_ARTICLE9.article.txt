Greek food and dance
at Minerva Cafe
Enter the Minerva Cafe in San Fran
cisco and you enter Greece. There an
cient and modern Greek traditions blend
into an atmosphere of good food, entertain
ment, and a touch of the lively.
The restaurant is located at 136 Eddy Street
near Union Square. From the outside, its ap
pearance is deceiving. The small front opens
into a spacious, gayly decorated interior with
scores of tables and many laughing voices.
Prices at the restaurant are moderate. One
of the best combination dinners includes
broiled cut of lamb marinated in wine, stuffed
grape leaves, egg-lemon soup, and a Greek
specialty salad including goat's milk cheese.
For dessert, there is nothing like Baklava.
Order only on the right side of the menu.
The other side will be all Greek to you.
A good dinner wine is Retsina with its light
resin-flavor. The more adventurous drink
Ouzo. It's strong anise flavor is typically Greek
and typically potent.
If you insist on personal service at the
Minerva, don't come after 9 p.m. on Fridays
or Saturdays, for that's when the music starts.
The attentive waiter may suddenly desert your
table for the dance floor and begin a series of
leaps and kicks reminiscent of Zorba the
Greek.
If you suddenly feel Greek, or if you have
drunk enough Ouzo, you may forget dinner
and your inhibitions and join the others on the
dance floor. First-time visitors are warned to
procede with caution, however, for many of
Minerva's regular customers are Greek and
know what they're doing.
The owner of the Minerva is Vaslilios Glimi
dakis. He greets everyone at the door and
checks to make certain things stay lively. He
may remind you a little of Zorba. Your im

pression is heightened when he sees you leav
ing and says goodbye, adding a little ruefully,
"But please, stay a little longer," and you
really wish you could.
SAKURA GARDENS
FEATURES INTIMATE
JAPANESE DINING
The appealing quality of the Sakura
Gardens is its intimacy. The Sakura, lo
cated at 2116 El Camino in Mountain
View, is the only Japanese dining establish
ment in the Bay Area.
The restaurant is built around an outdoor
rock garden and pool. Small totami rooms for
two or four persons overlook the gardens,
while music plays softly in the background.
A Japanese hostess leads the way to a to
tami room, asking you politely to remove your
shoes before you seat yourself comfortably
on the floor. If you tend to get cold feet, the
Sakura has regular tables and a choice of con
tinental as well as Japanese cuisine.

The very hungry enjoy a complete dinner
such as beef sukiyaki. Your curiosity may be
aroused when the hostess cooks the dinner
right in front of you. Into the pan go sliced
sirloin beef, mushrooms, soy bean cakes, shira
taki, bamboo shoots, and assorted vegetables.
You calmly sit growing hungrier by the
minute, wondering why the thing doesn't boil;
that is, until you remember the old adage
about a watched pot.
Included with the dinner aj;e a green salad
with shrimp and Japanese dressing, steamed
rice, tea, and dessert. Those who believe in
the Zodiac, tea leaves, and fortunes should
open their cookie with caution. At the Sakura,
fortune cookies carry a slight punch.
Besides beef and chicken dinners, the sea
food cuisine is excellent. Recommended is the
lobster Sakura which is baked with a light
cheese topping. All dinners are moderately
priced. For a wine, the Japanese favorite is
saki.
One of the best features of the restaurant
is its costumed hostesses. Their shy charm
makes you feel the personal touch in the ser
vice at the Sakura.
