POLARIZED PEOPLE
Outward appearances can be deceiving, for people can be
polarized. Religion must be more than skin deep, for "The
Lord sees not as man sees; man looks upon the outward ap
pearance, but the Lord looks on the heart" (I Samuel 16:7).
Jesus Christ said, "What comes out of the mouth proceeds
from the heart, and this defiles a man. For out of the heart
come evil thoughts, fornication, theft, murder, adultry, covet
ing, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride,
foolishness. All these evil things come from within, and they
defile a man" (Matthew 15-. 17-20).
Jesus Christ reserved His strongest words of rebuke and
condemnation for the religious hypocrites of His day, for
these men were outwardly extremely religious but inwardly
depraved. They constantly misled others who were seeking
knowledge of God. Mincing no words Jesus Christ told a
crowd of Pharisees they were "like whitewashed tombs,
which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are filled with
dead men's bones and all uncleaness . . . outwardly appear
ing righteous to man, but within full of hypocrisy and in
iquity" (Matthew 23:27-28).
Don't be deceived by polarized people. God is a Person you
can know in your own life and experience. The world is full
of religious people but God requires a changed heart. This
occurs when any individual personally receives or accepts
Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.
Outward appearances don't count with God, only the inner
reality of a changed heart and an indwelling Redeemer who
says,"I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be
clean from all your uncleaness, and from all your idols I will
cleanse you. A new heart I will give you; and I will take out of
your flesh the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh'
(Ezekial 36:25-27).
Have you let Jesus Christ change your heart?
