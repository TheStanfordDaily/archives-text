SAN FRANCISCO (AP)â€”
Members of 15 unions Sun
day approved proposed con
tracts with the San Francisco
Newspaper Printing Co., end
ing a dispute which shut
down the city's two major par
pers Jan. 5.
The morning independent
Ciironicle and the afternoon
Hearst Examiner planned to
resume publication Wednes
day.
Maintenance crews were
being called back Sunday
night and editorial staffs were
expected to start returning
Monday. Other employees
were to be called back as re
quired.
Mayor Joseph Alioto an
nounced approval of the three
year contract by the 15 un
ions effective March 1 at a
news conference in his office
which was postponed for a
brief time pending approval
by the final union.
The last to approve their
proposed contract was the

mailers' union, which was the
only one to strike the print
ing firm which puts out both
papers. Other unions have ob
served the mailers' picket
lines.
Mediator Sam Kakel, who
had played a major role in
settling the dispute, said the
mailers voted 213 to 10 for
the contract after a lengthy
dispute.
Negotiators for all the un
ions met Saturday and rec
ommended that their mem
bers give their approval at
meetings Sunday.
He said in general they in
cluded a raise of $10 per week
for the first year, $10 for the
second, and $12 for the third.
No re-openlng or review of
any contract will be permit
ted during the three year pe
riod, he said, and at the com
mon termination date of Feb.
28, 1971, there would be joint
bargaining by all unions with
management.
Alioto said he believed that

"what we have done here is
not only settle a newspaper
strike. In addition to that I
believe we have set a pattern
for other newspapers
throughout the country.
"I want to say that in Mr.
Kagel we have not one of the,
but actually the outstanding
industrial expert in the entire
country," Alioto declared.
Kagel was brought in by
Alioto with the approval of
both sides Feb. 8 after almost
no progress had been made in
on-and-off negotiations. Ka
gel first got the unions and
publishers to agree on non
economic issues then tackled
the economic problems and,
after that, the common expi
ration date.
The break through came
last Thursday when Kagel
announced tentative agree
ments had been reached
among all unions and the
publishers except for a few
loose ends which were worked
out Friday.
