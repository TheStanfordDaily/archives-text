# Would You Believe The Wall Street Journal?

(Editor's Note: The following editorial en
titled "The Logic of the Battlefield" appeared
in Friday's Wall Street Journal.)
We think the American people should be get
ting ready to accept, if they haven't already, the
prospect that the whole Vietnam effort may be
doomed; it may be falling apart beneath our feet.
The actual military situation may be making aca
demic the philosophical arguments for the inter
vention in the first place.
Granted, there is an opposite theory, the "last
gasp" notion that the weeks'-long wave of as
saults on cities and hamlets is the enemy's final
outburst before greatly decreasing the war's in
tensity and coming to the bargaining table. Per
haps it will turn out that way, but right now the
evidence does not lend the theory much support.
Hanoi is believed to have relatively large num
bers of troops still uncommittd in North Viet
nam. The Communists appear to be getting
ample supplies of weapons from the Soviet
Union and Red China. As long as the arms keep
coming and there are Vietnamese Communists
to use them, you would suppose they could keep
up the struggle more or less indefinitely. Thus
far, at least, they are showing with a vengeance
their ability to sow destruction and demoraliza
tion everywhere.
Manwhile the present South Vietnamese gov
ernment, never very impressive, looks worse and
worse. Most important, the government can't
protect the people even in the heart of the cities.
The Saigon-U.S. effort to secure villages and woo
villagers to the government side has been brought
to a halt. This is a government and a nation in
chaos; how long can it go on? The failing, it
should be stressed, is not in U.S. will or valor,
but basically in something lacking in Vietnam it
self.
As for the U.S. military undertaking, the cur
rent tactic is sad to see: The wholesale destruc
tion of towns and cities in order ot "save" them,
killing or making homeless refugees out of thous
ands more civilians. While it is certainly true
that an American commander has to destroy a
building or a town is he considers it necessary
for his soldiers' safety, the scale on which it is
going on is hardly endearing the U.S. or Saigon
to the populace.
Hence the question: Are developments on the
ground making hash of our original, commend
able objectives?
The U.S. went in to keep South Vietnam out of

Communist hands. But no matter what our forces
do, they can't seem to do that. If practically noth
ing is to be left of government or nation, what is
there to be saved for what?
The U.S. also went in to demonstrate to Com
munist China that it couldn't get away with this
kind of indirect aggression and that it hadn't
better try direct agrression either. But the Com
munists are getting away with it; they are putting
the mighty U.S. through a wringer, and they may
be encouraged to try more of it.
Should such be the upshot, that the U.S. aban
dons the effort not because it "should" do so but
because its purposes have become irrelevant in
the light of events on the battlefield and of Viet
namese politics, let no one blink at the fact that it
will be a disaster. It will be a stunning blow to the
U.S. and the West in the larger struggle with in
ternational communism. At home it will be a
traumatic experience to have lost a war in which
thousands of Americans died in vain.
The only thing is that continuing in circum
stances so unprepossessing could be a worse dis
aster. If it had in fact been possible for the U.S.
to intervene three years ago and accomplish, at
reasonable cost, the objective of saving South
Vietnam, it probably would have been well worth
doing. But since it seems increasingly doubtful
that the original purposes can any longer be
achieved, the logic of the battlefield suggests that
the U.S. could get forced out of an untenable po
sition.
We don't know that the posiblity is being
squarely faced in Washington; it seems rather
unlikely. The Administration insists that the
Communist drives are failing of their aims, which
Senator Fullbright describes as "wholly irration
al, a fantastic analysis." President Johnson seems
more firmly committed to Vietnam than ever.
Now stubborness up to a point is a virtue, but
stubborness can also go beyond the realm of rea
sonableness. We believe the Administration is
duty-bound to recognize that no battle and no
war is worth any price, no matter how ruinous,
and that in the case of Vietnam it may be failing
for the simple reason that the whole place and
cause is collapsing from within.
Conceivably all this is wrong; conceivably the
Communists are on the brink of defeat and genu
ine peace talks are about to begin. It doesn't look
that way, and as long as it doesn't everyone had
better be prepared for the bitter taste of defeat
beyond America's power to prevent.

be encouraged to try more of it.
Should such be the upshot, that the U.S. aban
dons the effort not because it "should" do so but
because its purposes have become irrelevant in
the light of events on the battlefield and of Viet
namese politics, let no one blink at the fact that it
will be a disaster. It will be a stunning blow to the
U.S. and the West in the larger struggle with in
ternational communism. At home it will be a
traumatic experience to have lost a war in which
thousands of Americans died in vain.
The only thing is that continuing in circum
stances so unprepossessing could be a worse dis
aster. If it had in fact been possible for the U.S.
to intervene three years ago and accomplish, at
reasonable cost, the objective of saving South
Vietnam, it probably would have been well worth
doing. But since it seems increasingly doubtful
that the original purposes can any longer be
achieved, the logic of the battlefield suggests that
the U.S. could get forced out of an untenable po
sition.
We don't know that the posiblity is being
squarely faced in Washington; it seems rather
unlikely. The Administration insists that the
Communist drives are failing of their aims, which
Senator Fullbright describes as "wholly irration
al, a fantastic analysis." President Johnson seems
more firmly committed to Vietnam than ever.
Now stubborness up to a point is a virtue, but
stubborness can also go beyond the realm of rea
sonableness. We believe the Administration is
duty-bound to recognize that no battle and no
war is worth any price, no matter how ruinous,
and that in the case of Vietnam it may be failing
for the simple reason that the whole place and
cause is collapsing from within.
Conceivably all this is wrong; conceivably the
Communists are on the brink of defeat and genu
ine peace talks are about to begin. It doesn't look
that way, and as long as it doesn't everyone had
better be prepared for the bitter taste of defeat
beyond America's power to prevent.

We think the American people should be get
ting ready to accept, if they haven't already, the
prospect that the whole Vietnam effort may be
doomed; it may be falling apart beneath our feet.
The actual military situation may be making aca
demic the philosophical arguments for the inter
vention in the first place.
Granted, there is an opposite theory, the "last
gasp" notion that the weeks'-long wave of as
saults on cities and hamlets is the enemy's final
outburst before greatly decreasing the war's in
tensity and coming to the bargaining table. Per
haps it will turn out that way, but right now the
evidence does not lend the theory much support.
Hanoi is believed to have relatively large num
bers of troops still uncommittd in North Viet
nam. The Communists appear to be getting
ample supplies of weapons from the Soviet
Union and Red China. As long as the arms keep
coming and there are Vietnamese Communists
to use them, you would suppose they could keep
up the struggle more or less indefinitely. Thus
far, at least, they are showing with a vengeance
their ability to sow destruction and demoraliza
tion everywhere.
Manwhile the present South Vietnamese gov
ernment, never very impressive, looks worse and
worse. Most important, the government can't
protect the people even in the heart of the cities.
The Saigon-U.S. effort to secure villages and woo
villagers to the government side has been brought
to a halt. This is a government and a nation in
chaos; how long can it go on? The failing, it
should be stressed, is not in U.S. will or valor,
but basically in something lacking in Vietnam it
self.
As for the U.S. military undertaking, the cur
rent tactic is sad to see: The wholesale destruc
tion of towns and cities in order ot "save" them,
killing or making homeless refugees out of thous
ands more civilians. While it is certainly true
that an American commander has to destroy a
building or a town is he considers it necessary
for his soldiers' safety, the scale on which it is
going on is hardly endearing the U.S. or Saigon
to the populace.
Hence the question: Are developments on the
ground making hash of our original, commend
able objectives?
The U.S. went in to keep South Vietnam out of

Communist hands. But no matter what our forces
do, they can't seem to do that. If practically noth
ing is to be left of government or nation, what is
there to be saved for what?
The U.S. also went in to demonstrate to Com
munist China that it couldn't get away with this
kind of indirect aggression and that it hadn't
better try direct agrression either. But the Com
munists are getting away with it; they are putting
the mighty U.S. through a wringer, and they may

nam. The Communists appear to be getting
ample supplies of weapons from the Soviet
Union and Red China. As long as the arms keep
coming and there are Vietnamese Communists
to use them, you would suppose they could keep
up the struggle more or less indefinitely. Thus
far, at least, they are showing with a vengeance
their ability to sow destruction and demoraliza
tion everywhere.
Manwhile the present South Vietnamese gov
ernment, never very impressive, looks worse and
worse. Most important, the government can't
protect the people even in the heart of the cities.
The Saigon-U.S. effort to secure villages and woo
villagers to the government side has been brought
to a halt. This is a government and a nation in
chaos; how long can it go on? The failing, it
should be stressed, is not in U.S. will or valor,
but basically in something lacking in Vietnam it
self.
As for the U.S. military undertaking, the cur
rent tactic is sad to see: The wholesale destruc
tion of towns and cities in order ot "save" them,
killing or making homeless refugees out of thous
ands more civilians. While it is certainly true
that an American commander has to destroy a
building or a town is he considers it necessary
for his soldiers' safety, the scale on which it is
going on is hardly endearing the U.S. or Saigon
to the populace.
Hence the question: Are developments on the
ground making hash of our original, commend
able objectives?
The U.S. went in to keep South Vietnam out of

Communist hands. But no matter what our forces
do, they can't seem to do that. If practically noth
ing is to be left of government or nation, what is
there to be saved for what?
The U.S. also went in to demonstrate to Com
munist China that it couldn't get away with this
kind of indirect aggression and that it hadn't
better try direct agrression either. But the Com
munists are getting away with it; they are putting
the mighty U.S. through a wringer, and they may
be encouraged to try more of it.
Should such be the upshot, that the U.S. aban
dons the effort not because it "should" do so but
because its purposes have become irrelevant in
the light of events on the battlefield and of Viet
namese politics, let no one blink at the fact that it
will be a disaster. It will be a stunning blow to the
U.S. and the West in the larger struggle with in
ternational communism. At home it will be a
traumatic experience to have lost a war in which
thousands of Americans died in vain.
The only thing is that continuing in circum
stances so unprepossessing could be a worse dis
aster. If it had in fact been possible for the U.S.
to intervene three years ago and accomplish, at
reasonable cost, the objective of saving South
Vietnam, it probably would have been well worth
doing. But since it seems increasingly doubtful
that the original purposes can any longer be
achieved, the logic of the battlefield suggests that
the U.S. could get forced out of an untenable po
sition.
We don't know that the posiblity is being
squarely faced in Washington; it seems rather
unlikely. The Administration insists that the
Communist drives are failing of their aims, which
Senator Fullbright describes as "wholly irration
al, a fantastic analysis." President Johnson seems
more firmly committed to Vietnam than ever.
Now stubborness up to a point is a virtue, but
stubborness can also go beyond the realm of rea
sonableness. We believe the Administration is
duty-bound to recognize that no battle and no
war is worth any price, no matter how ruinous,
and that in the case of Vietnam it may be failing
for the simple reason that the whole place and
cause is collapsing from within.
Conceivably all this is wrong; conceivably the
Communists are on the brink of defeat and genu
ine peace talks are about to begin. It doesn't look
that way, and as long as it doesn't everyone had
better be prepared for the bitter taste of defeat
beyond America's power to prevent.

We think the American people should be get
ting ready to accept, if they haven't already, the
prospect that the whole Vietnam effort may be
doomed; it may be falling apart beneath our feet.
The actual military situation may be making aca
demic the philosophical arguments for the inter
vention in the first place.
Granted, there is an opposite theory, the "last
gasp" notion that the weeks'-long wave of as
saults on cities and hamlets is the enemy's final
outburst before greatly decreasing the war's in
tensity and coming to the bargaining table. Per
haps it will turn out that way, but right now the
evidence does not lend the theory much support.
