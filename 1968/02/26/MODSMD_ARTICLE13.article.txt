## Parke-Davis Ignores Drug's Danger 
### Drew Pearson 
Following revelations in this
column two weeks ago that the
powerful drug Chloromycetin
had caused deaths when doctors
prescribed it for minor diseases,
the office of Sen. Gaylord Nel
son, D-Wis., received a number
of pathetic phone calls. The calls
told of children who had died
when given Chloromycetin by
erring doctors.
In all, Chloromycetin is pre
scribed in perhaps four million
cases a year, when it should be

prescribed only for such rare
diseases as typhoid fever and
Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
The reason doctors make mis
takes is the wide advertising
given to the drug by its manu
facturers, Parke-Davis, in the
first place, and the fact that
warnings have never caught up
with the advertising. This has
been brought out during Sen.
Nelson's subcommittee hearings.
This week Sen. Nelson will hold
further hearings.
Extensive Advertising
He has already shown that
Parke-Davis continued promo
tional activities regarding Chlo
romycetin with the same inten
sity as during the initial market
ing when the seriousness of
potentional side effects were not
fully known.
"There can be no question,"
testified Dr. William Dameshek,
"that the continued widespread
advertising of chloramphenicol
(Chloromycetin) and of promo
tional activities by detail men
tend to increase the use of this
drug."
He disclosed that in a suit
brought against Parke-Davis and
the prescribing physician by
heirs of a woman who died after
taking Chloromycetin, the court
held that Parke-Davis's heavy
promotional campaign complete
ly canceled out the written warn
ings. As a result, Parke-Davis
was held liable for the woman's

death and was ordered to pay
her family $180,000.
"No more than maybe 10 per
cent of the people receiving the
drug should have had it," testi
fied Dr. Dameshek.
Dr. James Weston, state medi
cal examiner for Utah, also testi
fied that in almost every known
case of serious blood disorders
caused by Chloromycetin, the
antibiotic was perscribed for a
condition for which it should
not have been given at all.
In January 1967, the Califor
nia State Medical Society and
the California Department of
Public Health presented a re
port on Chloromycetin to the
California legislature revealing
that the risks of aplastic anemia
following Chloromycetin were
far greater than what had been
thought to be the case.
What Sen. Nelson wants to
know, and will ask at the next
hearing, is why the Food and
Drug Administration did not
vigorously notify doctors of this
information.
Formal Warning
In April 1966, a memorandum
was sent to the deputy director
of the Food and Drugs Bureau
of Medicine from the acting di
rector of its division of antibio
tic drugs urging that the FDA
"take a critical second look at
chloromphenicol as a 'first pri
ority' project."
The memo noted that it had

been proposed in September
1965, that possible labeling re
adjustments of the drug be a
subject for discussion by the
Drug Research Board at their
meeting in October 1965.
However, the discussion was
dropped from the agenda.
The question is — why? Was
it because of pressure from drug
manufacturing interests? Sen.
Nelson wants to know the ans
wer.
He will urge the Food and
Drug Administration to adopt
a new policy of sending a "dear
doctor" letter to the medical
profession warning against Chlo
romycetin and other dangerous
drugs when they become a men
ace to human life.
If such a letter had been sent
to doctors some time ago, a good
many American lives could have
been saved.
Doctors are so overworked
these days that most of them
don't have time for extensive re
search reading; hence the ten
dency to let drug company ad
vertising outweigh drug com
pany warnings.
Added Information
The sudden dispatch of more
troops to South Vietnam and
LBJ's flight across the continent
to say goodbye to them has
brought inquiries as to when his
son-in-law, Capt. Chuck Robb of
the Marine Corps, is going to
take off for Saigon.

President Kennedy's alleged
statement to his secretary, Eve
lyn Lincoln, that he would dump
LBJ as Vice President in '64
supposedly was made three days
before JFK flew to Dallas and
his death. This was when John
son was urging him not to go
to Dallas, that it was a political
mistake. . . .
It's true that the late Presi
dent sometimes made impulsive
statements which he didn't
mean. It's probable that his
brother Bobby's statement is
more accurate — namely, that
JFK always planned to run
again with LBJ on the ticket.
Late in the year 1963, Ken
nedy had reached a low ebb with
Congress, critical books were
getting wide circulation, and he
needed Southern strength to win.
Gov. Terry Sanford of North
Carolina, an A-l man, was high
ly unpopular in the South and
probably couldn't have carried
his own state. . . .
