# LBJ From Texas
## 
### Max Lerner 
It is not that I am writing
about Lyndon Johnson in Texas,
but about him as he looks from
Texas. I am on the campus of
the University of Texas for a
visit of several days, at an an
nual conference of the student
body.
We have talked a little about
politics, mostly about changes in
the way students feel about the
world and themselves. But all
through our discussions I have
been unable to escape the sense
of the presence of the man from
Texas who sits in the lonely
chair in Washington and whose
policies and power have done so
much to see the frame for what
will be happening to these young
people.
I don't say that Texas is any
more or less America than New
York is, or California, although
if I had to pick any three states
which together come closer to
summing up America, in its
weaknesses and strengths, I
wouldn't be able to.
Each of these three is a little
empire in itself: feudal and mod
ern. Each contains black and
white, North American and
Latin-American, the extremes of
rich and poor, the extremes of
the left and right.
Special Cases
But things have moved more
rapidly in Texas and California,
from the feudal to the modern,
than anywhere else. And per
haps in Texas there has been a
greater holdover from the feu
dal, while the modern was be
ing overlaid on it.
Hence, the persistence of the
old-fashioned populism in Tex
as, and (as one recalls an epi
sode in Dallas) the feel of feu
dal violence, along with the more
contemporary strain of liberal
ism.
I suppose I have really been
describing Lyndon Johnson
while trying to describe Texas.

All three strains go to make
up Mr. Johnson: the persisting
Populist, the feudal chietan op
erating as overload in his little
fief in Texas and in his larger
one in Washington, the contem
porary liberal who genuinely
feels the need now (even if
once he didn't) of disolving the
hard-core of poverty and of over
coming the economic social and
educational disabilities of the
Negroes.
Obviously, LBJ is in deeper
trouble right now than ho has
been for several years. So is
the American nation. It has an
army of half a million men half
way around the world engaged
in a vicious and brutal war with
mounting casualty lists. The
enemy has just shown a dis
concerting burst of strength,
craftiness and aggressiveness.
There have been peace feelers
on which men of good will, both
in America and abroad, have
been hanging for some sign of
hope for ending the war, but
few would say seriously today
that Hanoi or the Viet Cong
mean the feelers as anything
beyond tactical moves for a bet
ter position in future negotia
tions.
Neither the crisis of the war
nor the disenchantment over the
peace moves has united the peo
ple behind the President and the
Administration.
Because President Johnson
and the nation are in trouble, the
Presidents ordeal is as difficult
and lonely as any President has
encountered since Franklin Roo
sevelt in the early phase of
World War 11, perhaps even
since Lincoln's. LBJ took the oc
casion of Lincoln's birthday to
emphasize the parallel between
Lincoln's ordeal and his own.
Lincoln's Action
Lincoln, he said, "heard the
charges that the war was long
and wrong. He saw Americans

die ... he brooded. He saw dis
sent, riot and rebellion."
And Lincoln's response? "Sad
but steady, always convinced of
his cause â€” he stuck it out."
And the President nailed down
the moral parallel: "Sad but
steady, so will we."
If we ask what gave sanction
to Lincoln's ordeal and that of
the states that supported him,
the answer is that Lincoln was
making the supreme effort to
hold the Union together in a
civil war. But the civil war to
day is not between the North
and South in America, but be
tween the North and South in
Vietnam.
One of the tasks of an Amer
ican President is to be an edu
cator. And the President is in
deep trouble exactly because he
has not been able to persuado
the nation that it has the moral
right to be involved in what a
considerable segment of world
opinion describes as someone
else's civil war.
Saving Characteristics
Yet one sees also here on the
Texas campus what will carry
Mr. Johnson and the nation
through the ordeal, even if sad
der and less stead than he is
willing to admit.
One thing is the American
drive to find a consensus amid
the ethnic and regional plural
isms of the society.
A second is the determination
to permit and even embrace dis
sent, but not to allow it to be
come divisive action and vio
lence.
A third is the belief in a basic
cement that holds America to
gether even while it is tragically
split.. Adam Smith once said
there is "a vast deal of ruin in
a nation." The conviction that
there is a vast deal of ruin in
America may be a mystique, but
it is all the stronger for being
so.
