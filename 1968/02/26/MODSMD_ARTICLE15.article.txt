Perfect Draft Law."

The decision by the President
in the late winter of 1968 to
draft hitherto-deferred graduate
students proved widely unpopu
lar.
The universities were most un
happy at the prospect of losing
their most intelligent, most eag
er, most questioning young
minds. And the Army was equal
ly unhappy at the prospect of
getting them.
"A soldier who demonstrates
an intelligent, eager, questioning
mind," said General Zip K. Zupp
gloomily, "is asking for a court
martial."
But most unhappy of all were
the geneticists.
"This is a tragic step back
ward," said Dr. Homer T. Petti
bone, D.V.M., author of "Whith
er Homo Sapiens?" and other
works.
"Our wise policy of drafting
only those too poor to go to
college or too stupid to stay
there was working wonders. By

sending these poor, siupid young
men off to kill each other before
they could breed, we were well
on our way to becoming a na
tion of rich, clever Americans."
Economists were equally ap
palled. "It makes no sense," they
said irritably, "to defer any col
lege students at all. Why in
struct a young man in the his
tory of Etruscan vase paintings
and then send him off to be
shot? It's a disgraceful waste
of public funds."
Nor. were the sociologists at
all pleased. "If the only way to
avoid being shot is to present
evidence of sexual perversions,
psychic aberrations, or criminal
convictions, what's to become of
our society?"
Nor were such dire predictions
unfounded. Poor, stupid young
men bred untrammeled. Rich,
educated young men were killed
in foreign climes at great waste
of public funds. And as for the
clever . . . Well, the U.S. was
in grave danger of becoming a
nation of homosexual, bed-wet
ting bank robbers.
"We are fighting this war, like
any war, for the good of our
country," said the President
thoughtfully. "So maybe we

ought to change the draft law."
Thus Congress, after long
study and debate, unanimously
passed what became known as
"The Perfect Draft Law."
The same mental and physical
tests were given young men fac
ing induction. But to satisfy the
geneticists only those were
drafted who flunked.
To appease economists, the
draft age was lowered to 14,
thus saving the costs of not only
a college, but a high school edu
cation. And at the behest of so
ciologists young men who later
evidenced any abnormal inclina
tions—sexual, criminal, or polit
ical—were automatically reclas
sified I-A.
Everybody was happy with
the new law. Educators were
happy not to have to deal with
the stupid. The taxpayers were
happy not to have to deal with
the poor. The Army was delight
ed with its new recruits "who
display the greatest quality of
any soldier," as General Zapp
put it, "unquestioning obedi
ence."
And it was widely held that
the poor, stupid, uneducated,
criminal American boys falling
in distant lands died happy in

the secure knowledge that they
were giving their lives to make
this country a better place in
which to live.
• * *
But none was happier than the
President. "I promised to wipe
out poverty, stupidity, ignor
ance, and crime and I can now
see the light at the end of the

tunnel," he said happily, "if only
we can keep this war going for
another generation."
That proved easy. At last
America became a nation of
rich, intelligent, well-educated,
law-abiding citizens. In tribute
to the vision of the late Presi
dent the new era was called, of
course, "The Great Society."

The decision by the President
in the late winter of 1968 to
draft hitherto-deferred graduate
students proved widely unpopu
lar.
The universities were most un
happy at the prospect of losing
their most intelligent, most eag
er, most questioning young
minds. And the Army was equal
ly unhappy at the prospect of
getting them.
"A soldier who demonstrates
an intelligent, eager, questioning
mind," said General Zip K. Zupp
gloomily, "is asking for a court
martial."
But most unhappy of all were
the geneticists.
"This is a tragic step back
ward," said Dr. Homer T. Petti
bone, D.V.M., author of "Whith
er Homo Sapiens?" and other
works.
"Our wise policy of drafting
only those too poor to go to
college or too stupid to stay
there was working wonders. By

sending these poor, siupid young
men off to kill each other before
they could breed, we were well
on our way to becoming a na
tion of rich, clever Americans."
Economists were equally ap
palled. "It makes no sense," they
said irritably, "to defer any col
lege students at all. Why in
struct a young man in the his
tory of Etruscan vase paintings
and then send him off to be
shot? It's a disgraceful waste
of public funds."
Nor. were the sociologists at
all pleased. "If the only way to
avoid being shot is to present
evidence of sexual perversions,
psychic aberrations, or criminal
convictions, what's to become of
our society?"
Nor were such dire predictions
unfounded. Poor, stupid young
men bred untrammeled. Rich,
educated young men were killed
in foreign climes at great waste
of public funds. And as for the
clever . . . Well, the U.S. was
in grave danger of becoming a
nation of homosexual, bed-wet
ting bank robbers.
"We are fighting this war, like
any war, for the good of our
country," said the President
thoughtfully. "So maybe we

ought to change the draft law."
Thus Congress, after long
study and debate, unanimously
passed what became known as
"The Perfect Draft Law."
The same mental and physical
tests were given young men fac
ing induction. But to satisfy the
geneticists only those were
drafted who flunked.
To appease economists, the
draft age was lowered to 14,
thus saving the costs of not only
a college, but a high school edu
cation. And at the behest of so
ciologists young men who later
evidenced any abnormal inclina
tions—sexual, criminal, or polit
ical—were automatically reclas
