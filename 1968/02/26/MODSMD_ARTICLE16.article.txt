# The 						Nebbish Speaks
## The 						Pains Of Draft Dodging 
### Marshall Schwartz 
One bright, sunny June day,
Newton Fenwick got a suspi
cious-looking letter. It began:
"From the President of the
United States. To Newton Fen
wick. Greetings."
When Fenwick came out of
his coma, he sprinted off to his
local Anti-Draft Union headquar
ters for advice.
"Hmm," said Mario Draft
dodger, local ADU organizer.
"You've got problems there, kid.
How 'bout taking a look at these
pamphlets we've got here?"
Fenwick scooped up whatever
he could get his hands on and
rushed home, as Draftdodger
turned back to his project of the
day, forging 1000 signatures on
a "We Won't Go" petition.
Fenwick Searches
Back in his dingy pad, Fen
wick sat down for a long night's
reading. As he read more and
more, and found less and less
that could save him from his
horrible fate, a deep pall settled
over him.
Suddenly, he found something:
an innocuous government docu
ment entitled "Form AR 40-501,
Medical Service: Standards of
Medical Fitness."
He rummaged through it ex
citedly. And there, on page A 3-1,
he found what he was looking
for: Appendix 111, Table I, Table
of Militarily Acceptable Weight
(in Pounds) as Related to Age
and Height for Males â€” Initial
Procurement.
Hurriedly Fenwick scanned
the page. "Let's see ... 20 years
old . . . five foot ten . . . AHA!
The maximum weight is 214
pounds."
Fenwick made some quick
calculations. "I weigh 170 now
. . . physical in two weeks . . .
That means I have to gain five
and-a-half pounds a day. I can
do it!"
Food's Effect
So for the next two weeks,
Fenwick gorged himself on sev
en meals a day, with snacks
every hour on the hour. He soon
became sick at the sight of a
refrigerator, and grew faint
when he neared a restaurant.
But he wouldn't give up.
"This is as bad as dying," he
proclaimed, "but it will save
me from a fate worse than
death."
When the day of his physical
came, Fenwick weighed a mag
nificent 220 pounds.
The Army was more tTian hap
py to classify him IV-F. They
gave him his papers, and Fen
wick wobbled home a happy
man.
He immediately started a
crash diet. "Got to get back in
shape," he said.

For the next month Fenwick
ate only one sparse meal a day.
He exercised regularly, walking
to work each morning and work
ing out in a gymnasium every
evening.
He was soon back to his ori
ginal 170 pounds. He felt proud
of what he had pulled off, and
soon began bragging to his
friends (whom he had assidu
ously avoided while overweight)
about the feat.
He was a happy man. . . .

About 3 a.m. one morning sev
eral months after his triumph,
Fenwick, sleeping peacefully in
bed, was awakened by a loud
knock on his door.
He stumbled out of bed,
knocked over a lamp and two
chairs on his way to a light
switch, and finally opened the
door.
"Who the hell are you?" he
growled at two men, both wear
ing trenchcoats and gray faces.
"We're from the FBI," they
barked back, as they simultan
eously pulled gray badges from
their gray trenchcoats with their
gray hands and flashed them at
Fenwick.
"What the hell do you want?"
"Is your name Newton Fen
wick?"
"Yeah. So what?"
"Classified IV-F by Selective
Service System Local Board No.
25, District 50, last June 29?"
Unfortunate Failure
"Yeah. Now will you get to
the point or get the hell out of
here?"
"Mr. Fenwick, for violation of
the Selective Service Act, we
hereby place you under arrest."
"What?!?!?!? What did I do?"
"The law states that if you

are ever classified IV-F for phy
sical reasons, and the physical
disability which caused such
classification disappears, you
must notify your draft board
within ten days. And we have
information you are no longer
overweight. Sorry, Mr. Fenwick,
but you're in too good shape.
Come along."
Moral: Chloesterol is good for
your health.
