## US Unleashes Air Might 
### Michael Sweeney 
President Johnson escalated
his long-standing feud with the
press last week. He ordered a
bombing attack on Hanoi Radio,
according to the Associated
Press.
Naturally it's well known that
a major communist infiltration
route goes right through the
rest room at Hanoi Radio, but
the air strike probably had polit
ical as well as military signifi
cance.
After a 500 pound bomb has
liberated Hanoi Radio, the Pres
ident would presumably like to
use the same heavy-handed cen
sorship on his other vocal
critics.
We can imagine a tense meet
ing of the National Security
Council somewhere in a dark
cavern near Washington. Walter
Rostow pulls a thick document
out of his briefcase and clears
his throat authoritatively.
"Mr. President. . .
"Get to the point, Walt. West
moreland is on the phone, and
he says he's got this crazy gook
in his office waving a tommy
gun around like r he owns the
place or something."
"Mr. President, I just want
to make it clear I'm against any

piecemeal bombing of CBS. It
won't do any good at all to send
B-25's to attack the New York
studio. Even if we get Walter
Cronkite, they can keep their
news operation going with Har
ry Reasoner in Washington.
Another Problem
"What's that Westy? You say
that gook is telling you to send
planes to bomb Saigon? Well,
gun or no gun—you just tell
him American planes don't
bomb Saigon except when it's
full of VC. Now hold the phone
a minute, Westy." The Presi
dent turns to Rostow.
"Walt, I think you're right.
You tell General Doom to bomb
out CBS in Washington too . . ."
"And Cleveland?"
"Yes, and Cleveland too. .
"And Los Angeles?"
"All right. . ."
"And Chicago? They have a
studio in Chicago."
"Well for Chrissake bomb all
their studios. And do a good
job, too. I don't want to hear
any more irresponsible specula
tion on the 6:30 news tonight."
"What about ABC, NBC, and
the Wall Street Journal, Chief?
Secretary Rusk was talking
about them too when he criti

cized the irresponsible specula
tion of the press. . ."
"You say the gook's going to
shoot you if you don't send
those bombers to hit Saigon,
Westy? Look, that's crazy. How
the hell did he get inside your
office, anyway?. . . . He's actu
ally your valet? And you never
thought he was a gook? Well,
It looks like you were wrong,
Westy. Hold the phone a sec
ond." The President impatiently
turns to Rostow.
"Oh hell, go ahead and bomb
them."
"Do you authorize use of na
palm and incendiaries?"
"Why do you need them to
get a newspaper?"
"It will start their newsprint
burning, Mr. President. . . "
"Fine, you sock it to 'em, Walt
. . . what's that, Westy, You
say the gook doesn't want you
to hit Saigon any more? Be
cause the VC control Saigon
now? He wants you to send
them to bomb our aircraft car
riers?"
"Now look here, Westy, you
know if they sank our carriers
we'd have no way to make our
next air strike on Hanoi
Radio. . . "

"It will start their newsprint
burning, Mr. President. . . "
"Fine, you sock it to 'em, Walt
. . . what's that, Westy, You
say the gook doesn't want you
to hit Saigon any more? Be
cause the VC control Saigon
now? He wants you to send
them to bomb our aircraft car
riers?"
"Now look here, Westy, you
know if they sank our carriers
we'd have no way to make our
next air strike on Hanoi
Radio. . . "
President Johnson escalated
his long-standing feud with the
press last week. He ordered a
bombing attack on Hanoi Radio,
according to the Associated
Press.
Naturally it's well known that
a major communist infiltration
route goes right through the
rest room at Hanoi Radio, but
the air strike probably had polit
ical as well as military signifi
cance.
After a 500 pound bomb has
liberated Hanoi Radio, the Pres
ident would presumably like to
use the same heavy-handed cen
sorship on his other vocal
critics.
We can imagine a tense meet
ing of the National Security
Council somewhere in a dark
cavern near Washington. Walter
Rostow pulls a thick document
out of his briefcase and clears
his throat authoritatively.
"Mr. President. . .
"Get to the point, Walt. West
moreland is on the phone, and
he says he's got this crazy gook
in his office waving a tommy
gun around like r he owns the
place or something."
"Mr. President, I just want
to make it clear I'm against any

piecemeal bombing of CBS. It
won't do any good at all to send
B-25's to attack the New York
studio. Even if we get Walter
Cronkite, they can keep their
news operation going with Har
ry Reasoner in Washington.
Another Problem
"What's that Westy? You say
that gook is telling you to send
planes to bomb Saigon? Well,
gun or no gun—you just tell
him American planes don't
bomb Saigon except when it's
full of VC. Now hold the phone
a minute, Westy." The Presi
dent turns to Rostow.
"Walt, I think you're right.
You tell General Doom to bomb
out CBS in Washington too . . ."
"And Cleveland?"
"Yes, and Cleveland too. .
"And Los Angeles?"
"All right. . ."
"And Chicago? They have a
studio in Chicago."
"Well for Chrissake bomb all
their studios. And do a good
job, too. I don't want to hear
any more irresponsible specula
tion on the 6:30 news tonight."
"What about ABC, NBC, and
the Wall Street Journal, Chief?
Secretary Rusk was talking
about them too when he criti

cized the irresponsible specula
tion of the press. . ."
"You say the gook's going to
shoot you if you don't send
those bombers to hit Saigon,
Westy? Look, that's crazy. How
the hell did he get inside your
office, anyway?. . . . He's actu
ally your valet? And you never
thought he was a gook? Well,
It looks like you were wrong,
Westy. Hold the phone a sec
ond." The President impatiently
turns to Rostow.
"Oh hell, go ahead and bomb
them."
"Do you authorize use of na
palm and incendiaries?"
"Why do you need them to
get a newspaper?"
"It will start their newsprint
burning, Mr. President. . . "
