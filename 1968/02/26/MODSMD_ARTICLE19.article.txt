# Letters To The Editor
## Professor Sneedâ€” On IJB Last Year 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Despite Mr. Sapir's assertion
to the contrary made in his let
ter appearing in the Feb. 21
Dally, I am not presently Chair
man of the Interim Judicial
Body. My service on that body
terminated in June, 1967.

Prof. Sneed Termed
Competent And Honest
Editor, The Dally:
Marc Sapir's letter (Feb. 21
Dally) combines three separate
questions: Prof. Joseph Sneed's
personal views, his competence
as chairman of the Interim Judi
cial Body, and the legality of
that body, in vicious innuendo.
The disposition of our case be
fore the Interim Judicial Body
two years ago, though we lost
the appeal, demonstrated to us
Prof. Sneed's extraordinary com
petence and integrity.
Mr. Sapir is entitled to ques
tion the jurisdiction of the IJB.
He may be right. But the argu
ment is best conducted without
giving vent to half-baked per
sonal slurs.

Grad Draft Deferments
Show World's Insanity
Editor, The Dally:
What are you trying to tell
us in your editorial on the draft
changes? Everyone should sit
back and relax; the draft does
n't want Grad students anyway?
But why don't they want Grad
students? Because Grad stu
dents won't go. Because Grad
students won't cooperate with
the system.
And because the Draft Boards
KNOW this. So what's wrong
with this, "Sit back and every
thing will be 0.K."
If we don't want to be part
of the insanity in Vietnam (or
Korea, or Thailand, or Chile, or
... ) then we must let the
powers that be know we are not
going to fight their war for
them. And now. And I don't
mean with letters.
