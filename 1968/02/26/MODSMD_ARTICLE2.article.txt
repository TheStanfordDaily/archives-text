# No Changes Expected
## New Draft Regs Final 
### RICHARD ANTHONY College Press Service News Analysis 
WASHINGTON (CPS) — The
chances that Congress will fight
the Johnson Administration's re
cently announced policy on the
draft can be described in a word
—slim.
Last Friday the Administra
tion let it be known that almost
all graduate deferments were
being eliminated, and that the
long-standing policy of drafting
the oldest draft-eligible males
first would be retained.
Since then there have been
public statements by individual
members of Congress opposing
the policy. Sen. Edward Ken
nedy, for example, told a Boston
audience last Monday that he
plans to submit a bill that would
bring about basic changes in
draft procedures, and two New
York Congressmen said in the
House that day that the new
policy would severely retard the
nation's educational progress.
These men, however, are not
in positions to get Congress mov
ing on the draft. The real power
in questions connected with the

military rests with legislators
like Rep. Mendel Rivers (D.,
S.C.) and Sen. Richard Russell
(D., Ga.) ( chairmen of the armed
services committees in their re
spective branches of Congress.
Neither has referred public
ly to the Administration's new
policy. An assistant to Rivers,
however, has pointed out that
the policy comes close to what
his committee recommended
after Its draft hearings last
year. One of Russell's aides
said that as far as he knew
the senator has no plans to
reconsider the draft question.
Another crucial figure in the
matter of possible Congressional
action on the draft is Rep. Ed
ward Hebert (D., La.), who
chairs a House subcommittee
that studied the draft last year.
Hebert, according to one of his
aides, has been deluged with
mail from critics of the Admin
istration's draft policy.
Nevertheless, the Congress
man has come out publicly in
favor of the new draft mea
sures. In a statement prepared
Tuesday he said, "It would be
absolutely intolerable to contin
ue to insulate graduate students
from the hazards of combat
which we require other young
men to face."
Hebert cited some Defense
Department statistics suggest
ing that only one-quarter of the
draft-age men who have gradu
ated from college would be
taken. He concluded from the
statistics that graduate schools
would not be as badly hurt as
they think, and that college
graduates would not be taken in
disproportionate numbers. The
statistics, however, are mislead
ing for several reasons.
The Administration has said
that it will need 240,000 draftees
during Fiscal Year 1969. But if
the Vietnam war continues to
escalate, the number of needed

draftees is likely to grow sub
stantially.
Further, If local draft boards
decide to continue most occu
pational deferments (which
are now a local-board option,
under Friday's ruling), then
the burden will fall more
heavily on college graduates
than present estimates sug
gest
In spite of the fact that the
Defense Department's statistics
are misleading, however, mem
bers of Congress can be expect
ed to fall back on the Defense
Department's figures to put off
angry constituents. During a
shooting war, with elections
only months away, most of them
will try to stay away from con
troversial questions like the
draft.
There are a few ways this sit
uation could be changed. First,
it's conceivable that a mass let
ter-writing campaign by stu
dents, educators, and others con-
cerned could stir Congress to
action. Whether it would then
move to take some of the draft
burdon off college graduates,
though, is impossible to say.
There is still strong sentiment
in Congress against letting grad
students stay out of the Army.
Conceivably the Army could
bring pressure to bear on its
friends in Congress to change
the draft policy. Army officials
have told reporters that they
don't want a high proportion of
college graduates coming in as
draftees, so the Army might
push for a policy that would
guarantee the drafting of some
younger men along with the
"oldest first."
These are two possibilities,
then, but at the moment they
seem to be distant ones. There
is no evidence of widespread dis
satisfaction in Congress over,
the Administration's draft poli
cies. If that dissatisfaction is
ever to be created, it will prob
ably require strong pressures
from outside.
