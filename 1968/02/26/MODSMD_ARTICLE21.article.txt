# Invested Cautiously
## Is Endowment Used Well? 
### ROBERT SPANNER 
Stanford, like many American
universities, is approaching a
financial state of affairs best de
scribed as critical. Tuition keeps
increasing, but costs are rising
even more swiftly. Federal
grants have been cut back. The
gift program is going well, but
other sources of University fi
nancing are receiving closer
scrutiny.
One potential source of in
creased income is the Stanford
endowment fund.
The history of this $243 mil
lion financial edifice is intrigu
ing. The original grant by Le
land Stanford amounted to $21
million, and 8,800 acres of Stan
ford farmlands.
In the terms of his endow
ment grant. Stanford himself
a rail magnate, stipulated that
all monies he had contributed
and all future endowment
gifts, had to be invests in
rail bonds.
Unfortunately railroads de

clined in importance with the
advent of the automobile and
the airplane. The value of rail
bonds declined commensurately.
The stock market crash of
1929 drastically reduced the
value of the Stanford endow
ment portfolio, and rails showed
no signs of recovery.
In 1936, the Trustees went to
court, led by trustee Herbert
Hoover, to petition that Sen.
Stanford's rail bond stipulation
be set aside. The Santa Clara
County Superior Court granted
the request.
Since that time, the value of
the Stanford endowment fund
has slowly and steadily in
creased. In the last ten years,
additional gifts of $74 million
and capital appreciation have
raised total endowment from
$95 million to $243 million.
When compared with other
private universities in the
United States, Stanford stands
sixth in size of endowment,
behind Harvard, Yale, M.1.T.,
Princeton, and the University

of Chicago. But Stanford is
only 29th in endowment per
student.
These statistics are somewhat
misleading, though, because the
University is carrying the Stan
ford lands on the books at its
original pre-1900 valuation. Ad
ditional real estate development
would add significantly to en
dowment worth.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice
president for finance, says that
out of the 8,800 acres, "only
about 2,000 are now being used
intensively. In addition, 600 have
been condemned for the state
highway now being built across
Stanford land, and 700 acres
have been developed" for such
projects as the Shopping Center
and the Industrial Park.
The Stanford endowment fund
is invested by the Committee of
Investment of the Board of
Trustees, whose members are
Edmund W. Littlefield, chair
man, Fred H. Merrill, vice chair
man, James F. Kraft, David
Packard, and Gardner Symonds.

The Investment Committee
must strive for growth of the
fund, while at the same time
providing a continuous source
of income for current University
operations.
These are conflicting goals.
Companies that offer the great
est potential for growth plow
most of their profits back into
the business and pay out very
little in dividends. Companies
that pay out large dividends ob
viously cannot expand swiftly.
So if the Investment Committee
invests in the stock of growth
companies, it must forego in
come, and if it invests in com
panies with large dividend pay
ments, it must do without rapid
increases in the value of the
stock.
One possible solution to this
predicament might be to invest
for capital appreciation (in
crease in the price of a stock)
and then sell the appreciated
stock, using the proceeds to fi
nance University expenditures.
This plan, in essence, was pro
posed by Yale Treasurer John
B. Ecklund in 1966, and is being
employed there.
Unfortunately, It is illegal
—at least for a substantial
portion of endowment assets.
Individuals often stipulate in
their endowment grants that
only income (i.e. stock divi
dends or bond payments) that
accrues may be used for Uni
versity expenses. Not only the
initial endowment, but even
the capital gains from the Ini
tial endowment cannot be
spent, and must be reinvested.
Cuthbertson said 70 per cent
of Stanford endowment assets
are of this type.
On second examination, how
ever, this is not a serious ob
stacle to investing for capital
agins income. The University
only has 40 per cent of its en
dowment assets in stock right
now, anyway.' If a substantial
portion of the unrestricted 30
per cent of endowment assets
were invested for capital gains,
a successful investment policy
could yield considerable income.
Capital gains play only a
minor role in Stanford invest
ment decisions now. Fixed In
come assets amount to 60 per
cent of the total. For college
endowment funds In general,
the situation is exactly re
versed —only 43 percent In
fixed income assets, and P>7
percent In common stock.
Harvard holds 57 per cent of
its assets in common stock, Cal

tech 58 per cent, Cornell 63 per
cent, and at Princeton, an in
credible 76 per cent in common
stock.
The percentage of common
stock holdings are an indication
of desire for capital gains, be
cause only stock appreciates
much in price. Fixed income as
sets, like bonds, increase in value
very little, if at all.
Cuthbertson did not defend
Stanford's current portfolio mix.
'There is no reason why trus
tees shouldn't pick high growth
opportunities," he said.
Over the past eleven years,
Stanford's capital appreciation
has been slow, because assets
are usually Invested in com
panies as solid as the rook of
Gibralter — and whose stock
prices are about as Immovable.
In the eleven-year period, the
annual rate of return (income
plus price appreciation) has av
eraged 7.7 per cent, of which 4
per cent was income, 2 per cent
can be attributed to inflation,
and 1.7 per cent represents real
appreciation.
Other universities are not as
conservative. Harvard holds $5.5
million worth of stock in the
areospace industry, $11 million
in the electronics industry, $48
million in office equipment, in
cluding $45 million in IBM alone,
and $25 million in photography,
including $9 million in Polaroid,
one of the "hottest" stocks in
the market. Harvard was able
to attain a 3.2 per cent income
return despite these "growth"
investments.
Princeton is another good ex
ample of an aggressive invest
ment policy aimed at capital
gains. Of the total assets invest
ed in common stock, $16 million,
or 6 per cent, is in the electron
ics industry, $16 million (an
other 6 per cent) in IBM. and
$20 million (7 per cent) in Xerox.
There is no denying that the
Stanford portfolio of common
stocks is sound; it is absolutely
safe from any severe decrease
or increase, in value. The lar
gest holdings are in public uti
lities, oils, banks, and foods,
among the most stable of the
stock groups.
McGeorge Bundy, president of
the Ford Foundation, has cri
ticized university investment pol
icy as too conservation. He has
called for increased emphasis
upon investing for capital gain.
Bundy's remarks sound as
though they were directed at
The Stanford Investment Com
mittee.
