# Haight Street To Be Mall On Weekends
## 
### 
Police and hippies ran up the
truce flag in the Haight-Ashbury
section of San Francisco Sunday
after a week of tension there
following a small riot Sunday,
Feb. 18.

Police officers stationed them
selves at points along Haight
Street to ward off traffic as hip
pies turned the usually heavily
traveled street into a pedestrian
mall.
And a group of two dozen
hippies, armed with brooms,
started at one end of Haight
Street and proceeded to clean
up the accumulated filth.
The scene was a switch from
the violence of last week when
bottle-throwing hippies and tear
gas-armed police battled it out
for four hours.
The pedestrian mall idea was
apparently the result of a hip
pie petition to ban traffic from
Haight Street during the week
ends, when many part-time hip
pies flock to that section of San
Francisco. The petition was pre
sented to city authorities Friday
during a City Hall demonstra
tion.
The Feb. 18 riot began when
a crowd of nearly 400 hippies
crowded into Haight Street to
protest a near-miss by a woman
driver. Police called to the scene
used tear gas, chemical Mace,
and four-foot riot sticks to quell
the disturbance.
