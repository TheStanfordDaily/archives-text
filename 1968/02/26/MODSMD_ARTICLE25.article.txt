## Ram's Head True To Genet's Intent 
### JEAN DUCHESNE 
Ram's Head's production of
Jean Genet's The Maids was
very good. It is unfortunate that
no review of the play could have
appeared in the Daily before
Saturday night's final perform
ance.
Genet enjoys a very bad repu
tation, which he has always
managed to increase successful
ly. The reason for. this is not
solely that Genet is a pure homo
sexual, for there would be little
of theatrical interest in that
alone. The important thing is
that Genet admits his homosex
uality, and neither wants to nor
can speak of anything else.
Moreover, Genet writes so ac
curately and beautifully that
any moralizing concern is
eclipsed by the truth and beauty
he captures—even if it is the
truth and beauty of perversion.
Genet's Theater
Theater especially suits Genet,
for no art is more deceiving or
perverse. Jean-Paul Sartre, Ge
net's most famous and effective
supporter, although not a homo
sexual himself, considers The
Maids the masterpiece of Ge
net's work.
There are no maids in Genet's
world. So he demanded that
women's roles be played by
adolescent boys. Louis Jouvet,
who first produced the play, did
not dare to do so, but Flam's
Head did, thus restoring the play
to its whole strength and sig
nificance.
The author's well-known taste
for young males is a superficial
explanation of this request re
garding the actors. There is,
however, nothing really new or
shocking about such a request.
The first Alcestis was a boy,
and the first Juliet too. A cen
tury before Genet, Baudelaire
expressed the same wish in his
diary Mon Coeur mis a nu.
Initial Shock
Of course the audience is
shocked when Richard Rekow
and Dennis Johnson, featured
as the maids Solange and
Claire, first appear wearing
high-heeled shoes and austere
black dresses with white collars
and showing carefully-planned
feminine gestures.
The disturbance is even great
er when Richard Opolach, as
Madame, displays the handsome
ness of an equivocal Siegfried.
Yet one soon forgets the feel
ing of uneasiness. Director
Howard Brown's stroke of gen
ius was not to ask his actors to
wear falsies, change their voices
radically or make believe they

were really women and nothing
else.
What were they then? They
were solely members of Genet's
world, neither boys nor girls,
and in Ram's Head's production
their identification with that
world was perfect. What re
mains, of the play, is Genet's
dream, and the game he uses as
a substitute for reality.
Everything in this world is
ambiguity, lies and illusion and
the theater is naturally the best
way of representing this uni
verse. One catches a glimpse of
games inside games inside
games. The final impression is
a striking, overwhelming impo
tence.
The Ram's Head production
has succeeded in presenting a
frequently missed aspect of the
play.. Sartre thinks that, al
though "Claire and Solange are
much less differentiated than
Maurice and Lefranc in Death
watch," Solange actually embod
ies the secret cowardice of the
dazzling criminal, as Claire is
the girl queen who has more
real courage. The physical dif
ference between black-haired,
stronglybuilt Richard Rekow
and thin, younger-looking Den
nis Johnson, suggests another
more satisfactory interpreta
tion.
The Interpretation
It appears that Solange pos
sesses Genet's capacity of
dreaming and his incapacity for
action, as Claire incarnates ra
ther what Genet would like to
be and yet wants to destroy.
It also becomes evident that
Richard Opolach brings forth a
new understanding of Madame.
His (or her) glamour conveys
ambiguity. In Sartre's words,
she is "a girl queen in relation
to Monsieur and a boy queen in
relation to the two maids." But
one cannot agree that she em
bodies "social Good and Good
Conscience." This kindness
toward the maids is incorrect.
Madame loves being loved by
her maids, and it seems that her.
interest in Claire must be more
than patronizing.
Yet, the play is, after all, con
troversial and Genet himself
would be disturbed if everyone
understood (or thought they un
derstood) him. A possible rea
son for the distaste of some
viewers is that prejudice pre
vented them from entering Ge
net's world. Perhaps they fear
that they might not be able to
escape from that world. If one
does not move into Genet's uni
verse the play must, of neces
sity, be uninteresting.

His (or her) glamour conveys
ambiguity. In Sartre's words,
she is "a girl queen in relation

interest in Claire must be more

Yet, the play is, after all, con
troversial and Genet himself
would be disturbed if everyone
understood (or thought they un
derstood) him. A possible rea
son for the distaste of some
viewers is that prejudice pre
vented them from entering Ge
net's world. Perhaps they fear
that they might not be able to
escape from that world. If one
does not move into Genet's uni
verse the play must, of neces
sity, be uninteresting.
Ram's Head's production of
Jean Genet's The Maids was
very good. It is unfortunate that
no review of the play could have
appeared in the Daily before
Saturday night's final perform
ance.
Genet enjoys a very bad repu
tation, which he has always
managed to increase successful
ly. The reason for. this is not
solely that Genet is a pure homo
sexual, for there would be little
of theatrical interest in that
alone. The important thing is
that Genet admits his homosex
uality, and neither wants to nor
can speak of anything else.
Moreover, Genet writes so ac
curately and beautifully that
any moralizing concern is
eclipsed by the truth and beauty
he captures—even if it is the
truth and beauty of perversion.
Genet's Theater
Theater especially suits Genet,
for no art is more deceiving or
perverse. Jean-Paul Sartre, Ge
net's most famous and effective
supporter, although not a homo
sexual himself, considers The
Maids the masterpiece of Ge
net's work.
There are no maids in Genet's
world. So he demanded that
women's roles be played by
adolescent boys. Louis Jouvet,
who first produced the play, did
not dare to do so, but Flam's
Head did, thus restoring the play
to its whole strength and sig
nificance.
The author's well-known taste
for young males is a superficial
explanation of this request re
garding the actors. There is,
however, nothing really new or
shocking about such a request.
The first Alcestis was a boy,
and the first Juliet too. A cen
tury before Genet, Baudelaire
expressed the same wish in his
diary Mon Coeur mis a nu.
Initial Shock
Of course the audience is
shocked when Richard Rekow
and Dennis Johnson, featured
as the maids Solange and
Claire, first appear wearing
high-heeled shoes and austere
black dresses with white collars
and showing carefully-planned
feminine gestures.
The disturbance is even great
er when Richard Opolach, as
Madame, displays the handsome
ness of an equivocal Siegfried.
Yet one soon forgets the feel
ing of uneasiness. Director
Howard Brown's stroke of gen
ius was not to ask his actors to
wear falsies, change their voices
radically or make believe they

were really women and nothing
else.
What were they then? They
were solely members of Genet's
world, neither boys nor girls,
and in Ram's Head's production
their identification with that
world was perfect. What re
mains, of the play, is Genet's
dream, and the game he uses as
a substitute for reality.
Everything in this world is
ambiguity, lies and illusion and
the theater is naturally the best
way of representing this uni
verse. One catches a glimpse of
games inside games inside
games. The final impression is
a striking, overwhelming impo
tence.
The Ram's Head production
has succeeded in presenting a
frequently missed aspect of the
play.. Sartre thinks that, al
though "Claire and Solange are
much less differentiated than
Maurice and Lefranc in Death
watch," Solange actually embod
ies the secret cowardice of the
dazzling criminal, as Claire is
the girl queen who has more
real courage. The physical dif
ference between black-haired,
stronglybuilt Richard Rekow
and thin, younger-looking Den
nis Johnson, suggests another
more satisfactory interpreta
tion.
The Interpretation
It appears that Solange pos
sesses Genet's capacity of
dreaming and his incapacity for
action, as Claire incarnates ra
ther what Genet would like to
be and yet wants to destroy.

verse. One catches a glimpse of
games inside games inside
games. The final impression is
a striking, overwhelming impo

The Ram's Head production
has succeeded in presenting a
frequently missed aspect of the
play.. Sartre thinks that, al
though "Claire and Solange are
much less differentiated than
Maurice and Lefranc in Death
watch," Solange actually embod
ies the secret cowardice of the
dazzling criminal, as Claire is
the girl queen who has more
real courage. The physical dif
ference between black-haired,
stronglybuilt Richard Rekow
and thin, younger-looking Den
nis Johnson, suggests another
more satisfactory interpreta
tion.
The Interpretation
It appears that Solange pos
sesses Genet's capacity of
dreaming and his incapacity for
action, as Claire incarnates ra
ther what Genet would like to
be and yet wants to destroy.
It also becomes evident that
Richard Opolach brings forth a
new understanding of Madame.
His (or her) glamour conveys
ambiguity. In Sartre's words,
she is "a girl queen in relation
to Monsieur and a boy queen in
relation to the two maids." But
one cannot agree that she em
bodies "social Good and Good
Conscience." This kindness
toward the maids is incorrect.
Madame loves being loved by
her maids, and it seems that her.
interest in Claire must be more
than patronizing.
Yet, the play is, after all, con
troversial and Genet himself
would be disturbed if everyone
understood (or thought they un
derstood) him. A possible rea
son for the distaste of some
viewers is that prejudice pre
vented them from entering Ge
net's world. Perhaps they fear
that they might not be able to
escape from that world. If one
does not move into Genet's uni
verse the play must, of neces
sity, be uninteresting.
Ram's Head's production of
Jean Genet's The Maids was
very good. It is unfortunate that
no review of the play could have
appeared in the Daily before
Saturday night's final perform
ance.
Genet enjoys a very bad repu
tation, which he has always
managed to increase successful
ly. The reason for. this is not
solely that Genet is a pure homo
sexual, for there would be little
of theatrical interest in that
alone. The important thing is
that Genet admits his homosex
uality, and neither wants to nor
can speak of anything else.
Moreover, Genet writes so ac
curately and beautifully that
any moralizing concern is
eclipsed by the truth and beauty
he captures—even if it is the
truth and beauty of perversion.
Genet's Theater
Theater especially suits Genet,
for no art is more deceiving or
perverse. Jean-Paul Sartre, Ge
net's most famous and effective
supporter, although not a homo
sexual himself, considers The
Maids the masterpiece of Ge
net's work.
There are no maids in Genet's
world. So he demanded that
women's roles be played by
adolescent boys. Louis Jouvet,
who first produced the play, did
not dare to do so, but Flam's
Head did, thus restoring the play
to its whole strength and sig
nificance.
The author's well-known taste
for young males is a superficial
explanation of this request re
garding the actors. There is,
however, nothing really new or
shocking about such a request.
The first Alcestis was a boy,
and the first Juliet too. A cen
tury before Genet, Baudelaire
expressed the same wish in his
diary Mon Coeur mis a nu.
Initial Shock
Of course the audience is
shocked when Richard Rekow
and Dennis Johnson, featured
as the maids Solange and
Claire, first appear wearing
high-heeled shoes and austere
black dresses with white collars
and showing carefully-planned
feminine gestures.
The disturbance is even great
er when Richard Opolach, as
Madame, displays the handsome
ness of an equivocal Siegfried.
Yet one soon forgets the feel
ing of uneasiness. Director
Howard Brown's stroke of gen
ius was not to ask his actors to
wear falsies, change their voices
radically or make believe they

were really women and nothing
else.
What were they then? They
were solely members of Genet's
world, neither boys nor girls,
and in Ram's Head's production
their identification with that
world was perfect. What re
mains, of the play, is Genet's
dream, and the game he uses as
a substitute for reality.
Everything in this world is
ambiguity, lies and illusion and
the theater is naturally the best
way of representing this uni
verse. One catches a glimpse of
games inside games inside
games. The final impression is
a striking, overwhelming impo
tence.
