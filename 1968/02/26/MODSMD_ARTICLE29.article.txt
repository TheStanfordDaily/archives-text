# Reagan Meets The Press
## Smooth Show In Sacramento 
### D. MeGUIRE News Analysis 
It is 9:30 a.m. every Tuesday
morning, time for the Ronald
Reagan show. Here he is, ladies
and gentlemen, in the flesh. A
big man, wide shouldered, his
blunt features crinkling up into
a gleaming smile. Now he is at
the podium, serious, sincere, a
lifeguard who got drafted by
the debate team.
This is a no-nonsense Mid
westerner, not one of those
flashy Easterners or plastic An
gelenos who would call you
Reuben. You would buy an en
cyclopedia from this man any
time, and you can count on get
ting the five-volume, color illu
strated suppliment that he prom
ised.
A reporter jests, and the
aging athlete takes one step
backward, clapping his hands
together, barely restraining
himself from slapping his knee.
He could be exhorting his play
ers to win this last one for the
fighting Irish, or blasting an
other Zero out of the sky.
Later one of Reagan's media
relations staff, Nancy Reynolds,
adds to the governor's image.
Nancy is thirtyish (the "ish"
counts for about ten years) with
short, forthrightly bleached
hair and eyes that look right at
you. No, the governor never had
any evidence that there were
homosexuals on his staff. He re
fused to drag any human beings
and their families down into the
muck with Drew Pearson. If he
has to take the consequences for
his honesty and compassion,
well, so be it.
Yes, the governor writes
almost all his own material,
although Lyn Nofzinger might
outline a speech for him once
in a while. Why, we have a ter
rible time just trying to keep
up with him. He is liable to go
off to South Bend and ad lib for
15 or 20 minutes.
No, he does not read many
books, but he is terribly well
informed. He debated Bobby

Kennedy on television, and we
were all just amazed at his
fund of knowledge about Viet
nam. He must have picked it
up on the mashed-potatoes cir
cuit, between the end of his
movie career and the time he
was elected governor.
What is wrong with this pic
ture? From a practical point of
view nothing. This is exactly
what the American people want
and deserve. The show gets very
high ratings.
Reagan was facing eight 16
milimeter sound cameras dur
ing his Tuesday press confer
ence, along with two television
cameras. The cameramen took
footage of Reagan, footage of
reporters asking questions of
Reagan, and footage of each
other taking pictures of Reagan.
The man who was the focus of
this attention did not have much
to say. He repeated for the
nausienth time that he does not
want to be President or Vice
President of the United States.
He discussed a budget that, in
perfect consistancy with both
his philosophy and dread reality,
involves a record amount of
money and substantial cuts in
aid to universities and the medi
cally indigent.
Such facts are not really im
portant. If the people of Cali
fornia really want to provide
a university education for every
one, they will do so eventually.
But what they want right now
is a good show. Given the huge
appetite of the media, the show
must have certain features
which will guarantee continued
public interest in it.
1) The production must seem
important. We all know that Rea
gan can do very little to affect
the daily life of the average Cal
ifornian. But the use of such de
vices as "millions of dollars"
and"the Republican nomina
tion" give the thing an illusion
of relevance.
2) It must have characters
with whom the public can identi
fy—good guys and bad guys.

The unique feature of the Rea
gan show is that the good guys
and the bad guys are inter
changable, depending on your
viewpoint. For some people the
big fellow with the soft voice
is the archangel. For others he
is the arch fiend. The anti-fiend
or unangel is the press.
According to a theory sub
scribed to by many academici
ans, the press is the adversary
of the public figure. The job of
the newsman is to probe, expose,
embarrass, keep them honest.
Some journalists actually be
lieve that this is their function.
But the fact is that the press
and the politician arc symbiants,
not foes.
The mutual dependence of
Reagan and the media-men is
so obvious as to be hardly worth
describing. Without all those
cameras and inquiring minds in
front of him, Reagan would be
a public servant rather than a
public figure. Without Reagan
to probe, expose, and perhaps
despise, the reporters and photo
graphers would be among the
unemployable that Reagan has
to support.

cameras. The cameramen took
footage of Reagan, footage of
reporters asking questions of
Reagan, and footage of each
other taking pictures of Reagan.
The man who was the focus of
this attention did not have much
to say. He repeated for the
nausienth time that he does not
want to be President or Vice
President of the United States.
He discussed a budget that, in
perfect consistancy with both
his philosophy and dread reality,
involves a record amount of
money and substantial cuts in
aid to universities and the medi
cally indigent.
Such facts are not really im
portant. If the people of Cali
fornia really want to provide
a university education for every
one, they will do so eventually.
But what they want right now
is a good show. Given the huge
appetite of the media, the show
must have certain features
which will guarantee continued
public interest in it.
1) The production must seem
important. We all know that Rea
gan can do very little to affect
the daily life of the average Cal
ifornian. But the use of such de
vices as "millions of dollars"
and"the Republican nomina
tion" give the thing an illusion
of relevance.
2) It must have characters
with whom the public can identi
fy—good guys and bad guys.

The unique feature of the Rea
gan show is that the good guys
and the bad guys are inter
changable, depending on your
viewpoint. For some people the
big fellow with the soft voice
is the archangel. For others he
is the arch fiend. The anti-fiend
or unangel is the press.
According to a theory sub
scribed to by many academici
ans, the press is the adversary
of the public figure. The job of
the newsman is to probe, expose,
embarrass, keep them honest.
Some journalists actually be
lieve that this is their function.
But the fact is that the press
and the politician arc symbiants,
not foes.
The mutual dependence of
Reagan and the media-men is
so obvious as to be hardly worth
describing. Without all those
cameras and inquiring minds in
front of him, Reagan would be
a public servant rather than a
public figure. Without Reagan
to probe, expose, and perhaps
despise, the reporters and photo
graphers would be among the
unemployable that Reagan has
to support.
It is 9:30 a.m. every Tuesday
morning, time for the Ronald
Reagan show. Here he is, ladies
and gentlemen, in the flesh. A
big man, wide shouldered, his
blunt features crinkling up into
a gleaming smile. Now he is at
the podium, serious, sincere, a
lifeguard who got drafted by
the debate team.
This is a no-nonsense Mid
westerner, not one of those
flashy Easterners or plastic An
gelenos who would call you
Reuben. You would buy an en
cyclopedia from this man any
time, and you can count on get
ting the five-volume, color illu
strated suppliment that he prom
ised.
A reporter jests, and the
aging athlete takes one step
backward, clapping his hands
together, barely restraining
himself from slapping his knee.
He could be exhorting his play
ers to win this last one for the
fighting Irish, or blasting an
other Zero out of the sky.
Later one of Reagan's media
relations staff, Nancy Reynolds,
adds to the governor's image.
Nancy is thirtyish (the "ish"
counts for about ten years) with
short, forthrightly bleached
hair and eyes that look right at
you. No, the governor never had
any evidence that there were
homosexuals on his staff. He re
fused to drag any human beings
and their families down into the
muck with Drew Pearson. If he
has to take the consequences for
his honesty and compassion,
well, so be it.
Yes, the governor writes
almost all his own material,
although Lyn Nofzinger might
outline a speech for him once
in a while. Why, we have a ter
rible time just trying to keep
up with him. He is liable to go
off to South Bend and ad lib for
15 or 20 minutes.
No, he does not read many
books, but he is terribly well
informed. He debated Bobby

Kennedy on television, and we
were all just amazed at his
fund of knowledge about Viet
nam. He must have picked it
up on the mashed-potatoes cir
cuit, between the end of his
movie career and the time he
was elected governor.
What is wrong with this pic
ture? From a practical point of
view nothing. This is exactly
what the American people want
and deserve. The show gets very
high ratings.

blunt features crinkling up into
a gleaming smile. Now he is at
the podium, serious, sincere, a
lifeguard who got drafted by
the debate team.
This is a no-nonsense Mid
westerner, not one of those
flashy Easterners or plastic An
gelenos who would call you
Reuben. You would buy an en
cyclopedia from this man any
time, and you can count on get
ting the five-volume, color illu
strated suppliment that he prom
ised.
A reporter jests, and the
aging athlete takes one step
backward, clapping his hands
together, barely restraining
himself from slapping his knee.
He could be exhorting his play
ers to win this last one for the
fighting Irish, or blasting an
other Zero out of the sky.
Later one of Reagan's media
relations staff, Nancy Reynolds,
adds to the governor's image.
Nancy is thirtyish (the "ish"
counts for about ten years) with
short, forthrightly bleached
hair and eyes that look right at
you. No, the governor never had
any evidence that there were
homosexuals on his staff. He re
fused to drag any human beings
and their families down into the
muck with Drew Pearson. If he
has to take the consequences for
his honesty and compassion,
well, so be it.
Yes, the governor writes
almost all his own material,
although Lyn Nofzinger might
outline a speech for him once
in a while. Why, we have a ter
rible time just trying to keep
up with him. He is liable to go
off to South Bend and ad lib for
15 or 20 minutes.
No, he does not read many
books, but he is terribly well
informed. He debated Bobby

Kennedy on television, and we
were all just amazed at his
fund of knowledge about Viet
nam. He must have picked it
up on the mashed-potatoes cir
cuit, between the end of his
movie career and the time he
was elected governor.
What is wrong with this pic
ture? From a practical point of
view nothing. This is exactly
what the American people want
and deserve. The show gets very
high ratings.
Reagan was facing eight 16
milimeter sound cameras dur
ing his Tuesday press confer
ence, along with two television
cameras. The cameramen took
footage of Reagan, footage of
reporters asking questions of
Reagan, and footage of each
other taking pictures of Reagan.
The man who was the focus of
this attention did not have much
to say. He repeated for the
nausienth time that he does not
want to be President or Vice
President of the United States.
He discussed a budget that, in
perfect consistancy with both
his philosophy and dread reality,
involves a record amount of
money and substantial cuts in
aid to universities and the medi
cally indigent.
Such facts are not really im
portant. If the people of Cali
fornia really want to provide
a university education for every
one, they will do so eventually.
But what they want right now
is a good show. Given the huge
appetite of the media, the show
must have certain features
which will guarantee continued
public interest in it.
1) The production must seem
important. We all know that Rea
gan can do very little to affect
the daily life of the average Cal
ifornian. But the use of such de
vices as "millions of dollars"
and"the Republican nomina
tion" give the thing an illusion
of relevance.
2) It must have characters
with whom the public can identi
fy—good guys and bad guys.

The unique feature of the Rea
gan show is that the good guys
and the bad guys are inter
changable, depending on your
viewpoint. For some people the
big fellow with the soft voice
is the archangel. For others he
is the arch fiend. The anti-fiend
or unangel is the press.
According to a theory sub
scribed to by many academici
ans, the press is the adversary
of the public figure. The job of
the newsman is to probe, expose,
embarrass, keep them honest.
Some journalists actually be
lieve that this is their function.
But the fact is that the press
and the politician arc symbiants,
not foes.
The mutual dependence of
Reagan and the media-men is
so obvious as to be hardly worth
describing. Without all those
cameras and inquiring minds in
front of him, Reagan would be
a public servant rather than a
public figure. Without Reagan
to probe, expose, and perhaps
despise, the reporters and photo
graphers would be among the
unemployable that Reagan has
to support.
It is 9:30 a.m. every Tuesday
morning, time for the Ronald
Reagan show. Here he is, ladies
and gentlemen, in the flesh. A
big man, wide shouldered, his
blunt features crinkling up into
a gleaming smile. Now he is at
the podium, serious, sincere, a
