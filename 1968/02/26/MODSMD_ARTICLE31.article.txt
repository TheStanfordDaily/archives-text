# Griffin Has Hot Hand
## Tribe Stuns Beavers, Dumps Ducks 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford finally found that
pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow last weekend, as the
Indians came from behind to
stun Oregon State 70-67 in over
time Friday night, and out
classed Oregon 83-75 Saturday.
The twin victories enabled the
Tribe to grab a share of fifth
place in the Pacific-8 with a 4-6
mark.
On both occasions It was
Don Griffin and Art Harris
supplying the offensive punch
and triggering the key rallies
for Stanford. The hot-shoot
ing duo combined for 41 points
Friday night and 47 Saturday.

Sophomore Chuck Moore was
also instrumental in the two
wins, hitting 12 points the first
night and 13 the next.
Friday night's game was one
of the most exciting of the year
in the Pavilion. Coach Howie
Dallmar's club rallied in the
final three minutes to erase a
seemingly insurmountable 11-
point deficit.
Harris* inability to hit from
the field and a great shooting
exhibition by OSU's Vince Fritz
enable the favored visitors to
hold the whip hand throughout
the first half of play. The Beav
ers' lead ranged from two to
eight points, with a Fritz jump

er at the buzzer giving them a
28-22 edge at halftime.
The Indians, who managed
only eight field goals in the first
20 minutes of play, gnawed
away at the Beaver lead in the
second half, as Griffin, Harris,
Moore and 6-5 Mai McElwain
began to find the range. But
two 20-foot jumpers by Fritz,
four 25-foot sets by Jim Henry,
and three tip-ins by seven-footer
Vic Bartolome kept the Tribe
from getting too close.
Stanford switched to a man
to-man defense in the final five
minutes, with Harris hounding
Fritz all over the court, and it
paid off when the Beavers made

three costly turnovers and
forced several shots. The Tribe,
sparked by Griffin's outside
shooting, closed to seven at 57-
50, but when Fritz and Gary
Freeman nailed 20-foot jumpers,
it looked like a case of too little
too late.
Despite trailing 61-50 with
only 3:14 to go, the scrappy
Indians failed to collapse.
Five straight points by Grif
fin on a jumper and a three
point play trimmed the lead to
six, at 61-55. Freeman scored
what proved to be OSU's last
two points in regulation play on
a drive, and then Harris and
Moore scored six straight points
between them to make it 63-61.
One minute of play remained,
with the Indians still two points
back, and OSU had yet to miss
a free throw. Then little Mike
Markham went to the line with
46 seconds left and missed,
breaking a string of 15 straight
Beaver foul shots. McElwain
grabbed the rebound and fired
to Harris, who was fouled with
40 seconds remaining.
Harris missed the first of
his oneand-one situation, and
6-9 Freeman corralled the re
bound for OSU. Harris made
a great effort to block a driv
ing one-hander by Markham
with 24 seconds remaining,
but was called for a two-shot
foul.
Unbelievably, Markham was
short with both free throws, and
Stanford's Steve Kuchenbecker
soared into the rafters to haul
in the rebound of the second
shot.
Griffin took what figured to
be the final shot with six sec
onds left, but it caromed off the
back rim. OSU's 7-0 Bartolome
and 6-9 Freeman went up to
gether for the rebound, and jug
gled it between them for one
fleeting instant. That was all
southpaw McElwain needed, as
he quick-handed the ball away
from the two big men and layed
it in from the left side with two
seconds showing on the clock.
was bedlam in the Stan
ford wigwam.
Freeman and Moore matched
20-foot jumpers in the opening
minute of the overtime period,
but Griffin tanked five
straight points to lock it up for
'he In lians.
Two free throws by Freeman
larrowcd the gap to three
oints, but neither toam could
score in the final minute. Fritz
wis slightly off the mark on his
Lr.st two shots, with McElwain
knd Harris pulling down the

vital rebounds to preserve the
70-67 victory.
Things came a little easier
to Stanford Saturday night.
Oregon stayed close through
out the game, due largely to a
fine scoring exhibition by Ken
Smith, but the issue was never
In doubt during the final 11
minutes.
A six-minute scoring draught
by Stanford enable the Ducks
to lead for four minutes in the
first half, but Griffin, Harris,
and Moore combined to produce
a 38-35 advantage for the home
club by the intermission.
Oregon led only once in the
second half, briefly holding a
44-43 edge. But a McElwain
jumper quickly erased it, and
Stanford was in control there
after.
Moments later Griffin canned
eight straight points during one
two-minute stretch, en route to
his finest game of the year. The
junior backcourt ace hit 12 of
14 attempts from the floor in a
devastating performance.
With Griffin hitting from all
angles, Moore scorching the nets
from the top of the key, and
Harris scoring well underneath,
the Indians gradually built up
an 11-point lead. Five points by
Oregon's Smith in the closing
minute narrowed the gap to
eight, 83-75, at the final buzzer.
