# Poteete's Shutout Salvages Split
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
Rod Poteete's four hit, 6-0
shutout gave the Stanford Base
ball Indians a split in a double
header Saturday with the Santa
Clara Broncos, after Sandy
Vance lost his first game at Stan
ford in 26 decisions in the open
ing contest by a score of 4-1.
The split gave the Tribe their
first loss and a weekend record
of 2-1, as they downed the Uni
versity of San Francisco 2-0 Fri
day, behind the masterful pitch
ing of Harvey Shank.
Shank got the Tribe off on the
right foot for the weekend as
he fired a twohit shutout over
the Dons. The towering right
hander threw only 96 pitches,
striking out five. He walked
none, going to a count of three
balls on only one batter.
Jeff Rohlfing, who was the
Tribe hitting star with two
doubles, scored the first run in
the fifth when he doubled and
came home on Russ Tweet's
single. The Indians added an
other tally in the sixth when
Mike Schomaker singled, stole
second, and scored on Ron
Boone's base hit.
In the first game Saturday
against Santa Clara Stanford
outhit the Broncos 9-7 but just
could not get a good rally go
ing against righthander Pete
Boyle until the last two in
nings.
The Broncos managed to
score twice off of Vance. In the
first Pete McMonigle walked,
stole second and scored on Tim
McAnany's double. Santa Clara
added another in the sixth on
three successive singles by Fred
Ott, Hank Mott, and Rod Dom
mer.

REELING ROD — Tribe Hurler Rod Poteeto demonstrates the unique form that brought him a 6 0
shutout win over Santa Clara. The baffled Broncos could manage only four hits off the 6-7 right
hander.
Rod Poteete's four hit, 6-0
shutout gave the Stanford Base
ball Indians a split in a double
header Saturday with the Santa
Clara Broncos, after Sandy
Vance lost his first game at Stan
ford in 26 decisions in the open
ing contest by a score of 4-1.
The split gave the Tribe their
first loss and a weekend record
of 2-1, as they downed the Uni
versity of San Francisco 2-0 Fri
day, behind the masterful pitch
ing of Harvey Shank.
Shank got the Tribe off on the
right foot for the weekend as
he fired a twohit shutout over
the Dons. The towering right
hander threw only 96 pitches,
striking out five. He walked
none, going to a count of three
balls on only one batter.
Jeff Rohlfing, who was the
Tribe hitting star with two
doubles, scored the first run in
the fifth when he doubled and
came home on Russ Tweet's
single. The Indians added an
other tally in the sixth when
Mike Schomaker singled, stole
second, and scored on Ron
Boone's base hit.
In the first game Saturday
against Santa Clara Stanford
outhit the Broncos 9-7 but just
could not get a good rally go
ing against righthander Pete
Boyle until the last two in

The Broncos managed to
score twice off of Vance. In the

stole second and scored on Tim
McAnany's double. Santa Clara
added another in the sixth on

REELING ROD — Tribe Hurler Rod Poteeto demonstrates the unique form that brought him a 6 0
shutout win over Santa Clara. The baffled Broncos could manage only four hits off the 6-7 right
hander.
Rod Poteete's four hit, 6-0
shutout gave the Stanford Base
ball Indians a split in a double
header Saturday with the Santa
Clara Broncos, after Sandy
Vance lost his first game at Stan
ford in 26 decisions in the open
ing contest by a score of 4-1.
The split gave the Tribe their
first loss and a weekend record
of 2-1, as they downed the Uni
versity of San Francisco 2-0 Fri
day, behind the masterful pitch
ing of Harvey Shank.
Shank got the Tribe off on the
right foot for the weekend as
he fired a twohit shutout over
the Dons. The towering right
hander threw only 96 pitches,
striking out five. He walked
none, going to a count of three
balls on only one batter.
Jeff Rohlfing, who was the
Tribe hitting star with two
doubles, scored the first run in
the fifth when he doubled and
came home on Russ Tweet's
single. The Indians added an
other tally in the sixth when
Mike Schomaker singled, stole
second, and scored on Ron
Boone's base hit.
In the first game Saturday
against Santa Clara Stanford
outhit the Broncos 9-7 but just
could not get a good rally go
ing against righthander Pete
Boyle until the last two in
nings.
The Broncos managed to
score twice off of Vance. In the
first Pete McMonigle walked,
stole second and scored on Tim
McAnany's double. Santa Clara
added another in the sixth on
three successive singles by Fred
Ott, Hank Mott, and Rod Dom
mer.

Rohlfing had a perfect day
at the plate with two doubles
and a single as he continued
his hot hitting. Marquess had
two singles and a double in lour
trips, while Schomaker singled
twice, drove in 3 runs, and stole
his third base in his last three
games, which is not bad for a
catcher.

REELING ROD — Tribe Hurler Rod Poteeto demonstrates the unique form that brought him a 6 0
shutout win over Santa Clara. The baffled Broncos could manage only four hits off the 6-7 right
hander.
Rod Poteete's four hit, 6-0
shutout gave the Stanford Base
ball Indians a split in a double
header Saturday with the Santa
Clara Broncos, after Sandy
Vance lost his first game at Stan
ford in 26 decisions in the open
ing contest by a score of 4-1.
The split gave the Tribe their
first loss and a weekend record
of 2-1, as they downed the Uni
versity of San Francisco 2-0 Fri
day, behind the masterful pitch
ing of Harvey Shank.
Shank got the Tribe off on the
right foot for the weekend as
he fired a twohit shutout over
the Dons. The towering right
hander threw only 96 pitches,
striking out five. He walked
none, going to a count of three
balls on only one batter.
Jeff Rohlfing, who was the
Tribe hitting star with two
doubles, scored the first run in
the fifth when he doubled and
came home on Russ Tweet's
single. The Indians added an
other tally in the sixth when
Mike Schomaker singled, stole
second, and scored on Ron
Boone's base hit.
In the first game Saturday
against Santa Clara Stanford
outhit the Broncos 9-7 but just
could not get a good rally go
ing against righthander Pete
Boyle until the last two in
nings.
The Broncos managed to
score twice off of Vance. In the
first Pete McMonigle walked,
stole second and scored on Tim
McAnany's double. Santa Clara
added another in the sixth on
three successive singles by Fred
Ott, Hank Mott, and Rod Dom
mer.
