# Santa Clara Swims By Frosh; Spitz, Ferris Smash Records
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The Encina Pool rocked to
some of the fastest swimming
performances in history last
weekend. The Santa Clara Swim
Club smashed two American rec
ords in a 58-55 victory ove- the
Stanford frosh Saturday. The
Papooses broke three NCAA
freshman records.
The two teams tubed six pool
records In a meet where many
of the winning times ranged
more than two seconds faster
than the best varsity collegiate
times of the season.
In the featured race of the
meet, Mark Spitz of Santa
Clara bettered his own Amer
ican record in the 200 butterfly
to beat John Ferris of the
Stanford frosh. Spitz chugged
home in 1:50.5, a yard ahead
of Ferris who lowered the
NCAA freshman standard to
1:51.4.
Ferris and Spitz traded owner
ship of the 200 meter world rec
ord last summer. The nation's
best varsity 200 fly is 1:55.3.
Santa Clara's 400 medley re
lay of Ray Rivero, Brian Job,
Spitz, and Greg Buckingham
wiped UCLA off the board with
an American record 3:29.2.
Fred Haywood, Ken Terry,
Ferris, and Bob Jamison were
close behind at 3:31.1, leaving
Yale's old record of 3:33.8 rude
ly In the lurch.
Haywood led off for the frosh
in 52.9, only three tenths off his

AAU championship backstroke
time and a new NCAA freshman
record.
Santa Clara's Brian Job left
jaws gaping as he churned to
a 58.7 breaststroke leg to
move Into the lead. The Amer
ican record for 100 breast
stroke Is 58.4. Spitz flew to a
49.0 100 butterfly to hand over
a body-length lead to Bucking
ham.
Buckingham sealed the fate of
his sixth American record with
a 46.9 freestyle anchor leg. Buck
ingham also won the 200 and
500 freestyles in the meet.
Haywood edged Rivero in the
200 backstroke at 1:56.9. Hay
wood's new pool and Stanford
freshman record is nearly two
seconds faster than the nation's
best varsity time this year.
Brian Job firmly established
himself as one of the United
States' brightest hopes in the
breaststroke with burning 2:11.0
200 breast. Nobody else except
Santa Clara teammate Dave
Schilling (2:13.1) has gone fast
er than 2:14.7 this year.
Bert Mason hit his best 500
ever, swimming 4:55.7 to pluck
second place for the frosh be
hind Buckingham.
Gary Preble decisively aced
both low board and high board
diving events for the Papooses.
The diving at times provided
comic relief from the din of
crashing records in the adja
cent racing pool. Since both

Santa Clara and the frosh had
only one diving entry, each
team recruited a suicide pig
eon from the ranks of daring
swimmers to vie for the gra
tuitous third place.
Rob Jensen, with a little help
from his friends, metamor
phosed into a picture of subtle
gracefulness, improvised si x
dives, and earned the frosh two
second places. Would you believe
bravery beyond the call of duty?
This could be the last time. . . .
The frosh host Alameda High
next Friday at 3:00 p.m. in the
Papooses' final home meet.
