# Cal Ruggers Upset Indians In Come From Behind Win
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
A determined California rug
by squad outplayed Stanford
throughout most of Saturday's
match, but still had to come
from behind to upset the fa
vored Indians 15-13.
Stanford will now have to beat
Cal by three points or more next
weekend at Berkeley to get back
Ihe Scrum Axe, awarded annual
ly to the team with the highest
point total in the two games.
Superlative kicking by Cal
was mainly responsible for
the victory. Fullback Les Wil
liams booted three long penal
ty goal*, and he and fly half
Brian Forbes kept the Stan
ford attack constantly at bay
with long, accurate kicking
into touch.
Meanwhile, Stanford's stal
warts Mike Forster. and Ray
Wilson both were having theii
troubles finding touch with any

consistency.
The Bears also solved the size
able problem of what to do
about Blaine Nye in the line
outs. The Cal throw ins were
low, line-drive style bullets to
the front man in the line, and
Nye rarely was able to get a
hand on the ball.
A long booming penalty kick
by Cal's Williams opened the
scoring. After Stanford ace Leon
Hartvickson missed a long at
tempt, Gene Moffet got a little
anxious and was called for off
side. Williams again connected
to make the score 6-0.
But the Tribe more than
made up for 41 minutes of un
inspired first half play by
scoring two tries in the last
four minutes.
Wing Jack Alustiza chalked up
the first one, taking a pass from
Moffet, floating down the side
line, and cutting inside to touch

the ball down dead center be
tween the posts. Almost before
the crowd had a chance to get
resettled, John Huss took a pass
from Dave Evans after a fine
kick and run by Dave McQueen,
and romped over from five yards
out. Hartvickson converted both
to end the half at 10-6, Stanford.
The second half saw two pen
alty kicks, one a tantalizing lob
by Hartvickson that floated over
with inches to spare, and a 30
yarded by Williams. But Cal
added two tries, one by Peter
Carter midway in the half, and
the winning try by the Cal wing
on an overlap situation in the
waning minutes.
The match was extremely
hard fought arid the game was
stopped five times for injuries.
However, Stanford sustained no
serious damage and should be
ready for. next Saturday's con
test.

kick and run by Dave McQueen,
and romped over from five yards
out. Hartvickson converted both
to end the half at 10-6, Stanford.
The second half saw two pen
alty kicks, one a tantalizing lob
by Hartvickson that floated over
with inches to spare, and a 30
yarded by Williams. But Cal
added two tries, one by Peter
Carter midway in the half, and
the winning try by the Cal wing
on an overlap situation in the
waning minutes.
The match was extremely
hard fought arid the game was
stopped five times for injuries.
However, Stanford sustained no
serious damage and should be
ready for. next Saturday's con
test.
A determined California rug
by squad outplayed Stanford
throughout most of Saturday's
match, but still had to come
from behind to upset the fa
vored Indians 15-13.
Stanford will now have to beat
Cal by three points or more next
weekend at Berkeley to get back
Ihe Scrum Axe, awarded annual
ly to the team with the highest
point total in the two games.
Superlative kicking by Cal
was mainly responsible for
the victory. Fullback Les Wil
liams booted three long penal
ty goal*, and he and fly half
Brian Forbes kept the Stan
ford attack constantly at bay
with long, accurate kicking
into touch.
Meanwhile, Stanford's stal
warts Mike Forster. and Ray
Wilson both were having theii
troubles finding touch with any

consistency.
The Bears also solved the size
able problem of what to do
about Blaine Nye in the line
outs. The Cal throw ins were
low, line-drive style bullets to
the front man in the line, and
Nye rarely was able to get a
hand on the ball.
A long booming penalty kick
by Cal's Williams opened the
scoring. After Stanford ace Leon
Hartvickson missed a long at
tempt, Gene Moffet got a little
anxious and was called for off
side. Williams again connected
to make the score 6-0.
But the Tribe more than
made up for 41 minutes of un
inspired first half play by
scoring two tries in the last
four minutes.
Wing Jack Alustiza chalked up
the first one, taking a pass from
Moffet, floating down the side
line, and cutting inside to touch

the ball down dead center be
tween the posts. Almost before
the crowd had a chance to get
resettled, John Huss took a pass
from Dave Evans after a fine
kick and run by Dave McQueen,
and romped over from five yards
out. Hartvickson converted both
to end the half at 10-6, Stanford.
