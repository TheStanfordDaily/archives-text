## Civil Liberty Primer 
### 
If a policeman stopped you on
the street and began asking you
questions, would you know ex
actly when you're entitled to
shut up? If not, read on.

In this age of civil liberties
controversy, individuals often
are hard pressed to keep up
with the implications of recent
court decisions. Yet, everyday,
law enforcement officers acci
dentally, and on rare occasions
deliberately, violate the rights
of citizens.
The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) of Georgia has
prepared a booklet aimed at
Negroes in Atlanta describing a
citizen's rights in the areas of
arrest, questioning, search, and
seizure. This article draws heav
ily on that publication.
"Did you see what happened?
Do you know John Smith?" If
a policeman asks you a question
about something that does not
pertain to you personally, it is
your duty to help him. In some
instances you may be prosecuted
for refusing such aid.
However, If the officer asks
"What are you doing here?"
or any other question about
you personally, you need not

answer. AH you are required
to give Is your name and ad
dress.
If you believe the policeman
is accusing you of a crime, ask
him immediately: "Am I under
arrest?" If he answers yes, ask
him: "What for?" If you are
under arrest you do not have to
answer any more questions.
Whatever you tell the policeman
could be held against you.
If he says "No, you are not
under arrest," you should ask
"May I go?" If he says NO to
that, you ARE under arrest and
do not have to answer any more
questions.
During questioning you
have a right to counsel. If you
you ask to have a lawyer
present immediately after ar
rest, you may refuse to an
swer any questions or sign
any statement until he arrives.
If you do not have the money
to hire an attorney, you may de
mand a free lawyer when
charged with a crime that might
send you to jail. This lawyer
is bound by the codes of his pro
fession to take your side.
Try to remember the badge
number of the arresting officer
and what he looks like, as well

as what both you and he say. If
you believe that you are being
unjustly harrassed or arrested
by the officer, do not resist. The
illegality of his action will be
considered by the courts.
A policeman does not have
the right to search your per
son unless you are being ar
rested or he has a search war
rant. Even If he searches you
when you do not believe he
has the right, do not resist.
You may tell him: "I do not
give you permission to search
me."
If the police seize anything
of yours from your room, your
car or your person—ask for a
written receipt if they do not
offer you one. This receipt
should come from the officer
who took your property, not
someone else.
At this preliminary hearing or
arraignment the judge should
set a reasonable bail. You should
have a lawyer for this hearing.
He may object if the bail is set
too high.
As soon as you are arrested,
you are permitted to make a
reasonable number of phone
calls (not Just one!) — AT
ONCE.

you ask to have a lawyer
present immediately after ar
rest, you may refuse to an
swer any questions or sign
any statement until he arrives.
If you do not have the money
to hire an attorney, you may de
mand a free lawyer when
charged with a crime that might
send you to jail. This lawyer
is bound by the codes of his pro
fession to take your side.
Try to remember the badge
number of the arresting officer
and what he looks like, as well

as what both you and he say. If
you believe that you are being
unjustly harrassed or arrested
by the officer, do not resist. The
illegality of his action will be
considered by the courts.
A policeman does not have
the right to search your per
son unless you are being ar
rested or he has a search war
rant. Even If he searches you
when you do not believe he
has the right, do not resist.
You may tell him: "I do not
give you permission to search
me."
If the police seize anything
of yours from your room, your
car or your person—ask for a
written receipt if they do not
offer you one. This receipt
should come from the officer
who took your property, not
someone else.
At this preliminary hearing or
arraignment the judge should
set a reasonable bail. You should
have a lawyer for this hearing.
He may object if the bail is set
too high.
As soon as you are arrested,
you are permitted to make a
reasonable number of phone
calls (not Just one!) — AT
ONCE.
If a policeman stopped you on
the street and began asking you
questions, would you know ex
actly when you're entitled to
shut up? If not, read on.
