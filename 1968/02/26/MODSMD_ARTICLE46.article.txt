Contemporary electronic mu
sic and one of Bach's earliest
choral works will be presented
on the same program in a Stan
ford Music Department concert
at 8:00 p.m., tomorrow, Febru
ary 27, in Dinkelspiel Auditori
um.
The concert is another in the
series of "Music Then and
Now" presentations which were
started last Fall and feature the
work of Prof. George Houle's
classes in early music and Prof.
John Chowning's in contempo
rary music.
Tickets are available at the
Tresidder Box Office.
Contemporary music will be
represented by Stockhausen's
"Telemusik" (1966), Cage's "At
las Eclipticalis" (1961), and a
1966 work by Stanford graduate
student James Lowe, titled "Sea
scapes".
Students in the early music
performance practice classes
will present J. S. Bach's "Can
tata No. 131" (1707).

"Telemusik", described as a
travelogue on tape, is an ex
ample of Stockhausen's "world
music". Created while the com
poser. was working in Japan, it
uses as primary material tapes
ethnic music from various
countries which he transformed
by means of electronic tech
niques and mixed with electron
ically generated sounds.
The Cage work illustrates
"chance" composition techniques
and involved throwing Chinese
fortune-telling sticks in addition
to placing transparent templates
on the pages of an astronomical
atlas and inscribing the posi
tions of stars.
"Sea-scapes", a chamber piece
in the post-Webern tradition,
will be directed by Prof. Leland
Smith and performed by an en
semble consisting of flute, pic
colo, clarinet, celeste and harp.
The Bach Cantata will be per
formed by an eight-member en
semble of singers under the di

rection of graduate student Ar
thur Lawrence. Featured soloists
will be William Graham, bass,
and Nile Norton, tenor.
