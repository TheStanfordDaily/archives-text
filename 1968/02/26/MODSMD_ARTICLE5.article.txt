# Statues Repainted By Dinah's Shack
## 
### 
Segregation and prejudice are
being conquered in Palo Alto.
The iron Negro statuettes in Di
nah's Shack restaurant and
parking lot are now Caucasians.
Dinah's Shack was named for
a Negro woman who was the
first chef at the restaurant. She
died about 15 years ago, accord
ing to John Rickey, owner, of
the 42-year-old restaurant here
in Palo Alto.
The statuettes and main res
taurant sign came under fire
earlier this month when a group
of professional journalists at a
Stanford University fellowship

program said in an open letter
to Rickey that they would boy
cott his restaurant as long as
the slavery-era decor remained.
The protest renewed an objec
tion raised two years ago by the
Palo Alto-Stanford Chapter of
the NAACP. At that time, Rick
ey offered to paint the statuettes
white, yet pressure was reduced
in favor of more immediate
problems.
LOCAL NAACP officials still
feel that the general decor, of
Dinah's is a misrepresentation
of the harsh realities of the slave
period.
