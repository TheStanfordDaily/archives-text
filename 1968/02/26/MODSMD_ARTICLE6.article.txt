# Seeks Active Church
## Prelate Talks Here 
### KIRK HANSON 
Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens
of Belgium told a crowd of over
one thousand in Memorial
Church Friday night that the
main problem for the Church
today is to make passive Chris
tians into active Christians.
Cardinal Suenens, who spoke
earlier on the Sproul Hall
steps in Berkeley, is considered
one of the most progressive
bishops of the Catholic
Church. He was a key planner
and president of the Second
Vatican Council, and has been

frequently mentioned as a
candidate for the papacy.
"The main message of Vatican
II," said the Cardinal, "is the
unity of all Christians. We are
equally baptized and this is the
fundamental reality of Christian
ity."
Suenens stressed the concept
of coresponsibility for the
church, a coresponsibility that
demands cooperation between
the pope and bishops, the bish
ops and priests, between the var
ious denominations, between the
clergy and the laity.

He stressed that the corespon
sibility between the clergy and
the laity "is sort of difficult, for
the priest is not used to working
with the laity on the spiritual
level." He stated parish councils
of priest and laity must be
formed to forge and direct "the
church of tomorrow."
The Cardinal was Intro
duced by Michael Novak, as
sistant professor of Religious
Studies, and hosted by Robert
McAfee Brown and the Reli
gious Studies program. Both
Novak and Brown had met
Suenens when they were pres
ent at the Second Vatican
Council. Suenens was greeted
by standing ovations at the be
ginning and end of his talk,
which was entitled "The Cath
olic Church: Today and To
morrow."
He cited several weaknesses to
the past Second Vatican Coun
cil. He claimed the council came
as a surprise to so many that
the preparation was poor. Sue
nens was the key figure in re
writing most of the early coun
cil drafts. Friday night he said
"The first act of the Holy Spirit
at the Council was to blow up
all those early papers." He crit
icized the timidity of the early
texts.

The second weakness he cited
was the effort by the Council to
secure almost unanimous ap
proval of all documents. "What
was said was not as strong as
the majority wanted," he em
phasized. He stated it is for the
church today to separate the
central thought from the many
amendments that weakened the
documents.
The third handicap was a
monopoly of Latin theology,
and the "all too timid accept
ance of contributions from the
East." He said the Council was
hesitant to "recognize the fact
that the churches of the East,
of Africa, of Latin America
are equally qualified to as
sume their own identity as is
the church of Europe.
Suenens criticized groups
within the church today who
"want to maintain theological
and doctrinal immobility" and
also those who promote radical
change that can only result in
"shattering the church." He
pleaded for a recognition of the
past, present, and future of the
church and Christianity. "We
must develop a liturgy which
is faithful to the past and open
to the present," he said.
Emphasizing the need for. the
church to be relevant to the
world, he said "each generation
must take up the pilgrim stuff
to make and renew the dialogue
with the world."
Asked by Lagunita's nun â€”
R.A. Joan Peters about the role
of women in the church, Sue
nens emphasized the corespon
sibility women have for the
church today.

In any case, "it Is not for
the men to decide what habits
you religious women should
wear," he said. Cardinal Mc-
Intyre, the conservative arch
bishop of Los Angeles, is cur
rently engaged in a struggle
with the Immaculate Heart
Order of Nuns over the habits
the women are to wear. Sue
nens has been a champion of
the rights of women in the
church.
The Cardinal met later Friday
evening with Archbishop Mc-
Gucken of San Francisco. Satur
day he returned to Belgium
where a crisis at the Catholic
University of Louvaine, where
he was formerly rector, has top
pled the government.
