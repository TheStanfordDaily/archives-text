of Belgium told a crowd of over
one thousand in Memorial
Church Friday night that the
main problem for the Church
today is to make passive Chris

Cardinal Suenens, who spoke
earlier on the Sproul Hall
steps in Berkeley, is considered
one of the most progressive
bishops of the Catholic
Church. He was a key planner
and president of the Second
Vatican Council, and has been

frequently mentioned as a
candidate for the papacy.
"The main message of Vatican
II," said the Cardinal, "is the
unity of all Christians. We are
equally baptized and this is the
fundamental reality of Christian
ity."
Suenens stressed the concept
of coresponsibility for the
church, a coresponsibility that
demands cooperation between
the pope and bishops, the bish
ops and priests, between the var
ious denominations, between the
clergy and the laity.

He stressed that the corespon

the laity "is sort of difficult, for
the priest is not used to working
with the laity on the spiritual
level." He stated parish councils
of priest and laity must be
formed to forge and direct "the
church of tomorrow."
