• Draft Calls Up
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Defense Department Friday
boosted draft calls close to the
Vietnam war record. And it or
dered inductions into the Marine
Corps for the first time in two
years.
These actions came as the
Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed
tentatively the call-up of about
50,000 National Guardsmen and
Reservists to rebuild forces in
the United States drained by the
Vietnam war.
Meanwhile , Gen. Earle G.
Wheeler, JCS chairman, under
took an on-the-spot survey of the
situation in Vietnam, which
could lead to a higher U.S. troop
commitment This, in iurr\
oring higher draft calls, a
Guard-Reserve muster or both.
The Pentagon put out a call

for the drafting of 48,000 men in
April, the highest total in the
past 18 months.
At the same time .the Defense
Department raised the previous
ly announced March draft quota
from 39,000 to 41,000, all to serve
in the Army.
The April call is only slightly
below the Vietnam record of
49,200 drafted in October 1966.
The Marines, who never have
liked using draftees, will get
4,000 of them in April—the first
Marine use of the draft since
March 1966.
• Call By NAACP Chief
ORANGEBURG, S. C. (AP) —
Roy Wilkins, executive director
of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored
People NAACP, Sunday called
on South Carolina Gov. Robert
McNair to admit that the fatal
shooting of three Negro students
at Orangeburg by state highway
patrolmen early this month was
"a tragic error."
"I expect that as a man he is
sick as some of us are about
this," Wilkins said, "but let him
say the state was wrong and see
where we can go from there."
Wilkins cautioned his audi
°nce "you do not have to burn
the town down" to achieve its
civil rights goals.
He spoke in White Hall on the

South Carolina State College
campus, about 200 yards from
the spot where state troopers
shot three students to death and
wonded more than 30 the night
of Feb. 8 in an encounter that
climaxed four nights of vio
dence.
His address to the State Col
lege NAACP chapter, counsel
ing continued legal and moral
pressure to achieve civil rights
demands without violence was
applauded by a capacity throng
of about 1,500.
• Black Panther Held
BERKELEY (AP) — A Negro
who led an armed group of
Black Panthers into the capitol
at Sacramento in 1967 was ar
rested here early Sunday and
booked with his wife on a
charge of conspiracy to commit
murder.
Berkeley police identified the
couple as Bobby Seale, 31, of
Berkeley and his 21-year-old
wife Artie.
Authorities withheld details of
the arrest except to say that it
occurred at the Seales' home
and that two other charges were
lodged against them—possession
of illegal firearms and posses
sion of a firearm with the serial
number filed.
Police disclosed that four oth
er Negroes were arrested a

short distance from the Seale
home.
About 40 young men who i
dentified themselves as Black
Panthers burst into the Assem
bly chambers May 2, 1967 They
were herded out and disarmed
by security police.
• Cyprus Voting
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) —
Greek Cypriots voted for a pres
ident Sunday and forecasters
predicted that President Maka
rios would receive more than 90
per cent of the ballots.
Officials estimated that bal
lots were marked by more than
225,000 of the 250,000 electors.
The large turnout was believed
to indicate widespread backing
for Makarios.
Results were expected to be
known early Monday on this
eastern Mediterranean island
over which Greece and Turkey
nearly went to war last Novem
ber.
Makarios told the voters his
re-election would enable him to
pursue a compromise solution of
the long-standing differences be
tween the 500,000 Greek Cy
priots and the 100,000 Turkish
Cypriots.
The Turkish Cypriots played
no part in Sunday's voting .Un
der Cyprus' constitution, the
president is chosen only by
Greek Cypriots while Turkish
Cypriots vote separately for a

vice president. Communal dif
ferences led the withdrawal of
Turkish Cypriot officials from
the government four years ago.
• McCarthy Hits LB J
MANCHESTER, N. H. (AP)
— Sen. Eugene McCarthy, said
Sunday that President Johnson
has "projected year after year
of continuing violence," and
said the government has taken
"almost no significant action to
remedy the basic conditions
which lead to riots" in the na
tion's cities.
The Minnesota Democrat, cam
paigning to upset Johnson for
the party's presidential nomina
tion, said the nation is on "a
course of inaction in the face of
danger."
"If we continue on this
present course," he said, "we
may well witness a bloody ful
fillment of the President's grim
prospect — a prospect of mount
ing lawlessness, troops and
tanks in our streets, and in
creasing fear and desperation
among many of our people."
McCarthy said there is a
need for a "full-scale and deter
mined effort to win the war at
home — a war which today we
aren't even fighting."
• Fulbright Unsure
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen.
J. VV. Fulbright, D-Ark., says
even if the administration ver
sion of what happened in the
Tonkin Gulf 3*6 years ago is ac
cepted ,the first U.S. air strikes
against North Vietnam still
were unjustified.
Fulbright said Sunday it real-
ly doesn't matter whether a con
troversial second attack did
take place against the U.S. de
stroyers Maddox and C. Turner
Joy.
The senator said he remains
unsatisfied that the Aug. 4 at
tack actually took place and
was not the result of confusion
and illusion in the murky night
at sea. At any rate, he said, the
United States struck back too
hastily, without full evaluation
of the facts.
He argued that even if there
was an attack there was no
damage done and the heavy air
strikes therefore were not justi
fied.

• Black Panther Held
BERKELEY (AP) — A Negro
who led an armed group of
Black Panthers into the capitol
at Sacramento in 1967 was ar
rested here early Sunday and
booked with his wife on a
charge of conspiracy to commit
murder.
Berkeley police identified the
couple as Bobby Seale, 31, of

Authorities withheld details of
the arrest except to say that it
occurred at the Seales' home
and that two other charges were
lodged against them—possession
of illegal firearms and posses
sion of a firearm with the serial
number filed.
Police disclosed that four oth
er Negroes were arrested a

short distance from the Seale

About 40 young men who i
dentified themselves as Black
Panthers burst into the Assem

were herded out and disarmed
by security police.
• Cyprus Voting
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) —
Greek Cypriots voted for a pres
ident Sunday and forecasters
predicted that President Maka
rios would receive more than 90
per cent of the ballots.
Officials estimated that bal
lots were marked by more than
225,000 of the 250,000 electors.
The large turnout was believed
to indicate widespread backing
for Makarios.
Results were expected to be
known early Monday on this
eastern Mediterranean island
over which Greece and Turkey
nearly went to war last Novem
ber.
Makarios told the voters his
re-election would enable him to
pursue a compromise solution of
the long-standing differences be
tween the 500,000 Greek Cy
priots and the 100,000 Turkish
Cypriots.
The Turkish Cypriots played
no part in Sunday's voting .Un
der Cyprus' constitution, the
president is chosen only by
Greek Cypriots while Turkish
Cypriots vote separately for a

vice president. Communal dif
ferences led the withdrawal of
Turkish Cypriot officials from
the government four years ago.
• McCarthy Hits LB J
MANCHESTER, N. H. (AP)
— Sen. Eugene McCarthy, said
Sunday that President Johnson
has "projected year after year
of continuing violence," and
said the government has taken
"almost no significant action to
remedy the basic conditions
which lead to riots" in the na
tion's cities.
The Minnesota Democrat, cam
paigning to upset Johnson for
the party's presidential nomina
tion, said the nation is on "a
course of inaction in the face of
danger."
"If we continue on this
present course," he said, "we
may well witness a bloody ful
fillment of the President's grim
prospect — a prospect of mount
ing lawlessness, troops and
tanks in our streets, and in
creasing fear and desperation
among many of our people."
McCarthy said there is a
need for a "full-scale and deter
mined effort to win the war at
home — a war which today we
aren't even fighting."
• Fulbright Unsure
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen.
J. VV. Fulbright, D-Ark., says
even if the administration ver

Tonkin Gulf 3*6 years ago is ac
cepted ,the first U.S. air strikes
against North Vietnam still
were unjustified.
Fulbright said Sunday it real-
ly doesn't matter whether a con
troversial second attack did
take place against the U.S. de
stroyers Maddox and C. Turner
Joy.
The senator said he remains
unsatisfied that the Aug. 4 at
tack actually took place and
was not the result of confusion
and illusion in the murky night
at sea. At any rate, he said, the
United States struck back too
hastily, without full evaluation
of the facts.
He argued that even if there
was an attack there was no
damage done and the heavy air
strikes therefore were not justi
fied.

• Draft Calls Up
WASHINGTON (AP) — The

boosted draft calls close to the

These actions came as the

the United States drained by the
Vietnam war.
Meanwhile , Gen. Earle G.

situation in Vietnam, which
could lead to a higher U.S. troop

The Pentagon put out a call

for the drafting of 48,000 men in
April, the highest total in the
past 18 months.
At the same time .the Defense

• McCarthy Hits LB J
MANCHESTER, N. H. (AP)
— Sen. Eugene McCarthy, said
Sunday that President Johnson
has "projected year after year
of continuing violence," and
said the government has taken
"almost no significant action to
remedy the basic conditions
which lead to riots" in the na
tion's cities.
The Minnesota Democrat, cam
paigning to upset Johnson for
the party's presidential nomina
tion, said the nation is on "a
course of inaction in the face of
danger."
"If we continue on this
present course," he said, "we
may well witness a bloody ful
fillment of the President's grim
prospect — a prospect of mount
ing lawlessness, troops and
tanks in our streets, and in
creasing fear and desperation
among many of our people."
McCarthy said there is a
need for a "full-scale and deter
mined effort to win the war at
home — a war which today we
aren't even fighting."
• Fulbright Unsure
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen.
J. VV. Fulbright, D-Ark., says
even if the administration ver

Tonkin Gulf 3*6 years ago is ac
cepted ,the first U.S. air strikes
against North Vietnam still
were unjustified.
Fulbright said Sunday it real-
ly doesn't matter whether a con
troversial second attack did
take place against the U.S. de
stroyers Maddox and C. Turner
Joy.
The senator said he remains
unsatisfied that the Aug. 4 at
tack actually took place and
was not the result of confusion
and illusion in the murky night
at sea. At any rate, he said, the
United States struck back too
hastily, without full evaluation
of the facts.
He argued that even if there
was an attack there was no
damage done and the heavy air
strikes therefore were not justi
fied.

• Draft Calls Up
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Defense Department Friday
boosted draft calls close to the
Vietnam war record. And it or

years.
These actions came as the
Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed
tentatively the call-up of about
50,000 National Guardsmen and
Reservists to rebuild forces in
the United States drained by the
Vietnam war.
Meanwhile , Gen. Earle G.
Wheeler, JCS chairman, under
took an on-the-spot survey of the
situation in Vietnam, which
could lead to a higher U.S. troop
commitment This, in iurr\
oring higher draft calls, a
Guard-Reserve muster or both.
The Pentagon put out a call

for the drafting of 48,000 men in
April, the highest total in the
past 18 months.
At the same time .the Defense
Department raised the previous
ly announced March draft quota
from 39,000 to 41,000, all to serve
in the Army.
The April call is only slightly
below the Vietnam record of
49,200 drafted in October 1966.
The Marines, who never have
liked using draftees, will get
4,000 of them in April—the first
Marine use of the draft since

• Draft Calls Up
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Defense Department Friday
boosted draft calls close to the
Vietnam war record. And it or
dered inductions into the Marine
Corps for the first time in two
years.
These actions came as the
Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed
tentatively the call-up of about
50,000 National Guardsmen and
Reservists to rebuild forces in
the United States drained by the
Vietnam war.
Meanwhile , Gen. Earle G.
Wheeler, JCS chairman, under
took an on-the-spot survey of the
situation in Vietnam, which
could lead to a higher U.S. troop
commitment This, in iurr\
oring higher draft calls, a
Guard-Reserve muster or both.
The Pentagon put out a call

for the drafting of 48,000 men in
April, the highest total in the
past 18 months.
At the same time .the Defense
Department raised the previous
ly announced March draft quota
from 39,000 to 41,000, all to serve
in the Army.
The April call is only slightly
below the Vietnam record of
49,200 drafted in October 1966.
The Marines, who never have
liked using draftees, will get
4,000 of them in April—the first
Marine use of the draft since
March 1966.

the Advancement of Colored

on South Carolina Gov. Robert
McNair to admit that the fatal
shooting of three Negro students
at Orangeburg by state highway
patrolmen early this month was
"a tragic error."
"I expect that as a man he is
sick as some of us are about
this," Wilkins said, "but let him
say the state was wrong and see
where we can go from there."
Wilkins cautioned his audi
°nce "you do not have to burn
the town down" to achieve its
civil rights goals.
He spoke in White Hall on the

South Carolina State College
campus, about 200 yards from
the spot where state troopers
shot three students to death and
wonded more than 30 the night
of Feb. 8 in an encounter that
climaxed four nights of vio

pressure to achieve civil rights
demands without violence was

of illegal firearms and posses
sion of a firearm with the serial
number filed.

er Negroes were arrested a

short distance from the Seale

• Cyprus Voting
NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) —
Greek Cypriots voted for a pres
ident Sunday and forecasters
predicted that President Maka
rios would receive more than 90
per cent of the ballots.
Officials estimated that bal
lots were marked by more than
225,000 of the 250,000 electors.
The large turnout was believed
to indicate widespread backing
for Makarios.
Results were expected to be
known early Monday on this
eastern Mediterranean island
over which Greece and Turkey
nearly went to war last Novem
ber.
Makarios told the voters his
re-election would enable him to
pursue a compromise solution of
the long-standing differences be
tween the 500,000 Greek Cy
priots and the 100,000 Turkish
Cypriots.
The Turkish Cypriots played
no part in Sunday's voting .Un
der Cyprus' constitution, the
president is chosen only by
Greek Cypriots while Turkish
Cypriots vote separately for a

vice president. Communal dif
ferences led the withdrawal of
Turkish Cypriot officials from
the government four years ago.
• McCarthy Hits LB J
MANCHESTER, N. H. (AP)
— Sen. Eugene McCarthy, said
Sunday that President Johnson
has "projected year after year
of continuing violence," and
said the government has taken
"almost no significant action to
remedy the basic conditions
which lead to riots" in the na
tion's cities.
The Minnesota Democrat, cam
paigning to upset Johnson for
the party's presidential nomina
tion, said the nation is on "a
course of inaction in the face of
danger."
"If we continue on this
present course," he said, "we
may well witness a bloody ful
fillment of the President's grim
prospect — a prospect of mount
ing lawlessness, troops and
tanks in our streets, and in
creasing fear and desperation
among many of our people."
McCarthy said there is a
need for a "full-scale and deter
mined effort to win the war at
home — a war which today we
aren't even fighting."
• Fulbright Unsure
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen.
J. VV. Fulbright, D-Ark., says
even if the administration ver
sion of what happened in the
Tonkin Gulf 3*6 years ago is ac
cepted ,the first U.S. air strikes
against North Vietnam still
were unjustified.
Fulbright said Sunday it real-
ly doesn't matter whether a con
troversial second attack did
take place against the U.S. de
stroyers Maddox and C. Turner
Joy.
The senator said he remains
unsatisfied that the Aug. 4 at
tack actually took place and
was not the result of confusion
and illusion in the murky night
at sea. At any rate, he said, the
United States struck back too
hastily, without full evaluation
of the facts.
He argued that even if there
was an attack there was no
damage done and the heavy air
strikes therefore were not justi
fied.
