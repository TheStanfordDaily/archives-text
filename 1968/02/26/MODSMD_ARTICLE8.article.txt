# Summerskill Coming Here?

### MARK WEINBERGER 
John Summerskill, recently
resigned president of San Fran
cisco State, appears headed for
Stanford later this year to re
search his forthcoming book on
student activism.
Summerskill told The Dally
last night that he "would be
very happy to work at Stanford"
for the next year, particularly
at Stanford's research-oriented
Institute for the Study of Hu
man Problems.
At the same time, Summer
skill denied interest in Stan
ford's presidency, which will be
vacated next September when
Wallace Sterling retires.
"I'm eager to work indepen
dently for the next year," Sum
merskill said. "I'll say 'no
thanks' to the pressures of aca
demic administration for now."
Summerskill resigned the
San Francisco State presiden
cy last Thursday after 18
months in office, charging that
California public education
was being eroded by political
interference and financial star
vation."
Summerskill indicated that no
formal statement of his plans
would be forthcoming until he
receives official funding for his
research by a foundation. "I
haven't had time to work out the
details," he said.
R. Nevitt Sanford, director of
the Institute for the Study for
Human Problems, who has done
extensive work with Summer
skill in clinical psychology over
the past ten years, termed the
proposal that Summerskill study
at the Institute "a wonderful
idea."
Sanford said that although
many people will be attempt
ing to recruit him, he said
that he "wouldn't be too sur
prised" if Summerskill ended
up at Stanford after receiv
ing a research grant.
Sanford speculated that Sum
merskill's work in San Fran
cisco "may dwindle by early

summer," and he might then be
available lor research work. "If
he brings his own funding, we'd
be happy to have him here any
time," he said.
Summerskill and Sanford
worked together as clinical psy
chologists in the East in the
early fifties. The two worked
closely together in 1962 when
Sanford edited "The American
College" and Summerskill wrote
a chapter on college dropouts.
Summerskill said his research
would center on offering "con
structive recommendations
about higher education.
Specifically, he wishes to In
vestigate "how Institutions can
work with the new thrusts and
pressures such as student acti
visc and Black Power and
how administration and aca
demic leadership must change
to work with these chal
lenges."
He feels that his year-and
one-half term as president well
qualifies him to make recom
mendations. "I've had experi
ences few people have had,"
Summerskill said, referring to
the campus violence Dec. 6 and
the subsequent charges brought
against him. He was also vice
president for student affairs at
Cornell.
He was embroiled in a riotous
demonstration Dec. 6, refusing
to summon San Francisco police
onto campus to quell the dis
turbance.
Although several state college
trustees called for his dismissal,
students, faculty, police officials,
and a number of trustees rushed
to his defense. They said his
nonviolent methods had prob
ably prevented bloodshed.
Summerskill will probably go
back into university adminis
tration after he finishes his
book, but he wants "a little less
pressure for the next year." He
plans to settle in this area after
his marriage to Mrs. Mimi
Wright of Menlo Park, owner of
the Travel Desk, a Palo Alto
travel agency. Both are divorced.

plans to settle in this area after
his marriage to Mrs. Mimi
Wright of Menlo Park, owner of
the Travel Desk, a Palo Alto
travel agency. Both are divorced.
John Summerskill, recently
resigned president of San Fran
cisco State, appears headed for
Stanford later this year to re
search his forthcoming book on
student activism.
Summerskill told The Dally
last night that he "would be
very happy to work at Stanford"
for the next year, particularly
at Stanford's research-oriented
Institute for the Study of Hu
man Problems.
At the same time, Summer
skill denied interest in Stan
ford's presidency, which will be
vacated next September when
Wallace Sterling retires.
"I'm eager to work indepen
dently for the next year," Sum
merskill said. "I'll say 'no
thanks' to the pressures of aca
demic administration for now."
Summerskill resigned the
San Francisco State presiden
cy last Thursday after 18
months in office, charging that
California public education
was being eroded by political
interference and financial star
vation."
Summerskill indicated that no
formal statement of his plans
would be forthcoming until he
receives official funding for his
research by a foundation. "I
haven't had time to work out the
details," he said.
R. Nevitt Sanford, director of
the Institute for the Study for
Human Problems, who has done
extensive work with Summer
skill in clinical psychology over
the past ten years, termed the
proposal that Summerskill study
at the Institute "a wonderful
idea."
Sanford said that although
many people will be attempt
ing to recruit him, he said
that he "wouldn't be too sur
prised" if Summerskill ended
up at Stanford after receiv
ing a research grant.
Sanford speculated that Sum
merskill's work in San Fran
cisco "may dwindle by early

summer," and he might then be
available lor research work. "If
he brings his own funding, we'd
be happy to have him here any
time," he said.
Summerskill and Sanford
worked together as clinical psy
chologists in the East in the
early fifties. The two worked
closely together in 1962 when
Sanford edited "The American
College" and Summerskill wrote
a chapter on college dropouts.
Summerskill said his research
would center on offering "con
structive recommendations
about higher education.
Specifically, he wishes to In
vestigate "how Institutions can
work with the new thrusts and
pressures such as student acti
visc and Black Power and
how administration and aca
demic leadership must change
to work with these chal
lenges."
He feels that his year-and
one-half term as president well
qualifies him to make recom
mendations. "I've had experi
ences few people have had,"
Summerskill said, referring to
the campus violence Dec. 6 and
the subsequent charges brought
against him. He was also vice
president for student affairs at
Cornell.
He was embroiled in a riotous
demonstration Dec. 6, refusing
to summon San Francisco police
onto campus to quell the dis
turbance.
Although several state college
trustees called for his dismissal,
students, faculty, police officials,
and a number of trustees rushed
to his defense. They said his
nonviolent methods had prob
ably prevented bloodshed.
Summerskill will probably go
back into university adminis
tration after he finishes his
book, but he wants "a little less
pressure for the next year." He
plans to settle in this area after
his marriage to Mrs. Mimi
Wright of Menlo Park, owner of
