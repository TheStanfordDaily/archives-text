bers.
According to Alan Mokler, di
rector of the show, over a third

mainly, a sense of humor and
good timing, and is not depen
dent upon first-rate acting abi
lity."
"Chastity" was written as a
mild satire of melodramas. Its
playwrights, four co-ed mem

weeks writing the script.

and Gary Levinson, who wrote
the music for the 1967 Gaities.

The audience will be seated at
small, round tables in the din
ing room, which will be decor
ated as a showboat. Bar maids
will serve sandwiches and
drinks before and after the

Mokler said the melodrama
provides proof that a hetro
g-enousiy composed residence
can create a production of
this nature, despite the fact
that it is definitely a "side
line activity." He stated that
the main factor necessary for
such an activity was an in
terest in house unity and a
spirit of cooperation between
members.

March Btn and 9th at 8:30 p.m.
