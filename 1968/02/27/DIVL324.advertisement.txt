It's ridiculously easy. Most Daily staffers have no newspaper experience before they join the staff. We
use a writing handbook, on-the-job experience, and special sessions to train new staffers. The only prere
quisite is enthusiasm.
Join the Daily staff starting spring quarter. We publish through March 8 this quarter. Stop by any after
noon if you have questions. Leave your name. A mesting will be held for new staffers March 8 at 5 p.m.
in the Daily office, Storke Publications Building, Lomita Drive.
