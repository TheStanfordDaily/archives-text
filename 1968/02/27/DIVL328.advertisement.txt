I listen. It's called Let's Go—The Student Guide to Europe,
written by 1 Iarvard students. And it's full of the real stuff.
Like how to pour Spanish cider by holdingthe jugover your
shoulder and the behind your back. And the most successful
(fully researched ) ways to hitchhike in Germany. Spain. Everywhere.
And, of course, places to eat and sleep that only a student could love.
