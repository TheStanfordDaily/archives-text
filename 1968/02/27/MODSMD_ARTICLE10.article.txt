# Sponsor Reform For Frosh Dorms
## 
### 
Despite a general increase in integrated-class dorms, it appears
that next year's housing arrangements will include some all-fresh
man dorms. If these living groups are preserved, then the present
sponsor system must go.
Men and women sponsor selection has been merely an intellec
tualized version of the much maligned "ding session," with a group
of past sponsors judging the applicants. Placed in this pretentious
position of determining the type of upperclassman who can best
mold the unformed freshman mind, past selection committees
have resorted to excruciating personal interviews.
This "selective rush" makes new sponsors more and more like
their predecessors, fostering a self-perpetuating homogeneity.
It is important to have a more realistic environment in freshman
dorms. Rather than having one carefully screened sponsor with
formalized duties, up to four upperclassmen should be placed on
each freshman corridor by the draw system. These individuals
would just live with the freshmen, not feeling that they had to
play the impossible role of psychiatrist, draft counselor, match
maker, and academic adviser.
Dissolving the rigid sponsor-freshman distinction would place
less emphasis on the fact that freshmen are freshmen, helping to
integrate first-year students into the university more quickly.
Sponsors' administrative responsibilities—such as interpreting
the Fundamental Standard and designing door and bulletin boards
—could be handled by a group of paid, experienced R.A.'s. Grad
uate tutors could provide the academic stimulus. An expanded
eating associate program could bring additional upperclassmen
into the dorms.
It is easy to extend the notion that upperclassmen are needed
in freshman dorms to the conclusion that freshmen isolation is bad
in the first place. But since a number of students feel that all-fresh
man dorms should be available, we strongly urge revision of the
sponsor system.
