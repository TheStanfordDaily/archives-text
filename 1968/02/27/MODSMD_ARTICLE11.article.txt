# Love-Ins Turn People On
## 
### Max Lerner 
One of the features of the stu
dent colloquium here at the Uni
versity of Texas has been a min
ilab in interpersonal relations
run by Dr. Richard Farson, di
rector of the Western Behavioral
Sciences Institute in California.
He is one of the newer psy
chologists who believes that the
human problems of our time
will not be resolved by technical
experts but by tapping the hu
man potentials of those who pre
sent the problems—the people
themselves. Eight hundred stu
dents and faculty turned out
here to be turned on. I was one
of the 800, my curiosity stirred
by what a mass love-in would be
like.
The idea behind it was that
the important things happening
in us happen far below the sur
face of the cerebral—of "brain
swapping" and idea exchange.
There is a subterranean drama
going on within us throughout
our everyday encounters, and
our task is to bring it to the
surface, to break down the bar
riers that keep us from confront
ing others with honesty and slit
through the mask that hides us
from ourselves.
That is, I take it, the essential
point of the group-therapy ses
sions that have swept California,
with their "total encounter"
techniques, and have been reach
ing into other parts of the na
tion.
Symbolic Preparation
We began by folding our chairs
and putting them away against
the wall and taking off jackets
and ties and shoes. I took this
to be a symbolic stripping away
of one's civic conventional self
and of the little private territory
occupied by the chair.
Each of us then milled around
the big room, clasping a hand
warmly, touching an elbow, a
shoulder, grasping someone by
both arms as we went. We were
breaking down the walls of
everyday reserve between our
selves and the stranger. Farson
asked us to go further: to tweak
a nose, an ear—again, to do the
bizarre in order to make the
stranger less a stranger.
After one or two other en
counters, we moved on to the
crucial phase: we broke up into
groups of five, ideally with no
one knowing anyone else, to get
a compassable face-to-face inter
acting group and to break down
the facade we all offer to
strangers.
Sitting on the floor in little
huddles, each member paired off

successively with every other
member of the group, looking
him (or her) directly in the eyes
and saying—while the rest of
the group listened—what he felt.
It seemed random, impression
istic and even foolish, yet it did
touch something in each of us.
I had suspected that people
would talk about their desire to
relate to the others, but I had
not counted on its being so uni
versal.
When we were asked, in the
next phase, to close our eyes
and imagine ourselves in some
scene at our "interpersonal
best," reporting to the little
group what our first vision had
been, each began to see the oth
ers on the level of the self-image
and the inner drama.
Making- The Bounds
In the last stages we got up
on our feet again, still in groups.
Every group formed in a close
circle, and each member took a
turn at standing in the center of
it. As it happened, our group

had six members—four women
and two men.
Each of us, standing within
the little circle, shut his eyes
and went limp. As he did so he
was passed from one to another
until he completed the circle,
and then he was picked up by
the whole group—stretched out
in their arms—and was rocked
back and forth while he was
lowered prone to the ground.
I suppose it was a case of hav
ing to trust yourself wholly to
a little band of strangers and in
turn of holding the stranger in
your arms. When you arose, it
was a little like a Lazarus re
turned from the dead state of
your everyday conventional self.
At the end each group spread
out a little, the members gazed
at each other, and each took a
farewell of each, saying and do
ing whatever came to mind.
There were some handshakes
and formal partings, but in most
cases people who had never met
before kissed, embraced, spoke

lingering words, promised or
even arranged to meet again.
I report it too skimpily, but
the outlines are there. It must
have touched some less than oth
ers, but the reason why it
worked at all with most is sim
ple enough.
There is in each of us an im
pulse to cross the barrier that
separates us from others. The
minilab, with everyone follow
ing set instructions together
from the leader, was a way of
legitimizing that impulse.
There are dangers in it, too,
dangers of fears being strength
ened when the emotion is re
leased. There are larger dangers
in the tapping of the destructive
unconscious some day, in the
service of demagogic aims.
But for me it was a good ex
perience, as I thought back to
it and reflected that a culture
which is being subjected to hate
ins, on the streets and on battle
fields, might take the risk of
more love-ins.
