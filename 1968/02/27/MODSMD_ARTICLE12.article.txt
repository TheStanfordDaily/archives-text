# From A Reporter's Notebook
## ROTC Is Part Of Education 
### PAUL DE LIBAN 
Last Tuesday's anti - ROTC
demonstration (which proved to
be anti-Vietnam war as well)
brought to mind a few thoughts
on the issues involved.
The anti-ROTC demonstration
has been defended as an exer
cise of the constitutional free
doms of speech, thought, and
assembly. But it also infringed
those rights for Army Reserve
Officers Training Corps
(AROTC) cadets. They too have
the right to decide the classes
they want — ROTC being one
of these classes — and the right
to attend them without harass
ment.
The demonstrators should
have realized that they were dis
rupting a class duly recognized
by the University. I strongly
doubt if the demonstrators
would appreciate an ROTC in
vasion of their classrooms.
Orderly Conduct
I must admit that the dem
onstrators were reasonably or
derly and caused little more than
inconvenience; if anything, their
antics and skits provided enjoy
able humor for the ROTC bri
gade. It was delightful. Many

cadets enjoyed watching ac
quaintances and friends feign
poking cadets in the ribs with
baseball bats.
But it is inconvenient to have
antagonistic elements stare you
in the face and ridicule the Viet
nam war when you are trying to
exercise your own freedom of
assembly in (or should I say
"on" in this case) your class
room.
Since this demonstration was
proclaimed as anti-ROTC rather
than anti-war, even the skits
were inappropriate. Serving in
the ROTC does not necessarily
mean the cadet supports the
Vietnam conflict, as results of a
survey published in The Daily
revealed.
That poll was sponsored by
the Herbert D. Walter Company
of the Association of the United
States Army (AUSA), and was
distributed to AROTC cadets.
The Herbert D. Walter Com
pany is the local chapter of the
national AUSA.
No Conflict Involved
I can not see how military
training in the sense of ROTC
"conflicts with the goal of edu
cating thinking citizens and
furthering intellectual develop

ment and cr.iticism," as a let
ter in Wednesday's Daily sug
gested.
ROTC exposes the student to
a military point of view, which
sometimes differs from that
which bombards him daily from
other places. He can listen to
peace-preachers, war-mongers,
and others. He is pressured by
academic considerations.
All these influences help the
student to determine his stand
on an issue. The more sources
of ideas to which h° is exposed,
the better-equipped he is to
make a sound, well-reasoned
judgment on a particular issue.
The campus is the place that
exposes the student to these
ideas.
A man must think carefully
before joining ROTC. It com
mits him to six years (in the
Army) plus the time spent train
ing on campus before he earns
his commission. Those years
mean a lot of hard work for the
individual who decides on this
course, because he will have
great responsibilities as an of
ficer.
A man must constantly think
and evaluate alternatives to at
tain such a position.
