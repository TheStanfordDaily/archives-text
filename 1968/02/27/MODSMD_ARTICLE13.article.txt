## Rocky: Let George Do It 
### Art Hoppe 
Good morning, ladies and oth
er shut-ins. It's time for another
chapter of "The Rocky Road to
Happiness" — the dramatic
s >rial that asks the question:
"Can a handsome billionaire of
59 find love? And still get elect
ed President?"
As we join Rocky Nelson to
day, he's spending another quiet,
peaceful evening at home with
his adoring young wife, Hyster
ical, six aides, and three comput
ers. As usual, Hysterical is wear
ing a baggy sweater, faded
jeans, no lipstick and straight
hair.
Rocky (contentedly): Ah,
there's nothing like curling up
on a winter's night with your
loved ones and watching the
computer. I wouldn't be in the
White House for a million dol
lars.
Aide: That's the ticket, Chief.
You just went up another point.
But when you use that phrase,
I think you ought to say a tril
lion dollars.
Rocky: Thanks a thou, fella.
I appreciate your support in my
hard-fought campaign to avoid
being elected President. But
sometimes I wish I were a can
didate so that I might out
on the issues of the day, like
Vietnam, and say . . .
Aide (aghast): Careful, Chief!
Just be mentioning the subject
you dropped a point and a half.
Rocky (hastily): But as a
loyal supporter of my dear,
friend, George, I must perforce
remain silent. All I can do is
privately encourage dear George
to take a fearless public stand
on the burning controversies of
the day. Let the chips fall where
they may.
Aide: Good, good. George just
plummeted another, 13 points.
Hysterical (happily): Oh, I'm
so glad, dearest, that you're not
running for President. Maybe
now I can get my hair fixed ...
Rocky (frowning): Well, fel
la, if you want to attract atten
tion to yourself . . .
Hysterical (excitedly): . . .
and a nice dress. Maybe even
two new dresses. Oh, how won
derful it would be to wear a
pretty dress again after all these
years!
Rocky (scowling): . . . and
thereby remind 30 million mid

die-aged women, who by now
have almost forgivpn me, that
I married a young, attractive
second wife . . .
Hysterical: But, dearest, what
do you care what they think?
If you're not running for Presi
dent . . .
Rocky (nobly): I've said it
before and I'll say it again, fella.
I wouldn't be President for a
mill . . . For a trillion dollars.
Aide: That's better, Chief.
Hysterical (clapping her
hands): Oh, good, dearest. Then

I'll get a lipstick and some eye
liner, too, and some . . .
Rocky (angrily): Now wait a
minute, fella. As a private citi
zen, I don't wish to express an
opinion, but . . .
Aide (nervously): Careful,
Chief.
Rocky: You stay out of this,
fella, (to Hysterical) . . . but if
you start looking young and at
tractive, I'll have to divorce you
and marry an older woman.
Hysterical (sobbing as she
stomps from the room): Oh, you

don't love me any more, you
beast!
Aide (gloomily): See, Chief?
You stated an opinion and you
lost another voter.
Rocky (clapping his hand to
his brow): You're right, fella.
I should've let George tell her.
Oh, I fear I shall never become
a courageous leader shaping th<»
destiny of the great democracy
of ours.
Aide (moaning): You won't,
Chief .unless you learn to keep
your opinions to yourself.
