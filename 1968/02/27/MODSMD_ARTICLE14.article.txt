# The 						Capitol Scenes
## The 						Rearmament Conference 
### Art Buchwald 
Last week Israel and Jordan
had a shoot-out. After it was
over, Israeli political circles
were quoted as saying they
feared that the decision of the
United States to supply Jordan
with arms would upset the
armament balance in the Middle
East.
At the same time, Israel would
not make any protest since it
preferred the Jordanians getting
arms from Washington instead
of from the Soviet Union, which
is hostile to Israel.
It may be just grabbing at a
straw, but perhaps the solution
for peace may be that instead
of nations holding "disarma
ment" conferences, they could
meet to discuss "rearmament."
If they could agree on how
much they were going to rearm,
some of the suspicion about dis
armament could disappear.
Let us suppose that Jordan
and Israel met in Geneva to dis
cuss the problem.
Classified Information
"We're getting 50 F-IOOs from
tho United States," the Jordan
ians say.
"That's perfectly all right
with us," the Israelis reply.
"We're getting 50 American F
-ss. They're much faster and
can also carry rockets."
"Is that so? Maybe we should
get F-5s as well."
"Well, we don't want to tell
you how to run your defense,
but you're crazy to take the

F-IOOs if you can get the F-55,"
the Israelis say.
"That's good of you to warn
us. By the way, our intelligence
reports indicate that those new
American tanks you bought
won't stand up against the anti
tank guns the Americans gave
us."
"No kidding? Where are the
weaknesses?" the Israelis ask.
"In the turret. Maybe you
could add some armor in the
turret to compensate for the
deficiency."
"I think we could. Oh, by the
way, we read in the newspapers
that the Jordanians are buying
some 105 mm artillery guns.
They're pretty expensive, you
know."
Some Suggestions
"You don't think we should
buy them?"
"Well, we looked over your
military budget, and you would
be much better off investing
your money in mortars. There
is a new AK mortar we pur
chased and we're quite satisfied
with it."
"Of course, why didn't we
think of mortars?" the Jordan
ians say. "Do you have any dope
on antiaircraft missiles?"
"Be careful about which mis
sile you select. The Americans
have sold us an antimissile-mis
sile system that's pretty good,
and you'll just be throwing your
dough away on an antiaircraft
missile."
'That's really a valuable
piece of information. Why are
you being so helpful?"
"Well, we'd rather you get
your stuff from the United
States. If you're dissatisfied
with what you get from the
Americans, you might turn to
the Soviet Union for help."
Cost Considerations
"By the way," the Jordanians
say, "one of our biggest items is
the cost of shipping the hard
ware to Jordan. Sometimes

when Israel doesn't have a full
shipload, perhaps we could put
some of it on your ships. After
all, it's going to practically the
same place."
"That makes sense. If we
could pool our shipping ex
penses, we'd have more money
to spend on the M-16 rifle."
"Hold off on the M-16 rifle.
There are still bugs in it,"the
Israelis say. "In spite of what
they say, it still jams."
"I don't know if this makes
sense or not," the Jordanian
says, "but if your minister of
defense and our minister of de
fense could fly over to Washing
ton together, then they could
lay out their needs and there
would be co-ordination on what
we bought."
"I'll bring it up with General
Dayan. It could save us a lot of
trouble. The beauty of the ar
rangement is if one or the other
of us runs out of spare parts for
the American equipment, we
could borrow it from the other."
