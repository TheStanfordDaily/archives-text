## Lyman Maintains Congress Enacted Confused Draft Law 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
May I correct two misleading
statements in Wednesday's
Daily concerning my criticisms
of the Selective Service policies
recently confirmed in General
Hershey's telegram to all draft
boards?
By your reference to "the
Johnson Administration's with
drawal of graduate draft defer
ments" and your statement con
cerning random selection, "This
plan was rejected by the Admin
istration," you transfer to the
White House a responsibility
that belongs at the other end
of Pennsylvania Avenue, with
the Congress of the United
States.
The Administration explicitly
sought a solution by random
selection last year, and the Con
gress turned it down. All that
General Hershey's telegram to
draft boards did in respect to
graduate students was to assert
that no changes would be insti
tuted in the categories of draft
exempt students or the order of
call-up.
The overriding fact today is
that only through Congressional
action is there any real hope
whatever of a reform of the
Selective Service system. The
Congress, rightly distressed at
one unfair and discriminatory
draft law, failed to enact a rem
edy, and instead substituted an
other equally unfair and dis
criminatory one.
If we must have a Selective
Service system (and that is of
course a matter for debate, as is
the foreign policy that induces
such massive manpower re
quirements), at least we should
seek one that is reasonably fair
and efficient. The only body with
the power to produce such a law
is the Congress. Please do not
let careless reporting obscure
that crucial fact.
RICHARD W. LYMAN
Vice President and
Provost
Editor's reply: I disagree with
the Provost's contention that
the statements in Wednesday's
DAILY were "misleading" or
that the reporting was "care
less."
The brief article quoted Mr.
Lyman as saying on CBS News
that "all we're asking for is a
fair shake —a random selection
among the men aged 19 to 26."
The article then said this plan
was rejected by the Administra
tion.
It was. Graduate school asso
ciations, university presidents,
and advisory committees all
urged President Johnson to acti
vate the "prime age group" sec
tion of the 1967 Selective Ser
vice Act. Johnson could have
done this by executive order.
Such an order would put all
l-A's age 19 to 26 in the same
pool, including college graduates
who had lost their 2-S defer
ments. Out of this artificial "age
group," the "oldest" would be
called first —that is, men born
in January would be called be
fore those in February. But the
selection between 19-year-olds
anxl others would be "random."
Since Johnson was strongly
urged to put this plan into ef
fect, and did not, I felt it was
fair to say that "random selec

tion among the men aged 19 to
26" was indeed "rejected by the
Administration."
"Random selection" has been
used to refer to a lottery among
draft-eligible men. This was re
jected by Congress last year.
But Congress did leave Johnson
several ways to ease the impact
of the draft on graduate stu
dents. Johnson used none of
them.
Naturally there can be no dis
agreement with the assertion
that Congress alone can com
pletely revise the draft law, and
that the universities' only re
course now is to lobby for such
a revision.
MICHAEL SWEENEY
Another Arabian Case
Points Out Debt To US
Editor, The Daily:
As a refugee and one of those
who have suffered the discrimi
nating experience of the so
called "Progressive regimes" in
Egypt and Syria, I would like
to reply to the Propaganda
words of the so called Arab stu
dent L. Malik to The Stanford
Daily on Feb. 13.
Malik, like all his brainwash
ed fellow citizens speaks ac
cording to "His Master's voice".
Imperialist is the slogan to be
applied to Nasser and his au
thoritative dictatorship.
Since when have the people
of the U.S. been so called imper
ialist? Is it because they have
interfered in Europe and gave
the sacrifice of their sons to free
the world from the domineering
and authocrative and dictator
ship of the Nazi and Hitler's
madness?
Is it because most of the free
world actually owes to the U.S.
its freedom and liberty? Even
the Soviet Union owes some
thing to the U.S.
Nasser himself owes to them
his remaining in power after the
1956 so called aggression by
Eden and Guy Mollet. The U.S.
is the real democratic country
in the whole world.
Even the Soviet Union has not
such democracy. Where can you
strike, demonstrate, write and
express freely your own opin
ion except here in the U.S.?
Does in the opinion of Malik pro
gressivity mean the destruction
and annihilation of a people (the
Jewish people) because of his
creed and faith?
This people have suffered, and
4 millions of its members have
been the holocaust of Hitler's
madness.
The have the right — as a
Nation duly admitted as a mem
ber of the U.N. — to live in
peace among their fellow na
tions.
Tunisia's president, Mr. Bour
guiba, was wise when he rec
ommended the reconciliation
with Israel and a cooperative
and understanding treaty with
it. Why put hatred in the hearts
of the Arabs, when Arabs
(Egyptians, Syrians, Lebanese,
Irakis, and Jordanians) have al
ways — since long time ago —
lived peacefully with their fel
low Jews?
In spite of the shameful de
feat of Nasser's puppet army
in June 1967, Israel has stretch
ed out its hands to the defeated

Arab nations and shown them
no resentment, but full magna
nimity . . . Why not hold this
hand and work together for a
true and sure progress of the
M.E.?
Why those arms, why this
starvation, why this hatred?
If Malik speaks about self
defense, what does it mean for
him? Israel is not seeking any
domination upon its neighbor's
lands. Is not Nasser and the so
called progressive regime in Sy
ria, who have closed the inter
national waterway of the Suez
canal to the Israeli's freighters,
and even to others bringing
goods to Israel?
Is not Nasser the one who
closed the Tiran straits to the
Israelis ships? Is it not him who
ousted the UNEF from Gaza to
line up his army on the borders
and threatening a small nation
who wants to live in peace? Are
not all these acts of war?
Is it not that which was a
provocation?
I fear that in the next round,
Israel will not stop on the bank
of the Suez canal, but will fol
low its way up to the heart of
the hatred and will dislodge the
dictator and deliver the Egyp
tian people and with him the
whole world, and the other Arab
nations from Nasser's night
mare.
The French used to say: Every
one has two countries; his own
and France. Today we say: each
man has two countries; his own
and the U.S.A.
AN ARAB REFUGEE
Sneed's Status Verified
By Current Litigant
Editor, The Dally:
I would like to apologize for
the factual error in my letter
of last Friday.
Because I have been under
constant prosecution by the
Stanford Administration since
1966, I forgot that Mr. Sneed,
who was chairman of the In
terim Judicial Body during the
Sapir Case, no longer holds that
position.
I know that Mr. Howard Wil
liams is the current chairman,
yet when I saw The Daily's ar
ticle in which Mr. Sneed likened
the New Left to facists I recol
lected only my legal dealings
with Mr. Sneed, and apparently
overlooked the current CIA dem
onstration case (which is but a
replay of the same old record).
Of course, I did not accuse
Mr. Sneed of anything. I merely
quoted from The Daily. The kind
of speech that he made is a self
condemnation.

Planning Office Action
Receives Mild Protest
Editor, The Daily:
Just thought I'd offer my con
gratulations to the Planning Of
fice.
The Lomita Mall project has
succeeded in increasing the area
of blacktop, brick, and concrete
(white and yellow) on this cam
pus by (what the planners must
consider) an admirable amount.
What will be their next great
success?
