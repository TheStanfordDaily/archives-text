# Two Minutes of Haight
## Why We Can't Fight Progress 
### Tim Haight 
Who ever thought that the
most relevant television com
mentary on our time would
come not from PBL, or from
Eric Sevareid ,or even from Star
Trek, but from an inanely-plot
ted, laugh-track-drenched, half
hour goody called The Second
Hundred Years?
No, I am not suffering from
excessive TV radiation. Dig It.
The show has three main char
acters: a 67-year-old man, hLs
33-year-old son and his 33-year
old father. That's right, his 33-
year-old father!
(The family name is Carpen
ter, by the way, but let's admit
the possible Christ symbolism
and continue.) The way the old
boy stayed young was by fall
ing into a Klondike glacier
around 1900. The Air Force dug
him up, alive, and shipped him
to his next of kin.
Central Casting
The three men live together
now and are the core of the
show. Their TV characters —
shallow as could be expected
are as follows: young grandpa
is a real hero. He's tough, but
tender. He has a ready, warm,
wit, a homespun honesty, and
the capacity for, hard work.
He can stun the ladies, but
he's a mans' man. He is the
pioneer — deep-voiced, clean

limbed, straight-headed. In spite
of the fact that he has the im
age Reagan wishes he could pull
off, I dig him third only to Mr.
Spok of Star Trek and leather
leotarded Avenger Emma Peel.
The father, the middle-man of
the trio, is a kind, neutral arbi
ter. He is fatherly to both ends
of his lineage, humble to all.
He is neither of his father's age,
nor his son's. And in the con
flict of those Ages lies the meat
of the show.
Ivy League Characters
The son works as a minor
executive in a bank. He is the
Dostoevskian Potty Counselor
gone Ivy League. He lives at
home, still. He is not gay (perish
the thought on prime-time) but
he is the timid, over-socialized
type with the ladies.
When Grandpa rustles up flap
jacks and grins Will Rodgers
humor over the breakfast table,
Son mixes instant slender in the
blender and worries through the
morning paper.
To emphasize the nature of
the Grandpa-Grandson contrast,
both characters are played by
the same actor. The differences:
Grandpa wears homespun (a
buttoned - up Dave Harris?),
grandson a three-piece suit.
Grandpa's voice is unusually
deep, grandson's unusually

high. Grandpa has free blond
hair (though not hip) and bushy
eyebrows, grandson is a smooth
man, with the help of Groom
and Clean.
The same actor plays both
parts — the difference is our
Age. We are buttoned-down,
slieked-down, slimmed-down. The
only thing up is our voice.
Luckless Grandpa
But superhero Grandpa doesn't
do so well here. Week after week
he runs his level head head-on
into modern American life and
ends up seeing stars. One week
he discovers oil running all over
a farm he tries to run and sells
fast, since oil, worthless in his
time, would ruin the crops.
Another week, he charms a
young lovely by taking her for
an anachronistic buggy ride,
then scientifically jilts her be
cause of his realization that they
are from two separate worlds.
Further, he is hemmed in by
bureaucracy. While on the farm,
the government stops by to
tell him that he can't plant to
matoes in the ground he's hand
plowed, because of surplus reg
ulations. He is confounded by
technology. While drilling by
hand for, water (something we
couldn't do, even after The
Bomb dropped) he ruptures a
pipeline.
Psychology does him in, too.
He takes aptitude tests to find
a 20th Century job. and shocks
the tester by qualifying only
for "buffalo scout" and "stage
coach driver."
Conservative Answer
I don't know how the show is
doing in the ratings, or how it
holds up week after week, but
it is a lesson for our time. We
all feel trapped, less human,
less complete. We are all awed
by our Brobdingnagian Govern
ment, our globe-smothering cor
porations, and the profane en
croachment of steel and cement
into our Eden. This is enough
to make a man a Conservative,
if not a downright reactionary.
But the show has another
slant. If farmers could produce
whatever they wanted without
government help, pr.ices would
be even worse than they are
now. And are we ready to give
up our pipelines and go back
to outhouses?
The complexity and size of
government and technology are
lodged in our present lifestyle,
as the contrast between Gover
nor Reagans image and his ac
tions shows.
And if we think problems are

convoluted here, look at the
cross-cultural nightmare we're
up to our eyes in in Vietnam!
While our society has been grow
ing, the world has shrunk. While
we might like to be frontiers
men, there are now people liv
ing on the other side of what
ever terrestrial border we might
draw.
And those people have their
own drives for love, pride, land,
and the right to live without
our interference. To use them
as pawns for our psychodrama
is unthinkable.
Another frontier easily com
ing to mind is space. But it's an
elitist dream, peopled by clean
cut military men chosen for
exceptional physical and mental
qualities, not for the brute
longing to be alive and on your,
way.
Even if we can squeeze out of
their TV images a vicarious
thrill, every moment and every
dollar we spend on this dream
is misery to the man of the
ghetto — whose frontier is the
edge of his neighborhood. Some
kids in Watts have never seen
the sea, some ten miles distant.
The buffalo scout and the
stagecoach driver are gone for
ever, the Marlboro commercials
notwithstanding. And a Mustang
is only a car. We grit our teeth,
stifle our frontier urges into a
moment before the Tube, and
live as technological, liberal, ra
tional modern man. But we don't
like it. Like the American Eagle
beaned by planes and choked by
smog in the Alka-Seltzer com
mercials, we have the "blahs".
We cannot go back. Techno
logy is here to stay, and, ironic
ally, its greatest defenders,
knowing its value to business
and the military, are conserva
tive.
We must go forward. We must
articulate a dream — of human
wholeness and pride and fun
and sense of accomplishment
and then bust our beautiful
Stanford brains to make tech
nology take us there, instead of
just taking us.
