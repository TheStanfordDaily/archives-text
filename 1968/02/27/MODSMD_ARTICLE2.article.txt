# Dean Wants 'Discussion'
## Housing Debate Continues 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
If you can't figure out what
changes are planned for student
housing next year, don't wonry.
The plans don't exist.
Despite the deluge of housing
surveys, reports, and recommen
dations, Dean of Students Joel
Smith says his office hasn't set
tled on a plan. "We are discus
sing what the program should
be," Smith said in a statement
yesterday."I hope that Stanford
students will participate In the
discussion."
Smith and his associates have
been successful in their avowed
purpose — getting student par
ticipation in drawing up a 1968-
69 housing proposal.
The response has been so in
tense since last Tuesday's meet
ing, in fact, that Assistant Dean
Sally Mahoney expects it will
take at least another week to
hash over all the problems rais
ed by students.
At a meeting for house pres
idents tonight at 7 p.m. in Tre
sidder Room 275, Miss Mahoney
and other deans will discuss
some of the objections to the
three different residence-reor
ganizing proposals distributed
a week ago. Assistant Dean
Davis will talk about an all-cam
pus draw to assign students to
the new residences. There will
be another meeting March 5.
Any of the proposals would
dramatically push forward the
housing reform that began last
year with coed "demonstration"
houses. Coeducational living
space would be doubled and
more freshmen would be "in
tegrated" with upperclassmen.
Practically every residence
area — Stern, Wilbur, Laguni
ta, and Row houses, Roble, Bran
ner and Toyon — would become
all or partly coeducation.
The deans have repeatedly
emphasized that they aren't
presenting any final program
at the meetings for house
presidents. Smith points out
that he can't make a final de

clsion on housing — President
Wallace Sterling and the
Board of Trustees must ap
prove any changes.
All the excitement and con
troversy stems from how Smith
is preparing a proposal to sub
mit to Sterling. All the lobbying
and negotiation surrounding
such a massive change is being
done in public.
Smith admits that no housing
plan could satisfy everyone, but
he thinks that this communal
decisionmaking will mute the
inevitable criticism of the final
proposal.
Wider participation will also
help avoid defects in the hous

ing arrangements, Smith be
lieves; and he feels only a strong
proposal should be submitted
to the Board of Trustees.
These are some of the con
troversial issues which have
emerged in discussions since
Tuesday's meeting:
• Will Laugnita be coeduca
tional? The most elegant cam
pus dormitory is now for wom
en only. One of Tuesday's pro
posals for discussion put 105
men in three Lagunita houses;
another envisioned 59 men in
two coed houses.
However Lagunita represen
tatives told Miss Mahoney last
week that some women would

prefer keeping Lagunita all-fe
male. At the same time, advo
cates of coeducation have insis
ted that most men and women
want Lagunita coed.
• How much "integration" for
freshmen? The Study of Edu
cation (SES) Residence commit
tee and the ASSU Housing Com
mission have strongly recom
mended that freshmen be inte
grated into dormitories with up
perclassmen, instead of being
isolated in their own residences.
The dean's three discussion
proposals differ, greatly in th?
ways they mix freshmen and
upperclassmen.
• Will a women's Bow house
be converted for upperclass men
or for freshmen? Hurlburt and
Lathrop were suggested for
these purposes at Tuesday's
meeting.
There are dozens of smaller
questions involving the specific
housing arrangements. Any de
cision about one dormitory af
fects all the other dormitories,
according to Bill Leland, chair
man of the fact-finding commit
tee which made a survey of
housing preferences last month.
Even when the deans settle on
one housing arrangement, deci
