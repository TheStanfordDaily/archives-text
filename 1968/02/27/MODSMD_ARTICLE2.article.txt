# Dean Wants 'Discussion'
## Housing Debate Continues 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
If you can't figure out what
changes are planned for student
housing next year, don't wonry.
The plans don't exist.
Despite the deluge of housing
surveys, reports, and recommen
dations, Dean of Students Joel
Smith says his office hasn't set
tled on a plan. "We are discus
sing what the program should
be," Smith said in a statement
yesterday."I hope that Stanford
students will participate In the
discussion."
Smith and his associates have
been successful in their avowed
purpose — getting student par
ticipation in drawing up a 1968-
69 housing proposal.
The response has been so in
tense since last Tuesday's meet
ing, in fact, that Assistant Dean
Sally Mahoney expects it will
take at least another week to
hash over all the problems rais
ed by students.
At a meeting for house pres
idents tonight at 7 p.m. in Tre
sidder Room 275, Miss Mahoney
and other deans will discuss
some of the objections to the
three different residence-reor
ganizing proposals distributed
a week ago. Assistant Dean
Davis will talk about an all-cam
pus draw to assign students to
the new residences. There will
be another meeting March 5.
Any of the proposals would
dramatically push forward the
housing reform that began last
year with coed "demonstration"
houses. Coeducational living
space would be doubled and
more freshmen would be "in
tegrated" with upperclassmen.
Practically every residence
area — Stern, Wilbur, Laguni
ta, and Row houses, Roble, Bran
ner and Toyon — would become
all or partly coeducation.
The deans have repeatedly
emphasized that they aren't
presenting any final program
at the meetings for house
presidents. Smith points out
that he can't make a final de

clsion on housing — President
Wallace Sterling and the
Board of Trustees must ap
prove any changes.
All the excitement and con
troversy stems from how Smith
is preparing a proposal to sub
mit to Sterling. All the lobbying
and negotiation surrounding
such a massive change is being
done in public.
Smith admits that no housing
plan could satisfy everyone, but
he thinks that this communal
decisionmaking will mute the
inevitable criticism of the final
proposal.
Wider participation will also
help avoid defects in the hous

ing arrangements, Smith be
lieves; and he feels only a strong
proposal should be submitted
to the Board of Trustees.
These are some of the con
troversial issues which have
emerged in discussions since
Tuesday's meeting:
• Will Laugnita be coeduca
tional? The most elegant cam
pus dormitory is now for wom
en only. One of Tuesday's pro
posals for discussion put 105
men in three Lagunita houses;
another envisioned 59 men in
two coed houses.
However Lagunita represen
tatives told Miss Mahoney last
week that some women would

prefer keeping Lagunita all-fe
male. At the same time, advo
cates of coeducation have insis
ted that most men and women
want Lagunita coed.
• How much "integration" for
freshmen? The Study of Edu
cation (SES) Residence commit
tee and the ASSU Housing Com
mission have strongly recom
mended that freshmen be inte
grated into dormitories with up
perclassmen, instead of being
isolated in their own residences.
The dean's three discussion
proposals differ, greatly in th?
ways they mix freshmen and
upperclassmen.
• Will a women's Bow house
be converted for upperclass men
or for freshmen? Hurlburt and
Lathrop were suggested for
these purposes at Tuesday's
meeting.
There are dozens of smaller
questions involving the specific
housing arrangements. Any de
cision about one dormitory af
fects all the other dormitories,
according to Bill Leland, chair
man of the fact-finding commit
tee which made a survey of
housing preferences last month.
Even when the deans settle on
one housing arrangement, deci
sions will still have to be made
on a new draw system and aca
demic "themes" and seminars
for various residences.
Assistant Dean Doug Davis
will pose these questions on
the draw system: when Is the
best time to conduct the draw,
and what Is the best procedure
for taking care of those peo
ple displaced by the new con
's figuration?
' Davis says he suspects the
Jdeans will receive questions
priorities within the draw
'system, but he added that plans
<for the new draw assume con
tinuation of the presently con
stituted priorities.
"We can adjust the draw ac
cording to priorities," Davis
?said yesterday, "but we want to
lagree on the mechanics of the
fdraw first." Davis said a three
:page paper outlining ideas for
'new draw procedures would be
given to the house presidents.
I Another problem is the im
pact on fraternities, now busily
recruiting pledges from the
freshman class. The deans are
considering providing 100 more
spaces for men in University
residences. Fraternities could be
hard-pressed by competition
from coed dorms.
Lambda Nu has voted to be
come coeducational, and Smith
says he will give a favorable
recommendation to the proposal.
Beta Chi's plan to go coed Is
still being discussed.
The deans admit they would
like more time to work on all
the Issues — housing arrange
ments, the draw, academics
and consequences for fraterni
ties. But time Is running out
Final arrangements for 1968-
69 must be announced by the
end of April, both to allow fresh
men to decide between fraterni
ties and University housing, and
to give time for an all-campus
draw to assign housing space.
And before anything can be
final, the President and the
Board of Trustees must approve
it. The Trustee's next meeting
is March 21. The deans don't
know if they can achieve a "con
sensus" on housing by that date,
but they say they're going to
try.
