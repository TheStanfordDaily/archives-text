# Hershey Fights Court Decision
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP>— Draft
Director Lewis B. Hershey said
Friday he has no objection to
disclosure of names, ages, and
military background of draft
board members. But he said he
probably will fight a court deci
sion requiring disclosure of their
addresses.
Even on that point, however,
Hershey had said state draft di
rectors are not prohibited from
revealing home addresses if
there is a good reason to do so.
Hershey said the Selective
Service System probably will
ask the Department of Justice
to appeal a recent federal court
decision in Philadelphia requir
ing disclosure of the names, ad
dresses, ages and military back
ground of members of Local
Board 136.
The appeal, he said, will be
"primarily on the question of
addresses."
Some Threats Made
"There are some threats going
around the country," said the
74-year-old lieutenant general,
and he said addresses should be

withheld to protect board mem
bers from harassment as well as
from innocent but bothersome
questions and petitions in the
privacy of their homes.
Hershey himself is listed in
the telephone book and receives
frequent phone calls from the
public at home after working
hours.
"I have always felt that being
pestered at home was an occu
pational hazard," he commented.
"Yesterday Washington's Birth
day was a pretty quiet day —
only 3 or 4 calls. Well, I don't
mind, I'm in a paid position and
I guess it's part of my job.
"Nobody wants to be secretive
about things," he continued, "but
draft board members are private
citizens who serve without pay
and they want to feel that when
they get home they're not going
to be harrassed with phone calls
or maybe threatened."
The draft law provides that
board members may not serve
beyond age 75, may not be mem
bers of the armed forces, and
must reside in the county served
by their board.
