Stanford's dissatisfaction with
student government is echoed
at universities around the na
tion.
A growing number of stu
dents are expressing dissatisfac
tion with their "representative"
governments and their overall
lack of power. Many are disap
pointed with their inability to
effect change in the areas of
academic reform and basic uni
versity restructuring.
At Wayne State University,
Detroit, frustration is becoming
increasingly evident. Two Stu
dent-Faculty Council members
have resigned from the Execu
tive Board and others are con
templating resigning. Many
others do not intend to run for
re-election.
SF-C Chairman Chuck Lar
son shares the disenchant
ment. "Student government
can never be relevant to stu
dents at Wayne as long as
they allow the administration
to develop the guidelines for
its operation," he said.
"The SF-C is constituted by
means of a charter granted by
the President of the University.
He has the power to change it
at his discretion and has done
so in the past."
Larson said he recommends
reorganizing the SF-C "by giv
ing students the opportunity to
decide what mechanism they
want to represent them. This
mechanism would be established
and would not negotiate with
the administration for the right
to exist."
"It destroys a student's self
respect and is degrading," Lar
son said, "to have to go to the
administration and ask them for
the right to have a voice. It is an
inalienable right of all people,
including students, to control
their own destinies."
Mark Shapiro, SF-C represen
tative at the Convention of the
Michigan Association of Student
Governments, said he found
"that the majority of student
governments around the state
were even in a worse plight
than we are. It is apparent that
student governments are un
democratically formed—not on
the basis of one man-one vote."
The University of Michi
gan's Student Government

Council, In an attempt to gain
control over the activities It
undertakes and allow for
greater financial freedom, Is
incorporating under univers
ity regulations.
Its chairman, Bruce Kahn, ex
pressed dissatisfaction with stu
dent government in general,
suggesting student unions in
stead or possibly no organiza
tion at all.
"Apathy is rooted into the na

ture of education at American
universities," Kahn said. "There
will be no change in universities
until the American student be
comes radicalized.
"Often student leaders them
selves are at fault. Many are
interested in personal power
rather than student power."
Ed Schwartz, president of the
National Student Assn., ex
pressed the sentiments of a
growing number of students at
a national conference on stu
dent power:
"The lesson is clear— you can
not keep any group in subserv
ience in a society which pur
ports to be free without that
group applying the standards
and hopes of democracy to its
own condition. The labor move
ment said that in the 30s; the
black people have said it in the
60s; the students will say it in
the late 60s and beyond."
