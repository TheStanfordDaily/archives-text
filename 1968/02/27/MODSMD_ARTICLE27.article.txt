# Mexico City Speech
## Brandt Criticizes Aid 
### 
The "embarrassingly poor"
progress achieved with U.S. for
eign aid and food surplus dona
tions has led to a "genuine shift"
away from these policies, an
internationally prominent Stan
ford economist said yesterday
in Mexico City.
Prof. Karl Brandt, former
member of President Eisen
hower's Council of Economic Ad
visers, said in too many instan
ces "the granted aid has re
tarded development, paved the
way for more inflation, and led
to neglect of development of
the rural economy" abroad.
Former director of the Food
Research Institute at Stanford,
Brandt now is a senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institu
tion.
In remarks prepared for an
international seminar on agri
culture, he predicted a "new
strategy of development" will
emphasize private initiative in
multi-national corporations and
joint enterprises, especially in
"agribusiness."
He warned that overemphasis
on industrial development at the
expense of agriculture can "pull
the rug from under the growth
of the entire national economy."
Profit incentives and free
trade play key roles in maximiz
ing agricultural development, he
emphasized. A government may
actually throw its economic
growth "in reverse gear" by set

ting artificially low prices on
food staples to please consumers
or adding export duties to farm,
forestry, or mining products.
Over 50 years' effort to fix
commodity prices through inter
national cartels "have failed to
achieve their proclaimed goals"
he said. "Even in case of coffee,
developing countries would do
well not to bank so heavily in
their development policies on in
ternational price-fixing arrange
ments."
Genuine progress toward free
international trade "is nowhere
. . . in sight," he said, but "con
siderable progress" has been
achieved in regional treaty ar

rangements which reduce tariffs
and create broader, trans-na
tional markets.
Governments should try to
work with the elite groups, ra
ther than indicting them with
the rest of the oligarchy, he said.
Otherwise "the beating of the
kettle drums for agarian reform
(can) paralyze economic growth.
"The omni-present threat of
agarian reform scares a lot of
capital out of agriculture," he
concluded. "Large sums may
go hiding abroad ... or small
holders may invest their money
in urban slum dwellings." This
adds to inflation and the threat
of eventual anarchy.
