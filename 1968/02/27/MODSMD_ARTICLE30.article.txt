## Pitzer, Harris Lead Solid Golf Team 
### 
Stanford golf hopes, although
somewhat dimmed by the recent
conference ruling barring fresh
men from varsity competition,
are still bright, and Coach Bud
Finger has five good, solid hit
ters who "can beat anybody, in
cluding Houston, on a given
day."
Two crushing victories over
Santa Clara (26 1 6- 1 6) and San
Francisco State (27-0) this past
weekend would seem to justify
Finger's confidence.
Stanford's number one man
at the moment Is Greg Pitzer.
He plays a solid, all-around
game and Is an excellent put
ter and driver, a show-and
dough combination that is
tough to beat. Pitzer fired a
one-under-par 70 against San
ta Clara, no mean feat from
the back tees on the rugged
Stanford course.
Right behind Pitzer is Rich
ard Harris, who finished eighth
In the NCAA championships last
year and was selected as a col
legiate Ail-American. He uses a
very easy, compact swing, but
fast wrist action gets the ball
out a long way.
The third, and fourth, and
fifth spots have not been de
termined yet, but they will most
likely be filled by Sandy Adel
man, Ray Isbell, and Terry
Curran.
Adelman is Junior Champ of
Texas, where good young golf
ers are almost as numerous as
oil wells. He also defeated Curtis

Cupper Shelley Hamlin to win
this year's Stanford Open.
Isbell is a transfer from Brow
ard JC in Pompano Beach, Flor
ida, where he made All-America.
In this year's San Francisco City
Tournament he knocked out the
qualifying medalist. Isbell's
strength is his long, low, whistl
ing iron shots.
Curran played well enough in
last year's National Amateur to
make the final cut, and should
be a solid performer this year.
Fighting for the sixth spot
will be sophs Jeff Blanken
burg, Bruce Doering, George
Bevan, and John Brock. Bob
Riddell is now in Florence,
but he should be able to whip
back into shape spring quar
ter.
A talented freshman team
will have to sit this year of vars
ity competition out due to the
Pacific-Eight ruling. "The con
ference really killed us with that
decision," commented Finger.
Leading the frosh ranks is
Tom Watson, Missouri State
Champ and sixteenth in the Na
tional Amateur. A knowledgable
observer has described Watson
as "a better golfer than Jack
Nicklaus at the same stage of
development."
Other members of the frosh
squad are Jeff Heiser, Steve
Falender, Bob Burns, Rick Ben
son, and Bob Bows.
Finger sees USC and UCLA as
the Pacific Eight teams to beat,
with Washington and Stanford
close behind and able to knock
off the two favorites at any time.
