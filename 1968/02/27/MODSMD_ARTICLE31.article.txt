## The 						Dunk 
### Dave Noland 
Last week in Pullman, the WSU basketball team highlighted
their pregame warmup session with an organized dunking exhi
bition. Those unfortunate Cougars who were either too short or
not springy enough to perform the feat meekly filed over to the
bench, leaving the six dunkers to command the rapt attention of
everyone in the entire fieldhouse.
They lined up at midcourt and one by one charged down the
floor and crammed the ball vehemently through the cords. 6-10
center Jim McKean drove the crowd into ecstasies with his two
hand, triple-pump, backwards style, but the real darling of the
fans was Lennie Allen. (Allen is 5-10. Enough said.) All in all,
the home crowd loved it.
Being a true Stanford fan, I tried hard to wear my isn't-that
a-disgusting-exhibition-and-besides-you-can't-stuff-in-a-game look,
but I doubt if 1 fooled anybody. Deep down inside, I loved it, too.
There's something about a good, defiant, arrogant dunk shot
that nothing else in basketball can match, the NCAA Rules
Committee notwithstanding.
A dunk shot is a real psychological weapon. It says, "To hell
with you, world, ain't nobody stopping me." It jacks up one
team and humiliates the other. A properly executed dunk is
the ultimate.
This year however, the dunk is dead. The reason is appar
ently to reduce the advantage of that evil of evils, The Big Man.
So the Alcindors and the McKeans now simply drop the ball
through the hoop instead of cramming it. Just as easy, but not
nearly as much fun.
They can outlaw the dunk, the can raise the baskets to 12
feet, they can raise the baskets to 20 feet, but nothing will ever
change the fact that a tall guy is taller than a short guy.
I say bring back the dunk.
