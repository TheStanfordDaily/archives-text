# Volleyball-Enthusiasm And Organization Do Wonders
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Chris McLachlin, Bob Conrad
and 25 volleyball players think
they can make that sport popu
lar at Stanford and throughout
the Bay Area.
And with their enthusiasm and
talent, they just might do it.
Sparked by surprising finishes
of last-minute Stanford teams in
the past three years at the an
nual Far West Volleyball Cham
pionships, Conrad and McLach
lin wondered what they could
do with more organization.
So this year the Stanford Vol
leyball Club was formed with
its main feature being regular
practice twice weekly. Already
the results are surprising.
Last weekend at the North
ern California AAU Open
Tournament, Stanford teams
captured both titles in the B
and C divisions and four of
the six-man team which won
the A division were Stanford
ians.
With talent like that, McLach
lin and Conrad want to take a
team to the Nationals in Port
land, Ore., May 8-11. A good
finish there, they hope, would
spark interest in creating
leagues in northern California
to rival those of southern Cali

fornia, the, present American hot
bed of volleyball enthusiasm.
Describing the multiple victo
ries in the AAU, McLachlin said
"This tournament did a lot for
them and now they know they
can win."
"The guys are really enthu
siastic and are intent on work
ing hard toward making the
trip to the nationals."
The C team was comprised of
Jim Ingram, Tony Lettunich,
Don Carpenter, Paul Wesler,
Ned Groth, Eric Peterson, Dick
Zdarko and Bill Yates.

B team competitors were Jim
Julian, John Burch, Jeff Pierose,
Mike Stevens, Roberto LimaNet
to, Rocky Laverty and Steve
Harbison.
The four who played for the
victorious Stockton YMCA in
the A division were McLachlin,
Conrad, Ernie Banks and Marv
Vickers.
From those players McLach
lin and Conrad will construct a
team of ten which will assault
the Far West Championships
this year and, hopefully, the Na
tionals.
