# Lecture Set Thursday
## African Art Shown 
### 
Anthropology Prof. James
Gibbs will speak Thursday at
8 p.m. on African sculpture now
on display in the Stanford Art
Gallery.
The collection, owned by Mr.
and Mrs. Robert H. Nooter of
Washington, D.C., is being ex
hibited at Stanford, now through
March 17.
Included are masks and head
dresses, doors carved in relief,
cult statues, ritual implements,
miniature sculptures, and ob
jects of personal adornment
from a wide variety of tribal
traditions.
Prof. Lorenz Eitner, head of
Stanford's Art Department,
writes: "The sculptures and im
plements being shown express
a coherent body of religious be
liefs, deeply rooted in local tra
dition. The wide range of types
which is evident in the repre
sentation of the human figure
and face is not the product of
aesthetic whim or the sculp
tor's personal choice, but of tri
bal tradition.
"There is a freedom from
naturalism in African sculptures
which gives it an affinity with
modern expressive art," he
concludes.
