# Resistance To March
## 
### 
Resistance worker Mark Sil
verman has called a meeting
Thursday night to organize a
"March for Peace" from Palo
Alto to San Francisco over the
spring vacation.
The recent Stanford graduate
will outline his plans for the
march at 7 p.m. in Tresidder
Room 268.
"Some of the smaller commu
nities between here and San
Francisco haven't had any peace
demonstrations," Silverman ex
plains. "The march will bring
opposition to America's warmak
ing closer to them."
The four or five day "walk"
will give students a chance to
"express feeling against the war
without necessarily turning in
draft cards," Silverman says. He
returned his draft card last year
and was recently reclassified 1-A
by his Richmond draft board.
Marchers will cover five to ten
miles a day, according to Silver
man, and stop in each town for
small rallies or demonstrations,
especially near high schools and
junior colleges.
Silverman hopes he can ar
range accommodations and other
activities with sympathizers in
the communities.
