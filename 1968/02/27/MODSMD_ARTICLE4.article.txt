# Dean Smith's Statement
## 
### 
February 26, 1968
The publicity about the discussion of next year's housing
program has created an Impression, at least among some peo
ple, that the plans for next year are all set.
I want to emphasize that we are discussing what the program
should be, and no particular item, including the Lambda Nu
proposal, has been approved.
I hope that Stanford students will participate in the discussion,
in that the proposal which is ultimately submitted to the Presi
dent and the Board of Trustees should be informed of student
preferences.
JOEL P. SMITH
