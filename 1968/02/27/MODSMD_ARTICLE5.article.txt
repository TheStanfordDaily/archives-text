# A 						South African
## Questions Pan-Africanism 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
A South African senator,
speaking yesterday afternoon
in Tresidder on "Pan-Africanism,
Nationalism, and Liberalism,"
maintained that liberalism does
not equal pan-Africanism. Edgar
S. Brooks, a white liberal and
critic of apartheid, opposes the
pan-Africanist movements now
underway in his home continent.
Liberalism, said Brooks, is
based on a belief in the "infinite
value of the individual." Al
though men may not be equal
in health, beauty, or intelligence,
there should be "equality of ed
ucation, equality of opportunity
of employment, and equality of
opportunity of political advan
tage."
"To a liberal, differences spell
interests, not apprehensions."
No matter what sex, race, or re
ligion a man may be, "he is made
in the image of God."
Like Russia, "the aim of coun
tries like my own is to prpduce
conformity to a type," Brooks
explained. Liberals feel that a
man "should choose his own
career even if he chooses
wrong."
Pan-Africanism differs from
liberalism In Its view of the
Importance of the individual.
It Is a "continental organize
tlon of Africa" based on the
theory that "liberal and dem
ocratic principles must give
way" to the "tempestuous in
fection of nationalism. Indivi
dual rights are sacrificed."
Brooks said he "grew up in
an atmosphere of racial bar

riers" and understands how bit
terly those professing pan-Afri
canism feel toward th 3 "unfair
minority rule." Instead of
white dominance, they want to
establish black rule. liberalism,
in contrast, hopes to abolish the
idea of any race ruling another.
The new African states are
too concerned with "external
government." Brooks finds this

natural since the colonial re
gimes were also symbolized by
splendid homes, fancy cars, and
showy uniforms.
Unless attitudes change,
Brooks warns that "the future
of South Africa will be somber."
He feels that though it is un
democratic, pan-Africanism is
"natural ,honorable, and all but
inevitable."

Liberalism, said Brooks, is
based on a belief in the "infinite
value of the individual." Al
though men may not be equal
in health, beauty, or intelligence,
there should be "equality of ed
ucation, equality of opportunity
of employment, and equality of
opportunity of political advan
tage."
"To a liberal, differences spell
interests, not apprehensions."
No matter what sex, race, or re
ligion a man may be, "he is made
in the image of God."
Like Russia, "the aim of coun
tries like my own is to prpduce
conformity to a type," Brooks
explained. Liberals feel that a
man "should choose his own
career even if he chooses
wrong."
Pan-Africanism differs from
liberalism In Its view of the
Importance of the individual.
It Is a "continental organize
tlon of Africa" based on the
theory that "liberal and dem
ocratic principles must give
way" to the "tempestuous in
fection of nationalism. Indivi
dual rights are sacrificed."
Brooks said he "grew up in
an atmosphere of racial bar

riers" and understands how bit
terly those professing pan-Afri
canism feel toward th 3 "unfair
minority rule." Instead of
white dominance, they want to
establish black rule. liberalism,
in contrast, hopes to abolish the
idea of any race ruling another.
The new African states are
too concerned with "external
government." Brooks finds this

natural since the colonial re
gimes were also symbolized by
splendid homes, fancy cars, and
showy uniforms.
Unless attitudes change,
Brooks warns that "the future
of South Africa will be somber."
He feels that though it is un
democratic, pan-Africanism is
"natural ,honorable, and all but
inevitable."
