SAIGON (AP) — North Viet
namese troops mauled a U.S.
Marine patrol and blocked a
rescue platoon 800 yards out
side the combat base at Khe
Sanh Monday. American officers
said the Communists are moving
in closer by the day to positions
for an all-out offensive in South
Vietnam's northwest corner.
U.S. strategists in Saigon say
as many as 40,000 Communist
troops are in position around
Khe Sanh to jump 5,000 Marines
holding the barren, sandbagged
combat base.
Associated Press correspond
ent John T. Wheeler reported
from Khe Sanh that North Viet
namese troops, working in mon
soon mist and fog, are digging
fortified, zigzag trenches and
tunnels outside the base perime
ter. Air spotters detected one
trench 100 yards from the
Sanh's barbed wire.
Marine commanders guard
ed against the possibility the
Reds were tunneling under
the outer defenses of the base.
They sent out medics with
stethoscopes but the medics
detected no signs of digging.
The ambush of the Marine pa
trol — a platoon — came before
dawn. The number of casualties
suffered was not known but a
Leatherneck survivor said "a
whole bunch were killed in the
very beginning."

Blazing enemy fire held back
the relief platoon, which also
suffered some casualties.
U.S. Special Forces Green
Beret troops spotted three Com
munist armored vehicles 50
miles northwest of Saigon on
Monday night and destroyed one
of them in an ambush less than
two miles from the Cambodian
border, the U.S. Command re
ported. It was the closest to
South Vietnam's capital that
enemy armor has been confirm
ed as sighted.
In the capital, Red gunners
shelled the often-hit Tan Son
Nhut air base before dawn
Tuesday. The Communists
bombarded three other sec
tions in the city and suburbs,
including a camp for families
of government soldiers, with
f&O houses reported destroyed
and a number of civilians
wounded.
Although only 5,000 Marines
defend Khe Sanh, there are
scores of thousands of other
Leathernecks and U.S. Army
and South Vietnamese troops
available for counterattacks
against any Red invasion of the
northern sector. The U.S. Com
mand is depending heavily on
air strikes also.
At daybreak the mist and fog
lifted slightly for the first time
in a week and U.S. jets swept
over the area dropping bombs
and napalm on the enemy troops
attacking the Marines.
Communist artillery contin
ued to pound the base itself.
Several hundred rounds crashed
in during the day. In accord
ance with the new regulations
on military information the
number of Marine casualties
and the extent of damage was
not disclosed.
The now regulations were is
sued under the name of Brig.
Gen. Winant Sidle, chief of in
formation of the U.S. Military
Command. The aim, he said, is
"to withhold information which
will be of intelligence value to
the enemy."
The Communists have been
building around Khe Sanh and
other points along the demili
tarized zone for several
months. U.S. officials have
expecting a large-scale attack
aimed at knocking out the Khe
Sanh base and clearing an in

filtration route right Into
South Vietnam's two northern
provinces.
Two of South Vietnam's four
corps commanders have been
replaced in the highest level
shake-up In the South Viet
namese army In two years, an
official spokesman disclosed
today.
A spokesman for the Viet
namese joint general staff said
Maj. Gen. Nguyen Van Manh
has been replaced as command
er of the 4th Corps, which in
cludes the Viet Cong-infested
Mekong Delta below Saigon.
He said Lt. Gen. Vinh Loc, a
member of Vietnam's former
royalty, has been replaced as
commander of the 2nd Corps.
Gen. William C. Westmore
land, the U.S. commander in
Vietnam ,says he sees no reason
to believe the North Vietnamese

have changed their plan to at
tack Khe Sanh. But he added
heavy U.S. air attacks may
force them to modify their stra
tegy.
But. Gen. Earle G. Wheeler,
chairman of the U.S. Joint
Chiefs of Staff who just ended a
visit to Vietnam ,told newsmen
in Bangkok, Thailand, it was his
belief the enemy would not at
tack because he would have to
pay "too dear a price."
Elsewhere across the coun
try, scattered clashes were re
ported by U.S. headquarters,
but there were no accounts of
major sustained fighting.
Thq command said there \vere
five 852 strikes inside the coun
try, three late Sunday and two
Monday morning. The Strategic
Air Command bombers hit
around Khe Sanh, Dak To, Kon
tum and southwest of Hue.
