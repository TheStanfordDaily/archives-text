# IJB Sets Hearing On CIA Protest
## 
### 
The all-faculty Interim Judici
al Body (IJB) has set March 1
as the date for hearing Dean of
Students Joel Smith's appeal in
the case of nine students acquit
ted last week of charges of vio
lating University policy on cam
pus demonstrations.
However, the student Judicial
Council, which rendered the or
iginal verdict of not guilty in
all nine cases, has refused to
surrender tapes of the trial to
either the dean or the IJB. The
IJB, numbering no students
among its members, is not rec
ognized by the Associated Stu
dents.
The Council had decided the
policy on demonstrations was
unconstitutionally and vaguely
overbroad, and "entirely unen
forceable." It also maintained
the students had not violated
the Fundamental Standard of
student behavior.
The students had been among
more than 50 demonstrators
against Central Intelligence Ag

ency recruiting in Encina Hall,
Nov. 1.
Three of the defendants told
The Daily yesterday they will
not attend the appeal hearing.
The remaining six could not be
reached for comment, but their
previous remarks indicate they
will also boycott the proceed
ings.
The Daily will print Thursday
the full text of the Judicial
Council's decision in this case,
including the separate (one dis
senting) opinions submitted by
several members.
University Provost Richard
Lyman said yesterday he was
"not persuaded" by Such's reas
oning for withholding tapes of
the Council's hearings from the
IJB. He said, if the Council does
not change its mind, it "makes
it impossible to do anything
but" retry the case de novo be
fore the IJB.
Such had written Lyman ex
plaining why the Council had
decided to withhold the tapes,
which are the only official rec
ord of the trial.
