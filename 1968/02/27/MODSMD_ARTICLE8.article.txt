## Laotian Outpost Seized, Reds Step Up Offensive 
### 
PAKSANE, Laos (AP) — A
mixed force of North Viet
namese and Laotian Commu
nists have seized a Laotian mili
tary outpost 30 miles north of
the Mekong River garrison on
the border of Thailand.
The assault Sunday night—
part of a Communist offensive
in Laos that is believed coordi
nated with Red moves in Viet
nam — brought consternation in
Thailand, a U.S. ally troubled
by Communist guerrilla activi
ty.
In Bangkok, Thai Premier
Thanom Kittikachorn said he
was "seriously concerned" that
Communist combat units were
in northeast Thailand.
But to reach Thai territory
the Communist force would
have to overrun Paksane and
Laotian military, commanders
expressed doubt they would try
that.
• Mopping Up In Hue
HUE, Vietnam (AP) — Spo
radic fighting continued here as
a mopping process went on in
the former. Vietnamese imperial
capital. The U.S. Command said
a search of the palace grounds
in the Citadel had turned up
graves containing 140 enemy
bodies.
Associated Press correspond
ent John Lengel reported from
Hue that residents of the city
were struggling to bring back
some sort of semblance of life,
but that they faced staggering
problems.
Electrical service was re
stored in some areas, Lengel
said, and a trickle of civil ser
vants has started back to work.
• Arab-Israeli Talks?
JERUSALEM (AP) — For
eign Minister Abba Eban of
fered Arab states Monday "a
form of negotiations" that he
said Arab governments have
used in the past in an attempt to
settle the Middle East crisis.
A Foreign Ministry spokes
man said Eban meant that Is
rael had agreed to meet Arab

diplomats in direct talks, with
U.N. peace envoy Gunnar V.
Jarring as chairman.
At the United Nations, Secre
tary-General U Thant announc
ed he is recalling Jarring for
conferences on "prospects for
entering a new stage" in the at
tempt to obtain an Arab-Israeli
settlement.
There was no word from
Egypt or Jordan, Israel's chief
antagonists in the June war,
that they would accept the Eban
formula. They have steadfastly
refused to negotiate directly
with Israel.
• Riot Report Due
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sour
ces close to the President's Com
mission on Civil Disorders said
Monday the commission will
urge that the nation's police de
partments establish special of
fices to improve relations with
slum dwellers.
As an added incentive, these
sources said, the commission
will recommend that the federal
government pay 90 per cent of
the salaries of these communi
ty-service officers. Still there
are indications that some police
officials will resist the move.
"Community • service officers
would be recruited from ghetto
areas and they would work in
the ghettos," one source said.
"But they will be part of the
police department — they'll be
hybrid police officers."
• Rights Pact Near
WASHINGTON (AP)—Bright
ening prospects for a compro
mise outweighed Monday the
failure of a second move to cut
off Senate debate on civil rights
legislation.
The vote to halt the debate
was 56 to 36, or six short of the
necessary two-thirds majority.
Son. Norris Cotton, R-N. H., vot
ed for the cut-off this time. Oth
erwise there were no switches.
The outcome was anticipated,
but both before and after the
vote key senators spoke hopeful
ly of reaching a compromise on

a civil rights protection bill and
a proposed open-housing amend
ment.
Southern foes of the legisla
tion obviously are disturbed by
the turn of events. They were
left out of the compromise nego
tiations.
• Africans Quit Games
LONDON (AP) — While Av
ery Brundage insisted in London
Monday that no one country or
group of countries can prevent
the Summer Olympics from tak
ing place, 32 African nations
voted in the Congo to withdraw
from the Mexico Games.
And as Brundage, president of
the International Olympic Com
mittee, said he did not expect to
call a special general meeting
of the lOC to discuss the South
Africa controversy, the Italian
Olympic Committee called for
exactly such a meeting.
The lOC has readmitted South
Africa to the 1968 Games after
barring the country from the
1964 Olympics.
Russia has not announced any
action it intends to take but has
indicated it might support any
boycott by the African nations.
• Papers Tomorrow
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
"Going smoothly" was the re
port as editorial and mechanical
employes worked Monday to
ward resumption of publication
Wednesday by San Francisco's
two daily newspapers after a
55-day shutdown.
Full editorial staffs were on
duty for the first time Monday
since the Mailers Union struck
Jan. 5 against the San Francisco
Newspaper Printing Co., which
puts out both the independent
morning Chronicle and the
Hearst afternoon Examiner.
The mailers and 14 other un
ions which had respected the
picket lines approved three-year
contracts Sunday with a com
mon expiration date and calling
for package raises of about $10,
j&10 and $12 generally over the
period.
Big Spending Error
< SACRAMENTO (AP) — The
Reagan administration reported
a major mistake in school
Spending estimates Monday,
blamed it on Assembly Speaker
Jesse M. Unruh and said the
fiscal fumble could wipe out
planned property tax cuts.
. It was just the latest in a
series of financial riddles that
have plagued Republican Gov.
Reagan from his first day in
office, and it carried sharp politi
cal overtones.
Announcement of the multi
million dollar underestimate in
spending for local schools came
from Reagan's finance director,
Gordon P. Smith, who will leave
office March 1 and is seriously
considering a bid for the U.S.
Senate.
• Goddard Backs Bill
WASHINGTON (AP) — Food
and Drugs Commissioner James
L. Goddard officially supported
Monday an administration pro
posal to make possession of
LSD a misdemeanor but made
clear he remains personally op
posed to it and doubts its effect
as a deterent.
"I wouldn't propose that sec
tion if it were under my juris
diction," Dr. Goddard said. But
he gave strong backing to the
remainder of the bill which
would step up penalties for
manufacture, sale and distribu
tion of stimulants, depressants
and hallucinogens.
He said there is "some evi
dence there is a decline in the
usage of LSD" because young
people are beginning to recog
nize its dangers, and noted that
even stiff possession penalties
for marijuana have had little
deterrent effect.

• Wall St. Summary
NEW YORK (AP)—The stock
market see-saw dipped sharply
Monday following its recovery
last week. Trading slackened.
Volume dropped to 7.82 mil
lion shares from 8.81 million
Friday.
The mild decline on Friday,
which reduced the week's sub
stantial gains, was disappointing
to some traders and they pulled
to the sidelines, analysts said.
At the same time there was
some disconcerting news, both
from the economy and from
Southeast Asia.
The Dow Jones industrial av
erage fell 8.03 to 841.77, severely
clipping the gain of 13.46 it
made last week.
