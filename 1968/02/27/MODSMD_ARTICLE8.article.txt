## Laotian Outpost Seized, Reds Step Up Offensive 
### 
PAKSANE, Laos (AP) — A
mixed force of North Viet
namese and Laotian Commu
nists have seized a Laotian mili
tary outpost 30 miles north of
the Mekong River garrison on
the border of Thailand.
The assault Sunday night—
part of a Communist offensive
in Laos that is believed coordi
nated with Red moves in Viet
nam — brought consternation in
Thailand, a U.S. ally troubled
by Communist guerrilla activi
ty.
In Bangkok, Thai Premier
Thanom Kittikachorn said he
was "seriously concerned" that
Communist combat units were
in northeast Thailand.
But to reach Thai territory
the Communist force would
have to overrun Paksane and
Laotian military, commanders
expressed doubt they would try
that.
• Mopping Up In Hue
HUE, Vietnam (AP) — Spo
radic fighting continued here as
a mopping process went on in
the former. Vietnamese imperial
capital. The U.S. Command said
a search of the palace grounds
in the Citadel had turned up
graves containing 140 enemy
bodies.
Associated Press correspond
ent John Lengel reported from
Hue that residents of the city
were struggling to bring back
some sort of semblance of life,
but that they faced staggering
problems.
Electrical service was re
stored in some areas, Lengel
said, and a trickle of civil ser
vants has started back to work.
• Arab-Israeli Talks?
JERUSALEM (AP) — For
eign Minister Abba Eban of
fered Arab states Monday "a
form of negotiations" that he
said Arab governments have
used in the past in an attempt to
settle the Middle East crisis.
A Foreign Ministry spokes
man said Eban meant that Is
rael had agreed to meet Arab

diplomats in direct talks, with
U.N. peace envoy Gunnar V.
Jarring as chairman.
At the United Nations, Secre
tary-General U Thant announc
ed he is recalling Jarring for
conferences on "prospects for
entering a new stage" in the at
tempt to obtain an Arab-Israeli
settlement.
There was no word from
Egypt or Jordan, Israel's chief
antagonists in the June war,
that they would accept the Eban
formula. They have steadfastly
refused to negotiate directly
with Israel.
• Riot Report Due
WASHINGTON (AP) — Sour
ces close to the President's Com
mission on Civil Disorders said
Monday the commission will
urge that the nation's police de
partments establish special of
fices to improve relations with
slum dwellers.
As an added incentive, these
sources said, the commission
will recommend that the federal
government pay 90 per cent of
the salaries of these communi
ty-service officers. Still there
are indications that some police
officials will resist the move.
"Community • service officers
would be recruited from ghetto
areas and they would work in
the ghettos," one source said.
"But they will be part of the
police department — they'll be
hybrid police officers."
• Rights Pact Near
WASHINGTON (AP)—Bright
ening prospects for a compro
mise outweighed Monday the
failure of a second move to cut
off Senate debate on civil rights
legislation.
The vote to halt the debate
was 56 to 36, or six short of the
necessary two-thirds majority.
Son. Norris Cotton, R-N. H., vot
ed for the cut-off this time. Oth
erwise there were no switches.
The outcome was anticipated,
but both before and after the
vote key senators spoke hopeful
ly of reaching a compromise on

a civil rights protection bill and
a proposed open-housing amend
ment.
Southern foes of the legisla
tion obviously are disturbed by
the turn of events. They were
left out of the compromise nego
tiations.
• Africans Quit Games
LONDON (AP) — While Av
ery Brundage insisted in London
Monday that no one country or
group of countries can prevent
the Summer Olympics from tak
ing place, 32 African nations
voted in the Congo to withdraw
from the Mexico Games.
And as Brundage, president of
the International Olympic Com
mittee, said he did not expect to
call a special general meeting
of the lOC to discuss the South
Africa controversy, the Italian
Olympic Committee called for
exactly such a meeting.
The lOC has readmitted South
Africa to the 1968 Games after
barring the country from the
1964 Olympics.
Russia has not announced any
action it intends to take but has
indicated it might support any
boycott by the African nations.
• Papers Tomorrow
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
"Going smoothly" was the re
port as editorial and mechanical
employes worked Monday to
ward resumption of publication
Wednesday by San Francisco's
two daily newspapers after a
55-day shutdown.
Full editorial staffs were on
duty for the first time Monday
since the Mailers Union struck
Jan. 5 against the San Francisco
Newspaper Printing Co., which
puts out both the independent
morning Chronicle and the
Hearst afternoon Examiner.
The mailers and 14 other un

picket lines approved three-year
