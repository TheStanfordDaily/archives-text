This little night owl leads a daytime life when the first
spring sun appears. A neo-classic nicety, impeccably tailored
like all John Meyer sleepwear convertibles. It comes in an
appealing Barclay open stripe (a soft mix of Dacron* polyester
and cotton). And, as befits a pinafore, it is demurely edged
with lace. In good-little-girl colors: blue, orange, yellow
or green on a pristine white background $77. Now
being shown at discerning stores everywhere.
