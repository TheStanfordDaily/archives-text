# Drug Policy: 'No Campus Sanctuary'
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Stafford will not serve as a sanctuary
from enforcement of drug laws, accord
ing to a University drugs policy statement
issued yesterday by President Wallace
Sterling.
"The University will take whatever
steps, including disciplinary action, may
be required to safeguard the campus
against drug abuse," the statement assert
ed.
There are no agreements or understand
ing between Stanford officials and any po
lice authorities that would prevent police
from enforcing drug laws on campus, Uni
versity administrators emphasized.
"There is a widespread belief that the
University has negotiated an understand
ing with police agencies that they would
ignore drug usage on campus," Dean of
Students Joel P. Smith said.
"This is untrue," he explained. "The
University will not act to insulate its
students from the consequences of their
actions. We have had no conversations
with any police authorities whatever."
Smith said that he did not foresee a
massive campaign to wipe out drug use on
campus. He said that he would only deal
with specific cases as they come to his at
tention.
"The University is not a law enforce
ment agency. But we must try to main
tain respect for the law."
Smith said he was "bothered and

troubled" by tl tie number of students and
and faculty w ho have assumed the eani
pus to be a si mctuary from the law.
At the same time, students were inform
ed in Sterling's statement that "the Uni
versity will co r itinue to provide educational
and informational programs about drugs,
and will encourage use of counseling ser
vices provided on a confidential basis by
the Health Sorvice" and the Counseling
and Testing (Center.
In addition, the Health Service and
Counseling and Testing are planning an
intensified drug education program for
spring quarter. A symposium has tenta
tively been scheduled for April 6.
Concurrently, data were released that
show that a 1 $ of last spring one out of
five Stanforc 1 undergraduates had tried
marijuana, - while only one in 18 un
dergraduate}- i had ever tried LSD or oth
er hallucino; fens.
These figui *es are contained in a pre
liminary repc >rt issued by Richard Blum
of Stanford's Institute for the Study of
Human Probl ems.
Blum interviewed a cross-section of 300
Stanford undergraduates last year as a
part of a 130'3-student survey at five insti
tutions.
Blum's survey of the Stanford under
graduate sl:u dents showed:
• Only one in 25 had ever used mari
juana mona than once a week.
• More than half those who reported

experience with marijuana said they used
it less than five times a year.
• 94 per cent had used alcohol at least
once in their lifetime and 76 per cen*c had
used tobacco.
Blum said colleges have shown great In
terest in marijuana and the hallucinogenic
drugs, but relatively little in the pr even
tion of ill effects of alcohol and tobacco.
The issuance of yesterday's policy was
delayed while "advice was gathered and
the statement was hammered out,'" Pro
vost Richard W. Lyman stated. ' 'Since
the incident at Stony Brook (N. Y. ) our
uneasiness has grown with every da; y that
passed."
On Jan. 8, nearly 200 police agent s con
ducted a well-planned night time wild at
State University of New York at Stony
Brook, arresting 46 students in university
dormitories.
Checks made last month by The I )aily
with police officials indicate that their
Interest in Stanford's drug problem may
only be secondary since they are inter
ested mainly in large-scale suppliers.
Palo Alto police officer, Antony Pos o sees
"no big problem" with Stanford. H e said
his investigations have not led him onto
the campus.
None of the investigations of th e San
Francisco Federal Bureau of Narcotics
have led to the campus thus far, Siocord
ing to an agent who declined to be identi
fied. "Our interest primarily Is in inter

state or ii iternational trafficking," he
stated.
The four -man narcotics detail in the
Santa Clar a County Sheriff's Office "re
fused to jeopardize any current investiga
tions," by comment, although they did in
dicate moire interest in pushers than the
occasional user.
Smith rejected the role of "police of
ficer," si lying he would continue to keep
all University disciplinary actions strlct
lj' confidential.
But h e emphasized that internal disci
plinary action would be taken against
campus drug users at his discretion. Any
use of drugs — even incidental use —
could warrant a "response" from the
dean's office.
Smi th indicated that drug cases will not
be handled differently from other discl
plina r,y cases. Student judicial proceedings
have been handled in the past through the
s tud.ent Judicial Council or directly
through the dean's office.
Mot all disciplinary action on student
off enses would necessarily be judicial,
! Smith explained. Reactions could vary
from discussion with the student to very
serious disciplinary action like expulsion.
There are also a wide range of intermedi
a te responses possible," Smith said.
"All University disciplinary actions are
1 tept secret if the student requests it,"he
added.

students from the consequences of their
actions. We have had no conversations
with any police authorities whatever."
Smith said that he did not foresee a
massive campaign to wipe out drug use on
campus. He said that he would only deal
with specific cases as they come to his at
tention.
"The University is not a law enforce
ment agency. But we must try to main
tain respect for the law."
Smith said he was "bothered and

troubled" by tl tie number of students and

At the same time, students were inform

and informational programs about drugs,
and will encourage use of counseling ser
vices provided on a confidential basis by
the Health Sorvice" and the Counseling
and Testing (Center.
In addition, the Health Service and
Counseling and Testing are planning an
intensified drug education program for
spring quarter. A symposium has tenta
tively been scheduled for April 6.
Concurrently, data were released that
show that a 1 $ of last spring one out of
five Stanforc 1 undergraduates had tried
marijuana, - while only one in 18 un
dergraduate}- i had ever tried LSD or oth
er hallucino; fens.
These figui *es are contained in a pre
liminary repc >rt issued by Richard Blum
of Stanford's Institute for the Study of
Human Probl ems.
Blum interviewed a cross-section of 300
Stanford undergraduates last year as a
part of a 130'3-student survey at five insti
tutions.
Blum's survey of the Stanford under
graduate sl:u dents showed:
• Only one in 25 had ever used mari
juana mona than once a week.
• More than half those who reported

experience with marijuana said they used
it less than five times a year.
• 94 per cent had used alcohol at least
once in their lifetime and 76 per cen*c had
used tobacco.
Blum said colleges have shown great In
terest in marijuana and the hallucinogenic
drugs, but relatively little in the pr even
tion of ill effects of alcohol and tobacco.
The issuance of yesterday's policy was
delayed while "advice was gathered and
the statement was hammered out,'" Pro
vost Richard W. Lyman stated. ' 'Since
the incident at Stony Brook (N. Y. ) our
uneasiness has grown with every da; y that
passed."
On Jan. 8, nearly 200 police agent s con
ducted a well-planned night time wild at
State University of New York at Stony
Brook, arresting 46 students in university
dormitories.
Checks made last month by The I )aily
with police officials indicate that their
Interest in Stanford's drug problem may
only be secondary since they are inter
ested mainly in large-scale suppliers.
Palo Alto police officer, Antony Pos o sees
"no big problem" with Stanford. H e said
his investigations have not led him onto
the campus.
None of the investigations of th e San

stated.

Santa Clar a County Sheriff's Office "re

Smith rejected the role of "police of
ficer," si lying he would continue to keep
all University disciplinary actions strlct

But h e emphasized that internal disci
plinary action would be taken against
campus drug users at his discretion. Any
use of drugs — even incidental use —
could warrant a "response" from the
dean's office.

be handled differently from other discl
plina r,y cases. Student judicial proceedings
have been handled in the past through the

through the dean's office.
Mot all disciplinary action on student
off enses would necessarily be judicial,
! Smith explained. Reactions could vary
from discussion with the student to very
serious disciplinary action like expulsion.
There are also a wide range of intermedi
a te responses possible," Smith said.
"All University disciplinary actions are
1 tept secret if the student requests it,"he
added.
Stafford will not serve as a sanctuary
from enforcement of drug laws, accord

the Health Sorvice" and the Counseling
and Testing (Center.
In addition, the Health Service and
Counseling and Testing are planning an
intensified drug education program for
spring quarter. A symposium has tenta
tively been scheduled for April 6.
Concurrently, data were released that
show that a 1 $ of last spring one out of
five Stanforc 1 undergraduates had tried
marijuana, - while only one in 18 un
dergraduate}- i had ever tried LSD or oth
er hallucino; fens.
These figui *es are contained in a pre
liminary repc >rt issued by Richard Blum
of Stanford's Institute for the Study of
Human Probl ems.
Blum interviewed a cross-section of 300
Stanford undergraduates last year as a
part of a 130'3-student survey at five insti
tutions.
Blum's survey of the Stanford under
graduate sl:u dents showed:
• Only one in 25 had ever used mari
juana mona than once a week.
• More than half those who reported

experience with marijuana said they used
it less than five times a year.
• 94 per cent had used alcohol at least
once in their lifetime and 76 per cen*c had
used tobacco.
Blum said colleges have shown great In
terest in marijuana and the hallucinogenic
drugs, but relatively little in the pr even
tion of ill effects of alcohol and tobacco.
The issuance of yesterday's policy was
delayed while "advice was gathered and
the statement was hammered out,'" Pro
vost Richard W. Lyman stated. ' 'Since
the incident at Stony Brook (N. Y. ) our
uneasiness has grown with every da; y that
passed."
On Jan. 8, nearly 200 police agent s con
ducted a well-planned night time wild at
State University of New York at Stony
Brook, arresting 46 students in university
dormitories.
Checks made last month by The I )aily
with police officials indicate that their
Interest in Stanford's drug problem may
only be secondary since they are inter
ested mainly in large-scale suppliers.
Palo Alto police officer, Antony Pos o sees
"no big problem" with Stanford. H e said
his investigations have not led him onto
the campus.
None of the investigations of th e San
Francisco Federal Bureau of Narcotics
have led to the campus thus far, Siocord
ing to an agent who declined to be identi
fied. "Our interest primarily Is in inter

state or ii iternational trafficking," he
stated.
The four -man narcotics detail in the
Santa Clar a County Sheriff's Office "re
fused to jeopardize any current investiga
tions," by comment, although they did in
dicate moire interest in pushers than the
occasional user.
Smith rejected the role of "police of
ficer," si lying he would continue to keep
all University disciplinary actions strlct
lj' confidential.
But h e emphasized that internal disci
plinary action would be taken against
campus drug users at his discretion. Any
use of drugs — even incidental use —
could warrant a "response" from the
dean's office.
Smi th indicated that drug cases will not
be handled differently from other discl
plina r,y cases. Student judicial proceedings
have been handled in the past through the
s tud.ent Judicial Council or directly
through the dean's office.
Mot all disciplinary action on student
off enses would necessarily be judicial,
! Smith explained. Reactions could vary
from discussion with the student to very
serious disciplinary action like expulsion.
There are also a wide range of intermedi
a te responses possible," Smith said.
"All University disciplinary actions are
1 tept secret if the student requests it,"he
added.
Stafford will not serve as a sanctuary
from enforcement of drug laws, accord
ing to a University drugs policy statement
issued yesterday by President Wallace
Sterling.
"The University will take whatever
steps, including disciplinary action, may
be required to safeguard the campus
against drug abuse," the statement assert
ed.
There are no agreements or understand
ing between Stanford officials and any po
lice authorities that would prevent police
from enforcing drug laws on campus, Uni
versity administrators emphasized.
"There is a widespread belief that the
University has negotiated an understand
ing with police agencies that they would
ignore drug usage on campus," Dean of
Students Joel P. Smith said.
"This is untrue," he explained. "The
University will not act to insulate its
students from the consequences of their
actions. We have had no conversations
with any police authorities whatever."
Smith said that he did not foresee a
massive campaign to wipe out drug use on
campus. He said that he would only deal
with specific cases as they come to his at
tention.
"The University is not a law enforce
ment agency. But we must try to main
tain respect for the law."
Smith said he was "bothered and

troubled" by tl tie number of students and
and faculty w ho have assumed the eani
pus to be a si mctuary from the law.
