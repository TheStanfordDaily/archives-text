## Washington Fights Cherry Tree Gap 
### Art Buchwald 
They've just discovered a new
batch of papers belonging to
President George Washington
and among them was a tran
script of a press conference
held at George's home when he
was 6 years old. It shed new
light on the famous cherry
tree-chopping incident.
A spokesman for the Wash
ington family, not identified in
the papers, was asked at the
noon briefing to comment on
the destruction of a beautiful
young cherry tree on the estate.
Spokesman: "To my knowl
edge, there have been no cherry
trees destroyed on the pro
perty."
Reporter: "Is it possible a
cherry tree could have been
chopped down without your
knowledge?"
Spokesman: "I believe that I
would be informed if a cherry
tree were destroyed, and I'm
not going to deal in rumor and
conjecture."
Reporter: "But someone ac
tually saw the cherry tree

chopped down. It's out there
by the garden."
Sipokesmain:: "I'll check into it
and get baok to you."
At .3:30 p.m. briefing:
Sp okesmam: "I have an an
nour crement to make. A small
cheri y tree aecidently fell down
on 1 he Washington property
this i norning. \ Ve are now inves
tigating to fin d out what hap
pened .
Rep orter: "D oes anyone know
who c chopped i Jown the tree?"
Spol cesman: "I said it was
an aci ?ident."
Reporter: "Bi it witnesses who
saw tl ie tree say that there
were a xe mark s on the trunk,
indicate ng that ! someone had de
liberate. ly chop ped it down."
Spoke sman: ". I think that any
one who spreads a malicious
rumor li ike that is doing a dis
service to the future United
States oi 112 Amer ica."
Report er: "Tl lese same wit
nesses say that t hey saw 6-year
old George Wasl lington walking
away froi n the i orchard with a

hatchet over his shoulder. Is
it possible that young George
could have chopped down the
tree?"
Spokesman: "Whose side are
you on? It is rumors like this
that are giving aid and comfort
to the British. I can say author
itatively that George Washing
ton had absolutely nothing to
do with the chopping down of
this cherry tree."
Reporter: "How would we be
giving aid and comfort to the
British if we printed this
story?"
Spokesman: "Someday George
Washington may be the father
of his country, and if it were
known that he had once indis
criminately chopped down a
cherry tree, it would play right
into the hands of the Torries,
who would do anything to dis
credit him."
At the six o'clock briefing:
Spokesman: "I have an an

nouncememt to make. At 10
o'clock this morning, George
Washington,, age 6, swung his
hatchet playfully at a 6-foot-3
cherry tree and knocked it to
the ground.
"At exactly 12:17 p.m., George
was asked by his father if he
knew who had chopped down
the tree. Without hesitation
young Washington replied, and
I quote, 'I cannot tell a lie, Pa.
I cut it down with my hatchet.' "
Reporter: "'ls that all he said?"
Spokesman: "I see no reason
to go into this matter any furth
er."
Reporter: ' 'But wouldn't you
say there '.vas a credibility
gap in Washi ngton between the
time he chop ped down the cher
ry tree and confessed to doing
it?"
Spokesman: "George Washing
ton, as all future Presidents of
the United States, 1 would never
lie to the press."
