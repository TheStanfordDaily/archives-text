# Letters To The Editor
## SRT Students Give Theater New Depth 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
Though I certainly am appre
ciative of the kind words ex
pressed by Curt Keck about the
recent Ram's Head production
of "Roar of the Greasepaint,
Smell of the Crowd," it might
be wise to point out a few addi
tional facts about the synthesis
of SRT (a part of the Speech
and Drama Department), Ram's
Head, and undergraduate drama
at Stanford in general.
The "Greasepaint" cast in
cluded not only myself and Car
rillo Gantner, a second - year
MFA student in Acting, but also
Reba Waters and Gretchen
Grant, first-year MFA students
in Acting, and Susan Ray and
Hilary Kelvin, undergraduate
majors in Drama.
Three other "urchins," not
majors, are currently taking my
advanced undergraduate acting
class. That means that out of a
cast of sixteen, nine people have
direct association with the De
partment of Speech and Drama.
Further Outside Help
At the production end of
"Greasepaint," let it be duly
noted that Roger Oliver, who
was stage manager, is a Ph.D.
student in the Drama Depart
ment; Stephen Maze, lighting
designer, is on the staff of SRT;
Regina Cate, costume designer,
is a second-year MFA student;
Robert Morgan, scene designer,
is a second-year MFA directing
student. (Mr. Morgan, by the
way, will be directing the Ram's
Head Spring production of "Car
nival.) And, as Mr. Keck said,
Stephen Jay Book, director of
the show, is a first-year MFA
student in directing in the De
partment of Speech and Drama.
Further, it might also be re
membered that last year's suc
cessful Ram's Head production
of "The Boyfriend" was direct-

Ed by an MP "A cai ididate in di
recting, Douj :las Johnson, who
will direct '"I 'he In spector Gen
eral," SRT's final play of the
season.
Finally, thoi -igh I am one of
the professioi lal n lembers of
SRT, I also te, ach tl he two-year
undergraduate acting program
and share the direc ting of un
dergraduate Spt ?ech i and Drama
productions.

Though I certainly am appre
ciative of the kind words ex
pressed by Curt Keck about the
recent Ram's Head production
of "Roar of the Greasepaint,
Smell of the Crowd," it might
be wise to point out a few addi
tional facts about the synthesis
of SRT (a part of the Speech
and Drama Department), Ram's
Head, and undergraduate drama
at Stanford in general.
The "Greasepaint" cast in
cluded not only myself and Car
rillo Gantner, a second - year
MFA student in Acting, but also
Reba Waters and Gretchen
Grant, first-year MFA students
in Acting, and Susan Ray and
Hilary Kelvin, undergraduate
majors in Drama.
Three other "urchins," not
majors, are currently taking my
advanced undergraduate acting
class. That means that out of a
cast of sixteen, nine people have
direct association with the De
partment of Speech and Drama.
Further Outside Help
At the production end of
"Greasepaint," let it be duly
noted that Roger Oliver, who
was stage manager, is a Ph.D.
student in the Drama Depart
ment; Stephen Maze, lighting
designer, is on the staff of SRT;
Regina Cate, costume designer,
is a second-year MFA student;
Robert Morgan, scene designer,
is a second-year MFA directing
student. (Mr. Morgan, by the
way, will be directing the Ram's
Head Spring production of "Car
nival.) And, as Mr. Keck said,
Stephen Jay Book, director of
the show, is a first-year MFA
student in directing in the De
partment of Speech and Drama.
Further, it might also be re
membered that last year's suc
cessful Ram's Head production
of "The Boyfriend" was direct-

Ed by an MP "A cai ididate in di
recting, Douj :las Johnson, who
will direct '"I 'he In spector Gen
eral," SRT's final play of the
season.
Finally, thoi -igh I am one of
the professioi lal n lembers of
SRT, I also te, ach tl he two-year
undergraduate acting program
and share the direc ting of un
dergraduate Spt ?ech i and Drama
productions.
