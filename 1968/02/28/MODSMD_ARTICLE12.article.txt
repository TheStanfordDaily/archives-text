# The

## 'War Lords' Corrupt South Vietnam

today from Saigon.)
Although the Viet Cong are
still pounding on the gates of
Saigon and the city drifts to
sleep at night to the lullaby of
artillery fire, South Vietnam is
more likely to be defeated by
corruption than communism.
The American taxpayers are
pouring almost $30 billion a year
into this war-wracked land. To a
disturbing extent they are sup
plying both sides in the conflict.

For the V iet Cong have manag
ed to acquire huge quantities of
U.S. aid.
Obviously, corrupt South Viet
namese officials have been sell
ing to the Communists supplies
that were supposed to be used
to fight the Communists.
Take r.he perplexing rice
shortage, :for example. Rice hap
pens to be South Vietnam's prin
cipal crop», and production hasn't
declined 5 significantly during the
past thre et years. Yet, over the

same period, the United States
has tripled rice shipments to
this country.
Increased Commitment
In February 1965, South Viet
nam needed only 35,000 tons of
rice from the U.S. to foed its
people. But, last month, the re
quirement had soared to 100,000
tons. Clearly, a lot of U.S. rice
is going to feed our enemies as
well as our frjends in Vietnam.
Of course, rice is lost from
spoilage as well as pilferage. The
South Vietnamese government
keeps about 185,000 tons in its
storehouses, enough to take care
of the rice shortage for one
month. An estimated 90 per cent
of this is American rice.
Sen. Abe Ribicoff, D-C'onn.,
chose a warehouse at random
for inspection. They found one
third of the rice — about 12 tons
— so infested with insects that
it was not usable.
Refugee Funds
Refugee workers have adso
confided to this column that
South Vietnam's pathetic refu
gees receive less than half of
the $30 million which the Ameri
can taxpayers contribute each
year for refugee relief.
The supplies simply are si
phoned off by the military com
manders, who run the provin
cial governments and distribute
U.S. aid.
Homes that were supposed to
be built for refugees, for ex
ample, have been sold instead
to the highest bidders. Even
more shocking, the military com
manders have kept for them
selves food that was desperate
ly needed by the hungry refu
gees.
A charade is staged for the
U.S. inspectors who are suppos
ed to oversee the program. They
cannot move around the hinter
lands, of course, without the

knowledge and sanction of the
provincial chiefs.
Before the inspectors arrive,
the refugees are scrupulously
issued the supplies that were in
tended for them. The inspectors
have heard, however, that the
supplies often are taken back
after they depart.
War Lords Rule
South Vietnam is divided into
four army corps areas, whose
commanders can only be de
scribed as "war lords." Although
their power has been reduced
from earlier years, they still con
trol their) areas through the
troops they command.
Together, they also dominate
the central government. It was
the corps. commanders, for ex
ample, who installed Nguyen
Cao Ky as premier until they
found him too difficult to con
trol.
Then they backed the more
amenable Nguyen Van Thieu for
president, forcing Ty to step
down to the vice presidency.
This makes it obviously awk
ward for poor, Thieu to enforce
the reforms that U.S. Ambassa
dor Ellsworth Bunker keeps urg
ing upon him.
President Thieu can hardly
achieve effective reforms without
cracking down on the corps
commanders, who are the back
bone of his political power. Thus,
as long as Thieu heads the gov
ernment the system is unlikely
to be changed, unless the war,
lords can be persuaded to re
form themselves.
New Millionaires
Meanwhile, they are growing
fabulously rich on the U.S. mili
tary and economic aid that pass
es through their hands. It is
common gossip here that they
have made huge deposits in sec
ret Swiss bank accounts.
The waste in South Vietnam
is almost appalling as the cor
ruption. Typical is the handling
of fertilizer which the U.S. ships
to South Vietnam to help boost
agriculture pifiduction.
Urea fertilizer is packed in
moisture-tight plastic bags with
polyethylene liners, which keep
the product dry even in a rain
storm. Once moisture seeps into
the fertilizer, it begins to de
compose.

Investigators discovered that
Vietnamese truckers were load
ing the fertilizer with hooks,
which poked holes in the bags.
They noted in a confidential re
port to AID in Washington:
"Any fertilizer containing urea
stored in bags full of holes Is
not a bankable item."
The problem could have been
avoided simply by packing the
fertilizer in small bags. Suggest
ed the investigators: "Fertilizer
in 50 kg. bags is too heavy for
the average Vietnamese worker.
Fertilizer should be put In 25
kg. bags."
After the fertilizer was un
loaded it was usually stored on
the moist ground or rice hulls.
The moisture seeped into the
bags and caused a chemical re
action releasing ammonia into
the air.
What is really in needed in
Vietnam is an escalation of the
war against waste and corrup
tion.
