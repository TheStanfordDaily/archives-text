# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## Only Children Need War 
### Dan Snell 
Recently I returned home and
came across an old beat-up book
in my library that dates back
to my militaristic period.
Maybe not every little boy
goes through such a time, but
I remember being fascinated by
all armies and loving to read all
about them. And I am now stuck
with a large bunch of books
with torn and yellowing pages
about such fascinating subjects
as the submarines of France
and the tanks of the Wehrmacht.
The good thing about my mili
taristic period is that I outgrew
it.
The book that attracted me
now was a paperback thing held
together by numerous pieces of
scotch tape entitled "The Fatal
Decisions." It is a collection of
essays by German generals
about the mistakes that were
made by them and their collea
gues during World War Two.
Defeat's Clarification
General of the Air Force Wer
ner Kreipe describes the failure
of what has been called the Bat
tle of Britain, the air war over
England that was supposed to
cut off the English Channel from
Allied merchant shipping and
to destroy the Royal Air Force.
Supposedly the German air
attack on Britain was a prelude
to the land invasion of the is
land. Kreipe complains that the
German High Command vacil
lated about the objectives of the
air attacks.
The generals in charge could
not consistently bomb factories
or cities or skirmish with the
fighters of the Royal Air Force.
Kreipe thinks this was large
ly because nobody in Germany
knew exactly what the results
of the air actions were on the
ground and in the British air
force. At one point the Germans
did not know that the British
had almost no new fighters to
replace those that were being
shot down.
And so the Germans decided

not to engage the fighters just
at the time when they could per
haps have completely eliminat
ed them.
An Amalagous Argument
Ever since good old Thomas
Aquinas got debunked, it has not
been fashionable to argue by
analogy. And I do not want to
try to swim against the tide.
Certainly tile German position
over Britain 28 years ago can
not be seen as synonomous to
the American position <o'ver Viet
nam now. For one thing, the
British had proportionately more
air power than the North Viet
namese have.
But I think it is frightening
to ponder Kreipe's conclusion
about the much-celebrated battle
he participated in:
"So much is clear: though the
air battles over England were
perhaps a triumph of skill and
bravery so far as the German
air crews were concerned, from
the point of view of German
strategy it was a battle that
should never have been fought
at all."
Conversations at Home
At home I had a chance to
talk to an American television
correspondent who spent six
months in Vietnam and was
wounded there.
Did the American bombing
have any affect on the Commu
nist war effort in South Viet
nam?
"Oh, you could go around and
see craters where B-52 bombs
had dropped, but there wasn't
any widespread effect that was
noticeable," he replied.
"I mean, if you happened to
be standing right where the cen
ter of those craters were, you'd
be very, very dead, but other
wise there was no evidence that
Communist military operations
would be upset by the bombing,"
he said.
Build-Up Abroad
Andi now the Associated Press
has been saying that in spite of
the intensive bombing of the Khe

Sanh area, the "Communist
pressure builds steadily."
Bombing seems to me merely
a vestige of an obsolete style of
warfare that really has never
worked very efficiently anyway.
But I must admit that I also
feel that belief in war itself is
merely a vestige of an obsolete
style of dealing with interna
tional problems.
After all, I grew out of it;
why shouldn't other children?

about such fascinating subjects
as the submarines of France
and the tanks of the Wehrmacht.
The good thing about my mili
taristic period is that I outgrew
it.
The book that attracted me
now was a paperback thing held
together by numerous pieces of
scotch tape entitled "The Fatal
Decisions." It is a collection of
essays by German generals
about the mistakes that were
made by them and their collea
gues during World War Two.
Defeat's Clarification
General of the Air Force Wer
ner Kreipe describes the failure
of what has been called the Bat
tle of Britain, the air war over
England that was supposed to
cut off the English Channel from
Allied merchant shipping and
to destroy the Royal Air Force.
Supposedly the German air
attack on Britain was a prelude
to the land invasion of the is
land. Kreipe complains that the
German High Command vacil
lated about the objectives of the
air attacks.
The generals in charge could
not consistently bomb factories
or cities or skirmish with the
fighters of the Royal Air Force.
Kreipe thinks this was large
ly because nobody in Germany
knew exactly what the results
of the air actions were on the
ground and in the British air
force. At one point the Germans
did not know that the British
had almost no new fighters to
replace those that were being
shot down.
And so the Germans decided

not to engage the fighters just
at the time when they could per
haps have completely eliminat
ed them.
An Amalagous Argument
Ever since good old Thomas
Aquinas got debunked, it has not
been fashionable to argue by
analogy. And I do not want to
try to swim against the tide.
Certainly tile German position
over Britain 28 years ago can
not be seen as synonomous to
the American position <o'ver Viet
nam now. For one thing, the
British had proportionately more
air power than the North Viet
namese have.
But I think it is frightening
to ponder Kreipe's conclusion
about the much-celebrated battle
he participated in:
"So much is clear: though the
air battles over England were
perhaps a triumph of skill and
bravery so far as the German
air crews were concerned, from
the point of view of German
strategy it was a battle that
should never have been fought
at all."
Conversations at Home
At home I had a chance to
talk to an American television
correspondent who spent six
months in Vietnam and was
wounded there.
Did the American bombing
have any affect on the Commu
nist war effort in South Viet
nam?
"Oh, you could go around and
see craters where B-52 bombs
had dropped, but there wasn't
any widespread effect that was
noticeable," he replied.
"I mean, if you happened to
be standing right where the cen
ter of those craters were, you'd
be very, very dead, but other
wise there was no evidence that
Communist military operations
would be upset by the bombing,"
he said.
Build-Up Abroad
Andi now the Associated Press
has been saying that in spite of
the intensive bombing of the Khe

Sanh area, the "Communist
pressure builds steadily."
Bombing seems to me merely
a vestige of an obsolete style of
warfare that really has never
worked very efficiently anyway.
But I must admit that I also
feel that belief in war itself is
merely a vestige of an obsolete
style of dealing with interna
tional problems.
After all, I grew out of it;
why shouldn't other children?
Recently I returned home and
came across an old beat-up book
in my library that dates back
to my militaristic period.
Maybe not every little boy
goes through such a time, but
I remember being fascinated by
all armies and loving to read all
about them. And I am now stuck
with a large bunch of books
with torn and yellowing pages

and the tanks of the Wehrmacht.
