# Humphrey Attacks Protests, Cites Stanford Demonstrations
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice-
President Hubert H. Humphrey,
target of renewed anti-war pro
tests Saturday, deplored campus
peace demonstrations that esca
late into "censorship by intimi
dation."
He cited a melee after his
talk at Stanford University
last February as one example.
Humphrey said he saw cen
sorship by intimidation growing
in America when some citizens
cannot visit a college campus in
safety. He mentioned Stanford
University and Harvard Univer
sity by name in criticizing ex
tremism in anti-war protests.
After a Stanford speech last
year, the vice - president said,
"My party and I were able to re
turn to our cars only under
armed protection. Th 6 Secret
Servicemen with me were the
victims of abuse and had filth
thrown at them."
About 250 persons swarmed
around Humphrey and his es
cort as he left Memorial Audi
torium Feb. 20, shouting at him
and —in several instances — at
tempting to block his path.
There were reports—never con
firmed—some of the demonstra
tors pounded on Humphrey's
car.
"If abuse, violence, obscenity,
harassment and storm trooper
tactics have no place in our
peaceful American society—and
we say they don't — they are
dangerous to an extreme when
they obscure and disrupt the

purposes of a . . . university,"
Humphrey said.
I am not making a special
case for the Administration.
I am talking too about George
Wallace at Dartmouth. I am
talking about all citizens of
our nation who have the right
to be heard —not necessarily
to be taken seriously but to
be heard.
"No freedom of speech for re
actionaries, socialists, war-mon
gers, peaceniks, soon becomes
no freedom of speech for any
on," he said.
The vice-president called upon
college students to help protect
free speech, not curtail it. A uni
versity that requires a police

guard for speakers must ask it
self serious questions, Hum
phrey said.
Humphrey's speech at an
American University program
was interrupted near the end
by a walkout of about 50 stu
dents and half a dozen faculty
members. The remainder of the
audience of about 1,000 persons
responded with a standing ova
tion for Humphrey as the pro
testers departed.
The peaceful walkout at
American University came near
the conclusion of Humphrey's
talk, well beyond his comments
on student protests. The dem
onstrators passed out leaflets
opposing the war in Vietnam.

About 250 persons swarmed
around Humphrey and his es
cort as he left Memorial Audi
torium Feb. 20, shouting at him
and —in several instances — at
tempting to block his path.
There were reports—never con
firmed—some of the demonstra
tors pounded on Humphrey's
car.
"If abuse, violence, obscenity,
harassment and storm trooper
tactics have no place in our
peaceful American society—and
we say they don't — they are
dangerous to an extreme when
they obscure and disrupt the

purposes of a . . . university,"
Humphrey said.
I am not making a special
case for the Administration.
I am talking too about George
Wallace at Dartmouth. I am
talking about all citizens of
our nation who have the right
to be heard —not necessarily
to be taken seriously but to
be heard.
"No freedom of speech for re
actionaries, socialists, war-mon
gers, peaceniks, soon becomes
no freedom of speech for any
on," he said.
The vice-president called upon
college students to help protect
free speech, not curtail it. A uni
versity that requires a police

guard for speakers must ask it
self serious questions, Hum
phrey said.
Humphrey's speech at an
American University program
was interrupted near the end
by a walkout of about 50 stu
dents and half a dozen faculty
members. The remainder of the
audience of about 1,000 persons
responded with a standing ova
tion for Humphrey as the pro
testers departed.
The peaceful walkout at
American University came near
the conclusion of Humphrey's
talk, well beyond his comments
on student protests. The dem
onstrators passed out leaflets
opposing the war in Vietnam.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Vice-
President Hubert H. Humphrey,
target of renewed anti-war pro
tests Saturday, deplored campus
peace demonstrations that esca
late into "censorship by intimi
dation."
He cited a melee after his
talk at Stanford University
last February as one example.
Humphrey said he saw cen
sorship by intimidation growing
in America when some citizens
cannot visit a college campus in
safety. He mentioned Stanford
University and Harvard Univer
sity by name in criticizing ex
tremism in anti-war protests.
After a Stanford speech last
year, the vice - president said,
"My party and I were able to re
turn to our cars only under
armed protection. Th 6 Secret
Servicemen with me were the
victims of abuse and had filth
thrown at them."
