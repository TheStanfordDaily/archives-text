university Food Services man

$-ing to light many of the bud
get balancing, nutrition plan

ms that most students do not
alize exist.
Students at Wilbur and Bran
;r, which use the Wilbur Food
?rvice, are perhaps the most
;hement and the most humor
ous in expressing their feelings
•he food.
.lem Richardson remarks,
!j.t borders on the worst I've
ver tasted." Bill Alexander
choes this feeling. "I wouldn't
?ed Wilbur breakfasts to my
og and when they have some
ling good, there's not enough
$|112 it"
Tom Dee says, 'It tastes
like It looks. I'd rather take
vout a Stanford Dolly than eat
$

Wilbur food." John Reeder is
certain that, "Mrs. Malik
(Wilbur Food Service Direc
tor) owns stock in the Pepto
bismal Company."
Feelings on individual meals
are the most adamant. Bart
Sheela thinks, "The food crawls.
I expect to see the jello walk
away." Tom Stokes says he
"found a piece of string in the
tunafish."
Mark Roberts says he chipped
his tooth on a "hard object in
the hamburger." Sweet and sour
pork seemed to be the most
hated dish.
Some students have more fav
orable opinions. The most fre
quent comment is that the milk
is cold and good. Jim Coate says
"We get enough food. Dinners
are average. When you have
roast beef, potatoes, and peas,
it's pretty hard to muck it up."
Bruce Massey notices that
"the overall quality has im
proved since last year." He also
thinks that "the pastries are
the mainstay of the Wilbur ser
vice" and that "they do try to
have some diversity" in the
food.
Don Farrow says, "It's pass
able. It's not bad for cafeteria
food." John Richey says, "It's
quite good, but not worth
$220 a quarter." Several resi
dents concurred with Joe
Corde's sentiments that "the
food is underrated, except
we're underfed."
Quantity of food is a major
controversy. Jim Perloff, who
recently burned his meal ticket
in protest, claims that "portions
range in size from miniscule to
minimal." Walt Snyder feels
that "if we didn't have peanut

butter and jelly, we'd starve to
death." Dave Janke, in contrast,
says,"The quantity is great."
Wilbur is notorious for its food
fights which Stacy Zones claims
are not caused by the food but
because "we're all sexually frus
trated."
John Richey explained that
during the last month of
autumn quarter, there were
about two food fights a week.
There were "several skirmishes
but only one war." "The war
started out with rolls and escal
ated to meat loaf and pumpkin
pie."
Reactions to the quality and
quantity of food at Stern are
similar to those about Wilbur
food. Pete Sapin says that
"sometimes a meal is just so
bad, it's intolerable."
Craig Marinovich says,
"The big difference between
Stern and Wilbur is that you
get more food here (Wilbur),
but the quality is worse." At
Stern, the portions of meat
are considered by many to be
much too small.
Residents of the row houses,
where food is cooked and served
for small groups, are on a whole
much more pleased with the
food than Wilbur or Stern resi
dents. Cicely Bates thinks the
better quality of preparing the
food is due "to the smallness of
the setup."
Besides quality and quantity,
the price of $220 a quarter is
the cause of many arguments.
Some feel, like Bart Sheela, that
"for all the money we spend on
board, the food ought to be bet
ter."
Most students think that it is
unfair that meal tickets are not

transferable, since, they reason,
they have paid for all the meals.
They agree with Adam Ben
nion's suggestion of charging
each person only for the num
ber of meals that he eats.
William Myers, Manager of
the University Food Services,
explained the finances of the
Food Services, which affect the
quality and quantity of the food.
Concerning transferlng
meal tickets, he said that stu
dents do not realize that the
"premise of the ticket is 25
to 30 percent absenteeism."
The $220 does not pay for 100
percent of the meals as stu
dents mistakenly believe.
Presently the University Food
Services is "having financial dif
ficulties." Myers explained, "No
one anticipated the cost rise of
food."
Last year the board rate was
increased from $200 to $220. The
plan was that the Food Services
would make a profit over the
next two years and then, as the
price of food gradually rose,
would lose for the following two
years. In this way they would
break even over a four or five
year, period.
The Food Services made a
profit of $125,000 last year, in
cluding summer quarter.
"The money doesn't go any
where except the residence
halls," Myers emphasized. It is
used to finance years when the
Food Service loses money. Al
though they had planned to
make a profit this year, they
have not
From September until the
end of January, the Food Ser
vice has a deficit of $58,856.
"We're getting a little pan
icky," Myers confided.
Last year, the cost of food as
of this time of year was $374,320
in comparison to $412,534 so far
this year. A comparison of this
year's and last year's income and
expenditures from September
until the end of January shows
the straits the Food Services is
in.
THIS YEAR
Total Income, $1,018,416; To
tal Operating Costs, $1,077,272;
Deficit, $58,856.
LAST YEAR
Total Income, $1,015,773; To
tal Operating Costs, $1,011,557;
Profit, $4,216.
Although the Food Services
is losing money, Myers said,
"We have a tremendous amount
of pressure to maintain rates."
Mr. Myers, Mrs. Malik (Head
of the Wilbur Food Service),

Mrs. Karja (Head of the Stern
Food Service), and Miss Bullman
(Head of the Row Food Service)
discussed with The Daily sev
eral issues students had men
tioned.
Both the row houses and
Stern have food committees com
posed of representatives from
each living unit which meet to
discuss problems about the food.
Myers remarked, "The biggest
problem is competing with
Mom's cooking."
Although the food services
are criticized for dullness and
lack of variety in planning
the meals, Myers said that
new things they try are often
received badly.
Concerning the quality of meat
and the University meat policy,
Mrs. Karja explained that they
use only choice government
"Grade A" meat, and portions
are controlled so that everyone
gets the same amount.
The portions vary according
to the type of meat. "Boys' size
portions are bigger" than girls'
however.
All of the residences use left
overs. Myers said, "Wherever we
can reuse a product, we will."
Miss Bullman said, "It's foolish
to cook and throw away."
The University Food Ser
vices strive to find a balance
between service and quality of
food, according to the direc
tors. Miss Karja said, "Stan
ford prides itself that it still
has seated service" since most
institutions are completely
cafeteria style.
As students complain about
the food, they should consider
the alternative ways of improv
ing it. The board bill could be
raised, sit-down service could
be abolished, or individual resi
dence halls could be replaced
by a few large central dining
rooms for the whole campus.
Having considered the alter
natives, students may decide the
food is pretty good after all.
