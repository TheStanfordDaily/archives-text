; Century Russia" (314 pp., 58.50).
notes in the book's intro
duction: "Renowned for his
piety, his closeness to the earth,
and his devotion to Holy Mother
Russia, the peasant could at
times, exhibit behavior moti
vated by a materialism that
stood in direct contrast to any
religious beliefs.
"Kindness often alternated
with outbursts of cruel fury;
sentimentality was balanced by
a Strong-willed stubbornness. A
remarkably long tolerance of
despotism, squalor, and ex
ploitation was broken by sud
den and violent rebellions, but
even in the midst of revolt the
agp long pattern of command
and obedience would assert it
self when the peasant sought a
master to tell him how to fight."
