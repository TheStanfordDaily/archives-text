# Fifteen In First Group
## Madrid Program To Begin This Fall 
### HERBERT TERRY 
Fifteen Stanford students will
take up residence this Septem
ber in the University's first
large scale overseas study pro
gram in a Spanish-speaking na
tion.
The students, fourteen Span
ish majors and one history ma
jor, will be Group I of the new
Stanford Program in Madrid,
organized by the Department
of Spanish and Portuguese.
Modeled after the German
Department's program at the
University of Hamburg and the
French and Italian Department's
program at the University of
Nantes, students participating
in the Madrid program will
audit courses at the University
of Madrid and will be housed in
residences near the university
owned by the Spanish govern
ment.
According to Professor Ber
nard Gicovate, head of the
Spanish and Portuguese De
partment and organizer of the
Madrid program, "we hope

these students will feel them
selves a part of the Spanish
culture and have designed our
program along those lines."
Gicovate will serve as pro
fessor-in-residence for the first
group; his assistant will be Mrs.
Maria Carmen Ochoa, a gradu
ate of the University of Madrid
who is now making arrange
ments in Spain for the opening
of the program.
One problem encountered in
organizing the program, said
Gicovate, is the frequency of
student strikes at Madrid. He
said, however that in the event
of strikes "the director and his
assistant will have the expertise
and time to assume the teach
ing duties."
However student strikes do
not necessarily halt education
at Madrid, said Gicovate. Dur
ing the strikes life moves
from the university to the stu
dent residences.
The residences contain thea
ters, meeting halls, lecture
rooms and lounges. When the
university closes, professors

come to lecture, and students
organize classes.
Strikes, he said, have been
frequent in the past "but nego
tiations are now going on be
tween the students and the gov
ernment regarding the auto
nomy of the university and the
nature of the powers of the
Spanish police when dealing
with students."
Gicovate said he Is seeking
to place the Stanford students
in residences which are not
already overpopulated with
foreigners. The four men and
eleven women selected to par
ticipate In the program will
live in different residences
"and in the event that there
are double rooms the Stanford
student will have a Spanish
roommate," he added.
While at Madrid the students
will enroll in the equivalent of
fifteen units of Stanford work.
Included in this will be a daily
class taught by Gicovate and
his assistant. All other courses
will be regular courses offered
by the Univresity of Madrid.

The students will be enrolled
in Madrid's school of philosophy
and letters, which, according to
Gicovate, is much like graduate
level instruction here.
Instruction at Madrid begins
in September, as in the United
States, but because the Stan
ford group will leave in March
they will not complete their
courses. Examinations will be
given and they will be graded on
work completed.
There are currently about
4,000 American students study
ing in Spain, according to
Gicovate. Some 400 of these
are from New York Univers
ity.

"New York has a large pro
gram for its students in Spain,"
he said, "but we hope our stu
dents will become better inte
grated in Spanish culture."
Although the members of
Group I have already been sel
ected, there is a "slight possi
bility for the consideration of
more alternates," said Gicovate.
The program is not restricted
to Spanish majors but is open
to others in the fields of human
ities and social sciences who
have completed 30 units of Span
ish and who can benefit from
study in Spain. Juniors, seniors
and specially selected graduate
students may apply.
