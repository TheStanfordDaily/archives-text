# University Statement
## 
### 
Drug abuse has become an acute and much-debated prob
lem throughout society. There Is widespread concern over pos
sible damage to health of individuals, and also over the dam
age done to the careers and the individual happiness of those
who incur the penalties imposed by the laws regulating drugs.
Such concerns exist at Stanford as elsewhere. This statement
is intended to answer questions which have arisen about the
Unlvrslty's policy concerning the illegal possession, distri
bution, and use o fdrugs on the Stanford campus.
Stanford recognizes its duty to treat problems of drug use
responsibly and in such a manner as to safeguard to the
greatest possible extent its capacity to carry out its educa
tional mission. Consequently, while discipline is certainly
the appropriate response under some circumstances, the Uni
versity's interest must go beyond a disciplinary response to
the problem. Thus, the University will continue to provide
educational and informational programs about drugs, and will
encourage use of counseling services provided on a confi
dential basis by the Health Service and other appropriate
agencies.
Further, while the University is not a law enforcement
agency, it is unequivocally committed to respect for law and
its orderly modification through the democratic process. It
follows that University explicitly refuses to act as a sanc
tuary from enforcement of the drug laws by those agencies
who have that responsibility. Moreover, the University will
take whatever steps, Including disciplinary action, may be
required to safeguard the campus against drug abuse.
