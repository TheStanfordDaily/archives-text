# LSD: Likely Cause Of Genetic Defects?
## 
### 
A young woman took LSD
"for kicks" and later discovered
that she was pregnant before
she took the drug. Is her baby
In danger?
That question is a growing
source of worry to the medical
profession and to many young
mothers-to-be. Some specialists
think the danger applies to use
of LSD before pregnancy.
At least three major studies
of such women are planned or
under way, in New York, Wash
ington, and the West Coast, in
efforts to find the answers. Al
ready some of the results have
been disturbing, but they are
far from conclusive.
Scientists at New York Uni
versity , Medical Center and
Mount Sinai Center in
Brooklyn, New York, have just
done a study of about 20
mothers and their children.
Half of the children and
about three-quarters of their
mothers were found to have
damaged or rearranged chromo
somes in their white blood cells.
The chromosomes are the
tiny strands of genetic material
in every living cell that tell
each new generation of cells
what to become and what to
do. Breaks or rearrangements
in the chromosomes can some
times be hints of severe danger.
It was the effects on the
chromosomes of animals and
man that first drew scientists'
attention to the possible genetic

dangers of LSD.
Since then there have been
a few reports of birth defects
in children whose mothers had
taken LSD during pregnancy.
Dr. Kur,t Hirschhorn, chief of
the division of medical genetics
at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine, said he knew of five
such cases altogether.
In the study he and Dr.
William A. Frosch of N.Y.U.
made of roughly 20 women and
their children, one child seemed
to show some retardiation in
mental development.
About one child among every
50 born alive in the United
States has some major develop
mental defect. Therefore, it is
hard to prove that LSD is to
blame in any single case, par
ticularly if the study began
after, the child was born.


MAYBECK HOUSE â€” This house was designed and built in San Jose in 1904 by famed architect
Bernard R. Maybeck. "Maybeck and His Bay Area Contemporaries" is the subject of a lecture Pro
fessor Kenneth Cardwell will present tonight at 8:00 p.m. in Room 100 of the Physics Tank as part of
the Wednesday Night Art Lecture Series. Cardwell is vice-chairman of Berkeley's Department of Ar
chitecture.
