# In State Colleges
## Speaker Ban Laws Proposed 
### College Press Service 
Public colleges and universi
ties in two traditionally conser
vative states apparently have
temporarily escaped the re
strictions of speaker ban laws,
but in both states the threat for
the future still exists.
In Kentucky, state legislators
appear to have dropped plans
to introduce a speaker ban law
to keep Communist Herbert
Aptheker from making a sche
duled speech at the University
of Kentucky. Two legislators
also have decided not to intro
duce a resolution in the state's
General Assembly to prohibit
a conference on the war and the
draft from being held on the Uni
versity campus.
In New Mexico, a speaker ban
controversy apparently has sub
sided temporarily because Black
Power advocate Stokely Car
michael canceled a scheduled ap
pearance at the University of
New Mexico. But some New
Mexico state legislators are still
demanding that the university
regents pass on the acceptabi
lity of all speakers before they
are invited to the campus.
In both states, the exercise of
academic freedom on college
campuses frequently has been
challenged by conservative citi
zens and state legislators.
Speaker ban laws have been
introduced in the Kentucky Gen
eral Assembly several times pre
viously, but have never had the
backing of a governor and have
never reached the floor of eith
er house for a vote. Now, how
ever, Kentucky has a conserva
tive governor, Louis Nunn, who
made it known in his campaign
last fall that he favors restric

tions on certain speakers on uni
versity campuses.
During the recent controversy,
however. Gov. Nunn indicated
he would not support speaker
ban legislation because "no legi
slation is needed" to control
speakers. "All we need," the gov
ernor said, "is a board of trus
tees (at state colleges) that are
willing to say who will speak
and who won't." The governor,
by law, is chairman of the UK
board.
University of Kentucky Presi
dent John W. Oswald played a
major, role in persuading legisla
tors not to support speaker ban
legislation or to introduce a res
olution asking the board of trus
tees not to allow the conference
on the war and the draft to be
held on the campus.
Oswald apparently swayed
legislators by announcing a pol
icy that all speeches and confer
ences on campus must be rele
vant to the educational function
of the university and must be
orderly and not interfere with
the proper functioning of the
university.
But Oswald strongly defended
the right of free speech, saying,
"Universities exist to promote in
a responsible manner the free
and open discussion of ideas

however controversial they may
be."
Several Kentucky professors
have said they will resign if
speaker ban legislation is en
acted by the legislature. Others
have said they would fight a
speaker ban law in the courts.
In New Mexico, the speaker
ban controversy has dropped out
of the spotlight since Carmichael
canceled his speech, but the is
sue is far from being dead. Be
fore the speech was called off,
both houses of the state legisla
ture passed resolutions expres
sing regret that Carmichael was
to appear on the campus. The
house resolution recommended
that the New Mexico Regents
screen suggested speakers in the
future before students are al
lowed to invite them to campus.
University of New Mexico
President Tom L. Pope joy
strongly supported the students'
right to invite Carmichael to
speak. "If it is legal and appro
priate for the newspapers and
television and radio stations to
present Mr. Carmichael on the
basis of freedom of the press, I
believe it is legal and appropri
ate for the students to present
Mr. Carmichael on the basis of
freedom of speech," he said in a
statement.

Some university officials still
fear the violent wave of opposi
tion to Carmichael's speech will
adversely affect the university,
either in the form of a perman
ent speaker ban regulation or, in
terms of state allocations to New
Mexico's institutions of higher
education.
The controversy may be inten
sified because this is an election
year in New Mexico. The state's
only announced candidate for
governor, Rep. Bobby Mayfleld,
was against the Carmichael
speech and even offered to pay
Carmichael's $1,500 fee if the
Speakers Committee would can
cel the engagement.

University of Kentucky Presi

major, role in persuading legisla

held on the campus.
Oswald apparently swayed
legislators by announcing a pol

of the university and must be
orderly and not interfere with
the proper functioning of the
university.

the right of free speech, saying,
"Universities exist to promote in

In New Mexico, the speaker

canceled his speech, but the is
sue is far from being dead. Be
fore the speech was called off,
both houses of the state legisla

sing regret that Carmichael was
to appear on the campus. The
house resolution recommended
that the New Mexico Regents
screen suggested speakers in the
future before students are al
lowed to invite them to campus.
University of New Mexico
President Tom L. Pope joy
strongly supported the students'
right to invite Carmichael to
speak. "If it is legal and appro
priate for the newspapers and
television and radio stations to
present Mr. Carmichael on the
basis of freedom of the press, I
believe it is legal and appropri
ate for the students to present
Mr. Carmichael on the basis of
freedom of speech," he said in a

Some university officials still
fear the violent wave of opposi
tion to Carmichael's speech will
adversely affect the university,
either in the form of a perman
ent speaker ban regulation or, in
terms of state allocations to New
Mexico's institutions of higher
education.
The controversy may be inten
sified because this is an election
year in New Mexico. The state's
only announced candidate for
governor, Rep. Bobby Mayfleld,
was against the Carmichael
speech and even offered to pay
Carmichael's $1,500 fee if the
Speakers Committee would can

Public colleges and universi

In Kentucky, state legislators
appear to have dropped plans
to introduce a speaker ban law
to keep Communist Herbert
Aptheker from making a sche

General Assembly to prohibit
a conference on the war and the

In New Mexico, a speaker ban
controversy apparently has sub

priate for the newspapers and
television and radio stations to
present Mr. Carmichael on the
basis of freedom of the press, I
believe it is legal and appropri
ate for the students to present
Mr. Carmichael on the basis of
freedom of speech," he said in a
statement.

Some university officials still
fear the violent wave of opposi
tion to Carmichael's speech will
adversely affect the university,
either in the form of a perman
ent speaker ban regulation or, in
terms of state allocations to New
Mexico's institutions of higher
education.
The controversy may be inten
sified because this is an election
year in New Mexico. The state's
only announced candidate for
governor, Rep. Bobby Mayfleld,
was against the Carmichael
speech and even offered to pay
Carmichael's $1,500 fee if the
Speakers Committee would can
cel the engagement.
