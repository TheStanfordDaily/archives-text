# Central Federal Computer Seen As A Threat To Privacy
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” "What
ever privacy remains for the
American citizen, it remains be
cause the federal government is
presently too inefficient to pull
all its personel information files
together."
This statement, made by the
head of a congressional subcom
mittee, Sen. Edward V. Long,
D-Mo., contains a critically im
portant word: presently.
The fact is that this inefficien
cy can be eliminated almost
immediately by the electronic
computer, a tool made precisely
for this job of gathering, proc
essing, interrelating, comparing
and retreiving files.
And, as might be expected,
pressure inevitably continues
for the federal government to
apply this computer tool to the
job, to create a federal data
bank from which could be

drawn personal information on
citizens by the mere tap of a
finger on a console button.
The information on personal
history so retrieved from the
millions of Social Security, po
lice, FBI, military and income
tax files would be used by busi
ness, government and the pro
fessions ostensibly to serve
man.
In the view of critics, the elec
tronic computer's hunger for
facts, its almost unlimited abili
ty to regurgitate these facts for
an endless number of uses, and
its amorality, have now brought
it to a confrontation with man,
its creator.
At the University of Chicago
conference on privacy recently
this issue of personal rights in a
world of computers became the
central concern.
Prof. Arthur Miller of the Uni

versity of Michigan illustrated
at least one of the many dilem
ma's involved by reminding his
audience that the Freedom of
Information Act was passed "in
furtherance of the public's right
to know..
However, he continued, this
right also could be a danger. It
of a great deal of information
may, he said, force "disclosure
that originally was given the
government with the under
standing that it would be kept
confidential, and a considerable
amount of personal data that
many a sensitive citizen would
consider private."
This information is, of course,
available right at the moment
without a central computer set
up. But the danger, as many see
it, is that the centralization of
this information and its retriev
al in seconds, may be an excuse
for thereby using it.
