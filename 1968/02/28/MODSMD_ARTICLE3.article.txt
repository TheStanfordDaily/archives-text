# New Draw Plan Proposed For University Housing
## 
### NICHOLAS SELBY 
The Deain of Students office
last night released to 40 house
presidents a tentative outline
for a new draw system which
would solve assignment prob
lems for a new residence config
uration next fall.
The system, to be operated by
the Undergraduate Housing of
fice, would:
• A llow students to take part
in the- draw without first agree
ing to* give up their present resi
dence, which the old women's
draw required them to do.
• A.llow students to remain
in their present residence unless

they were able to move to a resi
dence they preferred. Students,
however, listing another location
above their, present residence
would have to accept that loca
tion if assigned there.
• Allow a student displaced
by a change within the makeup
of his present residence to take
part in a special, early draw and
be sure of a space within a resi
dence with a program similar
to the one he was forced from.
For example, a woman forced
to move from a Lagunita casa
by a new coed program there
would be assured of a space
in another casa filled solely by
women. After the preliminary
draw is completed, students
would be able to remain in their
present residence or to take
part in the regular draw.
The new draw system would
also allow students to draw as
individuals, in pair,s, or in groups
of three. Students would be able
to list joint preferences first and
individual preferences.
There would be a special, ear
ly draw for women wishing to
live off-campus or in Hoskins
House. Assistant Dean Doug
Davis repeated that the Dean's
office was not sure what the uni
versity's policy on "off" would
be next year.
A single working proposal for
the housing configuration next
fall was not discussed, although
earlier plans indicated it might
be. Assistant Dean Sally Ma
honey stated students needed
more details on the draw system

to allow the m to look objective
ly on any plans which might
force them to n iove. She also
indicated p 'roble 1 ms concerning
freshman i ntegr ation and loca
tion of fre. ( shma) ,i residences.
Beturnii ig overseas campus
students a vould i have first pri
ority for the residence they
lived in 1 jefor e leaving if no
other qua rter than summer in
tervened befo ire their return
and Autumn c (uarter. To be as
sured of on-i >ainpus housing,
they wo uld j merely list "any
Universi' tyre sidcnce" as one of
their ho using preferences.
Studen' ts o> /erseas this spring
will have the opportunity to par
ticipate in all draws which apply
to them.
Studer its p iresently within Uni
versity ( iper ated residences who
wish tc i si lift their residence
would have second priority,
while fi -ate rnity and off-campus
student s would have last prior
ity.
Eatir lg club members, both
men ai nd 1 women, would receive
first p irioi -ity for, space within
Toyon Ha 11.
Prio riti> as for those wishing to
retain or gain a bed on campus
will r em* iin as presently consti
tuted. Freshman representatives
at the ; mi jeting, however, angrily
point- ?d < >ut that these priorities
favor up iperclassmen, and asked
for, a ire "vision.
Da vis stated that these pri
ority ?s \ vere under consideration
by t he Study of Education at
Stan for d (SES), and would be

discussed at next Tuesday's
meeting of house presidents.
They would, probably hi
April draw a number to deter
mine in what order their pref
erences will be considered, and
would fill out a preference
card, listing both categories
and individual choices within
a category, (say Paloma House
within Florence Moore Hall)
and a contact card.
Prior to the draw every stu
dent must indicate if he will re
main in his present residence
unit, take part in the draw, or
leave the university housing sys
tem.
A computer would, in effect,
start with the preferences of the
student ranked first, satisfy
his preference, and open a va
cancy in the spot he leaves. The
computer would continue
through the rankings, satisfying
as many preferences as possible.
Rod Levine of the housing of
fice stressed that present plans
will probably allow 90-95 per
cent of the first choices to be
satisfied.
Students will be able to check
what residence space is open to
them through week-by-week list
ings released by the housing of
fice. The computer would then
continue through June 1 to try
to solve as many first prefer
ences as possible, thereby allow
ing a student to move closer to
his first choice week by week.
Students would have to pay a
housing deposit within five days
after notice of assignment.

members who looked on. Plans are under way for a tournament for an all-eating club championship.
The Deain of Students office
last night released to 40 house
presidents a tentative outline
for a new draw system which
would solve assignment prob
lems for a new residence config
uration next fall.
The system, to be operated by
the Undergraduate Housing of
fice, would:
• A llow students to take part
in the- draw without first agree
ing to* give up their present resi
dence, which the old women's
draw required them to do.
• A.llow students to remain
in their present residence unless

they were able to move to a resi
dence they preferred. Students,
however, listing another location
above their, present residence
would have to accept that loca
tion if assigned there.
• Allow a student displaced
by a change within the makeup
of his present residence to take
part in a special, early draw and
be sure of a space within a resi
dence with a program similar
to the one he was forced from.
For example, a woman forced
to move from a Lagunita casa
by a new coed program there
would be assured of a space
in another casa filled solely by
women. After the preliminary
draw is completed, students
would be able to remain in their
present residence or to take
part in the regular draw.
The new draw system would
also allow students to draw as
individuals, in pair,s, or in groups
of three. Students would be able
to list joint preferences first and
individual preferences.
There would be a special, ear
ly draw for women wishing to
live off-campus or in Hoskins
House. Assistant Dean Doug
Davis repeated that the Dean's
office was not sure what the uni
versity's policy on "off" would
be next year.
A single working proposal for
the housing configuration next
fall was not discussed, although
earlier plans indicated it might
be. Assistant Dean Sally Ma
honey stated students needed
more details on the draw system

to allow the m to look objective
ly on any plans which might
force them to n iove. She also
indicated p 'roble 1 ms concerning
freshman i ntegr ation and loca
tion of fre. ( shma) ,i residences.
Beturnii ig overseas campus
students a vould i have first pri
ority for the residence they
lived in 1 jefor e leaving if no
other qua rter than summer in
tervened befo ire their return
and Autumn c (uarter. To be as
sured of on-i >ainpus housing,
they wo uld j merely list "any
Universi' tyre sidcnce" as one of
their ho using preferences.
Studen' ts o> /erseas this spring
will have the opportunity to par
ticipate in all draws which apply
to them.
Studer its p iresently within Uni
versity ( iper ated residences who
wish tc i si lift their residence
would have second priority,
while fi -ate rnity and off-campus
student s would have last prior
ity.
Eatir lg club members, both
men ai nd 1 women, would receive
first p irioi -ity for, space within
Toyon Ha 11.
Prio riti> as for those wishing to
retain or gain a bed on campus
will r em* iin as presently consti
tuted. Freshman representatives
at the ; mi jeting, however, angrily
point- ?d < >ut that these priorities
favor up iperclassmen, and asked
for, a ire "vision.
Da vis stated that these pri
ority ?s \ vere under consideration
by t he Study of Education at
Stan for d (SES), and would be

discussed at next Tuesday's
meeting of house presidents.
They would, probably hi
April draw a number to deter
mine in what order their pref
erences will be considered, and
would fill out a preference
card, listing both categories
and individual choices within
a category, (say Paloma House
within Florence Moore Hall)
and a contact card.
Prior to the draw every stu
dent must indicate if he will re
main in his present residence
unit, take part in the draw, or
leave the university housing sys
tem.
A computer would, in effect,
start with the preferences of the
student ranked first, satisfy
his preference, and open a va
cancy in the spot he leaves. The
computer would continue
through the rankings, satisfying
as many preferences as possible.
Rod Levine of the housing of
fice stressed that present plans
will probably allow 90-95 per
cent of the first choices to be
satisfied.
Students will be able to check
what residence space is open to
them through week-by-week list
ings released by the housing of
fice. The computer would then
continue through June 1 to try
to solve as many first prefer
ences as possible, thereby allow
ing a student to move closer to
his first choice week by week.
Students would have to pay a
housing deposit within five days
after notice of assignment.

HUSTLING — Steve Ross makes one of the shots which helped him defeat Bruce Malfalt In a cru

members who looked on. Plans are under way for a tournament for an all-eating club championship.
The Deain of Students office
last night released to 40 house
presidents a tentative outline
for a new draw system which
would solve assignment prob
lems for a new residence config
uration next fall.
The system, to be operated by
the Undergraduate Housing of
fice, would:
• A llow students to take part
in the- draw without first agree
ing to* give up their present resi
dence, which the old women's
draw required them to do.
• A.llow students to remain
in their present residence unless

they were able to move to a resi
dence they preferred. Students,
however, listing another location
above their, present residence
would have to accept that loca
tion if assigned there.
• Allow a student displaced
by a change within the makeup
of his present residence to take
part in a special, early draw and
be sure of a space within a resi
dence with a program similar
to the one he was forced from.
For example, a woman forced
to move from a Lagunita casa
by a new coed program there
would be assured of a space
in another casa filled solely by
women. After the preliminary
draw is completed, students
would be able to remain in their
present residence or to take
part in the regular draw.
The new draw system would
also allow students to draw as
individuals, in pair,s, or in groups
of three. Students would be able
to list joint preferences first and
individual preferences.
There would be a special, ear
ly draw for women wishing to
live off-campus or in Hoskins
House. Assistant Dean Doug
Davis repeated that the Dean's
office was not sure what the uni
versity's policy on "off" would
be next year.
A single working proposal for
the housing configuration next
fall was not discussed, although
earlier plans indicated it might
be. Assistant Dean Sally Ma
honey stated students needed
more details on the draw system

to allow the m to look objective
ly on any plans which might
force them to n iove. She also
indicated p 'roble 1 ms concerning
freshman i ntegr ation and loca
tion of fre. ( shma) ,i residences.
Beturnii ig overseas campus
students a vould i have first pri
ority for the residence they
lived in 1 jefor e leaving if no
other qua rter than summer in
tervened befo ire their return
and Autumn c (uarter. To be as
sured of on-i >ainpus housing,
they wo uld j merely list "any
Universi' tyre sidcnce" as one of
their ho using preferences.
Studen' ts o> /erseas this spring
will have the opportunity to par
ticipate in all draws which apply
to them.
Studer its p iresently within Uni
versity ( iper ated residences who
wish tc i si lift their residence
would have second priority,
while fi -ate rnity and off-campus
student s would have last prior
ity.
Eatir lg club members, both
men ai nd 1 women, would receive
first p irioi -ity for, space within
Toyon Ha 11.
Prio riti> as for those wishing to
retain or gain a bed on campus
will r em* iin as presently consti
tuted. Freshman representatives
at the ; mi jeting, however, angrily
point- ?d < >ut that these priorities
favor up iperclassmen, and asked
for, a ire "vision.
Da vis stated that these pri
ority ?s \ vere under consideration
by t he Study of Education at
Stan for d (SES), and would be

discussed at next Tuesday's
meeting of house presidents.
They would, probably hi
April draw a number to deter
mine in what order their pref
erences will be considered, and
would fill out a preference
card, listing both categories
and individual choices within
a category, (say Paloma House
within Florence Moore Hall)
and a contact card.
Prior to the draw every stu
dent must indicate if he will re
main in his present residence
unit, take part in the draw, or
leave the university housing sys
tem.
A computer would, in effect,
start with the preferences of the
student ranked first, satisfy
his preference, and open a va
cancy in the spot he leaves. The
computer would continue
through the rankings, satisfying
as many preferences as possible.
Rod Levine of the housing of
fice stressed that present plans
will probably allow 90-95 per
cent of the first choices to be
satisfied.
Students will be able to check
what residence space is open to
them through week-by-week list
ings released by the housing of
fice. The computer would then
continue through June 1 to try
to solve as many first prefer
ences as possible, thereby allow
ing a student to move closer to
his first choice week by week.
Students would have to pay a
housing deposit within five days
after notice of assignment.
