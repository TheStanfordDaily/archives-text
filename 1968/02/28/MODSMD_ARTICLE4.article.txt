tanks and a half-tracked ar
mored personnel carrier had
been spotted near the Cambo

of the city in the deepest such
armored penetration of the war.
A company of about 100 U.S.-

up one of the vehicles with anti
tank rockets, killing 30 of the
enemy in the explosion.

group not as tanks and a per
sonnel carrier, but as "armored
vehicles of an unspecified type"
pending further information
from the field. Previously the
presence of enemy tanks in the
country had been confirmed
only in the northwest near the
U.S. Marine base at Khe Sanh.

• LBJ Asks Crop Bill
WASHINGTON (AP)—Presi
dent Johnson asked Congress
Tuesday to make permanent
this year his administration's
multibillion dollar crop control
program, but he immediately
ran into a strong and influential
"no" on Capitol Hill.
Chairman Allen J. Ellender,
D-La., of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, told newsmen there
is "not a chance" that Congress
will act on the legislation this
session. He added that Congress
would never make it perma
nent.
Johnson, in an election year
farm message decrying farm
ers' lagging income, declared
that failure to extend this pro
gram would bring "catastrophe
and ruin" to many farmers. The
program, enacted in 1965, is
now scheduled to expire in 1969.
Under this program, which
Johnson described as the back
bone of present federal farm aid
measures, the government has
been making payments running
upwards of $3 billion a year to
farmers for idling land.

• Hue Left Leaderless
HUE, Vietnam (AP) — When
Communist forces virtually
overran Hue four weeks ago the
city's official structure vanished
like a punctured soap bubble.
The conduct of the city's offi
cialdom was the despair of
American advisers as Hue was
slowly freed.
"They are leaderless and gut
less," one harried American ex
ploded after a day of frustra
tions.
More than 1,000 soldiers were
on leave in the old imperial city
when it was overrun. Most of
them wound up in the central
refugee camp at Hue Universi
ty. Not for 21 days did anyone
try to organize them into an ef
fective force.
"A full colonel walked out of
there," an American official re
ported. "He hadn't done a damn
thing but hide for three weeks."

• USSR-Romania Split
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)—
A meeting of 66 Communist
parties got off to a rocky start
Tuesday. The Soviet Union and
Romonia were widely split over
how and when to hold a world
conference meant by Moscow to
restore Soviet-led unity to the
Red movement.
Soviet ideologist Mikhail A.
Suslov was said to have told the
delegates in closed session that
a world Communist conference
should be held in November. He
was supported by Gus Hall of
the United States.
Paul Niculescu-Mizil of Roma
nia argued that the conference
should not be held unless all
parties agreed to attend. That,
in effect, would delay the
conference indefinitely.
