## 'Big Dish' Explores Space 
### CONNIE COLLIER 
The "big dish" broods enig
matically over the Stanford
campus, and the research it
makes possible may be fraught
with meaning for mankind.
When the planet Venus came
between the Mariner V space
craft and the earth October 19,
man came a step closr to know
ing whether or not there is life
on another planet, and perhaps
even where and how life origi
nated.
Experimenters had been
awaiting this event, of only 50

minutes' duration, for five
months, since Mariner V was
launched.
Such research is centered at
Stanford's "big dish," that is,
the Center for Radar Astron
omy's 150 - foot bowl • shaped
radar antenna, which domi
nates the foothills behind the
University. Jointly supervised
by Stanford and Stanford Re
search Institute (SRI), the re
search is sponsored by the
National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NA
SA).

Radio waves were transmit
ted by the computer-driven dish
to the spacecraft's receiver.
They were then sent back with
the data the craft had collected
to Deep Space Network Stations
at Johannesburg, South Africa;
Canberra, Australia; and Gold
stone, California. From these
stations the results were re
layed to Stanford, where they
were analyzed by computers.
Thus, during the 50 minutes
when Venus came between Mar
iner V and the earth, Stanford's
radar signals passed directly

through that planet's atmos
phere. Signals recorded by the
craft's receiver showed the
changes caused by their jour
ney through space.
Since the spacecraft is not
scheduled to return to this posi
tion for 11 years, careful prepa
rations were made for the Mar
iner experiment. Neighboring
residential areas were tempora
riily switched to a different
power circuit as a precaution
against equipment failure, but
no complications were encoun
tered.
Analysis of the data has
shown that Venus has a dense
atmosphere, which would cause
rays hitting it to be bont. "Light,
then, would travel a'ong these
paths and would be trapped so
that all light leaving the surface
at angles less than a fow de
grees would curve around the
planet and never go out into
space.
This phenomenon would en
able a person —If he could
survive the 500° F. surface
temperature—to see all around
the planet. In other words,
while a ship going ouit to sea
on Earth sinks below the ho
rizon, on Venus it would ap
pear to rise up as it sailed
away.
As a result of this rising hori
zon, the visitor would feel that
he was in a hole. Everywhere he
went would seem to bo at the
bottom of a depression, and as
he moved, the depression would
move with him.
A "magnetic pileup" was also
