## 'Big Dish' Explores Space 
### CONNIE COLLIER 
The "big dish" broods enig
matically over the Stanford
campus, and the research it
makes possible may be fraught
with meaning for mankind.
When the planet Venus came
between the Mariner V space
craft and the earth October 19,
man came a step closr to know
ing whether or not there is life
on another planet, and perhaps
even where and how life origi
nated.
Experimenters had been
awaiting this event, of only 50

minutes' duration, for five
months, since Mariner V was
launched.
Such research is centered at
Stanford's "big dish," that is,
the Center for Radar Astron
omy's 150 - foot bowl • shaped
radar antenna, which domi
nates the foothills behind the
University. Jointly supervised
by Stanford and Stanford Re
search Institute (SRI), the re
search is sponsored by the
National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NA
SA).

Radio waves were transmit
ted by the computer-driven dish
to the spacecraft's receiver.
They were then sent back with
the data the craft had collected
to Deep Space Network Stations
at Johannesburg, South Africa;
Canberra, Australia; and Gold
stone, California. From these
stations the results were re
layed to Stanford, where they
were analyzed by computers.
Thus, during the 50 minutes
when Venus came between Mar
iner V and the earth, Stanford's
radar signals passed directly

through that planet's atmos
phere. Signals recorded by the
craft's receiver showed the
changes caused by their jour
ney through space.
Since the spacecraft is not
scheduled to return to this posi
tion for 11 years, careful prepa
rations were made for the Mar
iner experiment. Neighboring
residential areas were tempora
riily switched to a different
power circuit as a precaution
against equipment failure, but
no complications were encoun
tered.
Analysis of the data has
shown that Venus has a dense
atmosphere, which would cause
rays hitting it to be bont. "Light,
then, would travel a'ong these
paths and would be trapped so
that all light leaving the surface
at angles less than a fow de
grees would curve around the
planet and never go out into
space.
This phenomenon would en
able a person —If he could
survive the 500° F. surface
temperature—to see all around
the planet. In other words,
while a ship going ouit to sea
on Earth sinks below the ho
rizon, on Venus it would ap
pear to rise up as it sailed
away.
As a result of this rising hori
zon, the visitor would feel that
he was in a hole. Everywhere he
went would seem to bo at the
bottom of a depression, and as
he moved, the depression would
move with him.
A "magnetic pileup" was also
discovered on the planet's night
side, so that Venus's atmos
phere extends three times far
ther into space on that side than
on its day side. By contrast, the
earth's ionosphere extends to an
equal distance on both sides.
Professor Von R. Eshelman,
director of the Mariner experi
ment, said that the discoveries
made "may be of fundamental
importance in continuing efforts
toward understanding the differ
ence between the evolution of
the atmospheres of the Earth
and of Venus over the past bil
lions of years, where these dif
ferences may be related to the
reasons we are here instead of
there."
The dish is now being used to
explore the solar system — for
the fourth time—in connection
with the Pioneer 8 spacecraft.
Comprised of SRI and Stanford
engineers and aided by 15 grad
uate students, the research
team has as its objective space
weather forecasting.
The Center began as a
group of electrical engineers
who started tracking meteors,
who then moved on to obser
vations of the sun and moon.
Eight years ago the dish was
built and the Stanford Center
for Radar Astronomy was in
stituted. A division of the De
partment of Electrical Engi
neering, its members are all
electrical engineers.
Pioneer 8 was launched into
orbit around the sun December

13 with a special receiver built
by SRI aboard. It will receive
different radar signals from
Stanford's dish. Changes in the
known timing and phasing of
the two signals, caused by their
passage through particles pres
ent in the solar system, will be
recorded by the receiver.
As with the Mariner V, this
record will then be sent from
the spacecraft to the Deep
Space Network stations, will
then be relayed back to Stan
ford and computer analyzed.
This process takes a total of 15
minutes and 12 seconds — IVz
minutes from Stanford to Pio
neer 8, IVz minutes from there
to the space network station,
and 12 seconds from there to
the Stanford computer's tele
type.
Analysis of the data told the
Stanford group that interplane
tary space averages 5.5 elec
trons per cubic centimeter.
They also discovered that dur
ing solar storms when great
tongues of flame lick out from
the sun sending hot blasts of
particles through space, the
electron density jumps to 30-40
per cubic centimeter.
This phenomenon is Impor
tant particularly in regard to
spacecraft functioning. lon
ized particles degrade a space
craft's solar cells, causing
power output to drop; conse
quently, scientists must be
able to predict how much
weight will be needed for
shielding a spacecraft against
these particles.

Pioneer 8 was launched into
orbit around the sun December

13 with a special receiver built
by SRI aboard. It will receive
different radar signals from
Stanford's dish. Changes in the
known timing and phasing of
the two signals, caused by their
passage through particles pres
ent in the solar system, will be
recorded by the receiver.
As with the Mariner V, this
record will then be sent from
the spacecraft to the Deep

then be relayed back to Stan
ford and computer analyzed.
This process takes a total of 15

type.
Analysis of the data told the
Stanford group that interplane
tary space averages 5.5 elec

They also discovered that dur
ing solar storms when great
tongues of flame lick out from
the sun sending hot blasts of
particles through space, the
electron density jumps to 30-40

When the planet Venus came
between the Mariner V space
craft and the earth October 19,
man came a step closr to know
ing whether or not there is life
on another planet, and perhaps
even where and how life origi
nated.
Experimenters had been
awaiting this event, of only 50

minutes' duration, for five
months, since Mariner V was
launched.
Such research is centered at
Stanford's "big dish," that is,
the Center for Radar Astron
omy's 150 - foot bowl • shaped
radar antenna, which domi
nates the foothills behind the
University. Jointly supervised
by Stanford and Stanford Re
search Institute (SRI), the re
search is sponsored by the
National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NA
SA).

Radio waves were transmit
ted by the computer-driven dish
to the spacecraft's receiver.
They were then sent back with
the data the craft had collected
to Deep Space Network Stations
at Johannesburg, South Africa;
Canberra, Australia; and Gold
stone, California. From these
stations the results were re
layed to Stanford, where they
were analyzed by computers.
Thus, during the 50 minutes
when Venus came between Mar
iner V and the earth, Stanford's
radar signals passed directly

through that planet's atmos
phere. Signals recorded by the
craft's receiver showed the
changes caused by their jour
ney through space.
Since the spacecraft is not
scheduled to return to this posi
tion for 11 years, careful prepa
rations were made for the Mar
iner experiment. Neighboring
residential areas were tempora
riily switched to a different
power circuit as a precaution
against equipment failure, but
no complications were encoun
tered.
Analysis of the data has
shown that Venus has a dense
atmosphere, which would cause
rays hitting it to be bont. "Light,
then, would travel a'ong these
paths and would be trapped so
that all light leaving the surface
at angles less than a fow de
grees would curve around the
planet and never go out into
space.
This phenomenon would en
able a person —If he could
survive the 500° F. surface
temperature—to see all around
the planet. In other words,
while a ship going ouit to sea
on Earth sinks below the ho
rizon, on Venus it would ap
pear to rise up as it sailed
away.
As a result of this rising hori
zon, the visitor would feel that
he was in a hole. Everywhere he
went would seem to bo at the
bottom of a depression, and as
he moved, the depression would
move with him.
A "magnetic pileup" was also
discovered on the planet's night
side, so that Venus's atmos
phere extends three times far
ther into space on that side than
on its day side. By contrast, the
earth's ionosphere extends to an
equal distance on both sides.
Professor Von R. Eshelman,
director of the Mariner experi
ment, said that the discoveries
made "may be of fundamental
importance in continuing efforts
toward understanding the differ
ence between the evolution of
the atmospheres of the Earth
and of Venus over the past bil
lions of years, where these dif
ferences may be related to the
reasons we are here instead of
there."

Analysis of the data has
shown that Venus has a dense
atmosphere, which would cause
rays hitting it to be bont. "Light,
then, would travel a'ong these
paths and would be trapped so
that all light leaving the surface
at angles less than a fow de
grees would curve around the
planet and never go out into
space.
This phenomenon would en
able a person —If he could
survive the 500° F. surface
temperature—to see all around
the planet. In other words,
while a ship going ouit to sea
on Earth sinks below the ho
rizon, on Venus it would ap
pear to rise up as it sailed
away.
As a result of this rising hori
zon, the visitor would feel that
he was in a hole. Everywhere he
went would seem to bo at the
bottom of a depression, and as
he moved, the depression would
move with him.
A "magnetic pileup" was also
discovered on the planet's night
side, so that Venus's atmos
phere extends three times far
ther into space on that side than
on its day side. By contrast, the
earth's ionosphere extends to an
equal distance on both sides.
Professor Von R. Eshelman,
director of the Mariner experi
ment, said that the discoveries
made "may be of fundamental
importance in continuing efforts
toward understanding the differ
ence between the evolution of
the atmospheres of the Earth
and of Venus over the past bil
lions of years, where these dif
ferences may be related to the
reasons we are here instead of
there."
The dish is now being used to
explore the solar system — for
the fourth time—in connection
with the Pioneer 8 spacecraft.
Comprised of SRI and Stanford
engineers and aided by 15 grad
uate students, the research
team has as its objective space
weather forecasting.
The Center began as a
group of electrical engineers
who started tracking meteors,
who then moved on to obser
vations of the sun and moon.
Eight years ago the dish was
built and the Stanford Center
for Radar Astronomy was in
stituted. A division of the De
partment of Electrical Engi
neering, its members are all
electrical engineers.
Pioneer 8 was launched into
orbit around the sun December

13 with a special receiver built
by SRI aboard. It will receive
different radar signals from
Stanford's dish. Changes in the
known timing and phasing of
the two signals, caused by their
passage through particles pres
ent in the solar system, will be
recorded by the receiver.
As with the Mariner V, this
record will then be sent from
the spacecraft to the Deep
Space Network stations, will
then be relayed back to Stan
ford and computer analyzed.
This process takes a total of 15
minutes and 12 seconds — IVz
minutes from Stanford to Pio
neer 8, IVz minutes from there
to the space network station,
and 12 seconds from there to
the Stanford computer's tele
type.
Analysis of the data told the
Stanford group that interplane
tary space averages 5.5 elec
trons per cubic centimeter.
They also discovered that dur
ing solar storms when great
tongues of flame lick out from
the sun sending hot blasts of
particles through space, the
electron density jumps to 30-40
per cubic centimeter.
This phenomenon is Impor
tant particularly in regard to
spacecraft functioning. lon
ized particles degrade a space
craft's solar cells, causing
power output to drop; conse
quently, scientists must be
able to predict how much
weight will be needed for
shielding a spacecraft against
these particles.
The "big dish" broods enig
matically over the Stanford
campus, and the research it
makes possible may be fraught
with meaning for mankind.
When the planet Venus came
between the Mariner V space
craft and the earth October 19,
man came a step closr to know
ing whether or not there is life
on another planet, and perhaps
even where and how life origi
nated.
Experimenters had been
awaiting this event, of only 50

minutes' duration, for five
months, since Mariner V was
launched.
Such research is centered at
Stanford's "big dish," that is,
the Center for Radar Astron
omy's 150 - foot bowl • shaped
radar antenna, which domi
nates the foothills behind the
University. Jointly supervised
by Stanford and Stanford Re
search Institute (SRI), the re
search is sponsored by the
National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NA
SA).

Radio waves were transmit
ted by the computer-driven dish
to the spacecraft's receiver.
They were then sent back with
the data the craft had collected
to Deep Space Network Stations
at Johannesburg, South Africa;
Canberra, Australia; and Gold
stone, California. From these
stations the results were re
layed to Stanford, where they
were analyzed by computers.
Thus, during the 50 minutes
when Venus came between Mar
iner V and the earth, Stanford's
radar signals passed directly

through that planet's atmos
phere. Signals recorded by the
craft's receiver showed the
changes caused by their jour
ney through space.
Since the spacecraft is not
scheduled to return to this posi
tion for 11 years, careful prepa
rations were made for the Mar
iner experiment. Neighboring
residential areas were tempora
riily switched to a different
power circuit as a precaution
against equipment failure, but
no complications were encoun
tered.
