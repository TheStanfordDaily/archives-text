# Peace And Freedom Party Seeks A Political Philosophy
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Peace and Freedom, the third
party which many political ob
servers thought wouldn't make
it on the ballot, is now attempt
ing to form a political philo
sophy to guide it through the
upcoming primary election in
June.
Last Monday's meeting of the
Stanford party touched on sev
eral problems currently facing
it.
Reese Erlich, an organizer of
Peace and Freedom who is cur
rently on a speaking tour of
the state, termed the third
party's existence a "great para
dox."
"Peace and Freedom has
neither the organizational com
petence nor the political con
sciousness that goes along with
a new party," he stressed.
What direction the party will
take on a statewide basis is
still largely undetermined. De

spite the need for some sort of
unified activity to influence Cali
fornia voting, the party remains,
"according to Erlich, a "series
of independent local parties."
He sees as another major
problem the division within the
party between the "radicals and
activists," who organized the
party, and the people who Er
lich feels have joined because
they "wanted to influence the
democratic system in some way."
Martin Primack, a San Jose
State College professor who is
considering running against Rep
resentative Charles Gubser (R-
Gilroy) as the Peace and Free
dom candidate, insists that the
party cannot base its attack on
gaining as many votes as pos
sible.
Now that Peace and Freedom
is "seriously involved in elector
al politics," he feels that the "en
tire range of politics must be
discussed."
As a result, Primack disagrees
with the other two approaches
which he claims are available
to people who have "feeling of
urgency about Vietnam and
about what is going to go on this
summer."
The first of these is the prag
matic approach that holds that
Peace and Freedom must have
"some candidate to win in some
way." Erlich also criticized this
approach which he feels would
make Peace and Freedom little

more than a "candidate commit
tee."
The second approach is that
of the "nonpolitical leftists" with
their, "action-oriented activists,"
such as the demonstrations at
Oakland to stop the draft.
In regard to Sen. McCarthy's
campaign, which some member's
of Peace and Freedom have sug
gested deserves party support
Erlich charged that it offers
no "significant alternatives."
In addition, Erlich feels that
it would "channel (Peace and
Freedom) right back into the
Democratic party."
Other Peace and Freedom
party members present Monday
even tended to disagree with
Erlich's statement that "a vast
majority of the people in Peace
and Freedom don't support Mc-
Carthy."
One lady suggested that such
support was a short-term effort.
"I think that the people work
ing for McCarthy on campus
will be long-term supports of
Peace and Freedom . . . , even
if McCarthy should win," she ex
plained.
Another McCarthy supporter
indicated that he had already
switched his registration back
to the Democratic party in order
to vote for McCarthy in the June
primary. While he stressed the
fact that McCarthy didn't seem
to be taking a real stand against
