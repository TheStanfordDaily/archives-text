# Romney Withdraws Candidacy, Refuses To Endorse Another
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)— Mich
igan Gov. George Romney,
whose candidacy never caught
fire, pulled out of the Republi
can presidential nomination
contest Wednesday to clear the
way for another moderate to op
pose Richard M. Nixon.
Romney told a crowded gath
ering of newsmen that "a criti
cal moment" had arrived at
which the dominantly progres
sive GOP governors should se
lect a candidate to support their
viewpoint.
Romney walked away from
a question as to which man he
would support. But Republi
can leaders agreed that his ac
tion had projected Gov. Nel
son A. Rockefeller of New
York toward a contest with
Nixon, former vice president
and the 1960 nominee.
From 16 to 18 of the Republi
can state executives, assem
bling here for a National Gover
nors Conference meeting begin
ning Thursday, have said that if
Romney faltered as the banner
carrying leader of the moder
ates they could support Rocke
feller.
Arriving for the governors'
conference, Rockefeller, insisted

in an interview his position as a
noncandidate had not been
changed by Romney's decision.
But he said he plans confer
ences with Republican gover
nors. He noted that the gover
nors "have stuck together."
While he said he is not a can
didate, the New York governor
said again, as he had Saturday
in Detroit, that he would accept
a draft. He said he had tried to
talk Romney out of withdraw
ing.
Romney had criticized Presi
dent Johnson's Vietnam war
policies, calling for neutraliza
tion of Southeast Asia. Nixon
has supported Johnson's basic
objective of fighting Communist
aggression there. Rockefeller
has given past support to the
President's course but has been
silent about Vietnam for months.
At the end of a disappoint
ing campaign trail that began
long before his formal an
nouncement last Nov. 18, Rom
ney said it was clear his can
didacy "has not won the wide
acceptance with rank-and-file
Republicans that I had hoped
to achieve."
Polls indicated he was the un
derdog in the March 12 New
Hampshire primary where his
name was on the ballot with
Nixon's. A write-in drive for
Rockefeller is under way there.
In the April 2 Wisconsin pri
mary, however, Nixon soems to
have a clear field, since Rocke
feller already has withdrawn his
name.
Romney told follow GOP gov
ernors in a letter that they
ought to work for a candidate
and a platform that would offer
"effective alternatives to for
eign and domestic programs
dealing with such major issues
as Vietnam, inflation, crime, in
dolence, delinquency, race and
power group politics."
The Michigan governor indi

cated he expects a quick deci
sion by the GOP state execu
tives. He scheduled a news
conference in Manchester, N.H.
Friday morning to announce his
support for a candidate they may
pick.
In his letter to his colleagues,
Romney pledged "I will support
wholeheartedly the candidate
for president to whom the Re
publican governors give their
support."
Sen. Hugh Scott, R-Pa., a
Romney supporter, said the
Michigan governor's decision
releases Rockefeller from his
pledge to support Romney.

"We who admire Gov. Rocke
feller look forward to his start
ing an active campaign for
president in the near future,"
said Scott, a former GOP na
tional chairman.
Sen. Thurston B. Morton, R-
Ky., another former national
chairman, said that if Republi
can governors swing their
weight behind Rockefeller, the
New York governor could win
the nomination even if Nixon
were successful in all of the pri
maries.
Sen. Charles H. Percy, R-ni.,
expected to be named as 111-
nois' favorite son, said he ex

pects Romney's withdrawal to
narrow the nomination contest
to a Nixon-Rockefeller affair.
Percy said he hasn't any
choice between the two at this
point but wants to assess their
position on the issues. Illinois'
58-vote delegation is expected to
give the bulk of its support to
Nixon if it follows the lead of
state organization chiefs.
Scott has told friends he
thinks nearly all of Pennsylva
nia's 64-vote delegation will turn
quickly to Rockefeller. The New
York delegation, headed by
Rockefeller, has 92 of the con
vention's 1,333 nominating votes.
The effect on the possible can
didacy of Gov. Ronald Reagan
of California, a favorite of con
servatives, was not immediately
clear.
Sen. George Murphy, R-Calif.,
chairman of the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Commit
tee, said that as of now he ac
cepts Reagan's statement that
he is not a serious contender.
"But I don't know what he
might decide in the future,"
Murphy said.
Sen. John G. Tower, expected
to be the favorite son of Texas'
56-vote delegation, praised Rom
ney and called for party "re
sponsibility and unity" in pick
ing a candidate to oppose Presi
dent Johnson. Tower is in
Nixon's corner.

WASHINGTON (AP)— Mich
igan Gov. George Romney,
whose candidacy never caught
fire, pulled out of the Republi
can presidential nomination
contest Wednesday to clear the
way for another moderate to op
pose Richard M. Nixon.
Romney told a crowded gath
ering of newsmen that "a criti
cal moment" had arrived at
which the dominantly progres
sive GOP governors should se
lect a candidate to support their
viewpoint.
Romney walked away from
a question as to which man he
would support. But Republi
can leaders agreed that his ac
tion had projected Gov. Nel
son A. Rockefeller of New
York toward a contest with
Nixon, former vice president
and the 1960 nominee.
From 16 to 18 of the Republi
can state executives, assem
bling here for a National Gover
nors Conference meeting begin
ning Thursday, have said that if
Romney faltered as the banner
carrying leader of the moder
ates they could support Rocke
feller.
Arriving for the governors'
conference, Rockefeller, insisted

in an interview his position as a
noncandidate had not been
changed by Romney's decision.
But he said he plans confer
ences with Republican gover
nors. He noted that the gover
nors "have stuck together."
While he said he is not a can
didate, the New York governor
said again, as he had Saturday
in Detroit, that he would accept
a draft. He said he had tried to
talk Romney out of withdraw
ing.
Romney had criticized Presi
dent Johnson's Vietnam war
policies, calling for neutraliza
tion of Southeast Asia. Nixon
has supported Johnson's basic
objective of fighting Communist
aggression there. Rockefeller
has given past support to the
President's course but has been
silent about Vietnam for months.
At the end of a disappoint
ing campaign trail that began
long before his formal an
nouncement last Nov. 18, Rom
ney said it was clear his can
didacy "has not won the wide
acceptance with rank-and-file
Republicans that I had hoped
to achieve."
Polls indicated he was the un
derdog in the March 12 New
Hampshire primary where his
name was on the ballot with
Nixon's. A write-in drive for
Rockefeller is under way there.
In the April 2 Wisconsin pri
mary, however, Nixon soems to
have a clear field, since Rocke
feller already has withdrawn his
name.
Romney told follow GOP gov
ernors in a letter that they
ought to work for a candidate
and a platform that would offer
"effective alternatives to for
eign and domestic programs
dealing with such major issues
as Vietnam, inflation, crime, in
dolence, delinquency, race and
power group politics."
The Michigan governor indi

cated he expects a quick deci
sion by the GOP state execu
tives. He scheduled a news
conference in Manchester, N.H.
Friday morning to announce his
support for a candidate they may
pick.
In his letter to his colleagues,
Romney pledged "I will support
wholeheartedly the candidate
for president to whom the Re
publican governors give their
support."
Sen. Hugh Scott, R-Pa., a
Romney supporter, said the
Michigan governor's decision
releases Rockefeller from his
pledge to support Romney.

"We who admire Gov. Rocke
feller look forward to his start
ing an active campaign for
president in the near future,"
said Scott, a former GOP na
tional chairman.
Sen. Thurston B. Morton, R-
Ky., another former national
chairman, said that if Republi
can governors swing their
weight behind Rockefeller, the
New York governor could win
the nomination even if Nixon
were successful in all of the pri
maries.
Sen. Charles H. Percy, R-ni.,
expected to be named as 111-
nois' favorite son, said he ex

pects Romney's withdrawal to
narrow the nomination contest
to a Nixon-Rockefeller affair.
Percy said he hasn't any
choice between the two at this
point but wants to assess their
position on the issues. Illinois'
58-vote delegation is expected to
give the bulk of its support to
Nixon if it follows the lead of
state organization chiefs.
Scott has told friends he
thinks nearly all of Pennsylva
nia's 64-vote delegation will turn
quickly to Rockefeller. The New
York delegation, headed by
Rockefeller, has 92 of the con
vention's 1,333 nominating votes.

the nomination even if Nixon
were successful in all of the pri
maries.
Sen. Charles H. Percy, R-ni.,
expected to be named as 111-
nois' favorite son, said he ex

pects Romney's withdrawal to
narrow the nomination contest
to a Nixon-Rockefeller affair.
Percy said he hasn't any
choice between the two at this
point but wants to assess their
position on the issues. Illinois'
58-vote delegation is expected to
give the bulk of its support to
Nixon if it follows the lead of
state organization chiefs.
Scott has told friends he
thinks nearly all of Pennsylva
nia's 64-vote delegation will turn
quickly to Rockefeller. The New
York delegation, headed by
Rockefeller, has 92 of the con
vention's 1,333 nominating votes.
The effect on the possible can
didacy of Gov. Ronald Reagan
of California, a favorite of con
servatives, was not immediately
clear.
Sen. George Murphy, R-Calif.,
chairman of the Republican
Senatorial Campaign Commit
tee, said that as of now he ac
cepts Reagan's statement that
he is not a serious contender.
"But I don't know what he
might decide in the future,"
Murphy said.
Sen. John G. Tower, expected
to be the favorite son of Texas'
56-vote delegation, praised Rom
ney and called for party "re
sponsibility and unity" in pick
ing a candidate to oppose Presi

Nixon's corner.

WASHINGTON (AP)— Mich
igan Gov. George Romney,
whose candidacy never caught
fire, pulled out of the Republi
can presidential nomination
contest Wednesday to clear the
way for another moderate to op
pose Richard M. Nixon.
Romney told a crowded gath
ering of newsmen that "a criti
cal moment" had arrived at
which the dominantly progres
sive GOP governors should se
lect a candidate to support their
viewpoint.
Romney walked away from
a question as to which man he
would support. But Republi
can leaders agreed that his ac
tion had projected Gov. Nel
son A. Rockefeller of New
York toward a contest with
Nixon, former vice president
and the 1960 nominee.
From 16 to 18 of the Republi
can state executives, assem
bling here for a National Gover
nors Conference meeting begin
ning Thursday, have said that if
Romney faltered as the banner
carrying leader of the moder
ates they could support Rocke
feller.
Arriving for the governors'
conference, Rockefeller, insisted

in an interview his position as a
noncandidate had not been
changed by Romney's decision.
But he said he plans confer
ences with Republican gover
nors. He noted that the gover
nors "have stuck together."
While he said he is not a can
didate, the New York governor
said again, as he had Saturday
in Detroit, that he would accept
a draft. He said he had tried to
talk Romney out of withdraw
ing.
Romney had criticized Presi
dent Johnson's Vietnam war
policies, calling for neutraliza
tion of Southeast Asia. Nixon
has supported Johnson's basic
objective of fighting Communist
aggression there. Rockefeller
has given past support to the
President's course but has been
silent about Vietnam for months.
At the end of a disappoint
ing campaign trail that began
long before his formal an
nouncement last Nov. 18, Rom
ney said it was clear his can
didacy "has not won the wide
acceptance with rank-and-file
Republicans that I had hoped
to achieve."
Polls indicated he was the un
derdog in the March 12 New
Hampshire primary where his
name was on the ballot with
Nixon's. A write-in drive for
Rockefeller is under way there.
In the April 2 Wisconsin pri
mary, however, Nixon soems to
have a clear field, since Rocke
feller already has withdrawn his
name.
Romney told follow GOP gov
ernors in a letter that they
ought to work for a candidate
and a platform that would offer
"effective alternatives to for
eign and domestic programs
dealing with such major issues
as Vietnam, inflation, crime, in
dolence, delinquency, race and
power group politics."
The Michigan governor indi

cated he expects a quick deci
sion by the GOP state execu
tives. He scheduled a news
conference in Manchester, N.H.
Friday morning to announce his
support for a candidate they may
pick.
In his letter to his colleagues,
Romney pledged "I will support
wholeheartedly the candidate
for president to whom the Re
publican governors give their
support."
Sen. Hugh Scott, R-Pa., a
Romney supporter, said the
Michigan governor's decision
releases Rockefeller from his
pledge to support Romney.

"We who admire Gov. Rocke
feller look forward to his start
ing an active campaign for
president in the near future,"
said Scott, a former GOP na
tional chairman.
Sen. Thurston B. Morton, R-
Ky., another former national
chairman, said that if Republi
can governors swing their
weight behind Rockefeller, the
New York governor could win
the nomination even if Nixon
were successful in all of the pri
maries.
