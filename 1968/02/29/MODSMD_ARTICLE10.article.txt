# Judicial Mess
## 
### 
Despite their continuing dispute, Dean of Students Joel Smith
and the ASSU Judicial Council agree on one thing: Stanford's
disciplinary machinery must be scrapped.
Smith said last week "the judicial system at Stanford is un
workable." Judicial Council chairman Richard Such proposes
in today's Daily the creation of a new student-faculty judiciary.
The latest judicial crisis dates back to the Nov. 1 sit-in at En
cina hall, where a CIA recruiter was interviewing students. After
tumultuous public hearings, the Judicial Council recently ac
quitted nine students whom Smith had charged with violating the
University's policy on campus demonstrations. The Council also
decided the nine had not violated the Fundamental Standard
of student conduct (The Council's decision is printed on pages
five and six of today's issue).

Briefly, the Council argued it could not enforce the demon
stration policy because it was vague and overbroad and could
easily be construed to prohibit perfectly legal behavior pro
tected by the First Amendment. As for the Fundamental Stan
dard, the Council decided the defendants had not interfered
with anyone else's rights enough to outweigh their right of
political expression.
Smith responded by criticizing the Council for a "political"
decision and an "assumption of law-making powers." He has
appealed the case to the Interim Judicial Body, a faculty panel
which the ASSU explicitly refuses to recognize. As a gesture
of non-cooperation, the Judicial Council refused to give the IJB
tapes of the public hearings of the case. Now it is doubtful the
administration will ever deal with the Judicial Council again.
Who is right? As the Judicial Council's opinion clearly argues,
the University's demonstrations policy is defective. The Judicial
Council has said it would enforce the policy on demonstrations
if it were enforceable. Its opinion makes the objections to the
policy so specific that the University cannot fail to grasp them.

This is not, as the Dean of Students has implied, a usurpation
of law-making powers by the judiciary. It is, rather, a manifesta
tion of the personal integrity of the Judicial Council's members.
Eight of them (including a faculty member) were convinced
the demonstrations policy as written simply could not be en
forced.
If it sees fit to prohibit certain kinds of demonstrations (usually
political), the University must be very careful not to infringe
the right of free speech — the very right it claims to defend on
behalf of the CIA. And to make sure it does not infringe on this
right, the University must promulgate regulations with two
things in mind: first, that students have a right to take part in
forming such policies, and second, that such policies have to be
specific and within constitutional bounds.
The University must also realize that the Fundamental Stan
dard will no longer suffice as a disciplinary code. This vague
demand for "respect for order, morality, personal honor, and the
rights of others" breaks down when the generations sincerely
disagree on moral imperatives. If the administration wants to
prohibit certain acts, it must spell out with legal rigor exactly
what it means.

In reforming the judicial system, a first step would be recog
nizing that the judiciary has the right to declare a regulation
unenforceable and recommend its revision. A more just dis
ciplinary code will result.
The judicial structures themselves will never be satisfactory
as long as students, faculty and administrators think of their
relationships in hierarchical terms. The University president can
reserve for himself final disciplinary responsibility, but he
should give a community judicial body final authority in prac
tice to enforce — and help create — campus regulations.
Both the present Judicial Council and the IJB have lost any
usefulness due to the strife over die CIA case. We recommend
the immediate establishment of a student-faculty judicial board
with exclusive original jurisdiction.
In the past students and administrators have been unable to
agree on a method of selection for the members of such a board.
We suggest a compromise. Some members could be chosen by the
student legislature, some by the Academic Council, and some
by the president. With good faith by all parties, the myriad judi
cial disputes could be resolved.
