## Captured Document Business Booms 
### Art Buchwald 
As everyone is aware, the best
source of information concern
ing how things are going in
Vietnam is captured enemy
documents. If it weren't for
those captured documents, our
political and military leaders
would certainly not be as opti
mistic about the war as they
seem to be right now.
By chance I came across an
enemy document myself the oth
er day, and it was a windfall
because it described how the
North Vietnamese were man
aging to get their captured en
emy documents into the hands
of the South Vietnamese and
Americans.
It seems that Hanoi has
turned over the responsibility of
manufacturing and distributing
captured documents to the 101st
Captured Enemy Document Bri
gade.
The headquarters of the 101st

CED Brigade is located five
stories underground somewhere
near the Chinese border. There,
under the supervision of the no
torious Col. Vinh Su, a Soviet
built mimeograph machine turns
out an average of 10,000 enemy
documents a day.
Because of wartime conditions
these captured documents are
printed on a heavy low-grade pa
per which is one of the main
reasons American intelligence
believes that Hanoi is ready to
throw in the towel. No country
can survive long if it has to
print its orders on low-grade pa
per.
But the paper has a twofold
purpose. After the documents
are printed they are issued to
North Vietnamese and Viet Ceng
soldiers as part of their uni
form.
The captured enemy docu
ments are used as insulation for

the wet-weather jackets, as well
as for stuffing into sandals
when the cheap North Vietna
mese leather gives out.
It is for this insulation that
North Vietnamese soldiers and
Viet Cong are so anxious to car
ry captured enemy documents
on themselves.
The documents are also used
as handkerchiefs and for start
ing fires, though Gen. Vo Ngu
yen Giap, in a recently captured
enemy document, warned his
troops that burning a document
that could eventually fall into
the hands of the Americans was
a court-martial offense.
Although all Viet Cong forces
are issued captured enemy docu
ments. the 101st CED Brigade
is solely charged with carrying
the highly classified ones which
eventually will get to the Penta
gon and then be given to pro-
Administration columnists.

The members of the 101st are
given extensive training. They
are then sent out on patrol with
the captured documents hidden
in their knapsacks. As soon as
they see a South Vietnamese or
American unit they throw up
their hands and surrender.
While being searched they bab
ble that they were all innocently
duped by the Communists.
Needless to say, there is a big
turnover in the 101st Brigade,
particularly when its main mis
sion is to be captured. But the
supplying of captured enemy
documents to Saigon has high
est priority for Hanoi, and the
demand for them has increased
with each new escalation.
As a matter of fact there is
now a black market in captured
enemy documents and many
South Vietnamese have decided
to manufacture them to sell to
the various American intelli-

gence agencies.
These captured documents are
printed on better paper, and are
easier to study since they
weren't carried down from the
North. Also some enterprising
forgers are printing them in En
glish to make them easier for
the Americans to read.
This has naturally angered the
North Vietnamese who have de
manded that unless the illicit
traffic in captured enemy docu
ments ceases, they will not come
to the conference table.
"It's our biggest export item,"
Col. Su told a visiting French
newspaperman, "and now they
even want to take that away
from us."
