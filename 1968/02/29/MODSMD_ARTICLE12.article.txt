## Administration Abuses Judicial Power 
### RICHARD SUCH Chairman ASSU Judicial Council 
The basic issue in the ClA
demonstration is not, as the ad
ministration would have it, one
of student-power vs. administra
tion-power. It is one of the use
and misuse of administration
power.
The typical misuse (not use)
of administrative power has two
stages. In Stage One, the admin
istration formulates a policy or
plan that is theoretically un
sound, practically unworkable,
politically undesireable or, as in
this case, legally unenforceable.
Jealous of its prerogatives
and to a degree contemptuous of
the non-administrative mind, the
administration fails to test the
plan or policy in the communal
crucible and proceeds to the
Second Stage, in which the plan
or policy turns out to be un
sound, unworkable, undesirea
ble, or unenforcible.
Thereupon, the administration
utterly loses its cool and rides
roughshod over anyone or any
thing that happens to stand in
its way. (The attentive reader
will have noticed a parallel to
the misuse of power of another
administration.)
Let me show how this typical
misuse of power applies to the
case at hand. In the First Stage,
the administration decreed a
University Policy on Campus
Demonstrations so broad and so
vague as to fly in the face of
basic constitutional rights.
Then the Judicial Council

found the Policy too broad and
too vague, and the administra
tion, in Stage Two now, respon
ded by telling the Council that
it has suspended law and order
on the campus and has lost, or
will lose, its jurisdiction over
demonstration cases, although
that jurisdiction is guaranteed
by the ASSU constitution and
the Tri-Partite Compact, and al
though the Council has tried to
make it perfectly clear, as the
opinion printed elsewhere in this
edition shows, that the Council
is willing to enforce a valid
ASSU or University policy for
bidding the undesireable aspects
of demonstrations.
Let us go back to Stage One.
The administration, along with
the faculty and students, en
tered Into the Tri-Partite Com
pact.
The Compact, although ad
dressing itself to the question of
appeals, nowhere spoke of a
right of appeal by the Dean of
Students. (Neither the ASSU
Constitution nor By-Laws pro
vides such a right.) Then the
administration, Stage Two, with
out consulting the faculty or
students, as the Compact re
quired, endowed the Dean with
a right of appeal from Judicial
Council decisions to a Body
which was established by the
Compact for a purpose other
than to hear appeals from the
Judicial Council.
Stage One again. The Compact
provided for appellate bodies in
certain cases, but it did not pro

vide for a body with the broad
jurisdiction to review or to re
hear all cases in which the Judi
cial Council'had made a deci
sion, which tends to show that
no such body was intended.
The administration, pursuant
to the Compact, created a Body
with the narrow jurisdiction to
hear cases involving a conflict
between ASSU and University
policies. But then the adminis
tration unilaterally modified the
Compact by giving that Body,
the IJB, in addition to its nar
row jurisdiction, a broad juris
diction to review Judicial Coun
cil decisions.
That broad jurisdiction could
only have been created by the
administration, the faculty, and
the students acting in concert,
for the Compact provides that
"every constituency adopting or
approving this resolution there
by affirms its present intention
to utilize the procedure prior to
taking action in every instance
in which, in its judgment, the
matter is one in which the other
constituencies have a legitimate
interest. . . ."
Now Stage Two. The Judicial
Council, recognizing that the
broad jurisdiction of the IJB had
been created in breach of the
Tri-Partite Compact, has refused
to turn over to the IJB the re
cordings of its hearings in the
CIA-demonstration case.
There are other reasons for
that refusal, including that fact
that the Council answered the
defendants' objections to the re

cording with the unequivocal
promise that the tapes "will not
be accessible to anyone the de
fendants don't want them to be
accessible to." Thereupon the ad
ministration threatened, in
words very close to these, that
"if the students won't discipline
themselves, then the President
of the University will."
It is the attitude of the Judi
cial Council, generally, that in
the viable judicial framework
that hopefully will emerge from
the current confusion, there will
be room for a right of appeal by
the administration (or, better,
by the Academic Council) in
certain cases, and there will be
a Student -Faculty Appeals
Board with broad jurisdiction to
review Judicial Council deci
sions, as is intimated by the
Compact.
But the Council does not be
lieve that such a right or any
such appellate body has yet
been created, other than by a
misuse of administrative power.
And it is fair to say that there
would be a Student-Faculty Ap
peals Board today if the admin
istration would give up some of
its capacity for a misuse of
power by agreeing to the ap
pointment of some members of
the Board by faculty and stu
dents.

Smith has also been asked to
comment on the current judicial
crisis. The text of the judicial
council's decision appears on
page five of today's DAILY.)

by the Academic Council) in
certain cases, and there will be
a Student -Faculty Appeals
Board with broad jurisdiction to
review Judicial Council deci
sions, as is intimated by the
Compact.
But the Council does not be
lieve that such a right or any
such appellate body has yet
been created, other than by a
misuse of administrative power.
And it is fair to say that there
would be a Student-Faculty Ap
peals Board today if the admin
istration would give up some of
its capacity for a misuse of
power by agreeing to the ap
pointment of some members of
the Board by faculty and stu
dents.
(Note: Dean of Students Joel
Smith has also been asked to
comment on the current judicial
crisis. The text of the judicial
council's decision appears on
page five of today's DAILY.)
The basic issue in the ClA
demonstration is not, as the ad
ministration would have it, one
of student-power vs. administra
tion-power. It is one of the use
and misuse of administration
power.
The typical misuse (not use)
of administrative power has two
stages. In Stage One, the admin
istration formulates a policy or
plan that is theoretically un
sound, practically unworkable,
politically undesireable or, as in
this case, legally unenforceable.
Jealous of its prerogatives
and to a degree contemptuous of
the non-administrative mind, the
administration fails to test the
plan or policy in the communal
crucible and proceeds to the
Second Stage, in which the plan
or policy turns out to be un
sound, unworkable, undesirea
ble, or unenforcible.
Thereupon, the administration
utterly loses its cool and rides
roughshod over anyone or any
thing that happens to stand in
its way. (The attentive reader
will have noticed a parallel to
the misuse of power of another
administration.)
Let me show how this typical
misuse of power applies to the
case at hand. In the First Stage,
the administration decreed a
University Policy on Campus
Demonstrations so broad and so
vague as to fly in the face of
basic constitutional rights.
Then the Judicial Council

found the Policy too broad and
too vague, and the administra
tion, in Stage Two now, respon
ded by telling the Council that
it has suspended law and order
on the campus and has lost, or
will lose, its jurisdiction over
demonstration cases, although
that jurisdiction is guaranteed
by the ASSU constitution and
the Tri-Partite Compact, and al
though the Council has tried to
make it perfectly clear, as the
opinion printed elsewhere in this
edition shows, that the Council
is willing to enforce a valid
ASSU or University policy for
bidding the undesireable aspects
of demonstrations.
Let us go back to Stage One.
The administration, along with
the faculty and students, en
tered Into the Tri-Partite Com
pact.
The Compact, although ad
dressing itself to the question of
appeals, nowhere spoke of a
right of appeal by the Dean of
Students. (Neither the ASSU
Constitution nor By-Laws pro
vides such a right.) Then the
administration, Stage Two, with
out consulting the faculty or
students, as the Compact re
quired, endowed the Dean with
a right of appeal from Judicial
Council decisions to a Body
which was established by the
Compact for a purpose other
than to hear appeals from the
Judicial Council.
Stage One again. The Compact
provided for appellate bodies in
certain cases, but it did not pro

vide for a body with the broad
jurisdiction to review or to re
hear all cases in which the Judi
cial Council'had made a deci
sion, which tends to show that
no such body was intended.
The administration, pursuant
to the Compact, created a Body
with the narrow jurisdiction to
hear cases involving a conflict
between ASSU and University
policies. But then the adminis
tration unilaterally modified the
Compact by giving that Body,
the IJB, in addition to its nar
row jurisdiction, a broad juris
diction to review Judicial Coun
cil decisions.
That broad jurisdiction could
only have been created by the
administration, the faculty, and
the students acting in concert,
for the Compact provides that
"every constituency adopting or
approving this resolution there
by affirms its present intention
to utilize the procedure prior to
taking action in every instance
in which, in its judgment, the
matter is one in which the other
constituencies have a legitimate
interest. . . ."
Now Stage Two. The Judicial
Council, recognizing that the
broad jurisdiction of the IJB had
been created in breach of the
Tri-Partite Compact, has refused
to turn over to the IJB the re
cordings of its hearings in the
CIA-demonstration case.
There are other reasons for
that refusal, including that fact
that the Council answered the
defendants' objections to the re

cording with the unequivocal
promise that the tapes "will not
be accessible to anyone the de
fendants don't want them to be
accessible to." Thereupon the ad
ministration threatened, in
words very close to these, that
"if the students won't discipline
themselves, then the President
of the University will."
It is the attitude of the Judi
cial Council, generally, that in
the viable judicial framework
that hopefully will emerge from
the current confusion, there will
be room for a right of appeal by
the administration (or, better,
by the Academic Council) in
certain cases, and there will be
a Student -Faculty Appeals
Board with broad jurisdiction to
review Judicial Council deci
sions, as is intimated by the

Tri-Partite Compact, has refused
to turn over to the IJB the re
cordings of its hearings in the
CIA-demonstration case.
There are other reasons for
that refusal, including that fact
that the Council answered the
defendants' objections to the re

cording with the unequivocal
promise that the tapes "will not
be accessible to anyone the de
fendants don't want them to be
accessible to." Thereupon the ad
ministration threatened, in
words very close to these, that
"if the students won't discipline
themselves, then the President
of the University will."
It is the attitude of the Judi
cial Council, generally, that in
the viable judicial framework
that hopefully will emerge from
the current confusion, there will
be room for a right of appeal by
the administration (or, better,
by the Academic Council) in
certain cases, and there will be
a Student -Faculty Appeals
Board with broad jurisdiction to
review Judicial Council deci
sions, as is intimated by the
Compact.
But the Council does not be
lieve that such a right or any
such appellate body has yet
been created, other than by a
misuse of administrative power.
And it is fair to say that there
would be a Student-Faculty Ap
peals Board today if the admin
istration would give up some of
its capacity for a misuse of
power by agreeing to the ap
pointment of some members of
the Board by faculty and stu
dents.
(Note: Dean of Students Joel
Smith has also been asked to
comment on the current judicial
crisis. The text of the judicial
council's decision appears on

The basic issue in the ClA
demonstration is not, as the ad
ministration would have it, one
of student-power vs. administra
tion-power. It is one of the use
and misuse of administration
power.
The typical misuse (not use)
of administrative power has two
stages. In Stage One, the admin
istration formulates a policy or
plan that is theoretically un
sound, practically unworkable,
politically undesireable or, as in
this case, legally unenforceable.
Jealous of its prerogatives
and to a degree contemptuous of
the non-administrative mind, the
administration fails to test the
plan or policy in the communal
crucible and proceeds to the
Second Stage, in which the plan
or policy turns out to be un
sound, unworkable, undesirea
ble, or unenforcible.
Thereupon, the administration
utterly loses its cool and rides
roughshod over anyone or any
thing that happens to stand in
its way. (The attentive reader
will have noticed a parallel to
the misuse of power of another
administration.)
Let me show how this typical
misuse of power applies to the
case at hand. In the First Stage,
the administration decreed a
University Policy on Campus
Demonstrations so broad and so
vague as to fly in the face of
basic constitutional rights.
Then the Judicial Council

found the Policy too broad and
too vague, and the administra
tion, in Stage Two now, respon
ded by telling the Council that
it has suspended law and order
on the campus and has lost, or
will lose, its jurisdiction over
demonstration cases, although
that jurisdiction is guaranteed
by the ASSU constitution and
the Tri-Partite Compact, and al
though the Council has tried to
make it perfectly clear, as the
opinion printed elsewhere in this
edition shows, that the Council
is willing to enforce a valid
ASSU or University policy for
bidding the undesireable aspects
of demonstrations.
Let us go back to Stage One.
The administration, along with
the faculty and students, en
tered Into the Tri-Partite Com
pact.
The Compact, although ad
dressing itself to the question of
appeals, nowhere spoke of a
right of appeal by the Dean of
Students. (Neither the ASSU
Constitution nor By-Laws pro
vides such a right.) Then the
administration, Stage Two, with
out consulting the faculty or
students, as the Compact re
quired, endowed the Dean with
a right of appeal from Judicial
Council decisions to a Body
which was established by the
Compact for a purpose other
than to hear appeals from the
Judicial Council.
Stage One again. The Compact
provided for appellate bodies in
certain cases, but it did not pro

vide for a body with the broad
jurisdiction to review or to re
hear all cases in which the Judi
cial Council'had made a deci
sion, which tends to show that
no such body was intended.
The administration, pursuant
to the Compact, created a Body
with the narrow jurisdiction to
hear cases involving a conflict
between ASSU and University
policies. But then the adminis
tration unilaterally modified the
Compact by giving that Body,
the IJB, in addition to its nar
row jurisdiction, a broad juris
diction to review Judicial Coun
cil decisions.
That broad jurisdiction could
only have been created by the
administration, the faculty, and
the students acting in concert,
for the Compact provides that
"every constituency adopting or
approving this resolution there
by affirms its present intention
to utilize the procedure prior to
taking action in every instance
in which, in its judgment, the
matter is one in which the other
constituencies have a legitimate
interest. . . ."
Now Stage Two. The Judicial
Council, recognizing that the
broad jurisdiction of the IJB had
been created in breach of the
Tri-Partite Compact, has refused
to turn over to the IJB the re
cordings of its hearings in the
CIA-demonstration case.
There are other reasons for
