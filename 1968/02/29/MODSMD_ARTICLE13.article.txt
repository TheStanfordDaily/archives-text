## Can White Liberals Crush Prejudice? 
### Harvey H. Hukari, Jr 
Like Don Quixote sallying
forth to do battle with the forces
of unmitigated evil as repre
sented by harmless, weather
beaten windmills, the profes
sional journalism fellows study
ing here at Stanford recently
sought to crush what they per
ceived to be a blatant manifes
tation of racism in the form of
several black-faced statues that
decorate the grounds of a local
eating establishment.
Unlike the misguided hero of a
Cervantes novel, the journalism
fellows, by threatening to drink
their martinis elsewhere unless
appropriate action was taken,
succeeded in their effort and,
segregation and prejudice were
conquered in Palo Alto. The
faces of the statues were all
painted white.
In retrospect, one might well
question how important such a
"victory" is in the struggle to
Improve the lives of this na
tion's black population.
So far there have been no re
ports of Negroes dancing joy
ously in the streets of East Palo
Alto in celebration of the cour
ageous battle won by the fifteen
journalism fellows, all but one
of whom are white, nor have
many shouts of hallelujah been
heard from the mouths of
thankful black students at Stan
ford.
No Real Effect
Perhaps the primary reason
that there has been no mass

outpouring of gratitude is the
fact that the whitewashing of a
few statues in a parking lot
does not do one thing to allevi
ate the suffering and misery
which confronts a large seg
ment of the 21 million blacks
living in this country today.
In essence, it is an act of
social and political irrelevancy
which exemplifies the mentality
of self-serving Liberals who
would rather assauge their con
sciences by attacking the alleged
racism of a restaurant owner
on this side of the Bayshore
Freeway than by crossing that
bridge on University Ave. and
confronting the problems of ig
norance, poverty, and discrim
ination first hand.

It is indicative of the kind of
attitude manifested by those
"concerned" citizens who are
more than willing to explain, in
detail, the sacrifices that others
should make in order to pro
mote racial equality.
These white Liberals are
quick to condemn conditions in
Mississippi and other southern
states, but as events of the past
three summers demonstrate, the
situation is not nearly as critical
in Atlanta and Birmingham as
it is in Detroit and Cleveland.
Liberals Fall
How ironic it is that the worst
racial riots of this dccade have
occurred not in those urban
areas controlled by rock-ribbed
conservatives but in those cities
governed by mayors who con
sider themselves enlightened
liberals.
What American Negroes need
is not an increase in the empty,
liberal rhetoric flowing from the
mouths of such government of
ficials as Lyndon Johnson but
visible improvements in their
lives that interrelate to better
education, better jobs, and the
opportunity to exert a degree
of political and economic control
over their own affairs.
In view of these urgent needs
it seems somehow petty to her
ald the change of pigmentation
on a few meaningless statues
as a victory for justice and
equality.

What is most disturbing about
this incident is the apparent
motivation behind it. If it is the
Liberal's purpose to whitewash
away the feelings of subservi
ence and inferiority by system
atically eliminating examples of
ethnic and racial differences in
American culture, then why not
go all the way and start white
washing real Negroes?
Ethnic Barriers
Given such examples as the
current action of the Jewish
Anti-Defamation League in
suing the Italian Anti-Defama
tion League for using its name,
one might wonder if ethnic dis
parities and the conflicts arising
from them can ever be resolved.
Perhaps the radicals are cor
rect in maintaining that what
Revolution which will destroy
the existing links with tradi
tional identities and differences.
Whitewashing is only a start.
Let us continue by ridding
society of all those things

which represent unfairly var
ious races and nationalities.
Force those French and Chinese
restaurants to either change
their names and cuisine or go
out of business. Take Eskimo
Pies off the market. Ban the tell
ing of Polish jokes. Remove
wooden Indians from the front
of cigar stores.
Once that is accomplished
why not direct the efforts of the
professional journalism fellows
towards eliminating the hideous
ethnic stereotypes that abound
in advertising?
Dump those cute Hawaiian
kids peddling C and H sugar!
Get rid of that senile little, old
Italian-Swiss Colony wine
maker!
Fire that stupid Colombian
who hauls around those bags
of Yuban coffee beans! Above
all, carry on with determination
and in the face of resistance
do not despair! For if Aunt
Jemima falls, can Chef Boy-Ar-
Dee hold out much longer?


"I can confirm absolutely, Mr. President, that I was attacked . . .
by Senators Morse and Fulbright... !"

is not an increase in the empty,
liberal rhetoric flowing from the
mouths of such government of
ficials as Lyndon Johnson but
visible improvements in their
lives that interrelate to better
education, better jobs, and the
opportunity to exert a degree
of political and economic control
over their own affairs.
In view of these urgent needs
it seems somehow petty to her
ald the change of pigmentation
on a few meaningless statues
as a victory for justice and
equality.

What is most disturbing about
this incident is the apparent
motivation behind it. If it is the
Liberal's purpose to whitewash
away the feelings of subservi
ence and inferiority by system
atically eliminating examples of
ethnic and racial differences in
American culture, then why not
go all the way and start white
washing real Negroes?
Ethnic Barriers
Given such examples as the
current action of the Jewish
Anti-Defamation League in
suing the Italian Anti-Defama
tion League for using its name,
one might wonder if ethnic dis
parities and the conflicts arising
from them can ever be resolved.
Perhaps the radicals are cor
rect in maintaining that what
Revolution which will destroy
the existing links with tradi
tional identities and differences.
Whitewashing is only a start.
Let us continue by ridding
society of all those things

which represent unfairly var
ious races and nationalities.
Force those French and Chinese
restaurants to either change
their names and cuisine or go
out of business. Take Eskimo
Pies off the market. Ban the tell
ing of Polish jokes. Remove
wooden Indians from the front
of cigar stores.
Once that is accomplished
why not direct the efforts of the
professional journalism fellows
towards eliminating the hideous
ethnic stereotypes that abound
in advertising?
Dump those cute Hawaiian
kids peddling C and H sugar!
Get rid of that senile little, old
Italian-Swiss Colony wine
maker!
Fire that stupid Colombian
who hauls around those bags
of Yuban coffee beans! Above
all, carry on with determination
and in the face of resistance
do not despair! For if Aunt
Jemima falls, can Chef Boy-Ar-
Dee hold out much longer?


"I can confirm absolutely, Mr. President, that I was attacked . . .
by Senators Morse and Fulbright... !"
Like Don Quixote sallying
forth to do battle with the forces
of unmitigated evil as repre
sented by harmless, weather
beaten windmills, the profes
sional journalism fellows study
ing here at Stanford recently
sought to crush what they per
ceived to be a blatant manifes
tation of racism in the form of
several black-faced statues that
decorate the grounds of a local
eating establishment.
Unlike the misguided hero of a
Cervantes novel, the journalism
fellows, by threatening to drink
their martinis elsewhere unless
appropriate action was taken,
succeeded in their effort and,
segregation and prejudice were
conquered in Palo Alto. The
faces of the statues were all
painted white.
In retrospect, one might well
question how important such a
"victory" is in the struggle to
Improve the lives of this na
tion's black population.
So far there have been no re
ports of Negroes dancing joy
ously in the streets of East Palo
Alto in celebration of the cour
ageous battle won by the fifteen
journalism fellows, all but one
of whom are white, nor have
many shouts of hallelujah been
heard from the mouths of
thankful black students at Stan
ford.
No Real Effect
Perhaps the primary reason
that there has been no mass

outpouring of gratitude is the
fact that the whitewashing of a
few statues in a parking lot
does not do one thing to allevi
ate the suffering and misery
which confronts a large seg
ment of the 21 million blacks
living in this country today.
In essence, it is an act of
social and political irrelevancy
which exemplifies the mentality
of self-serving Liberals who
would rather assauge their con
sciences by attacking the alleged
racism of a restaurant owner
on this side of the Bayshore
Freeway than by crossing that
bridge on University Ave. and
confronting the problems of ig
norance, poverty, and discrim
ination first hand.

It is indicative of the kind of
attitude manifested by those
"concerned" citizens who are
more than willing to explain, in
detail, the sacrifices that others
should make in order to pro
mote racial equality.
These white Liberals are
quick to condemn conditions in
Mississippi and other southern
states, but as events of the past
three summers demonstrate, the
situation is not nearly as critical
in Atlanta and Birmingham as
it is in Detroit and Cleveland.
Liberals Fall
How ironic it is that the worst
racial riots of this dccade have
occurred not in those urban
areas controlled by rock-ribbed
conservatives but in those cities
governed by mayors who con
sider themselves enlightened
liberals.

Cervantes novel, the journalism
fellows, by threatening to drink
their martinis elsewhere unless
appropriate action was taken,
succeeded in their effort and,
segregation and prejudice were
conquered in Palo Alto. The
faces of the statues were all
painted white.
In retrospect, one might well
question how important such a
"victory" is in the struggle to
Improve the lives of this na
tion's black population.
So far there have been no re
ports of Negroes dancing joy
ously in the streets of East Palo
Alto in celebration of the cour
ageous battle won by the fifteen
journalism fellows, all but one
of whom are white, nor have
many shouts of hallelujah been
heard from the mouths of
thankful black students at Stan
ford.
No Real Effect
Perhaps the primary reason
that there has been no mass

outpouring of gratitude is the
fact that the whitewashing of a
few statues in a parking lot
does not do one thing to allevi
ate the suffering and misery
which confronts a large seg
ment of the 21 million blacks
living in this country today.
In essence, it is an act of
social and political irrelevancy
which exemplifies the mentality
of self-serving Liberals who
would rather assauge their con
sciences by attacking the alleged
racism of a restaurant owner
on this side of the Bayshore
Freeway than by crossing that
bridge on University Ave. and
confronting the problems of ig
norance, poverty, and discrim
ination first hand.

It is indicative of the kind of
attitude manifested by those
"concerned" citizens who are
more than willing to explain, in
detail, the sacrifices that others
should make in order to pro
mote racial equality.
These white Liberals are
quick to condemn conditions in
Mississippi and other southern
states, but as events of the past
three summers demonstrate, the
situation is not nearly as critical
in Atlanta and Birmingham as
it is in Detroit and Cleveland.
Liberals Fall
How ironic it is that the worst
racial riots of this dccade have
occurred not in those urban
areas controlled by rock-ribbed
conservatives but in those cities
governed by mayors who con
sider themselves enlightened
liberals.
What American Negroes need
is not an increase in the empty,
liberal rhetoric flowing from the
mouths of such government of
ficials as Lyndon Johnson but
visible improvements in their
lives that interrelate to better
education, better jobs, and the
opportunity to exert a degree
of political and economic control
over their own affairs.
In view of these urgent needs
it seems somehow petty to her
ald the change of pigmentation
on a few meaningless statues
as a victory for justice and
equality.

What is most disturbing about
this incident is the apparent
motivation behind it. If it is the
Liberal's purpose to whitewash
away the feelings of subservi
ence and inferiority by system
atically eliminating examples of
ethnic and racial differences in
American culture, then why not
go all the way and start white
washing real Negroes?
Ethnic Barriers
Given such examples as the
current action of the Jewish
Anti-Defamation League in
suing the Italian Anti-Defama
tion League for using its name,
one might wonder if ethnic dis
parities and the conflicts arising
from them can ever be resolved.
Perhaps the radicals are cor
rect in maintaining that what
Revolution which will destroy
the existing links with tradi
tional identities and differences.
Whitewashing is only a start.
Let us continue by ridding
society of all those things

which represent unfairly var
ious races and nationalities.
Force those French and Chinese
restaurants to either change
their names and cuisine or go
out of business. Take Eskimo
Pies off the market. Ban the tell
ing of Polish jokes. Remove
wooden Indians from the front
of cigar stores.
Once that is accomplished
why not direct the efforts of the
professional journalism fellows
towards eliminating the hideous
ethnic stereotypes that abound
in advertising?
Dump those cute Hawaiian
kids peddling C and H sugar!
Get rid of that senile little, old
Italian-Swiss Colony wine
maker!
Fire that stupid Colombian
who hauls around those bags
of Yuban coffee beans! Above
all, carry on with determination
and in the face of resistance
do not despair! For if Aunt
Jemima falls, can Chef Boy-Ar-
Dee hold out much longer?


"I can confirm absolutely, Mr. President, that I was attacked . . .
by Senators Morse and Fulbright... !"
Like Don Quixote sallying
forth to do battle with the forces
of unmitigated evil as repre
sented by harmless, weather
beaten windmills, the profes
sional journalism fellows study
ing here at Stanford recently
sought to crush what they per
ceived to be a blatant manifes
tation of racism in the form of
several black-faced statues that
decorate the grounds of a local
eating establishment.
