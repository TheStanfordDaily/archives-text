# From A Reporter's Notebook
## Gil Hile, Where Are You? 
### NICK SELBY 
Whatever happened to Gil
Hile?
This question has been plagu
ing many Stanford students in
the last month with the return
of the all-night movies spon
sored by a car sales firm located
at the same spot Gil's concern
was.
Gil Hile reigned as the na
tional king of late-night an
nouncers and he built up a
growing, dedicated following in
the Stanford community.
He had a special type of 61an
in his job, one that made his
lectures on blue book values
far more appealing than those
given by Stanford professors at
eight or nine o'clock. For stu
dents thought nothing of stay
ing up all night to catch Gil's
Gospel in a 5:45 a.m. commer
cial.
Gil's Failure
But suddenly Gil disappeared,
and the late night movies were
no more. Rumors had it that
Gil's auto concern had gone
bankrupt, and that Gil was
forced from the air much
against his own wishes.
No one believed that Hile had
willfully abdicated his throne in
the all-night movie world. To
utter the thought was to pro
nounce oneself a heretic. Gil
cared about his viewers, and
they loved him in return.
Now there is a new movie
czar, who curiously comes from
the same location Gil did. Some
viewers suspect there was a
power, struggle on the lot,
and that Chic Lambert, the new
announcer, and his dog Major
(your friend and mine) emerged
supreme.
Perhaps there was foul play,
and concern for Hile's safety is
growing tremendously.
Meanwhile, Chic's smiling
face fills the screen, and he talks

about the "gold seal automo
bile" and the car salesman's
bible, the blue book, with the
same intensity that Gil did.
He adds information on how
the videocon works (it's the
machine that sends movies into
living rooms) or how his video
taped "interruptions" are made.
Chic's Approach
It's all very impressive, and
Chic is beginning to acquire
some character in his post after
a month's practice. His homey,
down-to-earth diction avoids the
big words which usually chill
intellectual ardor.
He talks first, then decides
what to say.
Occasionally a few words are
missing. It's a truly impress
ive style.
But somehow, something is
missing. One never forgets his
first love, and Chic's talents
notwithstanding, many viewers
still want Gil. Others who never
witnessed Gil at his best are
content.
Some sceptics in the reading
public may question what all
this stuff about late night
movies matters. They are apt
to say the flics are of fourth
class quality, and dismiss the
problem at that. Defenders of
the all-night viewing practice
will generally agree the movies
are bad.
The Thrill Of It
They have, however, a special
argument to counter this attack.
They admit that one sees eyes
poked out with voodoo needles,
44 inch busts, turtles crushed
under the foot of a manical
Peter Sellers, and other assorted
crudities.
But, as they say, "It's the
real world," and they'll tell you
that you can't leave the Uni
versity unaware of the dangers
without.
But their real reason for

watching the films is the man
who breaks them up with com
mercials. In the good old days,
there was Gil Hile. Chic unfor
tunately will never match Hile's
style, or even begin to touch
his mastery of the art.
Will Gil ever come back?
Could Gil and Chic perhaps
team up to applaud the glories
of their car, palace? The Daily
tried to contact Chic for infor
mation on Hile's whereabouts,
but the effort fell through.
So, for the meanwhile, late
night flick fanatics must content
themselves with the memories
Chic unknowingly inspires. They
must hope that Gil is well and
may someday return to flood
the night with fun.
Watching Chic will help to
keep them in shape for Gil's
comeback. Here may be the
only reasons for staying up late
anymore.
