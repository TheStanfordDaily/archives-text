## Sponsor's Role Is A Demanding One 
### STEVEN TIPTON Head Wilbur Sponsor PAM LAWRENCE Head Roble Sponsor 
The "Sponsor Reform" edi
torial which appeared in Mon
day's Daily was grounded in a
fundamental Misunderstanding
of the living situation in fresh
man residences and what spon
sors are doing there.
It describes the purpose of
sponsor selection as "determin
ing the type of upperclassmen
who can best mold the unform
ed freshman mind." The carica
ture reflects a lack of familiarity
with the extent of maturity and
self-awareness of freshmen and
with the kind of relationships
that have developed between
them and sponsors, particularly
in the past several years.
The sponsor bears the respon
sibility of a friend and an infor
mal teacher to the persons with
whom he is living. This does not
imply the impossible and pre
tentious role described in the
editorial, but it does represent
some real demands. To have any
significant effect on the quality
of life in a freshman residence,
a sponsor (or any upperclass
man) must accept a definite re

sponsibility for its members as
a primary concern. He must re
direct substantial time and en
ergy to them from academic
work and outside involvement.
It is highly doubtful that all
those upperclassmen who "would
just live with the freshmen"
would recognize such a respon
sibility, or would make the sac
rifices necessary to act on it if
they did.
The editorial's proposal bears
a close resemblance to a plan
suggested by Dean Gordon's
staff two years ago. The ASSU
Housing Commission observed
that under such an arrangement
. . . upperclassmen would es
sentially be guests whose
rooms happened to be in a
freshman dormitory. It is dif
ficult to understand what
would motivate upperclassmen
to accept such a position, or
why they would feel any dedi
cation to close personal inter
action with the freshmen in
an educational sense.
Experience in Lassen House
this year has demonstrated that
the mere presence of upperclass
men in a predominantly fresh
man residence does little to meet

the needs of freshmen or sat
isfy the desires of upperclass
men.
Freshman Problems
In the demonstration houses,
with more balanced ratios of in
tegration, it has become evident
that particular attention must be
given to the problems peculiar
to freshmen. To realize the in
tent of integration, upperclass
members of integrated houses
must accept a kind of personal
and educational responsibility
analogous to that of sponsors in
all-freshman residences.
The purpose of sponsor selec
tion is not to find intellectual
drill-instructors to mold fresh
men into men. The authoritarian
personality, regardless of spe
cific type, doesn't belong in a
place where personal power must
be used with a discretion that
can come only from caring in
a sensitive and intelligent way
for those around oneself, while
respecting their integrity and
one's own limitations. This is the
primary criterion of selection,
set in terms of each prospective
sponsor's understanding of him
self and the situation he intends
to enter.
The written application and in

terview are means for each can
didate to think over and express
his own judgments of sponsor
ing to a group composed of resi
dence directors and faculty resi
dents as well as sponsors. The
intent, basis, and procedure of
sponsor selection differ consid
erably from that of the social
fraternity as it has traditionally
existed at Stanford.
New Motivation
In the past four or five years
sponsors have moved toward a
highly individualized personal
ism and away from any formal
or public position of authority.
Anyone familiar with this fact
will find it difficult to credit
the editorial's claim that sponsor
selection is fostering "a self-per
petuating homogeneity."
We believe that a careful con
sideration of conditions in fresh
man residences and the short
comings of the sponsor system
most forcefully indicates the
need for fully integrated hous
ing. It does not follow from this
that partial integration is better
than no integration at all, parti
cularly if it comes at the ex
pense of a sponsor system which
recognizes the problems of a
segregated freshman year.

erably from that of the social
fraternity as it has traditionally
existed at Stanford.
New Motivation
In the past four or five years
sponsors have moved toward a
highly individualized personal
ism and away from any formal
or public position of authority.
Anyone familiar with this fact
will find it difficult to credit
the editorial's claim that sponsor
selection is fostering "a self-per
petuating homogeneity."
We believe that a careful con
sideration of conditions in fresh
man residences and the short
comings of the sponsor system
most forcefully indicates the
need for fully integrated hous
ing. It does not follow from this
that partial integration is better
than no integration at all, parti
cularly if it comes at the ex
pense of a sponsor system which
recognizes the problems of a
segregated freshman year.
The "Sponsor Reform" edi
torial which appeared in Mon
day's Daily was grounded in a
fundamental Misunderstanding
of the living situation in fresh
man residences and what spon
sors are doing there.
It describes the purpose of
sponsor selection as "determin
ing the type of upperclassmen
who can best mold the unform
ed freshman mind." The carica
ture reflects a lack of familiarity
with the extent of maturity and
self-awareness of freshmen and
with the kind of relationships
that have developed between
them and sponsors, particularly
in the past several years.
The sponsor bears the respon
sibility of a friend and an infor
mal teacher to the persons with
whom he is living. This does not
imply the impossible and pre
tentious role described in the
editorial, but it does represent
some real demands. To have any
significant effect on the quality
of life in a freshman residence,
a sponsor (or any upperclass
man) must accept a definite re

sponsibility for its members as
a primary concern. He must re
direct substantial time and en
ergy to them from academic
work and outside involvement.
It is highly doubtful that all
those upperclassmen who "would
just live with the freshmen"
would recognize such a respon
sibility, or would make the sac
rifices necessary to act on it if
they did.
The editorial's proposal bears
a close resemblance to a plan
suggested by Dean Gordon's
staff two years ago. The ASSU
Housing Commission observed
that under such an arrangement
. . . upperclassmen would es
sentially be guests whose
rooms happened to be in a
freshman dormitory. It is dif
ficult to understand what
would motivate upperclassmen
to accept such a position, or
why they would feel any dedi
cation to close personal inter
action with the freshmen in
an educational sense.
Experience in Lassen House
this year has demonstrated that
the mere presence of upperclass
men in a predominantly fresh
man residence does little to meet

the needs of freshmen or sat
isfy the desires of upperclass
men.
Freshman Problems
In the demonstration houses,
with more balanced ratios of in
tegration, it has become evident
that particular attention must be
given to the problems peculiar
to freshmen. To realize the in
tent of integration, upperclass
members of integrated houses
must accept a kind of personal
and educational responsibility
analogous to that of sponsors in
all-freshman residences.
The purpose of sponsor selec
tion is not to find intellectual
drill-instructors to mold fresh
men into men. The authoritarian
personality, regardless of spe
cific type, doesn't belong in a
place where personal power must
be used with a discretion that
can come only from caring in
a sensitive and intelligent way
for those around oneself, while
respecting their integrity and
one's own limitations. This is the
primary criterion of selection,
set in terms of each prospective
sponsor's understanding of him
self and the situation he intends
to enter.
