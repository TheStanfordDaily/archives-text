# Schools Teach Obedience Before Political Awareness
## 
### 
Citizenship training in public
schools fails to tell children how
they can legitimately influence
their government and is usually
nothing more than an attempt
to teach regard for the rules of
the school, a Stanford educator
has concluded.
Prof. Robert D. Hess, holder
of the Lee L. Jacks professor
ship in child education, arrived
at this thesis after testing 12,000
youngsters in grades two
through eight in all parts of the
U.S.
With a colleague, Prof. Judith
V. Torney of Illinois Institute
of Technology, he questioned
youngsters in the West, South,
North Central and Northwest
during December 1961 through
1962.
In each city, students in two
schools in working-class areas
and two schools in middle
class areas were tested.
Profs. Hess and Torney re
cently published their findings
In The Development of Political
Attitudes in Children.
"In contrast to its emphasis
on compliance," Prof. Hess
found, "the school curriculum
under-emphasizes the rights and
obligations of the citizen to par
ticipate in government.
"The school focuses on the
obligation and right to vote, but
does not offer the child sufficient
understanding of procedures
open to individuals for legiti
mately influencing the govern
ment. Nor, does it adequately
explain and emphasize the im
portance of group action to
achieve desirable ends."
Teachers, the study discov
ered, do not deal with partisan
ship or discuss the role and im
portance of conflict in the sys
tem—perhaps because of the
role of the school in the com
munity, or explicit or implicit
prohibitions against teaching
controversial topics, or in an

attempt to present political In
formation without bias.
"But in any case," the au
thors say, "it leaves the ele
mentary school child with in
adequate information at a
time when he is becoming
oriented toward the impor
i tance of political participar
tion."
"The school stresses ideal
norms and ignores the tougher,
less pleasant facts of political
life in the United States," the
surveyors agreed. "While it
would probably be unwise to
discuss political corruption in
early grades, the process of so
cialization should include a
somewhat more realistic view
of the operation of the political
system."
The authors point out in the
early grades youngsters look
upon government as benign and
friendly, perhaps because of its
inherent power. They early iden
tify with the U.S. as a great and
good country, perhaps the best
in the world. The policeman is
their friend and is here to help
them.
But, the author says, "by
teaching a myth of governmen
tal responsiveness to the aver
age voter, the school produces
an unjustified sense of confi
dence. The 'average' voter may
be ineffective because he has
been socialized to believe that
the citizen has more power than
is actually the case."
Thus, the authors found,
"the school stands out as the
central, salient, and dominant
force in the socialization of
the young child ... The influ
ence of the family is of course
considerable, but in our opin
ion much less than that &vS
sumed by many other re
searchers.
"The role played by the school
in this process suggests a need
for greater and more systematic
evaluation of the methods, cur

rlculum and timing of political
socialization.
"In the school curriculum, the
topics that' deal with civic edu
cation and the concepts that
deal with our democratic heri
tage are usually taught unsys
tematically.
"There has been relatively
little attempt to state which
concepts are basic to the oper
ation of the democratic sys
tem, and to teach these at an
early age in an effective man
ner.
"... a view of conflicts as a
dimension of behavior, a regard
for the rights of minorities, and
compliance to the majority rule
—these elements can be taught
and should result in more in
formed and rational political
attitudes and action," the au
thors declared.

Prof. Robert D. Hess, holder
of the Lee L. Jacks professor
ship in child education, arrived
at this thesis after testing 12,000
youngsters in grades two
through eight in all parts of the
U.S.
With a colleague, Prof. Judith
V. Torney of Illinois Institute
of Technology, he questioned
youngsters in the West, South,
North Central and Northwest
during December 1961 through
1962.
In each city, students in two
schools in working-class areas
and two schools in middle
class areas were tested.
Profs. Hess and Torney re
cently published their findings
In The Development of Political
Attitudes in Children.
"In contrast to its emphasis
on compliance," Prof. Hess
found, "the school curriculum
under-emphasizes the rights and
obligations of the citizen to par
ticipate in government.
"The school focuses on the
obligation and right to vote, but
does not offer the child sufficient
understanding of procedures
open to individuals for legiti
mately influencing the govern
ment. Nor, does it adequately
explain and emphasize the im
portance of group action to
achieve desirable ends."
Teachers, the study discov
ered, do not deal with partisan
ship or discuss the role and im
portance of conflict in the sys
tem—perhaps because of the
role of the school in the com
munity, or explicit or implicit
prohibitions against teaching
controversial topics, or in an

attempt to present political In
formation without bias.
"But in any case," the au
thors say, "it leaves the ele
mentary school child with in
adequate information at a
time when he is becoming
oriented toward the impor
i tance of political participar
tion."
"The school stresses ideal
norms and ignores the tougher,
less pleasant facts of political
life in the United States," the
surveyors agreed. "While it
would probably be unwise to
discuss political corruption in
early grades, the process of so
cialization should include a
somewhat more realistic view
of the operation of the political
system."
The authors point out in the
early grades youngsters look
upon government as benign and
friendly, perhaps because of its
inherent power. They early iden
tify with the U.S. as a great and
good country, perhaps the best
in the world. The policeman is
their friend and is here to help
them.
But, the author says, "by
teaching a myth of governmen
tal responsiveness to the aver
age voter, the school produces
an unjustified sense of confi
dence. The 'average' voter may
be ineffective because he has
been socialized to believe that
the citizen has more power than
is actually the case."
Thus, the authors found,
"the school stands out as the
central, salient, and dominant
force in the socialization of
the young child ... The influ
ence of the family is of course
considerable, but in our opin
ion much less than that &vS
