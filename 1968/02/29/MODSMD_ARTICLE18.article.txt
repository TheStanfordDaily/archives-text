# Congressmen Say
## Draft Change Unlikely 
### 
Several Congressmen have re
acted strongly to the Feb. 16
ruling on graduate deferments
by the National Security Coun
cil, but—in the midst of intensi
fied Vietnam fighting, an elec
tion year and some eight months
after enactment of draft legisla
tion—no Congressional ground
swell to alter the situation was
apparent.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D.,
Mass.) proposed a 15-point plan
which would include a lottery, a
uniform national standard for
classification and induction, lib
eralization of the Conscientious
Objector classification, preven
tion of the reclassification of
draft protesters, and limitation
of the director of Selective Ser
vice to a six-year term.
Rep. Lester L. Wolff (D., N Y.)
said the NSC decision "demon
strates a clear and potentially
dangerous failure to recognize
the priorities that confront this
nation." He recommended that
reserves be called to duty before
graduate students are drafted.
Rep. Theodore R. Kupfer
iruin (R.. N.Y.) said the deci
sion will "bankrupt" educa
tional institutions, that gradu
ate schools will suffer "irre
parable harm" and that socie
ty will "lose a generation of
scientists, teachers, jurists,
poets and philosophers."
In a letter to Selective Service
Director Lewis B. Hershey, re
leased Feb. 23, Rep. L. Mendel
Rivers (D., S.C.), chairman of
the House Armed Services Com
mittee, asked for an explanation
of why the Administration does
not presently plan to draft
youngest men first.
Rivers said the President, last
March, had indicated his inten
tion of adopting youngest-first
calls. "For reasons that are not
quite clear," Rivers said, "a de
cision was apparently made by
the President to either defer ac
tion on this recommendation or
abandon it altogether."

He asked Gen. Hershey to pro
vide the Armed Services Com
mittee with his "detailed views"
on the possibility of changing
the order of induction. Rivers
also suggested that graduate
students scheduled to be induct
ed be permitted to complete
their present academic semes
ters.
To draft a student in the mid
dle of a term, he said, would be
an unfortunate and unnecessary
hardship on him as well as the
planning of the university.
There was no immediate reply
from Gen. Hershey.
Earlier, in a CBS-TV inter
view (Feb. 20), Gen. Hershey
said he doubted the NSC rul
ing would have a serious Im
pact on colleges and universi
ties. He said that not all
teachers need to have a Ph.D.,
and that Thomas Edison and
Henry Ford "did a lot" with
almost no formal education.
Officials at both the National
Science Foundation and the U.S.
Office of Education predicted a
major impact on graduate
schools but said it was too soon
to learn how the NSC ruling will
affect the awarding of fellow
ships and traineeships adminis
tered by the two agencies.
Dr. Howard D. Kramer, of the
Division of Graduate Education
in Science a* the National Sci
ence Foundation, said "we are
prepared to save it for him, as
a matter of Federal policy" If a
graduate student holding an
NSF fellowship is drafted.
NSF traineeships, however,
"are another matter," he said,
because these are awarded lo
cally. He said these presumably
would be awarded by institu
tions to those qualified and
available.
A USOE official, who asked

not to be identified, said "the
best estimate we have" is that
the enrollment In the first two
years of graduate schools will
be cut by about 60 percent, i
and over-all graduate enroll
ment by 40 percent. How this
will affect graduate fellow
ships, he said, "remains to be
seen." He said he believed
there would be "a tendency to
seek out those for fellowships
who are not eligible for the
draft."
He said he favored "forward
funding" so that an institution
could guarantee a fellowship. At
the present, he said, "there is no
clear legislation."
USOE announced, meanwhile,
it has allocated 1,500 Prospective
Teacher Fellowships for the
1968-69 academic year under Ti
tle V-C of the Higher Education
Act of 1965. The awards, made
by institutions, provide up to
two years of full-time graduate
study leading to an advanced
degree other than the doctorate.
The new allocations plus 806
fellowships awarded last year
will bring the total in force to
2,306, slightly less than the
2,336 in effect last year. Cost
of the program in the current
fiscal year will be about $12.5
million. Awards are being made
to 173 institutions for use in 273
programs. Submitting requests
were 491 programs for 7,085 fel
lowships.
