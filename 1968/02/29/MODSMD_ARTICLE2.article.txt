# Shumway On Transplants
## M.D. Lists Problems 
### 
Dr. Norman Shumway, the
physician who performed the
heart transplant operation here
last month, explained to nearly
200 pre-med students Tuesday
night the history and develop
ment of the heart transplant op
eration.
Slightly-sunburned and relax
ed, Shumway enumerated the
remaining problems in trans
plants as:
• Graft preservation,
• Post-transplant support of
heart circulation.
• Identification of rejection
crises,
• Selection t)f cases for trans
plantation,
• Selection and preservation
of donor,
• Homograft preservation

(from one person to another,
not identical twins).
Shumway answered the criti
cism that heart transplants were
a "novelty". He said, "Heart
transplants are no more of a
novelty than open heart surgery
was 15 years ago.
"The same people were saying
'it won't work' then."
The speech to members of the
pre-med society Sigma Phi Sig
ma and other students was
Shumway's first public speech
since he grimly informed report
ers Sunday morning, January
21, of the details surrounding
Mike Kasperak's death.
In regard to performing trans
plants on people who have oth
er health problems besides the
heart (specifically referring to
the Kasperak case), Shumway

speculated that "It may be that
anyone sick enough to have a
transplant (performed) may be
too sick to live with a new
heart."
He said that transplants were
still considered a clinical techni
que rather than therapy. He con
trasted this with Dr. Christian
Barnard's transplant work in
South Africa. He said that a
heart attack is not sufficient
cause to perform a transplant
"because you and I know many
people alive today who have had
coronaries."
Shumway also announced
there was only "very minimal,
microscopic evidence of rejec
tion" of the heart in the Kasper
ak case.
He discussed the problem of
obtaining donors and remarked
that there were two types. One
who suffers irreparable brain
damage and will not live longer
than a few days, and "chronic
donors," who are sick and are
going to die soon and "could
come into the hospital to die."
Shumway said that he would
prefer the chronic donor so that
they could make the decision
about donating their heart rather
than obtaining the permission
of the next of kin.

not identical twins).
Shumway answered the criti
cism that heart transplants were
a "novelty". He said, "Heart
transplants are no more of a
novelty than open heart surgery
was 15 years ago.
"The same people were saying
'it won't work' then."
The speech to members of the
pre-med society Sigma Phi Sig
ma and other students was
Shumway's first public speech
since he grimly informed report
ers Sunday morning, January
21, of the details surrounding
Mike Kasperak's death.
In regard to performing trans
plants on people who have oth
er health problems besides the
heart (specifically referring to
the Kasperak case), Shumway

speculated that "It may be that
anyone sick enough to have a
transplant (performed) may be
too sick to live with a new
heart."
He said that transplants were
still considered a clinical techni
que rather than therapy. He con
trasted this with Dr. Christian
Barnard's transplant work in
South Africa. He said that a
heart attack is not sufficient
cause to perform a transplant
"because you and I know many
people alive today who have had
coronaries."
Shumway also announced
there was only "very minimal,
microscopic evidence of rejec
tion" of the heart in the Kasper
ak case.
He discussed the problem of
obtaining donors and remarked
that there were two types. One
who suffers irreparable brain
damage and will not live longer
than a few days, and "chronic
donors," who are sick and are
going to die soon and "could
come into the hospital to die."
Shumway said that he would
prefer the chronic donor so that
they could make the decision
about donating their heart rather
than obtaining the permission
of the next of kin.
Dr. Norman Shumway, the
physician who performed the
heart transplant operation here
last month, explained to nearly
200 pre-med students Tuesday
night the history and develop
ment of the heart transplant op
eration.
Slightly-sunburned and relax
ed, Shumway enumerated the
remaining problems in trans
plants as:
• Graft preservation,
• Post-transplant support of
heart circulation.
• Identification of rejection
crises,
• Selection t)f cases for trans
plantation,
• Selection and preservation
of donor,
• Homograft preservation

(from one person to another,
not identical twins).
