# Judicial Council
## CIA Protest Opinion 
### 
(Why did the student Judicial Council
acquit nine students who were accused of
Illegally demonstrating- against the Central
Intelligence Agency last Nov. 1? There was
no question on the facts of the case. No one
doubted that a sometimes noisy demonstra
tion took place at Encina Hall, and that these
nine took part in it. The dean of students had
pictures to prove it, and the defendants them
selves did not deny it)
(Yet the council found them all not guilty,
and by doing so outraged a number of stu
dents, faculty and administrators. The tension
is strong between the ASSU loft and the
dean's office, reaching beyond even to Build
ing 10. Most of the criticism of the council's
decision, especially among those not directly
involved in the case, is by necessity unin
formed, since the council's reasoning has not
been set forth in detail.
(The following 10,000 words, the full text
of the council's opinions, should help to bring
the issues into clear focus.)
OPINION OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL
Eric TREISMAN delivered an opinion in
which Rick STEWART and Lorie TARSHIS
joined:
I
THE UNIVERSITY POLICY on Campus
Demonstrations, which was approved by the
Committee on University Policy on June 3,
1964, provides as follows:
**'Campus demonstrations may be con
ducted in areas which are generally avail
able to the public, provided such demon
strations:
1. Are conducted in an orderly manner;
2. Do not interfere with vehicular or
pedestrian traffic;
3. Do not interfere with classes, sched
uled meetings and ceremonies; or
with other educational processes of
the University;
4. Are not held (a) within University
buildings; (b) within University sta
dia, amphitheaters or fields while
University functions are in progress
therein; or (c) in private residential
areas of the campus."
The policy, on its face, abridges the right to
speak freely, to assemble peaceably and to
petition the government for a redress of griev
ances. It purports, however, not to limit the
content of speech, for which we would strike
it down without hesitation, but the form. The
policy does not tell us what we may and may
not say, for what purposes we may assemble,
or on what matters we may seek government
al relief. It tells us how we may express our
selves, where we may assemble, and when we
may protest. There is, of course, nothing ille
gitimate or unreasonable, in principle, with
the latter sort of regulation. We have a sub
stantial and perfectly justifiable interest in
"maintaining on the campus an atmosphere
conducive to academic work."
There is no categorical reason why the Uni
versity should not be able to formulate rules
which, although affecting speech, are intended
to prevent disorder, preserve dialogue, and pro
tect private rights. Such rules, however, must
not wantonly or clumsily trespass upon the
sanctuary of free expression. Our First
Amendment freedoms are fragilely fine and
must be closely sheltered against abuse. So,
when a rule governing the form of exercise
of those freedoms is made and sought to be
enforced, we will regard it with the utmost
circumspection. We will look to see whether it
accomplishes its permissible purposes by the
narrowest practical means and does not result
in prohibitions beyond its sanctioned scope.
The University Policy in question does not
forbid all disorder, all interference with traf
fic, all interuptions of classes, or all irregular
conduct within University buildings. It forbids
only such disorder, etc., as takes place in the
course of a demonstration. Understanding
what is meant by the word "demonstration,"
then, is the key to interpreting the Policy.
"Demonstration" does not have a plain mean
ing. The Policy does not define the word, nor
does other University policy, nor the ASSU
Constitution or By-Laws, nor our precedents.
Webster's Third International Dictionary de
fines the term, in the relevant sense, as fol
lows:
4.: A public display of group feeling (as
of approval, sympathy, or antagon
ism) esp. towards a person, cause, or
action of public interest.
Let us see where this leads us.
THE VICE-PRESIDENT of the United
States last year paid a visit to Stanford. A
large group of students and teachers, intend
ing publicly to display their antagonism to
ward him or toward an action of public inter
est, greeted his appearance on the stage of
Memorial Auditorium with silence. As the
Dean of Students forthrightly acknowledged
at our hearing in this case, it is arguable that
this expression of dissent was a "demonstra
tion within a University building" and, hence,
a violation of the Policy on Campus Demon
strations.
It goes without saying that the University
has no interest in regulating forms of expres
sion sufficient to justify a prohibition of "con
spiracies of silence," even in the presence of
national leaders, or, to put the matter more
strongly, it would be a flagrant abridgement
of Constitutional rights for the University to
attempt to compel those who are not inclined
to do so to applaud its guests.
If the Demonstration Policy should encom
pass displays of group feelings of this sort,
it is overbroad. If it does not, then more prob
ably it would include the sort of display that
followed the non-applause, to wit: a walk-out
by a large portion of the audience, which oc
curred between the Vice-President's speech
and a question-and-answer period. And here,
too we think that the Policy would sweep too
broadly.
In any case, whether overbroad or not, the
Policy is indisputably vague. It does not tell
us, with any degree of specificity whatsoever,
what kind of conduct is to be considered a
demonstration. Vagueness is a species of over
broadness. When a potential protester cannot
determine whether his protest will be deemed
a demonstration forbidden by a vague rule, he
will be inclined, in order to stay within the
bounds of permitted conduct, to allow himself
a wide margin for error. He will forego acts

that might be forbidden by the rule but which
the rule cannot, on pain of overbroadness, for
bid. Thus the vague rule is, in effect, over
broad. It encroaches, unawares, as it were,
upon an area protected by the First Amend
ment.
However that all may be, one may say, it is
clear that the actions of the defendants in this
case were a demonstration. But this argument
is beside the point, for we do not decide for
this case only but for all possible cases of this
type. We cannot allow a Policy to stand which,
although it perhaps may not reach out beyond
its permissible scope to include these defen
dants, will possibly, if continued in force, ex
pose to disciplinary action other students
whose conduct is protected and, more signifi
cantly, will inevitably deter perfectly privi
leged dissent.
We do not, however, decide this case purely
in the abstract, for there are, as we shall now
reveal, other defects of overbroadness and
vagueness in the Demonstration Policy which
are intimately tied to the facts of the demon
stration in question.
THE POLICY PROHIBITS demonstrations
that are, for example, disorderly. It does not,
in so many words, prohibit the disorderly con
duct of individual participants in an otherwise
orderly demonstration. It would be unreason
able to say that a demonstration is orderly so
long as some of the participants therein are
orderly. So we have to conclude that a demon
stration as a whole is disorderly if a certain
portion of the demonstrators are disorderly.
(The Policy does not tell us how many demon
strators must be disorderly before the demon
stration is itself disorderly.) Since the Policy,
as we have said, forbid disorderly demonstra
tions and not isolated acts of disorderliness,
even within a demonstration, it follows that
every participant in such a demonstration,
whether himself disorderly or not, could be
said to have violated the Policy. (If such is the
case, then we have before us a question of
unequal application of the Policy, for there
were in the instant demonstration participants,
known to the Administration, who were not
charged with a violation; but we do not deal
with this question because we find such inter
pretation of the Policy as would make it ap
plicable to orderly participants unacceptable,
for the following reason.) Because no other
interpretation of the Policy seems possible, it
is again overbroad. To punish one person, an
orderly demonstrator, for what another per
son, a disorderly demonstrator, does would be
a denial of due process of law. And it would
be an undue infringement of free expression
if one were deterred from participating, in
what one hoped would be an orderly demon
stration, for fear that another would incrimi
nate one by becoming disorderly.
The defendants here are charged with hav
ing participated in a demonstration that was
not conducted "in an orderly manner." The
Policy sets no standards by which we can de
cide whether or not their conduct was orderly.
A rule or law merely forbidding "disorderly
conduct" without reference to speech would
itself be highly suspect on account of vague
ness, and, a fortiori, a rule that prohibits the
disorderly exercise of First Amendment rights,
without more, is acutely infected with the vec
tor of vagueness.
The Policy proscribes demonstrations which
"interfere with vehicular or pedestrian traffic."
It is fairly obvious that what this provision
means is that demonstrators must not block
the street or adjoining sidewalks. "Pedestrian"
is ordinarily used to refer to a person afoot
in or about the street; although etymologically
the word may refer to anyone afoot, we usual
ly do not speak of someone walking, say, in
side a building as a pedestrian; the additional
word "traffic" clinches this interpretation.
There should be no problem of vagueness here,
but one has been imported by the Administra
tion in charging the defendants with having
interfered with pedestrian traffic, even though
they are not alleged to have demonstrated in
or near the street. Because we are unwilling
to say that the Administration's interpretation
of the prohibition in question is wholly un
reasonable, we must note a problem of vague
ness. It should be said, too, that there is a
question of overbroadness, for it is difficult to
see how any demonstration could fail, on the
Administration's interpretation, to interfere
with someone who wished to walk from one
side of it to the other.
We should note, too, that there is vagueness
in the word "interfere." The Policy does not
tell us just what kind or degree of interference
constitutes a violation. During our hearing in
this case, one of the defendants testified that
he intended his mere presence in the demon
stration to interfere psychologically with the
intentions of CIA-interviewees. Is that inter
ference as contemplated by the Policy, or is
something more needed? How much more? Of
what?
DEMONSTRATIONS, according to the Pol
icy, must not "interfere with classes, sched
uled meetings and ceremonies, or with other
educational processes of the University." We
may assume that it is reasonable, eminently
so in fact, for the University to seek to pre
vent interference with "classes," and perhaps
also with "ceremonies." Insofar as "scheduled
meetings" are concerned, however, there are
two sorts of difficulties. One is with the mean
ing of the phrase. It appears that "scheduled
meetings" is qualified by the phrase "other
educational processes of the University." One
must not interfere, that is, with such sched
uled meetings as are educational processes of
the University. But what is an educational
process? Is a scheduled meeting of the ASSU
Legislature an educational process? Is a job
interview with a representative of the CIA an
educational process? How so? We are not told.
And what, for that matter, is a meeting? If
one person arranges with another to meet him
at a certain place to discuss a test and finds
the place jammed with demonstrators, has a
scheduled meeting, part of the educational
process, been interfered with?
The other difficulty with the phrase "sched
uled meetings" is shared by that provision of
the Policy which rules out demonstrations
that are held within University buildings, with
in stadia, amphitheaters or fields (while Uni
versity functions—what is a University func
tion?—are in progress therein), or in private
residential areas of the campus. We do not
have to treat at length with the problems
raised by this provision. It is sufficient to ask
the following obviously loaded questions:
Could the Alabama legislature constitutionally
pass a law forbidding demonstrations which in
any way interfere with scheduled meetings of
the Ku Klux Klan? Could a small Louisiana
town, consistent with the First Amendment,
punish a Negro for his accusatory presence in
a segregated public library? Could the Presi
dent of San Jose State College suspend a
group of students who, bearing placards, dis
tributed leaflets at a football game, protesting
discrimination against Black athletes? Could

the governor of Illinois, except in the face of
mass violence, call out the National Guard to
forbid the entry into the private residential
areas of Cicero by marchers seeking inte
grated housing? We admit that the answers to
these questions are not open and shut, but that
is all we need to show. We phrase the ques
tions in terms of racial discrimination not in
order to pre empt the issue but, in fact, for an
heuristic purpose. We, speaking generally,
recognize the right to demonstrate against
segregation, even around scheduled meetings,
in public buildings and stadia, and in private
neighborhoods. We fail to perceive any
thoroughgoing distinction between segregation
and other evils, such as to justify demonstra
tions of this sort against one and not against
the other. Racial discrimination, on a con
scious level, may not be a serious problem at
Stanford, relatively speaking:, but there are
here and in the society of which we are a part
other evils, arguably even more vicious, and
we believe that the University can no sooner
cut off or cut short the right to protest them
than other agenfries of a governmental char
acter could pass such sweeping restrictions on
the form of expression.
This is not to say that the University cannot
prevent any interference with scheduled meet
ings, simply that it cannot prevent all such
interference. It is not to say that the Univer
sity cannot make reasonable regulations as to
the place and manner of protest, it is to say
that the University cannot absolutely immu
nize certain activities or locations from ex
posure to all forms of "demonstrative" dis
sent. The Policy is, in still another respect, un
constitutionally overbroad.
THERE ARE AT LEAST three objections to
the approach that we have taken toward the
University policy on Campus Demonstrations.
One is that, although the Policy may be inter
preted so as to appear overboard and vaRU'?.
the Council should construe it in such a way
as to bring it within constitutional bounds.
The short answer to this objection is that even
if we were able to put a constitutional con
struction on the Policy, to do so would require
a complete re-writing, and we do not believe
that the making of University policy is the
function of the Judicidl Council.
The second objection is that we have before
us conduct which itself infringed free expres
sion, and it is inappropriate that we should
call upon the right of free speech in defense
of such action. The answer is that even if the
conduct in question infringed free speech (and
we do not say that it did) and even if we were
defending that conduct (and we are not), we
could not punish one infringement by means
of another. Two wrongs do not make a right.
The third objection to our approach is that
the Council is not a court of constitutional
adjudication. Another objection, so closely re
lated to this one as to be practically the same,
is that the University, being a private institu
tion, is not bound in its policy-making capacity
by constitutional principles. There are at least
four sufficient answers to this objection.
(1) Article I, Section 1, C, 1, of the ASSU
By-Laws provides that "Stanford students
have the right to provide for their own regu
lations by means of a judicial system incorpo
rating traditional and accepted safeguards of
individual liberties." This right is reaffirmed
by Paragraph 3, a, of the Tri-Partite Compact
(see concurring opinion of Richard SUCH).
We are bound in our decisions, and the parties
to the Compact are bound in their policy-mak
ing capacities, to uphold the traditional and
accepted safeguard of individual liberties par
excellence, the First Amendment.
(2) We cannot separate our roles as citizens
in a democracy from our roles as judges of
student conduct. It would be hypocritical in
the extreme, not to say morally schizophrenic,
to demand observance of constitutional liber
ties in public affairs and to ignore those liber
ties in our quasi-private affairs. There is no
surer way of bringing about a dilution of First
Amendment freedoms outside our jurisdiction
than to thin them down within it. The duty
strictly to follow constitutional standards is
especially compelling within a University, to
which the outside world looks for a correct
enunciation and application of those standards.
That the so-called Interim Judicial Body does
not take this view in its decisions is to us only
an occasion for dismay.
(3) We should have to apply what would
amount to constitutional principles even if
there were no Constitution. Freedom of ex
pression, the uninhibited interchange and con
frontation of ideas, the unconstrained moral
as well as scientific evamination and eval
uation of society and the world are the very
essence of a University. Society may consider
our freedom to be license, our ideas dangerous,
our judgments preposterous, and we are de
pendent on society (to f a degree that has been
highly exaggerated), but everytime that we,
for financial or other reasons, attempt to in
'ratiate ourselves to society by darning or
re-channeling the free flow of ideas we become
less a fount of knowledge and more a mill
stream. Perhaps it is because we have gone
so far in that direction already that the con
duct now before us is looked upon, from some
quarters, with such seriousness, or that the
occasion for that conduct arose at all. In any
case, we re-affirm the fundamental principle
that if there is a right anywhere to speak
freely, to assemble peaceably, and to petition
for a redress of grievances, it is here. And
if anyone can tolerate an unaggravated abuse
of those rights, it is we. We expect to be re
lentlessly assailed with speech and conduct of
the most agitating and unnerving sort—it is
our way of life. Any unreasonable limitation
on expression strikes a deadly blow at what
we are about. Wherever in this opinion, there
fore, we speak of "First Amendment free
doms,'' "constitutional rights," and so on, one
may read "the freedom of expression inherent
in the idea of a University" and the meaning
will be the same, or stronger.
(4) The First Amendment, as the other
provisions of the Bill of Rights, is generally
said to apply only to "state action." "State"
is, of course, understood to refer to any gov
ernmental agency. The First Amendment does
not, for example, prohibit a father from silenc
ing his children, for his action is not the
action of government. Nor does the Amend
ment say that the owner of a private business
may not ban political activity in the company
cafeteria, because a commercial enterprise is
not an agent of the state. Stanford is not, nor
are we, strictly speaking, a public body. It
does not follow, however, that the University
is a purely private organization, like a family
or a corporation. Stanford is chartered by the
State of California, which exempts it from
taxation; it is a creature of the State, and a
specially privileged one. Although governed
ultimately in an essentially medieval manner,
Stanford has all the trappings of a modern
governmental entity: an Academic Council, an
Executive, Legislature and Judiciary elected
by the students, a Constitution approved by

the student body, By-Lawi passed by the
Legislature, a police force, special traffic and
parking regulations, public thoroughfares, a
fire department, elementary schools, a post
office, and so on. The University has opened its
facilities to the public at large. It performs a
function of benefit to the public; it can even
b' 1 saM that the University, in educating Cali
fornia residents, takes upon itself a burden
that the State would otherwise have to bear
Most importantly, Stanford in fact governs; it
regulates not only the academic but also the
rivate behavior of more than twelve thous
and individuals; it punishes misbehavior. The
very act of our writing this opinion has a gov
ernmental character. If a label is needed, then
we would say that Stanford is a quasi-gov
ernmental agency; it is affected with the pub
lic interest. That the University and its agen
cies, in the exercise of their quasi-govern
mental powers, are bound by constitutional
restrictions on state action is a proposition
that cannot lightly be dismissed.
WE FIND that the University Policy on Cam
pus Demonstrations is, in the respects men
tioned above, overbroad and vague. We find
that, because of its overbreadth and vague
ness, the Policy violates the First Amendment
and the freedom of expression inherent in the
idea of a University. We therefore hold the
Policy to be entirely unenforceable in this case
and in any case that may come before us.
We wish to make it clear that we do not rule
out the possibility that the University may be
able to make a new Policy which will protect
the legitimate and reasonable interests of the
community and which will not be subject to
the objections that we have raised above. We
should, however, enter the following caveat:
the Tri-Partite Compact provides that "all Uni
versity constituencies are entitled to express
their views prior to the formulation of Uni
versity policies respecting matters in which
they have a legitimate interest."
In the absence of such a Policy, we should
point out, those interests are not unprotected.
The University has access to the criminal law
of the State, and, although bringing that law
to bear has disadvantages from several points
of view, it has the advantage of not carrying
with it the full onus of moral disapprobation
that is implicit in our decisions. There is also
available, in certain cases, the protection of
the Fundamental Standard.
All members of the Council joining in this
Part of the Opinion of the Council, the de
fendants are NOT GUILTY of violating' Uni
versity Policy on Campus Demonstrations.
n
THE DEFENDANTS were not charged with
violating the Fundamental Standard. We are
obligated, however, in every case that comes
before us, to inquire as to whether or not
that Standard has been violated.
Under the Fundamental Standard, the
charge, insofar as it stems from violation
of the University Policy, meets the same in
surmountable objections as does the charge
under the University Policy itself. Insofar
as it stems from the general considerations of
Part A of the Fundamental Standard, it de
mands a determination beyond the competence
of this council (see the concurring opinion of
Richard Such). But there is also a specific
charge of Fundamental Standard dimensions
that has been levelled against these defend
ants: that by causing the front door of Encina
Hall to be locked the demonstration, and thus
these defendants, interfered with the right of
another student; that is, with the right of one
Robert S. Bruch to be interviewed by the CIA.
(The two other "thwarted" interviewees had
never seriously contemplated CIA employ
ment; indeed, there was uncontradicted testi
mony that their intentions were to confront
the CIA interviewer with what they consid
ered to be the immorality of his position and
that their rights as they saw them had been
interfered with only by the University Admin
istration, if they had been interfered with at
all. On the basis of this uncontradicted testi
mony, the Council finds it unnecessary to con
sider any violation of the rights of these two.)
We have had no trouble In finding that such
a right was interfered with; but our determin
ation cannot stop there. At some ultimate
logical point, interference with some right is
necessary to the exercise of any right; thus
we find it imperative to examine the extent
of the interference, the cause of the interfer
ence, and the nature of the right interfered
with in this case.
On the facts, there can be no contention that
the extent of interference was more than
minimal. Bruch had been warned in advance
that the front door might be locked, and act
ing in accordance with previously-made ar
rangements he was forced to do no more than
make a phone call and walk to a side entrance
in order to get his interview. Had his parking
place been taken by an overtime or otherwise
unauthorized parker, Bruch would have been
no more put out. There was no evidence that
Bruch's way was blocked by the demonstrat
ors, or his person interfered with in any man
ner; we have a photograph of him standing
more or less calmly in front of the locked door.
The minimality of the defendants' interference
alone, of course, does not excuse them; it is
no justification for a violation that it be slight.
But it may be justification for the interference
with a right that it be done in the name of a
more important right, and that we find to be
the case here.
THOMAS I. EMERSON lists, in his book
Toward a General Theory of the First Amend
ment, four affirmative values in a policy of
free expression. The first is that of individual
self-fulfillment: thought and its communica
tion are the fountainhead of all expression of
the human personality and the basis of all in
dividual freedom. The second is that of attain
ing truth: given that the soundest judgments
are reached through considering every argu
ment on any given proposition, the suppres
sion of any opinion or expression of opinion
tends to foster error. The third is that of en
couraging participation in decision-making:
just as the truest judgment is attained
hrough consideration of every argument, the
most acceptable policy is attained with the
participation of everyone affected by such pol
icy, and the protection of expression is neces
sary to insure that participation. The fourth
is that of maintaining a balance between sta
bility and change; history has given us the
lesson which cannot be arrived at intuitively:
the suppression of expression of opinin de
stroys the orderings and saps the strength of
the society which engages in suppresion, with
out weakening the opinion sought to be sup
pressed. Emerson's first value is what might
be called the private interest in free expres
sion. The second, third, and fourth values are
the social, public, societal interest. There is
general agreement that the mere private value
in expression is outweighed by the interests of
society at large: thus pornography is illegal
unless it have "redeeming social value"; thus

Melkeljohn and other philosophers of the
First Amendment feel it protects only politl.
cal expression, with all other speech receiving
only the due process protection of the Fifth
and Fourteenth Amendments. This Is so de
spite the undeniably intimate interrelation of
public and private values in exprssion.
The interference with Bruch's interview
was an interference with what was essentially
his private interest in speech To penalize the
demonstrators for this interference would be
to penalize, and thus to interfere with, commu
nication and expression in the political realm
—communication, that is, in the highest public
interest. This is not to say that no political
demonstrator could be punished: a violent
demonstration could be of such social disutil
ity that its social value would be clearly out
weighed. But the demonstration in this case
did not approach violence. The right inter
fered with, although of undeniable social util
ity, seems to us to have had a social utility
not so great as that of the interfering demon
stration, and the interference itself was slight.
Under these circumstances, we cannot find
that the defendants have violated the Funda
mental Standard.
Because the Council is equally divided on
the issue raised by this Part of the Opinion
of the Council, Richard SUCH concurring
in the result, we find the defendants NOT
GUILTY of violating the Fundamental
Standard.
We should make it plain that we consider
only the Fundamental Standard questions
arising from interference with Bruch's right
to enter by the front door, which interference
was occasioned by a complex interaction be
tween representatives of the Administration
and the demonstrators, including the latters'
alleged unsuccessful attempt to prevent the
door, when opened, from being closed. No
other question of Fundamental Standard di
mensions was raised in the allegations or
proved at our hearing.

SEPARATE OPINIONS
Richard SUCH, concurring in the result in
Part II of the Opinion of the Council:
I CONCUR IN THE RESULT in Part II of
the Council's Opinion. Although I agree sub
stantially with practically everything that is
said in that Part of the Opinion, I believe, for
the reasons set forth below, that there are
dangers in the Council's approach to the Fun
damental Standard question. I am consoled in
that, because the Council is equally divided
in the result as to that question, none of the
answers proposed here has the force of prece
dent.
I
Article I, Section I, A and B of the ASSU
By-laws read as follows:
A. The Fundamental Standard is: Stu
dents are expected to show, both within and
without the University, such respect for
order, morality, personal honor, and the
rights of others as is demanded of good
citizens.
B. The Associated Students of Stanford
University recognize that the maintenance
of student rights and privileges depends
upon mature and responsible conduct. Fail
ure to observe the Fundamental Standard
may be grounds for expulsion from the
University. In partial interpretation of the
general requirements of the Fundamental
Standard, the Associated Students of Stan
ford University specifically recognize their
responsibility:
1. to condemn any action which is of
fensive to or jeopardizes the rights, privi
leges, and safety of others, and to main
tain good order in the University commu
nity;
2. to respect the property of the Uni
versity, other students, and the commu
nity as a whole;
3. to be cognizant of and to uphold
ASSU and University policies and regu
lations. . . .
4. To be cognizant of and to uphold
Federal and State law.
It is plain that the Fundamental Standard is
unlike an ordinary law. It does not proscribe
undesirable conduct of a specific sort but in
stead lays down a general affirmative moral
principle. It is analogous not to a rule like
"Do not steal" but to a rule like "Do unto
others . . . There are obvious shortcomings
to a judicial system based on such a Standard,
which are, primarily, a failure to provide po
tential offenders with adequate warning that
their conduct may be considered impermissible
and the lack of such touchstones of unper
mitted conduct as would promote efficient and
consistent judicial determinations. But an
elaborate Code, defining all possible offenses
with particularity, would not be a feasible
alternative to our Standard, even if we were
able to find one ready-made, for such a Code
could only be administered by lawyers. And,
furthermore, the Standard has an extraordi
nary advantage that a Code could not have
it allows us to be guided in our decisions not
by hard-and-fast rules of guilt or innocence
but by flexible criteria of right and wrong.
We should not lose sight of the fact, however,
that this advantage is purchased at the ex
pense of adequate warning to defendants and
clear decisional tests. Where the lack of such
warning and such tests work a particular in
justice to defendants that is not counterbal
anced by the advantage to them of a thor
oughgoing inquiry into all considerations rele
vant to a moral evaluation of their conduct
then, unless aggravating circumstances ap
pear, we ought to declare that the defendants
conduct is beyond the competent scope o
Fundamental Standard adjudication and judg(
it on the basis of relevant ASSU By-Laws oi
University policy, if any.
THE NOTION that some cases may lie be
yond the limits of a judicial system only ap
pears unfamiliar. The Law, unlike our sys
tem, values fair notice and efficient, consisten
decision-making above moral evaluation, and
