THEFT PROOF? â€” Stanford coed Anne Dick waits while Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity man
Mike Ashcraft places a registration tag on her bicycle. The fraternity will register bikes on White
Plaza from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. today. The tags help Stanford and neighboring police departments
to return bikes to their owners, and also certify ownership for insurance claims.
