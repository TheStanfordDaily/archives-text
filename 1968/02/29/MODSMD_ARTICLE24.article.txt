# Doctors Link Lung Disease To Redwood Tree Sawdust
## 
### 
A rare chronic lung disease
in humans has been linked to
California's giant redwood trees
(Sequoia sempervirens) by re
searchers at Stanford University
School of Medicine and Palo
Hospital.
The disease has an appropri
ate name — sequoiosis.
The cause of the lung con
dition has been traced to fun
gi in redwood sawdust The
condition was first identified
in a 38-year-old sawmill work
er with a four-year history of
unexplained lung disease. The
patient suffered shortness of
breath, coughed intensely, and
had lost 40 pounds. There was
also an inflammation in both
lungs. The patient had work
ed in the sawmill for 17 years.
Researchers believe the lung
condition is caused by a reaction
of the immune system of cer
tain individuals to the redwood
dust or fungal particles. Wood
dust has not been reported pre
viously as a factor in lung di
sease. But some respiratory ail
ments encountered frequently
among farm workers are known
to be caused by breathing of
organic dust. The most well
known of these is a farmer's

lung disease, associated with
moldy hay.
The Stanford researchers are
Drs. Herbert I. Cohen, Thomas
C. Merigan, Jon Kosek, and Fred
erick Eldridge. Their findings
were reported recently in the
American Journal of Medicine.
The work was supported in part
by the National Institutes of
Health, National Institute of Al
lergy and Infectious Diseases.
Tests have shown that inhaled
redwood sawdust found its way
into the alveoli, the tiny air sacs
in the lungs. There the minute
needle-shaped or irregular saw
dust particles provoked a tissue
reaction identical to that which
occurs in patients who have
breathed dust from maple bark,
moldy hay, mushrooms, and
other known organic substances,
the researchers said.
These dusts of vegetable ori
gin, added the researchers, con
tain fungi and the lung disease
is a result of an allergic reaction
to the fungal particles.
Further studies showed the
patient's serum contained more
antibodies — germ fighting sub
stances — against redwood fun
gus than did the serum of simi
larly exposed workers or a hos
pital patient control group. The

patient's antibodies were direct
ed against two types of fungi in
the redwood, the physicians said.
Studies also confirmed that
the immunologic reactions
seen in the sawmill worker,
did occur in laboratory ani
mals that werd exposed to red
wood sawdust.
The physicians said the pa
tient's condition improved
when he was removed from
the environment of the saw
mill.
No such fungus or antigenic
particles could be demonstrated
in pine, fir or boech sawdusts or
in the redwood bark in contrast
to the wood itself. However, ce
dar, mahogany, and ash contain
ed material almost identical to
the redwood sawdust fungus, the
physicians said.

in humans has been linked to
California's giant redwood trees
(Sequoia sempervirens) by re
searchers at Stanford University
School of Medicine and Palo
Hospital.
The disease has an appropri
ate name — sequoiosis.
The cause of the lung con
dition has been traced to fun
gi in redwood sawdust The
condition was first identified
in a 38-year-old sawmill work
er with a four-year history of
unexplained lung disease. The
patient suffered shortness of
breath, coughed intensely, and
had lost 40 pounds. There was
also an inflammation in both
lungs. The patient had work
ed in the sawmill for 17 years.
Researchers believe the lung
condition is caused by a reaction
of the immune system of cer
tain individuals to the redwood
dust or fungal particles. Wood
dust has not been reported pre
viously as a factor in lung di
sease. But some respiratory ail
ments encountered frequently
among farm workers are known
to be caused by breathing of
organic dust. The most well
known of these is a farmer's

lung disease, associated with
moldy hay.
The Stanford researchers are
Drs. Herbert I. Cohen, Thomas
C. Merigan, Jon Kosek, and Fred
erick Eldridge. Their findings
were reported recently in the
American Journal of Medicine.
The work was supported in part
by the National Institutes of
Health, National Institute of Al
lergy and Infectious Diseases.
Tests have shown that inhaled
redwood sawdust found its way
into the alveoli, the tiny air sacs
in the lungs. There the minute
needle-shaped or irregular saw
dust particles provoked a tissue
reaction identical to that which
occurs in patients who have
breathed dust from maple bark,
moldy hay, mushrooms, and
other known organic substances,
the researchers said.
These dusts of vegetable ori
gin, added the researchers, con
tain fungi and the lung disease
is a result of an allergic reaction
to the fungal particles.
Further studies showed the
patient's serum contained more
antibodies — germ fighting sub
stances — against redwood fun
gus than did the serum of simi
larly exposed workers or a hos
pital patient control group. The

patient's antibodies were direct
ed against two types of fungi in
the redwood, the physicians said.
Studies also confirmed that
the immunologic reactions
seen in the sawmill worker,
did occur in laboratory ani
mals that werd exposed to red
wood sawdust.
The physicians said the pa
tient's condition improved
when he was removed from
the environment of the saw
mill.
No such fungus or antigenic
particles could be demonstrated
in pine, fir or boech sawdusts or
in the redwood bark in contrast
to the wood itself. However, ce
dar, mahogany, and ash contain
ed material almost identical to
the redwood sawdust fungus, the
physicians said.
