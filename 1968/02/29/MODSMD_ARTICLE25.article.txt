# Sociologist Sees
## No Great Changes In Family 
### 
The chairman of Stanford's so
ciology department told a capac
ity audience in Tresidder Tues
day evening that he expects vir
tually no change in the nature
of the family over the next half
century.
Prof. Morris Zelditch, speak
ing on "The Future of the Fam
ily as an Institution," one of the
continuing series of Century 21
lectures, said that, while pro
vocative forecasts of radical al
teration of family structure
would be more entertaining than
a reiteration of the status quo,
he saw "no reason for such pre
dictions."
Although his overall view is
that "the basic picture will re
main relatively stable," Zel
ditch sees an increasing num
ber of women entering the la
bor force. This will not appre
ciably affect the traditional
feminine functions of wife
and mother, he said, but mere
ly create a wider spectrum of
sociological roles which wom
en can and will fill.
The only "profound change"
Zelditch anticipates will take
place among low-income Negro
families. As color becomes less
significant as a criterion for em
ployment, increasing numbers of
Negro males will find secure po
sitions with reasonable advance
ment prospects and thus elimi
nate the traditional, matri-focal,
i.e., female oriented and domi
nated, unit from the American
gamut of family types.
Zelditch sees no real danger
of masculine and feminine roles
becoming assimilated into each
other as more women take jobs.
He said that women partici
pating in the labor force tend

to perform fewer masculine
tasks at home, and also pointed
out that women tend to assume
"feminine" positions when they
seek employment.
Further, only one woman in
five views her job as a career;
most working women do so
sporadically and with a view to
supplementing family income.
Zelditch admits that this will
result in some power transfer
within the family as women
take an increasingly important
role in major economic decisions
—"when you bring more money
into the house, you get more to
say on how it's spent."
Wives and mothers tend to
move in and out of the labor
force somewhat "erratically."
They tend to drop out with
young children and to rejoin
when the children can "be le
gitimately cared for by other
people."
American mothers seem to be
remarkably consistent in their
belief that children under six
need their "real" mother and
that this need diminishes to al
most zero as the child approach
es 18.
Zelditch dismisses the effect of
automation as "essentially trivi
al" in that it only reinforces al
ready extant trends toward an
increase of white collar jobs.
He maintains that the "abso
lutely inevitable" trend toward
equal employment will have a
far greater effect. Negro males
will be able to assume the func
tion of head of the household,
with two significant effects.
The general public will come
to see the matri-focal family as
a function of income rather than
race—such a family type Is

found among poor whites as
well as blacks and nowhere in
middle income groups; and the
type itself will become "relative
ly insignificant" throughout the
society.
In a question period follow
ing his discussion, Zelditch stat
ed that while interfaith mar
riages do not seem to be sharp
ly increasing, the chances of

their success are greater as
more and more couples move
away from their in-laws.
He added that interracial mar
riages will increase only as
smaller taboos break down over
a long period of time. However,
he sees "no way to arrest that
process" of racial equality, de
spite its glacial speed and ap
parent periodic setbacks.

most working women do so
sporadically and with a view to
supplementing family income.
Zelditch admits that this will
result in some power transfer
within the family as women
take an increasingly important
role in major economic decisions
—"when you bring more money
into the house, you get more to
say on how it's spent."
Wives and mothers tend to
move in and out of the labor
force somewhat "erratically."
They tend to drop out with
young children and to rejoin
when the children can "be le
gitimately cared for by other
people."
American mothers seem to be
remarkably consistent in their
belief that children under six
need their "real" mother and
that this need diminishes to al
most zero as the child approach
es 18.
Zelditch dismisses the effect of
automation as "essentially trivi
al" in that it only reinforces al
ready extant trends toward an
increase of white collar jobs.
He maintains that the "abso
lutely inevitable" trend toward
equal employment will have a
far greater effect. Negro males
will be able to assume the func
tion of head of the household,
with two significant effects.
The general public will come
to see the matri-focal family as
a function of income rather than
race—such a family type Is

found among poor whites as
well as blacks and nowhere in
middle income groups; and the
type itself will become "relative
ly insignificant" throughout the
society.
In a question period follow
ing his discussion, Zelditch stat
ed that while interfaith mar
riages do not seem to be sharp
ly increasing, the chances of

their success are greater as
more and more couples move
away from their in-laws.
He added that interracial mar
riages will increase only as
smaller taboos break down over
a long period of time. However,
he sees "no way to arrest that
process" of racial equality, de
spite its glacial speed and ap
parent periodic setbacks.
The chairman of Stanford's so
ciology department told a capac
ity audience in Tresidder Tues
day evening that he expects vir
tually no change in the nature
of the family over the next half
century.
Prof. Morris Zelditch, speak
ing on "The Future of the Fam
ily as an Institution," one of the
continuing series of Century 21
lectures, said that, while pro
vocative forecasts of radical al
teration of family structure
would be more entertaining than
a reiteration of the status quo,
he saw "no reason for such pre
dictions."
Although his overall view is
that "the basic picture will re
main relatively stable," Zel
ditch sees an increasing num
ber of women entering the la
bor force. This will not appre
ciably affect the traditional
feminine functions of wife
and mother, he said, but mere
ly create a wider spectrum of
sociological roles which wom
en can and will fill.
The only "profound change"
Zelditch anticipates will take
place among low-income Negro
families. As color becomes less
significant as a criterion for em
ployment, increasing numbers of
Negro males will find secure po
sitions with reasonable advance
ment prospects and thus elimi
nate the traditional, matri-focal,
i.e., female oriented and domi
nated, unit from the American
gamut of family types.
Zelditch sees no real danger
of masculine and feminine roles
becoming assimilated into each
other as more women take jobs.
He said that women partici
pating in the labor force tend

to perform fewer masculine
tasks at home, and also pointed
out that women tend to assume
"feminine" positions when they
seek employment.
Further, only one woman in
five views her job as a career;
most working women do so
