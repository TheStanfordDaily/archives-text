# 350 Sign Petition For More Blacks
## 
### 
Three hundred fifty members
of the Stanford community have
signed a petition asking for
drastically increased black ad
missions next year.
Addressed to the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
subcommittee on minority ad
missions, the petition asks that
disadvantaged blacks with "min
imal" ability to complete a Stan
ford education be admitted and
given special remedial tutoring
in order to insure that they
graduate.
The drive for the petition was
organized by Larry Pischoff and
Joe Reich, co-chairmen of the
Committee for Increased Black
Admissions.
The Petition was in support
of a proposal outlining five steps

which they said would enable
Stanford to increase its black
enrollment.
"We believe this number (350)
is significant, considering the
fact that we were able to con
tact such a small percenage of
the community," Pischoff and
Reich said in the letter accomp
anying the petition which was
addressed to Associate Provost
Robert Rosensv/eig, head of the
SES subcommittee.
Pischoff said the problem with
the petition drive was insuffici
ent manpower, and lack of or
ganization to obtain a better
showing of support for the peti
tion.
Two weeks ago, SES chair
man Herbert Packer replied to
a letter from Pischoff and Reich
by saying "changes of he order
of magnitude which you advo
cate can't be accomplished over
night."
