# Katz Urges Free Choice In University
## 
### MARGARET McGAUGHEY 
If the Stanford student has a
best friend, it could well be Dr.
Joseph Katz of the Institute for
the Study of Human Problems.
Katz recently completed a
Study of undergraduates at
Stanford and Berkeley from
which he concluded that uni
versities must provide more al
ternatives and more freedom of
choice if students are to make
the most of their individual tal
ents.

Katz looks toward a univers
ity which will have standards,
but will allow the individual to
learn to educate himself in his
own way. It might mean a situ
ation in which students were
not required to take classes at
all, but could use their time to
take advantage of university fa
cilities.
"The present concept of a uni
versity," Katz says "almost be
gins with Mamma. She thinks
if she is not with her kids all
the time, she is somehow being

remiss. If she only left them
alone, they might develop spon
taneously."
The university, he feels, is
a kind of "Big Mamma." It
thinks it must always be present,
always check up on students
with day-to-day assignments,
periodic quizzes and exams.
"Implicit in all this is a kind
of distrust. You don't trust a
student to learn on his own."
But, Katz continued, if a stu
dent is not willing to work, no
amount of supervision is going
to make him learn. "Plato said
it rather well: 'Enforced learn
ing will not stay in the mind.' "
Katz places great importance
on the availability of a variety
of types of housing on a uni
versity. He pointed out that go
ing to colleges is often a pre
carious enough situation with
out the added frustration of un
satisfactory housing.
He feels that it is often better
to keep freshmen together in a
small group, perhaps something
like a Row House, but is quick
to add that "nothing should be
compulsory."
"Take a girl from a small
community in California who
goes to Berkeley. She wants to
join a sorority out of instinct.
She needs the closeness and
wants to be protected from the

unpersonal new environment.
Often, a sorority later becomes
confining, and the more adven
turous will move out. The task
of the university is to facilitate
leaving the clique."
Katz feels that forcing a stu
dent to live in a dormitory is
not going to achieve the group
identity or unity many educat
ors have hoped it will. Unity is
not just doing things together.
Individuals can go to class just
as individuals go to the movies.
Unity depends on sharing a
common task, on breaking down
barriers that keep people apart."
It is in the overseas campuses
that Katz finds this unity most
readily achieved. There, living
and travelling together provide
a sense of "common task" and
allow more intimacy to develop
of its own accord.
Katz knows students well. He
has been working with them for
over twenty years. Educated in
Switzerland, at the University of
Pennsylvania, and Columbia, he
has taught at Vassar, Ohio
State, Amherst, Cornell, and
Columbia.
Inquisitive and alert, he is the
type of adult who immediately
sets students a tease. His desk
on the second floor of the Insti
tute, located at the corner of
Lassuen and Mayfield, was piled

high with papers, and his phone
was constantly ringing, but Dr.
Katz always seemed unhurried,
interested, and willing to listen
as well as talk.
Between 1958 and 1960, Dr.
Katz was a research associate
in Psychiatry at Berkeley. Dur
ing this time he dealt with indi
vidual student psychological pa
tients.
"The difference between teach
ing a class and doing this is
enormous. When a patient
comes in, he has a definite prob
lem and is strongly motivated to
solve it. You and he are pulling
on the same team. In a class
room, however, even if you are
what is called a 'good teacher',
you don't really know how in
terested they are. You can tell
a little from how well they do
in papers . . . but you don't
know the last effects. Working
with a patient you are in a close
relationship on exact details.
You have a clearer sense of
what you are doing."
The survey of undergraduates
completed, Katz may soon em
bark on a study of graduates.
"Except for those in medicine,
no one has ever made a study
of graduate students. The Insti
tute likes problems which will
have relevance to people's
lives."
