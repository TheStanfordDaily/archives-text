HUE — A 24-year-old Stanford
graduate who spent most of 18
days hiding under a bed in
North Vietnamese-occupied Hue
was rescued ten days ago by
JJ.S. Marines.
- Chris Jenkins, class of '66,
.went to Hue Jan. 29 to spend
the Tet holiday with Vietnamese
friends. On the morning of Jan.
31 his friends told him there
were North Vietnamese soldiers
in the streets and hid him under
;a bed.
• "They were driving around in
jeeps and on motorbikes," Jen
kins said. "My friends told me
what they were doing. I stayed
hidden."
Jenkins, who works with youth
groups in Daiat and will end
'his two-year tour with the In
ternational Voluntary Services
in May, said he came to Vietnam
partly to pick up some first
hand experience of the mili
tary side of the war.
"I got more than I wanted,"
he said.
The North Vietnamese used

loudspeakers to tell the people
of Hue that they were in con
trol and would supply rice and
other supplies for anyone who
was short, Jenkins said. They
never entered the house where
he was.
He said the North Vietnamese
warned that American and South
Vietnamese troops would come
and the city would be a battle
field. The Communists urged the
people to dig bunkers.
Jenkins had about ten mem
bers of his friends' families
around him in the house in the
southeastern corner of Hue.
They had enough to eat and for
the first two weeks their neigh
borhood was quiet while under
control of the North Vietnamese.
"The family listened to the
radio, but it was more confus
ing than helpful," Jenkins said.
"Armed Forces Radio said that
only a few pockets in the city
were held by the enemy and
South Vietnamese troops were
advancing quickly. I was under
the bed and asked them, "What
do you mean?'"
The government's Hue radio
station, which is on the south
bank of the Perfume River that
divides Hue and was secured by
U.S. Marines in the first week,
was not very helpful either.
"The radio kept reporting
enemy casualties and saying
that the Communists were
committing atrocities against
Vietnamese civilians as they
were driven out of the city,"
Jenkins said. "Where I was,
everything was quiet."
"The BBC {British Broadcast
ing Corporation) gave the most
accurate news we could get,"
Jenkins said. They told us that
U.S. Marines were coming and
then the fighting started."
The first man Jenkins knew
had been killed was a member
of his friends' family who went
out of the house to pray in the
courtyard for his son, who had
been killed by the Vietcong three
months ago. The father was
struck by shrapnel from Amer
ican artillery or bombing.
Gradually, as the shelling of
Hue increased, more people
sought refuge in the house
with Jenkins and his Vietna
mese friends. Later he learned
that the Communists had kill
ed American civilians they
found in other parts of the
city, he said.
