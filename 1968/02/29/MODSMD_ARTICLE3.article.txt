# Poli Sci Prof Cites Middle East Needs
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
Political development in the
Middle East can lead to peace
only if "Middle Eastern institu
tions become strong enough to
divert nationalism, populism, an
ti-materialism, and irrationalism
into constructive human chan
nels," a University of Chicago
political science professor said
last night.
Dr. Leonard Binder cited three
"protests" in which the United
States is presently embroiled
which he claimed have wide in
ternational applications before
one hundred people in Tresid
der's large lounge. He suggested
the protests would aid under
standing political development
in the Middle East.
The first of these protests
which, in the Middle East,
"have grown out of the natural
ground of traditional Moslem
thought" is directed against
materialism.
"Middle East intellectuals have
deplored the advance of materi
alism and the decline of Mos
lem customs and traditions,"
Binder asserted.
He suggested that the Middle
East has developed a dichotomy
between the "materialism of the
West and the spiritualism of the
East" which has synthesized in
to "Arab socialism."

The second protest is the civil
rights movement. Binder empha
sized that as with the militant
Negro, "the Middle East search
for identity and dignity leads to
nationalism."
Binder declared that above
all, "political development in the
Middle East will depend upon the
development of nationalism."
The third protest, that di
rected against the Vietnam
war, can be compared to the
Middle East In that "a credi
bility gap arises from complex
problems" not being explained
"to the common voter."
Binder warned that many Mid
dle Eastern governments do not
have the support of the com
mon people, and that they lack
the "institutional strength" need
ed to develop strong and respon
sible governments.
He pointed out that some Mid
dle East countries do have
stronger institutions than oth
ers, however, mainly because of
Western imperialism and the
growth of a limited urban middle
class between World War I and
Warld War 11.
Binder explained what he
termed "a definition of political
development" in six steps. These
consisted of a nation acquiring:
a national identity, participation
by the people, wide income dis
tribution, bureaucratic penetra
tion into strong institutions, and
integration among diverse
groups.
He divided the Middle Eastern
nations into three groups depend
ing on their type of government
institutions. Morocco, Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Lybia and Kuwait main
tain traditional authority invest
ed in monarchies.
Countries that have made re
forms because of "the impact of
western imperialism in the 19th
Century" are Turkey, Egypt, Tu
nisia and Lebanon.
Countries possessing institu
tions acquired after World War
I are Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Sudan,
Algeria, and Israel.
Binder's speech was the third
in a series sponsored by the
Middle East Desk of the Institute
of International Relations.
