# Team Play Keys Success
## High-Flying Frosh Meet Spartans 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford's high-riding frosh
basketball team journeys to San
Jose State Saturday night, hop
ing to knock off the tough Spar
tan quintet for the second time.
Coach Paul Neumann's Pa
pooses have racked up 10 wins
in 13 contests so far this season,
with one of the wins a 77-67
thriller over the Spartan frosh
in the Stanford Pavilion.
In the victory over San Jose
State, "We played the game the
way it's supposed to be played,"
Neumann reflected. "Everybody
did his job. It was our best ef
fort of the season."
The big reason for Stan
ford's success so far this
year, as Neumann sees it, is
team play. "Everybody com
pliments each other and this
is the way a team should be,"
Neumann observed. "We have
no big cheeses; everyone just
does his Job."
A glance at the team's statis
tics seems to indicate that scor
ing is the job of guard Dennis
O'Neil and forward Mike Mi
chel. O'Neil is currently aver
aging just below 22 points per
game, while Michel is hitting at
a 17.5 clip for the year.
"Dennis does everything well,"
Neumann said in praise of his
6-2 star. "A coach couldn't ask
for anything more."
O'Neil earned All-Northern
California recognition last year
as a forward at nearby Bellar
mine Prep, but has effectively
made the switch to the back
court this year.
"Dennis is learning to adjust
to the guard spot," Neumann
stated. "He's starting plays, han
dling the ball well. He might
help us more at forward, but
we're playing him at guard in
consideration of his future on
the varsity."
Michel, at 6-6 '/i, is the

team's leading re bounder,
hauling in 11.5 caroms per
game. The high-scoring for
ward is another high school
star who has had to make an
adjustment upon reaching
Stanford.
"Mike played the pivot in high
school," Neumann related, "so
he's also making a big adjust
ment. He's a great shooter from
long range, and a real good
jumper. Mike has all the physi
cal abilities, and just has to put
it all together."
Forward Fred Green, center
Greg Bruce, and guard Alan
Christensen round out the start
ing five.
Green, who Neumann consid
ers to be the team's hardest
worker and finest defensive for
ward, is an aggressive 6-4, 180-
pounder who has missed the
team's last four games with a
fractured arm. Before his in
jury, Green was averaging near
ly 12 points and 8 rebounds per
game. In the event that Green
is not ready to go Saturday, 6-2
Lee Baumgartner will again

start in his place.
Bruce is another hard work
er who was originally given a
starting job "mainly because
of desire and hustle," in Neu
mann's words. But Bruce's ef
forts have produced results,
as the 6-5 pivotman has began
to find the shooting touch he
lacked at the start of the sea
son.
Christensen is not a scoring
threat, but makes his contribu
tion as a playmaker and defen
sive specialist. The 5-10 speed
ster is usually given the assign
ment of stopping the opposi
tion's leading scorer.
Neumann, in his first year of
coaching after six fine years in
the NBA (four with the San
Francisco Warriors), has tried
to stress defense. "There's no
glory in it,"he admitted, "and
it's got to be an individual thing.
But if you've got some players
who take pride in it, they can
make the difference between a
winning and losing ballclub."
Neumann's defense- minded
squad is 10-3.
