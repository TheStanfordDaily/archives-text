# Pacific-Eight Swim Meet-Stepping Stone To NCAA's?
## 
### 
Stanford swimmers enter the
AAWU championships at the
University of Washington today.
USC figures to win its eighth
straight Pac-8 title on the basis
of the Trojans' overloaded
bench. UCLA will make some
troublesome waves.
Stanford and USC will be
"swimming through" the con
ference championships, that is,
neither team will cut its work
out load significantly before the
meet.
Tapering the workout load
this far before the NCAA's Mar.
27-29 would produce some at
tractive times, but the loss of a
week's conditioning would be
too great a sacrifice.
Last season, USC came off
the 52-52 dual meet tie with
Stanford to pack home the
conference title by 60 points.
Stanford was saving l Its eggs
for the big basket, however,
and the Indians upset the Tro
jans in the NCAA champion
ships.
The conference meet last year
was a frustrating tale. In the
200 individual medley, Dick Roth
and Pete Siebert took first and
second, but USC snapped up the
next five places to outscore the
Cards. The Trojan depth carried
USC through the conference

meet, but did not weather the
stiffer challenge of national
competition.
USC returns this year with
the same depth and an array of
outstanding individuals from
last year's frosh team, so the
Cards are saving their upset
hopes for the NCAA's.

The conference meet last year
was a frustrating tale. In the
200 individual medley, Dick Roth
and Pete Siebert took first and
second, but USC snapped up the
next five places to outscore the
Cards. The Trojan depth carried
USC through the conference

meet, but did not weather the
stiffer challenge of national
competition.
USC returns this year with
the same depth and an array of
outstanding individuals from
last year's frosh team, so the
Cards are saving their upset
hopes for the NCAA's.

Stanford swimmers enter the
AAWU championships at the
University of Washington today.
USC figures to win its eighth
straight Pac-8 title on the basis
of the Trojans' overloaded
bench. UCLA will make some
troublesome waves.
Stanford and USC will be
"swimming through" the con
ference championships, that is,
neither team will cut its work
out load significantly before the
meet.
Tapering the workout load
this far before the NCAA's Mar.
27-29 would produce some at
tractive times, but the loss of a
week's conditioning would be
too great a sacrifice.
Last season, USC came off
the 52-52 dual meet tie with
Stanford to pack home the
conference title by 60 points.
Stanford was saving l Its eggs
for the big basket, however,
and the Indians upset the Tro
jans in the NCAA champion
ships.
The conference meet last year
was a frustrating tale. In the
200 individual medley, Dick Roth
and Pete Siebert took first and
second, but USC snapped up the
next five places to outscore the
Cards. The Trojan depth carried
USC through the conference

meet, but did not weather the
stiffer challenge of national
competition.
USC returns this year with
the same depth and an array of
outstanding individuals from
last year's frosh team, so the
Cards are saving their upset
hopes for the NCAA's.
