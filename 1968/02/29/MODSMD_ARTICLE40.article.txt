# Shockley Debates Ghetto Effect On IQ
## 
### 
Noting that Army I.Q. scores
have dropped six per cent for
blacks since World War I, Prof.
William Shockley, Stanford's
Nobel Prize-winning physicist,
expressed "fear" that ghetto life
is lowering the intelligence of
blacks.
Disputing this point in a panel
discussion at San Jose State Col
lege on Feb. 21 were Dr. Alvin
Poussaint, assistant professor
of psychiatry at Tufts Univer

sity Medical School, and Donald
Warden, national chairman of
the Afro-American Association.
Shockley contended that un
employed blacks have large
families which produce a pro
pensity toward unemploy
ment. Citing experiments with
fruit flies, he proposed eugen
ics as a solution to the race
problem. He suggested that
the eugenics experiments made
in Nazi Germany be consider
ed objectively.
Poussaint replied, "A San
Francisco newspaper called Dr.
Shockley a "blithering idiot".
After hearing him myself, I
have decided that the charge
was much too kind."
Poussaint noted that I.Q.
scores are not fixed, but change
able, and he maintained that they
are not related to native intelli
gence. Research cannot proper
ly be done without controlling
all other factors, he continued,
and asked what should be done
with low I.Q. white racists.
Warden, speaking from the
viewpoint of education, said
that the important aspect is
not I.Q. but performance.
What must be asked is what
is required for performance in
America, he maintained.
Pointing to hippies who, he
claimed, came from white mid
dle class families, he remarked,
"Either I.Q. is irrelevant or high
I.Q. makes for dangerous con
duct."
He then spoke of motivation
and education as essentials for
black improvement.
