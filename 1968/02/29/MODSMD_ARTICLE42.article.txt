WHOOSH! â€” If you were at Stanford's Winter Carnival, you might
have witnessed Clydia Cuykendall in the beer slalom, one of the
many activities sponsored by the Ski Club. Now the Stanford Ski
Club is offering weekend lodging and lift ticket reductions for all
Stanford students (including a special deal for two people 21 or
over) for $8.00. Tickets for each weekend will be on sale Thursday
from 12 to 5, starting today.
