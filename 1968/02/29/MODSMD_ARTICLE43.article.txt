## Arab Students Protest Bias

"Condemnation of all policies of
racial discrimination and subju
gation of peoples such as that
practiced in Rhodesia, South Af
rica and the U.S." is the stated
purpose of a resolution recently
issued by the Organization of
Arab Students at Stanford.
The resolution emphasized an
alleged similarity between "Pal
estinian Arabs . . . and the
struggle of the Afro-American
in the U.S."
Claiming that the "Zionist in
vasion" is comparable to "a
power structure of racism and
oppression" in the United States,
the Arab students proclaimed
"unqualified support for our
brethren, the black people of
America."
The resolution asserted that
both the Arabs and American
Negroes "strive to achieve self
determination and human dig
nity," and demanded "black
leaders such as Huey Newton,
Rap Brown, Bob Seele, Cleve

land Sellers and all others be
set free immediately."
The document also called upon
the Arab governments to bring
"the oppressive conditions in the
United States" before the United
Nations and to lend internation
al support to "the legitimate
struggle of our black brothers."
The Arab students also noted
that ever since slavery was in
stituted in America, the Negroes
"have been subjected to the
most vicious form of brutality,
exploitation and oppression in
the history of man."
The resolution also claimed
American Negroes "have strug
gled heroically to maintain their
humanity and dignity through
the sacrifice of thousands of
their sons and daughters."
"As the struggle of oppressed
peoples both inside and outside
the United States is taking ever
increasing proportions," the
document said, "we notice that
the forces of racism and oppres

sion are getting increasingly
brutal."
