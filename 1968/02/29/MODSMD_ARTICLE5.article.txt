WASHINGTON (AP) — Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller said
Wednesday that he still was not
a candidate for the Republican
presidential nomination even
though Gov. George Romney
had stepped aside.
But his and his wife, Happy,
wore welcomed by Rockefeller
enthusiasts and newsmen at the
Governor's Conference recep
tion for members of Congress
like the star attractions.
"My position has not chang
ed," Rockefeller repeated to
newsmen. "I have no plans to
change my plans."
The New York governor said
he learned of Romney's inten
tion to withdraw last Friday
through members of Romney's
staff. This was one day before
Rockefeller answered at a news
conference that he would run
for President if he were to be
drafted at the Republican con
vention.

Romney, who had been at the
receiption, left about the same
time the Rockefellers arrived
and created a mini-mob scene.
Arriving with Rockefeller was
New Mexico's Republican Gov.
David F. Cargo.
When asked what he thought
about Romney's withdrawal, Car
go replied, "If you're talking
about the hottest thing going,
you're looking at it." He pointed
at Rockefeller.
