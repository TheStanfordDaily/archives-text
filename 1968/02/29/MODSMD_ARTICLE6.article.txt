# Legislature To Debate Judicial System Policy
## 
### 
The judicial system promises
to be the main topic of debate
at tonight's meeting of the stu
dent legislature (7:30 p.m., Room
320).
Several measures are expect
ed to be introduced. One is a
policy on campus demonstra
tions, details of which are not
yet known. The ASSU now has
no policy on demonstrations.
It is expected, however, that
the policy would fit within con
stitutional bounds discussed in
the recent Judicial Council de

cision on the case of the anti-
CIA demonstrators (see p. 5).
Also expected is a proposed
resolution directing the Judicial
Council not to turn tapes of the
recent hearings over to the In
terim Judicial Body, which has
decided to take an appeal from
the dean of students.
The legislature will be asked
to approve the appointment of
law student Eric Treisman to
the Committee of 15. He would
replace Maureen Kulbaitis, who
is resigning. Treisman is a mem
ber of the Judicial Council.
