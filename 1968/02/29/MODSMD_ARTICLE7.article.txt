# Trustee Says War Bad For Business
## 
### 
David Packard, Stanford trus
tee and chairman of the board
of the Palo Alto based Hewlett-
Packard Company, told the
firm's stockholders Tuesday that
the Vietnam war is hurting busi
ness.
Speaking to the annual share
owners' meeting, Packard said
that orders for some Hewlett-
Packard products have increased
due to the war. But these in
creases are outweighed by pro
grams which have been held up.
he said.
"We think we would be better
off if the Vietnam situation were
concluded," Packard said. "This
is certainly true from a business
viewpoint, even aside from other
considerations."
In a separate interview Wed
nesday, William Hewlett, presi
dent of the firm, said that sales
to universities have definitely
been hurt by the war.
"Government support to high
er education has not been going
forward as rapidly in the last
two or three years as it was pre

viously," Hewlett said.
He added that more money
would be spent on medical
equipment if the war were not
being fought. Hewlett-Packard
manufacturers a number of
items for hospital use, including
an advanced electrocardiogram.
The company manufactures
some equipment which is used
in Vietnam, primarily instru
ments to maintain aircraft navi
gation and control systems.
But "these are not big orders,"
Hewlett said. "We are not de
fense oriented."
Hewlett refused to elaborate
on his personal opinions about
the war. From a business view
point, however, he said the com
pany "certainly wouldn't be
hurt" if the war ended tomor
row.
Hewlett-Packard's income has
increased from approximately
$50 million a year to slightly
less than $250 million in the past
ten years. The firm employs
about 5,000 people in the Palo
Alto area.
