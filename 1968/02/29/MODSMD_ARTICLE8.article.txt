## 4.000 Troops Arrive In Vietnam 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — A massive
airlift has landed 4,000 of the
10,500 fresh American troops the
Pentagon promised Gen. Wil
liam C. Westmoreland "for in
surance purposes" and 4,000
more are en route to Vietnam.
The American influx-ordered
two weeks ago shared atten
tion Wednesday with sharp ac
tion in the central highlands and
continued Communist pressures
in the Saigon area and around
Khe Sanh, on the threatened
northern frontier.
The U.S. Command announced
the arrival of the 4,000
paratroopers of the 82nd Air
borne Division's combat-tested
3rd Brigade at Chu Lai, a base
on the South China Sea 345
miles northeast of Saigon.
About 80 per cent of the new
ly arrived paratroopers are vet
erans of previous action in Viet
nam.
While American ranks swelled
toward the 525,000-man level au
thorized before the Communists
launched their lunar new year
offensive Jan. 30, President
Nguyen Van Thieu told his peo
ple government troops engaged
lately in defense of the cities
will return to hunting the enemy
forces in the countryside.
Thieu called on the South
Vietnamese people in a televi
sion address to accept austerity
during this "critical period of
our national history." He an
nounced his government has de
cided to make permanent a ban
on night clubs and dance halls,
which he closed with a martial
law decree Jan. 31.

• Senate Considers
Housing Compromise
WASHINGTON (AP)—Home
owners who sell their houses
through a real estate broker
would be barred from discrimi
nating against Negroes or oth
ers, beginning Jan. 1, 1970, un
der a compromise civil rights
bill introduced in the Senate
Wednesday.
This is one of the key provi
sions of a combination open
housing and civil rights protec
tion measure worked out in an
effort to break a legislative
stalemate that has tied up the
Senate for six weeks.
Republican Leader Everett M.
Dirksen of Illinois, who played
a key role after first opposing
any open housing bill, intro
duced the compromise late in
the day.
The open housing section
would take effect in three
stages, with a ban on discrimi
nation in the sale or rental of
housing applying immediately
only to federally assisted hous
ing.
Essentially, this would cover
houses financed with FHA and
VA loans and public housing
projects. A person who had an
FHA loan and had not paid it off
would be prohibited from dis
criminating in the sale of his
property, as would persons who
obtain government-guaranteed
mortgage loans in the future.
The second stage would be
come effective Dec. 31, 1968, and
would cover multi-unit housing.
The third and final stage
would apply to all single-family
owner-o ccup ie d homes sold
through real estate brokers.

• Pearson Wins Vote
OTTAWA (AP) — Prime Min
ister Lester B. Pearson won
back Wednesday the confidence
in his Liberal government that
was jeopardized by an upset
vote in the House of Commons
while he was away on a Carib
bean holiday.
With all Liberal MPs present,
the House voted 138 to 119 in
favor of the confidence measure
introduced by the 70-year-old
prime minister. His government
had defeated 84 to 82 on a
tax bill Feb. 19.
Pearson plans to retire any
way in the spring, but for his
party Wednesday's vote was a
crucial victory. The Liberals
have still to choose a successor
to Pearson and a confidence de
feat, bringing with it new elec
tions, would have badly shaken
the party.
Wednesday's solid turnout of
Liberals contrasted to the Fob.
19 tax vote that caught 47 of
them absent. Pearson flew home
the next day and charged that
there had been trickery in the
circumstances of the vote.
The tax bill, which had been
approved in principle on a sec
ond reading, went down to de
feat when Conservatives, sens
ing that the Liberals wore
caught short-handed, responded
"now" when a deputy speaker
asked what time a final vote
should be taken."
• LSD Use Declines
WASHINGTON (AP) — Gov
ernment officials say there are
indications of a decline in use of
LSD and express hope it means
young people are heeding scien

tific reports of danger in taking
the hallucinogen.
The Food and Drug Adminis
tration says all its nine drug
abuse control field offices
around the country have been
reporting a general decline in
the amount of LSD encountered
in the last eight months.
John Finlator, director of
FDA's Bureau of Drug Abuse
Control, said Wednesday there
are no figures to show precisely
what the decline has been. He
said the reports are general es
timates of "the amount of LSD
we're finding on the street."
Asked whether the reports
mean use of LSD has declined,
Finlator said, "I think a prudent
man could draw that conclu
sion."
First word of the reported de
cline came Monday in testimony
by Food and Drug Commission
er James L. Goddard before a
House commerce subcommit
tee.
Finlator, elaborating in an in
terview on Goddard's state
ments, took issue with a con
gressman's estimates on usage
of LSD.
Rep. Tim Lee Carter, R-Ky.,
estimated almost two million
students in the country are us
ing LSD and he questioned
whether the government could
enforce a proposed law that
would make it a crime to pos
sess the drug.
Finlator said Carter's esti
mate is based on "four very su
perflous studies."
• Whpelpr, LB J Talk
WASHINGTON (AP) — Gen.
Earle G. Wheeler, saying the
enemy now holds some of the

initiative, gave President John
son and other top officials a new
war report Wednesday that
could lead to U.S. troop increases
in Vietnam.
The White House refused to
say what — if anything—Wheel
er, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, recommendnd to the
President in detailed war discus
sions.
But Wheeler — arriving in
Washington before dawn afier a
quickie inspection tour of Viet
nam following the Communists'
latest cities offensive—may have
indicated to newsmen the tenor
of his report.
"I think the initiative lies on
both sides," the four-star gener
al said when asked if the enemy
is now calling the shots in the
conflict.
"In certain areas where the
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
have sizable uncommitted forces,
of course they can move. In
other words they have tactical
flexibility."
Wheeler maintained, however,
that the Communists failed to
achieve their objectives in re
cent weeks of fighting and,
where they were repulsed, the
forces of Gen. William C. West
moreland hold the initiative.
With the recent wave of Com
munist assaults has come
heightened speculation Johnson
will have to reach once again
into the military manpower pool
to beef up the U.S. effort in
Vietnam.
• Shirley's Solution
WOODSIDE (AP) — Shirley
Temple Black proposed today
that Washington send a cabinet

of negotiators to Paris and then
invite representatives of North
Vietnam, the National Libera

to the conference table.
"If Hanoi shows up, our bomb
ing should immediately cease,
for all targets in North Viet

But she added:
"If we are alone at the table,
we should not only continue the

• Trial Ban Asked
For Huey Newton
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
The State District Court of Ap
peal was asked Wednesday for a
writ of prohibition to ban the
trial of Black Panther leader
Huey P. Newton on charges of
murder, attempted murder and
kidnaping.
Newton was accused of killing
an Oakland policeman and
wounding another last Oct. 28.
Attorney Charles Garry, in
presenting the petition to the
court, said there was no prob
able cause to indict Newton
"because the grand jury was
presented no evidence that he
had fired a gun or even pos
sessed a weapon on the day the
policeman was killed."
Garry also declared that the
indictment was void because
the jury "failed to weigh the
evidence or deliberate."
Garry further contended that
the California standards for con
stituting a grand jury in gener
al and practice in Alameda
County in particular are uncon
stitutional. He said grand juries
in Alameda County were se
lected from higher income

brackets, "thereby excluding
Negroes and young people."
Garry said the statute setting
up grand jury action was un
constitutional and violated due
process "because it set no
standards to determine when an
indictment rather than an infor
mation should be used."
Newton is scheduled to ap
pear in Superior Court on
March 7 for setting of a trial
date.
• Teachers Strike
The possibility of a statewide
walkout by 27,000 Oklahoma
public school teachers persisted
Wednesday while Florida offi

impasse in a strike by 22,000
teachers.
In Pittsburgh, Pa., 1,000 city
teachers were poised for a mid
night walkout.
And in Albuquerque, N. M.,
teachers voted 1.546-908, to re
turn to classes Thursday after
shutting out some 80,000 chil
dren for more than a week.
On the West coast, in San
Francisco, the 1,500-member Fed
eration of Teachers, AFL-CIO,
was scheduled to meet Thurs
day and vote on a proposal to
strike the city's schools. An ear
lier strike deadline, Jan. 25, was
postponed when School S u pt.
Robert Jenkins agreed to some
of the federation's 90-plus de
mands.
The Florida State Board of
Education — a five-man panel of
the State Cabinet with Gov.
Claude Kirk as chairman — met
in Tallahassee Wednesday in
emergency session amid uncon
firmed reports a majority of the
board's members have agreed
with teacher representatives on
a method of resolving the dis
pute.
About one-third of Florida's
1.3 million public school pupils
had been out of school for eight
class days.

• Senate Considers
Housing Compromise
WASHINGTON (AP)—Home
owners who sell their houses
through a real estate broker
would be barred from discrimi
nating against Negroes or oth
ers, beginning Jan. 1, 1970, un
der a compromise civil rights
bill introduced in the Senate
Wednesday.
This is one of the key provi
sions of a combination open
housing and civil rights protec
tion measure worked out in an
effort to break a legislative
stalemate that has tied up the
Senate for six weeks.
Republican Leader Everett M.
Dirksen of Illinois, who played
a key role after first opposing
any open housing bill, intro
duced the compromise late in
the day.
The open housing section
would take effect in three
stages, with a ban on discrimi
nation in the sale or rental of
housing applying immediately
only to federally assisted hous
ing.
Essentially, this would cover
houses financed with FHA and
VA loans and public housing
projects. A person who had an
FHA loan and had not paid it off
would be prohibited from dis
criminating in the sale of his
property, as would persons who
obtain government-guaranteed
mortgage loans in the future.
The second stage would be
come effective Dec. 31, 1968, and
would cover multi-unit housing.
The third and final stage
would apply to all single-family
owner-o ccup ie d homes sold
through real estate brokers.

• Pearson Wins Vote
OTTAWA (AP) — Prime Min
ister Lester B. Pearson won
back Wednesday the confidence
in his Liberal government that
was jeopardized by an upset
vote in the House of Commons
while he was away on a Carib
bean holiday.
With all Liberal MPs present,
the House voted 138 to 119 in
favor of the confidence measure
introduced by the 70-year-old
prime minister. His government
had defeated 84 to 82 on a
tax bill Feb. 19.
Pearson plans to retire any
way in the spring, but for his
party Wednesday's vote was a
crucial victory. The Liberals
have still to choose a successor
to Pearson and a confidence de
feat, bringing with it new elec
tions, would have badly shaken
the party.
Wednesday's solid turnout of
Liberals contrasted to the Fob.
19 tax vote that caught 47 of
them absent. Pearson flew home
the next day and charged that
there had been trickery in the
circumstances of the vote.
The tax bill, which had been
approved in principle on a sec
ond reading, went down to de
feat when Conservatives, sens
ing that the Liberals wore
caught short-handed, responded
"now" when a deputy speaker
asked what time a final vote
should be taken."
• LSD Use Declines
WASHINGTON (AP) — Gov
ernment officials say there are
indications of a decline in use of
LSD and express hope it means
young people are heeding scien

tific reports of danger in taking
the hallucinogen.
The Food and Drug Adminis
tration says all its nine drug
abuse control field offices
around the country have been
reporting a general decline in
the amount of LSD encountered
in the last eight months.
John Finlator, director of
FDA's Bureau of Drug Abuse
Control, said Wednesday there
are no figures to show precisely
what the decline has been. He
said the reports are general es
timates of "the amount of LSD
we're finding on the street."
Asked whether the reports
mean use of LSD has declined,
Finlator said, "I think a prudent
man could draw that conclu
sion."
First word of the reported de
cline came Monday in testimony
by Food and Drug Commission
er James L. Goddard before a
House commerce subcommit
tee.
Finlator, elaborating in an in
terview on Goddard's state
ments, took issue with a con
gressman's estimates on usage
of LSD.
Rep. Tim Lee Carter, R-Ky.,
estimated almost two million
students in the country are us
ing LSD and he questioned
whether the government could
enforce a proposed law that
would make it a crime to pos
sess the drug.
Finlator said Carter's esti

perflous studies."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Gen.

could lead to U.S. troop increases
in Vietnam.
The White House refused to
say what — if anything—Wheel

President in detailed war discus

But Wheeler — arriving in
Washington before dawn afier a

"I think the initiative lies on

"In certain areas where the
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
have sizable uncommitted forces,
of course they can move. In

Wheeler maintained, however,
that the Communists failed to

With the recent wave of Com

• Trial Ban Asked
For Huey Newton
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
The State District Court of Ap
peal was asked Wednesday for a
writ of prohibition to ban the
trial of Black Panther leader
Huey P. Newton on charges of
murder, attempted murder and
kidnaping.
Newton was accused of killing
an Oakland policeman and
wounding another last Oct. 28.
Attorney Charles Garry, in
presenting the petition to the
court, said there was no prob
able cause to indict Newton
"because the grand jury was
presented no evidence that he
had fired a gun or even pos
sessed a weapon on the day the
policeman was killed."
Garry also declared that the
indictment was void because
the jury "failed to weigh the
evidence or deliberate."
Garry further contended that
the California standards for con
stituting a grand jury in gener
al and practice in Alameda
County in particular are uncon
stitutional. He said grand juries
in Alameda County were se
lected from higher income

brackets, "thereby excluding
Negroes and young people."
Garry said the statute setting
up grand jury action was un
constitutional and violated due
process "because it set no
standards to determine when an
indictment rather than an infor
mation should be used."
Newton is scheduled to ap
pear in Superior Court on
March 7 for setting of a trial
date.

cials sought ways to break an
impasse in a strike by 22,000
teachers.
In Pittsburgh, Pa., 1,000 city
teachers were poised for a mid
night walkout.
And in Albuquerque, N. M.,
teachers voted 1.546-908, to re
turn to classes Thursday after
shutting out some 80,000 chil
dren for more than a week.
On the West coast, in San
Francisco, the 1,500-member Fed
eration of Teachers, AFL-CIO,
was scheduled to meet Thurs
day and vote on a proposal to
strike the city's schools. An ear
lier strike deadline, Jan. 25, was
postponed when School S u pt.
Robert Jenkins agreed to some
of the federation's 90-plus de
mands.
The Florida State Board of
Education — a five-man panel of
the State Cabinet with Gov.
Claude Kirk as chairman — met
in Tallahassee Wednesday in
emergency session amid uncon
firmed reports a majority of the
board's members have agreed
with teacher representatives on
a method of resolving the dis

About one-third of Florida's
1.3 million public school pupils
had been out of school for eight
class days.
SAIGON (AP) — A massive
airlift has landed 4,000 of the
10,500 fresh American troops the
Pentagon promised Gen. Wil
liam C. Westmoreland "for in
surance purposes" and 4,000
more are en route to Vietnam.
The American influx-ordered
two weeks ago shared atten
tion Wednesday with sharp ac
tion in the central highlands and
continued Communist pressures
in the Saigon area and around
Khe Sanh, on the threatened
northern frontier.
The U.S. Command announced
the arrival of the 4,000
paratroopers of the 82nd Air
borne Division's combat-tested
3rd Brigade at Chu Lai, a base
on the South China Sea 345
miles northeast of Saigon.
About 80 per cent of the new
ly arrived paratroopers are vet
erans of previous action in Viet
nam.
While American ranks swelled
toward the 525,000-man level au
thorized before the Communists
launched their lunar new year
offensive Jan. 30, President
Nguyen Van Thieu told his peo
ple government troops engaged
lately in defense of the cities
will return to hunting the enemy
forces in the countryside.
Thieu called on the South
Vietnamese people in a televi
sion address to accept austerity
during this "critical period of
our national history." He an
nounced his government has de
cided to make permanent a ban
on night clubs and dance halls,
which he closed with a martial

• Senate Considers
Housing Compromise
WASHINGTON (AP)—Home
owners who sell their houses
through a real estate broker
would be barred from discrimi
nating against Negroes or oth
ers, beginning Jan. 1, 1970, un
der a compromise civil rights
bill introduced in the Senate
Wednesday.
This is one of the key provi
sions of a combination open
housing and civil rights protec
tion measure worked out in an
effort to break a legislative
stalemate that has tied up the
Senate for six weeks.
Republican Leader Everett M.
Dirksen of Illinois, who played
a key role after first opposing
any open housing bill, intro
duced the compromise late in
the day.
The open housing section
would take effect in three
stages, with a ban on discrimi
nation in the sale or rental of
housing applying immediately
only to federally assisted hous
ing.
Essentially, this would cover
houses financed with FHA and
VA loans and public housing
projects. A person who had an
FHA loan and had not paid it off
would be prohibited from dis
criminating in the sale of his
property, as would persons who
obtain government-guaranteed
mortgage loans in the future.
The second stage would be
come effective Dec. 31, 1968, and
would cover multi-unit housing.
The third and final stage
would apply to all single-family
owner-o ccup ie d homes sold
through real estate brokers.

• Pearson Wins Vote
OTTAWA (AP) — Prime Min
ister Lester B. Pearson won
back Wednesday the confidence
in his Liberal government that
was jeopardized by an upset
vote in the House of Commons
while he was away on a Carib
bean holiday.
With all Liberal MPs present,
the House voted 138 to 119 in
favor of the confidence measure
introduced by the 70-year-old
prime minister. His government
had defeated 84 to 82 on a
tax bill Feb. 19.
Pearson plans to retire any
way in the spring, but for his
party Wednesday's vote was a
crucial victory. The Liberals
have still to choose a successor
to Pearson and a confidence de
feat, bringing with it new elec
tions, would have badly shaken
the party.
Wednesday's solid turnout of
Liberals contrasted to the Fob.
19 tax vote that caught 47 of
them absent. Pearson flew home
the next day and charged that
there had been trickery in the
circumstances of the vote.
The tax bill, which had been
approved in principle on a sec
ond reading, went down to de
feat when Conservatives, sens
ing that the Liberals wore
caught short-handed, responded
"now" when a deputy speaker
asked what time a final vote
should be taken."
• LSD Use Declines
WASHINGTON (AP) — Gov
ernment officials say there are
indications of a decline in use of
LSD and express hope it means
young people are heeding scien

tific reports of danger in taking
the hallucinogen.
The Food and Drug Adminis
tration says all its nine drug
abuse control field offices
around the country have been
reporting a general decline in
the amount of LSD encountered
in the last eight months.
John Finlator, director of
FDA's Bureau of Drug Abuse
Control, said Wednesday there
are no figures to show precisely
what the decline has been. He
said the reports are general es
timates of "the amount of LSD
we're finding on the street."
Asked whether the reports
mean use of LSD has declined,
Finlator said, "I think a prudent
man could draw that conclu
sion."
First word of the reported de
cline came Monday in testimony
by Food and Drug Commission
er James L. Goddard before a
House commerce subcommit
tee.
Finlator, elaborating in an in
terview on Goddard's state
ments, took issue with a con
gressman's estimates on usage
of LSD.
Rep. Tim Lee Carter, R-Ky.,
estimated almost two million
students in the country are us
ing LSD and he questioned
whether the government could
enforce a proposed law that
would make it a crime to pos
sess the drug.
Finlator said Carter's esti
mate is based on "four very su
perflous studies."
• Whpelpr, LB J Talk
WASHINGTON (AP) — Gen.
Earle G. Wheeler, saying the

war report Wednesday that
could lead to U.S. troop increases
in Vietnam.
The White House refused to
say what — if anything—Wheel

of Staff, recommendnd to the
President in detailed war discus
sions.
But Wheeler — arriving in
Washington before dawn afier a
quickie inspection tour of Viet

latest cities offensive—may have
indicated to newsmen the tenor
of his report.
"I think the initiative lies on
both sides," the four-star gener
al said when asked if the enemy
is now calling the shots in the
conflict.
"In certain areas where the
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
have sizable uncommitted forces,
of course they can move. In
other words they have tactical
flexibility."
Wheeler maintained, however,
that the Communists failed to
achieve their objectives in re
cent weeks of fighting and,
where they were repulsed, the
forces of Gen. William C. West
moreland hold the initiative.
With the recent wave of Com

"If Hanoi shows up, our bomb

• Trial Ban Asked
For Huey Newton
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
The State District Court of Ap
peal was asked Wednesday for a
writ of prohibition to ban the
trial of Black Panther leader
Huey P. Newton on charges of
murder, attempted murder and
kidnaping.
Newton was accused of killing
an Oakland policeman and
wounding another last Oct. 28.
Attorney Charles Garry, in
presenting the petition to the
court, said there was no prob
able cause to indict Newton
"because the grand jury was
presented no evidence that he
had fired a gun or even pos
sessed a weapon on the day the
policeman was killed."
Garry also declared that the
indictment was void because
the jury "failed to weigh the
evidence or deliberate."
Garry further contended that
the California standards for con
stituting a grand jury in gener
al and practice in Alameda
County in particular are uncon
stitutional. He said grand juries
in Alameda County were se
lected from higher income

brackets, "thereby excluding
Negroes and young people."
Garry said the statute setting
up grand jury action was un
constitutional and violated due
process "because it set no
standards to determine when an
indictment rather than an infor
mation should be used."
Newton is scheduled to ap
pear in Superior Court on
March 7 for setting of a trial
date.

• Teachers Strike
The possibility of a statewide
walkout by 27,000 Oklahoma
public school teachers persisted
Wednesday while Florida offi
cials sought ways to break an
impasse in a strike by 22,000
teachers.
In Pittsburgh, Pa., 1,000 city
teachers were poised for a mid
night walkout.
And in Albuquerque, N. M.,
teachers voted 1.546-908, to re
turn to classes Thursday after
shutting out some 80,000 chil
dren for more than a week.
On the West coast, in San
Francisco, the 1,500-member Fed
eration of Teachers, AFL-CIO,
was scheduled to meet Thurs
day and vote on a proposal to
strike the city's schools. An ear
lier strike deadline, Jan. 25, was
postponed when School S u pt.
Robert Jenkins agreed to some
of the federation's 90-plus de
mands.
The Florida State Board of
Education — a five-man panel of
the State Cabinet with Gov.
Claude Kirk as chairman — met
in Tallahassee Wednesday in
emergency session amid uncon
firmed reports a majority of the
board's members have agreed
with teacher representatives on
a method of resolving the dis
pute.
About one-third of Florida's
1.3 million public school pupils
had been out of school for eight
class days.
SAIGON (AP) — A massive
airlift has landed 4,000 of the
10,500 fresh American troops the
Pentagon promised Gen. Wil
liam C. Westmoreland "for in
surance purposes" and 4,000
more are en route to Vietnam.
The American influx-ordered
two weeks ago shared atten
tion Wednesday with sharp ac
tion in the central highlands and
continued Communist pressures
in the Saigon area and around
Khe Sanh, on the threatened
northern frontier.
The U.S. Command announced
the arrival of the 4,000
paratroopers of the 82nd Air
borne Division's combat-tested
3rd Brigade at Chu Lai, a base
on the South China Sea 345
miles northeast of Saigon.
About 80 per cent of the new
ly arrived paratroopers are vet
erans of previous action in Viet
nam.
While American ranks swelled
toward the 525,000-man level au
thorized before the Communists
launched their lunar new year
offensive Jan. 30, President
Nguyen Van Thieu told his peo
ple government troops engaged
lately in defense of the cities
will return to hunting the enemy
forces in the countryside.
Thieu called on the South
Vietnamese people in a televi
sion address to accept austerity
during this "critical period of
our national history." He an
nounced his government has de
cided to make permanent a ban
on night clubs and dance halls,
which he closed with a martial

• Senate Considers
Housing Compromise
WASHINGTON (AP)—Home
owners who sell their houses
through a real estate broker
would be barred from discrimi
nating against Negroes or oth
ers, beginning Jan. 1, 1970, un
der a compromise civil rights
bill introduced in the Senate
Wednesday.
This is one of the key provi
sions of a combination open
housing and civil rights protec
tion measure worked out in an
effort to break a legislative
stalemate that has tied up the
Senate for six weeks.
Republican Leader Everett M.
Dirksen of Illinois, who played
a key role after first opposing
any open housing bill, intro
duced the compromise late in
the day.
The open housing section
would take effect in three
stages, with a ban on discrimi
nation in the sale or rental of
housing applying immediately
only to federally assisted hous
ing.
Essentially, this would cover
houses financed with FHA and
VA loans and public housing
projects. A person who had an
FHA loan and had not paid it off
would be prohibited from dis
criminating in the sale of his
property, as would persons who
obtain government-guaranteed
mortgage loans in the future.
The second stage would be
come effective Dec. 31, 1968, and
would cover multi-unit housing.
The third and final stage
would apply to all single-family
owner-o ccup ie d homes sold
through real estate brokers.

• Pearson Wins Vote
OTTAWA (AP) — Prime Min
ister Lester B. Pearson won
back Wednesday the confidence
in his Liberal government that
was jeopardized by an upset
vote in the House of Commons
while he was away on a Carib
bean holiday.
With all Liberal MPs present,
the House voted 138 to 119 in
favor of the confidence measure
introduced by the 70-year-old
prime minister. His government
had defeated 84 to 82 on a
tax bill Feb. 19.
Pearson plans to retire any
way in the spring, but for his
party Wednesday's vote was a
crucial victory. The Liberals
have still to choose a successor
to Pearson and a confidence de
feat, bringing with it new elec
tions, would have badly shaken
the party.
Wednesday's solid turnout of
Liberals contrasted to the Fob.
19 tax vote that caught 47 of
them absent. Pearson flew home
the next day and charged that
there had been trickery in the
circumstances of the vote.
The tax bill, which had been
approved in principle on a sec
ond reading, went down to de
feat when Conservatives, sens
ing that the Liberals wore
caught short-handed, responded
"now" when a deputy speaker
asked what time a final vote
should be taken."
• LSD Use Declines
WASHINGTON (AP) — Gov
ernment officials say there are
indications of a decline in use of
LSD and express hope it means
young people are heeding scien

tific reports of danger in taking
the hallucinogen.
The Food and Drug Adminis
tration says all its nine drug
abuse control field offices
around the country have been
reporting a general decline in
the amount of LSD encountered
in the last eight months.
John Finlator, director of
FDA's Bureau of Drug Abuse
Control, said Wednesday there
are no figures to show precisely
what the decline has been. He
said the reports are general es
timates of "the amount of LSD
we're finding on the street."
Asked whether the reports
mean use of LSD has declined,
Finlator said, "I think a prudent
man could draw that conclu
sion."
First word of the reported de
cline came Monday in testimony
by Food and Drug Commission
er James L. Goddard before a
House commerce subcommit
tee.
Finlator, elaborating in an in
terview on Goddard's state
ments, took issue with a con
gressman's estimates on usage
of LSD.
Rep. Tim Lee Carter, R-Ky.,
estimated almost two million
students in the country are us
ing LSD and he questioned
whether the government could
enforce a proposed law that
would make it a crime to pos
sess the drug.
Finlator said Carter's esti
mate is based on "four very su
perflous studies."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Gen.

could lead to U.S. troop increases
in Vietnam.
The White House refused to
say what — if anything—Wheel

President in detailed war discus

But Wheeler — arriving in
Washington before dawn afier a
quickie inspection tour of Viet

latest cities offensive—may have
indicated to newsmen the tenor
of his report.
"I think the initiative lies on
both sides," the four-star gener

"In certain areas where the
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
have sizable uncommitted forces,
of course they can move. In

flexibility."
Wheeler maintained, however,
that the Communists failed to

• Trial Ban Asked
For Huey Newton
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
The State District Court of Ap
peal was asked Wednesday for a
writ of prohibition to ban the
trial of Black Panther leader
Huey P. Newton on charges of
murder, attempted murder and
kidnaping.
Newton was accused of killing
an Oakland policeman and
wounding another last Oct. 28.
Attorney Charles Garry, in
presenting the petition to the
court, said there was no prob
able cause to indict Newton
"because the grand jury was
presented no evidence that he
had fired a gun or even pos
sessed a weapon on the day the
policeman was killed."
Garry also declared that the
indictment was void because
the jury "failed to weigh the
evidence or deliberate."
Garry further contended that
the California standards for con
stituting a grand jury in gener
al and practice in Alameda
County in particular are uncon
stitutional. He said grand juries
in Alameda County were se
lected from higher income

brackets, "thereby excluding

Newton was accused of killing
an Oakland policeman and
wounding another last Oct. 28.
Attorney Charles Garry, in
presenting the petition to the
court, said there was no prob
able cause to indict Newton
"because the grand jury was
presented no evidence that he
had fired a gun or even pos
sessed a weapon on the day the
policeman was killed."
Garry also declared that the
indictment was void because
the jury "failed to weigh the
evidence or deliberate."
Garry further contended that
the California standards for con
stituting a grand jury in gener
al and practice in Alameda
County in particular are uncon
stitutional. He said grand juries
in Alameda County were se
lected from higher income

brackets, "thereby excluding
Negroes and young people."
Garry said the statute setting
up grand jury action was un
constitutional and violated due
process "because it set no
standards to determine when an
indictment rather than an infor
mation should be used."
Newton is scheduled to ap
pear in Superior Court on
March 7 for setting of a trial
date.
• Teachers Strike
The possibility of a statewide
walkout by 27,000 Oklahoma
public school teachers persisted
Wednesday while Florida offi
cials sought ways to break an
impasse in a strike by 22,000
teachers.
In Pittsburgh, Pa., 1,000 city
teachers were poised for a mid
night walkout.
And in Albuquerque, N. M.,
teachers voted 1.546-908, to re
turn to classes Thursday after
shutting out some 80,000 chil
dren for more than a week.
On the West coast, in San
Francisco, the 1,500-member Fed
eration of Teachers, AFL-CIO,
was scheduled to meet Thurs
day and vote on a proposal to
strike the city's schools. An ear
lier strike deadline, Jan. 25, was
postponed when School S u pt.
Robert Jenkins agreed to some
of the federation's 90-plus de
mands.
The Florida State Board of
Education — a five-man panel of
the State Cabinet with Gov.
Claude Kirk as chairman — met
in Tallahassee Wednesday in
emergency session amid uncon
firmed reports a majority of the
board's members have agreed
with teacher representatives on
a method of resolving the dis
pute.
About one-third of Florida's
1.3 million public school pupils
had been out of school for eight
class days.
SAIGON (AP) — A massive
airlift has landed 4,000 of the
10,500 fresh American troops the
Pentagon promised Gen. Wil
liam C. Westmoreland "for in
surance purposes" and 4,000
more are en route to Vietnam.
The American influx-ordered
two weeks ago shared atten
tion Wednesday with sharp ac
tion in the central highlands and
continued Communist pressures
in the Saigon area and around
Khe Sanh, on the threatened
northern frontier.
The U.S. Command announced
the arrival of the 4,000
paratroopers of the 82nd Air
borne Division's combat-tested
3rd Brigade at Chu Lai, a base
on the South China Sea 345
miles northeast of Saigon.
About 80 per cent of the new
ly arrived paratroopers are vet
erans of previous action in Viet
nam.
While American ranks swelled
toward the 525,000-man level au
thorized before the Communists
launched their lunar new year
offensive Jan. 30, President
Nguyen Van Thieu told his peo
ple government troops engaged
lately in defense of the cities
will return to hunting the enemy
forces in the countryside.
Thieu called on the South
Vietnamese people in a televi
sion address to accept austerity
during this "critical period of
our national history." He an
nounced his government has de
cided to make permanent a ban
on night clubs and dance halls,
which he closed with a martial

• Senate Considers
Housing Compromise
WASHINGTON (AP)—Home
owners who sell their houses
through a real estate broker
would be barred from discrimi
nating against Negroes or oth
ers, beginning Jan. 1, 1970, un
der a compromise civil rights
bill introduced in the Senate
Wednesday.
This is one of the key provi
sions of a combination open
housing and civil rights protec
tion measure worked out in an
effort to break a legislative
stalemate that has tied up the
Senate for six weeks.
Republican Leader Everett M.
Dirksen of Illinois, who played
a key role after first opposing
any open housing bill, intro
duced the compromise late in
the day.
The open housing section
would take effect in three
stages, with a ban on discrimi
nation in the sale or rental of
housing applying immediately
only to federally assisted hous
ing.
Essentially, this would cover
houses financed with FHA and
VA loans and public housing
projects. A person who had an
FHA loan and had not paid it off
would be prohibited from dis
criminating in the sale of his
property, as would persons who
obtain government-guaranteed
mortgage loans in the future.
The second stage would be
come effective Dec. 31, 1968, and
would cover multi-unit housing.
The third and final stage
would apply to all single-family
owner-o ccup ie d homes sold
through real estate brokers.

• Pearson Wins Vote
OTTAWA (AP) — Prime Min
ister Lester B. Pearson won
back Wednesday the confidence
in his Liberal government that
was jeopardized by an upset
vote in the House of Commons
while he was away on a Carib
bean holiday.
With all Liberal MPs present,
the House voted 138 to 119 in
favor of the confidence measure
introduced by the 70-year-old
prime minister. His government
had defeated 84 to 82 on a
tax bill Feb. 19.
Pearson plans to retire any
way in the spring, but for his
party Wednesday's vote was a
crucial victory. The Liberals
have still to choose a successor
to Pearson and a confidence de
feat, bringing with it new elec
tions, would have badly shaken
the party.
Wednesday's solid turnout of
Liberals contrasted to the Fob.
19 tax vote that caught 47 of
them absent. Pearson flew home
the next day and charged that
there had been trickery in the
circumstances of the vote.
The tax bill, which had been
approved in principle on a sec
ond reading, went down to de
feat when Conservatives, sens
ing that the Liberals wore
caught short-handed, responded
"now" when a deputy speaker
asked what time a final vote
should be taken."
• LSD Use Declines
WASHINGTON (AP) — Gov
ernment officials say there are
indications of a decline in use of
LSD and express hope it means
young people are heeding scien

tific reports of danger in taking
the hallucinogen.
The Food and Drug Adminis
tration says all its nine drug
abuse control field offices
around the country have been
reporting a general decline in
the amount of LSD encountered
in the last eight months.
John Finlator, director of
FDA's Bureau of Drug Abuse
Control, said Wednesday there
are no figures to show precisely
what the decline has been. He
said the reports are general es
timates of "the amount of LSD
we're finding on the street."
Asked whether the reports
mean use of LSD has declined,
Finlator said, "I think a prudent
man could draw that conclu
sion."
First word of the reported de
cline came Monday in testimony
by Food and Drug Commission
er James L. Goddard before a
House commerce subcommit
tee.
Finlator, elaborating in an in
terview on Goddard's state
ments, took issue with a con
gressman's estimates on usage
of LSD.
Rep. Tim Lee Carter, R-Ky.,
estimated almost two million
students in the country are us
ing LSD and he questioned
whether the government could
enforce a proposed law that
would make it a crime to pos
sess the drug.
Finlator said Carter's esti

perflous studies."

WASHINGTON (AP) — Gen.

in Vietnam.
The White House refused to

But Wheeler — arriving in

"I think the initiative lies on

"In certain areas where the
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong

of course they can move. In

Wheeler maintained, however,
that the Communists failed to

for all targets in North Viet
nam," she said.
But she added:
"If we are alone at the table,
we should not only continue the
bombing, but immediately im
pose a blockade of the ap
proaches of Haiphong Harbor,
through which passes 85 per
cent of the war material that is
killing our boys."
• Trial Ban Asked
For Huey Newton
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
The State District Court of Ap
peal was asked Wednesday for a
writ of prohibition to ban the
trial of Black Panther leader
Huey P. Newton on charges of
murder, attempted murder and
kidnaping.
Newton was accused of killing
an Oakland policeman and
wounding another last Oct. 28.
Attorney Charles Garry, in
presenting the petition to the
court, said there was no prob
able cause to indict Newton
"because the grand jury was
presented no evidence that he
had fired a gun or even pos
sessed a weapon on the day the
policeman was killed."
Garry also declared that the
indictment was void because
the jury "failed to weigh the
evidence or deliberate."
Garry further contended that
the California standards for con
stituting a grand jury in gener
al and practice in Alameda
County in particular are uncon
stitutional. He said grand juries
in Alameda County were se
lected from higher income

brackets, "thereby excluding
Negroes and young people."
Garry said the statute setting
up grand jury action was un
constitutional and violated due
process "because it set no
standards to determine when an
indictment rather than an infor
mation should be used."
Newton is scheduled to ap
pear in Superior Court on
March 7 for setting of a trial
date.
• Teachers Strike
The possibility of a statewide
walkout by 27,000 Oklahoma
public school teachers persisted
Wednesday while Florida offi
cials sought ways to break an
impasse in a strike by 22,000
teachers.
In Pittsburgh, Pa., 1,000 city
teachers were poised for a mid
night walkout.
And in Albuquerque, N. M.,
teachers voted 1.546-908, to re
turn to classes Thursday after
shutting out some 80,000 chil
dren for more than a week.
On the West coast, in San
Francisco, the 1,500-member Fed
eration of Teachers, AFL-CIO,
was scheduled to meet Thurs
day and vote on a proposal to
strike the city's schools. An ear
lier strike deadline, Jan. 25, was
postponed when School S u pt.
Robert Jenkins agreed to some
of the federation's 90-plus de
mands.
The Florida State Board of
Education — a five-man panel of
the State Cabinet with Gov.
Claude Kirk as chairman — met
in Tallahassee Wednesday in
emergency session amid uncon
firmed reports a majority of the
board's members have agreed
with teacher representatives on
a method of resolving the dis
pute.
About one-third of Florida's
1.3 million public school pupils
had been out of school for eight
class days.
