## 4.000 Troops Arrive In Vietnam 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — A massive
airlift has landed 4,000 of the
10,500 fresh American troops the
Pentagon promised Gen. Wil
liam C. Westmoreland "for in
surance purposes" and 4,000
more are en route to Vietnam.
The American influx-ordered
two weeks ago shared atten
tion Wednesday with sharp ac
tion in the central highlands and
continued Communist pressures
in the Saigon area and around
Khe Sanh, on the threatened
northern frontier.
The U.S. Command announced
the arrival of the 4,000
paratroopers of the 82nd Air
borne Division's combat-tested
3rd Brigade at Chu Lai, a base
on the South China Sea 345
miles northeast of Saigon.
About 80 per cent of the new
ly arrived paratroopers are vet
erans of previous action in Viet
nam.
While American ranks swelled
toward the 525,000-man level au
thorized before the Communists
launched their lunar new year
offensive Jan. 30, President
Nguyen Van Thieu told his peo
ple government troops engaged
lately in defense of the cities
will return to hunting the enemy
forces in the countryside.
Thieu called on the South
Vietnamese people in a televi
sion address to accept austerity
during this "critical period of
our national history." He an
nounced his government has de
cided to make permanent a ban
on night clubs and dance halls,
which he closed with a martial
law decree Jan. 31.

• Senate Considers
Housing Compromise
WASHINGTON (AP)—Home
owners who sell their houses
through a real estate broker
would be barred from discrimi
nating against Negroes or oth
ers, beginning Jan. 1, 1970, un
der a compromise civil rights
bill introduced in the Senate
Wednesday.
This is one of the key provi
sions of a combination open
housing and civil rights protec
tion measure worked out in an
effort to break a legislative
stalemate that has tied up the
Senate for six weeks.
Republican Leader Everett M.
Dirksen of Illinois, who played
a key role after first opposing
any open housing bill, intro
duced the compromise late in
the day.
The open housing section
would take effect in three
stages, with a ban on discrimi
nation in the sale or rental of
housing applying immediately
only to federally assisted hous
ing.
Essentially, this would cover
houses financed with FHA and
VA loans and public housing
projects. A person who had an
FHA loan and had not paid it off
would be prohibited from dis
criminating in the sale of his
property, as would persons who
obtain government-guaranteed
mortgage loans in the future.
The second stage would be
come effective Dec. 31, 1968, and
would cover multi-unit housing.
The third and final stage
would apply to all single-family
owner-o ccup ie d homes sold
through real estate brokers.

• Pearson Wins Vote
OTTAWA (AP) — Prime Min
ister Lester B. Pearson won
back Wednesday the confidence
in his Liberal government that
was jeopardized by an upset
vote in the House of Commons
while he was away on a Carib
bean holiday.
With all Liberal MPs present,
the House voted 138 to 119 in
favor of the confidence measure
introduced by the 70-year-old
prime minister. His government
had defeated 84 to 82 on a
tax bill Feb. 19.
Pearson plans to retire any
way in the spring, but for his
party Wednesday's vote was a
crucial victory. The Liberals
have still to choose a successor
to Pearson and a confidence de
feat, bringing with it new elec
tions, would have badly shaken
the party.
Wednesday's solid turnout of
Liberals contrasted to the Fob.
19 tax vote that caught 47 of
them absent. Pearson flew home
the next day and charged that
there had been trickery in the
circumstances of the vote.
The tax bill, which had been
approved in principle on a sec
ond reading, went down to de
feat when Conservatives, sens
ing that the Liberals wore
caught short-handed, responded
"now" when a deputy speaker
asked what time a final vote
should be taken."
• LSD Use Declines
WASHINGTON (AP) — Gov
ernment officials say there are
indications of a decline in use of
LSD and express hope it means
young people are heeding scien

tific reports of danger in taking
the hallucinogen.
The Food and Drug Adminis
tration says all its nine drug
abuse control field offices
around the country have been
reporting a general decline in
the amount of LSD encountered
in the last eight months.
John Finlator, director of
FDA's Bureau of Drug Abuse
Control, said Wednesday there
are no figures to show precisely
what the decline has been. He
said the reports are general es
timates of "the amount of LSD
we're finding on the street."
Asked whether the reports
mean use of LSD has declined,
Finlator said, "I think a prudent
man could draw that conclu
sion."
First word of the reported de
cline came Monday in testimony
by Food and Drug Commission
er James L. Goddard before a
House commerce subcommit
tee.
Finlator, elaborating in an in
terview on Goddard's state
ments, took issue with a con
gressman's estimates on usage
of LSD.
Rep. Tim Lee Carter, R-Ky.,
estimated almost two million
students in the country are us
ing LSD and he questioned
whether the government could
enforce a proposed law that
would make it a crime to pos
sess the drug.
Finlator said Carter's esti
mate is based on "four very su
perflous studies."
• Whpelpr, LB J Talk
WASHINGTON (AP) — Gen.
Earle G. Wheeler, saying the
enemy now holds some of the

initiative, gave President John
son and other top officials a new
war report Wednesday that
could lead to U.S. troop increases
in Vietnam.
The White House refused to
say what — if anything—Wheel
er, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, recommendnd to the
President in detailed war discus
sions.
But Wheeler — arriving in
Washington before dawn afier a
quickie inspection tour of Viet
nam following the Communists'
latest cities offensive—may have
indicated to newsmen the tenor
of his report.
"I think the initiative lies on
both sides," the four-star gener
al said when asked if the enemy
is now calling the shots in the
conflict.
"In certain areas where the
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
have sizable uncommitted forces,
of course they can move. In
other words they have tactical
flexibility."
Wheeler maintained, however,
that the Communists failed to
achieve their objectives in re
cent weeks of fighting and,
where they were repulsed, the
forces of Gen. William C. West
moreland hold the initiative.
With the recent wave of Com
munist assaults has come
heightened speculation Johnson
will have to reach once again
into the military manpower pool
to beef up the U.S. effort in
Vietnam.
