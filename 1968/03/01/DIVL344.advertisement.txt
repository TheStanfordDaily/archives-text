Why do you work
for the Stanford Daily?
Mark Weinberger, news editor: "I'm trying to throw off my middle-class upbringing."
Tom Dawson, night editor: "I'd never worked on a newspaper before last fall. It's a lot of
fun. Since I transferred to Stanford just this year, working on the Daily has given me a way
to learn about the campus."
Kip Hargrove, associate editor: "Money. At $80 a month salary plus $10 a shot for night
editing, I'll be a rich man by the age of 90."
Val Westen, reporter: "I want writing practice. I'm not going to learn perfect prose style
from Freshman English."
Penny Hill, copy editor: "Because it's there."
YOU: "Well, I never really considered it before I saw this marvelously clever advertisement
in the Daily."
Join the Daily staff spring quarter. Meeting for new staffers Friday, March 8 at 5 p.m. in the
Daily office, Storke Publications building, Lomita Drive. Come visit before then.
