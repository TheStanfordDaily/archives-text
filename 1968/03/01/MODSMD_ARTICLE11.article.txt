# Presidential Material

There are strong indications that John Summerskill, who re
signed as president of San Francisco State last week after 18 months
in office, may spend next year tucked away in Stanford's Institute
for the Study of Human Problems.
We would like to see a man like Summerskill come here next
year in a different capacity — as president of Stanford University.
Summerskill exemplifies the rare combination of administrative
skill, academic preeminence, and human qualities needed by a uni
versity president. The 42-year-old clinical psychologist has shown
no fear of speaking out on volatile subjects like political interfer
ence in public education, the draft, the war in Vietnam, and black
power. He has upheld academic freedom and the right of a college
campus to solve its problems internally, even when this stance
might have endangered his job. Stanford needs this forthrightness.
Furthermore, John Summerskill has the qualities needed to work
with students effectively. He has consistently shown he under
stands students problems and pressures and can work to resolve
them. At San Francisco State Summerskill has often met publicly
with groups of students to discuss their views. When was the last
time you saw a Stanford administrator debating on White Plaza?
Wallace Sterling's successor must be even-tempered, open, and
venturesome. He must be a man — like Summerskill — who can
lead change, not merely cope with it.
