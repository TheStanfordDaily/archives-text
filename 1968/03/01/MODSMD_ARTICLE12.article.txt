# Military Misguides U.S. Decisions
## 
### Max Lerner 
There is more blood and gore
being spilt in the congressional
war over the Bay of Tonkin
episode than there was in the
original encounter.
The stakes are high. The Ad
ministration has all along con
tended that the Bay of Tonkin
Resolution, passed overwhelm
ingly by both the House and the
Senate in August, 196-}, gave it
a go-ahead for the war even
without a formal declaration of
war. Bill Fulbright and his em
battled band of senatorial col
leagues on the Foreign Rela
tions Committee now say that
the Administration's leaders de
ceived, tricked and ensnared
them into the resolution.
The Administration says the
facts were all given to Congress
at the time, that nothing was
doctored and nothing witheld.
The senators say nay, not so:
that vital facts were concealed
or distorted; that Congress was
conned; that it was had.
Long Argument
Men will be arguing for years
about the Maddox and the Tur
ner Joy, the two American de
stroyers in the Bay of Tonkin
on Aug. 4, 19G4: what they were
doing there, what happened to
them, how clearly and seriously
they were attacked by the North
Vietnamese torpedo boat.
After every war there is a
struggle about it. On World
War I there was the "revision
ist" controversy about how it
started. On World War II there
was the debate about Pearl Har
bor, about Yalta, about Hiro
shima and the bomb. On the
Korean War there was the strug
gle over Gen. Douglas Mac A
rthur's role.
This time there was no wait
ing until after the war. The
fierce debate is now, during it.
What a helluva way to run a
war, say the Administration
leaders about Fulbright and his
fellows. What a helluva way to
get us into a war and to get a
war resolution (in lieu of a dec
laration) out of Congress, the
Fulbrightists answer.
Fulbright and his committee
strike me as having a case—not
as good, perhaps as they claim
to have, but a pretty good one.
It isn't a case for provocation.
That is to say, there is no evi
dence to suggest that the two
destroyers were where they
were in order to provoke an at
tack on them and thus give the
Americans arr excuse for the
bombing.
Nor is it a case for clear and
present deception of Congress.
No one was faking any evidence
or inventing any story in order
to trick Congress.

The villain in the piece was
not Robert McNamera or Dean
Rusk or President Johnson. It
was something less personal
and more abstract. It was the
way decisions get made at crisis
moments, and especially the
way this particular Administra
tion made this particular de
cision at this particular moment.
McNamera took time out in
his recent testimony, just re
leased, to talk about the deci
sion-making process as it un
rolled during those fateful hours
(5 hours and 40 minutes, "be
tween 13:27 and 19:07" as the
precision-minded secretary put
it) when he and the Joint Chiefs
"were reviewing the informa
tion that bore on whether an at
tack had taken place."

Reading the testimony I was
convinced that the secretary had
been determined to be "damned
sure what happened" before or
dering the retaliatory action of
bombing North Vietnam. I was
by no means convinced that it
was the right way to reach a
decision with such far-reaching
consequences.
Separate Processes
I suppose it is the same prob
lem I have been harping on in a
number of recent columns—the
way American decision-makers
separate military decisions from
political ones, on the theory that
the two are never related and
that never the twain shall meet.
Take the decision that McNa
mara and the Joint Chiefs were
taking hours to reach. The exec

utive order was that waiting for
the decision was not just a mil
itary order. It was an order
which moved the war into a
wholly new phase—that of the
bombing of the North, about
which there had been worldwide
arguments for months, pro and
con.
It was a political act, in the
sense that the bombing of the
North wholly changed Russia's
relations to the Hanoi regime
and thus to the war and indeed
to America. It was a political
act, also, in the sense that it
changed the world attitude to
ward the war and America. Yet
this political decision was made
by a group of military men sit
ting with the secretary of de
fense, on the basis of cables and

phone conversations (some of
thorn confusing and contradic
tory) betwen the defense deci
sionmakers and the military in
the area.
The decision was thus too
hasty, in the sense that so far
reaching a decision should have
been reached by a top-level Cab
inet and congressional group not
as a military but as a political
decision. It was "out of propor
tion to the provocation," as Sen.
Albert Gore has said, not be
cause 64 bombing missions were
flown as an immediate result,
but because the beginning of
the bombing of the North was
a military-political act, even if
there had been fewer missions.
Once it had taken place, Con
gress was presented with an ac
complished fact. At that point
the Administration felt it had
put the best possible face on the
whole episode, in order to get
the congressional resolution
which confirmed how political
that ordinary military decision
had been.
