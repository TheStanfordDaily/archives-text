## Deferments Have Price Tags 
### BOB WOLF 
A couple of months ago, Ire
ceived a brief note from my
draft board, saying that if I sim
ply signed and returned the en
closed form, I would receive an
extension of my 2-S deferment. I
complied; they complied; and I
couldn't help being impressed at
the congeniality of my local
board.
Just recently, my bubble in
this matter was burst somewhat
when I became aware of a little
known and subtle point in the
new draft law. Most people know
that having a 2-S deferment has
its price. Under present provi
sions, a person who has had a
2-S at any time since July 1967
can never be deferred as a fath
er (3-A). And a person who has
ever had a 2-S is liable to be
classified 1-A until age thirty
five, rather than twenty-six.
But by itself, the latter provi
sion poses little or no threat:
under the normal procedure,
men over 20 cannot be drafted
unless no eligible men from 19
through 25 are left, which is
quite improbable even with cur
rent trends.
Defense Requirements
But this extended liability may
turn out to be quite significant
when combined with an ob
scure and slightly strange sec
tion involving requested defer
ments. The Secretary of De
fense may, at any time, call for
a certain number of men of a
specific age or ages to be drafted.
If he does, local boards must
immediately start drafting (in

order of day and month of birth,
and until their quota is met) all
1-A registrants in that age
group, and also certain other
registrants, including all 1-A
men who ever requested and
received a 2-S since July 19G7,
regardless of their aetual age.
So, a student considering ask
ing for a 2-S ought to weigh the
pros and cons. Someone who will
soon be 26, or will soon be defer
red in some other way, might be
advised to do so only if it's ne
cessary in order to avoid immi
nent induction (unless, of course,
he's already requested and ob
tained a 2-S since last July).
Undergrad Chances
What are the chances of stay
ing in 2-S for a long time with
out ever requesting it? For un
dergraduates, they are nil: the
law makes yearly requests an
absolute necessity for undergrad
student deferments.
For grad students beyond their
first year, a different section of
the law applies. Local boards
may defer such students at their
discretion, but no mention of
requests is made in this provi
sion. (The Selective Service Sys
tem form you fill out on reg
day which essentially just says
you're a student is not a re
quest for a 2-S). So a grad stu
dent who hopes to be deferred
until his Ph.D. might never have
to do any requesting.
On the other hand, he could,
at any time, be asked by his
board to sign a simple foiTn re
questing a 2-S. Local boards do
have the right to do this. But

there is no absolute certainty
that they are doing it deliberate
ly to make people liable for in
duction under the call-by-age
group provision.
So, a grad student who gets
such a letter could try various
ways to squirm out of the re
quest. He might simply ignore
it, but this seems dangerous. He
might, instead of returning their
form, send in a letter of his own
saying that he's in school, work
ing for a certain degree, hopes
to continue in school, etc., but
being careful not to request a
deferment (he might say he lost
their form).
Or he might point out to his
board that the law doesn't men
tion the need for such a request,
and then hope they don't insist.
Finally, if he thinks his board
is a very friendly group which
doesn't want to draft him when
he's 30, he might tell them ex
actly why he doesn't want to
sign their form. All of these ma
neuvers are more or less risky.
Calls by age group have so far
not been made, and it is not
known whether they will be. So
perhaps the only penalty for
requesting a 2-S will be nine
extra years of worry about the
draft.
This is just one example of
how draft boards deliberately or
inadvertently can increase regi
strants' vulnerability to the
draft.
Moral: if you're trying to live
within the system, a careful
study of the idiosyncrasies of the
draft law can't hurt you.

have the right to do this. But

there is no absolute certainty
that they are doing it deliberate
ly to make people liable for in
duction under the call-by-age
group provision.
So, a grad student who gets
such a letter could try various
ways to squirm out of the re
quest. He might simply ignore
it, but this seems dangerous. He
might, instead of returning their
form, send in a letter of his own
saying that he's in school, work
ing for a certain degree, hopes
to continue in school, etc., but
being careful not to request a
deferment (he might say he lost
their form).
Or he might point out to his
board that the law doesn't men
tion the need for such a request,
and then hope they don't insist.
Finally, if he thinks his board
is a very friendly group which
doesn't want to draft him when
he's 30, he might tell them ex
actly why he doesn't want to
sign their form. All of these ma
neuvers are more or less risky.
Calls by age group have so far
not been made, and it is not
known whether they will be. So
perhaps the only penalty for
requesting a 2-S will be nine
extra years of worry about the
draft.
This is just one example of
how draft boards deliberately or
inadvertently can increase regi
strants' vulnerability to the
draft.
Moral: if you're trying to live
within the system, a careful
study of the idiosyncrasies of the
draft law can't hurt you.
A couple of months ago, Ire
ceived a brief note from my
draft board, saying that if I sim
ply signed and returned the en
closed form, I would receive an
extension of my 2-S deferment. I
complied; they complied; and I
couldn't help being impressed at
the congeniality of my local
board.
Just recently, my bubble in
this matter was burst somewhat
when I became aware of a little
known and subtle point in the
new draft law. Most people know
that having a 2-S deferment has
its price. Under present provi
sions, a person who has had a
2-S at any time since July 1967
can never be deferred as a fath
er (3-A). And a person who has
ever had a 2-S is liable to be
classified 1-A until age thirty
five, rather than twenty-six.
But by itself, the latter provi
sion poses little or no threat:
under the normal procedure,
men over 20 cannot be drafted
unless no eligible men from 19
through 25 are left, which is
quite improbable even with cur
rent trends.
Defense Requirements
But this extended liability may
turn out to be quite significant
when combined with an ob
scure and slightly strange sec
tion involving requested defer
ments. The Secretary of De
fense may, at any time, call for
a certain number of men of a
specific age or ages to be drafted.
If he does, local boards must
immediately start drafting (in

order of day and month of birth,
and until their quota is met) all
1-A registrants in that age
group, and also certain other
registrants, including all 1-A
men who ever requested and
received a 2-S since July 19G7,
regardless of their aetual age.
So, a student considering ask
ing for a 2-S ought to weigh the
pros and cons. Someone who will
soon be 26, or will soon be defer
red in some other way, might be
advised to do so only if it's ne
cessary in order to avoid immi
nent induction (unless, of course,
he's already requested and ob
tained a 2-S since last July).
Undergrad Chances
What are the chances of stay
ing in 2-S for a long time with
out ever requesting it? For un
dergraduates, they are nil: the
law makes yearly requests an
absolute necessity for undergrad
student deferments.
For grad students beyond their
first year, a different section of
the law applies. Local boards
may defer such students at their
discretion, but no mention of
requests is made in this provi
sion. (The Selective Service Sys
tem form you fill out on reg
day which essentially just says
you're a student is not a re
quest for a 2-S). So a grad stu
dent who hopes to be deferred
until his Ph.D. might never have
to do any requesting.

and until their quota is met) all
1-A registrants in that age
group, and also certain other
registrants, including all 1-A
men who ever requested and
received a 2-S since July 19G7,
regardless of their aetual age.
So, a student considering ask
ing for a 2-S ought to weigh the
pros and cons. Someone who will
soon be 26, or will soon be defer
red in some other way, might be
advised to do so only if it's ne
cessary in order to avoid immi
nent induction (unless, of course,
he's already requested and ob
tained a 2-S since last July).
Undergrad Chances
What are the chances of stay
ing in 2-S for a long time with
out ever requesting it? For un
dergraduates, they are nil: the
law makes yearly requests an
absolute necessity for undergrad
student deferments.
For grad students beyond their
first year, a different section of
the law applies. Local boards
may defer such students at their
discretion, but no mention of
requests is made in this provi
sion. (The Selective Service Sys
tem form you fill out on reg
day which essentially just says
you're a student is not a re
quest for a 2-S). So a grad stu
dent who hopes to be deferred
until his Ph.D. might never have
to do any requesting.
On the other hand, he could,
at any time, be asked by his
board to sign a simple foiTn re
questing a 2-S. Local boards do
have the right to do this. But

there is no absolute certainty
that they are doing it deliberate
ly to make people liable for in
duction under the call-by-age
group provision.
So, a grad student who gets
such a letter could try various
ways to squirm out of the re
quest. He might simply ignore
it, but this seems dangerous. He
might, instead of returning their
form, send in a letter of his own
saying that he's in school, work
ing for a certain degree, hopes
to continue in school, etc., but
being careful not to request a
deferment (he might say he lost
their form).
Or he might point out to his
board that the law doesn't men
tion the need for such a request,
and then hope they don't insist.
Finally, if he thinks his board
is a very friendly group which
doesn't want to draft him when
he's 30, he might tell them ex
actly why he doesn't want to
sign their form. All of these ma
neuvers are more or less risky.
Calls by age group have so far
not been made, and it is not
known whether they will be. So
perhaps the only penalty for
requesting a 2-S will be nine
extra years of worry about the
draft.
This is just one example of
how draft boards deliberately or
inadvertently can increase regi
strants' vulnerability to the
draft.
Moral: if you're trying to live
within the system, a careful
study of the idiosyncrasies of the
draft law can't hurt you.
A couple of months ago, Ire
ceived a brief note from my
draft board, saying that if I sim
ply signed and returned the en
closed form, I would receive an
extension of my 2-S deferment. I
complied; they complied; and I
couldn't help being impressed at
the congeniality of my local
board.
Just recently, my bubble in
this matter was burst somewhat
when I became aware of a little
known and subtle point in the
new draft law. Most people know
that having a 2-S deferment has
its price. Under present provi
sions, a person who has had a
2-S at any time since July 1967
can never be deferred as a fath
er (3-A). And a person who has
ever had a 2-S is liable to be
classified 1-A until age thirty
five, rather than twenty-six.
But by itself, the latter provi
sion poses little or no threat:
under the normal procedure,
men over 20 cannot be drafted
unless no eligible men from 19
through 25 are left, which is
quite improbable even with cur
rent trends.
Defense Requirements
But this extended liability may
turn out to be quite significant
when combined with an ob
scure and slightly strange sec
tion involving requested defer
ments. The Secretary of De
fense may, at any time, call for
a certain number of men of a
specific age or ages to be drafted.
If he does, local boards must
immediately start drafting (in

order of day and month of birth,
and until their quota is met) all
1-A registrants in that age
group, and also certain other
registrants, including all 1-A
men who ever requested and
received a 2-S since July 19G7,
regardless of their aetual age.
