## Rivers Urges Administration To Draft Younger Men First 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct a mis
impression created by the article
"New Draft Regs Final" that
was published in Monday's
Daily. In that article Mr. An
thony of the College Press Ser
vice News Analysis stated:
"The real power in question
connected with the military
rests with legislators like
Rep. Mendel Rivers (D., S.C.)
and Sen. Richard Russell (D.,
Ga.), chairmen of the armed
services committees in their
respective branches of Con
gress.
Neither has referred public
ly to the Administration's
new policy. An assistant to
Rivers, however, has pointed
out that the policy comes
close to what his committee
recommended after its draft
hearings last year."
An article in the preceding
Saturday's New York Times
(Feb. 24, 1968 at P. 4) however,
indicates that this report is in
accurate. The article reported a
letter sent from Chairman Riv
ers to General Hershey:
"Mr. Rivers demanded that
the Administration explain
why it had not fulfilled a
pledge to draft younger men
first. In a letter to General
Hershey, he emphasized that
Congress, a civilian advisory
panel to his committee, the
Defense Department, a Pres
idential commission and Pres
ident Johnson himself had all
proposed reversing the pres
ent order of military call up,
in which the oldest eligible
men are taken first."
The letter went on to ask why
action had not been taken to
fulfill the Presidential pledge to
Congress in March of 1967 that
the youngest males be taken
first.
It is quite possible that Rep.
Rivers is expressing the Defense
Department's discontent with
the President's reaffirmation of
his earlier declaration. While
Rep. Rivers and college students
and administration make
strange bedfellows, it is difficult
to determine what will result.
Possibly, Mr. Anthony's con
clusions are accurate, but it re
mains an open question what
changes might yet take place.

Questions Objectivity
Editor, The Daily:
Last Quarter I wrote an arti
cle on the activities of the Stan
ford Anti-Draft Union and sub
mitted it to The Daily. Michael
Sweeney, the news editor at the
time, refused to print it—saying
that it contained "inflamatory
material" and lecturing me on
the criteria which objectivity de
manded that a news story satis
fy. "When are people of your
political persuasion going to
learn the difference between
news and opinion?" he asked
me, I thought, rather rhetorical
ly. Mr. Sweeney did not appear
to notice that the only opinions
in the article were clearly la
belled as quotations. However,
I left without answering his
question, confident that Stan
ford could claim a press of un
compromising objectivity.
Imagine, then, my disappoint
ment at seeing recent Daily
news stories. Whoever wrote
Monday's article on the arrest
of Black Panther Bobby Seale,
apparently felt that in the inter
est of objectivity, it was neces
sary to mention twice during
the article that Bobby Seale had
led an armed group of Panthers
into the capitol building last
year. The casual reader prob
ably gathered that the Panthers'
action at that time was illegal
—especially at the second men

tion of the incident, when it was
noted that the Panthers were
"herded out and disarmed by
security police."
Nowhere was it mentioned
that the police action was an in
fringement on the constitutional
right to bear arms. Nor, was it
mentioned that despite no for
mal charges having been filed
against Mr. Seale (in the most
recent incident), his bail was
set at $11,000, in what seems to
be an attempt by "authorities"
to exhaust the Panthers' money,
desperately needed for Huey
Newton's defense.
Mlslabled Enemy
Tuesday's Daily contains the
front-page headline: "Enemy
Traps Marines Just Outside Khe
Sanh." An objective headline
would have read: "North Viet
namese Trap Marines Outside
Khe Sanh." Was the headline
trying to suggest to the reader
that the North Vietnamese were
his enemy? Or was it merely
trying to be helpful, by inform
ing the reader that the North
Vietnamese were the enemy of
the U.S. Marines? If the writer
thought that Stanford students
needed that help, he could have
made the situation clear in the
body of the article.
That some articles are "com
piled from the Associated Press"
ought not to excuse The Daily.
Surely Stanford deserves more
than a parroting of wire service
dispatches.
I hope Mr. Sweeney will act
upon the code he professes—by
cooling the ardor of some mem
bers of his news staff. If, how
ever, Mr. Sweeney no longer
makes a claim to objectivity,
and insists upon labelling one
side as the "enemy," then I
suggest that he consider what
is becoming clear to more and
more of his readers every day
—that the real enemy of the
American people is not the "Viet
Cong" or the "North Vietnam
ese," but, rather, the United
States government.

EDITOR'S REPLY: Mr. Lis
chinsky's interest in objectivity
is refreshing.
I do not recall the article on
the anti-draft union which he
mentions. Therefore I cannot re
ply to his allegation that it was
unjustly rejected. I would like
to point out, however, that THE
DAILY has run several articles
on the anti-draft union, as well

as many concerning the Resis
tance, Students for a Democrat
ic Society, and Peace and Free
dom Party. This coverage has
caused some conservatives to
question our objectivity.
The article on Bobby Seale
was written by the Associated
Press. Although hardly a model
of objectivity, the AP usually
gives a balanced view. I would
choose the AP's version of the
truth over Mr. Lisehinsky's.
I hope Mr. Lisehinsky and oth
er readers will realize the diffi
culty of writing headlines which
exactly convey the tone of an
article. But the headline "En
emy Traps Marines Just Out
side Khe Sanh" needs no apolo
gy. It clearly uses "enemy" In
the sense of the Marines' enemy,
not Mr. Lisehinsky's. We will
never try to tell you who your
enemies are, Mr. Lisehinsky, ex
cept in our editorials and signed
columns.

Student Happy Opera
Wasn't Daily Reviewed
Editor, The Daily:
I was both relieved and dis
appointed that no review of last
weekend's performances of Mo
zart's opera "The Marriage of
Figaro" appeared in The Dally.
I was relieved because the cur
rent musical criticism we get in
the Daily is so intimately based
on a lack of literary ability and
musical knowledge.
I was disappointed because
this student production was eas
ily the most ambitious and en
tertaining musical offering I
have attended in my five years
at Stanford. It should not pass
unnoticed or unappreciated.
Happily, the daring of staging
such an imposing and complex
masterpiece was exceeded by the
intelligence and verve with
which the soloists performed.
Nor could the refinement and
care of Sandor Salgo's conduct
ing easily be over-estimated.
Anyone who attended one of
the two sold-out performances
will, I trust, agree with me.

Questions Objectivity
Editor, The Daily:
Last Quarter I wrote an arti
cle on the activities of the Stan
ford Anti-Draft Union and sub
mitted it to The Daily. Michael
Sweeney, the news editor at the
time, refused to print it—saying
that it contained "inflamatory
material" and lecturing me on
the criteria which objectivity de
manded that a news story satis
fy. "When are people of your
political persuasion going to
learn the difference between
news and opinion?" he asked
me, I thought, rather rhetorical
ly. Mr. Sweeney did not appear
to notice that the only opinions
in the article were clearly la
belled as quotations. However,
I left without answering his
question, confident that Stan
ford could claim a press of un
compromising objectivity.
Imagine, then, my disappoint
ment at seeing recent Daily
news stories. Whoever wrote
Monday's article on the arrest
of Black Panther Bobby Seale,
apparently felt that in the inter
est of objectivity, it was neces
sary to mention twice during
the article that Bobby Seale had
led an armed group of Panthers
into the capitol building last
year. The casual reader prob
ably gathered that the Panthers'
action at that time was illegal
—especially at the second men

tion of the incident, when it was
noted that the Panthers were
"herded out and disarmed by
security police."
Nowhere was it mentioned
that the police action was an in
fringement on the constitutional
right to bear arms. Nor, was it
mentioned that despite no for
mal charges having been filed
against Mr. Seale (in the most
recent incident), his bail was
set at $11,000, in what seems to
be an attempt by "authorities"
to exhaust the Panthers' money,
desperately needed for Huey
Newton's defense.
Mlslabled Enemy
Tuesday's Daily contains the
front-page headline: "Enemy
Traps Marines Just Outside Khe
Sanh." An objective headline
would have read: "North Viet
namese Trap Marines Outside
Khe Sanh." Was the headline
trying to suggest to the reader
that the North Vietnamese were
his enemy? Or was it merely
trying to be helpful, by inform
ing the reader that the North
Vietnamese were the enemy of
the U.S. Marines? If the writer
thought that Stanford students
needed that help, he could have
made the situation clear in the
body of the article.
That some articles are "com
piled from the Associated Press"
ought not to excuse The Daily.
Surely Stanford deserves more
than a parroting of wire service
dispatches.
I hope Mr. Sweeney will act
upon the code he professes—by
cooling the ardor of some mem
bers of his news staff. If, how
ever, Mr. Sweeney no longer
makes a claim to objectivity,
and insists upon labelling one
side as the "enemy," then I
suggest that he consider what
is becoming clear to more and
more of his readers every day
—that the real enemy of the
American people is not the "Viet
Cong" or the "North Vietnam
ese," but, rather, the United
States government.

EDITOR'S REPLY: Mr. Lis
chinsky's interest in objectivity
is refreshing.
I do not recall the article on
the anti-draft union which he
mentions. Therefore I cannot re
ply to his allegation that it was
unjustly rejected. I would like
to point out, however, that THE
DAILY has run several articles
on the anti-draft union, as well

as many concerning the Resis
tance, Students for a Democrat
ic Society, and Peace and Free
dom Party. This coverage has
caused some conservatives to
question our objectivity.
The article on Bobby Seale
was written by the Associated
Press. Although hardly a model
of objectivity, the AP usually
gives a balanced view. I would
choose the AP's version of the
truth over Mr. Lisehinsky's.
I hope Mr. Lisehinsky and oth
er readers will realize the diffi
culty of writing headlines which
exactly convey the tone of an
article. But the headline "En
emy Traps Marines Just Out
side Khe Sanh" needs no apolo
gy. It clearly uses "enemy" In
the sense of the Marines' enemy,
not Mr. Lisehinsky's. We will
never try to tell you who your
enemies are, Mr. Lisehinsky, ex
cept in our editorials and signed
columns.

Student Happy Opera

Editor, The Daily:
I was both relieved and dis

I was relieved because the cur

I was disappointed because
this student production was eas
ily the most ambitious and en

Happily, the daring of staging
such an imposing and complex

I left without answering his
question, confident that Stan
ford could claim a press of un
compromising objectivity.
Imagine, then, my disappoint
ment at seeing recent Daily
news stories. Whoever wrote
Monday's article on the arrest
of Black Panther Bobby Seale,
apparently felt that in the inter
est of objectivity, it was neces
sary to mention twice during
the article that Bobby Seale had
led an armed group of Panthers
into the capitol building last
year. The casual reader prob
ably gathered that the Panthers'
action at that time was illegal
—especially at the second men

tion of the incident, when it was
noted that the Panthers were
"herded out and disarmed by
security police."
Nowhere was it mentioned
that the police action was an in
fringement on the constitutional
right to bear arms. Nor, was it
mentioned that despite no for
mal charges having been filed
against Mr. Seale (in the most
recent incident), his bail was
set at $11,000, in what seems to
be an attempt by "authorities"
to exhaust the Panthers' money,
desperately needed for Huey
Newton's defense.
Mlslabled Enemy
Tuesday's Daily contains the
front-page headline: "Enemy
Traps Marines Just Outside Khe
Sanh." An objective headline
would have read: "North Viet
namese Trap Marines Outside
Khe Sanh." Was the headline
trying to suggest to the reader
that the North Vietnamese were
his enemy? Or was it merely
trying to be helpful, by inform
ing the reader that the North
Vietnamese were the enemy of
the U.S. Marines? If the writer
thought that Stanford students
needed that help, he could have
made the situation clear in the
body of the article.
That some articles are "com
piled from the Associated Press"
ought not to excuse The Daily.
Surely Stanford deserves more
than a parroting of wire service
dispatches.
I hope Mr. Sweeney will act
upon the code he professes—by
cooling the ardor of some mem
bers of his news staff. If, how
ever, Mr. Sweeney no longer
makes a claim to objectivity,
and insists upon labelling one
side as the "enemy," then I
suggest that he consider what
is becoming clear to more and
more of his readers every day
—that the real enemy of the
American people is not the "Viet
Cong" or the "North Vietnam
ese," but, rather, the United
States government.

EDITOR'S REPLY: Mr. Lis
chinsky's interest in objectivity
is refreshing.
I do not recall the article on
the anti-draft union which he
mentions. Therefore I cannot re
ply to his allegation that it was
unjustly rejected. I would like
to point out, however, that THE
DAILY has run several articles
on the anti-draft union, as well

as many concerning the Resis
tance, Students for a Democrat
ic Society, and Peace and Free
dom Party. This coverage has
caused some conservatives to
question our objectivity.
The article on Bobby Seale
was written by the Associated
Press. Although hardly a model
of objectivity, the AP usually
gives a balanced view. I would
choose the AP's version of the
truth over Mr. Lisehinsky's.
I hope Mr. Lisehinsky and oth
er readers will realize the diffi
culty of writing headlines which
exactly convey the tone of an
article. But the headline "En
emy Traps Marines Just Out
side Khe Sanh" needs no apolo
gy. It clearly uses "enemy" In
the sense of the Marines' enemy,
not Mr. Lisehinsky's. We will
never try to tell you who your
enemies are, Mr. Lisehinsky, ex
cept in our editorials and signed
columns.

Student Happy Opera

Editor, The Daily:
I was both relieved and dis

zart's opera "The Marriage of
Figaro" appeared in The Dally.
I was relieved because the cur
rent musical criticism we get in
the Daily is so intimately based
on a lack of literary ability and
musical knowledge.
I was disappointed because
this student production was eas
ily the most ambitious and en
tertaining musical offering I
have attended in my five years
at Stanford. It should not pass
unnoticed or unappreciated.
Happily, the daring of staging
such an imposing and complex
masterpiece was exceeded by the
intelligence and verve with
which the soloists performed.
Nor could the refinement and

I would like to correct a mis
impression created by the article
"New Draft Regs Final" that
was published in Monday's
Daily. In that article Mr. An
thony of the College Press Ser
vice News Analysis stated:
"The real power in question
connected with the military
rests with legislators like
Rep. Mendel Rivers (D., S.C.)
and Sen. Richard Russell (D.,
Ga.), chairmen of the armed
services committees in their
respective branches of Con
gress.
Neither has referred public
ly to the Administration's
new policy. An assistant to
Rivers, however, has pointed
out that the policy comes
close to what his committee
recommended after its draft
hearings last year."
An article in the preceding
Saturday's New York Times
(Feb. 24, 1968 at P. 4) however,
indicates that this report is in
accurate. The article reported a
letter sent from Chairman Riv
ers to General Hershey:
"Mr. Rivers demanded that
the Administration explain
why it had not fulfilled a
pledge to draft younger men
first. In a letter to General
Hershey, he emphasized that
Congress, a civilian advisory
panel to his committee, the
Defense Department, a Pres
idential commission and Pres
ident Johnson himself had all
proposed reversing the pres
ent order of military call up,
in which the oldest eligible
men are taken first."
The letter went on to ask why
action had not been taken to
fulfill the Presidential pledge to
Congress in March of 1967 that
the youngest males be taken
first.
It is quite possible that Rep.
Rivers is expressing the Defense
Department's discontent with
the President's reaffirmation of
his earlier declaration. While
Rep. Rivers and college students
and administration make
strange bedfellows, it is difficult
to determine what will result.
Possibly, Mr. Anthony's con
clusions are accurate, but it re
mains an open question what
changes might yet take place.

mentioned that despite no for
mal charges having been filed
against Mr. Seale (in the most
recent incident), his bail was
set at $11,000, in what seems to
be an attempt by "authorities"
to exhaust the Panthers' money,
desperately needed for Huey
Newton's defense.
Mlslabled Enemy
Tuesday's Daily contains the
front-page headline: "Enemy
Traps Marines Just Outside Khe
Sanh." An objective headline
would have read: "North Viet
namese Trap Marines Outside
Khe Sanh." Was the headline
trying to suggest to the reader
that the North Vietnamese were
his enemy? Or was it merely
trying to be helpful, by inform
ing the reader that the North
Vietnamese were the enemy of
the U.S. Marines? If the writer
thought that Stanford students
needed that help, he could have
made the situation clear in the
body of the article.
That some articles are "com
piled from the Associated Press"
ought not to excuse The Daily.
Surely Stanford deserves more
than a parroting of wire service
dispatches.
I hope Mr. Sweeney will act
upon the code he professes—by
cooling the ardor of some mem
bers of his news staff. If, how
ever, Mr. Sweeney no longer
makes a claim to objectivity,
and insists upon labelling one
side as the "enemy," then I
suggest that he consider what
is becoming clear to more and
more of his readers every day
—that the real enemy of the
American people is not the "Viet
Cong" or the "North Vietnam
ese," but, rather, the United
States government.

EDITOR'S REPLY: Mr. Lis
chinsky's interest in objectivity
is refreshing.
I do not recall the article on
the anti-draft union which he
mentions. Therefore I cannot re
ply to his allegation that it was
unjustly rejected. I would like
to point out, however, that THE
DAILY has run several articles
on the anti-draft union, as well

as many concerning the Resis
tance, Students for a Democrat
ic Society, and Peace and Free
dom Party. This coverage has
caused some conservatives to
question our objectivity.
The article on Bobby Seale
was written by the Associated
Press. Although hardly a model
of objectivity, the AP usually
gives a balanced view. I would
choose the AP's version of the
truth over Mr. Lisehinsky's.
I hope Mr. Lisehinsky and oth
er readers will realize the diffi
culty of writing headlines which
exactly convey the tone of an
article. But the headline "En
emy Traps Marines Just Out
side Khe Sanh" needs no apolo
gy. It clearly uses "enemy" In
the sense of the Marines' enemy,
not Mr. Lisehinsky's. We will
never try to tell you who your
enemies are, Mr. Lisehinsky, ex
cept in our editorials and signed
columns.

Student Happy Opera
Wasn't Daily Reviewed
Editor, The Daily:
I was both relieved and dis
appointed that no review of last
weekend's performances of Mo
zart's opera "The Marriage of
Figaro" appeared in The Dally.
I was relieved because the cur
rent musical criticism we get in
the Daily is so intimately based
on a lack of literary ability and
musical knowledge.
I was disappointed because
this student production was eas
ily the most ambitious and en
tertaining musical offering I
have attended in my five years
at Stanford. It should not pass
unnoticed or unappreciated.
Happily, the daring of staging
such an imposing and complex
masterpiece was exceeded by the
intelligence and verve with
which the soloists performed.
Nor could the refinement and
care of Sandor Salgo's conduct
ing easily be over-estimated.
Anyone who attended one of
the two sold-out performances
will, I trust, agree with me.
GARY SCHMIDGALL

Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct a mis
impression created by the article
"New Draft Regs Final" that
was published in Monday's
Daily. In that article Mr. An
thony of the College Press Ser
vice News Analysis stated:
"The real power in question
connected with the military
rests with legislators like
Rep. Mendel Rivers (D., S.C.)
and Sen. Richard Russell (D.,
Ga.), chairmen of the armed
services committees in their
respective branches of Con
gress.
Neither has referred public
ly to the Administration's
new policy. An assistant to
Rivers, however, has pointed
out that the policy comes
close to what his committee
recommended after its draft
hearings last year."
An article in the preceding
Saturday's New York Times
(Feb. 24, 1968 at P. 4) however,
indicates that this report is in
accurate. The article reported a
letter sent from Chairman Riv
ers to General Hershey:
"Mr. Rivers demanded that
the Administration explain
why it had not fulfilled a
pledge to draft younger men
first. In a letter to General
Hershey, he emphasized that
Congress, a civilian advisory
panel to his committee, the
Defense Department, a Pres
idential commission and Pres
ident Johnson himself had all
proposed reversing the pres
ent order of military call up,
in which the oldest eligible
men are taken first."
The letter went on to ask why
action had not been taken to
fulfill the Presidential pledge to
Congress in March of 1967 that
the youngest males be taken
first.
It is quite possible that Rep.
Rivers is expressing the Defense
Department's discontent with
the President's reaffirmation of
his earlier declaration. While
Rep. Rivers and college students
and administration make
strange bedfellows, it is difficult
to determine what will result.
Possibly, Mr. Anthony's con
clusions are accurate, but it re
mains an open question what
changes might yet take place.

Questions Objectivity
Editor, The Daily:
Last Quarter I wrote an arti
cle on the activities of the Stan
ford Anti-Draft Union and sub
mitted it to The Daily. Michael
Sweeney, the news editor at the
time, refused to print it—saying
that it contained "inflamatory
material" and lecturing me on
the criteria which objectivity de
manded that a news story satis
fy. "When are people of your
political persuasion going to
learn the difference between
news and opinion?" he asked
me, I thought, rather rhetorical
ly. Mr. Sweeney did not appear
to notice that the only opinions
in the article were clearly la
belled as quotations. However,
I left without answering his
question, confident that Stan
ford could claim a press of un
compromising objectivity.
Imagine, then, my disappoint
ment at seeing recent Daily
news stories. Whoever wrote
Monday's article on the arrest
of Black Panther Bobby Seale,
apparently felt that in the inter
est of objectivity, it was neces
sary to mention twice during
the article that Bobby Seale had
led an armed group of Panthers
into the capitol building last
year. The casual reader prob
ably gathered that the Panthers'
action at that time was illegal
—especially at the second men

tion of the incident, when it was
noted that the Panthers were
"herded out and disarmed by
security police."
Nowhere was it mentioned
that the police action was an in
fringement on the constitutional
right to bear arms. Nor, was it
mentioned that despite no for
