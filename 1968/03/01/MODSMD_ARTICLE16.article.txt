## A 						Drug Crackdown Coming?

"The University will take
whatever steps, including dis
cliplinary action, may be re
quired to safeguard the cam
pus against drug abuse."
—Statement by the President
on Drug Abuse
Now what does that mean?
Safeguarding the Stanford
campus against drug abuse
would mean arresting a large
percentage of the students and
faculty, making frequent search
es for hidden marijuana and
LSD, and flushing out pushers
with night time raids.
But don't go empty your lid
out the window because you're
afraid your R.A. is going to
break down the door with a
squad of narcotics agents. If we
read between the lines of the
University's drug statement, it
conveys a totally different mes
sage.
Some background is essential
to understanding T u e s d a y's
statement. Until then Stanford
had kept a deafening silence on
the drug question, even while
use of marijuana and LSD sky
rocketed on campus. A survey
of drug use by Richard Blum
taken last spring was kept se
cret until Tuesday. It showed
one out of five undergraduates
had smoked grass.
Then Stony Brook. Zealous
New York state police infiltrated
that campus with undercover
agents and identified distribu
tors of marijuana. Then in an
early-morning raid Jan. 18,
scores of police invaded dormi
tories and arrested 46 students.
Administrators at the state
campus were lambasted in the
legislature for permitting open
drug use. One dean was even
accused of tipping off stoned
students about a police raid.
Since Stony Brook, Stanford
Provost Richard W. Lyman says
he has become "increasing un
easy" about conditions here.
It has been widely assumed
that Stanford has some tacit
agreement with state and local
police to keep them from raid
ing campus marijuana users.
Thus while local high schools
are beset weekly by arrests,
Stanford stays clean.
But Lyman and Dean of Stu
dents Joel Smith insist that
"There is no understanding
whatsoever with any police
agency."
Santa Clara County deputies
may avoid the campus out of
tradition or because we have
our own security force, but

Smith says the University hasn't
even had "conversations" about
drug use with outside police.
So Stanford had no assurance
that a Stony Brook Fiasco
couldn't happen here. The Uni
versity had to cover its position
by a strong assertion that it
"explicitly refuses to act as a
sanctuary from enforcement of
the drug laws." The drug state
ment was drawn up and submit
ted to the Board of Trustees
Feb. 15.
What now? The statement
threatens "disciplinary action."
Does this mean Smith will start
raiding dormitories? No.
If he is told about a student
using or selling drugs, Smith
doesn't even say he will initiate
University judicial action.
"There are a wide range" of
"responses" he says he may use,
such as discussion of the prob
lem with the student.
"It would be a great mistake
for us to spell out what would
happen," Smith says in response
to questions about exact poli
cies.
Hard-Core Case
Even if a hard-core, incorrigi
ble LSD pusher were finally
called on the carpet by Smith
and expelled, the action would
be kept secret from civil au
thorities. Smith says all Uni
versity disciplinary action is se
cret, and he "emphatically" re
jects any "obligation to report"
drug cases to police.
And Smith doesn't "pledge to
necessarily initiate investiga
tion" in response to any request
by outside narcotics agents.
Another hypothetical case was
posed: what if police tried to
hire students as undercover nar
cotics agents, like the New
York cops did? Lyman says he
would be "uneasy about any or
ganized network of investigation
on the Stanford campus."
What if Santa Clara County
narcotics agents asked Smith's
approval of undercover police in
vestigation of campus resi
dences? Smith says"I would
actively oppose our active par
ticipation in investigations of
the kind you describe."
Now take another look at
that menacing statement on
drug abuse: "While the Univer
sity is not a law enforcement
agency, it is unequivocally com
mitted to respect for law and its
orderly modification through the
democratic process."
Does this imply that certain
administrators don't believe the

punishment for smoking a joint
should be five years in prison?
That's right, friend. The state
ment also professes "concern
over . . . damage done to the
careers and individual happiness
of those who incur the penalties

imposed by the laws regulating
drugs."
So the University's intentions
aren't so ominous after all.
Aren't you glad now you
didn't empty your lid out the
window?

University judicial action.
"There are a wide range" of
"responses" he says he may use,
such as discussion of the prob
lem with the student.
"It would be a great mistake
for us to spell out what would
happen," Smith says in response
to questions about exact poli
cies.
Hard-Core Case
Even if a hard-core, incorrigi
ble LSD pusher were finally
called on the carpet by Smith
and expelled, the action would
be kept secret from civil au
thorities. Smith says all Uni
versity disciplinary action is se
cret, and he "emphatically" re
jects any "obligation to report"
drug cases to police.
And Smith doesn't "pledge to
necessarily initiate investiga
tion" in response to any request
by outside narcotics agents.
Another hypothetical case was
posed: what if police tried to
hire students as undercover nar
cotics agents, like the New
York cops did? Lyman says he
would be "uneasy about any or
ganized network of investigation
on the Stanford campus."
What if Santa Clara County
narcotics agents asked Smith's
approval of undercover police in
vestigation of campus resi
dences? Smith says"I would
actively oppose our active par
ticipation in investigations of
the kind you describe."
Now take another look at
that menacing statement on
drug abuse: "While the Univer
sity is not a law enforcement
agency, it is unequivocally com
mitted to respect for law and its
orderly modification through the
democratic process."
Does this imply that certain
administrators don't believe the

punishment for smoking a joint
should be five years in prison?
That's right, friend. The state
ment also professes "concern
over . . . damage done to the
careers and individual happiness
of those who incur the penalties

imposed by the laws regulating
drugs."
So the University's intentions
aren't so ominous after all.
Aren't you glad now you
didn't empty your lid out the
window?
"The University will take
whatever steps, including dis
cliplinary action, may be re
quired to safeguard the cam
pus against drug abuse."
—Statement by the President
on Drug Abuse
Now what does that mean?
Safeguarding the Stanford
campus against drug abuse
would mean arresting a large
percentage of the students and
faculty, making frequent search
es for hidden marijuana and
LSD, and flushing out pushers
with night time raids.
But don't go empty your lid
out the window because you're
afraid your R.A. is going to
break down the door with a
squad of narcotics agents. If we
read between the lines of the
University's drug statement, it
conveys a totally different mes
sage.
Some background is essential
to understanding T u e s d a y's
statement. Until then Stanford
had kept a deafening silence on
the drug question, even while
use of marijuana and LSD sky
rocketed on campus. A survey
of drug use by Richard Blum
taken last spring was kept se
cret until Tuesday. It showed
one out of five undergraduates
had smoked grass.
Then Stony Brook. Zealous
New York state police infiltrated
that campus with undercover
agents and identified distribu
tors of marijuana. Then in an
early-morning raid Jan. 18,
scores of police invaded dormi
tories and arrested 46 students.
Administrators at the state
campus were lambasted in the
legislature for permitting open
drug use. One dean was even
accused of tipping off stoned
students about a police raid.
Since Stony Brook, Stanford
Provost Richard W. Lyman says
he has become "increasing un
easy" about conditions here.
It has been widely assumed
that Stanford has some tacit
agreement with state and local
police to keep them from raid
ing campus marijuana users.
Thus while local high schools
are beset weekly by arrests,
Stanford stays clean.
But Lyman and Dean of Stu
dents Joel Smith insist that
"There is no understanding
whatsoever with any police
agency."
Santa Clara County deputies
may avoid the campus out of
tradition or because we have
our own security force, but

Smith says the University hasn't
even had "conversations" about
drug use with outside police.
So Stanford had no assurance
that a Stony Brook Fiasco
couldn't happen here. The Uni
versity had to cover its position
by a strong assertion that it
"explicitly refuses to act as a
sanctuary from enforcement of
the drug laws." The drug state
ment was drawn up and submit
ted to the Board of Trustees
Feb. 15.
What now? The statement
threatens "disciplinary action."
Does this mean Smith will start
raiding dormitories? No.
If he is told about a student
using or selling drugs, Smith
doesn't even say he will initiate
University judicial action.
"There are a wide range" of
"responses" he says he may use,

statement. Until then Stanford
had kept a deafening silence on
the drug question, even while
use of marijuana and LSD sky
rocketed on campus. A survey
of drug use by Richard Blum
taken last spring was kept se
cret until Tuesday. It showed
one out of five undergraduates
had smoked grass.
Then Stony Brook. Zealous
New York state police infiltrated
that campus with undercover
agents and identified distribu
tors of marijuana. Then in an
early-morning raid Jan. 18,
scores of police invaded dormi
tories and arrested 46 students.
Administrators at the state
campus were lambasted in the
legislature for permitting open
drug use. One dean was even
accused of tipping off stoned
students about a police raid.
Since Stony Brook, Stanford
Provost Richard W. Lyman says
he has become "increasing un
easy" about conditions here.
It has been widely assumed
that Stanford has some tacit
agreement with state and local
police to keep them from raid
ing campus marijuana users.
Thus while local high schools
are beset weekly by arrests,
Stanford stays clean.
But Lyman and Dean of Stu
dents Joel Smith insist that
"There is no understanding
whatsoever with any police
agency."
Santa Clara County deputies
may avoid the campus out of
tradition or because we have
our own security force, but

Smith says the University hasn't
even had "conversations" about
drug use with outside police.
So Stanford had no assurance
that a Stony Brook Fiasco
couldn't happen here. The Uni
versity had to cover its position
by a strong assertion that it
"explicitly refuses to act as a
sanctuary from enforcement of
the drug laws." The drug state
ment was drawn up and submit
ted to the Board of Trustees
Feb. 15.
What now? The statement
threatens "disciplinary action."
Does this mean Smith will start
raiding dormitories? No.
If he is told about a student
using or selling drugs, Smith
doesn't even say he will initiate
University judicial action.
"There are a wide range" of
"responses" he says he may use,
such as discussion of the prob
lem with the student.
"It would be a great mistake
for us to spell out what would
happen," Smith says in response
to questions about exact poli
cies.
Hard-Core Case
Even if a hard-core, incorrigi
ble LSD pusher were finally
called on the carpet by Smith
and expelled, the action would
be kept secret from civil au
thorities. Smith says all Uni
versity disciplinary action is se
cret, and he "emphatically" re
jects any "obligation to report"
drug cases to police.
And Smith doesn't "pledge to
necessarily initiate investiga
tion" in response to any request
by outside narcotics agents.
Another hypothetical case was
posed: what if police tried to
hire students as undercover nar
cotics agents, like the New
York cops did? Lyman says he
would be "uneasy about any or
ganized network of investigation
on the Stanford campus."
What if Santa Clara County
narcotics agents asked Smith's
approval of undercover police in
vestigation of campus resi
dences? Smith says"I would
actively oppose our active par
ticipation in investigations of
the kind you describe."
Now take another look at
that menacing statement on
drug abuse: "While the Univer
sity is not a law enforcement
agency, it is unequivocally com
mitted to respect for law and its
orderly modification through the
democratic process."
Does this imply that certain
administrators don't believe the

punishment for smoking a joint
should be five years in prison?
That's right, friend. The state
ment also professes "concern
over . . . damage done to the
careers and individual happiness
of those who incur the penalties

imposed by the laws regulating
drugs."
So the University's intentions
aren't so ominous after all.
Aren't you glad now you
didn't empty your lid out the
window?
"The University will take
whatever steps, including dis
cliplinary action, may be re
quired to safeguard the cam
pus against drug abuse."
—Statement by the President
on Drug Abuse
Now what does that mean?
Safeguarding the Stanford
campus against drug abuse
would mean arresting a large
percentage of the students and
faculty, making frequent search
es for hidden marijuana and
LSD, and flushing out pushers
with night time raids.
But don't go empty your lid
out the window because you're
afraid your R.A. is going to
break down the door with a
squad of narcotics agents. If we
read between the lines of the
University's drug statement, it
conveys a totally different mes
sage.
