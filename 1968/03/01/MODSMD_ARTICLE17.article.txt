## Kott's 'Orestes' seeks meaning in post 
### 
JAN KOTT'S production of Orestes by Euripides opened at
the University of California at Berkeley two weeks ago. Profes
sor Kott, in residence at Berkeley, is the famous Polish exponent
of Shakespeare as a uniquely contemporary dramatist. His dark
and existential readings of the literature of the past are provoca
tive and often convincing. In Euripides' Orestes he has found
a play especially suited to his critical and dramatic predilections.
The prevailing metaphor of the production is the present
world of violent young people searching in vain among the
shapes of the past to discover possible meaning in the chaos
and horror of today, and maybe a way to escape. A setting of
abstract black forms in a small velvet-black theatre concentrates
audience attention on the back-stage wall — a giant photogra
phic blow-up of the U.S. Capitol and its immediate neighbor
hood. The Capitol building is, of course, the House of Atreus at
Argos. Large double doors open down a line through the Capi
tol dome and the East Portico.
As the play begins, Orestes and Electra are afflicted with the

fear and guilt attendant to their murder of their mother. Orestes
also suffers periods of madness when the Furies bear down on
his helpless spirit. In these early scenes, we feel some sympathy
for Orestes and Electra; we respond to Orestes' appeal for life,
however irrational it may be. Paroles in All's Well That Ends
Well, facing execution, says, "Simply the thing I am shall make
me live." This is the claim of Orestes too. His humanity is its
own excuse; his crime, though great, is comprehensible, his per
sonal worth apparent.
But as the play progresses (and it is here, I think, that Kott's
production has hold of the real meaning of the play), Orestes
progressively loses that humanity. The life principle is replaced
by the principle of death and vengeance. From the moment that
Menelaus arrives as a Hollywood cliche of the American Air
Force General and refuses to help Orestes and Electra escape,
Orestes becomes as contemptible, cruel, and paranoid as the
world in which he lives. What Orestes learns is that his crime is
not unique, that it is but another metaphor for the world he in
habits. So, he "joins the club,"and we in the audience are set
adrift with no landmarks for our sympathies. We stand alien
ated, like Orestes, in a world as horrible as we dared imagine.
More and more we come to realize that it is Helen whose
reality is shaping this world. She appears a tall, handsome blonde
in a black lace bikini lingerie, her face a stylized mask of clown
white makeup slashed by a huge red mouth to match the red
cloth slash over that other orifice, scarcely hidden by the bikini
briefs.
As the world sickens around Orestes' loss of innocence, as he
trades his personal madness for the collective psychosis, we
learn that the principle of Helen, ruthless sexuality, has ruled
from the beginning. The sexual athleticism, variations on the
sexual act by the chorus as it mimes Clyemnestra's murder of
Agamemnon and her union with Aegisthus, is an exciting and
pivotal moment in the production, warning us that such public
compulsions are the signs of the times.
This choral moment, reminiscent of The Mousetrap in Ham
let, is a most artful and vibrantly erotic scene of sexual mech
anics. The chorus, a radically mixed bag of young hips, plays
with great purity, conviction and courage.
Conventional literary criticism has tended to boggle when
faced with the catastrophe of this play. When it is apparent that
everyone must die and all be consumed in flames, there comes
the seemingly gratuitous deus ex machina. Apollo appears with
Helen who was not murdered by Orestes and Pylades after all,
but taken up mysteriously by the god. Apollo solves everything
by arbitrarily ordering marriages that are supposed to result in
pacification.
Kott has solved this problem of seeming irrelevance brilliant
ly. He takes a hint from a line of Orestes indicating that the epi
phany of the god may not be that of Apollo at all, but a fiend,
and represents Apollo (?) by a recorded voice only. Thus the
epiphany is obscured in ambiguity. But what is not ambiguous
is the presence of the demon goddess, nee Helen, on a North
Beach Club swing for topless and bottomless girls.
There she is presiding over her world, swinging back and
forth amid the flames that consume the Capitol-Palace. With
that ugly, red smile fixed on her white face, her nudity undulat
ing to the rhythm of the fire that consumes the world, she makes
of the final absurd pairing-off a grotesque proof that there is
nothing that cannot be solved by animal coupling a la Orestes
with the teeny-bopper Hermione or Pylades and his Harley-
Davidson Hog with Electra. Even Menelaus is told to get him
self a new woman.
The closing rock dance, an orgy of dispirited sexuality, stands
as a symbol for the only kind of exaltation that these Euripidean
characters can know. It is a cruel reconciliation, but there is no
other. This is the message of Euripides and Kott.
Only a few things about the production give pause for doubt.
The motion picture interlude is unconvincing and lacked inte
gration. The tape-recorded male voice, used heavily in the first
half, is embarrassingly bad. Not even Professor Kott can make
us certain how to take the scene of Tyndareus, Helen's and Cly
temnestra's father, and his appeal to law and order in the person
of a Southern gentleman-politician type. And about Argos as
Washington, D.C., though mechanically excellent, it asks a
search for analogies that are neither neatly come by, nor con
sistent. It is the play's least essential image. Even Pylades' ar
rival on his motorcycle is more to the point.
It is tempting these days to relate all forms of mayhem and
disintegration to the United States and its war in Asia, and this
is often done significantly. But it is perhaps necessary to remem
ber that even as we condemn the hysterical cliches of the war's
most passionate defenders, our own passions may lead to hyster
ical cliches, and overstatement, every bit as self defeating. This
loss is not only to the nation and its people, but to art itself. The
Washington, D.C. image is in this way self-defeating and the
single sin, that of useless excess, in Professor Kott's otherwise
powerful and profound Orestes.

however irrational it may be. Paroles in All's Well That Ends
Well, facing execution, says, "Simply the thing I am shall make
me live." This is the claim of Orestes too. His humanity is its
own excuse; his crime, though great, is comprehensible, his per
sonal worth apparent.
But as the play progresses (and it is here, I think, that Kott's
production has hold of the real meaning of the play), Orestes
progressively loses that humanity. The life principle is replaced
by the principle of death and vengeance. From the moment that
Menelaus arrives as a Hollywood cliche of the American Air
Force General and refuses to help Orestes and Electra escape,
Orestes becomes as contemptible, cruel, and paranoid as the
world in which he lives. What Orestes learns is that his crime is
not unique, that it is but another metaphor for the world he in
habits. So, he "joins the club,"and we in the audience are set
adrift with no landmarks for our sympathies. We stand alien
ated, like Orestes, in a world as horrible as we dared imagine.
More and more we come to realize that it is Helen whose
reality is shaping this world. She appears a tall, handsome blonde
in a black lace bikini lingerie, her face a stylized mask of clown
white makeup slashed by a huge red mouth to match the red
cloth slash over that other orifice, scarcely hidden by the bikini
briefs.
As the world sickens around Orestes' loss of innocence, as he
trades his personal madness for the collective psychosis, we
learn that the principle of Helen, ruthless sexuality, has ruled
from the beginning. The sexual athleticism, variations on the
sexual act by the chorus as it mimes Clyemnestra's murder of
Agamemnon and her union with Aegisthus, is an exciting and
pivotal moment in the production, warning us that such public
compulsions are the signs of the times.
This choral moment, reminiscent of The Mousetrap in Ham
let, is a most artful and vibrantly erotic scene of sexual mech
anics. The chorus, a radically mixed bag of young hips, plays
with great purity, conviction and courage.
Conventional literary criticism has tended to boggle when
faced with the catastrophe of this play. When it is apparent that
everyone must die and all be consumed in flames, there comes
the seemingly gratuitous deus ex machina. Apollo appears with
Helen who was not murdered by Orestes and Pylades after all,
but taken up mysteriously by the god. Apollo solves everything
by arbitrarily ordering marriages that are supposed to result in
pacification.
Kott has solved this problem of seeming irrelevance brilliant
ly. He takes a hint from a line of Orestes indicating that the epi
phany of the god may not be that of Apollo at all, but a fiend,
and represents Apollo (?) by a recorded voice only. Thus the
epiphany is obscured in ambiguity. But what is not ambiguous
is the presence of the demon goddess, nee Helen, on a North
Beach Club swing for topless and bottomless girls.
There she is presiding over her world, swinging back and
forth amid the flames that consume the Capitol-Palace. With
that ugly, red smile fixed on her white face, her nudity undulat
ing to the rhythm of the fire that consumes the world, she makes
of the final absurd pairing-off a grotesque proof that there is
nothing that cannot be solved by animal coupling a la Orestes
with the teeny-bopper Hermione or Pylades and his Harley-
Davidson Hog with Electra. Even Menelaus is told to get him
self a new woman.
The closing rock dance, an orgy of dispirited sexuality, stands
as a symbol for the only kind of exaltation that these Euripidean
characters can know. It is a cruel reconciliation, but there is no
other. This is the message of Euripides and Kott.
Only a few things about the production give pause for doubt.
The motion picture interlude is unconvincing and lacked inte
gration. The tape-recorded male voice, used heavily in the first
half, is embarrassingly bad. Not even Professor Kott can make
us certain how to take the scene of Tyndareus, Helen's and Cly
temnestra's father, and his appeal to law and order in the person
of a Southern gentleman-politician type. And about Argos as
Washington, D.C., though mechanically excellent, it asks a
search for analogies that are neither neatly come by, nor con
sistent. It is the play's least essential image. Even Pylades' ar
rival on his motorcycle is more to the point.
It is tempting these days to relate all forms of mayhem and
disintegration to the United States and its war in Asia, and this
is often done significantly. But it is perhaps necessary to remem
ber that even as we condemn the hysterical cliches of the war's
most passionate defenders, our own passions may lead to hyster
ical cliches, and overstatement, every bit as self defeating. This
loss is not only to the nation and its people, but to art itself. The
Washington, D.C. image is in this way self-defeating and the
single sin, that of useless excess, in Professor Kott's otherwise
powerful and profound Orestes.

JAN KOTT'S production of Orestes by Euripides opened at
the University of California at Berkeley two weeks ago. Profes
sor Kott, in residence at Berkeley, is the famous Polish exponent
of Shakespeare as a uniquely contemporary dramatist. His dark
and existential readings of the literature of the past are provoca
tive and often convincing. In Euripides' Orestes he has found
a play especially suited to his critical and dramatic predilections.
The prevailing metaphor of the production is the present
world of violent young people searching in vain among the
shapes of the past to discover possible meaning in the chaos
and horror of today, and maybe a way to escape. A setting of
abstract black forms in a small velvet-black theatre concentrates
audience attention on the back-stage wall — a giant photogra
phic blow-up of the U.S. Capitol and its immediate neighbor
hood. The Capitol building is, of course, the House of Atreus at
Argos. Large double doors open down a line through the Capi
tol dome and the East Portico.
As the play begins, Orestes and Electra are afflicted with the

fear and guilt attendant to their murder of their mother. Orestes
also suffers periods of madness when the Furies bear down on
his helpless spirit. In these early scenes, we feel some sympathy
for Orestes and Electra; we respond to Orestes' appeal for life,
however irrational it may be. Paroles in All's Well That Ends

white makeup slashed by a huge red mouth to match the red
cloth slash over that other orifice, scarcely hidden by the bikini
briefs.
As the world sickens around Orestes' loss of innocence, as he
trades his personal madness for the collective psychosis, we
learn that the principle of Helen, ruthless sexuality, has ruled
from the beginning. The sexual athleticism, variations on the
sexual act by the chorus as it mimes Clyemnestra's murder of
Agamemnon and her union with Aegisthus, is an exciting and
pivotal moment in the production, warning us that such public
compulsions are the signs of the times.
This choral moment, reminiscent of The Mousetrap in Ham
let, is a most artful and vibrantly erotic scene of sexual mech
anics. The chorus, a radically mixed bag of young hips, plays
with great purity, conviction and courage.
Conventional literary criticism has tended to boggle when
faced with the catastrophe of this play. When it is apparent that
everyone must die and all be consumed in flames, there comes
the seemingly gratuitous deus ex machina. Apollo appears with
Helen who was not murdered by Orestes and Pylades after all,
but taken up mysteriously by the god. Apollo solves everything
by arbitrarily ordering marriages that are supposed to result in
pacification.
Kott has solved this problem of seeming irrelevance brilliant
ly. He takes a hint from a line of Orestes indicating that the epi
phany of the god may not be that of Apollo at all, but a fiend,
and represents Apollo (?) by a recorded voice only. Thus the
epiphany is obscured in ambiguity. But what is not ambiguous
is the presence of the demon goddess, nee Helen, on a North
Beach Club swing for topless and bottomless girls.
There she is presiding over her world, swinging back and
forth amid the flames that consume the Capitol-Palace. With
that ugly, red smile fixed on her white face, her nudity undulat
ing to the rhythm of the fire that consumes the world, she makes
of the final absurd pairing-off a grotesque proof that there is
nothing that cannot be solved by animal coupling a la Orestes
with the teeny-bopper Hermione or Pylades and his Harley-
Davidson Hog with Electra. Even Menelaus is told to get him
self a new woman.
The closing rock dance, an orgy of dispirited sexuality, stands
as a symbol for the only kind of exaltation that these Euripidean
characters can know. It is a cruel reconciliation, but there is no
other. This is the message of Euripides and Kott.
Only a few things about the production give pause for doubt.
The motion picture interlude is unconvincing and lacked inte
gration. The tape-recorded male voice, used heavily in the first
half, is embarrassingly bad. Not even Professor Kott can make
us certain how to take the scene of Tyndareus, Helen's and Cly
temnestra's father, and his appeal to law and order in the person
of a Southern gentleman-politician type. And about Argos as
Washington, D.C., though mechanically excellent, it asks a
search for analogies that are neither neatly come by, nor con
sistent. It is the play's least essential image. Even Pylades' ar
rival on his motorcycle is more to the point.
It is tempting these days to relate all forms of mayhem and
disintegration to the United States and its war in Asia, and this
is often done significantly. But it is perhaps necessary to remem
ber that even as we condemn the hysterical cliches of the war's
most passionate defenders, our own passions may lead to hyster
ical cliches, and overstatement, every bit as self defeating. This
loss is not only to the nation and its people, but to art itself. The
Washington, D.C. image is in this way self-defeating and the
single sin, that of useless excess, in Professor Kott's otherwise
powerful and profound Orestes.

JAN KOTT'S production of Orestes by Euripides opened at
the University of California at Berkeley two weeks ago. Profes
sor Kott, in residence at Berkeley, is the famous Polish exponent
of Shakespeare as a uniquely contemporary dramatist. His dark
and existential readings of the literature of the past are provoca
tive and often convincing. In Euripides' Orestes he has found
a play especially suited to his critical and dramatic predilections.
The prevailing metaphor of the production is the present
world of violent young people searching in vain among the
shapes of the past to discover possible meaning in the chaos
and horror of today, and maybe a way to escape. A setting of
abstract black forms in a small velvet-black theatre concentrates
audience attention on the back-stage wall — a giant photogra
phic blow-up of the U.S. Capitol and its immediate neighbor
hood. The Capitol building is, of course, the House of Atreus at
Argos. Large double doors open down a line through the Capi
tol dome and the East Portico.
As the play begins, Orestes and Electra are afflicted with the

fear and guilt attendant to their murder of their mother. Orestes
also suffers periods of madness when the Furies bear down on
his helpless spirit. In these early scenes, we feel some sympathy
for Orestes and Electra; we respond to Orestes' appeal for life,
however irrational it may be. Paroles in All's Well That Ends
Well, facing execution, says, "Simply the thing I am shall make
me live." This is the claim of Orestes too. His humanity is its
own excuse; his crime, though great, is comprehensible, his per
sonal worth apparent.
But as the play progresses (and it is here, I think, that Kott's
production has hold of the real meaning of the play), Orestes
progressively loses that humanity. The life principle is replaced
by the principle of death and vengeance. From the moment that
Menelaus arrives as a Hollywood cliche of the American Air
Force General and refuses to help Orestes and Electra escape,
Orestes becomes as contemptible, cruel, and paranoid as the
world in which he lives. What Orestes learns is that his crime is
not unique, that it is but another metaphor for the world he in
habits. So, he "joins the club,"and we in the audience are set
adrift with no landmarks for our sympathies. We stand alien
ated, like Orestes, in a world as horrible as we dared imagine.
More and more we come to realize that it is Helen whose
reality is shaping this world. She appears a tall, handsome blonde
in a black lace bikini lingerie, her face a stylized mask of clown
white makeup slashed by a huge red mouth to match the red
cloth slash over that other orifice, scarcely hidden by the bikini
briefs.
