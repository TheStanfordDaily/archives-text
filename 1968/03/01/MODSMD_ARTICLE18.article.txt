Tripping all the way from England to Winterland, The Cream
have finally arrived. Tonight and Saturday evening at 8:00 they
will appear with Big Black and the Loading Zone. Sunday
night, they will move to the intimate atmosphere of the Fill
more.
But undoubtedly the greater majority of Stanford students
going to the City this weekend will be heading to the Civic
Center. Tonight at the Opera House, Donald Johanos, in his
San Francisco debut, will conduct with guest soloist Eugene
Istomin on the piano. The concert includes works by Mozart,
Chopin, Rachmaniolf, and Schuller's Seven Studies on themes
of Paul Klee (a veritable merging of art forms?) beginning
at 8:30.
On Saturday night, Andre Watts will give a recital at the Op
era House commencing at 8:30 including pieces by Chopin,
Haydn, Debussy, and Beethoven. The New York World Jour
nal Tribune commented, "He's the real thing." Certainly would
n't want any cheap imitation.
Sunday afternoon, Julian Bream, an English lutenist and
guitarist, will give a recital at the Curran Theatre starting at
3:00. While we're at it, the Conservatory Symphony Orchestra
will present a free concert on Wednesday at 8:30 in the Ghirar
delli Square Theatre featuring Stravinsky, Vivaldi, and Per
golesi.

Daddy Violet and Plaster Husband, both extremely funny,
continue this week at the Committee, 836 Montgomery. ACT
presents Two for the Seesaw this evening and tomorrow night
at 8:30 in the Marines' Memorial Theatre. Also, same time, same
nights, the University of San Francisco College Players will be
undertaking some serious drama in the form of Maria Stuart,
by Friederich Schiler at the Gill Theatre in Campion Hall (Ful
ton and Cole).
If you're in the vicinity of the Old Union, drop in and browse
through the exhibit there by graduate student John Pittman.
It will be here through March 7 and is well worth the time.

This week the Tresidder Friday series is presenting Godard's
Masculin Feminin, at 7:30, 8:30, and 9:30. This is an outstand
ing film by one of the most exciting contemporary directors.
Sunday the Flick is presenting A Hard Day's Night, the Beatle's
first film. The film is a fantasy-documentary of a Beatles' tour of
England, and includes several of the first popular songs.
This Saturday Tressider will show Carl Dreyer's masterpiece,
Orlet.
The Civ films are concluding with The Magnificent Seven,
a Japanese story about the defense of a village by seven profes
sional samurai. Citizen Kane, Orsen Welles' great film about
the life of W. R. Hearst is being shown as part of the Freshman
Film Series on Tuesday evening. This film is considered to be
one of the best American films of all time.
Since the Academy Award nominations have come out, local
theatres are concentrating on showing those movies which re
ceived the most awards. Of this select (?) group, Bonnie and
Clyde, which is at the Bijou and Tivoli, and The Graduate,
which is playing at Cinema 150, Belmont and The Park, are the
most worthwhile.
Black Orpheus is being revived at the Altos International. The
film is a recreation of the myth of Orpheus set in modern Rio.
Morgan, too, is coming around again at the Paris. Both films are
extremely good, though their co-features are rather poor.
