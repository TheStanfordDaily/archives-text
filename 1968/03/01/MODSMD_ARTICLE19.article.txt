# Godard epic 'Masculin Feminin' Shows modern courtship rites
## 
### 
JEAN-LUC Godard's eleventh film Is a re
sult of a number of factors: after Chris Mar
ker's Le JoU Mai, a documentary of Paris during
May, he decided to do Paris in December; alone
in Paris during the time, he took up with a
group of young people, among them Chantel
Goya, the female lead; and finally he wanted to
adapt two Maupassant stories. The final product
was MascuUn Feminln (1966) and it will be
shown at Thesidder tonight.
How he adapted the Maupassant stories is
quite indicative of his technique, because he
didn't so much adapt them as mutilate them.
In the first, Femme de Paul (Paul's Girl), Paul
kills himself when he discovers that his girl is
a Lesbian. The second, Le Signe (The Signal),
is about a woman who imitates a prostitute by
nodding to a man from her window, who, to
her surprise, comes up. Expecting her husband
at any moment, she decides the quickest way
to get rid of the man is to go through with it.
Only that the hero's name is Paul and that
his girl lives with two other girjs (not Lesbians,
but very good friends) remain from the first
story by Maupassant. The second fared even
worse.
CUT to three or four minutes and inserted as
a film within a film, it is a grotesque parody of
Bergman's The Silence.
Godard does not faithfully translate literary
works to the screen but rather uses them to
react to and build on. One reason he usually
uses second rate works-thrillers is because first
rate works are not only difficult to improve
upon, but nearly impossible to translate from
one medium to another.
Masculin Femlnin is a love story, a contem
porary romance. Paul (Jean-Pierre Leaud), who
has recently returned from military service in
Algeria, meets Madeline (Chantal Goya), a
ye-ye or pop singer, in a cafe. She gets him a
job on the magazine she works for, he takes
her out, eventually moves in with her and her
roomates, and dies at The End, leaving her
pregnant and not knowing what she will do.

BUT, alas, Godard cannot tell a story, at
least not a conventional one. "It isn't my way
of doing things. I don't know how to tell stories.
I want to cover the whole ground, from all pos
sible angles, at once."
Thus he adds sketches on Vietnam, German
guilt, wicked projectionists who show films in
the wrong ratio, a brief appearance by Bardot,
a lengthy extarct from Leroi Jones' The Dutch
man, a "Dialogue with a Consumer Product,"
a shooting, a stabbing, one dating and two sex
asides and jokes.
Godard arranges these fragments and ex
tracts in the form of fifteen faits precis ("pre
cise actions") and ties them one to the other
with the thin story line. When you consider
everything he threw in, it's a wonder it works
at all, but work it does and masterfully. The
result is a 110 minute collage of dramatic texts,
improvisation, documentary, cinema vertite, in
terviews, discussions, and extracts of discus
sions.
Godard never indulges in cinematic conven
tion for its own sake; he engages the viewer
on his level. In the case of Masculin Feminin,
he presents the audience with bits of separate
ness and forces them to make the bits coherent.
To do this the audience has to think. Because
he forces the audience to supply the missing
links, to actively think about what is going on
and why, Godard is an intellectual filmaker.
The most important parts of Paul and Made
leine's relationship occur offstage—her seduc
tion and his death. Paul's seduction of Made
lein is very important to Paul and Madeleine
but not all that important in Godard's film with
Paul and Madeleine when there is so much
else to say and do in under two hours.
Likewise, Paul's death at the end of the movie
at first seems stupid because it is so arbitrary.
Yet Paul and Madeleine are after all pieces of
celluloid, not real people. Paul dies for the sim
ple, expedient reason of concluding the film,
to enable us to see Madeleine from one last an
gle, to hear her say, "I don't know." His death
is deliberately ambiguous in order, that it can
be more easily concluded.
The death of Paul is not so important because
MascuUn Feminin is not about Paul and Made
leine so much as their type, what they share
in common with others. It is no coincidence
that Godard titles the film Masculin Feminin
rather than Paul and Madeleine, and, further,
that he suggests The Children of Marx and
Coca Cola as an alternate title.
Similarly, in the initial faits precis a woman
chases a man outside the same cafe in which
Paul and Madeleine are meeting and shoots him.

Why? Later in the film, a man comes up to
Paul after, he has recorded a love paean to
Madeleine and stabs himself. Why?
Immediately prior to both these acts, Paul
has been intensely preoccupied with Madeleine.
In the first instance, he has just met her and
is trying to talk to her, half-desperately to her
coyness. The shooting annoys Paul because it
interrupts their already fragile conversation.
By ignoring the shooting except to yell "Shut
the door!" Godar.d underscores Paul's intense
involvement.
In the second action Paul and Madeleine have
had a spat in an entertainment arcade and Paul
wanders into the recordyour-voic? booth and
records, "The stars, I want to live with you,
yes, tanned in a bikini, we'll play the slot ma
chines together." Again Godard underscores
Paul's passionate preoccupation with Made
leine when Paul ignores the man stabbing
himself.
Godard maintains this dialetic questioning
and answering between the film and the audi
ence with a resplendent catalogue of audience
alienation devices. In Masculin Feniinin the frag
mented, stop-and go nature of the action, and the
constant interruptions and digressions prevent
us from feeling very close to any of the char
acters for very long.
Godard distances the audience from the film
for two main reasons. One, he constantly re
minds us that a film is a film and is not to be
confused with reality. Godard's cinema is not an
illusionistic cinema, he does not indulge in
trompe d'oeil. Secondy, he wants us to respect
his characters, not to crowd them but to let
them breathe, let them live. Godard has said,
"It is necessary to let people live their lives, not
to study them too deeply, for, if we do, we will
end up by understanding nothing." And again,
"How do you represent the inside? As a matter
of fact by staying wisely outside."
After Godard has thoroughly separated the
audience from the film, the amazing thing is
how much feeling, how much life still comes
through. The courtship rites of modern society
have never been so acutely or realistically ob
served as they are in Masculin Feminin. In a
long scene in front of a mirror, Paul watches as
Madeleine primps and plays with her hair, and
they talk about going to bed before they have
even gone out.
Paul's friend Robert (Michel Debord) flirts
aggressively with Madeline's roommate Eliza
beth (Marlene Jobert). For his job, Paul inter
views a "Miss 19" who can only smile uneasily
at Paul's questions, radiating a boundless stu
pidity. Robert patiently explains to Paul why
Dylan is a Vietnik.
Meanwhile, Paul loves Madeline but Madeline
loves her ye-yeing more. The separateness of the
fragmented scenes is repeated in the separate
ness of the characters. Paul and Madeline are
separated and can never be one for no other
than that they are two different people
who happened to have met one another. Made
leine does not share Paul's social conscience and
Paul does not realize that he could possess her
again and again and still not be fully satisfied,
still not fully possess her. Madeleine's room
mate Catherine warns him that their type is not
for him, yet he continues to scrawl anti-Vietnam
slogans on S.H.A.P.E. cars and to attend her
recording sessions.
The last time we see Paul alive he is thinking
about his survey, how the questions predeter
mine the answers, and makes observation,
"Fidelity Exists Only Outside Of Time." Under
neath Madeleine we speculate that there is noth
ing, while Paul suspects but never formulates
it. "What's in masculine?" he asks. "Mask and
ass. What's in feminine? Nothing."
Godard breathes wonder and excitement into
these fragments of a contemporary situation as
though he were discovering them for the first
time. His improvisatory style of shooting yields
a documentary-like directness which is astonish
ing in its truthfulness. Scenes such as the Dia
logue with the Miss 19, a six minute, single-take,
interview, is recording reality as it really is.
Godard never forgets that this is only one
way to present footage. "Realism," he says,
"exists only to assist and emphasize what is to
be imagined." Godard begins with the reality
he has captured on film, adds and subtracts, em
bellishes and deletes, and thereby imposes his
vision to create a highly disciplined and organiz
ed work, which when successful like Masculin
Feniinin is at the same time miraculously free
and open-ended. His genius lies in this tension
he creates between improvisation and form, in
the excitement he generates between the bits
of separateness.
