## Draft Attitude: Alienation 
### 
Deeper alienation toward the
draft and harder thinking about
their own future characterize
Stanford students who face
greater draft vulnerability next
fall, an informel campus survey
indicates.
"There's a feeling of doom,"
says Jerry H. Biederman, a sen
ior who holds a 2-S deferment
and hopes to attend the Univer
sity of Chicago Law School.
"It's obvious that I'll have
to go the judge advocate route
(to obtain a deferment)," he
adds. "Many friends are now
considering Reserve Officers

Training Corps ROTC pro
grams in graduate school."
Army ROTC spokesmen re
port the number of graduate
students applying for their two
year program doubled this year
—from about 23 to 45 individ
uals —prior to the Feb. 16 an
nouncement that there would be
no change in present deferment
policy. This makes graduating
seniors and graduate students
vulnerable for induction.
The Navy ROTC at Stanford
reports "a very substantial up
surge" in Officer's Candidate
School (OCS) applications.

These normally run about 100 a
year, but in January alone 40
students took the tests. "There
was a further surge" following
the announcement, according to
Marine Corps. Col. Robert L.
Thomas, who heads the Stanford
unit.
Several seniors take a differ
ent view:
"Hershey is a one-man show,"
says John Babbitt, a senior ma
joring in electrical engineering.
Possibly headed for defense in
dustry work, his status will be
up to the local board after grad
uation ends his 2-S deferment.
In principle, "the draft is
not a bad thing," Babbitt adds.
"But the system is poor be
cause it doesn't let people
know what is happening. It
thrives on a sort of fear."
Bruce Esterline, a senior his
tory major adds: "So many are
confused. It's unfortunate, and
it's very sad."
His own plans have been clear
for a year and a half—he in
tends to enlist in the Army, with
a preference for security work
and study in Mandarin Chinese.
Esterline considers military
service "part of my normal edu
cation." But, in common with
many of those interviewed, he
reports his friends are "more
alienated from the draft and
what it stands for."
"Hershey is a mad man. We
are now convinced of it,"he
emphasizes.
Duane Qualni, a first-year
law student says he is looking
into Navy programs but "I'd
like to be here next year."
Four-fifths of his class may be
vulnerable for induction after
June.
"As much as I'm opposed to
the war, I'm more opposed to
those who refuse to obey the
law (about the draft) because
they disagree with policy," Qua
ini adds.
Another first-year law student,
William Eads says he'll prob
ably join an OCS program if
there's no assurance he can com
plete his studies next year.

His attitude toward the war
has shifted from a year ago,
when he felt ambivalent: "I'm
not to the point where I'd refuse
to go, but I've become much
more tolerant of those who re
fuse."
Stephen J. Ammons, senior
reonomics major says he is op
posed to war, but not to the
draft. "I'm glad it's not pointed
just to the graduates but also
now toward (most) occupa
tions." "There should be a posi
tive alternative" to military ser
vice, he says. One voluntary or
ganization of students and older
adults which shares this view,
the Community for Relevant Ed
ucation, now has more than 100
members on campus.
Howard Neal, a senior po
litical science major has been
accepted for Peace Corps
training but may try law
school instead.

The Navy ROTC at Stanford
reports "a very substantial up

"Hershey is a one-man show,"
says John Babbitt, a senior ma

Possibly headed for defense in

In principle, "the draft is

"But the system is poor be
cause it doesn't let people

thrives on a sort of fear."
Bruce Esterline, a senior his

confused. It's unfortunate, and
it's very sad."
His own plans have been clear
for a year and a half—he in
tends to enlist in the Army, with
a preference for security work
and study in Mandarin Chinese.
Esterline considers military
service "part of my normal edu

reports his friends are "more
alienated from the draft and
what it stands for."
"Hershey is a mad man. We
are now convinced of it,"he
emphasizes.
Duane Qualni, a first-year

His attitude toward the war

Stephen J. Ammons, senior
