# Ignorance Is No Excuse

Travelling on foot throughout Asia Minor and Greece some nineteen cen
turies ago the Christian apostle Paul, a converted Jew, taught and pro
claimed the good news of Jesus Christ in every major town and city. Arriv
ing in ancient Athens he was amazed and provoked to see an intellectual
community so completely given to idolatry.
"So Paul, standing in the middle of the Areopagus, said, "Men of Athens,
I perceive that in every way you are very religious. For as I passed along,
and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this
inscription, "To an unknown God.' What therefore you worship as unknown,
this I proclaim to you. The God who made heaven and everything in it, being
Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in shrines made by man, nor is he
served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself
gives to all men life and breath and everything. And he has made from one
man (Adapn) every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth, having
determined allotted periods (of history) and the boundaries of their hobita
tation (nations), so that they should seek God, in hope that they might feel
after him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us, for "In him
we live and move and have our being," as even some of your poets have
said, For we are indeed his offspring." Since we are then God s offspring,
we ought not to think that the Deity is like gold, or silver, or stone, a repre
sentation by the art and imagination of man. The times of ignorance God
overlooked, but now he commands all men everywhere to repent (turn to
God), because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in
righteousness by a man whom has appointed (Jesus Christ), and of this
he has given assurance to all men by raising him from the dead' " (Acts 17).
Paul left only a handful of converts in ancient Athens. No New Testament
church sprang up in the wake of his apostolic message Yet Paul s revelation
of the nature of the true and living God is one of the most helpful messages
recorded in the Bible. The God of Israel, he tells us, is not the God of pan
theism, but a sovereign, transcendent Spirit Being, Creator and Lord of every
area of life, This God is available, close at hand and anxious in fact to com
municate with the men he has made. God, he reminds us, is just, righteous
ness and complete as a Person. He rules history and sets limits on the human
race, He has established a fixed and certain date for judging all the world
through Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ ha sbeen raised from the dead and is thus
uniquely qualified to stand at the end of history to judge the world and rule
the age to come.
Men today are scarcely different from the Greeks of Athens, arid God has
certainly not changed since Paul walked the earth and indeed He can not
change. Thinking men today thus do well to turn and heed the voice of God
who calls inviting men to cease their rebellion against his power and author
ity and to find his peace and love Ignorance is no excuse.
