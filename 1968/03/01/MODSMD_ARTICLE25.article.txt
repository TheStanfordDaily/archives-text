# Can Cure Addicts, Researcher Claims

### 
Through proper medical treat
ment, more than two out of
three "hard core" "narcotics
users can be changed into so
cially productive citizens, a
Rockefeller University research
er reported Wednesday.
But physicians still face a
"tremendous surge of irrational
ity" from society which views
these patients as "pariahs," Dr.
Vincent P. Dole told more than
100 medical students.
A Stanford graduate, Dr.
Dole developed the methadone
treatment program, now being
followed by more than 660
former heroin users in New
York City.
"Moralists have taken the view
that addicts are escapists," he
said. "That's not true. It's a mis
erable slavery."
Recent interviews with more
than 100 of New York City's
5,000 imprisoned addicts showed
nearly three out of four would
volunteer for a program that
combined six weeks of hospital
care with help in securing jobs,
Dr. Dole reported.
At present, there's 'nearly a

two-year wait for admission to
the methadone treatment pro
gram. After being stabilized on
this drug under close medical
supervision, patients receive a
single daily dose, taken orally.
"It's impossible by any func
tional test to distinguish be
tween a properly stabilized per
son on methadone and any nor
mal person not using this drug,"
Dr. Dole said.
Former heroin users treated
this way "stop thinking and
behaving as drug addicts," he
added. "We have to watch and
make sure they don't forget
to take their daily dose be
cause they cease to think
about drugs. . ..
'Their pathological drug hun
ger is gone."
Out of 760 patients who asked
for help, only a handful have
left the program voluntarily, he
said. About one in 10 have been
dropped because of behavioral
problems.
"We have to be purer than
pure," he explained. "We can't
afford to have them compromise
our whole program."
