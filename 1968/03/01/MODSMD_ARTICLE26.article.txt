## 'Sister George' Is Dead 
### GARY SALT 
Sister George died last night
and Warren Crane is directing a
funeral celebration at the Geary
Theatre through March 9. The
casket opens at 8:30 p.m. The
motive for The Killing of Sister
George is vague.
Presumably, "Applehurst", a
BBC daytime soap-opera in
which Sister. George plays a cen
tral role, is losing popularity and
shifting its values, and a strate
gic death has been decreed to
re-charge the listeners' interest.
June Buckrldge (Claire Tre
vor) Is the actress who plays
George both on and off the
radio. She is a former com
mando who smokes cigars, as
saults nuns and polishes her
Honorary Stag Award. June
is "butch."
Her flatmate, a term that is
milked for every possible in
nuendo, is Alice McNaught (Pa
tricia Sinnott) a soubrette who
does nothing unless commanded
by June. (Eat my cigar-butt.
Kiss my hem. Drink my bath
water, etc.) Alice is a childish
"dyke" in lingerie who collects
dolls and strikes coy poses.
This nifty relationship is vi
able as long as June stays alive
In the series. However, the BBC
has other ideas presented by
Mrs. Mercy (Natalie Schafer) a
glorified doom-merchant with de
lusions of sophistication who
wallows in "girlie banter" and
still asks directions to the "little
girls' room".
Evidently she expects it to
be well-stocked with little girls,
because it isn't long before she
invites Alice to pack up her dolls,
pick up her skirts, and change
partners. June's future is mighty
grim and the best Mrs. Mercy

can offer, her is the role of
"Clarabelle Cow" in a project
ed kiddie-adventure show.
There is little hope in that be
cause "everything is still in the
planning stage." That's it in a
conch-shell for Alice who leaves
Sister George to die in the series
and on the stage.
Author Frank Marcus has
conjured up an all-girl intrigue
that is at least superficially
promising all by itself but
which becomes only an inci
dent with the soap-opera
schmaltz of "Applehurst."
Ostensibly, the play is a com
edy but his women-in-drag end
up unfolding a flaccid story in
comic terms. Mr. Marcus seems
intent on showing us how close
ly a mass audience becomes at
tached to a favorite heroine and
the absurdity of the reaction
when she "dies".
He thus traps his play in a
truism of modern society that
doesn't require support much
less further ridicule. There are
some moments, but even they
are plowed under.
Polly Rowles has most of
them in her role of Madame
Xenia, a Yiddishe fortune-teller
who pops in and out predicting
Sister George's funeral but of
fering little substantial help for
the more serious problems Mar
cus has created. She is a grand
motherly wicked-witch-of-the-
North who operates more as a
device than a character.
Miss Sinnott had trouble de
ciding on her favorite dialect
but finally settled for Yorkney.
She telegraphed many of her
reactions so far ahead that they
have reservations for tomorrow
night's performance. On the
other hand, Miss Trevor's reac

tions were barely discernible
through her android-like gest
ures and movement.
Occasionally, ever her dia
logue lapsed into the my turn
your turn style of nightclub
comics that had been establish
ed by her colleagues. Miss
Schafer fulfilled the demands
of her role.
Rarely did the principals
seem comfortable with each oth
er or with the author's comic
by-play which begs for indiffer
ence. ("The Australians are mul
tiplying like rabbits") .
Marcus confronts his audience
with two conflicts, lesbianism
and failure, both of which if
handled individually may make
equal claim on our sympathies
and attention. In Sister George
however, the forces of each are
dissipated internally, on each
other, leaving an enervating neu
trality.
The fact that the grim reaper
is cutting a path through the
"Applehurst" series, cutting
down all the old favorites like
weeds should have an economic
and psychological impact on
June who stands to lose her job.
June's energies are focused on
keeping her lover away from
Mrs. Mercy who can never be
more of a threat as a sexual ri
val than she is as a business
woman.
The disappointments in the
production were compounded
by an unexpected source. At
curtain-call Misses Trevor, Sin
not, Schafer, and Rowles faced
the backs of many shallow and
ill-mannared departing audi
ence members whose future
discourtesies may constitute a
second insurmountable bar
rier.
