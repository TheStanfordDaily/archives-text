## Dollar Devaluation Soon? 
### JOHN CUNNIFF AP Business Analyst 
NEW YORK (AP) — It is in
teresting to note how France's
suggestion to the United States
that it raise the price of gold, at
first denounced as meddlesome
by outraged Americans, is now
being considered openly and se
riously.
Not perhaps by the Johnson
administration—judged at least
by official statements—but by
banks, economists, magazines,
financial experts, stock market
analysts. All are treating the
idea more logically than in their
first, strident reactions.
Pierre Rinfret, economic
consultant to American busi
ness, Ls offering "modest
odds" that the price of gold
will be raised prior to 1970.
Dr. Paul Einzig of the Com
mercial and Financial Chron
icle is willing "to stake my
whole reputation" on a price
increase.
To raise the price of gold,
which is a U.S. prerogative,
would of course benefit France
because it has accumulated huge
gold holdings, more than $5 bil
lion by recent estimate. France's
stand is clear for that reason
alone.
The rationale of a gold price
increase goes deeper however.
If the amount of money in circu
lation among trading nations is
restricted by the amount of gold
in the world, how can world
trade and commerce grow?
At present, the fact that the
United States pegs the price of
gold at $35 an ounce is the key
stone on which is built the ratio
of one currency to another. This
permits them to trade with each

other. But it is based on a limit
ed amount of gold.
This is the broad problem.
The immediate concern, how
ever, is the U.S. balance of pay
ments problem. This country is
spending more abroad than is
drawn here. Thus, dollars are
put into the hands of foreign
governments, and with these
they buy our gold.
France, more than any na
tion, has followed this policy,
for France believes the U.S.
dollar is inflated, that it really
isn't worth what we say it is.
And so they take gold instead.
If trends continue, the remain
ing $12 billion of U.S. gold will
be gone and the United States
no longer will be able to back
its pledge to foreign nations that
any dollars they hold can be re
deemed in gold. This could be
disastrous.
Solutions are being sought in
the following ways, or in combi
nations of them:
• End the balance of pay
ments deficit by encouraging
foreigners to spend more money
here and cutting our own spend
ing abroad.
• End domestice inflation so
as to make American goods
more attractive to foreign buy

ers and thus improve the bal
ance of trade. This might re
quire a tax increase and a cut
in federal spending.
These solutions deal mainly
with the immediate problem
of the U.S. balance of pay
ments deficit; they offer little
help in providing; reserves for
a growing world trade. But
additional solutions are being
considered:
• Simply tell other nations
that the United States is going
off the gold exchange standard,
that no longer will gold be given
for dollars. In effect, this would
leave the dollar as the yardstick
for measuring other currencies.
• Develop a system where the
relative values of currencies
fluctuated with each other. The
nation with the poorest pay
ments record would find its mon
ey slipping in relation to oth
ers.
• Substitute a new system of
paying bills among nations,
gradually phasing out gold and
replacing it with credits admin
istered by a multination group
called the International Mone
tary Fund.
Nevertheless, the idea of in
creasing the price of gold seems
to be in vogue at the moment.

put into the hands of foreign
governments, and with these
they buy our gold.
France, more than any na
tion, has followed this policy,
for France believes the U.S.
dollar is inflated, that it really
isn't worth what we say it is.
And so they take gold instead.
If trends continue, the remain
ing $12 billion of U.S. gold will
be gone and the United States
no longer will be able to back
its pledge to foreign nations that
any dollars they hold can be re
deemed in gold. This could be
disastrous.
Solutions are being sought in
the following ways, or in combi
nations of them:
• End the balance of pay
ments deficit by encouraging
foreigners to spend more money
here and cutting our own spend
ing abroad.
• End domestice inflation so
as to make American goods
more attractive to foreign buy

ers and thus improve the bal
ance of trade. This might re
quire a tax increase and a cut
in federal spending.
These solutions deal mainly
with the immediate problem
of the U.S. balance of pay
ments deficit; they offer little
help in providing; reserves for
a growing world trade. But
additional solutions are being
considered:
• Simply tell other nations
that the United States is going
off the gold exchange standard,
that no longer will gold be given
for dollars. In effect, this would
leave the dollar as the yardstick
for measuring other currencies.
• Develop a system where the
relative values of currencies
fluctuated with each other. The
nation with the poorest pay
ments record would find its mon
ey slipping in relation to oth
ers.
• Substitute a new system of
paying bills among nations,
gradually phasing out gold and
replacing it with credits admin
istered by a multination group
called the International Mone
tary Fund.
Nevertheless, the idea of in
creasing the price of gold seems
to be in vogue at the moment.
NEW YORK (AP) — It is in
teresting to note how France's
suggestion to the United States
that it raise the price of gold, at
first denounced as meddlesome
by outraged Americans, is now
being considered openly and se
riously.
Not perhaps by the Johnson
administration—judged at least
by official statements—but by
banks, economists, magazines,
financial experts, stock market
analysts. All are treating the
idea more logically than in their
first, strident reactions.
Pierre Rinfret, economic
consultant to American busi
ness, Ls offering "modest
odds" that the price of gold
will be raised prior to 1970.
Dr. Paul Einzig of the Com
mercial and Financial Chron
icle is willing "to stake my
whole reputation" on a price
increase.
To raise the price of gold,
which is a U.S. prerogative,
would of course benefit France
because it has accumulated huge
gold holdings, more than $5 bil
lion by recent estimate. France's
stand is clear for that reason
alone.
The rationale of a gold price
increase goes deeper however.
If the amount of money in circu
lation among trading nations is
restricted by the amount of gold
in the world, how can world
trade and commerce grow?
At present, the fact that the
United States pegs the price of
gold at $35 an ounce is the key
stone on which is built the ratio
of one currency to another. This
permits them to trade with each

other. But it is based on a limit
ed amount of gold.
This is the broad problem.
The immediate concern, how
ever, is the U.S. balance of pay
ments problem. This country is
spending more abroad than is
drawn here. Thus, dollars are
put into the hands of foreign
governments, and with these
they buy our gold.
