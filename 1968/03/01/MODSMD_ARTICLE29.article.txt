# Public Disapproves Campus Protests
## 
### 
According to two California
Polls, taken in early 1967 and
again In 1968, public sentiment
does not consider "academic
freedom" and the right to hold
campus demonstrations as part
of the same question.
The polls indicate that the
public highly favors the tax sup
port of low cost college educa
tion, but a large number of
those interviewed felt the tax
payers should have more say in
the running of the system.
Despite the "growing num
ber of demonstrations" the
public also feels that college
officials have done a reason
ably good job of keeping or
der on campuses.
There is also agreement that
to keep high standards the state
universities and college system
must stay independent of po
litical control by the governor
and the legislature.
The question of academic free
dom however, is not viewed as
liberally. A majority supports
the idea of allowing faculty pro
fessors the freedom to speak
and teach the truth as they see
it. The same majority however
did not favor letting professors

actively advocate controversial
positions or speak out against
official policy.
There is little tolerance for
students who protest and dem
onstrate against established
rules. Large majorities of the
public feel that college students
who protest and demonstrate
should be expelled.
There is also strong support
for suspending student defer
ments for those who demon
strate against the war and the
draft.
A clear majority opposed
the idea of giving students
more voice in setting campus
rules. This appears to be a re
action to students demands for
more voice in campus govern
ment.
The poll shows a discrepancy
arising between wholehearted
support of higher education and
the idea of complete academic
freedom. For this reason the
public would like to see offend
ers harshly punished.
As the college interpretation
of freedom continues to expand,
there could be more withdrawal
of public support from the uni
versity system.
