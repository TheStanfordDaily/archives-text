# Rivers, Kennedy Propose New Draft Law Reforms
## 
### 
House Armed Services Com
mittee Chairman L. Mendel Riv
ers has urged changes that
would make the recent removal
of draft deferments less trau
matic for graduate students.
The South Carolina Democrat,
who, through his chairmanship,
has a good deal of influence on
military policy, recommended
that 19-year-olds be drafted first
and that graduate students,
when drafted, be allowed to fin
ish their year in school.
According to an order handed
down last week all draft-eligible
first-year graduate students and
graduating seniors, except those
in medical and allied fields, will
not be able to get draft defer
ments for next year.
Furthermore, since the pres
ent order of call requires the
drafting of the oldest regis
trants first, the seniors and
graduate students will all be at
the top of the draft calls this
June, unless the order is
changed.
Rivers noted that the Army,
President Johnson's draft com
mission, and Congress had all

agreed that the change in the
order of call should be made.
The representative added that
the President had said last year
he would make such a change.
"Yet," he continued, "for rea
sons that are not quite clear a
decision has been made by the
President either to defer action
on this recommendation or to
abandon it altogether."
In the Senate, Edward M.
Kennedy, the Massachusetts
Democrat, proposed legislation
which would affect a comprehen
sive reform of the draft, includ
ing the suspension of defer
ments for college undergradu
ates during certain wartime con
ditions.
In a speech on the Senate
floor, he explained major points
of the 150-page bill. He argued
that the war in Vietnam has fo
cused attention on the need for
draft reform.
He described the present law
as a "patchwork of piecemeal
additions and alterations.
The most controversial fea
ture of the bill would be the
creation of a system of random
selection or draft lottery.
