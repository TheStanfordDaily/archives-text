# Brochers, Crenshaw Carry Tribe Hopes
## Stanford To Host Pacific-8 Mat Meet 
### E. NICHOLAS SELBY 
Stanford hosts the Pacific-8
wrestling championships tomor
row in what could be the first
step toward an NCAA cham
pionship for two Tribe grapplers.
Co-captains Lenny Borchers
and Terry Crenshaw assault the
conference mats at noon for. the
first round in the 160 and 191
pound weight classes.

If all goes according to coach
Dave Reed's schedule, the pair
will enter the final round at 8.
Consolation finals begin at 7 in
the Pavilion.
Both Borchers and Crenshaw
captured fourth places in the
nationals at Kent State Uni
versity last year, with Borch
ers dropping a close 7-5 deci
sion In the semifinals to sec

cond place finisher Wayne
Wells of Oklahoma.
A first or second place finish
in the conference this year would
assure these Indians of a trip
to the nationals at Penn State
this year from March 21-23.
Borchers utilizes lightning
single leg takedowns and a pat
ented stand-up escape move,
while Crenshaw favors use of

leg maneuvers to control his
opponent and work for a pin.
Other Indians who figure
prominently in Real's plans
for an upset conference win in
clude 145 pounder John Suttle,
152 pounder Bill Vogelpohl,
and senior 177 pounder Bud
Hollingberry. Suttle has miss
ed most of the season with
numerous Injuries, but ap
pears in shape for the confer
ence matches.
Although Stanford did not win
a majority of its duel meets, it
does have an outside chance for
a first place. Two winners and
three other place winners could
produce points and surprise the
pre-tournament favorite, Oregon
State.
Oregon State has won the con
ference title 10 of the past 11
years ,and this year it has de
feated the team which provided
the West Coast with its best
finisher in the nationals last
year, Portland State.
Heavyweight Jess Lewis, a
member of the 1966 World
team for the United States,
spearheads the Beaver on
slaught, and has the potential
to be named the tourney's out
standing wrestler.
Other OSU horses include 145
pounder Phil Frey and 177
pounder Jim Blackford, who
both took conference titles last

year.
UCLA enters a well balanced
team, with 115 pounder Sergio
Gonzales and 191 pounder Rich
Witington carrying the Bruins'
individual title hopes. The Bruins
loom as major contenders for
second place.
The tournament promises to
be the best the AAWU has pro
duced, for West Coast wrest
ling is fast making Inroads on
the traditional eastern powers,
Lehigh, Penn State, and Syn*-
cuse, and on the midwest
giants, Oklahoma, Oklahoma
State, lowa State, and Michi
gan State.
For national honor hopefuls
Borchers and Crenshaw, the
tourney will be a proving ground
to see how fast the inroads are
proceeding.
