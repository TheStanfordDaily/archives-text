# Mission Improbableâ€”Tribe Takes On UCLA, Trojans
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford's basketball squad
takes a two game win streak
to Los Angeles this weekend,
where the Indians have the un
enviable task of trying to upset
the two top teams in the Pa
cific 8, UCLA and USC.
UCLA, 11-0 in conference com
petition and 22-1 overall, hosts
Stanford tonight at 8 in Pauley
Pavilion. The rugged Trojans,
10-1 in league action, entertain
the Indians Saturday at the
same time.
Ace forward Art Harris
needs only 43 points In the
two games to break Stanford's
single-season scoring record
of 520 set by Tom Dose In
1962-1963. Harris, who has
scored over 20 points In the
Indians' last seven contests, Is
certain to shatter Dose's rec
ord next weekend against Cal
If he should fall short this
week in Los Angeles.
Harris, having scored 1265
points in his three-year varsity
career, also figures to etch his
name into the record books as

the third leading scorer in Stan
ford history. He now trails the
legendary Hank Luisetti by only
26 points, and should have no
trouble bypassing Luisetti in
the Tribe's remaining four
games.
The defending NCAA cham
pion Bruins have not had
quite as great a year as every
one anticipated before the sea
son. Besides a 71-69 loss to
Houston in the Astrodome,
Lew Alcindor and company
have come uncomfortably
close to being upset by Pur
due (73-71) and Oregon State
(55-52).
Big Lew has been doing his
part, averaging 24.6 points and
16.3 rebounds per game, and
hitting 65% of his shots in Pa
cific-8 action. But the loss of
Edgar Lacey and occasional cold
spells by the rest of the UCLAns
have slightly dimmed the luster
of the much-publicized Bruin
quintet.
USC's Trojans, behind the
sparkling all-around play of
6-7 Bill Hewitt, have won 12

of their last 13 games and
compiled a 17-6 overall mark.
Two months ago they devas
tated Stanford 90-64 In the
Pavilion, with forwards Hew
itt and Bill Marsh doing most
of the damage.
Hewitt is scoring at a 20.5
clip in loop competition, while
hauling down 12.5 rebounds per
game. He combines with 7-1
center Ron Taylor and 6-7 Marsh
to give the Trojans a formidable
front line. Taylor sat out USC's
76-68 win over Washington Mon
day with a bruised hip, but will
be ready to go Saturday night.
