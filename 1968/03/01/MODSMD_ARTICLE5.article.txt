## S.F. Teachers OK Strike 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—The
American Federation of Teach
ers Local 61, AFL-CIO, voted
Thursday to strike the San
iFrancisco public schools sys
tem to back up its demands for
improvements.
The union represents about 1,-
400 of the city's 4,000 teachers.
It was reported the vote was
552-295 in favor of a strike.
Picket lines were expected to
go up early Friday.
The Federation represents
most of the high school and
junior high school teachers. The
rival San Francisco Classroom
Teachers Association has about
2,600 members and dominates
grammar school representation.
A spokesman for the school
administration said it would
follow instructions from the
Board of Education to try to
keep schools open "so children
who want an education can con
tinue to get it."
He said the regular substitute
teacher list has been contacted
and schools will be operated as
close to normal as possible.
Parents received letters
Thursday advising them there
might be a minimum day Fri
day. The school spokesman said
this would mean that, where
necessary, students would be
sent home around the noon hour.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres
ident Johnson bade "goodbye and

farewell' to Robert Strange
McNamara Thursday. It was a
day when the retiring defense
chief's superefficient military
machine seemed to sputter in
disarray.
On an occasion set aside for
honoring McNamara upon his
departure as secretary of de
fense after seven years:
—The President and Mc-
Namara were trapped for a
frustrating 12 minutes in a Pen
tagon elevator just as they pre
pared to go outside for a full
military honors ceremony. The
elevator was no. 13 and was car
rying 13 persons.
—Johnson's words of praise
"Bob McNamara's carrer is
just about the textbook example
of the modern public servant"
went virtually unheard when
the public address system
failed.
—A chilling rain forced can
cellation of a scheduled fly-by of
Air Force planes including three
Fill fighter versions of the old
TFX warplane that brought
McNamara so much controver
sy.
• Jet* Hit Hanoi
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. jets at
tacked targets in the Hanoi area
Thursday for the second
straight day.
In South Vietnam, Communist
gunners shot down a $2.5-million
Cl3O Hercules transport and

three helicopters, including a
big Marine CH46 Sea Knight
with 19 Leathernecks aboard.
All 19 were reported killed when
the chopper crashed 11 miles
northeast of the beleaguered
Marine base at Khe Sanh.
From Khe Sanh, Associated
Press photographer Eddie Ad
ams reported napalm drops
Thursday on North Vietnamese
trenches as close as 100 yards
from the camp's barbed wire
perimeter.
Air Force fighter-bombers hit
at North Vietnam's nerve center
in radar-guided raids through
monsoon clouds while other
planes, 300 miles to the south,
worked over the menacing con
centration of Nor.th Vietnamese
regulars around Khe Sanh with
napalm and explosives in bright
sunlight.
• British Immigration
LONDON (AP) — A last-ditch
attempt to kill legislation stem
ming the flood of Asian immi
grants from East Africa failed
early Friday after a rare all
night sitting of the House of
Lords.
The vote cleared another ma
jor hurdle in the Labor govern
ment's rush to get the new law
in operation by midnight Fri
day.
After nearly 12 hours of de
bate, Britain's peers of the
realm voted down an amend
ment aimed at rejecting the

controversial commonwealth im
migrants bill outright.
The amendment, sponsored
by left-wing Lord Brockway,
was defeated 109 to 85. The
peers then gave the bill an un
opposed second reading. It still
has further stages to go before
being returned to a special ses
sion of the House of Commons.
