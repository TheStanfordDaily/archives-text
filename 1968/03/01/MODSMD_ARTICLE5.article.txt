WASHINGTON (AP) — Pres
ident Johnson bade "goodbye and

farewell' to Robert Strange
McNamara Thursday. It was a
day when the retiring defense
chief's superefficient military
machine seemed to sputter in
disarray.
On an occasion set aside for
honoring McNamara upon his
departure as secretary of de
fense after seven years:
—The President and Mc-
Namara were trapped for a
frustrating 12 minutes in a Pen
tagon elevator just as they pre
pared to go outside for a full
military honors ceremony. The
elevator was no. 13 and was car
rying 13 persons.
—Johnson's words of praise
"Bob McNamara's carrer is
just about the textbook example
of the modern public servant"
went virtually unheard when
the public address system
failed.
—A chilling rain forced can
cellation of a scheduled fly-by of
Air Force planes including three
Fill fighter versions of the old
TFX warplane that brought
McNamara so much controver
sy.
• Jet* Hit Hanoi
SAIGON (AP) — U.S. jets at
tacked targets in the Hanoi area
Thursday for the second
straight day.
In South Vietnam, Communist
gunners shot down a $2.5-million
Cl3O Hercules transport and

three helicopters, including a
big Marine CH46 Sea Knight
with 19 Leathernecks aboard.
All 19 were reported killed when

Marine base at Khe Sanh.
From Khe Sanh, Associated

regulars around Khe Sanh with
napalm and explosives in bright

• Romania vs. USSR
BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)
— Romania walked out on a
meeting of 66 Communist par
ties Thursday and tore a gaping
new breach in the world Com
munist facade.
In head-on collision with the
Soviet Union, the Romanian
delegation stalked out after oth
er parties refused to satisfy its
demands to stop attacking Red
China, Romanian sources re
ported.
Romania charged Stalinist
tactics were being used at the
Budapest meeting at which the
Soviet Union has campaigned
for a world Communist confer
ence next autumn.
The Romanians argued that a
world meeting under present
conditions of division over the
Soviet-Chinese dispute would
"only flagrantly illustrate on a
world scale the lack of unity be
tween Communist parties."
The walkout was preceded by
Romanian demands for a joint
apology for a Syrian Communist
charge that Romania was pro-
Israel and a promise for an end
to criticism of Red China.
• Teachers Strike
Increasingly vocal teachers'
unions waged, settled or threat
ened strikes in four states
Thursday.
The militant teacher groups—
recalling the wave of strikes
which swept a score of school
systems around the country last
fall and kept almost a million
pupils at home—pushed their
disputes in:
Pittsburgh—Some 1,000 of the
city's 3,000 public school teach
ers walked out Thursday, forc
ing school authorities to close
some schools because of unruly
pupils.
Florida—A third of the state's
60,000 teachers continued their
nine-day strike as Republican
Gov. Claude R. Kirk Jr. said ho
would allow tax and spending
legislation they oppose to be
come law to spite them.
Oklahoma—The state's 27,000
public schoolteachers scheduled
a one-day "professional holiday"

for next week to enforce their
demands for an improved school
program.
Albuquerque, N. M. — The
city's 2,900 teachers returned to
classrooms after a week-long
walkout to demand more state
money for schools.
• Record Casualties
SAIGON (AP) — While the
enemy has been hit hard, more
American servicemen have been
killed in action in Vietnam in
the last four weeks than during
all the first five years of U.S.
involvement in the war.
Cumulative figures disclosed
by the U.S. Command Tuesday
showed 1,829 Americans killed
from Jan. 28 to Feb. 24, a period
of hard fighting marked by at
tack and counterattack during
the Communists' lunar new
year offensive.
The death role from 1961
through 1965 was 1,636.
• War Wilts Stocks
NEW YORK (AP) — Uncer
tainty about Vietnam and the
effect of the war on the economy
enshrouded Wall Street with a
fog of uncertainty Thursday and
the stock market fell again.
There was no great rush to
sell but considerable reluctance
to buy, so volume dipped to 7.71
million shares from 8.03 million
Wednesday.
The Dow Jones industrial av
erage dropped 4.22 to 840.50 and
seemed headed once more for a
test of the interim low of 831.77
from which it rebounded after
Feb. 13.
Stock prices declined from the
start and widened losses as the
day wore on. As usual, the most
impressive recent gainers
among glamor stocks in the con
glomerate and computer fields
were the worst losers.

BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP)

In head-on collision with the
