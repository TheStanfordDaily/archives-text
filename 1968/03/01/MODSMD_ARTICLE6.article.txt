# SES Asks Liberalization Of PhD Study Programs
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The Study of Education at
Stanford steering committee be
lieves graduate Ph.D. programs
should be "freed of the arbi
trary constraints of specified,
required courses."
In a memorandum to depart
ments and schools, SES chair
man Herbert Packer set forth
this week the committee's "ten
tative views" on graduate edu
cation.
"The graduate course struc
ture should be entirely free
of the restrictions of the quar
terly calendar, units, and the
usual examination-term paper

schedule," the committee sug
gests. "Courses should be of
fered to help students acquire
what they need, and not serve
as successive hurdles down
the path to a graduate de
gree."
SES asked faculty to respond
by March 15 to these sugges
tions and a list of questions on
graduate study. SES's final pro
posals will be included in its
1969 report on all aspects of
Stanford education.
The steering committee ad
mits in the memorandum that
"there is extreme variation
among departments as to the
nature and degree of problems"
with graduate study. Its sug
gestions are "most relevant" to
social sciences and humanities,
the committee says.
Suggestions are also made to
end the exclusion of Stanford
undergraduates from graduate
study in some departments, par
ticularly those in the natural
sciences.
The major problems of grad
uate study are "the role of prep
aration for careers in teaching"
and the "structure of graduate

requirements," SES says. The
committee criticizes the empha
sis on research over teaching
in graduate work, pointing out
that "a majority of students in
the humanities and social sci
ences will find careers in col
lege and university faculties."
"Some work In teaching
normally should be recom
mended for all graduate stu
dents," SES says. "AH or
nearly all graduate students
should have some experience
in supervised teaching, not
just as employment but as an
integral part of the graduate
program."
In previous discussions the
steering committee considered a
new teaching degree such as
Yale's "Master of Philosophy,"
equivalent to a Ph.D. without a
dissertation. Prof. Mark Mancall
suggested the M.Phil, would en
courage graduate students who
are more interested in teaching
than research.
But the committee "rejected
the notion of recommending the
general adoption of such a de
gree at Stanford," according to
the memorandum, because "the

Ph.D. is so entrenched in the
American system that any such
alternate will be looked upon as
a second-class degree."
"Instead, the PhD. degree it
self might be modified both in
terms of University specifica
tions and departmental pro
grams so as to alow greater
variation .... The dissertation
could take a number of forms,
some closely tied to research,
others more allied to prepara
tion for teaching."
In urging a drastic loosening
of Ph.D. course requirements,
the committee says "many of
our Ph.D. programs are too rigid
in their structure, and require
an unreasonable amount of for
mal course work. Such require
ments seem out of harmony
with the intended scholarly na
ture of graduate work."
SES believes "graduate stu
dents should be given the op
tion of acting on their own
responsibility In acquiring the
capacities and knowledge re
quisite to their professional
careers."
The committee admits "very
solid alternatives" will be needed
as substitutes for conventional
course and unit requirements.
"A close and continuing tutorial
arrangement between each stu
dent and one or more faculty
members" is recommended.
"The responsibility for monit
oring progress of the graduate
student would thus bo shifted
from the Registrar to the de
partment faculty," SES believes.
Another recommended change
is the elimination of the nine
quarter residence requirement
for the Ph.D. Letter grades
should be abandoned in favor
of "comprehensive examinations
and faculty evaluations," SES
suggests.
The committee also criticized
departments which prohibit or
discourage Stanford undergrad
uates from enrolling in their
graduate programs. Currently
biology, chemistry, philosophy

and psychology almost never
accept their own undergraduates
for graduate study, and history,
physics, statistics, and political
science encourage them to go
elsewhere.
"This policy stands in the
way of . . . diminution of the
presently existing barrier be
tween undergraduate and
graduate work," SES main
tains.
"We would propose that de
partments which do not usually
admit Stanford undergraduates
as regular graduate students
permit the admission of highly
qualified Stanford undergradu
ates for work through the mas
ter's degree or its equivalent."
The committee suggests de
partments should recruit appli
cants for graduate study to im
prove the "quality of graduate
students" and better inform stu
dents of "what their chosen de
partment has to offer."

self might be modified both in
terms of University specifica
tions and departmental pro
grams so as to alow greater
variation .... The dissertation
could take a number of forms,
some closely tied to research,
others more allied to prepara
tion for teaching."
In urging a drastic loosening
of Ph.D. course requirements,
the committee says "many of
our Ph.D. programs are too rigid
in their structure, and require
an unreasonable amount of for
mal course work. Such require
ments seem out of harmony
with the intended scholarly na
ture of graduate work."
SES believes "graduate stu
dents should be given the op
tion of acting on their own
responsibility In acquiring the
capacities and knowledge re
quisite to their professional
careers."
The committee admits "very
solid alternatives" will be needed
as substitutes for conventional
course and unit requirements.
"A close and continuing tutorial
arrangement between each stu
dent and one or more faculty
members" is recommended.
"The responsibility for monit
oring progress of the graduate
student would thus bo shifted
from the Registrar to the de
partment faculty," SES believes.
Another recommended change
is the elimination of the nine
quarter residence requirement
for the Ph.D. Letter grades
should be abandoned in favor
of "comprehensive examinations
and faculty evaluations," SES
suggests.
The committee also criticized
departments which prohibit or
discourage Stanford undergrad
uates from enrolling in their
graduate programs. Currently
biology, chemistry, philosophy

and psychology almost never
accept their own undergraduates
for graduate study, and history,
physics, statistics, and political
science encourage them to go
elsewhere.
"This policy stands in the
way of . . . diminution of the
presently existing barrier be
tween undergraduate and
graduate work," SES main
tains.
"We would propose that de
partments which do not usually
admit Stanford undergraduates
as regular graduate students
permit the admission of highly
qualified Stanford undergradu
ates for work through the mas
ter's degree or its equivalent."
The committee suggests de
partments should recruit appli
cants for graduate study to im
prove the "quality of graduate
students" and better inform stu
dents of "what their chosen de
partment has to offer."
The Study of Education at
Stanford steering committee be
lieves graduate Ph.D. programs
should be "freed of the arbi
trary constraints of specified,
required courses."
In a memorandum to depart
ments and schools, SES chair
man Herbert Packer set forth
this week the committee's "ten
tative views" on graduate edu
cation.
"The graduate course struc
ture should be entirely free
of the restrictions of the quar
terly calendar, units, and the
usual examination-term paper

schedule," the committee sug
gests. "Courses should be of
fered to help students acquire
what they need, and not serve
as successive hurdles down
the path to a graduate de
gree."
SES asked faculty to respond
by March 15 to these sugges
tions and a list of questions on
graduate study. SES's final pro
posals will be included in its
1969 report on all aspects of
Stanford education.
The steering committee ad
mits in the memorandum that
"there is extreme variation
among departments as to the
nature and degree of problems"
with graduate study. Its sug
gestions are "most relevant" to
social sciences and humanities,
the committee says.
Suggestions are also made to
end the exclusion of Stanford
undergraduates from graduate
study in some departments, par
ticularly those in the natural
sciences.
The major problems of grad
uate study are "the role of prep
aration for careers in teaching"
and the "structure of graduate

requirements," SES says. The
committee criticizes the empha
sis on research over teaching
in graduate work, pointing out
that "a majority of students in
the humanities and social sci
ences will find careers in col
lege and university faculties."
"Some work In teaching
normally should be recom
mended for all graduate stu
dents," SES says. "AH or
nearly all graduate students
should have some experience
in supervised teaching, not
just as employment but as an
integral part of the graduate
program."
In previous discussions the
steering committee considered a
new teaching degree such as
Yale's "Master of Philosophy,"
equivalent to a Ph.D. without a
dissertation. Prof. Mark Mancall
suggested the M.Phil, would en
courage graduate students who
are more interested in teaching
than research.
But the committee "rejected
the notion of recommending the
general adoption of such a de
gree at Stanford," according to
the memorandum, because "the

Ph.D. is so entrenched in the
American system that any such
alternate will be looked upon as
a second-class degree."

of the restrictions of the quar
terly calendar, units, and the
usual examination-term paper

schedule," the committee sug
gests. "Courses should be of
fered to help students acquire
what they need, and not serve
as successive hurdles down
the path to a graduate de
gree."
SES asked faculty to respond
by March 15 to these sugges
tions and a list of questions on
graduate study. SES's final pro
posals will be included in its
1969 report on all aspects of
Stanford education.
The steering committee ad
mits in the memorandum that
"there is extreme variation
among departments as to the
nature and degree of problems"
with graduate study. Its sug
gestions are "most relevant" to
social sciences and humanities,
the committee says.
Suggestions are also made to
end the exclusion of Stanford
undergraduates from graduate
study in some departments, par
ticularly those in the natural
sciences.
The major problems of grad
uate study are "the role of prep
aration for careers in teaching"
and the "structure of graduate

requirements," SES says. The
committee criticizes the empha
sis on research over teaching
in graduate work, pointing out
that "a majority of students in
the humanities and social sci
ences will find careers in col
lege and university faculties."
"Some work In teaching
normally should be recom
mended for all graduate stu
dents," SES says. "AH or
nearly all graduate students
should have some experience
in supervised teaching, not
just as employment but as an
integral part of the graduate
program."
In previous discussions the
steering committee considered a
new teaching degree such as
Yale's "Master of Philosophy,"
equivalent to a Ph.D. without a
dissertation. Prof. Mark Mancall
suggested the M.Phil, would en
courage graduate students who
are more interested in teaching
than research.
But the committee "rejected
the notion of recommending the
general adoption of such a de
gree at Stanford," according to
the memorandum, because "the

Ph.D. is so entrenched in the
American system that any such
alternate will be looked upon as
a second-class degree."
"Instead, the PhD. degree it
self might be modified both in
terms of University specifica
tions and departmental pro
grams so as to alow greater
variation .... The dissertation
could take a number of forms,
some closely tied to research,
others more allied to prepara
tion for teaching."
In urging a drastic loosening
of Ph.D. course requirements,
the committee says "many of
our Ph.D. programs are too rigid
in their structure, and require
an unreasonable amount of for
mal course work. Such require
ments seem out of harmony
with the intended scholarly na
ture of graduate work."
SES believes "graduate stu
dents should be given the op
tion of acting on their own
responsibility In acquiring the
capacities and knowledge re
quisite to their professional
careers."
The committee admits "very
solid alternatives" will be needed
as substitutes for conventional
course and unit requirements.
"A close and continuing tutorial
arrangement between each stu
dent and one or more faculty
members" is recommended.
"The responsibility for monit
oring progress of the graduate
student would thus bo shifted
from the Registrar to the de
partment faculty," SES believes.
Another recommended change
is the elimination of the nine
quarter residence requirement
for the Ph.D. Letter grades
should be abandoned in favor
of "comprehensive examinations
and faculty evaluations," SES
suggests.
The committee also criticized
departments which prohibit or
discourage Stanford undergrad
uates from enrolling in their
graduate programs. Currently
biology, chemistry, philosophy

and psychology almost never
accept their own undergraduates
for graduate study, and history,
physics, statistics, and political
science encourage them to go
elsewhere.
"This policy stands in the
way of . . . diminution of the
presently existing barrier be
tween undergraduate and
graduate work," SES main
tains.
"We would propose that de
partments which do not usually
admit Stanford undergraduates
as regular graduate students
permit the admission of highly
qualified Stanford undergradu
ates for work through the mas
ter's degree or its equivalent."
The committee suggests de
partments should recruit appli
cants for graduate study to im
prove the "quality of graduate
students" and better inform stu
dents of "what their chosen de
partment has to offer."
The Study of Education at
Stanford steering committee be
lieves graduate Ph.D. programs
should be "freed of the arbi
trary constraints of specified,
required courses."
In a memorandum to depart
ments and schools, SES chair
man Herbert Packer set forth
this week the committee's "ten
tative views" on graduate edu
cation.
"The graduate course struc
ture should be entirely free
of the restrictions of the quar
terly calendar, units, and the
usual examination-term paper

schedule," the committee sug
gests. "Courses should be of
fered to help students acquire
