# Civil Disorders Commission: Riots Due To 'White Racism'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — A
presidential commission said
Thursday that "White racism is
essentially responsible for the
explosive mixture which has
been accumulating in our cities
since the end of World War II."
The bipartisan National Com
mission on Civil Disorders, after
eight months' intensive study of
the 1967 big-city riots, reported
that bias and segregation

"threaten the future of every
American."
Reporting on its analysis of
the riots that brought looting,
shooting and arson to American
cities last year, the commission
headed by Gov. Otto Kerner of
Illinois said racism and riots
will split the nation into "two
societies, one black, one white—
separate and unequal" — un
less massive and costly reme
dies are begun at once.

"The urban disorders of the
summer of 1967 were not caused
by, nor were they the conse
quence of, any organized plan
or 'conspiracy', " the commis
sion said.
It notified President Johnson
that new taxes must be levied if
necessary to "meet unprece
dented levels of funding" for
slum housing, education, job
training, and welfare.
The commission did not put a
price tag on its sweeping pro
posals, but their magnitude
<made it clear that the cost
would at least approach the $2
billion a month level of the Viet
nam war.

Three of the "bitter fruits" of
white racism, the report said,
are: First, that great numbers
of Negroes have been excluded
from the benefits of economic
progress which they see depict
ed daily on television and in
newspapers; second, black im
migration and white exodus
have produced massive concen
trations of impoverished Ne
groes in central cities; and third,
segregration and poverty bear
down on youths, "to destroy op
portunity and enforce failure."
The report continued: "Crime,
drug addiction, dependency on
welfare, and bitterness and re
sentment against society in gen
eral and white society in par
ticular are the result."
It pictured the typical rioter
as a young Negro male, a high
school dropout but somewhat
better educated than his non
rioting Negro neighbor, and
usually unemployed or under
employed—that is, working less
than full-time or at a menial,
low-paid job.
Most rioters arrested were be
tween 15 and 24. This, inciden
tally, is an age bracket of high
est unemployment among Ne
groes.
