# Summer Festival To Feature APA
## 
### 
APA, Broadway's hit reper
tory theater company, will be
the dramatic highlight of the
Stanford Summer Festival of
the Arts' "Fifth Anniversarjy
Season," Festival Director Virgil
K. Whitaker announced Thurs
day. It will be APA's first North
ern California appearance.
APA, the Association of Pro
ducing Artists, will present at
least three plays from its rep
ertory July 9 to 28, the heart
of the seven-week 1968 festival.
Rated tops by critics, the
company has staged 37 differ
ent plays since it was founded
in 1960 by Ellis Rabb, award
winning actor and director
who is its president and artis
tic director. Helen Hayes, inter
nationally distinguished Amer
ican actrees, Eva LeGallienne,
veteran Broadway actress and
director, and founding mem
bers Richard Easton and Rose
mary Harris have figured
prominently in APA's growth.
The 1968 Stanford Summer
Festival will include professional
drama, film, music, dance and
art events. The annual festival

—one of the nation's major sum
mer cultural attractions — also
supplements and enlivens sum
mer programs in the Univer
sity's liberal arts departments.
Special lectures, public audience
briefings with the performers
or specialists on the campus dur
ing the festival, and student per
formances are other facets.
Whitaker said contracts are
being completed and it is expect
ed that the entire program will
be announced by April 15.
The Festival's "Fifth Anniver
sary Season" will have no um
brella-like programming theme
such as those that have char
acterized past seasons, for ex
ample 1964's Shakespeare Festi
val or 1965's Mozart Era. "In
stead," Whitaker remarked, "we
have kept our eyes on the twin
goals of high artist quality and
introducing important produc
ing organizations to the Bay
Area. These have always been
uppermost in our minds."
"This experiment certainly
doesn't mean that we have aban
doned the theme idea; we're
simply anxious to try some'
thing new, and what better time
than our fifth anniversary,"
Whitaker said.
APA has been a smash hit at
the Huntington Hartford The
ater in Hollywood the past two
summers and has spent six sea
sons as resident theater com
pany at the University of Mich
igan, Ann Arbor. It has also
been a featured presentation of

Toronto's Royal Alexandria The
atre for the past two seasons.
Continuing to demonstrate its
impressive abilities the company
has been called, "The finest rep
ertory company in America,"
(New Yorker); "Exhilarating ...
mature theater ... a joy," (Taub
man, New York Times).
APA was the sole American
theatrical company invited to
play at Expo 67 in Montreal,
wher° it presented "You Can't

Take It With You" and "Right
You Are." Both plays have been
APA successes on Broadway.
Other outstanding APA pro
ductions in recent years are
"War and Peace" from the 1960
season, "The Show-Off," "Pan
tagleize," and lonesco's "Exit the
King" this season.
The APA Company, which
is presented by APA-Phoenix,
makes Its Broadway home at
the Lyceum Theater where it
will open Its fourth production
of the current season In mid-
March. Eva Le Gallienne will
direct, and Uta Hagen will be
featured in Chekhov's "The
Cherry Orchard."
More than 60 persons com
prise the acting company and
staff. Over 500 persons have been
associated with it since 1960.
The Stanford Summer Festi
val was generated in 1964 by an
anonymous $100,000 gift. Since
then it has been supported by
further gifts, university funds
and proceeds. All programs are
open to the public and about half
are offered free of charge.
