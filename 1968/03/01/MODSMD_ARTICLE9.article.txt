# Vote Continues In VP Runoff
## 
### 
Today, not yesterday (as re
ported in The Daily yesterday)
is the last day of voting in the
runoff election for ASSU vice
president. The polls will be open
from 8:30 to 3:30 p.m. in two lo
cations on White Plaza.
The two candidates are seniors
Denis Hayes and Roy Weather
up.
Hayes is running on a plat
form of reforming the ASSU
constitution, and promises to
take his program to the constitu
tional convention in April.
Weatherup, who has aimed his
campaign ire at what he calls
"irresponsible activists," prom
ises to fullfill only the "limited
responsibilities" of the vice pres
idential office.
Voting had originally been
scheduled to open Wednesday,
but it was postponed a day be
cause one-day's prior notice had
not been given in The Daily.
ASSU by-laws require such
prior notice, unless waived by
the legislature but when it was
decided to have the election Wed
nesday, Tuesday's Daily had al
ready gone to press.
If a special session of the legi
slature is not called next week,
the new vice president will not
take office until spring quarter.
