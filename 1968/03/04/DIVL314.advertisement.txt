the one
in thirty who
will qualify for
our executive
development program?
Last year we interviewed thirty college graduates to find one who
qualified for our Executive Development Program.
Whether you're in literal arts or accounting, in retailing, engineering
or business administration — no matter what your field of study — you
may be one of those Sears is looking for. Sears is a great many
people, with a great variety of backgrounds, doing a great variety of
jobs, in the dynamic merchandising field.
• You are not limited to remaining in the line of work you have
prepared for in school — unless, of course, you want to — because
• the emphasis in Sears is placed on developing many talents —
talents you perhaps never suspected you had.
A SEARS representative will be on campus March 8
to conduct personal interviews.
Please make necessary arrangements through the Placement Office.
