"It sounds like fun but
I just don't have time to
work on the Daily."
Nonsense. Here's a sample schedule:
Monday—Work on the night desk 7 to 10 p.m.
Wednesday—Research a story, 3 to 5 p.m. Write story, 7 to 9 p.m.
That leaves a lot of time. And you pick your own hours.
Join the Daily staff spring quarter. Stop by the office any day this week if you have ques
tions. A meeting is planned Friday, March 8 at 5 p.m.
