The Suffering of Messiah
One of the most amazing portions of the Old Testament, the Fifty-third
chapter of the prophet Isaiah, records in great detail the suffering servant
of Jehovah, the Messiah of Israel and the Savior of the world. Misunder
stood and misinterpreted by many, the passage finds clear and minutely
accurate fulfillment in the sufferings, death and subsequent resurrection of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth who came almost seven hundred years after Isaiah
described Messiah s role and purpose in world affairs. But rather than taking
our word for it, here is that passage for you to examine, meditate upon and
think about on your own:
Behold my servant (Messiah) shall prosper, he shall be exalted and lifted
up, he shall be very high. As many were astonished at him—his appearance
was so marred, beyond human semblance, and his form beyond that of the
sons of men—so shall he startle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths
because of him; for that which has not been told them they shall see, and
that which they have not heard they shall understand. Who has believed
what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
For he (Messiah) grew up before him (Jehovah) like a young plant, and
like a root out of dry ground (barren, fruitless Israel); he had no form or
comeliness that we should look at him an,d no beauty that we should desire
him. He was despised and rejected by men; a man of sorrows and acquainted
with grief; and as one from who men hide their faces he was despised, and
we esteemed him not".
"Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; yet we esteemed
him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted But he was wounded for our trans
gressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement
that made us whole, and with his stripes we are healed All we like sheep
have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way and the Lord has
laid on him the iniquity of us all."
"He was oppressed, and he was afflicted ,yet he opened not his mouth; like
a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is
dumb, so he opened not his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken
away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of
the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of my people (Israel)?
And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death,
although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth."
' Yet it was the will of the Lord to bruise him, he (Jehovah) has put him to
grief; when he makes himself an offering for sin, he shall see his offspring,
he shall prolong his days,- the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand; he
shall see the fruit of the travail of his soul and be satisfied; by his knowledge
shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous;
and he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I (Jehovah) will divide him a por
tion with th? great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he
poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors yet
he bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors
