# Frosh Hit Old Draw Priority
## 
### NICHOLAS SELBY 
The Dean of Student's office
last Tuesday night ran into what
may be its most difficult prob
lem in rearranging the Univer
sity's housing next year.
The issue is priorities, or
which student will get the right
to retain or gain living space on
campus.
Wilbur representatives at a
meeting of 40 house presidents
angrily contested the existing
priorities for the housing draw.
The Freshmen say these priori
ties are outmoded.
The Freshmen claim that
the existing priorities discrim
inate against freshmen in fa
vor of upperciassmen, and
have suggested that perhaps
next year's seniors be given a
lower priority than next year's
sophomores and juniors.
Before coeducational demon
stration houses began this year,
the Undergraduate Housing Of
fice had managed to find housing
space for sophomores who al
ways wanted it. This year, how
ever, some sophomores had to
live in Durand Houses and a few
were forced off campus.
Now it appears, according to
administration predictions, that
the same situation could occur
again. And under the existing
priorities, freshmen would be
most disadvantaged in trying to
get space on campus.
At present, entering freshmen
receive first priority, and anoth
er group, described below, re
ceives second priority:
"Present residents of univer
sity housing who wish to contin
ue, 'living on-campus' including
those students returning direct
ly from Overseas Campuses, but
excluding, at the start of Au
tumn Quarter, those men who
were freshmen and lived in des
ignated freshmen residences dur

ing the preceding academic
year."
The priority means that fresh
men males in these residences—
Branner Hall and the six Wilbur
freshman houses — would have
to draw a high number to be
assured of space on caApus.
They presently have fifth priori,
ty behind returning and transfer
women.
Madera representative John
Shoch explained that the priori
ty system also gives some fresh
men higher priority over others.
"A freshman in Soto or Otero
or Stern is not excluded from
second priority because these
residences are not designated
solely for freshmen," Shoch
said.
Shoch recommends that the
freshmen males be given at
least equal priority among
themselves and the upperclass
men. And he adds that If any
one has to leave the residence
system, it should be next
year's seniors.
Other suggestions from Wil
bur representatives included
abandonment of priorities in fa
vor of a random draw. There is
no agreement, however, on giv
ing seniors a lesser priority.
Junipero representative Jim
Shrimer pointed out that seniors
have usually spent many hours
improving their residence and
might deserve to stay there.
The priority problem will re
turn to the housing meeting to
morrow evening as a major top
ic. Assistant Dean Sally Ma
honey says the Dean's office is
aware of the needs of next year's
sophomores, but points out that
the priority issue is tied to the
residence configuration.
"Our problem is to decide
exactly what issue we're talking
about, and then decide who can
take final action on the issue,"
Miss Mahoney says.


"CAN WE BELIEVE WASHINGTON?" — Otis Chandler, publisher
of the Los Angeles Times, will discuss the Administration's cre
dibility tonight at 8 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium. Besides deliver
ing the 1968 Distinguished Alumnus Lectures, Chandler will attend

Chandler, formerly a Stanford trustee, has been publisher of the
Times since 1960.

"CAN WE BELIEVE WASHINGTON?" — Otis Chandler, publisher
of the Los Angeles Times, will discuss the Administration's cre
dibility tonight at 8 p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium. Besides deliver
ing the 1968 Distinguished Alumnus Lectures, Chandler will attend
meetings of the Professional Journalism Advisory Board here.
Chandler, formerly a Stanford trustee, has been publisher of the
Times since 1960.
The Dean of Student's office
last Tuesday night ran into what
may be its most difficult prob
lem in rearranging the Univer
sity's housing next year.
The issue is priorities, or
which student will get the right
to retain or gain living space on
campus.
Wilbur representatives at a
meeting of 40 house presidents
angrily contested the existing
priorities for the housing draw.
The Freshmen say these priori
ties are outmoded.
The Freshmen claim that
the existing priorities discrim
inate against freshmen in fa
vor of upperciassmen, and
have suggested that perhaps
next year's seniors be given a
lower priority than next year's
sophomores and juniors.
Before coeducational demon
stration houses began this year,
the Undergraduate Housing Of
fice had managed to find housing
space for sophomores who al
ways wanted it. This year, how
ever, some sophomores had to
live in Durand Houses and a few
were forced off campus.
Now it appears, according to
administration predictions, that
the same situation could occur
again. And under the existing
priorities, freshmen would be
most disadvantaged in trying to
get space on campus.
At present, entering freshmen
receive first priority, and anoth
er group, described below, re
ceives second priority:
"Present residents of univer
sity housing who wish to contin
ue, 'living on-campus' including
those students returning direct
ly from Overseas Campuses, but
excluding, at the start of Au
tumn Quarter, those men who
were freshmen and lived in des
ignated freshmen residences dur

ing the preceding academic
year."
The priority means that fresh
men males in these residences—
Branner Hall and the six Wilbur
freshman houses — would have
to draw a high number to be
assured of space on caApus.
They presently have fifth priori,
ty behind returning and transfer
women.
Madera representative John
Shoch explained that the priori
ty system also gives some fresh
men higher priority over others.
"A freshman in Soto or Otero
or Stern is not excluded from
second priority because these
residences are not designated
solely for freshmen," Shoch
said.
Shoch recommends that the
freshmen males be given at
least equal priority among
themselves and the upperclass
men. And he adds that If any
one has to leave the residence
system, it should be next
year's seniors.
Other suggestions from Wil
bur representatives included
abandonment of priorities in fa
vor of a random draw. There is
no agreement, however, on giv
ing seniors a lesser priority.
Junipero representative Jim
Shrimer pointed out that seniors
have usually spent many hours
improving their residence and
might deserve to stay there.
The priority problem will re
turn to the housing meeting to
morrow evening as a major top
ic. Assistant Dean Sally Ma
honey says the Dean's office is
aware of the needs of next year's
sophomores, but points out that
the priority issue is tied to the
residence configuration.
"Our problem is to decide
exactly what issue we're talking
about, and then decide who can
take final action on the issue,"
Miss Mahoney says.
