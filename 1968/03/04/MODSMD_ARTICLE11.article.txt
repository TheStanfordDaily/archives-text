## Maturity Of Sponsor Conduct Marred By 'Gimmicks, Roles' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I am responding to Tuesday's
editorial, "Sponsor Reform for
Frosh Dorms."
I have not been close enough
to the freshman dorm situation
in recent years to take a definite
stand, but I am impressed by
the editorial board's observa
tions and recommendations and
feel they warrant serious anc
thoughtful consideration.
Over the years I have beer
impressed by the maturity and
good sense with which most
sponsors have conducted their
roles. But I have also been dis
tressed by the almost impossible
ambiguity of their roles.
In addition to being an inter
preter of the Stanford culture, I
agree with The Daily that im
plicitly we have also expected
the sponsor "to play the impos
sible role of psychiatrist, draft
counselor, match maker, and
academic advisor." I think we
ask too much; personally I
know few clinical psychologists
who would willingly buy this
role.
The Daily's suggestion of four
upperclassmen placed in each
corridor by draw, supplemented
administratively or academically
by an RA or a Tutor, could have
real merit. The freshman uses
the upperclassman as he needs
to use him, and the upperclass
man exerts his influence by what
he is as a more mature person.
I applaud the salutory notion
of an upperclassman "just liv
ing with the freshmen" —with
no artifacts, no gimmicks, no de
fined roles!

Sponsors Offer Frosh
An Experienced Friend
Editor, The Daily:
I must admit I reacted strong
ly to the editorial, "Sponsor Re
form for Frosh Dorms." The ar
ticle represents a bird's eye view
of sponsoring that I fear many
upperclassmen hold.
It is, of course, difficult for
any student living in an upper
class dorm to fully understand
or remember the interrelation
between sponsors and freshmen
and the specific interaction that
goes on 24 hours a day. What
a senior may have experienced
in his/her sponsor 4 years ago
may not be valid to project onto
the Freshman-Sponsor relation
ship today.
Perhaps at one time, the spon
sor system was a self-perpetu
ating homogeneous group that
represented a specific orienta
tion towards fraternities, aca
demia, and activism. I question
just how homogeneous such a
group ever is, but whatever it
has been, it does not seem to be
precisely so black and white
and easy to label today.
The sponsor group is chang
ing a lot each year, and a more
careful study of these groups
I'm sure would support that and
be useful for the editorial
board. The sponsor "rush" sys
tem is not the determined Phoe
nix you make it into.
Old forms do not die easily
and it is unfortunate that we
are not yet at the point of total
integration in all campus resi

dences. Until that time comes,
however, sponsors can and do
play a positive role in a fresh
man dorm. . . .
Contrary to "The Hurlbut Pa
per on Freshman Men," I feel
the sponsor's role is not one of
providing a figure to emulate
nor an agent of respect to be
admired from afar. Nor is it
one of providing any specific
guidelines for the "unformed
Freshman mind," as the edito
rial board suggests.
It is instead the inglorious but
real role of a friend who has a
little more experience at living
—experience that may or may
not be useful . . .
The "much maligned ding ses
sion" of sponsor "rush" just is
not the case and the "excruci
ating personal interview" which
lasted 20 minutes, was informal
and enjoyable, and involved a
small group of interested and
friendly people who asked rele
vant and important questions ...

Organ Recital Review
Gave Wrong Judgment
Editor, The Daily:
In regards to the organ re
cital review of February 16th
. . . several comments need to
be made. The headline "D'Hooge
superb" is simply not true. D'-
Hooge was not superb by any
standard, either in his internal
conception of the pieces he
chose to play, nor in his exter r
nal performance of them.
This, apparently is D'Hooge's
approach to music, and unfor
tunate that this is, it is even
more unfortunate on the organ
in Dinkelspiel auditorium. This
organ, fine that it is, is placed
in a room with next to no rever
beration, thus giving the sound
a more dry and crisp quality
that it ideally should have. In
stead of compensating for this
situation in his playing, D'Hooge
aggravated it. . . .
The review shows a basic mis
understanding of the relation
ship between music and the in
strument on which it is per
formed. Music does not serve as
a vehicle through which the in
strument is exploited for its own
sake. The music itself is more
important than the sounds which
are produced by the medium of
performance.
It is tr.ue that music does not
exist until it sounds, and that
a certain kind of sound is more
appropriate for a certain piece
than some other kind of sound
might be, but yet those sounds
do not take on meaning until
the performer can identify with
the composition in question and
share in the composer's experi
ence and attempt to involve his
listeners in that experience
The reviewers should also have
read the background of the com
position and the comments as
to whether, the work is to be

regarded as a mass or catechism,
or whether it combines elements
of both. It is important also to
know position of the work in re
lation to the other three parts
of the Klavieriibung, and the re
lation of the entire Klavierii
bung to Bach's other composi
tions, especially those for the
organ. . . .
I hope that future recitals
will be reviewed with more care
and that reviewers will ac
quaint themselves with the back
ground to the music and with the
music itself before passing judg
ment on it. Catharine Crozier's
recital is April 2nd, and hope
fully the Daily will print her
program at least a week before
that date to enable those inter
ested to acquaint themselves
with the music.

i\on-Drama Majors
Were In Greasepaint
Editor, The Daily:
We are not entirely sure of
tne point of Mr. Cannon's recent
letter. However, if, as Mr. Can
non points out, there were so
many Speech & Drama and SRT
personnel in "The Roar of the
Greasepaint; the Smell of the
Crowd," it would seem to indi
cate an obvious void in the cur
riculum of the department.
Mr. Cannon lists the members
of the cast and crews who are
directly involved with the Speech
& Drama department, but he
fails to note that these people
would not be involved in a Ram's
Head show if the department
offered them a comparable pro
gram.
To mention a few on the
production end of "The Roar of
the Greasepaint; the Smell of the
Crowd," who are not in the
Speech and Drama department,
we can include the producer Lisa
Gonzalez, history major, the
technical director Karl Burton,
creative writing, the costume ex
ecutrix, Sally Shatford, English,
the property master Stephen Un
gar, electrical engineering, the
electrician Robert Stone, jour
nalism, and the crews whose ma
jors include Japanese, computer
science and engineering mech
anics, as well as a university
staff member, two alumni of
Ram's Head and several fresh
man who have not yet declared
majors.
This indicates the importance
of Ram's Head for those non-
Speech & Drama majors who are
interested in theatre, giving
them practical experience. It
should also be pointed out that
these people have often been
hired by SRT when they lacked
the requisite technical help.
Ram's Head, then, offers
Speech & Drama people an ad
ditional opportunity for acting,
directing and designing, which
the department seems unable to
provide, and offers non-Speech &
Drama people the opportunity to
pursue their avocation, which
would most certainly not exist
if Ram's Head were part of the
department.

It is tr.ue that music does not
exist until it sounds, and that
a certain kind of sound is more
appropriate for a certain piece
than some other kind of sound
might be, but yet those sounds
do not take on meaning until
the performer can identify with
the composition in question and
share in the composer's experi
ence and attempt to involve his
listeners in that experience
The reviewers should also have
read the background of the com
position and the comments as
to whether, the work is to be

regarded as a mass or catechism,
or whether it combines elements
of both. It is important also to
know position of the work in re
lation to the other three parts
of the Klavieriibung, and the re
lation of the entire Klavierii
bung to Bach's other composi
tions, especially those for the
organ. . . .
I hope that future recitals
will be reviewed with more care
and that reviewers will ac
quaint themselves with the back
ground to the music and with the
music itself before passing judg
ment on it. Catharine Crozier's
recital is April 2nd, and hope
fully the Daily will print her
program at least a week before
that date to enable those inter

Were In Greasepaint
Editor, The Daily:
We are not entirely sure of
tne point of Mr. Cannon's recent
letter. However, if, as Mr. Can
non points out, there were so
many Speech & Drama and SRT
personnel in "The Roar of the
Greasepaint; the Smell of the
Crowd," it would seem to indi
cate an obvious void in the cur
riculum of the department.
Mr. Cannon lists the members
of the cast and crews who are
directly involved with the Speech
& Drama department, but he
fails to note that these people
would not be involved in a Ram's
Head show if the department
offered them a comparable pro
gram.
To mention a few on the
production end of "The Roar of
the Greasepaint; the Smell of the
Crowd," who are not in the
Speech and Drama department,
we can include the producer Lisa
Gonzalez, history major, the
technical director Karl Burton,
creative writing, the costume ex
ecutrix, Sally Shatford, English,
the property master Stephen Un
gar, electrical engineering, the
electrician Robert Stone, jour
nalism, and the crews whose ma
jors include Japanese, computer
science and engineering mech
anics, as well as a university
staff member, two alumni of
Ram's Head and several fresh
man who have not yet declared
majors.
This indicates the importance
of Ram's Head for those non-
Speech & Drama majors who are
interested in theatre, giving
them practical experience. It
should also be pointed out that
these people have often been
hired by SRT when they lacked
the requisite technical help.
Ram's Head, then, offers
Speech & Drama people an ad
ditional opportunity for acting,
directing and designing, which
the department seems unable to
provide, and offers non-Speech &
Drama people the opportunity to
pursue their avocation, which
would most certainly not exist
if Ram's Head were part of the
department.

I am responding to Tuesday's
editorial, "Sponsor Reform for
Frosh Dorms."
I have not been close enough
to the freshman dorm situation
in recent years to take a definite
stand, but I am impressed by
the editorial board's observa
tions and recommendations and
feel they warrant serious anc
thoughtful consideration.
Over the years I have beer
impressed by the maturity and
good sense with which most
sponsors have conducted their
roles. But I have also been dis
tressed by the almost impossible
ambiguity of their roles.
In addition to being an inter
preter of the Stanford culture, I
agree with The Daily that im
plicitly we have also expected
the sponsor "to play the impos
sible role of psychiatrist, draft
counselor, match maker, and
academic advisor." I think we
ask too much; personally I
know few clinical psychologists
who would willingly buy this
role.
The Daily's suggestion of four
upperclassmen placed in each
corridor by draw, supplemented
administratively or academically
by an RA or a Tutor, could have
real merit. The freshman uses
the upperclassman as he needs
to use him, and the upperclass
man exerts his influence by what
he is as a more mature person.
I applaud the salutory notion
of an upperclassman "just liv
ing with the freshmen" —with
no artifacts, no gimmicks, no de
fined roles!

Sponsors Offer Frosh
An Experienced Friend
Editor, The Daily:
I must admit I reacted strong
ly to the editorial, "Sponsor Re
form for Frosh Dorms." The ar
ticle represents a bird's eye view
of sponsoring that I fear many
upperclassmen hold.
It is, of course, difficult for
any student living in an upper
class dorm to fully understand
or remember the interrelation
between sponsors and freshmen
and the specific interaction that
goes on 24 hours a day. What
a senior may have experienced
in his/her sponsor 4 years ago
may not be valid to project onto
the Freshman-Sponsor relation
ship today.
Perhaps at one time, the spon
sor system was a self-perpetu
ating homogeneous group that
represented a specific orienta
tion towards fraternities, aca
demia, and activism. I question
just how homogeneous such a
group ever is, but whatever it
has been, it does not seem to be
precisely so black and white
and easy to label today.
The sponsor group is chang
ing a lot each year, and a more
careful study of these groups
I'm sure would support that and
be useful for the editorial
board. The sponsor "rush" sys
tem is not the determined Phoe
nix you make it into.
Old forms do not die easily
and it is unfortunate that we
are not yet at the point of total
integration in all campus resi

dences. Until that time comes,
however, sponsors can and do
play a positive role in a fresh
man dorm. . . .
Contrary to "The Hurlbut Pa
per on Freshman Men," I feel
the sponsor's role is not one of
providing a figure to emulate
nor an agent of respect to be
admired from afar. Nor is it
one of providing any specific
guidelines for the "unformed
Freshman mind," as the edito
rial board suggests.
It is instead the inglorious but
real role of a friend who has a
little more experience at living
—experience that may or may
not be useful . . .
The "much maligned ding ses
sion" of sponsor "rush" just is
not the case and the "excruci
ating personal interview" which
lasted 20 minutes, was informal
and enjoyable, and involved a
small group of interested and
friendly people who asked rele
vant and important questions ...

Organ Recital Review
Gave Wrong Judgment
Editor, The Daily:
In regards to the organ re
cital review of February 16th
. . . several comments need to
be made. The headline "D'Hooge
superb" is simply not true. D'-
Hooge was not superb by any
standard, either in his internal
conception of the pieces he
chose to play, nor in his exter r
nal performance of them.
This, apparently is D'Hooge's
approach to music, and unfor
tunate that this is, it is even
more unfortunate on the organ
in Dinkelspiel auditorium. This
organ, fine that it is, is placed
in a room with next to no rever
beration, thus giving the sound
a more dry and crisp quality
that it ideally should have. In
stead of compensating for this
situation in his playing, D'Hooge
aggravated it. . . .
The review shows a basic mis
understanding of the relation
ship between music and the in
strument on which it is per
formed. Music does not serve as
a vehicle through which the in
strument is exploited for its own
sake. The music itself is more
important than the sounds which
are produced by the medium of
performance.
It is tr.ue that music does not
exist until it sounds, and that
a certain kind of sound is more
appropriate for a certain piece
than some other kind of sound
might be, but yet those sounds
do not take on meaning until
the performer can identify with
the composition in question and
share in the composer's experi
ence and attempt to involve his
listeners in that experience
The reviewers should also have
read the background of the com
position and the comments as
to whether, the work is to be

regarded as a mass or catechism,
or whether it combines elements
of both. It is important also to
know position of the work in re
lation to the other three parts
of the Klavieriibung, and the re
lation of the entire Klavierii
bung to Bach's other composi
tions, especially those for the
organ. . . .
I hope that future recitals
will be reviewed with more care
and that reviewers will ac
quaint themselves with the back
ground to the music and with the

may not be valid to project onto
the Freshman-Sponsor relation
ship today.
Perhaps at one time, the spon
sor system was a self-perpetu
ating homogeneous group that
represented a specific orienta
tion towards fraternities, aca
demia, and activism. I question
just how homogeneous such a
group ever is, but whatever it
has been, it does not seem to be
precisely so black and white
and easy to label today.
The sponsor group is chang
ing a lot each year, and a more
careful study of these groups
I'm sure would support that and
be useful for the editorial
board. The sponsor "rush" sys
tem is not the determined Phoe
nix you make it into.
Old forms do not die easily
and it is unfortunate that we
are not yet at the point of total
integration in all campus resi

dences. Until that time comes,
however, sponsors can and do
play a positive role in a fresh
man dorm. . . .
Contrary to "The Hurlbut Pa
per on Freshman Men," I feel
the sponsor's role is not one of
providing a figure to emulate
nor an agent of respect to be
admired from afar. Nor is it
one of providing any specific
guidelines for the "unformed
Freshman mind," as the edito
rial board suggests.
It is instead the inglorious but
real role of a friend who has a
little more experience at living
—experience that may or may
not be useful . . .
The "much maligned ding ses
sion" of sponsor "rush" just is
not the case and the "excruci
ating personal interview" which
lasted 20 minutes, was informal
and enjoyable, and involved a
small group of interested and
friendly people who asked rele
vant and important questions ...

Organ Recital Review
Gave Wrong Judgment
Editor, The Daily:
In regards to the organ re
cital review of February 16th
. . . several comments need to
be made. The headline "D'Hooge
superb" is simply not true. D'-
Hooge was not superb by any
standard, either in his internal
conception of the pieces he
chose to play, nor in his exter r
nal performance of them.
This, apparently is D'Hooge's
approach to music, and unfor
tunate that this is, it is even
more unfortunate on the organ
in Dinkelspiel auditorium. This
organ, fine that it is, is placed
in a room with next to no rever
beration, thus giving the sound
a more dry and crisp quality
that it ideally should have. In
stead of compensating for this
situation in his playing, D'Hooge
aggravated it. . . .
The review shows a basic mis
understanding of the relation
ship between music and the in
strument on which it is per
formed. Music does not serve as
a vehicle through which the in
strument is exploited for its own
sake. The music itself is more
important than the sounds which
are produced by the medium of
performance.
It is tr.ue that music does not
exist until it sounds, and that
a certain kind of sound is more
appropriate for a certain piece
than some other kind of sound
might be, but yet those sounds
do not take on meaning until
the performer can identify with
the composition in question and
share in the composer's experi
ence and attempt to involve his
listeners in that experience
The reviewers should also have
read the background of the com
position and the comments as
to whether, the work is to be

regarded as a mass or catechism,
or whether it combines elements
of both. It is important also to
know position of the work in re
lation to the other three parts
of the Klavieriibung, and the re
lation of the entire Klavierii
bung to Bach's other composi
tions, especially those for the
organ. . . .
I hope that future recitals
will be reviewed with more care
and that reviewers will ac
quaint themselves with the back
ground to the music and with the
music itself before passing judg
ment on it. Catharine Crozier's
recital is April 2nd, and hope
fully the Daily will print her
program at least a week before
that date to enable those inter
ested to acquaint themselves
with the music.

Editor, The Daily:
We are not entirely sure of
tne point of Mr. Cannon's recent
letter. However, if, as Mr. Can
non points out, there were so
many Speech & Drama and SRT
personnel in "The Roar of the
Greasepaint; the Smell of the
Crowd," it would seem to indi
cate an obvious void in the cur
riculum of the department.
Mr. Cannon lists the members
of the cast and crews who are
directly involved with the Speech
& Drama department, but he
fails to note that these people
would not be involved in a Ram's
Head show if the department
offered them a comparable pro
gram.
To mention a few on the
production end of "The Roar of
the Greasepaint; the Smell of the
Crowd," who are not in the
Speech and Drama department,
we can include the producer Lisa
Gonzalez, history major, the
technical director Karl Burton,
creative writing, the costume ex
ecutrix, Sally Shatford, English,
the property master Stephen Un
gar, electrical engineering, the
electrician Robert Stone, jour
nalism, and the crews whose ma
jors include Japanese, computer
science and engineering mech
anics, as well as a university
staff member, two alumni of
Ram's Head and several fresh
man who have not yet declared
majors.
This indicates the importance
of Ram's Head for those non-
Speech & Drama majors who are
interested in theatre, giving
them practical experience. It
should also be pointed out that
these people have often been
hired by SRT when they lacked
the requisite technical help.
Ram's Head, then, offers
Speech & Drama people an ad
ditional opportunity for acting,
directing and designing, which
the department seems unable to
provide, and offers non-Speech &
Drama people the opportunity to
pursue their avocation, which
would most certainly not exist
if Ram's Head were part of the
department.

Editor, The Daily:
I am responding to Tuesday's
editorial, "Sponsor Reform for
Frosh Dorms."
I have not been close enough
to the freshman dorm situation
in recent years to take a definite
stand, but I am impressed by
the editorial board's observa
tions and recommendations and
feel they warrant serious anc
thoughtful consideration.
Over the years I have beer
impressed by the maturity and
good sense with which most
sponsors have conducted their
roles. But I have also been dis
tressed by the almost impossible
ambiguity of their roles.
In addition to being an inter
preter of the Stanford culture, I
agree with The Daily that im
plicitly we have also expected
the sponsor "to play the impos
sible role of psychiatrist, draft
counselor, match maker, and
academic advisor." I think we
ask too much; personally I
know few clinical psychologists
who would willingly buy this
role.
The Daily's suggestion of four
upperclassmen placed in each
corridor by draw, supplemented
administratively or academically
by an RA or a Tutor, could have
real merit. The freshman uses
the upperclassman as he needs
to use him, and the upperclass
man exerts his influence by what
he is as a more mature person.
I applaud the salutory notion
of an upperclassman "just liv
ing with the freshmen" —with
no artifacts, no gimmicks, no de
fined roles!

Sponsors Offer Frosh
An Experienced Friend
Editor, The Daily:
I must admit I reacted strong
ly to the editorial, "Sponsor Re

ticle represents a bird's eye view
of sponsoring that I fear many
upperclassmen hold.
It is, of course, difficult for
any student living in an upper
class dorm to fully understand
or remember the interrelation
between sponsors and freshmen
and the specific interaction that
goes on 24 hours a day. What
a senior may have experienced
in his/her sponsor 4 years ago
may not be valid to project onto
the Freshman-Sponsor relation
ship today.
Perhaps at one time, the spon

we can include the producer Lisa

creative writing, the costume ex

the property master Stephen Un

This indicates the importance
of Ram's Head for those non-
Speech & Drama majors who are
interested in theatre, giving
them practical experience. It
should also be pointed out that
these people have often been
hired by SRT when they lacked
the requisite technical help.
Ram's Head, then, offers
Speech & Drama people an ad

directing and designing, which
the department seems unable to
provide, and offers non-Speech &

pursue their avocation, which
would most certainly not exist
if Ram's Head were part of the
department.

Editor, The Daily:
I am responding to Tuesday's
editorial, "Sponsor Reform for
Frosh Dorms."
I have not been close enough
to the freshman dorm situation
in recent years to take a definite
stand, but I am impressed by
the editorial board's observa
tions and recommendations and
feel they warrant serious anc
thoughtful consideration.
Over the years I have beer
impressed by the maturity and
good sense with which most
sponsors have conducted their
roles. But I have also been dis
tressed by the almost impossible
ambiguity of their roles.
In addition to being an inter
preter of the Stanford culture, I
agree with The Daily that im
plicitly we have also expected
the sponsor "to play the impos
sible role of psychiatrist, draft
counselor, match maker, and
academic advisor." I think we
ask too much; personally I
know few clinical psychologists
who would willingly buy this
role.
The Daily's suggestion of four
upperclassmen placed in each
corridor by draw, supplemented
administratively or academically
by an RA or a Tutor, could have
real merit. The freshman uses
the upperclassman as he needs
to use him, and the upperclass
man exerts his influence by what
he is as a more mature person.
I applaud the salutory notion
of an upperclassman "just liv
ing with the freshmen" —with
no artifacts, no gimmicks, no de
fined roles!

Sponsors Offer Frosh
An Experienced Friend
Editor, The Daily:
I must admit I reacted strong
ly to the editorial, "Sponsor Re
form for Frosh Dorms." The ar
ticle represents a bird's eye view
of sponsoring that I fear many
upperclassmen hold.
It is, of course, difficult for
any student living in an upper
class dorm to fully understand
or remember the interrelation
between sponsors and freshmen
and the specific interaction that
goes on 24 hours a day. What
a senior may have experienced
in his/her sponsor 4 years ago
may not be valid to project onto
the Freshman-Sponsor relation
ship today.
Perhaps at one time, the spon
sor system was a self-perpetu
ating homogeneous group that
represented a specific orienta
tion towards fraternities, aca
demia, and activism. I question
just how homogeneous such a
group ever is, but whatever it
has been, it does not seem to be
precisely so black and white
and easy to label today.
The sponsor group is chang
ing a lot each year, and a more
careful study of these groups
I'm sure would support that and
be useful for the editorial
board. The sponsor "rush" sys
tem is not the determined Phoe
nix you make it into.
Old forms do not die easily
and it is unfortunate that we
are not yet at the point of total
integration in all campus resi

dences. Until that time comes,
however, sponsors can and do
play a positive role in a fresh
man dorm. . . .
Contrary to "The Hurlbut Pa
per on Freshman Men," I feel
the sponsor's role is not one of
providing a figure to emulate
nor an agent of respect to be
admired from afar. Nor is it
one of providing any specific
guidelines for the "unformed
Freshman mind," as the edito
rial board suggests.
It is instead the inglorious but
real role of a friend who has a
little more experience at living
—experience that may or may
not be useful . . .
The "much maligned ding ses
sion" of sponsor "rush" just is
not the case and the "excruci
ating personal interview" which
lasted 20 minutes, was informal
and enjoyable, and involved a
small group of interested and
friendly people who asked rele
vant and important questions ...

Organ Recital Review
Gave Wrong Judgment
Editor, The Daily:
In regards to the organ re
cital review of February 16th
. . . several comments need to
be made. The headline "D'Hooge
superb" is simply not true. D'-
Hooge was not superb by any
standard, either in his internal
conception of the pieces he
chose to play, nor in his exter r
nal performance of them.
This, apparently is D'Hooge's
approach to music, and unfor
tunate that this is, it is even
more unfortunate on the organ
in Dinkelspiel auditorium. This
organ, fine that it is, is placed
in a room with next to no rever
beration, thus giving the sound
a more dry and crisp quality
that it ideally should have. In
stead of compensating for this
situation in his playing, D'Hooge
aggravated it. . . .
The review shows a basic mis
understanding of the relation
ship between music and the in
strument on which it is per
formed. Music does not serve as
a vehicle through which the in
strument is exploited for its own
sake. The music itself is more
important than the sounds which
are produced by the medium of
performance.
It is tr.ue that music does not
exist until it sounds, and that
a certain kind of sound is more
appropriate for a certain piece
than some other kind of sound
might be, but yet those sounds
do not take on meaning until
the performer can identify with
the composition in question and
share in the composer's experi
ence and attempt to involve his
listeners in that experience
The reviewers should also have
read the background of the com
position and the comments as
to whether, the work is to be

regarded as a mass or catechism,
or whether it combines elements
of both. It is important also to
know position of the work in re
lation to the other three parts
of the Klavieriibung, and the re
lation of the entire Klavierii
bung to Bach's other composi
tions, especially those for the
organ. . . .
I hope that future recitals
will be reviewed with more care
and that reviewers will ac
quaint themselves with the back
ground to the music and with the
music itself before passing judg
ment on it. Catharine Crozier's
recital is April 2nd, and hope
fully the Daily will print her
program at least a week before
that date to enable those inter
ested to acquaint themselves
with the music.

We are not entirely sure of
tne point of Mr. Cannon's recent
letter. However, if, as Mr. Can
non points out, there were so
many Speech & Drama and SRT
personnel in "The Roar of the
Greasepaint; the Smell of the
Crowd," it would seem to indi
cate an obvious void in the cur
riculum of the department.
Mr. Cannon lists the members
of the cast and crews who are
directly involved with the Speech
& Drama department, but he
fails to note that these people
would not be involved in a Ram's
Head show if the department
offered them a comparable pro
gram.
To mention a few on the
production end of "The Roar of
the Greasepaint; the Smell of the
Crowd," who are not in the
Speech and Drama department,
we can include the producer Lisa
Gonzalez, history major, the
technical director Karl Burton,
creative writing, the costume ex
ecutrix, Sally Shatford, English,
the property master Stephen Un
gar, electrical engineering, the
electrician Robert Stone, jour
nalism, and the crews whose ma
jors include Japanese, computer
science and engineering mech
anics, as well as a university
staff member, two alumni of

Organ Recital Review
Gave Wrong Judgment
Editor, The Daily:
In regards to the organ re
cital review of February 16th
. . . several comments need to
be made. The headline "D'Hooge
superb" is simply not true. D'-
Hooge was not superb by any
standard, either in his internal
conception of the pieces he
chose to play, nor in his exter r
nal performance of them.
This, apparently is D'Hooge's
approach to music, and unfor
tunate that this is, it is even
more unfortunate on the organ
in Dinkelspiel auditorium. This
organ, fine that it is, is placed
in a room with next to no rever
beration, thus giving the sound
a more dry and crisp quality
that it ideally should have. In
stead of compensating for this
situation in his playing, D'Hooge
aggravated it. . . .
The review shows a basic mis
understanding of the relation
ship between music and the in
strument on which it is per
formed. Music does not serve as
a vehicle through which the in
strument is exploited for its own
sake. The music itself is more
important than the sounds which
are produced by the medium of
performance.
It is tr.ue that music does not
exist until it sounds, and that
a certain kind of sound is more
appropriate for a certain piece
than some other kind of sound
might be, but yet those sounds
do not take on meaning until
the performer can identify with
the composition in question and
share in the composer's experi
ence and attempt to involve his
listeners in that experience
The reviewers should also have
read the background of the com
position and the comments as
to whether, the work is to be

regarded as a mass or catechism,
or whether it combines elements
of both. It is important also to
know position of the work in re
lation to the other three parts
of the Klavieriibung, and the re
lation of the entire Klavierii
bung to Bach's other composi
tions, especially those for the
organ. . . .
I hope that future recitals
will be reviewed with more care
and that reviewers will ac
quaint themselves with the back
ground to the music and with the
music itself before passing judg
ment on it. Catharine Crozier's
recital is April 2nd, and hope
fully the Daily will print her
program at least a week before
that date to enable those inter
ested to acquaint themselves
with the music.

i\on-Drama Majors
Were In Greasepaint
Editor, The Daily:
We are not entirely sure of
tne point of Mr. Cannon's recent
letter. However, if, as Mr. Can
non points out, there were so
many Speech & Drama and SRT
personnel in "The Roar of the
Greasepaint; the Smell of the
Crowd," it would seem to indi
cate an obvious void in the cur
riculum of the department.
Mr. Cannon lists the members
of the cast and crews who are
directly involved with the Speech
& Drama department, but he
fails to note that these people
would not be involved in a Ram's
Head show if the department
offered them a comparable pro
gram.
To mention a few on the
production end of "The Roar of
the Greasepaint; the Smell of the
Crowd," who are not in the
Speech and Drama department,
we can include the producer Lisa
Gonzalez, history major, the
technical director Karl Burton,
creative writing, the costume ex
ecutrix, Sally Shatford, English,
the property master Stephen Un
gar, electrical engineering, the
electrician Robert Stone, jour
nalism, and the crews whose ma
jors include Japanese, computer
science and engineering mech
anics, as well as a university
staff member, two alumni of
Ram's Head and several fresh
man who have not yet declared
majors.
This indicates the importance
of Ram's Head for those non-
Speech & Drama majors who are
interested in theatre, giving
them practical experience. It
should also be pointed out that
these people have often been
hired by SRT when they lacked
the requisite technical help.
Ram's Head, then, offers
Speech & Drama people an ad
ditional opportunity for acting,
directing and designing, which
the department seems unable to
provide, and offers non-Speech &
Drama people the opportunity to
pursue their avocation, which
would most certainly not exist
if Ram's Head were part of the
department.
