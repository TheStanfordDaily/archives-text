# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Navy Prejudice 
### Drew Pearson 
How biased is the U.S. Navy
in its attitude toward religious
and racial minorities?
This question has been raised
as a result of the treatment of
Lt. Com. Marcus A. Arnheiter,
who has been denied a court re
view after being relieved of his
command, and a recent memo
instructing naval officers par
ticipating in the New Orleans
Mardi Gras to keep Mardi Gras
invitations out of the hands
of Negroes, Jews and Italians.
The memo regarding Mardi
Gras, first published by Robert
Walters, ace reporter of the
Washington Star, was signed by
Lt. Com. James B. Eller, aide
to Rear Admiral Clyde an Ars
dall Jr., commander-in-chief of
the Atlantic cruiser-destroyer
force, and pertained to the
assignment of five naval vessels
to New Orleans during Mardi
Gras week.
"Whether or not this
with your personal or official
approval, it is the way things
are and we have to go along
with it," read the memo, in ex
explaining that invitations to
private Mardi Gras parties must
not be traded among personnel
because they might get into the
hands of Negroes, Jews, or Ital
ians.
Navy Denies Charge
Rear Admiral Pierre N. Char
bonnet, commander of the
Eight Naval District at New
Orleans, has vigorously denied
having anything to do with this
memo or with naval discrimina
tion.
The case of Lt. Com. Arn
heiter also has overtones of anti-
Semitism. Arnheiter is undiplo
matic and difficult to get along
with. However, this is no reason
for refusing him a hearing, and
for punishing the one high-rank
ing officer, Capt. Richard G.
Alexander, who had the courage
to stand up for him.
The Mardi Gras memo writ
ten by Lt. Com. Eller has all the
earmarks of naval politics and
naval prejudice. Among other
things it states: "Congressman
Hebert (close friend of CNO
and Congressman Rivers) is the
major backer of navy involve
ment."
Reading between the lines,
this means that Rep. Eddie He
bert of New Orleans, No. 2 on
the House Armed Services Com
mittee, is a man the Chief of
Naval Operations, Admiral
Thomas Moorer, has to get
along with.
The reference to Chairman

Rivers of the Armed Services
Committee is also significant of
the Navy's desire to do any
thing to please him, from dry
ing him out at Bethesda Naval
Hospital after his binges, to sup
plying special planes for his
trips. Rivers, in turn, went to
bat for the Navy on atomic
carriers and other appropriation
whether the former civilian
chief of the Navy, Secretary Mc-
Namara, wanted them or not.
It was Rivers and Hebert who
contributed materially to put
ting the skids under McNamara
as Secretary of Defense.
The commander of the Eighth
Naval District happens to be
Admiral Charbonnet whom I
helped get into Annapolis. He is
an honest, courageous, slightly
stuffy member of the Navy's
top brass.
The members of Navy crews
in the Atlantic want to go to
New Orleans for Mardi Gras.
They have a wonderful time.
"The parades and festivities are
public and the greatest free
show on earth," says Admiral
Charbonnet. "All creeds and

races contribute and participate.
'There are over 80 private
clubs (called krewes) and each
puts on a ball. Invitations are
personal," Admiral Charbonnet
explained, referring to the in
vitations which were to be kept
from Jews, Italians and Negroes.
"Normally our sailors are not
invited to participate or view the
private balls; so several krewes
have historically volunteered to
re-do their balls aboard a visit
ing ship for the benefit of the
sailors."
Regarding special helicopters,
Admiral Charbonnet said these
trips were given to New Orleans
officials in return for their
courtesies. The steel band, he
said, "will suitably advertise the
Navy." Cigarette lighters and
tie clasps are the gifts of indiv
ual officers, not the Navy, and
don't come out of the taxpayers'
funds.
"It has been my obligation
here, as at sea, to protect our
Navy against the insidious na
ture and presence of segrega
tion," says Admiral Charbonnet.
