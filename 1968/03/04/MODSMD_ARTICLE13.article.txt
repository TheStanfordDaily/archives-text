# McCarthy Supporters Plan Primary 'Partition' Parties
## 
### 
Several local meetings will be
a part of over 500 statewide
"petition parties" tomorrow
night that will collect signatures
for Minnesota Sen. Eugene Mc-
Carthy's nominating petition.
The drive, organized by the
California Democratic Council
(CDC), is planned in order to
place McCarthy's slate at the top
of the California Democratic
presidential primary ballot.
The McCarthy delegation in
the June 4 primary will op
pose a pro-Johnson slate head
ed by Atty. Gen. Thomas C.
Lyneh and composed mainly
of Democratic party "regu
lars."
The first slate that qualifies
with the required number of
signatures of registered Demo
crats will automatically be given
top spot on the primary ballot.
The first position is considered
an advantage in a close race.
At exactly 8:00 p.m. Wednes
day an estimated 25-50,000 will
be turned in at county court
houses, giving McCarthy the top
position on the ballot and na

tionwide publicity on the eve of
the New Hampshire primary.
Two parties are being organ
ized by Stanford groups, or.e
at the Poppycock at University
and High in Palo Alto, and the
other at the Stanford Recrea
tion Center at Bowdoin and Pine
Hill on the campus.
The Poppycock party will be
gin at 9 p.m., with music and
dancing until 2 a.m. All Mc-
Carthy supporters are welcome
at the Poppycock, whether or
not they are eligible to vote. The
Stanford Committee for Mc-
Carthy is organizing the party.
A group from Stanford will
host the party at the Recrea
tion Center, the swimming and
tennis club. The party will
start at 10 p.m. and end at 1
a.m. Organizers plan refresh
ments and music. All Santa
Clara County residents may
attend.
Those who will co-host the
party include Professors R. Mc-
Afee Brown, David Hogness,
Hadley Kirkman, George Lep
pert, Hubert Marshall, Paul Wal

lin, Charles Yanofsky, and oth
ers.
Those who do not wish to at
tend a party may sign the peti
tion at the Law Lounge on Quad
after midnight, Wednesday mor
ning.
Registrars will be present at
all parties. Anyone who has regi
stered Democratic by midnight
may sign the petition afterward.
Petitions cannot be signed until
12:01 a.m. Wednesday morning.
McCarthy needs about 14,000
signatures to place him on the
ballot. There are at least 35,000
members in CDC.
