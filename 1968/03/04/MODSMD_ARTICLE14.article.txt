# Fifth Club To Change
## El Tigre Open For Coeds 
### 
El Tigre eating club last week
bocame the fifth of the seven
eating clubs to admit females as
full members.
The club voted to accept wom
en who choose to list El Tigre
as their preference for this
Spring's residence draw.
Women members will be per
mitted to live in Toyon Hall,
Hoskins House, or off campus.
Places for fifty-one women are
being reserved in Toyon under
the dean of students preliminary
housing plans currently being
discussed.
Two votes over the required
two-thirds of the club approved
the coed measure. A similar pro

posal was introduced last quar
ter, but failed by one vote.
El Tigre's decision to accept
females as members leaves El
Cuadro and El Toro as the only
all-male clubs. All three still
have selective rush systems for
their male members, while the
other four work under the draw
system for both men and wom
en.
"The campus-wide trend Is
toward coed living as the best
residential alternative," said El
Tigre sophomore Neil Golden.
"If we didn't go along with the
trend now, by the time we did it
might be too late."
Several members of the club,
however, see the action as indi
cative of the future general
weakening of the eating clubs.
"The clubs seem to have an in
eluctable desire to destroy them
selves," claimed senior JefT Robi
son.

"This is going to hurt our
rush, not help it," said another
member.
In addition, several members
were uneasy over a dean of stu
dents' ruling that all coed living
units must abandon selective
male rush within one year. El
Tigre plans a reevaluation next
year of its decision to go cocd
in light of this ruling.
It currently appears that few
of the members would favor an
end to selective rush, although
most agree with one member's
remark, "Let's see how things
go for the next year."
