# Peace March Protests War
## 
### 
A March for Peace will be
held the week of Stanford's
Spring break (the week of
March 23-30). Starting in Palo
Alto, it will proceed through
Menlo Park, Redwood City, Bur
lingame, San Mateo, San Carols,
South San Francisco, and on
into San Francisco.
The reason for the march is
to bring the opposition of war
to those communities which are
not directly exposed to it by the
larger demonstrations in San
Francisco or Oakland. Main
emphasis will be given to the
Vietnamese war, but war in
other third world areas will also
be included.
The marchers will be holding
demonstrations and discussions
in the local communities. They
hope that housing will be sup
plied by members of the com
munity who are sympathetic.
Mark Silverman is organizing
the march. Activities such as
night (town hall) meetings, and
rallies near high schools and
junior colleges have been dis
cussed.
