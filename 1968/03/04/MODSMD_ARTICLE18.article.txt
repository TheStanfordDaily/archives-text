# Despite Coed Housing Plans
## Fraternities Say Rush Going Well 
### JOHN ALCORN 
As 1968 rush approaches the
halfway point, opinions on how
the fraternities are faring and
how freshmen are reacting vary.
Commenting on the amount of
interest shown by freshmen in
his fraternity, Theta Chi rush
chairman Phil Babel said, "We
are going down in the same pro
portion as the other fraternities.
But," he emphasized, "we're not
panicking."
Babel said, "I wish the fresh
men would get out, look around,
and make up their own minds"
concerning fraternities.
Zeta Psi's rush chairman,
Greg Cramblit, noted that there
was a better turnout last year,
and said that this was due in
part to the demonstration
houses.
He also added that "a false
stereotype has been placed on
our house," and reiterated
Babel's appeal that freshmen
should judge fraternities on
their own.
Other fraternities, however,
contend that rush has not drop
ped off substantially, or even

that it has picked up. Bob Smith,
rush chairman at Delta Upsilon,
remarked, "Although we've only
had one open house, more than
100 people came, and it was
very successful."
Smith also held that while
"competition with coed dorms
and the demonstration houses
makes freshmen more critical
of fraternities, I don't think it
will substantially cut down the
number of people who rush."
Rush is also "going fairly
well" at Kappa Sigma, although
rush chairman Lew Black indi
cated that the number of people
rushing so far is less than last
year at this time.
Black expressed surprise that
men from Durand have been
looking into Kappa Sigma. He
surmised that "they are disap
pointed and don't feel their ex
periment was successful."
Durand President Ed Davis
disagreed strongly. "The 33 men
at Durand almost unanimously
consider this year to be an ex
tremely enjoyable and reward
ing one. Many of us, though,
don't want to limit ourselves to

a small group of men for three
of our four years at Stanford,"
he explained.
"With few exceptions, those
who don't return next fall will
leave not from disappointment
with this year but because they
seek a variety of experiences."
Davis added that only six of
the original Durand men have
attended any rush functions, and
that fraternities are not the first
choice of all of the six. "Most
Durand men are more inter
ested in coed dorms than in fra
ternities," he stated.
Black also noted that many
people from Branner have vis
ited his house because they "ap
parently thought coed housing
was fine for freshman year but
didn't want to continue it."
Branner freshman Glenn Ford
has a similar opinion. He ex
plained that "coed living in
Branner was great for my fresh
man year, but most guys are
thinking about fraternities."
Another Brannerite looking
into fraternities is Denny Cue,
who commented that "rush isn't
as high pressured as I thought

it would be. I also thought fra
ternities would try to put up a
false image."
"As relaxed as possible" is
how Bob Edie has tried to make
rush at Alpha Tau Omicron. He
also remarked, "I'm very
pleased that the rush program
is going well this year." He said
almost 90 people visited his
house on the second night of
rush.
Stern Hall freshman Mike
Sawadzki was very enthusiastic
about one fraternity in particu
lar, but commented, "The thing
that strikes me most is the frats
are full of lonely peopleâ€”people
who don't want to be intro
verted."
When asked if Delta Chi was
having any trouble attracting
freshmen, rush chairman Bob
Hunter replied, "It doesn't seem
so now, although we might
later. So far plenty of people
have come, and they seem to
like both the house and the guys
in it."
Hunter did admit that the

number of inquisitive freshmen
is slightly less than last year's
total at this time.
In contrast to most fraterni
ties, Alpha Delta Phi's"turnout
so far has been quite good, and
above last year," according to
Davis Hawkins, rush chairman.
Hawkins also was surprised
at the number of Brannerites
who "seem to be quite inter
ested" in fraternities.
Steve Levin, a freshman at
Wilbur, said that "from the be
ginning I thought I would live
in a fraternity. I think that liv
ing with a group of guys is
enough education, as opposed
to coed living, in itself."
Levin claimed to have visited
"six or seven" fraternities, and
was "impressed by nearly all of
them. I found a very relaxed
atmosphere." He also stated that
the frats were not as stereo
typed as he had thought.
Delta Kappa Epsilon, which is
moving into the new cluster ,has
what rush chairman Star Cooke
says is a "very low member
ship right now." But he said that
"many freshmen realize this is
a chance to turn a fraternity in
to their own image."
