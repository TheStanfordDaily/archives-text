## Academic Senate Plan Ready 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
A proposed charter for a "Sen
ate of the Academic Council"
will be in faculty members'
hands later this week, according
to Prof. Kenneth J. Arrow,
chairman of the Council's Exec
utive Committee.

The 940-member Academic
Council will vote on the charter
at its spring quarter meeting
April 5.
The Executive Committee
will put the finishing touches
on the charter at a meeting
today.
The Senate will not replace
the Academic Council, and a pro
cedure is envisioned for review
ing Senate decisions by the en
tire Council. But the nine-mem
ber Executive Committee will
disband if the Senate is estab
lished.
Early proposals for the
Senate criticized the Academic
Council as too large. All 940
faculty of the rank of assist
ant professor or above are
members. The Executive Com
mittee said too much responsi
bility was pressed upon it be
cause of the Council's Infre
quent meetings.
The faculty have wide powers
to make University policy, the
Executive Committee argues,
but the defective structure of
the Council forces administra
tors to assume many faculty
powers.
The Academic Council theo
retically "has general power and
responsibility for the internal
administration of the Univers
ity," according to the Stanford

Information Bulletin. The Exec
utive Committee says a 53-mem
ber legislature could "assume
a larger role ... in the affairs
of the University."
Although only faculty will
have votes in the Senate, some
administrators will sit as non
voting members. Non-faculty, in
cluding students, will be able
to serve on all Senate commit
tees.
Arrow, an economics profes
sor, has guided the Senate pro
posal since 1966. But he won't
be at Stanford to attend the
body's first meeting if it is es
tablished. Arrow will leave for
a Harvard professorship start
ing in September.
