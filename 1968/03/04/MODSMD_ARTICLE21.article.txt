# Sociology Experiment Studies Freshmen's Group Behavior

### BARBARA RITZ 
In. certain group situations,
the more you talk, the more In
formed people think you are.
This is one finding from a
series of experiments on so
cial interaction conducted au
tumn quarter.
Dr. Hamit Fisek of Stanford's
Laboratory for Social Research
conducted the experiments us
ing over 200 male freshman Civ
students.
The students were placed in
task-oriented groups of three
members each. They were sup
posed to be complete strangers
from different Civ sections and
if possible from different dorms.
Each group was told to devise
an interesting problem for an
other, group to solve.
While the members talked
with each other, two observers
seated behind a two-way mirror
recorded their conversation and
the number of times an indivi
dual talked.
Murray Webster, also from
the Lab for Social Research, ex
plained afterwards, "If you ask
the group members who was
most helpful in solving prob
lems, the person who talked the
mo'st was perceived as being thin
most helpful." He questioned
whether this student was really
more helpful or merely talka
tive.
The experiments were not de
vised to show any practical ap
plication, he noted, but were in
tended to construct a mathe
matical model.
The tabulated results were
fairly consistent. The person who
dominated the conversation with

in the first five minutes remain
ed the group leader during the
rest of the 45 minute session. Of
ten tensions build up when per
sons disagree, said Webster. The
person who talks the second
most often is the one who makes
jokes and smoothes things over.
Also consistent was the task
each group chose for another.
"The main task 75 per cent of
the time,' 'said Webster, "con
cerned some version of alien
beings from another planet."
There were some choices that
were conspicuously absent.
"They never talked about sex,"
he said, "except in three or four
of the groups. But they asked
beforehand, sort of groups
are going to be discussing this
problem?' As the groups are all
male," Webster, explained, "they
decided it was all right."

Women were not chosen as
subjects for the experiments.
But these were task-oriented
groups, he explained. "It's noi
like talking to people at a cock
tail party." There is a visible
status characteristic that both
females and males recognize
when they are placed in a task
making or problem solvinf
group, said Webster. "Women
do not participate in the discus
sion as much."
Experiments involving human
beings often have an imperson
al aura about them, he explain
ed. "It's important to remember
that we are not characterizing
people, but only interaction of
people. There is a tendency to
look for personal applications in
such experiments," Webster said,
"and that is outside the realm
of sociology."
