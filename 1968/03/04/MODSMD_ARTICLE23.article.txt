# Poteete, Vance Fire Shutouts As Cards Pummel Cal Poly
## 
### PETER DUFFY 
Rod Poteete and Sandy Vance
fired back to back 1-0 and 2-0
shutouts Saturday to complete
a three game sweep of Cal Poly
at Pomona, after the Tribe had
won Friday's game, 5-4, by rally
ing for three r.uns in the ninth
inning.
It was Poteete's second
straight shutout as he allowed
five hits and fanned twelve. The
only run scored came in the
fourth inning when Mike Scho
maker singled, stole second, ad
vanced to third on an infield
out, and scored on Bob Boone's
single to left.
In the seven inning night
cap Vance yielded only two
singles and struck out eight
as he bounced back from his
first losing performance in
Stanford competition last Sat
urday against Santa Clara.
Russ Tweet open up the Stan
ford scoring in the second in

ning with a 350 ft. home run
over the left field fence. Tweet's
blast was the first Tribe round
tripper of the season.
Stanford added its second and
final run in the fourth when Bob
Gallagher scored from third on
a passed ball. Gallagher had
singled, advanced to second on
Jeff Rohlfing's base hit, and
moved to third when Tweet was
walked. With the squeeze on,
the ball bounced by the catcher
and Gallagher, scored easily.
Friday's game was as excit
ing a contest one will ever see
at the Sunken Diamond. Af
ter Rohlfing had driven in his
second run in the eighth to
put the Tribe out in front 2-1,
Cal Poly came up with 3 un
earned runs off Harvey Shank
in the top of the ninth to go
ahead 4-2.
Cal Poly in all their merri
ment appeared to have the game
sewn up as Mike Ewing led off

for the Tribe in the last of the
ninth. Ewing drew a walk how
ever, and Mike Amirato's double
play grounder was booted to
put runners on first and second.
At this point the fans stop
ped leaving and Cal Poly stop
ped laughing. Mark Marquess
lair' down a perfect bunt and
was safe at first to load the
bases. Mike Schomaker then
slapped a grounder to third but
the throw home was wide. With
one run already across, the Tribr*
had the bases loaded with no
outs.
Gallagher then lofted a fly ball
to left that scored Amirato from
third for the tying run. Claim
ing that Amirato had left too
soon, Cal Poly appealed the play
by throwing to third. The um
pires said nothing so on the
next pitch, the Cal Poly pitcher
toed the rubber and again threw
to an unoccupied third base.
The stratagem backfired,
however, for the umpire's call
ed it a balk and this put run
ners on second and third. Bob
Boone then lashed the next
pitch into center to score Mar
quess for the game's winning
run, and put an end to the
melodramatic affair.
If Cal Poly seemed a little life
less at Saturday, Friday's loss
was more than somewhat re
sponsible for it.
Tribe coach Ray Young was
very pleased with the pitching
over the weekend but said, "I'd
still like to see our hitting come
around."
With five straight wins fol
lowing the loss to Santa Clara
last Saturday, the Tribe meets
the University of Pacific tomor
row at the Sunken Diamond.
