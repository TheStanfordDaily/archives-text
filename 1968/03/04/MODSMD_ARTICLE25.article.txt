## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
USC won its ninth conference
swimming title, beating Stan
ford 500% to 439% at the Uni
versity of Washington last
weekend. UCLA barely edged
Oregon for third place far be
hind the leaders.
Stanford swimmers, who did
not peak for the AAWU meet,
begin next week the gradual
tapering process for the NCAA
championships Mar. 28-30 at
Dartmouth. Last year the In
dians rebounded from a 60 point
conference meet loss to South
ern Cal, and outraced the Tro
jans for the NCAA title.
Dick Both and Bill Main
were the Cards' only double
winners at the meet Roth
broke his own conference rec
ords en route to victories In
both 200 and 400 individual
medleys (158.3 and 4:18.0).
Roth also took second behind
Stanford captain Bob Momsen
in the 200 breaststroke.
Main left no doubt about the
diving competition, dominating
both low board and high board
events from the start.
Luis Nicolao, just back from
the South American Champion
ships, where he led Argentina to
victory over Mexico, won his
specialty, the 100 butterfly, at
Seattle. Nicolao took second in
the 200 fly.

Momsen, who set a confer
ence record 2:15.2 in the 200
breast, placed third in the 500
free with a bright 4:51.0.
Mike Wall also hit 4:51 in the
500, took third in the 200 free
at 1:46.8 and fourth in the 1650

with a 17:07 swim. All of Wall's
times ranged considerably faster
than last year.
Ken Hammer got off to a
slow start but had a great fi
nal day. He took third in the
100 free in 47.5, moments later
took fourth in the 100 fly in
52.6, and finally anchored
Stanford's medley relay in a
gasp-worthy 45.7.
Morgan Manning took third in
the 50 free at 21.9 and seventh
in the 100 with a 48.0 sprint.
Manning took a break from
sprint freestyle to snap up sec
ond place in the 100 breast in
1:01.5. Jeff Hammett took sixth
in the 50 in 22.0.
Tom Jamison turned on in the
distance freestyle, hitting 4:55.6
in the 500, 17:28.2 in the 1650,
and placing fourth in the 200
free in 1:48.3.
Jim Nickoloff took fourth in

the 200 fly and tied for fourth
in the 100 fly.
The Cards took second In all
three relays behind USC.
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
noted that the "Conference meet
turned out to be about what we
expected." Gaughran was
pleased with a number of indi
vidual performances, consider
ing the heavy workout load be
fore the meet.
In the weeks to come, the
sprinters will drop their heavy
chores and start working for the
fine tuned stroke that spells
American record relays. The dis
tance men and "heavier" swim
mers will not sprint down as
soon as the sprinters, but taper
gradually, emphasizing pace
work.
