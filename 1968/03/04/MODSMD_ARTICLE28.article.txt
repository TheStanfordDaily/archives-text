# Uclans, Trojans Trounce Tribe, Harris Falls Short
## 
### GARY CAVALLI 
They said it couldn't be done
—and they were right.
Stanford had little hope of up
setting the two leading Pacific-8
basketball powers, USC and
UCLA, and despite some flash
es of excellent basketball, the
Tribe was clearly outclassed by
the two LA quintets.
Friday night the Indians hum
bly bowed to the defending
NCAA champion UCLans 100-
62, while Saturday they put up
a stiff fight before dropping a
72-60 verdict to USC.
Senior, forward Art Harris, in
tallying 25 points in the two
ballgames, failed by one point
in his personal quest to catch
Hank Luisetti, the third leading
scorer in Stanford history. Har
ris, having scored 1290 career
points, will bypass Luisetti with
his first bucket next Friday night
at Berkeley.
Harris will also be going for
Tom Dose's single season scor
ing record of 520 points next
weekend against Cal. The 6-4
ace now needs 19 points to re
cord the best year in Stanford
scoring annals.
For seven-and-a-half min
utes of Friday's game at Paul
ey Pavilion, the Indians look
ed great. But then the Bruins
exploded, using their height
advantage and an Incredible
shooting exhibition to devast
tate the Tribe.
Stanford grabbed a 3-0 lead
on a free throw by Harris and
a fast-break layup by Gary
Petersmever, as UCLA went
scoreless ..'or two-and-ahalf min
utes. Ninety seconds later it was

9-4 Stanford — Harris adding
four more points and Peters
meyer two — and Bruin coach
John Wooten quickly called time
out.
From that point it was all
UCLA, as the second-ranked
Bruins buried an unbelievable
21 of the next 22 shots to open
up a 49-30 bulge at halftime. Al
cindor hit 11 straight after his
initial misses, and left the court
with 23 points.
Halftime statistics showed
the Bruins with a mere 13-12
edge in rebounding, but when
a team shoots 74 per cent from
the field, rebounding becomes
something less than crucial.
Alcindor left with over 10
minutes to go, having scored 31
points. By that time the home
club had a 35-point cushion, and
both benches were emptied. The
final buzzer mercifully drew
things to a close at 100-62.
Saturday night Stanford
played the same type of game
— starting with a bang and
ending with a whimper.
The Tribe led three times in
the early going, but the Trojans
went ahead to stay after 12 min
utes had elapsed. With Steve Jen
nings hitting well from the out
side and seven-footer Ron Taylor
dominating things inside, USC
held a 33-27 margin at the half
time intermission.
Sporadic hot spells by Harris,
Mai McElwain, and Petersmeyer
enabled Stanford to stay close,
but the issue was never, really
in doubt. An alert Tribe defense,
which held USC's top scorer
Bill Hewitt to six points (all in
the second half), was instrumen

tal in keeping the final score a
respectable 72-60.
McElwain played two fine
games for the Indians, rebound
ing well against much taller foes,
while gunning in 15 points Fri
day and 13 Saturday. Harris
chipped in with 12 the first night,
and matched McElwain Satur
day.
Coach Paul Neumann's frosh
team dropped a 78-69 verdict
to a torrid San Jose State five
Saturday night. The Spartans,
fired up after a stunning up
set over previously unbeaten
Cal Friday night, retained the
hot hand in dumping Stanford
Saturday.

ballgames, failed by one point
in his personal quest to catch
Hank Luisetti, the third leading
scorer in Stanford history. Har
ris, having scored 1290 career
points, will bypass Luisetti with
his first bucket next Friday night
at Berkeley.
Harris will also be going for
Tom Dose's single season scor

For seven-and-a-half min
utes of Friday's game at Paul
ey Pavilion, the Indians look
ed great. But then the Bruins
exploded, using their height
advantage and an Incredible
shooting exhibition to devast
tate the Tribe.
Stanford grabbed a 3-0 lead
on a free throw by Harris and
a fast-break layup by Gary
Petersmever, as UCLA went
scoreless ..'or two-and-ahalf min
utes. Ninety seconds later it was

9-4 Stanford — Harris adding
four more points and Peters
meyer two — and Bruin coach
John Wooten quickly called time
out.
From that point it was all
UCLA, as the second-ranked
Bruins buried an unbelievable
21 of the next 22 shots to open
up a 49-30 bulge at halftime. Al
cindor hit 11 straight after his
initial misses, and left the court
with 23 points.
Halftime statistics showed
the Bruins with a mere 13-12
edge in rebounding, but when
a team shoots 74 per cent from
the field, rebounding becomes
something less than crucial.
Alcindor left with over 10
minutes to go, having scored 31
points. By that time the home
club had a 35-point cushion, and
both benches were emptied. The
final buzzer mercifully drew
things to a close at 100-62.
Saturday night Stanford
played the same type of game
— starting with a bang and
ending with a whimper.
The Tribe led three times in
the early going, but the Trojans
went ahead to stay after 12 min
utes had elapsed. With Steve Jen
nings hitting well from the out
side and seven-footer Ron Taylor
dominating things inside, USC
held a 33-27 margin at the half
time intermission.
Sporadic hot spells by Harris,
Mai McElwain, and Petersmeyer
enabled Stanford to stay close,
but the issue was never, really
in doubt. An alert Tribe defense,
which held USC's top scorer
Bill Hewitt to six points (all in
the second half), was instrumen

tal in keeping the final score a
respectable 72-60.
McElwain played two fine
games for the Indians, rebound
ing well against much taller foes,
while gunning in 15 points Fri
day and 13 Saturday. Harris
chipped in with 12 the first night,
and matched McElwain Satur
day.
Coach Paul Neumann's frosh
team dropped a 78-69 verdict
to a torrid San Jose State five
Saturday night. The Spartans,
fired up after a stunning up
set over previously unbeaten
Cal Friday night, retained the
hot hand in dumping Stanford
Saturday.

ey Pavilion, the Indians look
ed great. But then the Bruins
exploded, using their height
advantage and an Incredible
shooting exhibition to devast
tate the Tribe.
Stanford grabbed a 3-0 lead
on a free throw by Harris and
a fast-break layup by Gary
Petersmever, as UCLA went
scoreless ..'or two-and-ahalf min
utes. Ninety seconds later it was

9-4 Stanford — Harris adding
four more points and Peters
meyer two — and Bruin coach
John Wooten quickly called time
out.
From that point it was all
UCLA, as the second-ranked
Bruins buried an unbelievable
21 of the next 22 shots to open
up a 49-30 bulge at halftime. Al
cindor hit 11 straight after his
initial misses, and left the court
with 23 points.
Halftime statistics showed
the Bruins with a mere 13-12
edge in rebounding, but when
a team shoots 74 per cent from
the field, rebounding becomes
something less than crucial.
Alcindor left with over 10
minutes to go, having scored 31
points. By that time the home
club had a 35-point cushion, and
both benches were emptied. The
final buzzer mercifully drew
things to a close at 100-62.
Saturday night Stanford
played the same type of game
— starting with a bang and
ending with a whimper.
The Tribe led three times in
the early going, but the Trojans
went ahead to stay after 12 min
utes had elapsed. With Steve Jen
nings hitting well from the out
side and seven-footer Ron Taylor
dominating things inside, USC
held a 33-27 margin at the half
time intermission.
Sporadic hot spells by Harris,
Mai McElwain, and Petersmeyer
enabled Stanford to stay close,
but the issue was never, really
in doubt. An alert Tribe defense,
which held USC's top scorer
Bill Hewitt to six points (all in
the second half), was instrumen

tal in keeping the final score a
respectable 72-60.
McElwain played two fine
games for the Indians, rebound
ing well against much taller foes,
while gunning in 15 points Fri
day and 13 Saturday. Harris
chipped in with 12 the first night,
and matched McElwain Satur
day.
Coach Paul Neumann's frosh
team dropped a 78-69 verdict
to a torrid San Jose State five
Saturday night. The Spartans,
fired up after a stunning up
set over previously unbeaten
Cal Friday night, retained the
hot hand in dumping Stanford
Saturday.

They said it couldn't be done

Stanford had little hope of up
setting the two leading Pacific-8
basketball powers, USC and
UCLA, and despite some flash

Tribe was clearly outclassed by
the two LA quintets.
Friday night the Indians hum
bly bowed to the defending
NCAA champion UCLans 100-
62, while Saturday they put up
a stiff fight before dropping a
72-60 verdict to USC.
Senior, forward Art Harris, in
tallying 25 points in the two
ballgames, failed by one point
in his personal quest to catch
Hank Luisetti, the third leading
scorer in Stanford history. Har
ris, having scored 1290 career
points, will bypass Luisetti with
his first bucket next Friday night
at Berkeley.
Harris will also be going for
Tom Dose's single season scor
