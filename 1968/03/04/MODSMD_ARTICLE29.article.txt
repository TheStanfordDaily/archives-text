# We've Got The (Scrum) Axe! Late Try Topples Bears, 14-9
## 
### DAVE NOLAND 
A determined Stanford rugby
team settled down after some
first-half blunders and came
from behind to beat Cal 14 9
and regain possession of the
Scrum Axe. Joe Neal's try with
less than five minutes left was
the clinching score.
Last week at Stanford, Cal
upset the Indians 15-13 to take
the lead in the two game scrum
Axe series. The Tribe had to
win this weekend's contest by at
least three points to get the
Axe back from its three-year
stay in Cal hands.
Needless penalties by the
overanxious and aggressive
Indians resulted in three first
half penalty kicks by Cal
kicking ace Les Williams, one
of nearly 40 yards.
A Leon Hartvickson penalty
kick and the Tribe's first suc
cessful dropkick of the year (by
Ray Wilson) took up some of
the slack, and the halftime
scoreboard read 9-6, Cal.
After a sloppy and very rough
first half, Stanford got down to
the serious business of playing
good rugby.
The Indian forwards put in
tense pressure on Williams and
fly half Brian Forbes. Conse
quently, these two were unable
to repeat their brilliant kicking,
which had been the decisive fac
tor in last weekend's battle.
Hartvickson tied it up with his
second penalty kick of the day,
as Stanford dominated most of
the second half offensively.
Cal was hurt by the loss of
Williams, who had come into

the second half limping and
had to leave after about ten
minutes.
Wing Dave Moueen set the
stage for the winning try
with a center kick to just In
front of the goal line. The
alert Stanford scrum piled up
on the ball, and when it came
out, prop Joe Neal pounced
on It and took it over from
about five yards out.
Hartvickson had no trouble
icing the cake, with his seventh

and eighth points of the day.
Stanford had a scare in the
last four minutes as Cal blocked
a kick near the Indians' goal
line, but John Huss ran the ball
out of trouble. A Cal try or pen
alty kick at that point would
not have won the game, but it
would have reduced the victory
margin to two and given Cal
the Axe on total points in the
two game series.
The second JV team rolled
over the Cal JV's 21-5.

Indians resulted in three first
half penalty kicks by Cal
kicking ace Les Williams, one
of nearly 40 yards.
A Leon Hartvickson penalty
kick and the Tribe's first suc
cessful dropkick of the year (by
Ray Wilson) took up some of
the slack, and the halftime
scoreboard read 9-6, Cal.
After a sloppy and very rough
first half, Stanford got down to
the serious business of playing
good rugby.
The Indian forwards put in
tense pressure on Williams and
fly half Brian Forbes. Conse
quently, these two were unable
to repeat their brilliant kicking,
which had been the decisive fac
tor in last weekend's battle.
Hartvickson tied it up with his
second penalty kick of the day,
as Stanford dominated most of
the second half offensively.
Cal was hurt by the loss of
Williams, who had come into

the second half limping and
had to leave after about ten
minutes.
Wing Dave Moueen set the
stage for the winning try
with a center kick to just In
front of the goal line. The
alert Stanford scrum piled up
on the ball, and when it came
out, prop Joe Neal pounced
on It and took it over from
about five yards out.
Hartvickson had no trouble
icing the cake, with his seventh

and eighth points of the day.
Stanford had a scare in the
last four minutes as Cal blocked
a kick near the Indians' goal
line, but John Huss ran the ball
out of trouble. A Cal try or pen
alty kick at that point would
not have won the game, but it
would have reduced the victory
margin to two and given Cal
the Axe on total points in the
two game series.
The second JV team rolled
over the Cal JV's 21-5.
A determined Stanford rugby
team settled down after some
first-half blunders and came
from behind to beat Cal 14 9
and regain possession of the
Scrum Axe. Joe Neal's try with
less than five minutes left was
the clinching score.
Last week at Stanford, Cal
upset the Indians 15-13 to take
the lead in the two game scrum
Axe series. The Tribe had to
win this weekend's contest by at
least three points to get the
Axe back from its three-year
stay in Cal hands.
Needless penalties by the
overanxious and aggressive
Indians resulted in three first

kicking ace Les Williams, one
of nearly 40 yards.
