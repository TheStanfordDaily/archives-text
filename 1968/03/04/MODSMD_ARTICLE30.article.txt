# Chi's Versus Panthers
## 
### 
The University Championship,
for the "A" and "B" team bas
ketball tournament will be de
cided during the next three days
in the Pavilion.
The semi-finals of the "B"
tournament will be tonight with
the Theta Delt B's playing the
Sigma Chi B's at 6:30 and the
SAE B's playing the Alpha Sig
B's at 7:30.
An "A" quarterfinal game will
follow at 9:30, with the Delts,
who eliminated second-seeded
Chi Psi 55-54, playing the Pains
men. Bruce Wilson of the Delts
had 28 points.
In the 'A" semifinal game to
night at 8:30, top-seeded Sigma
Chi plays the third-seeded Pan
thers in what could be the best
game of the tournament.
The Chi's, playing a lacka
daisical game, were out-hus
tled by the Theta Delta but
won in overtime, 63-07. The
Theta Delts were ahead by

five with less than a minute
remaining, but a full court
press brought the Chi's with
in one point with 12 seconds
left
Rollie Regnery was fouled at
the buzzer and sank his first
shot in a one-and one situation.
He missed the second, however,
throwing the game into over
time.
Larry Rosenswelg then hit
two straight buckets and the
Chi's were ahead to stay.
The Panthers had a close
game on Saturday morning
against Serra. They trailed 27-
20 but Charles Evans started hit
ting from the outside and the
Panthers sneaked past 52-49.
Sigma Chi has a"n obvious
height advantage, but the Pan
thers could win with hustle. If
the Chi's stand around as they
did Thursday night against the
Theta Delts, the Panther speed
could spell defeat for them.
