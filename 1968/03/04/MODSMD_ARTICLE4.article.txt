# Legal Counsel Denied
## Student Fights Draft Board 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
A third-year Stanford law stu
dent, Gary A. Patton, is current
ly embroiled in a legal dispute
over whether he—or anyone—
has a right to an attorney In his
dealings with the draft board.
Patton, who says he cannot
"morally cooperate with the Se
lective Service System," has re
tained his father, Philips Patton,
a lawyer, as his counsel.
He did this after his local
board, No. 59 in Santa Cruz, no
tified him he was in danger of
being declared delinquent.
But his father filed a suit In
Federal court In San Francisco
Friday complaining that both
the state and local draft
boards had refused to let him
handle draft matters for his
son.
The affair began in November
when the law student sent a
letter to his local board saying
he could not cooperate with the
Selective Service System for re
ligious reasons.
The board sent him the stan
dard form for applying for con
scientious objector status. But
Patton refused to fill out the pa
per, since to him it was coopera
tion with the System.
"I can't cooperate with it be
cause I believe if you really
think about what you're doing,
you have to take responsibility

for whatever you do, and I think
participating in the Selective
Service System is helping pre
pare for war," he said.
Instead of returning the form,
he wrote the board a letter ex
plaining his views, and asking
to talk with them about the is
sue.
Patton had been out of
school during the Fall quar
ter, serving in the Merchant
Marines on a ship that went
to Vietnam, his father said.
Thus, the draft board reclassi
fied Patton I-A. This was after
he sent them his second letter.
Patton immediately returned
his classification notice. And on
Feb. 7 received a warning that
he was in danger of being de
clared delinquent.
This was when Patton decided
to have his father advise him in
his dealings with the draft board
—whereupon the board balked.
Patton's father hopes to get
his case "to a hearing as soon
as possible—within 60 days.
"But more than that, I hope
that when the Attorney General
hears what's happening, he will
act as a good American and back
off," he said.
Even when this issue of coun
sel is decided, there are others
still in question. For if Patton
is declared delinquent, the next
step for him, if the board gets

its way, would be the Army or
jail, according to Patton's fa
ther.
And Patton would choose jail.
The unuusal part of the situa
tion is that Patton could prob
ably get CO status if he applied
for it, but he refuses to cooper
ate with the Selective Service
System in any way.
According to his father,
Patton has "a very strong reli
gious background. He started
Sunday School as soon as he
oould walk."
His mother was his Sunday
School teacher and his father
the senior warden of the church
—an Episcopal church in Palo
Alto, where the Pattons lived
until they moved to Santa Cruz
a few years ago.
The family belonged to the
Episcopal church until three
years ago, when they left the
church because it had not taken
a strong stand against the Viet
nam war. They became Quakers.
"As a matter of fact it was
Gary who started the whole
thing," Philips Patton said, the
"whole thing" being the move
from the Episcopal church to
the Quakers.
As for the suit, Patton's fath
er feels there is some difference
between this and the Escobedo
and Miranda decisions of the
Supreme Court, but is confident

of receiving a favorable decision.
In Escobedo and Miranda,
the high court ruled that any
person up for trial has a
right to counsel, whether or
not he can afford it. Both Es
cobedo and Miranda had been
arrested, while Patton has
only been theatened with ar
rest.
But the Santa Cruz lawyer
feels that the same principles
should apply, that everyone has
the right to be represented by
counsel.
"There is no mention in the
Military Selective Service Act
of 1967 whereby this common
law right to representation has
been repealed," he said in his
suit.
"If the regulations mean a
registrant cannot be represent
ed in this situation," he contin
ued, "they are unconstitutional."
Patton's father believes that
a lawyer should be present at
any hearing with a draft board
because "whatever you say goes
on record."
"This is a dynamic situation,
so you need advice on a dy
namic basis. So it's really not
right for the draft hoard to
say you can't have advice —
on a dynamic basis. THEY
have thHr own counsel.
"It's not fair. It's like David
and Goliath."

his case "to a hearing as soon
as possible—within 60 days.
"But more than that, I hope
that when the Attorney General
hears what's happening, he will
act as a good American and back
off," he said.
Even when this issue of coun
sel is decided, there are others
still in question. For if Patton
is declared delinquent, the next
step for him, if the board gets

its way, would be the Army or
jail, according to Patton's fa
ther.
And Patton would choose jail.
The unuusal part of the situa
tion is that Patton could prob
ably get CO status if he applied
for it, but he refuses to cooper
ate with the Selective Service
System in any way.
According to his father,
Patton has "a very strong reli
gious background. He started
Sunday School as soon as he
oould walk."
His mother was his Sunday
School teacher and his father
the senior warden of the church
—an Episcopal church in Palo
Alto, where the Pattons lived
until they moved to Santa Cruz
a few years ago.
The family belonged to the
Episcopal church until three
years ago, when they left the
church because it had not taken
a strong stand against the Viet
nam war. They became Quakers.
"As a matter of fact it was
Gary who started the whole
thing," Philips Patton said, the
"whole thing" being the move
from the Episcopal church to
the Quakers.
As for the suit, Patton's fath
er feels there is some difference
between this and the Escobedo
and Miranda decisions of the
Supreme Court, but is confident

of receiving a favorable decision.
In Escobedo and Miranda,
the high court ruled that any
person up for trial has a
right to counsel, whether or
not he can afford it. Both Es
cobedo and Miranda had been
arrested, while Patton has
only been theatened with ar
rest.
But the Santa Cruz lawyer
feels that the same principles
should apply, that everyone has
the right to be represented by
counsel.
"There is no mention in the
Military Selective Service Act
of 1967 whereby this common
law right to representation has
been repealed," he said in his
suit.
"If the regulations mean a
registrant cannot be represent
ed in this situation," he contin
ued, "they are unconstitutional."
Patton's father believes that
a lawyer should be present at
any hearing with a draft board
because "whatever you say goes
on record."
"This is a dynamic situation,
so you need advice on a dy
namic basis. So it's really not
right for the draft hoard to
say you can't have advice —
on a dynamic basis. THEY
have thHr own counsel.
"It's not fair. It's like David
and Goliath."
A third-year Stanford law stu
dent, Gary A. Patton, is current
ly embroiled in a legal dispute
over whether he—or anyone—
has a right to an attorney In his
dealings with the draft board.
Patton, who says he cannot
"morally cooperate with the Se
lective Service System," has re
tained his father, Philips Patton,
a lawyer, as his counsel.
He did this after his local
board, No. 59 in Santa Cruz, no
tified him he was in danger of
being declared delinquent.
But his father filed a suit In
Federal court In San Francisco
Friday complaining that both
the state and local draft
boards had refused to let him
handle draft matters for his
son.
The affair began in November
when the law student sent a
letter to his local board saying
he could not cooperate with the
Selective Service System for re
ligious reasons.
The board sent him the stan
dard form for applying for con
scientious objector status. But
Patton refused to fill out the pa
per, since to him it was coopera
tion with the System.
"I can't cooperate with it be
cause I believe if you really
think about what you're doing,
you have to take responsibility

for whatever you do, and I think
participating in the Selective
Service System is helping pre
pare for war," he said.
Instead of returning the form,
he wrote the board a letter ex
plaining his views, and asking
to talk with them about the is
sue.
Patton had been out of
school during the Fall quar
ter, serving in the Merchant
Marines on a ship that went
to Vietnam, his father said.
Thus, the draft board reclassi
fied Patton I-A. This was after
he sent them his second letter.
Patton immediately returned
his classification notice. And on
Feb. 7 received a warning that
he was in danger of being de
clared delinquent.
This was when Patton decided
to have his father advise him in
his dealings with the draft board
—whereupon the board balked.

of 1967 whereby this common
law right to representation has
been repealed," he said in his
suit.
"If the regulations mean a
registrant cannot be represent
ed in this situation," he contin
ued, "they are unconstitutional."
Patton's father believes that
a lawyer should be present at
any hearing with a draft board
because "whatever you say goes
on record."
"This is a dynamic situation,
so you need advice on a dy
namic basis. So it's really not
right for the draft hoard to
say you can't have advice —
on a dynamic basis. THEY
have thHr own counsel.
"It's not fair. It's like David
and Goliath."
A third-year Stanford law stu
dent, Gary A. Patton, is current
ly embroiled in a legal dispute
over whether he—or anyone—
has a right to an attorney In his
dealings with the draft board.
Patton, who says he cannot
"morally cooperate with the Se
lective Service System," has re
tained his father, Philips Patton,
a lawyer, as his counsel.
He did this after his local
board, No. 59 in Santa Cruz, no
tified him he was in danger of
being declared delinquent.
But his father filed a suit In
Federal court In San Francisco
Friday complaining that both
the state and local draft
boards had refused to let him
handle draft matters for his
son.
The affair began in November
when the law student sent a
letter to his local board saying
he could not cooperate with the
Selective Service System for re
ligious reasons.
The board sent him the stan
dard form for applying for con
scientious objector status. But
Patton refused to fill out the pa
per, since to him it was coopera
tion with the System.
"I can't cooperate with it be
cause I believe if you really
think about what you're doing,
you have to take responsibility

for whatever you do, and I think
participating in the Selective
Service System is helping pre
pare for war," he said.
Instead of returning the form,
he wrote the board a letter ex
plaining his views, and asking
to talk with them about the is
sue.
Patton had been out of
school during the Fall quar
ter, serving in the Merchant
Marines on a ship that went
to Vietnam, his father said.
Thus, the draft board reclassi
fied Patton I-A. This was after
he sent them his second letter.
Patton immediately returned
his classification notice. And on
Feb. 7 received a warning that
he was in danger of being de
clared delinquent.
This was when Patton decided
to have his father advise him in
his dealings with the draft board
—whereupon the board balked.
Patton's father hopes to get
his case "to a hearing as soon
as possible—within 60 days.
"But more than that, I hope
that when the Attorney General
hears what's happening, he will
act as a good American and back
off," he said.
Even when this issue of coun
sel is decided, there are others
still in question. For if Patton
is declared delinquent, the next
step for him, if the board gets

its way, would be the Army or
jail, according to Patton's fa
ther.
And Patton would choose jail.
The unuusal part of the situa
tion is that Patton could prob
ably get CO status if he applied
for it, but he refuses to cooper
ate with the Selective Service
System in any way.
According to his father,
Patton has "a very strong reli
gious background. He started
Sunday School as soon as he
oould walk."
His mother was his Sunday
School teacher and his father
the senior warden of the church
—an Episcopal church in Palo
Alto, where the Pattons lived
until they moved to Santa Cruz
a few years ago.
The family belonged to the
Episcopal church until three
years ago, when they left the
church because it had not taken
a strong stand against the Viet
nam war. They became Quakers.
"As a matter of fact it was
Gary who started the whole
thing," Philips Patton said, the
"whole thing" being the move
from the Episcopal church to
the Quakers.
As for the suit, Patton's fath
er feels there is some difference
between this and the Escobedo
and Miranda decisions of the
Supreme Court, but is confident

of receiving a favorable decision.
In Escobedo and Miranda,
the high court ruled that any
person up for trial has a
right to counsel, whether or
not he can afford it. Both Es
cobedo and Miranda had been
arrested, while Patton has
only been theatened with ar
rest.
But the Santa Cruz lawyer
feels that the same principles
should apply, that everyone has
the right to be represented by
counsel.
"There is no mention in the
Military Selective Service Act
of 1967 whereby this common
law right to representation has
been repealed," he said in his
suit.
