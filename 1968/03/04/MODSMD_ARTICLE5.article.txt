# LASSU: Cut Classes As Draft, War Protest
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
The student legislature called
Thursday night for a campus
wide demonstration April 11 "to
protest the draft and to show
concern about the war in Viet
nam."
The resolution, which received
strong backing from ASSU Pres
ident Cesare Massarenti and was
passed by a strong majority,
rails on all students to cut
classes, professors to cancel
classes and office workers to
stay away from their offices.
(See text below.)
The legislature also rejected
• $4500 appropriation for the
proposed ASSU professor, an
other program strongly backed
by Massarenti. Cambridge eco
nomist Piero Sraffa, who had
been invited already, later re
plied he could not come to Stan
ford spring quarter. Second
choice would have been musi
cian Cecil Taylor and his quin
tet.
An attempt to pass the ap
propriation again in the form
of funds for NOISE, a cul
tural contingency fund, failed
for lack of a quorum when
opponents of the ASSU profes
sor program left the meeting
before adjournment.
Another attempt to pass funds

for the professor program may
be made if the legislature is call
ed into session this week. No
meeting has yet been set. The
legislature normally meets bi
weekly.
One legislator, commenting on
the day-of-protest resolution,
said it was a "violation of the
rights of at least a substantial
majority, if not more, of Stan
ford students, who pay both
tuition and ASSU dues, and don't
appreciate the misuse of the
ASSU to impede the education
al process."
The one-day demonstration is
expected to include speakers
"to talk on the various problems
involved with the war." So far,
however, no definite plans have
been made.
The legislature appropriated
$3000 for Afro-American His
tory Week, a program of
speakers and cultural events,
to take place spring quarter.
The Community for Relevant
Education received a $1000 ap
propriation to help support a
Bay Area-wide student confer
ence entitled "Challenge to
Change," stated aims of which
are "to confront students with
the need for leadership and the
role of students in effecting
change, and to present a con
structive alternative to the pres
ent Selective Service System as
a first step."
The conference, scheduled to
last the entire weekend of April
19 to 21, is expected to bring
together some 700 students from
Stanford and eight other Bay
Area colleges.
Projected speakers include
Donald Eberly, executive direc
tor of the National Service Sec
retariat; Will Rose, president of
Involvement Incorporated and
former director of People to
People; and Torrence Cullinan,
an economist with the Stanford
Research Institute.
Also approved with a $200
appropriation to cover about
one-third of the expenses of
the recent campus speech by
Black Power leader Ron Ka
renga, and $957 for an experi
mental tutorial program for
22 students at Ravenswood
High School in East Palo Alto.
The legislature heard Massa
renti charge that the University
protects students against the law
of the outside community. He
said the campus judicial system
should be allowed to deal "only

with academic problems."
Massarenti also charged the
all-faculty Interim Judicial Body
had broken the Tri Partite Agree
ment which set up the present
judicial system.
He said the agreement had
been broken last spring when
the IJB tried "as a new case"
the Marc Sapir sit-in case. Sapir
had been tried by the Judicial
Council for sitting-in at Presi
dent Wallace Sterling's office the
previous year, and had been ac
quitted. The IJB retried the case
and found him guilty.
"Now, no appellate court can
do that," Massarenti said, "ac
cording to the normal law, ex
cept in very few cases."
Speaking of the CIA-dem
onstration case, now being ap
pealed from the Judicial Coun
cil to the IJB by the dean of
students, Massarenti said,
"Since these things are not in
the order of major breaks in
the law, I don't see why a so
called appellate court should
take up appeals from the pros
ecutor."
The Council had acquitted
nine students accused of illegal
ly demonstrating against CIA
recruiting on campus Nov. 1. The
IJB is scheduled to hear the ap
peal this week.
