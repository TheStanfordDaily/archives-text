## Mayors Back Riot Report, Give Cure First Priority 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — May
ors of six American cities that
have been torn by racial vio
lence endorsed Sunday a presi
dential commission's findings
that white racism was the cause
— and a costly national effort
should be the cure.
But they indicated most of the
financial muscle must come
from the federal and state gov
ernments.
The mayors agreed that the
urban crisis must be given the
highest priority. But there was
general agreement also that the
campaign could be waged with
out a reduction of the Vietnam
war effort if the people will it.
The mayors are Jerome P.
Cavanaugh of Detroit, Carl B.
Stokes of Cleveland, and Sam
uel W. Yorty of Los Angeles.
Stokes said while he believes
the United States "has the re
sources to support a guns-and
butter economy," if he had to
choose between the Vietnam
war and the crisis in the cities,
"I'd have to put my priorities at
home. You have to take care of
home first."
• Teacher Strike Ends
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —
Mayor Joseph Alioto, tense and
tired after 22 hours of talks
with striking teachers over the
weekend, announced an end to
the one-day strike Sunday night
and said classes would resume
as normal Monday.
In a statement, Alioto said
there would be no reprisals
against the striking teachers.
"Nobody has won or lost in
this strike," said Alioto. "The
union simply reacted to my
plea."
"The only possible winners,"
he added, "are the children who
will be back in their classes.
• Ambush IS ear Saigon
SAIGON (AP) — A 200 man
Communist force killed 48
American soldiers and wounded
28 in an ambush along a key
highway nine miles north of Sai
gon, the U.S. Command report

ed Sunday. The attack under
scored the still-remaining ene
my strength in the capital area.
The Command said most of
the U.S. casualties came in the
first eight minutes of a wither
ing machine-gun assault from
well prepared positions.
The Communists shelled five
targets across South Vietnam
early Monday—the big U.S. air
bases at Da Nang and Bien Hoa,
the country's largest oil tank
farm, a government radio sta
tion and a provincial capital in
the Mekong Delta below Saigon.
Allied spokesmen said the at
tacks caused light casualties
and damage.
In other action a platoon of
30 Viet Cong troops raided the
headquarters of a South Vietna
mese infantry unit, burning
down 80 military homes and 60
civilian homes, an ammunition
warehouse and a clothing ware
house in Vi Tanh, a provincial
capital 120 miles southwest of
Saigon.
• Ignorance Of The Lau>
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Cali
fornians are ignorant of crim
inal penalties and this fact un
dercuts the theory that stiff
sentences deter crime, the As
sembly Criminal Procedure
Committee reported Sunday.
Committee chairman W. Craig
Biddle, a Riverside Republican,
said the report means "We must
find additional ways to deter
crime. . . The report confirms
that the public has virtually no
knowledge of our criminal pen
alty system."
The report made these other
points:
—A majority of those sur
veyed felt meaningful solutions
to crime lie in better breaks in
life for those most likely to com
mit crime, and in rehabilitation
of offenders.
—The average person, who
has little knowledge of penal
ties, is kept from lawbreaking
because of internal reasons,
such as guilt, loss of reputation
and moral values. Those with
more awareness of the results

of lawbreaking are held back
from crime mainly by external
reasons, such as fear of being
caught.
• Arab-Israeli Clash
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli
troops have killed 35 of an esti
mated 50 Arab raiders attempt
ing to infiltrate across the Jor
dan River into the occupied
west bank in the last days, a
Defense Ministry source said
Sunday.
He did not say where or, when
the clashes took place but it is
believed the Arabs were cut
down from ambushes along the
river frontier.
The informant did not men
tion any prisoners or Israeli
casualties.
He disclosed security forces
were tipped off on the raiders'
movements by west bank Arab
collaborators.
It was the first indication of
serious infiltration across the
river since King Hussein or Jor
dan warned sabotage groups not
to use his kingdom as a .spring
board for their attacks after In
filtration brought punishing Is
raeli retaliation against Jordan
Feb. 15.
• Gold Market Jittery
LONDON (AP) — Rumors that
South Africa will switch jts
gold sales from London to Paris
threatened Sunday to put new
strains on Europe's already jit
tery money markets, increasing
prospects of a continued gold
buying rush this week.
Behind the nervousness was
the fear that an extetnded gold
rush could imperil the value of
paper money, including the U.S.
dollar and the British pound.
Demand for gold last week
was the heaviest since the buy
ing wave that followed devalua
tion of the pound last Novem
ber.
South Africa produces nearly
75 per cent of the Western
world's gold. A shift of South
African gold sales to Paris, at
the very least, would put a
severe strain on world gold mar
kets. It could also help lead to
a higher world price for gold,
in effect devaluing the U.S. dol
lar and other currencies.
• Controversy Boils
BONN, Germany fAP) — The
controversy over President
Heinrich Luebke's past boiled
on Sunday as a major critic re

To the obvious dismay of the
government, Henri Nannen, edi

Luebke for remaining silent for
more than two years about doc
uments originally published by
the East German regime in an
attempt to prove that the West
German chief of state once
signed plans for Nazi concentra
tion camps.
"It has emerged that of all
these documents, not a single
one is false," Nannen said.

BUDAPEST, HUNGARY (AP)
— Communist sources said Sun

Suslov, infuriated by Romanian
charges that he was running the
Budapest meeting of Commu

strongly censuring Romania.
But, the informants added,
Italian delegate Enrico Berlin

would be improper and man

from consideration by the 66
parties still meeting here after
Romania walked out. Their re

• Oily Beaches
SAN JUAN, P.R. (AP) — A
tanker broke in two at the
mouth of busy San Juan harbor
Sunday and spilled her load of
oil into the harbor and onto
nearby beaches.
Oil washed onto resort beach
es. "I don't think anybody will
be swimming tomorrow," said
Carlos Santiago, assistant man
ager of the Caribe Hilton hotel.
The rear section of the tanker

drifted aground on a bar at the
west side of the harbor en

blocked the channel.
The ship was carrying a cargo
of nearly six million gallons of
oil from Venezuela to the Carib

SAIGON (AP) — A 200 man
Communist force killed 48
American soldiers and wounded
28 in an ambush along a key
highway nine miles north of Sai
gon, the U.S. Command report

ed Sunday. The attack under
scored the still-remaining ene
my strength in the capital area.
The Command said most of
the U.S. casualties came in the
first eight minutes of a wither
ing machine-gun assault from
well prepared positions.
The Communists shelled five
targets across South Vietnam
early Monday—the big U.S. air
bases at Da Nang and Bien Hoa,
the country's largest oil tank
farm, a government radio sta
tion and a provincial capital in
the Mekong Delta below Saigon.
Allied spokesmen said the at
tacks caused light casualties
and damage.
In other action a platoon of
30 Viet Cong troops raided the
headquarters of a South Vietna
mese infantry unit, burning
down 80 military homes and 60
civilian homes, an ammunition
warehouse and a clothing ware
house in Vi Tanh, a provincial
capital 120 miles southwest of
Saigon.
• Ignorance Of The Lau>
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Cali
fornians are ignorant of crim

Committee chairman W. Craig

said the report means "We must

The report made these other

mit crime, and in rehabilitation
of offenders.
—The average person, who

more awareness of the results

of lawbreaking are held back

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli

Sunday.
He did not say where or, when

• Gold Market Jittery
LONDON (AP) — Rumors that
South Africa will switch jts
gold sales from London to Paris
threatened Sunday to put new
strains on Europe's already jit
tery money markets, increasing
prospects of a continued gold
buying rush this week.
Behind the nervousness was
the fear that an extetnded gold
rush could imperil the value of
paper money, including the U.S.
dollar and the British pound.
Demand for gold last week
was the heaviest since the buy
ing wave that followed devalua
tion of the pound last Novem
ber.
South Africa produces nearly
75 per cent of the Western
world's gold. A shift of South
African gold sales to Paris, at
the very least, would put a
severe strain on world gold mar
kets. It could also help lead to
a higher world price for gold,
in effect devaluing the U.S. dol
lar and other currencies.

• Arab-Israeli Clash
JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli
troops have killed 35 of an esti
mated 50 Arab raiders attempt
ing to infiltrate across the Jor
dan River into the occupied
west bank in the last days, a
Defense Ministry source said
Sunday.
He did not say where or, when
the clashes took place but it is
believed the Arabs were cut
down from ambushes along the
river frontier.
The informant did not men
tion any prisoners or Israeli
casualties.
He disclosed security forces
were tipped off on the raiders'
movements by west bank Arab
collaborators.
It was the first indication of
serious infiltration across the

• Gold Market Jittery
LONDON (AP) — Rumors that
South Africa will switch jts
gold sales from London to Paris
threatened Sunday to put new
strains on Europe's already jit
tery money markets, increasing
prospects of a continued gold
buying rush this week.
Behind the nervousness was
the fear that an extetnded gold
rush could imperil the value of
paper money, including the U.S.
dollar and the British pound.
Demand for gold last week
was the heaviest since the buy
ing wave that followed devalua
tion of the pound last Novem
ber.
South Africa produces nearly
75 per cent of the Western
world's gold. A shift of South
African gold sales to Paris, at
the very least, would put a
severe strain on world gold mar
kets. It could also help lead to
a higher world price for gold,
in effect devaluing the U.S. dol
lar and other currencies.

rush could imperil the value of
paper money, including the U.S.

Demand for gold last week
was the heaviest since the buy

South Africa produces nearly

• Controversy Boils
BONN, Germany fAP) — The
controversy over President
Heinrich Luebke's past boiled
on Sunday as a major critic re

To the obvious dismay of the

Luebke for remaining silent for
more than two years about doc

"It has emerged that of all

SAN JUAN, P.R. (AP) — A
tanker broke in two at the
mouth of busy San Juan harbor
Sunday and spilled her load of
oil into the harbor and onto
nearby beaches.
Oil washed onto resort beach

be swimming tomorrow," said
Carlos Santiago, assistant man

The rear section of the tanker

drifted aground on a bar at the

The ship was carrying a cargo
of nearly six million gallons of
oil from Venezuela to the Carib

WASHINGTON (AP) — May
ors of six American cities that
have been torn by racial vio

that white racism was the cause
— and a costly national effort
should be the cure.
But they indicated most of the
financial muscle must come
from the federal and state gov
ernments.
The mayors agreed that the
urban crisis must be given the
highest priority. But there was
general agreement also that the
campaign could be waged with
out a reduction of the Vietnam
war effort if the people will it.
The mayors are Jerome P.
Cavanaugh of Detroit, Carl B.
Stokes of Cleveland, and Sam
uel W. Yorty of Los Angeles.
Stokes said while he believes
the United States "has the re
sources to support a guns-and
butter economy," if he had to
choose between the Vietnam
war and the crisis in the cities,
"I'd have to put my priorities at
home. You have to take care of
home first."

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) —

with striking teachers over the

In a statement, Alioto said
there would be no reprisals

"The only possible winners,"

• Ambush IS ear Saigon
SAIGON (AP) — A 200 man
Communist force killed 48
American soldiers and wounded
28 in an ambush along a key
highway nine miles north of Sai
gon, the U.S. Command report

ed Sunday. The attack under
scored the still-remaining ene

The Command said most of
the U.S. casualties came in the
first eight minutes of a wither
ing machine-gun assault from
well prepared positions.
The Communists shelled five
targets across South Vietnam
early Monday—the big U.S. air
bases at Da Nang and Bien Hoa,
the country's largest oil tank
farm, a government radio sta
tion and a provincial capital in
the Mekong Delta below Saigon.
Allied spokesmen said the at
tacks caused light casualties

headquarters of a South Vietna

down 80 military homes and 60
civilian homes, an ammunition
warehouse and a clothing ware
house in Vi Tanh, a provincial
capital 120 miles southwest of
Saigon.
• Ignorance Of The Lau>
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Cali

Committee chairman W. Craig

said the report means "We must

that the public has virtually no

The report made these other
points:
—A majority of those sur

to crime lie in better breaks in
life for those most likely to com
mit crime, and in rehabilitation
of offenders.
—The average person, who
has little knowledge of penal

because of internal reasons,
such as guilt, loss of reputation
and moral values. Those with
more awareness of the results

of lawbreaking are held back
from crime mainly by external
reasons, such as fear of being

Sunday.
He did not say where or, when

river frontier.
The informant did not men

He disclosed security forces
were tipped off on the raiders'
movements by west bank Arab
collaborators.
It was the first indication of
serious infiltration across the
