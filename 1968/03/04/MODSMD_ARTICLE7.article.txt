# Today And Tomorrow
## Conflicts Build Case For Rockefeller 
### Walter Lippmann 
The United States can count
itself fortunate that in
unhappy times there is an elec-'
tion near at hand. For this opens
up the chance to begin to get a
grip on the events which are
at present out of human and
political control. There is no
other, way to begin unless the
voters choose a new president
with new advisers and a new
party alignment.
The conflicts within the na
tion about the war, the cities,
the economy and, the racism
cannot be healed unless the na
tion as a whole can look forward
to a new beginning. The nation
cannot thrash around for an
other five years in its entangle
ments.
The dominent fact of our time
is not that opinion is divided
and that there is strong opposi
tion to the Administration. That
is normal enough in a free coun
try. The dominant fact is the
crumbling of that binding con
fidence in the nation's purposes
and its future, which in normal
times may be taken for granted.
There is a disintegration of
the hope, which is the inner
genius of the American spir
it, that men can solve their
problems and that evils can be
overcome. Lyndon Johnson
has undermined this hope, and
he has driven a whole gen
eration of Americans into
open or implicit revolt against
their government and their
own society; he has Instilled
in the rest of the people a
sense of hopelessness and be
wilderment.
The best that his most re
spected apologists can say is
that they can think of nothing
else for him to do. Such nihilism
is not good enough. This nation
has the right to leaders who
mean to master its fate, not to
drift helplessly with it. Only
new leaders can correct the
sense of uselessness and help
lessness.
With the ins having gotten
us into trouble, the only thing
to do is to turn to the outs. Un
less Mr„ Johnson retires and
along with him his chief ad
visers, only a Republican Pres
ident can save the country
from its plight.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy cannot
replace Lyndon Johnson in the
White House. What that gallant
man is doing is to rally the
saving remnant of the Demo
crats in order to save the soul
of the Democratic Party. He
is saving its future. But for the
dangerous present the hope of
the country is that it can find
a Republican to replace Presi
dent Johnson.
The Republican Party does
not have a wide choice of
available and qualified candi
dates. There are in fact only
two such men: former Vice
President Richard Nixon and
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Gov.
George Romney has with
drawn; Gov. Ronaid —„T.n
does not have the experience
needed to be President of the
United States In this critical
age.
Nixon has had a long and

rich experience in national gov
ernment and in national politics,
and there is little doubt that as
time goes on he has matured
well. The Nixon of today is a
more preposessing candidate
than was the Nixon of 1960.
But we should note that he has
had no experience in the ad
ministration of local and region
al politics. Yet, that is where
the action is. That is where the
great problems arise.
Nixon's biggest liability is
that as an opponent of Mr. John
son he does not offer a choice,
but produces an echo. He is an
echo of the President on the
Vietnamese war and on our fu
ture in Asia. He opens up no
prospect of a better turn in this
grim situation.
In terms of election politics,
Nixon has an even greater liabil
ity. It is the same liability which
Lyndon Johnson has—the credi
bility gap, which is the polite
way of saying that the masses
of people do not much believe
or trust him.
In a contest with Mr. John
son, the country would be asked
to choose between two men who,
as Mr. Dooley once said of two
other political candidates, are as
far apart as the two poles (since
they argue about so many
things) and yet as much alike
as the two poles (since they
both are icy and barren)
It is not surprising that in
the White House Nixon Is
now the preferred Republican
candidate. If only Mr. Johnson

could run against Nixon for
President and Sen. Everett
Dirkson as leader of Con
gress, his dreams would be
fulfilled. He would be as sure
of re-election as any President
can be who is fighting a war
which he cannot win and
might lose.
Measured only in these elec
toral terms, the case for Rocke
feller is virtually unanswerable.
He is the one Republican who
has the best chance of winning
the election. For while Nixon is
the preferred choice of the reg
ular Republicans, they are a
minority party and can win an
election only when a great mass
of Democrats and independent
voters defect to them. No other
Republican can match Rockefel
ler's attraction for this strategic
mass of voters.
In this respect the Nixon-
Rockefeller situation resembles
the Taft-Eisenhower contest in
1952. Taft also was the pre
ferred choice of the regular Re
publicans. But it was not cer
tain that he could win the elec
tion. Gen. Eisenhower, who was
not really a Republican, had the
ace of trumps since it was
certain that he could win the
election.
That is why he was nomin
ated by the Republican politi
cians.
If Rockefeller is nominated at
Miami, it will be for the same
reason, that he, if anyone, can
win the election.
Rockefeller would not have

this ace of trumps if the rea
sons for making him Presi
dent were not intrinsically
solid and sound. I submit that
In the year 1968 the reasons
are compelling. For what the
country will be choosing is
not a war President who could
win the war. It will be choos
ing a President for the recon
struction in which the war
will be wound up and the
wounds healed and the dam
age repaired, the damage
which Is not only material
but moral and spiritual.
In one way or another the
Vietnamese war will either ex
pand and explode into a global
catastrophe, or a way will be
managed to close it down. I re
gard Nelson Rockefeller as the
most qualified man available
for this supreme task of recon
struction. I believe that Lyndon
Johnson has disqualified him
self.
For myself, I have never been
concerned about Rockefeller's
refusal to talk about Vietnam
or align himself as a Hawk or
a Dove. That is a politician's
tactic. I have never talked about
Vietnam with the governor, be
cause I feel the less he said the
freer he would be to commit him
self to the inevitable task of liq
uidating the war. I am sure that
he would have to liquidate the
war in order to be the kind of
President he can be and wishes
to be.
The central and critical fact
is that the Vietnamese war is a

monstrous diversion from thr>
true American problem, which
is not the policing of Asia but
the mastery of the human ad
justment to thn modern, urban,
highly technological society in
which most Americans live.
For the "rship of the coun
try in this great task Rockefel
ler is pre-eminently qualified.
New York is the vortex of th ■
problem. If New York can bo
governed well, then tho problem
elsewhere is soluble.
Roekfeller is a successful
governor of New York, which
is to say that he has been tried
and proved and tempered in
the hottest fires of modernity.
The nomination and election of
Rockefeller would be a guar
antee to our people that the
essential problems of their
lives would be the main con
cern of the nation.
Rockefeller has been able to
be a successful governor not
only because of his well ordered
instincts and sympathies, but be
cause he has known whore to
find and how to recruit men of
the necessary ability. His family
interests and the wide ramifica
tions of their, good works have
brought him into contact with
the expertise which in our tech
nological and complex society is
indispensible to good manage
ment and good government.
For these reasons I hope Nel
son Rockefeller will be nominat
ed in August and elected in No
vember.

for this supreme task of recon
struction. I believe that Lyndon
Johnson has disqualified him
self.
For myself, I have never been
concerned about Rockefeller's
refusal to talk about Vietnam
or align himself as a Hawk or
a Dove. That is a politician's
tactic. I have never talked about
Vietnam with the governor, be
cause I feel the less he said the
freer he would be to commit him
self to the inevitable task of liq
uidating the war. I am sure that
he would have to liquidate the
war in order to be the kind of
President he can be and wishes
to be.
The central and critical fact
is that the Vietnamese war is a

monstrous diversion from thr>
true American problem, which
is not the policing of Asia but
the mastery of the human ad
justment to thn modern, urban,
highly technological society in
which most Americans live.
For the "rship of the coun
try in this great task Rockefel
ler is pre-eminently qualified.
New York is the vortex of th ■
problem. If New York can bo
governed well, then tho problem
elsewhere is soluble.
Roekfeller is a successful
governor of New York, which
is to say that he has been tried
and proved and tempered in
the hottest fires of modernity.
The nomination and election of
Rockefeller would be a guar
antee to our people that the
essential problems of their
lives would be the main con
cern of the nation.
Rockefeller has been able to
be a successful governor not
only because of his well ordered
instincts and sympathies, but be
cause he has known whore to
find and how to recruit men of
the necessary ability. His family
interests and the wide ramifica
tions of their, good works have
brought him into contact with
the expertise which in our tech
nological and complex society is
indispensible to good manage
ment and good government.
For these reasons I hope Nel
son Rockefeller will be nominat

The United States can count
itself fortunate that in
unhappy times there is an elec-'
tion near at hand. For this opens
up the chance to begin to get a
grip on the events which are
at present out of human and
political control. There is no
other, way to begin unless the
voters choose a new president
with new advisers and a new
party alignment.
The conflicts within the na
tion about the war, the cities,
the economy and, the racism
cannot be healed unless the na
tion as a whole can look forward
to a new beginning. The nation
cannot thrash around for an
other five years in its entangle
ments.
The dominent fact of our time
is not that opinion is divided
and that there is strong opposi
tion to the Administration. That
is normal enough in a free coun
try. The dominant fact is the
crumbling of that binding con
fidence in the nation's purposes
and its future, which in normal
times may be taken for granted.
There is a disintegration of
the hope, which is the inner
genius of the American spir
it, that men can solve their
problems and that evils can be
overcome. Lyndon Johnson
has undermined this hope, and
he has driven a whole gen
eration of Americans into
open or implicit revolt against
their government and their
own society; he has Instilled
in the rest of the people a
sense of hopelessness and be
wilderment.
The best that his most re
spected apologists can say is
that they can think of nothing
else for him to do. Such nihilism
is not good enough. This nation
has the right to leaders who
mean to master its fate, not to
drift helplessly with it. Only
new leaders can correct the
sense of uselessness and help
lessness.
With the ins having gotten
us into trouble, the only thing
to do is to turn to the outs. Un
less Mr„ Johnson retires and
along with him his chief ad
visers, only a Republican Pres
ident can save the country
from its plight.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy cannot
replace Lyndon Johnson in the
White House. What that gallant
man is doing is to rally the
saving remnant of the Demo
crats in order to save the soul
of the Democratic Party. He
is saving its future. But for the
dangerous present the hope of
the country is that it can find
a Republican to replace Presi
dent Johnson.
The Republican Party does
not have a wide choice of
available and qualified candi
dates. There are in fact only
two such men: former Vice
President Richard Nixon and
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Gov.
George Romney has with
drawn; Gov. Ronaid —„T.n
does not have the experience
needed to be President of the
United States In this critical
age.
Nixon has had a long and

rich experience in national gov
ernment and in national politics,
and there is little doubt that as
time goes on he has matured
well. The Nixon of today is a
more preposessing candidate
than was the Nixon of 1960.
But we should note that he has
had no experience in the ad
ministration of local and region
al politics. Yet, that is where
the action is. That is where the
great problems arise.
Nixon's biggest liability is
that as an opponent of Mr. John
son he does not offer a choice,
but produces an echo. He is an
echo of the President on the
Vietnamese war and on our fu
ture in Asia. He opens up no
prospect of a better turn in this
grim situation.
In terms of election politics,
Nixon has an even greater liabil
ity. It is the same liability which
Lyndon Johnson has—the credi
bility gap, which is the polite
way of saying that the masses
of people do not much believe
or trust him.
In a contest with Mr. John
son, the country would be asked
to choose between two men who,
as Mr. Dooley once said of two
other political candidates, are as
far apart as the two poles (since
they argue about so many
things) and yet as much alike
as the two poles (since they
both are icy and barren)
It is not surprising that in
the White House Nixon Is
now the preferred Republican
candidate. If only Mr. Johnson

could run against Nixon for
President and Sen. Everett
Dirkson as leader of Con
gress, his dreams would be
fulfilled. He would be as sure
of re-election as any President
can be who is fighting a war
which he cannot win and
might lose.
Measured only in these elec
toral terms, the case for Rocke
feller is virtually unanswerable.
He is the one Republican who
has the best chance of winning
the election. For while Nixon is
the preferred choice of the reg
ular Republicans, they are a
minority party and can win an
election only when a great mass
of Democrats and independent
voters defect to them. No other
Republican can match Rockefel
ler's attraction for this strategic
mass of voters.
In this respect the Nixon-
Rockefeller situation resembles
the Taft-Eisenhower contest in
1952. Taft also was the pre
ferred choice of the regular Re
publicans. But it was not cer
tain that he could win the elec
tion. Gen. Eisenhower, who was
not really a Republican, had the
ace of trumps since it was
certain that he could win the
election.
That is why he was nomin
ated by the Republican politi
cians.
If Rockefeller is nominated at
Miami, it will be for the same
reason, that he, if anyone, can
win the election.
Rockefeller would not have

this ace of trumps if the rea
sons for making him Presi
dent were not intrinsically
solid and sound. I submit that
In the year 1968 the reasons
are compelling. For what the
country will be choosing is
not a war President who could
win the war. It will be choos
ing a President for the recon
struction in which the war
will be wound up and the
wounds healed and the dam
age repaired, the damage
which Is not only material
but moral and spiritual.
In one way or another the
Vietnamese war will either ex
pand and explode into a global
catastrophe, or a way will be
managed to close it down. I re
gard Nelson Rockefeller as the
most qualified man available
for this supreme task of recon
struction. I believe that Lyndon
Johnson has disqualified him
self.
For myself, I have never been
concerned about Rockefeller's
refusal to talk about Vietnam

Dirkson as leader of Con

of re-election as any President
can be who is fighting a war
which he cannot win and
might lose.
Measured only in these elec

feller is virtually unanswerable.
He is the one Republican who
has the best chance of winning
the election. For while Nixon is
the preferred choice of the reg
ular Republicans, they are a
minority party and can win an
election only when a great mass
of Democrats and independent
voters defect to them. No other
Republican can match Rockefel

mass of voters.
In this respect the Nixon-
Rockefeller situation resembles
the Taft-Eisenhower contest in
1952. Taft also was the pre
ferred choice of the regular Re

not really a Republican, had the
ace of trumps since it was
certain that he could win the

That is why he was nomin

If Rockefeller is nominated at
Miami, it will be for the same
reason, that he, if anyone, can
win the election.
Rockefeller would not have

this ace of trumps if the rea
sons for making him Presi
dent were not intrinsically
solid and sound. I submit that
In the year 1968 the reasons
are compelling. For what the
country will be choosing is
not a war President who could
win the war. It will be choos
ing a President for the recon
struction in which the war
will be wound up and the
wounds healed and the dam
age repaired, the damage
which Is not only material
but moral and spiritual.
In one way or another the
Vietnamese war will either ex
pand and explode into a global
catastrophe, or a way will be
managed to close it down. I re
gard Nelson Rockefeller as the
most qualified man available
for this supreme task of recon
struction. I believe that Lyndon
Johnson has disqualified him
self.
For myself, I have never been
concerned about Rockefeller's
refusal to talk about Vietnam
or align himself as a Hawk or
a Dove. That is a politician's
tactic. I have never talked about
Vietnam with the governor, be
cause I feel the less he said the
freer he would be to commit him
self to the inevitable task of liq
uidating the war. I am sure that
he would have to liquidate the
war in order to be the kind of
President he can be and wishes
to be.
The central and critical fact
is that the Vietnamese war is a

monstrous diversion from thr>
true American problem, which
is not the policing of Asia but
the mastery of the human ad
justment to thn modern, urban,
highly technological society in
which most Americans live.
For the "rship of the coun

New York is the vortex of th ■
problem. If New York can bo
governed well, then tho problem
elsewhere is soluble.
Roekfeller is a successful
governor of New York, which
is to say that he has been tried
and proved and tempered in
the hottest fires of modernity.
The nomination and election of
Rockefeller would be a guar
antee to our people that the
essential problems of their
lives would be the main con
cern of the nation.
Rockefeller has been able to
be a successful governor not
only because of his well ordered
instincts and sympathies, but be
cause he has known whore to
find and how to recruit men of
the necessary ability. His family
interests and the wide ramifica
tions of their, good works have
brought him into contact with
the expertise which in our tech
nological and complex society is
indispensible to good manage

For these reasons I hope Nel

The United States can count
itself fortunate that in
unhappy times there is an elec-'
tion near at hand. For this opens
up the chance to begin to get a
grip on the events which are
at present out of human and
political control. There is no
other, way to begin unless the
voters choose a new president
with new advisers and a new
party alignment.
The conflicts within the na
tion about the war, the cities,
the economy and, the racism
cannot be healed unless the na
tion as a whole can look forward
to a new beginning. The nation
cannot thrash around for an
other five years in its entangle
ments.
The dominent fact of our time
is not that opinion is divided
and that there is strong opposi
tion to the Administration. That
is normal enough in a free coun
try. The dominant fact is the
crumbling of that binding con
fidence in the nation's purposes
and its future, which in normal
times may be taken for granted.
There is a disintegration of
the hope, which is the inner
genius of the American spir
it, that men can solve their
problems and that evils can be
overcome. Lyndon Johnson
has undermined this hope, and
he has driven a whole gen
eration of Americans into
open or implicit revolt against
their government and their
own society; he has Instilled
in the rest of the people a
sense of hopelessness and be
wilderment.
The best that his most re
spected apologists can say is
that they can think of nothing
else for him to do. Such nihilism
is not good enough. This nation
has the right to leaders who
mean to master its fate, not to
drift helplessly with it. Only
new leaders can correct the
sense of uselessness and help
lessness.
With the ins having gotten
us into trouble, the only thing
to do is to turn to the outs. Un
less Mr„ Johnson retires and
along with him his chief ad
visers, only a Republican Pres
ident can save the country
from its plight.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy cannot
replace Lyndon Johnson in the
White House. What that gallant
man is doing is to rally the
saving remnant of the Demo
crats in order to save the soul
of the Democratic Party. He
is saving its future. But for the
dangerous present the hope of
the country is that it can find
a Republican to replace Presi
dent Johnson.
The Republican Party does
not have a wide choice of
available and qualified candi
dates. There are in fact only
two such men: former Vice
President Richard Nixon and
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Gov.
George Romney has with
drawn; Gov. Ronaid —„T.n
does not have the experience
needed to be President of the
United States In this critical
age.
Nixon has had a long and

rich experience in national gov
ernment and in national politics,
and there is little doubt that as
time goes on he has matured
well. The Nixon of today is a
more preposessing candidate
than was the Nixon of 1960.
But we should note that he has
had no experience in the ad
ministration of local and region
al politics. Yet, that is where
the action is. That is where the
great problems arise.
Nixon's biggest liability is
that as an opponent of Mr. John
son he does not offer a choice,
but produces an echo. He is an
echo of the President on the
Vietnamese war and on our fu
ture in Asia. He opens up no
prospect of a better turn in this
grim situation.
In terms of election politics,
Nixon has an even greater liabil
ity. It is the same liability which
Lyndon Johnson has—the credi
bility gap, which is the polite
way of saying that the masses
of people do not much believe
or trust him.
In a contest with Mr. John
son, the country would be asked
to choose between two men who,
as Mr. Dooley once said of two
other political candidates, are as
far apart as the two poles (since
they argue about so many
things) and yet as much alike
as the two poles (since they
both are icy and barren)
It is not surprising that in
the White House Nixon Is
now the preferred Republican
candidate. If only Mr. Johnson

could run against Nixon for
President and Sen. Everett
Dirkson as leader of Con
gress, his dreams would be
fulfilled. He would be as sure
of re-election as any President

dangerous present the hope of
the country is that it can find
a Republican to replace Presi
dent Johnson.
The Republican Party does
not have a wide choice of
available and qualified candi
dates. There are in fact only
two such men: former Vice
President Richard Nixon and
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller. Gov.
George Romney has with
drawn; Gov. Ronaid —„T.n
does not have the experience
needed to be President of the
United States In this critical
age.
Nixon has had a long and

rich experience in national gov
ernment and in national politics,
and there is little doubt that as
time goes on he has matured
well. The Nixon of today is a
more preposessing candidate
than was the Nixon of 1960.
But we should note that he has
had no experience in the ad
ministration of local and region
al politics. Yet, that is where
the action is. That is where the
great problems arise.
Nixon's biggest liability is
that as an opponent of Mr. John
son he does not offer a choice,
but produces an echo. He is an
echo of the President on the
Vietnamese war and on our fu
ture in Asia. He opens up no
prospect of a better turn in this
grim situation.
In terms of election politics,
Nixon has an even greater liabil
ity. It is the same liability which
Lyndon Johnson has—the credi
bility gap, which is the polite
way of saying that the masses
of people do not much believe
or trust him.
In a contest with Mr. John
son, the country would be asked
to choose between two men who,
as Mr. Dooley once said of two
other political candidates, are as
far apart as the two poles (since
they argue about so many
things) and yet as much alike
as the two poles (since they
both are icy and barren)
It is not surprising that in
the White House Nixon Is
now the preferred Republican
candidate. If only Mr. Johnson

could run against Nixon for
President and Sen. Everett
Dirkson as leader of Con
gress, his dreams would be
fulfilled. He would be as sure
of re-election as any President
can be who is fighting a war
which he cannot win and
might lose.
Measured only in these elec
toral terms, the case for Rocke
feller is virtually unanswerable.
He is the one Republican who
has the best chance of winning
the election. For while Nixon is
the preferred choice of the reg
ular Republicans, they are a
minority party and can win an
election only when a great mass
of Democrats and independent
voters defect to them. No other
Republican can match Rockefel
ler's attraction for this strategic
mass of voters.
In this respect the Nixon-
Rockefeller situation resembles
the Taft-Eisenhower contest in
1952. Taft also was the pre
ferred choice of the regular Re
publicans. But it was not cer
tain that he could win the elec
tion. Gen. Eisenhower, who was
not really a Republican, had the
ace of trumps since it was
certain that he could win the
election.
That is why he was nomin
ated by the Republican politi
cians.
If Rockefeller is nominated at
Miami, it will be for the same
reason, that he, if anyone, can
win the election.
Rockefeller would not have

this ace of trumps if the rea
sons for making him Presi
dent were not intrinsically
solid and sound. I submit that
In the year 1968 the reasons
are compelling. For what the
country will be choosing is
not a war President who could
win the war. It will be choos
ing a President for the recon
struction in which the war
will be wound up and the
wounds healed and the dam
age repaired, the damage
which Is not only material
but moral and spiritual.
In one way or another the
Vietnamese war will either ex
pand and explode into a global
catastrophe, or a way will be
managed to close it down. I re
gard Nelson Rockefeller as the
most qualified man available
for this supreme task of recon
struction. I believe that Lyndon
Johnson has disqualified him
self.
For myself, I have never been
concerned about Rockefeller's
refusal to talk about Vietnam
or align himself as a Hawk or
a Dove. That is a politician's
tactic. I have never talked about
Vietnam with the governor, be
cause I feel the less he said the
freer he would be to commit him
self to the inevitable task of liq
uidating the war. I am sure that
he would have to liquidate the
war in order to be the kind of
President he can be and wishes
to be.
The central and critical fact
is that the Vietnamese war is a

monstrous diversion from thr>
true American problem, which
is not the policing of Asia but
the mastery of the human ad
justment to thn modern, urban,
highly technological society in
which most Americans live.
For the "rship of the coun
try in this great task Rockefel
ler is pre-eminently qualified.
New York is the vortex of th ■
problem. If New York can bo
governed well, then tho problem
elsewhere is soluble.
Roekfeller is a successful
governor of New York, which
is to say that he has been tried
and proved and tempered in
the hottest fires of modernity.
The nomination and election of
Rockefeller would be a guar
antee to our people that the
essential problems of their
lives would be the main con
cern of the nation.
Rockefeller has been able to
be a successful governor not
only because of his well ordered
instincts and sympathies, but be
cause he has known whore to
find and how to recruit men of
the necessary ability. His family
interests and the wide ramifica
tions of their, good works have
brought him into contact with
the expertise which in our tech
nological and complex society is
indispensible to good manage

For these reasons I hope Nel

The United States can count
itself fortunate that in
unhappy times there is an elec-'
tion near at hand. For this opens
up the chance to begin to get a
grip on the events which are
at present out of human and
political control. There is no
other, way to begin unless the
voters choose a new president
with new advisers and a new
party alignment.
The conflicts within the na
tion about the war, the cities,
the economy and, the racism
cannot be healed unless the na
tion as a whole can look forward
to a new beginning. The nation
cannot thrash around for an
other five years in its entangle
ments.
The dominent fact of our time
is not that opinion is divided
and that there is strong opposi
tion to the Administration. That
is normal enough in a free coun
try. The dominant fact is the
crumbling of that binding con
fidence in the nation's purposes
and its future, which in normal
times may be taken for granted.
There is a disintegration of
the hope, which is the inner
genius of the American spir
it, that men can solve their
problems and that evils can be
overcome. Lyndon Johnson
has undermined this hope, and
he has driven a whole gen
eration of Americans into
open or implicit revolt against
their government and their
own society; he has Instilled
in the rest of the people a
sense of hopelessness and be
wilderment.
The best that his most re
spected apologists can say is
that they can think of nothing
else for him to do. Such nihilism
is not good enough. This nation
has the right to leaders who
mean to master its fate, not to
drift helplessly with it. Only
new leaders can correct the
sense of uselessness and help
lessness.
With the ins having gotten
us into trouble, the only thing
to do is to turn to the outs. Un
less Mr„ Johnson retires and
along with him his chief ad
visers, only a Republican Pres
ident can save the country
from its plight.
Sen. Eugene McCarthy cannot
replace Lyndon Johnson in the
White House. What that gallant
man is doing is to rally the
saving remnant of the Demo
crats in order to save the soul
of the Democratic Party. He
is saving its future. But for the
dangerous present the hope of
the country is that it can find
