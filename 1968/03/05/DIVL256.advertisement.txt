"The thing I can't stand about
the Daily is the left-wing bias
in all their news stories..."
Then come write some stories for us with a right-wing bias. There is no political test for Daily mem
bership. Naturally we prefer stories with no bias at all.
If you're interested in ideas, work with them. Join the Daily staff spring quarter. Our last issue this
quarter is March 8, but we resume publication April 1. Drop in if you have questions. We want to expand
our news, photography and advertising staffs.
A meeting is planned for new staffers Friday at 5 p.m. in the Daily office in the Storke Publications
Building, Lomita Drive.
