# War On Poverty Blasted For Raising False Hopes
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Otis Chandler, publisher of
the Los Angeles Times, blasted
the Administration's poverty
program last night for raising
false hopes, but defended the
pronouncements on the Viet
nam war, saying we must judge
Washington "by what it does,
and not by what it says."
His Cubberley Auditorium
speech, "Can We Believe Wash
ington?", was the seventh an
nual Distinguished Alumnus
Lecture.
Chandler also said that the
press must become "a perma
nent and unaligned party or
force of opposition—truth
fully the critics of the nation's

affairs, truthfully a fourth
estate."
The press must bear the re
sponsibility of supplying the
public "the information essen
tial for reaching a reasoned con
clusion," he stated.
Chandler criticized the gov
ernment's domestic programs,
saying "it is deceitful, regard
less of how effective or neces
sary it may be politically, to
make promises that any intelli
gent economist knows cannot
be achieved within the implied
time period.
"It is inhumane and certainly
self-defeating," he continued,
"to hold out your hand to the
poor, to the disadvantaged, to
the have-nots — and then, at the

precise moment when their
hopes are aroused, to say, 'I'm
sorry, but we ran out — we
don't have any more.' "
Chandler called such action
"fraud of the most dangerous
kind—fraud that creates a credi
bility gap between Washington
and the people."
He said this causes "racial
violence, crime in the streets,
mass frustration, mistrust,
and, in the end, revolution by
the have-nots against the
haves."
While seriously criticizing the
Administration's approach to do
mestic problems, Chandler de
fended to some extent news man
agement on international affairs
—concealment of facts for na
tional security.
"I find it torturous ethics, and
totally irrational, to contend that
printing all you know is worth
the lives of thousands of Amer
icans."
In reference to the Cuban mis
sile crisis, when the building of
Russian missile bases on Cuba
was kept secret until revealed by
Sen. Kenneth Keating, he felt
the news management was jus
tified.
"Any disclosures in the press
about the marshaling of Amer
ican forces could have served
only to warn Soviet Russia, with
consequences that even now
seem terribly uncrtain — far
too uncertain to justify a puris
tic axiom of printing the whole
truth, any time, regardless of
what it causes to happen,"
Chandler said.
He also criticized many of the
anti-war demonstrators for a
lack of practicality and over
emotionalism.
"Peace will not be achieved

by throwing flowers or pray
ing that an enemy will be
merciful," ("handler asserted.
"Peace is achieved, when it is
achieved, by negotiating from
strength — and by the will and
the capacity to see distinctly,
without emotion.
"Emotion and peace are not
a likely combination — emotion,
we ought to know by now, com
bines far better with war," he
said.
Therefore, Chandler feels,
withholding facts from the press
is not as important as false
claims for domestic programs.
"The charge of a 'credibil
ity gap' between Washington
and the nation is heard far
less frequently in the realm of
domestic affairs, yet it is in
this realm, I think, that the
charge has greater validity,"
he said.
It is especially in this area,
Chandler claims, that the press
must act as the watchdog for
he public.
"Should we not question the
constant proposal of grandiose
domestic projects without ade
quate planning of how to oper
ate them," he said, "and with
out adequate safeguards against
political squandering and bur
eaucratic waste?
Chandler said the relative im
portance of Vietnam and domes
tic needs was a grave question.
"We have to, as a nation, re
assess our values and our posi
tion in the world, and see what
we can afford to do," he said.
"But if we continue spending
on Vietnam the amount we have
been, I don't think we will have
won anything."
The speech will be broadcast
tonight at 7 over KZSU.

OBSCENITY AND THE CONSTITUTION — Chicago Professor of Law Harry Kalven, Jr. addresses
twelve people in Tresidder's large lounge on the relatively new Supreme Court cases involving the
First Amendment and obscenity rulings.
"What the Court is really regulating is a form of sexual consumption. The ease against regulation
has nothing to do with free speech, but the right of people to perform certain forms of sexual ac
tivity," Kalven claimed.
