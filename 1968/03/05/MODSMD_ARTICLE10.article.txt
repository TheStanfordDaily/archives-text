# Boycott Classes April 11?
## 
### 
(The Daily editorial board is divided over the boycott of classes proposed by the ASSU legislature
as part of an April 11 protest against the draft and Vietnam war. Here are two opinions.)

• PRO Christopher Hargrove
It has been a little depressing to hear some
of the first reactions to the idea of a one-day anti
daft, anti-war demonstration, protest, strike, talk
in, teach-in, be-in, or whatever you care to call it.
It seems the only people who really favor the
idea our our died-in-the-wood radicals. For on
this one thing, liberal academicians and Young
Americans for Freedom appear united: a day
long demonstration and boycott of classes is,
at best, questionable.
They say it as attacking the wrong target, but
they miss the point. The war, not the university,
is the target. They say it would infringe on the
rights of students who want to go to classes
April 11. But how much would a student lose if
he missed two, three, or maybe four classes in
an academic quarter?
In exchange for this painless price, we might
hope to see some kind of unifying, drawing to
gether, of people opposed to the war. Surely that
is not too radical an aim.
A day of protest would be a day of speeches,
perhaps teach-ins, certainly some introspection.
It would be just jarring enough so that when we
walk through that day, we may remember we are
not going to classes because the war is still on
in Vietnam.
★ ★ ★
It is a measure of the shallowness of our con
cern that many of us should be more bothered
by the prospect of one day of minor disruption
than by what is happening in Vietnam.
If we want this war to end short of a nuclear
disaster, we must convince our leaders that that
is what we really want. Writing letters to our
congressmen will not do it. Sitting in at the in
duction center will not do it. Going about our
daily lives as if nothing bothersome were happen
ing in Vietnam will certainly not do it. Vowing
to vote against Johnson in November will not do
it. (What if Nixon runs against him?)
But this demonstration might help. If enough
people take part in it, if enough people interrupt
the normal flow of one day of their lives to
demonstrate their concern, perhaps our leaders
will begin to think seriously about ending the
war as soon as possible.
People still speak of the "good Germans" who
opposed the Nazis in principle but did nothing
to oppose them — in practice. Future generations
will bemoan, or despise, the "good Americans"
who opposed their government — in silence.

• CON Michael Sweeney
A student strike to protest the draft is so il
logical, petulant, and destructive a proposal that
it threatens to seriously weaken the April 11
demonstration.
Passion has so clouded the reason of student
leaders that they seem intent on throwing away
their one golden opportunity to unify students,
faculty and staff on a pressing political issue.
The military draft will take students out of
classrooms. It will disrupt faculty teaching. It
will attack the financial security of universities,
threatening directly administrative staff. Why
then protest the draft by "an organizational ef
fort to ask as many students, faculty and staff
, members to support this demonstration by not
'.going to classes and not working in offices"?
The April 11 demonstration can (1) involve
people at the University in anti-draft and anti
war activities, and (2) influence groups outside
the University through publicity. A boycott of
classes and offices hinders both efforts.
Faculty, students and staff are practically un
animous in their criticism of the present draft
law. Protest against that law would appeal to
those who otherwise might never venture de
fiance of government power. Radical groups
would have a priceless opportunity to reach
the normally apathetic majority.
But a boycott instantly alienates most stu
dents and practically all faculty and staff. It
would taint other protest activities and cut at
tendance at rallies. Instead of unifying tho Stan
ford community, a boycott would divide it.
The student strike would also weaken the im
pact of the demonstration on the general pub
lic. Instead of "Massive Draft Protest," the press
would speak of "Attempt to Shut Down Stan
ford University." The transparent illogic of an
anti-educational boycott would impair the effec
tiveness of arguments against the anti-educational
draft.
Apparently student radicals have made a
pathetic reflex reaction against authority. To a
majority of the legislature, Stanford's admini
stration is the Enemy. If anti-draft protest also
makes trouble for the Enemy, they feel, so much
the better. Actually Stanford administrators have
vociferously opposed the draft law.
Hopefully the legislature will unravel its con
fused plans. Afternoon speeches may conflict with
classes. A morning rally at Oakland Induction
Center may preclude 8 o'clock Civ. But missed
classes and empty desks should be regarded as
a cost of protest, not a goal.

Faculty, students and staff are practically un
animous in their criticism of the present draft
law. Protest against that law would appeal to
those who otherwise might never venture de
fiance of government power. Radical groups
would have a priceless opportunity to reach
the normally apathetic majority.
But a boycott instantly alienates most stu
dents and practically all faculty and staff. It
would taint other protest activities and cut at
tendance at rallies. Instead of unifying tho Stan
ford community, a boycott would divide it.
The student strike would also weaken the im
pact of the demonstration on the general pub
lic. Instead of "Massive Draft Protest," the press
would speak of "Attempt to Shut Down Stan
ford University." The transparent illogic of an
anti-educational boycott would impair the effec
tiveness of arguments against the anti-educational
draft.
Apparently student radicals have made a
pathetic reflex reaction against authority. To a
majority of the legislature, Stanford's admini
stration is the Enemy. If anti-draft protest also
makes trouble for the Enemy, they feel, so much
the better. Actually Stanford administrators have
vociferously opposed the draft law.
Hopefully the legislature will unravel its con
fused plans. Afternoon speeches may conflict with
classes. A morning rally at Oakland Induction
Center may preclude 8 o'clock Civ. But missed
classes and empty desks should be regarded as
a cost of protest, not a goal.

as part of an April 11 protest against the draft and Vietnam war. Here are two opinions.)

It has been a little depressing to hear some
of the first reactions to the idea of a one-day anti
daft, anti-war demonstration, protest, strike, talk
in, teach-in, be-in, or whatever you care to call it.
It seems the only people who really favor the
idea our our died-in-the-wood radicals. For on
this one thing, liberal academicians and Young
Americans for Freedom appear united: a day
long demonstration and boycott of classes is,
at best, questionable.
They say it as attacking the wrong target, but
they miss the point. The war, not the university,
is the target. They say it would infringe on the
rights of students who want to go to classes
April 11. But how much would a student lose if
he missed two, three, or maybe four classes in
an academic quarter?
In exchange for this painless price, we might
hope to see some kind of unifying, drawing to
gether, of people opposed to the war. Surely that
is not too radical an aim.
A day of protest would be a day of speeches,
perhaps teach-ins, certainly some introspection.
It would be just jarring enough so that when we
walk through that day, we may remember we are
not going to classes because the war is still on
in Vietnam.
★ ★ ★
It is a measure of the shallowness of our con
cern that many of us should be more bothered
by the prospect of one day of minor disruption
than by what is happening in Vietnam.
If we want this war to end short of a nuclear
disaster, we must convince our leaders that that
is what we really want. Writing letters to our
congressmen will not do it. Sitting in at the in
duction center will not do it. Going about our
daily lives as if nothing bothersome were happen
ing in Vietnam will certainly not do it. Vowing
to vote against Johnson in November will not do
it. (What if Nixon runs against him?)
But this demonstration might help. If enough
people take part in it, if enough people interrupt
the normal flow of one day of their lives to
demonstrate their concern, perhaps our leaders
will begin to think seriously about ending the
war as soon as possible.
People still speak of the "good Germans" who
opposed the Nazis in principle but did nothing
to oppose them — in practice. Future generations
will bemoan, or despise, the "good Americans"
who opposed their government — in silence.

A student strike to protest the draft is so il
logical, petulant, and destructive a proposal that
it threatens to seriously weaken the April 11
demonstration.
Passion has so clouded the reason of student
leaders that they seem intent on throwing away
their one golden opportunity to unify students,
faculty and staff on a pressing political issue.
The military draft will take students out of
classrooms. It will disrupt faculty teaching. It
will attack the financial security of universities,
threatening directly administrative staff. Why
then protest the draft by "an organizational ef
fort to ask as many students, faculty and staff
, members to support this demonstration by not
'.going to classes and not working in offices"?

But this demonstration might help. If enough
people take part in it, if enough people interrupt
the normal flow of one day of their lives to
demonstrate their concern, perhaps our leaders
will begin to think seriously about ending the
war as soon as possible.
People still speak of the "good Germans" who
opposed the Nazis in principle but did nothing
to oppose them — in practice. Future generations
will bemoan, or despise, the "good Americans"
who opposed their government — in silence.

A student strike to protest the draft is so il
logical, petulant, and destructive a proposal that
it threatens to seriously weaken the April 11
demonstration.
Passion has so clouded the reason of student
leaders that they seem intent on throwing away
their one golden opportunity to unify students,
faculty and staff on a pressing political issue.
The military draft will take students out of
classrooms. It will disrupt faculty teaching. It
will attack the financial security of universities,
threatening directly administrative staff. Why
then protest the draft by "an organizational ef
fort to ask as many students, faculty and staff
, members to support this demonstration by not
'.going to classes and not working in offices"?
The April 11 demonstration can (1) involve
people at the University in anti-draft and anti
war activities, and (2) influence groups outside
the University through publicity. A boycott of
classes and offices hinders both efforts.
Faculty, students and staff are practically un
animous in their criticism of the present draft
law. Protest against that law would appeal to
those who otherwise might never venture de
fiance of government power. Radical groups
would have a priceless opportunity to reach
the normally apathetic majority.
But a boycott instantly alienates most stu
dents and practically all faculty and staff. It
would taint other protest activities and cut at
tendance at rallies. Instead of unifying tho Stan
ford community, a boycott would divide it.
The student strike would also weaken the im
pact of the demonstration on the general pub
lic. Instead of "Massive Draft Protest," the press
would speak of "Attempt to Shut Down Stan
ford University." The transparent illogic of an
anti-educational boycott would impair the effec
tiveness of arguments against the anti-educational
draft.
Apparently student radicals have made a
pathetic reflex reaction against authority. To a
majority of the legislature, Stanford's admini
stration is the Enemy. If anti-draft protest also
makes trouble for the Enemy, they feel, so much
the better. Actually Stanford administrators have
vociferously opposed the draft law.
Hopefully the legislature will unravel its con
fused plans. Afternoon speeches may conflict with
classes. A morning rally at Oakland Induction
Center may preclude 8 o'clock Civ. But missed
classes and empty desks should be regarded as
a cost of protest, not a goal.
(The Daily editorial board is divided over the boycott of classes proposed by the ASSU legislature
as part of an April 11 protest against the draft and Vietnam war. Here are two opinions.)

It has been a little depressing to hear some
of the first reactions to the idea of a one-day anti
daft, anti-war demonstration, protest, strike, talk
in, teach-in, be-in, or whatever you care to call it.
It seems the only people who really favor the
idea our our died-in-the-wood radicals. For on
this one thing, liberal academicians and Young
Americans for Freedom appear united: a day
long demonstration and boycott of classes is,
at best, questionable.
They say it as attacking the wrong target, but
they miss the point. The war, not the university,
is the target. They say it would infringe on the
rights of students who want to go to classes
April 11. But how much would a student lose if
he missed two, three, or maybe four classes in
an academic quarter?
In exchange for this painless price, we might
hope to see some kind of unifying, drawing to
gether, of people opposed to the war. Surely that
is not too radical an aim.
A day of protest would be a day of speeches,
perhaps teach-ins, certainly some introspection.
It would be just jarring enough so that when we
walk through that day, we may remember we are
not going to classes because the war is still on
in Vietnam.

It is a measure of the shallowness of our con
cern that many of us should be more bothered
by the prospect of one day of minor disruption
than by what is happening in Vietnam.
If we want this war to end short of a nuclear
disaster, we must convince our leaders that that
is what we really want. Writing letters to our
congressmen will not do it. Sitting in at the in
duction center will not do it. Going about our
daily lives as if nothing bothersome were happen
ing in Vietnam will certainly not do it. Vowing
to vote against Johnson in November will not do
it. (What if Nixon runs against him?)
But this demonstration might help. If enough
people take part in it, if enough people interrupt
the normal flow of one day of their lives to
demonstrate their concern, perhaps our leaders
