# Three Students Get Short Story Prize
## 
### 
Three Stanford students have
been selected as winners by the
STORY College C r e a ti v e
Awards contest in its first na
tion-wide creative writing com
petition.
The editors of STORY, which
Is a collection of short, prize
winning literary pieces, award
ed prizes to Louis Logan, Bar
bara Savery, and David B.
Jones.
Logan, who won a Wallace
Stegner Creative Writing Fel
lowship to Stanford in 1966, won
second prize in the short story
category for his entry, "The
Bill Collector."
Jones, a graduate student
working for his master's de
gree in broadcasting and film,
won first prize for his motion
picture script, Neither Here Nor
There. The script is based on a
Franz Kafka sketch about an
ape on a university campus.
Miss Savery received first
prize in the essay form cate
gory for her treatment of Black
Power entitled "Pilgrimage to
Mecca."
Thirty-nine winners of the

1967-68 Awards will appear in
STORY: The Yearbook of Dis
covery/1968, a paperback which
is edited by the Burnetts. It
contains what reviewers have
called "the best short reading of
the season."
Editors of STORY, Whit and
Hallie Burnett, have been pub
lishing both works of campus
and big-name writers for more
than 25 years in the magazine.
They first published Tennessee
Williams when he was virtually
unknown, and subsequently
published three other novice
authors, Norman Mailer, Tru
man Capote, and J.D. Salinger.
Ivy League schools of the
East failed to run away with the
prizes. The editors of STORY
say that the center of creative
writing in the colleges seems
to have shifted to the West
Coast. California had more en
tries and prize winners in all
categories than any other state.
This year's judges included:
poets Marianne Moore and Rich
ard Eberhart, biographer and
critic J. Donald Adams, and
screen writer Tad Mosel.
