# McCloskey Urges Limits On Johnson
## 
### 
Congressman Paul N. McClos
key will urge adoption of a Con
gressional resolution demanding
that President Johnson receive
Congressional approval before
further escalating the Vietnam
war.
The San Mateo County Repub
lican said yesterday"the Con
stitution protects the people
against an improper executive
action by placing the powers of
deciding and financing war on
those representatives closest to
the people â€” the Congress."
He said, however, that "the
President is determining policy,
forcing the Congress to finance
that policy by supplemental
appropriations.
No Congressman is about to
deny proper support to our sol
diers, so the cycle goes on with
the President leading a head
long rush toward a larger war
effort."
McCloskey called for a "Con

gressional ne-evaluation of our
present policies in Vietnam be
fore the President further acts
on his announced intention to
send to Vietnam 'whatever
troops may be necessary.' "
