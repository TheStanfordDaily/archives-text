# NSA Cuts Car Prices In Europe
## 
### 
Under a new travel grant pro
gram, the National Student As
sociation (NSA) will give uni
versity students, teachers and
administrators $150 toward the
purchase of a new Roils Royce
while they travel abroad.
The program, however, ap
plies to more than Rolls Royces.
In fact, it offers 10 per cent dis
counts for students and profes
sors who buy, lease or rent most
makes of cars in Europe and
Japan.
Organized by Educational
Travel, Inc., the travel division
of NSA, these grants range
from $10 on motor scooters and
motorcycles to a $150 grant on
a $15,707 Rolls Royce Silver
Shadow 4-door sedan.
Grants are based upon the
official manufacturers' tax-free
European prices, making pur
chase much less expensive in
Europe than in the United
States. NSA also handles insur
ance, home shipment and handl
ing charges on cars purchased.
Grants, also of 10 percent, are
available as well toward time
and milage charges on cars
rented abroad through NSA.
The complete car rental pro
gram is available from 133 loca
tions in 16 European nations
and 21 locations in Japan. Cars
may be rented either locally or
on a one-way basis.


THE SUDDEN MUD, a newly-formed band, composed of four Santa
Clara students will enliven the Stanford Repertory's production of
Sean O'Casey's colorful play, "Cock-A-Doodle Dandy," opening to
morrow.
