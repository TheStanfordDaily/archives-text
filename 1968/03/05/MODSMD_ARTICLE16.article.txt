# California Is No. 1 In Draft Dodgers
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Cali :
fornia far outstrips any other
state in the number of convicted
draft dodgers as draft law viola
tions continue to mount nation
ally.
A state-by-state breakdown of
convictions made public Satur
day by the Justice Department
showed 789 convictions in the
United States in the year that
ended last June 3, with 170—23

per cent—in California alone.
It underscored a buildup in
the number of draft-law viola
tions and more intensive investi
gative activities by the Justice
Department and the Selective
Service System.
Greater Response
Signs of the increased govern
ment response included.
—The head of the Justice De
partment team that obtained

the indictmenst of Dr. Benjamin
Spoek and four others on
charges of conspiracy to counsel
draft evasion said the group is
investigating every major anti
draft demonstration in which it
is suspected there may be viola
tions of federal law.
—The Selective Service Sys
tem is recalling to active duty
several reserve officers who are
lawyers to help handle the bur
geoning number of draft law
violation cases, a result of high
er draft calls.
The Justice Department's
computer listed 1,424 draft
cases filed during the fiscal
year that ended last June 30 —
the latest figures available.
There were 789 convictions.
New York, although the sec
ond largest state, had fewer
convictions — 37 — than three
smaller states: Ohio, had 48,
Oregon 46 and Florida 39.
Justice Department officials
were uncertain why California
led the list but attributed it
partly to California's large
youthful population, its many
college students, and its sizable
transient population.
Judges are handing out stiffer
sentences. The average sen
tence last year was 32.1 months.
This compared with 26.4 months
in 1966 and 21 months in 1965.

The latest Justice Department
list also shows 174 cases dis
missed. One official who works
closely with Selective Service
cases estimated more than 90
per cent of dismissals result
from individuals deciding to
comply with the law and accept
induction into the armed forces
after they are faced with indict
ment and the prospect of going
to trial.
Most government cases
against persons charged with
violating Selective Service laws
are handled locally by U.S. at
torneys. The tougher ones are
reviewed at department head
quarters in Washington by two
units that deal with draft cases.
Nearly three months ago the
department set up a special unit
on Selective Service cases head
ed by John Van de Kamp.

This unit handles mainly the
biggest cases dealing with indi
viduals who counsel others to
avoid the draft. It works closely
with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, evaluates intelli
gence on organized draft resis
tance and on other antidraft ac
tivities.
"We've had investigations of
just about every demonstration
that's involved allegedly illegal
federal activity over the past
six months," Van de Kamp told
an inetrviewer.
He declined to comment on
the number of investigations on
which his unit is working, but
pointed out a desk top filing
cabinet nearly filled with cards
containing names of individuals
who had participated in anti
draft activities.

Justice Department officials
were uncertain why California
led the list but attributed it
partly to California's large
youthful population, its many
college students, and its sizable
transient population.
Judges are handing out stiffer
sentences. The average sen
tence last year was 32.1 months.
This compared with 26.4 months
in 1966 and 21 months in 1965.

The latest Justice Department
list also shows 174 cases dis
missed. One official who works
closely with Selective Service
cases estimated more than 90
per cent of dismissals result
from individuals deciding to
comply with the law and accept
induction into the armed forces
after they are faced with indict
ment and the prospect of going
to trial.
Most government cases
against persons charged with
violating Selective Service laws
are handled locally by U.S. at
torneys. The tougher ones are
reviewed at department head
quarters in Washington by two
units that deal with draft cases.
Nearly three months ago the
department set up a special unit
on Selective Service cases head
ed by John Van de Kamp.

This unit handles mainly the
biggest cases dealing with indi
viduals who counsel others to
avoid the draft. It works closely
with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, evaluates intelli
gence on organized draft resis
tance and on other antidraft ac
tivities.
"We've had investigations of
just about every demonstration
that's involved allegedly illegal
federal activity over the past
six months," Van de Kamp told
an inetrviewer.
He declined to comment on
the number of investigations on
which his unit is working, but
pointed out a desk top filing
cabinet nearly filled with cards
containing names of individuals
who had participated in anti
draft activities.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Cali :
fornia far outstrips any other
state in the number of convicted
draft dodgers as draft law viola
tions continue to mount nation
ally.
A state-by-state breakdown of
convictions made public Satur
day by the Justice Department
showed 789 convictions in the
United States in the year that
ended last June 3, with 170—23

per cent—in California alone.
It underscored a buildup in
the number of draft-law viola
tions and more intensive investi
gative activities by the Justice
Department and the Selective
Service System.
Greater Response
Signs of the increased govern
ment response included.
—The head of the Justice De
partment team that obtained

the indictmenst of Dr. Benjamin
Spoek and four others on
charges of conspiracy to counsel
draft evasion said the group is
investigating every major anti
draft demonstration in which it
is suspected there may be viola
tions of federal law.
—The Selective Service Sys
tem is recalling to active duty
several reserve officers who are
lawyers to help handle the bur
geoning number of draft law
violation cases, a result of high
er draft calls.
The Justice Department's
computer listed 1,424 draft
cases filed during the fiscal
year that ended last June 30 —
the latest figures available.
There were 789 convictions.
New York, although the sec
ond largest state, had fewer
convictions — 37 — than three
smaller states: Ohio, had 48,
Oregon 46 and Florida 39.
