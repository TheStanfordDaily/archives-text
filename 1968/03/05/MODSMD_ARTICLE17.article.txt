# Draft Counselors To Get ACLU Aid
## 
### 
The American Civil Liberties
Union, in a sharp reversal of
policy, voted to offer legal help
to persons accused of counseling
draft evasion.
The reversal followed heated
debate at a meeting of the na
tional board in New York over
an earlier decision on Jan. 12
not to support the defense of
Dr. Benjamin Spock, pediatrici
an, author, and outspoken war
critic, who is under Federal in
dictment.
At the earlier meeting "an
guished outcries" went up from
some of the ACLU's largest
chapters after the decision not
to support Spock was made.
At that time the national
board had decided not to involve
the ACLU in draft cases be
cause it was felt defense law
yers might raise questions of
the legality and morality of the
Vietnam war. The ACLU has
not taken a stand on such ques
tions.
At the meeting in January it
was decided to act only as a

friend of the court and submit
briefs limited to questions of
free speech.
The minutes of the meeting
state that "several members of
the board argued it would be
intolerable for the union to
authorize a direct defense, which
goes beyond formal ACLU pol
icy, merely because this is seen
as important by the defendant."
Following the meeting pro
tests from chapters around the
country began to flow in. Two
weeks ago the controversy deep
ened when the national board
released a formal position paper
on civil disobedience that said
the union would not defend per
sons who refused to register for
military service in protest
against the war or the draft.
John de J. Pemberton Jr., ex
ecutive director of ACLU, said
an affirmative vote followed the
amendment that stated the or
ganization takes no position re
garding the legaliy or conduct
of the war.
