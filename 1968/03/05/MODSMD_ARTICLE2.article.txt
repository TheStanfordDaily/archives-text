# Course Ratings Meet Opposition
## Book To Rate Courses, Teachers 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Plans are underway for a
complete evaluation of General
Studies courses and individual
departments and teachers. But
the program has already en
countered opposition.
Organizers of a course evalu
ation booklet have completed a
pilot study of several courses
and are readying a revised
questionnaire for distribution to
all General Studies courses.
The project quickly ran into
a snag, however, when approval
of a review of the entire Fresh
men English pi jgram was with
held by program Director Rob
ert Polhemus.
Polhemus was asked by the
course evaluation project origin
ator Skip Tammany if he would
permit distribution and comple
tion of the questionnaires in
each Freshmen English section.
Polhemus refused to give blan
ket permission for the study.
Polhemus told the DAILY
that he "won't make decisions
for all of my teachers. I don't
believe it proper that ques
tionnaires be filled out in class
time.
"I don't believe in question
naires basically," he explained.
"They tend to demand certain
answers and don't go very deep.
Informal feedback is the best
way to do it; you can't evaluate
education in scientifically meas
urable terms.
"Even if it was a good evalu
ation, I don't think the class
room is the proper place. Stu
dents should do it on their own
time if they are interested," he
added.
Polhemus suggested to Tam
many that the questionnaires be

distributed to each freshman as
he leaves class, that the course
review committee gain permis
sion of each teaching assistant
(TA) for distribution and com
pletion of the questionnaires in
class, or that they go out
through living groups.
Tammany noted that any of
these alternatives would be
"considerably more difficult." He
indicated that his group began
distribution of the question
naires to individual dormitories
yesterday but that it will be
"a hell of a lot of trouble" and
will hold up their study for
"quite some time."
Tammany claimed that Pol
hemus' refusal to handle the
survey through his office In
dicated that Polhemus "was
afraid that if his program
was shown to be bad, it would
reflect on him." He termed
Polhemus's reasons "lame ex
cuses."
He asserted that a review of
Freshman English would be
beneficial for several reasons.
First, the course, along with
Western Civ, is the most basic
General Studies course and de
serves a comprehensive review.
Second, Tammany claims the
results would benefit the En
glish department in evaluating
their program, the Study of Ed
ucation at Stanford in their stu
dies of General Studies and un
dergraduate education, and the
class itself which could profit
by examining its progress.
Third, Tammany sees this in
volvement of the entire fresh
man class in course evaluation
as a "valuable experience" for
them.
He added that "most pro
fessors are looking for feed
back like this and most have
been quite cooperative."
The projected study of Fresh
man English is the first in the
series of investigations of all
major general studies courses.
"We'll go on to Civ next and
then the other General Studies
courses in the middle of next
quarter," Tammany noted.
He also plans to query large
number's of juniors and seniors
in all departments in order to
evaluate the major program in
each department and its teach
ers.

The preliminary study just
completed turned up two in
teresting trends, according to
Tammany: first, the most fre
quent negative comment dealt
with lack of motivation in
herent in the lecture form of
teaching. And second, the
Courses and Degrees cata
logue was called inaccurate
and misleading.
He feels the results from the
questionnaire show that "it's
hard to give three or five lec
tures a week for ten weeks and
keep them informative and in
teresting."
On the subject of the Courses
and Degrees book, Tammany ex
plained that up to 50 per cent
of those polled so far "are
skeptical of its truthfulness."
Most students, he claimed, no
longer look at its course descrip
tions.
The committee suggested a
complete rewriting of the cata
logue.
The pilot study included in
vestigations of Mathematics 42a
(Calculus), taught by Mary
Sunseri; Philip Rhinelander's
Philosophy 6a (Good and Evil);
Psychology 1, taught this quar
ter by Ernest Hilgard; and Com
munication 141, a course on
film led by Henry Breitrose.
Students gave Good and
Evil the top rating of the four,
with 4.0 on a spoint scale.
Calculus received a grade of
3.45 overall, while both Psy
chology 1 and the film course
averaged out at 3.29.
The committee's report on
Good and Evil said the course
"is praised by most as an oppor
tunity for students to think for
themselves about problems of
good and evil, and to see the
relevance of past philosophical
writings to present problems;
a chance to make a "definition
of personal morals."
Students applauded Rhinelan
der's clarity of approach, al
though he was heavily criticized
for being repetitious.
Thirty-six per cent of Miss
Sunseri's Calculus class would
not take the course again be
cause it takes too much time,
even though they found Miss
Sunseri "an excellent teacher."
The report states that "she gives

clear explanations, is friendly
and enthusiastic but tends to
talk much too fast at times."
On Psychology 1, the commit
tee reported that "students are
generally happy with Hilgard's
ability to explain theories clear
ly," although they find his lec
tures "quite dry and slightly
better than boring."
One student categorized the
course as "a broad introduction
to psychology, cramming lots of
facts (rotely memorized) and
terminology into a short period
of time."
The committee suggested that
"with the addition of more dis

cussion in class and in groups
the course can be made better."
The results of the entire
study will be published as the
1968 Course Evaluation Re
view as a supplement to the
DAILY in the spring and
mailed to incoming freshmen
over the summer.
The study is financed by the
student legislature and is oper
ating under the Academic Af
fairs Committee of the ASSU.
For this year's study, "Com
puters are being used for the
first time in order to cover as
many courses as possible," Tam
many reported.

writings to present problems;
a chance to make a "definition

Students applauded Rhinelan
der's clarity of approach, al
though he was heavily criticized
for being repetitious.
Thirty-six per cent of Miss
Sunseri's Calculus class would
not take the course again be
cause it takes too much time,
even though they found Miss
Sunseri "an excellent teacher."
The report states that "she gives

clear explanations, is friendly
and enthusiastic but tends to
talk much too fast at times."
On Psychology 1, the commit
tee reported that "students are
generally happy with Hilgard's
ability to explain theories clear
ly," although they find his lec
tures "quite dry and slightly
better than boring."
One student categorized the
course as "a broad introduction
to psychology, cramming lots of
facts (rotely memorized) and
terminology into a short period
of time."
The committee suggested that
"with the addition of more dis

cussion in class and in groups
the course can be made better."
The results of the entire
study will be published as the
1968 Course Evaluation Re
view as a supplement to the
DAILY in the spring and
mailed to incoming freshmen
over the summer.
The study is financed by the
student legislature and is oper
ating under the Academic Af
fairs Committee of the ASSU.
For this year's study, "Com
puters are being used for the
first time in order to cover as
many courses as possible," Tam
many reported.
Plans are underway for a
complete evaluation of General
Studies courses and individual
departments and teachers. But
the program has already en
countered opposition.
Organizers of a course evalu
ation booklet have completed a
pilot study of several courses
and are readying a revised
questionnaire for distribution to
all General Studies courses.
The project quickly ran into
a snag, however, when approval
of a review of the entire Fresh
men English pi jgram was with
held by program Director Rob
ert Polhemus.
Polhemus was asked by the
course evaluation project origin
ator Skip Tammany if he would
permit distribution and comple
tion of the questionnaires in
each Freshmen English section.
Polhemus refused to give blan
ket permission for the study.
Polhemus told the DAILY
that he "won't make decisions
for all of my teachers. I don't
believe it proper that ques
tionnaires be filled out in class
time.
"I don't believe in question
naires basically," he explained.
"They tend to demand certain
answers and don't go very deep.
Informal feedback is the best
way to do it; you can't evaluate
education in scientifically meas
urable terms.
"Even if it was a good evalu
ation, I don't think the class
room is the proper place. Stu
dents should do it on their own
time if they are interested," he
added.
Polhemus suggested to Tam
many that the questionnaires be

distributed to each freshman as
he leaves class, that the course
review committee gain permis
sion of each teaching assistant
(TA) for distribution and com
pletion of the questionnaires in
class, or that they go out
through living groups.
Tammany noted that any of
these alternatives would be
"considerably more difficult." He
indicated that his group began
distribution of the question
naires to individual dormitories
yesterday but that it will be
"a hell of a lot of trouble" and
will hold up their study for
"quite some time."
Tammany claimed that Pol
hemus' refusal to handle the
survey through his office In
dicated that Polhemus "was
afraid that if his program
was shown to be bad, it would
reflect on him." He termed
Polhemus's reasons "lame ex
cuses."
He asserted that a review of
Freshman English would be
beneficial for several reasons.
First, the course, along with
Western Civ, is the most basic
General Studies course and de
serves a comprehensive review.
Second, Tammany claims the
results would benefit the En
glish department in evaluating
their program, the Study of Ed
ucation at Stanford in their stu
dies of General Studies and un
dergraduate education, and the
class itself which could profit
by examining its progress.
Third, Tammany sees this in
volvement of the entire fresh
man class in course evaluation
as a "valuable experience" for
them.
He added that "most pro
fessors are looking for feed
back like this and most have
been quite cooperative."
The projected study of Fresh
man English is the first in the
series of investigations of all
major general studies courses.
"We'll go on to Civ next and
then the other General Studies
courses in the middle of next
quarter," Tammany noted.
He also plans to query large
number's of juniors and seniors
in all departments in order to
evaluate the major program in
each department and its teach
ers.

The preliminary study just
completed turned up two in
teresting trends, according to
Tammany: first, the most fre
quent negative comment dealt
with lack of motivation in
herent in the lecture form of
teaching. And second, the
Courses and Degrees cata
logue was called inaccurate
and misleading.
He feels the results from the
questionnaire show that "it's
hard to give three or five lec
tures a week for ten weeks and
keep them informative and in
teresting."
On the subject of the Courses
and Degrees book, Tammany ex
plained that up to 50 per cent
of those polled so far "are
skeptical of its truthfulness."
Most students, he claimed, no
longer look at its course descrip
tions.
The committee suggested a
complete rewriting of the cata
logue.
The pilot study included in
vestigations of Mathematics 42a
(Calculus), taught by Mary
Sunseri; Philip Rhinelander's
Philosophy 6a (Good and Evil);
Psychology 1, taught this quar
ter by Ernest Hilgard; and Com
munication 141, a course on
film led by Henry Breitrose.
Students gave Good and
Evil the top rating of the four,
with 4.0 on a spoint scale.
Calculus received a grade of
3.45 overall, while both Psy
chology 1 and the film course
averaged out at 3.29.
The committee's report on
Good and Evil said the course
"is praised by most as an oppor
tunity for students to think for
themselves about problems of
good and evil, and to see the
relevance of past philosophical
writings to present problems;
a chance to make a "definition
of personal morals."

herent in the lecture form of
teaching. And second, the
Courses and Degrees cata
logue was called inaccurate
and misleading.
He feels the results from the
questionnaire show that "it's
hard to give three or five lec
tures a week for ten weeks and
keep them informative and in
teresting."
On the subject of the Courses
and Degrees book, Tammany ex
plained that up to 50 per cent
of those polled so far "are
skeptical of its truthfulness."
Most students, he claimed, no
longer look at its course descrip
tions.
The committee suggested a
complete rewriting of the cata
logue.
The pilot study included in
vestigations of Mathematics 42a
(Calculus), taught by Mary
Sunseri; Philip Rhinelander's
Philosophy 6a (Good and Evil);
Psychology 1, taught this quar
ter by Ernest Hilgard; and Com
munication 141, a course on
film led by Henry Breitrose.
Students gave Good and
Evil the top rating of the four,
with 4.0 on a spoint scale.
Calculus received a grade of
3.45 overall, while both Psy
chology 1 and the film course
averaged out at 3.29.
The committee's report on
Good and Evil said the course
"is praised by most as an oppor
tunity for students to think for
themselves about problems of
good and evil, and to see the
relevance of past philosophical
writings to present problems;
a chance to make a "definition
of personal morals."
Students applauded Rhinelan
der's clarity of approach, al
though he was heavily criticized
for being repetitious.
Thirty-six per cent of Miss
Sunseri's Calculus class would
not take the course again be
cause it takes too much time,
even though they found Miss
Sunseri "an excellent teacher."
The report states that "she gives

clear explanations, is friendly
and enthusiastic but tends to
talk much too fast at times."
On Psychology 1, the commit
tee reported that "students are
generally happy with Hilgard's
ability to explain theories clear
ly," although they find his lec
tures "quite dry and slightly
better than boring."
One student categorized the
course as "a broad introduction
to psychology, cramming lots of
facts (rotely memorized) and
terminology into a short period
of time."
The committee suggested that
"with the addition of more dis

cussion in class and in groups
the course can be made better."
The results of the entire
study will be published as the
1968 Course Evaluation Re
view as a supplement to the
DAILY in the spring and
mailed to incoming freshmen
over the summer.
The study is financed by the
student legislature and is oper
ating under the Academic Af
fairs Committee of the ASSU.
For this year's study, "Com
puters are being used for the
first time in order to cover as
many courses as possible," Tam
many reported.
Plans are underway for a
complete evaluation of General
Studies courses and individual
departments and teachers. But
the program has already en
countered opposition.
Organizers of a course evalu
ation booklet have completed a
pilot study of several courses
and are readying a revised
questionnaire for distribution to
all General Studies courses.
The project quickly ran into
a snag, however, when approval
of a review of the entire Fresh
men English pi jgram was with
held by program Director Rob
ert Polhemus.
Polhemus was asked by the
course evaluation project origin
ator Skip Tammany if he would
permit distribution and comple
tion of the questionnaires in
each Freshmen English section.
Polhemus refused to give blan
ket permission for the study.
Polhemus told the DAILY
that he "won't make decisions
for all of my teachers. I don't
believe it proper that ques
tionnaires be filled out in class
time.
"I don't believe in question
naires basically," he explained.
"They tend to demand certain
answers and don't go very deep.
Informal feedback is the best
way to do it; you can't evaluate
education in scientifically meas
urable terms.
"Even if it was a good evalu
ation, I don't think the class
room is the proper place. Stu
dents should do it on their own
time if they are interested," he
added.
Polhemus suggested to Tam
many that the questionnaires be

distributed to each freshman as
he leaves class, that the course
review committee gain permis
sion of each teaching assistant
(TA) for distribution and com
pletion of the questionnaires in
class, or that they go out
through living groups.
Tammany noted that any of
these alternatives would be
"considerably more difficult." He
indicated that his group began
distribution of the question
naires to individual dormitories
yesterday but that it will be
"a hell of a lot of trouble" and
will hold up their study for
"quite some time."
Tammany claimed that Pol
hemus' refusal to handle the
survey through his office In
dicated that Polhemus "was
afraid that if his program
was shown to be bad, it would
reflect on him." He termed
Polhemus's reasons "lame ex
cuses."
He asserted that a review of
Freshman English would be
beneficial for several reasons.
First, the course, along with
Western Civ, is the most basic
General Studies course and de
serves a comprehensive review.
Second, Tammany claims the
results would benefit the En
glish department in evaluating
their program, the Study of Ed
ucation at Stanford in their stu
dies of General Studies and un
dergraduate education, and the
class itself which could profit
by examining its progress.
Third, Tammany sees this in
volvement of the entire fresh
man class in course evaluation
as a "valuable experience" for
them.
He added that "most pro
fessors are looking for feed
back like this and most have
been quite cooperative."
The projected study of Fresh
man English is the first in the
series of investigations of all
major general studies courses.
"We'll go on to Civ next and
then the other General Studies
courses in the middle of next
quarter," Tammany noted.
He also plans to query large
number's of juniors and seniors
in all departments in order to
evaluate the major program in
each department and its teach
ers.

The preliminary study just
completed turned up two in
teresting trends, according to
Tammany: first, the most fre
quent negative comment dealt
with lack of motivation in
herent in the lecture form of
teaching. And second, the
Courses and Degrees cata
logue was called inaccurate
and misleading.

afraid that if his program
was shown to be bad, it would
reflect on him." He termed
Polhemus's reasons "lame ex
cuses."
He asserted that a review of
Freshman English would be
beneficial for several reasons.
First, the course, along with
Western Civ, is the most basic
General Studies course and de
serves a comprehensive review.
Second, Tammany claims the
results would benefit the En
glish department in evaluating
their program, the Study of Ed
ucation at Stanford in their stu
dies of General Studies and un
dergraduate education, and the
class itself which could profit
by examining its progress.
Third, Tammany sees this in
volvement of the entire fresh
man class in course evaluation
as a "valuable experience" for
them.
He added that "most pro
fessors are looking for feed
back like this and most have
been quite cooperative."
The projected study of Fresh
man English is the first in the
series of investigations of all
major general studies courses.
"We'll go on to Civ next and
then the other General Studies
courses in the middle of next
quarter," Tammany noted.
He also plans to query large
number's of juniors and seniors
in all departments in order to
evaluate the major program in
each department and its teach
ers.

The preliminary study just
completed turned up two in
teresting trends, according to
Tammany: first, the most fre
quent negative comment dealt
with lack of motivation in
herent in the lecture form of
teaching. And second, the
Courses and Degrees cata
logue was called inaccurate
and misleading.
He feels the results from the
questionnaire show that "it's
hard to give three or five lec
tures a week for ten weeks and
keep them informative and in
teresting."
On the subject of the Courses
and Degrees book, Tammany ex
plained that up to 50 per cent
of those polled so far "are
skeptical of its truthfulness."
Most students, he claimed, no
longer look at its course descrip
tions.
The committee suggested a
complete rewriting of the cata
logue.
The pilot study included in
vestigations of Mathematics 42a
(Calculus), taught by Mary
Sunseri; Philip Rhinelander's
Philosophy 6a (Good and Evil);
Psychology 1, taught this quar
ter by Ernest Hilgard; and Com
munication 141, a course on
film led by Henry Breitrose.
Students gave Good and
Evil the top rating of the four,
with 4.0 on a spoint scale.
Calculus received a grade of
3.45 overall, while both Psy
chology 1 and the film course
averaged out at 3.29.
The committee's report on
Good and Evil said the course
"is praised by most as an oppor
tunity for students to think for
themselves about problems of
good and evil, and to see the
relevance of past philosophical
writings to present problems;
a chance to make a "definition
of personal morals."
Students applauded Rhinelan
der's clarity of approach, al
though he was heavily criticized
for being repetitious.
Thirty-six per cent of Miss
Sunseri's Calculus class would
not take the course again be
cause it takes too much time,
even though they found Miss
Sunseri "an excellent teacher."
The report states that "she gives

clear explanations, is friendly
and enthusiastic but tends to
talk much too fast at times."
On Psychology 1, the commit
tee reported that "students are
generally happy with Hilgard's
ability to explain theories clear
ly," although they find his lec
tures "quite dry and slightly
better than boring."
One student categorized the
course as "a broad introduction
to psychology, cramming lots of
facts (rotely memorized) and
terminology into a short period
of time."
The committee suggested that
"with the addition of more dis

cussion in class and in groups
the course can be made better."
The results of the entire
study will be published as the
1968 Course Evaluation Re
view as a supplement to the
DAILY in the spring and
mailed to incoming freshmen
over the summer.
The study is financed by the
student legislature and is oper
ating under the Academic Af
fairs Committee of the ASSU.
For this year's study, "Com
puters are being used for the
first time in order to cover as
many courses as possible," Tam
many reported.
