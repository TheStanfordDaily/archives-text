Arroyo house prefers Robert
Kennedy for the 1968 presi
dency, but Phi Gamma Delta
(Fiji) leans toward Nelson
Rockefeller, according to a pre
liminary poll recently taken.
Majorities in both houses ad
vocate at least a temporary halt
in the bombing of North Viet
nam.
Such results were gathered
by opinion pollsters, who have
begun canvassing the campus
in preparation for Stanford's
participation in "Choice 68," the
first nation-wide collegiate pres
idential primary, sponsored by
Time magazine.
The two houses voted on a
ballot that permitted a choice
among all the major presidential
candidates as well as two refer
enda on the war and one on the
urban crisis. The ballot closely
approximates the one to be used
in the actual student election
April 24.
While it first appears that the

houses came out with opposite
preferences, several underlying
factors were present that may
have influenced the results.
Half the members of the Fiji
house are from prep-school, Re
publican backgrounds. While
Republican sentiments prevail
ed, the house did advocate Mc-
Carthy over Kennedy and gave
President Johnson no votes.
Three-quarters of the house
advocated a cessation of Viet
nam bombing and 11 per cent
chose a bombing increase. No
one wanted to use nuclear
weapons.
Arroyo picked Kennedy but
gave him only a plurality of
29 per cent. Johnson received 4
per cent, Rockefeller garnered
24 per cent, and Nixon 18 per
cent.
A majority sided with the
Fijis on the bombing issue but
there were 35 per cent who
wanted to intensify the bomb
ing.
