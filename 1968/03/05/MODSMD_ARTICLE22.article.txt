# Consumer Committee Report
## 
### 
(The ASSU Consumer Protec
tion Committee recently issued
Its first report to the legislature
and the student body at large.
Following is the text of that re
port.)
The following report enables
Stanford students to protect
themselves in their dealings with
individuals and companies (usu
ally merchants) outside the Stan
ford community by informing
the individual student of some
of the remedies, legal and other
wise, available to him when he
feels that he has been treated
unfairly.
A. Small Claims Court.
You're peacefully driving
along in your car, when sud
denly you find yourself involv
ed in a minor accident. It was
the other driver's fault, but he
doesn't have any insurance and
refuses to pay for the damage
to your car. For one reason or
another, you either can't, or
don't want to, make a claim
through your insurance com
pany.
Or perhaps you took your best
suit to the cleaners and it came
back covered with large indelible
grease spots. You ask the clean
er to pay for the damage, but
he refuses, saying that it wasn't
his fault.
In these and other situa
tions where you have a money
claim for under $300 (but usu
ally more than $20) an infor
mal and expeditious solution
to your problems may be
found in the small claims
court.
The procedure for pressing
your, claim is fairly simple. Ob
viously ,the first thing to do is
to try to settle the matter pri
vately with the other individual
or company and to demand the
amount of your claim.
Failing in that, and having de
cided to take the matter to small
claims, the next step is to de
cide in which court you should
bring your action against the
other person (the defendant),
be he an individual or a corpor
ation.
Probably the safest place to
sue him is in the judicial district
or city and county in which he
resides (or the place of business
of a corporation). This means
that if the defendant resides in
Santa Clara County (e.g. Palo
Alto) you go the clerk of the
small claims court at 270 Grant
in Palo Alto.
If, on the other hand, he re
sides in San Mateo County (e.g.
Menlo Park), you would go to
the clerk of the small claims
court at the corner of Hamilton
and Broadway in Redwood City.
In a contract action, you can
also sue him in the judicial dis
trict or city and county where
the obligation was to be per
formed; while in an action for

injury to person or personal
property (e.g. the car collision
case), you can sue him where
the injury occurred.
But It's usually simpler to
sue him where he resides, in
which case you'll always be
right
Once at the clerk's office,
you'll fill out a form stating that
the defendant owes you a cer
tain amount, that you have de
manded payment, that he has re
fused to pay, and that no part
has been paid. The clerk will
then fill out an affidavit with
this information, and will fill in
the time and place for your ap
pearance in court. All of this
will cost about $1.50 per defen
dant.
You can also, at this time,
have subpoenas issued for any
witnesses that you think may
be reluctant to attend.
A copy of the affidavit and the
order prepared by the clerk then
has to be served on the defen
dant. This can be done in any
one of three ways: (1) the clerk
can send it by registered mail,
for which you'll be charged a
small fee; (2) you can take it
to the sheriff's office nearby, and
for a slightly larger fee (usual
ly under $5.00), they'll serve it
for you; or (3) you can have a
disinterested person over the age
of 18 serve it, remembering that
he must afterwards return an
affidavit of service to the clerk.
You may not serve it yourself.
On the date of the trial, both
you and the defendant must ap
pear in court with all the evi
dence and witnesses needed to
present your sides of the case.
For instance, in the car colli
sion example above, you would
probably want to bring any wit
nesses who saw the accident, es
timates from repair shops or the
actual repair bill if the car has
already been repaired, and the
police accident report, if any was
taken, which will be at the lo
cal police or highway patrol of
fice.
If the defendant fails to
show up, the judge may ask
you a few questions, and then
usually will render a decision
in your favor (a default judg
ment).
Assuming, however, that he
does appear, both of you go
before the judge and present
your sides of the case. The hear
ing is very informal, there is
no jury, and no lawyers are
allowed to represent either
side. The judge will make an in
formal investigation of the con
troversy, either in or out of
court, and then render his deci
sion.
If there is a judgment in your
favor, you will be awarded the
amount of your damages plus
the costs of filing and service.
The defendant, however, has 30

days in which to appeal, but this
is uncommon.
Assuming that you win, and
the defendant still refuses to
pay, you may be able to col
lect the judgment by taking a
copy of it (which will have been
mailed to you) to the sheriff's
office and asking him to levy
on defendant's property. Al
though the charge for this proc
ess will also be assessed against
the defendant, levying tends to
be both costly and complicated.
Usually, It Is unnecessary, since
the defendant will pay the judg
ment, but if he doesn't, more in
formation is available at the
sheriff's office.
B. The Better Business Bureau.
Unlike small claims court,
which is a last resort, the Better
Business Bureau (BBB) oper
ates on the premise that an
ounce of prevention is worth a
pound of cure. Basically, the
888 attempts to control misrep
resentations and deception in
advertising and selling in a va
riety of ways:
(1) It publicizes deceptive
practices, both through the news
media and the use of pamphlets
describing sepcific practices. Re
cent pamphlets have included
such topics as, "Buying New or
Used Cars," "Bait Advertising,"
"FM • Stereo," "Appliances,"
"Home Study Schools," "Clean
ing and Laundering," and "Re
built Auto Motors."
(2) It maintains a listing of
"honest" charities soliciting in
the area. All it takes to inquire
about a particular charity is a
phone call to the local 888 office.
(3) Perhaps most important
ly for the consumer, the 888
keeps a file on businesses oper
ating in the county, and lists
complaints filed against particu
lar businesses or individuals.
Thus, if you're thinking about
doing business with a particular
firm, and are interested in learn
ing about its reputation in the
community, all that's necessary
is to write, telephone, or visit the
local 888 office. It's services are
free, and one phone call could
have you a lot of grief in the
future.
(4) If, however, you feel that
a merchant has already dealt
with you unfairly, you can file a
signed complaint with the 888,
which will then attempt to set
tle the grievance.
They do not, however, engage
in any kind of legal work, so
that if you're faced with a busi
nessman who won't settle, your
only legal recourse is through
small claims court, or in cases
involving more than $300, hiring
a lawyer.
The 888 also will not rec
ommend any particular com
pany, and does not pass judg
ment on prices, quality of mer
chandise, etc.

The 888 is supported by lo
cal businesses through subscrip
tions, on the theory that a
healthy business climate is bet
ter for all concerned. However,
it is sufficiently independent to
provide you with a fair evalua
tion of a company, whether or
not that company is a subscriber.
, The 888 for Santa Clara
Coianty is located at 1153 Lin
coln Avq. in San Jose (Ph. 298
5880), and twice a week, on
Tuesday and Thursday, from
10 a.m. to 3 p.m., operates an of
fice in the Village Corner Shop
ping Center in Los Altos (Ph.
948-7799). The San Mateo Coun
ty office is located at 20 N. San
Mateo Drive in San Mateo (Ph.
347-1251).
C. Companies and Associations.
When dealing with the local
representative of a large corpor
ation who fails to properly re
spond to a complaint, you can
occasionally get results by writ
ing to the main office.
Perhaps the area in which
this remedy can be most effec
tively employed is in the case
where you feel you were cheat
ed by a gas station (e.g. where
you were sold a battery or, tires
you really didn't need because
you supposedly couldn't make it
another mile without them), and
the purchase was charged on a
credit card.
After carefully computing
your damages, you can with
hold payment to that extent,
and write a letter to the na
tional office, explicitly setting
forth the basis of your com
plaint Often the company will

deduct the amount from your
bill.
Situations may also aris<-
where you'll bo able to get re
sults by working through an
association (if you're a mem
ber), such as the AAA, which
keeps close control over the tow
ing services, restaurants, hotels
and motels it recommends.
In addition, it campaigns to
eliminate some of the more bla
tant fraudulent practices aimed
at the motorist.
If you can't get action out of
the local office, explicitly set
forth your complaint in a let
ter to the national office, and
state that the local office was
reluctant to act.
D. On-Campus Solicitation
The campus police control on
campus solicitation, which is
generally banned at Stanford.
In recent years, however, sev
eral companies (especially in
the areas of insurance, land
sales, and encyclopedia sales)
have either posted in University
buildings or mailed to indivi
dual students postage-paid cards,
to the effect that, "Mail in this
card and we will send you a
free gift plus information about
our program."
Often, a student will nead
"send" to mean "mail." Instead,
a high-pressure salesman shows
up at his door to discuss the
great benefits of the company's
program. Because the student
has sent in the card, he has, in
effect, invited the salesman onto
the campus, and thus, there is
no violation of the solicitation
ban.

LINE OF CONFRONTATION — The posts that block Galvez Street
to traffic at Escondido were removed sometime Saturday night or
Sunday morning, and the holes the posts fitted into were filled with
cement Yesterday morning, however, a University maintenance
team replaced the posts. Thomas Bell, assistant chief of the campus
police, said the removing job probably took "about five minutes if
whoever did it had the cement all mixed beforehand." Bell said
the police did not know who perpetrated the act.
