# Fear Of Genetic Damage
## LSD Use Plateauing 
### 
Use of the hallucinogenic
drug LSD on college campuses
and in the dark warrens of
hippie communities is diminish
ing or leveling off, according
to some narcotics experts across
the country.
At the same time however,
these experts are generally
agreed that the taking of such
other potentially dangerous
drugs such as Methedrine or
"speed," liquid amphetemines
and marijuana is on the rise.
"The charisma of LSD has
been tarnished a bit," says Dr.
Donald B. Louria of New York's
Bellevue Hospital who is presi
dent of the State Council on
Drug Addiction.
"I think it's safe to say use
of LSD has plateaued and I'll
bet that there will be a decline
in the next several months.
Other authorities, both
physicians and law enforce
ment officers, see signs of an
immediate dramatic decline,
primarily because of wide
spread reports that the drug
may cause genetic damage
and because of Increasing po
lice pressure on sources.
There have also been a num
ber of reports that LSD, an
acronym for lysergic acid di
ethylamide, has been responsible
for mental disorders and that
recurrence of hallucination has
taken place up to a year after
the using of the drug.

Dr. David Smith, who heads
the Haight-Ashbury Medical
Clinic of San Francisco General
Hospital, however, says that
the use of LSD may seem to be
at a plateau among hippies be
cause 80 to 90 per cent of them
are taking it
He adds that users on college
campuses may be fearful of pos
sible effects, but that hippies
"do not believe the frightening
stories.
Dr. Smith confirms that the
use of amphetamines, which
are stimulants, "has gone up
tremendously.' He believes that
this drug group is "by far the
greatest problem because they
have much more dangerous
physical and psychological ef
fects than LSD.
At Boston City Hospital, Dr.
Vernon D. Patch, who heads
the in-patient psychiatric serv
ice, says "there's no question
that the use of acid (LSD)
seems to be down.
•There are a number of
people who go the route from
marijuana to something like
'speed, who have decided that
LSD Is not safe, he contends.
"However, they seem willing
to experiment with other
drugs."
A spokesman in the Boston
field office of the Bureau of
Drug Abuse Control of the Fed
eral Food and Drug Adminis

tration said there were "defi
nite indicators that our en
forcement and education pro
gram have been effective in
curtailing traffic of LSD."
Dr. Timothy Leary, who has
based a religion on LSD, was
in Detroit last week, but, ac
cording to some students, he
has apparently lost some of
his following among college
youth.
"Leary's a great entertainer,"
says Stephen Clark, a student
at Wayne State, "but—if you'll
pardon the pun—he's let all of
this go to his head."
The Los Angeles police say
that medical research stories
on possible physical damage
through the use of LSD have
caused some parents to report
their own children to narcotics
agents. Other persons are tele
phoning tips on suppliers to
the police.
Dr. Richard Blum of Stanford
University's Institute for the
Study of Human Relations,
which collects statistics on
drug use, says it is his best
estimate, based on reports, that
"it would appear we have
leveled off in the use of hal
lucinogens."
He stressed, however, that
the statistics coming in from
college and high school cam
puses had not yet been com
piled or published.

At Boston City Hospital, Dr.
Vernon D. Patch, who heads
the in-patient psychiatric serv
ice, says "there's no question
that the use of acid (LSD)
seems to be down.

people who go the route from
marijuana to something like
'speed, who have decided that
LSD Is not safe, he contends.
"However, they seem willing
to experiment with other
drugs."

field office of the Bureau of

tration said there were "defi

forcement and education pro

Dr. Timothy Leary, who has
based a religion on LSD, was
in Detroit last week, but, ac
cording to some students, he
has apparently lost some of
his following among college
youth.
"Leary's a great entertainer,"
says Stephen Clark, a student
at Wayne State, "but—if you'll
pardon the pun—he's let all of
this go to his head."
The Los Angeles police say
that medical research stories
on possible physical damage
through the use of LSD have
caused some parents to report
their own children to narcotics
agents. Other persons are tele
phoning tips on suppliers to
the police.
Dr. Richard Blum of Stanford
University's Institute for the
Study of Human Relations,
which collects statistics on
drug use, says it is his best
estimate, based on reports, that
"it would appear we have
leveled off in the use of hal
lucinogens."
He stressed, however, that
the statistics coming in from
college and high school cam
puses had not yet been com
piled or published.
Use of the hallucinogenic
drug LSD on college campuses
and in the dark warrens of
hippie communities is diminish
ing or leveling off, according
to some narcotics experts across
the country.
At the same time however,
these experts are generally
agreed that the taking of such
other potentially dangerous
drugs such as Methedrine or
"speed," liquid amphetemines
and marijuana is on the rise.
"The charisma of LSD has
been tarnished a bit," says Dr.
Donald B. Louria of New York's
Bellevue Hospital who is presi
dent of the State Council on
Drug Addiction.
"I think it's safe to say use
of LSD has plateaued and I'll
bet that there will be a decline
in the next several months.
Other authorities, both
physicians and law enforce
ment officers, see signs of an
immediate dramatic decline,
primarily because of wide
spread reports that the drug
may cause genetic damage
and because of Increasing po
lice pressure on sources.
There have also been a num
ber of reports that LSD, an
acronym for lysergic acid di
ethylamide, has been responsible
for mental disorders and that
recurrence of hallucination has
taken place up to a year after
the using of the drug.

Dr. David Smith, who heads
the Haight-Ashbury Medical
Clinic of San Francisco General
Hospital, however, says that
the use of LSD may seem to be
at a plateau among hippies be
cause 80 to 90 per cent of them
are taking it
He adds that users on college
campuses may be fearful of pos
sible effects, but that hippies
"do not believe the frightening
stories.
Dr. Smith confirms that the
use of amphetamines, which
are stimulants, "has gone up
tremendously.' He believes that
this drug group is "by far the
greatest problem because they
have much more dangerous
physical and psychological ef
fects than LSD.
