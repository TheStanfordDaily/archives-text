# Ex-Bishop Pike To Speak In Century 21 Talk Tonight
## 
### 
Former Bishop James A. Pike,
one of America's most contro
versial religious figures, will
speak tonight at 7:30 in Memo
rial Church.
His talk, which concludes Cen
tury 21's lecture program for
the winter, is entitled "Theology
Today and Tomorrow."
One of the most liberal church
men in the country, he was ac
cused in 1966 of herectically re
jecting such traditional Chris
tian doctrines as the Trinity and
the Virgin Birth.
Pike's hope for the theology
of tomorrow is that it will be
based on "empirical faith." He
sums up his formula for faith
in the equation: "data -5- infer
ence = modest faith-affirmation."
According to him, the tradi
tional sources for Christian doc
trine are all suspect. The Bible,
for instance, is shot through
with "superstition, sheer evil,
and flat contradiction."

What the rejection of tradi
tional authority means, argues
Pike, is that man is forced to
create his own dogmas on the
empirical basis of what can be
proved factually.
Pike was Bishop of the Epis
copal Diocese of California from
1958 to 1966 and is now a staff
member of the Center for the
Study of Democratic Institutions
at Santa Barbara. Before that he
served from 1952 to 1958 as Dean
of the Cathedral of St. John the
Divine in New York City.
He graduated in arts and law
from the University of Southern
California and received a law
degree from Yale. He also re
ceived the degree of Bachelor of
Divinity, Magna Cum L a u de,
from Union Theological Semi
nary. He is the author of many
books on law, religion, and
ethics. Among his most recent
books are You and the New
Morality and If This Be Heresy.
