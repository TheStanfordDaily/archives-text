# New Deadline For State Aid
## 
### 
The application deadline for
State Graduate Fellowships for
students who are planning to
teach in California colleges has
been extended to March 15, 1968,
by the State Scholarship and
Loan Commission.
The Commission announced
that uncertainities in the minds
of many students about gradu
ate school plans has led to an
extension of the deadline. The
Commission recognizes that the
status of graduate students rela
tive to the draft has caused
many students not to submit
applications by the earlier dead
line.
College seniors who must sub
mit scores on the aptitude sec
tion of the Graduate Record Ex
amination will have an addition
al opportunity to meet this re
quirement by submitting scores
from the Feb. 24 Graduate Rec
ord Examination to the State
Scholarship and Loan Commis
sion. Full details and applica
tions are available from the
financial aid office or the grad
uate school office.
