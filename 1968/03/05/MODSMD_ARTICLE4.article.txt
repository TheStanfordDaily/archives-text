# Professors' Reactions Differ On Planned University Strike
## 
### NANCY ETTENHEIM 
A student legislature resolu
tion calling for a campus-wide
demonstration on April 11 has
met with divergent reactions
from faculty and administrators.
The proposed demonstration
is intended to call attention to
the draft and to the students'
concern about the war in Viet
nam.
The proposal, as accepted, will
call for all students to boycott
their classes, teaching assistants
and professors to cancel their
classes, and office personnel to
stay away from their jobs.
University officials would state
no official policy on the boycott
"Students are free to cut classes
if they choose," commented Pres
ident Wallace Sterling. "Faculty
have an obligation to teach
classes that day,"he added, em
phasizing that he was giving
only his own opinion on the ques
tion.
Vice Provost Howard Brooks
said the proposed boycott
doesn't make sense." He stress
ed that he has "great anxieties
and unhappiness about the draft,
but it seems to me that shutting

down the academic enterprise is
striking at the wrong target."
Brooks said he would not urge
students "one way or another"
on boycotting classes. "It's up to
the individual professors what
they do' 'in response to the boy
cott.
University Remains Open
As for University staff, Brooks
commented: "The University
will be open for business. Pe
riod."
Several faculty members felt
that despite the validity of pro
testing both the draft issue and
the Vietnam war, the rights of
tuition paying students would be
violated if faculty members re
fused to teach.
Economics Professor Lorie
Tarshis stated that ho would
"favor any method of drawing
attention to the problem provid
ed the method hits those who
implement the policy. I don't
think the University should be
the target of the demonstrations
though."
Student Rights Violated
In addition, he felt that there
would be a "definite violation of
student rights if faculty mem
bers did not make up class time
lost during the boycott."

Another faculty member, Pro
fessor Robert C. North of the
Political Science department, ex
pressed doubt as to the efficacy
of a university strike.
"My feeling is that I am very
dubious as to the effect such a
demonstration would have on the
course of U.S. foreign policy.
But if organized properly, it
could have value here at Stan
ford as an educational instru
ment."
He also stated that despite the
possible usefulness of such a
demonstration, "professors at
Stanford have an obligation to
their students to be in class."
More adamantly against the
proposed strike was History Pro
fessor Thomas A. Bailey. He as
serted that "nothing will be
achieved by the proposed dem
onstration. I have no expecta
tions for it. Some other form
of expressing concern must be
sought."
Strike Supported
However, the proposal was
staunchly supported by a num
ber of Stanford's faculty mem
bers.
Professor of Economics John
G. Gurley stated, "I'm in favor
of it. I'll participate in the

demonstration. I feel that this
type of demonstration is good
at focusing on an issue. It is
better than voting for a specific
man who represents a hundred
different issues."
"There is a hierarchy of rights.
Some rights will be violated in
the proposed boycott, but they
are superseded by higher rights
which involve the whole war."
Gurley stated that he would
stay away from his classes that
day.
Also in favor of the proposed
boycott was Associate Professor
of English H. Br.uce Franklin.
"I certainly support the student
strike."
He did not feel that the strike
would be in violation of student'
rights to expect classes to be
held. "One has to assess priori
ties of rights. Clearly, one day's
classes are not very significant."
However, Franklin did feel
that the choice of April 11 as
the date for the proposed strike
was not the most effective. He
added that it would be more ad
vantageous to co-ordinate the
Stanford boycott with a sche
duled national student strike

of expressing concern must be

Strike Supported
However, the proposal was
staunchly supported by a num

Professor of Economics John
G. Gurley stated, "I'm in favor
of it. I'll participate in the

demonstration. I feel that this
type of demonstration is good
at focusing on an issue. It is
better than voting for a specific
man who represents a hundred
different issues."
"There is a hierarchy of rights.
Some rights will be violated in
the proposed boycott, but they
are superseded by higher rights
which involve the whole war."
Gurley stated that he would
stay away from his classes that
day.
Also in favor of the proposed
boycott was Associate Professor
of English H. Br.uce Franklin.
"I certainly support the student
strike."
He did not feel that the strike
would be in violation of student'
rights to expect classes to be
held. "One has to assess priori
ties of rights. Clearly, one day's
classes are not very significant."
However, Franklin did feel
that the choice of April 11 as

was not the most effective. He
added that it would be more ad

The proposal, as accepted, will
call for all students to boycott
their classes, teaching assistants

classes, and office personnel to
stay away from their jobs.
University officials would state
no official policy on the boycott
"Students are free to cut classes
if they choose," commented Pres

have an obligation to teach
classes that day,"he added, em
phasizing that he was giving
only his own opinion on the ques

Vice Provost Howard Brooks
said the proposed boycott
doesn't make sense." He stress
ed that he has "great anxieties
and unhappiness about the draft,
but it seems to me that shutting

down the academic enterprise is
striking at the wrong target."
Brooks said he would not urge
students "one way or another"
on boycotting classes. "It's up to
the individual professors what
they do' 'in response to the boy
cott.

As for University staff, Brooks
commented: "The University
will be open for business. Pe

Several faculty members felt
that despite the validity of pro
testing both the draft issue and
the Vietnam war, the rights of
tuition paying students would be
violated if faculty members re

Economics Professor Lorie
Tarshis stated that ho would
"favor any method of drawing
attention to the problem provid

think the University should be
the target of the demonstrations
though."

In addition, he felt that there
would be a "definite violation of
student rights if faculty mem

lost during the boycott."

Another faculty member, Pro
fessor Robert C. North of the
Political Science department, ex
pressed doubt as to the efficacy
of a university strike.
"My feeling is that I am very
dubious as to the effect such a
demonstration would have on the
course of U.S. foreign policy.
But if organized properly, it
could have value here at Stan
ford as an educational instru

He also stated that despite the
