## Debate On Civil Rights Bill Curbed 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)— Sen.
ate leaders finally corralled
enough votes Monday to restrict
further debate on a compromise
civil rights bill, apparently as
suring passage of legislation
carrying some form of open
housing guarantee.
Technically, Monday's vote
was on "perfecting" the bill
with some 80 amendments that
have been offered during the
seven weeks the measure has
been before the Senate.
Much of the opposition was
based on the bill's open-housing
amendment. As originally pro
posed this would have outlawed
discrimination in the sale or
rental of an estimated 97 per
cent of all housing in the coun
try.
The coverage was whittled
down to about 70 per cent in a
compromise version worked out
last week.
