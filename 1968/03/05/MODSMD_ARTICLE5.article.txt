## Debate On Civil Rights Bill Curbed 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)— Sen.
ate leaders finally corralled
enough votes Monday to restrict
further debate on a compromise
civil rights bill, apparently as
suring passage of legislation
carrying some form of open
housing guarantee.
Technically, Monday's vote
was on "perfecting" the bill
with some 80 amendments that
have been offered during the
seven weeks the measure has
been before the Senate.
Much of the opposition was
based on the bill's open-housing
amendment. As originally pro
posed this would have outlawed
discrimination in the sale or
rental of an estimated 97 per
cent of all housing in the coun
try.
The coverage was whittled
down to about 70 per cent in a
compromise version worked out
last week.

dent Johnson proposed Monday
an unexpected federal move to
hold down drug prices as part of
a "Health in America" message
to Congress.
The program, proposing fed
eral outlays increased from this
year's $14 billion to $16 billion
for fiscal 1969, also called for
added efforts to hold down med
ical costs.
And the President asked for
big increases in spending to pro
vide poor women with birth-con
trol devices or drugs and with
maternal and child-care serv
ices.
He said America, 15th in in
fant mortality, "should lead the
world in saving itr young."

• Pat Smith 9 s Clinic Hit
SAIGON (AP) — Six Viet
Cong seized the hospital run by
Dr. Patricia Smith of Seattle,
outside the central highlands
strongpoint of Kontum.
They blew up a laboratory
and X-ray building and fired
into a ward filled with mountain
peasants called Montagnards.
One of the patients was killed
and four were wounded. A Ger
man nurse was kidnaped along
with two Montagnard male nur
ses. The two men later escaped.
Dr. Smith hid in another
building while Montagnards
threw the Viet Cong off her trail
by insisting she and two other
American nurses had gone to
Kontum. Dr. Smith then fled.
Misses Platz and Blonien appar
ently had left earlier.
Dr. Smith, who has been in
South Vietnam eight years, is
highly regarded by the Montag
nards who come to her from all
over the highlands for free med
ical care. For this reason, U.S.

officials felt the enemy would
not harm her or the hospital.

Union kept silent Monday on
its mysterious new unmanned
space ship called Zond 4,

return to earth — a necessary

• Foes Of Mao Active
HONG KONG (AP) — Red
Chinese provincial radio broad
casts declared Monday that po
litical turmoil and factional
fighting were severely hamper
ing spring planting in much of
southern China.
One broadcast indicated that
the enemies of party Chairman
Moa Tse-tung have disrupted
traffic on the main rail and road
lines carrying Chinese weapons

from the southwest province of
Yunnan to North Vietnam.
Chinese Nationalist intelli
gence sources last week report
ed that there had been clashes
between supporters of Mao and
the backers of his rival, Presi
dent Liu Shao-chi, in Yunnan
close to the North Vietnamese
border.
The statement, combined with
references to farm production
leaders shirking their duties,
was seen as an indication of a
passive rebellion by agricultural
workers.

veals the absolute necessity of
his spring campaign in Wash

WASHINGTON (AP) — Free
speech cases spawned by Dar

— issues that divided different
generations of Americans—were
taken on by the Supreme Court

They test whether Arkansas
school children have the right to
be taught the evolutionary the
ory that man has common ances
try with the apes and whether a
group of lowa children could op
pose the Vietnam war by wear
