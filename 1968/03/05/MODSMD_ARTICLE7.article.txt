# Campbell As Regent
## 
### 
Gov. Ronald Reagan has appointed W. Glenn Campbell, di
rector of Stanford's Hoover Institution, to the Board of Regents
of the University of California. He will serve until 1984.
On Feb. 11 Campbell told a Los Angeles alumni conference,
"If the federal government will keep its hands off, the income
from private sources will exceed the needs of universities over
the next decade."
This is a strange opinion for a man who now shares legal
responsibility for the nation's largest public university system.
Last year the University of California received $153 million from
the federal government, 28 per cent of its total income. The
Berkeley campus counted on Washington for 34 per cent of its
income.
With Reagan determined to freeze the state's contribution to
the university's budget, hapless U.C. administrators can only hope
for more federal aid.
Yet their new regent says he wants the federal government to
"keep its hands off."
If Reagan wants to appoint doctrinnaire conservatives to the
Board of Regents, that's his prerogative. Once again the people
of this state are getting exactly what they voted for.
But we ask Campbell to reconsider his negativism toward
federal aid. Higher education needs more support from every
source â€” private and public.
