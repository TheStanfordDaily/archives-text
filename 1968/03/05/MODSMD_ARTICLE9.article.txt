# Letter To The Editor
## McCarthy Vote Would Help Negroes 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
CORE organizer Elijah Turner
of Oakland, a leader of the Cali
fornia Democratic Council's
Black Caucus and a member of
the slate of delegates that will
go to the Democratic National
Convention, if McCarthy wins in
the primary, has pointed out to
me that a vote for McCarthy
is a vote to send 30 black dele
gates and 22 Mexican-American
delegates to the Convention.
There will be 172 delegates from
California all told.
Those who see no difference
between McCarthy and Johnson
might reappraise their voting
plans in light of this. Turner
and many other Black Caucus
members do not strongly favor.
McCarthy either, but they want
to get to the Chicago Conven
tion in order to establish a Black
Caucus there and create pres
sures inside the headquarters
while anti-Johnson demonstra
tors protest outside.
I'm sure most Peace and Free
dom members would support

this aim, and would reregister
temporarily in order to further
it. . . .

Zionism And Judaism
Are Two Movements
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding the letter printed
in your isue of Feb. 27 signed
by "An Arab Refugee", ... I
would like to correct some of
the more outstanding confus
ions and misinterpretations.
It might surprise this "Refu
gee" to learn that Jews continue
to hold major posts in such
Arab countries as Egypt—two
are on the main governing body
of the Political Union. After 19
years in a state of war with
Israel, this is indeed a miracle.
Nasser is certainly repressing
any Zionist movements in
Egypt, but not Jews as such.
It is this identification of re
ligion (Judaism) with a political
movement (Zionism), and a be
lief that the two are the same,

which makes it so difficult for
Americans to understand the
Arabs.
As for Nasser not being pro
gressive, I can only point to the
facts. Since Nasser seized power
from the corrupt aristocracy in
1952, Egypt has witnessed a
tremendous amount of progress
in education, health, redistribu
tion of wealth, improvement of
agriculture, construction of in
dustry, stabilization of the econ
omy, and increased political par
ticipation by the masses.
To imagine that the Arab-
Israeli conflict would be re
solved by merely eliminating
Nasser is equal to imagining
that it could be resolved by
eliminating Ben Gurion or Day
an ... . Nasser is a symbol of
the Arab cause—not the cause
itself. . . .
To speak of "Israel not seek
ing domination upon its neigh
bor's lands" on the one hand,
and then to predict that Israel
will "follow its way up to the
heart of the hatred and will dis

lodge the dictator and deliver
the Egyptian people . . . and the
other Arab nations" on the other
hand, Is to speak in the ultimate
of contradictions. It is precisely
this contradiction of disclaiming
domination and advocating "lib
eration" which prompts the
Arabs to label Israel and its
backers (the United States) as
"imperialists." Nasser or no
Nasser, the Arabs are not eager
to be "liberated" by Israel.
The refusal of "An Arab Ref
ugee" to sign his name is per
haps as disturbing as any part
of his lotter. Such unsigned emo
tional diatribes which purport
to be based on fact and reason
are an insult to the academic
community, for one is unable to
refute the sources or the au
thor. . . .
DONALD H. PLATT
Army Physical Exams
Allow Draft Dodging
Editor, The Daily:
"The Nebbish" spoke a bit
hastily about the pains of draft
dodging in the Feb. 26 Daily.
As he suggests, most such pains
have their origin in inaccurate
or incomplete draft information
—some of which graced his own
column .
In the first place, . . . one
usually takes a physical examin
ation a month or two before in
duction. The Army won't induct
anyone unless they've passed
such an examination, either on
the spot or within the past year.
The innocuous government
document is not "Form AR 40-
501 . . . but "Army Regula
tion 40-501 . . . " —that's what
the AR stands for. This may bo
nitpicking, but ask your librar
ian for "Form AR 40-501. .
and see what happens. Incident
ally, this innocuous government
document is for sale by the Gov
ernment Printing Office as well
as the Anti-Draft Union.
The SS Regulations say that
one must "keep his local board
currently informed .... of his
physical condition" with no ifs,
but's, or maybe's about whether
the condition is acceptable to
the Army or not. . . . It's not
customary to sic the FBI on
people who fail in such responsi
bilities.
Instead, the draft is used to
punish them (without such in
conveniences as juries. . . ).
They are "declared delinquent,"
and ordered to report for induc
tion in about 30 days. That
sounds pretty scary, as it's no
doubt meant to, but there's a
catch.
The Army still won't take
them until they pass a physical
examination: if they've passed
one within the past year, fine;
otherwise they're given one on
the spot. So Newton Fenwick
would have 30 days to get back
up to his magnificent 220
pounds. . . .
BILL MEYES
A George Wallace Vote
Would Help Future
Editor, The Dally:
Can't stand the thought of
Johnson and four more years
of war? What kind of choice
does Nixon represent? Does the

system blow your cool?
All a Nixon victory could do
would be to put in a group who
had not yet totally committed
their image of themselves to
successful (?) prosecution of the
war. But the greater their mar
gin of victory the more secure
they would feel. Conversely, the
greater the margin for LBJ, the
more insanity.
So why not vote for Wallace?
When you can't stand the sys
tem, when it offers no viable al
ternative, why not work for its
overthrow, or at least its sub
stantial reorganization?
If Nixon is the Republican
nominee, let's polarize the sys
tem and aid the disintegration of
the unstable coalition which con
fronts us with an inane choice.
To insure the outcome, if the
Peace and Freedom Party mem
bers — including myself — find
that there is no candidate avail
able for national support, why
not back Wallace? The objective
would be to screw up this elec
tion in preparation for a more
viable future.

document is not "Form AR 40-

the AR stands for. This may bo
nitpicking, but ask your librar

document is for sale by the Gov

The SS Regulations say that
one must "keep his local board
currently informed .... of his

the condition is acceptable to
the Army or not. . . . It's not
customary to sic the FBI on
people who fail in such responsi
bilities.
Instead, the draft is used to
punish them (without such in
conveniences as juries. . . ).
They are "declared delinquent,"
and ordered to report for induc
tion in about 30 days. That
sounds pretty scary, as it's no
doubt meant to, but there's a
catch.
The Army still won't take
them until they pass a physical
examination: if they've passed
one within the past year, fine;
otherwise they're given one on
the spot. So Newton Fenwick
would have 30 days to get back
up to his magnificent 220

A George Wallace Vote

Editor, The Dally:
Can't stand the thought of
Johnson and four more years
of war? What kind of choice
does Nixon represent? Does the

system blow your cool?
All a Nixon victory could do
would be to put in a group who
had not yet totally committed
their image of themselves to
successful (?) prosecution of the
war. But the greater their mar
gin of victory the more secure
they would feel. Conversely, the
greater the margin for LBJ, the
more insanity.
So why not vote for Wallace?
When you can't stand the sys
tem, when it offers no viable al
ternative, why not work for its
overthrow, or at least its sub
stantial reorganization?
If Nixon is the Republican
nominee, let's polarize the sys
tem and aid the disintegration of
the unstable coalition which con
fronts us with an inane choice.
To insure the outcome, if the
Peace and Freedom Party mem
bers — including myself — find
that there is no candidate avail
able for national support, why
not back Wallace? The objective
would be to screw up this elec
tion in preparation for a more
viable future.

There will be 172 delegates from
California all told.

McCarthy either, but they want
to get to the Chicago Conven

Zionism And Judaism
Are Two Movements
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding the letter printed
in your isue of Feb. 27 signed
by "An Arab Refugee", ... I
would like to correct some of
the more outstanding confus
ions and misinterpretations.
It might surprise this "Refu
gee" to learn that Jews continue
to hold major posts in such
Arab countries as Egypt—two
are on the main governing body
of the Political Union. After 19
years in a state of war with
Israel, this is indeed a miracle.
Nasser is certainly repressing
any Zionist movements in
Egypt, but not Jews as such.
It is this identification of re
ligion (Judaism) with a political
movement (Zionism), and a be
lief that the two are the same,

which makes it so difficult for
Americans to understand the
Arabs.
As for Nasser not being pro
gressive, I can only point to the
facts. Since Nasser seized power
from the corrupt aristocracy in
1952, Egypt has witnessed a
tremendous amount of progress
in education, health, redistribu
tion of wealth, improvement of
agriculture, construction of in
dustry, stabilization of the econ
omy, and increased political par
ticipation by the masses.
To imagine that the Arab-
Israeli conflict would be re
solved by merely eliminating
Nasser is equal to imagining
that it could be resolved by
eliminating Ben Gurion or Day
an ... . Nasser is a symbol of
the Arab cause—not the cause
itself. . . .
To speak of "Israel not seek
ing domination upon its neigh
bor's lands" on the one hand,
and then to predict that Israel
will "follow its way up to the
heart of the hatred and will dis

lodge the dictator and deliver
the Egyptian people . . . and the
other Arab nations" on the other
hand, Is to speak in the ultimate
of contradictions. It is precisely
this contradiction of disclaiming
domination and advocating "lib
eration" which prompts the
Arabs to label Israel and its
backers (the United States) as
"imperialists." Nasser or no
Nasser, the Arabs are not eager
to be "liberated" by Israel.
The refusal of "An Arab Ref
ugee" to sign his name is per
haps as disturbing as any part
of his lotter. Such unsigned emo
tional diatribes which purport
to be based on fact and reason
are an insult to the academic

DONALD H. PLATT
Army Physical Exams
Allow Draft Dodging
Editor, The Daily:
"The Nebbish" spoke a bit
hastily about the pains of draft
dodging in the Feb. 26 Daily.
As he suggests, most such pains
have their origin in inaccurate
or incomplete draft information
—some of which graced his own
column .
In the first place, . . . one
usually takes a physical examin
ation a month or two before in
duction. The Army won't induct
anyone unless they've passed
such an examination, either on
the spot or within the past year.
The innocuous government
document is not "Form AR 40-
501 . . . but "Army Regula
tion 40-501 . . . " —that's what
the AR stands for. This may bo
nitpicking, but ask your librar
ian for "Form AR 40-501. .
and see what happens. Incident
ally, this innocuous government
document is for sale by the Gov
ernment Printing Office as well
as the Anti-Draft Union.
The SS Regulations say that
one must "keep his local board
currently informed .... of his
physical condition" with no ifs,
but's, or maybe's about whether
the condition is acceptable to
the Army or not. . . . It's not
customary to sic the FBI on
people who fail in such responsi
bilities.
Instead, the draft is used to
punish them (without such in
conveniences as juries. . . ).
They are "declared delinquent,"
and ordered to report for induc
tion in about 30 days. That
sounds pretty scary, as it's no
doubt meant to, but there's a
catch.
The Army still won't take
them until they pass a physical
examination: if they've passed
one within the past year, fine;
otherwise they're given one on
the spot. So Newton Fenwick
would have 30 days to get back
up to his magnificent 220
pounds. . . .

A George Wallace Vote

Editor, The Dally:
Can't stand the thought of
Johnson and four more years
of war? What kind of choice
does Nixon represent? Does the

system blow your cool?
All a Nixon victory could do
would be to put in a group who
had not yet totally committed
their image of themselves to
successful (?) prosecution of the
war. But the greater their mar
gin of victory the more secure
they would feel. Conversely, the
greater the margin for LBJ, the
more insanity.
So why not vote for Wallace?
When you can't stand the sys
tem, when it offers no viable al
ternative, why not work for its
overthrow, or at least its sub
stantial reorganization?
If Nixon is the Republican
nominee, let's polarize the sys
tem and aid the disintegration of
the unstable coalition which con
fronts us with an inane choice.
To insure the outcome, if the
Peace and Freedom Party mem
bers — including myself — find
that there is no candidate avail
able for national support, why
not back Wallace? The objective
would be to screw up this elec
tion in preparation for a more
viable future.

Can't stand the thought of
Johnson and four more years
of war? What kind of choice
does Nixon represent? Does the

system blow your cool?
All a Nixon victory could do
would be to put in a group who
had not yet totally committed
their image of themselves to
successful (?) prosecution of the
war. But the greater their mar
gin of victory the more secure
they would feel. Conversely, the
greater the margin for LBJ, the
more insanity.
So why not vote for Wallace?
When you can't stand the sys
tem, when it offers no viable al
ternative, why not work for its
overthrow, or at least its sub
stantial reorganization?
If Nixon is the Republican
nominee, let's polarize the sys
tem and aid the disintegration of
the unstable coalition which con
fronts us with an inane choice.
To insure the outcome, if the
Peace and Freedom Party mem
bers — including myself — find
that there is no candidate avail
able for national support, why
not back Wallace? The objective
would be to screw up this elec
tion in preparation for a more
viable future.

Editor, The Daily:
CORE organizer Elijah Turner
of Oakland, a leader of the Cali
fornia Democratic Council's
Black Caucus and a member of
the slate of delegates that will
go to the Democratic National
Convention, if McCarthy wins in
the primary, has pointed out to
me that a vote for McCarthy
is a vote to send 30 black dele
gates and 22 Mexican-American
delegates to the Convention.
There will be 172 delegates from
California all told.
Those who see no difference
between McCarthy and Johnson
might reappraise their voting
plans in light of this. Turner
and many other Black Caucus
members do not strongly favor.
McCarthy either, but they want
to get to the Chicago Conven
tion in order to establish a Black
Caucus there and create pres
sures inside the headquarters
while anti-Johnson demonstra
tors protest outside.
I'm sure most Peace and Free
dom members would support

this aim, and would reregister
temporarily in order to further
it. . . .

Zionism And Judaism
Are Two Movements
Editor, The Daily:
Regarding the letter printed
in your isue of Feb. 27 signed
by "An Arab Refugee", ... I
would like to correct some of
the more outstanding confus
ions and misinterpretations.
It might surprise this "Refu
gee" to learn that Jews continue
to hold major posts in such
Arab countries as Egypt—two
are on the main governing body
of the Political Union. After 19
years in a state of war with
Israel, this is indeed a miracle.
Nasser is certainly repressing
any Zionist movements in
Egypt, but not Jews as such.
It is this identification of re
ligion (Judaism) with a political
movement (Zionism), and a be
lief that the two are the same,

which makes it so difficult for
Americans to understand the
Arabs.
As for Nasser not being pro
gressive, I can only point to the
facts. Since Nasser seized power
from the corrupt aristocracy in
1952, Egypt has witnessed a
tremendous amount of progress
in education, health, redistribu
tion of wealth, improvement of
agriculture, construction of in
dustry, stabilization of the econ
omy, and increased political par
ticipation by the masses.
To imagine that the Arab-
Israeli conflict would be re
solved by merely eliminating
Nasser is equal to imagining
that it could be resolved by
eliminating Ben Gurion or Day
an ... . Nasser is a symbol of
the Arab cause—not the cause
itself. . . .
To speak of "Israel not seek
ing domination upon its neigh
bor's lands" on the one hand,
and then to predict that Israel
will "follow its way up to the
heart of the hatred and will dis

lodge the dictator and deliver
the Egyptian people . . . and the
other Arab nations" on the other
hand, Is to speak in the ultimate
of contradictions. It is precisely
this contradiction of disclaiming
domination and advocating "lib
eration" which prompts the
Arabs to label Israel and its
backers (the United States) as
"imperialists." Nasser or no
Nasser, the Arabs are not eager
to be "liberated" by Israel.
The refusal of "An Arab Ref
ugee" to sign his name is per
haps as disturbing as any part
of his lotter. Such unsigned emo
tional diatribes which purport
to be based on fact and reason
are an insult to the academic
community, for one is unable to
refute the sources or the au
thor. . . .
DONALD H. PLATT
Army Physical Exams
Allow Draft Dodging
Editor, The Daily:
"The Nebbish" spoke a bit
hastily about the pains of draft
dodging in the Feb. 26 Daily.
As he suggests, most such pains
have their origin in inaccurate
or incomplete draft information
—some of which graced his own
column .
In the first place, . . . one
usually takes a physical examin
ation a month or two before in
duction. The Army won't induct
anyone unless they've passed
such an examination, either on
the spot or within the past year.
The innocuous government
document is not "Form AR 40-
501 . . . but "Army Regula
tion 40-501 . . . " —that's what
the AR stands for. This may bo
nitpicking, but ask your librar
ian for "Form AR 40-501. .
and see what happens. Incident
ally, this innocuous government
document is for sale by the Gov
ernment Printing Office as well
as the Anti-Draft Union.
The SS Regulations say that
one must "keep his local board
currently informed .... of his
physical condition" with no ifs,
but's, or maybe's about whether
the condition is acceptable to
the Army or not. . . . It's not
customary to sic the FBI on
people who fail in such responsi
bilities.
Instead, the draft is used to
punish them (without such in
conveniences as juries. . . ).
They are "declared delinquent,"
and ordered to report for induc
tion in about 30 days. That
sounds pretty scary, as it's no
doubt meant to, but there's a
catch.
The Army still won't take
them until they pass a physical
examination: if they've passed
one within the past year, fine;
otherwise they're given one on
the spot. So Newton Fenwick
would have 30 days to get back
up to his magnificent 220
pounds. . . .
