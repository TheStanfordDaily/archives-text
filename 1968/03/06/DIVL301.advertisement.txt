The Sovereign God of Israel
Embroiled as we ore in politics and religion, in social unrest and war, it
is all too easy to forget that God is in charge of history and that nothing
escapes his watchful eye or falls outside his sovereign control. Some of the
most majestic statements about God s power and unchecked power in the
affairs of men were penned by the Hebrew prophet Isaiah who spoke to the
Jews when their national power was waning and their enemies amassing on
the borders to carry them into captivity, more than six centuries before the
birth of Jesus Christ.
"Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off
the heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure and
weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance? Who has direc
ted the Spirit of the Lord, or as his counselor has instructed him? Whom did
he consult for his enlightenment, and who taught him the path of justice, and
taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of understanding? Behold,
the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as the dust on
the scales; behold he takes up the isles like fine dust. Lebanon would not
suffice for fuel, nor are its beasts enough for a burnt offering. All the na
tions are as nothing before him, they are accounted by him as less than
nothing and emptiness . . ."
"Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from
the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like
grasshoppers; who stretch out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them
like a tent to dwell in; who brings princes to nought, and makes the rulers of
the earth as nothing. Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, scarcely hos
their stem taken root in the earth, when he blows upon them, and they wither
away, and the tempest carries them off like stubble."
In spite of the awesome power and unlimited resourcefulness of God, Isa
iah continues to tell us that God enters history os the Messiah and Savior of
mankind in Jesus Christ (the name "Jesus" means "Jehovah is salvation,"
and "Christ" is from the Greek meaning "Messiah" or "Annointed One").
The mighty God of history is the defender of the weak and helpless, the
friend and companion of those who wait and trust in him;
"Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting
God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary,
his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and to him
who has no might he increases strength. Even youths shall faint and be weary,
and young men shall fall exhausted; but they who wait for the Lord shall re
new their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall
run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint" (Isaiah 40).

and "Christ" is from the Greek meaning "Messiah" or "Annointed One").
The mighty God of history is the defender of the weak and helpless, the
friend and companion of those who wait and trust in him;
"Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting
God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary,
his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and to him
who has no might he increases strength. Even youths shall faint and be weary,
and young men shall fall exhausted; but they who wait for the Lord shall re
new their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall
run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint" (Isaiah 40).
The Sovereign God of Israel
Embroiled as we ore in politics and religion, in social unrest and war, it
is all too easy to forget that God is in charge of history and that nothing
escapes his watchful eye or falls outside his sovereign control. Some of the
most majestic statements about God s power and unchecked power in the
affairs of men were penned by the Hebrew prophet Isaiah who spoke to the
Jews when their national power was waning and their enemies amassing on
the borders to carry them into captivity, more than six centuries before the
birth of Jesus Christ.
"Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off
the heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure and
weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance? Who has direc
ted the Spirit of the Lord, or as his counselor has instructed him? Whom did
he consult for his enlightenment, and who taught him the path of justice, and
taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of understanding? Behold,
the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as the dust on
the scales; behold he takes up the isles like fine dust. Lebanon would not
suffice for fuel, nor are its beasts enough for a burnt offering. All the na
tions are as nothing before him, they are accounted by him as less than
nothing and emptiness . . ."
"Have you not known? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from
the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth?
It is he who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like
grasshoppers; who stretch out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them
like a tent to dwell in; who brings princes to nought, and makes the rulers of
the earth as nothing. Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, scarcely hos
their stem taken root in the earth, when he blows upon them, and they wither
away, and the tempest carries them off like stubble."
In spite of the awesome power and unlimited resourcefulness of God, Isa
iah continues to tell us that God enters history os the Messiah and Savior of
mankind in Jesus Christ (the name "Jesus" means "Jehovah is salvation,"
and "Christ" is from the Greek meaning "Messiah" or "Annointed One").
