The Yale Russian Chorus
Averill Harriman: "I think the Yale Russian Chorus is one of the most
imaginative and penetrating programs of cultural exchange that has
been undertaken by government or private initiative. Everywhere I went
throughout Russia, I heard about the chorus, and everyone was very
much impressed."
Berliner Morgenpost, Berlin: "Under the fabulous and enviably well
trained voices, there are the typical falstto tenors who have no fear of
sopranic heights, and there are the 'sinister' basses who drone like deep
organ tones. And there is also the wild, primeval force which one other
wise gets only in the threat of the enigmatic from Cossack choirs."
USIA Cultural Attache, Paris: "A quite exceptional performance. It is rare
to see the critical Parisian audience rise to give a standing ovation, and
to hear them shout Bis' and Bravo' at the top of their lungs for minutes
on end."
Harvard Crimson: "The Yale Russian Chorus . . . carried off their most
challenging mission in cultural exchange last Saturday night. Few would
have guessed that Yalies would receive a standing ovation and demands
for half a dozen encores from a Harvard audience."
