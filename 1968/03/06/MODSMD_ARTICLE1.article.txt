## Courage Is Morality's Mark 
### KIRK HANSON 
Former Bishop James A. Pike
spoke to a capacity crowd in
Memorial Church last night, mix
ing comments on the paradoxes
facing Christianity today with
passioned pleas for courage,
truth, and opposition to the Viet
nam war.
Pike was Bishop of the Epis
copal Diocese of California from
1958 to 1966 and is now a staff
member of the Center for the
Study of Democratic Institutions
at Santa Barbara.
Pike told his audience cour
age and not conformity is the
test of modern morality.
"Morals have meant 'do
what you are told, conform,
keep whatever rules appear to
be dominant in the culture you

live and breathe in.' But mor
als have something to do with
courage, to taking a risk, to
loving, to that very dangerous
thing of allowing yourself to
be loved."
One of the most liberal church
men in the country, Pike'has
been accused of heresy in the
Episcopal church for rejecting
traditional beliefs. Last night he
emphasized the limits of possible
belief.
In discussing where a Christ
ian is to get his basis for affirm
ing things, he discarded the
Bible, asking "where do you get
the authority to decide which
books to accept?" He rejected
meetings of bishops and coun
cils, saying "I've been to them
and while some enjoy them more

than others, no one would call
them infallible."
Pike hailed "the primacy of
fact" in belief today, but admit
ted this is "devastating to the
conventional believer, to the one
who doesn't like to let go of the
security blanket."
He stated beliefs today must
be arrived at through the em
pirical formula. Data is collected
and inferences are drawn from
these. These inferences enable
men to make few affirmations.
Pike told his audience they
might take any number of af
firmations, but that he could
make but three: the existence
of a personal One in the uni
verse; that man transcends
space and time, that he prob
ably survives death, and that
the dead and living may com
municate; that man creates a
style of life just by choosing
what he likes.
"I don't know that much
more can be affirmed," he said.
Pike often returned to the sub
ject of the Vietnam war to ex
press his opposition and his frus
tration at the immorality of the
conflict.
At one point he said: "I al
ways take the opportunity, when
my audience has a large number
of men of draft age, to commit
further felonies by urging their
resistance to the draft. For the
record, I urge you to follow
your enlightened consciences.
Don't turn yourself over to LBJ,
to Bob Brown, or to James Pike.
Later he said, "It's better to
spend many years in the peni
tentiary than to participate in
the killing of one person."
Where is religious belief go
ing? "To become whole, to be
come free — it means to be
come content with less elabor
ate schemes of answers. We will
find our security in the practice
of courage, in the familiarity
of love."
