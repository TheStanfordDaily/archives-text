# The
						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Romney Saw Rockefeller Using Him 
### Drew Pearson 
The real reason George Rom
ney abruptly retrieved his hat
from the Presidential ring, ac
cording to his closest confidants,
was the discovery that Nelson
Rockefeller was using him.
The Michigan governor, who
places a high premium on per
sonal honor, told confidants
fiercely that he did not intend to
become a stalking horse for
Rockefeller.
Romney's decision, no doubt,
was also influenced by his poor

showing in the New Hampshire
polls. However, it is against his
nature to quit, and he had re
solved earlier to continue his
fight for the Republican nomina
tion no matter what the New
Hampshire outcome.
He had been given what he
felt was Rockefeller's "sacred
pledge" to support him up to
the final vote at the GOP con
vention. Evidence that Rocke
feller couldn't keep this "sacred
pledge"—more than the dis

couraging news from New
Hampshire — led to Romney's
withdrawal.
Romney's Offer
Rockefeller insisted that he
had been emotionally drained of
any desire to become President.
Once his wife Happy interject
ed: "We're not going down that
road again." She referred to
Rockefeller's experience at the
1964 convention when he faced
a hall full of hostile, howling,
conservative delegates who
booed, hissed, and yelled obsceni
ties at him. Some had leaped on
their chairs, angrily waving dol
lar bills when he tried to speak.
The subject of Romney's pull
out came up again during the
conference cruise last fall on the
SS Independence. Three times on
shipboard Romney cited his de
cline in the polls and offered to
withdraw in Rockefeller's favor.
But Rockefeller persuaded Rom
ney to stay in the race, prom
ising to fight for him till the
last vote was counted at the Re
publican convention.
Rockefeller also promised to
line up his backers, Gov. Spiro
Agnew of Maryland and his
brother, Gov. Winthrop Rocke
feller of Arkansas, behind the
Romney candidacy.
Rocky For Rocky?
Reports began to leak back to
Romney, however, that Rocke
feller was quietly assessing his
own convention strength. In one

confif'ential conversation, Rocke
feller told a trusted adviser that
he thought eleven of the Repub
lican governors would support
him for the nomination.
Rockefeller's recent statement
in Detroit that he would accept
a draft was the last straw.
This coincided with the depres
sing polls in New Hampshire;
so, without consulting Rockefel
ler, the Michigan governor an
nounced his decision to with
draw.
The Rockefeller forces, as soon
as they got wind of Romney's
intention, tried to persuade him
to stay in the race. This word
was passed by George Hinman,
Rockefeller's chief political ad
vised, to Leonard Hall, whom
Rockefeller had persuaded to
serve as Romney's campaign
manager.
Chance For Selection
But Romney's mind was made
up. He also felt an obligation to
rush out an announcement be
fore the governors met last
week in Washington, so the GOP
governors could use the occasion
to seek another candidate.
His announcement threw the
conference into turmoil. In the
"smoke-filled" back rooms,
Rhode Island's Gov. John Cha
fee urged the adoption of a reso
lution calling upon Rockefeller
to run. This was also pushed in
the back rooms by Oregon's
Gov. Tom McCall.

Rockefeller himself met with
his brother Winthrop, Mary
land's Agnew, and adviser Hin
man. They agreed it would be a
mistake to seek a statement of
support from the governors,
who could hardly commit them
selves without consulting their
own political advisers at home.
Rockefeller repeated his esti
mate that he could expect the
support of eleven governors.
Agnew predicted that before the
convention they could line up
eighteen. If the governors failed
to unite behind a candidate, it
was agreed, they would cease to
be an effective voice inside the
party and may as well abdicate
to the Congressional wing of
the party.
Agreeing with this, Rockefel
ler made it clear he would not
become a candidate unless the
majority of GOP governors en
dorsed him. It seems likely that
they will do so.
