## Problem Of Rising Elevators 
### Art Buchwald 
President Lyndon Johnson had
one of his better days last Thurs
day. He was stuck in an eleva
tor in the Pentagon for 12 min
utes and finally had to crawl
up and out with retiring Sec
retary of Defense Robert Mc-
Namara. Ordinarily, this could
have been a very embarrassing
situation for the Commander-in-
Chief, but, unfortunately, a con
tingency plan had been worked
out for just such an occasion.
As soon as it was announced
that the President had been
stuck in the elevator, a White
House background press briefing
was called. Walt Rostow, the
President's aide, told reporters
that the President had been
planning for some time to get
stuck in a Pentagon elevator,
and it came as no surprise to
anyone in the government that
it had happened at this time.
"The fact that the President
was only stuck for 12 minutes
is proof that the faulty elevator
failed to accomplish its mission.
We consider this the death rat
tle for all the elevators in the
Pentagon."
The News Angle
At the very moment that Ros
tow was holding this back
grounder, Dean Rusk was being
questioned about the elevator
at a press conference at the State
Department. He said:

"Instead of you reporters writ
ing about one bad elevator that
went wrong, why don't you write
about all the other elevators
that were working at that time?
Why don't you print something
good about American elevators
for a change, rather than al
ways what's wrong with them?"
A reporter said the fact that
the President's elevator wasn't
working was news; the fact
that the other elevators were
working wasn't news.
Flushed, Rusk turned to the
reporter and said, "Whose side
are you on?"
Gen. Earle Wheeler, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
that more troops would have to
be provided for the elevators,
and he said the military leaders
advocated the calling up of all
elevator reserves.
Meanwhile back at the Senate,
Sens. Fulbright and Morse chas
tised the Administration for es
calating the elevator when it
got stuck. Fulbright said the
President should have sent the
elevator down instead of up.
Morse, on the other hand, said
the elevator shouldn't have been
there in the first place.
Belief In Policy
Vice President Hubert Hum
phrey, who was speaking in Chi
cago again, told the Optimists'
Club:

"Nobody wants to get out of
a stuck elevator more than the
President. But at the same time
Mr. Johnson has made a commit
ment to the Free World which
he intends to honor; and if this
means getting stuck in a Pen
tagon elevator, he will do it,
because he believes it is the
right thing to do."
During the 12 minutes that
the President was stuck in the
elevator, Lou Harris took a poll
with the following results:
Sixty-seven per cent said they
thought the President was do
ing a good job running the Pen
tagon elevators, 20 per cent
thought someone else could do a
better job and 13 per cent said
they had "no opinion."
When asked if the President
should get out of the elevator,
35 per cent said he should get
out, 34 per cent said he should
stay in and 31 per cent said they
didn't think it would make any
difference.
During the wait, the President
turned to Secretary McNamara
and said: "Well, Bob, what the
hâ€” happened now?"
And Secretary McNamara is
said to have replied in a halt
ing voice full of emotion: "Mr.
President, I cannot find words
to express what lies in my heart
today. I think I had better re
spond on another occasion."
