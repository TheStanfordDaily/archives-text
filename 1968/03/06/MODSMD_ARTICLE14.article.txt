# Two Minutes of Haight
## Choose Sides For Coming Conflicts 
### Tim Haight 
Violence is terrible. Everybody
knows that. Equally, everybody
knows that violence is. Love
isn't. Violence is.
We destroy cities to save
them. "They are making a des
ert and call it peace"—Tacitus.
We make laws that channel our
men into some institution—the
army, jail, the university, the in
sane asylum—or into self-im
posed exile.
We destroy the Citadel of Hue.
(Don't call it the Alamo—that's
subversive.) We deplore the Viet
Cong's breaking the Tet truce.
(Don't remember what night
Washington crossed the Dela
ware—that's subversive, too.)
What is worse, we see the
promise of more violence and
do little. A Presidential commis
sion has practically predicted
civil war right here in the
United States unless massive re
forms are taken, and who is
heading that violence off? Not
our Congress with its watered
down openhousing clause (let
alone the massive program
needed). And not the Public. Not
even Stanford students.
Choosing Sides
OK. So violence is. If violence
is, which side are you on? That's
what it comes to. If you think
it's an obscene question, you're
right. But what are you doing
to avoid having to choose sides?
Which side am I on? Well I
won't be a cop and I won't be a
soldier and I won't be a Minute
man helping out. And I won't
shut up or look the other way
when they come around here
looking for subversives. That
doesn't leave much.
It's coming to that. The Com
munists are jumping for joy.
They know that when it's down

to a no-way-out choice between
them or the National Guard that
they'll get their share of re
cruits. For the blacks this is the
year of the Panther. You'd bet
ter buy yourself a gun.
Resulting Crisis
That's what's happening.
Death. Violence. Men turned into
animals. Tanks in the streets.
The Flower Child becomes the
guerrilla. Face it. Which side
are you on?
Are you on the side of the
people who want to work all
your life so you can raise your
kids to feel they have to work
all their lives? Are you on the
side of the gentle people who
ran the Nuremberg Trials, who
deplore Guernica and Dresden
and the Warsaw ghetto but who
tolerate Vietnam?
Are you on the side of the in
stitutions that even a Presiden
tial commission now admits are
based on "White racism"? Are
you on the side of the CIA? Do
you support the Oakland cops
in the way they acted at the in
duction center that Tuesday?
Oh no. You're not on that side.
But all this talk about violence.
You don't dig violence either.
But violence Ls, and what are
you doing to stop it?
Safe Way Out
You're trusting to the ineffi
ciency of your draft board. Or
looking to OCS. You're finding
your safe place. But will it be
safe? Probably. More get killed
on the highways than in war.
And you can turn off your TV.
But the state of the Union will
be open, uninstitutionalized vio
lence. And suppression will be
necessary. Maybe someone you
knew will be taken. Of course,
you won't admit then that you

knew him.
Am I being overdramatic?
What's to stop it? The polls say
seven out of ten Americans call
themselves hawks. The radicals
are bombing the NROTC (or so
it's said). Somewhere a poor,
bearded man will be found with
a Molotov cocktail and a Red
Guard button. In Hitler's day it
was an insane Dutch Commu
nist they accused of burning the
Reichstag.
Remember that analogy. It

wasn't the Communists who did
the violence in Germany, al
though they did have riots and
threatened worse. It was the
good nationalist reaction to that
violence that gave Hitler his
powers and started the trip.
They call us neo-Fascists—for
throwing a few bottles at the
men in the high boots with the
helmets and clubs. For not look
ing the other way about Viet
nam.
So choose your side. Buy a

gun. Get ready to kill. You can't
sit it out. The soldiers and cops
will kill in your name. They will
kill the people who are more
morally right than they are.
They will kill to allow the Con
gress to save money at home so
we can afford to kill abroad.
Get ready to kill. Or? There
it is. The way out. Or get mov
ing as you have never moved be
fore. Stop this thing somehow.
But the odds are against you.
Violence Is.
