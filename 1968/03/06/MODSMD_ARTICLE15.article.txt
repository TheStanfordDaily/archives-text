# The 						Nebbish Speaks
## Non-Candidates Please Public 
### Marshall Schwartz 
Once there was a governor,
Rocky Nelson by name, who did
n't want to be President.
"I do not want to be Presi
dent," he proclaimed again and
again. But nobody believed him,
because they all knew that the
dream of every poor American
boy is to someday be President.
"But I'm not a poor American
boy," Rocky protested.
The people considered this for
a while, and decided that being
President was the dream of
every rich American boy, too.
But they loved him because
he said he wasn't running. The
people thought he was modest,
and it's always nice to have a
modest President, especially a
modest rich President.
Besides, they said, there's
nothing quite as boring as a
Presidential candidate. A non
candidate is always better.
Non-Candidate Stance
So Rocky sat back, and left
the campaigning and speeches to
others. "Let George do it,"he
said.
So George did it. But, alas, he
didn't do it very well.
"The people seem to like
Rocky's not campaigning, so I
guess I'll do the same thing,"
George said.
Unfortunately for George, the
people liked non-candidates not
to campaign. As for candidates,
well, that was another question.
Tradition demanded that they
speak their mind and state their
opinions on vital issues.
George did neither of these,

possibly because he had no mind
to speak and no opinions to state.
When he finally realized this
(or maybe it was after some
one pointed it out to him), Geo
rge decided to withdraw, the
first firm stand he had taken
throughout his campaign.
And so the people applauded
him. This time it was because
he was now a non-candidate, and
acting like one.
Rocky, far-sighted young man
that he was, had seen what was
coming days in advance.
"George doesn't want to do it
anymore, it seems. Therefore I'll
have to do something," he
thought to himself.
So Rocky decided to announce
that he still didn't really want
to be President, but if his party
really wanted him, he would
serve. "I still won't be a candi
date, and the people will still
love me," he thought.
And sure enough he was right.
He said the same thing a few
days later when George finally
pulled out, and the people loved
him even more.
More Non-Candidates
Now this started some strange
reactions. All the other candi
dates sat down and thought
about what was going on. "They
only like candidates who aren't
candidates," the candidates said.
As a result, there was a sud
den rash of withdrawals. Tricky
Dick, Eugene McPeacenik, and
even Good Old Harold Whatshis
name dropped out of the race.
Not one willing to be left be

hind in the popularity polls, the
President himself announced
that he would not be a candidate
for reelection. Naturally, his
popularity soared.
All of a sudden, everybody
loved all the new non-candidates.
And all the non-candidates,
basking in their new-found popu
larity, declared they would never
become candidates again.
Unfortunately, they went a
bit too far. One candidate some
how never bothered to with
draw. "Ah, don* wanna be loved,"
he said.
So that November, the other
George got elected.
And nobody loved anybody
any more.
