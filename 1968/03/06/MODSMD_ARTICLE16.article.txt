Editor, The Daily:
Apparently many people have
mistaken the intent of the rec
ent legislature resolution call
ing for a day long demonstra
tion April 11 "to protest the
draft and show concern about
the war in Vietnam."
We feel it is important to em
phasize that the demonstration
is not a strike against the Uni
versity but rather a day for
campus-wide discussion and pro
test. The resolution is purposely
worded broadly enough to in
volve as many members of the
Stanford community as possible.

Why Should We
Protest Draft Noiv?
Editor, The Daily:
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
I have the impression that the
institutions of higher learning

in this country have been living
happily with the draft for some
years.
I also have the impression
that there has not been a single
official protest of the Selective
Service Act from any college or
university. This has been left to
students (who naturally like to
get their jollies by protesting),
and to an occasional kook on
the faculty, despite the racist
Implications of the draft laws
and their wholesome dispensa
tion, in the past, of the privi
leged.
Then, all of a sudden, there
arises such a clatter that I
spring from my beads to see
what is the matter. Every col
lege administrator in the land
is right out of his mind with
pain. The scene is a regular
Anacin advertisement. They are
lined up in front of the TV cam
eras to tell of the agony visited
on their shops by the new draft
law. The cry of pain, which
principle could not wring from
them, finally crosses the barrier
of their teeth. They are in deep
economic trauma.
The colleges are asked to
share the real burden of a war
to which they have contributed
so much technical expertise.
I'm afraid I've been making
an incorrect deduction from
their long silence. I've assumed
that they rather liked the swell
agony of a war which brings
large infusions of federal gravy.
Now they say they don't and
I'm confused.
Well! Hold a place in the line
at the Induction Center for
them. Walking is said to be
therapeutic in the relief of pain
due to economically inflicted
wounds.

Topless Dancing Class
Can't Make A College
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Genie Kreyche reported
my talk in the "Century 21"
series very well. One sentence
bothers me, however. "He cited
courses 'Field Techniques in
Establishing Rapport,' The Col
lege and War,' and 'Topless
Dancing' offered at San Fran
cisco State as the results from
'dissatisfaction with the conven
tional structure.' "
I fear that a course in "Top
less Dancing" is too frivolous a
representation of what I had in
mind. Such a course (non
credit) was listed last autumn
among the course offerings of
The Experimental College.
Whether the course actually ma
terialized and, if so, what it is
like, I do not know.
At any rate, I doubt that a
course in "Topless Dancing" will
contribute to the kinds of free
dom, spontaneity, and joy I
should like to see in our lives
and in our universities.

Perhaps you can enlighten
my dim mind by explaining how
one abuses drugs? Some drugs
are illegal, but this has no bear

ness of their, consumption. The
correct term is obviously 'illegal
drug usage'.
Can't even the newspapers

Protest Draft Noiv?
Editor, The Daily:
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
I have the impression that the
institutions of higher learning

in this country have been living
happily with the draft for some
years.
I also have the impression
that there has not been a single
official protest of the Selective
Service Act from any college or
university. This has been left to
students (who naturally like to
get their jollies by protesting),
and to an occasional kook on
the faculty, despite the racist
Implications of the draft laws
and their wholesome dispensa
tion, in the past, of the privi
leged.
Then, all of a sudden, there
arises such a clatter that I
spring from my beads to see
what is the matter. Every col
lege administrator in the land
is right out of his mind with
pain. The scene is a regular
Anacin advertisement. They are
lined up in front of the TV cam
eras to tell of the agony visited
on their shops by the new draft
law. The cry of pain, which
principle could not wring from
them, finally crosses the barrier
of their teeth. They are in deep
economic trauma.
The colleges are asked to
share the real burden of a war
to which they have contributed
so much technical expertise.
I'm afraid I've been making
an incorrect deduction from
their long silence. I've assumed
that they rather liked the swell
agony of a war which brings
large infusions of federal gravy.
Now they say they don't and
I'm confused.
Well! Hold a place in the line
at the Induction Center for
them. Walking is said to be
therapeutic in the relief of pain
due to economically inflicted
wounds.

Topless Dancing Class
Can't Make A College
Editor, The Daily:
Miss Genie Kreyche reported
my talk in the "Century 21"
series very well. One sentence
bothers me, however. "He cited
courses 'Field Techniques in
Establishing Rapport,' The Col
lege and War,' and 'Topless
Dancing' offered at San Fran
cisco State as the results from
'dissatisfaction with the conven
tional structure.' "
I fear that a course in "Top
less Dancing" is too frivolous a
representation of what I had in
mind. Such a course (non
credit) was listed last autumn
among the course offerings of
The Experimental College.
Whether the course actually ma
terialized and, if so, what it is
like, I do not know.
At any rate, I doubt that a
course in "Topless Dancing" will
contribute to the kinds of free
dom, spontaneity, and joy I
should like to see in our lives
and in our universities.

Perhaps you can enlighten
my dim mind by explaining how
one abuses drugs? Some drugs
are illegal, but this has no bear
ing upon the Tightness or wrong
ness of their, consumption. The
correct term is obviously 'illegal
drug usage'.
Can't even the newspapers

Apparently many people have
mistaken the intent of the rec

ing for a day long demonstra
tion April 11 "to protest the
draft and show concern about
the war in Vietnam."
We feel it is important to em
phasize that the demonstration
is not a strike against the Uni
versity but rather a day for
campus-wide discussion and pro
test. The resolution is purposely
worded broadly enough to in
volve as many members of the
