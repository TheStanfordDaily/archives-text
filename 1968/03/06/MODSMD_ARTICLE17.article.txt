# Seymour Bagley Active On Campus
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
Following in the footsteps of
renowned Warren and Wendy
Wonka, Seymour Bagley has en
rolled at Stanford.
Seymour, a graduate student,
transferred from Cal in the be
ginning of winter quarter and
moved into Branner Hall.
His first act as a Stanford
student was to post a sign-up
list on the bulletin board for his
seminar. "The Chemical Basis
of Morphology and its Impact
on the Statistical Methodology
of the Now Generation."
Interested students tried to
get in touch with Seymour Bag
ley in his room, Room 122, but
to no avail. They dismissed the
entreaties of the house-keeper
to stop beating on the door of
what she claimed was the bag
gage room. Frustrated, they de
cided to reach him by telephone.
The operator said she had his
name and number listed, but
the number was missing from
the switchboard.
Rumors about Seymour grew
rampant, although no one had
met him. Branner residents
were eager to catch a glimpse
of the supposedly 6'3" musta
choied man.
Then in the dining room
appeared what may be the
most valuable contribution to
Stanford made this year —
THE BAGLEY BULLETIN, a
copyrighted publication dedi
cated to giving "Today's Dirt
Today." These mimeographed
bulletins, edited by Seymour,
have been published nine
times this quarter. These In
clude two special editions for
Valentine's Day and for
George Washington's Birth
day.
Excerpts alone can character
ize this ineffable paper which

set forth Its goals in the first
edition.
"Are you tired of reading the
same biased, pseudo-imperialis
tic, neo-medieval, zombie-men
talitied journals often appearing
on the Stanford campus like
The Daily, the poop sheet, the
observer, and countless other
archaic tabulations? Are you
tired of hearing only the Estab
lishment's line and nothing
from the progressive students of
Stanford? If so, you are like
countless others who can no
longer stand the stench of these
purveyors of verbal vomit.
"Some of us are doing some
thing about the situation, e.g.
the soon to be famous BAGLEY
BULLETIN, Mouthpiece of Stan
ford's only objective news ser
vice."
After being attacked by the
Wilbur Poop Sheet, The Bagley
Bulletin published this editorial
in rebuttal:
"I sometimes wonder about
the state of our university. In
recent weeks one of the most
Intellectually sensitive tab
loids ever to arise has been
ruthlessly censored. Yes, there
are some people who cannot
stand to see the truth in pur
ple and white.
"These people (I use that
word lightly), who may be
agents of the fascist bureaucracy
that dominates us or even of
the wilbur - branner-roble poop
sheet as it euphemistically labels
itself, have been doing all in
their power to keep the truth
from the masses. TTiese people
(?) have, gasp, tried TO SUP
PRESS THE BAGLEY BULLE
TIN.
"Impossible, you say, at the
Harvard of the West? Not so.
Let me give you an example. In
an unnamed corridor of an un

named boys dormitory, the Bul
letin was proudly posted above
the urinal in the bathroom, so
as to insure good reader cover
age. When the Bulletin courier
came by a few days later to
post a new issue, he found that
the post had been taken from
its rightful position and deposit
ed IN the urinal. It was a truly
traumatic experience."
"The Bulletin announces, once
and for all, that it will not be
intimidated by such police-state
tactics. On the contrary, circu
lation will henceforth be tripled,
so the crying masses will not be
denied that which they hold so
dear."
With the recent ASSU presi
dential campaigns, the Bulletin
became politically oriented:
"As many astute political
observers have long suspected,
I, Seymour Bagley, am a can
didate for ASSU vice-president
I have refrained from making
any political statements up
until this point, because I
wanted to feel out the mood
of the voters. The mood is ob
viously one of total apathy.
Therefore, I will take up the
banner of the thousands of un
represented Stanford students
who could care less who Is
elected A.S.S.U.V.P."
"If elected, I promise to do
absolutely nothing (in the tra
dition of my predecessors), but
unlike my predecessors, I will
make no pretenses about my in
action. Admittedly, there wiU be
less petty charges made about
the fascists in the administration,
hippies, excessive cheering at
athletic contests, and the Stan
ford Band for the Daily to quote
but there will be no less news.
Students Unite!
"Write in SEYMOUR BAG
LEY's name on the ballot and
together we can defeat the Gen
eral Organization-oriented-type
fanatics who are trying to use
the bureaucratic obscurity of
the honored office of vice-presi
dency as a political stepping
stone to the bureaucratic obscur
ity of the office of the presidency.
A later article covered the elec
tion returns:
"In a close election last week,
Seymour Bagley lost the elec
tion for A.S.S.U.V.P. But did he
really fail? The answer would
have to be an emphatic no! Sure,
the other candidates polled more
votes, but look how many votes
they didn't get. Seymour won
the hearts of all the apathetic
students in he Stanford commu
nity who don't care about
A.S.S.U. and who didn't bother
to vote in the election.
"Every one of the thousands
of votes not cast was a vote for
apathy. Since Seymour Bagley
is the embodiment of the spirit
of apathy; he won a moral vic
tory in that so many of his de
votees carried through his plat
form to its logical conclusion.
There is still some justice in this
chaotic world we inhabit."
Seymour did get 5 votes in the
preliminary voting, according to
The Dally.
Besides editorials, "the Bag
ley Bulletin" usually contains
a Quote for the Day, Inside
Tip Department, the Soon to
Be Announced Department the
Cultural Department and less
frequently, the Sad News De
partment, the Seymour Says
Department the Threats De
partment, and the BSBS Re

port (Bagley Study of Build
ings at Stanford). Most of the
articles are accompanied by
Illustrations and cartoons.
Quoting from a recent contro
versial Quote for the Day:
"For what doth it profit a man
if he gains the world, but loses
his soul?"

Includ d among the announce
ments was the following:
"Also the police department
tells us that the escaped rapist
who has been terrorizing so
many Stanford women lately is
now behind bars (Joe's Bar &
Grill and the Kitty Kat Lounge
on weekends just in case you
want to meet this interesting per
sonality.)"

Inside Tips have Included
Lambda Nu's proposal to go
coed before THE DAILY re
ported it, three row houses be
coming coed, and the coming
visit of an astronaut on cam*
pus. THE BAGLEY BULLE
TIN has also hinted at CIA
infiltration in the Wilbur Of
fice.
Perhaps the most newsworthy
articles of the Bagley Bulletin
have dealt with housing:
"Today we have more excerpts

from the Bagley Study of Build
ings at Stanford:
"The committee has come up
with a solution to the existing
housing problem. There will be
no room or dormitory assign
ments. There will be no estab
lished fraternities as such. No
houses will be designated coed
or non-coed. On the day before
registration, all students who
want to live on campus will line
up on El Camino.
"Upon a given signal (a flare
will be dropped off Hoo Tow),
students will be allowed to cross
El Camino. Each student will
be allowed to stake out a claim
to any room or rooms he wants.
If he wants coed living, all he
has to do is talk some girls into
moving in next door.
If he wants frat living, all
he has to do Is guard the front
door of whatever building he
has seized and let only his
friends in. If he wants pent
house • type accommodations,
all he has to do is stake out as
many rooms as are necessary.
If he is the hippie communal
type, he can share the cost
of his room with as many
roommates as he wants.
"All those who are not able
to room in existing University
residences, will be allowed to
set up tents on White Plaza.
Quite obviously, this plan will
satisfy the needs of most stu
dents, and is therefore recom
mended for immediate passage."
No one knows the future of
The Barley Bulletin. However,
its avid readers hope to see mor 1
of it and its editor, who is grad
ua'ly becoming a Stanford le
gend.

WILL THE REAL SEYMOUR BAGLEY PLEASE STAND UP? —
Actually, both of these anonymous Branner residents are Seymour
Bagley. But they insist on remaining anonymous, to the frustration
of the Poop Sheet editors.
