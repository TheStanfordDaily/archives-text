# Law Prof Views Obscenity Rulings
## 
### JOHN ALCORN 
"The really interesting ques
tion about obscenity is who con
sumes it. What the Court is
regulating is a form of sexual
consumption."
This was the opinion of Harry
Kalven, Jr., a professor of law
at the University of Chicago,
who spoke before a small group
Monday night in the large lounge
at Tresidder.
Kalven devoted the greater
part of a talk about "The
First Amendment in the Last
Decade: Libel and Obscenity"
to an analysis of recent ob
scenity rulings, but he did
point out several things that
both libel and obscenity have
in common in regard to the
First Amendment
"The First Amendment must
be the purest example of the
Constitutional function of the
judiciary," Kalven asserted. He
emphasized that "philosopher's
issues concerning free speech are
at a great distance from the is
sues the Supreme Court deals
with."
"Can any single principle ever
solve the problems in both libel
and obscenity?" Kalven asked.
He replied that "the solution to
libel is not necessarily the solu
tion to obscenity, and vice ver
sa."
The Chicago professor said
that there is no real need to have
a single principle behind both
libel and obscenity rulings since
"the law has a great tolerance
of inconsistencies."
Noting that for the first 150
years of its history the Supreme
Court never had a case on ob
scenity, Kalven explained that
the whole issue "came in with
Queen Victoria" in the middle
of the 19th century.
"Explicit development of no
tions regarding the First
Amendment occurred In 1917,"
when the Court declared the
free speech principle could be
curtailed when "clear and pres
ent dangers" arose from the

proliferation of ideas.
Kalven said that the Court
gradually developed four cri
terion for the regulation of ob
scenity: avert literature advo
cating anti-social conduct, ma
terial that was "simply repul
sive," material that contained
"improper moral notions," and
literature in which "evil was
exciting the imagination."
The Court was "spectacularly
vague" when, in the Roth case
of the 1950's it "sidestepped" the
issue of defining obscenity, but
concurred that some regulation
of obscenity is constitutionally
permissible.
Kalven claimed for a while it
seemed that the Court would
permit virtually the printing of
anything, since an explicit defi
nition of obscenity was appar
ently impossible to arrive at.
But he said he was very sur
prised when recently the Court
found Ralph Ginzberg guilty of
obscenity for publishing Eros
magazine. After meticulously
probing the problem, Kalven
rhetorically asked, "In the end,
doesn't vagueness win the
battle?"
