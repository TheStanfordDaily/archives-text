# Overseas Openings
## 
### 
For the first time, places are
open for any qualified under
graduate women to Join over
seas campus groups that leave
later this month.
Due to a lower application
rate than usual, about nine
places are open for women in
Italy, Group XVI, and Austria,
Group VI, both which leave for
Europe on March 28.
This experiment does not bar
those who have already attended
an overseas campus from apply
ing again.
"So many people who have re
turned from an overseas campus
have said, 'I wish I could do It
again,' that we decided we'd give
it a try," explained George
Hamrdla, assistant to the direc
tor of the overseas campuses.
Hamrdla said that Instead of
the usual 15 alternates for each
group, the current Italy and
Austria groups had less than

ten alternates each. "The usual
attrition rate left us with open
ings," Hamrdla commented.
The lower application rate for
the two groups is not indicative
of a lowered popularity of the
overseas campuses, Hamrdla
feels, since the France group
that also leaves this month is
filled and has a sufficiently long
alternate list.
Women who are interested in
applying for the current open
ings must have attained sopho
more standing by the end of the
current quarter, must have com
pleted the language requirement
of two quarters of the relevant
language, and must currently be
in good academic standing.
Applications, which are avail
able at the Overseas Campus
Office, are due by Monday,
March 11. Decisions on partici
pation will be announced on
Tuesday, March 12.
