# Colleges Turning To Stocks To Meet Higher Expenses
## 
### JOHN CUNNIFF (AP Business Analyst) 
NEW YORK (AP) —The math
ematical realities involved in the
cost of education are causing
colleges to take a hopeful but
critical look at their stock hold
ings. The purpose: bigger capi
tal gains.
Yale University has arranged
for professionals in Boston to
handle its portfolio. And the
University of Chicago, which al
ready has made big profits in un
usual investments, is now using
its on-campus brainpower to in
vest "more aggressively."
Behind this quest of colleges
Ls a desperate need for funds,
for neither tuitioa nor gifts
nor even tax advantages come
close to meeting expenses of
most higher education plants.
If trends to higher expenses
continue, in fact, many private
ly run colleges may be absorbed
into state systems or close their
doors or simply fall apart,
crushed by bills that force stan
dards to bend and facilities to
crack.
At Chicago, a relatively
wealthy school with an endow
ment of nearly $300 million, the
income from investments last
year totaled $10.3 million, or less

than 9 per cent of the year's
operating expenses of $115.5 mil
lion.
That the stock market may
rescue some schools certainly
will do no harm to Wall Street's
image, which over the years has
been associated with acquisition
rather than charity, with imme
diate goals rather than higher
aspirations.
But it's a tough game the col
leges are entering. Are they able
to play it?
A study of endowment hold
ings, released this week by the
Boston Fund, shows much
good Judgment already exists,
for the most commonly held
stocks are IBM, General Mo
tors and Standard Oil New
Jersey.
However, this doesn't mean
that real losers aren't also in
portfolios, and the suspicion and
even stronger hope exists that
much improvement can be made
in the yearly return on invest
ments.
One year ago McGeorge Bun
dy, Ford Foundation president,
remarked that a one per cent im
provement in the performance
of higher education's $12 billion
stock portfolio would mean $120
million additional each year.
One per cent is not much com
pared with 100 per cent gains
last year by some mutual funds.
That one per cent seems even
smaller when it is realized that
some college portfolios are mere
ly held — seldom reviewed and,
like old theses, not even taken
off the shelves for dusting.
There are some excuses for
this. Many college endow
ments contain the provision
that capital must not be used,
that Interest only can be spent
Thus, slow moving stocks pay
ing good dividends are accu
mulated.
In addition, the pressing need
for steady income, as from divi

dends, inhibits the ability to in
vest in growth stocks of the kind
that have paced the bull market
of the 19605. Many growth
stocks pay small dividends or
none at all.

NEW YORK (AP) —The math
ematical realities involved in the
cost of education are causing
colleges to take a hopeful but
critical look at their stock hold
ings. The purpose: bigger capi
tal gains.
Yale University has arranged
for professionals in Boston to
handle its portfolio. And the
University of Chicago, which al
ready has made big profits in un
usual investments, is now using
its on-campus brainpower to in
vest "more aggressively."
Behind this quest of colleges
Ls a desperate need for funds,
for neither tuitioa nor gifts
nor even tax advantages come
close to meeting expenses of
most higher education plants.
If trends to higher expenses
continue, in fact, many private
ly run colleges may be absorbed
into state systems or close their
doors or simply fall apart,
crushed by bills that force stan
dards to bend and facilities to
crack.
At Chicago, a relatively
wealthy school with an endow
ment of nearly $300 million, the
income from investments last
year totaled $10.3 million, or less

than 9 per cent of the year's
operating expenses of $115.5 mil
lion.
That the stock market may
rescue some schools certainly
will do no harm to Wall Street's
image, which over the years has
been associated with acquisition
rather than charity, with imme
diate goals rather than higher
aspirations.
But it's a tough game the col
leges are entering. Are they able
to play it?
A study of endowment hold
ings, released this week by the
Boston Fund, shows much
good Judgment already exists,
for the most commonly held
stocks are IBM, General Mo
tors and Standard Oil New
Jersey.
However, this doesn't mean
that real losers aren't also in
portfolios, and the suspicion and
even stronger hope exists that
much improvement can be made
in the yearly return on invest
ments.
One year ago McGeorge Bun
dy, Ford Foundation president,
remarked that a one per cent im
provement in the performance
of higher education's $12 billion
stock portfolio would mean $120
million additional each year.
One per cent is not much com
pared with 100 per cent gains
last year by some mutual funds.
