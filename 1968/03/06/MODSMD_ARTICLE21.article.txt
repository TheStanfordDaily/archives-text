# O'Casey's 'Cock-A-Doodle’ Will Open Tonight At SRT
## 
### 
"Cock-A Doodle Dandy," Sean
O'Casey's spoof on parochial
Irish village life, opens tonight
at Stanford Repertory Theater.
Written in 1949, O'Casey's "fa
vorite play," as he was to call
it, uses a mixture of song and
dance to emphasize its jibes at
religious and political institu
tions in Ireland.
The conflicts between the old
er traditionalists and the rebels
of the younger generation is pro
voked and enlivened by the Cock
himself, a symbol of vitality and
fertility, who prances in and
out of the scene's action.
Under the direction of truest
artist Charles Olsen, Norbert
Davidson will play the Cock
with Gerald Hiken as Michael
Marthraum and Paul E. Rich
ards as Sailor Mahan.
The play will run through

March 16 with performances in
Memorial Auditorium Wednes
day through Saturday nights at
8 o'clock and a matinee perfor

mance Saturday, March 9 at 2
p.m. Tickets are available at Tre
sidder Union Box Office on the
Stanford campus.
