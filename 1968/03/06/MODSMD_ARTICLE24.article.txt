# No More Late Nights
## Sleep Key To Griffin's Performance? 
### DAVE NOLAND 
In many ways, this has been
a dissappointing season for
Stanford basketballer Don Grif
fin. After coming on strong last
year to lead the team in scoring
and earn second string All-Con
ference honors as a sophomore,
Griff has been plagued this sea
son with cold shooting spells
that have limited his point out
put to less than twelve per
game.
A spectacular two-game 45-
point performance against Ore
gon State and Oregon raised
hopes that Griffin might have
shaken off his early season dol
drums for good. But last week
end he managed just twelve
points for two games, and was
held without a field goal by
UCLA.
Griffin himself can't pre

clsely pin down his problem
this year, but as he com
mented when I talked to him
last week before the UCLA
game, "I've got a theory. I
guess it's a little too late for
theories, though."
Griffin elaborated, "About
three weeks ago, I was sick and
stayed in bed for almost a week.
I got plenty of rest came out
real well and haven't had a
really bad game since."
"I used to figure getting to
bed early on Thursday and Fri
day was good enough, and I'd
stay up late on the rest of the
week. But no more. Since I've
been getting my rest every
night, I've played a lot better."
Griffin continued, "I'd get
tired during games and start
trying to pace myself. The shots

didn't feel right—they'd go ofT
the side of my hand."
"With plenty of sleep, I can
go 100% and the shots have
been falling in."
Griffin apparently doesn't
lose any sleep by needless
worrying. 'Tin not the type
of person who's affected by
criticism. I just take life as it
comes, and hope it doesn't
come too fast. I don't think
I've ever lost my confidence
as a ballplayer."
Winter quarter has piled an
additional responsibility onto
Griffin's shoulders. He has
moved out of the Delt house
and is presently a freshman
sponsor in Arroyo.
"I like to talk to people, help
people work with themselves,
I like to watch 'em grow."

Griffin's own growth was
scrutinized very closely by about
every college on the West Coast.
He was a prep star at Fremont
High in Oakland, and the re
cruiters beat the proverbial path
to his door.
"Everybody expected me to
go to Cal. My brother went
there, and a lot of my friends
encouraged me. It was a nat
ural. But I wanted to exert my
individuality and decided to
come to Stanford instead."
Griffin will get a chance to
both re-exert his individuality
and test out his sleep theory
this weekend as the Tribe winds
up the season with two games
against Cal.
In the interests of Stanford
basketball fortunes, we offer
this appeal to Arroyo residents:
Shhhhhh!

real well and haven't had a
really bad game since."
"I used to figure getting to
bed early on Thursday and Fri
day was good enough, and I'd
stay up late on the rest of the
week. But no more. Since I've
been getting my rest every
night, I've played a lot better."
Griffin continued, "I'd get
tired during games and start
trying to pace myself. The shots

didn't feel right—they'd go ofT
the side of my hand."
"With plenty of sleep, I can
go 100% and the shots have
been falling in."
Griffin apparently doesn't
lose any sleep by needless
worrying. 'Tin not the type
of person who's affected by
criticism. I just take life as it
comes, and hope it doesn't
come too fast. I don't think
I've ever lost my confidence
as a ballplayer."
Winter quarter has piled an
additional responsibility onto
Griffin's shoulders. He has
moved out of the Delt house
and is presently a freshman
sponsor in Arroyo.
"I like to talk to people, help
people work with themselves,
I like to watch 'em grow."

Griffin's own growth was
scrutinized very closely by about
every college on the West Coast.
He was a prep star at Fremont
High in Oakland, and the re
cruiters beat the proverbial path
to his door.
"Everybody expected me to
go to Cal. My brother went
there, and a lot of my friends
encouraged me. It was a nat
ural. But I wanted to exert my
individuality and decided to
come to Stanford instead."
Griffin will get a chance to
both re-exert his individuality
and test out his sleep theory
this weekend as the Tribe winds
up the season with two games
against Cal.
In the interests of Stanford
basketball fortunes, we offer
this appeal to Arroyo residents:
Shhhhhh!


DON GRIFFIN
In many ways, this has been
a dissappointing season for
Stanford basketballer Don Grif
fin. After coming on strong last
year to lead the team in scoring
and earn second string All-Con
ference honors as a sophomore,
Griff has been plagued this sea
son with cold shooting spells
that have limited his point out
put to less than twelve per
game.
A spectacular two-game 45-
point performance against Ore
gon State and Oregon raised
hopes that Griffin might have
shaken off his early season dol
drums for good. But last week
end he managed just twelve
points for two games, and was
held without a field goal by
UCLA.
Griffin himself can't pre

clsely pin down his problem
this year, but as he com
mented when I talked to him
last week before the UCLA
game, "I've got a theory. I
guess it's a little too late for
theories, though."
Griffin elaborated, "About
three weeks ago, I was sick and
stayed in bed for almost a week.
I got plenty of rest came out
real well and haven't had a
really bad game since."
"I used to figure getting to
bed early on Thursday and Fri
day was good enough, and I'd
stay up late on the rest of the
week. But no more. Since I've
