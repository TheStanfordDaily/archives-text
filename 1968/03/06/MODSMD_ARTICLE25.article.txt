# Girls' Basketball—No Wins, But Plenty Of Enthusiasm
## 
### BECKY BRINEGAR 
Pat DeCoster would get lost
among the Harrises, Griffins and
MacElwains who perform week
ly for the Stanford men's bas
ketball team, but she's done
something on the court this
year that none of them have
been able to do. She's made 80
per cent of her free throws.
Miss DeCoster plays for the
Stanford women's basketball
team, which has not done as
well on the scoreboard as she
has from the foul line. The in
experienced squad just finished
a winless season, losing "A" and
"B" games to five schools.
There were some high points,
however, according to Coach
Pamela Strathairn of the Wom
en's P.E. department. Besides
the free-throwing of Pat DeCos
ter, there was sophomore Lucy
Wilkes, who "has all the shots,"
according to Coach Strahairn.
Lucy averaged 14 points per
game this season, and freshman

Grace Carroll backed her with
eight per game.
But the real high point
comes whenever six girls and
a basketball got together on
the gym floor. Girls' basket
ball, for the uninitiated, is
quite different from the men's
game, though the rules are
similar. The game stresses
floor play and defense.
Partly responsible are the
rules, which only allow four of
the six girls on a team to be on
one half of a court at the same
time. The action is at midcourt,
where two retreating defenders
are joined by their two guards
to pick up the team crossing the
line and try to force a bad pass.
The girls play a zone defense,
and most of the shooting is
from the outside. The quality
of the shooting was described by
Miss Strathairn as "pretty
poor," but, she added, "these
kids don't pick up a ball and
start shooting in practice the

way the men do. The game isn't
work for them."
This is the way it should be,
Miss Strathairn feels.
The level of play is lower,
but the action is no less heated
in the WRA women's Intra
mural league, which conclud
ed last night. Six teams com
peted in the Tuesday night
league, and as of yesterday
Roble led the league with a
4-0 record. Roble met second
place Olivo last night for the
league championship.
Though her team failed to win
a game, Coach Straithairn
praised the defensive work of
Sue Swarbrick, Donna Sitts and
Karen Schulman, and expects a
stronger team next year. Some
good shooters are coming out
of basketball classes to replace
seven girls who are graduating,
she says.
But the girls don't take the
game all that seriously, she
adds. They're not out to fight
the officials or each other, but
just to enjoy themselves.
Still, there are some guys on
the varsity who could stand to
bring their free throwing up to
80 per cent.

a winless season, losing "A" and
"B" games to five schools.
There were some high points,
however, according to Coach
Pamela Strathairn of the Wom
en's P.E. department. Besides
the free-throwing of Pat DeCos
ter, there was sophomore Lucy
Wilkes, who "has all the shots,"
according to Coach Strahairn.
Lucy averaged 14 points per
game this season, and freshman

Grace Carroll backed her with
eight per game.
But the real high point
comes whenever six girls and
a basketball got together on
the gym floor. Girls' basket
ball, for the uninitiated, is
quite different from the men's
game, though the rules are
similar. The game stresses
floor play and defense.
Partly responsible are the
rules, which only allow four of
the six girls on a team to be on
one half of a court at the same
time. The action is at midcourt,
where two retreating defenders
are joined by their two guards
to pick up the team crossing the
line and try to force a bad pass.
The girls play a zone defense,
and most of the shooting is
from the outside. The quality
of the shooting was described by
Miss Strathairn as "pretty
poor," but, she added, "these
kids don't pick up a ball and
start shooting in practice the

way the men do. The game isn't
work for them."
This is the way it should be,
Miss Strathairn feels.
The level of play is lower,
but the action is no less heated
in the WRA women's Intra
mural league, which conclud
ed last night. Six teams com
peted in the Tuesday night
league, and as of yesterday
Roble led the league with a
4-0 record. Roble met second
place Olivo last night for the
league championship.
Though her team failed to win
a game, Coach Straithairn
praised the defensive work of
Sue Swarbrick, Donna Sitts and
Karen Schulman, and expects a
stronger team next year. Some
good shooters are coming out
of basketball classes to replace
seven girls who are graduating,
she says.
But the girls don't take the
game all that seriously, she
adds. They're not out to fight
the officials or each other, but
just to enjoy themselves.
Still, there are some guys on
the varsity who could stand to
bring their free throwing up to
80 per cent.


BROADSIDE — Stanford's Kathleen O'Connor (right) battles a Cal
opponent for the ball.
Pat DeCoster would get lost
among the Harrises, Griffins and
MacElwains who perform week
ly for the Stanford men's bas
ketball team, but she's done
something on the court this
year that none of them have
been able to do. She's made 80
per cent of her free throws.
Miss DeCoster plays for the
Stanford women's basketball
team, which has not done as
well on the scoreboard as she
has from the foul line. The in
experienced squad just finished
a winless season, losing "A" and
"B" games to five schools.
