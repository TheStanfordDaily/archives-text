# Coed Lag Remains Possibility; Dean Sees No Frosh On Row
## 
### NICHOLAS SELBY 
Lagunita Court is still under
consideration as a coed residence
and no freshmen will be as
signed to the row, according to
the latest thinking in the Dean
of Students office.
The progress report on at
tempts to define a single propo
sal for a university residence
configuration next fall, present
ed to 40 house presidents last
night, also included:
• No freshman houses of the
same type to be located next to
each other.
• No all-freshman houses in
Florence Moore Hall to be lo
cated next to each other.
• Contingency plans to raise
the number of Laguinita occu
pants from 276 to 299 by hous
ing two students in a room ori
ginally occupied by one.
• Plans to convert a row
house presently occupied by
women to a men's residence, if
demands for housing space war
rant it.
Proposals submitted to the
representatives two ago
called for freshmen in the ATO
horse on the upper row, all
freshman houses next to each
other in Wilbur, and three all
freshmen women houses on one
side of Florence Moore.
Assistant Dean of Students
Sally Mahoney said that talks
with residents in these areas
and other observers had con
vinced the Dean's office there
were "compelling reasons" for

not attempting: to implement
the original ideas.
She also said the Lagunita
and row representatives under
stood what situations might
force use of these plans and
were ready to cooperate with
all uf them. She reiterated the
problem of predicting exactly
what demands for space might
arise.
Miss Mahoney warned that the
University was committed to
maximum use of housing faci
lities and that "the luxury of
vacancies, of double rooms with
a single occupant, can no longer
be entertained."
Freshman John Shoch from
Madera House introduced a new
set of priorities for living space

on campus which, as expected,
called for giving next year's
freshmen a higher priority than
next year's seniors.
Reaction to Shoch's proposal
seemed to be that freshmen
should have equal but not great
er priority.
A Lagunita representative sug
gested a random draw among
all upper class males and that
the sophomores not able to con
tinue living on campus be con
sidered part of the housing sys
tem with special priority next
year.
Former sponsor Jon Trimbur
suggested that instead of the
either-or nature of Shoch's pro
posal, there be a new priority
calling for a balanced ratio of

seniors or all freshman being
forced to leave. He said forcing
large numbers of seniors to
leave might lower the value of
a residence.
Shoch said that although the
need for new priorities for next
year is probably small because
the new housing configuration
is expected to create more spaces
for undergraduate males, a look
at the principles which define
the priorities was absolutely
necessary.
The priorities issue and a
single proposal for the housing
configuration are expected to be
presented to Dean of Students
Joel Smith for a final decision
by the end of March.
