The faculty of Princeton Uni
versity voted overwhelmingly
Monday to recommend that the
university withdraw from the
Institute of Defense Analyses
(IDA), a high level "consort
ium" of universities for de
fense research.
Meanwhile, Frederick Ter
man, provost emeritus and Stan
ford's IDA representative, told
The Daily that the Institute is
holding its semi-annual meeting
in Washington next Monday and
Tuesday, and that the relation
ship of IDA and member schools
"would probably come up," al
though he has received no
agenda.
He said the relationship
question would probably come
up in light of a faculty report
at the University of Chicago
that IDA not be affiliated with
universities.
A "secret meeting" of IDA on
Feb. 20 and 21 in New York City
was a meeting of the executive
committee in preparation for
the semi-annual meeting next
week, Terman expalined.

The Princeton faculty vote
came four months after student
protestors were arrested for sit
ting in on the steps of an IDA
communications research build
ing on the Princeton campus.
Stanford is one of five charter
members of IDA, founded in
1956, with Cal Tech, MIT, Case
Institute of Technology, and Tu
lane University. There are now
a total of 12 universities in IDA.
Terman said that MIT was
originally approached on IDA
by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
but MIT wanted to make it "a
consortium" with several uni
versities.
Terman said that Stanford
was happy to join. He didn't
want Stanford to "be left out"
should another defense build
up come such as in World
War 11. There was virtually
no research for the govern
ment in the sciences going on
at Stanford during World
War 11.
"We were not a party to any
thing that was going on" Ter
man recalled.
