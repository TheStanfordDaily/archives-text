• Omaha Race Riot
OMAHA, Neb. (AP) - Police
reinforcements moved into the
tense Near North Side late
Tuesday following a night and
day of disorders that left one
Negro teen-ager dead and nu
muerous buildings damaged.
Rock-throwing incidents mul
tiplied, classrooms emptied and
one school closed down com
pletely.
Police assigned four-man cruis
ers to the Near North Side,
where most of Omaha's Negroes
live. But Nebraska Gov. Nor
bert Tiemann said he hopes
tempers will cool following the
departure of former Alabama
Gov. George Wallace from the
state.
Ernest Chambers, militant
Omaha Negro leader, said the
trouble started when about 50
demonstrators, mostly young
Negroes, were routed from a
Wallace-for-President rally in
Omaha Monday night.
Police formed a flying wedge
and drove the demonstrators
from the auditorium after they
began pelting the speaker's
platform with sticks, bits of
placards, paper drinking cups
and stones. k
• Airliner Hijacked
BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) —
A Colombian airliner was forced
at gunpoint Tuesday to fly to
Cuba with its 26 passengers, in
cluding a close friend and aide to
President Carlos Llegas Res
trepo and two Colombian con
gressmen. The plane carried a
crew of four.
There was immediate specu
lation that the hijacking was
the work of supporters of Prime
Minister Fidel Castro of Cuba.
Twice in the past seven months
Castroites have forced two other
Colombian airliners to fly to
Cuba.
The only message received

from the pilot, Capt. Pedro
Viles, was that he was being
forced to fly at gunpoint to Cuba
by unidentified persons.
• Dollar Devaluation ?
LONDON (AP)—The British
pound bounced back from an
all-time low today, but Europe's
gold rush kept the dollar under
attack.
The gold buyers were gam
bling the United States will be
forced to raise the price of gold
and thus hand them a handsome
profit. That would in effect be a
devaluation of the dollar.
London's foreign exchange
market opened with the pound
at $2.3975, 33 points down from
Monday's closing and the lowest
value for sterling in history.
The Bank of England did
some judicious support buying
and the rate rose to $2.3985.
Then the bank moved out of
the market and sat tight with a
display of steady nerves to al
low the pound to reach its own
level.
• VC Vary Attack
SAIGON (AP) — The Com
munists varied widespread shell
ing Tuesday with a costly in
fantry attack on Ca Mau, a pro
vincial capital of 40,000 near the
southern tip of Vietnam.
Military spokesmen said gov
ernment troops, fighter-bomb
ers, helicopter gunships and ar
tillery killed 195 Viet Cong in
routing a 300-man battalion that
drove into Ca Mau behind a bar
rage of mortar and recoilless ri
fle shells in early morning dark

ness and temporarily occupied
the provincial hospital.
Five of the enemy were cap
tured in the 15-hour fight at Ca
Mau, also known as Luang Long,
153 miles southwest of Saigon.
The troops seized a Communist
sampan loaded with explosive
charges.
• Soviet Boycott?
MOSCOW (AP) — The Soviet
Union, in what was interpreted
as a veiled boycott threat, de
manded Tuesday that the Inter
national Olympic Committee re
verse its stand and bar South
Africa from the Olympic Games
in Mexico City, Oct. 12-27.
East block countries were ex
pected to follow suit. The Com
munist nations norma'ly act as
a unit in sports controversies.
Without explicitly threatening
to join 39 other countries which
already have boycotted the
Games, the Central Council of
Soviet sports clubs and organi
zations asked the lOC to change
the decision made last month at
Grenoble, France, to readmit
South Africa to the Olympic
family.
• Test For McCarthy
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (AP)
Sen. Eugene J. McCarthy (D.,
Minn.), laid his peace candidacy
on the line before homostate
Democrats in more than 3,000
precinct caucuses Tuesday night.
The caucuses—a kind of polit
ical town meeting—provided the
first grassroots test of McCar
thy's opposition to President
Johnson's Vietnam policies. Re
sults of the caucuses may re

main blurry for weeks, although
both sides except a good head
count by Wednesday.
McCarthy's first primary test
comes next Tuesday in New
Hampshire.
The eventual prize in Minne
sota is control of the
delegation to the Democratic na
tional convention, although Mc-
Carthy backers also see the po
litical reputation of Vice Presi
dent Hubert H. Humphrey at
stake.
• Rights Bill Amended
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Senate nailed an antiriot provi
sion into its civil rights bill
Ti esday and then refused to ex
empt individual home owners
from a ban on discrimination in
the sale or rental of housing.
Over administration protests,
the Senate adopted 82 to 13 an
amendment providing for a
five-year prison term and a
$10,000 fine for crossing state
lines with intent to start a riot.
Then by the narrow margin of
48 to 43 it rejected an amend
ment by Sen. Howard H. Baker
Jr., R-Tenn., which would have
removed about 29 million own
er-occupied single-family dwell
ings, or about 44 per cent of the
housing market, from the anti
discrimination clause.
• Dien Bien Phu 2?
PARIS (AP) — The French
general whose army was defeat
ed at Diehn Bien Phu suggested
Tuesday the United States
should get ground forces mov
ing around Khe Sanh and avoid
the French error of waiting in

definitely for an enemy offen
sive.
"The United States should
launch infantry operations from
other bases near Khe Sanh,'
Gen. Rene Cogny said in an in
terview. "They should not leave
the Khe Sanh troops alone as in
the boxing ring, taking the
punch. Immobilism, that's the
enemy."
The 64-year-old officer said he
is confident the U.S. Command
will open such attacks to re
lieve the North Vietnamese pres
sure on the besieged U.S. Ma
rine base.
• Nixon Nixes War
HAMPTON, N.H. (AP) —
Former Vice President Richard
M. Nixon, a solo Republican
campaigner for the nation's
opening presidential primary,
pledged anew Tuesday that a
GOP administration would end
the war in Vietnam.
Alone as a major
GOP candidate, Nixon staged
one of his more energetic cam
paign days, a five-town sprint,
urging the voters to turn out
for the primary on March 12.
Michigan Gov. George Rom
ney has withdrawn as a candi
date, although his name will
still be listed on the New Hamp
shire ballot.
• Reagan Hits Report
SACRAMENTO (AP) — Some
conclusions drawn by the presi
dential commission on racial dis
orders were questioned Tues
day by Gov. Reagan.
On a key recommendation that
billions of dollars must be spent
to remove violence-br3wing Ne
gro slums, the governor com
mented:
"Perhaps there is less evi
dence that we are not spending
enough money than there is evi
dence that we haven't been get
