# Committee Approves New Frosh English
## 
### DAN SNELL 
The General Studies commit
tee has approved in principle the
English department's proposal
to provide some variety in the
Freshman English program next
fall.
Some freshmen will probably

be table to take a two-quarter
lecture course instead of the
present three quarters of small
seminar meetings.
The full lecture courses will
meet at least once a week,
with two meetings weekly in
small sections. But the organ
ization of each of the courses
will be up to the professor
teaching it.
The General Studios commit
tee has questioned, however, the
unit value proposed for the
three experimental courses. The
English department wanted the
courses to carry five credits, but
the committee felt such a load
was too heavy for an entering
freshman.
A five-unit course also severe
ly limits the number of other
courses a freshman could take,
according to the committee.
The committee and the En
glish department are now work
ing this problem out. If the cour
ses are valued at three units
like the present English classes,
freshmen will have to take an
other quarter of Freshman En
glish as well as the two-quarter
experimental lecture class.
But if the courses are valued
at four units, students who take
the course for both the two
quarters would be exempt from
further Freshman English class
es.
The General Studies commit
tee may consider this matter at
its meeting today.
Next year's freshmen will
he asked by mail this summer
whether they would like to
participate in the new cour
ses.
Robert Polhemus, director
of Freshman English, said he
hoped by next winter to be
able to start more two-quarter
courses to run through winter
and spring quarters.

The courses planned are
Themes in Modern American
Paetry, taught by John Fel
stiner; Literature and Techno
logy, taught by David Hallibur
ton; and Writing: The Personal
Forms, taught by Kenneth
Fields.
.Robert Polhemus said the En
glish department had developed
the courses "to give students a
choice in what they have to
study, plus the writing practice
that Freshman English courses
now try to give."
He pointed out that a science
major might find the Literature
and Technology course more
relevant to his endeavors than
a regular English course.
Polhemus said the courses
would provide some chance for
contact between the freshmen
and an experienced professor in
the English department as well
as contact with the teaching as
sistants who will be leading the
section meetings of the courses.
An English Department
memorandum from Polhemus
cited as reasons for the three
experimental courses the dif
ficulties of staffing the present
freshman English program
with graduate students with
some teaching experience and
"the inevitable unevenness of
the present program."
Polhemus hopes that if the
three experimental courses are
successful, more such classes
can be scheduled. Among the
courses that might be offered
next year are The Comic Imagi
nation; The Evolution of the
Hero; Language, Literature, and
Myth; Literature, Childhood,
and Society; and Modern Popu
lar Culture.
The English Department's
Composition Committee voted in
October to make the experimen
tal courses open to all students
with preference given to fresh
men.
The committee decided that
when the courses have become
available to every freshmen, en
rollment in one of the courses

would be a requirement for an
English major.
Presently Freshman English
is taught in 53 sections, mainly
by teaching assistants. Some
books are read by most of the
sections, but teachers are free
to decide the rest of the readings
for their sections.

Polhemus hopes that if the
three experimental courses are
successful, more such classes
can be scheduled. Among the
courses that might be offered
next year are The Comic Imagi
nation; The Evolution of the
Hero; Language, Literature, and
Myth; Literature, Childhood,
and Society; and Modern Popu

The English Department's
Composition Committee voted in
October to make the experimen
tal courses open to all students
with preference given to fresh
men.
The committee decided that
when the courses have become
available to every freshmen, en
rollment in one of the courses

would be a requirement for an
English major.
Presently Freshman English
is taught in 53 sections, mainly
by teaching assistants. Some
books are read by most of the
sections, but teachers are free
to decide the rest of the readings
for their sections.
The General Studies commit
tee has approved in principle the
English department's proposal
to provide some variety in the
Freshman English program next
fall.
Some freshmen will probably

be table to take a two-quarter
lecture course instead of the
present three quarters of small
seminar meetings.
The full lecture courses will
meet at least once a week,
with two meetings weekly in
small sections. But the organ
ization of each of the courses
will be up to the professor
teaching it.
The General Studios commit
tee has questioned, however, the
unit value proposed for the
three experimental courses. The
English department wanted the
courses to carry five credits, but
the committee felt such a load
was too heavy for an entering
freshman.
A five-unit course also severe
ly limits the number of other
courses a freshman could take,
according to the committee.
The committee and the En
glish department are now work
ing this problem out. If the cour
ses are valued at three units
like the present English classes,
freshmen will have to take an
other quarter of Freshman En
glish as well as the two-quarter
experimental lecture class.
But if the courses are valued
at four units, students who take
the course for both the two
quarters would be exempt from
further Freshman English class
es.
The General Studies commit
tee may consider this matter at
its meeting today.
Next year's freshmen will
he asked by mail this summer
whether they would like to
participate in the new cour
ses.
Robert Polhemus, director
of Freshman English, said he
hoped by next winter to be
able to start more two-quarter
courses to run through winter
and spring quarters.

The courses planned are
Themes in Modern American
Paetry, taught by John Fel
stiner; Literature and Techno
logy, taught by David Hallibur
ton; and Writing: The Personal
Forms, taught by Kenneth
Fields.
.Robert Polhemus said the En
glish department had developed
the courses "to give students a
choice in what they have to
study, plus the writing practice
that Freshman English courses
now try to give."
He pointed out that a science
major might find the Literature
and Technology course more
relevant to his endeavors than
a regular English course.
Polhemus said the courses
would provide some chance for
contact between the freshmen
and an experienced professor in
the English department as well
as contact with the teaching as
sistants who will be leading the
section meetings of the courses.
