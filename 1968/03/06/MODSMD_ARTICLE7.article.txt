# Dean Whitaker Hits Academic New Left

### MARK WEINBERGER 
The academic New Left is
abusing the tradition of freedom
of speech on the campus and
may well jeopardize the future
of the humanities, Virgil K. Whit
aker, dean of the graduate divi
sion, warned earlier this week.
Whitaker spoke before the
deans of the Western Associa
tion of Graduate Schools who
were meeting at Denver.
"The right to proclaim truth
as one sees it is not doing very
well on the American campus
today," he asserted.
"Let us not forget that even
during the darkest days of Mc-
Carthy we would never have
tolerated or even dreamed of
the inroads upon the right of
free speech on a university cam
pus that have occurred within
the last two or three years," he
claimed.
"The darkest day In the his
tory of Stanford was surely
that in which Dean Rusk de
cided that he could not safe
ly speak at Stanford," Whi
taker asserted.
For many students and fac
ulty, what really determines the
right or wrong of what a per
son does in all kinds of situa
tions is not basic principles, but
where he stands on certain over
riding contemporary issues like
the war in Vietnam," he told the
deans.
"(There are) many examples
of faculty members who have
seemed to feel that the right at

titude on Vietnam or similar so
cial problems of today was ade
quate justification for the most
flagrant breach of various kinds
of scholarly obligations," he said.
Whitaker said he feared that
"meticulously finding the truth
does not matter — the important
thing is to go out and man the
barricades, or at least to stimu
late one's students to do so."
Today's professor in the hu
manities is pulled in three direc
tions, Whitaker declartd — ftcst
by the intellectual tradition that
the prime duty of every scholar
is to discover and publish the
truth.
Second, he is swayed by the
steadily mounting demand that
teachers of the humanitie* be
come critics of contemporary
literature, art, music, or drama;
and third, he is pulled by "the
preoccupation of the younger
generation with contemporary
social issues — with the mood
of discontent."
"Key decisions are going to
have to be made in the next
decade," he emphasized, "about
the nature of the curriculum in
the humanities.
"Shall It he concerned with
the meticulous scholarly ap
proach necessary to develop
a thorough understanding of
the past, on the assumption
that the past is the key to he
present, or shall it throw Itself
headlong into a discussion of
contemporary literature, and
through that literature, of
contemporary '-Isms?'"
