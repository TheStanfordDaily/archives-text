# The 						Nerve-End Strikes
## 
### Max Lerner 
First Florida, then New Mex
ico and tomorrow who knows
where? The teacher strikes are
coming in dead earnest, not by
school district, not even citywide,
but statewide: headaches not
only for school boards but for
governors and state legislators.
Some figures are in order. In
the decades before Sputnik there
were perhaps five teacher walk
outs a year in the whole nation.
After Sputnik, probably out of
a sense of national conscience,
the numbers were even less. But
in 1966, with the full force of
the educational explosion, there
were 30 teacher work stoppages,
in 1967 probably close to a hun
dred, and the prediction for next
year is 250.
Fierce Struggle
The case of the teachers is
complicated by a fierce organi
zational rivalry, between the
straight trade • union group
(American Federation of Teach
ers) and the professional group
(National Education Assn.).
The NEA, which has in the
past shied away from the strike

weapon, has a new executive
secretary — Sam Lambert — and
a new spirit in the state groups
such as Florida and New Mex
ico. They recall that last Sep
tember the AFT won a teacher's
strike in New York City and got
a 20 per cent salary increase.
The NEA is having to adopt
trade-union tactics in order to
keep its membership lead.
The American teacher is a
new breed of cat — a college
graduate, getting an average
salary of $6,900 a year, more and
more likely to be man of about
40 rather than an old school
marm or a young girl waiting
to get married. He knows the
new teaching technology, much
of it audio-visual. He is sophisti
cated about state legislatures
and educational politics. And he
won't take anyone's guff, not
even the clowning tactics of
Gov. Claude Kirk of Florida.
Appropriation Problems
Sometimes the teachers' prob
lem is the governor, sometimes
the legislature, sometimes both.
In the case of New Mexico,

where the state allocates money
for education to rich and poor
counties alike, the teachers are
taking a broad view and demand
ing that the poorer counties get
a larger proportionate share of
the state's funds so that local
teacher salaries may be equal
ized. It makes sense as a total
state policy, but do the legisla
tors know it does?
The problem is even harder in
other vocations where the pub
lic outrage over a service break
down is greater, as with police,
firemen, hospital workers, gar
bage collectors.
The outrage at union demands
was so great in the New York
City sanitation strike that it
made a hard-line hero — at
least for a week — out of Mayor
John Lindsay and a villain out
of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller who
refused to call out the National
Guard.
It is because the public pain
is so great that I call those whole
group of work stoppages the
nerve-end strikes. Since the very
life of a big city depends on
keeping the services going, their
stoppage rubs the raw nerve
ends of the pople. What makes
it worse is the sense of help
lessness in the face of mounting
demands.
Right To Bargain
Yet the fact is that the work
er is no less a worker for being
employed by the public rather
than by private industry, and his
right to collective bargaining is
no less an economic and moral
right. Hence, the impasse being
experienced now.
How to break it? Not by legal
crackdowns and jail sentences
that only stiffen the unions and
create martyrs. The role of state
law should be limited to setting
the rules of the game while leav
ing the game itself to the nego
tiating parties, helped by vol
untary arbitrators.
The law might require bar
gaining in earnest three months
before the contract ends by all
the unions involved in a public
service sector, with a public ac
counting by a neutral fact-finder

a month before it ends. If there
is still no agreement, the state
should encourage a voluntary
agreement to arbitrate and to ac
cept the arbitrator's decision.
Finally, a committee of the leg
islator should sit in on the bar
gaining and thus fill the infor
mational gap which often af
flicts the legislators.
Within this frame, public em
ployees can feel equal to others,
and as their frustration di
minishes their rationality may
increase.
