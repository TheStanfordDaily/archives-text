First Prix# for Male Choruses, Festival de Chant Choral, France.
"No less than perfect." Admirable musicaal polish."
London Daily Telegraph New Yortc Times
"These men could sing in Urdu, Swahili or Old Migh German and still be one of
the finest male choruses in the world. . . The voices are superbly balanced, with
deep resonant contra-bassos contrasted against clear high tenors with those
peculiar head tones so dear to Eastern Europe, and a gratifyingly strong section
of baritones."
Son Francisco Chronicle
