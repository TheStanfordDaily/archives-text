# Open Style Of SES: Stimulus To Reform
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY (First of two articles) 
Call it openness or call it an
archy, the most striking char
tcteristic of the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford is its style. '

"At most universities," says
SES chairman Herbert Packer,
"the study group goes off into a
corner. The first thing they pub
lish is a final report. We've been
far more open than is ordinarily
the case."
SES's 100 faculty and stu
dents on dozens of committees
and subcommittees, are now at
the half-way point in a com
prehensive, two-year study au
thorized by President Wallace
Sterling. When SES does pub
lish a final report in January,
1969, not a word will surprise
the University. Every recom
mendation will have been pub
licly discussed and revised
months before. Many will al
ready be implemented.
Through conferences, position
papers and memoranda, the SES
steering committee and its nine
topic committees have been able
to stir up reform activity with
out making final—and thus vul
nerable —recommendations.
In this way SES has become a

stimulus to reform in depart
ments and schools wanting to
beat SES to the punch. This
suits SES fine. "We're delighted
when one of our ideas is picked
up by a continuing campus
body," says Staff Director Rob
ert Hind.
SES was hardly disappointed
when the Academic Council ap
proved Jan. 5 a pilot program to
allow 20 students to design their
own interdepartmental majors.
This steering committee suggest
ed such flexible programs in Oc
tober.
Five months of general debate
have helped the steering com
mittee come to some conclusions
on one of Stanford's most press
ing issues—the general studies
program for undergraduates.
With the help of the humanities
and science faculty, the general
studies committee, the history,
language and English depart
ments, a student review board
and many individual faculty, a
rough consensus has been

reached.
Flexibility is the commit
tee's theme on general stud
ies. Instead of a list of spe
cific courses acceptable for
the area requirements In hu
manities, natural science, and
social science, students will be
asked to take a certain num
ber of courses in each area,
regardless of subject. Instead
of a single, required Western
Civilization course, a variety
of courses in "historical stud
ies" Is suggested.
In line with humanities and
science faculty recommenda
tions, SES leans toward asking
a student to take a certain num
ber of English courses instead
of the present Freshman En
glish requirement
In other areas, new courses
are needed for "the carrot, not
the stick," approach, in Hind's
words. The science laboratory
requirement should end for non
majors and entirely new science
introductory courses should be

designed with non-majors in
mind. A new course in compu
ters is envisioned as a option
for the mathematics require
ment.
Foreign language require
ments, the cause of the one heat
ed controversy since SES issued
its position paper on undergrad
uate education Oct. 30, should be
met through "proficiency level
testing rather than course re
quirements," as Packer express
es the committee's current feel
ing.
And all general studies re
quirements, SES says, should be
flexible for individual students.
The general studies committee,
responding to this SES sugges
tion, received permission from
the Academic Council Jan. 5 to
waive the requirements in re
sponse to student petitions.
In its final report the steer
ing committee may go farther.
Instead of requirements, It
has been suggested that the
University merely recommend

courses to undergraduates.
"The question of guidelines vs.
requirements to still under dis
cussion," says Packer. "I
don't think we're ready to take
a position on that."
University-wide discussion
since SES laid down its general
studies "philosophy" in the Oct.
30 position paper has created
some strong proposals for the
Academic Senate to consider
when that body first meets next
fall. By then SES will have pub
lished a first draft of its entire
report.
General studies don't really
arouse much excitement in the
nine-member steering committee
these days. More pressing issues
now are the grading system,
course units, quarters vs. semes
ters for the academic calendar,
the teaching of English composi
tion and graduate education.
On these subjects the steering
committee—consisting of faculty
and students whose educational
philosophies range from liberal

reformist to radical — envision
sweeping changes.
Instead of one to five units
assigned each course, the steer
ing committee is discussing of-


HIND: "How are we going to
get the faculty behind us?"


PACKER: "The question of
guidelines vs. requirements Is
still under consideration."
