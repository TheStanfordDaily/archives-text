## Nixon Loser Image Returns 
### Art Buchwald 
Richard Nixon had another
crisis just last week. I didn't
realize it until I was returning
from Gov. George Romney's
press conference where he an
nounced he was no longer a can
didate for the Republican presi
dential nomination.
My first thought was that the
Nixon people would be elated
with the news, but when I
passed their headquarters on
Pennsylvania Ave., I found noth
ing but gloom.
"Why the long faces?" I asked
a volunteer worker.
"Now that Romney's out of
the race," he said, "Nixon has
no one to run against."
"But I should think Nixon
would welcome Romney's with
drawal."
"That's how much you know

about Republican politics," he
said.
"Nixon was counting on beat
ing Romney big so he could
overcome his loser image. Now
that he has no one to run
against, he can't prove he's a
winner."
Romney's Trick
"You mean Romney double
crossed Nixon by pulling out be
fore Nixon could officially beat
him?"
"I'm not saying why Romney
pulled out, but you can draw
your own conclusions. With
Romney out of the race, Nixon
has to run against himself."
"What about Rockefeller?"
"Rocky's too smart to run in
the primaries. He figures by the
time Nixon campaigns in the
primaries, people will be so
tired of him, they'll want to
draft someone else for the
Presidency."
"But that's unfair to Nixon.
If he works so hard for the pres
idential spot he should get it."
"That's what Dick says."
"Why don't you have Nixon
run against Harold Stassen?" I
suggested. "After all, Stassen is
the only other announced candi
date, and I should think people
would be impressed with a Nix
on win over him."
Public Relations
"We've thought about it, but
in order for Nixon to look good
we would have to make Stassen
look good, and we don't have
enough time to do that A win
over Stassen in the primaries

means absolutely nothing to the
people back home."
"And," I said, "there's always
the outside chance that Stassen
could beat Nixon."
"That wasn't very funny," the
volunteer said.
"All right, let's go back to
Nixon's problem. What if Nixon
does run against himself in New
Hampshire, Wisconsin and Ore
gon? It could very well turn out
to be one of the dirtiest primary
campaigns in history."
"But what will it prove?" he
asked.
"Suppose the old Nixon ac
cuses the new Nixon of doing
terrible things. People would be
horrified and all the sympathy
would go to the new Nixon."
"I'm following you," the vol
unteer said.
Before The Nation
"The new Nixon could go on
television with his family and
his dog and let the people judge
whether he or the old Nixon
were speaking the truth. The old
Nixon would be pilloried by the
press and you'd have a wave of
sympathy for the new Nixon
that you haven't had in Ameri
can politics since the last time
Nixon pleaded his case to the
American people."
"It could work," the volunteer
said. "The only thing that wor
ries me is that if the new Nixon
beats the old Nixon so badly in
the primaries, how do we know
the old Nixon won't hit us below
the belt during the election?"
