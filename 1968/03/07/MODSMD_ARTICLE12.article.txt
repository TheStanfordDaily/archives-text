## Euthanasia Benefits Families 
### BRUCE MERRY 
One of the advantages of Eu
thanasia increasingly applauded
by religious and civic leaders is
that it permits the family and
relatives of the sick person to
choose the most convenient
place and time for him to die.
By signing a document author
izing doctors to curtail the life
of a useless invalid, relatives
can forestall untold pain and
suffering for themselves. Fu
neral parlors are also enthusias
tic about the idea because it
guarantees steady business and
stabilizes the influx of corpses
in a time of fluctuating trade.
I was talking the other day
with my friend Phewitt Twist.
His father had just died in a
suburban clinic after a long and
costly illness.
Condolences
"Phewitt, I'm terribly sorry to
hear of your father's sudden
death. It must have come as
quite a shock to you."
"Well actually, not as much
as you might think. We had ex
pected him to die any minute;
the staff at the Clinic said it
would probably be Saturday,
but he finally died an Tuesday."
"It must have been awful for
you, knowing in advance."
"Not really. You see, I had to
go on a business trip the week
before last and it was a great
comfort for me to know I
wouldn't have to dash back in
the middle of a deal because of
a crisis."
"I see."

"We had the funeral arrange
ments all worked out in advance.
The parlor director was awfully
nice about everything, especial
ly as we gave him an exact es
timate."
"How do you mean?"
"Early afternoon death; bow
els already opened."
Doctor's Work
"How did the doctors do it,
I meanâ€”stop the pain?
"They gradually lessened the
dose of intravenous feeding."
"Don't you think your father
was a little upset to know you
had already scheduled the fun
eral before he died?"
"Not at all. He knew all along
that his illness might have been
protracted uselessly for years."
"Uselessly?"
"Of course. Why should a man
have to suffer, especially if he
needs constant professional at
tention?"
"I suppose you're right."
"Besides, all the waiting and
hoping was getting on my wife's
nerves. She's been in a state of
exhaustion for several months
what with all the uncertainty.
When I finally signed the papers
it took a weight off our mind,
I can tell you."
In The Future
"I guess so. What are your
plans now?"
"Well, my mother has been
in a wheelchair for three years
and she recently had a stroke,
so we're hospitalizing her next
Sunday."
"What then?"

"Well, you know I don't believe
in useless suffering. Hr doctor
says she'll need medical care
if she's to live more them an
other ten years."
"You never know; she might
recover from the stroke."
"And then be bedridden? She'd
never be able to live on her own.
It's out of the question. Anyway
they've localized a weak artery
to her heart. One quick injec
tion and she'd never know the
difference. Don't forget: we've
all got to die later or sooner."
