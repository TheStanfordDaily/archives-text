# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Riot Report Faces Stiff Opposition 
### Drew Pearson 
It hasn't made headlines, but
an advance rehearsal of the leg
islative battle sure to occur over
the Presidential eommission's
recommendations on race riots
is now taking place on Capitol
Hill.
The commission last week
jolted the nation with a warning
that we would have to spend as
much money as we are spending
on the Vietnam war to prevent
"our nation from moving toward
two societies, one black, one
white—separate and unequal."

A preview of how much sym
pathy this will get from Con
gress is now taking place over
the relatively insignificant ques
tion of naming a veterans hos
pital in Jackson, Miss.
Rep. Tom Abernathy, D., Miss.,
has introduced a bill to name it
after John Rankin, one of the
most vocal "Nigger haters" ever
to serve in Congress. Rep. Jona
than Bingham, (D., N.Y.), has
introduced a bill to name it after
a Negro, Medgar Evers, the head
of the Mississippi NAACP, shot
and killed from ambush.
Popular Slayer
His accused slayer was twice
tried but got a hung jury; later
ran for lieutenant governor of
Mississippi. His brother Charles
recently won the largest num
ber of votes in a Congressional
by-election, though he faces a
runoff next week.
The hospital legislation is now
deadlocked in the House Rules
Committee. Northern Demo
crats, led by Speaker John Mc-
Cormack, are supporting Evers's
name for the hospital. Southern
Democrats, backed by Rep. Olin
Teague of Texas, chairman of
the Veterans Committee, are
backing the "Rankin Hospital."
Rep. Bill Colmer of Mississip
pi, chairman of the Rules Com
mittee, is blocking the Rankin
bill unless iLgan be reported out
with a no anrendment rule. If it
can be amended on the House
floor, the name "Evers" will be
substituted for the name "Ran
kin," and Republican Congress
men would have to vote on it.
Problem of Priorities
This is the last thing they
want to do. Republicans have a
working agreement to support

Southern Democrats against
Johnson. Yet simultaneously
they are wooing the Negro
vote. If the veterans hospital
bill gets out on the House floor
subject to amendment, they
would have to line up one way
or the other. So the bill remains
bottled up in the Rules Commit
tee.
It could be brought out if the
following Republican members
of that committee would vote
to pry it loose: H. Allen Smith,
Calif., John B. Anderson, IIL,
David Martin, Neb., James H.
Quillen, Tenn., and Delbert Lat
ta. Ohio. However, they won't.
This backstage battle illus
trates what any legislation wfll
be up against to improve race
relations in the big cities and
prevent the United States from
becoming two societies, one
black, one white—separate and
unequal.
Brown Vs. Brown
Pat Brown, long-time governor
of California, now retired, was
on the CBS Cronkite show with
his son Jerry, debating the ques
tion of Sen. Gene McCarthy and
peace in Vietnam. Jerry Brown
is a strong dove. Former Gov.
Brown is a reluctant, sometimes
dubious, hawk.
After the debate was over,
Mrs. Pat Brown, who also hap
pens to be Jerry's mother, re
marked to her husband: "Wasn't
Jerry great!"
"But what about your hus
band?" asked the other debater.
"Well, you were great too,"
agreed Mrs. Brown as an after
thought.
African Oil
Charles Luce, who used to be
Under Secretary of the Interior

and now heads one of the big
gest utilities on the East Coast,
Consolidated Edison, has made a
request of his old boss, Secre
tary of the Interior Udall, which
has oil men worried.
Con Ed wants to change the
oil quota system so as to admit
unlimited amounts of Libyan
and Nigerian oil for the East
Coast.
This would put a crimp in
East Coast oil imports from
Texas, Louisiana, and our No. 1
supplier of heating oil, Vene
zuela, one of our best friends in
Latin America.
Reason for Luce's request is
air pollution and health. He
wants to clean up air pollution
in the New York area, where
eight million people now breathe
sulphurous fumes belched out
from the Con Ed plant, which
burns high sulphuric oil from
the Gulf States and Venezuela.
To this end, Mayor John Lind
say of New York, with Senators
Jack Javits, Republican, and
Robert F. Kennedy, Democrat,
have joined in the Con Ed re
quest. Nigerian oil is sulphur
free while Libyan oil has a low
sulphur content.
Complicated Issue
However, there are complica
tions. First, European countries
are already buying the entire
oil output of Nigeria and Libya.
Second, Libyan oil has been cut
off by Arab-Israeli fighting in
the past and could be in the fu
ture. Venezuelan and Gulf oil
have always kept flowing in the
United States regardless of any
war.
Finally, Venezuela, the chief
supplier of residual oil for East
Coast heating purposes (3,000,-

000 barrels a day), has prompt
ly moved to build a sulphuric
elimination plant to clean its oil.
It is giving North American oil
companies substantial tax con
cessions in order to pay for this
plant.
Another sulphuric elimination
plant is being built at Bayonne,
N.J., to clean up other oil ar
riving on the East Coast.
Hasty action in giving Libya
and Nigeria unlimited quotas,
therefore, would disrupt long
term plans to clean up air pol
lution for the future. It will be
interesting to see how Secretary
Udall handles the request of hif
old friend, former Under Secre
tary Luce.
