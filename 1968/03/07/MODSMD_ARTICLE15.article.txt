# The 						Two Societies
## 
### Max Lerner 
A century and a quarter ago
Benjamin Disraeli startled the
British as a young Tory by
showing them that in terms of
class they were "two nations."
Now the President's commission
on the inner-city race riots has
startled America by its indict
ment of "the two societies."
Obviously, much will depend
on how quickly and drastically
the report is followed by action.
Yet one must add that a unani
mous report by a largely white
national commission, putting the
blame for the riots squarely on
the whites and their racist atti
tudes, is in itself a huge event
and, therefore, a form of action.
As such, however, it will be
effective only if it leads to action
in the more usual sense, in the
form of legislative appropria
tions, initiatives by business and
labor, more and better jobs for
Negroes, better education, equal
life chances.
The record of the U.S. Senate,
in its struggles to get cloture
and bring the open-housing bill
to a vote, is not a good augury
for the chances of breaking the
log-jam against equality. In fact,
there is a danger that if the
commission is not met by more

than a token response, the hopes
it has aroused among Negroes
will be followed by an even more
bitter disillusionment.
Price Of Frustration
In fact, much of the story of
violence in the inner city will
someday be written by the his
torians around the theme of
hopelessness, hope and frustra
tion. The commission has chosen
to focus on the economic and so
cial causes of the riots and has
done it well. But a second and
more psychological report could
be written, and it would focus
on hope and frustration.
There is another way of put
ting it: the commission has an
swered in the broadest terms
why the riots happened. It puts
the moral responsibility where
broadly it must be shouldered
— on white society, white atti
tudes, white economics, white
politics. It has not adequately
answered another question: why
did the riots happen now, and
not 5 or 10 or 20 years ago?
My own clue is that revolu
tions, with violence, do not occur
in stagnant societies. They oc
cur in societies caught in the
convulsions of rapid change.
Men sunk in the torpor of hope
lessness don't strike out for free
dom or equality. They strike out
when conditions have started to
change, thus awakening the
hopes which get converted into
claims and demands for change
that go all the way.
Slow Reformation
What happened under Presi
dents Rooseyelt, Truman, Eisen
hower, 'Kennedy, and Johnson,
through Supreme Court deci
sions and legislative action,
didn't go far enough or fast
enough to fulfill the hopes and
satisfy the claims, but it did
go far enough to awaken them.
Three other trends converged
with this one in the mid-Six
ties to bring about the 1967 riots.
One was the Vietnamese war,
which took up the top priority
on national resources away from
the inner city. The second was
the impact of the African liber
ation movements on the Ameri
can Negro and the projection
of revolutionary nationalism into

the American ghettos. The third
was the rebellion of the young,
white and black alike, which
brought a new group of young
and militant black power figures
into the struggle.
Put these together with the
poverty and degradation and one
gets at least a partial answer to
the question of why now.
Trapped Negroes
What few will deny, even in
the Congress which has been
dragging its feet about an effec
tive open-housing law, is that the
American Negro is in a trap.
He is at the base of the prya
mid, without income. He is with
out skills for decently paid jobs
because he has for so long been
shut out of education. He is
without power. He has not brok
en through to tap his own cul
tural tradition. He has fbund it
hard to achieve a sense of iden
tity and of pride in his color and
his race.
In one way or another h<-
will break out of the trap. If hr
doesn't get income and housing,
he will loot the stores and burn
the houses. If he doesn't get good
schools, he will turn the class
room into a battlefield.
If he doesn't share power with
the whites, as is slowly happen
ing now — in Gary, Cleveland,
Washington, even in the Evers'
race for the congressional seat
in Mississippi — he will try the
desperate resort of grasping for
black power alone. If he is not
helped to achieve a pride in his
cultural and racial identity, he
will blindly destroy the larger
culture which he at once hates
and envies.
Someday the Negroes may do
a commission report of their
own, addressed to themselves,
saying that they, too, carry a
moral responsibility for their
destiny, and not only the whites.
It will say that the most destruc
tive road for the Negroes is that
of separatism and that their
worst slogans are "burn, baby,
burn," and "anything goes." And
it will end by saying that the
house of man must be kept in
tact for Negroes and whites alike
to inherit.
