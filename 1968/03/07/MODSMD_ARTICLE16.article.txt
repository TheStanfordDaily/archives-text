## Shockley Insists Welfare Lowers Genetic Potential 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
"Shockley Debates Ghetto Ef
fects on IQ" of Feb. 29, usefully,
but not accurately, calls atten
tion to the fears I expressed at
San Jose State College, that a
cruel genetic enslavement of our
Negro minority may be an unin
tentioned by-product of our hu
manely-motivated welfare pro
grams.
I endeavored to draw the atten
tion of Negro intellectuals Dr.
Poussaint and Mr. Warden to
this problem by participation in
a panel "Discussion of Dr. Shock
ley's Fear That Ghetto Birth
rates are Lowering Negro Hered
itary Intelligence." My efforts
provoked not relevant thought
on the agreed-upon topic but in
stead attacks upon me as a
"blithering idiot" and "profound
ly ignorant and a racist bigot."
Let me answer these attacks
and also respond for the first
time to several other Dally arti
cles and letters over the last four
teen months by stating my posi
tion and reviewing some relevant
facts.
Using Opportunities
During the last thinking five
minutes of my life, I hope to look
back to 1967 and 1968 and con
sider that I used my opportuni
ties and abilities as effectively as
my personal limitations permit
ted with the aim, as phrased in
Nobel's will, of "conferring
greatest benefit on mankind."
I have faith in the power of the
majority of human minds to rec
ognize how objective realities
can fall into logical structure pat
terns permitting reliable predic
tions. I conjecture that honest
inquiry will reveal that our pres
ent welfare programs can be re
liably predicted to lower our av
erage national genetic potential
in many significant ways.
This lowering, as I said at San
Jose State, probably occurs for
both the black and white por
tions of our population but is dis
proportionately more severe for
the black. In raising these ques
tions, in furnishing statistical
evidence for their importance
(not, as The Daily reported, a 6
per cent drop in IQ, but a drop
of 6 per cent in "overlap") and
in suggesting research approach
es, I am undertaking the role oL
a visitor to a sick friend who
urges a thorough diagnosis, pain
ful though the diagnosis may be,
so that remedial actions may be
based on objectively established
facts and sound methodology.
How I was led, in part by acci
dental circumstances, to my con
cern with human quality prob
lems including their racial as
pects is summarized in a collec
tion of correspondence and arti
cles that I have made available
at the Stanford undergraduate
library.
IQ Tesfs Valve
The Dally article reports that
my San Jose State co-panelist,
Tuft's Psychiatry Professor, Dr.
Alvin Poussaint, in addition to
attacking me and my research,
also attacked IQ tests maintain
ing "that they are not related
to native intelligence."
This denigration of IQ tests is
unwarranted. IQ tests do not be
long in an intellectual garbage
dump (although that, I fear, is
where blanket criticisim of them
flourishes) simply because they
io not diagnose for criminal
tendencies or irresponsible hip
pie-itus. The same quality of rea
soning that unqualifiedly rejects
IQ tests would discard the clin
ical thermometer because it can
not distinguish malaria from
over-exposure to a sauna bath.
The predictive value of IQ
tests for success in life is best
documented in the famous Stan
ford study directed by Lewis M.
Terman, published in five vol
umes from 1925 to 1959 by the
Stanford University Press under
the revealing title Genetic Stu
dies of Genius.
Volume 5, "The Gifted Group
at Midlife," by Terman and Oden
shows that these so-called 'Ter
mites" ("gifted children" re
quired "to score within the top
1 percent of the general school
population . . .") in later life sta
tistically outperformed the na
tional average on all sensible
measures of success: for exam
ple, avoiding alcoholism and
criminal records, achieving in
tellectual distinction, etc. Fur
thermore, the natural children
of the "Termites" average 132.5
for Stanford Binet IQ, i.e., the
median child was practically in
the top 2 per cent of the general
population.
In response to the prevailing

view echoed by Dr. Poussaint
that until all environmental dif
ferences are controlled, the rela
tive importance of environment
and heridity cannot be meaning
fully determined, I assert that
scientific imagination can signifi
cantly reduce the environment
heredity uncertainty.
For example, while writing
this letter, I reached one, so far
as I can find, new research re
sult. A sample of eighteen of the
hundred or so children adopted
by "Termites" have been tested
for Binet IQ and fall distinctly
below the "Termites" natural
children. The new conclusion is
that, fragmentary though the
data are, the degree of superior
performance of the natural chil
dren above the adopted ones is
so great that this superiority had
a probability of less than one
part in forty of resulting from
pure chance.
This observation has obvious
implications for more research;
a phone call to Dr. Oden does not
suggest that more research will
be done without some new stim
ulus.
For recent surveys of the en
vironment-heredity uncertainty
and evidence that IQ tests do
read significantly through some
environmental variations. A. R.
Jensen in Estimation of the Lim
its of Heritability of Traits by
Comparison of Monozygotic and
Dizygotic Twins, proceedings of
the National Academy of Sci
ences, July 1967, concludes, "four
times as much of the variance
of intelligence is attributable to
heredity as to environment."
This same subject is again
treated and ethnic differences in
intelligence patterns are review
ed in Social Class, Race and Gen
etics: Implications for Educa
tion, American Educational Re
search Journal, Jan. 1968.
I believe that the problems I
raise are by no means solved
and must be faced by those con
cerned with their responsibilities
to future generations of man,
even though the costs in terms
of personal abuse may be high.
I would be glad to discuss pos
sible research projects with in
terested faculty members or stu
dents who share this view.

Attempted Interview
Dismays Grud Student
Editor, The Daily:
This letter is from a student,
who, worried by some of the
renowned Professor Shockley's
genetic theories, decided to ask
for an interview with that
famous individual, the aim being
to get some points cleared up in
a dialogue.
It would be ridiculous to say
my objectives were purely aca
demic. On the contrary. I sus
pected some kind of chicanery
on his part. But most of what
I had read about his reports was
from the popular press, except
one article in the National Aca
demy of Science publications.
I wanted some dialogue with
him, to register my disapproval
and doubts of his motives and
so-called scientific approach.
Appointment Probl ms
I tried to make an appointment
with his secretary, and was told
to make the appointment with
Shockley himself. I went to his
office last Tuesday, February 27,
to make the appointment, and
was confronted with a very
hostile Shockley who then pro
ceeded to regard me as one of
his graduate students, dismissed
the idea of a personal interview
unless I had proved to his satis
faction, in a written "examina
tion," that the interview was
worth his while, seeing that he
had a "disillusionment" in San
Jose.
When I mentioned the report
of that debate, Shockley imme
diately started cross questioning
me as regards the truth of the
report and its stating of his
views. In essence Dr. Shockley
told me he was a Nobel prize
winner, had a lot of admirers,
and frankly would only take
praises and not personal con
frontation, especially with a Ne
gro.
What annoyed me was that I
had not stated anything but
the purpose of my visit and de
sire for an appointment. If Dr.
Shockley refutes the accusations
of a racist and a bigot, then I
wonder what gave him the no

tion of being hostile to me on
sight?
Race Trouble
One sure sign of racist ten
dencies and bigotry is to cate
gorize a whole race as a poten
tial enemy and attack on sight,
which is what he did.
But Dr. Shockley frightened
me on a still higher plane, and
that is his unbelievable quest
for greatness. . . . Coming from
a society where humility is a
sign of greatness, and having
read of other societies where
self-esteem easily turns into a
destructive mania, the conclu
sions I draw about him are not
flattering.
If Dr. Shockley, as a result
of his reputation, feels he has
no time for people except when
they meet him on his terms,
then I wonder what he is doing
In a teaching institution. He pro
poses a theory which he knows
to be controversial then decides
to hide behind his bigotry and
reputation, from attack, or even
questioning.
Direct Questions
I do not think this is th? ap
propriate place to attack his
theories, nor do I think myself
fit to do so. But, reading his
Eight Point Statement for San
Jose, I should like to ask Shock
ley to reconsider his objectivity
or even desire to help: I quote:
"My attention in the last
three years has been brought
to focus on the genetic poten
tial for intelligence of the il
legitimate, ghetto Negro baby
for two reasons:
(1) The sickness of our na
tion shown by the problems of
racial unrest are agonizing to
all responsible citizens and are
most obviously acute for the
disadvantaged Negro minor
ity.
(2) The available facts (?)
lead me to fear that ghetto
birth rates are lowering Ne
gro hereditary potential for
intelligence, so that the result
may provoke extremes of
racism with resultant misery
for all our citizens.
And all of this according to
Shockley, occurred in the last
30 years, a "byproduct of wel
fare programs" — but failed to
occur for the last 4000 years as
a byproduct of slavery, torture
and extreme poverty! . . .
Your last "thinking five min
utes" quite frankly in my opin
ion passed as soon as you re
ceived your award — at least as
far as dealing with human be
ings is concerned.

Endowment Investment
Editor, The Daily:
Robert Spanner's article in
the February 26 Daily on Stan
ford's endowment investment
unfortunately contains a num
ber of errors and misinterpreta
tions.
I believe that a fair and ob
jective appraisal of the recent
history of university endowment
investments would place Stan
ford's performance on the com
bination of income and growth
in the top quartile. In my opin
ion, the Trustees' Committee on
Investments not only has served
ably within the context of Stan
ford's needs and generally ac
cepted investment policies, but
it is also alert to the kinds of
new approaches being suggested
by McGeorge Bundy and others.

Business Dislikes War
Editor, The Daily:
You reprinted Wall Street
Journal editorial against the
war in Viet Nam and blew me
off my rocking chair.
Someone must be reading the
capitalist's bible! Someone has
crossed the intellectual's Magin
ot Line and sullied his pure
thoughts by actually reading
the Wall Street Journal. And
maybe someone has developed
what our distinguished Prof.
Festinger has termed "cogni
tive dissonance." Perhaps some
one is upset about thinking of
the prospect that business peo
ple are logical and rational and
interested and sensitive and
human? ....
Sure, the war is good for the
economy. And if most of my
classmates and myself thought
it was a "just" war, we would
be happy—no one likes a viable

economy more than business
men. But the war in Vietnam is
a wholesale tragedy, and we are
not happy. We'd rather make
our money some other way.
Now maybe someone will be
lieve.

Autonomous Sections
Stop Uniform Action
Editor, The Dally:
Mr. Skip Tammany is upset
that Prof. Polhemus would not
order the Freshmen English
teaching assistants to allow
class time for the filling out of
Mr. Tammany's questionnaires.
Mr. Tammany seems to think
that Prof. Polhemus exercises
the kind of control over Fresh
man English sections which
would allow him to make such
a demand. He has such control,
but in fact he has not chosen to
use it this year.
He has consistently treated
Freshmen English as a group
of autonomous sections rather
than as a tightly controlled, sin
gle course. This autonomy is
very important to those of us
who teach Freshmen English,
and we think that it is ulti
mately beneficial to our stu
dents.
In any case Prowl Polhemus
has indicated ways in which
Mr. Tammany can get his ques
tionnaires filled out. If Mr. Tam
many can convince us that his
questionnaire is worth our class
time, we will be happy to give
it to him. If this is too much
trouble, too bad.

Dekes Faces Changes
In Move To Cluster
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct several
statements that were made about
Delta Kappa Epsilon in the Mar.
4 Daily.
First of all, Starr Cooke is our
House Manager, and not our
Rush Chairman.
Secondly, we are not really
low on membership. Rather we
are presently operating at only
three men short of capacity. It
is true that we will be moving
into a new house next year in
the cluster behind Wilbur, and
the capacity of this house is
fifty men.
We hope to take a pledge class
of between twenty-five and
thirty men in order to fill the
new house. This means that we
will no longer be a relatively

small house, which in the past
has been a result of our small
physical plant, and that our ac
tivities will be expanded in pro
portion to the increase in mem
bership.
We are having our best rush
in several years. We have seen
an outstandingly good cross
section of young men, and our
outlook is very positive for
building a fine pledge class. I
hope that the results of our rush
efforts thus far stand as an in
dicator of the quality of the fu
ture class.
I would like to thank Mr. Al
corn for his concern and aid in
helping me to amend the in
formation that he presented
about Delta Kappa Epsilon in
his article on this year's Frater
nity rush.

Prof Supports Strike,
Plans To Teach Class
Editor, The Dally:
I have been convinced by the
arguments of my friends that
my previously-stated position
regarding the April 11 demon
stration (strike) is incorrect
— to this extent:
I will continue to support stu
dents who wish to show their
concern over our country's in
creasing involvement in a lousy
war by staying away from class
es for a day; however, I will
meet my classes to teach any
students who do not wish to
participate in such a demon
stration of concern.

Instructor Cites Talk
Daily Failed To Cover
Editor, The Dally:
Monday of last week two
learned individuals spoke at this
University concerning the sub
ject of modern Germany. The
Daily gave detailed coverage to
the one — Dr. Eleanor Lansing
Dulles, while ignoring the other
— Dr. Hans Magnus Enzenberg
er. This was extremely unfor
tunate.
The talk by Dr. Dulles was
supposedly to have been a ser
ious discussion on 'Germany—
East and West'. In fact it turned
out to be little more than a
'Kaffeeklatsch' travelogue!
Dr. Dulles' attempt to say
something about East Germany
on the basis of the eight days
she spent there was pathetic.
She made much of the amount
of time it took for her to obtain
a visa to travel in East Ger
many. Has she ever spoken with

a European who has spent days,
weeks, even months waiting to
get a tourist visa for the USA?
On the basis of one example,
she leveled a blanket indictment
at East German housing. Take
a look at the shacks of the tene
ant farmers in the South, the
hovels of Apalachian miners,
the t nements of the slum dwell
ers of our northern cities, Dr.
Dulles!
In fact, if she had taken a
closer look at East German
housing, she might have dis
covered that it was generally
quite 'ivable and priced three or
four times cheaper than that in
West Germany.
Dr. Dulles also had some com
ments on religion in East Ger
many. On the basis of one visit
to Mass, she noted how few
young people were in attend
ance. (As East Germany is an
overwhelmingly Lutheran area
might I suggest that she was
indeed lucky to find anyone at
tending Mass.) Actually not a
great deal of young people at
tend services in the West either,
as the spiritual influence of tra
ditional German Christianity is
not terribly great.
Unenlightened Performance
On the subject of West Ger
many Dr. Dulles was hardly
more enlightening. To suggest
that German youth are in any
sizeable way responsible for the
growth of the neo-Nazi NPD in
West Germany is to dramatic
ally illustrate one's incompet
ence. The young people have
been in fact that element of
West German society where the
resistance to the neo-Nazis has
been greatest.
To further suggest that Am
ericans shouldn't worry about
the NPD because it is amateur
ish and lacks a positive program
is to reject the few lessons there
are to be learned from history.
However, for those of us who
are interested in learning some
thing about contemporary Ger
many, the time wasted listening
to Dr. Dulles was more than
balanced out by the young West
Berlin poet and political activ
ist Dr. Hans Magnus Enzen
berger, who spoke before over
70 members of the Stanford
community in the history cor
ner on Monday evening.
Dr. Enzenberger began by
reading frorn a collection of his
poems in botn English and Ger
man. This was followed by a
lively, open and straightforward
discussion with the audience
which lasted for a good 90 min
utes.
In the course of the question
ing Dr. Enzenberger, a politic

ally enagged 'le*t wing intellec
tual', expressed himself on a
variety of themes from politics
to poetry. He was particularly
interesting when dealing with
the subject of the non-parlimen
tary opposition movement and
West German youth. . .
As Dr. Enzenberger is him
self active in the 'Movement'
in West Berlin, it would seem
that here was an opportunity
for the 'Daily' to get behind the
usual wire service material.
A'so Dr. Enzenberger, a non-
Communist, had only recently
left an international cultural
congress in Havana. An inter
view with him concerning this
event might have provided the
Stanford community with some
valuable information on a sub
ject notoriously badly covered
in the American press—namely
Cuba.
As the YAF's 'Hitler in Ha
vana' was shown on the follow
ing evening, it might have help
ed to achieve some balance in
the material available at Stan
ford. . . .

Writer Offers Correct
Deferment Information
Editor, The Dally:
I am writing to correct my
own column in last Friday's
Daily. I mistakenly said that re
quests were not mentioned in
the Selective Service Regula
tions as a requirement for a
graduate 2-S deferment, and so
one might reasonably hope to
avoid making such a request.
This was true only until last
October 23, when a memor
andum from Gen. Hershey to
local boards made written re
quests mandatory for all stu
dent deferments. . . .
