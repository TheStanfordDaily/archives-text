# Women To Discuss Female Autonomy
## 
### 
Four women researchers of
the Institute for the Study of
Human Problems will discuss
"Autonomy and the Feminine
Role" this afternoon at 4:15 in
Tresidder, Room 271.
The talk will center on the
question of how much indivi
duality a woman can maintain
and still retain a feeling of ade
quacy as a woman.
Can a woman totally and
sucessfnlly Involve herself
In an activity beyond her boy
friend, husband, or family,
such as professional training,
and still maintain a close re
lationship with these people?
The discussion, which will
cover the personal, educational,
and occupational development of

a woman during and beyond her
college years, will also question
the role of men in this develop
ment.
Mrs. Marjorie Lozoff has just
finished the first draft of an
80-page research paper which
will serve as the basis for the
discussion.
In her paper, Mrs. Lozoff has
analyzed the four-year college
experience of coeds at Stanford
and the University of Califor
nia at Berkeley, and has describ
ed a variety of ways girls have
resolved this conflict of outside
involvement and their role as
women.
She stresses the importance of
men, especially fathers, who act
as "catalysts" in helping girls
seek their identity or define
themselves.
Another panel member Is
Dr. Helen Astin, who has com
pleted a paper on "The Wom
an PhD" and is working: on
the book "Career Development
of Professional Women."
Her paper studies the charac
teristics of girls who plan to con
tinue career work and the fami
ly situations of women seven
or eight years after they have
obtained their PhD.
The remaining participants are
Mrs. Peggy Comstock, a gradu
ate student in English, and Mrs.
Emily Garfield, who is working
on a psychopharmocology proj
ect for the Institute.
Mrs. Comstock has been in
volved in studying the effects of
mass media in describing wom
en.
