# McCarthy Gets Top Spot
## Petition Parties Succeed 
### 
McCarthy for President sup
porters succeeded yesterday in
obtaining the No. 1 position on
California's June 4 primary bal
lot for the candidate from Min
nesota.
Over 500 parties were organiz
ed throughout the state Tuesday
night to obtain signatures need
ed to qualify McCarthy for pri
ority on the ballot. More than
twice the 13,746 needed signa
tures were obtained.
In the Stanford-Palo Alto
area 1,331 people signed the
petitions. Many Stanford stu
dents attended a party at the
Poppycock, where 208 signa
tures were collected.
More than 300 people were at
the Poppycock, and of these, 150
registered Democratic in order
to vote for McCarthy. Funds
collected for the Senator's cam
paign totaled $307.
By contrast, only 800 signa
tures were collected in San
Francisco, whereas San Mateo
county produced 833 and Santa
Clara county yielded 2,300.

Deputy registrars reported
that most of those who register
ed Democratic at the parties had
previously been either Republi
cans or members of the newly
formed Peace and Freedom
party.
The primary in June will de
termine which Democratic can
didate will receive California's
174 votes at the Democratic Na
tional Convention this summer.
Gerald Hill, co-chairman of
the McCarthy California cam
paign, said winning the first
position on the ballot is vital
because "we are out to win
and are organized."
The pro-Johnson slate, Hill
commented, "Is in complete dis
array and raises the question
whether Johnson really is going
to run." He added that "there
does not seem to be any strong
White House organization to put
him on the ballot or to put to
gether a campaign."
Inter-party strife that has
characterized California's Demo
cratic party for the last several
years has delayed formation of

the regular party's slate of can
didates.
Hill claimed that the Caiiiornia
primary is crucial to McCar
thy's campaign because "it is
the largest delegation that has
a fighting chance to be a Mc-
Carthy delegation at the conven
tion."
He said that he gives McCar
thy a 50-50 chance of winning
the California Presidential pref
erence primary over the John
son slate, which is headed by
Attorney General Thomas C.
Lynch.
