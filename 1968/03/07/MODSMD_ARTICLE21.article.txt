# Faculty-Student Relations Subject Of Controversy
## 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Faculty office hours, the pub
lish-or-perish ethic and faculty
student relations are old friends
—old friends hi the sense that
they have been the topics for
discussion and disagreement on
college campuses for a long
time.
When Stanford department
heads talk about faculty office
hours, they come to the spirited
defense of their departments.
Prof. Thomas Moser, head
of the department of En
glish, said, "I think faculty
student relations are amazing
ly friendly and close at a uni
versity of this size."
Moser pointed to the physical

fact of the Quad as a factor that
made the faculty more accessi
ble. He said that Stanford em
phasizes teaching. In his under
graduate education at Harvard,
Moser said he was afraid to ap
proach a faculty member.
Speaking about the possibility
of getting to know students on
a more personal, individual bas
is, Moser said, "I don't have
time to flsh with my son, let
alone with a student."
Prof. Albert Hastorf, head of
the psychology department, said
that it was "highly viable" first
to get to know a student on an
intellectual basis. Hastorf noted
that through research work with
a student, he could get to know
the undergraduate on an intel
lectual and personal level.
Talking about faculty-student
receptions, Hastorf remarked, "I
find them ghastly dull. I find
myself sounding worse than
Babbitt when I have forty fresh
men over to the house."
Prof. Arthur Schawlow, head
of the physics department, said
he had a three point plan regard
ing office hours.
"First, the student should
try to solve the problem him
self. This may sound cruel,
but I was trying to do what I
thought was best for the stu
dent" If tills failed, the stu
dent should go to the T.A. and
finally to Schawlow.
Before answering a question
about publish-or-perish, Schaw
low smiled. Then he answered
simply, "We have gone beyond
publish-or-perish in the physics
department. We do not even con
sider a man unless he is highly
distinguished."
Schawlow differentiated be

tween his graduate students who
are doing research for him and
his undergraduates. "If a stu
dent is doing research for me,
I'm available any time, day or
night."
The students appear to have
an ambivalent attitude toward
the faculty. Some speak in
terms of their appreciation of
the faculty's friendliness and
general availability.
Others, however, carry consid
erable hostility toward what
they consider to be a cloistered
faculty that prays to the idol
of publish-or-perish.
Several students made com
ments on the faculty's avail
ability. Chris Stacey, a Junior
biology major, said he didn't
pay any attention to the fac
ulty. He noted it was easier to
find a friend who knew how
to do a problem than to search
out a T.A.
Hal Baer, a sophomore pre
med student, said teachers at
Stanford treat the student as an
equal rather than as an inferior.
"Most professors' hours are ade
quate, but some of the T.A.'s
should have more office hours,"
he said.
Marilyn Mayo, a senior sociol
ogy major, said, "Students have
to make the effort. Teachers
aren't going to extend them
selves before students make the
initial effort."
Doug Rosbene, a senior psy
chology major, took a more crit
ical stance when he remarked,
"Interpersonal relations between
the faculty and students only
occur when the student is very
excited about the course or is
doing poorly."

BLACK POWER—America Is a "sickly society" In which confrontation between the poor and the
power structure is urgently needed. Organizer Stoney Cooks claimed this yesterday as he discussed
plans for the Spring Mobilization that Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Council
is sponsoring. Speaking at White Plaza, Cooks declared that when the Mobilization takes place in
Washington, D.C., "We're intending civil disobedience; we intend to disrupt that city." The Mobiliza
tion is expected to begin May 21 and reach its peak by May 30.
Kenny Washington, co-chairman of the Stanford Black Student Union, made an appeal for stu
dents to attend Huey P. Newton's trial starting this morning at 9:00. Washington said white stu
dents had to decide if they are "part of white America, or a human being without color."
