## 'Time' Publisher Took LSD 
### 
A biography of Henry R. Luce,
published last Friday, says that
the late publisher of Time Inc.
took LSD several times along
with his wife, Clare Booth Luce.
The book, 'Luce,' was writ
ten by John Kobler and pub
lished by Doubleday.
Kobler wrote that Mr. Luce
took his first "trip" at his home

in Phoenix. "Luce, who was tone
deaf, said he heard marvelous
music and, wandering out into a
cactus garden, he conducted an
imaginary orchestra," Kobler re
ported.
Mrs. Luce was painting when
she first took LSD, Mr. Kobler
related, and she reported ex
periencing an enhanced appre
ciation of colors.

Kobler said that the Luces
took LSD for the first time un
der the guidance of Dr. Sidney
Cohen, an authority on hallucin
atory drugs. Dr. Cohen is chief
of psychosomatic medicine at
the Los Angeles Veterans Hos
pital.
Mr. and Mrs. Luce repeated
the experience half a dozen
times, Kobler wrote.
Cohen said in a telephone in
terview Friday night that the
Luces took LSD "once or twice
about eight or nine years ago,"
but did not take it after that.
"A number of years ago," he
said, "I was looking for highly
gifted people to learn about how
LSD affected the creative pro
cess. I had known the Luces be
fore, and they volunteered for
the experiment."
Luce died at the age of 68 on
Feb. 28, 1967, in Phoenix, Ariz.,
of a heart attack.
