# Harvard Expands Science Program
## 
### 
Harvard University will seek
nearly $50-million in A Program
for Science in Harvard College
— aimed especially at putting
new zest in the undergraduate
instruction in science.
"We recognize a double re
sponsibility," Dean Franklin L.
Ford explained. "We must ask
ourselves how best to continue
and improve Harvard's share —
and it has been a large share —
in producing America's most im
portant. and creative scientists.
"At the same time, we must
consider ways of enriching and
expanding the education of oth
er students who will go on to
positions in business, govern
ment, and the professions (no
tably including education) where
they will have to make deci
sions calling for some degree
of understanding of what mod
ern science is and how its prac
titioners attack intellectual prob
lems."
Dean Ford noted that one
quarter of the students in each

class In Harvard College con
centrate their studies in the sci
ences.
A $14,500,000 Science Center
— whose laboratories, library,
computer connections, and dem
onstration classrooms will en
courage student activity in As
tronomy, Biology, Biochemistry,
Chemistry, Geological Sciences,
Mathematics, Physics, and Engi
neering and Applied Physics —
is the central element of the Pro
gram for Science.
Undergraduate research—now
hampered by competition with
the needs of graduate and post
doctoral research — will have
experimental space in the new
Science Center. Dean Ford noted
that many college students now
are performing at the graduate
level of study and research.
