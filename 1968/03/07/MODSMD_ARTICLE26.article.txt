# Ex-General Hits U.S. Policy, Calls Vietnam War 'Illegal'
## 
### LETA ZUKERMAN 
Retired General Hugh B. Hes
ter lambasted U.S. policy in
Vietnam yesterday in a lecture
at Tresidder. "What we're doing
in Southeast Asia," he said, "is
what the Japanese tried to do
in the '20's when they attacked
China.... Vietnam is purely in
cidental to us. The target is
China."
Hester based his attack on
two issues. In the first place, he
cited the illegality of the con
flict. "Even if Congress had de
clared war, this fighting would
be illegal until we opted out of
the United Nations in view of
all our treaties," he said.
His second and most Im
portant objection was that the
Vietnam war "poses the great
est peril in human history.
. . . Those who say 'let's get
a swift victory in Vietnam'
are, in effect, saying, 'Let's
start World War Three,' for
there would certainly be a
war with China."

And this, he emphasized, is
not self-defense or national de
fense. "It is not in the interests
of the American people." For if
there were a war we would all
use the nuclear weapons we pos
sess.
With conventional weapons,
said Hester, "China can run us
into the sea with her manpower
.... But we would use all pos
sible more powerful weapons
before we would submit."
Hester stated emphatically
that Americans don't realize the
strength of China. "The propa
ganda that China is going
through a civil war like ours is
false; what's going on today
is strengthening China for war
—even thermonuclear."
On the question of whether
Russia would step into the war
Hester reminded the audience
that "every time there has been
a crisis, the USSR has tried to
stay out."
They have given arms, but
not men, to Vietnam. "The

USSR won't come into a direct
war with the United States un
less attacked," he said.
He concluded that the
"world-wide Communist con
spiracy" is merely propagan
da. "They are Russians before
they are Communists."
But, he hypothesized, if the
U.S. tried to gain control of
Southeast Asia by entering into
a war with China, Russia would
certainly supply nuclear weap
ons to China. "This is the
greatest danger. Hitler could not
have destroyed the world; we
can."

cidental to us. The target is
China."
Hester based his attack on
two issues. In the first place, he
cited the illegality of the con
flict. "Even if Congress had de
clared war, this fighting would
be illegal until we opted out of
the United Nations in view of
all our treaties," he said.
His second and most Im
portant objection was that the
Vietnam war "poses the great
est peril in human history.
. . . Those who say 'let's get
a swift victory in Vietnam'
are, in effect, saying, 'Let's
start World War Three,' for
there would certainly be a
war with China."

And this, he emphasized, is
not self-defense or national de
fense. "It is not in the interests
of the American people." For if
there were a war we would all
use the nuclear weapons we pos
sess.
With conventional weapons,
said Hester, "China can run us
into the sea with her manpower
.... But we would use all pos
sible more powerful weapons
before we would submit."
Hester stated emphatically
that Americans don't realize the
strength of China. "The propa
ganda that China is going
through a civil war like ours is
false; what's going on today
is strengthening China for war
—even thermonuclear."
On the question of whether
Russia would step into the war
Hester reminded the audience
that "every time there has been
a crisis, the USSR has tried to
stay out."
They have given arms, but
not men, to Vietnam. "The

USSR won't come into a direct
war with the United States un
less attacked," he said.
He concluded that the
"world-wide Communist con
spiracy" is merely propagan
da. "They are Russians before
they are Communists."
But, he hypothesized, if the
U.S. tried to gain control of
Southeast Asia by entering into
a war with China, Russia would
certainly supply nuclear weap
ons to China. "This is the
greatest danger. Hitler could not
have destroyed the world; we
can."
Retired General Hugh B. Hes
ter lambasted U.S. policy in
Vietnam yesterday in a lecture
at Tresidder. "What we're doing
in Southeast Asia," he said, "is
what the Japanese tried to do
in the '20's when they attacked
China.... Vietnam is purely in
cidental to us. The target is
China."
