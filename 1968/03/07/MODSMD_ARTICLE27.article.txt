# Fresno Protestors Support Ex-Stanford Grad Fellow
## 
### 
A large demonstration consist
ing of three hundred students
was held at Fresno State Col
lege yesterday in support of a
former Stanford graduate fellow
who is being fired from Fresno
State.
Assistant Professor Robert
Mezey, 32, a former San Fran
ciscan and prize winning poet,
was told by the college adminis
tration last Friday that his con
tract will not be renewed for the
spring term.
Mezey's outspoken views on
"marijuana, on sexuality and in
general on our social structure
have made him a controversial
figure both on and off the cam
pus," a college spokesman de
clared.

However, it would not be
proper to say whether these
views led directly to Mezey's
loss of contract, the spokesman
added, since the case is going
through the college's appeals
procedure.
"We intend to exhaust all le
gal channels, although I don't
have a great deal of faith in
them," Mezey asserted.
During the demonstration
speakers called the dismissal a
blow to academic freedom. Some
students stayed away from their
English classes, but the college
spokesman said the intended
boycott was "spotty".
Mezey won the Lamont Award
for a book of his poems when he
held a poetry fellowship at Stan
ford in 1960.
