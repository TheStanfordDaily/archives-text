# 'Smarter Students'
## Grade Point Averages Going Up 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Have the grades at Stanford
gone up in recent years, or has
curve grading left the campus
average unchanged?
Is it easier to get a high grade
now, or are most students simp
ly smarter than before?
There are a variety of an
swers to these questions.
According to John Hanson,
assistant dean of students, the
grades are going up. Since the
1960-1961 school year the all
campus average has risen from
2.54 to an all-time high of 2.72
in 1965-66. While this rise may
not seem significant, the cam
pus average in 1948 was 2.56,
nearly the same figure as 1961's
total.
Obviously the grades are go
ing up, but why? Hanson says
the rise la attributable to stu
dents being smarter and more
motivated. College admis
sions are more selective: At
Stanford one out of four ap
plicants are now accepted.
Thus the students are more
capable than ever before.
Along with this increased abil
ity, the students are more am
bitious than in past years.
decide in many cases before
they come to Stanford what
their majors and careers will be.

They have definite reasons for
being here whether to dodge
the draft or become an engineer.
One result of this motivation
can be seen in the SES recom
mendations to liberalize general
studies requirements and free
students to more completely fol
low their own proclivities.
Another reason explains the
current high grades. Many stu
dents continue to study hard
since all their hopes hinge on
getting into graduate school.
Some schools have a cut-off
point below which they will not
consider applications.
But student efforts are just
one side of the coin. In some
cases the faculty appears to be
more lenient in grading than
ever before. Hanson says,"I
know a handful of the faculty
that are sympathetic to students
today."
If this Is true, for what rea
sons? Professors realize that
students are under a greater
pressure to make grad school
or at least avoid the draft.
Hanson says, "Some have
these factors in the back of
their minds when they grade."
Hanson also points out that
marginal performances are of
ten met with a higher mark
than did the same efforts in the

mid-50's since some professors
are willing to give students cred
it for being more intelligent.
However, he cautioned that
this factor of faculty considera
tion may not be as important
as it seems. The main reason
for higher grades lies with the
improved quality of the Stan
ford student, according to the
dean.
What effect does the curve
grading system have on a stu
dent?
Professor Hubert Marshall,
chairman of a committee thai
reviewed the curve six years
ago, says that the system is "an
attempt to make grades at Stan
ford more relative."
It was felt at the time of the
committee's investigation that
in the first place freshmen were
under too great a pressure with
the curve and that secondly the
system with its weighted scales
of grading was denying some
good students entrance into
grad school.
In checking out these claims,
Marshall said, "We tried to
find empirical evidence that
freshmen felt too pressured."
But it was difficult to prove
that removing the curve would
significantly alleviate the
"pressure."

The committee also sent out
a questionnaire to more than
60 grad schools asking how they
evaluated Stanford grades. The
questionnaire sought to deter
mine whether the curve actually
was keeping many students from
qualifying for graduate schools.
"The answers were unmis
takable," says Marshall. The
schools took into account that

a 2.5 GPA hore may be a rela
tively higher mark than a 3.5
at San Jose State.
"Thus the curve may have
cut down the number of high
marks, but usually a student at
Stanford, since he is reputed to
be so intelligent, can compete on
even terms with students at an
other university who has a much
higher average.
