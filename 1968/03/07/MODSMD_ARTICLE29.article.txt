# Psychologist Urges Revision Of Pot Possession Penalties
## 
### 
A psychologist who directs the
country's largest Federally spon
sored drug education project
recommended yesterday that
laws against the possession of
marijuana be removed, but at
the same time warned against
complete legalization of the
drug.
Dr. Helen H. Nowlis, director
of a drug education project of
the National Association of Stu
dent Personnel Administrators,

told a Senate fact-finding sub
committee that while she con
demned penalties for the posses
sion of marijuana, she did favor
controlling the manufacture and
distribution of LSD and other
harmful drugs.
"I strongly feel that all crimi
nal sanctions for possession
should be removed," she said.
"The assumptions on which the
laws were based have one by
one been proved incorrect"

"They not enforceable in
the sense that any large portion
of users can be arrested," she
continued. "There is little worse
than a bad law which is widely
ignored."
Dr. Nowlis, former dean of
students at the University of Ro
chester, became director of the
federally sponsored drug educa
tion project in 1966.
The project, financed by the
Food and Drug Administration,
seeks to inform public health of
ficials, college deans and counsel
lors and help them deal with the
problems created by the increas
ing use of drugs among stu
dents.
The Administration has pro
posed that penalties for the man
ufacture and distribution of LSD
and other harmful drugs be in
creased, and that mere posses
sion of them be made a misde
meanor.
Testifying at the opening hear
ings of the juvenile delinquency
subcommittee, however, Dr.
Nowlis and Dr. James L. God
dard, commissioner of Food and
Drugs, were hesitant to increase
the penalty for possession of
drugs.
Goddard favored making the
manufacture and distribution of
LSD a felony, but doubted that
more stringent penalties for pos
session of drugs would signifi
cantly reduce their use.
Both doctors stressed an edu
cational approach to curbing
drug abuse.
