# Parking Citations: 800 Unanswered

More than 800 parking cita
tions issued by the University
police have gone unanswered

since mst September, according
to Assistant Chief Thomas Bell.
Most of the non-respondants
are secretarial and office staff
members although two are pro
fessors of law.
The majority of the delinquent
persons park on the west side
of the campus, Bell said.
Though the police can put a
hold on a student's registration
when he does not pay a parking
ticket, there is as yet no penalty
for non payment on the part of
faculty and staff.
Since the Stanford police are
not county sheriff's deputies but
are legally a private police force,
they cannot go to court over
failures to pay tickets.
But according to Bell the Uni
versity could impose some sort
of penalty on staff and faculty
members for non payment.
He says the police have sent
the list of delinquents to the
University Manager's Office in
hopes that office will do some
thing to punish the offenders.
"This sort of thing is relative
ly normal here," Bell said, "But
it is very upsetting."
