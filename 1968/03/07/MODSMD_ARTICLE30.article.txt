# 'Crimson' Supports Induction Refusers

### 
The Harvard Crimson in a ma
jor editorial yesterday supported
"those students who, for moral
reasons, refuse to serve in the
armed services during the war
in Vietnam."
The editorial asserted, "each
day provides new evidence that
the war in Vietnam cannot and
should not be won; a generation
of students has understandably
turned Its face away from Wash
ington and traditional channels
of political protest."
"Refusal to serve in the armecT
forces has been popularly la
beled an act of cowardice," the
Crimson added, "it is in fact a

courageous political act. It is
one man weighing in against his
government's war policy —at
groat potential cost to himself—
far more effectively than he
could ever weigh in with a vote,
if he were old enough to vote."
The policy was reached at a
meeting of the newspaper's 50
editors Sunday. Though the
number of editors voting for a
policy is not made public, the
absence of any minority edito
rial implies that support was
unanimous.
The draft resistance endorse
ment by the 95-year-old nder
graduate daily is one of th- first
by any college newspaper.
