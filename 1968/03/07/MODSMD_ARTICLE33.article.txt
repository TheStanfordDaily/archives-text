# Chi's Grab IM Title, 68-34
## 
### 
Sigma Chi Omega, after get
ting off to a shaky start, de
stroyed Kappa Alpha yesterday
68-34, to take the Intramural
Basketball Championship. The
Theta Delts waltzed to the "B'
championship with a 53-29 vic
tory over the SAE B team Tues
day night.
The Chi's balanced scoring at
tack and rebounding power to
tally dominated the game. Four
Chi's hit double figures. John
Tracy led the way with 15, fol
lowed by Pat Canfield with 14,

and Larry Rozenzweig and Bob
Mallek with 12 apiece. Roily Reg
nery chipped in with eight and
held the KA's hot shooting
guard Stu Boyd to a single field
goal in the second half.
Boyd had ripped the nets for
14 points In the opening peri
od, all from the outside with
several Chi hands in his eyes.
But he lost the touch in the
second half and finished with
17, still good enough for high
point honors.
Boyd got little support, how

ever, as no other KA hit for
more than two field goals. Bob
McCleary, who had scored 17 in
the KA's 59-44 semifinal win
over the Delts, couldn't find the
range and finished with five.
Both teams were shaky at the
start. The Chi's used a wide
open offense with excellent pick
ing and screening, and regularly
had men wide open underneath
for easy layins. But they kept
blowing the easy shots and
trailed 16-13 after about ten min
utes.
But three straight fast break

buckets turned the tide, and the
Chi's pulled away to a 29-21 half
time lead.
The second half was all
Sigma Chi as KA managed
just four field goals. The Chi's

OOF! Sigma Chi Omega's 6-10 center Larry Rosenzweig vehemently
bats away a KA shot. The ret, however maintained that he also
batted away the KA, and whistled a foul.
Sigma Chi Omega, after get
ting off to a shaky start, de
stroyed Kappa Alpha yesterday
68-34, to take the Intramural
Basketball Championship. The
Theta Delts waltzed to the "B'
championship with a 53-29 vic
tory over the SAE B team Tues
day night.
The Chi's balanced scoring at
tack and rebounding power to
tally dominated the game. Four
Chi's hit double figures. John
Tracy led the way with 15, fol
lowed by Pat Canfield with 14,

and Larry Rozenzweig and Bob
Mallek with 12 apiece. Roily Reg
nery chipped in with eight and
held the KA's hot shooting
guard Stu Boyd to a single field
goal in the second half.
Boyd had ripped the nets for
14 points In the opening peri
od, all from the outside with
several Chi hands in his eyes.
But he lost the touch in the
second half and finished with
17, still good enough for high
point honors.
Boyd got little support, how

ever, as no other KA hit for
more than two field goals. Bob
McCleary, who had scored 17 in
the KA's 59-44 semifinal win
over the Delts, couldn't find the
range and finished with five.
Both teams were shaky at the
start. The Chi's used a wide
open offense with excellent pick
ing and screening, and regularly
had men wide open underneath
for easy layins. But they kept
blowing the easy shots and
trailed 16-13 after about ten min
utes.
But three straight fast break

buckets turned the tide, and the
Chi's pulled away to a 29-21 half
time lead.
The second half was all
Sigma Chi as KA managed
just four field goals. The Chi's
