## The 						Wall Game 
### Dave Noland 
The English play a lot of weird sports. Cricket, for example, with
its playing time of several days and scores running up to 500,
never ceases to amaze and puzzle any baseball-born and bred Amer
ican.
But the ultimate weird English sport is undoubtedely the Eton
Wall Game.
The Eton Wall Game is so exclusive that it is played in just one
location in the entire world—up against a certain wall at Eton
College, near Windsor.
And, to make it even more exclusive, it is played just once a
year, on St. Andrews Day (November 30).
Action is not the Wall Game's strong point. Unlike cricket, it is
not a high-scoring game. As a matter of fact, the last 57 Wall
Games have ended in scoreless ties. The last goal was scored in
• 1911.
The object of the game is to push a ball the length of a field
bounded on one side by the Wall and on the other side by a small
furrow (known officially in the rule book as "The Furrow"). The
playing field is 120 yards long and six yards wide.
After a team has successfully crossed their opponents goal line
(this happens about once every 10 years), they are entitled to try
for a goal.
A goal Is scored by throwing the ball at a certain tree about 30
yards from the Wall (known as "The Tree") or at the Head
Master's garden door ("The Door") at the other end of the Wall.
Penalties are very explicit. For example, Rule XXXVII provides
a 10-yard penalty for "willful furking when not in Calx."
(The mind boggles at the thought of a rhubarb about this rule—
"But ref, I didn't mean to furk. It was an accident. Besides, I was
in Calx when I furked!"
"Sorry, son, that was willful furking if I've ever seen it! And you
were at least two feet out of Calx when the furking took place.")
Unnecessary roughness is also prohibited. Rule XIII warns omin
ously, "Stamping with the foot, that is to say lifting the foot into
the air and bringing it down on any part of an opponent, is not
allowed."
The Wall Game is perhaps best summed up by the last paragraph
of an official description of the game issued by the office of the
Head Master of Eton:
"The Wall Game is exceptionally exhausting, very skillful, and
extremely amusing to play. The skill consists of the scientific appli
cation of pressure and leverage as one advances foot by foot
through a seemingly impenetrable mass of determined and husky
opponents. No sport offers less to the spectator."
I say, anyone for Wall Game?

Bruce Merry, an Englishman and rugby purist to the nth degree
(being English is a prerequisite to being a true rugby purist), has
informed The Daily of a gross error in our sports coverage.
Rugby, it seems, is not properly called by that name, but either
"rugger" or "Rugby football"—never just lain old "rugby."
Sorry, Bruce, but this is America, and we heathen Yanks say
"rugby." And, barbaric though it may be, for the sake of main
taining a modjcum of comprehensibility in an almost incompre
hensible sport, we'll continue to use it.
May the god of rugby (oops, rugger) have mercy on us.
