# Rohlfing's Bat Booms
## Tribe Trims UOP, 2-1 
### GARY CAVALLI 
Stanford parlayed the hitting
of Jeff Rohlfing and the pitch
ing of Phil Keller and Frank
Klinger to edge UOP 2-1 on the
Sunken Diamond Tuesday.
Rohlfing stroked four straight
singles, raising his batting av
erage to an astronomical .516,
and scored the decisive run in
the Tribe's ninth victory in 10
starts.
Keller struck out 13 UOP hit
ters and yielded only five hits
before getting into a jam in the
eighth inning. Senior fireman
Klinger came on to bail out the
soph righthander, and quickly
snuffed out the Pacific threat.
The Indians scored in the
opening frame on some alert
baserunning by Mark Marquess.
After walking with one out,
Marquess stole second, ad
vanced to third on a grounder

to the right side by Mike Shoe
maker, and came across on a
wild pitch by UOP's John Stroh
mayer.
Rohlfing was responsible for
both Stanford's second run and
UOP's lone tally. In the sixth,
the senior right-fielder singled,
stole second, moved to third on
Russ Tweet's single, and scored
on a beautiful sacrifice bunt by
Bob Ewing.
UOP's Rip Van Winkle singled
in the first half of the seventh,
but Rohlfing misplayed the safe
ty into a three-bagger. Dan
Flores followed with an RBI
single to ruin Keller's shutout.
Once again speed played an
important part in the Indian
triumph, as steals led to both
Stanford runs. Coach Ray
Young's club has now stolen 23

bases on the year, compared to
only two thefts for the opposi
tion.

singles, raising his batting av
erage to an astronomical .516,
and scored the decisive run in
the Tribe's ninth victory in 10
starts.
Keller struck out 13 UOP hit
ters and yielded only five hits
before getting into a jam in the
eighth inning. Senior fireman
Klinger came on to bail out the
soph righthander, and quickly
snuffed out the Pacific threat.
The Indians scored in the
opening frame on some alert
baserunning by Mark Marquess.
After walking with one out,
Marquess stole second, ad
vanced to third on a grounder

to the right side by Mike Shoe
maker, and came across on a
wild pitch by UOP's John Stroh
mayer.
Rohlfing was responsible for
both Stanford's second run and
UOP's lone tally. In the sixth,
the senior right-fielder singled,
stole second, moved to third on
Russ Tweet's single, and scored
on a beautiful sacrifice bunt by
Bob Ewing.
UOP's Rip Van Winkle singled
in the first half of the seventh,
but Rohlfing misplayed the safe
ty into a three-bagger. Dan
Flores followed with an RBI
single to ruin Keller's shutout.
Once again speed played an
important part in the Indian
triumph, as steals led to both
Stanford runs. Coach Ray
Young's club has now stolen 23

bases on the year, compared to
only two thefts for the opposi
tion.
