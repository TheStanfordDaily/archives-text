# Summer Festival Groups To Return
## 
### 
s This year's Stanford Summer
Festival of the Arts will feature
two groups which were high
lights of last summer's program,
it was announced recently.
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band, a New Orleans group, and
Pro Musica, a New York medie
val music ensemble, both of
which played to over flow audi
ences last year, have agreed to
return for the 1968 Festival.
Pro Musics, a group of six
singers and five Instrumental
ists, will play In Dinkelspiel
Auditorium on July 10,14, and
20.
The performers will remain on
campus, however, to participate
as artists-in-residence in the "In
stitute in the Performance of
Early Music" program of the
university summer session.
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band, headed by 60 year-old Bil
lie Pierce and her husband, De-
De, a blind cornet player, will

attempt to recapture the enthu
siasm and praise of critics it
merited last summer.
"Preservation Hall is one of
the most popular groups ever to
appear in our program," said
Stephen A. Baffrey, executive
producer of the Festival. . .
we're pleased they are able to
return."
The theme of this year's festi
val is "Fifth Anniversary Sea
son". The program, to take place
June 25-August 4, will feature
professional music, dance, dra
ma, film and art events, as well
as student productions, audience
briefings and lectures.
Among the groups sched
uled to participate are the Bay
Area Association of Producing
Artists and the Broadway rep
ertory theater company.
Like the members of Pro Mu
sica, many of the professionals
in the program will teach in rele
vant classes of the Stanford
summer session.
