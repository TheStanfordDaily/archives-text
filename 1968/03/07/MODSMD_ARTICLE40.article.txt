JOHANNESBURG, South Af
rica (AP) â€” Christiaan N. Bar
nard's heart transplants brought
him a blaze of publicity and
overnight made him probably
the best known medical figure
in the world. They also brought
him a pile of abuse.
Doctors in Britain, Canada, the
Soviet Union and the United
States accused him of carrying
out experimental surgery before

he knew enough from animal re
search to try his hand on a hu
man being.
More doctors, angry at a se
ries of Barnard television ap
pearances and widespread news
paper coverage of him and his
operations, complained that he
was a publicity seeker.
Barnard retorted that he and
his team of specialists were con
fident they were ready for the

operation. As for publicity, the
tremendous interest created by
the world's first human heart
transplant had snowballed be
yond control.
Barnard's first patient, Louis
Washkansky, 53, di ed from
pneumonia 18 days after the op
eration.
Encouraged by what he
learned, Barnard gave a new
heart to retired dentist Philip
Blaiberg, 58, Jan .2. Blaiberg has
shown a dramatic improvement
in health.
Virtually all criticism con
demning the transplants came
from outside South Africa, and
the South African medical jour
nal "Medical Proceedings"
sprang to defend Barnard.
"Is there not just simple envy
and resentment that the achieve
ment by medical practitioners
who were mistaken for a bunch
of jungle doctors ... catapulted
this small country into the fore
front of medical advance?" it
asked.
Both Washkansky and Blai
berg, it added, were dying men
who had nothing to lose by ask
ing for heart transplants.
During a Barnard television
program in London, one medical
critic commented on "nauseat
ing" publicity surrounding Bar
nard's operations and said: "Pa
tients give me their trust pri
vately as a doctor and I am not
going to divulge anything about
them."
Barnard countered by saying:
"I don't want publicity; I
wouldn't encourage it." "What
can publicity do for me? I still
earn my same salary. Even if I
had 10,000 patients the publicity
is not going to improve my fi
nancial status. I am not in pri
vate practice."
