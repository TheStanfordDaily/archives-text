# University Officials Blast HEW Funds Restriction
## 
### PAT McMAHON 
The University yesterday ac
cepted under protest a new gov
ernment restriction barring the
use of certain federal funds for
"payment, assistance, or ser
vices" to persons convicted of
riot activity or civil disorder.
The new restriction applies to
all 1968 appropriations of the
Department of Health, Educa
tion, and Welfare (HEW). It was
submitted as an amendment to
the HEW appropriations bill by
Congressman James Broyhill
(R-N.C.) and signed into law on
Nov. 8, 1967.
The amendment was ap
proved with Httle notice and
only in the last two weeks
has It become officially part
of HEW contracts and grants,
Earl Cilley, University re
search administrator said yes
terday.
A telegram sent yesterday
afternoon to the Office of Edu
cation (a HEW division) Con
tracts Division by Cilley and
cleared with Provost Richard
Lyman said "the University
wishes to register in strongest
terms its concern and dismay
over the addition to the terms of
the contract of the "Anti-Rict"
Provision of P.L. 90-132 (Sec
tion 907.)
"The University wishes it un
derstood that it regards the pro
vision as practically speaking,
unenforceable, misguided, and
without reasonable relationship
to the central purposes of the
Act . .
The controversial anti-riot

provision bars funding for in
dividuals convicted "of inciting,
promoting, or carrying on a riot,
or any group activity resulting
in material damage to property
or injury to persons, found to
be in violation of Federal, State,
or local laws designed to pro*
tect persons or property in the
community concerned."
According to Cilley, Univers
ity lawyers reported that be
cause the restriction is an act
of Congress, negotiating with
HEW is impossible.
The telegram concluded:
"Believing the provision to be
inimical to the Interest of both
parties, we urge you to take
action to: 1) explore the pos
sibility with Agency and De
partment counsel of modify
ing the clause as It presently
stands; and 2) prevent the
extension of the effective per
iod of the provision beyond
June 30, 1968."
Cilley estimated the money in
volved at about $25 million in
research and construction funds
appropriated under the HEW
appropriation bill for the fiscal
year 1968.
According to Provost Richard
Lyman, a possible remedy might
be through the courts "Since I
believe it is unconstitutional."
Furthermore, he said yester
day that "a university that en
gages in a major way in a busi
ness strongly resembling crim
inal investigation risks that
very climate of freedom which
is the essential basis of the edu
cational mission."

Lyman reported that a joint
statement would be issued soon
by "a considerable group of ma
jor universities" regarding the
provision. He added he intends
"to keep exploring every pos
sible way" to delete the restric
tion.
'This is not the sort of legis
lation that's going to have any
effect on riots," Lyman said. He
called it "far too oblique" to
have an effect and pointed out
that it refers to not only politi
cally-motivated riots, but also
any kind of civil disorder.
"One can foresee an almost
infinite number of ridiculous
situations arising," Lyman
noted. To explain the difficulty

In enforcing: the restriction, he
cited several examples:
• A doctor or the hospital
could conceivably not be able to
treat a patient who at some time
was involved in civil disorder,
because the patient was indirect
ly receiving benefits from the
HEW money that may have
gone into hospital equipment or
the doctor's training.
• Books purchased for the li
brary under a HEW grant could
not be available to a convicted
rioter since it would be "assist
ance or service."
Cilley pointed out that In the
hospital case a person treated
might have to sign a statement
saying that if he is in the future
ever involved in civil disorder,
he will repay the amount he may
have gained through the 1968
fiscal appropriation.
Lyman added that a person
must be convicted after Novem
ber 8, 1967, (the date the restric
tion became law) and before
June 30, 1968, (the end of fiscal
year, 1968) to be affected by the
provision.
Cilley said that there was
"sympathy for universities'
plight" at HEW, but that they
must include it in their con
tracts. He said they tried for
some time to keep the restric
tion from the contracts but did
not succeed.
The text of the provision:
"The contractor agrees that
no part of the funds derived
from this contract shall be
used to provide payments, as
sistance, or services, in any
form, with respect to any indi
vidual convicted in any Federal,
State, or local court of compet
ent jurisdiction, of inciting, pro
moting, or carrying on a riot,
or any group activity resulting
in material damage to property
or injury to persons, found to
be in violation of Federal, State,
or local laws designed to pro
tect persons or property in the
community concerned."
