• L.A. School Boycott
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Hun
dreds of high school students,
in the second day of boycotts,
refused to go to classes in four
schools Wednesday and gathered
in restive crowds that flared in
to incidents of violence.
Two policemen dispersing stu

were hit by flying bottles. One
was hospitalized for treatment
of an eye cut.
Policemen declared a "tactical
alert" after 200 students left
their classrooms and swarmed
into the street. At first the stu

bottles were peppering police
cars and a television news car.

Analysts called it a technical

the way of big news to change
fundamental conditions in Wall

credibility, however, so that it
was obvious that not only in

The Dow Jones industrial av

Prices rose from the start and
