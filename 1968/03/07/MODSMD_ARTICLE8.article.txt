# IJB Hearing Postponed
## 
### 
Tonight's scheduled Interim
Judicial Body (IJB) hearing of
Dean of Students Joel Smith's
appeal in the case of nine stu
dents recently acquitted of
charges of violating University
policy on campus demonstra
tions has been cancelled.
The announcement was made
by Howard R. Williams, law pro
fessor and chairman of the IJB.
The full statement reads:
"At the request of Joel P.
Smith, associate provost and
dean of students, the Interim Ju
dicial Body has granted a con
tinuance of the March 7, 1968
hearing in the pending discipli
nary action against Yale M.
Braunsteln et.
The demonstrators were found
not guilty by th« Judicial Coun
cil. The Council ruled that the
policy on demonstrations was
"overbroad and vague," and
therefore unenforceable.
The Judicial Council has re
fused to surrender tapes of the
trial to either Smith or the ÜB.
