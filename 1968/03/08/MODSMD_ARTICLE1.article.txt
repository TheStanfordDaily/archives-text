# The 						university as employment agency

From Harvard Yard to Madison
and Berkeley, students are
taking into their own hands
and hearts, what university admin
istrators have failed to take into
their hands or their minds: the prob
lem of the obligation of the univer
sity to private corporations and to
government. Students are protest
ing and, where protests are ineffec
tive, demonstrating against the prac
tice of lending the facilities of the
university to recruitment of stu
dents by corporations and the mili
tary. Sometimes their protest takes
the form of forcibly banning recruit
ers from university facilities, thus
exposing them to the wrath of deans
and presidents who, unwilling to
face the central issue of on-campus
recruitment, embrace with enthusi
asm the marginal issue of bad man
ers.
For the explosion of this contro
versy on campus, the university au
thorities have only themselves to
blame for not formulating any pol
icy which could stand the test of
logical scrutiny. Most of them are
still sullenly taking refuge in pre
cedent, or involving irrelevant argu
ments of "freedom of information."
Student demonstrations against re
cruitment are, then, a monument to
the absence of foresight and of
imagination in university adminis
trators, and an excess of imagination
in students. All who are concerned
with the academic enterprise will
agree that an excess of imagination
and of moral passion in the young
is to be preferred to the absense of
either in their elders.
The basic principle which should
govern the relations of the univer
sity to recruiters is that which
should govern all other activities of
the academy. The university is not
an employment agency; it is not an
adjunct of corporations; it is not an
instrument of government. Wher
ever feasible the university should
make available its facilities to legiti
mate educational enterprises. It is
under no obligation whatsoever to
make its facilities available to what
is not educational.
Guided by this simple principle
the university can deal with the
awkward problem of recruiting
with reasonable consistency and
fairness. There are and will be ex
ceptions — and borderline cases
as Supreme Court opinions testify
daily — exceptions and borderline
cases in the interpretation of the

Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
So far, however, none of these bor
derline cases has caused any diffi
culties. Students have not protested
against recruitment by the Peace
Corps, or Head Start, or the United
Nations, and it is unlikely that they
will. The organizations whose re
cruiting has precipitated the crisis
throughout the academic world are
not borderline cases. By no stretch
of the imagination can it be alleged
that Dow Chemical Company, the
Marines or the CIA are educational
enterprises, or that they contribute
to the educational enterprise. Dow
Chemical is a business corporation;
its business is to make money, and
it recruits students at universities
because that is one of the ways it
hopes to make money. No univer
sity is under any obligation what
ever to help Dow Chemical make
money. The Marines and the Navy,
admirable as they no doubt are, are
not educational enterprises. Their
business is to fight. The university
is an interested party in this enter
prise, just as it is an interested party
in tax collecting or in the maintain
ance of law and order, but it is under

no more obligation to lend its facil
ities to the Marines and the Navy
than it is to lend them to the Depart
ment of the Treasury or the Depart
ment of Justice.
But, it is asserted, every student
has a right to hear what these : and
other, organizations have to say. So
they have, and a university which
sought to deny them this right
would be derelict in its duty to its
students, and to its own character.
The argument is, however, wholly
irrelevant to the situation which
confronts us. Every student has a
right to a great many things that the
university is not obliged to provide.
He has a right to read all newspa
pers, all magazines and all books,
but the university is not obliged to
provide him with all newspapers,
magazines and books. It subscribes
to The New York Times and For
eign Affairs, not to PUujboy. Any
student who wants to read that can
buy it at the local newsstand, but
anyone who argued that the princi
ple of free access to information re
quired the university library to sub
scribe to all publications would be
regarded as bereft of his senses. So

any student who wants to hear what
Dow Chemical or the CIA wants to
say could, without serious inconven
ience, visit them off-campus. Dow
Chemical, like all corporations, can
rent space in local office buildings
just as it buys space in local news
papers. The Marines and the CIA
can use the local post office to con
duct interviews. Except at a very
few colleges, so remote from civil
ization that there are neither stores
nor offices nor post offices available,
no student (and no recruiter) will
be seriously inconvenienced if uni
versities adopt the common-sense
rule of confining the use of their fa
cilities to purposes incontrovertibly
educational.
Balanced against what is mere
ly ingrained habit, or, at the
most, inconvenience to a few
students of walking a few blocks to
an office building or post office, are
two considerations of importance.
First is the principle (if it rises to
the dignity of that), that the college
should not throw open its facilities
indiscriminately to all comers—busi-

Steele Commager attacks universities for govern
ment and business recruiting on campus.

ness, religious, fraternal, political,
military—for if it did, it would find
those facilities swamped. It must
and in fact does, even now, discrim
inate. Even those who defend most
ardently the "right" of students to
interview Dow Chemical are not
prepared to provide facilities for
the Rotary, the Lions and the Ki
wanis, the Elks and the Masons and
the Woodmen of the World, the
Baptists, the Mormons anj the Je
hovah's Witnesses, and so on ad in
finitum. The only sound basis for dis
crimination is educational. The sec
ond principle is more fundamental.
When the university is called upon
to weigh the conflicting claims of
those who plead habit or conven
ience, against those who plead deep
moral convictions — moral convic
tions which are shared by a large
segment of our society and are there
fore neither eccentric nor perverse
—it should not hesitate to tip the
balance on the side of moral convic
tions. Certainly it is unworthy of the
academy to drift—or t? allow itself
to be maneuvered into —a position
where out of stubborness, out of
thoughtlessness, out of inertia, it
flouts the legitimate moral senti
ments of its students and its faculty.
To argue that some students may
entertain moral convictions about
seeing recruiters on-campus rather
than off-campus is frivolous, for is
ascribes moral significance to what
is a mere matter of personal conven
ience.
Some institutions, prepared to
concede that they are not under any
obligation to provide facilities to re
cruiting to private corporations, do
insist, or at least assert, that they
have some kind of moral obligation
to cooperate with government, es
pecially at a time of crisis and war.
Therefore, they add, even though
government has ample facilities al
ready available to it in federal, state

and local government buildings, the
university should stand ready to
lend its premises to government re
cruiters. This is a plausible argu
ment when used selectively, but not
persuasive when applied indiscrim
inately.
Time and again in the past, the
university has acknowledged an ob
ligation to cooperate with state and
national government—and keep in
mind that what we are considering
here is not any legal obligation to
obey the law, but a voluntary co
operation which is beyond the obli
gation of the law. Does it follow
from past and current practice, that
the university has an obligation to
cooperate with every branch, every
department, every bureau of gov
ernment for any and all purposes?
Such a conclusion is untenable,
and universities have already rejec
ted it. Few universities are prepared
to make available to snooping com
mittees of legislatures, or even to
the FBI, the names of members of
all student organizations. Many have
refused to provide draft boards with
records of student grades. No self
respecting university now would
cooperate with un-American activ
ities committees, state or national,
in investigating professors. Nor are
universities under obligation to lend
their facilities indiscriminately to
the enforcement of laws. The laws
of Massachusetts (and until recent
ly of Connecticut) made use of con
traceptives by anyone, single or
married, a misdemeanor; it is scarce
ly' conceivable that any univer
sity in that state, public or private,
would entertain a request from state
law enforcement agencies to help
discover and bring to justice mem
bers of faculty or student body who
violate these laws. Nor do univer
sities yield, generally, to the pica of
convenience. If students want infor
mation on taxes, they expect to go
to the local tax authorities, or per
haps to a bank; if they want infor
mation on voting they go to the
town hall; if they want to take out
a driver's license, they go to the lo
cal police. The universities are not
expected to provide these services
for the students, or even to provide
the facilities where these particular
government agencies can give out
"information."
Even when it comes to carrying
on scientific research, which is clear
ly educational in character, univer
sities do not casually or indiscrimin
ately make available their offices
and laboratories or libraries, but se
lect what is valuable to them, and
then draw up contracts which care
fully safeguard the right of the uni
versity to supervise the research,
protect scholars and avoid secrecy,
and which provide, too, for compen

sation for the use of academic facil
ities.
Does the university have the
right—the moral right, for
the legal is clearly beyond
dispute—to decide with which gov
ernmental activities it will cooper
ate? Does it have the right to say
Yes to the Peace Corps, but No to
the Marines; Yes to the Smithsonian
Institution, but No to the CIA?
Let us consider —because it is the
most controversial of them all—the
obligation of the university to the
CIA.
The readiness of the university to
lend its facilities, and its good name,
to the CIA is the most notorious ex
ample of the fix in which it finds it
self when it blindly follows the prin
ciple of the Open Door to all gov
ernment agencies. For the CIA is,
by definition, subversive of the aca
demy. Its business is subversion at
home as well as abroad, and by giv
ing it a free hand and ample money,
the Congress has endorsed this func
tion. It has, by its own admission,
subverted universities, scholars, stu
dent organizations, research, publi
cations, even churches and philan
thropic institutions. Its whole char
acter is at war with what the univer
sity stands for. It loves secrecy, but
the university flourishes only in the
light. It takes refuge in anonymity,
but the university must know the
credentials of those to whom it gives
its confidence. It is chauvinistic, but
the university is by its nature
cosmopolitan and international. It
works not to find and certainly not
to proclaim truth, but the major pur
pose of the university is to extend
the frontiers of truth.
Clearly the university is under no
obligation to collaborate with the
CIA simply because it is a govern
ment agency. This conclusion has
not only the sanction of centuries of
the history of universities; it has
legal sanction as well. For to the ar
gument that the university should
not look beyond the official creden
tials of an agency of the government
—an argument advanced with con
siderable earnestness by those who
wish to avoid the moral issue—we
must consider the counterargument
of the legal principle adopted by the
United States at the time of the Nur
emburg War Crimes trials. The offi
cial American position, submitted
by Supreme Court Justice Robert
Jackson, was quite simply that no
citizen is bound to accept as legal
and valid every act of his govern
ment, nor can he avoid responsibil
ity for his conduct by placing re
sponsibility on the government. This
position was accepted by the Tribu
nal, and under it men like Albert
Speer, Minister of Munitions, were
found guilty. It is not necessary to

".. more and more those in authority, in the acad
emy as in government, are avoiding moral issues
and taking refuge in questions of conduct or of
manners."


"Students are protesting and . . .
demonstrating against the practice
of lending the facilities of the uni
versity to recruitment of students
by corporations and the military."
trgue that the CIA is violating inter
lational law; it is enough to recog
lize the validity of the principle
hat institutions, such as universi
ies are not precluded from inquir
ng into the credentials of such
>ranches of the government as
nake demands upon them.
Whatever we may think about
he larger place of the CIA in the
cheme of national defense, we can
carcely avoid the conclusion that
t is degrading for the university to
snd its facilities, and a reputation
lainfully won over a period of 800
ears, to cooperate in its own sub
ersion. It is degrading for it to ex
end the hand of fellowship to those
v'ho are engaged in perverting its
haracter.
Even those who are prepared to
oncede in principle the right of stu
ents to oppose corporate or mili
ary recruiting on campus, deplore
he manner in which they have as
erted, or demonstrated, that right,
ilmost everywhere student demon
trations have been accompanied by
■ad manners, and in some places by
jrce and violence. Now it is very
/rong for the young to display dis
ourtesy in these situations, and
uite intolerable for them to resort
) violence, even the somewhat neg
tive violence of refusing access to
recruiting-office room. Clearly the
oung should model themselves here
n those who are older and wiser,
lodel themselves on the spokesmen
nd representatives of our nation,
n whom rests ultimate responsibil
y for the maintainance of an or
erlv society. What a pity they do
ot follow the example, in their pro
mts, of distinguished statesmen
ke Senators Russell Long and John
tennis, who think all dissenters
lould be jailed; of presidential can
idatc George Wallace who thinks
ley should be shot; or of Rep. Men
el Rivers of South Carolina who
links the proper response to flag
urning is burning the Rill of Rights,
/hat a pity they do not model them
•lves on official defenders of law
ke the police of Watts, Cleveland,
Detroit, Newark and Philadelphia,
r the US Marshalls in Washington,
ow distressing they do not con
>rm to the models of that military
ho try so hard to enlist them, "Cen
al-Romb-Them-Rack-to-the Stone

ge" Lemay, for example, or the Air
orce officers who habitually fly
/er Communist China in violation
international law. How much
iser they would be if they studied
ie conduct of the CIA whose inter
ts their deans so sedulously pro
ct, and who have never been
lown to resort to violence, and who
induct their operations in some 60
untries throughout the globe with
e nicest regard to the legal ameni
>s. How it would improve their
laracters if instead of milling

about the campus in futile demon
strations they resorted to their li
braries and read how their govern
ment eschewed violence and cham
pioned law at the time of the Bay
of Pigs invasion of Cuba, or of the
intervention by Marines in Guate
mala and Santo Domingo. How
much wiser they would be if they
studied the Kcllogg-Rriand Peace
Pact, or the Charter of the United
Nations and reflected on their own
government's faithfulness in their
commitment to these renunciations
of war. But we should remember
that students are young, and that
they have not had the training and
experience which has made their
rulers such models of moderation
and of reason.
On this whole matter of dis
courtesy and violence that
so often accompanies dem
onstrations it is relevant to recall
what the Rev. Samuel J. May—he
was uncle to the Little Women —
wrote to his friend the Rev. William
Ellery Channing about the demon
strations of abolitionists against sla

very: "You must not expect those
who have left to take up this great
cause [of abolition] that they will
plead it in all that seemliness of
phrase which the scholars . . . might
use. But the scholars and the clergy
and the statesmen had done noth
ing. We abolitionists are what we
are —babes, sucklings, obscure men,
silly women, publicans, sinners, and
we shall manage the matter we have
taken in hand just as might be ex
pected of such persons as we are. It
is unbecoming in abler men who

stood by, and would do nothing, to
complain of us because we manage
this matter no better."
To this Dr. Channing answered in
words that apply to demonstrators
against the Vietnam war as against
the abolitionists: "The great inter
ests of humanity do not lose their
claims on us because sometimes in
judiciously maintained."
Indeed they do not. Yet more and
more those in authority, in the acad
emy as in government, are avoiding
moral issues and taking refuge in
questions of conduct or of manners.
Instead of falling back on the fami
liar principle, "I disagree with what
you say but shall defend to the death
your right to say it," they substitute,
"I may agree with you, but I disap
prove profoundly of the manner in
which you say it."
What is this silence that has fallen
on the leadership of the university—
presidents, deans, boards of trustees
and regents alike? The leaders of the
religious community have spoken
out boldly enough—heads of great
theological seminaries, distin
guished theologians and clergymen.
The scientific community has taken
a strong stand on the moral issues
of the war and of nuclear weapons,
Nobel Prize winners, heads of great
scientific organizations. The rank
and file of the academic community,
teachers, scholars, students, have
seen that here are moral issues that
must be faced, and have wrestled
with them. But from Cambridge to
Berkeley, from Madison to Baton
Rouge, not a single president of a
great university has taken a public
stand on what is the greatest moral
issue of our time.
Are they silent because they are
bemused by the notion that with
their position they take a vow of
moral continence? They did not so
reason in the past —not at the time
of the two World Wars, not during
discussions of the League of Na

tions, or of communism. Is it be
cause they fear that if they spoke
out like independent men, they
would somehow "commit" their in
stitutions? If so they are mistaken
in fact and logic. No president can
commit his university, which con
sists of faculty and students, to a
moral position, or a political. No
one supposes that a senator who
speaks out somehow commits the
United States Senate, or that a judge
who speaks his mind commits the
Supreme Court, or even that a busi
ness executive can commit his cor
poration and his stockholders to po
litical positions. Why should presi
dents or deans indulge in the vanity
of supposing that they can somehow
commit great universities? Yet here
they stand numbed by timidity, tak
ing refuge from the obligation to
confront great moral questions by
escaping into the easy activity of ap
plying petty disciplinary measures
to students who embarrass them.
If presidents, deans, trustees and
regents are unwilling or unable to
protect and exalt the dignity of the
university, they should be grateful
to students who have remembered
it and exalted it. If universities have
refused to face the major moral is
sues of our day they should rejoice
that they have, somehow, helped to
produce students who are neither
paralyzed nor timid, who are sensi
tive to moral issues and prepared to
respond to them, however convul
sively.
On this matter of recruitment, as
on the larger issues of the relation
of the academy to the moral prob
lems which glare upon us from every
quarter of the horizon, this genera
tion of university presidents, so re
spectable, so cautious, may yet hear
from their own students that im
mortal taunt of Henry IV: "Go
hang yourself, brave Crillon; we
fought at Arques and you were not
there."

he readiness of the university to lend its facilities and
good name, to the CIA is the most notorious exam
e of the fix in which it finds itself when it blindly
llows the policy of the Open Door to all government
encies."
