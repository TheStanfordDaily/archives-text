From Harvard Yard to Madison
and Berkeley, students are
taking into their own hands
and hearts, what university admin
istrators have failed to take into
their hands or their minds: the prob
lem of the obligation of the univer
sity to private corporations and to
government. Students are protest
ing and, where protests are ineffec
tive, demonstrating against the prac
tice of lending the facilities of the
university to recruitment of stu
dents by corporations and the mili
tary. Sometimes their protest takes
the form of forcibly banning recruit
ers from university facilities, thus
exposing them to the wrath of deans
and presidents who, unwilling to
face the central issue of on-campus
recruitment, embrace with enthusi
asm the marginal issue of bad man
ers.
For the explosion of this contro
versy on campus, the university au
thorities have only themselves to
blame for not formulating any pol
icy which could stand the test of
logical scrutiny. Most of them are
still sullenly taking refuge in pre
cedent, or involving irrelevant argu
ments of "freedom of information."
Student demonstrations against re
cruitment are, then, a monument to
the absence of foresight and of
imagination in university adminis
trators, and an excess of imagination
in students. All who are concerned
with the academic enterprise will
agree that an excess of imagination
and of moral passion in the young
is to be preferred to the absense of
either in their elders.
The basic principle which should
govern the relations of the univer
sity to recruiters is that which
should govern all other activities of
the academy. The university is not
an employment agency; it is not an
adjunct of corporations; it is not an
instrument of government. Wher
ever feasible the university should
make available its facilities to legiti
mate educational enterprises. It is
under no obligation whatsoever to
make its facilities available to what
is not educational.
Guided by this simple principle
the university can deal with the
awkward problem of recruiting
with reasonable consistency and
fairness. There are and will be ex
ceptions — and borderline cases
as Supreme Court opinions testify
daily — exceptions and borderline
cases in the interpretation of the

Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
So far, however, none of these bor
derline cases has caused any diffi
culties. Students have not protested
against recruitment by the Peace
Corps, or Head Start, or the United
Nations, and it is unlikely that they
will. The organizations whose re
cruiting has precipitated the crisis
throughout the academic world are
not borderline cases. By no stretch
of the imagination can it be alleged
that Dow Chemical Company, the
Marines or the CIA are educational
enterprises, or that they contribute
to the educational enterprise. Dow
Chemical is a business corporation;
its business is to make money, and
it recruits students at universities
because that is one of the ways it
hopes to make money. No univer
sity is under any obligation what
ever to help Dow Chemical make
money. The Marines and the Navy,
admirable as they no doubt are, are
not educational enterprises. Their
business is to fight. The university
is an interested party in this enter
prise, just as it is an interested party
in tax collecting or in the maintain
ance of law and order, but it is under

no more obligation to lend its facil
ities to the Marines and the Navy
than it is to lend them to the Depart
ment of the Treasury or the Depart
ment of Justice.
But, it is asserted, every student
has a right to hear what these : and
other, organizations have to say. So
they have, and a university which
sought to deny them this right
would be derelict in its duty to its
students, and to its own character.
The argument is, however, wholly
irrelevant to the situation which
confronts us. Every student has a
right to a great many things that the
university is not obliged to provide.
He has a right to read all newspa
pers, all magazines and all books,
but the university is not obliged to
provide him with all newspapers,
magazines and books. It subscribes
to The New York Times and For
eign Affairs, not to PUujboy. Any
student who wants to read that can
buy it at the local newsstand, but
anyone who argued that the princi
ple of free access to information re
quired the university library to sub
scribe to all publications would be
regarded as bereft of his senses. So

any student who wants to hear what
Dow Chemical or the CIA wants to
say could, without serious inconven
ience, visit them off-campus. Dow
Chemical, like all corporations, can
rent space in local office buildings
just as it buys space in local news
papers. The Marines and the CIA
can use the local post office to con
duct interviews. Except at a very
few colleges, so remote from civil
ization that there are neither stores
nor offices nor post offices available,
no student (and no recruiter) will
be seriously inconvenienced if uni
versities adopt the common-sense
rule of confining the use of their fa
cilities to purposes incontrovertibly
educational.
Balanced against what is mere
ly ingrained habit, or, at the
most, inconvenience to a few
students of walking a few blocks to
an office building or post office, are
two considerations of importance.
First is the principle (if it rises to
the dignity of that), that the college
should not throw open its facilities
indiscriminately to all comers—busi-
