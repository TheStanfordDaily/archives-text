# The 						Naked Ape'--man's true geneology?
## 
### jeremy baker 
EVERYTHING we do is so rational as far
as our work is concerned; it's all mathe
matical and logical. The danger is that
we may begin to feel that this is the only mode
of action that people have. Since we are de
scended from apes, maybe we still retain some
ape-like characteristics, which might show
through in our natures, despite our civilized
overlay.
To test this idea, Dr. Desmond Morris, a
London zoologist, has examined human beings
as if he were examining yet another type of
ape. Right on the first page, Dr. Morris puts
this question to you: in what two major dimen
sions do you differ from an ape? The answer is
that your brain is bigger and your penis longer.
This second characteristic is at least as impor
tant as the first, yet we persist in discussing
human behavior as though it were continually
guided by our giant brains. If we ignore one
of the major parts of our make-up, then we will
be unlikely to accurately predict how groups
of human beings are going to behave.
Much of the first part of the book is taken up
with a description of the naked-ape's sexual ac
tivity. Perhaps the most useful result of reading
this is to find out that much of your behavior
is programmed by the events that have im
pinged on generations of apes.
When you have read this book, many of the
strange, quirky, unfunctional things that we
do will suddenly appear to have an explana
tion. Blushing? A signal of sexual interest.
Lips? Visual signaling devices, to accentuate
sexual imprinting, so that the pair-bond is
made more permanent. Why a pair-bond? Be
cause our life-cycle is so long that we need the
help of a partner for years and years. Here Dr.
Morris is showing that the need for a perma
nent partner is encouraged by countless of our
physiological characteristics; though there may
be new administrative reasons why the pair
bond can be lightly discarded, these are trivial
compared with the basic needs which cannot
be changed for generations.
Since we have a greater pair-bond than any
other ape, we are at the same time prevented
from developing elaborate relationships with
other naked-apes. There are considerable inhi
bitions that prevent us from "getting involved."
Even the act of touching is hedged around

with cultural difficulties. If we hump into some
one, then we apologize. It is as if the only way
we can control this force within us is to com
pletely hide it.
The increase in overcrowding that we have
experienced in the last couple of centuries has
led to a vast increase in the opportunity for
touch, but we have responded by forbidding
tactile sensations to a degree that would seem
strange to more primitive communities. Prof.
Sidney Jourard of Florida University has
termed this process "out of touch, the body
taboo," and he has charted the few ways we
have remaining to achieve this necessary com
munication.
In the main, of course, we just miss out on
this medium, but this docs not mean that the
basic force can be forgotten. To Dr. Morris, it
is clear that it emerges in the vast array of
voyeurism that is all around us. Our touch
needs are satisfied partially by seeing endless
tactile - oriented advertisements, and by em
ploying film-actors to work out our touch fan
tasies.
What others have seen as an unhealthy em
phasis on sex in mass-media is in fact a very
necessary form of voyeurism. Without this,
there would be sexual anarchy on a scale that
would upset all our institutions. This is a strik
ing example of the way in which the conven
tional wisdom condemns the very forces that
are holding together the society.
An interesting experiment might be per
formed, if you could find a society that had a
minuscule proportion of females compared
with male adults (like Stanford?). In order to
reduce the aggressiveness that is inherent in
such a situation, the female indulges in a lim
ited degree of sexual signaling. In monkeys,
this is known as remotivating, and has nothing
to do with actual sexual needs. Should anyone
be so uninitiated as to interpret it as a literal
invitation, he would come up against the for
midable no-touch barrier. The females in this
predominantly male society would therefore be
highly attractive in the verbal and visual sig
nals they give out, but they would also glide
through the community separated by a perma
nent well-defined air space.
Bob Dylan's latest hit is called "I'll Be Your
Baby Tonight," and what Dylan is describing
here (presumably unconsciously) is the re
gressive pattern that develops at certain stages
of our life. This happens particularly during
the courting phase, but one of the large dis

tinctions between us and other apes is the way
we retain other juvenile characteristics into
adult life. In evolutionary terms, this is appar
ently known as neoteny, and is shown by our
youthful curiosity, which extends throughout
our lives. Dr. Morris sees us always trying to
balance our need for novelty (neophilia), and
our need for calm and order (neophobia).
In our organizational lives, the need for dom
inant figures and a hierarchy is taken back to
the grouping of monkeys and apes. Although
the purest form of hierarchical relationship has
faded away, as we need more and more co
operation, we still can't stop ourselves from
looking up to some leader figure. Dr. Morris
considers this to be the only explanation for
the continuation of religion, which otherwise
leaves him amazed and incredulous. When we
are put in a situation in which there is no clear
hierarchy, our instinct is to search for oneâ€”"we
would need to invent Him."
Coupled with the need for dominance is the
necessity for pomp and circumstance. If we try
to arrange a situation where this does not take
place, then we are likely to fail. Europeans are
always told how Americans have no need for
all this ridiculous pageantry which is such a
feature of Italian or Spanish life. But when
they come over here, they see that Americans
have more ceremonies, more titles, more signs
of place in the hierarchy than any other com
munity.
It is always comforting when an author puts
forward a theory which attempts to cover all
our activities, so that every human event can
be neatly slotted into his pigeon-holes. But
this is so difficult that huge areas have to be
virtually ignored. The development of a verbal
culture has affected our relationships in a way
that the book cannot explain. As Claude Levi-
Strauss suggested, "The primary function of
writing, as a means of communication, is to fa
cilitate the enslavement of other human be
ings." If there is any truth in this, it would be
ridiculous to suggest that ape-ness alone could
explain our actions.
Theories about ourselves seem to lurch from
the very rational (e.g., economic man, "norms
of rationality," the architecture of Mies van der
Rohe, etc.) to the very basic and primitive
(e.g., the current popularity of zoologists such
as Lorenz, Jane Goodall, Ardrey, etc.; and the
architecture of Le Corbusier). The danger in
an academic community is surely that we are
liable to lean too far in the direction of logical
explanations. To put it architecturally, Amer
ica has cities full of Miesian graph-paper office
blocks, and hardly any curving free-form Sor
busier-derived sculptural buildings that actu
ally look human.

strange to more primitive communities. Prof.
Sidney Jourard of Florida University has
termed this process "out of touch, the body
taboo," and he has charted the few ways we
have remaining to achieve this necessary com
munication.
In the main, of course, we just miss out on
this medium, but this docs not mean that the
basic force can be forgotten. To Dr. Morris, it
is clear that it emerges in the vast array of
voyeurism that is all around us. Our touch
needs are satisfied partially by seeing endless
tactile - oriented advertisements, and by em
ploying film-actors to work out our touch fan
tasies.
What others have seen as an unhealthy em
phasis on sex in mass-media is in fact a very
necessary form of voyeurism. Without this,
there would be sexual anarchy on a scale that
would upset all our institutions. This is a strik
ing example of the way in which the conven
tional wisdom condemns the very forces that
are holding together the society.
An interesting experiment might be per
formed, if you could find a society that had a
minuscule proportion of females compared
with male adults (like Stanford?). In order to
reduce the aggressiveness that is inherent in
such a situation, the female indulges in a lim
ited degree of sexual signaling. In monkeys,
this is known as remotivating, and has nothing
to do with actual sexual needs. Should anyone
be so uninitiated as to interpret it as a literal
invitation, he would come up against the for
midable no-touch barrier. The females in this
predominantly male society would therefore be
highly attractive in the verbal and visual sig
nals they give out, but they would also glide
through the community separated by a perma
nent well-defined air space.
Bob Dylan's latest hit is called "I'll Be Your
Baby Tonight," and what Dylan is describing
here (presumably unconsciously) is the re
gressive pattern that develops at certain stages
of our life. This happens particularly during
the courting phase, but one of the large dis

tinctions between us and other apes is the way
we retain other juvenile characteristics into
adult life. In evolutionary terms, this is appar
ently known as neoteny, and is shown by our
youthful curiosity, which extends throughout
our lives. Dr. Morris sees us always trying to
balance our need for novelty (neophilia), and
our need for calm and order (neophobia).
In our organizational lives, the need for dom
inant figures and a hierarchy is taken back to
the grouping of monkeys and apes. Although
the purest form of hierarchical relationship has
faded away, as we need more and more co
operation, we still can't stop ourselves from
looking up to some leader figure. Dr. Morris
considers this to be the only explanation for
the continuation of religion, which otherwise
leaves him amazed and incredulous. When we
are put in a situation in which there is no clear
hierarchy, our instinct is to search for oneâ€”"we
would need to invent Him."
Coupled with the need for dominance is the
necessity for pomp and circumstance. If we try
to arrange a situation where this does not take
place, then we are likely to fail. Europeans are
always told how Americans have no need for
all this ridiculous pageantry which is such a
feature of Italian or Spanish life. But when
they come over here, they see that Americans
have more ceremonies, more titles, more signs
of place in the hierarchy than any other com
munity.
It is always comforting when an author puts
forward a theory which attempts to cover all
our activities, so that every human event can
be neatly slotted into his pigeon-holes. But
this is so difficult that huge areas have to be
virtually ignored. The development of a verbal
culture has affected our relationships in a way
that the book cannot explain. As Claude Levi-
Strauss suggested, "The primary function of
writing, as a means of communication, is to fa
cilitate the enslavement of other human be
ings." If there is any truth in this, it would be
ridiculous to suggest that ape-ness alone could
explain our actions.
Theories about ourselves seem to lurch from
the very rational (e.g., economic man, "norms
of rationality," the architecture of Mies van der
Rohe, etc.) to the very basic and primitive
(e.g., the current popularity of zoologists such
as Lorenz, Jane Goodall, Ardrey, etc.; and the
architecture of Le Corbusier). The danger in
an academic community is surely that we are
liable to lean too far in the direction of logical
explanations. To put it architecturally, Amer
ica has cities full of Miesian graph-paper office
blocks, and hardly any curving free-form Sor
busier-derived sculptural buildings that actu
ally look human.


The Naked Ape by Dr. Desmond Morris: Mc-
Graw Hill, $5.95.

EVERYTHING we do is so rational as far
as our work is concerned; it's all mathe
matical and logical. The danger is that
we may begin to feel that this is the only mode
of action that people have. Since we are de
scended from apes, maybe we still retain some
ape-like characteristics, which might show
through in our natures, despite our civilized
overlay.
To test this idea, Dr. Desmond Morris, a
London zoologist, has examined human beings
as if he were examining yet another type of
ape. Right on the first page, Dr. Morris puts
this question to you: in what two major dimen
sions do you differ from an ape? The answer is
that your brain is bigger and your penis longer.
This second characteristic is at least as impor
tant as the first, yet we persist in discussing
human behavior as though it were continually
guided by our giant brains. If we ignore one
of the major parts of our make-up, then we will
be unlikely to accurately predict how groups
of human beings are going to behave.
Much of the first part of the book is taken up
with a description of the naked-ape's sexual ac
tivity. Perhaps the most useful result of reading
this is to find out that much of your behavior
is programmed by the events that have im
pinged on generations of apes.
When you have read this book, many of the
strange, quirky, unfunctional things that we
do will suddenly appear to have an explana
tion. Blushing? A signal of sexual interest.
Lips? Visual signaling devices, to accentuate
sexual imprinting, so that the pair-bond is
made more permanent. Why a pair-bond? Be
cause our life-cycle is so long that we need the
help of a partner for years and years. Here Dr.
Morris is showing that the need for a perma
nent partner is encouraged by countless of our
physiological characteristics; though there may
be new administrative reasons why the pair
bond can be lightly discarded, these are trivial
compared with the basic needs which cannot
be changed for generations.
Since we have a greater pair-bond than any
other ape, we are at the same time prevented
from developing elaborate relationships with
other naked-apes. There are considerable inhi
bitions that prevent us from "getting involved."
Even the act of touching is hedged around

with cultural difficulties. If we hump into some
one, then we apologize. It is as if the only way
we can control this force within us is to com
pletely hide it.
The increase in overcrowding that we have
experienced in the last couple of centuries has
led to a vast increase in the opportunity for
touch, but we have responded by forbidding
tactile sensations to a degree that would seem
strange to more primitive communities. Prof.
Sidney Jourard of Florida University has

considers this to be the only explanation for
the continuation of religion, which otherwise
leaves him amazed and incredulous. When we
are put in a situation in which there is no clear
hierarchy, our instinct is to search for oneâ€”"we
would need to invent Him."
Coupled with the need for dominance is the
necessity for pomp and circumstance. If we try
to arrange a situation where this does not take
place, then we are likely to fail. Europeans are
always told how Americans have no need for
all this ridiculous pageantry which is such a
feature of Italian or Spanish life. But when
they come over here, they see that Americans
have more ceremonies, more titles, more signs
of place in the hierarchy than any other com
munity.
It is always comforting when an author puts
forward a theory which attempts to cover all
our activities, so that every human event can
be neatly slotted into his pigeon-holes. But
this is so difficult that huge areas have to be
virtually ignored. The development of a verbal
culture has affected our relationships in a way
that the book cannot explain. As Claude Levi-
Strauss suggested, "The primary function of
writing, as a means of communication, is to fa
cilitate the enslavement of other human be
ings." If there is any truth in this, it would be
ridiculous to suggest that ape-ness alone could
explain our actions.
Theories about ourselves seem to lurch from
the very rational (e.g., economic man, "norms
of rationality," the architecture of Mies van der
Rohe, etc.) to the very basic and primitive
(e.g., the current popularity of zoologists such
as Lorenz, Jane Goodall, Ardrey, etc.; and the
architecture of Le Corbusier). The danger in
an academic community is surely that we are
liable to lean too far in the direction of logical
explanations. To put it architecturally, Amer
ica has cities full of Miesian graph-paper office
blocks, and hardly any curving free-form Sor
busier-derived sculptural buildings that actu
ally look human.


The Naked Ape by Dr. Desmond Morris: Mc-
Graw Hill, $5.95.

EVERYTHING we do is so rational as far
as our work is concerned; it's all mathe
matical and logical. The danger is that
we may begin to feel that this is the only mode
of action that people have. Since we are de
scended from apes, maybe we still retain some
ape-like characteristics, which might show
through in our natures, despite our civilized
overlay.
To test this idea, Dr. Desmond Morris, a
London zoologist, has examined human beings
as if he were examining yet another type of
ape. Right on the first page, Dr. Morris puts
this question to you: in what two major dimen
sions do you differ from an ape? The answer is
that your brain is bigger and your penis longer.
This second characteristic is at least as impor
tant as the first, yet we persist in discussing
human behavior as though it were continually
guided by our giant brains. If we ignore one
of the major parts of our make-up, then we will
be unlikely to accurately predict how groups
of human beings are going to behave.
Much of the first part of the book is taken up
with a description of the naked-ape's sexual ac
tivity. Perhaps the most useful result of reading
this is to find out that much of your behavior
is programmed by the events that have im
pinged on generations of apes.
When you have read this book, many of the
strange, quirky, unfunctional things that we
do will suddenly appear to have an explana
tion. Blushing? A signal of sexual interest.
Lips? Visual signaling devices, to accentuate
sexual imprinting, so that the pair-bond is
made more permanent. Why a pair-bond? Be
cause our life-cycle is so long that we need the
help of a partner for years and years. Here Dr.
Morris is showing that the need for a perma
nent partner is encouraged by countless of our
physiological characteristics; though there may
be new administrative reasons why the pair
bond can be lightly discarded, these are trivial
compared with the basic needs which cannot
be changed for generations.
Since we have a greater pair-bond than any
other ape, we are at the same time prevented
from developing elaborate relationships with
other naked-apes. There are considerable inhi
bitions that prevent us from "getting involved."
Even the act of touching is hedged around

with cultural difficulties. If we hump into some
one, then we apologize. It is as if the only way
we can control this force within us is to com
pletely hide it.
The increase in overcrowding that we have
experienced in the last couple of centuries has
led to a vast increase in the opportunity for
touch, but we have responded by forbidding
tactile sensations to a degree that would seem
strange to more primitive communities. Prof.
Sidney Jourard of Florida University has
termed this process "out of touch, the body
taboo," and he has charted the few ways we
have remaining to achieve this necessary com
munication.
In the main, of course, we just miss out on
this medium, but this docs not mean that the
basic force can be forgotten. To Dr. Morris, it
is clear that it emerges in the vast array of
voyeurism that is all around us. Our touch
needs are satisfied partially by seeing endless
tactile - oriented advertisements, and by em
ploying film-actors to work out our touch fan
tasies.
What others have seen as an unhealthy em
phasis on sex in mass-media is in fact a very
necessary form of voyeurism. Without this,
there would be sexual anarchy on a scale that
would upset all our institutions. This is a strik
ing example of the way in which the conven
tional wisdom condemns the very forces that
are holding together the society.
An interesting experiment might be per
formed, if you could find a society that had a
minuscule proportion of females compared
with male adults (like Stanford?). In order to
reduce the aggressiveness that is inherent in
such a situation, the female indulges in a lim
ited degree of sexual signaling. In monkeys,
this is known as remotivating, and has nothing
to do with actual sexual needs. Should anyone
be so uninitiated as to interpret it as a literal
invitation, he would come up against the for
midable no-touch barrier. The females in this
predominantly male society would therefore be
highly attractive in the verbal and visual sig
nals they give out, but they would also glide
through the community separated by a perma
nent well-defined air space.
Bob Dylan's latest hit is called "I'll Be Your
Baby Tonight," and what Dylan is describing
here (presumably unconsciously) is the re
gressive pattern that develops at certain stages
of our life. This happens particularly during
the courting phase, but one of the large dis

tinctions between us and other apes is the way
we retain other juvenile characteristics into
adult life. In evolutionary terms, this is appar
ently known as neoteny, and is shown by our
youthful curiosity, which extends throughout
our lives. Dr. Morris sees us always trying to
balance our need for novelty (neophilia), and
our need for calm and order (neophobia).
In our organizational lives, the need for dom
inant figures and a hierarchy is taken back to
the grouping of monkeys and apes. Although
the purest form of hierarchical relationship has
faded away, as we need more and more co
operation, we still can't stop ourselves from
looking up to some leader figure. Dr. Morris
considers this to be the only explanation for
the continuation of religion, which otherwise
leaves him amazed and incredulous. When we
are put in a situation in which there is no clear

this question to you: in what two major dimen
sions do you differ from an ape? The answer is
that your brain is bigger and your penis longer.
This second characteristic is at least as impor
tant as the first, yet we persist in discussing
human behavior as though it were continually
guided by our giant brains. If we ignore one
of the major parts of our make-up, then we will
be unlikely to accurately predict how groups
of human beings are going to behave.
Much of the first part of the book is taken up
with a description of the naked-ape's sexual ac
tivity. Perhaps the most useful result of reading
this is to find out that much of your behavior
is programmed by the events that have im
pinged on generations of apes.
When you have read this book, many of the
strange, quirky, unfunctional things that we
do will suddenly appear to have an explana
tion. Blushing? A signal of sexual interest.
Lips? Visual signaling devices, to accentuate
sexual imprinting, so that the pair-bond is
made more permanent. Why a pair-bond? Be
cause our life-cycle is so long that we need the
help of a partner for years and years. Here Dr.
Morris is showing that the need for a perma
nent partner is encouraged by countless of our
physiological characteristics; though there may
be new administrative reasons why the pair
bond can be lightly discarded, these are trivial
compared with the basic needs which cannot
be changed for generations.
Since we have a greater pair-bond than any
other ape, we are at the same time prevented
from developing elaborate relationships with
other naked-apes. There are considerable inhi
bitions that prevent us from "getting involved."
Even the act of touching is hedged around

with cultural difficulties. If we hump into some
one, then we apologize. It is as if the only way
we can control this force within us is to com
pletely hide it.
The increase in overcrowding that we have
experienced in the last couple of centuries has
led to a vast increase in the opportunity for
touch, but we have responded by forbidding
tactile sensations to a degree that would seem
strange to more primitive communities. Prof.
Sidney Jourard of Florida University has
termed this process "out of touch, the body
taboo," and he has charted the few ways we
have remaining to achieve this necessary com
munication.
In the main, of course, we just miss out on
this medium, but this docs not mean that the
basic force can be forgotten. To Dr. Morris, it
is clear that it emerges in the vast array of
voyeurism that is all around us. Our touch
needs are satisfied partially by seeing endless
tactile - oriented advertisements, and by em
ploying film-actors to work out our touch fan
tasies.
What others have seen as an unhealthy em
phasis on sex in mass-media is in fact a very
necessary form of voyeurism. Without this,
there would be sexual anarchy on a scale that
would upset all our institutions. This is a strik
ing example of the way in which the conven
tional wisdom condemns the very forces that
are holding together the society.
An interesting experiment might be per
formed, if you could find a society that had a
minuscule proportion of females compared
with male adults (like Stanford?). In order to
reduce the aggressiveness that is inherent in
such a situation, the female indulges in a lim
ited degree of sexual signaling. In monkeys,
this is known as remotivating, and has nothing
to do with actual sexual needs. Should anyone
be so uninitiated as to interpret it as a literal
invitation, he would come up against the for
midable no-touch barrier. The females in this
predominantly male society would therefore be
highly attractive in the verbal and visual sig
nals they give out, but they would also glide
through the community separated by a perma
nent well-defined air space.
Bob Dylan's latest hit is called "I'll Be Your
Baby Tonight," and what Dylan is describing
here (presumably unconsciously) is the re
gressive pattern that develops at certain stages
of our life. This happens particularly during
the courting phase, but one of the large dis

tinctions between us and other apes is the way
we retain other juvenile characteristics into
adult life. In evolutionary terms, this is appar
ently known as neoteny, and is shown by our
youthful curiosity, which extends throughout
our lives. Dr. Morris sees us always trying to
balance our need for novelty (neophilia), and
our need for calm and order (neophobia).
In our organizational lives, the need for dom
inant figures and a hierarchy is taken back to
the grouping of monkeys and apes. Although
the purest form of hierarchical relationship has
faded away, as we need more and more co
operation, we still can't stop ourselves from
looking up to some leader figure. Dr. Morris
considers this to be the only explanation for
the continuation of religion, which otherwise
leaves him amazed and incredulous. When we
are put in a situation in which there is no clear
hierarchy, our instinct is to search for oneâ€”"we
would need to invent Him."
Coupled with the need for dominance is the
necessity for pomp and circumstance. If we try
to arrange a situation where this does not take
place, then we are likely to fail. Europeans are
always told how Americans have no need for
all this ridiculous pageantry which is such a
feature of Italian or Spanish life. But when
they come over here, they see that Americans
have more ceremonies, more titles, more signs
of place in the hierarchy than any other com
munity.
It is always comforting when an author puts
forward a theory which attempts to cover all
our activities, so that every human event can
be neatly slotted into his pigeon-holes. But
this is so difficult that huge areas have to be
virtually ignored. The development of a verbal
culture has affected our relationships in a way
that the book cannot explain. As Claude Levi-
Strauss suggested, "The primary function of
writing, as a means of communication, is to fa
cilitate the enslavement of other human be
ings." If there is any truth in this, it would be
ridiculous to suggest that ape-ness alone could
explain our actions.
Theories about ourselves seem to lurch from
the very rational (e.g., economic man, "norms
of rationality," the architecture of Mies van der
Rohe, etc.) to the very basic and primitive
(e.g., the current popularity of zoologists such
as Lorenz, Jane Goodall, Ardrey, etc.; and the
architecture of Le Corbusier). The danger in
an academic community is surely that we are
liable to lean too far in the direction of logical
explanations. To put it architecturally, Amer
ica has cities full of Miesian graph-paper office
blocks, and hardly any curving free-form Sor
busier-derived sculptural buildings that actu
ally look human.

EVERYTHING we do is so rational as far
as our work is concerned; it's all mathe
matical and logical. The danger is that
we may begin to feel that this is the only mode
of action that people have. Since we are de
scended from apes, maybe we still retain some
ape-like characteristics, which might show
through in our natures, despite our civilized
overlay.
To test this idea, Dr. Desmond Morris, a
London zoologist, has examined human beings
as if he were examining yet another type of
ape. Right on the first page, Dr. Morris puts
this question to you: in what two major dimen
sions do you differ from an ape? The answer is
that your brain is bigger and your penis longer.
