# Cock-a-Doodle Dandy—
## The 						masterpiece of an unconventional playwright 
### gordon m. wickstrom 
The Stanford Repertory Theatre opened
its most lavish production of this season
Wednesday night in Memorial Audito
rium. Sean O'Casey Cock-a-Doodle Dandy, a
fantasic comedy of modern Ireland, employs
just about every dramatic device and style to
tell its tale of eternal warfare between the dirty
old men who fear and hate life for its sensual
joy and beauty and those other special souls, in
this play the young women, who crave a richer
life of love and fulfilment.
Into the small Irish village of O'Casey's imag
ination comes a gigantic Cock Rooster to turn
everything topsy-turvy in its attempt to frus
trate the old nay-sayers and to champion the
lovely, oppressed girls.
The play overflows with vitality drawn from
a myriad of dramatic sources and techniques.
It plays freely with the emotions, refusing to
cater to the conventions of dramatic structure
that were accepted as imperative when the
play was written in 1949. For these reasons
Cock-a-Doodle Dandy, like the other late
O'Casey plays, has had difficult sledding both
among critics and on the producing stage. We
simply have not known what to do with these
wild pieces, and our frustration often blinded
us to their excitement and beauty.
Some have claimed that these late plays are,
in fact, unproducible. No metaphor could be
found ready at hand to unite all the elements
slammed together in the text. At least not until
now with, as the SRT production directed by

Charles Olsen and designed by Richard Hay
shows, the more unstructured approach to tra
ditional concepts of form. These lessons are
learned from Hippie relaxation, the exaltation
of the Beatles and the best of their followers,
the graphic imagery of the halucinagenic ex
perience capable of uniting all contradictions,
and the revival of art nouveau and its vision of
life as flow rather than mechanical congruity.
They constitute a way of grasping and produc
ing these plays.
The current idiom—being "turned on" is in
itself an O'Casey ideal. "Turn on" these plays
and see what happens! They immediately be
come a joyful, hilarious celebration of friend
ship, sex, family, the natural world. The experi
ence is profoundly pagan and Dionysiac, but
the meaning is one of essential non-institution
al, unstructured christian affirmation.
Not all of O'Casey's plays are like Cock-a-
Doodle Dandy. He began to break out of Ms
early more naturalistic mode, based on his con
cern with slum life in Dublin, in 1928 with his
The Silver Tassie, a play that was a bitter turn
ing point in his life. This play about the devas
tating effects of war on the individual has a
second act vastly different from anything the
Irish theatre of that day had known. A scene of
expressionistic, ritual chant by soldiers in the
trenches baffled or distressed the directors of
The Abbey Theatre in Dublin.
O'Casey, who had literally saved the Abbey
during the dark days of 1922 when he brought
his Shadow of a Gunman, Juno and the Pay
cock, and The Plough and the Stars to the
struggling company, sent The Tassie from his

home in England to Dublin for production. But
William Butler Yeats, the presiding genius of
the Irish dramatic movement, disliked the play,
got that other giant of the movement Lady
Gregory to agree with him, and sent The Tassie
back to O'Casey as unacceptable. O'Casey was
infuriated, made his exile in England perma
nent and proceeded to write the new kind of
plays that reached their zenith in Cock-a-Doo
dle Dandy.
Among them were Within the Gates, Purple
Dust, Red Roses for Me, The Bishop's Bonfire,
and his last play The Drums of Father Ned.
O'Casey used these plays to do battle against
his sworn enemies: bourgeois economics, sex
ual repression, institutional religion, rabid pa
triotism, anything that narrowed and depressed
the individual's sense of joy and love in life.
He preached a natural reverence for life, a
rather non-dogmatic communism, the undoubt
ed glory of the feminine to be enjoyed and cul
tivated in the spirit and in the flesh. About
everything he demonstrated an exuberance and
vigor that made his old age (these plays all
came between his fifty-fourth and eighty-sec
ond years) seem like the epitome of youth.
O'Casey died at Torquay in England in 1964
at the age of 84, never completely reconciled to
Ireland or its national theatre at the Abbey.
It is a paradox that O'Casey's unhappy break
with Ireland and the Abbey in a sense contrib
uted to that momentum that was to make what
had begun as an isolated, parochial artistic
movement in a terribly parochial land into an
international dramatic force second only in its
time to the Moscow Art Theatre in Russia.


Two Irish cronies, Sailor Mahan (left, Paul Rich
ards) and Michael Marthraum (Gerald Iliken),
momentarily forget their whisky as the deplore
the morals of the younger generation in this
scene from Cock-a-Doodle Dandy. This S.R.T.
production will play through March 16 with per
formances at 8 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
