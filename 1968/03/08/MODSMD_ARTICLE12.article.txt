# On stage at A.C.T.
## Kilty's 'Mable' should be shot 
### 
For the first time, ACT has opened a new
play, Don't Shoot Mable It's Your Husband by
Jerome Kilty, a director in residence with the
company. The occasion is no cause for celebra
tion.
Mable is a Richard Lesterish pastiche which
attempts to employ cinematic techniques in
satirizing, among other things, films and those
who make them. It finally emerges, however,
as an example of the sort of bad play which
indicates only too clearly why patrons prefer
movies to the stage.
The play deals with a 25-year segment of the
lives of a Hollywood director, C. B. (get it?)
Pojansky (get it?), his wife, their movie star
daughter Marilyn (get it?), and movie star son
Tony (get it?). The objects of Kilty's satire
(the RAF flyer, the trial scene, the dance con
test, Reagan, fags) are so threadbare that I ini
tially thought he was satirizing satire; but no
such luck.
Mable has a "really with it" veneer, but the
characters end up with their faces covered with
whipped cream, just as in any other third-rate
comedy.
