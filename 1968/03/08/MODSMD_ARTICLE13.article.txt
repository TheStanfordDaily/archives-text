# The
						poet Frost as Santa Claus
## 
### 
An Evening's Frost is a classic example of
the species that author-critic Penelope Cilliatt
has called "have breakfast with a genius" plays.
Non-artists, it seems, are disposed to cast
artists in one of two extreme roles—magicians
or "just folks" yokel. Few artists are as vulner
able to being placed in the latter category- as
is Robert Frost. If An Evening's Frost is any
index, playwright Donald Flail is certainly a
non-artist, and his "play" is a portrait of the
artist as a genial yokel which is on the percep
tual level of Time and Life.
(1 am reluctant to call the piece a play, since
it is really another of the small cast, sparse set
non-plays which are becoming annoyingly fre
quent in ACT's repertory.)
What Hall does is tell us a story about Frost
via an assemblage of the poet's prose and po
etry. Because Frost's poems have a strong story
element and because many of them are written
as dialogues, they lend themselves rather read
ily to dramatic presentation. To use them pri
marily to tell us about the poet himself is, I
think, restrictive. But the real failure of Hall's
method is demonstrated by the fact that ulti
mately he does not tell us much more about
Frost than a one-page biography does.
Even after Frost was successful, we are told,
he still questioned things, was still lonely. Some
distinction! What is it that makes the poet dif
ferent, special? Hall never really raises the
epiestion, never really tells us anything of con
sequence about poem-making. His Frost is an
undistinguished, affable old coot.
Good poetry embodies a freshness and clar
ity of vision which potentially threatens the
placidity of the status quo; hence, as Plato
knew, good poets are dangerous. Hall's Frost
is a coffee table objet d'art, a threat to virtually
nothing.
Frost is staged like a significant Television

Presentation, with, in addition to Frost, a sol
emnly intoning narrator who occasionally
speaks the parts of various characters, and a
man and woman who each take several parts.
In the ACT production, the part of Frost is
taken by guest actor Will Geer whose clipped
readings of numerous poems are interesting
and enjoyable. He is somewhat lacking in va
riety, but then, I guess, the poems are too.
Dee Ann Nlears and Peter Donat are useful
in rendering some of the dialogue poems. Her
readings are generally too sugared, but she is
very good in the ominously lighted "Witch of
Coos." His stage English is glaringly out of
place in his rendering of farmer characters.
All in all, it's good to hear many of these
poems read, if you can endure the cuteness,
sententiousness, and cloying optimism of Hall's
interruptions and overview.
A performance has reportedly been sched
uled in Dinkelspiel for next quarter.
