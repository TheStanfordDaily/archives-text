# Reflections on Long Day's Journey

### 
The story of people caring for each other and
causing themselves nothing but pain and an
guish is very familiar, but it is no less tragic
for being commonplace.
Usually sparked by the eccentricity of one,
the intricate web of mutual torture first knits
its strands around a seemingly trivial issue
which soon assumes frightfully gigantic pro
portions. Gradually, with the people's inability
or unwillingness to untwine the absurd en
tanglement, the entire muddled situation gets
completely out of control, achieving its own
devastating organic potentiality. Thereafter,
there is nothing they can do except propagate
the torture until they are ruined or jolted by
sudden shock.
And yet, behind all this mutual self-torture
lies a deep basic love. Often this paradoxical
situation owes its existence to some form of in
ordinate pride, a nagging irritability, a flirta
tious whim or an indulgent moodiness or incon
sistency of behavior. These result in a failure
to apply reason and sensitivity to prevent the
irrational instinct from causing chaos. 1 he re
sult is an endless series of blame and counter
blame, all equally foolish.
Such were the thoughts and reflections that

engulfed one during the four-hour ACT pro
duction of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Jour
ney into Night. Although the p) \y itself told a
story slightly different in details, it created the
disposition and substance for this response.
One could not and was unwilling to resist yield
ing to the immediacy of one's own either per
sonal or related experience. But this did no
injustice to the play—far from it—for inasmuch
as it compelled a vital contemplation and dia
logue in the mind of the spectator, it attained
one of the greatest achievements of serious
drama.
One is not so sure that O'Neill needed to tie
the whole grueling mutual self-destruction of
a pugnacious love (no matter how warped) to
some specific medical causality. Mary Cavan
Tyrone did not have to be accidentally (or in
nocently) addicted to dope introduced to her
in the pains of pregnancy. Nor did Edmund,
the ill-fated product of that child-birth, have
to have consumption. James Tyrone, the father,
could have been a spendthrift as easily as he
was a miser, and James Jr. might have been a
teetotaller. It could have been the best of all
possible worlds, and yet the whole painful, vi
cious, ridiculous mutual destruction could have
still existed. The situation does not require a
major causation. (In fact, it often arises from
a silly triviality.)
Nonetheless, O'Neill, with artistic control of
language and dialogue and his masterly im
pelling rather than unfolding of the expository
details (which he leaves for the second half),
succeeds in sustaining interest and involve
ment in a painful dramatic experience. What
is more, he does this for almost twice the dura
tion of a regular full-length play. That the re
sult on stage at the Marines' Theatre was ex
citingly exhausting rather than boring was
thanks to both the playwright's genius and the
generally excellent acting of William Patterson
as James Tyrone, Josephine Nichols as his wife
Mary, John Schuck as James Jr., and David
Dukes as the younger son, Edmund.
Nichols' portrayal of the most difficult and
affected Mary was especially noteworthy.
Kitty Winn as Cathleen had her own peculiar
pathetic charm. Robert Goldsby's production
offered Schuck a bigger role than that of the
King's Officer which he played in Tartuffe, but
he is still too stiff and awkard for aesthetic
pleasure or visual comfort —or both.
