# Folk rock with 'Cream' An unclassifiable treat
## 
### 
Cream, a trio of gifted British rock musicians who are in a
class by themselves, put on an awesome display of instrumental
skill and superb musicianship last weekend at the Winterland
in San Francisco. The individual excellence of Ginger Baker on
drums, Eric Clapton on guitar, and Jack Bruce on bass and
mouth harp, and the sensitive arranging of Bruce and Felix
Pappalardi, the group's manager, combined to create a per
formance of rarely equaled quality.
Baker is at once the smoothest and most dramatic drummer
on the current scene. His sense of rhythmic anticipation, that
is. his ability to begin a complicated pattern early enough so
that it resolves at the moment when it is most effective, is un
canny. He gives each of the group's songs a distinctive, unfor
gettable drive, and is an exciting and creative soloist.
Clapton, who is regarded by his contemporaries as the best
rock guitarist in the world, plays with an air of relaxation which
belies the intensity of his music. He does not look at the guitar,
even dur ng the most difficult runs, and his fingers move with
a rapidity which seems virtually impossible. He is at his best in
long instrumental passages, when his imagination takes over
and allows him to approach the lull extent of his talent.
Bruce, who plays the electric bass as if it were a guitar, makes
the mouth harp an incredibly emotional and forceful instru
ment, and is an accomplished vocalist, rounds out the trio. Each
of the three artists stands out within the group, but what is truly
great about Cream is the blend Baker, Clapton, and Bruce are
able to achieve. The effect of one performing alone would be
memorable, but the effect of the three together is simply over
whelming. After each song, the huge crowd which packed the
Winterland to the bursting point seemed to let out a deep sigh,
as if they were totally spent from their involvement with what
they had just heard.
The group was particularly good in a twenty-minute version
of Baker's composition "Sweet Wine." Backed by Baker's pul
sating drums, Bruce and Clapton played an ecstatic, enipathetic
variation on the song's simple theme, demonstrating near-per
fect technique and improvisation.
A gigantic amplification system tuned to too high a volume
marred "Tales of Brave Ulysses," one of the best cuts from
Cream's most recent record album on Atco, Disraeli Gears.
Bruce's vocal was lost in the din of his bass and Clapton's fuzz
guitar, but fine instrumental work by all three members of the
group made the number a success.
Cream continues at Winterland this weekend, and once again
a full house is expected tonight and tomorrow. This is a group
worth seeing any time, and one which anyone, whether or not
he appreciates rock music, must agree is blessed with most
unusual and impressive talent.

Cream, a trio of gifted British rock musicians who are in a
class by themselves, put on an awesome display of instrumental
skill and superb musicianship last weekend at the Winterland
in San Francisco. The individual excellence of Ginger Baker on
drums, Eric Clapton on guitar, and Jack Bruce on bass and
mouth harp, and the sensitive arranging of Bruce and Felix
Pappalardi, the group's manager, combined to create a per
formance of rarely equaled quality.
Baker is at once the smoothest and most dramatic drummer
on the current scene. His sense of rhythmic anticipation, that
is. his ability to begin a complicated pattern early enough so
that it resolves at the moment when it is most effective, is un
canny. He gives each of the group's songs a distinctive, unfor
gettable drive, and is an exciting and creative soloist.
Clapton, who is regarded by his contemporaries as the best
rock guitarist in the world, plays with an air of relaxation which
belies the intensity of his music. He does not look at the guitar,
even dur ng the most difficult runs, and his fingers move with
a rapidity which seems virtually impossible. He is at his best in
long instrumental passages, when his imagination takes over
and allows him to approach the lull extent of his talent.
Bruce, who plays the electric bass as if it were a guitar, makes
the mouth harp an incredibly emotional and forceful instru
ment, and is an accomplished vocalist, rounds out the trio. Each
of the three artists stands out within the group, but what is truly
great about Cream is the blend Baker, Clapton, and Bruce are
able to achieve. The effect of one performing alone would be
memorable, but the effect of the three together is simply over
whelming. After each song, the huge crowd which packed the
Winterland to the bursting point seemed to let out a deep sigh,
as if they were totally spent from their involvement with what
they had just heard.
The group was particularly good in a twenty-minute version
of Baker's composition "Sweet Wine." Backed by Baker's pul
sating drums, Bruce and Clapton played an ecstatic, enipathetic
variation on the song's simple theme, demonstrating near-per
fect technique and improvisation.
A gigantic amplification system tuned to too high a volume
marred "Tales of Brave Ulysses," one of the best cuts from
Cream's most recent record album on Atco, Disraeli Gears.
Bruce's vocal was lost in the din of his bass and Clapton's fuzz
guitar, but fine instrumental work by all three members of the
group made the number a success.
Cream continues at Winterland this weekend, and once again
a full house is expected tonight and tomorrow. This is a group
worth seeing any time, and one which anyone, whether or not
he appreciates rock music, must agree is blessed with most
unusual and impressive talent.
