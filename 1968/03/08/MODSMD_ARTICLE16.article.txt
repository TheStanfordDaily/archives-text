# 'Stranger' in prose better than on film
## 
### 
Luehino Visconti has made a good movie
from a great book, The Stranger by Albert Ca
mus. While the movie is a faithful adaptation
and beautiful visualization of the novel, it is
impossible to duplicate the prose of Camus.
Having read the "script," I was not left be
hind by the quick and often unexplained tran
sitions. but I wondered about the effect of this
upon those who only see the movie. For the
movie is little more than a documentary made
from the novel.
In many instances Visconti is able to present
the full feeling of Camus. Meursault's apart
ment. the life he leads in Algiers, and the ab
surdity of his trial are presented clearly. But
occasionally — such as in the scenes on the
beach just before he kills the Arab—the movie
becomes unconvincing, merely a series of pic
tures to go along with the words of Camus.
Perhaps the greatest problem of the movie
is that we are not seeing an interpretation of
the character, simply the character himself. We
art- given all the facts and then asked to make
our own judgments. In the book we are able to
participate with Meursault because we are
reading his thoughts and he is talking to us.
However, when this is done on the screen, a
conflict is created. On one hand we see the ac
tion taking place, and then we hear the voice
of Meursault describing what is taking place,
often in the past tense.
A documentary style is perhaps the best way
to resolve this conflict. Visconti occasionally
presents events as present action, which allows
us to become involved with the character.
These are the best moments of this film.
It is perhaps unfair to ask anyone to "inter
pret" Camus' work. And this film is more of a
tribute to a great author, rather than an out
standing film. The greatest care has been taken
to follow the text of the novel word for word.
Visconti has preserved the master exactly, with
few hints of expression, and in doing so the
faithful pupil has failed to really explore be
yond the surface.
The difficulty of translating a novel into film
is that the inherent differences of each medium
must be understood. The written word and the

visual image do not convey the same things.
Visconti begins his movie with a bold attack,
but this is not carried through. Rather we are
forced to retreat into the prose of Camus, which
is better read than seen in subtitles or heard as
dialogue.
To make a great movie Visconti would have
had to deviate from the original, create new
dialogue, and generate a more distinct point of
view. With each of these steps the chance of
failure is greatly increased. He was not pre
pared to do this, and so we see instead a beau
tiful visual reproduction of The Stranger. Vis
conti should, in all fairness, be commended for
his production, which is filled with excellent
acting and attractive photography. The power
of the cinema has been forced to yield to the
written word, and only its reproductive abili
ties have been allowed to assert themselves.
Hopefully someday The Stranger will be made
into a movie, rather than simply be recorded
on film.
The Stranger is currently being shown at the
Paris Theatre in Palo Alto.

Perhaps the greatest problem of the movie
is that we are not seeing an interpretation of
the character, simply the character himself. We
art- given all the facts and then asked to make
our own judgments. In the book we are able to
participate with Meursault because we are
reading his thoughts and he is talking to us.
However, when this is done on the screen, a
conflict is created. On one hand we see the ac
tion taking place, and then we hear the voice
of Meursault describing what is taking place,
often in the past tense.
A documentary style is perhaps the best way
to resolve this conflict. Visconti occasionally
presents events as present action, which allows
us to become involved with the character.
These are the best moments of this film.
It is perhaps unfair to ask anyone to "inter
pret" Camus' work. And this film is more of a
tribute to a great author, rather than an out
standing film. The greatest care has been taken
to follow the text of the novel word for word.
Visconti has preserved the master exactly, with
few hints of expression, and in doing so the
faithful pupil has failed to really explore be
yond the surface.
The difficulty of translating a novel into film
is that the inherent differences of each medium
must be understood. The written word and the

visual image do not convey the same things.
Visconti begins his movie with a bold attack,
but this is not carried through. Rather we are
forced to retreat into the prose of Camus, which
is better read than seen in subtitles or heard as
dialogue.
To make a great movie Visconti would have
had to deviate from the original, create new
dialogue, and generate a more distinct point of
view. With each of these steps the chance of
failure is greatly increased. He was not pre
pared to do this, and so we see instead a beau
tiful visual reproduction of The Stranger. Vis
conti should, in all fairness, be commended for
his production, which is filled with excellent
acting and attractive photography. The power
of the cinema has been forced to yield to the
written word, and only its reproductive abili
ties have been allowed to assert themselves.
Hopefully someday The Stranger will be made
into a movie, rather than simply be recorded
on film.
The Stranger is currently being shown at the
Paris Theatre in Palo Alto.

Luehino Visconti has made a good movie
from a great book, The Stranger by Albert Ca
mus. While the movie is a faithful adaptation
and beautiful visualization of the novel, it is
impossible to duplicate the prose of Camus.
Having read the "script," I was not left be
hind by the quick and often unexplained tran
sitions. but I wondered about the effect of this
upon those who only see the movie. For the
movie is little more than a documentary made
from the novel.
In many instances Visconti is able to present
the full feeling of Camus. Meursault's apart
ment. the life he leads in Algiers, and the ab
surdity of his trial are presented clearly. But
occasionally — such as in the scenes on the
beach just before he kills the Arab—the movie
becomes unconvincing, merely a series of pic
tures to go along with the words of Camus.
