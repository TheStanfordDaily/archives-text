# 'La Triviata'

And "cultcha" has hit the frats! One of the
Phi Kaps dutifully rounded up his listening
crew for a late evening of light classics. This
week the theme was Strauss, Richard that is.
With an armful of records, the M.C. thoroughly
explained the themes of the tone poem, Ein
Heldenleben, each instrument represented this
or that—violin was woman. And everyone re
laxed to the music in absolute silence—save
for intermittent chuckles as particular themes
became obvious. The presentation was superb,
and the audience was extremely well mani
cured. Lack of time and crowded quarters made
the presentation less effective than it could
have been, but a hearty "bravo" (sincerely)
to cultural entertainment we didn't know ex
isted. We hope other residences will follow
suit. Come on Betas,
