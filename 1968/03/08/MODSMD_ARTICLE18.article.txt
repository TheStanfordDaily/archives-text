# Chastity Its Own Punishment' Soto's original melodrama
## 
### 
Voluptuous Chastity Purehcart slithers
across the stage while bashful, bumbling An
drew Acolyte, totally oblivious to her attempts
to seduce him, notes that she too wears P.F.
Flyers and asks if she might enjoy a game of
handball.
The first scene of Chastity Is Its Own Pun
ishment reveals the often-corny, yet spontane
ous and truly entertaining humor that makes
Soto House's all-original melodrama a resound
ing success.
Written by four members of the Creativity
house, the play follows in the finest tradition of
melodramas, with an innocent and naive hero
ine, Lily Lushchild (France Cordova), a
strong, fearless and simple-minded hero, An
drew Acolyte (Hal Ilothan), a devilish vil
lain, Brother Lee Love (John Omohundro),
the town minister's not - so - chaste daughter,
Chastity Pnreheart (Becky Whitehouse).
Also featured are the town drunk, Aloyis
cious Lushchild VII (Dave Zalk), and a fire
and-brimstone preacher, Pius Pureheart (Nel
sen Spickard).
A bartender (Sterling Speirn), complete
with slickercd hair, mustache, and ample pad
ding, adds to the old-time flavor.

About the only thing missing is the familiar
train that almost runs over the heroine. As one
cast member put it, "We just couldn't track one
down."
Over half of Soto's ninety members are ac
tively involved in the play. Alan Mokler, di
rector of the successful 1967 Gaieties, is direct
ing the production, and many will remember
Becky Whitehouse as the princess from"The
Wumberlogue," who fills in nicely for Chas
tity.
The Soto dining room has been completely
transformed into an intimate small theater
playhouse, complete with cafe tables and an
eager staff of Soto's own charming and robust
barmaids. Sandwiches and soft drinks will be
served and are being provided by the Jester.
Chastity Is Its Own Punishment is highty
recommended weekend entertainment. Re
serve tickets are on sale for 25 cents in front
of the post office for the four performances
scheduled for tonight and tomorrow night at
8:30 and 10:00.
Spectators are urged to come early, as the
first two showings were filled to standing-room
capacity and many had to be turned away.

Chastity Pnreheart (Becky Whitehouse).
Also featured are the town drunk, Aloyis
cious Lushchild VII (Dave Zalk), and a fire
and-brimstone preacher, Pius Pureheart (Nel
sen Spickard).
A bartender (Sterling Speirn), complete
with slickercd hair, mustache, and ample pad
ding, adds to the old-time flavor.

About the only thing missing is the familiar
train that almost runs over the heroine. As one
cast member put it, "We just couldn't track one
down."
Over half of Soto's ninety members are ac
tively involved in the play. Alan Mokler, di
rector of the successful 1967 Gaieties, is direct
ing the production, and many will remember
Becky Whitehouse as the princess from"The
Wumberlogue," who fills in nicely for Chas
tity.
The Soto dining room has been completely
transformed into an intimate small theater
playhouse, complete with cafe tables and an
eager staff of Soto's own charming and robust
barmaids. Sandwiches and soft drinks will be
served and are being provided by the Jester.
Chastity Is Its Own Punishment is highty
recommended weekend entertainment. Re
serve tickets are on sale for 25 cents in front
of the post office for the four performances
scheduled for tonight and tomorrow night at
8:30 and 10:00.
Spectators are urged to come early, as the

Voluptuous Chastity Purehcart slithers
across the stage while bashful, bumbling An
drew Acolyte, totally oblivious to her attempts
to seduce him, notes that she too wears P.F.
Flyers and asks if she might enjoy a game of
handball.
The first scene of Chastity Is Its Own Pun
ishment reveals the often-corny, yet spontane
ous and truly entertaining humor that makes
Soto House's all-original melodrama a resound
ing success.
Written by four members of the Creativity
house, the play follows in the finest tradition of
melodramas, with an innocent and naive hero
ine, Lily Lushchild (France Cordova), a
strong, fearless and simple-minded hero, An
drew Acolyte (Hal Ilothan), a devilish vil
lain, Brother Lee Love (John Omohundro),
the town minister's not - so - chaste daughter,
Chastity Pnreheart (Becky Whitehouse).
Also featured are the town drunk, Aloyis
cious Lushchild VII (Dave Zalk), and a fire
and-brimstone preacher, Pius Pureheart (Nel
sen Spickard).
A bartender (Sterling Speirn), complete
