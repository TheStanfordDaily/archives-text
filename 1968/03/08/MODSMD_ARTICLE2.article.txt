# The
						House that Jon built
## 
### bruce merry 
SCENE: A large square house at mid
night on a Sunday evening; squat, with violet
painted slats, with burning lights in all the
rooms, bunks silhouetted against the windows
of the second floor on Addison, a somber Sia
mese cat in one of those off Bryant. Little
movement is seen in the rooms; no curtains are
drawn; there is the tinkle of a somewhat mo
rose ukelele on the darkened steps leading un
to the porch. It is played by J., strumming and
singing, perched near two dilapidated bicycles
parked on the footpath.
Inside is the ground-floor sitting-room, scene
of ballet charades in black body-stocking, lo
cale for inner tingle of Drambuie, Grand Ar
magnac and Vins Superieurs, chamber for de
bate on Plato in English.
Next to the ground-floor sitting-room, ;m
-maculate and shabby, is "the Library." 2000
volumes from German to Psychology via Ethics
and Atlases, a collection of scholarly works
where the Norwegian Professor Folesdal [.vie]
prepared his Stanford lectures on Husserl be
cause he could not find the books he needed in
the Campus library.
The Library's annual budget is over $3000;
no glasses shall be placed on the table without
a wooden stand; ash shall be deposited in its
opportune receptacle; brooding and silence su
pervene. Occasionally detect a stifled footnote,
some introverted melancholic who needs a
soul-brother, but definitely no L.S.D., no
beards, marijuana or politics in "The House."
This is one hundredth fraction of the outer
facade of Jonathan Ketchum's duly constituted
off-campus residence for Stanford rejects, i.e.
those who, in their sophomore year, rejected
Stanford. Ketchum is by a similar definition a
Stanford reject. For eight years he struggled
with the phenomenology of German idealism,
with the towering abstractions of Hegel. In
vain; he leaves this summer with four of those
who surround him for Buffalo, New York, for
an academy built with his own money and his
non-Ph.d.
It is hard, despite the riir of maudlin intensity
whieh hangs over Ketchum's disciples, not to
admire them. For seven years the trickle of
thirteen students annually has kept the House
in business. It has a gross budget of $60,000 an
nually and loses only two Grand a year. Room
and board are at Stern Hall rates. Some of the
residents have done remodelling in lieu of fees,
while one student, now a music graduate at
Berkeley, built a two-manual harpsichord with
four sets of strings.
What Ketchum's invisible and articulate
leadership gives them is hard to define. In my
own experience as a Faculty member of Stan
ford I have rarely felt such tangible and con
centrated brooding. No illusion of eccentircity,
no fantasy of Hippie unconventionality dis
tracts their work and meditation. Their single
concession to sport is long distance running in
short trousers.
Ketchum's residents are those true intellec
tual conservatives: aristocrats of the desk; plu
tocrats of the pen. One has glimpsed figures
hunched over the same German paragraph of
the same Greek etymology for as long as it took
to draft a chapter in a summer thesis.
For Ketchum's guests at dinner the vast oval

table with its green felt covering can beeome a
harrowing sea of wine and scorn and losing
dialectic. Not a person in the House has the re
motest respect for a professor's intrinsic status.
An Assistant Professor I know can find little
sympathy for his stammer. Teutonic dourness
is cut down with horizontal sneers. My own
brand of English empiricism is scythed with
vertical smiles.
Let us imagine a typical meal. The distin
guished guest has been announced (after all,
he is eating free) and has embarked on some
rather dangerous cocktail generalities about a
philosopher he but inadequately knows or
about teaching, a subject alien to many of those
who are paid to do it.

DRAMATIS PERSONAE:
Wretched Professor; Ketchumite; Nameless
Dispenser Of Wine; Supporting Ketchumite.
Wretched Professor: The point I was trying
to make was that . . .
Ketchumite: Your point was that you hadn't
understood my question.
W.P.: I understood your question perfectly,
but I merely . ..
K.: You understood it; do you still under
stand it?
W.P.: Well yes, obviously.
K.: Then could you repeat the question?
Nameless Dispenser Of Wine: Professor, can
I fill up your glass?
Supporting Ketchumite: Your ash, Professor,
it's dropped on your lap.
W.P.: So it has. Now where were we?
K.: We, Professor? You were busy rephrasing
the question.
W.P.: As a remember it, your question was
how can Identity presuppose the One.
K.: Actually I asked you first if you had for
mulated a philosophy of education.
W.P.: ( Wittily) A philosophy of education
or an education for philosophers?
Massed Ketchumites: •
N.D.W.: More wine, Professor?

S.K.: Your elbow's in your plate, Professor.
W.P.: Thanks; I thought we abandoned tha
inquiry and proceeded to the One in Hegel.
K.: Who abandons inquiries: the questione
or the answerer?
W.P.: Eh?
K.: Put another way: is it not the questione
who should direct dialectic?
W.P.: Yes, but I can't understand your ques
tions.
K.: A few moments ago you said you under
stood them perfectly.
S.K.: Yeah, 'perfectly.'
W.P.: But now I can't.
K.: Are you really listening to them?
W.P.: Sure I am.
K.: Then why can't you repeat them?
W.P.: The One in Hegel, nominalism it
Duns Scotus, Plato's myths, the role of the edu
cator, the role of the answerer; my head's spin
ning; I think I've eaten too much of your wine
[Crash ]
S.K.: Professor, your head has fallen upoi
your plate.
N.D.W.: Mrs. K , would your hus
band care for some more wine?
(End of instructive sceru' from Ketchum s
dinner table)

As often as not dinner ends in heavy silence
Picture the Professor snoring sonorously ove
his plate and fifteen people, with three or fou
escorted females, sitting to prod at left-over ap
pie tart mixed with cigarette ash and gobs o
intellectual saliva as music pours in from tin
opened doors of the sitting-room and Bach es
tablishes the virginity of Mary or Smetana re
defines the Danube.
When Ketchum himself is there for dinne
people stand behind their chairs until he give
the word. Then he serves, from trays preparei
by a distant Teutonic cook, with trusties glonl
ing due portions of flora onto plates where h<
has already served meat. W r hen Jon is gone
however, dinner can be gloomy, diffuse; so

"Ketchum's is a pot house that drives people
mad." (a former Stanford Dean of Women)
