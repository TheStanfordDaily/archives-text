# The 						House that Jon built
## 
### bruce merry 
SCENE: A large square house at mid
night on a Sunday evening; squat, with violet
painted slats, with burning lights in all the
rooms, bunks silhouetted against the windows
of the second floor on Addison, a somber Sia
mese cat in one of those off Bryant. Little
movement is seen in the rooms; no curtains are
drawn; there is the tinkle of a somewhat mo
rose ukelele on the darkened steps leading un
to the porch. It is played by J., strumming and
singing, perched near two dilapidated bicycles
parked on the footpath.
Inside is the ground-floor sitting-room, scene
of ballet charades in black body-stocking, lo
cale for inner tingle of Drambuie, Grand Ar
magnac and Vins Superieurs, chamber for de
bate on Plato in English.
Next to the ground-floor sitting-room, ;m
-maculate and shabby, is "the Library." 2000
volumes from German to Psychology via Ethics
and Atlases, a collection of scholarly works
where the Norwegian Professor Folesdal [.vie]
prepared his Stanford lectures on Husserl be
cause he could not find the books he needed in
the Campus library.
The Library's annual budget is over $3000;
no glasses shall be placed on the table without
a wooden stand; ash shall be deposited in its
opportune receptacle; brooding and silence su
pervene. Occasionally detect a stifled footnote,
some introverted melancholic who needs a
soul-brother, but definitely no L.S.D., no
beards, marijuana or politics in "The House."
This is one hundredth fraction of the outer
facade of Jonathan Ketchum's duly constituted
off-campus residence for Stanford rejects, i.e.
those who, in their sophomore year, rejected
Stanford. Ketchum is by a similar definition a
Stanford reject. For eight years he struggled
with the phenomenology of German idealism,
with the towering abstractions of Hegel. In
vain; he leaves this summer with four of those
who surround him for Buffalo, New York, for
an academy built with his own money and his
non-Ph.d.
It is hard, despite the riir of maudlin intensity
whieh hangs over Ketchum's disciples, not to
admire them. For seven years the trickle of
thirteen students annually has kept the House
in business. It has a gross budget of $60,000 an
nually and loses only two Grand a year. Room
and board are at Stern Hall rates. Some of the
residents have done remodelling in lieu of fees,
while one student, now a music graduate at
Berkeley, built a two-manual harpsichord with
four sets of strings.
What Ketchum's invisible and articulate
leadership gives them is hard to define. In my
own experience as a Faculty member of Stan
ford I have rarely felt such tangible and con
centrated brooding. No illusion of eccentircity,
no fantasy of Hippie unconventionality dis
tracts their work and meditation. Their single
concession to sport is long distance running in
short trousers.
Ketchum's residents are those true intellec
tual conservatives: aristocrats of the desk; plu
tocrats of the pen. One has glimpsed figures
hunched over the same German paragraph of
the same Greek etymology for as long as it took
to draft a chapter in a summer thesis.
For Ketchum's guests at dinner the vast oval

table with its green felt covering can beeome a
harrowing sea of wine and scorn and losing
dialectic. Not a person in the House has the re
motest respect for a professor's intrinsic status.
An Assistant Professor I know can find little
sympathy for his stammer. Teutonic dourness
is cut down with horizontal sneers. My own
brand of English empiricism is scythed with
vertical smiles.
Let us imagine a typical meal. The distin
guished guest has been announced (after all,
he is eating free) and has embarked on some
rather dangerous cocktail generalities about a
philosopher he but inadequately knows or
about teaching, a subject alien to many of those
who are paid to do it.

DRAMATIS PERSONAE:
Wretched Professor; Ketchumite; Nameless
Dispenser Of Wine; Supporting Ketchumite.
Wretched Professor: The point I was trying
to make was that . . .
Ketchumite: Your point was that you hadn't
understood my question.
W.P.: I understood your question perfectly,
but I merely . ..
K.: You understood it; do you still under
stand it?
W.P.: Well yes, obviously.
K.: Then could you repeat the question?
Nameless Dispenser Of Wine: Professor, can
I fill up your glass?
Supporting Ketchumite: Your ash, Professor,
it's dropped on your lap.
W.P.: So it has. Now where were we?
K.: We, Professor? You were busy rephrasing
the question.
W.P.: As a remember it, your question was
how can Identity presuppose the One.
K.: Actually I asked you first if you had for
mulated a philosophy of education.
W.P.: ( Wittily) A philosophy of education
or an education for philosophers?
Massed Ketchumites: •
N.D.W.: More wine, Professor?

S.K.: Your elbow's in your plate, Professor.
W.P.: Thanks; I thought we abandoned tha
inquiry and proceeded to the One in Hegel.
K.: Who abandons inquiries: the questione
or the answerer?
W.P.: Eh?
K.: Put another way: is it not the questione
who should direct dialectic?
W.P.: Yes, but I can't understand your ques
tions.
K.: A few moments ago you said you under
stood them perfectly.
S.K.: Yeah, 'perfectly.'
W.P.: But now I can't.
K.: Are you really listening to them?
W.P.: Sure I am.
K.: Then why can't you repeat them?
W.P.: The One in Hegel, nominalism it
Duns Scotus, Plato's myths, the role of the edu
cator, the role of the answerer; my head's spin
ning; I think I've eaten too much of your wine
[Crash ]
S.K.: Professor, your head has fallen upoi
your plate.
N.D.W.: Mrs. K , would your hus
band care for some more wine?

dinner table)

As often as not dinner ends in heavy silence
Picture the Professor snoring sonorously ove
his plate and fifteen people, with three or fou
escorted females, sitting to prod at left-over ap
pie tart mixed with cigarette ash and gobs o
intellectual saliva as music pours in from tin
opened doors of the sitting-room and Bach es
tablishes the virginity of Mary or Smetana re
defines the Danube.
When Ketchum himself is there for dinne
people stand behind their chairs until he give
the word. Then he serves, from trays preparei
by a distant Teutonic cook, with trusties glonl
ing due portions of flora onto plates where h<
has already served meat. W r hen Jon is gone
however, dinner can be gloomy, diffuse; so

mad." (a former Stanford Dean of Women)

phistry and dialectic mingled under bent necks
and glimmering candles.
While textual criticism and the niceties of
academic scholarship are never the strong suit
of House members, their sense of philosophical
speculation and cultural history has become ex
tremely cogent with the chopping-stone disci
pline of three- to four-hour dinner sessions.
Some of the bogeys of student dialectic are
there: the quoted titles of unread volumes,
third-hand political gossip which is culled
mainly from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and Newsweek (though the lat
ter, like all the periodicals, they affect to read
only on the john) and above all an ultra-serious
attitude to those problems which the Victorian
educator disrespectfully dubbed "growing
pains."
Their capacity for life in the minor key is a
veritable masterwork. House members con
stantly schedule formal meetings with each oth
er, usually d deux. With bowed heads and state
ly gait they repair to a green patch on the front
lawn, a dimly lit sofa in the sitting-room or a
corner of the Kitchen Table.
Here are thrashed out the lynch-pins of exis
tence: their personal discussion style is a re
markable synthesis of pallid concern and ribald
sarcasm. A rigid and inscrutable system of de
fence mechanisms prevents the use of this style
with strangers: hence, presumably, the "could
you repeat my last question?" or the "define
what you mean by 'mean' please" and the fron
tal "I don't think you know what you're talking
about;" the latter gambit usually accompanied
by converging Ketchumite solidarity against
the opponent in extremis, a snicker that ripples
round, not a guffaw that explodes over, their
table.
The musical taste developed by a quite ex
traordinarily fine stereo system which the Mas
ter of the House has put at the disposal of all,
provided they "use their head, and a brand-new
needle, and treat it (not your head) with care,"

and a collection of 600 records that is uniformly
good. Their sense of the plastic arts is virtually
non-existent.
Three or four are members of the Air Force
R.0.T.C.; others explain that they have corrupt
or careless draft boards. I have only met one
person in or at the House who would be pre
pared to go to jail. None believe in the War,
but none do much to oppose it. It would not be
unfair to call Ketchum's atmosphere "apoliti
cal." When you surface from a thirty-hour
preparation of a reading from Plato's Republic
and then have to prove that most preceding in
terpretations of a passage from it were wrong,
you clearly feel inclined to say "rhubarb" to
Romney or "where?'' to Khe Sanh.
Such a tightly-knit and conservative group
could never find time for Radicalism; it is not
that they are above it—they are outside it. This
detachment from the currents of both the na
tion and the Campus has been fecund in its
own way: each summer for the past five years
Ketchum has been teaching beginning Greek,
and for the last three years the House has met
to read Plato, Aristotle or a pre-Socratic philos
opher in Greek, in three sessions a week
throughout the school year.
Also for the past five years there have been
seminars which met once a week for the whole
school year on one philosopher or even one
work. These have been:
1967-68: major dialogues of Plato.
1966-67: Hegel: Phenomenology, first
three chapters.
1965-66: major dialogues of Plato.
1964-65: Husserl: Ideas Towards a Pure
Phenomenology.
1963-64: Kant: First Critique; Hegel:
Phenomenology.
There have also been the following summer
seminars, which met five times a week:
1967: The Enlightenment; a study in
philosophy and cultural history.

1966: Windelband's History of Philoso
phy.
1965: Aristotle's Metaphysics in English;
Book X in Greek.
The house seminars presuppose hours of prepa
ration for each meeting and it has not been un
usual for the classes to contain regular com
muters from Berkeley and San Francisco.
The actual record of the House members is
interesting; NDEA's and graduate scholarships
are awarded to nearly 100% of the occupants.
At least two Ph.d.'s have been completed so far
and there are about eight non-resident Ph.d.
candidates scattered around the country from
Yale to Toronto.
But what this splendid concern has done,
and what Stanford has been totally oblivious
to its having done, is to produce the kind of
climate in which abstract and idealistic specu
lation could not only flourish but also entertain.
Ketchum has been engaged in an up-hill strug
gle against a university administration which
suspects his diversity.
It would be no exaggeration to say that the
toughest and most stimulating philosophy at
Stanford in the last few years has been done
chez Ketchum rather than at the North corner
of Stanford's quadrangle. A sad commentary on
this is the fact that the great majority of his
students cannot see their way to majoring in
their favorite subject. The crop of present ma
jors around the House is: German, Humanities,
German, Graduate at Large, Mathematics,
Philosophy, History, Psychology, Mathematics,
German, leave cf absence from Medical School,
History.
The House folds up in June because enough
is as good as a feast. Ketchum's patience with
the Ph.d. machine has run out as, presumably,
it has with him. When the organization of such
a House has been forgotten it is lucky that
Stanford, and not philosophy, will be the loser,
for: Nemo dat quod non lwbet.

phistry and dialectic mingled under bent necks
and glimmering candles.
While textual criticism and the niceties of
academic scholarship are never the strong suit
of House members, their sense of philosophical
speculation and cultural history has become ex
tremely cogent with the chopping-stone disci
pline of three- to four-hour dinner sessions.
Some of the bogeys of student dialectic are
there: the quoted titles of unread volumes,
third-hand political gossip which is culled
mainly from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and Newsweek (though the lat
ter, like all the periodicals, they affect to read
only on the john) and above all an ultra-serious
attitude to those problems which the Victorian
educator disrespectfully dubbed "growing
pains."
Their capacity for life in the minor key is a
veritable masterwork. House members con
stantly schedule formal meetings with each oth
er, usually d deux. With bowed heads and state
ly gait they repair to a green patch on the front
lawn, a dimly lit sofa in the sitting-room or a
corner of the Kitchen Table.
Here are thrashed out the lynch-pins of exis
tence: their personal discussion style is a re
markable synthesis of pallid concern and ribald
sarcasm. A rigid and inscrutable system of de
fence mechanisms prevents the use of this style
with strangers: hence, presumably, the "could
you repeat my last question?" or the "define
what you mean by 'mean' please" and the fron
tal "I don't think you know what you're talking
about;" the latter gambit usually accompanied
by converging Ketchumite solidarity against
the opponent in extremis, a snicker that ripples
round, not a guffaw that explodes over, their
table.
The musical taste developed by a quite ex
traordinarily fine stereo system which the Mas
ter of the House has put at the disposal of all,
provided they "use their head, and a brand-new
needle, and treat it (not your head) with care,"

and a collection of 600 records that is uniformly
good. Their sense of the plastic arts is virtually
non-existent.
Three or four are members of the Air Force
R.0.T.C.; others explain that they have corrupt
or careless draft boards. I have only met one
person in or at the House who would be pre
pared to go to jail. None believe in the War,
but none do much to oppose it. It would not be
unfair to call Ketchum's atmosphere "apoliti
cal." When you surface from a thirty-hour
preparation of a reading from Plato's Republic
and then have to prove that most preceding in
terpretations of a passage from it were wrong,
you clearly feel inclined to say "rhubarb" to
Romney or "where?'' to Khe Sanh.
Such a tightly-knit and conservative group
could never find time for Radicalism; it is not
that they are above it—they are outside it. This
detachment from the currents of both the na
tion and the Campus has been fecund in its
own way: each summer for the past five years
Ketchum has been teaching beginning Greek,
and for the last three years the House has met
to read Plato, Aristotle or a pre-Socratic philos
opher in Greek, in three sessions a week
throughout the school year.
Also for the past five years there have been
seminars which met once a week for the whole
school year on one philosopher or even one
work. These have been:
1967-68: major dialogues of Plato.
1966-67: Hegel: Phenomenology, first
three chapters.
1965-66: major dialogues of Plato.
1964-65: Husserl: Ideas Towards a Pure
Phenomenology.
1963-64: Kant: First Critique; Hegel:
Phenomenology.
There have also been the following summer
seminars, which met five times a week:
1967: The Enlightenment; a study in
philosophy and cultural history.

1966: Windelband's History of Philoso
phy.
1965: Aristotle's Metaphysics in English;
Book X in Greek.
The house seminars presuppose hours of prepa
ration for each meeting and it has not been un
usual for the classes to contain regular com
muters from Berkeley and San Francisco.
The actual record of the House members is
interesting; NDEA's and graduate scholarships
are awarded to nearly 100% of the occupants.
At least two Ph.d.'s have been completed so far
and there are about eight non-resident Ph.d.
candidates scattered around the country from
Yale to Toronto.
But what this splendid concern has done,
and what Stanford has been totally oblivious
to its having done, is to produce the kind of
climate in which abstract and idealistic specu
lation could not only flourish but also entertain.
Ketchum has been engaged in an up-hill strug
gle against a university administration which
suspects his diversity.
It would be no exaggeration to say that the
toughest and most stimulating philosophy at
Stanford in the last few years has been done
chez Ketchum rather than at the North corner
of Stanford's quadrangle. A sad commentary on
this is the fact that the great majority of his
students cannot see their way to majoring in
their favorite subject. The crop of present ma
jors around the House is: German, Humanities,
German, Graduate at Large, Mathematics,
Philosophy, History, Psychology, Mathematics,
German, leave cf absence from Medical School,
History.
The House folds up in June because enough
is as good as a feast. Ketchum's patience with
the Ph.d. machine has run out as, presumably,
it has with him. When the organization of such
a House has been forgotten it is lucky that
Stanford, and not philosophy, will be the loser,
for: Nemo dat quod non lwbet.

Seminar participants make themselves quite comfortable for
the Monday night sessions which often last past midnight.
SCENE: A large square house at mid
night on a Sunday evening; squat, with violet
painted slats, with burning lights in all the
rooms, bunks silhouetted against the windows
of the second floor on Addison, a somber Sia
mese cat in one of those off Bryant. Little
movement is seen in the rooms; no curtains are
drawn; there is the tinkle of a somewhat mo
rose ukelele on the darkened steps leading un
to the porch. It is played by J., strumming and
singing, perched near two dilapidated bicycles
parked on the footpath.
Inside is the ground-floor sitting-room, scene
of ballet charades in black body-stocking, lo
cale for inner tingle of Drambuie, Grand Ar
magnac and Vins Superieurs, chamber for de
bate on Plato in English.
Next to the ground-floor sitting-room, ;m
-maculate and shabby, is "the Library." 2000
volumes from German to Psychology via Ethics
and Atlases, a collection of scholarly works
where the Norwegian Professor Folesdal [.vie]
prepared his Stanford lectures on Husserl be
cause he could not find the books he needed in
the Campus library.
The Library's annual budget is over $3000;
no glasses shall be placed on the table without
a wooden stand; ash shall be deposited in its
opportune receptacle; brooding and silence su
pervene. Occasionally detect a stifled footnote,
some introverted melancholic who needs a
soul-brother, but definitely no L.S.D., no
beards, marijuana or politics in "The House."
This is one hundredth fraction of the outer
facade of Jonathan Ketchum's duly constituted
off-campus residence for Stanford rejects, i.e.
those who, in their sophomore year, rejected
Stanford. Ketchum is by a similar definition a
Stanford reject. For eight years he struggled
with the phenomenology of German idealism,
with the towering abstractions of Hegel. In
vain; he leaves this summer with four of those
who surround him for Buffalo, New York, for
an academy built with his own money and his
non-Ph.d.
It is hard, despite the riir of maudlin intensity
whieh hangs over Ketchum's disciples, not to
admire them. For seven years the trickle of
thirteen students annually has kept the House
in business. It has a gross budget of $60,000 an
nually and loses only two Grand a year. Room
and board are at Stern Hall rates. Some of the
residents have done remodelling in lieu of fees,
while one student, now a music graduate at
Berkeley, built a two-manual harpsichord with
four sets of strings.
What Ketchum's invisible and articulate
leadership gives them is hard to define. In my
own experience as a Faculty member of Stan
ford I have rarely felt such tangible and con
centrated brooding. No illusion of eccentircity,
no fantasy of Hippie unconventionality dis
tracts their work and meditation. Their single
concession to sport is long distance running in
short trousers.
Ketchum's residents are those true intellec
tual conservatives: aristocrats of the desk; plu
tocrats of the pen. One has glimpsed figures
hunched over the same German paragraph of
the same Greek etymology for as long as it took
to draft a chapter in a summer thesis.
For Ketchum's guests at dinner the vast oval

table with its green felt covering can beeome a
harrowing sea of wine and scorn and losing
dialectic. Not a person in the House has the re
motest respect for a professor's intrinsic status.
An Assistant Professor I know can find little
sympathy for his stammer. Teutonic dourness
is cut down with horizontal sneers. My own
brand of English empiricism is scythed with
vertical smiles.
Let us imagine a typical meal. The distin
guished guest has been announced (after all,
he is eating free) and has embarked on some
rather dangerous cocktail generalities about a
philosopher he but inadequately knows or
about teaching, a subject alien to many of those
who are paid to do it.

1963-64: Kant: First Critique; Hegel:
Phenomenology.
There have also been the following summer
seminars, which met five times a week:
1967: The Enlightenment; a study in
philosophy and cultural history.

1966: Windelband's History of Philoso
phy.
1965: Aristotle's Metaphysics in English;
Book X in Greek.
The house seminars presuppose hours of prepa
ration for each meeting and it has not been un
usual for the classes to contain regular com
muters from Berkeley and San Francisco.
The actual record of the House members is
interesting; NDEA's and graduate scholarships
are awarded to nearly 100% of the occupants.
At least two Ph.d.'s have been completed so far
and there are about eight non-resident Ph.d.
candidates scattered around the country from
Yale to Toronto.
But what this splendid concern has done,
and what Stanford has been totally oblivious
to its having done, is to produce the kind of
climate in which abstract and idealistic specu
lation could not only flourish but also entertain.
Ketchum has been engaged in an up-hill strug
gle against a university administration which
suspects his diversity.
It would be no exaggeration to say that the
toughest and most stimulating philosophy at
Stanford in the last few years has been done
chez Ketchum rather than at the North corner
of Stanford's quadrangle. A sad commentary on
this is the fact that the great majority of his
students cannot see their way to majoring in
their favorite subject. The crop of present ma
jors around the House is: German, Humanities,
German, Graduate at Large, Mathematics,
Philosophy, History, Psychology, Mathematics,
German, leave cf absence from Medical School,
History.
The House folds up in June because enough
is as good as a feast. Ketchum's patience with
the Ph.d. machine has run out as, presumably,
it has with him. When the organization of such
a House has been forgotten it is lucky that
Stanford, and not philosophy, will be the loser,
for: Nemo dat quod non lwbet.

Seminar participants make themselves quite comfortable for
the Monday night sessions which often last past midnight.
SCENE: A large square house at mid
night on a Sunday evening; squat, with violet
painted slats, with burning lights in all the
rooms, bunks silhouetted against the windows
of the second floor on Addison, a somber Sia
mese cat in one of those off Bryant. Little
movement is seen in the rooms; no curtains are
drawn; there is the tinkle of a somewhat mo
rose ukelele on the darkened steps leading un
to the porch. It is played by J., strumming and
singing, perched near two dilapidated bicycles
parked on the footpath.
Inside is the ground-floor sitting-room, scene
of ballet charades in black body-stocking, lo
cale for inner tingle of Drambuie, Grand Ar
magnac and Vins Superieurs, chamber for de
bate on Plato in English.
Next to the ground-floor sitting-room, ;m
-maculate and shabby, is "the Library." 2000
volumes from German to Psychology via Ethics
and Atlases, a collection of scholarly works
where the Norwegian Professor Folesdal [.vie]
prepared his Stanford lectures on Husserl be
cause he could not find the books he needed in
the Campus library.
The Library's annual budget is over $3000;
no glasses shall be placed on the table without
a wooden stand; ash shall be deposited in its
opportune receptacle; brooding and silence su
pervene. Occasionally detect a stifled footnote,
some introverted melancholic who needs a
soul-brother, but definitely no L.S.D., no
beards, marijuana or politics in "The House."
This is one hundredth fraction of the outer
facade of Jonathan Ketchum's duly constituted
off-campus residence for Stanford rejects, i.e.
those who, in their sophomore year, rejected
Stanford. Ketchum is by a similar definition a
Stanford reject. For eight years he struggled
with the phenomenology of German idealism,
with the towering abstractions of Hegel. In
vain; he leaves this summer with four of those
who surround him for Buffalo, New York, for
an academy built with his own money and his
non-Ph.d.
It is hard, despite the riir of maudlin intensity
whieh hangs over Ketchum's disciples, not to
admire them. For seven years the trickle of
thirteen students annually has kept the House
in business. It has a gross budget of $60,000 an
nually and loses only two Grand a year. Room
and board are at Stern Hall rates. Some of the
residents have done remodelling in lieu of fees,
while one student, now a music graduate at
Berkeley, built a two-manual harpsichord with
four sets of strings.
What Ketchum's invisible and articulate
leadership gives them is hard to define. In my
own experience as a Faculty member of Stan
ford I have rarely felt such tangible and con
centrated brooding. No illusion of eccentircity,
no fantasy of Hippie unconventionality dis
tracts their work and meditation. Their single
concession to sport is long distance running in
short trousers.
Ketchum's residents are those true intellec
tual conservatives: aristocrats of the desk; plu
tocrats of the pen. One has glimpsed figures
hunched over the same German paragraph of
the same Greek etymology for as long as it took
to draft a chapter in a summer thesis.
For Ketchum's guests at dinner the vast oval

table with its green felt covering can beeome a
harrowing sea of wine and scorn and losing
dialectic. Not a person in the House has the re
motest respect for a professor's intrinsic status.
An Assistant Professor I know can find little
sympathy for his stammer. Teutonic dourness
is cut down with horizontal sneers. My own
brand of English empiricism is scythed with
vertical smiles.
Let us imagine a typical meal. The distin
guished guest has been announced (after all,
he is eating free) and has embarked on some
rather dangerous cocktail generalities about a
philosopher he but inadequately knows or
about teaching, a subject alien to many of those
who are paid to do it.

DRAMATIS PERSONAE:
Wretched Professor; Ketchumite; Nameless
Dispenser Of Wine; Supporting Ketchumite.
Wretched Professor: The point I was trying
to make was that . . .
Ketchumite: Your point was that you hadn't
understood my question.
W.P.: I understood your question perfectly,
but I merely . ..
K.: You understood it; do you still under
stand it?
W.P.: Well yes, obviously.
K.: Then could you repeat the question?
Nameless Dispenser Of Wine: Professor, can
I fill up your glass?
Supporting Ketchumite: Your ash, Professor,
it's dropped on your lap.
W.P.: So it has. Now where were we?
K.: We, Professor? You were busy rephrasing
the question.
W.P.: As a remember it, your question was
how can Identity presuppose the One.
K.: Actually I asked you first if you had for
mulated a philosophy of education.
W.P.: ( Wittily) A philosophy of education
or an education for philosophers?
Massed Ketchumites: •
N.D.W.: More wine, Professor?

S.K.: Your elbow's in your plate, Professor.
W.P.: Thanks; I thought we abandoned tha
inquiry and proceeded to the One in Hegel.
K.: Who abandons inquiries: the questione
or the answerer?
W.P.: Eh?
K.: Put another way: is it not the questione
who should direct dialectic?
W.P.: Yes, but I can't understand your ques
tions.
K.: A few moments ago you said you under
stood them perfectly.
S.K.: Yeah, 'perfectly.'
W.P.: But now I can't.
K.: Are you really listening to them?
W.P.: Sure I am.
K.: Then why can't you repeat them?
W.P.: The One in Hegel, nominalism it
Duns Scotus, Plato's myths, the role of the edu
cator, the role of the answerer; my head's spin
ning; I think I've eaten too much of your wine
[Crash ]
S.K.: Professor, your head has fallen upoi
your plate.
N.D.W.: Mrs. K , would your hus
band care for some more wine?
(End of instructive sceru' from Ketchum s
dinner table)

As often as not dinner ends in heavy silence
Picture the Professor snoring sonorously ove
his plate and fifteen people, with three or fou
escorted females, sitting to prod at left-over ap
pie tart mixed with cigarette ash and gobs o
intellectual saliva as music pours in from tin
opened doors of the sitting-room and Bach es
tablishes the virginity of Mary or Smetana re
defines the Danube.
When Ketchum himself is there for dinne
people stand behind their chairs until he give
the word. Then he serves, from trays preparei
by a distant Teutonic cook, with trusties glonl
ing due portions of flora onto plates where h<
has already served meat. W r hen Jon is gone

phistry and dialectic mingled under bent necks
and glimmering candles.
While textual criticism and the niceties of
academic scholarship are never the strong suit
of House members, their sense of philosophical
speculation and cultural history has become ex
tremely cogent with the chopping-stone disci
pline of three- to four-hour dinner sessions.
Some of the bogeys of student dialectic are
there: the quoted titles of unread volumes,
third-hand political gossip which is culled
mainly from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and Newsweek (though the lat
ter, like all the periodicals, they affect to read
only on the john) and above all an ultra-serious
attitude to those problems which the Victorian
educator disrespectfully dubbed "growing
pains."
Their capacity for life in the minor key is a
veritable masterwork. House members con
stantly schedule formal meetings with each oth
er, usually d deux. With bowed heads and state
ly gait they repair to a green patch on the front
lawn, a dimly lit sofa in the sitting-room or a
corner of the Kitchen Table.
Here are thrashed out the lynch-pins of exis
tence: their personal discussion style is a re
markable synthesis of pallid concern and ribald
sarcasm. A rigid and inscrutable system of de
fence mechanisms prevents the use of this style
with strangers: hence, presumably, the "could
you repeat my last question?" or the "define
what you mean by 'mean' please" and the fron
tal "I don't think you know what you're talking
about;" the latter gambit usually accompanied
by converging Ketchumite solidarity against
the opponent in extremis, a snicker that ripples
round, not a guffaw that explodes over, their
table.
The musical taste developed by a quite ex
traordinarily fine stereo system which the Mas
ter of the House has put at the disposal of all,
provided they "use their head, and a brand-new
needle, and treat it (not your head) with care,"

and a collection of 600 records that is uniformly
good. Their sense of the plastic arts is virtually
non-existent.
Three or four are members of the Air Force
R.0.T.C.; others explain that they have corrupt
or careless draft boards. I have only met one
person in or at the House who would be pre
pared to go to jail. None believe in the War,
but none do much to oppose it. It would not be
unfair to call Ketchum's atmosphere "apoliti
cal." When you surface from a thirty-hour
preparation of a reading from Plato's Republic
and then have to prove that most preceding in
terpretations of a passage from it were wrong,
you clearly feel inclined to say "rhubarb" to
Romney or "where?'' to Khe Sanh.
Such a tightly-knit and conservative group
could never find time for Radicalism; it is not
that they are above it—they are outside it. This
detachment from the currents of both the na
tion and the Campus has been fecund in its
own way: each summer for the past five years
Ketchum has been teaching beginning Greek,
and for the last three years the House has met
to read Plato, Aristotle or a pre-Socratic philos
opher in Greek, in three sessions a week
throughout the school year.
Also for the past five years there have been
seminars which met once a week for the whole
school year on one philosopher or even one
work. These have been:
1967-68: major dialogues of Plato.
1966-67: Hegel: Phenomenology, first
three chapters.
1965-66: major dialogues of Plato.
1964-65: Husserl: Ideas Towards a Pure
Phenomenology.
1963-64: Kant: First Critique; Hegel:
Phenomenology.
There have also been the following summer
seminars, which met five times a week:

tocrats of the pen. One has glimpsed figures
hunched over the same German paragraph of
the same Greek etymology for as long as it took
to draft a chapter in a summer thesis.
For Ketchum's guests at dinner the vast oval

table with its green felt covering can beeome a
harrowing sea of wine and scorn and losing
dialectic. Not a person in the House has the re
motest respect for a professor's intrinsic status.
An Assistant Professor I know can find little
sympathy for his stammer. Teutonic dourness
is cut down with horizontal sneers. My own
brand of English empiricism is scythed with
vertical smiles.
Let us imagine a typical meal. The distin
guished guest has been announced (after all,
he is eating free) and has embarked on some
rather dangerous cocktail generalities about a
philosopher he but inadequately knows or
about teaching, a subject alien to many of those
who are paid to do it.

DRAMATIS PERSONAE:
Wretched Professor; Ketchumite; Nameless
Dispenser Of Wine; Supporting Ketchumite.
Wretched Professor: The point I was trying
to make was that . . .
Ketchumite: Your point was that you hadn't
understood my question.
W.P.: I understood your question perfectly,
but I merely . ..
K.: You understood it; do you still under
stand it?
W.P.: Well yes, obviously.
K.: Then could you repeat the question?
Nameless Dispenser Of Wine: Professor, can
I fill up your glass?
Supporting Ketchumite: Your ash, Professor,
it's dropped on your lap.
W.P.: So it has. Now where were we?
K.: We, Professor? You were busy rephrasing
the question.
W.P.: As a remember it, your question was
how can Identity presuppose the One.
K.: Actually I asked you first if you had for
mulated a philosophy of education.
W.P.: ( Wittily) A philosophy of education
or an education for philosophers?
Massed Ketchumites: •
N.D.W.: More wine, Professor?

S.K.: Your elbow's in your plate, Professor.
W.P.: Thanks; I thought we abandoned tha
inquiry and proceeded to the One in Hegel.
K.: Who abandons inquiries: the questione
or the answerer?
W.P.: Eh?
K.: Put another way: is it not the questione
who should direct dialectic?
W.P.: Yes, but I can't understand your ques
tions.
K.: A few moments ago you said you under
stood them perfectly.
S.K.: Yeah, 'perfectly.'
W.P.: But now I can't.
K.: Are you really listening to them?
W.P.: Sure I am.
K.: Then why can't you repeat them?
W.P.: The One in Hegel, nominalism it
Duns Scotus, Plato's myths, the role of the edu
cator, the role of the answerer; my head's spin

[Crash ]
S.K.: Professor, your head has fallen upoi

phistry and dialectic mingled under bent necks
and glimmering candles.
While textual criticism and the niceties of
academic scholarship are never the strong suit
of House members, their sense of philosophical
speculation and cultural history has become ex
tremely cogent with the chopping-stone disci
pline of three- to four-hour dinner sessions.
Some of the bogeys of student dialectic are
there: the quoted titles of unread volumes,
third-hand political gossip which is culled
mainly from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and Newsweek (though the lat
ter, like all the periodicals, they affect to read
only on the john) and above all an ultra-serious
attitude to those problems which the Victorian
educator disrespectfully dubbed "growing
pains."
Their capacity for life in the minor key is a
veritable masterwork. House members con
stantly schedule formal meetings with each oth
er, usually d deux. With bowed heads and state
ly gait they repair to a green patch on the front
lawn, a dimly lit sofa in the sitting-room or a
corner of the Kitchen Table.
Here are thrashed out the lynch-pins of exis
tence: their personal discussion style is a re
markable synthesis of pallid concern and ribald
sarcasm. A rigid and inscrutable system of de
fence mechanisms prevents the use of this style
with strangers: hence, presumably, the "could
you repeat my last question?" or the "define
what you mean by 'mean' please" and the fron
tal "I don't think you know what you're talking
about;" the latter gambit usually accompanied
by converging Ketchumite solidarity against
the opponent in extremis, a snicker that ripples
round, not a guffaw that explodes over, their
table.
The musical taste developed by a quite ex
traordinarily fine stereo system which the Mas
ter of the House has put at the disposal of all,
provided they "use their head, and a brand-new
needle, and treat it (not your head) with care,"

and a collection of 600 records that is uniformly
good. Their sense of the plastic arts is virtually
non-existent.
Three or four are members of the Air Force
R.0.T.C.; others explain that they have corrupt
or careless draft boards. I have only met one
person in or at the House who would be pre
pared to go to jail. None believe in the War,
but none do much to oppose it. It would not be
unfair to call Ketchum's atmosphere "apoliti
cal." When you surface from a thirty-hour
preparation of a reading from Plato's Republic
and then have to prove that most preceding in
terpretations of a passage from it were wrong,
you clearly feel inclined to say "rhubarb" to
Romney or "where?'' to Khe Sanh.
Such a tightly-knit and conservative group
could never find time for Radicalism; it is not
that they are above it—they are outside it. This
detachment from the currents of both the na
tion and the Campus has been fecund in its
own way: each summer for the past five years
Ketchum has been teaching beginning Greek,
and for the last three years the House has met
to read Plato, Aristotle or a pre-Socratic philos
opher in Greek, in three sessions a week
throughout the school year.
Also for the past five years there have been
seminars which met once a week for the whole
school year on one philosopher or even one
work. These have been:
1967-68: major dialogues of Plato.
1966-67: Hegel: Phenomenology, first
three chapters.
1965-66: major dialogues of Plato.
1964-65: Husserl: Ideas Towards a Pure
Phenomenology.
1963-64: Kant: First Critique; Hegel:
Phenomenology.
There have also been the following summer
seminars, which met five times a week:
1967: The Enlightenment; a study in
philosophy and cultural history.

1966: Windelband's History of Philoso
phy.
1965: Aristotle's Metaphysics in English;
Book X in Greek.
The house seminars presuppose hours of prepa
ration for each meeting and it has not been un
usual for the classes to contain regular com
muters from Berkeley and San Francisco.
The actual record of the House members is
interesting; NDEA's and graduate scholarships
are awarded to nearly 100% of the occupants.
At least two Ph.d.'s have been completed so far
and there are about eight non-resident Ph.d.
candidates scattered around the country from
Yale to Toronto.
But what this splendid concern has done,
and what Stanford has been totally oblivious
to its having done, is to produce the kind of
climate in which abstract and idealistic specu
lation could not only flourish but also entertain.
Ketchum has been engaged in an up-hill strug
gle against a university administration which
suspects his diversity.
It would be no exaggeration to say that the
toughest and most stimulating philosophy at
Stanford in the last few years has been done
chez Ketchum rather than at the North corner
of Stanford's quadrangle. A sad commentary on
this is the fact that the great majority of his
students cannot see their way to majoring in
their favorite subject. The crop of present ma
jors around the House is: German, Humanities,
German, Graduate at Large, Mathematics,
Philosophy, History, Psychology, Mathematics,
German, leave cf absence from Medical School,
History.
The House folds up in June because enough
is as good as a feast. Ketchum's patience with
the Ph.d. machine has run out as, presumably,
it has with him. When the organization of such
a House has been forgotten it is lucky that
Stanford, and not philosophy, will be the loser,
for: Nemo dat quod non lwbet.

Seminar participants make themselves quite comfortable for
the Monday night sessions which often last past midnight.
SCENE: A large square house at mid
night on a Sunday evening; squat, with violet
painted slats, with burning lights in all the
rooms, bunks silhouetted against the windows
of the second floor on Addison, a somber Sia
mese cat in one of those off Bryant. Little
movement is seen in the rooms; no curtains are
drawn; there is the tinkle of a somewhat mo
rose ukelele on the darkened steps leading un
to the porch. It is played by J., strumming and
singing, perched near two dilapidated bicycles
parked on the footpath.
Inside is the ground-floor sitting-room, scene
of ballet charades in black body-stocking, lo
cale for inner tingle of Drambuie, Grand Ar
magnac and Vins Superieurs, chamber for de
bate on Plato in English.
Next to the ground-floor sitting-room, ;m
-maculate and shabby, is "the Library." 2000
volumes from German to Psychology via Ethics
and Atlases, a collection of scholarly works
where the Norwegian Professor Folesdal [.vie]
prepared his Stanford lectures on Husserl be
cause he could not find the books he needed in
the Campus library.
The Library's annual budget is over $3000;
no glasses shall be placed on the table without
a wooden stand; ash shall be deposited in its
opportune receptacle; brooding and silence su
pervene. Occasionally detect a stifled footnote,
some introverted melancholic who needs a
soul-brother, but definitely no L.S.D., no
beards, marijuana or politics in "The House."
This is one hundredth fraction of the outer
facade of Jonathan Ketchum's duly constituted
off-campus residence for Stanford rejects, i.e.
those who, in their sophomore year, rejected
Stanford. Ketchum is by a similar definition a
Stanford reject. For eight years he struggled
with the phenomenology of German idealism,
with the towering abstractions of Hegel. In
vain; he leaves this summer with four of those
who surround him for Buffalo, New York, for
an academy built with his own money and his
non-Ph.d.
It is hard, despite the riir of maudlin intensity
whieh hangs over Ketchum's disciples, not to
admire them. For seven years the trickle of
thirteen students annually has kept the House
in business. It has a gross budget of $60,000 an
nually and loses only two Grand a year. Room
and board are at Stern Hall rates. Some of the
residents have done remodelling in lieu of fees,
while one student, now a music graduate at
Berkeley, built a two-manual harpsichord with
four sets of strings.
What Ketchum's invisible and articulate
leadership gives them is hard to define. In my
own experience as a Faculty member of Stan
ford I have rarely felt such tangible and con
centrated brooding. No illusion of eccentircity,
no fantasy of Hippie unconventionality dis
tracts their work and meditation. Their single
concession to sport is long distance running in
short trousers.
Ketchum's residents are those true intellec
tual conservatives: aristocrats of the desk; plu
tocrats of the pen. One has glimpsed figures
hunched over the same German paragraph of
the same Greek etymology for as long as it took
to draft a chapter in a summer thesis.
For Ketchum's guests at dinner the vast oval

table with its green felt covering can beeome a
harrowing sea of wine and scorn and losing
dialectic. Not a person in the House has the re
motest respect for a professor's intrinsic status.
An Assistant Professor I know can find little

is cut down with horizontal sneers. My own

vertical smiles.

guished guest has been announced (after all,

fence mechanisms prevents the use of this style
with strangers: hence, presumably, the "could
you repeat my last question?" or the "define
what you mean by 'mean' please" and the fron
tal "I don't think you know what you're talking
about;" the latter gambit usually accompanied
by converging Ketchumite solidarity against
the opponent in extremis, a snicker that ripples
round, not a guffaw that explodes over, their
table.
The musical taste developed by a quite ex
traordinarily fine stereo system which the Mas
ter of the House has put at the disposal of all,
provided they "use their head, and a brand-new
needle, and treat it (not your head) with care,"

and a collection of 600 records that is uniformly
good. Their sense of the plastic arts is virtually
non-existent.
Three or four are members of the Air Force
R.0.T.C.; others explain that they have corrupt
or careless draft boards. I have only met one
person in or at the House who would be pre
pared to go to jail. None believe in the War,
but none do much to oppose it. It would not be
unfair to call Ketchum's atmosphere "apoliti
cal." When you surface from a thirty-hour
preparation of a reading from Plato's Republic
and then have to prove that most preceding in
terpretations of a passage from it were wrong,
you clearly feel inclined to say "rhubarb" to
Romney or "where?'' to Khe Sanh.
Such a tightly-knit and conservative group
could never find time for Radicalism; it is not
that they are above it—they are outside it. This
detachment from the currents of both the na
tion and the Campus has been fecund in its
own way: each summer for the past five years
Ketchum has been teaching beginning Greek,
and for the last three years the House has met
to read Plato, Aristotle or a pre-Socratic philos
opher in Greek, in three sessions a week
throughout the school year.
Also for the past five years there have been
seminars which met once a week for the whole
school year on one philosopher or even one
work. These have been:
1967-68: major dialogues of Plato.
1966-67: Hegel: Phenomenology, first
three chapters.
1965-66: major dialogues of Plato.
1964-65: Husserl: Ideas Towards a Pure
Phenomenology.
1963-64: Kant: First Critique; Hegel:
Phenomenology.
There have also been the following summer
seminars, which met five times a week:
1967: The Enlightenment; a study in
philosophy and cultural history.

1966: Windelband's History of Philoso
phy.
1965: Aristotle's Metaphysics in English;
Book X in Greek.
The house seminars presuppose hours of prepa
ration for each meeting and it has not been un
usual for the classes to contain regular com
muters from Berkeley and San Francisco.
The actual record of the House members is
interesting; NDEA's and graduate scholarships
are awarded to nearly 100% of the occupants.
At least two Ph.d.'s have been completed so far
and there are about eight non-resident Ph.d.
candidates scattered around the country from
Yale to Toronto.
But what this splendid concern has done,
and what Stanford has been totally oblivious
to its having done, is to produce the kind of
climate in which abstract and idealistic specu
lation could not only flourish but also entertain.
Ketchum has been engaged in an up-hill strug
gle against a university administration which
suspects his diversity.
It would be no exaggeration to say that the
toughest and most stimulating philosophy at
Stanford in the last few years has been done
chez Ketchum rather than at the North corner
of Stanford's quadrangle. A sad commentary on
this is the fact that the great majority of his
students cannot see their way to majoring in
their favorite subject. The crop of present ma
jors around the House is: German, Humanities,
German, Graduate at Large, Mathematics,
Philosophy, History, Psychology, Mathematics,
German, leave cf absence from Medical School,
History.
The House folds up in June because enough
is as good as a feast. Ketchum's patience with
the Ph.d. machine has run out as, presumably,
it has with him. When the organization of such
a House has been forgotten it is lucky that
Stanford, and not philosophy, will be the loser,
for: Nemo dat quod non lwbet.

Seminar participants make themselves quite comfortable for
the Monday night sessions which often last past midnight.
SCENE: A large square house at mid
night on a Sunday evening; squat, with violet
painted slats, with burning lights in all the
rooms, bunks silhouetted against the windows
of the second floor on Addison, a somber Sia
mese cat in one of those off Bryant. Little
movement is seen in the rooms; no curtains are
drawn; there is the tinkle of a somewhat mo
rose ukelele on the darkened steps leading un
to the porch. It is played by J., strumming and
singing, perched near two dilapidated bicycles
parked on the footpath.
Inside is the ground-floor sitting-room, scene
of ballet charades in black body-stocking, lo
cale for inner tingle of Drambuie, Grand Ar
magnac and Vins Superieurs, chamber for de
bate on Plato in English.
Next to the ground-floor sitting-room, ;m
-maculate and shabby, is "the Library." 2000
volumes from German to Psychology via Ethics
and Atlases, a collection of scholarly works
where the Norwegian Professor Folesdal [.vie]
prepared his Stanford lectures on Husserl be
cause he could not find the books he needed in
the Campus library.
The Library's annual budget is over $3000;
no glasses shall be placed on the table without
a wooden stand; ash shall be deposited in its
opportune receptacle; brooding and silence su
pervene. Occasionally detect a stifled footnote,
some introverted melancholic who needs a
soul-brother, but definitely no L.S.D., no
beards, marijuana or politics in "The House."
This is one hundredth fraction of the outer
facade of Jonathan Ketchum's duly constituted
off-campus residence for Stanford rejects, i.e.
those who, in their sophomore year, rejected
Stanford. Ketchum is by a similar definition a
Stanford reject. For eight years he struggled
with the phenomenology of German idealism,
with the towering abstractions of Hegel. In
vain; he leaves this summer with four of those
who surround him for Buffalo, New York, for
an academy built with his own money and his
non-Ph.d.
It is hard, despite the riir of maudlin intensity
whieh hangs over Ketchum's disciples, not to
admire them. For seven years the trickle of
thirteen students annually has kept the House
in business. It has a gross budget of $60,000 an
nually and loses only two Grand a year. Room
and board are at Stern Hall rates. Some of the
residents have done remodelling in lieu of fees,
while one student, now a music graduate at
Berkeley, built a two-manual harpsichord with
four sets of strings.
What Ketchum's invisible and articulate
leadership gives them is hard to define. In my
own experience as a Faculty member of Stan
ford I have rarely felt such tangible and con
centrated brooding. No illusion of eccentircity,
no fantasy of Hippie unconventionality dis
tracts their work and meditation. Their single
concession to sport is long distance running in
short trousers.
Ketchum's residents are those true intellec
tual conservatives: aristocrats of the desk; plu
tocrats of the pen. One has glimpsed figures
hunched over the same German paragraph of
the same Greek etymology for as long as it took
to draft a chapter in a summer thesis.
For Ketchum's guests at dinner the vast oval

table with its green felt covering can beeome a
harrowing sea of wine and scorn and losing
dialectic. Not a person in the House has the re
motest respect for a professor's intrinsic status.
An Assistant Professor I know can find little
sympathy for his stammer. Teutonic dourness
is cut down with horizontal sneers. My own
brand of English empiricism is scythed with
vertical smiles.
Let us imagine a typical meal. The distin
guished guest has been announced (after all,
he is eating free) and has embarked on some
rather dangerous cocktail generalities about a
philosopher he but inadequately knows or
about teaching, a subject alien to many of those
who are paid to do it.

DRAMATIS PERSONAE:
Wretched Professor; Ketchumite; Nameless
Dispenser Of Wine; Supporting Ketchumite.
Wretched Professor: The point I was trying
to make was that . . .
Ketchumite: Your point was that you hadn't
understood my question.
W.P.: I understood your question perfectly,
but I merely . ..
K.: You understood it; do you still under
stand it?
W.P.: Well yes, obviously.
K.: Then could you repeat the question?
Nameless Dispenser Of Wine: Professor, can
I fill up your glass?
Supporting Ketchumite: Your ash, Professor,
it's dropped on your lap.
W.P.: So it has. Now where were we?
K.: We, Professor? You were busy rephrasing
the question.
W.P.: As a remember it, your question was
how can Identity presuppose the One.
K.: Actually I asked you first if you had for
mulated a philosophy of education.
W.P.: ( Wittily) A philosophy of education
or an education for philosophers?
Massed Ketchumites: •
N.D.W.: More wine, Professor?

S.K.: Your elbow's in your plate, Professor.
W.P.: Thanks; I thought we abandoned tha
inquiry and proceeded to the One in Hegel.
K.: Who abandons inquiries: the questione
or the answerer?
W.P.: Eh?
K.: Put another way: is it not the questione
who should direct dialectic?
W.P.: Yes, but I can't understand your ques
tions.
K.: A few moments ago you said you under
stood them perfectly.
S.K.: Yeah, 'perfectly.'
W.P.: But now I can't.
K.: Are you really listening to them?
W.P.: Sure I am.
K.: Then why can't you repeat them?
W.P.: The One in Hegel, nominalism it
Duns Scotus, Plato's myths, the role of the edu
cator, the role of the answerer; my head's spin
ning; I think I've eaten too much of your wine
[Crash ]
S.K.: Professor, your head has fallen upoi
your plate.
N.D.W.: Mrs. K , would your hus
band care for some more wine?

As often as not dinner ends in heavy silence
Picture the Professor snoring sonorously ove
his plate and fifteen people, with three or fou

pie tart mixed with cigarette ash and gobs o
intellectual saliva as music pours in from tin
opened doors of the sitting-room and Bach es
tablishes the virginity of Mary or Smetana re
defines the Danube.
When Ketchum himself is there for dinne
people stand behind their chairs until he give
the word. Then he serves, from trays preparei
by a distant Teutonic cook, with trusties glonl

has already served meat. W r hen Jon is gone

phistry and dialectic mingled under bent necks
and glimmering candles.
While textual criticism and the niceties of
academic scholarship are never the strong suit
of House members, their sense of philosophical
speculation and cultural history has become ex
tremely cogent with the chopping-stone disci
pline of three- to four-hour dinner sessions.
Some of the bogeys of student dialectic are
there: the quoted titles of unread volumes,
third-hand political gossip which is culled
mainly from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and Newsweek (though the lat
ter, like all the periodicals, they affect to read
only on the john) and above all an ultra-serious
attitude to those problems which the Victorian
educator disrespectfully dubbed "growing
pains."
Their capacity for life in the minor key is a
veritable masterwork. House members con
stantly schedule formal meetings with each oth
er, usually d deux. With bowed heads and state
ly gait they repair to a green patch on the front
lawn, a dimly lit sofa in the sitting-room or a
corner of the Kitchen Table.
Here are thrashed out the lynch-pins of exis
tence: their personal discussion style is a re
markable synthesis of pallid concern and ribald
sarcasm. A rigid and inscrutable system of de
fence mechanisms prevents the use of this style
with strangers: hence, presumably, the "could
you repeat my last question?" or the "define

cale for inner tingle of Drambuie, Grand Ar
magnac and Vins Superieurs, chamber for de
bate on Plato in English.
Next to the ground-floor sitting-room, ;m
-maculate and shabby, is "the Library." 2000
volumes from German to Psychology via Ethics
and Atlases, a collection of scholarly works
where the Norwegian Professor Folesdal [.vie]
prepared his Stanford lectures on Husserl be
cause he could not find the books he needed in
the Campus library.
The Library's annual budget is over $3000;
no glasses shall be placed on the table without
a wooden stand; ash shall be deposited in its
opportune receptacle; brooding and silence su
pervene. Occasionally detect a stifled footnote,
some introverted melancholic who needs a
soul-brother, but definitely no L.S.D., no
beards, marijuana or politics in "The House."
This is one hundredth fraction of the outer
facade of Jonathan Ketchum's duly constituted
off-campus residence for Stanford rejects, i.e.
those who, in their sophomore year, rejected
Stanford. Ketchum is by a similar definition a
Stanford reject. For eight years he struggled
with the phenomenology of German idealism,
with the towering abstractions of Hegel. In
vain; he leaves this summer with four of those
who surround him for Buffalo, New York, for
an academy built with his own money and his
non-Ph.d.
It is hard, despite the riir of maudlin intensity
whieh hangs over Ketchum's disciples, not to
admire them. For seven years the trickle of
thirteen students annually has kept the House
in business. It has a gross budget of $60,000 an
nually and loses only two Grand a year. Room
and board are at Stern Hall rates. Some of the
residents have done remodelling in lieu of fees,
while one student, now a music graduate at
Berkeley, built a two-manual harpsichord with
four sets of strings.
What Ketchum's invisible and articulate
leadership gives them is hard to define. In my
own experience as a Faculty member of Stan
ford I have rarely felt such tangible and con
centrated brooding. No illusion of eccentircity,
no fantasy of Hippie unconventionality dis
tracts their work and meditation. Their single
concession to sport is long distance running in
short trousers.
Ketchum's residents are those true intellec
tual conservatives: aristocrats of the desk; plu
tocrats of the pen. One has glimpsed figures
hunched over the same German paragraph of
the same Greek etymology for as long as it took
to draft a chapter in a summer thesis.
For Ketchum's guests at dinner the vast oval

table with its green felt covering can beeome a
harrowing sea of wine and scorn and losing
dialectic. Not a person in the House has the re
motest respect for a professor's intrinsic status.
An Assistant Professor I know can find little
sympathy for his stammer. Teutonic dourness
is cut down with horizontal sneers. My own
brand of English empiricism is scythed with
vertical smiles.
Let us imagine a typical meal. The distin
guished guest has been announced (after all,
he is eating free) and has embarked on some
rather dangerous cocktail generalities about a
philosopher he but inadequately knows or
about teaching, a subject alien to many of those
who are paid to do it.

DRAMATIS PERSONAE:
Wretched Professor; Ketchumite; Nameless
Dispenser Of Wine; Supporting Ketchumite.
Wretched Professor: The point I was trying
to make was that . . .
Ketchumite: Your point was that you hadn't

W.P.: I understood your question perfectly,
but I merely . ..
K.: You understood it; do you still under
stand it?
W.P.: Well yes, obviously.
K.: Then could you repeat the question?
Nameless Dispenser Of Wine: Professor, can
I fill up your glass?
Supporting Ketchumite: Your ash, Professor,
it's dropped on your lap.
W.P.: So it has. Now where were we?
K.: We, Professor? You were busy rephrasing
the question.
W.P.: As a remember it, your question was
how can Identity presuppose the One.
K.: Actually I asked you first if you had for
mulated a philosophy of education.
W.P.: ( Wittily) A philosophy of education
or an education for philosophers?
Massed Ketchumites: •

W.P.: Eh?
K.: Put another way: is it not the questione
who should direct dialectic?
W.P.: Yes, but I can't understand your ques

K.: A few moments ago you said you under

S.K.: Yeah, 'perfectly.'
W.P.: But now I can't.
K.: Are you really listening to them?
W.P.: Sure I am.
K.: Then why can't you repeat them?
W.P.: The One in Hegel, nominalism it
Duns Scotus, Plato's myths, the role of the edu

phistry and dialectic mingled under bent necks
and glimmering candles.
While textual criticism and the niceties of
academic scholarship are never the strong suit
of House members, their sense of philosophical
speculation and cultural history has become ex
tremely cogent with the chopping-stone disci
pline of three- to four-hour dinner sessions.
Some of the bogeys of student dialectic are
there: the quoted titles of unread volumes,
third-hand political gossip which is culled
mainly from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and Newsweek (though the lat
ter, like all the periodicals, they affect to read
only on the john) and above all an ultra-serious
attitude to those problems which the Victorian
educator disrespectfully dubbed "growing
pains."
Their capacity for life in the minor key is a
veritable masterwork. House members con
stantly schedule formal meetings with each oth
er, usually d deux. With bowed heads and state
ly gait they repair to a green patch on the front
lawn, a dimly lit sofa in the sitting-room or a
corner of the Kitchen Table.
Here are thrashed out the lynch-pins of exis
tence: their personal discussion style is a re
markable synthesis of pallid concern and ribald
sarcasm. A rigid and inscrutable system of de
fence mechanisms prevents the use of this style
with strangers: hence, presumably, the "could
you repeat my last question?" or the "define
what you mean by 'mean' please" and the fron
tal "I don't think you know what you're talking
about;" the latter gambit usually accompanied
by converging Ketchumite solidarity against
the opponent in extremis, a snicker that ripples
round, not a guffaw that explodes over, their
table.
The musical taste developed by a quite ex
traordinarily fine stereo system which the Mas
ter of the House has put at the disposal of all,
provided they "use their head, and a brand-new
needle, and treat it (not your head) with care,"

and a collection of 600 records that is uniformly
good. Their sense of the plastic arts is virtually
non-existent.
Three or four are members of the Air Force
R.0.T.C.; others explain that they have corrupt
or careless draft boards. I have only met one
person in or at the House who would be pre
pared to go to jail. None believe in the War,
but none do much to oppose it. It would not be
unfair to call Ketchum's atmosphere "apoliti
cal." When you surface from a thirty-hour
preparation of a reading from Plato's Republic
and then have to prove that most preceding in
terpretations of a passage from it were wrong,
you clearly feel inclined to say "rhubarb" to
Romney or "where?'' to Khe Sanh.
Such a tightly-knit and conservative group
could never find time for Radicalism; it is not
that they are above it—they are outside it. This
detachment from the currents of both the na
tion and the Campus has been fecund in its
own way: each summer for the past five years
Ketchum has been teaching beginning Greek,
and for the last three years the House has met
to read Plato, Aristotle or a pre-Socratic philos
opher in Greek, in three sessions a week
throughout the school year.
Also for the past five years there have been
seminars which met once a week for the whole
school year on one philosopher or even one
work. These have been:
1967-68: major dialogues of Plato.
1966-67: Hegel: Phenomenology, first
three chapters.
1965-66: major dialogues of Plato.
1964-65: Husserl: Ideas Towards a Pure
Phenomenology.
1963-64: Kant: First Critique; Hegel:
Phenomenology.
There have also been the following summer
seminars, which met five times a week:
1967: The Enlightenment; a study in
philosophy and cultural history.

1966: Windelband's History of Philoso
phy.
1965: Aristotle's Metaphysics in English;
Book X in Greek.
The house seminars presuppose hours of prepa
ration for each meeting and it has not been un
usual for the classes to contain regular com
muters from Berkeley and San Francisco.
The actual record of the House members is
interesting; NDEA's and graduate scholarships
are awarded to nearly 100% of the occupants.
At least two Ph.d.'s have been completed so far
and there are about eight non-resident Ph.d.
candidates scattered around the country from
Yale to Toronto.
But what this splendid concern has done,
and what Stanford has been totally oblivious
to its having done, is to produce the kind of
climate in which abstract and idealistic specu
lation could not only flourish but also entertain.
Ketchum has been engaged in an up-hill strug
gle against a university administration which
suspects his diversity.
It would be no exaggeration to say that the
toughest and most stimulating philosophy at
Stanford in the last few years has been done
chez Ketchum rather than at the North corner
of Stanford's quadrangle. A sad commentary on
this is the fact that the great majority of his
students cannot see their way to majoring in
their favorite subject. The crop of present ma
jors around the House is: German, Humanities,
German, Graduate at Large, Mathematics,
Philosophy, History, Psychology, Mathematics,
German, leave cf absence from Medical School,
History.
The House folds up in June because enough
is as good as a feast. Ketchum's patience with
the Ph.d. machine has run out as, presumably,
it has with him. When the organization of such
a House has been forgotten it is lucky that
Stanford, and not philosophy, will be the loser,
for: Nemo dat quod non lwbet.

Seminar participants make themselves quite comfortable for
the Monday night sessions which often last past midnight.
SCENE: A large square house at mid
night on a Sunday evening; squat, with violet
painted slats, with burning lights in all the
rooms, bunks silhouetted against the windows
of the second floor on Addison, a somber Sia
mese cat in one of those off Bryant. Little
movement is seen in the rooms; no curtains are
drawn; there is the tinkle of a somewhat mo
rose ukelele on the darkened steps leading un
to the porch. It is played by J., strumming and
singing, perched near two dilapidated bicycles
parked on the footpath.
Inside is the ground-floor sitting-room, scene
of ballet charades in black body-stocking, lo

As often as not dinner ends in heavy silence
Picture the Professor snoring sonorously ove
his plate and fifteen people, with three or fou
escorted females, sitting to prod at left-over ap
pie tart mixed with cigarette ash and gobs o
intellectual saliva as music pours in from tin
opened doors of the sitting-room and Bach es
tablishes the virginity of Mary or Smetana re
defines the Danube.
When Ketchum himself is there for dinne
people stand behind their chairs until he give
the word. Then he serves, from trays preparei
by a distant Teutonic cook, with trusties glonl
ing due portions of flora onto plates where h<
has already served meat. W r hen Jon is gone
however, dinner can be gloomy, diffuse; so

mad." (a former Stanford Dean of Women)

phistry and dialectic mingled under bent necks
and glimmering candles.
While textual criticism and the niceties of
academic scholarship are never the strong suit
of House members, their sense of philosophical
speculation and cultural history has become ex
tremely cogent with the chopping-stone disci
pline of three- to four-hour dinner sessions.
Some of the bogeys of student dialectic are
there: the quoted titles of unread volumes,
third-hand political gossip which is culled
mainly from the New York Times, the Wall
Street Journal and Newsweek (though the lat
ter, like all the periodicals, they affect to read
only on the john) and above all an ultra-serious
attitude to those problems which the Victorian
educator disrespectfully dubbed "growing
pains."
Their capacity for life in the minor key is a
veritable masterwork. House members con
stantly schedule formal meetings with each oth
er, usually d deux. With bowed heads and state
ly gait they repair to a green patch on the front
lawn, a dimly lit sofa in the sitting-room or a
corner of the Kitchen Table.
Here are thrashed out the lynch-pins of exis
tence: their personal discussion style is a re
markable synthesis of pallid concern and ribald
sarcasm. A rigid and inscrutable system of de
fence mechanisms prevents the use of this style
with strangers: hence, presumably, the "could
you repeat my last question?" or the "define
what you mean by 'mean' please" and the fron
tal "I don't think you know what you're talking
about;" the latter gambit usually accompanied
by converging Ketchumite solidarity against
the opponent in extremis, a snicker that ripples
round, not a guffaw that explodes over, their
table.
The musical taste developed by a quite ex
traordinarily fine stereo system which the Mas
ter of the House has put at the disposal of all,
provided they "use their head, and a brand-new
needle, and treat it (not your head) with care,"

and a collection of 600 records that is uniformly
good. Their sense of the plastic arts is virtually
non-existent.
Three or four are members of the Air Force
R.0.T.C.; others explain that they have corrupt
or careless draft boards. I have only met one
person in or at the House who would be pre
pared to go to jail. None believe in the War,
but none do much to oppose it. It would not be
unfair to call Ketchum's atmosphere "apoliti
cal." When you surface from a thirty-hour
preparation of a reading from Plato's Republic
and then have to prove that most preceding in
terpretations of a passage from it were wrong,
you clearly feel inclined to say "rhubarb" to
Romney or "where?'' to Khe Sanh.
Such a tightly-knit and conservative group
could never find time for Radicalism; it is not
that they are above it—they are outside it. This
detachment from the currents of both the na
tion and the Campus has been fecund in its
own way: each summer for the past five years
Ketchum has been teaching beginning Greek,
and for the last three years the House has met
to read Plato, Aristotle or a pre-Socratic philos
opher in Greek, in three sessions a week
throughout the school year.
Also for the past five years there have been
seminars which met once a week for the whole
school year on one philosopher or even one
work. These have been:
1967-68: major dialogues of Plato.
1966-67: Hegel: Phenomenology, first
three chapters.
1965-66: major dialogues of Plato.
1964-65: Husserl: Ideas Towards a Pure
Phenomenology.
1963-64: Kant: First Critique; Hegel:
Phenomenology.
There have also been the following summer
seminars, which met five times a week:
1967: The Enlightenment; a study in
philosophy and cultural history.

1966: Windelband's History of Philoso
phy.
1965: Aristotle's Metaphysics in English;
Book X in Greek.
The house seminars presuppose hours of prepa
ration for each meeting and it has not been un
usual for the classes to contain regular com
muters from Berkeley and San Francisco.
The actual record of the House members is
interesting; NDEA's and graduate scholarships
are awarded to nearly 100% of the occupants.
At least two Ph.d.'s have been completed so far
and there are about eight non-resident Ph.d.
candidates scattered around the country from
Yale to Toronto.
But what this splendid concern has done,
and what Stanford has been totally oblivious
to its having done, is to produce the kind of
climate in which abstract and idealistic specu
lation could not only flourish but also entertain.
Ketchum has been engaged in an up-hill strug
gle against a university administration which
suspects his diversity.
It would be no exaggeration to say that the
toughest and most stimulating philosophy at
Stanford in the last few years has been done
chez Ketchum rather than at the North corner
of Stanford's quadrangle. A sad commentary on
this is the fact that the great majority of his
students cannot see their way to majoring in
their favorite subject. The crop of present ma
jors around the House is: German, Humanities,
German, Graduate at Large, Mathematics,
Philosophy, History, Psychology, Mathematics,
German, leave cf absence from Medical School,
History.
The House folds up in June because enough
is as good as a feast. Ketchum's patience with
the Ph.d. machine has run out as, presumably,
it has with him. When the organization of such
a House has been forgotten it is lucky that
Stanford, and not philosophy, will be the loser,
for: Nemo dat quod non lwbet.

Seminar participants make themselves quite comfortable for
the Monday night sessions which often last past midnight.
