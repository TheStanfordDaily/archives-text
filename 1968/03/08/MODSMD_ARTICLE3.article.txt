"I woud tell him he should go ahead with
the normal course of his life. It's the only ra
tional thing to do in this kind of world."
Advice to a Stanford Senior
February 16, 1968

THE fatherly tone of these remarks made
in the light of the new Selective Service
policy is not enough to conceal a pa
thetic commentary on Stanford University, and
most universities in America. Dean Whitaker,
in this quote attributed to him by The Daily
and perhaps not representative of his entire
position, has captured the voice of intellectuals
who have resigned from the world. This resig
nation, cloaked in the kindliness of fatherhood,
is the actuality of impotence which results from
the well-reasoned attempts to ignore the con
tradictions which make the utterance and ac
ceptance of the statement possible. That voice
speaks to all of us, father and child, learned
and learner.
To examine this remark is a helpful way of
beginning to understand the sad sight of "both
ered and troubled" administrators, whose "un
easiness grew with every day that passed," try
ing to frame a University statement on drug
abuse (about three years after abuse first
began) because of "the incident at Stony
Brook." It may even help us see why adminis
trators and students alike began acting like
alarmed mother hens when an attempt at
greater equity in the draft policy interrupted
their secure little lives. It may allow us to see
why, despite all of the skills and powers of
prediction which we seek to develop here at
Stanford, we are passive, reactive agents, ap
parently incapable of initiating events in the
world. By drawing out the implications of the
Dean's timely advice, we can start to under
stand how it is we contribute to the creation
and maintenance of the conditions which make
this advice necessary.
WHAT indeed can a "normal course"
be? If it is the "only rational thing
to do in this kind of world," are we
not being asked to live normally in an abnormal
world? Isn't the proffered advice suggesting
that we act rationally in an irrational world?
Or at least, "in this kind of world," a world that
is not as we would have it? To paraphrase, we
are supposed to go ahead with business as

usual, though the world's business is most un
usual. Or in the words of the pragmatic realist
(circa 1968): "Of course this is an imperfect
world. But that is no excuse to abandon rea
son."
On the face of it, this admonition makes good
sense and is logically consistent. However, this
warning (and the above quote) are exam
ples of functional rationalization, i.e., they
have no substance. They serve to partially ac
count for the world and to enable the believer
to continue his existence. The rationality of the
statement serves the speaker. Substantively
speaking, the fact of the imperfect world and
its relationship to the use of reason, and the
combination of these two upon the speaker, is
ignored. Functional rationalization allows for
the necessary perpetuation of "this kind of
world," though, it is thought, that is what we
seek to change. Now why is this so?
To begin with, once the contradictions be
tween normal and abnormal are buried in our
minds, the critical imagination of the mind is
lost to the world. When the life of the college
dean and the graduating senior presumes its
own rationality, the life of the Selective Service
and the non-academic world of presumed irra
tionality is obviated. With this act the promise
of tension, the force of dialectics is lost to illu
sory personal resolution or mindless polariza
tion.
This is more than the bifurcation of thought
from action. It is to think and to reason from
the I-me (rational) frame of reference only
after the world, the irrational have been dis
missed a priori. To presume one's world abnor
mal and at the same time to declare the ration
ality of one's existence is to perform the mental
act that effectively removes one from any place
in that world. But more important is the fact
that such a stance causes one to forfeit the vis
ion necessary to act on such differences that
exist in the world. To close off our lives allows
for private sanity, perhaps, but little else.
(Here, a new question arises. Should the result
of closing off one's life really be described as
"sanity"?)
THE above remarks should not be con
strued as a critique of reason or objec
tivity. What I have tried to describe is
a phenomenon of entirely new dimensions.
While the distance between one's self and one's
world may be called objectivity and an ex
ample of reason, the establishment of catego
ries at the boundaries of this distance is not
objectivity. Whein the observer presumes him
self to be normal and the observed is termed
abnormal, we have a process quite unlike ob
jectivity. (Though the indoctrination of objec
tivity in the classroom undoubtedly makes the
sidestep to resignation through functional ra
tionalization much easier.)
To understand this phenomenon let us ex
amine our lives here at Stanford and explain
how each of us is capable of making and ac
cepting Whitaker's statement. Only then can
it be shown that our capacity for that is symp
tomatic of the causes for the existence of "this
kind of world." For the purpose of explication
I think it is necessaiy to separate Stanford into
two groups (a not altogether satisfying sugges
tion, but one that is recognized and encouraged
by all): the learners and the learned.
As learner, the student at Stanford goes

through some kind of horizontal development
that may be sketched roughly as follows: Com
munity Initiation (new teachers, books, ideas),
Involvement (picketing, petitions, voting, com
mittee work, tutoring, striking, etc.), Frustra
tion, Desperation, Impotence. It is also likely
that at some time in this process the learner ex
periments with drugs and love making. Never
theless, somewhere between entrance and exit,
the learner in this community terminates his
development in the formalization of a personal
normal-abnormal ethic privatism. That is, he
or she makes the conscious decision that de
spite the absurdity and unchangeability of the
world, he or she endeavor to live a rational,
meaningful, good personal life. The world is
rejected and the self is preserved into a Tarzan
like, "Me rational/it irrational" existence. At
that point we join with Dean Whitaker in the
ability to make his statement.
It is more difficult to perceive and under
stand what happens to the learned among us
since we are really not one of them. But since
my program advisers tell me I am soon to be
a learned, perhaps I can attempt a description.
There is a basic difference between learners
and the learned which makes the process of
resignation among the learned more difficult
to identify. That difference is that we (the
learners) have no responsibilities or a public
life. This allows for our retreat from the ir
rational into impotence to go undisguised,
though not unnoticed.
The learned, on the other hand, have both
formal responsibilities and public affairs which
demand of them an accounting, an effort, a
putting forth, if you will, to prove that they
have not resigned. It is in the University com
munity, however, that men of responsibility
and public affairs can best perform the same
mental act as we do and yet have it go unno
ticed. This is because the nature of the Uni
versity and their own thought within it, pro
vides them with a well developed disguise.
Thus, while both learner and learned think in
identical ways, the dissimilarities occur when
our teachers and administrators choose to ig
nore or turn away from what it is they do with
their minds in relation to their responsibilities
and public life. And that difference is truly im
portant, for the reasoned acknowledgment and
acceptance of the abnormal and irrational is
more perverse when that person who so reasons
remains in and of the world.
(This is to suggest that there is little real
support for the learners' self-righteous con
tempt for the learned when in fact the only real
difference between them is that the learned
are supposed to be in and of the world. The
fact that most of us do the same things witli
our minds, at least within the university, may
be a more useful way of explaining that 90 per
cent of us plan to go on to some sort of gradu
ate school, where we can continue the process
and be rewarded for it.)
The criticism of the learned needs to be de
tailed. Trying again to avoid confusion be
tween the problems of objectivity and the phe
nomenon I am considering, allow me to say
that the notion of a controlled situation, which
is central to objective research, presumes the
existence of an uncontrolled situation, which is
not at all central to research. This emphasis on
the controlled situation in the face of a much
larger and more complex uncontrolled situa
