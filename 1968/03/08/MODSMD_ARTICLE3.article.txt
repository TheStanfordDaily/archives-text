"I woud tell him he should go ahead with
the normal course of his life. It's the only ra
tional thing to do in this kind of world."
Advice to a Stanford Senior
February 16, 1968

THE fatherly tone of these remarks made
in the light of the new Selective Service
policy is not enough to conceal a pa
thetic commentary on Stanford University, and
most universities in America. Dean Whitaker,
in this quote attributed to him by The Daily
and perhaps not representative of his entire
position, has captured the voice of intellectuals
who have resigned from the world. This resig
nation, cloaked in the kindliness of fatherhood,
is the actuality of impotence which results from
the well-reasoned attempts to ignore the con
tradictions which make the utterance and ac
ceptance of the statement possible. That voice
speaks to all of us, father and child, learned
and learner.
To examine this remark is a helpful way of
beginning to understand the sad sight of "both
ered and troubled" administrators, whose "un
easiness grew with every day that passed," try
ing to frame a University statement on drug
abuse (about three years after abuse first
began) because of "the incident at Stony
Brook." It may even help us see why adminis
trators and students alike began acting like
alarmed mother hens when an attempt at
greater equity in the draft policy interrupted
their secure little lives. It may allow us to see
why, despite all of the skills and powers of
prediction which we seek to develop here at
Stanford, we are passive, reactive agents, ap
parently incapable of initiating events in the
world. By drawing out the implications of the
Dean's timely advice, we can start to under
stand how it is we contribute to the creation
and maintenance of the conditions which make
this advice necessary.
WHAT indeed can a "normal course"
be? If it is the "only rational thing
to do in this kind of world," are we
not being asked to live normally in an abnormal
world? Isn't the proffered advice suggesting
that we act rationally in an irrational world?
Or at least, "in this kind of world," a world that
is not as we would have it? To paraphrase, we
are supposed to go ahead with business as

usual, though the world's business is most un
usual. Or in the words of the pragmatic realist
(circa 1968): "Of course this is an imperfect
world. But that is no excuse to abandon rea
son."
On the face of it, this admonition makes good
sense and is logically consistent. However, this
warning (and the above quote) are exam
ples of functional rationalization, i.e., they
have no substance. They serve to partially ac
count for the world and to enable the believer
to continue his existence. The rationality of the
statement serves the speaker. Substantively
speaking, the fact of the imperfect world and
its relationship to the use of reason, and the
combination of these two upon the speaker, is
ignored. Functional rationalization allows for
the necessary perpetuation of "this kind of
world," though, it is thought, that is what we
seek to change. Now why is this so?
To begin with, once the contradictions be
tween normal and abnormal are buried in our
minds, the critical imagination of the mind is
lost to the world. When the life of the college
dean and the graduating senior presumes its
own rationality, the life of the Selective Service
and the non-academic world of presumed irra
tionality is obviated. With this act the promise
of tension, the force of dialectics is lost to illu
sory personal resolution or mindless polariza
tion.
This is more than the bifurcation of thought
from action. It is to think and to reason from
the I-me (rational) frame of reference only
after the world, the irrational have been dis
missed a priori. To presume one's world abnor
mal and at the same time to declare the ration
ality of one's existence is to perform the mental
act that effectively removes one from any place
in that world. But more important is the fact
that such a stance causes one to forfeit the vis
ion necessary to act on such differences that
exist in the world. To close off our lives allows
for private sanity, perhaps, but little else.
(Here, a new question arises. Should the result
of closing off one's life really be described as
"sanity"?)
THE above remarks should not be con
strued as a critique of reason or objec
tivity. What I have tried to describe is
a phenomenon of entirely new dimensions.
While the distance between one's self and one's
world may be called objectivity and an ex
ample of reason, the establishment of catego
ries at the boundaries of this distance is not
objectivity. Whein the observer presumes him
self to be normal and the observed is termed
abnormal, we have a process quite unlike ob
jectivity. (Though the indoctrination of objec
tivity in the classroom undoubtedly makes the
sidestep to resignation through functional ra
tionalization much easier.)
To understand this phenomenon let us ex
amine our lives here at Stanford and explain
how each of us is capable of making and ac
cepting Whitaker's statement. Only then can
it be shown that our capacity for that is symp
tomatic of the causes for the existence of "this
kind of world." For the purpose of explication
I think it is necessaiy to separate Stanford into
two groups (a not altogether satisfying sugges
tion, but one that is recognized and encouraged
by all): the learners and the learned.
As learner, the student at Stanford goes

through some kind of horizontal development
that may be sketched roughly as follows: Com
munity Initiation (new teachers, books, ideas),
Involvement (picketing, petitions, voting, com
mittee work, tutoring, striking, etc.), Frustra
tion, Desperation, Impotence. It is also likely
that at some time in this process the learner ex
periments with drugs and love making. Never
theless, somewhere between entrance and exit,
the learner in this community terminates his
development in the formalization of a personal
normal-abnormal ethic privatism. That is, he
or she makes the conscious decision that de
spite the absurdity and unchangeability of the
world, he or she endeavor to live a rational,
meaningful, good personal life. The world is
rejected and the self is preserved into a Tarzan
like, "Me rational/it irrational" existence. At
that point we join with Dean Whitaker in the
ability to make his statement.
It is more difficult to perceive and under
stand what happens to the learned among us
since we are really not one of them. But since
my program advisers tell me I am soon to be
a learned, perhaps I can attempt a description.
There is a basic difference between learners
and the learned which makes the process of
resignation among the learned more difficult
to identify. That difference is that we (the
learners) have no responsibilities or a public
life. This allows for our retreat from the ir
rational into impotence to go undisguised,
though not unnoticed.
The learned, on the other hand, have both
formal responsibilities and public affairs which
demand of them an accounting, an effort, a
putting forth, if you will, to prove that they
have not resigned. It is in the University com
munity, however, that men of responsibility
and public affairs can best perform the same
mental act as we do and yet have it go unno
ticed. This is because the nature of the Uni
versity and their own thought within it, pro
vides them with a well developed disguise.
Thus, while both learner and learned think in
identical ways, the dissimilarities occur when
our teachers and administrators choose to ig
nore or turn away from what it is they do with
their minds in relation to their responsibilities
and public life. And that difference is truly im
portant, for the reasoned acknowledgment and
acceptance of the abnormal and irrational is
more perverse when that person who so reasons
remains in and of the world.
(This is to suggest that there is little real
support for the learners' self-righteous con
tempt for the learned when in fact the only real
difference between them is that the learned
are supposed to be in and of the world. The
fact that most of us do the same things witli
our minds, at least within the university, may
be a more useful way of explaining that 90 per
cent of us plan to go on to some sort of gradu
ate school, where we can continue the process
and be rewarded for it.)
The criticism of the learned needs to be de
tailed. Trying again to avoid confusion be
tween the problems of objectivity and the phe
nomenon I am considering, allow me to say
that the notion of a controlled situation, which
is central to objective research, presumes the
existence of an uncontrolled situation, which is
not at all central to research. This emphasis on
the controlled situation in the face of a much
larger and more complex uncontrolled situa

and teaches freshman English.
tion, also may be understood as a desire to
work with {he rational as opposed to the irra
tional. In any case, it serves as an effective
excuse for not making the uncontrolled central
to one's life as a learned.
In the larger context of the community of
the learned, however, it is less difficult to cite
examples how the learned attempt to do the
rational thing in this kind of world, how they
separate the controlled from the uncontrolled,
how they join with Dean Whitaker in disguised
resignation. When CIA interviewers visit the
campus and protest seems imminent, our fac
ulty and administration implore us to uphold
freedom of speech on the basis of reason. But
the concept of free speech becomes the sub
stitute for reason, it precludes any further use
of reason, and silence prevails. Those who pro
test disruptively are tried on the basis of legal
isms and the logic of jurisprudence. 1 The moral
arguments pass by the legalistic arguments and
both learners and learned ignore each other.
And then, when the student Judicial Council
attempts to bring a halt to this pathetic non
dialogue, this gigantic irrelevancy, the admin
istration responds with concern that law has
been suspended in the campus community.
Our teachers have lost the ability to see
themselves in relation to this world, just as most
of us have. But the implications are so much
greater when they demonstrate this inability.
Harvard, Oberlin, and almost every college in
the Bay Area which has experienced disruption
due to the war or the condition of the black
man in America, have seen fit to take time off
from business as usual to discuss these complex
issues as an entire community. On this campus
there are students and administrators who have
been trying since November to get major mem
bers of the faculty and administration to sit
down for just one evening and discuss the prob
lem of CIA recruitment on campus and they
have never been able to arrange a time 'con
venient for everyone." (If you believe this issue
has been resolved, see The New Republic

article by Henry Commager reprinted on
page 2.)
As crises arise and groups become more and
more polarized, the university administration
continues to maintain itself by hurling one or
two persons with some sort of charisma into
the breach of conflict in the hope of preserving
business as usual. These individuals should not
be expected to solve all of the problems we
have created and chosen to ignore. To station
an Associate Dean of Students between an
anti-war street troupe and the Army ROTC
cadets standing at attention on a soccer field is
not a parody on the theatre of absurd. Nor
should it be construed as any way to run a uni
versity. It just happens to be the result of in
stitutionalized resignation, where Johnny-on
the-spot replaces the man of thought.
THE way in which we now think seeks to
place a wall between us and the 'world.
There is, however, a leak in that wall
and a well chosen thumb here or there is not
going to keep out "this kind of world.' We must
begin to scale that wall to see what is on the
other side. The invocation of university policy
regardless of its relevance and the use of charis
matic figures and student police to prevent dis
ruption are the most obvious signs that our
teachers have given up. They join those of us
who have lost even the energy to force air
across our vocal cords to whisper "Stop."
What will it mean for Stanford to climb that
wall? We must begin by acknowledging the
wall as a creation of our minds, an illusory
mentalistic barrier that has become normative
and prescriptive. Only after this recognition is
made is it possible to escape the contradictions
which necessarily flow from that mental act.
Once the wall is removed, the easy distinc
tions we have made for classifying and cate
gorizing and the operational definitions we
have set up for description and prediction
begin to appear meaningless. What do rational,
irrational, normal, and abnormal mean? Is set
ting fire to the NROTC shack an irrational act
in an irrational world? Or is it a gratuitous act
by men who defy simple either/or classifica
tions? Is the fact that American colleges and
universities were able to operate without inter
ruption during the Vietnam War until the draft
policy was changed (to a policy which is more
equitable, incidentally) a rational fact in an
irrational world? (There are ironic similarities
in that statement and the following: "Under
Mussolini, the trains ran on time in Italy." To
counter with the charge that we have had pro
test and demonstration on the campus is like
an Italian citizen saying, "My train from Flor
ence arrived thirteen minutes late in Rome on
Dec. 18, 1939.")

Or more pointedly, what does rational mean
when you impute that attribute to the thought:
"I should plan a normal course of life in this
kind of world."
Phenomenologically speaking, when that
wall and the concomitant mentalistic functions
which are necessary for its maintenance are re
moved, we are faced with understanding a new
world. Some of our popular products of analo
gous reasoning would break down and leave
us rather helpless in the path of uncompromis
ing data that cannot be bent to fit our view of
the world. This is what Marcuse calls the "re
opening of discourse.' And were that discourse
to occur, would the effects be any more calami
tous than those experienced by the universities
when they became partners with the govern
ment in the race to the moon? Or those felt
when graduate students were threatened with
the draft? Or those caused by recent federal
budget cuts? Or those effects that can be traced
to the introduction of drugs on campus?
Yet, none of the above events, which caused
the university so much anxiety, were put into
motion by the university. We could only react
for we have lost the ability to initiate events in
the world. This is because we have resigned
from the world.
Still, I believe a majority of students on this
campus would join with leadership from the
soon to be organized Academic Senate in a
mutual endeavor to climb that wall we have all
helped to build. I believe these students feel
there is something more valuable for this uni
versity than a two-year study of itself. I cannot
say whether there are faculty members who are
prepared to demonstrate that there may be
something more important to them than their
research or promotion or attempts to keep up
the facade of business as usual.
In any case, I would hope that it is still pos
sible to conceive of breaking our inane lock
step march to privatism and self-indulgent im
potence. Could the university set up a program
under which the student body, instead of play
ing in the ruins of European castles, would
have the option of working in the streets and
factories and corporations and government of
America? Isn't it time we admit that Stanford
Away is more important than Stanford Abroad?
Are there professors who would join us and
be willing to examine our responsibilities (and
their own) rather than the "context of our re
sponsibilities."
Are there no members of the faculty who
would be willing to stop their work and con
sider the implications of the university as an
employment agency? (Of course this would re
quire students to reassess their own motives
for obtaining a Stanford degree.) Or are we
content to suspend classes and business as
usual just for Washington's Birthday, President
Sterling's annual address, and the visits of
people like Hubert Humphrey?
The time has come when we need to tell our
administration that it is banal to travel through
the country telling our friends and alumni that
the Stanford ship, though in troubled waters,
is still steaming. And stop trying to explain the
rough going by accusing the far left and far
right. The glibness of that explanation allows
you to focus on the strength of the ship and
appeal to everyone to come aboard.
The point is that Stanford has resigned from
the rough waters by convincing itself that it has
built a sturdy ship. That allows the captain and
crew to remain insulated from the water and
they never look at it again in quite the same
way. "The only normal thing to do when the
seas get rough is to build a sturdy ship and
keep it steaming." Unfortunately, a strong ship
has nothing to do with the nature of the water
in which it steams. It just makes the people on
board feel more secure.

In any case, I would hope that it is still pos
sible to conceive of breaking our inane lock
step march to privatism and self-indulgent im
potence. Could the university set up a program
under which the student body, instead of play
ing in the ruins of European castles, would
have the option of working in the streets and
factories and corporations and government of
America? Isn't it time we admit that Stanford
Away is more important than Stanford Abroad?
Are there professors who would join us and
be willing to examine our responsibilities (and
their own) rather than the "context of our re
sponsibilities."
Are there no members of the faculty who
would be willing to stop their work and con
sider the implications of the university as an
employment agency? (Of course this would re
quire students to reassess their own motives
for obtaining a Stanford degree.) Or are we
content to suspend classes and business as
usual just for Washington's Birthday, President
Sterling's annual address, and the visits of
people like Hubert Humphrey?
The time has come when we need to tell our
administration that it is banal to travel through
the country telling our friends and alumni that
the Stanford ship, though in troubled waters,
is still steaming. And stop trying to explain the
rough going by accusing the far left and far
right. The glibness of that explanation allows
you to focus on the strength of the ship and
appeal to everyone to come aboard.
The point is that Stanford has resigned from
the rough waters by convincing itself that it has
built a sturdy ship. That allows the captain and
crew to remain insulated from the water and
they never look at it again in quite the same
way. "The only normal thing to do when the
seas get rough is to build a sturdy ship and
keep it steaming." Unfortunately, a strong ship
has nothing to do with the nature of the water
in which it steams. It just makes the people on
board feel more secure.


"To station an Associate Dean of Students between an anti-war troupe
and army ROTC cadets ... is not a parody on the theater of absurd."
"I woud tell him he should go ahead with
the normal course of his life. It's the only ra
tional thing to do in this kind of world."
Advice to a Stanford Senior
February 16, 1968

THE fatherly tone of these remarks made
in the light of the new Selective Service
policy is not enough to conceal a pa
thetic commentary on Stanford University, and
most universities in America. Dean Whitaker,
in this quote attributed to him by The Daily
and perhaps not representative of his entire
position, has captured the voice of intellectuals
who have resigned from the world. This resig
nation, cloaked in the kindliness of fatherhood,
is the actuality of impotence which results from
the well-reasoned attempts to ignore the con
tradictions which make the utterance and ac
ceptance of the statement possible. That voice
speaks to all of us, father and child, learned
and learner.
To examine this remark is a helpful way of
beginning to understand the sad sight of "both
ered and troubled" administrators, whose "un
easiness grew with every day that passed," try
ing to frame a University statement on drug
abuse (about three years after abuse first
began) because of "the incident at Stony
Brook." It may even help us see why adminis
trators and students alike began acting like
alarmed mother hens when an attempt at
greater equity in the draft policy interrupted
their secure little lives. It may allow us to see
why, despite all of the skills and powers of
prediction which we seek to develop here at
Stanford, we are passive, reactive agents, ap
parently incapable of initiating events in the
world. By drawing out the implications of the
Dean's timely advice, we can start to under
stand how it is we contribute to the creation
and maintenance of the conditions which make
this advice necessary.
WHAT indeed can a "normal course"
be? If it is the "only rational thing
to do in this kind of world," are we
not being asked to live normally in an abnormal
world? Isn't the proffered advice suggesting
that we act rationally in an irrational world?
Or at least, "in this kind of world," a world that
is not as we would have it? To paraphrase, we
are supposed to go ahead with business as

usual, though the world's business is most un
usual. Or in the words of the pragmatic realist
(circa 1968): "Of course this is an imperfect
world. But that is no excuse to abandon rea
son."
On the face of it, this admonition makes good
sense and is logically consistent. However, this
warning (and the above quote) are exam
ples of functional rationalization, i.e., they
have no substance. They serve to partially ac
count for the world and to enable the believer
to continue his existence. The rationality of the
statement serves the speaker. Substantively
speaking, the fact of the imperfect world and
its relationship to the use of reason, and the
combination of these two upon the speaker, is
ignored. Functional rationalization allows for
the necessary perpetuation of "this kind of
world," though, it is thought, that is what we
seek to change. Now why is this so?
To begin with, once the contradictions be
tween normal and abnormal are buried in our
minds, the critical imagination of the mind is
lost to the world. When the life of the college
dean and the graduating senior presumes its
own rationality, the life of the Selective Service
and the non-academic world of presumed irra
tionality is obviated. With this act the promise
of tension, the force of dialectics is lost to illu
sory personal resolution or mindless polariza
tion.
This is more than the bifurcation of thought
from action. It is to think and to reason from
the I-me (rational) frame of reference only
after the world, the irrational have been dis
missed a priori. To presume one's world abnor
mal and at the same time to declare the ration
ality of one's existence is to perform the mental
act that effectively removes one from any place
in that world. But more important is the fact
that such a stance causes one to forfeit the vis
ion necessary to act on such differences that
exist in the world. To close off our lives allows
for private sanity, perhaps, but little else.
(Here, a new question arises. Should the result
of closing off one's life really be described as
"sanity"?)
THE above remarks should not be con
strued as a critique of reason or objec
tivity. What I have tried to describe is
a phenomenon of entirely new dimensions.
While the distance between one's self and one's
world may be called objectivity and an ex
ample of reason, the establishment of catego
ries at the boundaries of this distance is not
objectivity. Whein the observer presumes him
self to be normal and the observed is termed
abnormal, we have a process quite unlike ob
jectivity. (Though the indoctrination of objec
tivity in the classroom undoubtedly makes the
sidestep to resignation through functional ra
tionalization much easier.)
To understand this phenomenon let us ex
amine our lives here at Stanford and explain
how each of us is capable of making and ac
cepting Whitaker's statement. Only then can
it be shown that our capacity for that is symp
tomatic of the causes for the existence of "this
kind of world." For the purpose of explication
I think it is necessaiy to separate Stanford into
two groups (a not altogether satisfying sugges
tion, but one that is recognized and encouraged
by all): the learners and the learned.
As learner, the student at Stanford goes

through some kind of horizontal development
that may be sketched roughly as follows: Com
munity Initiation (new teachers, books, ideas),
Involvement (picketing, petitions, voting, com
mittee work, tutoring, striking, etc.), Frustra
tion, Desperation, Impotence. It is also likely
that at some time in this process the learner ex
periments with drugs and love making. Never
theless, somewhere between entrance and exit,
the learner in this community terminates his
development in the formalization of a personal
normal-abnormal ethic privatism. That is, he
or she makes the conscious decision that de
spite the absurdity and unchangeability of the
world, he or she endeavor to live a rational,
meaningful, good personal life. The world is
rejected and the self is preserved into a Tarzan
like, "Me rational/it irrational" existence. At
that point we join with Dean Whitaker in the
ability to make his statement.
It is more difficult to perceive and under
stand what happens to the learned among us
since we are really not one of them. But since
my program advisers tell me I am soon to be
a learned, perhaps I can attempt a description.
There is a basic difference between learners
and the learned which makes the process of
resignation among the learned more difficult
to identify. That difference is that we (the
learners) have no responsibilities or a public
life. This allows for our retreat from the ir
rational into impotence to go undisguised,
though not unnoticed.
The learned, on the other hand, have both
formal responsibilities and public affairs which
demand of them an accounting, an effort, a
putting forth, if you will, to prove that they
have not resigned. It is in the University com
munity, however, that men of responsibility
and public affairs can best perform the same
mental act as we do and yet have it go unno
ticed. This is because the nature of the Uni
versity and their own thought within it, pro
vides them with a well developed disguise.
Thus, while both learner and learned think in
identical ways, the dissimilarities occur when
our teachers and administrators choose to ig
nore or turn away from what it is they do with
their minds in relation to their responsibilities
and public life. And that difference is truly im
portant, for the reasoned acknowledgment and
acceptance of the abnormal and irrational is
more perverse when that person who so reasons
remains in and of the world.
(This is to suggest that there is little real
support for the learners' self-righteous con
tempt for the learned when in fact the only real
difference between them is that the learned
are supposed to be in and of the world. The
fact that most of us do the same things witli
our minds, at least within the university, may
be a more useful way of explaining that 90 per
cent of us plan to go on to some sort of gradu
ate school, where we can continue the process
and be rewarded for it.)
The criticism of the learned needs to be de
tailed. Trying again to avoid confusion be
tween the problems of objectivity and the phe
nomenon I am considering, allow me to say
that the notion of a controlled situation, which
is central to objective research, presumes the
existence of an uncontrolled situation, which is
not at all central to research. This emphasis on
the controlled situation in the face of a much
larger and more complex uncontrolled situa

and teaches freshman English.
tion, also may be understood as a desire to
work with {he rational as opposed to the irra
tional. In any case, it serves as an effective
excuse for not making the uncontrolled central
to one's life as a learned.
In the larger context of the community of
the learned, however, it is less difficult to cite
examples how the learned attempt to do the
rational thing in this kind of world, how they
separate the controlled from the uncontrolled,
how they join with Dean Whitaker in disguised
resignation. When CIA interviewers visit the
campus and protest seems imminent, our fac
ulty and administration implore us to uphold
freedom of speech on the basis of reason. But
the concept of free speech becomes the sub
stitute for reason, it precludes any further use
of reason, and silence prevails. Those who pro
test disruptively are tried on the basis of legal
isms and the logic of jurisprudence. 1 The moral
arguments pass by the legalistic arguments and
both learners and learned ignore each other.
And then, when the student Judicial Council
attempts to bring a halt to this pathetic non
dialogue, this gigantic irrelevancy, the admin
istration responds with concern that law has
been suspended in the campus community.
Our teachers have lost the ability to see
themselves in relation to this world, just as most
of us have. But the implications are so much
greater when they demonstrate this inability.
Harvard, Oberlin, and almost every college in
the Bay Area which has experienced disruption
due to the war or the condition of the black
man in America, have seen fit to take time off
from business as usual to discuss these complex
issues as an entire community. On this campus
there are students and administrators who have
been trying since November to get major mem
bers of the faculty and administration to sit
down for just one evening and discuss the prob
lem of CIA recruitment on campus and they
have never been able to arrange a time 'con
venient for everyone." (If you believe this issue
has been resolved, see The New Republic

article by Henry Commager reprinted on
page 2.)
As crises arise and groups become more and
more polarized, the university administration
continues to maintain itself by hurling one or
two persons with some sort of charisma into
the breach of conflict in the hope of preserving
business as usual. These individuals should not
be expected to solve all of the problems we
have created and chosen to ignore. To station
an Associate Dean of Students between an
anti-war street troupe and the Army ROTC
cadets standing at attention on a soccer field is
not a parody on the theatre of absurd. Nor
should it be construed as any way to run a uni
versity. It just happens to be the result of in
stitutionalized resignation, where Johnny-on
the-spot replaces the man of thought.
THE way in which we now think seeks to
place a wall between us and the 'world.
There is, however, a leak in that wall
and a well chosen thumb here or there is not
going to keep out "this kind of world.' We must
begin to scale that wall to see what is on the
other side. The invocation of university policy
regardless of its relevance and the use of charis
matic figures and student police to prevent dis
ruption are the most obvious signs that our
teachers have given up. They join those of us
who have lost even the energy to force air
across our vocal cords to whisper "Stop."
What will it mean for Stanford to climb that
wall? We must begin by acknowledging the
wall as a creation of our minds, an illusory
mentalistic barrier that has become normative
and prescriptive. Only after this recognition is
made is it possible to escape the contradictions
which necessarily flow from that mental act.
Once the wall is removed, the easy distinc
tions we have made for classifying and cate
gorizing and the operational definitions we
have set up for description and prediction
begin to appear meaningless. What do rational,
irrational, normal, and abnormal mean? Is set
ting fire to the NROTC shack an irrational act
in an irrational world? Or is it a gratuitous act
by men who defy simple either/or classifica
tions? Is the fact that American colleges and
universities were able to operate without inter
ruption during the Vietnam War until the draft
policy was changed (to a policy which is more
equitable, incidentally) a rational fact in an
irrational world? (There are ironic similarities
in that statement and the following: "Under
Mussolini, the trains ran on time in Italy." To
counter with the charge that we have had pro
test and demonstration on the campus is like
an Italian citizen saying, "My train from Flor
ence arrived thirteen minutes late in Rome on
Dec. 18, 1939.")

Or more pointedly, what does rational mean
when you impute that attribute to the thought:
"I should plan a normal course of life in this
kind of world."
Phenomenologically speaking, when that
wall and the concomitant mentalistic functions
which are necessary for its maintenance are re
moved, we are faced with understanding a new
world. Some of our popular products of analo
gous reasoning would break down and leave
us rather helpless in the path of uncompromis
ing data that cannot be bent to fit our view of
the world. This is what Marcuse calls the "re
opening of discourse.' And were that discourse
to occur, would the effects be any more calami
tous than those experienced by the universities
when they became partners with the govern
ment in the race to the moon? Or those felt
when graduate students were threatened with
the draft? Or those caused by recent federal
budget cuts? Or those effects that can be traced
to the introduction of drugs on campus?
Yet, none of the above events, which caused
the university so much anxiety, were put into
motion by the university. We could only react
for we have lost the ability to initiate events in
the world. This is because we have resigned
from the world.
Still, I believe a majority of students on this
campus would join with leadership from the
soon to be organized Academic Senate in a
mutual endeavor to climb that wall we have all
helped to build. I believe these students feel
there is something more valuable for this uni
versity than a two-year study of itself. I cannot
say whether there are faculty members who are
prepared to demonstrate that there may be
something more important to them than their
research or promotion or attempts to keep up
the facade of business as usual.
In any case, I would hope that it is still pos
sible to conceive of breaking our inane lock
step march to privatism and self-indulgent im
potence. Could the university set up a program
under which the student body, instead of play
ing in the ruins of European castles, would
have the option of working in the streets and
factories and corporations and government of
America? Isn't it time we admit that Stanford
Away is more important than Stanford Abroad?
Are there professors who would join us and
be willing to examine our responsibilities (and
their own) rather than the "context of our re
sponsibilities."
Are there no members of the faculty who
would be willing to stop their work and con
sider the implications of the university as an
employment agency? (Of course this would re
quire students to reassess their own motives
for obtaining a Stanford degree.) Or are we
content to suspend classes and business as
usual just for Washington's Birthday, President
Sterling's annual address, and the visits of
people like Hubert Humphrey?
The time has come when we need to tell our
administration that it is banal to travel through
the country telling our friends and alumni that
the Stanford ship, though in troubled waters,
is still steaming. And stop trying to explain the
rough going by accusing the far left and far
right. The glibness of that explanation allows
you to focus on the strength of the ship and
appeal to everyone to come aboard.
The point is that Stanford has resigned from
the rough waters by convincing itself that it has
built a sturdy ship. That allows the captain and
crew to remain insulated from the water and
they never look at it again in quite the same
way. "The only normal thing to do when the

has nothing to do with the nature of the water
in which it steams. It just makes the people on

Mussolini, the trains ran on time in Italy." To
counter with the charge that we have had pro
test and demonstration on the campus is like
an Italian citizen saying, "My train from Flor
ence arrived thirteen minutes late in Rome on
Dec. 18, 1939.")

Or more pointedly, what does rational mean
when you impute that attribute to the thought:
"I should plan a normal course of life in this
kind of world."
Phenomenologically speaking, when that
wall and the concomitant mentalistic functions
which are necessary for its maintenance are re
moved, we are faced with understanding a new
world. Some of our popular products of analo
gous reasoning would break down and leave
us rather helpless in the path of uncompromis
ing data that cannot be bent to fit our view of
the world. This is what Marcuse calls the "re
opening of discourse.' And were that discourse
to occur, would the effects be any more calami
tous than those experienced by the universities
when they became partners with the govern
ment in the race to the moon? Or those felt
when graduate students were threatened with
the draft? Or those caused by recent federal
budget cuts? Or those effects that can be traced
to the introduction of drugs on campus?
Yet, none of the above events, which caused
the university so much anxiety, were put into
motion by the university. We could only react
for we have lost the ability to initiate events in
the world. This is because we have resigned
from the world.
Still, I believe a majority of students on this
campus would join with leadership from the
soon to be organized Academic Senate in a
mutual endeavor to climb that wall we have all
helped to build. I believe these students feel
there is something more valuable for this uni
versity than a two-year study of itself. I cannot
say whether there are faculty members who are
prepared to demonstrate that there may be
something more important to them than their
research or promotion or attempts to keep up
the facade of business as usual.
In any case, I would hope that it is still pos
sible to conceive of breaking our inane lock
step march to privatism and self-indulgent im
potence. Could the university set up a program
under which the student body, instead of play
ing in the ruins of European castles, would
have the option of working in the streets and
factories and corporations and government of
America? Isn't it time we admit that Stanford
Away is more important than Stanford Abroad?
Are there professors who would join us and
be willing to examine our responsibilities (and
their own) rather than the "context of our re
sponsibilities."
Are there no members of the faculty who
would be willing to stop their work and con
sider the implications of the university as an
employment agency? (Of course this would re
quire students to reassess their own motives
for obtaining a Stanford degree.) Or are we
content to suspend classes and business as
usual just for Washington's Birthday, President
Sterling's annual address, and the visits of
people like Hubert Humphrey?
The time has come when we need to tell our
administration that it is banal to travel through
the country telling our friends and alumni that
the Stanford ship, though in troubled waters,
is still steaming. And stop trying to explain the
rough going by accusing the far left and far
right. The glibness of that explanation allows
you to focus on the strength of the ship and
appeal to everyone to come aboard.
The point is that Stanford has resigned from
the rough waters by convincing itself that it has
built a sturdy ship. That allows the captain and
crew to remain insulated from the water and
they never look at it again in quite the same
way. "The only normal thing to do when the
seas get rough is to build a sturdy ship and
keep it steaming." Unfortunately, a strong ship
has nothing to do with the nature of the water
in which it steams. It just makes the people on
board feel more secure.


"To station an Associate Dean of Students between an anti-war troupe
and army ROTC cadets ... is not a parody on the theater of absurd."

Advice to a Stanford Senior
February 16, 1968

THE fatherly tone of these remarks made
in the light of the new Selective Service
policy is not enough to conceal a pa
thetic commentary on Stanford University, and
most universities in America. Dean Whitaker,
in this quote attributed to him by The Daily
and perhaps not representative of his entire
position, has captured the voice of intellectuals
who have resigned from the world. This resig
nation, cloaked in the kindliness of fatherhood,
is the actuality of impotence which results from
the well-reasoned attempts to ignore the con
tradictions which make the utterance and ac
ceptance of the statement possible. That voice
speaks to all of us, father and child, learned
and learner.
To examine this remark is a helpful way of
beginning to understand the sad sight of "both
ered and troubled" administrators, whose "un
easiness grew with every day that passed," try
ing to frame a University statement on drug
abuse (about three years after abuse first
began) because of "the incident at Stony
Brook." It may even help us see why adminis
trators and students alike began acting like
alarmed mother hens when an attempt at
greater equity in the draft policy interrupted
their secure little lives. It may allow us to see
why, despite all of the skills and powers of
prediction which we seek to develop here at
Stanford, we are passive, reactive agents, ap
parently incapable of initiating events in the
world. By drawing out the implications of the
Dean's timely advice, we can start to under
stand how it is we contribute to the creation
and maintenance of the conditions which make
this advice necessary.
WHAT indeed can a "normal course"
be? If it is the "only rational thing
to do in this kind of world," are we
not being asked to live normally in an abnormal
world? Isn't the proffered advice suggesting
that we act rationally in an irrational world?
Or at least, "in this kind of world," a world that
is not as we would have it? To paraphrase, we
are supposed to go ahead with business as

usual, though the world's business is most un
usual. Or in the words of the pragmatic realist
(circa 1968): "Of course this is an imperfect
world. But that is no excuse to abandon rea
son."
On the face of it, this admonition makes good
sense and is logically consistent. However, this
warning (and the above quote) are exam
ples of functional rationalization, i.e., they
have no substance. They serve to partially ac
count for the world and to enable the believer
to continue his existence. The rationality of the
statement serves the speaker. Substantively
speaking, the fact of the imperfect world and
its relationship to the use of reason, and the
combination of these two upon the speaker, is
ignored. Functional rationalization allows for
the necessary perpetuation of "this kind of
world," though, it is thought, that is what we
seek to change. Now why is this so?
To begin with, once the contradictions be
tween normal and abnormal are buried in our
minds, the critical imagination of the mind is
lost to the world. When the life of the college
dean and the graduating senior presumes its
own rationality, the life of the Selective Service
and the non-academic world of presumed irra
tionality is obviated. With this act the promise
of tension, the force of dialectics is lost to illu
sory personal resolution or mindless polariza
tion.
This is more than the bifurcation of thought
from action. It is to think and to reason from
the I-me (rational) frame of reference only
after the world, the irrational have been dis
missed a priori. To presume one's world abnor
mal and at the same time to declare the ration
ality of one's existence is to perform the mental
act that effectively removes one from any place
in that world. But more important is the fact
that such a stance causes one to forfeit the vis
ion necessary to act on such differences that
exist in the world. To close off our lives allows
for private sanity, perhaps, but little else.
(Here, a new question arises. Should the result
of closing off one's life really be described as
"sanity"?)
THE above remarks should not be con
strued as a critique of reason or objec
tivity. What I have tried to describe is
a phenomenon of entirely new dimensions.
While the distance between one's self and one's
world may be called objectivity and an ex
ample of reason, the establishment of catego
ries at the boundaries of this distance is not
objectivity. Whein the observer presumes him
self to be normal and the observed is termed
abnormal, we have a process quite unlike ob
jectivity. (Though the indoctrination of objec
tivity in the classroom undoubtedly makes the
sidestep to resignation through functional ra
tionalization much easier.)
To understand this phenomenon let us ex
amine our lives here at Stanford and explain
how each of us is capable of making and ac
cepting Whitaker's statement. Only then can
it be shown that our capacity for that is symp
tomatic of the causes for the existence of "this
kind of world." For the purpose of explication
I think it is necessaiy to separate Stanford into
two groups (a not altogether satisfying sugges
tion, but one that is recognized and encouraged
by all): the learners and the learned.
As learner, the student at Stanford goes

through some kind of horizontal development
that may be sketched roughly as follows: Com
munity Initiation (new teachers, books, ideas),
Involvement (picketing, petitions, voting, com
mittee work, tutoring, striking, etc.), Frustra
tion, Desperation, Impotence. It is also likely
that at some time in this process the learner ex
periments with drugs and love making. Never
theless, somewhere between entrance and exit,
the learner in this community terminates his
development in the formalization of a personal
normal-abnormal ethic privatism. That is, he
or she makes the conscious decision that de
spite the absurdity and unchangeability of the
world, he or she endeavor to live a rational,
meaningful, good personal life. The world is
rejected and the self is preserved into a Tarzan
like, "Me rational/it irrational" existence. At
that point we join with Dean Whitaker in the
ability to make his statement.
It is more difficult to perceive and under
stand what happens to the learned among us
since we are really not one of them. But since
my program advisers tell me I am soon to be
a learned, perhaps I can attempt a description.
There is a basic difference between learners
and the learned which makes the process of
resignation among the learned more difficult
to identify. That difference is that we (the
learners) have no responsibilities or a public
life. This allows for our retreat from the ir
rational into impotence to go undisguised,
though not unnoticed.
The learned, on the other hand, have both
formal responsibilities and public affairs which
demand of them an accounting, an effort, a
putting forth, if you will, to prove that they
have not resigned. It is in the University com
munity, however, that men of responsibility
and public affairs can best perform the same
mental act as we do and yet have it go unno
ticed. This is because the nature of the Uni
versity and their own thought within it, pro
vides them with a well developed disguise.
Thus, while both learner and learned think in
identical ways, the dissimilarities occur when
our teachers and administrators choose to ig
nore or turn away from what it is they do with
their minds in relation to their responsibilities
and public life. And that difference is truly im
portant, for the reasoned acknowledgment and
acceptance of the abnormal and irrational is
more perverse when that person who so reasons
remains in and of the world.
(This is to suggest that there is little real
support for the learners' self-righteous con
tempt for the learned when in fact the only real
difference between them is that the learned
are supposed to be in and of the world. The
fact that most of us do the same things witli
our minds, at least within the university, may
be a more useful way of explaining that 90 per
cent of us plan to go on to some sort of gradu
ate school, where we can continue the process
and be rewarded for it.)
The criticism of the learned needs to be de
tailed. Trying again to avoid confusion be
tween the problems of objectivity and the phe
nomenon I am considering, allow me to say
that the notion of a controlled situation, which
is central to objective research, presumes the
existence of an uncontrolled situation, which is
not at all central to research. This emphasis on
the controlled situation in the face of a much
larger and more complex uncontrolled situa

and teaches freshman English.
tion, also may be understood as a desire to
work with {he rational as opposed to the irra
tional. In any case, it serves as an effective
excuse for not making the uncontrolled central
to one's life as a learned.
In the larger context of the community of
the learned, however, it is less difficult to cite
examples how the learned attempt to do the
rational thing in this kind of world, how they
separate the controlled from the uncontrolled,
how they join with Dean Whitaker in disguised
resignation. When CIA interviewers visit the
campus and protest seems imminent, our fac
ulty and administration implore us to uphold
freedom of speech on the basis of reason. But
the concept of free speech becomes the sub
stitute for reason, it precludes any further use
of reason, and silence prevails. Those who pro
test disruptively are tried on the basis of legal
isms and the logic of jurisprudence. 1 The moral
arguments pass by the legalistic arguments and
both learners and learned ignore each other.
And then, when the student Judicial Council
attempts to bring a halt to this pathetic non
dialogue, this gigantic irrelevancy, the admin
istration responds with concern that law has
been suspended in the campus community.
Our teachers have lost the ability to see
themselves in relation to this world, just as most
of us have. But the implications are so much
greater when they demonstrate this inability.
Harvard, Oberlin, and almost every college in
the Bay Area which has experienced disruption
due to the war or the condition of the black
man in America, have seen fit to take time off
from business as usual to discuss these complex
issues as an entire community. On this campus
there are students and administrators who have
been trying since November to get major mem
bers of the faculty and administration to sit
down for just one evening and discuss the prob
lem of CIA recruitment on campus and they
have never been able to arrange a time 'con
venient for everyone." (If you believe this issue
has been resolved, see The New Republic

article by Henry Commager reprinted on
page 2.)
As crises arise and groups become more and
more polarized, the university administration
continues to maintain itself by hurling one or
two persons with some sort of charisma into
the breach of conflict in the hope of preserving
business as usual. These individuals should not
be expected to solve all of the problems we
have created and chosen to ignore. To station
an Associate Dean of Students between an
anti-war street troupe and the Army ROTC
cadets standing at attention on a soccer field is
not a parody on the theatre of absurd. Nor
should it be construed as any way to run a uni
versity. It just happens to be the result of in
stitutionalized resignation, where Johnny-on
the-spot replaces the man of thought.
THE way in which we now think seeks to
place a wall between us and the 'world.
There is, however, a leak in that wall
and a well chosen thumb here or there is not
going to keep out "this kind of world.' We must
begin to scale that wall to see what is on the
other side. The invocation of university policy
regardless of its relevance and the use of charis
matic figures and student police to prevent dis
ruption are the most obvious signs that our
teachers have given up. They join those of us
who have lost even the energy to force air
across our vocal cords to whisper "Stop."
What will it mean for Stanford to climb that
wall? We must begin by acknowledging the
wall as a creation of our minds, an illusory
mentalistic barrier that has become normative
and prescriptive. Only after this recognition is
made is it possible to escape the contradictions
which necessarily flow from that mental act.
Once the wall is removed, the easy distinc
tions we have made for classifying and cate
gorizing and the operational definitions we
have set up for description and prediction
begin to appear meaningless. What do rational,
irrational, normal, and abnormal mean? Is set
ting fire to the NROTC shack an irrational act
in an irrational world? Or is it a gratuitous act
by men who defy simple either/or classifica
tions? Is the fact that American colleges and
universities were able to operate without inter
ruption during the Vietnam War until the draft
policy was changed (to a policy which is more
equitable, incidentally) a rational fact in an
irrational world? (There are ironic similarities
in that statement and the following: "Under
Mussolini, the trains ran on time in Italy." To
counter with the charge that we have had pro
test and demonstration on the campus is like
an Italian citizen saying, "My train from Flor
ence arrived thirteen minutes late in Rome on
Dec. 18, 1939.")

Or more pointedly, what does rational mean
when you impute that attribute to the thought:
"I should plan a normal course of life in this
kind of world."
Phenomenologically speaking, when that
wall and the concomitant mentalistic functions
which are necessary for its maintenance are re
moved, we are faced with understanding a new
world. Some of our popular products of analo
gous reasoning would break down and leave
us rather helpless in the path of uncompromis
ing data that cannot be bent to fit our view of
the world. This is what Marcuse calls the "re
opening of discourse.' And were that discourse
to occur, would the effects be any more calami
tous than those experienced by the universities
when they became partners with the govern
ment in the race to the moon? Or those felt
when graduate students were threatened with
the draft? Or those caused by recent federal
budget cuts? Or those effects that can be traced
to the introduction of drugs on campus?
Yet, none of the above events, which caused
the university so much anxiety, were put into

versity than a two-year study of itself. I cannot

prepared to demonstrate that there may be
something more important to them than their

the facade of business as usual.
In any case, I would hope that it is still pos
sible to conceive of breaking our inane lock
step march to privatism and self-indulgent im
potence. Could the university set up a program
under which the student body, instead of play
ing in the ruins of European castles, would
have the option of working in the streets and
factories and corporations and government of
America? Isn't it time we admit that Stanford
Away is more important than Stanford Abroad?
Are there professors who would join us and

have created and chosen to ignore. To station
an Associate Dean of Students between an
anti-war street troupe and the Army ROTC
cadets standing at attention on a soccer field is
not a parody on the theatre of absurd. Nor
should it be construed as any way to run a uni
versity. It just happens to be the result of in
stitutionalized resignation, where Johnny-on
the-spot replaces the man of thought.
THE way in which we now think seeks to
place a wall between us and the 'world.
There is, however, a leak in that wall
and a well chosen thumb here or there is not
going to keep out "this kind of world.' We must
begin to scale that wall to see what is on the
other side. The invocation of university policy
regardless of its relevance and the use of charis
matic figures and student police to prevent dis
ruption are the most obvious signs that our
teachers have given up. They join those of us
who have lost even the energy to force air
across our vocal cords to whisper "Stop."
What will it mean for Stanford to climb that
wall? We must begin by acknowledging the
wall as a creation of our minds, an illusory
mentalistic barrier that has become normative
and prescriptive. Only after this recognition is
made is it possible to escape the contradictions
which necessarily flow from that mental act.
Once the wall is removed, the easy distinc
tions we have made for classifying and cate
gorizing and the operational definitions we
have set up for description and prediction
begin to appear meaningless. What do rational,
irrational, normal, and abnormal mean? Is set
ting fire to the NROTC shack an irrational act
in an irrational world? Or is it a gratuitous act
by men who defy simple either/or classifica
tions? Is the fact that American colleges and
universities were able to operate without inter
ruption during the Vietnam War until the draft
policy was changed (to a policy which is more
equitable, incidentally) a rational fact in an
irrational world? (There are ironic similarities
in that statement and the following: "Under
Mussolini, the trains ran on time in Italy." To
counter with the charge that we have had pro
test and demonstration on the campus is like
an Italian citizen saying, "My train from Flor
ence arrived thirteen minutes late in Rome on
Dec. 18, 1939.")

Or more pointedly, what does rational mean
when you impute that attribute to the thought:
"I should plan a normal course of life in this
kind of world."
Phenomenologically speaking, when that
wall and the concomitant mentalistic functions
which are necessary for its maintenance are re
moved, we are faced with understanding a new
world. Some of our popular products of analo
gous reasoning would break down and leave
us rather helpless in the path of uncompromis
ing data that cannot be bent to fit our view of
the world. This is what Marcuse calls the "re
opening of discourse.' And were that discourse
to occur, would the effects be any more calami
tous than those experienced by the universities
when they became partners with the govern
ment in the race to the moon? Or those felt
when graduate students were threatened with
the draft? Or those caused by recent federal
budget cuts? Or those effects that can be traced
to the introduction of drugs on campus?
Yet, none of the above events, which caused
the university so much anxiety, were put into
motion by the university. We could only react
for we have lost the ability to initiate events in
the world. This is because we have resigned
from the world.
Still, I believe a majority of students on this
campus would join with leadership from the
soon to be organized Academic Senate in a
mutual endeavor to climb that wall we have all
helped to build. I believe these students feel
there is something more valuable for this uni
versity than a two-year study of itself. I cannot
say whether there are faculty members who are
prepared to demonstrate that there may be
something more important to them than their
research or promotion or attempts to keep up
the facade of business as usual.
In any case, I would hope that it is still pos
sible to conceive of breaking our inane lock
step march to privatism and self-indulgent im
potence. Could the university set up a program
under which the student body, instead of play
ing in the ruins of European castles, would
have the option of working in the streets and
factories and corporations and government of
America? Isn't it time we admit that Stanford
Away is more important than Stanford Abroad?
Are there professors who would join us and
be willing to examine our responsibilities (and
their own) rather than the "context of our re
sponsibilities."
Are there no members of the faculty who
would be willing to stop their work and con
sider the implications of the university as an
employment agency? (Of course this would re
quire students to reassess their own motives
for obtaining a Stanford degree.) Or are we
content to suspend classes and business as
usual just for Washington's Birthday, President
Sterling's annual address, and the visits of
people like Hubert Humphrey?
The time has come when we need to tell our
administration that it is banal to travel through
the country telling our friends and alumni that
the Stanford ship, though in troubled waters,
is still steaming. And stop trying to explain the
rough going by accusing the far left and far
right. The glibness of that explanation allows
you to focus on the strength of the ship and
appeal to everyone to come aboard.
The point is that Stanford has resigned from
the rough waters by convincing itself that it has
built a sturdy ship. That allows the captain and
crew to remain insulated from the water and
they never look at it again in quite the same
way. "The only normal thing to do when the
seas get rough is to build a sturdy ship and
keep it steaming." Unfortunately, a strong ship
has nothing to do with the nature of the water
in which it steams. It just makes the people on
board feel more secure.

Advice to a Stanford Senior
February 16, 1968

THE fatherly tone of these remarks made
in the light of the new Selective Service
policy is not enough to conceal a pa
thetic commentary on Stanford University, and
most universities in America. Dean Whitaker,
in this quote attributed to him by The Daily
and perhaps not representative of his entire
position, has captured the voice of intellectuals
who have resigned from the world. This resig
nation, cloaked in the kindliness of fatherhood,
is the actuality of impotence which results from
the well-reasoned attempts to ignore the con
tradictions which make the utterance and ac
ceptance of the statement possible. That voice
speaks to all of us, father and child, learned
and learner.
To examine this remark is a helpful way of
beginning to understand the sad sight of "both
ered and troubled" administrators, whose "un
easiness grew with every day that passed," try
ing to frame a University statement on drug
abuse (about three years after abuse first
began) because of "the incident at Stony
Brook." It may even help us see why adminis
trators and students alike began acting like
alarmed mother hens when an attempt at
greater equity in the draft policy interrupted
their secure little lives. It may allow us to see
why, despite all of the skills and powers of
prediction which we seek to develop here at
Stanford, we are passive, reactive agents, ap
parently incapable of initiating events in the
world. By drawing out the implications of the
Dean's timely advice, we can start to under
stand how it is we contribute to the creation
and maintenance of the conditions which make
this advice necessary.
WHAT indeed can a "normal course"
be? If it is the "only rational thing
to do in this kind of world," are we
not being asked to live normally in an abnormal
world? Isn't the proffered advice suggesting
that we act rationally in an irrational world?
Or at least, "in this kind of world," a world that
is not as we would have it? To paraphrase, we
are supposed to go ahead with business as

usual, though the world's business is most un
usual. Or in the words of the pragmatic realist
(circa 1968): "Of course this is an imperfect
world. But that is no excuse to abandon rea
son."
On the face of it, this admonition makes good
sense and is logically consistent. However, this
warning (and the above quote) are exam
ples of functional rationalization, i.e., they
have no substance. They serve to partially ac
count for the world and to enable the believer
to continue his existence. The rationality of the
statement serves the speaker. Substantively
speaking, the fact of the imperfect world and
its relationship to the use of reason, and the
combination of these two upon the speaker, is
ignored. Functional rationalization allows for
the necessary perpetuation of "this kind of
world," though, it is thought, that is what we
seek to change. Now why is this so?
To begin with, once the contradictions be
tween normal and abnormal are buried in our
minds, the critical imagination of the mind is
lost to the world. When the life of the college
dean and the graduating senior presumes its
own rationality, the life of the Selective Service
and the non-academic world of presumed irra
tionality is obviated. With this act the promise
of tension, the force of dialectics is lost to illu
sory personal resolution or mindless polariza
tion.
This is more than the bifurcation of thought
from action. It is to think and to reason from
the I-me (rational) frame of reference only
after the world, the irrational have been dis
missed a priori. To presume one's world abnor
mal and at the same time to declare the ration
ality of one's existence is to perform the mental
act that effectively removes one from any place
in that world. But more important is the fact
that such a stance causes one to forfeit the vis
ion necessary to act on such differences that
exist in the world. To close off our lives allows
for private sanity, perhaps, but little else.
(Here, a new question arises. Should the result
of closing off one's life really be described as
"sanity"?)
THE above remarks should not be con
strued as a critique of reason or objec
tivity. What I have tried to describe is
a phenomenon of entirely new dimensions.
While the distance between one's self and one's
world may be called objectivity and an ex
ample of reason, the establishment of catego
ries at the boundaries of this distance is not
objectivity. Whein the observer presumes him
self to be normal and the observed is termed
abnormal, we have a process quite unlike ob
jectivity. (Though the indoctrination of objec
tivity in the classroom undoubtedly makes the
sidestep to resignation through functional ra
tionalization much easier.)
To understand this phenomenon let us ex
amine our lives here at Stanford and explain
how each of us is capable of making and ac
cepting Whitaker's statement. Only then can
it be shown that our capacity for that is symp
tomatic of the causes for the existence of "this
kind of world." For the purpose of explication
I think it is necessaiy to separate Stanford into
two groups (a not altogether satisfying sugges
tion, but one that is recognized and encouraged
by all): the learners and the learned.
As learner, the student at Stanford goes

through some kind of horizontal development
that may be sketched roughly as follows: Com
munity Initiation (new teachers, books, ideas),
Involvement (picketing, petitions, voting, com
mittee work, tutoring, striking, etc.), Frustra
tion, Desperation, Impotence. It is also likely
that at some time in this process the learner ex
periments with drugs and love making. Never
theless, somewhere between entrance and exit,
the learner in this community terminates his
development in the formalization of a personal
normal-abnormal ethic privatism. That is, he
or she makes the conscious decision that de
spite the absurdity and unchangeability of the
world, he or she endeavor to live a rational,
meaningful, good personal life. The world is
rejected and the self is preserved into a Tarzan
like, "Me rational/it irrational" existence. At
that point we join with Dean Whitaker in the
ability to make his statement.
It is more difficult to perceive and under
stand what happens to the learned among us
since we are really not one of them. But since
my program advisers tell me I am soon to be
a learned, perhaps I can attempt a description.
There is a basic difference between learners
and the learned which makes the process of
resignation among the learned more difficult
to identify. That difference is that we (the
learners) have no responsibilities or a public
life. This allows for our retreat from the ir
rational into impotence to go undisguised,
though not unnoticed.
The learned, on the other hand, have both
formal responsibilities and public affairs which
demand of them an accounting, an effort, a
putting forth, if you will, to prove that they
have not resigned. It is in the University com
munity, however, that men of responsibility
and public affairs can best perform the same
mental act as we do and yet have it go unno
ticed. This is because the nature of the Uni
versity and their own thought within it, pro
vides them with a well developed disguise.
Thus, while both learner and learned think in
identical ways, the dissimilarities occur when
our teachers and administrators choose to ig
nore or turn away from what it is they do with
their minds in relation to their responsibilities
and public life. And that difference is truly im
portant, for the reasoned acknowledgment and
acceptance of the abnormal and irrational is
more perverse when that person who so reasons
remains in and of the world.
(This is to suggest that there is little real
support for the learners' self-righteous con
tempt for the learned when in fact the only real
difference between them is that the learned
are supposed to be in and of the world. The
fact that most of us do the same things witli
our minds, at least within the university, may
be a more useful way of explaining that 90 per
cent of us plan to go on to some sort of gradu
ate school, where we can continue the process
and be rewarded for it.)
The criticism of the learned needs to be de
tailed. Trying again to avoid confusion be
tween the problems of objectivity and the phe
nomenon I am considering, allow me to say
that the notion of a controlled situation, which
is central to objective research, presumes the
existence of an uncontrolled situation, which is
not at all central to research. This emphasis on
the controlled situation in the face of a much
larger and more complex uncontrolled situa

and teaches freshman English.
tion, also may be understood as a desire to
work with {he rational as opposed to the irra
tional. In any case, it serves as an effective
excuse for not making the uncontrolled central
to one's life as a learned.
In the larger context of the community of
the learned, however, it is less difficult to cite
examples how the learned attempt to do the
rational thing in this kind of world, how they
separate the controlled from the uncontrolled,
how they join with Dean Whitaker in disguised
resignation. When CIA interviewers visit the
campus and protest seems imminent, our fac
ulty and administration implore us to uphold
freedom of speech on the basis of reason. But
the concept of free speech becomes the sub
stitute for reason, it precludes any further use
of reason, and silence prevails. Those who pro
test disruptively are tried on the basis of legal
isms and the logic of jurisprudence. 1 The moral
arguments pass by the legalistic arguments and
both learners and learned ignore each other.
And then, when the student Judicial Council
attempts to bring a halt to this pathetic non
dialogue, this gigantic irrelevancy, the admin
istration responds with concern that law has
been suspended in the campus community.
Our teachers have lost the ability to see
themselves in relation to this world, just as most
of us have. But the implications are so much
greater when they demonstrate this inability.
Harvard, Oberlin, and almost every college in
the Bay Area which has experienced disruption
due to the war or the condition of the black
man in America, have seen fit to take time off
from business as usual to discuss these complex
issues as an entire community. On this campus
there are students and administrators who have
been trying since November to get major mem
bers of the faculty and administration to sit
down for just one evening and discuss the prob
lem of CIA recruitment on campus and they
have never been able to arrange a time 'con
venient for everyone." (If you believe this issue
has been resolved, see The New Republic

article by Henry Commager reprinted on
page 2.)
As crises arise and groups become more and
more polarized, the university administration
continues to maintain itself by hurling one or
two persons with some sort of charisma into
the breach of conflict in the hope of preserving
business as usual. These individuals should not
be expected to solve all of the problems we
have created and chosen to ignore. To station
an Associate Dean of Students between an
anti-war street troupe and the Army ROTC
cadets standing at attention on a soccer field is
not a parody on the theatre of absurd. Nor
should it be construed as any way to run a uni
versity. It just happens to be the result of in
stitutionalized resignation, where Johnny-on
the-spot replaces the man of thought.
THE way in which we now think seeks to
place a wall between us and the 'world.
There is, however, a leak in that wall
and a well chosen thumb here or there is not
going to keep out "this kind of world.' We must
begin to scale that wall to see what is on the
other side. The invocation of university policy
regardless of its relevance and the use of charis
matic figures and student police to prevent dis
ruption are the most obvious signs that our
teachers have given up. They join those of us
who have lost even the energy to force air
across our vocal cords to whisper "Stop."
What will it mean for Stanford to climb that
wall? We must begin by acknowledging the
wall as a creation of our minds, an illusory
mentalistic barrier that has become normative
and prescriptive. Only after this recognition is
made is it possible to escape the contradictions
which necessarily flow from that mental act.
Once the wall is removed, the easy distinc
tions we have made for classifying and cate
gorizing and the operational definitions we
have set up for description and prediction
begin to appear meaningless. What do rational,
irrational, normal, and abnormal mean? Is set
ting fire to the NROTC shack an irrational act
in an irrational world? Or is it a gratuitous act
by men who defy simple either/or classifica
tions? Is the fact that American colleges and
universities were able to operate without inter
ruption during the Vietnam War until the draft
policy was changed (to a policy which is more
equitable, incidentally) a rational fact in an
irrational world? (There are ironic similarities

examples how the learned attempt to do the
rational thing in this kind of world, how they
separate the controlled from the uncontrolled,
how they join with Dean Whitaker in disguised
resignation. When CIA interviewers visit the
campus and protest seems imminent, our fac
ulty and administration implore us to uphold
freedom of speech on the basis of reason. But
the concept of free speech becomes the sub
stitute for reason, it precludes any further use
of reason, and silence prevails. Those who pro
test disruptively are tried on the basis of legal
isms and the logic of jurisprudence. 1 The moral
arguments pass by the legalistic arguments and
both learners and learned ignore each other.
And then, when the student Judicial Council
attempts to bring a halt to this pathetic non
dialogue, this gigantic irrelevancy, the admin
istration responds with concern that law has
been suspended in the campus community.
Our teachers have lost the ability to see
themselves in relation to this world, just as most
of us have. But the implications are so much
greater when they demonstrate this inability.
Harvard, Oberlin, and almost every college in
the Bay Area which has experienced disruption
due to the war or the condition of the black
man in America, have seen fit to take time off
from business as usual to discuss these complex
issues as an entire community. On this campus
there are students and administrators who have
been trying since November to get major mem
bers of the faculty and administration to sit
down for just one evening and discuss the prob
lem of CIA recruitment on campus and they
have never been able to arrange a time 'con
venient for everyone." (If you believe this issue
has been resolved, see The New Republic

article by Henry Commager reprinted on
page 2.)
As crises arise and groups become more and
more polarized, the university administration
continues to maintain itself by hurling one or
two persons with some sort of charisma into
the breach of conflict in the hope of preserving
business as usual. These individuals should not
be expected to solve all of the problems we
have created and chosen to ignore. To station
an Associate Dean of Students between an
anti-war street troupe and the Army ROTC
cadets standing at attention on a soccer field is
not a parody on the theatre of absurd. Nor
should it be construed as any way to run a uni
versity. It just happens to be the result of in
stitutionalized resignation, where Johnny-on
the-spot replaces the man of thought.
THE way in which we now think seeks to
place a wall between us and the 'world.
There is, however, a leak in that wall
and a well chosen thumb here or there is not
going to keep out "this kind of world.' We must
begin to scale that wall to see what is on the
other side. The invocation of university policy
regardless of its relevance and the use of charis
matic figures and student police to prevent dis
ruption are the most obvious signs that our
teachers have given up. They join those of us
who have lost even the energy to force air
across our vocal cords to whisper "Stop."
What will it mean for Stanford to climb that
wall? We must begin by acknowledging the
wall as a creation of our minds, an illusory
mentalistic barrier that has become normative
and prescriptive. Only after this recognition is
made is it possible to escape the contradictions
which necessarily flow from that mental act.
Once the wall is removed, the easy distinc
tions we have made for classifying and cate
gorizing and the operational definitions we
have set up for description and prediction
begin to appear meaningless. What do rational,
irrational, normal, and abnormal mean? Is set
ting fire to the NROTC shack an irrational act
in an irrational world? Or is it a gratuitous act
by men who defy simple either/or classifica
tions? Is the fact that American colleges and
universities were able to operate without inter
ruption during the Vietnam War until the draft
policy was changed (to a policy which is more
equitable, incidentally) a rational fact in an
irrational world? (There are ironic similarities
in that statement and the following: "Under
Mussolini, the trains ran on time in Italy." To
counter with the charge that we have had pro
test and demonstration on the campus is like
an Italian citizen saying, "My train from Flor
ence arrived thirteen minutes late in Rome on
Dec. 18, 1939.")

Or more pointedly, what does rational mean
when you impute that attribute to the thought:
"I should plan a normal course of life in this
kind of world."
Phenomenologically speaking, when that
wall and the concomitant mentalistic functions
which are necessary for its maintenance are re
moved, we are faced with understanding a new
world. Some of our popular products of analo
gous reasoning would break down and leave
us rather helpless in the path of uncompromis
ing data that cannot be bent to fit our view of
the world. This is what Marcuse calls the "re
opening of discourse.' And were that discourse
to occur, would the effects be any more calami
tous than those experienced by the universities
when they became partners with the govern
ment in the race to the moon? Or those felt
when graduate students were threatened with
the draft? Or those caused by recent federal
budget cuts? Or those effects that can be traced
to the introduction of drugs on campus?
Yet, none of the above events, which caused
the university so much anxiety, were put into
motion by the university. We could only react
for we have lost the ability to initiate events in
the world. This is because we have resigned
from the world.
Still, I believe a majority of students on this
campus would join with leadership from the
soon to be organized Academic Senate in a
mutual endeavor to climb that wall we have all
helped to build. I believe these students feel
there is something more valuable for this uni
versity than a two-year study of itself. I cannot
say whether there are faculty members who are
prepared to demonstrate that there may be
something more important to them than their
research or promotion or attempts to keep up
the facade of business as usual.
In any case, I would hope that it is still pos
sible to conceive of breaking our inane lock
step march to privatism and self-indulgent im
potence. Could the university set up a program
under which the student body, instead of play
ing in the ruins of European castles, would
have the option of working in the streets and
factories and corporations and government of
America? Isn't it time we admit that Stanford
Away is more important than Stanford Abroad?
Are there professors who would join us and
be willing to examine our responsibilities (and
their own) rather than the "context of our re
sponsibilities."
Are there no members of the faculty who
would be willing to stop their work and con
sider the implications of the university as an
employment agency? (Of course this would re
quire students to reassess their own motives
for obtaining a Stanford degree.) Or are we
content to suspend classes and business as
usual just for Washington's Birthday, President
Sterling's annual address, and the visits of
people like Hubert Humphrey?
The time has come when we need to tell our
administration that it is banal to travel through
the country telling our friends and alumni that
the Stanford ship, though in troubled waters,
is still steaming. And stop trying to explain the
rough going by accusing the far left and far
right. The glibness of that explanation allows
you to focus on the strength of the ship and
appeal to everyone to come aboard.
The point is that Stanford has resigned from
the rough waters by convincing itself that it has
built a sturdy ship. That allows the captain and
crew to remain insulated from the water and
they never look at it again in quite the same
way. "The only normal thing to do when the
seas get rough is to build a sturdy ship and
keep it steaming." Unfortunately, a strong ship
has nothing to do with the nature of the water
in which it steams. It just makes the people on
board feel more secure.


"To station an Associate Dean of Students between an anti-war troupe

Advice to a Stanford Senior
February 16, 1968

THE fatherly tone of these remarks made
in the light of the new Selective Service
policy is not enough to conceal a pa
thetic commentary on Stanford University, and
most universities in America. Dean Whitaker,
in this quote attributed to him by The Daily
and perhaps not representative of his entire
position, has captured the voice of intellectuals
who have resigned from the world. This resig
nation, cloaked in the kindliness of fatherhood,
is the actuality of impotence which results from
the well-reasoned attempts to ignore the con
tradictions which make the utterance and ac
ceptance of the statement possible. That voice
speaks to all of us, father and child, learned
and learner.
To examine this remark is a helpful way of
beginning to understand the sad sight of "both
ered and troubled" administrators, whose "un
easiness grew with every day that passed," try
ing to frame a University statement on drug
abuse (about three years after abuse first
began) because of "the incident at Stony
Brook." It may even help us see why adminis
trators and students alike began acting like
alarmed mother hens when an attempt at
greater equity in the draft policy interrupted
their secure little lives. It may allow us to see
why, despite all of the skills and powers of
prediction which we seek to develop here at
Stanford, we are passive, reactive agents, ap
parently incapable of initiating events in the
world. By drawing out the implications of the
Dean's timely advice, we can start to under
stand how it is we contribute to the creation
and maintenance of the conditions which make
this advice necessary.
WHAT indeed can a "normal course"
be? If it is the "only rational thing
to do in this kind of world," are we
not being asked to live normally in an abnormal
world? Isn't the proffered advice suggesting
that we act rationally in an irrational world?
Or at least, "in this kind of world," a world that
is not as we would have it? To paraphrase, we
are supposed to go ahead with business as

usual, though the world's business is most un
usual. Or in the words of the pragmatic realist
(circa 1968): "Of course this is an imperfect
world. But that is no excuse to abandon rea
son."
On the face of it, this admonition makes good
sense and is logically consistent. However, this
warning (and the above quote) are exam
ples of functional rationalization, i.e., they
have no substance. They serve to partially ac
count for the world and to enable the believer
to continue his existence. The rationality of the
statement serves the speaker. Substantively
speaking, the fact of the imperfect world and
its relationship to the use of reason, and the
combination of these two upon the speaker, is
ignored. Functional rationalization allows for
the necessary perpetuation of "this kind of
world," though, it is thought, that is what we
seek to change. Now why is this so?
To begin with, once the contradictions be
tween normal and abnormal are buried in our
minds, the critical imagination of the mind is
lost to the world. When the life of the college
dean and the graduating senior presumes its
own rationality, the life of the Selective Service
and the non-academic world of presumed irra
tionality is obviated. With this act the promise
of tension, the force of dialectics is lost to illu
sory personal resolution or mindless polariza
tion.
This is more than the bifurcation of thought
from action. It is to think and to reason from
the I-me (rational) frame of reference only
after the world, the irrational have been dis
missed a priori. To presume one's world abnor
mal and at the same time to declare the ration
ality of one's existence is to perform the mental
act that effectively removes one from any place
in that world. But more important is the fact
that such a stance causes one to forfeit the vis
ion necessary to act on such differences that
exist in the world. To close off our lives allows
for private sanity, perhaps, but little else.
(Here, a new question arises. Should the result
of closing off one's life really be described as
"sanity"?)
THE above remarks should not be con
strued as a critique of reason or objec
tivity. What I have tried to describe is
a phenomenon of entirely new dimensions.
While the distance between one's self and one's
world may be called objectivity and an ex
ample of reason, the establishment of catego
ries at the boundaries of this distance is not
objectivity. Whein the observer presumes him
self to be normal and the observed is termed
abnormal, we have a process quite unlike ob
jectivity. (Though the indoctrination of objec
tivity in the classroom undoubtedly makes the
sidestep to resignation through functional ra
tionalization much easier.)
To understand this phenomenon let us ex
amine our lives here at Stanford and explain
how each of us is capable of making and ac
cepting Whitaker's statement. Only then can
it be shown that our capacity for that is symp
tomatic of the causes for the existence of "this
kind of world." For the purpose of explication
I think it is necessaiy to separate Stanford into
two groups (a not altogether satisfying sugges
tion, but one that is recognized and encouraged
by all): the learners and the learned.
As learner, the student at Stanford goes

through some kind of horizontal development
that may be sketched roughly as follows: Com
munity Initiation (new teachers, books, ideas),
Involvement (picketing, petitions, voting, com
mittee work, tutoring, striking, etc.), Frustra
tion, Desperation, Impotence. It is also likely
that at some time in this process the learner ex
periments with drugs and love making. Never
theless, somewhere between entrance and exit,
the learner in this community terminates his
development in the formalization of a personal
normal-abnormal ethic privatism. That is, he
or she makes the conscious decision that de
spite the absurdity and unchangeability of the
world, he or she endeavor to live a rational,
meaningful, good personal life. The world is
rejected and the self is preserved into a Tarzan
like, "Me rational/it irrational" existence. At
that point we join with Dean Whitaker in the
ability to make his statement.
It is more difficult to perceive and under
stand what happens to the learned among us
since we are really not one of them. But since
my program advisers tell me I am soon to be
a learned, perhaps I can attempt a description.
There is a basic difference between learners
and the learned which makes the process of
resignation among the learned more difficult
to identify. That difference is that we (the
learners) have no responsibilities or a public
life. This allows for our retreat from the ir
rational into impotence to go undisguised,
though not unnoticed.
The learned, on the other hand, have both
formal responsibilities and public affairs which
demand of them an accounting, an effort, a
putting forth, if you will, to prove that they
have not resigned. It is in the University com
munity, however, that men of responsibility
and public affairs can best perform the same
mental act as we do and yet have it go unno
ticed. This is because the nature of the Uni
versity and their own thought within it, pro
vides them with a well developed disguise.
Thus, while both learner and learned think in
identical ways, the dissimilarities occur when
our teachers and administrators choose to ig
nore or turn away from what it is they do with
their minds in relation to their responsibilities
and public life. And that difference is truly im
portant, for the reasoned acknowledgment and
acceptance of the abnormal and irrational is
more perverse when that person who so reasons
remains in and of the world.
(This is to suggest that there is little real
support for the learners' self-righteous con
tempt for the learned when in fact the only real
difference between them is that the learned
are supposed to be in and of the world. The
fact that most of us do the same things witli
our minds, at least within the university, may
be a more useful way of explaining that 90 per
cent of us plan to go on to some sort of gradu
ate school, where we can continue the process
and be rewarded for it.)
The criticism of the learned needs to be de
tailed. Trying again to avoid confusion be
tween the problems of objectivity and the phe
nomenon I am considering, allow me to say
that the notion of a controlled situation, which
is central to objective research, presumes the
existence of an uncontrolled situation, which is
not at all central to research. This emphasis on
the controlled situation in the face of a much
larger and more complex uncontrolled situa

and teaches freshman English.
tion, also may be understood as a desire to
work with {he rational as opposed to the irra
tional. In any case, it serves as an effective
excuse for not making the uncontrolled central
to one's life as a learned.
In the larger context of the community of
the learned, however, it is less difficult to cite
examples how the learned attempt to do the
rational thing in this kind of world, how they
separate the controlled from the uncontrolled,
how they join with Dean Whitaker in disguised

campus and protest seems imminent, our fac

freedom of speech on the basis of reason. But
the concept of free speech becomes the sub

of reason, and silence prevails. Those who pro
test disruptively are tried on the basis of legal
isms and the logic of jurisprudence. 1 The moral
arguments pass by the legalistic arguments and
both learners and learned ignore each other.
And then, when the student Judicial Council
attempts to bring a halt to this pathetic non
dialogue, this gigantic irrelevancy, the admin
istration responds with concern that law has
been suspended in the campus community.
Our teachers have lost the ability to see
themselves in relation to this world, just as most

and public affairs can best perform the same
mental act as we do and yet have it go unno
ticed. This is because the nature of the Uni
versity and their own thought within it, pro
vides them with a well developed disguise.
Thus, while both learner and learned think in
identical ways, the dissimilarities occur when
our teachers and administrators choose to ig
nore or turn away from what it is they do with
their minds in relation to their responsibilities
and public life. And that difference is truly im
portant, for the reasoned acknowledgment and
acceptance of the abnormal and irrational is
more perverse when that person who so reasons
remains in and of the world.
(This is to suggest that there is little real
support for the learners' self-righteous con
tempt for the learned when in fact the only real
difference between them is that the learned
are supposed to be in and of the world. The
fact that most of us do the same things witli
our minds, at least within the university, may
be a more useful way of explaining that 90 per
cent of us plan to go on to some sort of gradu
ate school, where we can continue the process
and be rewarded for it.)
The criticism of the learned needs to be de
tailed. Trying again to avoid confusion be
tween the problems of objectivity and the phe
nomenon I am considering, allow me to say
that the notion of a controlled situation, which
is central to objective research, presumes the
existence of an uncontrolled situation, which is
not at all central to research. This emphasis on
the controlled situation in the face of a much
larger and more complex uncontrolled situa

tion, also may be understood as a desire to
work with {he rational as opposed to the irra
tional. In any case, it serves as an effective
excuse for not making the uncontrolled central
to one's life as a learned.
In the larger context of the community of
the learned, however, it is less difficult to cite
examples how the learned attempt to do the
rational thing in this kind of world, how they
separate the controlled from the uncontrolled,
how they join with Dean Whitaker in disguised
resignation. When CIA interviewers visit the
campus and protest seems imminent, our fac
ulty and administration implore us to uphold
freedom of speech on the basis of reason. But
the concept of free speech becomes the sub
stitute for reason, it precludes any further use
of reason, and silence prevails. Those who pro
test disruptively are tried on the basis of legal
isms and the logic of jurisprudence. 1 The moral
arguments pass by the legalistic arguments and
both learners and learned ignore each other.
And then, when the student Judicial Council
attempts to bring a halt to this pathetic non
dialogue, this gigantic irrelevancy, the admin
istration responds with concern that law has
been suspended in the campus community.
Our teachers have lost the ability to see
themselves in relation to this world, just as most
of us have. But the implications are so much
greater when they demonstrate this inability.
Harvard, Oberlin, and almost every college in
the Bay Area which has experienced disruption
due to the war or the condition of the black
man in America, have seen fit to take time off
from business as usual to discuss these complex
issues as an entire community. On this campus
there are students and administrators who have
been trying since November to get major mem
bers of the faculty and administration to sit
down for just one evening and discuss the prob
lem of CIA recruitment on campus and they
have never been able to arrange a time 'con
venient for everyone." (If you believe this issue
has been resolved, see The New Republic

article by Henry Commager reprinted on
page 2.)
As crises arise and groups become more and
more polarized, the university administration
continues to maintain itself by hurling one or
two persons with some sort of charisma into
the breach of conflict in the hope of preserving
business as usual. These individuals should not
be expected to solve all of the problems we
have created and chosen to ignore. To station
an Associate Dean of Students between an
anti-war street troupe and the Army ROTC
cadets standing at attention on a soccer field is
not a parody on the theatre of absurd. Nor
should it be construed as any way to run a uni
versity. It just happens to be the result of in
stitutionalized resignation, where Johnny-on
the-spot replaces the man of thought.
THE way in which we now think seeks to
place a wall between us and the 'world.
There is, however, a leak in that wall
and a well chosen thumb here or there is not
going to keep out "this kind of world.' We must
begin to scale that wall to see what is on the
other side. The invocation of university policy
regardless of its relevance and the use of charis
matic figures and student police to prevent dis
ruption are the most obvious signs that our
teachers have given up. They join those of us
who have lost even the energy to force air
across our vocal cords to whisper "Stop."
What will it mean for Stanford to climb that
wall? We must begin by acknowledging the
wall as a creation of our minds, an illusory
mentalistic barrier that has become normative
and prescriptive. Only after this recognition is
made is it possible to escape the contradictions
which necessarily flow from that mental act.
Once the wall is removed, the easy distinc
tions we have made for classifying and cate
gorizing and the operational definitions we
have set up for description and prediction
begin to appear meaningless. What do rational,
irrational, normal, and abnormal mean? Is set
ting fire to the NROTC shack an irrational act
in an irrational world? Or is it a gratuitous act
by men who defy simple either/or classifica
tions? Is the fact that American colleges and
universities were able to operate without inter
ruption during the Vietnam War until the draft
policy was changed (to a policy which is more
equitable, incidentally) a rational fact in an
irrational world? (There are ironic similarities
in that statement and the following: "Under
Mussolini, the trains ran on time in Italy." To
counter with the charge that we have had pro
test and demonstration on the campus is like
an Italian citizen saying, "My train from Flor
ence arrived thirteen minutes late in Rome on
Dec. 18, 1939.")

Or more pointedly, what does rational mean
when you impute that attribute to the thought:
"I should plan a normal course of life in this
kind of world."
Phenomenologically speaking, when that
wall and the concomitant mentalistic functions
which are necessary for its maintenance are re
moved, we are faced with understanding a new
world. Some of our popular products of analo
gous reasoning would break down and leave
us rather helpless in the path of uncompromis
ing data that cannot be bent to fit our view of
the world. This is what Marcuse calls the "re
opening of discourse.' And were that discourse
to occur, would the effects be any more calami
tous than those experienced by the universities
when they became partners with the govern
ment in the race to the moon? Or those felt
when graduate students were threatened with
the draft? Or those caused by recent federal
budget cuts? Or those effects that can be traced
to the introduction of drugs on campus?
Yet, none of the above events, which caused
the university so much anxiety, were put into
motion by the university. We could only react
for we have lost the ability to initiate events in
the world. This is because we have resigned
from the world.
Still, I believe a majority of students on this
campus would join with leadership from the
soon to be organized Academic Senate in a
mutual endeavor to climb that wall we have all
helped to build. I believe these students feel
there is something more valuable for this uni
versity than a two-year study of itself. I cannot
say whether there are faculty members who are
prepared to demonstrate that there may be
something more important to them than their
research or promotion or attempts to keep up
the facade of business as usual.
In any case, I would hope that it is still pos
sible to conceive of breaking our inane lock
step march to privatism and self-indulgent im
potence. Could the university set up a program
under which the student body, instead of play
ing in the ruins of European castles, would
have the option of working in the streets and
factories and corporations and government of
America? Isn't it time we admit that Stanford
Away is more important than Stanford Abroad?
Are there professors who would join us and
be willing to examine our responsibilities (and
their own) rather than the "context of our re
sponsibilities."
Are there no members of the faculty who
would be willing to stop their work and con
sider the implications of the university as an
employment agency? (Of course this would re
quire students to reassess their own motives
for obtaining a Stanford degree.) Or are we
content to suspend classes and business as
usual just for Washington's Birthday, President
Sterling's annual address, and the visits of
people like Hubert Humphrey?
The time has come when we need to tell our
administration that it is banal to travel through
the country telling our friends and alumni that
the Stanford ship, though in troubled waters,
is still steaming. And stop trying to explain the
rough going by accusing the far left and far
right. The glibness of that explanation allows
you to focus on the strength of the ship and
appeal to everyone to come aboard.
The point is that Stanford has resigned from
the rough waters by convincing itself that it has
built a sturdy ship. That allows the captain and
crew to remain insulated from the water and
they never look at it again in quite the same
way. "The only normal thing to do when the
seas get rough is to build a sturdy ship and
keep it steaming." Unfortunately, a strong ship
has nothing to do with the nature of the water
in which it steams. It just makes the people on
board feel more secure.

Advice to a Stanford Senior
February 16, 1968

THE fatherly tone of these remarks made
in the light of the new Selective Service
policy is not enough to conceal a pa
thetic commentary on Stanford University, and
most universities in America. Dean Whitaker,
in this quote attributed to him by The Daily
and perhaps not representative of his entire
position, has captured the voice of intellectuals
who have resigned from the world. This resig
nation, cloaked in the kindliness of fatherhood,
is the actuality of impotence which results from
the well-reasoned attempts to ignore the con
tradictions which make the utterance and ac
ceptance of the statement possible. That voice
speaks to all of us, father and child, learned
and learner.
To examine this remark is a helpful way of
beginning to understand the sad sight of "both
ered and troubled" administrators, whose "un
easiness grew with every day that passed," try
ing to frame a University statement on drug
abuse (about three years after abuse first
began) because of "the incident at Stony
Brook." It may even help us see why adminis
trators and students alike began acting like
alarmed mother hens when an attempt at
greater equity in the draft policy interrupted
their secure little lives. It may allow us to see
why, despite all of the skills and powers of
prediction which we seek to develop here at
Stanford, we are passive, reactive agents, ap
parently incapable of initiating events in the
world. By drawing out the implications of the
Dean's timely advice, we can start to under
stand how it is we contribute to the creation
and maintenance of the conditions which make
this advice necessary.
WHAT indeed can a "normal course"
be? If it is the "only rational thing
to do in this kind of world," are we
not being asked to live normally in an abnormal
world? Isn't the proffered advice suggesting
that we act rationally in an irrational world?
Or at least, "in this kind of world," a world that
is not as we would have it? To paraphrase, we
are supposed to go ahead with business as

usual, though the world's business is most un
usual. Or in the words of the pragmatic realist
(circa 1968): "Of course this is an imperfect
world. But that is no excuse to abandon rea
son."
On the face of it, this admonition makes good
sense and is logically consistent. However, this
warning (and the above quote) are exam
ples of functional rationalization, i.e., they
have no substance. They serve to partially ac
count for the world and to enable the believer
to continue his existence. The rationality of the
statement serves the speaker. Substantively
speaking, the fact of the imperfect world and
its relationship to the use of reason, and the
combination of these two upon the speaker, is
ignored. Functional rationalization allows for
the necessary perpetuation of "this kind of
world," though, it is thought, that is what we
seek to change. Now why is this so?
To begin with, once the contradictions be
tween normal and abnormal are buried in our
minds, the critical imagination of the mind is
lost to the world. When the life of the college
dean and the graduating senior presumes its
own rationality, the life of the Selective Service
and the non-academic world of presumed irra
tionality is obviated. With this act the promise
of tension, the force of dialectics is lost to illu
sory personal resolution or mindless polariza
tion.
This is more than the bifurcation of thought
from action. It is to think and to reason from
the I-me (rational) frame of reference only
after the world, the irrational have been dis
missed a priori. To presume one's world abnor
mal and at the same time to declare the ration
ality of one's existence is to perform the mental
act that effectively removes one from any place
in that world. But more important is the fact
that such a stance causes one to forfeit the vis
ion necessary to act on such differences that
exist in the world. To close off our lives allows
for private sanity, perhaps, but little else.
(Here, a new question arises. Should the result
of closing off one's life really be described as
"sanity"?)
THE above remarks should not be con
strued as a critique of reason or objec
tivity. What I have tried to describe is
a phenomenon of entirely new dimensions.
While the distance between one's self and one's
world may be called objectivity and an ex
ample of reason, the establishment of catego
ries at the boundaries of this distance is not
objectivity. Whein the observer presumes him
self to be normal and the observed is termed
abnormal, we have a process quite unlike ob
jectivity. (Though the indoctrination of objec
tivity in the classroom undoubtedly makes the
sidestep to resignation through functional ra
tionalization much easier.)
To understand this phenomenon let us ex
amine our lives here at Stanford and explain
how each of us is capable of making and ac
cepting Whitaker's statement. Only then can
it be shown that our capacity for that is symp
tomatic of the causes for the existence of "this
kind of world." For the purpose of explication
I think it is necessaiy to separate Stanford into
two groups (a not altogether satisfying sugges
tion, but one that is recognized and encouraged
by all): the learners and the learned.
As learner, the student at Stanford goes

through some kind of horizontal development
that may be sketched roughly as follows: Com
munity Initiation (new teachers, books, ideas),
Involvement (picketing, petitions, voting, com
mittee work, tutoring, striking, etc.), Frustra
tion, Desperation, Impotence. It is also likely
that at some time in this process the learner ex
periments with drugs and love making. Never
theless, somewhere between entrance and exit,
the learner in this community terminates his
development in the formalization of a personal
normal-abnormal ethic privatism. That is, he
or she makes the conscious decision that de
spite the absurdity and unchangeability of the
world, he or she endeavor to live a rational,
meaningful, good personal life. The world is
rejected and the self is preserved into a Tarzan
like, "Me rational/it irrational" existence. At
that point we join with Dean Whitaker in the
ability to make his statement.
It is more difficult to perceive and under
stand what happens to the learned among us
since we are really not one of them. But since
my program advisers tell me I am soon to be
a learned, perhaps I can attempt a description.
There is a basic difference between learners
and the learned which makes the process of
resignation among the learned more difficult
to identify. That difference is that we (the
learners) have no responsibilities or a public
life. This allows for our retreat from the ir
rational into impotence to go undisguised,
though not unnoticed.
The learned, on the other hand, have both
formal responsibilities and public affairs which
demand of them an accounting, an effort, a
putting forth, if you will, to prove that they
have not resigned. It is in the University com
munity, however, that men of responsibility
and public affairs can best perform the same
mental act as we do and yet have it go unno
ticed. This is because the nature of the Uni
versity and their own thought within it, pro
vides them with a well developed disguise.
Thus, while both learner and learned think in
identical ways, the dissimilarities occur when
our teachers and administrators choose to ig
nore or turn away from what it is they do with
their minds in relation to their responsibilities
and public life. And that difference is truly im
portant, for the reasoned acknowledgment and
acceptance of the abnormal and irrational is
more perverse when that person who so reasons
remains in and of the world.
(This is to suggest that there is little real
support for the learners' self-righteous con

and be rewarded for it.)

kind of world." For the purpose of explication
I think it is necessaiy to separate Stanford into
two groups (a not altogether satisfying sugges
tion, but one that is recognized and encouraged
by all): the learners and the learned.
As learner, the student at Stanford goes

through some kind of horizontal development
that may be sketched roughly as follows: Com
munity Initiation (new teachers, books, ideas),
Involvement (picketing, petitions, voting, com
mittee work, tutoring, striking, etc.), Frustra
tion, Desperation, Impotence. It is also likely
that at some time in this process the learner ex
periments with drugs and love making. Never
theless, somewhere between entrance and exit,
the learner in this community terminates his
development in the formalization of a personal
normal-abnormal ethic privatism. That is, he
or she makes the conscious decision that de
spite the absurdity and unchangeability of the
world, he or she endeavor to live a rational,
meaningful, good personal life. The world is
rejected and the self is preserved into a Tarzan
like, "Me rational/it irrational" existence. At
that point we join with Dean Whitaker in the
ability to make his statement.
It is more difficult to perceive and under
stand what happens to the learned among us
since we are really not one of them. But since
my program advisers tell me I am soon to be
a learned, perhaps I can attempt a description.
There is a basic difference between learners
and the learned which makes the process of
resignation among the learned more difficult
to identify. That difference is that we (the
learners) have no responsibilities or a public
life. This allows for our retreat from the ir
rational into impotence to go undisguised,
though not unnoticed.
The learned, on the other hand, have both
formal responsibilities and public affairs which
demand of them an accounting, an effort, a
putting forth, if you will, to prove that they
have not resigned. It is in the University com
munity, however, that men of responsibility
and public affairs can best perform the same
mental act as we do and yet have it go unno
ticed. This is because the nature of the Uni
versity and their own thought within it, pro
vides them with a well developed disguise.
Thus, while both learner and learned think in
identical ways, the dissimilarities occur when
our teachers and administrators choose to ig
nore or turn away from what it is they do with
their minds in relation to their responsibilities
and public life. And that difference is truly im
portant, for the reasoned acknowledgment and
acceptance of the abnormal and irrational is
more perverse when that person who so reasons
remains in and of the world.
(This is to suggest that there is little real
support for the learners' self-righteous con
tempt for the learned when in fact the only real
difference between them is that the learned
are supposed to be in and of the world. The
fact that most of us do the same things witli
our minds, at least within the university, may
be a more useful way of explaining that 90 per
cent of us plan to go on to some sort of gradu
ate school, where we can continue the process
and be rewarded for it.)
The criticism of the learned needs to be de
tailed. Trying again to avoid confusion be
tween the problems of objectivity and the phe
nomenon I am considering, allow me to say
that the notion of a controlled situation, which
is central to objective research, presumes the
existence of an uncontrolled situation, which is
not at all central to research. This emphasis on
the controlled situation in the face of a much
larger and more complex uncontrolled situa

and teaches freshman English.
tion, also may be understood as a desire to
work with {he rational as opposed to the irra
tional. In any case, it serves as an effective
excuse for not making the uncontrolled central
to one's life as a learned.
In the larger context of the community of
the learned, however, it is less difficult to cite
examples how the learned attempt to do the
rational thing in this kind of world, how they
separate the controlled from the uncontrolled,
how they join with Dean Whitaker in disguised
resignation. When CIA interviewers visit the
campus and protest seems imminent, our fac
ulty and administration implore us to uphold
freedom of speech on the basis of reason. But
the concept of free speech becomes the sub
stitute for reason, it precludes any further use
of reason, and silence prevails. Those who pro
test disruptively are tried on the basis of legal
isms and the logic of jurisprudence. 1 The moral
arguments pass by the legalistic arguments and
both learners and learned ignore each other.
And then, when the student Judicial Council
attempts to bring a halt to this pathetic non
dialogue, this gigantic irrelevancy, the admin
istration responds with concern that law has
been suspended in the campus community.
Our teachers have lost the ability to see
themselves in relation to this world, just as most
of us have. But the implications are so much
greater when they demonstrate this inability.
Harvard, Oberlin, and almost every college in
the Bay Area which has experienced disruption
due to the war or the condition of the black
man in America, have seen fit to take time off
from business as usual to discuss these complex
issues as an entire community. On this campus
there are students and administrators who have
been trying since November to get major mem
bers of the faculty and administration to sit
down for just one evening and discuss the prob
lem of CIA recruitment on campus and they
have never been able to arrange a time 'con
venient for everyone." (If you believe this issue
has been resolved, see The New Republic

article by Henry Commager reprinted on
page 2.)
As crises arise and groups become more and
more polarized, the university administration
continues to maintain itself by hurling one or
two persons with some sort of charisma into
the breach of conflict in the hope of preserving
business as usual. These individuals should not
be expected to solve all of the problems we
have created and chosen to ignore. To station
an Associate Dean of Students between an
anti-war street troupe and the Army ROTC
cadets standing at attention on a soccer field is
not a parody on the theatre of absurd. Nor
should it be construed as any way to run a uni
versity. It just happens to be the result of in
stitutionalized resignation, where Johnny-on
the-spot replaces the man of thought.
THE way in which we now think seeks to
place a wall between us and the 'world.
There is, however, a leak in that wall
and a well chosen thumb here or there is not
going to keep out "this kind of world.' We must
begin to scale that wall to see what is on the
other side. The invocation of university policy
regardless of its relevance and the use of charis
matic figures and student police to prevent dis
ruption are the most obvious signs that our
teachers have given up. They join those of us
who have lost even the energy to force air
across our vocal cords to whisper "Stop."
What will it mean for Stanford to climb that
wall? We must begin by acknowledging the
wall as a creation of our minds, an illusory
mentalistic barrier that has become normative
and prescriptive. Only after this recognition is
made is it possible to escape the contradictions
which necessarily flow from that mental act.
Once the wall is removed, the easy distinc
tions we have made for classifying and cate
gorizing and the operational definitions we
have set up for description and prediction
begin to appear meaningless. What do rational,
irrational, normal, and abnormal mean? Is set
ting fire to the NROTC shack an irrational act
in an irrational world? Or is it a gratuitous act
by men who defy simple either/or classifica
tions? Is the fact that American colleges and
universities were able to operate without inter
ruption during the Vietnam War until the draft
policy was changed (to a policy which is more
equitable, incidentally) a rational fact in an
irrational world? (There are ironic similarities
in that statement and the following: "Under
Mussolini, the trains ran on time in Italy." To
counter with the charge that we have had pro
test and demonstration on the campus is like
an Italian citizen saying, "My train from Flor
ence arrived thirteen minutes late in Rome on
Dec. 18, 1939.")

Or more pointedly, what does rational mean
when you impute that attribute to the thought:
"I should plan a normal course of life in this
kind of world."
Phenomenologically speaking, when that
wall and the concomitant mentalistic functions
which are necessary for its maintenance are re
moved, we are faced with understanding a new
world. Some of our popular products of analo
gous reasoning would break down and leave
us rather helpless in the path of uncompromis
ing data that cannot be bent to fit our view of
the world. This is what Marcuse calls the "re
opening of discourse.' And were that discourse
to occur, would the effects be any more calami
tous than those experienced by the universities
when they became partners with the govern
ment in the race to the moon? Or those felt
when graduate students were threatened with
the draft? Or those caused by recent federal
budget cuts? Or those effects that can be traced
to the introduction of drugs on campus?
Yet, none of the above events, which caused
the university so much anxiety, were put into
motion by the university. We could only react
for we have lost the ability to initiate events in
the world. This is because we have resigned
from the world.
Still, I believe a majority of students on this
campus would join with leadership from the
soon to be organized Academic Senate in a
mutual endeavor to climb that wall we have all
helped to build. I believe these students feel
there is something more valuable for this uni
versity than a two-year study of itself. I cannot
say whether there are faculty members who are
prepared to demonstrate that there may be
something more important to them than their
research or promotion or attempts to keep up
the facade of business as usual.
In any case, I would hope that it is still pos
sible to conceive of breaking our inane lock
step march to privatism and self-indulgent im
potence. Could the university set up a program
under which the student body, instead of play
ing in the ruins of European castles, would
have the option of working in the streets and
factories and corporations and government of
America? Isn't it time we admit that Stanford
Away is more important than Stanford Abroad?
Are there professors who would join us and
be willing to examine our responsibilities (and
their own) rather than the "context of our re
sponsibilities."
Are there no members of the faculty who
would be willing to stop their work and con
sider the implications of the university as an
employment agency? (Of course this would re
quire students to reassess their own motives
for obtaining a Stanford degree.) Or are we
content to suspend classes and business as
usual just for Washington's Birthday, President
Sterling's annual address, and the visits of
people like Hubert Humphrey?
The time has come when we need to tell our
administration that it is banal to travel through
the country telling our friends and alumni that
the Stanford ship, though in troubled waters,
is still steaming. And stop trying to explain the
rough going by accusing the far left and far
right. The glibness of that explanation allows
you to focus on the strength of the ship and
appeal to everyone to come aboard.
The point is that Stanford has resigned from
the rough waters by convincing itself that it has
built a sturdy ship. That allows the captain and
crew to remain insulated from the water and
they never look at it again in quite the same
way. "The only normal thing to do when the
seas get rough is to build a sturdy ship and
keep it steaming." Unfortunately, a strong ship
has nothing to do with the nature of the water
in which it steams. It just makes the people on
board feel more secure.

Advice to a Stanford Senior
February 16, 1968

THE fatherly tone of these remarks made
in the light of the new Selective Service
policy is not enough to conceal a pa
thetic commentary on Stanford University, and
most universities in America. Dean Whitaker,
in this quote attributed to him by The Daily
and perhaps not representative of his entire
position, has captured the voice of intellectuals
who have resigned from the world. This resig
nation, cloaked in the kindliness of fatherhood,
is the actuality of impotence which results from
the well-reasoned attempts to ignore the con
tradictions which make the utterance and ac
ceptance of the statement possible. That voice
speaks to all of us, father and child, learned
and learner.
To examine this remark is a helpful way of
beginning to understand the sad sight of "both
ered and troubled" administrators, whose "un
easiness grew with every day that passed," try
ing to frame a University statement on drug
abuse (about three years after abuse first
began) because of "the incident at Stony
Brook." It may even help us see why adminis
trators and students alike began acting like
alarmed mother hens when an attempt at
greater equity in the draft policy interrupted
their secure little lives. It may allow us to see
why, despite all of the skills and powers of
prediction which we seek to develop here at
Stanford, we are passive, reactive agents, ap
parently incapable of initiating events in the
world. By drawing out the implications of the
Dean's timely advice, we can start to under
stand how it is we contribute to the creation
and maintenance of the conditions which make
this advice necessary.
WHAT indeed can a "normal course"
be? If it is the "only rational thing
to do in this kind of world," are we
not being asked to live normally in an abnormal
world? Isn't the proffered advice suggesting
that we act rationally in an irrational world?
Or at least, "in this kind of world," a world that
is not as we would have it? To paraphrase, we
are supposed to go ahead with business as

usual, though the world's business is most un
usual. Or in the words of the pragmatic realist
(circa 1968): "Of course this is an imperfect
world. But that is no excuse to abandon rea
son."
On the face of it, this admonition makes good
sense and is logically consistent. However, this
warning (and the above quote) are exam
ples of functional rationalization, i.e., they
have no substance. They serve to partially ac
count for the world and to enable the believer
to continue his existence. The rationality of the
statement serves the speaker. Substantively
speaking, the fact of the imperfect world and
its relationship to the use of reason, and the
combination of these two upon the speaker, is
ignored. Functional rationalization allows for
the necessary perpetuation of "this kind of
world," though, it is thought, that is what we
seek to change. Now why is this so?
To begin with, once the contradictions be
tween normal and abnormal are buried in our
minds, the critical imagination of the mind is
lost to the world. When the life of the college
dean and the graduating senior presumes its
own rationality, the life of the Selective Service
and the non-academic world of presumed irra
tionality is obviated. With this act the promise
of tension, the force of dialectics is lost to illu
sory personal resolution or mindless polariza
tion.
This is more than the bifurcation of thought
from action. It is to think and to reason from
the I-me (rational) frame of reference only
after the world, the irrational have been dis
missed a priori. To presume one's world abnor
mal and at the same time to declare the ration
ality of one's existence is to perform the mental
act that effectively removes one from any place
in that world. But more important is the fact
that such a stance causes one to forfeit the vis
ion necessary to act on such differences that
exist in the world. To close off our lives allows
for private sanity, perhaps, but little else.
(Here, a new question arises. Should the result
of closing off one's life really be described as
"sanity"?)
THE above remarks should not be con
strued as a critique of reason or objec
tivity. What I have tried to describe is
a phenomenon of entirely new dimensions.
While the distance between one's self and one's
world may be called objectivity and an ex
ample of reason, the establishment of catego
ries at the boundaries of this distance is not
objectivity. Whein the observer presumes him
self to be normal and the observed is termed
abnormal, we have a process quite unlike ob
jectivity. (Though the indoctrination of objec
tivity in the classroom undoubtedly makes the
sidestep to resignation through functional ra
tionalization much easier.)
To understand this phenomenon let us ex
amine our lives here at Stanford and explain
how each of us is capable of making and ac
cepting Whitaker's statement. Only then can
it be shown that our capacity for that is symp
tomatic of the causes for the existence of "this
kind of world." For the purpose of explication
I think it is necessaiy to separate Stanford into
two groups (a not altogether satisfying sugges
tion, but one that is recognized and encouraged
by all): the learners and the learned.
As learner, the student at Stanford goes

through some kind of horizontal development
that may be sketched roughly as follows: Com
munity Initiation (new teachers, books, ideas),
Involvement (picketing, petitions, voting, com
mittee work, tutoring, striking, etc.), Frustra
tion, Desperation, Impotence. It is also likely
that at some time in this process the learner ex
periments with drugs and love making. Never
theless, somewhere between entrance and exit,
the learner in this community terminates his
development in the formalization of a personal
normal-abnormal ethic privatism. That is, he
or she makes the conscious decision that de
spite the absurdity and unchangeability of the
world, he or she endeavor to live a rational,
meaningful, good personal life. The world is
rejected and the self is preserved into a Tarzan
like, "Me rational/it irrational" existence. At
that point we join with Dean Whitaker in the
ability to make his statement.
It is more difficult to perceive and under

lost to the world. When the life of the college
dean and the graduating senior presumes its
own rationality, the life of the Selective Service
and the non-academic world of presumed irra
tionality is obviated. With this act the promise
of tension, the force of dialectics is lost to illu
sory personal resolution or mindless polariza
tion.
This is more than the bifurcation of thought
from action. It is to think and to reason from
the I-me (rational) frame of reference only
after the world, the irrational have been dis
missed a priori. To presume one's world abnor
mal and at the same time to declare the ration
ality of one's existence is to perform the mental
act that effectively removes one from any place
in that world. But more important is the fact
that such a stance causes one to forfeit the vis
ion necessary to act on such differences that
exist in the world. To close off our lives allows
for private sanity, perhaps, but little else.
(Here, a new question arises. Should the result
of closing off one's life really be described as
"sanity"?)
THE above remarks should not be con
strued as a critique of reason or objec
tivity. What I have tried to describe is
a phenomenon of entirely new dimensions.
While the distance between one's self and one's
world may be called objectivity and an ex
ample of reason, the establishment of catego
ries at the boundaries of this distance is not
objectivity. Whein the observer presumes him
self to be normal and the observed is termed
abnormal, we have a process quite unlike ob
jectivity. (Though the indoctrination of objec
tivity in the classroom undoubtedly makes the
sidestep to resignation through functional ra
tionalization much easier.)
To understand this phenomenon let us ex
amine our lives here at Stanford and explain
how each of us is capable of making and ac
cepting Whitaker's statement. Only then can
it be shown that our capacity for that is symp
tomatic of the causes for the existence of "this
kind of world." For the purpose of explication
I think it is necessaiy to separate Stanford into
two groups (a not altogether satisfying sugges
tion, but one that is recognized and encouraged
by all): the learners and the learned.
As learner, the student at Stanford goes

through some kind of horizontal development
that may be sketched roughly as follows: Com
munity Initiation (new teachers, books, ideas),
Involvement (picketing, petitions, voting, com
mittee work, tutoring, striking, etc.), Frustra
tion, Desperation, Impotence. It is also likely
that at some time in this process the learner ex
periments with drugs and love making. Never
theless, somewhere between entrance and exit,
the learner in this community terminates his
development in the formalization of a personal
normal-abnormal ethic privatism. That is, he
or she makes the conscious decision that de
spite the absurdity and unchangeability of the
world, he or she endeavor to live a rational,
meaningful, good personal life. The world is
rejected and the self is preserved into a Tarzan
like, "Me rational/it irrational" existence. At
that point we join with Dean Whitaker in the
ability to make his statement.
It is more difficult to perceive and under
stand what happens to the learned among us
since we are really not one of them. But since
my program advisers tell me I am soon to be
a learned, perhaps I can attempt a description.
There is a basic difference between learners
and the learned which makes the process of
resignation among the learned more difficult
to identify. That difference is that we (the
learners) have no responsibilities or a public
life. This allows for our retreat from the ir
rational into impotence to go undisguised,
though not unnoticed.
The learned, on the other hand, have both
formal responsibilities and public affairs which
demand of them an accounting, an effort, a
putting forth, if you will, to prove that they
have not resigned. It is in the University com
munity, however, that men of responsibility
and public affairs can best perform the same
mental act as we do and yet have it go unno
ticed. This is because the nature of the Uni
versity and their own thought within it, pro
vides them with a well developed disguise.
Thus, while both learner and learned think in
identical ways, the dissimilarities occur when
our teachers and administrators choose to ig
nore or turn away from what it is they do with
their minds in relation to their responsibilities
and public life. And that difference is truly im
portant, for the reasoned acknowledgment and
acceptance of the abnormal and irrational is
more perverse when that person who so reasons
remains in and of the world.
(This is to suggest that there is little real
support for the learners' self-righteous con
tempt for the learned when in fact the only real
difference between them is that the learned
are supposed to be in and of the world. The
fact that most of us do the same things witli
our minds, at least within the university, may
be a more useful way of explaining that 90 per
cent of us plan to go on to some sort of gradu
ate school, where we can continue the process
and be rewarded for it.)
The criticism of the learned needs to be de
tailed. Trying again to avoid confusion be
tween the problems of objectivity and the phe
nomenon I am considering, allow me to say
that the notion of a controlled situation, which
is central to objective research, presumes the
existence of an uncontrolled situation, which is
not at all central to research. This emphasis on
the controlled situation in the face of a much
larger and more complex uncontrolled situa

and teaches freshman English.
tion, also may be understood as a desire to
work with {he rational as opposed to the irra
tional. In any case, it serves as an effective
excuse for not making the uncontrolled central
to one's life as a learned.
In the larger context of the community of
the learned, however, it is less difficult to cite
examples how the learned attempt to do the
rational thing in this kind of world, how they
separate the controlled from the uncontrolled,
how they join with Dean Whitaker in disguised
resignation. When CIA interviewers visit the
campus and protest seems imminent, our fac
ulty and administration implore us to uphold
freedom of speech on the basis of reason. But
the concept of free speech becomes the sub
stitute for reason, it precludes any further use
of reason, and silence prevails. Those who pro
test disruptively are tried on the basis of legal
isms and the logic of jurisprudence. 1 The moral
arguments pass by the legalistic arguments and
both learners and learned ignore each other.
And then, when the student Judicial Council
attempts to bring a halt to this pathetic non
dialogue, this gigantic irrelevancy, the admin
istration responds with concern that law has
been suspended in the campus community.
Our teachers have lost the ability to see
themselves in relation to this world, just as most
of us have. But the implications are so much
greater when they demonstrate this inability.
Harvard, Oberlin, and almost every college in
the Bay Area which has experienced disruption
due to the war or the condition of the black
man in America, have seen fit to take time off
from business as usual to discuss these complex
issues as an entire community. On this campus
there are students and administrators who have
been trying since November to get major mem
bers of the faculty and administration to sit
down for just one evening and discuss the prob
lem of CIA recruitment on campus and they
have never been able to arrange a time 'con
venient for everyone." (If you believe this issue
has been resolved, see The New Republic

article by Henry Commager reprinted on
page 2.)
As crises arise and groups become more and
more polarized, the university administration
continues to maintain itself by hurling one or
two persons with some sort of charisma into
the breach of conflict in the hope of preserving
business as usual. These individuals should not
be expected to solve all of the problems we
have created and chosen to ignore. To station
an Associate Dean of Students between an
anti-war street troupe and the Army ROTC
cadets standing at attention on a soccer field is
not a parody on the theatre of absurd. Nor
should it be construed as any way to run a uni
versity. It just happens to be the result of in
stitutionalized resignation, where Johnny-on
the-spot replaces the man of thought.
THE way in which we now think seeks to
place a wall between us and the 'world.
There is, however, a leak in that wall
and a well chosen thumb here or there is not
going to keep out "this kind of world.' We must
begin to scale that wall to see what is on the
other side. The invocation of university policy
regardless of its relevance and the use of charis
matic figures and student police to prevent dis
ruption are the most obvious signs that our
teachers have given up. They join those of us
who have lost even the energy to force air
across our vocal cords to whisper "Stop."
What will it mean for Stanford to climb that
wall? We must begin by acknowledging the
wall as a creation of our minds, an illusory
mentalistic barrier that has become normative
and prescriptive. Only after this recognition is
made is it possible to escape the contradictions
which necessarily flow from that mental act.
Once the wall is removed, the easy distinc
tions we have made for classifying and cate
gorizing and the operational definitions we
have set up for description and prediction
begin to appear meaningless. What do rational,
irrational, normal, and abnormal mean? Is set
ting fire to the NROTC shack an irrational act
in an irrational world? Or is it a gratuitous act
by men who defy simple either/or classifica
tions? Is the fact that American colleges and
universities were able to operate without inter
ruption during the Vietnam War until the draft
policy was changed (to a policy which is more
equitable, incidentally) a rational fact in an
irrational world? (There are ironic similarities
in that statement and the following: "Under
Mussolini, the trains ran on time in Italy." To
counter with the charge that we have had pro
test and demonstration on the campus is like
an Italian citizen saying, "My train from Flor
ence arrived thirteen minutes late in Rome on
Dec. 18, 1939.")

Or more pointedly, what does rational mean
when you impute that attribute to the thought:
"I should plan a normal course of life in this
kind of world."
Phenomenologically speaking, when that
wall and the concomitant mentalistic functions
which are necessary for its maintenance are re
moved, we are faced with understanding a new
world. Some of our popular products of analo
gous reasoning would break down and leave
us rather helpless in the path of uncompromis
ing data that cannot be bent to fit our view of
the world. This is what Marcuse calls the "re
opening of discourse.' And were that discourse
to occur, would the effects be any more calami
tous than those experienced by the universities
when they became partners with the govern
ment in the race to the moon? Or those felt
when graduate students were threatened with
the draft? Or those caused by recent federal
budget cuts? Or those effects that can be traced
to the introduction of drugs on campus?
Yet, none of the above events, which caused
the university so much anxiety, were put into
motion by the university. We could only react
for we have lost the ability to initiate events in
the world. This is because we have resigned
from the world.
Still, I believe a majority of students on this
campus would join with leadership from the
soon to be organized Academic Senate in a
mutual endeavor to climb that wall we have all
helped to build. I believe these students feel
there is something more valuable for this uni
versity than a two-year study of itself. I cannot
say whether there are faculty members who are
prepared to demonstrate that there may be
something more important to them than their
research or promotion or attempts to keep up
the facade of business as usual.
In any case, I would hope that it is still pos
sible to conceive of breaking our inane lock
step march to privatism and self-indulgent im
potence. Could the university set up a program
under which the student body, instead of play
ing in the ruins of European castles, would
have the option of working in the streets and
factories and corporations and government of
America? Isn't it time we admit that Stanford
Away is more important than Stanford Abroad?
Are there professors who would join us and
be willing to examine our responsibilities (and
their own) rather than the "context of our re
sponsibilities."
Are there no members of the faculty who
would be willing to stop their work and con
sider the implications of the university as an
employment agency? (Of course this would re
quire students to reassess their own motives
for obtaining a Stanford degree.) Or are we
content to suspend classes and business as
usual just for Washington's Birthday, President
Sterling's annual address, and the visits of
people like Hubert Humphrey?
The time has come when we need to tell our
administration that it is banal to travel through
the country telling our friends and alumni that
the Stanford ship, though in troubled waters,
is still steaming. And stop trying to explain the
rough going by accusing the far left and far
right. The glibness of that explanation allows
you to focus on the strength of the ship and
appeal to everyone to come aboard.
The point is that Stanford has resigned from
the rough waters by convincing itself that it has
built a sturdy ship. That allows the captain and
crew to remain insulated from the water and
they never look at it again in quite the same
way. "The only normal thing to do when the
seas get rough is to build a sturdy ship and
keep it steaming." Unfortunately, a strong ship
has nothing to do with the nature of the water
in which it steams. It just makes the people on
board feel more secure.

Advice to a Stanford Senior
February 16, 1968

THE fatherly tone of these remarks made
in the light of the new Selective Service
policy is not enough to conceal a pa
thetic commentary on Stanford University, and
most universities in America. Dean Whitaker,
in this quote attributed to him by The Daily
and perhaps not representative of his entire
position, has captured the voice of intellectuals
who have resigned from the world. This resig
nation, cloaked in the kindliness of fatherhood,
is the actuality of impotence which results from
the well-reasoned attempts to ignore the con
tradictions which make the utterance and ac
ceptance of the statement possible. That voice
speaks to all of us, father and child, learned
and learner.
To examine this remark is a helpful way of
beginning to understand the sad sight of "both
ered and troubled" administrators, whose "un
easiness grew with every day that passed," try
ing to frame a University statement on drug
abuse (about three years after abuse first
began) because of "the incident at Stony
Brook." It may even help us see why adminis
trators and students alike began acting like
alarmed mother hens when an attempt at
greater equity in the draft policy interrupted
their secure little lives. It may allow us to see
why, despite all of the skills and powers of
prediction which we seek to develop here at
Stanford, we are passive, reactive agents, ap
parently incapable of initiating events in the
world. By drawing out the implications of the
Dean's timely advice, we can start to under
stand how it is we contribute to the creation
and maintenance of the conditions which make
this advice necessary.
WHAT indeed can a "normal course"
be? If it is the "only rational thing
to do in this kind of world," are we
not being asked to live normally in an abnormal
world? Isn't the proffered advice suggesting
that we act rationally in an irrational world?
Or at least, "in this kind of world," a world that
is not as we would have it? To paraphrase, we
are supposed to go ahead with business as

usual, though the world's business is most un
usual. Or in the words of the pragmatic realist
(circa 1968): "Of course this is an imperfect
world. But that is no excuse to abandon rea
son."
On the face of it, this admonition makes good
sense and is logically consistent. However, this
warning (and the above quote) are exam
ples of functional rationalization, i.e., they
have no substance. They serve to partially ac
count for the world and to enable the believer
to continue his existence. The rationality of the
statement serves the speaker. Substantively
speaking, the fact of the imperfect world and
its relationship to the use of reason, and the
combination of these two upon the speaker, is
ignored. Functional rationalization allows for
the necessary perpetuation of "this kind of
world," though, it is thought, that is what we
seek to change. Now why is this so?
To begin with, once the contradictions be
tween normal and abnormal are buried in our
minds, the critical imagination of the mind is
lost to the world. When the life of the college
dean and the graduating senior presumes its
own rationality, the life of the Selective Service
and the non-academic world of presumed irra
tionality is obviated. With this act the promise
of tension, the force of dialectics is lost to illu
sory personal resolution or mindless polariza
tion.
This is more than the bifurcation of thought
from action. It is to think and to reason from
the I-me (rational) frame of reference only
after the world, the irrational have been dis
missed a priori. To presume one's world abnor
mal and at the same time to declare the ration
ality of one's existence is to perform the mental
act that effectively removes one from any place
in that world. But more important is the fact
that such a stance causes one to forfeit the vis
ion necessary to act on such differences that
exist in the world. To close off our lives allows
for private sanity, perhaps, but little else.
(Here, a new question arises. Should the result
of closing off one's life really be described as
"sanity"?)

strued as a critique of reason or objec
tivity. What I have tried to describe is
