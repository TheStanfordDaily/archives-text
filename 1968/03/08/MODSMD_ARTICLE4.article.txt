1 During the course of these hearings the Dean of
Students was asked why he didn't take this case to
the civil courts. His reply was to the effect that he
hoped that this community could solve its own prob
lems. The implication that an academic community
should he able to resolve its difficulties more intelli
gently or more reasonably than a civil court was lost
when, in fact, the Dean's entire case was based on
legalisms and all moral considerations were ignored.
He has said to me in relation to this whole problem
that one is more likely to gain a conviction under the
University Policy on Demonstrations than the Funda
mental Standard because the former allows less possi
bility for moral suasion.
The point to be observed here is that this sort of
administrative concern explains why it takes the ad
ministration two years to realize that there is a judicial
crisis on the campus and then when that recognition
is made to respond with the now too familiar call for
the observance of law and order.
