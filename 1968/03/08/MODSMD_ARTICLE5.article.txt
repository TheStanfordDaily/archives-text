# Have no fear
## 
### 
I fear growing old
within
a heart and soul
that cannot laugh
at grey hair.
I fear that my
thirst will tire
before the keg
is dry
that loins will tire
before desire wants
rest.
I fear that if I
die young
I will think all
gods unkind.

the faltering gallop of sunrise stunning g<
heralds the beginning bombast of anothe
Great War.
the legions, so strong,
the faceless machine-joint firing pin pha
of tree-trunk bone, mountain power—
and a little flesh—
depart
amidst star-spangled angel choir tears ai
Beauty.
the nation sings and lifts together
knowing in the factory flexing of its sin
throbs the life of the Principle
for the eternally thankful yet unborn—
those who will forever
speak in whispered and water-eved awe
at the Greatness of that time
when blood was red
and they stood and did
What Must Be Done.
and at the weary glory end
the tear-smile cheers
stride out
to greet the no-lunged
and sterile
Heroes.
