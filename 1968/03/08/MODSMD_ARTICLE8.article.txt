# The 						day the black cat jumped and the rubber plant bounced
## 
### 
Forced out into coldness were they, the cats,
Into wellness, I.
"Alley cats stay in the alley and out of my
way." (Ilse, my mother)
"You stay in the sun, in your black beret and
ungloved hands, my son."
"Here, Orpheus, come on" (were my words as the
outstretched fingers of the ungloved hands seized
the warm, dusty fur of the round fat cat.
Together we stood for a moment, the cat and I in
the sun, out of the way, until from above the plant
fell as if thrown.)
(A plant without leaves, without need, an un
wanted rubber plant that died that way from the
cold, from lack of the sun.)
At the moment of falling, at the moment it fell,
the alley cat, black from the sun, turned around
and looked up at me and jumped from my arms onto
the path to the street.
Hop-hop, its bowlegged feet went hop-hop.
A trail of blood was seen as I cried out,
"Look what you've done, my mother."
"Forgive me, my son."
A rush of merthiolate flowed into the wound
and onto the skin that surrounded the wound
in the flesh of my outstretched fingers and
ungloved hands.
