## Observations on the Middle Ages 
### 
Observation I:
Can we know
What the peasants were thinking,
Or is It
Beyond our comprehension?
The answer hinges
On the unreferenced It in the sentence, but
Our Sentence is better served
If we dont become preoccupid with
it.
Observation II:
Medieval intellectuals
Were
Living a lie, but
Lying is commonplace
In the middle ages,
Even though we dont live
During this period.

Observation III:
Everything was formalized and had
A strict code.
It was so unnatural.
Everything and
Nothing
Have not changed. It
Is still . / j
Unnatural. " fogel
