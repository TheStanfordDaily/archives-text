# U.S. Clamps Down On Credit, Britain Closes Banks In Crisis
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
frenzied European gold rush
touched off a series of rapid-fire
developments on both sides of
the Atlantic Thursday, including
a tighter clamp on U.S. credit
and the temporary closing of
the London gold market.
The financial crisis appeared
to be the worst since the stock
market crash of 1929.
An international meeting was
scheduled in Washington for
Saturday to review the gold
frenzy as the United States as
serted its determination to
maintain the price of gold at $35
an ounce and thus avoid deval
uation of the dollar.
To back up this commitment,
the Senate Thursday night com
pleted congressional action by
a 39-37 vote on a bill to remove
the 25 per cent gold backing for

paper money, thus freeing the
nation's entire gold stock—now
about $11.4 billion—to back the
dollar overseas.
The London gold market, fo
cal point of the gold buying
spree, was closed temporarily
at the suggestion of the United
States which said it had "be
come disorganized and didn't
permit business to be handled
in orderly fashion."
Queen Elizabeth also pro
claimed a special bank holiday
for Friday, and the London stock
market was closed.
A spokesman for the New
York Stock Exchange said he
assumed it would be open Fri
day but "We will take a new
look at the situation early."
The tighter clamp on credit
stemmed from action by the
Federal Reserve Board raising

the discount rate from 4.5 per
cent to 5 per cent effective on
Friday.
This will be the highest rate
in almost 40 years — in the
months immediately preceding
the 1929 stock market crash.
The board said its action is
designed to strengthen the dol
lar internationally and curb in
flation at home. Its action was
unanimous.
In reasserting its determina
tion to hold the price of gold at
$35 an ounce, the United States
described closing of the London
market as temporary. But
there was no immediate esti
mate how long this meant.
A statement reaffirming the
U.S. position was issued shortly
after 8:30 p.m. EST by Secre
tary of the Treasury Henry H.
Fowler and chairman William
McChesney Martin Jr., of the
Federal Reserve Board.
They said the central bank
governors of the London Gold
Pool nations had been invited to
a meeting Saturday on "coordi
nated measures to ensure order
ly conditions in the exchange
markets and to support the
present pattern of exchange
rates based on the fixed price of
$35 per ounce of gold."
Nations to be represented are
the United Kingdom, Belgium,
Italy, Germany, Switzerland,
the Netherlands, and the United
States.
Among them, they supply the
gold sold through the London
market with the United States
picking up the lion's share—s9
per cent.

In Ottawa the Bank of Can
ada Thursday night announced
an Increase in its discount rate
to 7% per cent from 7 per cent,
effective Friday.
British banks will only supply
domestic customers with normal
cash requirements in sterling.
According to AP business ana
lyst John Canniff, a vast and
perhaps unbridgable credibility

gap now separates the United
States and its avowed policies on
gold and the dollar from a large
and disbelieving audience, es
pecially in Europe.
It Is this disbelief about Amer
ican intentions and, secondly,
over whether the United States
can accomplish what it intends
to do, that has spurred the rush
for gold.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The
frenzied European gold rush
touched off a series of rapid-fire
developments on both sides of
the Atlantic Thursday, including
a tighter clamp on U.S. credit
and the temporary closing of
the London gold market.
The financial crisis appeared
to be the worst since the stock
market crash of 1929.
An international meeting was
scheduled in Washington for
Saturday to review the gold
frenzy as the United States as
serted its determination to
maintain the price of gold at $35
an ounce and thus avoid deval
uation of the dollar.
To back up this commitment,
the Senate Thursday night com
pleted congressional action by
a 39-37 vote on a bill to remove
the 25 per cent gold backing for

paper money, thus freeing the
nation's entire gold stock—now
about $11.4 billion—to back the
dollar overseas.
The London gold market, fo
cal point of the gold buying
spree, was closed temporarily
at the suggestion of the United
States which said it had "be
come disorganized and didn't
permit business to be handled
in orderly fashion."
Queen Elizabeth also pro
claimed a special bank holiday
for Friday, and the London stock
market was closed.
A spokesman for the New
York Stock Exchange said he
assumed it would be open Fri
day but "We will take a new
look at the situation early."
The tighter clamp on credit
stemmed from action by the
Federal Reserve Board raising

the discount rate from 4.5 per
cent to 5 per cent effective on
Friday.
This will be the highest rate
in almost 40 years — in the
months immediately preceding
the 1929 stock market crash.
The board said its action is
designed to strengthen the dol
lar internationally and curb in
flation at home. Its action was
unanimous.
In reasserting its determina
tion to hold the price of gold at
$35 an ounce, the United States
described closing of the London
market as temporary. But
there was no immediate esti
mate how long this meant.
A statement reaffirming the
U.S. position was issued shortly
after 8:30 p.m. EST by Secre
tary of the Treasury Henry H.
Fowler and chairman William
McChesney Martin Jr., of the
Federal Reserve Board.
They said the central bank
governors of the London Gold
Pool nations had been invited to
