The residence committee

of its work. In a position paper
last month, the committee ad

topic committee of all — Prof.
Hi im A. Clebsch's Committee
oil Admissions and Einancial
d. 1'his group of two students,
ve (acuity and three staff has
ui/j-ded for ten months with

the "hornet's nest" of admis
sions, as Clebsch calls it.
The admissions committee dis
covered long ago that its work
overlaps into many other edu
cational issues. Already the com
mittee has criticized general stu
dies course requirements because
they "deter many likely persons
from applying to Stanford." The
high ratio of men to women has
also been atacked as an "admin
istrative convenience" which
"discriminates against women"
in admissions.
Early next month the Cleb
sch committee will issue a
long-awaited report on minor
ity group students at Stanford.
In a widely distributed draft
of the report, written by As
sociate Provost Robert Rosen
zvveig and Counseling Direc
tor John Black, Stanford's
past record in educating black
students is called "dreadful."
Preferential admissions treat'
ment, increased financial aid
and tutoring are recommended
for minority groups.
The committee is somewhat
farther from agreement on the
crucial issue of general admis
sions criteria to select one stu
dent out of the five who apply
for every opening in the fresh
man class.
Some committee members are
strongly critical of the "personal
factors" now used by the admis
sions office in evaluating appli
cants. Preferential admissions
for alumni children, athletes and
faculty - staff children are like
ly to receive blunt criticism.
Clebsch himself Ls identified
with a 1967 resolution by the hu
manities and science faculty
calling for greater diversity and
creativity in the student body.
But a survey by committee mem
ber Prof. J. Merrill Carlsmith
indicates the students whom fac
ulty members name as the "best"
also are rated highly by Stan
ford's present admissions cri

teria. Clebsch admits these re
sults have "undercut" his initial
views, but he says further stu
dies are necessary.
Another topic committee well
advanced in its work is the Ad
vising and Counseling study
group under Religion Prof. Ed
win M. Good. A draft of its re
port, titled "Advising: The Hu
manity of the University," was
criticized as too tepid and is
now being revised by the com
mittee.
The SES Government of the
University committee, chaired
by Law Prof. Herbert Packer,
is concentrating on "the ap
propriate administrative struc
ture for undergraduate educa
tion." It is expected to deal
with Stanford's lack of a dean
of undergraduate education
and the overlapping responsi
bilities of several key faculty
committees.
Exhaustive surveys are now
being tabulated by the Interna
tional Education committee,
which will evaluate Stanford's
overseas campuses. All faculty
members who have taught over
seas have been surveyed, and
students returning from over
seas campuses have been ques
tioned and tested.
Committee chairman Prof.
Thomas Ehrlich will say only
that "Some of the opinions are
favorable, some are very criti
cal" of the overseas program.
All the topic committees will
submit final reports to the SES
steering committee. After revi
sion, these reports will be in
corporated into the final SES
report. A first draft of this re
port will be released in October.
