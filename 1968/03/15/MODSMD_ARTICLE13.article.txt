tria contingents leaving for Eu
rope are three undergraduate
women who have attended over
seas campuses previously.
Applications for women were
opened JVlarch 6 for the Italy
XVI and Austria V groups when
a lower than usual application
rate left small alternate lists
exhausted.

tions were turned in for the nine
placos. All were accepted.
Of the six openings filled for
the Italy group, three have al
