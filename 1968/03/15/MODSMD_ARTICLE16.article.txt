## Stanford Slow In Black Help 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Associate Provost Rosenzweig
did indeed have many interest
ing things to say to tnose of us
attending the Undergraduate
Seminar No. 133 last week. How
ever, he did not say what was at
tributed to him in the Mar. 8
issue of The Daily. He said "ad
mission of Negroes to Stanford
is (less) selective than for
whites."
Further, he did not say that
the records of rejected Negro
applicants were as good or bet
ter than of those accepted. He
did say that some of the Negroes
rejected would have been aca
demic successes had they been
admitted, and that the reason
for their rejection was, in part,
lack of sufficient scholarship
funds.
It was in this context that
Rosenzweig advocated a reallo
cation of scholarships so that
no Negro applicant who had a
good chance at academic success
need be rejected. . . .
Lack of Effort
It is clear that Stanford's rec
ord on justice for the black com
munity is a dismal one. It is
evident that efforts are being

made to alter this. Many of us
at the seminar, however, felt
Stanford's pace is still more de
liberate than rapid.
For example, although a non
discriminatory employer, Stan
ford has ignored the possibility
of using the vast construction
works on campus as a means
of providing more jobs and bet
ter training for blacks. If the
contractor has signed an F.E.-
P.C. agreement, Stanford looks
no further.
May I suggest that Stanford
at least keep pace with the
Palo Alto City Council which
insists that contracts be let only
to firms which pursue an ag
gressive policy of minority hir
ing and training.
The examples could be mul
tiplied. Whether black admis
sions, black employment, black
scholarships, black staffing, or
relations with the black commu
nity, Stanford is as laggard as
the rest of white society — al
ways concerned, sometimes plan
ning, but never aroused.
This need not be the case. Con
sider what would happen if
word were suddenly to come
that Stanford had a good chance
to host the '72 Olympics. Talent

would be put to work, plans
made, resources channeled, mon
ies spent, and most important,
decisions made. It has happened
before that universities have
moved; it will happen again
when they think the cause merits
it. . . .
Priorities can be rearranged.
As a start, the university might
worry less about co-ed housing
and more about racial justice.
Immediate discussion and adop
tion of the Rosenzweig-Black pro
posals on black admissions
could change the racial composi
tion of next year's entering class.

Stanford's pace is still more de
liberate than rapid.
For example, although a non
discriminatory employer, Stan
ford has ignored the possibility
of using the vast construction
works on campus as a means
of providing more jobs and bet
ter training for blacks. If the
contractor has signed an F.E.-
P.C. agreement, Stanford looks
no further.
May I suggest that Stanford
at least keep pace with the
Palo Alto City Council which
insists that contracts be let only
to firms which pursue an ag
gressive policy of minority hir
ing and training.
The examples could be mul
tiplied. Whether black admis
sions, black employment, black
scholarships, black staffing, or
relations with the black commu
nity, Stanford is as laggard as
the rest of white society — al
ways concerned, sometimes plan
ning, but never aroused.
This need not be the case. Con
sider what would happen if
word were suddenly to come
that Stanford had a good chance
to host the '72 Olympics. Talent

would be put to work, plans
made, resources channeled, mon
ies spent, and most important,
decisions made. It has happened
before that universities have
moved; it will happen again
when they think the cause merits
it. . . .
Priorities can be rearranged.
As a start, the university might
worry less about co-ed housing
and more about racial justice.
Immediate discussion and adop
tion of the Rosenzweig-Black pro
posals on black admissions
could change the racial composi
tion of next year's entering class.

Editor, The Daily:
Associate Provost Rosenzweig
did indeed have many interest
ing things to say to tnose of us
attending the Undergraduate
Seminar No. 133 last week. How
ever, he did not say what was at
tributed to him in the Mar. 8
issue of The Daily. He said "ad
mission of Negroes to Stanford
is (less) selective than for
whites."
Further, he did not say that
the records of rejected Negro
applicants were as good or bet
ter than of those accepted. He
did say that some of the Negroes
rejected would have been aca
demic successes had they been
admitted, and that the reason
for their rejection was, in part,
lack of sufficient scholarship
funds.
It was in this context that
Rosenzweig advocated a reallo
cation of scholarships so that
no Negro applicant who had a
good chance at academic success
need be rejected. . . .
Lack of Effort
It is clear that Stanford's rec
ord on justice for the black com
munity is a dismal one. It is
evident that efforts are being

made to alter this. Many of us
at the seminar, however, felt
Stanford's pace is still more de
liberate than rapid.

discriminatory employer, Stan
ford has ignored the possibility
of using the vast construction
