# Viet War Makes Job Hunting More Difficult For '68 Grads
## 
### 
In spite of the Vietnam war
and the gold drain, the prospects
for job hunting Stanford gradu
ates in June "will be good but
quite selective," Dr. Ralph Kell
er, Stanford's director of place
ment, predicts.
Though Stanford graduates
are always in demand, those who
are selected by business, indus
try, and government this year
"will be the cream of the crop,"
he said.

Their salaries will he a few
percentage points higher than
the national average, as al
ways, he said.
The draft is affecting industry
as well as student planning. An
other influence is the dollar im
balance, which is restricting the
larger firms with extensive over
seas operations.
"This and the war's uncer
tainties are making business and
industry adopt a 'wait-and-see'
attitude," Dr. Keller said in a
campus interview.
He said that this year, 752
organizations will send person
nel representatives to the cam
pus to conduct interviews. "They
are all very impressed with the
quality of Stanford graduates,"
he said, "and many have told
me 'we'll take all the Stanford
grads we can get.' "
The tight money situation has
affected this year's prospects,
Dr. Keller explained. "With high
er money costs, a good many

firms are very cautious about
expansion and have curtailed
borrowing. This means fewer
jobs," he said.
Willium L. Whitsett, director
of engineering; and science
placement, echoes Dr. Keller's
opinions. "Firms are being
more selective this year," he
said. Engineering graduates
should not have difficulty find
ing jobs, but the number of
offers will probably be less.
"But to students worried about
the draft, we advise them to keep
going, and not to lose sight of
their objectives. If that includes
graduate study, continue with
those plans. You can't outguess
your draft board."
It will be tougher for foreign
students to get jobs, Whitsett
predicted, because there will be
fewer jobs for non-citizens and
none for them in government
work, direct or indirect, until thr>
international situation steadies
up a bit.
Average salary figures for the
June graduates, according to a
national survey by the College
Placement Council, will show
mixed gains over last year.
"The average offer to a bach
elor's candidate with a techni
cal major," the CPC says, "has
gone up 5.4 per cent since last
year to $759. In the non-technical
area, the average offer for stu
dents majoring in humanities
or social sciences is $614, a gain
of 4.2 per cent."
At the advanced degree
level, according to the CPC,
"the MBA with a technical
background has an average of
$900, up 3.6 per cent since last
June, while the M.S. in chem
ical engineering has moved to
the top with an average of
$906, up 5.6 per cent."
The MBA with a non-technical
background continues to receive
the most offers but the average
is down 35 per cent this year.


FIRST LONG-DISTANCE HOLOGRAM made by laser light on a dark night showing silhouette of a
man and his pipe eight miles away was made by Stanford engineers recently. One of the two identi
cal images in the hologram has been outlined, while the other — unretouched — can be seen upside
down at upper left. The man stood against a light-reflecting surface on which was mounted a glass
"corner reflector," which produces the ultra-bright center spot. The hologram records (he inter
ference pattern of reflected laser light, rather than a photographic image. The image is then "re
constructed" by shining laser light through the hologram. The Stanford group hopes to develop the
technique for viewing satellites 100 miles or more above the earth.

he said, "and many have told
me 'we'll take all the Stanford
grads we can get.' "
The tight money situation has
affected this year's prospects,
Dr. Keller explained. "With high
er money costs, a good many

firms are very cautious about
expansion and have curtailed
borrowing. This means fewer
jobs," he said.
Willium L. Whitsett, director
of engineering; and science
placement, echoes Dr. Keller's
opinions. "Firms are being
more selective this year," he
said. Engineering graduates
should not have difficulty find
ing jobs, but the number of
offers will probably be less.
"But to students worried about
the draft, we advise them to keep
going, and not to lose sight of
their objectives. If that includes
graduate study, continue with
those plans. You can't outguess
your draft board."
It will be tougher for foreign
students to get jobs, Whitsett
predicted, because there will be
fewer jobs for non-citizens and
none for them in government
work, direct or indirect, until thr>
international situation steadies
up a bit.
Average salary figures for the
June graduates, according to a
national survey by the College
Placement Council, will show
mixed gains over last year.
"The average offer to a bach
elor's candidate with a techni
cal major," the CPC says, "has
gone up 5.4 per cent since last
year to $759. In the non-technical
area, the average offer for stu
dents majoring in humanities
or social sciences is $614, a gain
of 4.2 per cent."
At the advanced degree
level, according to the CPC,
"the MBA with a technical
background has an average of
$900, up 3.6 per cent since last
June, while the M.S. in chem
ical engineering has moved to
the top with an average of
$906, up 5.6 per cent."
The MBA with a non-technical
background continues to receive
the most offers but the average
is down 35 per cent this year.


FIRST LONG-DISTANCE HOLOGRAM made by laser light on a dark night showing silhouette of a
man and his pipe eight miles away was made by Stanford engineers recently. One of the two identi
cal images in the hologram has been outlined, while the other — unretouched — can be seen upside
down at upper left. The man stood against a light-reflecting surface on which was mounted a glass
"corner reflector," which produces the ultra-bright center spot. The hologram records (he inter
ference pattern of reflected laser light, rather than a photographic image. The image is then "re
constructed" by shining laser light through the hologram. The Stanford group hopes to develop the
technique for viewing satellites 100 miles or more above the earth.
In spite of the Vietnam war
and the gold drain, the prospects
for job hunting Stanford gradu
ates in June "will be good but
quite selective," Dr. Ralph Kell
er, Stanford's director of place
ment, predicts.
Though Stanford graduates
are always in demand, those who
are selected by business, indus
try, and government this year
"will be the cream of the crop,"
he said.

Their salaries will he a few
percentage points higher than
the national average, as al
ways, he said.
The draft is affecting industry
as well as student planning. An
other influence is the dollar im
balance, which is restricting the
larger firms with extensive over
seas operations.
"This and the war's uncer
tainties are making business and
industry adopt a 'wait-and-see'
attitude," Dr. Keller said in a
