# Profs Receive Charter
## Faculty To Vote On Senate 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Stanford's 940 professors will
troop to ballot boxes in May to
elect a powerful new faculty
legislature, if a proposed charter
for an Academic Senate gains
ratification.
The charter's authors say the
representative Senate would al
low the faculty to make its de
cisions more efficiently. They
also expect this streamlined
government to assume powers
the faculty has been unable to
exercise in the past.
Faculty members received
the 15-page charter in the
mail Wednesday. It is. the
product of more than a year's
work by the Academic Coun
cil's Executive Committee,
chaired by Economics Prof.
Kenneth J. Arrow. The Coun
cil will vote on the charter
April 5.
Almost half of the Senate's 53
seats would be held by the
school of humanities and scien
ces. Nine will go to engineering,
eight to medicine, two each to
the schools of law, business, edu
cation, and earth sciences, and
one each to the food research
institute, linear accelerator cen
ter, and a special group of Uni
versity administrators.
Each school would decide for
itself how to apportion its seats
among various departments.
The humanities and sciences
council, an unofficial faculty
group, will meet Monday at 4:15
in the physics lecture hall to de

bate the charter and a plan to
apportion the school's 25 seats.
Humanities and sciences Dean
Robert Sears will suggest divid
ing the school into seven or
eight "logical blocks of depart
ments," with each block elect
ing several representatives.
The Senate would replace both
the Council and the Council's
Executive Committee, although
the Council would continue to
meet three times a year and
could override Senate decisions.
This means the 53 Senate
members meeting monthly,
would exercise all the faculty
power, which theoretically ex
tends to every aspect of Uni
versity policy, subject to ulti
mate approval of the Board of
Trustees. Admissions policy,
overseas campuses, and cur
riculum requirements could
be greatly affected.
The charter would change the
membership and role of the nine
Academic Council committees,
which now have considerable au
thority over areas ranging from
general studies to research pol
icy.
A "Committee on Committees"
would recommend to the Senate
the creation of certain standing
and ad-hoc committees, and ap
point their members. Although
the chairman of any Senate com
mittee would have to belong to
the Academic Council, students
and staff would be eligible as
members. Moreover, any com
mittee would be able to increase

its size by as much as one-third
by selecting new student, facul
ty or staff members.
Dean Sears believes the char
ter would mean "less autonomy
for individual committees" be
cause the Senate would meet
frequently. Law Prof. Herbert
Packer, an early proponent of
the Senate idea, expects a
"greater degree of accountabili
ty" for committees.
"Reports brought to the Sen
ate would receive far more di
rect attention than the Council
gives," Sears says. "We'll get a
lot more faculty vigor into con
sideration of proposals."
Complaints have been raised
in the past that administrators

have too much power because
the faculty Is poorly orga
nized. In a 1967 memorandum
describing the Senate propo
sal, Arrow predicted "the fac
ulty will assume a larger role,
both of an initiating and a
mediating nature, in the af
fairs of the University."
Packer thinks administrators
will be able to "communicate
much better with faculty."

ate would receive far more di
rect attention than the Council
gives," Sears says. "We'll get a
lot more faculty vigor into con
sideration of proposals."
Complaints have been raised
in the past that administrators

have too much power because
the faculty Is poorly orga
nized. In a 1967 memorandum
describing the Senate propo

both of an initiating and a
mediating nature, in the af

Stanford's 940 professors will
troop to ballot boxes in May to
elect a powerful new faculty
legislature, if a proposed charter
for an Academic Senate gains
ratification.
The charter's authors say the
representative Senate would al
low the faculty to make its de
cisions more efficiently. They
also expect this streamlined
government to assume powers
the faculty has been unable to
exercise in the past.
Faculty members received
the 15-page charter in the
mail Wednesday. It is. the
product of more than a year's
work by the Academic Coun
cil's Executive Committee,
chaired by Economics Prof.
Kenneth J. Arrow. The Coun
cil will vote on the charter
April 5.
Almost half of the Senate's 53
seats would be held by the
school of humanities and scien
ces. Nine will go to engineering,
eight to medicine, two each to
the schools of law, business, edu
cation, and earth sciences, and
one each to the food research
institute, linear accelerator cen
ter, and a special group of Uni
versity administrators.
Each school would decide for
itself how to apportion its seats
among various departments.
The humanities and sciences
council, an unofficial faculty
group, will meet Monday at 4:15
in the physics lecture hall to de

bate the charter and a plan to
apportion the school's 25 seats.
Humanities and sciences Dean
Robert Sears will suggest divid
ing the school into seven or
eight "logical blocks of depart
ments," with each block elect
ing several representatives.
The Senate would replace both
the Council and the Council's
Executive Committee, although
the Council would continue to
meet three times a year and
could override Senate decisions.
This means the 53 Senate
members meeting monthly,
would exercise all the faculty
power, which theoretically ex
tends to every aspect of Uni
versity policy, subject to ulti
mate approval of the Board of
Trustees. Admissions policy,
overseas campuses, and cur
riculum requirements could
be greatly affected.
The charter would change the
membership and role of the nine
Academic Council committees,
which now have considerable au
thority over areas ranging from
general studies to research pol
icy.
A "Committee on Committees"
would recommend to the Senate
the creation of certain standing
and ad-hoc committees, and ap
point their members. Although
the chairman of any Senate com
mittee would have to belong to
the Academic Council, students
and staff would be eligible as
members. Moreover, any com
mittee would be able to increase

its size by as much as one-third
by selecting new student, facul
ty or staff members.
Dean Sears believes the char
ter would mean "less autonomy
for individual committees" be
cause the Senate would meet
frequently. Law Prof. Herbert
Packer, an early proponent of
the Senate idea, expects a
"greater degree of accountabili
ty" for committees.
"Reports brought to the Sen
ate would receive far more di
rect attention than the Council
gives," Sears says. "We'll get a
lot more faculty vigor into con
sideration of proposals."
