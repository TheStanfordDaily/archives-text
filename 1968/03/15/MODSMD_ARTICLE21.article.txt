# Board To Meet Next Week On Housing Plans, Budget
## 
### 
Stanford's 23-member Board
of Trustees will meet Thursday
to act on next year's $47 million
operating budget and consider a
proposal to reorganize campus
housing.
The Board will also hear a
report from its presidential selec
tion committee, which has been
unable to find a successor to
President Wallace Sterling de
spite a year's search. Sterling
plans to retire as president and
become University chancellor be
fore next September.
After committee meetings,
the entire board will meet at
2 p.m. in Bowman alumni
house on campus.
Provost Richard Lyman will
present the Board a detailed pro
posal to roughly triple the num
ber of coeducational housing
spaces on campus, with men add
ed to presently all-female Roble
and Lagunita halls. The mixing
of freshmen with upperclassmen
would be greatly increased by
the plan.
The housing proposals, pre

pared by the Dean of Students'
office, should also allow all
sophomore, junior and senior
women the option of living out
side University residences. Last
May the Board ended a 75-year
tradition by permitting up to
100 senior women to live off cam
pus.
Routine business for the
Board will include final action
on the University's operating
budget for the fiscal year begin
ning Sept. 1. At $46.6 million, it
is up $3.9 million from 1967-68.
Instruction, libraries and stu
dent services are covered by the
operating budget, but it excludes
large research contracts and the
$24 million federal subsidy for
the linear accelerator center.
Stanford's total yearly expen
ditures exceed $130 million.
The Board will also be told
of the proposed charter for a
Senate of the Academic Coun
cil, instituting a 53-member
legislature to carry out the
functions of the unwieldly,
940-member Council. The fac

ulty will vote on the charter
April 5. If approved, it will
go to the trustees at their
April meeting for final action.
Time is running out on the
Board if it hopes to satisfy
Sterling's request that his suc
cessor take office before Septem
ber. The Board's first choice —
John Gardner, Secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare
— turned down the job late last
year.
William Baxter, chairman of
the faculty committee working
with the trustees in the presi
dential search, has said he will
refuse to discuss any reports
or rumors concerning the next
president, to avoid interfering
with the committee's work.
Last week the San Francisco
Chronicle said U.S. Commission
er of Education Harold Howe
"has been prominently mention
ed as Sterling's most likely suc
cessor." A Chronicle reporter
said two sources "outside the
University" gave this informa
tion.
