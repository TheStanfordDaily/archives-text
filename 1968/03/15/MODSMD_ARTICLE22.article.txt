# Campus Speakers Business Booms

### GARVEN HUDGINS AP Education Writer 
WASHINGTON (AP)— In this
day of involved students and
campus activisim, the lecture
circuit is booming with speakers
on everything from psychedelics
to politics.
From Berkeley to Harvard,
from Wisconsin to UCLA, the
voice of the campus speaker is
heard and students and their
administrators are paying to
give him a platform — in some
cases $1,000 or more a speech.
Campus speechniaking drew
national attention recently
when former Harlem Rep.

Adam Clayton Powell ran up
a $500 tab at a Los Angeles
Motel during a trip to address
students at UCLA.
Powell was paid $1,250 from
student funds to speak at UCLA.
His controversial motel bill was
subjected to "negotiation" and,
a UCLA student representative
reported, scheduled for settle
ment half by the students who
invited him and half by people
who traveled with him.
The policy of inviting outside
speakers representing all shades
of opinion to address students
has raised alumni hackles in
many cases and prompted clos

ing questions about who pays.
The system employed at
UCLA is fairly representative.
Aaron Grunfeld, chairman of
the Associated Students Speak
ers Program, says student-in
vited speakers are paid from
student incidental fees and not
from university funds.
Like many student associa
tions, the one at UCLA prefers
to keep private the range of
honorariums paids to speakers.
"If fees were made public,"
Grunfeld said, "negotiations
with future speakers would
be the question of professional
resentment, for example, that
one speaker was paid more
than another."
Grunfeld says 35 to 40 speak
ers appear each year at UCLA.
Some speakers at Columbia Uni
versity's Morningside Heights
campus in New York are sup
ported through the sale of tick
ets. And on some occasions, the
university donates funds for cer
tain campus groups to invite
speakers who are specialists in
their fields.
At the University of Califor
nit's politically sophisticated Ber
keley campus, speakers are spon
sored by the Associated Stu
dents, University of California,
which draws on a fund made up

of student dues, by the chan
cellor's office or by different de
partments of the university.
Official policy at Columbia
typifies the approach of univer
sity administrators to the ques
tion of outside speakers: "Every
recognized student organization
may invite outside speakers of
its own choosing at any time to
advocate any idea or to discuss
any subject."
