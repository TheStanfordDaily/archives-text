Stanford Police Chief Gordon
Davis said yesterday that the
Stanford police are special dep
uties of the Santa Clara County
Sheriff, clarifying an article in
The Dally.
"We will continue as we al
ways have, taking care of mis
demeanors on campus," he said.
The deputy sheriff who will
patrol the campus four hours
a day will merely supplement the
Stanford force, according to
Davis.
University counsel Cassius
Kirk, of the Business Affairs
Office, said that the Stanford
police were sworn in by the
sheriff, but he said, "It is not
entirely clear what this swear
ing in does."
Kirk said the campus police
are not legally peace officers,
and thus have "the same powers
of arrest as a private citizen."
