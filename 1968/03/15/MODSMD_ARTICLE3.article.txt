# Washington Work-Study Gets Support From 3 Departments
## 
### 
Three Stanford departments
have indicated that they will of
fer fifteen units of academic cre
dit for 30 students participating
as observers in Martin Luther
King's "Poor People's Mobili
zation," during Spring quarter.
Applications are due by 9 a.m.
Monday in Prof. Charles Drek
meier's office in the political sci
ence building. An interview sche
dule will be posted at the same
place on Tuesday morning.
The political science, anthro
pology, and communications
departments are considering a
five unit inter-departmental
seminar on research methods
and the study of Negro move
ments and race relations.
Prof. Paul Wallin of the socio
logy department yesterday indi
cated that it is "very likely"

that his department will decide
to offer credit for study of the
Spring Mobilization and its im
pact on Congress after their
meeting today.
The program will also prob
ably include two five unit di
rected reading courses of the stu
dent's choice. "This will involve
some observation and some writ
ing, which is a little different
from the usual directed reading
class," Wallin said.
Interested students should sub
mit a 200 word essay in their
application stating why they
think the program would be of
educational value to them. In
cluded in their application should
be the student's address, sex,
age, year, major, and possible
preferences of work.
On Thursday from 8 p.m. to

12 midnight, two professors, two
members of the Black Student
Union — which is co-sponsoring
the program — and two other
students will conduct 10 minute
interviews.
Junior Mike Bruwer, one of
the students who proposed the
study program ,said that the
group will probably fly stand
by to Washington about a
week before the April 22
march is scheduled to begin.
Prior to that time, they will
have intensive seminar work
at Stanford in the study of
field techniques and social sci
ence methodology.
Martin Luther King has call
ed for the mobilization of the
nation's poor in Washington
during the last weeks of April
and well into the summer to
"demand decent jobs and in
come." King hopes that the gath
ering "will build powerful non
violent demonstrations on the
Issues of jobs, income, welfare,
health, housing, education, and
human rights."
Stoney Cook, nationwide cam
pus representative for King's
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, indicated to stu
dents during a campus visit
this week that King welcomes
students from universities who
have serious research interests
in the movement.
Berkeley, Antioch, Michigan,
and Michigan State have also
planned study programs in
Washington. Berkeley has writ
ten to all California congressmen
requesting whatever assistance
they may be able to give.
Included in costs to the stu
dents, in addition to transporta
tion, will be approximately $125
for living expenses at the tent
colony where the marchers will
be staying.
