# In Summer Festival
## Shankar, Khan To Perform 
### 
Eight uf India's most accom
plished musicians, led by master
sitarist Ravi Shankar and saro
dist Ali Akhar Khan, will bring
two different concerts of their
"Festival from India" program
to the 19G8 Stanford Summer
Festival. The two distinct con
certs will be presented on the
evenings of Friday and Satur
day, July 5 and 6, starting at 8
p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
Shankar has been the princi

pal force in the introduction of
Indian music to the Western
world. In the last two years he
has risen swiftly to the status
of world-acclaimed concert art
ist.
"In our early planning; we
w ere excited by the thought of
presenting si non-Western mus
ical attraction," said Festival
producer Stephen BafTrey.
"Our thoughts naturally turn
ed immediately to Mr. Shankar

and to the excitement of pr<v
senting a complete picture of
Indian music with Mr. Shankar
as host and performer."
Baffrey contacted Shankar's
American manager, impressario
Jay K. Hoffman in New York,
and the two worked out the idea
to ask Mr. Shankar to return
to India to gather seven other
of his country's finest musi
cians for the Stanford engage
ment.
"Festival from India" will in
clude Shankar, Khan, and other
yet unnamed musicians and vo
calists in a program which will
demonstrate sitar, sarod, table,
tamboura, sarangi, veena and
flute.
Although designed for the
Stanford Summer Festival, the
Shankar program has since been
booked for an extensive sum
mer tour which includes Los
Angeles, Ravinia, Tanglewood
and the Lincoln Center.

Shankar, a disciplined virtuoso
who plays only classical music,
became an idol of teen agers in
19fi5 when George Harrison of
the Beatles studied under him
briefly and the Beatles released
a series of records reflecting the
unique sitar sound. Other rock'n
roll groups followed with what
is described as "raga rock."
Indian music has also opened
new worlds of rhythm in jazz.
The sitar is a long, thick
necked 19-string Instrument
Six strings are played to create
melody and rhythm. They
overlay 13 strands which pick
up the vibrations of the play
ing strings. The sounds range
from crystalline sharpness to |
weird whining to almost im
perceptible softness.
The sitar was designed to play
classical ragas â€” improvisations
on emotional themes to produce
a mystic experience.
