# Hershey Says No To Deferral Plan
## 
### 
Selective Service System Di
rector Gen. Lewis E. Hershey
has crushed hopes that students
who are able to register in grad
uate school in September will be
deferred until the end of the
school year.
Representatives of several
higher education organizations
met with Hershey in Washington
Monday to discuss the question,
but were unable to obtain a con
cession from the director.
Hershey did say that a stu
dent otherwise eligible to be
drafted would be allowed to
finish the quarter or semester
for which he was enrolled.
He stated that he would be
"exceeding his powers" if ho al

lowed deferments for a full
year. Hershey also said such ac
tion would be "countermanding
the directive of Congress."
This almost completely elimi
nates the possibility of full-year
deferments for present seniors
and first-year graduate students
who plan to attend graduate
school next year, according to
Virgil Whitaker, dean of the
graduate division.
Whitaker also reports that
Sen. Richard Russell, chairman
of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, and Rep. L. Mendel
Rivers, his counterpart in the
House, have rebuffed requests to
hold hearings '.n rnoHifixations
of the draft law.
