# Cost Of Remodeling Dorms For Coed Housing: $25,000
## 
### 
Remodeling campus housing
as proposed by the Dean of Stu
dents would cost less than $25,-
000, according to estimates by
the University housing office.
Eleven houses, including
Roble, Toyon and units in Stern,
Wilbur and Lagunita halls,
would be converted for occu
pancy by the opposite sex. Al
most one thousand men and 600
women would live in coeduca
tional residences, including about
half the freshman class.
Cost estimates were prepared
by Assistant Business Manager
Edward Scoles for the Board
of Trustees, which will consider
the housing proposals Thurs
day.
In spirited lobbying this
week, two residences persuad
ed the dean's office not to fill
their houses with freshmen
men next year. Burbank house
in Stem hall was listed as a
freshman house in a working
proposal distributed by Assis
tant Dean Sally Mahoney last
week
At a meeting of house pres
idents Tuesday, Miss Mahoney
announced that Burbank would
continue to house men from all
classes, and instead ATO fra
ternity's vacated house on May
field avenue and Lathrop wom
en's house would be used for
freshman men.
Vigorous opposition by the 32
Lathrop women convinced the
dean's office that the freshmen
should be housed elsewhere. The
final proposal is not completed,
but Miss Mahoney says no exist
ing house will be entirely con
verted to use by freshmen.
Grove house, the prototype
coeducational residence start
ed in January, 1967, will move
from Stern hall to Hurlburt
and Stillman houses on Las
uen street, the tree-lined
"Row" once dominated by fra
ternities and sororities.
Grove residents voted Wed
nesday to accept the dean's of
fer of the two Row houses.

Thirty-five women will live in
Stillman and 38 men in Hurl
burt, sharing dining and lounge
facilities. Women now living in
either Row house will have pri
ority in drawing into Grove.
These final arrangements
come after a month's work by
Miss Mahoney, Doug Davis and
Bill Leland of the dean's office.
Four meetings were held with
house presidents to discuss hous
ing arrangements and the draw
system.
If the trustees approve the
housing proposals, which In
clude a plan to make Lambda
Nu fraternity coeducational
with 20 women, the next step
will be creating an all-campus
draw for men and women.
Earlier discussions showed
sharp disagreement over the

priorities for men who want
to live in University housing.
With only 1,600 beds for men
in University-owned housing,
some men now living in dormi
tories will be excluded from
them next year since all 860
incoming freshman men are
guaranteed housing space. Fresh
men now living in Wilbur hall
argue they should not be squeez
ed out of campus housing be
cause upperclassmen are given
priority in a draw.
Another problem for the deans
next quarter will be deciding on
seminars and academic themes
for the various residences.
A Beta Chi proposal to go co
educational next fall was not
considered since it did not go
with the deans' view of the hous
ing package.

Nu fraternity coeducational
with 20 women, the next step
will be creating an all-campus
draw for men and women.
Earlier discussions showed
sharp disagreement over the

priorities for men who want
to live in University housing.
With only 1,600 beds for men
in University-owned housing,
some men now living in dormi
tories will be excluded from
them next year since all 860
incoming freshman men are
guaranteed housing space. Fresh
men now living in Wilbur hall
argue they should not be squeez
ed out of campus housing be
cause upperclassmen are given
priority in a draw.
Another problem for the deans
next quarter will be deciding on
seminars and academic themes
for the various residences.
A Beta Chi proposal to go co
educational next fall was not
considered since it did not go
with the deans' view of the hous
ing package.
Remodeling campus housing
as proposed by the Dean of Stu
dents would cost less than $25,-
000, according to estimates by
the University housing office.
Eleven houses, including
Roble, Toyon and units in Stern,
Wilbur and Lagunita halls,
would be converted for occu
pancy by the opposite sex. Al
most one thousand men and 600
women would live in coeduca
tional residences, including about
half the freshman class.
Cost estimates were prepared
by Assistant Business Manager
Edward Scoles for the Board
of Trustees, which will consider
the housing proposals Thurs
day.
In spirited lobbying this
week, two residences persuad
ed the dean's office not to fill
their houses with freshmen
men next year. Burbank house
in Stem hall was listed as a
freshman house in a working
proposal distributed by Assis
tant Dean Sally Mahoney last
week
At a meeting of house pres
idents Tuesday, Miss Mahoney
announced that Burbank would
continue to house men from all
classes, and instead ATO fra
ternity's vacated house on May
field avenue and Lathrop wom
en's house would be used for
freshman men.
Vigorous opposition by the 32
Lathrop women convinced the
dean's office that the freshmen
should be housed elsewhere. The
final proposal is not completed,
but Miss Mahoney says no exist
ing house will be entirely con
verted to use by freshmen.
Grove house, the prototype
coeducational residence start
ed in January, 1967, will move
from Stern hall to Hurlburt
and Stillman houses on Las
uen street, the tree-lined
"Row" once dominated by fra
ternities and sororities.
Grove residents voted Wed
nesday to accept the dean's of
fer of the two Row houses.

Thirty-five women will live in
Stillman and 38 men in Hurl
burt, sharing dining and lounge
facilities. Women now living in
either Row house will have pri
ority in drawing into Grove.
These final arrangements
come after a month's work by
Miss Mahoney, Doug Davis and
Bill Leland of the dean's office.
Four meetings were held with
house presidents to discuss hous
ing arrangements and the draw
system.
If the trustees approve the
housing proposals, which In
clude a plan to make Lambda
Nu fraternity coeducational
with 20 women, the next step
will be creating an all-campus
draw for men and women.
