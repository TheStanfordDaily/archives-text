# Six Going To Cuba Seized In Mexico
## 
### PENNY HILL 
Six young journalists and
graduate student researchers
from the Bay Area were kid
napped in Mexico City recently
and driven to the U.S. border.
The six left San Francisco
Wednesday, March 6, for Mexi
co, en route to Cuba for study,
research, and writing.
Among the six was an ex-
Stanford student, Stuart Mc-
Crae, 24, who is now an active
member of the Resistance and
co-editor of Resist, the Resist
ance magazine.
The other members of the
group included Barbara Cie
ciorka, 24, a San Francisco jour
nalist; Karen Wald, 24, also a
journalist from San Francisco;
Jack Bloom and Harold Jacobs,
both 26, graduate students at the
University of California at Ber
keley in sociology.

Both Bloom and Jacobs had
the endorsement of their ad
visers and departments to un
dertake the trip for research
purposes.
The other member was Con
nie Kurz, 24, a graduate stu
dent in history and economics
at San Jose State. She also had
formal endorsement for study in
Cuba from one of her advisers.
The six researchers applied
to the U.S. State Department for
validation of their travel in Cu
ba as journalists with accredited
newspapers and as students pre
paring masters theses and doc
toral dissertations. When they
left the United States, they were
still awaiting "long overdue"
responses, according to Jacobs.
"Since Mexico has diplomat
ic relations with Cuba," Miss
Wald said, "There is no reason
under Mexican law or custom
why people should not be free
to travel to Cuba."
At 6:00 Friday evening they
were checking in for the flight
to Havana. They were led out
of the building by men who said
they were immigration officials.
Expecting some sort of inter
rogation, they went with the
men, who led them to cars,
forced them into the automo
biles, three in each car, and
were driven away from the air
port. In each car there were
three guards, one of whom in
each car was visibly armed. An
other car with four guards ac
companied them.
For the next 20 hours the six
young people were in the cus
tody of the alleged immigration
officials, who refused to show
identification until the ride was
well underway.
"Normally the kidnapping of
U.S. citizens on foreign soil
would lead to immediate formal
protests," said Miss Wald. How
ever, they have heard nothing
from the State department and
are now in the process of con
sulting San Francisco and New
York law firms for legal advice.
