# Frosh Seminar Committee Cool To TA Cutback Query
## 
### CHRISTOPHER HARGROVE 
Inquiries into the cutback of
graduate students teaching
freshman seminars got a cool
reply this week from the Fac
ulty Committee on Freshman
Seminars.
The Stanford chapter of the
American Federation of Teach
ers (AFT) had written to com
mittee chairman Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch asking why the num
ber of graduate students teach
ing the seminars had been re
duced without the graduate stu
dents themselves being consult
ed.
Dornbusch Implied the rea
son for the cutback was simp
ly that the committee wanted
as many professors In the pro
gram as possible.
Dornbusch told The Daily yes

terday the intent of the three
year-old program has always
been to increase contact between
freshmen and professors, and
that the number of professors
taking part in the program "is
going to increase tremendously
this year."
The overall number of semi
nars, however, is going to be cut
back slightly next year, Dorn
busch said, because the gift of
funds to set up the program
paid only for the first three

years, and the University by it
self cannot afford to sponsor as
many seminars next year.
The AFT's letter also asked
why the deadline for submitting
proposals for next year's semi
nars was not publicly announc
ed, even to graduate students
now teaching in the program.
Dornbusch told The Daily his
committee had decided to rely
only on recommendations from
heads of departments in choos
ing teachers of next year's sem
inars.
In the past, he said, the
"level of qualification* has
been a problem," and the com
mittee felt going through de
partment heads would insure
the highest quality of teach
ers for freshman seminars.
Dornbusch added he saw no
great difference between the
quality of teaching by graduate
students and by professors in
general, but emphasized the pur
pose of the freshman seminar
program is to maximize contact
between freshmen and profes
sors.
The AFT labeled as "pater
nalism" the way the decision
was made to reduce the number
of graduate students teaching in
the program.
A spokesman said, "Our aim
is not to insulate further the
freshmen from the senior fac
ulty or to deny the vital and de
cisive role that professors should
play in the program.
"But we want to emphasize
that graduate students, with
their frequently unique skills
and backgrounds, can help diver
sify the program by offering
unusual but academically re
spectable seminars that profes
sors may be unwilling or unable
to teach."

paid only for the first three

years, and the University by it
self cannot afford to sponsor as
many seminars next year.
The AFT's letter also asked
why the deadline for submitting
proposals for next year's semi
nars was not publicly announc
ed, even to graduate students
now teaching in the program.
Dornbusch told The Daily his
committee had decided to rely
only on recommendations from
heads of departments in choos
ing teachers of next year's sem
inars.
In the past, he said, the
"level of qualification* has
been a problem," and the com
mittee felt going through de
partment heads would insure
the highest quality of teach
ers for freshman seminars.
Dornbusch added he saw no
great difference between the
quality of teaching by graduate
students and by professors in
general, but emphasized the pur
pose of the freshman seminar
program is to maximize contact
between freshmen and profes
sors.
The AFT labeled as "pater
nalism" the way the decision
was made to reduce the number
of graduate students teaching in
the program.
A spokesman said, "Our aim
is not to insulate further the
freshmen from the senior fac
ulty or to deny the vital and de
cisive role that professors should
play in the program.
"But we want to emphasize
that graduate students, with
their frequently unique skills
and backgrounds, can help diver
sify the program by offering
unusual but academically re
spectable seminars that profes
sors may be unwilling or unable
to teach."
Inquiries into the cutback of
graduate students teaching
freshman seminars got a cool
reply this week from the Fac
ulty Committee on Freshman
Seminars.
The Stanford chapter of the
American Federation of Teach
ers (AFT) had written to com
mittee chairman Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch asking why the num
ber of graduate students teach
ing the seminars had been re
duced without the graduate stu
dents themselves being consult
ed.
Dornbusch Implied the rea
son for the cutback was simp
ly that the committee wanted
as many professors In the pro
gram as possible.
Dornbusch told The Daily yes

terday the intent of the three
year-old program has always
been to increase contact between
freshmen and professors, and
that the number of professors
taking part in the program "is
going to increase tremendously
this year."
The overall number of semi
nars, however, is going to be cut
back slightly next year, Dorn
busch said, because the gift of
funds to set up the program
paid only for the first three

years, and the University by it
self cannot afford to sponsor as
many seminars next year.
