# Johnson Won't Run
## 
### 
(AP) — President Johnson
stunned the nation and the
world Sunday night by an
nouncing, "I shall not seek—and
will not accept the nomination
of my party for another term
as your President."
Johnson said he reached this
conclusion because "with Amer
ica's sons in the field far away,
with America's future under
challenge here at home, with
our hopes—and the world's
hopes—for peace in the balance
every day, I do not believe that
I should devote an hour of my
time to any personal partisan
causes or to any duties other
than the awesome duties of this
office."
This statement, and the warn
ing against division in the coun
try which preceded it, were not
in the President's prepared text
that was given out by the White
House in advance of his broad
cast. Officials had said, however,
that there would be some ad
dition to the prepared remarks.
His announcement came at
the end of a nationally broad
cast speech.
In the early part of the 40-
minute talk he disclosed that
he is halting nearly all air
and sea action against North
Vietnam in an effort to bring
peace talks.
Johnson called this cessation
of bombardments "the first step
to de-escalate the conflict."
Here are Johnson's historic
words:
"With our hopes and the
world's hopes for peace in the
world in the balance every day,

I do not believe that I should de
vote an hour or a day of my
time to any personal partisan
call or to any duties other than
the duties of this office, the
presidency of your country.
"Accordingly I shall not seek
and I will not accept the nomi
nation of my party for another
term as your president."
Johnson's new peace bid
was voiced before he added to
Ms distributed-in-advance text
a very emotional statement in
which he announced his bomb
shell decision aaginst seeking
reelection.
Throughout these passages,
Johnson lamented that "there is
division in the American house
now" which he argued imperils
the future of the land.
There were tears glistening in
Johnson's eyes as he made his
bombshell announcement.
He did it calmly, tapping his
desk occasionally in emphasis,
with the eyes of his family fixed
on him. Mrs. Johnson was there,
daughters Lynda and Luci, and
Luci's husband, Patrick Nugent.
Mrs. Johnson, in a bright red
sui f trimmed in blue, had a
slight smile on her face for the
finale and rushed over to throw
her arms about her husband
when the broadcast ended. Lyn
da, in navy blue, hurried up
with misty eyes and gave her
father a kiss on the cheek.
"What we won when all our
people united," Johnson as
serted, "must not now be lost
in suspicion, distrust and self
ishness among any of our
people.

The chief executive also voiced
a new appeal for early congres
sional passage of an income tax
increase.
He said that without higher
taxes or budget cuts, next
year's deficit would again be
around $20 billion.
"Yet Congress has not acted,"
he said. "And today we face the
sharpest threat in the postwar
era—a threat to the dollar's role
as the keystone of international
trade and finance."
He called for Congress to do
some sharp budget-cutting.
Johnson declared that "no
one can foretell the precise
terms of an eventual settle
ment" In Vietnam. But he
went on to reaffirm limited
objectives on the part of the
United States:
"Our objective in South Viet
nam has never been the annhili
ation of the enemy. It has been
to bring about a recognition in
Hanoi that its objective—taking
over the South by force—could
not be achieved ...
Johnson's unexpected an
nouncement—which Democratic
anti-war Democrats had pre
dicted more than a year ago
without any acceptance in party
circles—matched that of former
President Harry S. Truman.
Truman announced just before
the probing Wisconsin primary
of 1952 that he would not seek
the second elective term to
which both he and Johnson
were eligible.
Associated Press analyst Jack
Bell observed that the effect of
this on the future course of the
war in which more than 500,000

Americans now are engaged
could not be calculated immedi
ately.
His principal opponents, Ken
nedy and McCarthy, have made
opposition to the Johnson Asian
policies almost their sole cam
paign issue in primary elections.
McCarthy said Sunday, even
before the President bowed
out of the contest, that he ex
pects to be Nixon's opponent
in the November election. His
comment on Johnson's an
nouncement was that the
President's statement "changed
the entire political picture."
This understatement was sur
charged by McCarthy's young
advocates who ran whopping
through the halls of his head
quarters hotel in Milwaukee,
shouting "we're in! We're in!"
But it wasn't as simple as all
that. Kennedy meets McCarthy
head on in the May 7 primary in
Indiana. Gov. Roger D. Brani
gin had been scheduled as a
stand-in candidate for the Presi
dent. Whether or not his name
remains on the ballot, the con
test will be between Kennedy
and McCarthy in a state where
the voters are normally more
conservative than either candi
date.
The question of where Hum
phrey will come into the picture
remained clouded. He was sup
ported Johnson's Vietnam posi
tion valiantly. It is too late for
him to get on any primary bal
lot.
But whether delegations chos
en in state conventions which
seemed likely to support an ex

pected presidential bid for re
election now will turn to Hum
phrey remained obscure.
The vice president was put
In the position of an outsider,
who might make a run for it
at the Democratic convention
in Chicago in August
But his position was even
shakier than a Republican like
Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of
New York who might bid for the
GOP nomination without having
any basic support except his own
state delegation's designation as
a favorite son.
Humphrey has no favorite son
base in sight and could depend
only on his support of Johnson's
Vietnam policies to generate
support for him.
Kennedy, the reluctant gam
bler, seemed likely to benefit
most from Johnson's with
drawal.
Although the language in his
speech was clear, some ques
tions were raised about such
possibilities as a draft and John
son sought to lay these at rest
by telling newsmen later that
his decision to withdraw is
"completely irrevocable."
In an informal news confer
ence shortly before midnight,
Johnson said his health is "per
fect, never better" and that was
no factor in his decision.
He added he has no plans for
what he will be doing after next
January when his term ends.
Johnson said he received
many phone calls and some
messages from abroad after the
broadcast but declined to go
into their contents.


LYNDON B. JOHNSON: "I do not believe that I should devote an
hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan call. ..."
