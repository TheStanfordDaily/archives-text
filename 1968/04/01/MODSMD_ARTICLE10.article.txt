# The 						Washington Merry-Go-Round
## Nerve Gas Escapes In Utah 
### Drew Pearson 
WASHINGTON—The incident
of the 6,000 dead sheep in west
ern Utah has raised the ominous
possibility that people, too, may
be in danger from chemical and
germ warfare experiments.
This column has learned, for
example, that the veterinarians
who examined the dead sheep
have complained of strange
symptoms themselves. The Bas
que sheepherder who had been
tending the ill-fated flock also
suffered from nausea, head
aches, dizziness and diarrhea.
The sheep had been grazing
near the Army's Dugway Prov
ing Grounds, where the Army
has been testing nerve gas. The
suspicion is that the sheep got
a whiff of the deadly gas, which
somehow seeped out of the test
area.
This has caused an urgent re
appraisal of the safeguards at
other chemical and biological
warfare centers. For it is known
that the Army is experimenting
with paralyzing, odorless gases
and deadly mutant microbes in
more populated places than the
sagebrush country of western
Utah.
Widespread Research
Research in chemical or germ
warfare is going on at the
Rocky Mountain Arsenal near
Denver; Pine Bluff Arsenal, 40
miles from Little Rock, Ark.;
Fort Dietrich, outside Frederick,
Md., 40 miles from the nation's
capital; Edgewood Arsenal, Md.;
Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.; and
a civilian laboratory at Newport,
Ind. In addition, 50 research
contracts have been granted to
various universities.
There are no known antidotes
for some of the gases and germs
that have been developed. At
the Pine Bluff Laboratories, for
example, bacterial strains have
been developed that could cause
a national disaster.
In the case of the sheep, the
Agriculture Department sent
two veterinarians from the
Utah Satte Agricultural College,
Dr. Kent van Kampen and Dr.
Lynn James, to determine the
cause of the mysterious deaths.
They performed several autop
sies which indicated the sheep
had died from disorders of the
central nervous system.
Not long afterward, both vet
erinarians came down with the
same symptoms that had afflict
ed the sheepherder. This startl
ing development was immedi
ately hushed up by the federal
officials in charge of the in
vestigation.

The question remains whether
the next seepage could leave
dead people instad of sheep.
Th Defense Department has
been working on a wide range
of germ warfare, most of it
very secret. However, we can re
port that a new virus germ has
been developed, and rickettsia
strains against which the world
has no immunity. This has been
accomplished by using chemi
cals, radiation, ultraviolet light
and other agents to produce bac
teriological freaks or mutants.
Some are so deadly that uni
versities in the vicinity of the
Army's Pine Bluff, Ark., labora
tories have been given secret
contracts to test the wild life
constantly for the slightest sign
of escaped virus. Elaborate pre
cautions are taken, of course, to
confine the bizarre germs to the
labs.
KENNEDY TACTICS
WASHINGTON—The old pros
in politics secretly can't help ad
miring Bobby Kennedy's tactics
in his last-minute grab for the
Presidency. Yet they wonder
how far it will get.
They compare it to Hitler's
blitzkrieg, during the early days
of the war, which was successful
not so much because the Nazis
had military power but because

the Low Countries thought they
did.
Kennedy's campaign Is care
fully grooved along that same
line. Most of his crowds so far
have been on college campuses
where he knew he could be en
sured built-in enthusiasm. To
offset student criticism of Ken
nedy's Johnny-comelately chal
lenge to the more courageous
Gene McCarthy, Bobby has had
the advantage of advance men
who spend several days stoking
up enthusiasm, plus usually two
brass bands—all financed from
the $500 million Kennedy family
fortune.
McCarthy can't possibly af
ford either bands or advance
men, let alone the $20 bills wheh
Bobby's advance men sometimes
sprinkle among student leaders.
Exerts Pressure
The second phase of the Ken
nedy blitzkrieg takes the form
of a telephone camapign to local
leaders. This is conducted by
Sen. Teddy Kennedy, D-Mass.,
and a battery of staff members.
When a Kennedy henchman
phones a New York City assem
blyman to ask: "Senator Ken
nedy wants to know whether
you are with him," the assem
blyman almost jumps out of his
shoes. He knows that Bobby has
the power and the money to run

a candidate against him. Natur
ally, an assemblyman isn't look
ing for trouble. Usually he
jumps to Kennedy.
Frank Rossetti, head of Tam
many Hall, was one of the first
to jump, even though Bobby op
posed his selection to be head
of Tammany. "What the hell did
Johnson ever do for me?" said
Rossetti as he jumped.
Others in New York who have
jimped are the following Con
gressmen: Jonathan Bingham of
the Bronx, John Dow just across
the Hudson River, William F.
Ryan of Manhattan, James
Scheuer of the Bronx, and Ben
jamin Rosenthal of Long Island.
It's significant that all are
young Congressmen from mar
ginal districts that could easily
go Republican. They can't af
ford a Kennedy-backed Demo
crat running against them in the
primary. Yet this was what they
faced if they didn't jump.
Bobby has usually talked per
sonally to key Congressmen. His
argument is: "This is my state
and I need all the delegates. If I
don't have my own state with
me at the convention, what do
I look like? If the leaders arc
not with me, I'm going to run
my own slate."

KENNEDY TACTICS
WASHINGTON—The old pros
in politics secretly can't help ad
miring Bobby Kennedy's tactics
in his last-minute grab for the
Presidency. Yet they wonder
how far it will get.
They compare it to Hitler's
blitzkrieg, during the early days
of the war, which was successful
not so much because the Nazis
had military power but because

the Low Countries thought they
did.
Kennedy's campaign Is care
fully grooved along that same
line. Most of his crowds so far
have been on college campuses
where he knew he could be en
sured built-in enthusiasm. To
offset student criticism of Ken
nedy's Johnny-comelately chal
lenge to the more courageous
Gene McCarthy, Bobby has had
the advantage of advance men
who spend several days stoking
up enthusiasm, plus usually two
brass bands—all financed from
the $500 million Kennedy family
fortune.
McCarthy can't possibly af
ford either bands or advance
men, let alone the $20 bills wheh
Bobby's advance men sometimes
sprinkle among student leaders.
Exerts Pressure
The second phase of the Ken
nedy blitzkrieg takes the form
of a telephone camapign to local
leaders. This is conducted by
Sen. Teddy Kennedy, D-Mass.,
and a battery of staff members.
When a Kennedy henchman
phones a New York City assem
blyman to ask: "Senator Ken
nedy wants to know whether
you are with him," the assem
blyman almost jumps out of his
shoes. He knows that Bobby has
the power and the money to run

a candidate against him. Natur
ally, an assemblyman isn't look
ing for trouble. Usually he
jumps to Kennedy.
Frank Rossetti, head of Tam
many Hall, was one of the first
to jump, even though Bobby op
posed his selection to be head
of Tammany. "What the hell did
Johnson ever do for me?" said
Rossetti as he jumped.
Others in New York who have
jimped are the following Con
gressmen: Jonathan Bingham of
the Bronx, John Dow just across
the Hudson River, William F.
Ryan of Manhattan, James
Scheuer of the Bronx, and Ben
jamin Rosenthal of Long Island.
It's significant that all are
young Congressmen from mar
ginal districts that could easily
go Republican. They can't af
ford a Kennedy-backed Demo
crat running against them in the
primary. Yet this was what they
faced if they didn't jump.
Bobby has usually talked per
sonally to key Congressmen. His
argument is: "This is my state
and I need all the delegates. If I
don't have my own state with
me at the convention, what do
I look like? If the leaders arc
not with me, I'm going to run
my own slate."

WASHINGTON—The incident
of the 6,000 dead sheep in west
ern Utah has raised the ominous
possibility that people, too, may
be in danger from chemical and
germ warfare experiments.
This column has learned, for
example, that the veterinarians
who examined the dead sheep
have complained of strange
symptoms themselves. The Bas
que sheepherder who had been
tending the ill-fated flock also
suffered from nausea, head
aches, dizziness and diarrhea.
The sheep had been grazing
near the Army's Dugway Prov
ing Grounds, where the Army
has been testing nerve gas. The
suspicion is that the sheep got
a whiff of the deadly gas, which
somehow seeped out of the test
area.
This has caused an urgent re
appraisal of the safeguards at
other chemical and biological
warfare centers. For it is known
that the Army is experimenting
with paralyzing, odorless gases
and deadly mutant microbes in
more populated places than the
sagebrush country of western
Utah.
Widespread Research
Research in chemical or germ
warfare is going on at the
Rocky Mountain Arsenal near
Denver; Pine Bluff Arsenal, 40
miles from Little Rock, Ark.;
Fort Dietrich, outside Frederick,
Md., 40 miles from the nation's
capital; Edgewood Arsenal, Md.;
Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.; and
a civilian laboratory at Newport,
Ind. In addition, 50 research
contracts have been granted to
various universities.
There are no known antidotes
for some of the gases and germs
that have been developed. At
the Pine Bluff Laboratories, for
example, bacterial strains have
been developed that could cause
a national disaster.
In the case of the sheep, the
Agriculture Department sent
two veterinarians from the
Utah Satte Agricultural College,
Dr. Kent van Kampen and Dr.
Lynn James, to determine the
cause of the mysterious deaths.
They performed several autop
sies which indicated the sheep
had died from disorders of the
central nervous system.

WASHINGTON—The incident
of the 6,000 dead sheep in west
ern Utah has raised the ominous
possibility that people, too, may
be in danger from chemical and
germ warfare experiments.
This column has learned, for
example, that the veterinarians
who examined the dead sheep
have complained of strange
symptoms themselves. The Bas
que sheepherder who had been
tending the ill-fated flock also
suffered from nausea, head
aches, dizziness and diarrhea.
The sheep had been grazing
near the Army's Dugway Prov
ing Grounds, where the Army
has been testing nerve gas. The
suspicion is that the sheep got
a whiff of the deadly gas, which
somehow seeped out of the test
area.
This has caused an urgent re
appraisal of the safeguards at
other chemical and biological
warfare centers. For it is known
that the Army is experimenting
with paralyzing, odorless gases
and deadly mutant microbes in
more populated places than the
sagebrush country of western
Utah.
Widespread Research
Research in chemical or germ
warfare is going on at the
Rocky Mountain Arsenal near
Denver; Pine Bluff Arsenal, 40
miles from Little Rock, Ark.;
Fort Dietrich, outside Frederick,
Md., 40 miles from the nation's
capital; Edgewood Arsenal, Md.;
Eglin Air Force Base, Fla.; and
a civilian laboratory at Newport,
Ind. In addition, 50 research
contracts have been granted to
various universities.
There are no known antidotes
for some of the gases and germs
that have been developed. At
the Pine Bluff Laboratories, for
example, bacterial strains have
been developed that could cause
a national disaster.
In the case of the sheep, the
Agriculture Department sent
two veterinarians from the
Utah Satte Agricultural College,
Dr. Kent van Kampen and Dr.
Lynn James, to determine the
cause of the mysterious deaths.
They performed several autop
sies which indicated the sheep
had died from disorders of the
central nervous system.
Not long afterward, both vet
erinarians came down with the
same symptoms that had afflict
ed the sheepherder. This startl
ing development was immedi
ately hushed up by the federal
officials in charge of the in
vestigation.

The question remains whether
the next seepage could leave
dead people instad of sheep.
Th Defense Department has
been working on a wide range
of germ warfare, most of it
very secret. However, we can re
port that a new virus germ has
been developed, and rickettsia
strains against which the world
has no immunity. This has been
accomplished by using chemi
cals, radiation, ultraviolet light
and other agents to produce bac
teriological freaks or mutants.
Some are so deadly that uni
versities in the vicinity of the
Army's Pine Bluff, Ark., labora
tories have been given secret
contracts to test the wild life
constantly for the slightest sign
of escaped virus. Elaborate pre
cautions are taken, of course, to
confine the bizarre germs to the
labs.
KENNEDY TACTICS
WASHINGTON—The old pros
in politics secretly can't help ad
miring Bobby Kennedy's tactics
in his last-minute grab for the
Presidency. Yet they wonder
how far it will get.
They compare it to Hitler's
blitzkrieg, during the early days
of the war, which was successful
not so much because the Nazis
had military power but because

the Low Countries thought they
did.
Kennedy's campaign Is care
fully grooved along that same
line. Most of his crowds so far
have been on college campuses
where he knew he could be en
sured built-in enthusiasm. To
offset student criticism of Ken
nedy's Johnny-comelately chal
lenge to the more courageous
Gene McCarthy, Bobby has had
the advantage of advance men
who spend several days stoking
up enthusiasm, plus usually two
brass bands—all financed from
the $500 million Kennedy family
fortune.
McCarthy can't possibly af

men, let alone the $20 bills wheh
