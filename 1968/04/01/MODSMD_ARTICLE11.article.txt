## 'Wallstop' Defends His War 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON—The decision
to bring Gen. William C. West
moreland back to the United
States caught Washington com
pletely by surprise. Even Joseph
Wallstop, the syndicated Hawk
and widely read pundit, had been
kept in the dark on the Presi
dent's plans.
This didn't go down too well
with Wallstop when I saw him a
few days later at the Army-
Navy Club.
"No one consulted me,," Wall
stop complained. "I had to read
about Westmoreland's recall in
the newspapers."
"It's typical of the President,"
I said, trying to placate my
friend. "The people involved are
the last to know."
"Even Westmoreland knew be
fore I did," Wallstop said.

"But not by much," I pointed
out.
"Well, I think it's sheer idi
ocy," Wallstop asaid angrily.
"Just when the tide has turned
and we have the Viet Cong and
the North Vietnamese on the
run, and the Hue offensive
proved once and for all that we
were fighting paper tigers, John
son has given in to political ex
pediency. Doesn't the President
know that I need Westmoreland
in Vietnam?"
"But there will be other gen
erals, Joe, and I'm sure they'll
work with you."
"That's not the point," Wall
stop said. "Westmoreland under
stands my strategy. He's a
search and destroy' man as I
am; he understands my attrition
policies. This is no time for me

to break in a new commanding
general."
"But Joe, there has been some
criticism of those policies since
the Tet offensive. There are even
some military experts who say
that they are not working."
"Well, those experts will soon
have jam on their faces. Of
course, I can't be responsible for
every minor setback in Vietnam,
particularly when the President
won't give me the troops I've
asked for."
"That's right," I said. "You
did call up the reserves last
month, didn't you?"
"I certainly did, not just in
one column, but in three. Yet
the President overruled me. I
can't get it through to the Ad
ministration that if I'm going to
be proven right in my column,
I need at least 500,000 more
men."
"Joe, do you think if we had
a million American men in Viet
nam we could win the war?"
"Maybe not at first, but we
certainly could get the pacifica
tion program off the ground."
"And then win the hearts and
minds of the Vietnamese peo
ple," I said.
"Exactly. But every time I
make a suggestion and the Ad
ministration rejects it, they
dance in the streets of Hanoi."
"That's not easy to do with
all the bombing going on," I
agreed. "Tell me, Joe, why can't
anyone else in Washington see
the Vietnam problem as clearly
as you do':'"
"Because they don't have ac
cess to captured enemy docu
ments," Joe said. He opened his
briefcase and handed me a sheaf
of papers. "Read them and then
tell me if we aren't winning the
war."
"They're all printed in Viet
namese, Joe."
"Well, you can guess what
they say, can't you?" he said,
putting them back in his brief
case.
'Tell me, Joe. Now that West
moreland is coming back to the
United States, do you think
you'll be consulted about his re
placement?"
"If I'm not, I can't guarantee
the war will continue as well as
it's going now."

run, and the Hue offensive
proved once and for all that we
were fighting paper tigers, John
son has given in to political ex
pediency. Doesn't the President
know that I need Westmoreland
in Vietnam?"
"But there will be other gen
erals, Joe, and I'm sure they'll
work with you."
"That's not the point," Wall
stop said. "Westmoreland under
stands my strategy. He's a
search and destroy' man as I
am; he understands my attrition
policies. This is no time for me

to break in a new commanding
general."
"But Joe, there has been some
criticism of those policies since
the Tet offensive. There are even
some military experts who say
that they are not working."
"Well, those experts will soon
have jam on their faces. Of
course, I can't be responsible for
every minor setback in Vietnam,
particularly when the President
won't give me the troops I've
asked for."
"That's right," I said. "You
did call up the reserves last
month, didn't you?"
"I certainly did, not just in
one column, but in three. Yet
the President overruled me. I
can't get it through to the Ad
ministration that if I'm going to
be proven right in my column,
I need at least 500,000 more
men."
"Joe, do you think if we had
a million American men in Viet
nam we could win the war?"
"Maybe not at first, but we
certainly could get the pacifica
tion program off the ground."
"And then win the hearts and
minds of the Vietnamese peo
ple," I said.
"Exactly. But every time I
make a suggestion and the Ad
ministration rejects it, they
dance in the streets of Hanoi."
"That's not easy to do with
all the bombing going on," I
agreed. "Tell me, Joe, why can't
anyone else in Washington see
the Vietnam problem as clearly
as you do':'"
"Because they don't have ac
cess to captured enemy docu
ments," Joe said. He opened his
briefcase and handed me a sheaf
of papers. "Read them and then
tell me if we aren't winning the
war."
"They're all printed in Viet
namese, Joe."
"Well, you can guess what
they say, can't you?" he said,
putting them back in his brief
case.
'Tell me, Joe. Now that West
moreland is coming back to the
United States, do you think
you'll be consulted about his re
placement?"
"If I'm not, I can't guarantee
the war will continue as well as
it's going now."

WASHINGTON—The decision
to bring Gen. William C. West
moreland back to the United
States caught Washington com
pletely by surprise. Even Joseph
Wallstop, the syndicated Hawk
and widely read pundit, had been
kept in the dark on the Presi
dent's plans.
This didn't go down too well
with Wallstop when I saw him a
few days later at the Army-
Navy Club.
"No one consulted me,," Wall
stop complained. "I had to read
about Westmoreland's recall in
the newspapers."
"It's typical of the President,"
I said, trying to placate my
friend. "The people involved are
the last to know."
"Even Westmoreland knew be
fore I did," Wallstop said.

"But not by much," I pointed
out.
"Well, I think it's sheer idi
ocy," Wallstop asaid angrily.
"Just when the tide has turned
and we have the Viet Cong and
the North Vietnamese on the
run, and the Hue offensive
proved once and for all that we
were fighting paper tigers, John
son has given in to political ex
pediency. Doesn't the President
