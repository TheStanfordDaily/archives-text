# Letters To The Editor
## Freshman Nixes Coed Living 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
This is not a letter that I want
to write, or that should need to
be written. Unfortunately, I've
been forced to write it.
I went to several open houses
for fraternity rush. I went be
cause I want to join a frat. At
the present time, I see no better
way for myself to get the most
out of college than joining a
frat.
Contrary to a recent well-pub
licized survey of freshman living
preferences, I—and many of my
friends—do not wish to live in
a coed dormitory. I have been
asked why I choose frats over
coed houses. Why? Because I
have been anything but im
pressed with the existing coed
houses at Stanford. They have
been lauded as being less arti
ficial than fraternities. I find
that the are at least as arti
ficial.
I hadn't realized that living
in the same dorm (and in some
cases, the same room) as girls
was a completely natural and
widely accepted thing. I've lived
in the same house with girls at
home and when I get married,
it will be the same. Is there
something wrong with wanting
to live with just a bunch of guys
for a while?
There are certain things that
I have always expected out of
college life that I associate with
all-man living groups. I have
been told by some people that
they hope that eventually all of
Stanford will be coed. If and
when this happens, a sad era
will fall on our school. Where
will freshman boys go for their
panty raids in the spring?
A little frustration at having
to have your girl meet you in
the lobby and then escort you
to her room never hurt anyone.
And what will become of those
eager upperclassmen that hover
around Roble for the first few
weeks of fall quarter?
Because I prefer fraternity
living, I have been called, among
other things, prejudiced, narrow
minded, and abnormal. I have
even been accused of being
afraid of coed dorms and not lik
ing girls!
I admit that there are many
things wrong with fraternities,
and that they aren't for every
one. But coed dorms aren't for
everyone either, and I am one
of those people.
All I ask is that I and my
friends be left alone to decide
what type of housing we prefer
without being stepped on by
those who disagree with us. Or
is freedom of choice disappear
ing from Stanford too?

Editor, The Daily:
I was amazed to find no proph
esying for the future in the
lauditory articles in the Daily
and Observer on the successes
of coed housing. Does Stanford
feel it has finally extirpated the
last irrational vestiges of social
convention? I hope no.
The focus of the next battle
that must be fought was, I
think, unwittingly pointed out
in Dr. Katz's remark in the
March Observer that "co-edu
cational housing avoids 'over
idealization' of the opposite sex
and a good deal of the 'mutual
teasing and destructive behav
ior' characteristic of campus
dating."
A good deal of such over
idealization is due to the prob
lem of sexual relations, and coed
housing plainly fails to deal di
rectly with this. Stanford stu
dents may henceforth be wpII
prepared to relate socially, but
how about sexually?
I think that the next step
must be an optional housing
program for opposite-sex room
mates and seminars where
roommates would probe the eth
ical and moral problems in
volved in co-habitation, sexual
exploitation, etc. Such a pro
gram would, of course, require
explicit faith on the part of the
Trustees in the Stanford motto
("Let the winds of Freedom
Blow") and a radical change in
the pill prescription practices of
the clinic.

Coffeehouse Called
Essential For Campus
Editor, The Daily:
It is so apparent at times that
those who design the facilities
at Stanford and those who de
cide what to do with them are
not the people who use them.
Do they park here, or rather,
could they park here? Do they
find something esthetic about
long stretches of asphalt? Are
they pleased that our university

is turning out to be a huge rep
lica of their scale model?
But more relevant to a current
issue, where do they go for cof
fee? I was here when they
closed the comfortable Cellar
and opened "plastic" Tresidder.
According to the Daily, of Jan.
31, Prof. Pace of UCLA has dis
covered that Stanford ranks ex
tremely low in "community"
(i.e. "friendly, congenial, cohe
sive atmosphere") compared
with other schools. . . .
He also says "yet the forces
which have transformed the
campus from a peaceful island
of study and contemplation are
so powerful it is hard to imagine
how to combat them." Even the
problems faced by Greg Yahna
in finding a suitable place for
his coffeehouse read like tragi
comedy. Suddenly something
has become too expensive to
renovate or any other conceiv
able use for it has a higher
priority. . . .
Our university has a wonder
ful quality of being both bound
ed and infinite, but it has two
dimensions, and it's expanding
in the wrong direction. I would
like to ask whatever happened
to the old Cellar? Perhaps we
could liberate it.

I was amazed to find no proph
esying for the future in the
lauditory articles in the Daily
and Observer on the successes
of coed housing. Does Stanford
feel it has finally extirpated the
last irrational vestiges of social
convention? I hope no.
The focus of the next battle
that must be fought was, I
think, unwittingly pointed out
in Dr. Katz's remark in the
March Observer that "co-edu
cational housing avoids 'over
idealization' of the opposite sex
and a good deal of the 'mutual
teasing and destructive behav
ior' characteristic of campus
dating."
A good deal of such over
idealization is due to the prob
lem of sexual relations, and coed
housing plainly fails to deal di
rectly with this. Stanford stu
dents may henceforth be wpII
prepared to relate socially, but
how about sexually?
I think that the next step
must be an optional housing
program for opposite-sex room
mates and seminars where
roommates would probe the eth
ical and moral problems in
volved in co-habitation, sexual
exploitation, etc. Such a pro
gram would, of course, require
explicit faith on the part of the
Trustees in the Stanford motto
("Let the winds of Freedom
Blow") and a radical change in
the pill prescription practices of
the clinic.

This is not a letter that I want
to write, or that should need to
be written. Unfortunately, I've
been forced to write it.
I went to several open houses
for fraternity rush. I went be
cause I want to join a frat. At
the present time, I see no better
way for myself to get the most
out of college than joining a
frat.
Contrary to a recent well-pub
licized survey of freshman living
preferences, I—and many of my
friends—do not wish to live in
a coed dormitory. I have been
asked why I choose frats over
coed houses. Why? Because I
have been anything but im
pressed with the existing coed
houses at Stanford. They have
been lauded as being less arti
ficial than fraternities. I find
that the are at least as arti
ficial.
I hadn't realized that living
in the same dorm (and in some
cases, the same room) as girls
was a completely natural and
widely accepted thing. I've lived
in the same house with girls at
home and when I get married,
it will be the same. Is there
something wrong with wanting
to live with just a bunch of guys
for a while?
There are certain things that
I have always expected out of
college life that I associate with
all-man living groups. I have
been told by some people that
they hope that eventually all of
Stanford will be coed. If and
when this happens, a sad era
will fall on our school. Where
will freshman boys go for their
panty raids in the spring?
A little frustration at having
to have your girl meet you in
the lobby and then escort you
to her room never hurt anyone.
And what will become of those
eager upperclassmen that hover
around Roble for the first few
weeks of fall quarter?
Because I prefer fraternity
living, I have been called, among
other things, prejudiced, narrow
minded, and abnormal. I have
even been accused of being
afraid of coed dorms and not lik
ing girls!
I admit that there are many
things wrong with fraternities,
and that they aren't for every
one. But coed dorms aren't for
everyone either, and I am one
of those people.

ADAM BONIT, M.D.
Editor, The Daily:
This is not a letter that I want
to write, or that should need to
be written. Unfortunately, I've
been forced to write it.
I went to several open houses
for fraternity rush. I went be
cause I want to join a frat. At
the present time, I see no better
way for myself to get the most
out of college than joining a
frat.
Contrary to a recent well-pub
licized survey of freshman living
preferences, I—and many of my
friends—do not wish to live in
a coed dormitory. I have been
asked why I choose frats over
coed houses. Why? Because I
have been anything but im
pressed with the existing coed
houses at Stanford. They have
been lauded as being less arti
ficial than fraternities. I find
that the are at least as arti
ficial.
I hadn't realized that living
in the same dorm (and in some
cases, the same room) as girls
was a completely natural and
widely accepted thing. I've lived
in the same house with girls at
home and when I get married,
it will be the same. Is there
something wrong with wanting
to live with just a bunch of guys
for a while?
There are certain things that
I have always expected out of
college life that I associate with
all-man living groups. I have
been told by some people that
they hope that eventually all of
Stanford will be coed. If and
when this happens, a sad era
will fall on our school. Where
will freshman boys go for their
panty raids in the spring?
A little frustration at having
to have your girl meet you in
the lobby and then escort you
to her room never hurt anyone.
And what will become of those
eager upperclassmen that hover
around Roble for the first few
weeks of fall quarter?
Because I prefer fraternity
living, I have been called, among
other things, prejudiced, narrow
minded, and abnormal. I have
even been accused of being
afraid of coed dorms and not lik
ing girls!
I admit that there are many
things wrong with fraternities,
and that they aren't for every
one. But coed dorms aren't for
everyone either, and I am one
of those people.
All I ask is that I and my
friends be left alone to decide
what type of housing we prefer
without being stepped on by
those who disagree with us. Or
is freedom of choice disappear
ing from Stanford too?

Alum Says More Sex

Editor, The Daily:
I was amazed to find no proph
esying for the future in the
lauditory articles in the Daily
and Observer on the successes
of coed housing. Does Stanford
feel it has finally extirpated the
last irrational vestiges of social
convention? I hope no.
The focus of the next battle
that must be fought was, I
think, unwittingly pointed out
in Dr. Katz's remark in the
March Observer that "co-edu
cational housing avoids 'over
idealization' of the opposite sex
and a good deal of the 'mutual
teasing and destructive behav
ior' characteristic of campus
dating."
A good deal of such over
idealization is due to the prob
lem of sexual relations, and coed
housing plainly fails to deal di
rectly with this. Stanford stu
dents may henceforth be wpII
prepared to relate socially, but
how about sexually?
I think that the next step
must be an optional housing
program for opposite-sex room
mates and seminars where
roommates would probe the eth
ical and moral problems in
volved in co-habitation, sexual
exploitation, etc. Such a pro
gram would, of course, require
explicit faith on the part of the
Trustees in the Stanford motto
("Let the winds of Freedom
Blow") and a radical change in
the pill prescription practices of
the clinic.
