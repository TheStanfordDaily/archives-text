# McCarthy A Low-Keyed Liberal
## 
### Max Lerner 
WASHINGTON—At this point
I don't know what's going to
happen to Eugene McCarthy,
but whatever it is, I like the
way it is happening. In an era
like ours, and a year like the
present one, it is a sweet and
heartening thing to have a man
emerge who adds a dimension
of sanity and courage and grace
to the political fracas.
The New Hampshire primary
was an ordeal, and Wisconsin
has been one, too. Each of them
offered him chance after chance
to do or say the wrong thing.
He hasn't done it or said it.
These cruel primaries bring out
the worst and the best in those
who have to suffer them. They
separate the men from the mere
ly candidates. The test is battle
—the test of mind and style and
personality structure, and Gene

McCarthy is coming through the
test beautifully.
I like McCarthy. I like his
modesty and casualness. In a
situation where some candidates
behave like princes and heirs
apparent, and some like tired
Roman emperors, and some like
image-merchants, and some like
lightning calculators of political
advantage and disadvantage,
and some like liberal or reaction
s'y demagogs, McCarthy be
haves only like himself. I like
his low-keyed temperateness
about many things and his quiet
passion about the war and the
peace. I like his refusal to man
euver and manipulate and make
deals.
I like McCarthy's brand of
liberalism, which is not that of
the fanatical True Believer, but
a blend of relative humanism
tempered by the pragmatic. I
like his knowledge of foreign
policy and how he has func
tioned on the Senate committee
in that area. I like his concern at
once with the farmer and the
cities. I like his stand on the
recent CIA crisis and the way

he tried to set limits on CIA
autonomy.
But there are other liberals,
and some of them are more mili
tant than McCarthy, and more
flamboyant, or perhaps only
louder. What I like best about
McCarthy, I suppose, is the
character and personality struc
ture that have been revealed. I
like his refusal to be caught up
in the furor Americanus — the
drive to action for action's sake.
This involves a detached and
contemplative quality which
some of my readers may believe
unfits a man for the Presidency.
I don't think it does. Two very
different Presidents like Jeffer
son and Lincoln had it, and while
it didn't hurt their functions as
President, it enhanced the dimen
sion of their greatness.
It is curious that Americans
should cast their Presidents in
the image of hard-driving sales
men or businessman, as if the
best President were a whirling
dervish. The trouble with Wood
row Wilson was not that he was
an intellectual but that he was
a neurotically driven man who
equated himself with God. John

Kennedy, who was also some
thing of an intellectual, didn't
suffer that confusion of roles. It
would be good, after Lincoln and
Wilson and Kennedy, to have an
intellectual politician in the
White House again.
Like John Kennedy, McCarthy
has a feel for irony and a wry
sense of humor which enables
him to laugh at himself while he
digs at his opponents. Even his
religious sense, as a committed
Catholic, does not exclude this
gift for the ironic. Adlai Steven
son had it, too, and in many ways
McCarthy learned from Steven
son, whom he supported strong
ly at the 1960 convention to the
displeasure of the Kennedys. I
confess I was concerned at the
start, lest McCarthy turn out to
be a political amateur as Steven
son was. But the primary cam
paigns have reassured us all on
that score. Whatever Steven
sonion qualities he may have or
lack, McCarthy is far more of a
political pro than Adlai was.
Man of Thought, Action
I like his being a man of ac
tion who thinks, and a man of
thought who is ready to act. It

would be inspiriting to have that
kind of blend in the White
House. I like his relation to the
young, whom he has won not
only by what he says but by
what he is, as a person. I am
tired of seeing the generational
split stretch endlessly on. Mc-
Carthy could help heal it. I like
the way he enjoys what the
young people have done not only
for him but to him.
Even in hard, practical terms,
which is where the Bobby Ken
nedy supporters think he has it
all over McCarthy, my answer is
— it ain't necessarily so. True,
Kennedy has an enthusiastic and
articulate following, but it is also
true that half the nation is as
deeply hostile to him as the oth
er half is intensely for him.
Kennedy's danger, whether at
the convention or in the election,
is that he polarizes the nation,
evoking strong loyalties and
hates. McCarthy doesn't alienate
people. He is no polarizer. "What
we need now," he said in Milwau
kee, "is a reconciliation in this
land." Just possibly he might
achieve it.
