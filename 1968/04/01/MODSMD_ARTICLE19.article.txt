# 'Neat And Clean For Gene'
## McCarthy Gets Students' Help 
### 
As they did in New Hamp
shire, students are playing an
important role in the Wisconsin
primary.
On the two final weekends be
fore the April 2 primary 5,000
students — mostly from the Mid
west, especially Chicago, but also
from many other areas, includ
ing Texas — have come into
Wisconsin to work for Demo
cratic Presidential candidate Eu
gene McCarthy. They joined
4,000 students from Wisconsin
colleges who are working for
McCarthy.
As in New Hampshire fhe
boys are asked to shorten their
hair and shave their beards
and the girls to leave their
minis at home. Those who
don't comply work behind the
scenes in offices licking enve
luopes, running mimeograph
machines, and answering
phones.

But most of them go door-to
door, trying to got out the vote
for McCarthy. Besides the re
quirement of being "neat and
clean for Gene" they are also
given briefings on how to deal
with the voters. Sometimes those
briefings upset volunteers with
liberal and radical political
views. Reported one student who
was part of a group from Mich
igan canvassing in Waukasha, a
small city outside Milwaukee:
"We were warned that we
might have to sell out quite a bit
to get a big vote for McCarthy.
Waukesha went 80 per cent for
George Wallace in the last Pres
idential primary.
"The first sell-out came when
the campaign headquarters sent
all the Detroit black students
back, from predominantly white
Waukesha, no doubt reasoning
that black students representing
McCarthy would lose him sup
port.

"It was suggested that we
appeal to the issue that each
voter was most liberal on and
avoid antagonizing or arguing.
If they confused Gene with
Joe we were urged to leave
them alone. After all, a vote
for McCarthy is a vote for Mc-
Carthy."
Others find the work difficult
because of their lack of experi
ence in grass roots campaigning
and particularly in dealing with
voter apathy, especially in small
towns. They find some people an
tagonistic but many others seem
almost afraid of the students.
The student end of the cam
paign is run by two graduate
students, Sam Brown of the Har
vard Divinity School and Marge
Sklencar of Mundelein College
in Chicago. The effort is co-ordi
nated by a harried staff of col
legiate volunteers downstairs in
Milwaukee's Wisconsin Hotel,
the McCarthy state headquar
ters.
As in New Hampshire, the Mc-
Carthy campaign is trying to
keep the state from being over
run by students. "They didn't en
courage anybody west of the
Rockies, or else they would have
had 20,000 more," says Michael
Kortshmar, a Swarthmore grad
uate student who left teaching in
a New York city high school two
weeks ago to work for McCarthy.

Although their main work is
canvassing and office work, the
students do many other things
in the campaign. They even run
a darkroom for visiting press
photographers.
The forces of President
Johnson are trying to gather
student volunteers but it is
obvious that the student sup
port all belongs to McCarthy.
The Democratic National Com
mittee provided free busses
for any Young Democrats
from the Chicago area to go
campaign for the President
but only a few took them up
on the ofTer.
It is not only as volun
teers that students are having
an impact on the campaign. Uni
versity of Wisconsin students
shouted down a speech by Sec
retary of Agriculture Orville
Freeman last week, which many
believed would cause adverse re
action to McCarthy among the
voters. McCarthy said "students
for McCarthy are not hecklers.
They have listened and studied
and are still ready to stand and
listen to anyone who comes in
good faith."
But Wisconsin student leaders
believe the Johnson forces are
trying to encourage such demon
strations. Vice President Hubert
Humphrey, and Attorney Gen
lera Ramsey Clark were due in
the state this week.


CURED PATIENT — Paul Bls
singer, Sr. of San Francisco was
cured of cancer of the lymph
nodes by the medical center's
linear accelerator. Along with
other former patients treated at
Stanford, he has launched a fund
raising campaign. These
"Friends of Radiology" hope to
raise $300,000 to expand the fa
cilities of the Department of
Radiology.

McCarthy.
As in New Hampshire fhe
boys are asked to shorten their
hair and shave their beards
and the girls to leave their
minis at home. Those who
don't comply work behind the
scenes in offices licking enve
luopes, running mimeograph
machines, and answering
phones.

But most of them go door-to
door, trying to got out the vote
for McCarthy. Besides the re
quirement of being "neat and
clean for Gene" they are also
given briefings on how to deal
with the voters. Sometimes those
briefings upset volunteers with
liberal and radical political
views. Reported one student who
was part of a group from Mich
igan canvassing in Waukasha, a
small city outside Milwaukee:
"We were warned that we
might have to sell out quite a bit
to get a big vote for McCarthy.
Waukesha went 80 per cent for
George Wallace in the last Pres
idential primary.
"The first sell-out came when
the campaign headquarters sent
all the Detroit black students
back, from predominantly white
Waukesha, no doubt reasoning
that black students representing
McCarthy would lose him sup
port.

"It was suggested that we
appeal to the issue that each
voter was most liberal on and
avoid antagonizing or arguing.
If they confused Gene with
Joe we were urged to leave
them alone. After all, a vote
for McCarthy is a vote for Mc-
Carthy."
Others find the work difficult
because of their lack of experi
ence in grass roots campaigning
and particularly in dealing with
voter apathy, especially in small
towns. They find some people an
tagonistic but many others seem
almost afraid of the students.
The student end of the cam
paign is run by two graduate
students, Sam Brown of the Har
vard Divinity School and Marge
Sklencar of Mundelein College
in Chicago. The effort is co-ordi
nated by a harried staff of col
legiate volunteers downstairs in
Milwaukee's Wisconsin Hotel,
the McCarthy state headquar
ters.
As in New Hampshire, the Mc-
Carthy campaign is trying to
keep the state from being over
run by students. "They didn't en
courage anybody west of the
Rockies, or else they would have
had 20,000 more," says Michael
Kortshmar, a Swarthmore grad
uate student who left teaching in
a New York city high school two
weeks ago to work for McCarthy.

Although their main work is
canvassing and office work, the
students do many other things
in the campaign. They even run
a darkroom for visiting press
photographers.
The forces of President
Johnson are trying to gather
student volunteers but it is
obvious that the student sup
port all belongs to McCarthy.
The Democratic National Com
mittee provided free busses
for any Young Democrats
from the Chicago area to go
campaign for the President
but only a few took them up
on the ofTer.
It is not only as volun
teers that students are having
an impact on the campaign. Uni
versity of Wisconsin students
shouted down a speech by Sec
retary of Agriculture Orville
Freeman last week, which many
believed would cause adverse re
action to McCarthy among the
voters. McCarthy said "students
for McCarthy are not hecklers.
They have listened and studied
and are still ready to stand and
listen to anyone who comes in
good faith."
But Wisconsin student leaders
believe the Johnson forces are
trying to encourage such demon
strations. Vice President Hubert
Humphrey, and Attorney Gen
lera Ramsey Clark were due in
the state this week.


CURED PATIENT — Paul Bls
singer, Sr. of San Francisco was
cured of cancer of the lymph
nodes by the medical center's
linear accelerator. Along with
other former patients treated at
Stanford, he has launched a fund

given briefings on how to deal
with the voters. Sometimes those
briefings upset volunteers with
liberal and radical political
views. Reported one student who
was part of a group from Mich
igan canvassing in Waukasha, a
small city outside Milwaukee:
"We were warned that we
might have to sell out quite a bit
to get a big vote for McCarthy.
Waukesha went 80 per cent for
George Wallace in the last Pres
idential primary.
"The first sell-out came when
the campaign headquarters sent
all the Detroit black students
back, from predominantly white
Waukesha, no doubt reasoning
that black students representing
McCarthy would lose him sup
port.

"It was suggested that we
appeal to the issue that each
voter was most liberal on and
avoid antagonizing or arguing.
If they confused Gene with
Joe we were urged to leave
them alone. After all, a vote
for McCarthy is a vote for Mc-
Carthy."
Others find the work difficult
because of their lack of experi
ence in grass roots campaigning
and particularly in dealing with
voter apathy, especially in small
towns. They find some people an
tagonistic but many others seem
almost afraid of the students.
The student end of the cam
paign is run by two graduate
students, Sam Brown of the Har
vard Divinity School and Marge
Sklencar of Mundelein College
in Chicago. The effort is co-ordi
nated by a harried staff of col
legiate volunteers downstairs in
Milwaukee's Wisconsin Hotel,
the McCarthy state headquar
ters.
As in New Hampshire, the Mc-
Carthy campaign is trying to
keep the state from being over
run by students. "They didn't en
courage anybody west of the
Rockies, or else they would have
had 20,000 more," says Michael
Kortshmar, a Swarthmore grad
uate student who left teaching in
a New York city high school two
weeks ago to work for McCarthy.

Although their main work is
canvassing and office work, the
students do many other things
in the campaign. They even run
a darkroom for visiting press
photographers.
The forces of President
Johnson are trying to gather
student volunteers but it is
obvious that the student sup
port all belongs to McCarthy.
The Democratic National Com
mittee provided free busses
for any Young Democrats
from the Chicago area to go
campaign for the President
but only a few took them up
on the ofTer.
It is not only as volun
teers that students are having
an impact on the campaign. Uni
versity of Wisconsin students
shouted down a speech by Sec
retary of Agriculture Orville
Freeman last week, which many
believed would cause adverse re
action to McCarthy among the
voters. McCarthy said "students
for McCarthy are not hecklers.
They have listened and studied
and are still ready to stand and
listen to anyone who comes in
good faith."
But Wisconsin student leaders
believe the Johnson forces are
trying to encourage such demon
strations. Vice President Hubert
Humphrey, and Attorney Gen
lera Ramsey Clark were due in
the state this week.
