# Trustees Approve New Housing Plan
## 
### 
The University administra
tion's housing reform was
passed without change by the
Board of Trustees March 21.
Roble, Toyon and parts of La
gunita will be converted into co
educational residences next year.
Coeducation will be increased in
Wilbur and Stern halls and coed
Grove house will move into
Hurlburt and Stlllman houses on
the Row.
The trustees also approved
Lambda Nu fraternity's plan to
go coed next year with 20 wom
en. Lambda Nu has agreed to
abandon selective rush after one
year if it wants to continue as a
coed residence.
All women except freshmen
apparently will be allowed to
move off-campus next year. The
trustees gave the president the
authority to change women's
residence requirements, and the
Dean • of Students' office has
drawn up housing plans on the
assumption that women will be
allowed to move off.
Assistant Dean of Students
Sally Mahoney says she will ar

range with house presidents a
series of open houses to allow
students to look over the various
residences before an all-campus
draw to assign housing space.
Miss Mahoney said no decision
has yet been made on the con
troversial issue of draw priori
ties for freshmen and upper
classmen. More information on
the draw procedures will be
available later this week, she
said.
The most striking feature of
the new housing arrangements
is the increase in coed living
space. Next year 1314 under
graduates, including 830 men
and 484 women, will live in 17
coed residences. This year only
527 students live in coed houses.
About one-third the freshman
class will live in coed dormi
tories.
No formal academic "themes"
are planned for the new coefl
residences, Miss Mahoney said.
The four "demonstration"
houses—Grove, Serra, Otero and
Soto—will keep their seminar
programs.
