# Heart Patients Die Needing Donors
## 
### 
Stanford heart surgeons led
by Dr. Norman Shumway have
been ready to perform at least
four transplantation operations
since January 20, but have
lacked suitable donors.
According to Mrs. Jane Duff,
assistant information officer at
the hospital, three of the four
potential recipients have died.
The fourth, a man in his fifties
with severe heart disease, is in
the hospital still considered a
possible recipient of a new
heart.
"Dr. Shumway hopes to be
fble to find a suitable donor
frery soon," Mrs. Duff said yes
terday.
There was speculation Friday
that a transplantation was im
minent because of the presence
of a potential donor in the hos

pital. The donor, a man in his
20's who suffered irreversible
brain damage, was considered
"incompatible," however.
"The potential donor was
judged not acceptable," a
spokesman at the hospital said.
"The decision was made after
studies of a host of criteria in
cluding genetic compatibility."
Whether or not a transplant
is performed here in the near
future "depends on whether the
recipient survives," said a hos
pital spokesman.
Shumway and a team of phys
icians performed the first adult
heart transplant in the United
States on January 6. The recip
ient Mike Kasperak died two
weeks later from a "galaxy of
complications" following the op
eration.
