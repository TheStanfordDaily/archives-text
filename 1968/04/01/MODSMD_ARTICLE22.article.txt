## Parallel To Viet War Seen 
### TRAN VAN DINH College Press Service 
(Tran Van Dinh, Vietnamese
journalist and former acting am
bassador from South Vietnam to
the United States, writes regu

The agony expressed by the
majority of the members of the
Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee jduring the recent testi
mony of Secretary of State Dean
Rusk seemed to convey to the
public that the war in Vietnam
was an accidental mistake and
that the U.S. had stumbled into
an unending quagmire.
Had the senators read careful
ly the history of the U.S. and
especially the Congressional
Records of the years 1898-1913,
they could have spared Dean
Rusk the TV ordeal. For what
is happening now in Vietnam is
like what happened during the
years 1898-1913 in the Philip
pines, another South East Asian
country.
In 1898, the U.S. took the
Philippines from Spain in a brief

war. The defeated Spanish ceded
the Philippines to the U.S. by
the treaty of December 10, 1898.
When the U.S. took over, the
Philippines was in the mid/* 112
a "war of national liberation"
against Spain led by a iw i •
tionary, Emilio Aguinaldo.
At first the U.S. promised in
dependence to the Philippines,
but on December 21, 1898, Presi
dent McKinley issued a procla
mation stating that "the mili
tary government heretofore
maintained by the U.S. in the
city, harbor, and bay of Manila
is to be extended with all possi
ble dispatch to the whole of
ceded territory." Filipino lead
ers, alarmed by the American
plan to impose domination by
military means, tried to negoti
ate with the U.S. military gov
ernor, General Ehvell Otis.
The negotiations which lasted
from January 9 to January 29,
1898 were used by General Otis
to gain time for reinforcements
of troops to arrive, and on Feb
ruary 4, a minor and fabricated
incident was used by General
Otis to launch full hostilities
against the Filippino revolution
aries, who then conducted guer
illa warfare against the U.S.
troops.
General Arthur Mac Arthur
(father of the late General
Douglas Mac Arthur) who re
placed General Otis on May 1,
1900 described the situation of
the Philippines in the following
report:
"Most of the towns secretly
organized complete insurgent

municipal governments, to pro
ceed simultaneously and in the
'■ame sphere as the American
finvernments and in many in
tances through the same per
■onnel. In other words, the
towns, regardless of the fact of
American occupation and town
organization, are the actual
bases for all insurgent military
activities. The success of this
unique system of war depends
almost upon complete unity of
action of the entire population.
That such unity is a fact is too
obvious to admit of discussion."
(Report of the War Department,
Volume I, Part 5, Government
Printing Office, Washington,
1900 pp 61-62.)
General Arthur Mac Arthur in
a proclamation on December 20,
1900, announced that "insur
gents would be regarded as com
mon criminals who we,e violat
ing the 'laws of war' and would
be considered guilty of common
crimes." Prisoners of war were
killed, atrocities were committed
and a United States Senate Com
mittee investigating charges of
cruelty confronted General Mac-
Arthur with figures from his
own reports on casualties of
both sides.
The years' summary showed
801 Filipinos killed and 38
wounded, while 40 Americans
were killed and 72 wounded.
(Senate Document No. 331, p.
894).
Questioned by the Senate as to
the sharp disproportion between
Filipinos killed and wounded (a
ratio of three wounded to every
man killed is considered normal
in wars) Mac Arthur said that
"it arises from the fact that our
soldiers are trained in what we
call 'fire discipline' (or marks
manship)." Training records
were produced and showed, how
ever, that the troops involved
had in fact poor qualifications in
target practice.
As in the war in Vietnam,
houses were destroyed, entire
villages were burnt down. Briga
dier General Robert P. Hughes
told a Senate committee that the
destruction of these villages was
a "punishment" inflicted on
women and children as a way
of punishing the men "probably
worse in that way than any oth
er." When asked if this was nor
mal in civilized war, he replied.
"These people are not civilized."

(Senate document No. 331, p.
559.)
Rope treatment and "water
cure" were used in the Philip
pines. Contributing to brutal
treatment was the widespread
attitude on the part of the white
American soldiers toward what
were looked upon as a racially
inferior people.
The officer commanding the
38th Volunteer Infantry, Colonel
George S. Anderson, in refuting
the charges of abuses, neverthe
less admitted that "It is true
that the word 'nigger' was very
often used as applied to the na
tives, probably correctly" (Sen
ate Document No. 205, Washing
ton 1902, p. 21).
General J. Franklin Bell be
lieved that "with very few ex
ceptions, practically the entire
population has been hostile to
us at heart. In order to combat
such a population, it is neces
sary to make the state of war
as insupportable as possible, and
there is no more efficacious way
of accomplishing this than by
keeping the minds of people in
such a state of anxiety and ap
prehension that living under
such conditions will soon become
intolerable." (Senate document
No. 331, p. 1614.)
It was Bell's estimate that one
sixth of the inhabitants of Lu
zon died from the direct or in
direct effects of the war (a fig
ure approaching 600,000). The
generally accepted figure for
deaths of Filipinos directly due
to the war is 200,000.
Vietnam today is not the Phil
ippines of the beginning of this
century. The NLF is not an iso
lated force which could be ex
terminated by the U.S. power.
But the point is that the U.S.
intervention in South Vietnam is
in many ways a repetition of the
U.S. pacification in the Philip
pines from 1898 to 1913.
No country, no nation, no man
needs to be ashamed of its past
or to feel guilty about it. But no
one should forget Santayana's
words: "Those who refuse to
learn from history are doomed
to repeat it."
