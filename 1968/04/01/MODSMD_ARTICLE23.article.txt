# With Pass-Fail Option
## Study Habits Hard To Change 
### 
If you're an "A" student, you
find it hard to change your
study habits to earn only a "C"
grade—even when that's all that
is necessary and all you want
to achieve.
This seems to he the result of
an experimental "pass-fail" op
tion adopted by the University
of Michigan College of Litera
ture, Science, and the Arts.

Beginning last winter, seniors
were permitted to take one
course outside their major field
of study on a pass-fail basis,
with the credits to count toward
graduation but not toward their
final grade-point average. This
year the faculty has extended
the privilege to junior students
as well. In general, students
have welcomed the innovation as

giving them a chance for aca
demic exploration.
But compilation of grades
achieved by 178 of the 203 stu
dents who took advantage of the
option in its first year indicates
that the "good students" did
their usual level of work in the
pass-fail course. The pass-fail
were in the same classes as stu
dents taking the course under
the traditional grading and
credit system.
The instructor gave all stu
dents the traditional letter
grades, but for those enrolled on
a pass-fail basis, the registrar
recorded only "pass" for those
making C or better, and "fail"
for those getting D's or E's.
Of the 179 students, 98.5 per
cent passed their courses. If
grades had been given, 19.5 per
cent would have received A's, 58
per cent B's, 21 per cent C's,
1 per cent D's, and .5 per cent
E's.
The level of performance ol
the pass-fail students in the
courses was similar to their gen
eral grade point average for all
work taken in the University. In
other words, A students contin
ued to make A's.
Charles Pascal, a research as
sociate who conducted the study
for the Center for Research on
Learning and Teaching, com
ments: "We were surprised that

students were not more adept at
playing this new academic
game."
He said that even though the
students sought only to achieve
a C, or passing level, their prev
ious years of "academic condi
tioning" made it difficult if not
impossible to do so. The stu
dents themselves were sur
prised, he says. One pass-fail
student expressed it this way:
"I'm trying hard not to work
and I still made a B-plus on the
midterm exam. I find myself
trying to do the minimum
amount of work to get a C.
Otherwise I am frustrated that
I am wasting time in the (pass
fail) course that I could be
spending on the other courses
(in which grades are recorded)."
Pascal recommends pass-fail
sections, in which all students
are enrolled on the pass-fail sys
tem.

He said that even though the
students sought only to achieve
a C, or passing level, their prev
ious years of "academic condi
tioning" made it difficult if not
impossible to do so. The stu
dents themselves were sur
prised, he says. One pass-fail
student expressed it this way:
"I'm trying hard not to work
and I still made a B-plus on the
midterm exam. I find myself
trying to do the minimum
amount of work to get a C.
Otherwise I am frustrated that
I am wasting time in the (pass
fail) course that I could be
spending on the other courses
(in which grades are recorded)."
Pascal recommends pass-fail
sections, in which all students
are enrolled on the pass-fail sys
tem.
If you're an "A" student, you
find it hard to change your
study habits to earn only a "C"
grade—even when that's all that
is necessary and all you want
to achieve.
This seems to he the result of
an experimental "pass-fail" op
tion adopted by the University
of Michigan College of Litera
ture, Science, and the Arts.

Beginning last winter, seniors
were permitted to take one
course outside their major field
of study on a pass-fail basis,
with the credits to count toward
graduation but not toward their
final grade-point average. This
year the faculty has extended
the privilege to junior students
as well. In general, students
have welcomed the innovation as

giving them a chance for aca
demic exploration.
But compilation of grades
achieved by 178 of the 203 stu
dents who took advantage of the
option in its first year indicates
that the "good students" did
their usual level of work in the
pass-fail course. The pass-fail
were in the same classes as stu
dents taking the course under
the traditional grading and
credit system.
The instructor gave all stu
dents the traditional letter
grades, but for those enrolled on
a pass-fail basis, the registrar
recorded only "pass" for those
making C or better, and "fail"
for those getting D's or E's.
Of the 179 students, 98.5 per
cent passed their courses. If
grades had been given, 19.5 per
cent would have received A's, 58
per cent B's, 21 per cent C's,
1 per cent D's, and .5 per cent
E's.
The level of performance ol
the pass-fail students in the
courses was similar to their gen
eral grade point average for all
work taken in the University. In
other words, A students contin
ued to make A's.
