# U.S. Was 'Duped;' Defector Charges
## 
### 
The fruitless U.S. bombing
pause in North Vietnam during
the winter of 1965-66 was the di
rect result of a phony peace
"feeler" extended to the State
Department by Hungary's for
eign minister Janos Peter, a
former Hungarian diplomatic of
ficial now at Stanford has charg
ed.
Writing in the March 22 issue
of Life magazine, Janos Radvan
yi, once the charge d'affairs at
the Hungarian Embassy in
Washington and the highest
ranking diplomat ever to defect
in the U.S., describes the Peter
incident as "a bizarre adventure
in make-believe diplomacy."
Radvanyi, who sought U.S.
citizenship in May of last year,
is now a scholar in residence
here under a grant from the In
stitute for International Edu
cation. He is engaged in a study
on decision making in Commu
nist foreign policy.
In the magazine article he de
scribes in detail the efforts of
Foreign Minister Peter to serve
as an "honest broker" to achieve
a peaceful settlement of the Viet
nam war "without any authori
zation that I have been able to
discover."
Peter initiated the negotiations

with the U.S. State Department
"on the basis of a trip (to Ha
noi) he had not taken and knowl
edge he did not have," Radvanyi
says. "Peter's advice contributed
materially to the American deci
sion to suspend the bombing of
North Vietnam for Christmas,
1965 through January, 1966."
In a personal interview with
Secretary of State Dean Rusk,
at which Radvanyi was present,
Peter claimed to be in "intimate
contact" with Hanoi and said: "If
the U.S. stops the bombings, it
will not be a one-sided step, but
rather a new beginning."
