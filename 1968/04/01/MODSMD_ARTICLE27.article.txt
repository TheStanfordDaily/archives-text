# 'Days Of Concern'
## Sen. Case To Speak On War 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Sen. Clifford Case will be the
featured speaker in a "Days of
Concern" program here April 12
& 13 on the impact of the Viet
nam war on the university.
The Days of Concern replace
an anti-draft protest originally
planned for April 11 by the stu
dent legislature.
Case, a liberal Republican
from New Jersey, will wind up
the program with an address on
"The War, the University and
the Future of American Society"
at 2 p.m. Saturday. April 13 in
Memorial Auditorium.
Organized by a committee of
students, faculty and administra
tors, the two-day forum will con
sist of three major speeches and
two panel discussions in Memo
rial Auditorium, a noon rally in
White Plaza Friday, discussions
in University residences, and a
"vigil" in Memorial Church.
Former CBS correspondent
David Schoenbrun will speak Sat
urday morning on "The Univer
sity and Its Role in a Changing
America." Schoenbrun is now a
lecturer on international affairs
at Columbia University.
The third speaker has not
been announced.
The Days of Concern grew out
of a Feb. 29 resolution by the
student legislature calling for a
"demonstration to protest the
draft and to show concern about
the war in Vietnam." The legis

lature asked all students and
faculty to boycott classes in
support of the protest.
The plan immediately drew
criticism as a "student strike."
Some newspapers described it
as an attempt to "close down
Stanford University." Legisla
ture speaker Michael Weinstein
responded by saying that the
class boycott was incidental to
the rest of the protest activities.
At a meeting March 10 in the
office of B. Davie Napier, dean
of the chapel, an informal group
of students, facu'ty and admin
istrators debated the April 11
proposal and rejected the legis
lature's resolution. As a substi
tute, the majority of the group
favored a two-day program
sponsored and financed by the
University. Instead of Thursday,
April 11, the program was shift
ed to Friday and Saturday to
avoid conflict with classes.
An ad-hoc steering committee
formed to organize the Days of
Concern. Its members are Ray
mond Bacchetti, associate pro
vost, Willard Wyman, associate
dean of students, Mark Mancall,
history professor, Robert Acker
man, English professor, and stu
dents Barry Askinas and Chris
Harte. Associated Students Pres
ident Cesare Massarenti worked
with the committee.
Gradually the committee shift
ed the emphasis of the program
from "protest" to "concern." By

choosing speakers and topics the
committee also toned down the
anti-war theme of the program.
At one meeting a delegation of
four right-wing students, includ
ing members of the Young Re
publicans, Young Americans for
Freedom, and the editor of the
"Arena," demanded the steering
committee invite conservative
speakers to "balance" the pro
gram.
Now the committee says "nei
ther the justification for the
war nor the objectives of Ameri
can foreign policy will be cen
tral to the program. Rather, the
principal aim of Days of Con
cern is to develop an understand
ing of the far-reaching effects of
the social crisis, whether stem
ming from the war or other
forces, on the educational philos
ophy and policies of the univer
sities."
The details of the program
will be completed by the commit
tee this week. Still to be an
nounced are speakers at the
kick-off rally Friday in White
Plaza. Following the rally, the
first speaker, still unannounced,
will discuss "The University;
Servant or Critic of Society?"
A panel discussion will follow
with Richard Lyman, Stanford
provost; William Rambo, asso
ciate dean of engineering; David
Ransom, English student and
editor of the Midpeninsula Ob
server; and others.
Discussion groups will be or

ganized Friday evening in resi
dences. Later that night Prof.
Robert MacAfee Brown and oth
ers will speak in Memorial
Church.
The Schoenbrun speech Satur
day morning will be followed
by a panel including WilJiam
Clebsch, religion professor, and
Paul R. Tiehl, a San Jose judge
and National Guard general.
Campus political groups have
been invited to plan other activi
ties during the Days of Con
cern. All the events are open to
the general public.

a heroic effort on the part of the Fire Department averted a delay in starting classes.
