MONEY: THE STORY OF AN ENGINEER
We all know, of course, that in this age of technology
every engineering senior is receiving fabulous offers of
employment, but do we realize just how fabulous these
offers are? Do we comprehend just how keenly industry
is competing? To illustrate, let me cite the true and typi
cal case of E. Pluribus Ewbank, a true and typical senior.
One day last week while strolling across the M.I.T
campus, E. Pluribus was hailed by a portly and prosper
ous man who sat in a yellow convertible studded with
precious gem stones. "Hello," said the portly and pros
perous man, "I am Portly Prosperous, president of
American Xerographic Data Processing and Birth Con
trol, Incorporated. Are you a senior?"
"Yes, sir," said E. Pluribus.
"Do you like this car?" said Portly.
"Yes, sir," said E. Pluribus.
"It's yours," said Portly.
"Thanks, hey," said E. Pluribus.
"Do you like Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades?"
said Portly.
"What clean living, clean shaven American does not?"
said E. Pluribus.
"Here is a pack," said Portly. "And a new pack will
be delivered to you every twelve minutes as long as you
live."
"Thanks, hey," said E. Pluribus.
"Would your wife like a mink coat?" said Portly.
"I feel sure she would," said E. Pluribus, "but I am
not married."
"Do you want to be ?" said Portly.
"What clean living, clean shaven American does not?"
said E. Pluribus.
Portly pressed a button on the dashboard of the con
vertible and the trunk opened up and out came a nubile
maiden with golden hair, rosy knees, a perfect disposi
tion, and the appendix already removed. "This is Svet
lana O'Toole," said Portly. "Would you like to marry her?"
"Is her appendix out?" said E. Pluribus.
"Yes," said Portly.
"Okay, hey," said E. Pluribus.
"Congratulations," said Portly. "And for the happy
bride, a set of .SOO monogrammed prawn forks."
"Thanks, hey," said Svetlana.

"Now then," said Portly to E. Pluribus, "let us get
down to business. My company will start you at $75,000
a year. You will retire at full salary upon reaching the
age of 2<i. We will give you an eleven-story house made of
lapis lazuli, each room to be stocked with edible furniture.
Your children will receive a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as they
shall live. We will keep your teeth in good repair and also
the teeth of your wife and children unto the third genera
tion. We will send your dentist a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as
he shall live, and thereafter to his heirs and assigns...
Now, son, I want you to think carefully about this offer.
Meanwhile here is 50 thousand dollars in small, un
marked bills which places you under no obligation what
soever."
"Well, it certainly seems like a fair offer," said E.
Pluribus. "But there is something you should know. I am
not an engineer. In fact I don't go to M.I.T. at all. I just
walked over here to admire the trees. I am at Harvard,
majoring in Joyce Kilmer."
"Oh," said Portly.
"I guess I don't get to keep the money and the con
vertible and the Personnas and the broad, do I?" said E.
Pluribus.
"Of course you do," said Portly. "And if you'd like the
job, my offer still stands."

MONEY: THE STORY OF AN ENGINEER
We all know, of course, that in this age of technology
every engineering senior is receiving fabulous offers of
employment, but do we realize just how fabulous these
offers are? Do we comprehend just how keenly industry
is competing? To illustrate, let me cite the true and typi
cal case of E. Pluribus Ewbank, a true and typical senior.
One day last week while strolling across the M.I.T
campus, E. Pluribus was hailed by a portly and prosper
ous man who sat in a yellow convertible studded with
precious gem stones. "Hello," said the portly and pros
perous man, "I am Portly Prosperous, president of
American Xerographic Data Processing and Birth Con
trol, Incorporated. Are you a senior?"
"Yes, sir," said E. Pluribus.
"Do you like this car?" said Portly.
"Yes, sir," said E. Pluribus.
"It's yours," said Portly.
"Thanks, hey," said E. Pluribus.
"Do you like Personna Super Stainless Steel Blades?"
said Portly.
"What clean living, clean shaven American does not?"
said E. Pluribus.
"Here is a pack," said Portly. "And a new pack will
be delivered to you every twelve minutes as long as you
live."
"Thanks, hey," said E. Pluribus.
"Would your wife like a mink coat?" said Portly.
"I feel sure she would," said E. Pluribus, "but I am
not married."
"Do you want to be ?" said Portly.
"What clean living, clean shaven American does not?"
said E. Pluribus.
Portly pressed a button on the dashboard of the con
vertible and the trunk opened up and out came a nubile
maiden with golden hair, rosy knees, a perfect disposi
tion, and the appendix already removed. "This is Svet
lana O'Toole," said Portly. "Would you like to marry her?"
"Is her appendix out?" said E. Pluribus.
"Yes," said Portly.
"Okay, hey," said E. Pluribus.
"Congratulations," said Portly. "And for the happy
bride, a set of .SOO monogrammed prawn forks."
"Thanks, hey," said Svetlana.

"Now then," said Portly to E. Pluribus, "let us get
down to business. My company will start you at $75,000
a year. You will retire at full salary upon reaching the
age of 2<i. We will give you an eleven-story house made of
lapis lazuli, each room to be stocked with edible furniture.
Your children will receive a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as they
shall live. We will keep your teeth in good repair and also
the teeth of your wife and children unto the third genera
tion. We will send your dentist a pack of Personna Super
Stainless Steel Blades every twelve minutes as long as
he shall live, and thereafter to his heirs and assigns...
Now, son, I want you to think carefully about this offer.
Meanwhile here is 50 thousand dollars in small, un
marked bills which places you under no obligation what
soever."
"Well, it certainly seems like a fair offer," said E.
Pluribus. "But there is something you should know. I am
not an engineer. In fact I don't go to M.I.T. at all. I just
walked over here to admire the trees. I am at Harvard,
