### 
Australian exchange student
Peter Boyce high-jumped 7-3 on
his second attempt Saturday to
highlight Stanford's 78-66 track
triumph over Fresno State.
Boyce, a junior from Mel
bourne, shattered his own school
mark of 7-Vi set two weeks ago,
and surpassed the Australian
National record of 7-2% done by
Tony Sneazwell in 1963.
The leap, best In the world
this season, moves Boyce up
to fifth place on the all-time
list of high Jumpers.

Fresno State's Erkki Mustakarl

from Finland, soared to a height
of 17V2 in the pole vault. Musta

eleventh man in history to top
the once unreachable 17-foot bar
rier.

10 l A for a new Fresno State
mark two weeks ago, broke the
Finnish National record of 16-
10% set last year by Risto Ivan
off.

FROM AUSTRALIA, WITH LOVE — Stanford's Australian exchange student Peter Boyce shows
the excellent form which propelled him to a sensational 7-3 high jump during Saturday afternoon's
track meet at Fresno State. Boyce, a junior from Melbourne .topped the RatclifTe Stadium record
of 7-2 Vi set last year by Ed Carruthers. The leap, best in the world this year, places Boyce in fifth place
on the all-time high-jump list.
Australian exchange student
Peter Boyce high-jumped 7-3 on
his second attempt Saturday to
highlight Stanford's 78-66 track
triumph over Fresno State.
Boyce, a junior from Mel
bourne, shattered his own school
mark of 7-Vi set two weeks ago,
and surpassed the Australian
National record of 7-2% done by
Tony Sneazwell in 1963.
The leap, best In the world
this season, moves Boyce up
to fifth place on the all-time
list of high Jumpers.
Another exchange student,
Fresno State's Erkki Mustakarl

from Finland, soared to a height
of 17V2 in the pole vault. Musta
kari, a sophomore, became the
eleventh man in history to top
the once unreachable 17-foot bar
rier.
Mustakari, who had gone 16-
10 l A for a new Fresno State
mark two weeks ago, broke the
Finnish National record of 16-

FROM AUSTRALIA, WITH LOVE — Stanford's Australian exchange student Peter Boyce shows
the excellent form which propelled him to a sensational 7-3 high jump during Saturday afternoon's
track meet at Fresno State. Boyce, a junior from Melbourne .topped the RatclifTe Stadium record

on the all-time high-jump list.
Australian exchange student

and surpassed the Australian
National record of 7-2% done by
Tony Sneazwell in 1963.
The leap, best In the world
this season, moves Boyce up
to fifth place on the all-time
list of high Jumpers.
