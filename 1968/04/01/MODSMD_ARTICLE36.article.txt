roles in bringing the Western
College All-Stars a 95-88 victory
over the East Saturday afternoon
at Indianapolis.
Pete Maravich, named the
game's outstanding player,
sparked the East to a 45-42 lead
at halftime, but Harris, Criteh
field, and Purdue's Rick Mount
sparked the West to a come
from-behind win.
Mount led the West charge,
burying 24 points before fouling
out with 3:20 left to play.
Harris funneled 10 points for
his day's work, including: two
key baskets during the West's
late comeback.

Critchfield's ballhandling and
field-generalship, in addition to
eight points, were instrumental
in turning the tide in the West's
favor.

held this coming week in Albu
querque, N.M. Other California
stars making a bid for a berth
on the Olympic squad include

and Mike Warren of the national
champion UCLA quintet an
nounced several weeks ago that
