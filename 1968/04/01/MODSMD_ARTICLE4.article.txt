# Campus Dissent Turns To Disbelief
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Suddenly the blue and white
McCarthy button seemed bigger.
The black and white draft card
seemed smaller.
It was the unconceivable that
was conceived, the unbelievable
that now has to be believed, the
impossible that happened.

It was the unless that never
came.
"I shall not soek and will not
accept the nomination of my
party for another term as your
President."
Unless ?
But this time the unless never
came.
Students who had hardly set
tled in for the new quarter
swarmed around television sets
only to see professional an
nouncers speechless. The stu
dents themselves were not ar
ticulate, but the message was
clear.
In the Serra lounge girls and
boys embraced in ecstatic disbe
lief. In front of Roble a girl
dropped her luggage, threw her
arms around the nearest boy,
and yelled, "It's wondrful. I'm
so . . and could say no more.
A dozen diners ate quietly in
the Grove dining room, old resi
dents meeting new, when a tutor
stormed into the room and an
nounced the news. Food was
dropped, milk left unfinished,
and old and new alike screamed
with delight.
Those who were happy, and
those few who were sad, had
one common trait—uncontrolla
ble excitement. It was not a
time for unpacking alone in a
room or listening to a record.
You had to talk. You had to
hear. You had to share.
Grove immediately declared a
party and groups rushed out to
get the ice cream and syrup.

Four words said it all. "I can't
believe it!"
But faculty members believed
it, and started looking for rea
sons.
Thomas Bailey, professor of
history and author of several
books on American politics, said,
"I think he bowed out because
he may have seen a licking com
ing up.
"There was a good chance he
would be unseated at the con
vention. That would be worse
than being beaten in the elec
tion.
"But this really isn't in char
acter for him. He's a fighter and
loves power—and now he's a
lame duck. That's why I suspect
ill health.
"I think Kennedy is almost
the inevitable nominee. I don't
think McCarthy has a prayer,
and I don't think Humphrey has
much of a chance."
Gabriel Almond, head of the
Political Science department,
said, "In addition to the do
mestic political implications,
this is a strong maneuver to
force the North Vietnamese to
the council table because their
whole line of attack over the
last three years has been
Johnson the imperialist and
Johnson's war. It leaves the
North Vietnamese without a
target."
Other professors commented
on the domestic repurcussions.
Marc Franklin, professor of law,
who is a key organizer for Ken

most from Johnsons decision.
"The GOP will confront a much
more unified party and the
whole need for urgency among
those who opposed Johnson has
vanished."
Lucio Ruotolo, strong McCar
thy supporter and organizer
was in high spirits. He said,
head is still in the clouds. It's so
marvelous I can't believe it. In
the long run it's going to be
good for McCarthy. There have
been very few defections from
faculty support for McCarthy.
Only two of 33 have moved to
Kennedy."
Robert McAfee Brown, long
time opponent of the war and
Johnson said, "This new set of
unexpected circumstances can
only be cause for a sense of
hope. The President's two deci
sions make clear that the voices
of protest against the adminis
tration policy have at last begun
to be heard.
"Our nation owes an impar
ailed debt of gratitude to Sen
ator McCarthy for initiating
the kind of political opposition
that culminated in Johnson's
decision not to seek reelec
tion."
TCennoth Prewitt, visiting as
sistant professor of political sci
ence, feels that major political
leaders, such as Mayor Daley of
Chicago, who have publically
supported the president, have
told him that if Kennedy
runs, they will have to go with

the Senator, because of the opin
ion polls and the groundswell of
opposition to Johnson's Vietnam
policy.
Therefore, without strong po
litical support, the President is,
in essence "quitting while he is
ahead."
He also noted that the latest
California poll has Kennedy
ahead of Johnson by four per
centage points, two months be
fore the primary. Prewitt feels
that this also may have influ
enced the President's decision.
Due to the changed circum
stances, supporters of Kennedy
who planned to take an ad in
Wednesday's Daily with 65 sig
natures have decided to cancel
their plans.
