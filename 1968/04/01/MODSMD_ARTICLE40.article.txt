Monday and Tuesday.
The Center will maintain in
formation on such things as:

which welcome Stanford volun
teers of varied talents and inter

local and national groups, such
as the Economic Opportunities
Council of San Francisco, 0.E.0.,
and VISTA, which welcome
Stanford volunteers;

act as volunteer services rep
resentative.
This person would act as the
main contact with the Center,
responsible for informing the
residents of his house of oppor
tunities available, helping to
plan programs and recruiting
activities, planning speakers and
activities for his house, and gen
erally doing what he can to
stimulate and develop interest
in volunteer service.
The information maintained
at the center will be as complete
or as short as the sponsoring

be willing to talk to potential
volunteers.
A Voluntary Services Center
has been established by the Dean
of Students office to supply in
formation to students interested
in participating in various vol
unteer service projects.
The Center, located on the
third floor of the Clubhouse, will
serve as a clearinghouse for or
ganizations trying to recruit
workers.
The Dean's office found that
In the past many students did
not know where to go to
find information on volunteer
groups, and that the organiza
tions themselves had difficul
ties in recruiting volunteers.
The Center will be open from
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through
Friday. It will be staffed full
time by Terry Ross, who grad
uated at the end of Winter Quar
ter, and who has been actively
involved in plans for the Center
throughout the year.
Assisting him will be Maxine
Kennedy, a junior, and Sherrie
Gillette, a graduate student, who
will work during the afternoons
planning special projects, re
cruiting visits, and developing
better means of communication
between the Center and students
about the opportunities avail
able.
A Peace Corps representative
will hold office hours in the Cen
ter from about 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Monday and Tuesday.
The Center will maintain in
formation on such things as:
• projects in local communities
which welcome Stanford volun
teers of varied talents and inter
ests;
• projects sponsored by larger
local and national groups, such
as the Economic Opportunities
Council of San Francisco, 0.E.0.,
and VISTA, which welcome
Stanford volunteers;

• short-term and summer pro
jects; and
• long-term projects, such as
the Peace Corps and VISTA.
As an initial step toward
better communication, the
Center will call a meeting dur
ing the second week of Spring
Quarter of all house presi
dents, or their representatives,
to discuss the i»ossibility of
identifying an Interested stu
dent in each house who would
act as volunteer services rep
resentative.
This person would act as the
main contact with the Center,
responsible for informing the
residents of his house of oppor
tunities available, helping to
plan programs and recruiting
activities, planning speakers and
activities for his house, and gen
erally doing what he can to
stimulate and develop interest
in volunteer service.
The information maintained
at the center will be as complete
or as short as the sponsoring
groups wish it to be.
The Center is not meant to be
a controlling body in any way,
but is meant to be complemen
tary to efforts already being
made and initiative in identify
ing new projects and bringing
them to the attention of mem
bers of the Stanford Community.
