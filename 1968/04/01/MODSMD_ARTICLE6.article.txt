# Stanford Police Arrest Two For Marijuana
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Two Stanford students will appear in court
tomorrow to face charges of marijuana pos
session. They were arrested March 15 in what
is believed to be the first pot bust ever by Stan
ford police on campus.
The arrests came two weeks after President
Wallace Sterling issue a statement that "the
University explicitly refuses to act as a sanc
tuary from enforcement of the drug laws."
But police and University officials say the
marijuana arrests represent no change in
policy.
Assistant Police Chief Thomas Bell said
"Our policy is no different than it's ever been"
on drugs. As University employees, Bell ex
plained, the police have always reported sus
pected felonies to the Santa Clara County
sheriff.
Possession of marijuana is a felony under
state and federal law.
Both Bell and Dean of Students Joel Smith
denied that the arrests signaled the start of
a crackdown on marijuana use. "The Univer
sity police have not been encouraged to make
a special project of discovering violations of
the drug laws," Smith said.
The two 21-year-old suspects, David Mena
sian, a senior from Canton Center, Conn., and
Eric Miller, a junior from Cleveland Heights,
Ohio, will appear in Palo Alto municipal court
at 2 p.m. tomorrow for a preliminary hearing.
Their lawyer, William Keogh, entered a not
guilty plea at their arraingment March 22.
Assistant Chief Bell said the arrests were
the first ever by Stanford police on marijuana
charges because it was allegedly "the first
time it's been thrown in our face. We don't

nose around trying to find this sort of stuff."
Stanford police released these details of
the unusual arrests:
While making his rounds at 4:30 a.m. March
15, Officer George Bruschi saw Menasian and
Miller through a window sitting in the lounge
of Breakers Eating Club, where both are mem
bers. Bruschi, a former member of the Santa
Clara Sheriff's Reserve and a Stanford police
man since December, says he saw Menasian
pass a tin foil pipe to Miller.
Bruschi entered Breakers and Miller al
legedly dropped the pipe to the floor.

Police say the pipe was warm and contain
ed marijuana ashes. Bruschi reported that he
found bags containing marijuana on the floor
near Menasian and Miller.
The students were searched and taken to
Stanford police headquarters. Assistant Chief
Bell was telephoned at his home and told of
the arrest. Then the Stanford police, who tech
nically have no greater power of arrest than
ordinary citizens, called the County Sheriff's
department. Menasian and Miller were booked
by Sheriff's deputies at North County jail in
Palo Alto.

The arrests set several precedents. Never
before had students been arrested on the Stan
ford campus for drug possession, as far as
Bell knows. It was also the first time Stanford
police had reported a drug incident involving
students to the civil authorities without first
consulting the Dean of Students' office.
Under California law, marijuana possession
is punishable by up to ten years in prison.
Recent convictions in Santa Clara County have
brought heavy fines and several years' proba
tion, according to a lawyer experienced in drug
cases. But one judge recently gave a six
months jail sentence for marijuana possession.
As of last spring, one out of every five Stan
ford undergraduates had used marijuana, ac
cording to a survey released last month by
Richard Blum of Stanford's Institute for the
Study of Human Problems.
Dean Smith said last week there is no spe
cial University policy on arrests involving
marijuana and other drugs. Stanford police
have always been free to turn students over
to civil authorities for law violations, Smith
said.
Although Stanford Police "do not have a
special mission" to enforce drug laws, Smith
explained, the University "is not a sanctuary
from the law."
Assistant Chief Bell said Menasian and
Miller were turned over to the County Sheriff
because they were suspected of commiting
a felony, and not just a routine misdomenor.
Police policy is based on the distinction be
tween felonies and misdemeanors, 801 l explain
ed. Stanford has a "moral" and "practical" ob
ligation to report any felony to civil authori

tics, he said, but misdemeanors are only re
ported to the Dean of Students, unless they in
volve non-students or a law suit.
Possession of methedrine (speed) and the
hallucinatory drug LSD are misdemeanors.
But Stanford police did report to County au
thorities the use of methedrine earlier this
year by a Wilbur resident after he was taken
to Cowell Health Center for emergency treat
ment. It is not known whether the County
district attorney took action.
Bell denied that Stanford police are investi
gating campus drug use. "I have no doubt in
my mind that there's undercover work going
on in this campus right now," he said, "but
I wouldn't know about it." The County Sheriff
can take action on campus at any time, Bell
pointed out.
The more blatant drug use is, the more
likely Stanford police are to make arrests,
Bell indicated.
"If we see smoke coming out of a third
story window and it obviously isn't a fire,
we won't necessarily take action," said Bell.
"But if some student comes up and tells us,
'Hey, there's guys smoking marijuana up
there,' what are we supposed to do?"
Complaints from parents of teenagers who
were given drugs at campus parties could
force the police to investigate, Bell said.
But Stanford police won't search a dormi
tory room or fraternity without permission,
Bell said.
Bell and Smith both criticized the State and
federal penalties for marijuana possession as
too severe. "There are a lot of laws I dis
agree with," Bell said, "but as long as those
laws are on the books we should obey them."

from the law."
Assistant Chief Bell said Menasian and
Miller were turned over to the County Sheriff
because they were suspected of commiting
a felony, and not just a routine misdomenor.
Police policy is based on the distinction be
tween felonies and misdemeanors, 801 l explain
ed. Stanford has a "moral" and "practical" ob
ligation to report any felony to civil authori

tics, he said, but misdemeanors are only re
ported to the Dean of Students, unless they in
volve non-students or a law suit.
Possession of methedrine (speed) and the
hallucinatory drug LSD are misdemeanors.
But Stanford police did report to County au
thorities the use of methedrine earlier this
year by a Wilbur resident after he was taken
to Cowell Health Center for emergency treat
ment. It is not known whether the County
district attorney took action.
Bell denied that Stanford police are investi
gating campus drug use. "I have no doubt in
my mind that there's undercover work going
on in this campus right now," he said, "but
I wouldn't know about it." The County Sheriff
can take action on campus at any time, Bell
pointed out.
The more blatant drug use is, the more
likely Stanford police are to make arrests,
Bell indicated.
"If we see smoke coming out of a third
story window and it obviously isn't a fire,
we won't necessarily take action," said Bell.
"But if some student comes up and tells us,
'Hey, there's guys smoking marijuana up
there,' what are we supposed to do?"
Complaints from parents of teenagers who
were given drugs at campus parties could
force the police to investigate, Bell said.
But Stanford police won't search a dormi
tory room or fraternity without permission,
Bell said.
Bell and Smith both criticized the State and
federal penalties for marijuana possession as
too severe. "There are a lot of laws I dis
agree with," Bell said, "but as long as those
laws are on the books we should obey them."
Two Stanford students will appear in court
tomorrow to face charges of marijuana pos
session. They were arrested March 15 in what
is believed to be the first pot bust ever by Stan
ford police on campus.
The arrests came two weeks after President
Wallace Sterling issue a statement that "the
University explicitly refuses to act as a sanc
tuary from enforcement of the drug laws."
But police and University officials say the
marijuana arrests represent no change in
policy.
Assistant Police Chief Thomas Bell said
"Our policy is no different than it's ever been"
on drugs. As University employees, Bell ex
plained, the police have always reported sus
pected felonies to the Santa Clara County
sheriff.
Possession of marijuana is a felony under
state and federal law.
Both Bell and Dean of Students Joel Smith
denied that the arrests signaled the start of
a crackdown on marijuana use. "The Univer
sity police have not been encouraged to make
a special project of discovering violations of
the drug laws," Smith said.
The two 21-year-old suspects, David Mena
sian, a senior from Canton Center, Conn., and
Eric Miller, a junior from Cleveland Heights,
Ohio, will appear in Palo Alto municipal court
at 2 p.m. tomorrow for a preliminary hearing.
Their lawyer, William Keogh, entered a not
guilty plea at their arraingment March 22.
Assistant Chief Bell said the arrests were
the first ever by Stanford police on marijuana
charges because it was allegedly "the first
time it's been thrown in our face. We don't

nose around trying to find this sort of stuff."
Stanford police released these details of
the unusual arrests:
While making his rounds at 4:30 a.m. March
15, Officer George Bruschi saw Menasian and
Miller through a window sitting in the lounge
of Breakers Eating Club, where both are mem
bers. Bruschi, a former member of the Santa
Clara Sheriff's Reserve and a Stanford police
man since December, says he saw Menasian
pass a tin foil pipe to Miller.
Bruschi entered Breakers and Miller al
legedly dropped the pipe to the floor.

Police say the pipe was warm and contain
ed marijuana ashes. Bruschi reported that he
found bags containing marijuana on the floor
near Menasian and Miller.
The students were searched and taken to
Stanford police headquarters. Assistant Chief
Bell was telephoned at his home and told of
the arrest. Then the Stanford police, who tech
nically have no greater power of arrest than
ordinary citizens, called the County Sheriff's
department. Menasian and Miller were booked
by Sheriff's deputies at North County jail in
Palo Alto.

The arrests set several precedents. Never
before had students been arrested on the Stan
ford campus for drug possession, as far as
Bell knows. It was also the first time Stanford
police had reported a drug incident involving
students to the civil authorities without first
consulting the Dean of Students' office.
Under California law, marijuana possession
is punishable by up to ten years in prison.
Recent convictions in Santa Clara County have
brought heavy fines and several years' proba
tion, according to a lawyer experienced in drug
cases. But one judge recently gave a six
months jail sentence for marijuana possession.
As of last spring, one out of every five Stan
ford undergraduates had used marijuana, ac
cording to a survey released last month by
Richard Blum of Stanford's Institute for the
Study of Human Problems.
Dean Smith said last week there is no spe
cial University policy on arrests involving
marijuana and other drugs. Stanford police
have always been free to turn students over
to civil authorities for law violations, Smith
said.

While making his rounds at 4:30 a.m. March
15, Officer George Bruschi saw Menasian and
Miller through a window sitting in the lounge
of Breakers Eating Club, where both are mem
bers. Bruschi, a former member of the Santa
Clara Sheriff's Reserve and a Stanford police
man since December, says he saw Menasian
pass a tin foil pipe to Miller.
Bruschi entered Breakers and Miller al
legedly dropped the pipe to the floor.

Police say the pipe was warm and contain
ed marijuana ashes. Bruschi reported that he
found bags containing marijuana on the floor
near Menasian and Miller.
The students were searched and taken to
Stanford police headquarters. Assistant Chief
Bell was telephoned at his home and told of
the arrest. Then the Stanford police, who tech
nically have no greater power of arrest than
ordinary citizens, called the County Sheriff's
department. Menasian and Miller were booked
by Sheriff's deputies at North County jail in
Palo Alto.

The arrests set several precedents. Never
before had students been arrested on the Stan
ford campus for drug possession, as far as
Bell knows. It was also the first time Stanford
police had reported a drug incident involving
students to the civil authorities without first
consulting the Dean of Students' office.
Under California law, marijuana possession
is punishable by up to ten years in prison.
Recent convictions in Santa Clara County have
brought heavy fines and several years' proba
tion, according to a lawyer experienced in drug
cases. But one judge recently gave a six
months jail sentence for marijuana possession.
As of last spring, one out of every five Stan
ford undergraduates had used marijuana, ac
cording to a survey released last month by
Richard Blum of Stanford's Institute for the
Study of Human Problems.
Dean Smith said last week there is no spe
cial University policy on arrests involving
marijuana and other drugs. Stanford police
have always been free to turn students over
to civil authorities for law violations, Smith
said.
Although Stanford Police "do not have a
special mission" to enforce drug laws, Smith
explained, the University "is not a sanctuary
from the law."
Assistant Chief Bell said Menasian and
Miller were turned over to the County Sheriff
because they were suspected of commiting
a felony, and not just a routine misdomenor.
Police policy is based on the distinction be
tween felonies and misdemeanors, 801 l explain
ed. Stanford has a "moral" and "practical" ob
ligation to report any felony to civil authori

tics, he said, but misdemeanors are only re
ported to the Dean of Students, unless they in
volve non-students or a law suit.
Possession of methedrine (speed) and the
hallucinatory drug LSD are misdemeanors.
But Stanford police did report to County au
thorities the use of methedrine earlier this
year by a Wilbur resident after he was taken
to Cowell Health Center for emergency treat
ment. It is not known whether the County
district attorney took action.
Bell denied that Stanford police are investi
gating campus drug use. "I have no doubt in
my mind that there's undercover work going
on in this campus right now," he said, "but
I wouldn't know about it." The County Sheriff
can take action on campus at any time, Bell
pointed out.
The more blatant drug use is, the more
likely Stanford police are to make arrests,
Bell indicated.
"If we see smoke coming out of a third
story window and it obviously isn't a fire,
we won't necessarily take action," said Bell.
"But if some student comes up and tells us,
'Hey, there's guys smoking marijuana up
there,' what are we supposed to do?"
Complaints from parents of teenagers who
were given drugs at campus parties could
force the police to investigate, Bell said.
But Stanford police won't search a dormi
tory room or fraternity without permission,
Bell said.
Bell and Smith both criticized the State and
federal penalties for marijuana possession as
too severe. "There are a lot of laws I dis
agree with," Bell said, "but as long as those
laws are on the books we should obey them."
Two Stanford students will appear in court
tomorrow to face charges of marijuana pos
session. They were arrested March 15 in what
is believed to be the first pot bust ever by Stan
ford police on campus.
The arrests came two weeks after President
Wallace Sterling issue a statement that "the
University explicitly refuses to act as a sanc
tuary from enforcement of the drug laws."
But police and University officials say the
marijuana arrests represent no change in
policy.
Assistant Police Chief Thomas Bell said
"Our policy is no different than it's ever been"
on drugs. As University employees, Bell ex
plained, the police have always reported sus
pected felonies to the Santa Clara County
sheriff.
Possession of marijuana is a felony under
state and federal law.
Both Bell and Dean of Students Joel Smith
denied that the arrests signaled the start of
a crackdown on marijuana use. "The Univer
sity police have not been encouraged to make
a special project of discovering violations of
the drug laws," Smith said.
The two 21-year-old suspects, David Mena
sian, a senior from Canton Center, Conn., and
Eric Miller, a junior from Cleveland Heights,
Ohio, will appear in Palo Alto municipal court
at 2 p.m. tomorrow for a preliminary hearing.
Their lawyer, William Keogh, entered a not
guilty plea at their arraingment March 22.
Assistant Chief Bell said the arrests were
the first ever by Stanford police on marijuana
charges because it was allegedly "the first
time it's been thrown in our face. We don't

nose around trying to find this sort of stuff."
