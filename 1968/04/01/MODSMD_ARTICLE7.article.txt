# Breakers Angry At Arrests
## 
### 
For years tired Stanford cops on the beat
have stopped at Breakers Eating Club for a
free cup of coffee, and exchanged a few
pleasantries with the students. But the cops
haven't been seen around Breakers lately.
The friendly tradition dissolved March 15
when a Stanford officer arrested two Breakers
members in the club's lounge in the early
morning hours. They now face marijuana
possession charges.
"The members aren't too happy with it,"
Breakers manager Larry Levin said five days
after the bust. "If any cops came in for coffee
now, they'd meet with a gTeat deal of ani
mosity."
Allan Christelow summed up Breakers'

feelings: "I don't believe Stanford cops should
be harrassing people."
Breakers has a reputation as a sort of
Haight-Ashbury-at-Stanford. The club tradi
tion is covering the walls with chalk-written
graffiti. Soon after the arrests these witticisms
appeared:
On the front door, "No Pot No Cops."
. . "SPI) (Stanford Police Department) get out
of Breakersâ€”or at least turn on before you
come around."
"Narks and other forms of life, No free
coffee."
"Support your local police."
But after finals week, the graffiti were
mysteriously erased. Only "Support your local
police" remained.
