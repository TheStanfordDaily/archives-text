# The
						Pot Bust

### 
Typically, Stanford administrators never sat down and worked
out an exact policy for their private police force to follow should
they discover marijuana use by students. So the policy just hap
pened. One cop on the beat surprised everyone—including the
Dean of Students—by arresting two students and turning them
over to the County Sheriff.
We could have another indulgent laugh at the foibles of a
leaderless administration if the consequences of the March 15
bust weren't so serious. The students are charged with commit
ting a felony. If convicted, they would receive fines, long proba
tion or possibly jail sentences. They would lose their civil rights.
They would be required to register as "narcotics offenders" if
they moved to another county. They would be labeled "convicted
felons" by society.
For blowing grass. A harmless activity engaged in by hundreds
of Stanford students and faculty each week.
These arrests are tragic. The University cannot be an accom
plice to society's barbaric treatment of drug users. Nor is the
University compelled to enforce civil penalties against drugs, any
more than it is compelled to report Robert MacAfee Brown to the
FBI for advocating resistance to the draft (also a felony).
Stanford police are private employees of the University. They
are not "peace officers." They should be told in no uncertain
terms that drug cases—whether they involve marijuana, LSD or
alcohol—should be reported to the Dean of Students, not the
County Sheriff. Northwestern University announced such a policy
last week.
If the Dean thinks a student's "drug abuse" hurts the academic
effectiveness of Stanford University, he should expell the offend
er. If the Dean discovers a pusher of some clearly dangerous
drug, like heroin, he should call in outside police.
Would this policy make Stanford a "sanctuary" from drug laws?
Certainly not. Federal, state and county police can raid the cam
pus any time they please. Stanford now condones widespread
drug use every day, despite these two freak arrests. Our police
should not try to fend off narcotics agents by acting like them.
If the sheriff decides to scourge Demon Marijuana from the
campus, let him try. At least he'll be the enemy, and not Stanford
police.
The University's police should not be hampered by the hostility
of the student body. As a security force for a sprawling campus,
their job is protecting life and property. How can they keep the
peace amid a hostile and suspicious community? Marijuana vigi
lantes at Stanford will be as popular as white cops in a black
ghetto.
