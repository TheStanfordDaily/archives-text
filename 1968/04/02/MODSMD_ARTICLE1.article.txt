# 33 Stanford Students Will Study Demonstrations
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Thirty-three Stanford students
are intensively preparing to do
15 units of field research on
Martin Luther King's "Poor
People's Campaign" in Wash
ington, D.C. beginning April 22.
But the program's sponsors,
who struggled for weeks to get
University approval of the un
precedented study, are troubled
by King's repeated postpone
ments of the start of the mas
sive demonstrations. The bloody
Memphis riot last week caused
widespread fears that the Wash
ington demonstrations would
lead to violence.
Undaunted, the Stanford
group is meeting daily for sem
inars on sociological research
methods, mass movements, pov
erty and civil rights. Professors
Paul Wallin, Kenneth Prewitt,
Alan Beals, John Meyer and
William Rivers are teaching the
classes, with the help of grad
uate students Mary Montle, De
lores Mack, Gordon Black and
Richard Young.
Before leaving for Washing
ton, each of the 33 undergrad
uates will plan a research pro
ject on the poor people's march,
which is intended to pressure
Congress into giving "jobs and
income" to the poor.
At least four other univers
ities, including Berkeley, Michi
gan, Michigan State and Anti

och, are sending groups of stu
dents to study King's campaign.
Five UCLA students will ac
company the Stanford conting
ent.
The students will pay regular
tuition and $125 for room and
board in the tent quarters in
Washington.
Political Science Prof. Charles
A. Drekmeier, chairman of the
faculty committee supervising
the Washington study, calls the
students "participant-observers."
But he adds, "they will not be
demonstrators."
King hopes to beseige Wash
ington with thousands of well
oragnized poor people. Massive
sit-ins are envisioned in what
Drekmeier believes will be "per
haps the last chance to prove
that nonviolent pressure tactics
can be effective."
King's organization, the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, has invited univers
ities to send observers.
The Stanford students, one
third of whom are Negroes, plan
to arrive in Washington around
April 19 with tutors Mary Mon
tle and Delores Mack. While in
the capital they will meet for
seminars twice a week with Mrs.
Jesse Bernard, a retired sociol
ogy professor formerly at Penn
sylvania State University, and
Elliot Liebow of the National
Institute of Mental Health.

King and his aides will pre
sent Congress a list of demands
April 22. About a week later, the
first of 3,000 demonstrators tre
supposed to begin moving into
tent encampments scattered
around Washington. The stu
dent observers will move into
the tents with them.
More demonstrators will
stream in from around the
country, King says, rallying in
a massive June 15 protest rival
ing the 1963 civil rights march
on Washington.
After the Memphis riot Thurs
day, several U.S. Senators de
manded the government sup
press King's Washington cam
paign. "If this self-seeking rab
ble-rouser is allowed to go
through with his plans here,"
said Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-
W.Va.), "Washington may well
be treated to the same kind of
violence, destruction, looting
and bloodshed."
Berkeley's Washington study
was attacked by Congressman
James B. Utt, a Republican from
Orange County, as a "waste of
the taxpayers' money in the
name of research."
Utt warned Berkeley vice
chancellor Neil J. Smelser that
the students would be "brain
washed' 'by the leaders of King's
campaign.
Smelser defended the aca
demic credentials of the pro

gram and pointed out that Stan
ford University had approved a
similar field study.
King condemned the Memphis
violence and said he would go
ahead with plans for the Poor
People's Campaign. Then on
Sunday he hinted he was will
ing to "negotiate" with Presi
dent Johnson to call off the cam
paign in return for "a commit
ment with a positive timetable
to do something this summer"
to aid the nation's slums.
Originally King had sched
uled his march to start in early
April, but he has postponed it
twice. Now large numbers of
demonstrators may not reach
Washington until sometime in
May.
This would make it hard for
Stanford students to finish their
research projects before the end
of spring quarter. Drekmeier
said he and several dozen pro
fessors who will grade the indi
vidual research papers wil] try
to evaluate the students' pro
jects in time to avoid giving in
completes for the 15 units. But
some students will want to stay
in Washington for the duration
of the campaign, Drekmeier be
lieves.
Several students already have
planned their studies. A group
of eight will explore how the
attitudes of the Washington
population are changed by the

demonstrations. Others will ex
amine the press coverage of the
campaign. One girl plans to
study the students themselves,
partucilarly how they get along
with poor people of a different
race and social class.
Stanford's program was
sparked by an identical proposal
at Berkeley, which has been ap
proved under the title, "Social
Analysis 133-X, The Politics of
Race Relations." Two Stanford
juniors, Michael Bruwer and
Jim Hartnett, interested Drek
meier and other professors in
the idea in late February.
With winter quarter coming
to a close, Drekmeier took on
the formidable task of getting
approval from the University
administration. It wasn't easy.
Drekmeier had to reassure the
administration that students
wouldn't be caught in a riot. In
case the King campaign fizzled,
alternative study projects had
to be planned. Several social
science departments had to be
persuaded to give academic
credit in "directed reading" for
the students involved.
But lack of funds almost
killed the project. $6,400 was
needed to pay Bernard's and
Liebow's salaries and cover var
ious expenses. Drekmeier was
told "higher priorities" pre
vented the University from pro
viding the funds, and an out

side foundation also turned him
down.
On March 21, just 15 minutes
before Drekmeier promised a
worried group of student appli
cants that he'd tell them wheth
er the Washington study was
still alive, Robert Sears, dean of
humanities and sciences, called
to say he had secured he $6,400
from a variety of University
sources.

The 33 students were chosen
by five professors from among
54 applicants. At their first
meeting March 27 at Drek
meier's home, tutor Mary Mon
tie told them, "If this program
fails, it means other programs
in the future will fail to get
approval."
Drekmeier told the students,

"We expect an almost full-time
commitment."
The students will be ordered
back to Stanford if a crisis de
velops during the campaign, or
their "presence becomes an em
barrassment to Dr. King."
But Drekmeier, having over
come so many obstacles to the
program, isn't likely to get cold
feet. "This University has got
to grow up," he commented.
"This is an unprecedented op
portunity for our students to re

widespread fears that the Wash
ington demonstrations would
lead to violence.
Undaunted, the Stanford
group is meeting daily for sem
inars on sociological research
methods, mass movements, pov
erty and civil rights. Professors
Paul Wallin, Kenneth Prewitt,
Alan Beals, John Meyer and
William Rivers are teaching the
classes, with the help of grad
uate students Mary Montle, De
lores Mack, Gordon Black and
Richard Young.
Before leaving for Washing
ton, each of the 33 undergrad
uates will plan a research pro
ject on the poor people's march,
which is intended to pressure
Congress into giving "jobs and
income" to the poor.
At least four other univers
ities, including Berkeley, Michi
gan, Michigan State and Anti

och, are sending groups of stu
dents to study King's campaign.
Five UCLA students will ac
company the Stanford conting
ent.
The students will pay regular
tuition and $125 for room and
board in the tent quarters in
Washington.
Political Science Prof. Charles
A. Drekmeier, chairman of the
faculty committee supervising
the Washington study, calls the
students "participant-observers."
But he adds, "they will not be
demonstrators."
King hopes to beseige Wash
ington with thousands of well
oragnized poor people. Massive
sit-ins are envisioned in what
Drekmeier believes will be "per
haps the last chance to prove
that nonviolent pressure tactics
can be effective."
King's organization, the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, has invited univers
ities to send observers.
The Stanford students, one
third of whom are Negroes, plan
to arrive in Washington around
April 19 with tutors Mary Mon
tle and Delores Mack. While in
the capital they will meet for
seminars twice a week with Mrs.
Jesse Bernard, a retired sociol
ogy professor formerly at Penn
sylvania State University, and
Elliot Liebow of the National
Institute of Mental Health.

King and his aides will pre
sent Congress a list of demands
April 22. About a week later, the
first of 3,000 demonstrators tre
supposed to begin moving into
tent encampments scattered
around Washington. The stu
dent observers will move into
the tents with them.
More demonstrators will
stream in from around the
country, King says, rallying in
a massive June 15 protest rival
ing the 1963 civil rights march
on Washington.
After the Memphis riot Thurs
day, several U.S. Senators de
manded the government sup
press King's Washington cam
paign. "If this self-seeking rab
ble-rouser is allowed to go
through with his plans here,"
said Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-
W.Va.), "Washington may well
be treated to the same kind of
violence, destruction, looting
and bloodshed."
Berkeley's Washington study
was attacked by Congressman
James B. Utt, a Republican from
Orange County, as a "waste of
the taxpayers' money in the
name of research."
Utt warned Berkeley vice
chancellor Neil J. Smelser that
the students would be "brain
washed' 'by the leaders of King's
campaign.
Smelser defended the aca
demic credentials of the pro

gram and pointed out that Stan
ford University had approved a
similar field study.
King condemned the Memphis
violence and said he would go
ahead with plans for the Poor
People's Campaign. Then on
Sunday he hinted he was will
ing to "negotiate" with Presi
dent Johnson to call off the cam
paign in return for "a commit
ment with a positive timetable
to do something this summer"
to aid the nation's slums.
Originally King had sched
uled his march to start in early
April, but he has postponed it
twice. Now large numbers of
demonstrators may not reach
Washington until sometime in
May.
This would make it hard for
Stanford students to finish their
research projects before the end
of spring quarter. Drekmeier
said he and several dozen pro
fessors who will grade the indi
vidual research papers wil] try
to evaluate the students' pro
jects in time to avoid giving in
completes for the 15 units. But
some students will want to stay
in Washington for the duration
of the campaign, Drekmeier be
lieves.
Several students already have
planned their studies. A group
of eight will explore how the
attitudes of the Washington
population are changed by the

demonstrations. Others will ex
amine the press coverage of the
campaign. One girl plans to
study the students themselves,
partucilarly how they get along
with poor people of a different
race and social class.
Stanford's program was
sparked by an identical proposal
at Berkeley, which has been ap
proved under the title, "Social
Analysis 133-X, The Politics of
Race Relations." Two Stanford
juniors, Michael Bruwer and
Jim Hartnett, interested Drek
meier and other professors in
the idea in late February.
With winter quarter coming
to a close, Drekmeier took on
the formidable task of getting
approval from the University
administration. It wasn't easy.
Drekmeier had to reassure the
administration that students
wouldn't be caught in a riot. In
case the King campaign fizzled,
alternative study projects had
to be planned. Several social
science departments had to be
persuaded to give academic
credit in "directed reading" for
the students involved.
But lack of funds almost
killed the project. $6,400 was
needed to pay Bernard's and
Liebow's salaries and cover var
ious expenses. Drekmeier was
told "higher priorities" pre
vented the University from pro
viding the funds, and an out

side foundation also turned him
down.
On March 21, just 15 minutes
before Drekmeier promised a
worried group of student appli
cants that he'd tell them wheth
er the Washington study was
still alive, Robert Sears, dean of
humanities and sciences, called
to say he had secured he $6,400
from a variety of University
sources.

The 33 students were chosen
by five professors from among
54 applicants. At their first
meeting March 27 at Drek
meier's home, tutor Mary Mon
tie told them, "If this program
fails, it means other programs
in the future will fail to get
approval."
Drekmeier told the students,

ton, each of the 33 undergrad
uates will plan a research pro

which is intended to pressure
Congress into giving "jobs and

At least four other univers
ities, including Berkeley, Michi
gan, Michigan State and Anti

dents to study King's campaign.
Five UCLA students will ac
company the Stanford conting
ent.
The students will pay regular
tuition and $125 for room and
board in the tent quarters in
Washington.
Political Science Prof. Charles
A. Drekmeier, chairman of the
faculty committee supervising
the Washington study, calls the
students "participant-observers."
But he adds, "they will not be
demonstrators."
King hopes to beseige Wash
ington with thousands of well
oragnized poor people. Massive
sit-ins are envisioned in what
Drekmeier believes will be "per
haps the last chance to prove
that nonviolent pressure tactics
can be effective."
King's organization, the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, has invited univers
ities to send observers.
The Stanford students, one
third of whom are Negroes, plan
to arrive in Washington around
April 19 with tutors Mary Mon
tle and Delores Mack. While in
the capital they will meet for
seminars twice a week with Mrs.
Jesse Bernard, a retired sociol
ogy professor formerly at Penn
sylvania State University, and
Elliot Liebow of the National
Institute of Mental Health.

King and his aides will pre
sent Congress a list of demands
April 22. About a week later, the
first of 3,000 demonstrators tre
supposed to begin moving into
tent encampments scattered
around Washington. The stu
dent observers will move into
the tents with them.
More demonstrators will
stream in from around the
country, King says, rallying in
a massive June 15 protest rival
ing the 1963 civil rights march
on Washington.
After the Memphis riot Thurs
day, several U.S. Senators de
manded the government sup
press King's Washington cam
paign. "If this self-seeking rab
ble-rouser is allowed to go
through with his plans here,"
said Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-
W.Va.), "Washington may well
be treated to the same kind of
violence, destruction, looting
and bloodshed."
Berkeley's Washington study
was attacked by Congressman
James B. Utt, a Republican from
Orange County, as a "waste of
the taxpayers' money in the
name of research."
Utt warned Berkeley vice
chancellor Neil J. Smelser that
the students would be "brain
washed' 'by the leaders of King's
campaign.
Smelser defended the aca
demic credentials of the pro

gram and pointed out that Stan
ford University had approved a
similar field study.
King condemned the Memphis
violence and said he would go
ahead with plans for the Poor
People's Campaign. Then on
Sunday he hinted he was will
ing to "negotiate" with Presi
dent Johnson to call off the cam
paign in return for "a commit
ment with a positive timetable
to do something this summer"
to aid the nation's slums.
Originally King had sched
uled his march to start in early
April, but he has postponed it
twice. Now large numbers of
demonstrators may not reach
Washington until sometime in
May.
This would make it hard for
Stanford students to finish their
research projects before the end
of spring quarter. Drekmeier
said he and several dozen pro
fessors who will grade the indi
vidual research papers wil] try
to evaluate the students' pro
jects in time to avoid giving in
completes for the 15 units. But
some students will want to stay
in Washington for the duration
of the campaign, Drekmeier be
lieves.
Several students already have
planned their studies. A group
of eight will explore how the
attitudes of the Washington
population are changed by the

demonstrations. Others will ex
amine the press coverage of the
campaign. One girl plans to
study the students themselves,
partucilarly how they get along
with poor people of a different
race and social class.
Stanford's program was
sparked by an identical proposal
at Berkeley, which has been ap
proved under the title, "Social
Analysis 133-X, The Politics of
Race Relations." Two Stanford
juniors, Michael Bruwer and
Jim Hartnett, interested Drek
meier and other professors in
the idea in late February.
With winter quarter coming
to a close, Drekmeier took on
the formidable task of getting
approval from the University
administration. It wasn't easy.
Drekmeier had to reassure the
administration that students
wouldn't be caught in a riot. In
case the King campaign fizzled,
alternative study projects had
to be planned. Several social
science departments had to be
persuaded to give academic
credit in "directed reading" for
the students involved.
But lack of funds almost
killed the project. $6,400 was
needed to pay Bernard's and
Liebow's salaries and cover var
ious expenses. Drekmeier was
told "higher priorities" pre
vented the University from pro
viding the funds, and an out

side foundation also turned him
down.
On March 21, just 15 minutes
before Drekmeier promised a
worried group of student appli
cants that he'd tell them wheth
er the Washington study was
still alive, Robert Sears, dean of
humanities and sciences, called
to say he had secured he $6,400
from a variety of University
sources.

The 33 students were chosen
by five professors from among
54 applicants. At their first
meeting March 27 at Drek
meier's home, tutor Mary Mon
tie told them, "If this program
fails, it means other programs
in the future will fail to get
approval."
Drekmeier told the students,

board in the tent quarters in
Washington.
Political Science Prof. Charles
A. Drekmeier, chairman of the
faculty committee supervising
the Washington study, calls the
students "participant-observers."
But he adds, "they will not be
demonstrators."
King hopes to beseige Wash
ington with thousands of well
oragnized poor people. Massive
sit-ins are envisioned in what
Drekmeier believes will be "per
haps the last chance to prove
that nonviolent pressure tactics
can be effective."
King's organization, the
Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, has invited univers
ities to send observers.
The Stanford students, one
third of whom are Negroes, plan
to arrive in Washington around
April 19 with tutors Mary Mon
tle and Delores Mack. While in
the capital they will meet for
seminars twice a week with Mrs.
Jesse Bernard, a retired sociol
ogy professor formerly at Penn
sylvania State University, and
Elliot Liebow of the National
Institute of Mental Health.

King and his aides will pre
sent Congress a list of demands
April 22. About a week later, the
first of 3,000 demonstrators tre
supposed to begin moving into
tent encampments scattered
around Washington. The stu
dent observers will move into
the tents with them.
More demonstrators will
stream in from around the
country, King says, rallying in
a massive June 15 protest rival
ing the 1963 civil rights march
on Washington.
After the Memphis riot Thurs
day, several U.S. Senators de
manded the government sup
press King's Washington cam
paign. "If this self-seeking rab
ble-rouser is allowed to go
through with his plans here,"
said Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-
W.Va.), "Washington may well
be treated to the same kind of
violence, destruction, looting
and bloodshed."
Berkeley's Washington study
was attacked by Congressman
James B. Utt, a Republican from
Orange County, as a "waste of
the taxpayers' money in the
name of research."
Utt warned Berkeley vice
chancellor Neil J. Smelser that
the students would be "brain
washed' 'by the leaders of King's
campaign.
Smelser defended the aca
demic credentials of the pro

gram and pointed out that Stan
ford University had approved a
similar field study.
King condemned the Memphis
violence and said he would go
ahead with plans for the Poor
People's Campaign. Then on
Sunday he hinted he was will
ing to "negotiate" with Presi
dent Johnson to call off the cam
paign in return for "a commit
ment with a positive timetable
to do something this summer"
to aid the nation's slums.
Originally King had sched
uled his march to start in early
April, but he has postponed it
twice. Now large numbers of
demonstrators may not reach
Washington until sometime in
May.
This would make it hard for
Stanford students to finish their
research projects before the end
of spring quarter. Drekmeier
said he and several dozen pro
fessors who will grade the indi
vidual research papers wil] try
to evaluate the students' pro
jects in time to avoid giving in
completes for the 15 units. But
some students will want to stay
in Washington for the duration
of the campaign, Drekmeier be
lieves.
Several students already have
planned their studies. A group
of eight will explore how the
attitudes of the Washington
population are changed by the

demonstrations. Others will ex
amine the press coverage of the
campaign. One girl plans to
study the students themselves,
partucilarly how they get along
with poor people of a different
race and social class.
Stanford's program was
sparked by an identical proposal
at Berkeley, which has been ap
proved under the title, "Social
Analysis 133-X, The Politics of
Race Relations." Two Stanford
juniors, Michael Bruwer and
Jim Hartnett, interested Drek
meier and other professors in
the idea in late February.
With winter quarter coming
to a close, Drekmeier took on
the formidable task of getting
approval from the University
administration. It wasn't easy.
Drekmeier had to reassure the
administration that students
wouldn't be caught in a riot. In
case the King campaign fizzled,
alternative study projects had
to be planned. Several social
science departments had to be
persuaded to give academic
credit in "directed reading" for
the students involved.
But lack of funds almost
killed the project. $6,400 was
needed to pay Bernard's and
Liebow's salaries and cover var
ious expenses. Drekmeier was
told "higher priorities" pre
vented the University from pro
viding the funds, and an out

side foundation also turned him
down.
On March 21, just 15 minutes
before Drekmeier promised a
worried group of student appli
cants that he'd tell them wheth
er the Washington study was
still alive, Robert Sears, dean of
humanities and sciences, called
to say he had secured he $6,400
from a variety of University
sources.

The 33 students were chosen
by five professors from among
54 applicants. At their first
meeting March 27 at Drek
meier's home, tutor Mary Mon
tie told them, "If this program
fails, it means other programs
in the future will fail to get
approval."
Drekmeier told the students,

PREPARE FOR WASHINGTON â€” Thirty-three undergraduates
listened to Prof. Kenneth Prewitt discuss the civil rights move
ment yesterday in the Clubhouse. The group is preparing for field
research of Martin Luther King's Poor People's Campaign next
month in Washington, D.C.
"We expect an almost full-time
commitment."
The students will be ordered
back to Stanford if a crisis de
velops during the campaign, or
their "presence becomes an em
barrassment to Dr. King."
But Drekmeier, having over
come so many obstacles to the
program, isn't likely to get cold
feet. "This University has got
to grow up," he commented.
"This is an unprecedented op
portunity for our students to re
search and observe the politics
of race and social relations."
Thirty-three Stanford students
are intensively preparing to do
15 units of field research on
Martin Luther King's "Poor
People's Campaign" in Wash
ington, D.C. beginning April 22.
But the program's sponsors,
who struggled for weeks to get
University approval of the un
precedented study, are troubled
by King's repeated postpone
ments of the start of the mas
sive demonstrations. The bloody
Memphis riot last week caused
widespread fears that the Wash
ington demonstrations would
lead to violence.
Undaunted, the Stanford
group is meeting daily for sem
inars on sociological research
methods, mass movements, pov
erty and civil rights. Professors
Paul Wallin, Kenneth Prewitt,
Alan Beals, John Meyer and
William Rivers are teaching the
classes, with the help of grad
uate students Mary Montle, De
lores Mack, Gordon Black and
Richard Young.
Before leaving for Washing
ton, each of the 33 undergrad
uates will plan a research pro
ject on the poor people's march,
which is intended to pressure
Congress into giving "jobs and
income" to the poor.
At least four other univers
ities, including Berkeley, Michi
gan, Michigan State and Anti

och, are sending groups of stu
dents to study King's campaign.
Five UCLA students will ac
