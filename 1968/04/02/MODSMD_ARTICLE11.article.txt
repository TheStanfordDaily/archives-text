# Letters To The Editor
## ROTC Ain't Rosy 
### 
Editor, The Dally:
"... A random sampling of
two dozen seniors and graduate
students indicates that many
are considering the ROTC." —
San Francisco Chronicle, March
4.
As a former applicant to the
two-year .ROTC programs of the
Army and the Navy. I learned
much about the program from
the military officers I talked to;
this knowledge may be helpful
* to potential or present appli
cants to the program. A student
« who is considering the two-year
program should recognize the
commitment that will be re
quired of him. . . .
Therefore a potential officer
should first examine his con
science, asking himself whether
he can accept the responsibility
of leading men to kill those
fighting for the North Vietna
mese. If a student feels he can
conscientiously accept this re
sponsibility regardless of his
personal opinions, if he can
agree to lead men to kill when
ordered to do so even if he
sees no real justification for the
killing, then I would recommend
the ROTC as one way to avoid
the draft and stay in school for
two more years.
But when a rational student,
not agreeing with the actions of
the military arm of the United
States, enters the ROTC pro
gram, he is being false to him
self; he is lying to his consci
ence. To decide whether one can
take the life of another human
being is indeed a difficult de
cision.

Solution To Draft:
Giant Med Schools
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to propose the
following solution to the most
recent draft deferment directive
of General Hershey:
Stanford, as well as every
other medical, dentistry and vet
erinary school in the country,
should accept for admission any
student who applies. Every stu
dent who so desires would there
fore be draft deferable.
Some distinction between au
thentic medical students and
those merely trying to avoid
the draft could be made at a
subsequent date.
This plan of token enrollment
would not only free the serious
graduate student to pursue his
interests; it might also serve to
benefit the graduate schools in
volved. A special "draft dodger's

tuition" of say $50 a month
could be charged, and with the
probable number of young men
willing to participate, a fantastic
sum of money could be raised
to further medical research.

Editor, The Daily:
Universities are accepting,
"under protest," the congres
sional restrictions prohibiting
the granting of federal funds to
students and faculty convicted
of "inciting, promoting, or car
rying on a riot, or any group
activity resulting in material
damage to property or injury
to persons. . . ." The universities
will issue shortly a strong con
demnation of this provision.
Earlier they had vigorously con
demned, without effect, the abo
lition of graduate deferments.
. . . The universities do not
seem to understand that once
a right is lost, it is never re
gained. . . Reason is regarded
as sovereign in the universities
but, and this is the forgotten
point, we are not dealing with
reasonable men and in the
world of politics, reason without
force is a crying of wind.
Not only should the univers
ities refuse to accept monies
with political restrictions but
they must also refuse govern
ment contracts in any pursuit
that may be of immediate bene
fit to the government. It is use
less to speak of reason unless
our arguments are backed by
more than reason.

Universities are accepting,
"under protest," the congres
sional restrictions prohibiting
the granting of federal funds to
students and faculty convicted
of "inciting, promoting, or car
rying on a riot, or any group
activity resulting in material
damage to property or injury
to persons. . . ." The universities
will issue shortly a strong con
demnation of this provision.
Earlier they had vigorously con
demned, without effect, the abo
lition of graduate deferments.
. . . The universities do not
seem to understand that once
a right is lost, it is never re
gained. . . Reason is regarded
as sovereign in the universities
but, and this is the forgotten
point, we are not dealing with
reasonable men and in the
world of politics, reason without
force is a crying of wind.
Not only should the univers
ities refuse to accept monies
with political restrictions but
they must also refuse govern
ment contracts in any pursuit
that may be of immediate bene
fit to the government. It is use
less to speak of reason unless
our arguments are backed by
more than reason.

"... A random sampling of
two dozen seniors and graduate
students indicates that many
are considering the ROTC." —
San Francisco Chronicle, March
4.
As a former applicant to the
two-year .ROTC programs of the
Army and the Navy. I learned
much about the program from
the military officers I talked to;
this knowledge may be helpful
* to potential or present appli
cants to the program. A student
« who is considering the two-year
program should recognize the
commitment that will be re
quired of him. . . .
Therefore a potential officer
should first examine his con
science, asking himself whether
he can accept the responsibility
of leading men to kill those
fighting for the North Vietna
mese. If a student feels he can
conscientiously accept this re
sponsibility regardless of his
personal opinions, if he can
agree to lead men to kill when
ordered to do so even if he
sees no real justification for the
killing, then I would recommend
the ROTC as one way to avoid
the draft and stay in school for
two more years.
But when a rational student,
not agreeing with the actions of
the military arm of the United
States, enters the ROTC pro
gram, he is being false to him
self; he is lying to his consci
ence. To decide whether one can
take the life of another human
being is indeed a difficult de
cision.

Solution To Draft:
Giant Med Schools
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to propose the
following solution to the most
recent draft deferment directive
of General Hershey:
Stanford, as well as every
other medical, dentistry and vet
erinary school in the country,
should accept for admission any
student who applies. Every stu
dent who so desires would there
fore be draft deferable.
Some distinction between au
thentic medical students and
those merely trying to avoid
the draft could be made at a
subsequent date.
This plan of token enrollment
would not only free the serious
graduate student to pursue his
interests; it might also serve to
benefit the graduate schools in
volved. A special "draft dodger's

tuition" of say $50 a month
could be charged, and with the
probable number of young men
willing to participate, a fantastic
sum of money could be raised
to further medical research.
