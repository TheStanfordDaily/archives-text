# My Typewriter Is Bugged
## At Last We Can Agree With LBJ 
### Michael Sweeney 
For the first time in years,
Lyndon Johnson did something
which we all approve. By yield
ing to political pressure and
spiritual fatigue, he gave stu
dents, blacks, liberals, poor peo
ple and other minorities a frag
ment of hope.
But his retirement justified
hope, no more. Immediate im
provement in the plight of the
universities and nation at large
can't be expected. Johnson made
as much clear in his speech Sun
day. It was a mixed message,
balancing the sweet with the
sour.
He did announce he would not
accept renomination. And he did
not state a preference for his
successor. He did halt bombing
over most of North Vietnam
and ask for peace negotiations.
But at the same time Johnson

announced a 13,500 man In
crease in our Vietnam army.
The draft will be as big a threat
as ever to individual students
and the universities. Graduate
schools can still expect to be
raped thoroughly next year.
Johnson also gave no hope
that the burgeoning war ex
penditures would stop choking
oIT domestic spending. The "de
fense" budget this fiscal year
will be $2.5 billion greater than
expected, and $2.6 billion more
than predicted for the 1968-69
fiscal year.
More disillusioning still is
Johnson's promise to cut total
government expenditures as
much as Congress demands to
insure passage of the 10 per
cent tax surcharge. If war
spending will keep soaring past
its $70 billion level, where will

the cuts come?
That's right friend—more
guns mean less Kellogg's corn
flakes. Every worthwhile fed
eral program will be bled dry.
The anti-poverty program will
remain stagnated. Foreign aid
will continue to shrivel. Spend
ing for higher education, urban
redevelopment and pollution
control will remain static or
even decline.
Johnson is sticking with his
mind-boggling demand March 18
for "a program of national aus
terity to insure that our econ
omy will prosper and that our
fiscal position will be sound."
Ho spoke those words amid the
recent gold scare. Besides bud
get cuts, he warned of restric
tions on overseas travel and in
vestment.
The next day, March 19, he

said, "We have set our course
and we will pursue it just as
long as aggression threatens us.
Make no mistake about it:
America will prevail.'
After telling Americans they
will have to face "national aus
terity" to save the Saigon gov
ernment and defend the price
of gold, the only decent thing
the man could do was quit.
Even if a negotiated settle
ment in Vietnam comes fairly
soon, the nation as a whole can
expect little short-run improve
ment in domestic affairs. Nor
can the universities. The Viet
nam troop increase emphasizes
that no decline in the 3-million
plus size of U.S. armed forces
is planned. Even if the 525,000
soldiers pulled out of South
Vietnam, the Pentagon would
demand we maintain a high do

gree of "preparedness" to meet
flare-ups in Thailand, Korea,
Washington, D.C. and Chicago.
Draft calls will not decline.
The plight of the graduating
senior and graduate student is
unrelieved. To quote one of
LBJ's favorite ghastlies, "We are
beginning to see light at the end
of the tunnel," but we can't
hope to escape from the shadow
of the draft during the next
year.
So it was a good and bad per
formance by Johnson. He cer
tainly showed no greater candor
than usual. His reason for quit
ting, you will recall, was, "I do
not believe that I should devote
an hour of my time to any per
sonal partisan causes or to any
duties other than the awesome
duties of this oflice." Sure thing.
In our choosing between the
candidates for his job, we
should desire more than ever a
man who has the guts and good
sense to be honest, open, and
reasonably selfless.

Vietnam, the Pentagon would
demand we maintain a high do

gree of "preparedness" to meet
flare-ups in Thailand, Korea,
Washington, D.C. and Chicago.
Draft calls will not decline.
The plight of the graduating
senior and graduate student is
unrelieved. To quote one of
LBJ's favorite ghastlies, "We are
beginning to see light at the end
of the tunnel," but we can't
hope to escape from the shadow
of the draft during the next
year.
So it was a good and bad per
formance by Johnson. He cer
tainly showed no greater candor
than usual. His reason for quit
ting, you will recall, was, "I do
not believe that I should devote
an hour of my time to any per
sonal partisan causes or to any
duties other than the awesome
duties of this oflice." Sure thing.
In our choosing between the
candidates for his job, we
should desire more than ever a
man who has the guts and good
sense to be honest, open, and
reasonably selfless.
For the first time in years,
Lyndon Johnson did something
which we all approve. By yield
ing to political pressure and
spiritual fatigue, he gave stu
dents, blacks, liberals, poor peo
ple and other minorities a frag
ment of hope.
But his retirement justified
hope, no more. Immediate im
provement in the plight of the
universities and nation at large
can't be expected. Johnson made
as much clear in his speech Sun
day. It was a mixed message,
balancing the sweet with the
sour.
He did announce he would not
accept renomination. And he did
not state a preference for his
successor. He did halt bombing
over most of North Vietnam
and ask for peace negotiations.
But at the same time Johnson

announced a 13,500 man In
crease in our Vietnam army.
The draft will be as big a threat
as ever to individual students
and the universities. Graduate
schools can still expect to be
raped thoroughly next year.
Johnson also gave no hope
that the burgeoning war ex
penditures would stop choking
oIT domestic spending. The "de
fense" budget this fiscal year
will be $2.5 billion greater than
expected, and $2.6 billion more
than predicted for the 1968-69
fiscal year.
More disillusioning still is
Johnson's promise to cut total
government expenditures as
much as Congress demands to
insure passage of the 10 per
cent tax surcharge. If war
spending will keep soaring past
its $70 billion level, where will

the cuts come?
That's right friend—more
guns mean less Kellogg's corn
flakes. Every worthwhile fed
eral program will be bled dry.
The anti-poverty program will
remain stagnated. Foreign aid
will continue to shrivel. Spend
ing for higher education, urban
redevelopment and pollution
control will remain static or
even decline.
Johnson is sticking with his
mind-boggling demand March 18
for "a program of national aus
terity to insure that our econ
omy will prosper and that our
fiscal position will be sound."
Ho spoke those words amid the
recent gold scare. Besides bud
get cuts, he warned of restric
tions on overseas travel and in
vestment.
The next day, March 19, he

said, "We have set our course
and we will pursue it just as
long as aggression threatens us.
Make no mistake about it:
America will prevail.'
After telling Americans they
will have to face "national aus
terity" to save the Saigon gov
ernment and defend the price
of gold, the only decent thing
the man could do was quit.
Even if a negotiated settle
ment in Vietnam comes fairly
soon, the nation as a whole can
expect little short-run improve
ment in domestic affairs. Nor
can the universities. The Viet
nam troop increase emphasizes
that no decline in the 3-million
plus size of U.S. armed forces
is planned. Even if the 525,000
soldiers pulled out of South
Vietnam, the Pentagon would
demand we maintain a high do

gree of "preparedness" to meet
flare-ups in Thailand, Korea,
Washington, D.C. and Chicago.
