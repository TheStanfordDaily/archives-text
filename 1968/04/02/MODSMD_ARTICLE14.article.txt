## The 						Facts About ASSU 
### RICH WARE (Student Financial Manager Rich Ware writes the first of two descriptive articles on the Associated Students. A campuswide convention is planned Saturday to rewrite the ASSU constitution) 
Strangely enough, with all the
talk lately about the merits of
the Associated Students, there
exists a great deal of confusion
as to what ASSU actually is. It
seems appropriate that the basic
facts be clarified before discus
sing how the structure should
be changed. This is not to be
either a defense or an argument
for change — just what ASSU is
now.
First, all Stanford students
who hold a valid Certificate of
Registration are automatically
members — whether undergrad
uate or graduate. Thus all stu
dents are eligible to participate
in both the political and pro
gram-oriented activities of the
ASSU, either as decision-makers
or recipients of the benefits such
as speakers, hostels, or concerts.
In the ASSU Constitution,
adopted in mid-1963, the Asso
ciation has three branches: the
Executive, the Legislature, and
the Judicial Council. In contrast
to the pre-1963 setup, the Pres
ident is separate from the Legi
slature — the theoretically su
preme body — and, for an execu
tive, has few actual duties. All
administrative functions remain
with the Legislature.
The President is, on paper, the
overseer of the entire ASSU ma
chine. He is an ex-officio member
of all boards and commissions,
has a veto power over the Legi
slature, and is charged with ex
ecutive supervision of the ASSU
Office. One of his most important
powers is that of appointing the
student members of the many
University committees. In this
respect, he is now much more
powerful than Presidents two or
three years ago who could only
recommend the students for com
mittees, with the ultimate deci
sion made by the University
President.
Even with these powers and
duties, which sound at first con
siderable, the President actually
spends little time at them- The
remainder of his time is occupied
with his particular interests,
such as Mr. Massarenti's music
programs. Therefore, the char
acter of each year's student gov
ernment is dependent upon the
personality and interests of the
executive.
LASSU — the student legisla
ture — is the victim of many
problems and circumstances. In
1963, the size of LASSU was in
creased to its present number of
about 150 seats. The purpose
was to provide a direct represen
tational system for all living
groups and graduate school con
stituencies. The idea was good,
but the result is that Legislature
is now overburdened with de
tails. It Is becoming hopelessly
bogged down. Its large size is a
significant handicap, and the idea
of true representation has been
lost.
The Legislature's duties and
powers include appropriation of
an approximately $130,000 an
nual budget, supervision of all
elections, establishing such
Boards and Commissions are are
necessary to administer general
fields of student activity or in
terest, and to interpret the Fun
damental Standard, the Honor
Code, its Constitution, and its
By-Laws.
One of the two most signifi
cant functions of the Legislature
is its administration of the

ASSU Master Budget. Each
Spring the Student Financial
Manager submits the budget re
quests of the Boards and Com
missions to Legislature for ap
proval.
At that time the groups which
are included in the ASSU By-
Laws request money for speci
fied projects and programs. The
Legislature must decide which
actvities it will support for the
following year. The difference
between what is appropriated
and the total amount available
is put into a contingency fund,
from which the Legislature can
make additional appropriations
to ASSU groups, or offer aid to
voluntary student organizations
for their programs. (ASSU fi
nances will be covered in a later
article.)
Once the Budget has been ap
proved, the Boards and Commis
sions take off in their own direc
tions carrying out their indivi
dual programs. Of course, they
are not allowed to spend reck
lessly since all transactions must
go through the office of the Stu
dent Financial Manager in order
that the intentions of Legislature
may be carried out.
The real substance of the ac
tivities of the Associated Stu
dents is found in the Boards and
Commissions. These groups in
clude, Art Board, Associated
Women Students, Axe Commis
sion, Cardinals Board, Elections
Commission, Graduate Student
Association, Institute of Interna
tional Relations, National Stu
dent Association, Political Union
Board, Pre-Registration Com
mission, Publications Board, Pro
fessor Commission, Speech As
sociation, and the Student-Fac
ulty Board. Some of the activi
ties of these groups will give an
indication of what ASSU really
is:
Cardinals Board is somewhat
of a catchall for tradition-orient
ed activities. It is in charge of the
Big Game Bonfire, Homecoming,
and High School Day (for pros
pective freshmen). Its biggest ac
tivity of the year is the week
long fund-raising drive for the
Stanford Childrens' Convale
scent Home, this year beginning
May 12 with a concert by Sergio
Mendes and Brasil '66, continu
ing with community-wide solici
tations, and ending with a three
day, full-scale carnival near the
Stanford Shopping Center and
Con Home. Also, Cardinals
Board has been working to estab
lish a Volunteer Services Office
— a permanent office to coordi
nate Peace Corps, VISTA, and
other social service project re
cruiting.
Pre-Registration Commission.
The general purpose of Pre-Reg
is to orient incoming freshmen
to the University. In the past, the
manner in which this has been
attempted has come under fire.
The group planning next year's
activities is attempting to start
from scratch, abandoning the so
cial emphasis of the past, and
decide what should be included
in an orientation program. Es
sentially, Pre-Reg wants to ex
pedite the adjustment of fresh
men and transfer students to the
physical and intellectual life of
Stanford. It seems reasonable,
they feel, to premise intellectual
adjustment on a previous physi
cal orientation since it might be
unnecessarily upsetting to shock
the mind intellectually before it
has a chance to adjust to other
aspects of the new environment.
The overriding theme is to chal
lenge newcomers — challenge
them to face issues with an open
mind and challenge them to
know themselves and those

around them on more than a
superficial level.
A_xe Commission — our school
spirit group is basically in
charge of rallies, card stunts at
football games, and cheering sec
tions. Also, they coordinate the
annual Spring Sing in Frost Am
phitheater. Axe Comrn has suf
feied over the last several years
from its image as an in-crowd
party group. Next year's Axe
Coram is working to counter the
old image with positive pro
grams, appealing to a sometimes
lagging school spirit. As with
Pre-Reg, this has involved a re
thinking of objectives.
Political Union Board. The pur
pose of Political Union is to pre
sent a varied program of edu
cation on political and social is
sues. The Board does not take
positions on these issues, but
rather attempts to supplement
the efforts of others to present
to Stanford a balanced program
of speakers and panels. It works
in close cooperation with many
other University and student
groups in bringing speakers.
For example, Poli U helped
the Black Student Union sponsor
Ron Karenga during Winter
Quarter, with the support of
Tresidder Union and the ASSU
Legislature. Political Union also
sponsored speeches by Sen. Eu
gene McCarthy, Sen. Gale Mc-
Gee, M. Francois Mitterand, and
William Rusher, among others.
Institute of International Re
lations. The purpose of the lIR
is to serve Stanford University
as a center for ideas, informa
tion, and activity concerning
international relations and,
through policies and projects.
The lIR works to accomplish its
goals through various informa
tional conferences, exchange pro
grams with several foreign uni
versities, publications, and pro
grams in cooperation with the In
ternational Center.
The lIR frequently sponsors
speakers and encourages inter
action between American stu
dents, foreign students, and oth
er participants. One of the most
recent actvities of the lIR was
the Mexicali Work Project over
Spring break. Also included are
the weekly I-Club Evenings
Abroad, coffee hours, language
hours, and foreign student pre
reg.
National Student Association.
With the controversy over mem
bership in NSA, the major acti
vity of this group has been its
autonomous Stanford Area Tu
torial program in East Palo Alto.
Workers on the tutorial are at
tempting to expand its scope, as
well as coordinating all the other
tutorials on campus. The NSA
tutorial now includes about 80
volunteer tutors, with as many
tutees. NSA recently sent some
students to a conference in Los

Angeles concerning student drug
use, and is looking forward to
another conference on "student
stress."
Speech Association. One of the
larger segments of the budget
goes to send Stanford debaters
and speakers to tournaments a'
other schools, as well as to spon
sor tourneys here on campus
The Speech Association is about
150 strong, one of tho largest
collegiate speech groups.
Student-Faculty Board. The
Stu-Fac Board was organized t-.
promote a closer relationship be
tween the students and the far
ulty, and to assist student groups
in realizing their purposes. Thi c
they accomplish in part through
encouraging and arranging stu
dent-faculty firesides and hostels,
and through promoting the fac
ulty associate programs. Th'
Board includes faculty members
Professor Commission. The
Professor Commission was or
ganized last Spring with the pur
pose of seeking an educator to
serve for an academic year as
an ASSU-supported professor
at-large. He would have no for
mal attachments to any specific
department at Stanford, but rath
er function as an individual spon
soring his own seminars in a
manner the Association sees fit.
This, also, is a student-faculty
commission.
There are several other groups
which are not supported finan
cially by the ASSU, but affiliated
with it. These are Rams Head
(dramatic productions), Wom
en's Recreation Association, tho
ASSU Travel Service, and all the
ASSU publications. The publica
tions include the Daily, the Quad,
the Chaparral, the Workshop,
and the Stanford Course Review.
For all of them, the ASSU acts
as publisher. All but the Daily
are completely self-financing;
the Daily receives about $28,000
per year as a subsidy-subscrip
tion fee. This figure amounts to
about 2VaC per student per issue,
and represents a small part of
the Daily's total budget.
What I am trying to say with
all this is that the ASSU is a
very large and complex organiza
tion. Such a statement seems
very trite, but in the last few
weeks I have heard a great many
students say something like,
"Fine, abolish ASSU. We don't
need Legislature anyway."
Maybe we don't need LASSU,
but Stanford would be even dead
er than it has been this year
without many of the programs
sponsored by ASSU. And pros
pects now are looking better as
many of the groups are being
reorganized and revitalized. Be
fore restructuring ASSU or
abolishing the whole business,
the student body should study
more carefully what it is they
are talking about.
Strangely enough, with all the
talk lately about the merits of
the Associated Students, there
exists a great deal of confusion
as to what ASSU actually is. It

Abroad, coffee hours, language
hours, and foreign student pre
reg.
National Student Association.
With the controversy over mem
bership in NSA, the major acti
vity of this group has been its
autonomous Stanford Area Tu
torial program in East Palo Alto.
Workers on the tutorial are at
tempting to expand its scope, as
well as coordinating all the other
tutorials on campus. The NSA
tutorial now includes about 80
volunteer tutors, with as many
tutees. NSA recently sent some
students to a conference in Los

Angeles concerning student drug
use, and is looking forward to
another conference on "student
stress."
Speech Association. One of the
larger segments of the budget
goes to send Stanford debaters
and speakers to tournaments a'
other schools, as well as to spon
sor tourneys here on campus
The Speech Association is about
150 strong, one of tho largest
collegiate speech groups.
Student-Faculty Board. The
Stu-Fac Board was organized t-.
promote a closer relationship be
tween the students and the far
ulty, and to assist student groups
in realizing their purposes. Thi c
they accomplish in part through
encouraging and arranging stu
dent-faculty firesides and hostels,
and through promoting the fac
ulty associate programs. Th'
Board includes faculty members
Professor Commission. The
Professor Commission was or
ganized last Spring with the pur
pose of seeking an educator to
serve for an academic year as
an ASSU-supported professor
at-large. He would have no for
mal attachments to any specific
department at Stanford, but rath
er function as an individual spon
soring his own seminars in a
manner the Association sees fit.
This, also, is a student-faculty
commission.
There are several other groups
which are not supported finan
cially by the ASSU, but affiliated
with it. These are Rams Head
(dramatic productions), Wom
en's Recreation Association, tho
ASSU Travel Service, and all the
ASSU publications. The publica
tions include the Daily, the Quad,
the Chaparral, the Workshop,
and the Stanford Course Review.
For all of them, the ASSU acts
as publisher. All but the Daily
are completely self-financing;
the Daily receives about $28,000
per year as a subsidy-subscrip
tion fee. This figure amounts to
about 2VaC per student per issue,
and represents a small part of
the Daily's total budget.
What I am trying to say with
all this is that the ASSU is a
very large and complex organiza
tion. Such a statement seems
very trite, but in the last few
weeks I have heard a great many
students say something like,
"Fine, abolish ASSU. We don't
need Legislature anyway."
Maybe we don't need LASSU,
but Stanford would be even dead
er than it has been this year
without many of the programs
sponsored by ASSU. And pros
pects now are looking better as
many of the groups are being
reorganized and revitalized. Be
fore restructuring ASSU or
abolishing the whole business,
the student body should study
more carefully what it is they
are talking about.
Strangely enough, with all the
talk lately about the merits of
the Associated Students, there
exists a great deal of confusion
as to what ASSU actually is. It
seems appropriate that the basic
facts be clarified before discus
sing how the structure should
be changed. This is not to be
either a defense or an argument
for change — just what ASSU is
now.
First, all Stanford students
who hold a valid Certificate of
Registration are automatically
members — whether undergrad
uate or graduate. Thus all stu
dents are eligible to participate
in both the political and pro
gram-oriented activities of the
ASSU, either as decision-makers
or recipients of the benefits such
as speakers, hostels, or concerts.
In the ASSU Constitution,
adopted in mid-1963, the Asso
ciation has three branches: the
Executive, the Legislature, and
the Judicial Council. In contrast
to the pre-1963 setup, the Pres
ident is separate from the Legi
slature — the theoretically su
preme body — and, for an execu
tive, has few actual duties. All
administrative functions remain
with the Legislature.
The President is, on paper, the
overseer of the entire ASSU ma
chine. He is an ex-officio member
of all boards and commissions,
has a veto power over the Legi
slature, and is charged with ex
ecutive supervision of the ASSU
Office. One of his most important
powers is that of appointing the
student members of the many
University committees. In this
respect, he is now much more
powerful than Presidents two or
three years ago who could only
recommend the students for com
mittees, with the ultimate deci
sion made by the University
President.
Even with these powers and
duties, which sound at first con
siderable, the President actually
spends little time at them- The
remainder of his time is occupied
with his particular interests,
such as Mr. Massarenti's music
programs. Therefore, the char
acter of each year's student gov
ernment is dependent upon the
personality and interests of the
executive.
LASSU — the student legisla
ture — is the victim of many
problems and circumstances. In
1963, the size of LASSU was in
creased to its present number of
about 150 seats. The purpose
was to provide a direct represen
tational system for all living
groups and graduate school con
stituencies. The idea was good,
but the result is that Legislature
is now overburdened with de
tails. It Is becoming hopelessly
bogged down. Its large size is a
significant handicap, and the idea
of true representation has been
lost.
The Legislature's duties and
powers include appropriation of
an approximately $130,000 an
nual budget, supervision of all
elections, establishing such
Boards and Commissions are are
necessary to administer general
fields of student activity or in
terest, and to interpret the Fun
damental Standard, the Honor
Code, its Constitution, and its
By-Laws.
One of the two most signifi
cant functions of the Legislature
is its administration of the

ASSU Master Budget. Each
Spring the Student Financial
Manager submits the budget re
quests of the Boards and Com
missions to Legislature for ap
proval.
At that time the groups which
are included in the ASSU By-
Laws request money for speci
fied projects and programs. The
Legislature must decide which
actvities it will support for the
following year. The difference
between what is appropriated
and the total amount available
is put into a contingency fund,
from which the Legislature can
make additional appropriations
to ASSU groups, or offer aid to
voluntary student organizations
for their programs. (ASSU fi
nances will be covered in a later
article.)
Once the Budget has been ap
proved, the Boards and Commis
sions take off in their own direc
tions carrying out their indivi
dual programs. Of course, they
are not allowed to spend reck
lessly since all transactions must
go through the office of the Stu
dent Financial Manager in order
that the intentions of Legislature
may be carried out.
The real substance of the ac
tivities of the Associated Stu
dents is found in the Boards and
Commissions. These groups in
clude, Art Board, Associated
Women Students, Axe Commis
sion, Cardinals Board, Elections
Commission, Graduate Student
Association, Institute of Interna
tional Relations, National Stu
dent Association, Political Union
Board, Pre-Registration Com
mission, Publications Board, Pro
fessor Commission, Speech As
sociation, and the Student-Fac
ulty Board. Some of the activi
ties of these groups will give an
indication of what ASSU really
is:
Cardinals Board is somewhat
of a catchall for tradition-orient
ed activities. It is in charge of the
Big Game Bonfire, Homecoming,
and High School Day (for pros
pective freshmen). Its biggest ac
tivity of the year is the week
long fund-raising drive for the
Stanford Childrens' Convale
scent Home, this year beginning
May 12 with a concert by Sergio
Mendes and Brasil '66, continu
ing with community-wide solici
tations, and ending with a three
day, full-scale carnival near the
Stanford Shopping Center and
Con Home. Also, Cardinals
Board has been working to estab
lish a Volunteer Services Office
— a permanent office to coordi
nate Peace Corps, VISTA, and
other social service project re
cruiting.
Pre-Registration Commission.
The general purpose of Pre-Reg
is to orient incoming freshmen
to the University. In the past, the
manner in which this has been
attempted has come under fire.
The group planning next year's
activities is attempting to start
from scratch, abandoning the so
cial emphasis of the past, and
decide what should be included
in an orientation program. Es
sentially, Pre-Reg wants to ex
pedite the adjustment of fresh
men and transfer students to the
physical and intellectual life of
Stanford. It seems reasonable,
they feel, to premise intellectual
adjustment on a previous physi
cal orientation since it might be
unnecessarily upsetting to shock
the mind intellectually before it
has a chance to adjust to other
aspects of the new environment.
The overriding theme is to chal
lenge newcomers — challenge
them to face issues with an open
mind and challenge them to
know themselves and those

around them on more than a
superficial level.
A_xe Commission — our school
spirit group is basically in
charge of rallies, card stunts at
football games, and cheering sec
tions. Also, they coordinate the
annual Spring Sing in Frost Am
phitheater. Axe Comrn has suf
feied over the last several years
from its image as an in-crowd
party group. Next year's Axe
Coram is working to counter the
old image with positive pro
grams, appealing to a sometimes
lagging school spirit. As with
Pre-Reg, this has involved a re
thinking of objectives.
Political Union Board. The pur
pose of Political Union is to pre
sent a varied program of edu
cation on political and social is
sues. The Board does not take
positions on these issues, but
rather attempts to supplement
the efforts of others to present
to Stanford a balanced program
of speakers and panels. It works
in close cooperation with many
other University and student
groups in bringing speakers.
For example, Poli U helped
the Black Student Union sponsor
Ron Karenga during Winter
Quarter, with the support of
Tresidder Union and the ASSU
Legislature. Political Union also
sponsored speeches by Sen. Eu
gene McCarthy, Sen. Gale Mc-
Gee, M. Francois Mitterand, and
William Rusher, among others.
Institute of International Re
lations. The purpose of the lIR
is to serve Stanford University
as a center for ideas, informa
tion, and activity concerning
international relations and,
through policies and projects.
The lIR works to accomplish its
goals through various informa
tional conferences, exchange pro
grams with several foreign uni
versities, publications, and pro
grams in cooperation with the In
ternational Center.
The lIR frequently sponsors
speakers and encourages inter
action between American stu
dents, foreign students, and oth
er participants. One of the most
recent actvities of the lIR was
the Mexicali Work Project over
Spring break. Also included are
the weekly I-Club Evenings
Abroad, coffee hours, language
hours, and foreign student pre
reg.

— a permanent office to coordi

other social service project re
cruiting.
Pre-Registration Commission.
The general purpose of Pre-Reg
is to orient incoming freshmen
to the University. In the past, the
manner in which this has been
attempted has come under fire.
The group planning next year's
activities is attempting to start
from scratch, abandoning the so
cial emphasis of the past, and
decide what should be included
in an orientation program. Es
sentially, Pre-Reg wants to ex
pedite the adjustment of fresh
men and transfer students to the
physical and intellectual life of
Stanford. It seems reasonable,
they feel, to premise intellectual
adjustment on a previous physi
cal orientation since it might be
unnecessarily upsetting to shock
the mind intellectually before it
has a chance to adjust to other
aspects of the new environment.
The overriding theme is to chal
lenge newcomers — challenge
them to face issues with an open
mind and challenge them to
know themselves and those

around them on more than a
superficial level.
A_xe Commission — our school
spirit group is basically in
charge of rallies, card stunts at
football games, and cheering sec
tions. Also, they coordinate the
annual Spring Sing in Frost Am
phitheater. Axe Comrn has suf
feied over the last several years
from its image as an in-crowd
party group. Next year's Axe
Coram is working to counter the
old image with positive pro
grams, appealing to a sometimes
lagging school spirit. As with
Pre-Reg, this has involved a re
thinking of objectives.
Political Union Board. The pur
pose of Political Union is to pre
sent a varied program of edu
cation on political and social is
sues. The Board does not take
positions on these issues, but
rather attempts to supplement
the efforts of others to present
to Stanford a balanced program
of speakers and panels. It works
in close cooperation with many
other University and student
groups in bringing speakers.
For example, Poli U helped
the Black Student Union sponsor
Ron Karenga during Winter
Quarter, with the support of
Tresidder Union and the ASSU
Legislature. Political Union also
sponsored speeches by Sen. Eu
gene McCarthy, Sen. Gale Mc-
Gee, M. Francois Mitterand, and
William Rusher, among others.
Institute of International Re
lations. The purpose of the lIR
is to serve Stanford University
as a center for ideas, informa
tion, and activity concerning
international relations and,
through policies and projects.
The lIR works to accomplish its
goals through various informa
tional conferences, exchange pro
grams with several foreign uni
versities, publications, and pro
grams in cooperation with the In
ternational Center.
The lIR frequently sponsors
speakers and encourages inter
action between American stu
dents, foreign students, and oth
er participants. One of the most
recent actvities of the lIR was
the Mexicali Work Project over
Spring break. Also included are
the weekly I-Club Evenings
Abroad, coffee hours, language
hours, and foreign student pre
reg.
National Student Association.
With the controversy over mem
bership in NSA, the major acti
vity of this group has been its
autonomous Stanford Area Tu
torial program in East Palo Alto.
Workers on the tutorial are at
tempting to expand its scope, as
well as coordinating all the other
tutorials on campus. The NSA
tutorial now includes about 80
volunteer tutors, with as many
tutees. NSA recently sent some
students to a conference in Los

Angeles concerning student drug
use, and is looking forward to
another conference on "student
stress."
Speech Association. One of the
larger segments of the budget
goes to send Stanford debaters
and speakers to tournaments a'
other schools, as well as to spon
sor tourneys here on campus
The Speech Association is about
150 strong, one of tho largest
collegiate speech groups.
Student-Faculty Board. The
Stu-Fac Board was organized t-.
promote a closer relationship be
tween the students and the far
ulty, and to assist student groups
in realizing their purposes. Thi c
they accomplish in part through
encouraging and arranging stu
dent-faculty firesides and hostels,
and through promoting the fac
ulty associate programs. Th'
Board includes faculty members
Professor Commission. The
Professor Commission was or
ganized last Spring with the pur
pose of seeking an educator to
serve for an academic year as
an ASSU-supported professor
at-large. He would have no for
mal attachments to any specific
department at Stanford, but rath
er function as an individual spon
soring his own seminars in a
manner the Association sees fit.
This, also, is a student-faculty
commission.
There are several other groups
which are not supported finan
cially by the ASSU, but affiliated
with it. These are Rams Head
(dramatic productions), Wom
en's Recreation Association, tho
ASSU Travel Service, and all the
ASSU publications. The publica
tions include the Daily, the Quad,
the Chaparral, the Workshop,
and the Stanford Course Review.
For all of them, the ASSU acts
as publisher. All but the Daily
are completely self-financing;
the Daily receives about $28,000
per year as a subsidy-subscrip
tion fee. This figure amounts to
about 2VaC per student per issue,
and represents a small part of
the Daily's total budget.
What I am trying to say with
all this is that the ASSU is a
very large and complex organiza
tion. Such a statement seems
very trite, but in the last few
weeks I have heard a great many
students say something like,
"Fine, abolish ASSU. We don't
need Legislature anyway."
Maybe we don't need LASSU,
but Stanford would be even dead
er than it has been this year
without many of the programs
sponsored by ASSU. And pros
pects now are looking better as
many of the groups are being
reorganized and revitalized. Be
fore restructuring ASSU or
abolishing the whole business,
the student body should study
more carefully what it is they
are talking about.
Strangely enough, with all the
talk lately about the merits of
the Associated Students, there
exists a great deal of confusion
as to what ASSU actually is. It
seems appropriate that the basic
facts be clarified before discus
sing how the structure should
be changed. This is not to be
either a defense or an argument
for change — just what ASSU is
now.
First, all Stanford students
who hold a valid Certificate of
Registration are automatically
members — whether undergrad
uate or graduate. Thus all stu
dents are eligible to participate
in both the political and pro
gram-oriented activities of the
ASSU, either as decision-makers
or recipients of the benefits such
as speakers, hostels, or concerts.
In the ASSU Constitution,
adopted in mid-1963, the Asso
ciation has three branches: the
Executive, the Legislature, and
the Judicial Council. In contrast
to the pre-1963 setup, the Pres
ident is separate from the Legi
slature — the theoretically su
preme body — and, for an execu
tive, has few actual duties. All
administrative functions remain
with the Legislature.
The President is, on paper, the
overseer of the entire ASSU ma
chine. He is an ex-officio member
of all boards and commissions,
has a veto power over the Legi
slature, and is charged with ex
ecutive supervision of the ASSU
Office. One of his most important
powers is that of appointing the
student members of the many
University committees. In this
respect, he is now much more
powerful than Presidents two or
three years ago who could only
recommend the students for com
mittees, with the ultimate deci
sion made by the University
President.
Even with these powers and
duties, which sound at first con
siderable, the President actually
spends little time at them- The
remainder of his time is occupied
with his particular interests,
such as Mr. Massarenti's music
programs. Therefore, the char
acter of each year's student gov
ernment is dependent upon the
personality and interests of the
executive.
LASSU — the student legisla
ture — is the victim of many
problems and circumstances. In
1963, the size of LASSU was in
creased to its present number of
about 150 seats. The purpose
was to provide a direct represen
tational system for all living
groups and graduate school con
stituencies. The idea was good,
but the result is that Legislature
is now overburdened with de
tails. It Is becoming hopelessly
bogged down. Its large size is a
significant handicap, and the idea
of true representation has been
lost.
The Legislature's duties and
powers include appropriation of
an approximately $130,000 an
nual budget, supervision of all
elections, establishing such
Boards and Commissions are are
necessary to administer general
fields of student activity or in
terest, and to interpret the Fun
damental Standard, the Honor
Code, its Constitution, and its
By-Laws.
One of the two most signifi
cant functions of the Legislature
is its administration of the

ASSU Master Budget. Each
Spring the Student Financial
Manager submits the budget re
quests of the Boards and Com
missions to Legislature for ap
proval.
At that time the groups which
are included in the ASSU By-
Laws request money for speci
fied projects and programs. The
Legislature must decide which
actvities it will support for the
following year. The difference
between what is appropriated
and the total amount available
is put into a contingency fund,
from which the Legislature can
make additional appropriations
to ASSU groups, or offer aid to
voluntary student organizations
for their programs. (ASSU fi
nances will be covered in a later
article.)
Once the Budget has been ap
proved, the Boards and Commis
sions take off in their own direc
tions carrying out their indivi
dual programs. Of course, they
are not allowed to spend reck
lessly since all transactions must
go through the office of the Stu
dent Financial Manager in order
that the intentions of Legislature
may be carried out.
The real substance of the ac
tivities of the Associated Stu
dents is found in the Boards and
Commissions. These groups in
clude, Art Board, Associated
Women Students, Axe Commis
sion, Cardinals Board, Elections
Commission, Graduate Student
Association, Institute of Interna
tional Relations, National Stu
dent Association, Political Union
Board, Pre-Registration Com
mission, Publications Board, Pro
fessor Commission, Speech As
sociation, and the Student-Fac
ulty Board. Some of the activi
ties of these groups will give an
indication of what ASSU really
is:
Cardinals Board is somewhat
of a catchall for tradition-orient
ed activities. It is in charge of the
Big Game Bonfire, Homecoming,
and High School Day (for pros
pective freshmen). Its biggest ac
tivity of the year is the week
long fund-raising drive for the
Stanford Childrens' Convale
scent Home, this year beginning
May 12 with a concert by Sergio
Mendes and Brasil '66, continu
ing with community-wide solici
tations, and ending with a three
day, full-scale carnival near the
Stanford Shopping Center and
Con Home. Also, Cardinals
Board has been working to estab

other social service project re

tational system for all living
groups and graduate school con
stituencies. The idea was good,
but the result is that Legislature
is now overburdened with de
tails. It Is becoming hopelessly
bogged down. Its large size is a
significant handicap, and the idea
of true representation has been
lost.
The Legislature's duties and
powers include appropriation of
an approximately $130,000 an
nual budget, supervision of all
elections, establishing such
Boards and Commissions are are
necessary to administer general
fields of student activity or in
terest, and to interpret the Fun
damental Standard, the Honor
Code, its Constitution, and its
By-Laws.
One of the two most signifi
cant functions of the Legislature
is its administration of the

ASSU Master Budget. Each
Spring the Student Financial
Manager submits the budget re
quests of the Boards and Com
missions to Legislature for ap
proval.
At that time the groups which
are included in the ASSU By-
Laws request money for speci
fied projects and programs. The
Legislature must decide which
actvities it will support for the
following year. The difference
between what is appropriated
and the total amount available
is put into a contingency fund,
from which the Legislature can
make additional appropriations
to ASSU groups, or offer aid to
voluntary student organizations
for their programs. (ASSU fi
nances will be covered in a later
article.)
Once the Budget has been ap
proved, the Boards and Commis
sions take off in their own direc
tions carrying out their indivi
dual programs. Of course, they
are not allowed to spend reck
lessly since all transactions must
go through the office of the Stu
dent Financial Manager in order
that the intentions of Legislature
may be carried out.
The real substance of the ac
tivities of the Associated Stu
dents is found in the Boards and
Commissions. These groups in
clude, Art Board, Associated
Women Students, Axe Commis
sion, Cardinals Board, Elections
Commission, Graduate Student
Association, Institute of Interna
tional Relations, National Stu
dent Association, Political Union
Board, Pre-Registration Com
mission, Publications Board, Pro
fessor Commission, Speech As
sociation, and the Student-Fac
ulty Board. Some of the activi
ties of these groups will give an
indication of what ASSU really
is:
Cardinals Board is somewhat
of a catchall for tradition-orient
ed activities. It is in charge of the
Big Game Bonfire, Homecoming,
and High School Day (for pros
pective freshmen). Its biggest ac
tivity of the year is the week
long fund-raising drive for the
Stanford Childrens' Convale
scent Home, this year beginning
May 12 with a concert by Sergio
Mendes and Brasil '66, continu
ing with community-wide solici
tations, and ending with a three
day, full-scale carnival near the
Stanford Shopping Center and
Con Home. Also, Cardinals
Board has been working to estab
lish a Volunteer Services Office
— a permanent office to coordi
nate Peace Corps, VISTA, and
other social service project re
cruiting.
Pre-Registration Commission.
The general purpose of Pre-Reg
is to orient incoming freshmen
to the University. In the past, the
manner in which this has been
attempted has come under fire.
The group planning next year's
activities is attempting to start
from scratch, abandoning the so
cial emphasis of the past, and
decide what should be included
in an orientation program. Es
sentially, Pre-Reg wants to ex
pedite the adjustment of fresh
men and transfer students to the
physical and intellectual life of
Stanford. It seems reasonable,
they feel, to premise intellectual
adjustment on a previous physi
cal orientation since it might be
unnecessarily upsetting to shock
the mind intellectually before it
has a chance to adjust to other
aspects of the new environment.
The overriding theme is to chal
lenge newcomers — challenge
them to face issues with an open
mind and challenge them to
know themselves and those

around them on more than a
superficial level.
A_xe Commission — our school
spirit group is basically in
charge of rallies, card stunts at
football games, and cheering sec
tions. Also, they coordinate the
annual Spring Sing in Frost Am
phitheater. Axe Comrn has suf
feied over the last several years
from its image as an in-crowd
party group. Next year's Axe
Coram is working to counter the
old image with positive pro
grams, appealing to a sometimes
lagging school spirit. As with
Pre-Reg, this has involved a re
thinking of objectives.
Political Union Board. The pur
pose of Political Union is to pre
sent a varied program of edu
cation on political and social is
sues. The Board does not take
positions on these issues, but
rather attempts to supplement
the efforts of others to present
to Stanford a balanced program
of speakers and panels. It works
in close cooperation with many
other University and student
groups in bringing speakers.
For example, Poli U helped
the Black Student Union sponsor
Ron Karenga during Winter
Quarter, with the support of
Tresidder Union and the ASSU
Legislature. Political Union also
sponsored speeches by Sen. Eu
gene McCarthy, Sen. Gale Mc-
Gee, M. Francois Mitterand, and
William Rusher, among others.
Institute of International Re
lations. The purpose of the lIR
is to serve Stanford University
as a center for ideas, informa
tion, and activity concerning
international relations and,
through policies and projects.
The lIR works to accomplish its
goals through various informa
tional conferences, exchange pro
grams with several foreign uni
versities, publications, and pro
grams in cooperation with the In
ternational Center.
The lIR frequently sponsors
speakers and encourages inter
action between American stu
dents, foreign students, and oth
er participants. One of the most
recent actvities of the lIR was
the Mexicali Work Project over
Spring break. Also included are
the weekly I-Club Evenings
Abroad, coffee hours, language
hours, and foreign student pre
reg.
National Student Association.
With the controversy over mem
bership in NSA, the major acti
vity of this group has been its
autonomous Stanford Area Tu
torial program in East Palo Alto.
Workers on the tutorial are at
tempting to expand its scope, as
well as coordinating all the other
tutorials on campus. The NSA
tutorial now includes about 80
volunteer tutors, with as many
tutees. NSA recently sent some
students to a conference in Los

Angeles concerning student drug
use, and is looking forward to
another conference on "student
stress."
Speech Association. One of the
larger segments of the budget
goes to send Stanford debaters
and speakers to tournaments a'
other schools, as well as to spon
sor tourneys here on campus
The Speech Association is about
150 strong, one of tho largest
collegiate speech groups.
Student-Faculty Board. The
Stu-Fac Board was organized t-.
promote a closer relationship be
tween the students and the far
ulty, and to assist student groups
in realizing their purposes. Thi c
they accomplish in part through
encouraging and arranging stu
dent-faculty firesides and hostels,
and through promoting the fac
ulty associate programs. Th'
Board includes faculty members
Professor Commission. The
Professor Commission was or
ganized last Spring with the pur
pose of seeking an educator to
serve for an academic year as
an ASSU-supported professor
at-large. He would have no for
mal attachments to any specific
department at Stanford, but rath
er function as an individual spon
soring his own seminars in a
manner the Association sees fit.
This, also, is a student-faculty
commission.
There are several other groups
which are not supported finan
cially by the ASSU, but affiliated
with it. These are Rams Head
(dramatic productions), Wom
en's Recreation Association, tho
ASSU Travel Service, and all the
ASSU publications. The publica
tions include the Daily, the Quad,
the Chaparral, the Workshop,
and the Stanford Course Review.
For all of them, the ASSU acts
as publisher. All but the Daily
are completely self-financing;
the Daily receives about $28,000
per year as a subsidy-subscrip
tion fee. This figure amounts to
about 2VaC per student per issue,
and represents a small part of
the Daily's total budget.
What I am trying to say with
all this is that the ASSU is a
very large and complex organiza
tion. Such a statement seems
very trite, but in the last few
weeks I have heard a great many
students say something like,
"Fine, abolish ASSU. We don't
need Legislature anyway."
Maybe we don't need LASSU,
but Stanford would be even dead
er than it has been this year
without many of the programs
sponsored by ASSU. And pros
pects now are looking better as
many of the groups are being
reorganized and revitalized. Be
fore restructuring ASSU or
abolishing the whole business,
the student body should study
more carefully what it is they
are talking about.
Strangely enough, with all the
talk lately about the merits of
the Associated Students, there
exists a great deal of confusion
as to what ASSU actually is. It
seems appropriate that the basic
facts be clarified before discus
sing how the structure should
be changed. This is not to be
either a defense or an argument
for change — just what ASSU is
now.
First, all Stanford students
who hold a valid Certificate of
Registration are automatically
members — whether undergrad
uate or graduate. Thus all stu
dents are eligible to participate
in both the political and pro
gram-oriented activities of the
ASSU, either as decision-makers
or recipients of the benefits such
as speakers, hostels, or concerts.
In the ASSU Constitution,
adopted in mid-1963, the Asso
ciation has three branches: the
Executive, the Legislature, and
the Judicial Council. In contrast
to the pre-1963 setup, the Pres
ident is separate from the Legi
slature — the theoretically su
preme body — and, for an execu
tive, has few actual duties. All
administrative functions remain
with the Legislature.
The President is, on paper, the
overseer of the entire ASSU ma
chine. He is an ex-officio member
of all boards and commissions,
has a veto power over the Legi
slature, and is charged with ex
ecutive supervision of the ASSU
Office. One of his most important
powers is that of appointing the
student members of the many
University committees. In this
respect, he is now much more
powerful than Presidents two or
three years ago who could only
recommend the students for com
mittees, with the ultimate deci
sion made by the University
President.
Even with these powers and
duties, which sound at first con
siderable, the President actually
spends little time at them- The
remainder of his time is occupied
with his particular interests,
such as Mr. Massarenti's music
programs. Therefore, the char
acter of each year's student gov
ernment is dependent upon the
personality and interests of the
executive.
LASSU — the student legisla
ture — is the victim of many
problems and circumstances. In
1963, the size of LASSU was in
creased to its present number of
about 150 seats. The purpose
was to provide a direct represen
tational system for all living
groups and graduate school con
stituencies. The idea was good,
but the result is that Legislature
is now overburdened with de
tails. It Is becoming hopelessly
bogged down. Its large size is a

very large and complex organiza
tion. Such a statement seems
very trite, but in the last few
weeks I have heard a great many
students say something like,
"Fine, abolish ASSU. We don't
need Legislature anyway."
Maybe we don't need LASSU,
but Stanford would be even dead
er than it has been this year
without many of the programs
sponsored by ASSU. And pros
pects now are looking better as
many of the groups are being
reorganized and revitalized. Be
fore restructuring ASSU or
abolishing the whole business,
the student body should study
more carefully what it is they
are talking about.
Strangely enough, with all the
talk lately about the merits of
the Associated Students, there
exists a great deal of confusion
as to what ASSU actually is. It
seems appropriate that the basic
facts be clarified before discus
sing how the structure should
be changed. This is not to be
either a defense or an argument
for change — just what ASSU is
now.
First, all Stanford students
who hold a valid Certificate of
Registration are automatically
members — whether undergrad
uate or graduate. Thus all stu
dents are eligible to participate
in both the political and pro
gram-oriented activities of the
ASSU, either as decision-makers
or recipients of the benefits such
as speakers, hostels, or concerts.
In the ASSU Constitution,
adopted in mid-1963, the Asso
ciation has three branches: the
Executive, the Legislature, and
the Judicial Council. In contrast
to the pre-1963 setup, the Pres
ident is separate from the Legi
slature — the theoretically su
preme body — and, for an execu
tive, has few actual duties. All
administrative functions remain
with the Legislature.
The President is, on paper, the
overseer of the entire ASSU ma
chine. He is an ex-officio member
of all boards and commissions,
has a veto power over the Legi
slature, and is charged with ex
ecutive supervision of the ASSU
Office. One of his most important
powers is that of appointing the
student members of the many
University committees. In this
respect, he is now much more
powerful than Presidents two or
three years ago who could only
recommend the students for com
mittees, with the ultimate deci
sion made by the University
President.
Even with these powers and
duties, which sound at first con
siderable, the President actually
spends little time at them- The
remainder of his time is occupied
with his particular interests,
such as Mr. Massarenti's music
programs. Therefore, the char
acter of each year's student gov
ernment is dependent upon the
personality and interests of the
executive.
LASSU — the student legisla
ture — is the victim of many
problems and circumstances. In
1963, the size of LASSU was in
creased to its present number of
about 150 seats. The purpose
was to provide a direct represen
tational system for all living
groups and graduate school con
stituencies. The idea was good,
but the result is that Legislature
is now overburdened with de
tails. It Is becoming hopelessly
bogged down. Its large size is a
significant handicap, and the idea
of true representation has been
lost.
The Legislature's duties and
powers include appropriation of
an approximately $130,000 an
nual budget, supervision of all
elections, establishing such
Boards and Commissions are are
necessary to administer general
fields of student activity or in
terest, and to interpret the Fun
damental Standard, the Honor
Code, its Constitution, and its
By-Laws.
One of the two most signifi
cant functions of the Legislature
is its administration of the

ASSU Master Budget. Each
Spring the Student Financial
Manager submits the budget re
quests of the Boards and Com
missions to Legislature for ap
proval.
At that time the groups which
are included in the ASSU By-
Laws request money for speci
fied projects and programs. The
Legislature must decide which
actvities it will support for the
following year. The difference
between what is appropriated
and the total amount available
is put into a contingency fund,
from which the Legislature can
make additional appropriations
to ASSU groups, or offer aid to
voluntary student organizations
for their programs. (ASSU fi
nances will be covered in a later
article.)
Once the Budget has been ap
proved, the Boards and Commis
sions take off in their own direc
tions carrying out their indivi
dual programs. Of course, they
are not allowed to spend reck
lessly since all transactions must
go through the office of the Stu
dent Financial Manager in order
that the intentions of Legislature
may be carried out.
The real substance of the ac
tivities of the Associated Stu
dents is found in the Boards and
Commissions. These groups in
clude, Art Board, Associated
Women Students, Axe Commis
sion, Cardinals Board, Elections
Commission, Graduate Student
Association, Institute of Interna
tional Relations, National Stu
dent Association, Political Union
Board, Pre-Registration Com
mission, Publications Board, Pro
fessor Commission, Speech As
sociation, and the Student-Fac
ulty Board. Some of the activi
ties of these groups will give an
indication of what ASSU really
is:
Cardinals Board is somewhat
of a catchall for tradition-orient
ed activities. It is in charge of the
Big Game Bonfire, Homecoming,
and High School Day (for pros
pective freshmen). Its biggest ac
tivity of the year is the week
long fund-raising drive for the
Stanford Childrens' Convale
scent Home, this year beginning
May 12 with a concert by Sergio
Mendes and Brasil '66, continu
ing with community-wide solici
tations, and ending with a three
day, full-scale carnival near the
Stanford Shopping Center and
Con Home. Also, Cardinals
Board has been working to estab
lish a Volunteer Services Office
— a permanent office to coordi
nate Peace Corps, VISTA, and
other social service project re
cruiting.
Pre-Registration Commission.
The general purpose of Pre-Reg
is to orient incoming freshmen
to the University. In the past, the
manner in which this has been
attempted has come under fire.
The group planning next year's
activities is attempting to start
from scratch, abandoning the so
cial emphasis of the past, and
decide what should be included
in an orientation program. Es
sentially, Pre-Reg wants to ex
pedite the adjustment of fresh
men and transfer students to the
physical and intellectual life of
Stanford. It seems reasonable,
they feel, to premise intellectual
adjustment on a previous physi
cal orientation since it might be
unnecessarily upsetting to shock
the mind intellectually before it
has a chance to adjust to other
aspects of the new environment.
The overriding theme is to chal
lenge newcomers — challenge
them to face issues with an open
mind and challenge them to
know themselves and those

around them on more than a
superficial level.
A_xe Commission — our school
spirit group is basically in
charge of rallies, card stunts at
football games, and cheering sec
tions. Also, they coordinate the
annual Spring Sing in Frost Am
phitheater. Axe Comrn has suf
feied over the last several years
from its image as an in-crowd
party group. Next year's Axe
Coram is working to counter the
old image with positive pro
grams, appealing to a sometimes
lagging school spirit. As with
Pre-Reg, this has involved a re
thinking of objectives.
Political Union Board. The pur
pose of Political Union is to pre
sent a varied program of edu
cation on political and social is
sues. The Board does not take
positions on these issues, but
rather attempts to supplement
the efforts of others to present
to Stanford a balanced program
of speakers and panels. It works
in close cooperation with many
other University and student
groups in bringing speakers.
For example, Poli U helped
the Black Student Union sponsor
Ron Karenga during Winter
Quarter, with the support of
Tresidder Union and the ASSU
Legislature. Political Union also
sponsored speeches by Sen. Eu
gene McCarthy, Sen. Gale Mc-
Gee, M. Francois Mitterand, and
William Rusher, among others.
Institute of International Re
lations. The purpose of the lIR
is to serve Stanford University
as a center for ideas, informa
tion, and activity concerning
international relations and,
through policies and projects.
The lIR works to accomplish its
goals through various informa
tional conferences, exchange pro
grams with several foreign uni
versities, publications, and pro
grams in cooperation with the In
ternational Center.
The lIR frequently sponsors
speakers and encourages inter
action between American stu
dents, foreign students, and oth
er participants. One of the most
recent actvities of the lIR was
the Mexicali Work Project over
Spring break. Also included are
the weekly I-Club Evenings
Abroad, coffee hours, language
hours, and foreign student pre
reg.
National Student Association.
With the controversy over mem
bership in NSA, the major acti
vity of this group has been its
autonomous Stanford Area Tu
torial program in East Palo Alto.
Workers on the tutorial are at
tempting to expand its scope, as
well as coordinating all the other
tutorials on campus. The NSA
tutorial now includes about 80
volunteer tutors, with as many
tutees. NSA recently sent some
students to a conference in Los

Angeles concerning student drug
use, and is looking forward to
another conference on "student
stress."
Speech Association. One of the
larger segments of the budget
goes to send Stanford debaters
and speakers to tournaments a'
other schools, as well as to spon
sor tourneys here on campus
The Speech Association is about
150 strong, one of tho largest
collegiate speech groups.
Student-Faculty Board. The
Stu-Fac Board was organized t-.
promote a closer relationship be
tween the students and the far
ulty, and to assist student groups
in realizing their purposes. Thi c
they accomplish in part through
encouraging and arranging stu
dent-faculty firesides and hostels,
and through promoting the fac
ulty associate programs. Th'
Board includes faculty members
Professor Commission. The
Professor Commission was or
ganized last Spring with the pur
pose of seeking an educator to
serve for an academic year as
an ASSU-supported professor
at-large. He would have no for
mal attachments to any specific
department at Stanford, but rath
er function as an individual spon
soring his own seminars in a
manner the Association sees fit.
This, also, is a student-faculty
commission.
There are several other groups
which are not supported finan
cially by the ASSU, but affiliated
with it. These are Rams Head
(dramatic productions), Wom
en's Recreation Association, tho
ASSU Travel Service, and all the
ASSU publications. The publica
tions include the Daily, the Quad,
the Chaparral, the Workshop,
and the Stanford Course Review.
For all of them, the ASSU acts
as publisher. All but the Daily
are completely self-financing;
the Daily receives about $28,000
per year as a subsidy-subscrip
tion fee. This figure amounts to
about 2VaC per student per issue,
and represents a small part of
the Daily's total budget.
What I am trying to say with
all this is that the ASSU is a
very large and complex organiza
tion. Such a statement seems
very trite, but in the last few
weeks I have heard a great many

through policies and projects.
The lIR works to accomplish its
goals through various informa
tional conferences, exchange pro
grams with several foreign uni
versities, publications, and pro
grams in cooperation with the In
ternational Center.
The lIR frequently sponsors
speakers and encourages inter
action between American stu
dents, foreign students, and oth
er participants. One of the most
recent actvities of the lIR was
the Mexicali Work Project over
Spring break. Also included are
the weekly I-Club Evenings
Abroad, coffee hours, language
hours, and foreign student pre
reg.
National Student Association.
With the controversy over mem
bership in NSA, the major acti
vity of this group has been its
autonomous Stanford Area Tu
torial program in East Palo Alto.
Workers on the tutorial are at
tempting to expand its scope, as
well as coordinating all the other
tutorials on campus. The NSA
tutorial now includes about 80
volunteer tutors, with as many
tutees. NSA recently sent some
students to a conference in Los

Angeles concerning student drug
use, and is looking forward to
another conference on "student
stress."
Speech Association. One of the
larger segments of the budget
goes to send Stanford debaters
and speakers to tournaments a'
other schools, as well as to spon
sor tourneys here on campus
The Speech Association is about
150 strong, one of tho largest
collegiate speech groups.
Student-Faculty Board. The
Stu-Fac Board was organized t-.
promote a closer relationship be
tween the students and the far
ulty, and to assist student groups
in realizing their purposes. Thi c
they accomplish in part through
encouraging and arranging stu
dent-faculty firesides and hostels,
and through promoting the fac
ulty associate programs. Th'
Board includes faculty members
Professor Commission. The
Professor Commission was or
ganized last Spring with the pur
pose of seeking an educator to
serve for an academic year as
an ASSU-supported professor
at-large. He would have no for
mal attachments to any specific
department at Stanford, but rath
er function as an individual spon
soring his own seminars in a
manner the Association sees fit.
This, also, is a student-faculty
commission.
There are several other groups
which are not supported finan
cially by the ASSU, but affiliated
with it. These are Rams Head
(dramatic productions), Wom
en's Recreation Association, tho
ASSU Travel Service, and all the
ASSU publications. The publica
tions include the Daily, the Quad,
the Chaparral, the Workshop,
and the Stanford Course Review.
For all of them, the ASSU acts
as publisher. All but the Daily
are completely self-financing;
the Daily receives about $28,000
per year as a subsidy-subscrip
tion fee. This figure amounts to
about 2VaC per student per issue,
and represents a small part of
the Daily's total budget.
What I am trying to say with
all this is that the ASSU is a
very large and complex organiza
tion. Such a statement seems
very trite, but in the last few
weeks I have heard a great many
students say something like,
"Fine, abolish ASSU. We don't
need Legislature anyway."
Maybe we don't need LASSU,
but Stanford would be even dead
er than it has been this year
without many of the programs
sponsored by ASSU. And pros
pects now are looking better as
many of the groups are being
reorganized and revitalized. Be
fore restructuring ASSU or
abolishing the whole business,
the student body should study
more carefully what it is they
are talking about.
Strangely enough, with all the
talk lately about the merits of
the Associated Students, there
exists a great deal of confusion
as to what ASSU actually is. It
seems appropriate that the basic
facts be clarified before discus
sing how the structure should
be changed. This is not to be
either a defense or an argument
for change — just what ASSU is
now.
First, all Stanford students
who hold a valid Certificate of
Registration are automatically
members — whether undergrad
uate or graduate. Thus all stu
dents are eligible to participate
in both the political and pro
gram-oriented activities of the
ASSU, either as decision-makers
or recipients of the benefits such
as speakers, hostels, or concerts.
In the ASSU Constitution,
adopted in mid-1963, the Asso
ciation has three branches: the
Executive, the Legislature, and
the Judicial Council. In contrast
to the pre-1963 setup, the Pres
ident is separate from the Legi
slature — the theoretically su
preme body — and, for an execu
tive, has few actual duties. All
administrative functions remain
with the Legislature.
The President is, on paper, the
overseer of the entire ASSU ma
chine. He is an ex-officio member
of all boards and commissions,
has a veto power over the Legi
slature, and is charged with ex
ecutive supervision of the ASSU
Office. One of his most important
powers is that of appointing the
student members of the many
University committees. In this
respect, he is now much more
powerful than Presidents two or
three years ago who could only
recommend the students for com
mittees, with the ultimate deci
sion made by the University
President.
Even with these powers and
duties, which sound at first con
siderable, the President actually
spends little time at them- The
remainder of his time is occupied
with his particular interests,
such as Mr. Massarenti's music
programs. Therefore, the char
acter of each year's student gov
ernment is dependent upon the
personality and interests of the
executive.
LASSU — the student legisla
ture — is the victim of many
problems and circumstances. In
1963, the size of LASSU was in
creased to its present number of
about 150 seats. The purpose
was to provide a direct represen
tational system for all living
groups and graduate school con
stituencies. The idea was good,
but the result is that Legislature
is now overburdened with de
tails. It Is becoming hopelessly
bogged down. Its large size is a
significant handicap, and the idea
of true representation has been
lost.
The Legislature's duties and
powers include appropriation of
an approximately $130,000 an
nual budget, supervision of all
elections, establishing such
Boards and Commissions are are
necessary to administer general
fields of student activity or in
terest, and to interpret the Fun
damental Standard, the Honor
Code, its Constitution, and its
By-Laws.
One of the two most signifi
cant functions of the Legislature
is its administration of the

ASSU Master Budget. Each
Spring the Student Financial
Manager submits the budget re
quests of the Boards and Com
missions to Legislature for ap
proval.
At that time the groups which
are included in the ASSU By-
Laws request money for speci
fied projects and programs. The
Legislature must decide which
actvities it will support for the
following year. The difference
between what is appropriated
and the total amount available
is put into a contingency fund,
from which the Legislature can
make additional appropriations
to ASSU groups, or offer aid to
voluntary student organizations
for their programs. (ASSU fi
nances will be covered in a later
article.)
Once the Budget has been ap
proved, the Boards and Commis
sions take off in their own direc
tions carrying out their indivi
dual programs. Of course, they
are not allowed to spend reck
lessly since all transactions must
go through the office of the Stu
dent Financial Manager in order
that the intentions of Legislature
may be carried out.
The real substance of the ac
tivities of the Associated Stu
dents is found in the Boards and
Commissions. These groups in
clude, Art Board, Associated
Women Students, Axe Commis
sion, Cardinals Board, Elections
Commission, Graduate Student
Association, Institute of Interna
tional Relations, National Stu
dent Association, Political Union
Board, Pre-Registration Com
mission, Publications Board, Pro
fessor Commission, Speech As
sociation, and the Student-Fac
ulty Board. Some of the activi
ties of these groups will give an
indication of what ASSU really
is:
Cardinals Board is somewhat
of a catchall for tradition-orient
ed activities. It is in charge of the
Big Game Bonfire, Homecoming,
and High School Day (for pros
pective freshmen). Its biggest ac
tivity of the year is the week
long fund-raising drive for the
Stanford Childrens' Convale
scent Home, this year beginning
May 12 with a concert by Sergio
Mendes and Brasil '66, continu
ing with community-wide solici
tations, and ending with a three
day, full-scale carnival near the
Stanford Shopping Center and
Con Home. Also, Cardinals
Board has been working to estab
lish a Volunteer Services Office
— a permanent office to coordi
nate Peace Corps, VISTA, and
other social service project re
cruiting.
Pre-Registration Commission.
The general purpose of Pre-Reg
is to orient incoming freshmen
to the University. In the past, the
manner in which this has been
attempted has come under fire.
The group planning next year's
activities is attempting to start
from scratch, abandoning the so
cial emphasis of the past, and
decide what should be included
in an orientation program. Es
sentially, Pre-Reg wants to ex
pedite the adjustment of fresh
men and transfer students to the
physical and intellectual life of
Stanford. It seems reasonable,
they feel, to premise intellectual
adjustment on a previous physi
cal orientation since it might be
unnecessarily upsetting to shock
the mind intellectually before it
has a chance to adjust to other
aspects of the new environment.
The overriding theme is to chal
lenge newcomers — challenge
them to face issues with an open
mind and challenge them to
know themselves and those

around them on more than a
superficial level.
A_xe Commission — our school
spirit group is basically in
charge of rallies, card stunts at
football games, and cheering sec
tions. Also, they coordinate the
annual Spring Sing in Frost Am
phitheater. Axe Comrn has suf
feied over the last several years
from its image as an in-crowd
party group. Next year's Axe
Coram is working to counter the
old image with positive pro
grams, appealing to a sometimes
lagging school spirit. As with
Pre-Reg, this has involved a re
thinking of objectives.
Political Union Board. The pur
pose of Political Union is to pre
sent a varied program of edu
cation on political and social is
sues. The Board does not take
positions on these issues, but
rather attempts to supplement
the efforts of others to present
to Stanford a balanced program
of speakers and panels. It works
in close cooperation with many
other University and student
groups in bringing speakers.
For example, Poli U helped
the Black Student Union sponsor
Ron Karenga during Winter
Quarter, with the support of
Tresidder Union and the ASSU
Legislature. Political Union also
sponsored speeches by Sen. Eu
gene McCarthy, Sen. Gale Mc-
Gee, M. Francois Mitterand, and
William Rusher, among others.
Institute of International Re
lations. The purpose of the lIR
is to serve Stanford University
as a center for ideas, informa
tion, and activity concerning
international relations and,
through policies and projects.
The lIR works to accomplish its
goals through various informa
tional conferences, exchange pro
grams with several foreign uni
versities, publications, and pro
grams in cooperation with the In
ternational Center.
The lIR frequently sponsors
speakers and encourages inter

dents, foreign students, and oth
