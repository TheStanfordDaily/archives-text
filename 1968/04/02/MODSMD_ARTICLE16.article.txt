# Stanford's Blacks Drawn From The Middle Class
## 
### STEVE RUTKUS 
If one accepts the message of
the Rosenzweig-Black report that
Stanford should admit more
black students and should even
actively recruit them, the ques
tion of where to recruit them is
of primary concern.
Their report offers an answer
— by asserting that "Stanford's
impact on society will be great
est if its sights are on the high
est quality," Rosenzweig and
Black implicitly resign the black
ghetto to a puny status among
the potential black recruiting
grounds.
The middle-class Negro un
equivocally emerges as the Stan
ford selectee.
In following this logic, Asso
ciate Provost Rosenzweig told
this writer, "I don't shy away
from the notion we'll get middle
class Negroes."
"Stanford never can have a
large numerical impact," Rosenz
weig continues. Instead, "our
impact can be significant in help
ing to provide leadership for the
next generation of Negroes."
Rosenzweig believes strongly
in the "intellectual talent" of
minority groups and is critical
of the white university — "we
haven't been clever enough about
identifying and nurturing this
talent."
Although he hopes Stanford
will more intensively recruit in
the ghettoes, he would expect
"much lower standards of pre
paration" on the average from
student prospects there.
"To recruit to this community
students who can be expected
to have extreme problems of
academic and social adjustment,"
would be "extremely unwise"
and "cruel," he and Black have
written.
Although Stanford can't, "pub
lic institutions can bear the
largest load numerically," Rosen
zweig tells this writer. Also, he
expects "elaborate remedial pro
grams" from such institutions.
So ideally, one concludes, pub
lic universities would offer op
portunity to the disadvantaged
ghetto Negro. Simultaneously,
Stanford would cultivate, as the

report is written, the "highest
standards of quality" for the
"promising" Negro.
But will two variant levels of
education mold two different
brands of Negro intellectual ac
tivists, with ominously different
perspectives? Will whites, as
they become more exposed to
blacks, interact with this other
race in a way that acknowledges
the black race's dignity? These
and other questions the educator
will have to weigh.
To John Powell, a Black Stu
dents Union member, the ques
tion is not will the Stanford
black man be recruited and ad

mitted from the ghetto, or from
middle-class suburbia, but, will
the black man be admitted at
all?
"All this talk about recruit
ment is irrelevant," Powell told
Rosenzweig, "when 55 black
freshman applicants were re
jected last year, most of whom
were qualified."
The statement, Rosenzweig ad
mits, is true. While the SAT me
dian verbal score for those blacks
not accepted, 519, was consider
ably below the whole class score
of 653, most of those black stu
dents probably could cope with
Stanford academic demands.

ghetto Negro. Simultaneously,
Stanford would cultivate, as the

report is written, the "highest
standards of quality" for the
"promising" Negro.
But will two variant levels of
education mold two different
brands of Negro intellectual ac
tivists, with ominously different
perspectives? Will whites, as
they become more exposed to
blacks, interact with this other
race in a way that acknowledges
the black race's dignity? These
and other questions the educator
will have to weigh.
To John Powell, a Black Stu
dents Union member, the ques
tion is not will the Stanford
black man be recruited and ad

mitted from the ghetto, or from
middle-class suburbia, but, will
the black man be admitted at
all?
"All this talk about recruit
ment is irrelevant," Powell told
Rosenzweig, "when 55 black
freshman applicants were re
jected last year, most of whom
were qualified."
The statement, Rosenzweig ad
mits, is true. While the SAT me
dian verbal score for those blacks
not accepted, 519, was consider
ably below the whole class score
of 653, most of those black stu
dents probably could cope with
Stanford academic demands.
If one accepts the message of
the Rosenzweig-Black report that
Stanford should admit more
black students and should even
actively recruit them, the ques
tion of where to recruit them is
of primary concern.
Their report offers an answer
— by asserting that "Stanford's
impact on society will be great
est if its sights are on the high
est quality," Rosenzweig and
Black implicitly resign the black
ghetto to a puny status among
the potential black recruiting
grounds.
The middle-class Negro un
equivocally emerges as the Stan
ford selectee.
In following this logic, Asso
ciate Provost Rosenzweig told
this writer, "I don't shy away
from the notion we'll get middle
class Negroes."
"Stanford never can have a
large numerical impact," Rosenz
weig continues. Instead, "our
impact can be significant in help
ing to provide leadership for the
next generation of Negroes."
Rosenzweig believes strongly
in the "intellectual talent" of
minority groups and is critical
of the white university — "we
haven't been clever enough about
identifying and nurturing this
talent."
Although he hopes Stanford
will more intensively recruit in
the ghettoes, he would expect
"much lower standards of pre
paration" on the average from
student prospects there.
"To recruit to this community
students who can be expected
to have extreme problems of
academic and social adjustment,"
would be "extremely unwise"
and "cruel," he and Black have
written.
Although Stanford can't, "pub
lic institutions can bear the
largest load numerically," Rosen
zweig tells this writer. Also, he
expects "elaborate remedial pro
grams" from such institutions.
So ideally, one concludes, pub
lic universities would offer op
portunity to the disadvantaged
ghetto Negro. Simultaneously,
Stanford would cultivate, as the

report is written, the "highest
standards of quality" for the
"promising" Negro.

tivists, with ominously different
