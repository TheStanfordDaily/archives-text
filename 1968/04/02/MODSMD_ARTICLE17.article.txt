## Only We Can Prevent Forests 
### PETER M. DOLINGER 
Growing concern in the Amer
ican scientific community over
the use of chemical and biologi
cal weapons in Vietnam has
prompted the release of a De
fense Department handbook
which attempts to justify the
use of chemical defoliation
agents.
It is evident that the Defense
Department had to say some
thing in the hope of pacifying
the scientific and intellectual
communities, which have been
demanding an end to the use of
chemical and biological weapons
(CBW) for several years. But it
is also evident that the Pentagon
cannot justify its actions on any
scientific grounds. The "sum
mary digest" of ecological effects
of defoliation and crop destruc
tion is a potpourri of wrong
theory, misleading information,
and insane conclusions. The re
search which went into this
study is mostly classified and
therefore has not been discussed
by the scientific community, and
has been based on testing done
in Maryland and Utah, not Viet
nam.
Here are some of the Penta
gon's conclusions:

1. "In many temperate zone
areas, herbicidal treatment of
forest has improved the wildlife
habitat and favored animal pro
duction through increases in
wildlife food plants. . . . Animals
such as the rare kouprey, an an
cestral bovine, may be favored
by the increase in bamboo and
grasses following defoliation."
2. "Direct toxic effects on fish
and aquatic organisms are negli
gible. Destruction of specific
plants used for fish foods will
lead to changes in the food chain
of the equatic ecosystem. Appli
cation of herbicides to remove
floating aquatic weeds will pro
vide important benefits, because
their presence depletes the oxy
gen content of the water."
3. "Herbicides now in use in
Vietnam will not persist at a phy
totoxic (plant-poisoning) level
in the soil for long periods."
Conclusions such as these
make it difficult for me to believe
that any environmental biologist
participated in their formulation.
No scientific journal would pub
lish them; no ecologist could ac
cept them. No animal or plant,
the rare kouprey not withstand
ing, is isolated from its environ
ment. Everything eats some-

thing, and plants are the bast
of this chain. Furthermore the
ecosystem which is now in exist
ence in Vietnam is there for rea
sons based on eons of experimen
tation by nature, not a few weeks
of paper shuffling in Washing
ton.
This report might be less dis
tressing if we could think of it
as the result of government in
competence and oversight, rather
than a deliberate attempt to de
ceive those who read it. But this
prerogative is denied us. The
Pentagon states that herbicidal
chemicals do not stay in the soil
for "long" periods. How long
can they mean? They are using
2 • chlorophenoxyacetic acid,
which stays in soil for over one
year, and 3,4-dichlorophenoxyace
tic acid, which simply never
leaves soil.
The Pentagon has stated that
there is no danger to civilian or
wildlife populations as results of
chemical treatment of plants.
But the major rice-killing chem
ical now used by the U.S., caco
dylic acid, contains 54% arsenic,
is extremely poisonous, and
tends to accumulate in animal
and plant tissues, rather than
leave them.

their presence depletes the oxy
gen content of the water."
3. "Herbicides now in use in
Vietnam will not persist at a phy
totoxic (plant-poisoning) level
in the soil for long periods."
Conclusions such as these
make it difficult for me to believe
that any environmental biologist
participated in their formulation.
No scientific journal would pub
lish them; no ecologist could ac
cept them. No animal or plant,
the rare kouprey not withstand
ing, is isolated from its environ
ment. Everything eats some-

thing, and plants are the bast
of this chain. Furthermore the
ecosystem which is now in exist
ence in Vietnam is there for rea
sons based on eons of experimen
tation by nature, not a few weeks
of paper shuffling in Washing
ton.
This report might be less dis
tressing if we could think of it
as the result of government in
competence and oversight, rather
than a deliberate attempt to de
ceive those who read it. But this
prerogative is denied us. The
Pentagon states that herbicidal
chemicals do not stay in the soil
for "long" periods. How long
can they mean? They are using
2 • chlorophenoxyacetic acid,
which stays in soil for over one
year, and 3,4-dichlorophenoxyace
tic acid, which simply never
leaves soil.
The Pentagon has stated that
there is no danger to civilian or
wildlife populations as results of
chemical treatment of plants.
But the major rice-killing chem
ical now used by the U.S., caco
dylic acid, contains 54% arsenic,
is extremely poisonous, and
tends to accumulate in animal
and plant tissues, rather than
leave them.
Growing concern in the Amer
ican scientific community over
the use of chemical and biologi
cal weapons in Vietnam has
prompted the release of a De
fense Department handbook
which attempts to justify the
use of chemical defoliation
agents.
It is evident that the Defense
Department had to say some
thing in the hope of pacifying
the scientific and intellectual
communities, which have been
demanding an end to the use of
chemical and biological weapons
(CBW) for several years. But it
is also evident that the Pentagon
cannot justify its actions on any
scientific grounds. The "sum
mary digest" of ecological effects
of defoliation and crop destruc
tion is a potpourri of wrong
theory, misleading information,
and insane conclusions. The re
search which went into this
study is mostly classified and
therefore has not been discussed
by the scientific community, and
has been based on testing done
in Maryland and Utah, not Viet
nam.
Here are some of the Penta
gon's conclusions:

1. "In many temperate zone
areas, herbicidal treatment of
forest has improved the wildlife
habitat and favored animal pro
duction through increases in
wildlife food plants. . . . Animals
such as the rare kouprey, an an
cestral bovine, may be favored
by the increase in bamboo and
grasses following defoliation."
2. "Direct toxic effects on fish
and aquatic organisms are negli
gible. Destruction of specific
plants used for fish foods will
lead to changes in the food chain
of the equatic ecosystem. Appli
cation of herbicides to remove
floating aquatic weeds will pro
vide important benefits, because
their presence depletes the oxy
gen content of the water."

Vietnam will not persist at a phy
totoxic (plant-poisoning) level
in the soil for long periods."
