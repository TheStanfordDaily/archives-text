# The 						Fate Of The Cities
## 
### Max Lerner 
Amid the din and clatter of
the Vietnamese war debate there
is danger of forgetting the other
big issue of the American elec
tion fight: the cities issue. There
has been nothing like the same
pressure on the candidates to
speak out on this as on Vietnam.
Yet the recent episodes of loot
ing and violence in Memphis
must prod the whole nation
again into asking what can be
done about the cities.
However agonizing the war in
Vietnam is today, it will be over
and somehow settled long before
the fate of American cities has
been cleared up.

My own approach can be
summed up in two words: con
ciliation and coalition. I am
thinking of conciliation as the
basic mood necessary between
whites and blacks. I am think
ing of a coalition of government,
business, labor, the universities,
the foundations and community
groups to organize a total at
tack in depth on the total prob
lem.
Support For Conciliation
I am happy that Eugene Mc-
Carthy has spoken out for con
ciliation, and it is also Robert
Kennedy's trend, whatever some
of his more blood-and-thunder
young speechwriters may wish
him to say. It is known to be
Nelson Rockefeller's basic mood.
The danger lies with the Negro
militants on the one side and
with the get-tough mood of
some of the whites, to whom
George Wallace addresses his
appeals. I trust that neither
Ronald Reagan nor Richard
Nixon will give comfort to the
get-tough solutions of the re
pression of violence which can
never be real solutions in Am
erica.
One can always mask the get
tough appeals under law-and
order and safe-streets slogans,
and there may well be a harvest
of votes for that theme in the
election, but any man getting to
be President on those slogans
would find his task of concilia
tion all the harder once he was
in the White House.
Similarly, the young black
power leaders can always mask
their destructive drive under the
slogans of "black identity," but

the Negro community as a
whole always pays dearly for
what its few young looters and
snipers do.
Struggle Of Ideologies
I don't believe, as many do,
that a bloody summer on the
American city streets is "in
evitable." The chances of its
happening are pretty grim, but
those chances can only be im
proved by any surrender to "in
evitability." The path must be
one of conciliation, not only on

the part of the nation's leaders
and the white majority, but also
of the Negro community and its
leaders. TTiere is a struggle go
ing on inside the Negro com
munity, between the philosophy
of separatism and that of con
ciliation. Much will depend on
how it comes out.
But very little can be done
in the realm of mood unless
something new happens in the
realm of action.

proved by any surrender to "in
evitability." The path must be
one of conciliation, not only on

the part of the nation's leaders
and the white majority, but also
of the Negro community and its
leaders. TTiere is a struggle go
ing on inside the Negro com
munity, between the philosophy
of separatism and that of con
ciliation. Much will depend on
how it comes out.
But very little can be done
in the realm of mood unless
something new happens in the
realm of action.

Amid the din and clatter of
the Vietnamese war debate there
is danger of forgetting the other
big issue of the American elec
tion fight: the cities issue. There
has been nothing like the same
pressure on the candidates to
speak out on this as on Vietnam.
Yet the recent episodes of loot
ing and violence in Memphis
must prod the whole nation
again into asking what can be
done about the cities.
However agonizing the war in
Vietnam is today, it will be over
and somehow settled long before
the fate of American cities has
been cleared up.

My own approach can be
summed up in two words: con
ciliation and coalition. I am
thinking of conciliation as the
basic mood necessary between
whites and blacks. I am think
ing of a coalition of government,
business, labor, the universities,
the foundations and community
groups to organize a total at
tack in depth on the total prob
lem.
Support For Conciliation
I am happy that Eugene Mc-
Carthy has spoken out for con
ciliation, and it is also Robert
Kennedy's trend, whatever some
of his more blood-and-thunder
young speechwriters may wish
him to say. It is known to be
Nelson Rockefeller's basic mood.
The danger lies with the Negro
militants on the one side and
with the get-tough mood of
some of the whites, to whom
George Wallace addresses his
appeals. I trust that neither
Ronald Reagan nor Richard
Nixon will give comfort to the
get-tough solutions of the re
pression of violence which can
never be real solutions in Am
erica.
One can always mask the get
tough appeals under law-and
order and safe-streets slogans,
and there may well be a harvest
of votes for that theme in the
election, but any man getting to
be President on those slogans
would find his task of concilia
tion all the harder once he was
in the White House.
Similarly, the young black
power leaders can always mask
their destructive drive under the
slogans of "black identity," but

the Negro community as a
whole always pays dearly for
what its few young looters and
snipers do.
Struggle Of Ideologies
I don't believe, as many do,
that a bloody summer on the
American city streets is "in
evitable." The chances of its
happening are pretty grim, but
those chances can only be im
proved by any surrender to "in
evitability." The path must be
one of conciliation, not only on

the part of the nation's leaders
and the white majority, but also
of the Negro community and its
leaders. TTiere is a struggle go
ing on inside the Negro com
munity, between the philosophy

ciliation. Much will depend on
