# ACLU Endorses Open Recruitment
## 
### 
The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) has said on-cam
pus career recruitment should
be open to all corporations and
government agencies if it is open
to any.
In a statement issued Monday
the organization's executive John
de Pemberton, Jr., wrote, "The
barring of accredited outside
agencies strikes against the con
cept of the open university and
the right of students to hear all
points of view."
Sent to presidents of 200 lead
ing colleges and universities, the
statement was based on a deci
sion of the ACLU's board of di
rectors. The organization, con
sidered liberal, hires lawyers to
argue causes that have some bear
ing on judicial interpretations
about freedoms of citizens.
The statement said, "It is our

judgment that no issues of civil
liberties are raised if an educa
tional institution decides as a
matter of policy to admit all ac
credited recruiting agents from
the campus or to admit none,
but a decision to admit some and
exclude others would be discrim
inatory and an incursion into
the basic principles of academic
freedom."
The statement stressed that
protests relating to recruitment
on campuses should be "fully
protected." But the organization
cautioned that demonstrators
who step outside the law should
be prepared to accept the con
sequences of their actions.
The Union also advised that
outside police should not be sum
moned to a campus to deal with
unruly demonstrators unless
all other techniques of control
"have clearly failed."
