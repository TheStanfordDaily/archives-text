# '30 Years Of Fear'
## Police Crack Down At U. Of Madrid 
### DAVID SALTMAN College Press Service 
A first visit to the City Uni
versity of Madrid is a startling
experience.
When I went there a 35-day
shut-down, which was imposed
by the police as a result of stu
dent demonstrations, had ended
and classes were in session.
Nevertheless, the Guardias
Clviles, government security po
licemen, were much in evidence.
In front of the building that
houses the Medical faculty, for
example, there were three arm
ored jeeps with four policemen
in each, a small bus filled with
about 20 more policemen, and
two helmeted Guardlas in front
of every door.
I couldn't get inside, because
to do so require a special identi
fication card and proof of busi
ness, but I'm told that there are
more uniformed police inside
patrolling the halls, and some
times dropping in on classes
where they suspect anti-govern
ment activity might be going on.
In addition, there are plain
clothes dectectives who pose as
students at the university, as
well as genuine students who act
as police informants (mostly
members of the Fascist youth
movement.)
Although the government
has always exercised strict
control over the university, the
recent Increase in repressive
measures stem from last se

mester, when students became
fed up with the official govern
ment student association. They
formed the Democratic Union
of Spanish Students (DUSS)
to represent them In demands
for educational reform. DUSS
did nothing more than print
memos, but In a fascist state
publishing can be dangerous.
Midway through last semester
the police raided one of the of
fices of the Democratic Union.
They smashed the printing press,
burned the books and destroyed
all the office equipment. In re
taliation, several hundred stu
dents burned a city bus (empty)
in front of a platoon of police
men. Instead of arresting the
students, the police photograph
ed the burning bus and passed
out the pictures to the news
papers.
Early this year the police
closed down the Faculty of Sci
ences — one of the centers of
student protest — with no ex
planation. After dozens of dem>
onstrations by students in other
faculties (marked by bloody
and prolonged battles with fed
eral, local and university po
licemen) they shut down one
after another. For a week the
entire university was closed,
and resembled an army garri
son.
Two days after the univer
sity was re-opened, the Law
Faculty staged a sit-In. When
the police began smashing
students with clubs it turned

Into a free-for-all. The Rec
tor of the University, Dr. Iso
doro Martin, declared sit-ins
Illegal: "In this University,"
he Intoned solemnly, "we per
mit protest, but not violence."
"Our problem," says Pio Moa,
a second-year journalism stu
dent who has close ties with
DUSS, "is that we can't get
anything started. The police
have spies among the students
— especially fasicists — who
tell everything. We've never had
a meeting that the police didn't
know about." At one demonstra
tion, says Moa, the police ar
rested some people before it
took place. They had a list of
everyone scheduled to partici
pate and everything that was
scheduled to happen, he says.
'There are about 600 students
who don't sleep at home any
more because they're afraid of
being arrested," he adds.
This police advance knowl
edge makes peaceful protest im
possible, says Moa. "At our big
gest 'demonstration' we had
about five to eight hundred stu
dents, with the same number
of policemen!" he says. "They
didn't do anything as long as
you walked around, but anyone
who stopped was arrested."
The main obstacle to build
ing a radical movement, in
the opinion of many student
activists, is the lack of a free
press. There is no way to
pass Information (posters are

Immediately ripped down, leaf
leting Is illegal) ho there have
been no really big demonstra
tions. "It even took us a
month to find out that there
had been demonstrations In
Barcelona," adds one student
So it goes in fascist Spain.
People are swallowed up into
the police network and never
heard from again. Old-guard
Catholic families pressure their
university children to keep their
noses clean. The universities are
only too glad to expel conten
tious students, branding them
"revolutionaries" or "commu
nists." The blatant police repres
sion still goes on: recently the
papers reported with evident
glee, that the police had "crush
ed" a pro-Chinese student as
sociation, confiscating all its of
fice materials and books and
destroying its printing press.
There are feeble signs of
Improvement. A recent strike,
organized by students In the
Economics Faculty, had the
support of the dean of eco
nomics, a significant change.
Until very recently, teachers
had to sign loyalty oaths and
be thoroughly Investigated
Spain, so professors weren't
likely to be radicals. If they
took part in student demon
strations they were fired.
Loyalty oaths have been drop
ped now because too many
professors left. "Most of our
best teachers now teach In

the U. 5.," says one rueful stu
dent.
Nevertheless, before they can
really begin to make progress
the students will have to break
the psychological stranglehold
that the police have on students
and faculty members alike. As
Pio Moa says, "We have to over
come 30 years of fear."
As it is now, even radical stu
dents are afraid. After a par
ticularly revealing interview,
one student lowered his voice.
"I must leave now. Too many
people are looking at us." He
stood up, smiled quickly, and
disappeared into the crowd.

licemen) they shut down one

Two days after the univer

Faculty staged a sit-In. When
the police began smashing
students with clubs it turned

Into a free-for-all. The Rec

Illegal: "In this University,"
he Intoned solemnly, "we per

"Our problem," says Pio Moa,
a second-year journalism stu
dent who has close ties with
DUSS, "is that we can't get
anything started. The police
have spies among the students
— especially fasicists — who
tell everything. We've never had
a meeting that the police didn't
know about." At one demonstra
tion, says Moa, the police ar
rested some people before it
took place. They had a list of
everyone scheduled to partici
pate and everything that was
scheduled to happen, he says.
'There are about 600 students
who don't sleep at home any
more because they're afraid of

about five to eight hundred stu

of policemen!" he says. "They
didn't do anything as long as
you walked around, but anyone
who stopped was arrested."
The main obstacle to build

been no really big demonstra

People are swallowed up into
the police network and never
heard from again. Old-guard
Catholic families pressure their
university children to keep their
noses clean. The universities are
only too glad to expel conten

"revolutionaries" or "commu
nists." The blatant police repres
sion still goes on: recently the
papers reported with evident
glee, that the police had "crush
ed" a pro-Chinese student as
sociation, confiscating all its of
fice materials and books and
destroying its printing press.
There are feeble signs of

Until very recently, teachers
had to sign loyalty oaths and
be thoroughly Investigated
Spain, so professors weren't
likely to be radicals. If they
took part in student demon

Loyalty oaths have been drop

professors left. "Most of our
best teachers now teach In

the U. 5.," says one rueful stu
dent.
Nevertheless, before they can
really begin to make progress
the students will have to break
the psychological stranglehold
that the police have on students
and faculty members alike. As
Pio Moa says, "We have to over
come 30 years of fear."
As it is now, even radical stu
dents are afraid. After a par
ticularly revealing interview,
one student lowered his voice.
"I must leave now. Too many
people are looking at us." He
stood up, smiled quickly, and
disappeared into the crowd.
A first visit to the City Uni

Nevertheless, the Guardias
Clviles, government security po

In front of the building that
houses the Medical faculty, for

about 20 more policemen, and
two helmeted Guardlas in front

I couldn't get inside, because
to do so require a special identi

more uniformed police inside
patrolling the halls, and some
times dropping in on classes
where they suspect anti-govern

In addition, there are plain

students at the university, as

as police informants (mostly
members of the Fascist youth

Although the government
has always exercised strict
control over the university, the
recent Increase in repressive
measures stem from last se

formed the Democratic Union

to represent them In demands
for educational reform. DUSS
did nothing more than print
memos, but In a fascist state
publishing can be dangerous.
Midway through last semester
the police raided one of the of
fices of the Democratic Union.
They smashed the printing press,
burned the books and destroyed
all the office equipment. In re

only too glad to expel conten

destroying its printing press.

Until very recently, teachers
had to sign loyalty oaths and
be thoroughly Investigated

likely to be radicals. If they
took part in student demon

Loyalty oaths have been drop

professors left. "Most of our

Nevertheless, before they can
really begin to make progress
the students will have to break
the psychological stranglehold
that the police have on students

A first visit to the City Uni
versity of Madrid is a startling
experience.
When I went there a 35-day
shut-down, which was imposed
by the police as a result of stu
dent demonstrations, had ended
and classes were in session.
Nevertheless, the Guardias
Clviles, government security po
licemen, were much in evidence.
In front of the building that
houses the Medical faculty, for
example, there were three arm
ored jeeps with four policemen
in each, a small bus filled with
about 20 more policemen, and
two helmeted Guardlas in front
of every door.
I couldn't get inside, because
to do so require a special identi
fication card and proof of busi
ness, but I'm told that there are
more uniformed police inside
patrolling the halls, and some
times dropping in on classes
where they suspect anti-govern
ment activity might be going on.
In addition, there are plain
clothes dectectives who pose as
students at the university, as
well as genuine students who act
as police informants (mostly
members of the Fascist youth
movement.)
Although the government
has always exercised strict
control over the university, the
recent Increase in repressive
measures stem from last se

mester, when students became
fed up with the official govern
ment student association. They
formed the Democratic Union
of Spanish Students (DUSS)
to represent them In demands
for educational reform. DUSS
did nothing more than print
memos, but In a fascist state
publishing can be dangerous.
Midway through last semester
the police raided one of the of
fices of the Democratic Union.
They smashed the printing press,
burned the books and destroyed
all the office equipment. In re
taliation, several hundred stu
dents burned a city bus (empty)
in front of a platoon of police
men. Instead of arresting the
students, the police photograph
ed the burning bus and passed
out the pictures to the news
papers.
Early this year the police
closed down the Faculty of Sci
ences — one of the centers of
student protest — with no ex
planation. After dozens of dem>
onstrations by students in other
faculties (marked by bloody
and prolonged battles with fed
eral, local and university po
licemen) they shut down one
after another. For a week the
entire university was closed,
and resembled an army garri
son.
Two days after the univer
sity was re-opened, the Law
Faculty staged a sit-In. When
the police began smashing
students with clubs it turned

Into a free-for-all. The Rec
tor of the University, Dr. Iso
doro Martin, declared sit-ins
Illegal: "In this University,"
he Intoned solemnly, "we per
mit protest, but not violence."
"Our problem," says Pio Moa,
a second-year journalism stu
dent who has close ties with
DUSS, "is that we can't get
anything started. The police
have spies among the students
— especially fasicists — who
tell everything. We've never had
a meeting that the police didn't
know about." At one demonstra
tion, says Moa, the police ar
rested some people before it
took place. They had a list of
everyone scheduled to partici
pate and everything that was
scheduled to happen, he says.
'There are about 600 students
who don't sleep at home any
more because they're afraid of
being arrested," he adds.
This police advance knowl
edge makes peaceful protest im
possible, says Moa. "At our big
gest 'demonstration' we had
about five to eight hundred stu
dents, with the same number
of policemen!" he says. "They
didn't do anything as long as
you walked around, but anyone
who stopped was arrested."
The main obstacle to build
ing a radical movement, in
the opinion of many student
activists, is the lack of a free
press. There is no way to
pass Information (posters are

Immediately ripped down, leaf

been no really big demonstra
