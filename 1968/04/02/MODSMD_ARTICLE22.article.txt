# Gift Puts Stanford In Gem Business
## 
### 
Several weeks ago an adver
tisement ran in the Palo Alto
Times. The merchandise was
ladies' diamond rings and the
purpose was to sell them.
The only thing unusual is that
Stanford University was the
salesman.
Over the years Stanford has
received such gifts to assist in
educational advancement. The
University then has to convert
the merchandise to money.
Besides diamonds Stanford
had received one twin-engine
plane and a yacht. Of lesser
magnitude are gifts like paint
ings, old silver spoons, a snuff
box, and Red Cross lapel pins
dating back to 1906.
Nick Thompson of the pur
chasing department described
how he sold last year's accumu
lation of gifts.
"We advertised in the Daily.
Then we had a showing. We laid
the merchandise out on a big
table in our conference room
and people came to put bids.
Just about everything sold,"
he said.
Mr. Myrl Meyer, from the
general secretary's office, takes
care of legal complications.
"Some people give money or
stocks to the university," he
said. "One lady invested in dia
mond rings and instead of a
monetary gift to the university,
she wanted to give the rings."
The diamonds are kept in a
vault and shown only by ap
pointment. Of the three, the
Marquise cut was appraised at
$9,300 and the Emerald cut was
appraised at $7,000.

If Stanford cannot get enough
for the rings, Meyer explained,
the diamonds may be put on
consignment with a diamond
merchant in New York. The
rings will not fit everyone, he
said. "The $500 to $800 setting
doesn't make too much differ
ence when you are spending
thousands of dollars for the
ring. It's the diamond that
counts."
Sometimes gifts are the re
sults of an estate, part of which
has been willed to the Univer
sity.
Several years ago someone
gave Indian baskets to the Uni
versity, said Meyer. He read a
portion of the will which stated,
"I give, devise, and bequeath
my collection of postage stamps
and of Indian baskets to the
Board of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior University."
Stanford will normally accept
all gifts without questioning
their value.
The difficulty comes in find
ing a use for the gifts. Thomp
son has found ways to handle
all gifts, down to the smallest
knick knack. However, his job is
not altogether without problems.
Once he wanted to sell an
8000 gallon water tank located
across from the athletic depart
ment. The tank used to be a
steam plant, he said. Then the
university decided to get rid of
it.
He believes in the motto
"Don't throw it way, sell it,"
when taking care of all the mer
chandise. "But what do you do
with a 8000 gallon water tank,
that just sits there?" he asked.

Nick Thompson of the pur
chasing department described
how he sold last year's accumu
lation of gifts.
"We advertised in the Daily.
Then we had a showing. We laid
the merchandise out on a big
table in our conference room
and people came to put bids.
Just about everything sold,"
he said.
Mr. Myrl Meyer, from the
general secretary's office, takes
care of legal complications.
"Some people give money or
stocks to the university," he
said. "One lady invested in dia
mond rings and instead of a
monetary gift to the university,
she wanted to give the rings."
The diamonds are kept in a
vault and shown only by ap
pointment. Of the three, the
Marquise cut was appraised at
$9,300 and the Emerald cut was
appraised at $7,000.

If Stanford cannot get enough
for the rings, Meyer explained,
the diamonds may be put on
consignment with a diamond
merchant in New York. The
rings will not fit everyone, he
said. "The $500 to $800 setting
doesn't make too much differ
ence when you are spending
thousands of dollars for the
ring. It's the diamond that
counts."
Sometimes gifts are the re
sults of an estate, part of which
has been willed to the Univer
sity.
Several years ago someone
gave Indian baskets to the Uni
versity, said Meyer. He read a
portion of the will which stated,
"I give, devise, and bequeath
my collection of postage stamps
and of Indian baskets to the
Board of Trustees of Leland
Stanford Junior University."
Stanford will normally accept
all gifts without questioning
their value.
The difficulty comes in find
ing a use for the gifts. Thomp
son has found ways to handle
all gifts, down to the smallest
knick knack. However, his job is
not altogether without problems.
Once he wanted to sell an
8000 gallon water tank located
across from the athletic depart
ment. The tank used to be a
steam plant, he said. Then the
university decided to get rid of
it.
He believes in the motto
"Don't throw it way, sell it,"
when taking care of all the mer
chandise. "But what do you do
with a 8000 gallon water tank,
that just sits there?" he asked.


PARAPHENALIA — Nick Thompson of the University purchasing
department displays a small part of the many surplus articles and
gifts he sells for the University.
Several weeks ago an adver
tisement ran in the Palo Alto
Times. The merchandise was
ladies' diamond rings and the
purpose was to sell them.
The only thing unusual is that
Stanford University was the
salesman.
Over the years Stanford has
received such gifts to assist in
educational advancement. The
University then has to convert
the merchandise to money.
Besides diamonds Stanford
had received one twin-engine
plane and a yacht. Of lesser
magnitude are gifts like paint
ings, old silver spoons, a snuff
box, and Red Cross lapel pins
dating back to 1906.
