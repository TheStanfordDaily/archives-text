# Law Group To Aid Resisters
## 
### ROBERT SPANNER 
The Anti-Draft Union repre
sents one approach to draft op
position. The Law Students
Civil Rights Research Council
represents another.
This group of Stanford law
students is being trained to
counsel people who refuse to
be drafted.
Hank Maiden, Field Secretary
of the Central Committee of
Conscientious Objectors and
himself a conscientious objector
(C.0.) in the Korean War, is
the instructor. He is assisted by
Alan Strain, Associate Field
Secretary, who provides counsel
ing here at Stanford under the
auspices of the office of the
dean of students.
Strain believes that if the
number of students asking for
counseling aid increases as rap
idly as it has this past year,
he will not be able to handle it.
So there is a real need for

the assistance of the law stu
dents.
Andrew Cohen, one of the
students In the group* ex
plained that, "While the stu
dents In the Council will be
counseling those who have
guestions about their rights
and obligations under the
present draft law, we are not
qualified to offer legal advice.
Legal problems will be ban
died by practicing attorneys
In the Bay Area."
According to Cohen, "A group
of attorneys in San Francisco
has established a working orga
nization to handle draft law
cases. A good deal of the re
search we do is for this group."
The Council does not intend
to limit its services to those
who will respond to the draft
in any particular way.
In a statement released to the
press, the council stated: "Those
wondering about obtaining med

ical or student or occupational
deferments, about civil disobed
ience or about conscientious ob
jetcion will receive equal atten
tion. We see our function as pri
marily educational, not politi
cal."
The law students in the group
were not uniform in their reas
ons for opposition to the draft.
Earl Potter, a third-year student
who plans to go into poverty
law, said he objected to the war
and the military draft, but not
to the idea of compulsory na
tional service.
On the other hand, Barbara
Dudley, firstyear student,
stated flatly "I oppose the
draft because I am opposed to
the war, the military draft,
and telling people what to do
with their lives."
The Council was organized by
Douglas Sorenson, a soft-spoken
young law student who has put
a great deal of his time into the
struggle against military con
scription.
He had been classified 3-A
since he was married and had
a child. But he felt that carry
ing his draft card was an im
plicit acceptance of conscription,
and he returned it to his draft
board. Sorenson has been de
clared delinquent, which means
he is liable to induction without
even a physical examination. He
expects that he will have to go
to jail.

Sorenson does not exhibit the
vitriolic anger of his counter
parts in other anti-draft organi
zations. But he seems confident
of his moral convictions, and he
is determined to obey the dic
tates of his conscience, regard
less of the consequences.
His attitude toward the state
is reminiscent of Henry David
Thoreau's blanket indictment of
political coercion: 'The state
never intentionally confronts a
man's sense . . . but only his
body. ... It is not armed with
superior wit or honesty, but
with superior physical strength.
I was not born to be forced. I
will breathe after my own fash
ion. Let us see who is the
strongest."
"I especially object to what
the draft does to people's
minds," Sorenson said. "Every
decision a man makes depends
upon what his draft board
thinks. It is really a sort of
emasculation."
Asked what he expected to
accomplish by being jailed,
Sorenson smiled.
"Just making people look at
the draft as a real issue is
an indication of progress." He
explained that when he visited
the Midwest recently, he no
ticed that people accepted
conscription passively, as
some-thing that had to be
done, "just as they accepted
going to the bathroom."


VIRGIL WHITAKER, Stan
ford's Dean of Graduate Stu
dies, will speak today (Tues.
2 April) at 7:30 p.m. in Tre
sldder on "Values and the Hu
manities." Whitaker, besides be

humanities in English.

Alan Strain, Associate Field
Secretary, who provides counsel
ing here at Stanford under the
auspices of the office of the
dean of students.
Strain believes that if the
number of students asking for
counseling aid increases as rap
idly as it has this past year,
he will not be able to handle it.
So there is a real need for

the assistance of the law stu
dents.
Andrew Cohen, one of the
students In the group* ex
plained that, "While the stu
dents In the Council will be
counseling those who have
guestions about their rights
and obligations under the
present draft law, we are not
qualified to offer legal advice.
Legal problems will be ban
died by practicing attorneys
In the Bay Area."
According to Cohen, "A group
of attorneys in San Francisco
has established a working orga
nization to handle draft law
cases. A good deal of the re
search we do is for this group."
The Council does not intend
to limit its services to those
who will respond to the draft
in any particular way.
In a statement released to the
press, the council stated: "Those
wondering about obtaining med

ical or student or occupational
deferments, about civil disobed
ience or about conscientious ob
jetcion will receive equal atten
tion. We see our function as pri
marily educational, not politi
cal."
The law students in the group
were not uniform in their reas
ons for opposition to the draft.
Earl Potter, a third-year student
who plans to go into poverty
law, said he objected to the war
and the military draft, but not
to the idea of compulsory na
tional service.
On the other hand, Barbara
Dudley, firstyear student,
stated flatly "I oppose the
draft because I am opposed to
the war, the military draft,
and telling people what to do
with their lives."
The Council was organized by
Douglas Sorenson, a soft-spoken
young law student who has put
a great deal of his time into the
struggle against military con
scription.
He had been classified 3-A
since he was married and had
a child. But he felt that carry
ing his draft card was an im
plicit acceptance of conscription,
and he returned it to his draft
board. Sorenson has been de
clared delinquent, which means
he is liable to induction without
even a physical examination. He
expects that he will have to go
to jail.

Sorenson does not exhibit the
vitriolic anger of his counter
parts in other anti-draft organi
zations. But he seems confident
of his moral convictions, and he
is determined to obey the dic
tates of his conscience, regard
less of the consequences.
His attitude toward the state
is reminiscent of Henry David
Thoreau's blanket indictment of
political coercion: 'The state
never intentionally confronts a
man's sense . . . but only his
body. ... It is not armed with
superior wit or honesty, but
with superior physical strength.
I was not born to be forced. I
will breathe after my own fash
ion. Let us see who is the
strongest."
"I especially object to what
the draft does to people's
minds," Sorenson said. "Every
decision a man makes depends
upon what his draft board
thinks. It is really a sort of
emasculation."
Asked what he expected to
accomplish by being jailed,
Sorenson smiled.
"Just making people look at
the draft as a real issue is
an indication of progress." He
explained that when he visited
the Midwest recently, he no
ticed that people accepted
conscription passively, as
some-thing that had to be
done, "just as they accepted
going to the bathroom."

students In the group* ex
plained that, "While the stu
dents In the Council will be
counseling those who have
guestions about their rights
and obligations under the
present draft law, we are not
qualified to offer legal advice.
Legal problems will be ban
died by practicing attorneys
In the Bay Area."
According to Cohen, "A group
of attorneys in San Francisco
has established a working orga
nization to handle draft law
cases. A good deal of the re
search we do is for this group."
The Council does not intend
to limit its services to those
who will respond to the draft
in any particular way.
In a statement released to the
press, the council stated: "Those
wondering about obtaining med

ical or student or occupational
deferments, about civil disobed
ience or about conscientious ob
jetcion will receive equal atten
tion. We see our function as pri
marily educational, not politi
cal."
The law students in the group
were not uniform in their reas
ons for opposition to the draft.
Earl Potter, a third-year student
who plans to go into poverty
law, said he objected to the war
and the military draft, but not
to the idea of compulsory na
tional service.
On the other hand, Barbara
Dudley, firstyear student,
stated flatly "I oppose the
draft because I am opposed to
the war, the military draft,
and telling people what to do
with their lives."
The Council was organized by
Douglas Sorenson, a soft-spoken
young law student who has put
a great deal of his time into the
struggle against military con
scription.
He had been classified 3-A
since he was married and had
a child. But he felt that carry
ing his draft card was an im
plicit acceptance of conscription,
and he returned it to his draft
board. Sorenson has been de
clared delinquent, which means
he is liable to induction without
even a physical examination. He
expects that he will have to go
to jail.

Sorenson does not exhibit the
vitriolic anger of his counter
parts in other anti-draft organi
zations. But he seems confident
of his moral convictions, and he
is determined to obey the dic
tates of his conscience, regard
less of the consequences.
His attitude toward the state
is reminiscent of Henry David
Thoreau's blanket indictment of
political coercion: 'The state
never intentionally confronts a
man's sense . . . but only his
body. ... It is not armed with
superior wit or honesty, but
with superior physical strength.
I was not born to be forced. I
will breathe after my own fash
ion. Let us see who is the
strongest."
"I especially object to what
the draft does to people's
minds," Sorenson said. "Every
decision a man makes depends
upon what his draft board
thinks. It is really a sort of
emasculation."
Asked what he expected to
accomplish by being jailed,
Sorenson smiled.
"Just making people look at
the draft as a real issue is
an indication of progress." He
explained that when he visited
the Midwest recently, he no
ticed that people accepted
conscription passively, as
some-thing that had to be
done, "just as they accepted
going to the bathroom."
