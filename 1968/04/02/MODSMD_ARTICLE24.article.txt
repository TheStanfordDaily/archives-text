# News Fellows Laud Program
## 
### 
"I've been a newsman for
more than a decade; I believe
I've developed as much in the
past three months as I did in
the previous five years."
"It ought to be compulsory
for any journalist who's been
out of school for 10 years or
more. If newspapers keep an
important place in life in the
years ahead, it's be partly be
cause they're equipped to give
readers something TV can't—
deeper understanding of issues
and events. And obviously no
paper is going to be any better
than the people who put it to
gether."
These are newsmen talking—

newsmen from newspapers,,
news magazines, television
newsrooms, and wire services.
They wrote their comments at
the conclusion of their working
sabbatical as Professional Jour
nalism Fellows at Stanford,
where they left behind the daily
pressure of news work for the
different pressures of university
classes, seminars, and heavy
reading.
They attended more than 50
special seminars at which the
guest speakers were off-campus
or faculty authorities on a wide
range of subjects. Each of the
talks, conducted solely for the
Fellows, was followed by ex
tensive question-and-answer ses
sions.
Speakers included Arnold
Toynbee, author Barbara Tuch
man, Otis Chandler, Gov. Rea
gan, Assembly Speaker Jesse
Unruh, Saul Alinsky and Paul
Jacobs, spokesmen for the poor;
Senators Mark Hatfield and
Henry Jackson; Joseph Lohman,
dean of the School of Criminol
ogy at University of California
and former sheriff of Cook
County, 111.; author and attor
ney Mark Lane, editors Norman
Cousins and Erwin Canham;
and several spokesmen for the
ghetto.
In the program's first 18
months, under a Ford Founda
tion grant, there have been 62
fellows. The objective is to pro
vide them with a mid-career aca
demic exposure, an updating of
knowledge, and a door-opening
to new ideas.
Most of the fellows are in mid
career, having demonstrated su
perior ability but being still too
young to have achieved top posi
tions. This spring the experi
ment is being made of appoint
ing also four news executives—
a managing editor, two assist
ant managing editors, and the

editor of a special-assignment
staff.
To date 54 men and 8 women
have participated in the pro
gram. Forty-eight have come
from newspapers, five from
news magazines, five from the
wire services, and four from
broadcasting.
