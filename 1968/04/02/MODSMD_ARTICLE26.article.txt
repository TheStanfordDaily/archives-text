# Citizen Detectives Assist Police In Effort To Stop Crime In U.S.
## 
### HAROLD V. STREETER Associated Press Writer 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—
Hundrdes of amateur detectives
are teaming up with "Mission
11"—specialized undercover
police—in a smashing attack on
burglaries in San Francisco.
People in all walks of life
have been enlisted in an excit
ing game of crime-watching by
two officers who thought up the
whole idea of public participa
tion. Now it's catching on else
where in the nation.
The amateur crime-spotters
run the gamut of citizenry-air
line pilots, doctors, housewives
and just plain old folks with
nothing to do but sit and look
out their windows.
They have police-printed leaf
lets, distributed by the thou
sands. These tell what to watch
for. There is space for writing
down descriptions of suspects
and license numbers of cars.
The telephone tips of these
amateur detectives trigger a
hush-hush drama. At first it
was enacted by undercover spe
cialists Joe Brodnik and Paul
McGoran, who conceived the
"Mission 11" plan. Now it's done
in all nine police districts.
The 18 undercover specialists
—two to a district—go out in
plain clothes disguises—as me
chanics, day laborers, sports
men and just everyday motor
ists. They drive trucks, sports
cars, motorcycles and all sorts
of unmarked automobiles.
Their two-way, hand-carried
radios, so small they are easily
concealed, keep them in instant
touch with police headquarters
for the tips and also with each
other.
These men work with such
clever stealth that commercial
television stations, called in at
the finish, have actually filmed
burglaries in progress. One
film, shown recently for 15 min
utes on home television sets,
was of two thieves stripping
five stolen cars. The film was
turned over to police as trial
evidence.
Here is how it works, in Pa
trolman Brodnik's own words:

"Two airline pilots who live
on Twin Peaks had our leaflet.
Their suspicions were aroused
when three men stopped a car
across the street and two
strolled over to the carport un
der the pilot's apartment.
"When one pilot went down
stairs to check, the pair ran
back to their car and the three
took off. But one pilot jotted
down the car license. Using bi
noculars, the other pilot kept
the fleeing car in sight as long
as he could while his friend
phoned police.
"McGoran and I were in an
unmarked sedan when we got
the call from headquarters. We
were wearing regular work
clothes. A television crew hap
pened to be with us. The day
before, a doctor who was
prompted by our leaflet tipped
off a burglary in the same
area. As a result, the TV crew
came out to take a ride with
us. It got more than it had ex
pected.
"The license number reported
by the pilots led us to the
car, parked in front of an apart

ment. While the TV crew oper
ated around a corner, using a
telephoto lens, we watched the
three burglars enter a resi
dence. We made the arrest
when they came out with cam
eras, radios and clothing.
"With television showing the
whole thing, their conviction
was a cinch."
The Brodnik-McGoran tech
nique has netted them 160 fel
ony arrests and 85 per cent con
victions since the two police
men thought it up less than a
year ago.
They rang hundreds of door
bells, spent hours talking pri
vately with residents on how to
spot suspicious persons.
McGoran is a tall, serious,
dedicated policeman, at 43 a 16-
year veteran of the force.
Brodnik, 40, has had 13 years
in the department. His disarm
ing smile and casual conversa
tion mask the acuteness of his
observation.
In March, 1967, they were
just two more uniformed men,
assigned to a patrol car with

the radio designation "Mission
11."
Daytime burglaries in the
Twin Peaks area alone were
running a dozen a day. Many
of the district's apartment
dwellers are childless couples
who both work. Burglaries
usually were reported hours
late, when the trail was hope
lessly cold.
McGoran and Brodnik ap
proached Captain Kiley with
their plan to recruit crime
watchers among people who
were at home during the day.
"It's worth a try," the captain
said.
The response was astounding.
Since "Mission 11" was ex
tended to all nine districts, the
18 men have rounded up more
than 500 burglary suspects.
Now the 18, whose two-way
radios knit them into a city-wide
team, hold regular secret strat
egy conferences.
The leaflet plan has been
adopted by police of many Bay
Area cities and is catching on
elsewhere in the nation.

"Two airline pilots who live
on Twin Peaks had our leaflet.
Their suspicions were aroused
when three men stopped a car
across the street and two
strolled over to the carport un
der the pilot's apartment.
"When one pilot went down
stairs to check, the pair ran
back to their car and the three
took off. But one pilot jotted
down the car license. Using bi
noculars, the other pilot kept
the fleeing car in sight as long
as he could while his friend
phoned police.
"McGoran and I were in an
unmarked sedan when we got
the call from headquarters. We
were wearing regular work
clothes. A television crew hap
pened to be with us. The day
before, a doctor who was
prompted by our leaflet tipped
off a burglary in the same
area. As a result, the TV crew
came out to take a ride with
us. It got more than it had ex
pected.
"The license number reported
by the pilots led us to the
car, parked in front of an apart

ment. While the TV crew oper
ated around a corner, using a
telephoto lens, we watched the
three burglars enter a resi
dence. We made the arrest
when they came out with cam
eras, radios and clothing.
"With television showing the
whole thing, their conviction
was a cinch."
The Brodnik-McGoran tech
nique has netted them 160 fel
ony arrests and 85 per cent con
victions since the two police
men thought it up less than a
year ago.
They rang hundreds of door
bells, spent hours talking pri
vately with residents on how to
spot suspicious persons.
McGoran is a tall, serious,
dedicated policeman, at 43 a 16-
year veteran of the force.
Brodnik, 40, has had 13 years
in the department. His disarm
ing smile and casual conversa
tion mask the acuteness of his
observation.
In March, 1967, they were
just two more uniformed men,
assigned to a patrol car with

the radio designation "Mission
11."
Daytime burglaries in the
Twin Peaks area alone were
running a dozen a day. Many
of the district's apartment
dwellers are childless couples
who both work. Burglaries
usually were reported hours
late, when the trail was hope
lessly cold.
McGoran and Brodnik ap
proached Captain Kiley with
their plan to recruit crime
watchers among people who
were at home during the day.
"It's worth a try," the captain
said.
The response was astounding.
Since "Mission 11" was ex
tended to all nine districts, the
18 men have rounded up more
than 500 burglary suspects.
Now the 18, whose two-way
radios knit them into a city-wide
team, hold regular secret strat
egy conferences.
The leaflet plan has been
adopted by police of many Bay
Area cities and is catching on
elsewhere in the nation.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—
Hundrdes of amateur detectives
are teaming up with "Mission
11"—specialized undercover
police—in a smashing attack on
burglaries in San Francisco.
People in all walks of life
have been enlisted in an excit
ing game of crime-watching by
two officers who thought up the
whole idea of public participa
tion. Now it's catching on else
where in the nation.
The amateur crime-spotters
run the gamut of citizenry-air
line pilots, doctors, housewives
and just plain old folks with
nothing to do but sit and look
out their windows.
They have police-printed leaf
lets, distributed by the thou
sands. These tell what to watch
for. There is space for writing
down descriptions of suspects
and license numbers of cars.
The telephone tips of these
amateur detectives trigger a
hush-hush drama. At first it
was enacted by undercover spe
cialists Joe Brodnik and Paul
McGoran, who conceived the
"Mission 11" plan. Now it's done
in all nine police districts.
The 18 undercover specialists
—two to a district—go out in
plain clothes disguises—as me
chanics, day laborers, sports
men and just everyday motor
ists. They drive trucks, sports
cars, motorcycles and all sorts
of unmarked automobiles.
Their two-way, hand-carried
radios, so small they are easily
concealed, keep them in instant
touch with police headquarters
for the tips and also with each
other.
These men work with such
clever stealth that commercial
television stations, called in at
the finish, have actually filmed
burglaries in progress. One
film, shown recently for 15 min
utes on home television sets,
was of two thieves stripping
five stolen cars. The film was
turned over to police as trial
evidence.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)—
Hundrdes of amateur detectives
are teaming up with "Mission
11"—specialized undercover
police—in a smashing attack on
burglaries in San Francisco.
People in all walks of life
have been enlisted in an excit
ing game of crime-watching by
two officers who thought up the
whole idea of public participa
tion. Now it's catching on else
where in the nation.
The amateur crime-spotters
run the gamut of citizenry-air
line pilots, doctors, housewives
and just plain old folks with
nothing to do but sit and look
out their windows.
They have police-printed leaf
lets, distributed by the thou
sands. These tell what to watch
for. There is space for writing
down descriptions of suspects
and license numbers of cars.
The telephone tips of these
amateur detectives trigger a
hush-hush drama. At first it
was enacted by undercover spe
cialists Joe Brodnik and Paul
McGoran, who conceived the
"Mission 11" plan. Now it's done
in all nine police districts.
The 18 undercover specialists
—two to a district—go out in
plain clothes disguises—as me
chanics, day laborers, sports
men and just everyday motor
ists. They drive trucks, sports
cars, motorcycles and all sorts
of unmarked automobiles.
Their two-way, hand-carried
radios, so small they are easily
concealed, keep them in instant
touch with police headquarters
for the tips and also with each
other.
These men work with such
clever stealth that commercial
television stations, called in at
the finish, have actually filmed
burglaries in progress. One
film, shown recently for 15 min
utes on home television sets,
was of two thieves stripping
five stolen cars. The film was
turned over to police as trial
evidence.
Here is how it works, in Pa
trolman Brodnik's own words:

"Two airline pilots who live
on Twin Peaks had our leaflet.
Their suspicions were aroused
when three men stopped a car
across the street and two
strolled over to the carport un
der the pilot's apartment.
"When one pilot went down
stairs to check, the pair ran
back to their car and the three
took off. But one pilot jotted
down the car license. Using bi
noculars, the other pilot kept
the fleeing car in sight as long
as he could while his friend
phoned police.
"McGoran and I were in an
unmarked sedan when we got
the call from headquarters. We
were wearing regular work
clothes. A television crew hap
pened to be with us. The day
before, a doctor who was
prompted by our leaflet tipped
off a burglary in the same
area. As a result, the TV crew
came out to take a ride with
us. It got more than it had ex
pected.
"The license number reported
by the pilots led us to the
car, parked in front of an apart

ment. While the TV crew oper
ated around a corner, using a
telephoto lens, we watched the
three burglars enter a resi
dence. We made the arrest
when they came out with cam
eras, radios and clothing.
"With television showing the
whole thing, their conviction
was a cinch."
The Brodnik-McGoran tech
nique has netted them 160 fel
ony arrests and 85 per cent con
victions since the two police
men thought it up less than a
year ago.
They rang hundreds of door
bells, spent hours talking pri
vately with residents on how to
spot suspicious persons.
McGoran is a tall, serious,
dedicated policeman, at 43 a 16-
year veteran of the force.
Brodnik, 40, has had 13 years
in the department. His disarm
ing smile and casual conversa
tion mask the acuteness of his
observation.
